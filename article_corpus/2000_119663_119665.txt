C o n c e rn about the env i r o n m e n t a l
impact of wa r fare began in earnest with
O p e r ation Ranch Hand, the U. S .c a m-
paign to defoliate Viet Nam’s jungles and flu s h
out guerrillas during the late 1960s.A m e ri c a n
m i l i t a ry aircraft sprayed some 70 million litres
of extra-strong herbicides, mostly a form u l a-
tion known as Agent Orange, over the coun-
t ry between 1962 and 1971,dousing 1.7 mil-
lion hectares, often several times ove r. By the
end of the wa r , a fifth of South V i e t n a m ’s
forests had been chemically annihilat e d ,a n d
more than a third of its mangr ove forests we r e
d e a d . Some forests have since recove r e d , bu t
much of the land has turn e d , apparently per-
m a n e n t l y, to scrubby gr a s s l a n d .
An unwarranted experiment 
in chemical warfare
From the start there was concern that
Agent Orange was toxic to humans as well as
t r e e s. In 1964, the Fe d e r ation of A m e ri c a n
Scientists condemned Operation Ranch Hand
as an unwa rranted experiment in chemical
wa r fa r e . But the operation continued until a
s p ate of reports in 1970 and 1971 that A g e n t
Orange was causing birth defects. S o o n
research showed that 2,4,5-T, one of its two
main constituents,caused malform ations and
s t i l l b i rths in mice and contained diox i n ,a by-
product that turned out to be one of the most
poisonous substances known to science.It
d i s rupts the body’s horm o n a l , immune and
r e p r o d u c t i ve systems, and causes fat h e rs to
produce damaged sperm .
N ature has cleansed Vietnamese soils and
ve g e t ation of most of the diox i n , but the che-
mical has lingered on in human blood, fat and
breast milk.According to Le Cao Dai, d i r e c-
tor of the Agent Orange Victim Fund set up
by the Viet Nam Red Cross, the breast milk
of women in former South Vietnam who we r e
exposed to Agent Orange in childhood
contains about ten times more dioxin than
t h at of women in former North Vietnam or
i n d u s t rialized nations such as the U. S .
Appalling birth defects among the chil-
dren of veterans exposed during the war to
Agent Orange and other pesticides are we l l
d o c u m e n t e d .According to Professor Hoang
Dinh Cau, the chairman of Viet Nam’s 
10-80 Committee, which inve s t i g ates the
consequences of the use of chemicals duri n g
the wa r , tens of thousands of children are
a f f e c t e d . Common symptoms are limbs
twisted in a characteristic way or missing
a l t o g e t h e r , and eyes without pupils. A n d
n ow there is gr owing concern that a third
generation of children may be affected.
Although less well documented, I r a q i
attacks on civilian populations of Iraqi Ku r-
distan between A p ril 1987 and August 1988
h ave had equally long-term effects. In the tow n
of Halabja,bombed over three days in March
1988 with chemical and biological agents,
about 5,000 to 7,000 people were immedia-
tely killed and tens of thousands injured.T h e
first medical study of the at t a c k ’s long-term
effects was carried out by Dr Christine Gos-
d e n ,a professor of medical genetics at the Uni-
ve rsity of Live rp o o l . In a report to the UN Ins-
titute for Disarmament Research, she detailed
s e rious medical problems, including rare can-
c e rs , congenital malform ations in children,
i n f e rt i l i t y, m i s c a rri a g e s ,r e c u rrent lung infec-
tions and severe neuropsychiat ric disorders.
She noted that delayed effects such as the deve-
lopment of cancers following exposure may
occur five to ten ye a rs lat e r.
All wa rs produce environmental damage.
Some is deliberate and for direct military objec-
t i ve s.Clearly that cat e g o ry includes the defo-
l i ation of Indochina—as well as the accompa-
nying physical clearance of some 300,000
hectares of forest using heavy tractors. O t h e r
One of the many Vietnamese children affected by their parents’ exposure to Agent Orange.

d e s t ruction is equally deliberat e , but has a less
clearly military objective ,such as Saddam Hus-
s e i n ’s sabotaging of Ku waiti oil wells at the
height of the Gulf War in 1991. His forces
attacked some 730 we l l s , setting some 630
a l i g h t .M a ny continued to discharge oil into
the desert and thick black smoke into the air
for many months.The total release of oil wa s
finally estimated at 10 million cubic metres.
Some 300 oil lakes at one point covered 50
square kilometres of desert .
After Saddam threatened to set fire to the
we l l s , some scientists wa rned that the black
smoke could rise high enough into the upper
atmosphere to upset global climate systems
such as the Asian monsoon.These fears prove d
u n f o u n d e d . But the local fallout of soot,c a r-
cinogenic particles and acidic sulphur diox i d e
spread for hundreds of kilometres around the
G u l f. Ku wait City experienced “darkness at
n o o n ”comparable to the wo rst London smogs
of the early 20th century, causing a rush of
r e s p i r at o ry illnesses. It took six months and
$10 billion to stop the fires and repair the
damage to the we l l s. Some of the thick black
oil remains in hollows in the desert .
The war damaged the desert in other
way s. G r avel beds that once held the desert
sands in check were fractured by thousands
of bu n k e rs ,weapon pits and trenches.And the
tracks of tanks and trucks compacted fragi l e
soils and killed ve g e t at i o n .The Ku waiti Ins-
titute for Scientific Research concluded that
more than 900 square kilometres of desert
were damaged by military vehicles and eart h
m ove m e n t . The result has been more ero-
s i o n , sand storm s ,a d vancing sand dunes and
diminution of plant life. The war released
one million cubic metres of oil (out of the total
10) into the Pe rsian Gulf, p a rtly from Sad-
d a m ’s sabotages but much of it from the
bombing of strat e gic installations by the U. S .
and others. It severely contaminated some
400 kilometres of Ku waiti and Saudi coastline
with tar, and destroyed shrimp fis h e ri e s.S t u-
dies five ye a rs after the event revealed that
Saudi coastal ecosystems had largely reco-
ve r e d , though turtle populations nesting on
islands in the Gulf had not returned to their
f o rmer leve l s.
But much environmental damage in wa r
is unintended “ c o l l ateral damage”.The detri-
tus of munitions such as cluster bombs and
land mines are a major long-term threat 
to env i r o n m e n t s.The U. S . dropped some 1.5
million cluster bombs during the Indochina
Wa r , containing an estimated 750 million
b o m b l e t s ,according to A rthur We s t i n g, a lea-
ding historian on the environmental conse-
quences of wa r. It dropped a further 60,000,
containing some 30 million bomblets duri n g
the Gulf Wa r.They were left scattered across
the desert along with some 1.7 million mines
planted by the Iraqis. Most were cleared up
a f t e r wa r d s. But this caused further damage to
d e s e rt ecosystems as bomb disposal units plou-
ghed up large areas of the desert .
Worldwide it is estimated that there are
some 65 million functional land mines strewn
around the countryside posing a threat to
inhabitants and wildlife in 56 countries from
Angola to Nicaragua, E ritrea to Laos.A ny-
thing bigger than a rabbit is likely to set them
o f f.According to the Intern ational Commit-
tee of the Red Cross, they kill around 800
people and maim thousands more each
m o n t h . It estimates that Cambodia has 36,000
amputees as a result, and Somalia 23,000.
One of the more gruesome and unexpected
consequences of the massive flooding in sou-
t h e rn Mozambique in Fe b ru a ry this year wa s
to flo at land mines left over after the coun-
t ry ’s long civil war from known minefie l d s
into villages and fie l d s.
Refugees and deforestation
A new concern is the long-term conse-
quences of the use of depleted uranium
(DU)—a mildly radioactive and ve ry dense
m at e rial that weapon makers now put on the
tips of munitions to penetrate tank arm o u r.
About 300 tonnes of DU was dispers e d
across the bat t l e field during the Gulf Wa r.
The environmental and human health
impacts of the radioactive mat e rial left behind
by these munitions remain unclear.T h e r e
h ave been frequent claims that DU has rai-
sed cancer rates in southern Iraq and caused
Iraqi soldiers exposed to it to father seve r e l y
d e f o rmed babies. But so far no studies have
c o n firmed this link.
The social dislocation caused by war is a
f u rther cause of environmental damage.
Floods of refugees in particular can threat e n
n atural resources such as water and forests.
The Rwandan conflict and the events that it
t riggered in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC,ex-Zaire)became a major cause
of deforestation in central A f ri c a .One casualty
was A f ri c a ’s first national park, the V i ru n g a
N ational Pa r k , on the border between the
DRC and Rwa n d a .The World Conservat i o n
Union (IU C N) reported that in six months, t h e
R wandan refugees and Hutu soldiers from
camps around the town of Goma in the DRC
had deforested some 300 square kilometres
of V i runga National Park in their search for
food and wo o d .At the height of the cri s i s ,t h e
IU C N e s t i m ated that some 850,000 refugees
were living within or close to the park and took
b e t ween 410 and 770 tonnes of forest pro-
ducts out of the park daily. In the confusion,
Z a i rian soldiers were raiding the park for tim-
ber to sell to refugees and relief organizat i o n s.
Similar destruction became a feature of
civil and cross-border conflicts across much
of A f rica in the 1990s. In March this ye a r ,
the UN Environment Programme report e d
on the “ t r a n s f o rm ation of natural land and
forest areas” with “ s e vere impacts on bio-
d i ve rsity and water systems” in southern
Rwandan refugees in ex-Zaire have deforested areas in their search for food and firewood.
Worldwide it is estimated that
there are some 65 million
functional land mines strew n
around the countryside posing a
threat to inhabitants and wildlife
in 56 countries from Angola to
N i ca ragua, Eritrea to Laos.

G u i n e a , f o l l owing the influx of some
600,000 refugees from recent conflicts in
n e i g h b o u ring Sierra Leone and Liberi a .
Most of the refugees had hacked out forest
to grow crops for food.
G u e rrilla armies do as much damage as
r e f u g e e s ,p a rticularly when they have to live
off the land or generate income to buy arm s
from the plundering of natural resources in
the region where they are fig h t i n g .A rmies also
h ave to eat , and for guerrilla armies “ bu s h-
m e at ” is a frequent source of food. G u e rri l l a
wa rs in Cambodia and west and central A f ri c a
h ave been sustained during the past decade
through the cutting and sale of valuable hard-
wood timbers.Wildlife suffers too.In the Horn
of A f rica in the 1980s,Somali war bands we r e
frequently behind the rampant poaching of
elephants for their ivo ry.War in Uganda in
1979 killed off much of the country ’s bu s h
elephant populat i o n , and conflicts in A n g o l a
and Mozambique have since caused the who-
lesale slaughter of elephants in those coun-
t ries too.The Rwanda conflict and succee-
ding guerrilla activity in the surr o u n d i n g
r e gions through the 1990s saw the slaughter of
mountain gorillas in V i runga and elsewhere—
a fact that understandably gained little at t e n-
tion beside the massive slaughter of humans.
Silence on Chechnya
War and the environment have , of cours e ,
a lways been linked. Some of the earliest
b attles between city states in Mesopotamia
5,000 ye a rs ago invo l ved the breaking of
dykes to flood fa rm l a n d . But the Indochina
War was the first time scientists seriously pro-
bed the effect of a major confli c t .The Gulf
War was perhaps the first time those conse-
quences were seriously addressed before they
h a p p e n e d , with experts (erroneously) fore-
casting a global climate change if fire was set
to the oil we l l s. D u ring the Kosovo confli c t ,
the environmental consequences of the bom-
bing of fa c t o ries gained precedence in much
r e p o rting over the intended economic 
d a m a g e .There can be little doubt that the
e nvironmental impacts of Russian military
activity in Chechnya and Afghanistan has
been as severe as that of the U. S . and its allies
in southeast A s i a , the Gulf and elsewhere.
But far less is known as independent inve s-
t i g ations have been notable only by their
a b s e n c e . In Chechnya , the seve rity of the mili-
t a ry battles and the physical destruction of
G r o z ny has been so gr e at that likely env i-
ronmental damage such as pollution of wat e r
s u p p l i e s , though of undoubtedly long-term
i m p o rtance for rebu i l d i n g, has to date barely
been remarked upon. The continuing
c o n flicts in Afghanistan have made indepen-
dent assessment of the impacts of 20 ye a rs
of war there hard to purs u e . ■
