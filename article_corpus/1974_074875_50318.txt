ibn Ahmad al-Biruni, the great Central
Asian scholar, is one of those
intellectual giants whose stature
continues to grow as we become more
fully acquainted with their legacy.
One hundred years ago, when al-
Biruni's Chronology of Ancient Nations
was published in Russian, only one
facet of his many talents was apparent,
that of an outstanding medieval his¬
torian. But as more of his works were
discovered treatises on mathematics,
geography and astronomy and the
more deeply they were studied, the
higher al-Biruni stood out above the
mass of his contemporaries.
Al-Biruni was so far ahead of his
time that his most brilliant discoveries
seemed incomprehensible to most of
the scholars of his day. He was the
first to arrive at an amazingly simple
formula for measuring the earth's

Al-Biruni is claimed as a
son of many countries, but
as a universal scholar and
scientist he belongs to all
nations and every age.

circumference. He thought It possible
that the earth revolved around the sun.
He developed the idea that geological
eras succeed one another in cycles.
"With the passing of time, the sea
becomes dry land, and dry land the
sea," he wrote, and on this brilliant
hypothesis he based his theory of the
earth's geological history.
What enabled al-Biruni to move so
far ahead of his contemporaries and to
create works that made his name
known in the East as a symbol of
learning of the 11th century?
Khwarizm, in Central Asia, where
al-Biruni was born and grew up, had
long been famed for its advanced
culture. Its cities had magnificent
palaces, mosques and madrasahs
(religious colleges), and in this pros¬
perous, ancient state the sciences were
esteemed and highly developed.
The 10th and 11th centuries saw
the decline of the Arab caliphate in
Baghdad. New states arose on its
ruins, and a pleiad of illustrious Central
Asian scholars appeared, including
Abu-Nasr al-Farabi and ibn-Sina (Avi¬
cenna).
It was during this period that al-
Biruni was born near Kath, the capital
of Khwarizm, on 4 September, in the
year 973. "In truth, I am not certain
of my genealogy, for I do not really
know who my grandfather was. And
how could I know who my grandfather
was, when I do not even know who
was my father?" he wrote in a poem
which appears in one of his treatises.
In his early youth, fortune brought
him in contact with an educated Greek
who was to become his first teacher.
At the Greek's request, the young
al-Biruni collected plants, seeds and
fruit and this kindled his interest in the
natural sciences.
Al-Biruni's foster father was Abu-
Nasr Mansur ibn-Ali ibn Iraq, or simply
Mansur, a member of the Khwarizmian
royal family and a distinguished math¬
ematician and astronomer. He intro¬
duced al-Biruni to Euclidean geometry
and Ptolemaean astronomy, which
equipped the young scholar to study
astronomy.
"Most of my days were blessed by
gifts and privileges which were in¬
creasingly bestowed on me," wrote
al-Biruni, describing this period of his
life. "The Iraq family nourished me
with their milk and their Mansur took
it upon himself to rear me."
Al-Biruni studied the stars and
minerals, probed the secrets of the
heavens and the earth and read
thousands of books in order to fathom
the meaning of history. He constructed
a globe of the earth the first in
Central Asia and was equally gifted

as a poet. He lived through the
feverish final years of the powerful
Samanid dynasty and witnessed the
rise and fall of two early feudal
empires the Karakhanid and the
Ghaznavid.
Social conflicts, feudal wars and
barbarian invasions left their imprint
on his manuscripts, since science does
not exist in a vacuum, least of all the
science of history. It might well have
been the violent social upheavals in
Khwarizm that suggested the theme of
his first major work, in which he
turned to the past for an understanding
of how society was evolving.
Al-Biruni completed his Chronology
of Ancient Nations at the age of 27,
just before the 11th century was born.
"My aim in this book," he explained,
"was to establish as accurately as poss¬
ible the time span of various eras."
His study begins at the dawn of the
human race, moves on to the period
of the great flood, and covers every
thing then known about the times of
Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the
Great.
The book explains various calendar
systems such as the Arabian, Greek
and Persian. The history of rulers,
heroes and political events is inter¬
woven with the history of culture,
customs and morals. The Chronology
of Ancient Nations should not be
considered as a purely historical work,
but as a partly historical and partly
ethnographic study that retains its full
significance to this day.
Soviet scholars of the 1930s referred
to the Chronology again and again in
their research on ancient Central Asia.
Only in al-Biruni's work could they find
an account of the Soghdian calendar,
essential to their study of early
8th century Soghdian documents; only
here could they find information about
pre-Muslim Khwarizm, which archae¬
ologists were just beginning to study.
Al-Biruni was no ivory tower scholar.
He met and came to know people in
many different walks of life and
maintained close contacts with his
fellow scholars. We know from letters
written by al-Biruni in Khwarizm, in the
year 997, to the 17 year-old Avicenna
in Bokhara, that these young scholars
discussed Aristotle's Physics and On
the Heavens, as well as the structure
of the universe, the physical laws
covering a free-falling object and in¬
divisible particles (atoms). Al-Biruni
devoted his work, Questions and Ans¬
wers to these exchanges (see article
page 27).
Al-Biruni's letters reveal a deep
respect for the ancient Greek philos¬
ophers and show him to be already a
mature man of science, despite his
youth. In the year 1010, he was ad¬
mitted to the Academy of al-Mamun,
which embraced a group of famous
scholars, including the philosopher and
natural scientist Avicenna, the historian
and philosopher ¡bn-Maskawayh and
the mathematician abu-Nasr Arrah.

Al-Biruni was born near the town of Kath, north-east of the ancient city of Khiva. Kath has vanished from the
map, but Khiva (today in Uzbekistan) still boasts palaces, religious colleges, mosques and burial monuments
that testify to the talent of its medieval architects and craftsmen. Shown here are two buildings in Khiva
today: the Baths of Anusha-khan (opposite) and the mausoleum of Pahlawan Mahmud (above) whose great
dome covered with blue tiles dominates the city.
Whereas European natural science
was in a state of stagnation at that
time, scholars in Khwarizm were
vigorously advancing along the path
traced by scientists of antiquity.
Khwarizm's economic growth during
the early feudal period had set the
stage for a golden age of science in
the early 11th century.
Commerce with northern peoples
the Khazars and Bulgars, the ancient
Russians, and the tribes of the Urals
and Western Siberia also influenced
scientific advancement. Learning
flourished in this fertile soil, with its
traditions of a thousand year-old
independent culture, combining the
"wisdom of neighbouring India with the
perfect lucidity of far-off Hellas."
Al-Biruni's frequent references to
Greek philosophy and scientific thought
demonstrate the encyclopedic scope of
his interests. He was familiar with
Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and had
studied Plato's treatises, Laws and
Phaedo. He was well acquainted with
the works of Aristotle, Archimedes and
Democritus, and extolled what he con¬
sidered the best of Greek philosophy.
The 11th century was a time of great
turmoil. The armed hosts of Mahmud
of Ghazna overran Khwarizm, in 1017,
taking thousands of prisoners, in¬
cluding al-Biruni. The decade which
followed was to be the most difficult
period in the scholar's life, but at the
same time his most productive. He
studied astronomy, collected materials
for a mathematics treatise, sought to
comprehend the influence of the moon
on the tides, and conceived his major
work on India, which represents the
zenith of his scientific thinking.
Arabic and Persian literature prior
to al-Biruni's time had depicted India
as a land of wonders. The Indians
were knowledgeable in astronomy and
arithmetic; they were said to have
invented chess, which in al-Biruni's
time was already considered an
intellectual game; they were ac¬
complished sculptors and poets; their
doctors were highly reputed, and it
was even affirmed that the science of
philosophy had originated In India.
In Ghazna, al-Biruni became ac¬
quainted with Indian scholars who, like
him, were exiled from their homeland.
His meetings and conversations with
them sparked his Interest in their
remarkable country. For a period of
12 years, up to the year 1030, al-Biruni
was totally absorbed in India.
Many people before al-Biruni had
travelled to India, especially to Sind
and its southern coast, and some
books that could serve historians as
a guide to studying the country had
been written. Al-Biruni's monumental
work on India, however, clearly
demonstrated a scientific, that is, ob¬
jective, approach to the subject. At
the age of 45, he began learning Sans¬
krit. He visited India several times,
walked on its soil, breathed its air,
compared and marvelled.

AL-BIRUNI (Continued)
A true scientist, al-Biruni strove to
share knowledge as well as to obtain
it. He translated Euclid's Elements
and his own treatise on astronomy into
Sanskrit. He also began a translation
of the Panchatantra into Arabic, as he
considered the existing translation of
this immortal literary classic to be in¬
adequate.
Al-Biruni's India became the major
source for studying 11th century India.
It covered the caste system, philos¬
ophy, the exact sciences, religion, laws,
customs, superstitions, legends, the
system of weights and measures, the
written language and geography. In
writing it, al-Biruni quoted 24 works by

14 Greek writers and used 40 Sanskrit
sources. He was an objective re¬
searcher, free of racial bias, with a
deep respect for the advanced culture
of another people.
During the reign of Mas'ud, who
succeeded his father, Mahmud, as
Ghaznavid ruler, al-Biruni's situation
improved. The new king was an
enlightened man who encouraged the
sciences. Al-Biruni dedicated his
major work on astronomy, The Mas'udic
Canon, to him. In the opinion of al-
Biruni's contemporaries and suc¬
cessors, he surpassed his ancient
mentor, Ptolemy, in this work.

scholar an elephant loaded with pure
silver, al-Biruni replied: "This gift
would seduce me from science. Wise
men know that silver is soon spent but
science lives on. I would never
exchange the perennial wealth of
scientific knowledge for the short-lived
tawdry glitter of silver."
Al-Biruni's main interests were math¬
ematics, astronomy, geography, physics
and geodesy but in his last work, the
Pharmacology, he classified the physi¬
cal features of plants, animals and
minerals, and compiled an alphabetical
list of medicinal herbs and their uses.
Besides Arabic names, al-Biruni
listed about 900 Persian, 700 Greek,
400 Syrian and 350 Indian names in
the Pharmacology. He referred to
Aristotle's works on biology, and also
to the writings of Dioscorides and
Galen, physicians and pharmacologists
of the 1st and 2nd centuries. Un¬
fortunately, the Pharmacology was not
completed, but even in the form it has
come down to us its values is self-
evident.
Al-Biruni's contemporaries spoke of
him thus: "Except for two festive
days each year, his hand never stopped
writing, his eyes observing, his mind
contemplating." When he died in 1048,
at the age of 75, more than 150 works
had flowed from his pen. They
include 70 on astronomy, 20 on math¬
ematics and 18 on literature, including
translations, and bibliographies. He
was famed as a cartographer, meteor¬
ologist, physicist, philosopher, historian
and ethnographer.
Only 27 of his works have come
down to us. Whether the rest were
destroyed or simply have not been
found is not known. Abu'l Faraj, the
Syrian historian and physician, wrote
of al-Biruni, the man he regarded as
his mentor: "His works gre numerous,
exhaustive and completely reliable.
There was no one, neither among his
colleagues, nor to this day, so well
versed in astronomy, from its main
principles down to the smallest
details."
Al-Biruni had a vast impact on
science in the East. Many countries
claim him as their own, but this son
of Khwarizm, one of Central Asia's
most brilliant civilizations, belongs to
all nations and to all time.

Chess was first played in
Asia and many authorities
agree that it originated in
India. In al-Biruni's day it
was already a popular game
in Central Asia, and he may
himself have handled pieces
like the ones shown here of
carved ivory (4 cm. high),
dating from the time when he
lived. They were unearthed
near the village of Kurban-
Sheid, in Tajikstan, in a region
once part of the Ghaznavid
Empire, in which al-Biruni
lived for many years.- Above,
