M ex i c o ’s
m e rcenary legacy
For decades the Mexican media was paid to do the government’s bidding. But what future lies in
store for the press after last year’s defeat of the all-powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (the
PRI) and the electoral victory of President Vicente Fox?
n New Ye a r ’s Day 1994, the world was
astonished by the sight of a hooded
guerrilla fighter giving a televised press
conference in the main square of the
Mexican town of San Cristóbal de las
C a s a s. Sub-comandante Marcos, t h e
flamboyant leader of the Zapatista
National Liberation A r m y, had decided to
exploit the media as part of his movement’s
s t r a t e g y. His first goal was achieved: in the
smokey aftermath of New Ye a r
c e l e b r a t i o n s, the Mexican people awoke to
find a war on their home turf and an abrupt
end to the modernizing dream of the then
president,Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
The media embraced the Zapatista war
as they might an unexpected lover. They
longed to be witnesses and players in the
fighting around the mountainous state of
Chiapas—and they got what they wanted.
The 10 days that shook Mexico were
covered fully and freely by the country’s
m e d i a . Editors and reporters basked in
the freedom and independence they had
previously forsaken, learning a lesson that
only a few of them had absorbed up to
that point—press freedom could be good
business. As a result, part of the Mexican
press discovered a liberty and an influ e n c e
it has clung to ever since.
The Untouchable and 
the Invincible 
But what was the press like before the
year when Mexicans lived in danger? In
1 9 6 8 , during the big student
demonstrations that led to the infamous
October 2 massacre in Mexico City’s
Tlaltelolco Square [in which at least 500
people are believed to have died],the cry
of “prensa vendida! ” [mercenary press]
rang out through the city streets,
encapsulating the fury people felt for the
largely corrupt press.The PRI—nicknamed
“The Invincible”for having by fair means
or foul won every election since it was
founded in 1929 as the National
Revolutionary Party—thrust its roots deep
into a rotten ground that spawned, a m o n g
other things, a docile press.
To start with, the government
controlled all supplies of newsprint.
Newspapers were allowed to pay for it
later, and in some cases were never asked
to pay at all. The same went for their
employees’ social security contributions.
Some companies were exempted from
t a x e s. Most newspapers and magazines
depended on advertising from the state.
Politicians and public officials bribed
journalists and editors as a matter of
r o u t i n e, handing over so much cash (called
e m b u t e s or ch ay o t e s in the journalistic
argot) that many depended more on these
payments than on their own salaries.As for
news, the press—with a few exceptions—
simply fed at the trough of information
that the government had decided to make
public.
The slavishness of the media was
especially visible in its attitude to the
president of the day. Under the Mexican
s y s t e m , the president had an almost divine
s t a t u s.As owner of the country’s destiny,h e

was also regarded as master of its citizens’
s o u l s. He was the Untouchable. Th o u g h
guaranteed in the national constitution,
the freedom of the press was nevertheless
treated by editors as a gift from this
benevolent president, and thus an object
for the deepest gratitude.
Exceptions to this miserable state of
affairs played key roles in determining the
later evolution of the press. In 1968, Julio
Scherer García took over E x c é l s i o r,one of
the country’s biggest newspapers.He soon
turned it into the most influential one, a n d
it became recognized as one of the world’s
10 best newspapers. Faced with its
systematic criticism and attacks, t h e
tyrannical government reacted in the
manner it knew best. In 1976, t h e
government of Luis Echeverria organized
and funded a palace coup inside the paper,
and Scherer García was forced out.
He and a team of reporters then
founded the
weekly magazine
P r o c e s o, which has
been the bastion
o f the oppostion
press ever since it
first appeared on
November 6,1976.
Following its ex-
a m p l e, s o m e
sectors of the
traditional press
made timid
attempts over t h e
next 20 years to break their bad habit of
depending on the government. N e w
papers sprang up, with different aims and
s t r a t e g i e s, but in general the corrupt rules
of the game were preserved until Ja n u a r y
1 ,1 9 9 4 , the day President Salinas launched
what he saw as the glittering triumph for
his economic policy:the North American
Free Trade Association (NA F TA )
between Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
From then on, criticism of the
government became routine. Th e
monolithic political system began to show
cracks which some of the media ventured
into, more often drawn by instinct than a
high degree of professionalism and
responsibility. Ernesto Zedillo, who took
over from Salinas de Gortari, could not
and did not want to curb the mounting
backlash against the PRI system. E i t h e r
through indifference or scorn, the press
was let off the leash.
Many papers were confused. Th e y
d i d n ’t want to stop acting like poodles, b u t
they sensed that a change of master was
i m m i n e n t . By the time of the 2000
presidential elections, an unfettered press
was in place. The leading candidates were
the PRI’s Francisco Labastida and a rising
political star called Vicente Fox,officially
standing for the right-wing National A c t i o n
Party, but who was launched into the race
by a solid group of independent
b u s i n e s s p e o p l e, marketing experts and
some social organizations unconnected to
political party machines.
In fact,Mexicans were ready to dump
the PRI, and on July 2, 2 0 0 0 , Fox beat
Labastida by a landslide;71 years of history
ended without a hint of violence. But did a
period of transition then begin? Perhaps,
but perhaps not.The more sceptical argue
that Fox is not the statesman needed to
preside over a
genuine national
t r a n s i t i o n . O t h e r s
rightly note that the
keystones of
M e x i c o ’s oligarchic
power structure are
still untouched.
Whatever the truth
of the matter, t h e
press has played a
major part in the
political change. I t
helped demystify
the regime and above all show that the
president was no longer the Untouchable,
and the PRI no longer the Invincible.
So what comes next? In its special issue
on Fo x ’s election, P r o c e s o summed up the
challenge now facing the country and the
press. The cover shows supporters of Fox
carrying a coffin painted in the PRI’s
colours with the words “And now what?”
written above it.
A year later, the question remains.Th e
Mexican press is operating in an ill-defin e d
c o n t e x t .It has replaced its old docility with
persistent opposition,helped bring about
the change in power and is now wondering
what side of the fence it can or should be
on—criticizing the new government or
generously giving it the benefit of the
doubt.
Is the press truly ready to be part of a
genuine transition? I am not optimistic.
Mexico has a high birth rate as far as the
press is concerned—every week a new
publication seems to hit the streets—but
there are very few readers.After last year’s
election fever, with unemployment now
on the rise and purchasing power in
d e c l i n e, readers are drifting away.Wi t h o u t
state subsidies, small or family-owned
papers and those stuck to the ways of the
past are disappearing.
The challenge is how to adapt to the
new situation. In Fo x ’s pragmatic world
there is only room for the strongest and, i t
would appear, for the business-minded. I n
M e x i c o, the information industry could
well draw foreign investors, especially now
that the doors of our economy are not just
open but have disappeared altogether.
It remains to be seen how much press
criticism Fox’s government,which is itself
a child of the opposition, is prepared to
t o l e r a t e. New governments tend to be over-
sensitive toward the press.We shall have to
wait and see. ■
