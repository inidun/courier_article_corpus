The search for a thinking computer
As part of an unparalleled long-term re¬
search and development effort, computer
scientists in a number of countries are
today trying to bridge the gap between the
limited computer intelligence that exists
now and something approaching human
capacities. One of many obstacles in this
search for a machine as intelligent as man
lies in the limitations of conventional com¬
puters which perform their operations one
step at a time. The search for a solution to
this problem has led to the development of
"parallel processing" systems which
operate on thousands of data elements at
once. In the computershown above tens of
thousands of processors co-operate on
the processing of a single task.
WITH few exceptions, all present com¬
puters are von Neumann compu¬
ters, so called after John von Neu¬
mann, one of the scientists whose work was
seminal in creating and developing these
machines. The von Neumann computer is
characterized by data and programs that are
stored together (stored program) and pro¬
grams that are executed sequentially
(sequential control). In the von Neumann
computer, everything to be done must be
defined In advance in the form of procedure.
The program describes procedures in a lan¬
guage the computer can understand. In the
program, the procedure is called an algorithm.
This system presents no problems for numeri¬
cal computation and routine clerical process¬
ing, since procedures can be pre-defined for
this kind of work.
However, most activity requiring human
intelligence is characterized by the need to
accommodate strategies flexibly to the
demands and complexity of a particular situa¬
tion. Using the example of language, which is
the basis of intelligent activity, the meaning of
a word may vary with the situation In which It is
used. The meaning of a word also changes in
relation to surrounding words. The meaning of
a sentence also depends on the object of the
sentence and circumstances of use.
Consequently, when one tries to write a
program to analyse the meaning of a word in a
sentence, all cases in which the word can be
used must be considered. However, the num¬
ber of cases will be colossal, and even if all
cases could ever be listed the program would
never be completed in a reasonable time. In
other words, such a program would have very
16

little practical value because of the excessive
processing time.
It is clear that computers must perform intel¬
ligently and flexibly in the applications
required by the society of the 1990s. The
problem is how to develop a computer with
this capability. A first approximation to solving
this problem can be found in artificial intel¬
ligence research. But because of the limita¬
tions described, the results of artificial intel¬
ligence research cannot be put into practical
use with existing computers.
Stated simply, the goal of artificial intel¬
ligence research is that computers should
perform in an identical or similar manner to
human intelligence.
This research takes two approaches: one
models the mechanism of human intelligence;
the other attempts to achieve human intel¬
ligence in the computer by processes that are
not necessarily the same as actual human
intelligence, the emphasis being on the result.
Major themes of current research in artificial
intelligence are:
1) Proofof theorems. Conclusions are made
based upon axioms and inference rules. The
computer can be an aid in proving theorems,
but this field has not developed to the point
where computers can automatically prove
theorems that human beings cannot.
2) Games. Studies aim at methods of choos¬
ing the best move in all game situations and
strategies for winning the game. This field has
developed a number of methods of finding the
best of all possible moves and thus has
helped to solve problems.
3) Robots. Research and development in this
area is mainly aimed at controlling manipula¬
tors to perform skilful work, developing sen¬
sors, and developing high-level languages to
describe work environments and commands.
4) Vision understanding. The aim here is to
make it possible for computers to recognize
faces, scenes, photographs, etc. A variety of
¡mage analysis methods have been
developed. As a result, computers can now
recognize complicated scenes on condition
that knowledge on the subject be input pre¬
viously. However, a general method of coping
with a wide range of objects has not yet been
developed.
5) Natural-language understanding and
voice recognition. How to make computers
understand sentences and speech in natural
language, e.g., in Japanese, English or
French, is the focus of this field of study. There
are already some experimental systems that
can understand English or Japanese when
objects are limited. However, as the number
of objects increases, the number of words and
sentences required increases even more,
necessitating common sense and inference
rules. Thus, much further study is required.
6) Knowledge engineering. Research in this
area aims at storing experts' knowledge and
automatically finding the answer to a given
problem. The system used for this purpose is
called an expert system (see box page 14).
Efforts have been made to apply this to medi¬
cal treatment, machine design/maintenance/
repair, and education.
What are known as "fifth generation" sys¬
tems are being designed to overcome the
shortcomings of the present-day computer.1
In particular, research is concentrated on
knowledge information processing.
Computers of the past and present genera¬
tions have simple hardware architecture and
implement complex functions through soft¬
ware. In 1 982, the Japanese Ministry for Inter¬
national Trade and Industry initiated a project
to develop computers capable of forming the
basis of an advanced information society in
the 1 990s. In this project, it was decided to use
technologies that are essentially different
from those of the past.
In other words, the ultimate form of fifth
generation computer should be oriented to
knowledge information processing and
achieved on the basis of revolutionary theo¬
ries and technologies. The fifth generation
computer is a knowledge information pro¬
cessing system that, overcoming the tech¬
nical limitations of conventional computers,
implements the intelligent conversation and
knowledge base inference functions required
in the 1990s. Its applications are expected to
be more extensive than those of conventional
computers.
The four basic functions the fifth generation
computer must achieve are:
1) Problem solving and inference func¬
tions. Logical deductive inference and induc¬
tive inference to solve a given problem, includ¬
ing guesses based on incomplete knowledge.
2) Knowledge base management func¬
tions. Acquisition, storage, and utilization of
various kinds of knowledge required in the
inference process.
3) Intelligent interface functions. External
interfaces that use natural language (sen-

In the widening field of artificial intel¬
ligence, computers are being asked to
solve an array of real-life problems rang¬
ing from the diagnosis of illness and the
prescription of treatment, to exploration
for minerals. "Expert systems" are pro¬
grams which help the computer to mimic
the behaviour of human experts when
tackling these problems. The questions
and answers below are part of a computer
dialogue between a tomato-grower and
"TOM", an expert system In plant patholo¬
gy developed by Alain Bonnet, a French
specialist in artificial intelligence, and
Dominique Blancard, a researcher In plant
pathology.
TOM: Age of plant?
User: Adult.
TOM: What variety?
User: Vemone. ...
TOM: Have you noticed yellowing, withering or drying of the
leaves (not to be confused with spots on the leaves)? Generally,
this yellowing affects the lower parts of the plant, and only affects
a few plants at first.
User: No. ...
TOM: Have light brown or greyish spongy galls been observed on
the roots, concentrated at soil level?
User: Yes.
TOM: Are these symptoms by any chance more noticeable In the
wettest parts of the plot?
User: No.
TOM then gave "his" diagnosis of possible diseases.

Hands that "see"
Advanced computer technology has made it possible to endow
robots with "sight", a sense of touch, and in some cases the
ability to respond to voice commands and make basic decisions
about the situations they encounter. Photo above shows "Maga¬
li", an apple-picking robot developed in France. Artificial vision is
an essential component in Magali, whose arm is guided to the
fruit by a television camera associated with a microcomputer. In
robot vision systems a computer analyses an ¡mage, converted
into digital form, fed into it from a television camera and directs
the robot to perform a specific task when it "detects" certain
features that have been programmed into its memory. Below, a
computer-controlled hand developed at the Massachusetts Insti¬
tute of Technology (MIT). The hand is capable of picking up an
egg without breaking it. Each finger can make 40 movements a
second. Covered with a plastic skin equipped with sensors, the
hand can "recognize" different materials such as metal, plastic
and wood, and instantaneously measure the temperature of ob¬
jects that it touches.

tence, voice), graphics, and images, and can
converse naturally.
4) Intelligent programming functions.
Functions to automatically convert a given
problem to efficient computer programs.
To achieve these functions, various tech¬
nologies of hardware architecture, software
engineering, and artificial intelligence are
being studied and developed.
The first task for achieving knowledge infor¬
mation processing and fifth generation com¬
puters is the selection of the programming
language best suited to describe intelligent
activity by the computer. To select the lan¬
guage, it is necessary to understand the fun¬
damental mechanism of the intelligent activity
to be described. It should be noted that the
present computer is a machine developed to
model the fundamental mechanism of numeri¬
cal computation: that is, the four rules of
arithmetic.
In fifth generation computer systems, logic,
in particular predicate logic, was selected as
the principle of intelligent activity. Logic is gen¬
erally regarded as the universal rule of
thought. Of numerous types of logic, predicate
logic is most closely related to our daily lan¬
guage. This means that anyone can handle
predicate logic, although it may seem difficult
at first because of its rigour.
Of course, predicate logic alone cannot
account for all intelligent activities; it is cer¬
tainly, however, the most powerful logic for
description.
The basic mechanism of logic is inference.
Inference is a rigorous procedure for acquiring
unknown information using known informa¬
tion and knowledge. Inference plays a central
role in our understanding of meaning, whether
or not we are conscious of its use. The basis of
intelligent activity is to possess knowledge
and make inferences.
Inference is made according to inference
rules. The most fundamental inference rule is
the syllogism. A syllogism is a form of reason¬
ing as follows: A is B; B is C; therefore, A is C.
One method of having the computer make
inferences automatically is to incorporate this
inference rule in the hardware, and this is the
approach of the project on fifth generation
computer systems.
The method of describing a program log¬
ically and executing it by inference is called
logic programming. Predicate logic programs
allow parallel processing, which resembles
the process of obtaining unknown quantities
in a system of simultaneous linear equations
concurrently. One objective of the fifth gener¬
ation computer systems project is to achieve
parallel processing directly by hardware. In
other words, the project aims at developing
computers that can perform symbol-crunch¬
ing computation at high speed. For this rea¬
son, the final form of the fifth generation com¬
puter will be a parallel inference machine
consisting of a number of element processors.
The research and development of fifth gen¬
eration computer systems involves many
unknown factors and great risks. For this rea¬
son, the research and development period
spans ten years and is divided into three
stages three years for the initial stage, four
years for the intermediate, and three years for
the final stage.
Fifth generation computer systems could
be applied to any area that requires problem
solving and inference functions.
To take the example of medical treatment,
countless applications can be listed: auto¬
matic nursing systems monitoring serious
cases through the night and giving treatment
support when the patient's condition changes
suddenly; systems to help analyse X-ray films
or tomograms and diagnose the area for treat¬
ment; systems to help determine the name of
the illness or prescribe medicine based on
various check data; systems to devise duty
schedules for nurses and systems to decide
menus. When studies in natural-language
understanding advance further and machine
translation at higher levels becomes possible,
or when people place international calls to
speakers of another language, both parties
may be able to speak in their own tongue. In
education, more effective educational sys¬
tems can be expected, in which one will be
able to judge the optimum way- of giving
instructions to each individual. Present com¬
puter aided instruction (CAI) systems cannot
do this.
Needless to say, these applications will
occur not only through the achievements of
research on fifth generation computer sys¬
tems but also through research In artificial
intelligence that makes clear the models and
mechanisms of intelligent functions. Thus,
continued research Is very important.
The goal of the fifth generation computer
systems project is to create a knowledge infor¬
mation processing system that can help peo¬
ple solve problems in their exploration of the
unknown, and significantly extend the scope
of their Intellectual activity. This will have
an immeasurable impact on industry and
society.
