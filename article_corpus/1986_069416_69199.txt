The image
and the word
by Alberto Moravia
<J>
v
FEW persons appear to have given
much thought to the fact that the
image owes its success to the entry
into history's arena of large masses of
humanity, including their new literates and
total illiterates.
The illiterate person undeniably has a
distinctive visual awareness. For him the
whole world is a vast system of visual signs
and symbols waiting to be interpreted and
translated.
So in the first place, what we are dealing
with is not so much a decline of the book as a
triumph of the image, a triumph due in far
smaller measure to those who have always
been readers than to those who only yester¬
day did not know how to read.
If this is so, as I myself believe, we can
expect at any time to see a sfeady decline in
the influence of the image and a corres¬
ponding resurgence of the book. In other
words, as millions upon millions of illiterate
men and women learn to read and write,
they are likely to abandon the primitive,
direct language of the image in favour of the
more elaborate, more indirect language of
the printed word.
That this hypothesis is plausible is borne
out by the huge circulation of paperbacks.
The paperback scatters the seeds of the
culture of all ages and all regions wholesale
upon completely virgin soil. In the space of
a few years, the entire population of our
planet, only now barely emerging from
illiteracy, has been inundated, without any
preparation, with the culture of thirty
centuries.
The danger is that this culture will not be
assimilated, but thrown together, con¬
densed and reduced to mere formulas and
synthetic aggregation in a vast grinding op¬
eration of destruction. After which the
masses would apparently be free to revert
to the image, thenceforward the sole
medium of communication.
Besides, the image itself has recently
appeared to be reaching its limits. The fact
that the spectator takes in the picture pas¬
sively, without any attempt at interpreta¬
tion, ultimately results in the picture itself
losing its full force and becoming a victim of
this passivity.
The decline of the book is by no manner
of means, then, a certainty. Even if we
ignore the fundamental fact that the book
springs from nature, that is from the faculty
natural to all human beings to utter words
and shape them into organized speech, we
should not overlook the fact that the book is
made up of words which are "also", under
certain conditions of poetic creativity, im¬
ages. Thus there is no substantial difference
between the image suggested by the book
and the image that appears on the screen. In
fact there is only one difference, though an
important one: the image on the screen
allows for no play of imagination; it is what
it is.
Nevertheless, we must distinguish be¬
tween one type of reading and another type
of reading, between one book and another
book. Reading some books is no more than
a simple physical exercise. For a book to be
properly "read" it must first be really
"written".
A book, then, must be thought out and
created or it is not a book. Indeed, the
future of the book is bound up with the
poetry, creativeness, descriptive power and
imagery of the writing. The future of the
book will be assured if we succeed in
"writing" books; it will perish if we content
ourselves with merely printing them.

ALBERTO MORAVIA, Italian writer, is one of the
great names of contemporary world literature.
He has published some 15 novels, from Gli
Indiferenti (1929, The Time of Indifference) to
1 934 (1982) as well as volumes of short stories,
five plays and many articles on social and politi¬
cal subjects.
It will take until the year 2000 for the pre¬
cious book collections of the libraries of
Florence, ravaged by the floods of 1966, to
be fully restored. Right, a cleaning and
drying centre set up in a former tobacco-
curing shop.
