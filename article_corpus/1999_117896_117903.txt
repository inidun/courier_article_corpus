At the Judicial Training Centre in Bishkek, a
staff member slips a C D-Rom into a compu-
ter,calls up all the legislation passed in Kyr-
gyzstan since last August and scrolls down several
screens of amendments and law s. Such readily ava i-
lable inform ation and technology are rare in this
cash-strapped nation of 4.7 million inhabitants that
has built its reputation since independence in 1991
on the boldness of its democratic reforms, to such
an extent that it can be hard for the judicial profes-
sion to keep up.
In a district court of the capital, there are no
such modern installat i o n s. The walls here are in
dire need of repainting, a bare lightbulb hangs ove r
an uncluttered desk staffed by two clerks, a manual
t y p e w riter sits atop a large locker, and a hard bench
is propped in a corridor leading to the judge’s offic e .
I n s i d e , there is no sign of being in a state body—no
official portrait, no flag, no emblem or uniformed
officials.
The case underway involves a private bank,the
n ational securities commission and a newspaper,
none of which has a lawyer.The bank is suing the
securities commission for defamation after the lat-
ter accused it of providing false inform ation and
publicized the affair in the press. Into the fif t h
h e a ri n g, the case, one of the more complex ones
heard by this judge, e xe m p l i fies an all too common
problem.“The main difficulty is applying the new
l aw s ,” she say s.“Sometimes there are many contra-
dictions within the law, which makes our task very
difficult, especially given the number of new laws
adopted in the last two years.”
Her struggle echoes that of many of the coun-
try’s 300-odd judges trying to come to grips with
new laws and codes (including a civil, tax code and
c riminal code) gove rning entirely novel fields of
e x p e rt i s e : leasing and selling bu i l d i n g s ,f r a n c h i s i n g,
p r o p e rty ri g h t s ,p ri vate bu s i n e s s ,b a n k ru p t cy, b a n-
k i n g, customs and organized cri m e . And there is
more to come:the family code is being revised and
the final touches have just been put on a new elec-
toral code, which will be put to the test this fa l l .
This intense activity is a far cry from the days when
new laws were passed down from Moscow and the
judicial system was under the helm of the commu-
nist part y. N ow judges and law ye rs are not only
expected to understand the new legislation along
with intern ational instru m e n t s , but to help conceive
new laws and amend former ones.
Economic integration
Since independence,Kyrgyzstan has often hai-
led itself as “the Switzerland of Central Asia”—a
multiethnic country that has gone further than any
of its neighbours in constructing an open society.
S u rrounded by gas-rich Uzbekistan and oil-ri c h
K a z a k h s t a n , not to mention China—some argue
t h at the resource-poor country had no other option
than to invest in democratic reforms as a way to
attract intern ational attention and integr ate into
the world market. Along with efforts to fight cor-

Ky rg y z s t a n : b reaking out 
of the old shell
w Cynthia Guttman
In Ky rg y z s t a n , widely re g a rded as the most democratic country in Central A s i a , legal reform 
is running up against old attitudes and dire economic conditions
Fourth year law students at Ky rgyz National State Univers i t y :e n rollment in this field has surg e d

social explosion had it started off by changing the
political stru c t u r e .” Although recognizing that they
h ave little tradition of self-gove rn a n c e , the Ky r g y z
are fond of claiming that democratic principles are
deeply embedded in their nomadic traditions. L aw
professor Galina Mukambaeva is delving into
M a n a s, the revered national epic, in an attempt to
p r ove that her nation of nomadic tribes had its ow n
s t ructure and ideology over 2,000 ye a rs ago. In the
c a p i t a l , a fie ry equestrian statue of the legend’s hero
is just as present as a giant one of Lenin, which stands
next to the shrine where the Kyrgyz flag is guarded,
a proud symbol of newfound nat i o n h o o d .
A hybrid system
The turning point in this democratization pro-
cess came in May 1993,when Kyrgyzstan adopted
a new constitution that established a secular demo-
c r atic society “based on the fundamentals of rule of
l aw ” . The country counts a fledgling opposition
press (see box ) , legalized trade unions (albeit we a k ) ,
some 20 political part i e s , and over 1,000 non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n s. It recently became the
first country in the former Soviet Union to autho-
rize private land ownership. Most observers would
agree that the country has a solid legal framework
but the context remains very fragile for putting it
into practice. Extreme pove rty is on the ri s e ,p ri vat e
business lacks the wherewithal to kickstart the eco-
nomy, and many, especially in rural areas, long for
the times when the state provided a cushioned secu-
ri t y. In the south, a hostage crisis and border war are
d r a g ging on. They have already claimed over a
dozen lives and displaced several thousand people.
The separation of three branches of power is
one of the cornerstones of the Constitution,which
represents a radical break from the omnipotence
of the stat e . “There were situations at the begi n-
ning of independence when the gove rnment tried to
use the judges and court s ,” s ays Mr Ty l e b a l i e v,
chairman of the Supreme Court.“But now things
h ave changed, and the court system is indepen-
dent.” Not everyone would agree that such a long
road has been travelled,however,starting with the
judges themselves. Seventy per cent of them prac-
ticed during the Soviet period. Now they have to
learn to function in a hybrid system mingling ele-
ments from the  European and A n g l o - A m e ri c a n
m o d e l s , with many laws from Soviet times still pre-
vailing in amended form.
“We’re moving from an inquisitorial model to
an adversarial model. Under the previous system,
the prosecutors would bring the case, the judges
were very passive,” explains Lamar Cravens,of the
A m e rican Bar A s s o c i at i o n ’s Central and East Euro-
pean Law Initiative.“Without a habit of initiative,
i t ’s ve ry hard to enforce the new procedural ru l e s.”
Lawyers are also faced with the task of sharpening
their advo c a cy skills and understanding all the
defence mechanisms available to them in protecting
their clients. N atalia A b l ova , director of the Bureau
on Human Rights and Rule of Law, regrets that all
too many law ye rs fail to apply intern ational human
rights instruments in arguing their cases.
Herding sheep
to make ends meet
But even with the strongest commitment,
judges can seldom devote themselves heart and
mind to their task.“ S a l a ry is one of the most impor-
tant elements necessary for judges to keep their
i n d e p e n d e n c e . I know of judges who keep sheep
and cattle to surv i ve ,” s ays Anarkul To k s o b a e va ,

The quest for r u l e of lawMaking t  leap to a    
director of the Judicial Training Centre, which orga-
nizes seminars for judges on analysing new legisla-
t i o n .A judge earns approx i m ately $40 per month—
more than a teacher ($15 to $20 a month) or a
g ove rnment clerk ($10 a month) but far short of the
minimum required to survive. Such a context can
undermine the ideal of judicial independence. “If
you don’t come under pressure from a member of
p a r l i a m e n t , you come under the pressure of the
shadow economy,” notes Toksobaeva.
The selection process is also a point of debate:
judges are appointed for a set term by the presi-
dent upon the recommendation of an at t e s t at i o n
committee, a process that parliament is seeking to
m o d i f y.“ C r e ating an independent judiciary is really
the major problem of this country:to have elected
j u d g e s , at least at some leve l , to improve their stat u s ,
if not in a radical mat e rial way, at least to gi ve them
the feeling of independence,” s ays Jerzy W i e c l aw,
head of the Organization for Security and Co-ope-
ration in Europe (OSCE) in Kyrgyzstan.
Instilling confidence in the court system is a
lengthy task, rendered all the more difficult if the
judiciary’s image is tainted.Before lodging a com-
p l a i n t , people have to prove they have paid their
state tax.Many cannot afford a lawyer. Law enfor-
cement agencies are judged weak and often unk-
nowledgeable about their own law and internatio-
nal obligations. “People’s rights are frequently vio-
lated, whether by a state body or another person,
but they have no custom of turning to the courts,”
s ays Mirgul Smanalieva , head of the A t t o rn e y s
Association of Kyrgyzstan.“One of our goals is to
organize TV programmes to explain to people how
they should behave and who they should turn to
when their rights are violated.If each citizen knew
their rights and could fight for them, m aybe our
system would work more effectively.”
Such an investment in civil society is considered
one of the keys to entrenching rule of law.“ I t ’s a little
better than before but people still don’t know their
ri g h t s , they don’t know what the constitution means,
h ow their taxes are spent or how to lobby for their
i n t e r e s t s ,” s ays A s i ya Sasykbaeva , head of the Inter-
belim center, an umbrella organization providing ser-
vices to improve NGO capacity.The Soros foundat i o n
is earmarking 8 per cent of its budget towards law
p r o grammes (against 2.5 per cent at present) to sup-
p o rt law and human rights projects,open up legal aid
centres and improve the competence of administrat i ve
o f ficials in the regi o n s.Schools are also a target.“ T h e
goal is to make eve ry student feel they are a citizen of
this country and to understand they have human
ri g h t s ,”s ays Atyrkul A l i s h e va of the Institute for Regi o-
nal Studies, explaining the aim of her textbook on
l aw, constitution and human ri g h t s , which is being
used for the first time this year in high schools.
Soul-searching
At the university level,where law is a subject in
growing demand, new disciplines are being intro-
duced, especially in the field of international law.
Some faculties are trying to encourage more ana-
lysis and less rote learning, more practice and less
theory. Although new books are being written by
p r o f e s s o rs , m a ny of those still in use date from
S oviet times, l i b r a ries are poor, there is a lack of
published legal commentaries and a number of law
faculties are short of qualified teaching staff. The
multiplication in the number of universities since
independence (from 9 to 23) has also led to wide
gaps in quality.The ABA is urging the government
to set up a national competency standards exam
for all students wishing to practice law.
In a country still soul searching after the col-
lapse of the USSR, youth are likely in the best posi-
tion for shaping a new ideology. According to the
O S C E ’s Jerzy W i e c l aw, “ e d u c ated youth want to
think and behave like Europeans, this is their point
of reference.” Although jobs in the legal field are
hard to come by at present, S m a n a l i e va has no
doubts about the commitment of the yo u n g .
“There is a big difference between the young gene-
r ation and ours.We had a complex about expressing
our minds openly, and this interferes with our abi-
lity to be creat i ve .The young speak openly and bra-
vely and can convince.They are the ones who will
really bring in reforms.” n
