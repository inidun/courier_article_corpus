THE 1951 GENERAL CONFERENCE OF UNESCO
"VA MEE, TING OF GREAT DECISIONS"
UNESCO'S 1951 General Confe-
rence has ended. Has it
accomplished anything really
worthwhile and meaningful for
the peoples of the world ? Speak-
ing at a press conference, imme-
diately after the close of the final
plenary session on July 11, Mr. How-
land H. Sargeant (United States
delegation head and president of
the conference) told radio and
newsmen that'''thi. s Sixth General
Conference of Unesco has been one
of great decisions, marked by the
launching of what I expect to be-
come one of the'extraordinary
projects'of Unesco-the world-
wide netwOrk of centres of funda-
mental education.
"Unesco has taken other deci-
sians at this conference", Mr. Sar-
geant added,"shawing clearly that
it is now ready, willing and able to
go into action when hostilities
cease or when peace is threatened.
A striking example is the approval
by the General Conference of a re-
solution which calls for Unesco to
be prepared, at the request of ECO-
SOC'to assist... the. action of the
United Nations either to maintain
peace in areas where conflicts are
liable to arise, or, after the cessa-
tion of hastilities, to'restare the
normal life of national communi-
ties in areas subject to such con-
flicts'. We can take pride in the
significance of Unesco's declared
intention to be ready to assist the
United Nations at a time when the
peace is in danger.
"Today, with the cease-fire ne-
gotia tJons in Korea fresh in the
minds of all of us, we of course
recognize the significance of Unes-
co's action in aiding schools and
providing teachers and educational
resources in Korea.
"This develops a new action
front for Unesco. It does not re-
place the basic programme and
tasks of Unesco, but it demons-
trates that the organizations is
alive, that Unesco has the resour-
ces, energy, and the will to help
its parent organization, the Uni-
ted Nations, in a time of emer-
gency and contribute effectively to
peace and security for all the na-
tions of the world."
U Truly International"
AMONG some of the other im-partant lessOns brOught Out
by the Conference, one in
particular must be recognized-
the progress made in increasing the
numerical strength of Unesco's
Member States.
A world organizations dedicated
to the social and spiritual defence
of peace and to the service of cul-
ture in its widest sense must keep
on growing ; in fact, it cannot
fully accompish its mission with-
out the collaboration of all coun-
tries.
However self-evident this may
appear, it is a fact that takes on
special significance in the light of
existing political threats and un-
rest in the world. Conference de-
legates were emphatic on this
point."'Unesco,"said Mr. How-
land H. Sargeant,"should clearly
remain as a truly international
agency dedicated to the attainment
of peace and security for all man-
kind."
Further progress was made in
the realization of this ideal, in this
march toward universality, when
the Conference admitted to mem-
bership five more States : Cam-
bodia, the Federal Republic of Ger-
many, Japan, Laos and Vietnam.
All five have since ratified the
Unesco Constitution at the British
Foreign Office, thus bringing Unes-
co's membership to 64 countries.
Yet it is not only in 64 countries
that Unesco's work must be carried
on in future, for the Conference
also decided to admit non-self-go-
verning territories or groups of ter-
ritories as associate members of
the Organization. The statute for
these associate members has been
drawn up, and their active parti-
cipation should now lead to far-
reaching development of Unesco's
work, especially in Africa.
However, to be effective, this
universality must be based on
each nation's possibilities. This i. s
why Unesco's programme, as ap-
proved by the Conference, aims
more and more to meet a variety
of needs by adapting itself to the
different capabilities of each coun-
try.
Strengthening Links
IT was natural that the Confer-ence, to counter-balance the
growth of membership, and in
order to ensure the unity of the
Organization, should call for a
strengthening of the means of liai-
son between Member States and the
Secretariat. Unfortunately, the
majority of the National Commis-
sions (whose function is to assure
this liaison) are not yet in a posi-
tion to do so adequately. It is
therefore planned to set up a net-
work of Unesco Regional offices,
starting in areas furthest away
from Paris. These will benefit
from the experience gained by the
Regional Office for the Western
Hemisphere now operating in Ha-
vana, and the scientific co-opera-
tion centres set up by Unesco in
Cairo, New Delhi, Manila, Jakarta
and Montevideo.
To the effects of this co-opera-
tive plan to unify efforts by the
various countries must be added
those of the work done by non-
governmental organizations which
bring together specialists in various
activities within Unesco's fields, or
representatives of groups particu-
larly concerned in its work.
In this way the General Confe-
rence has defined more specifically
than ever before the structure of
Unesco.
The Boldest Programme
IT is, however, the decisionstaken by the Conference on
the main tasks of Unesco that
have made the 1952 programme the
baldest and most carefully consi-
dered that the Organization has
ever had. This has been well
brought home to the man in the
street, who has followed with spe-
cial interest the work of the
Conference and in particular that
relating to the Special Project in
Fundamental Education.
Before this project had even
taken form, Unesco had already
drawn attention to a problem that
too many people seemed to have
forgotten. In the 20th century
which awes its achievements to
knowledge, and technical progress,
it is industrial development, link-
ed to education, which gives man
the prospect of living fully and
developing his abilities to the full.
But how can these ambitions for
a better life be reconciled with the
terrible inequalities which separate
the privileged peoples from the less
favoured ?
There are 1, 200, 000, 000 illiterates
in the world, people who remain
ignorant of the simplest of tech-
niques, people who are excluded
from the progress of which this
century should be proud. This
figure not only represents ignor-
ance, but in a similar measure,
ill-heath, hunger and misery. The
teaching methods which Unesco
will use to grapple with this pro-
blem are therefore not those of the
primary school-for how could
millions of schools be founded
immediately and where could the
millions of teachers who would be
needed at short notice be found ?
No, the answer is to be found in
Fundamental EducatiO'n-educ-
action which tries to give both
adults and children a minimum of
general knowledge that will enable
them to overcome the obstacles
which so cripplingly limit their
progress and that of their commu-
nity. The new Unesco Funda-
mental Education Praject can
achieve what isolated efforts in
the past could never hope to do ;
but it will use the experience they
gained, such as in the difficult
experiment in the Marbial Valley
of Haiti.
The Fundamental Education pro-
ject is a 12-year plan to provide
training centres in six areas-
Equatorial Africa, Latin America,
India, the Middle East, the Far
East and South-East Asia. Using
the most modern methods, these
centres will train teachers who will
then return to their own countries
to set up national centres.
At the end of this 12-year
period, 4, 200 specialists will have
been provided, each one capable of
organizing in the most under-
developed territories a complete
form of education, from teaching
the alphabet to hygiene, from
household techniques to rural
industries. The first centre is
already in operation at Patzcuaro,
Mexico. The second will be set up
this year, and seven countries have
asked for it to be on their territory.
This, in outline, is the plan which
a commentator has described as
"audacious and practical."It cer-
tainly strikes the imagination.
A Common Objective
THE programme which theGeneral Conference has ap-
proved is not just a lining-up
of projects, but a balanced entity
in which different techniques
are used to reach a common
objective. Education, interna-
tional co-operation, mutual assis-
tance-none of these can be
considered by itself. Whether they
refer to the efforts of pioneers in
under-developed areas or the
provision of mutual aid between
groups of specialists, their common
objective, in the final analysis,
must clearly be the consolidation
of peace through the respect of
human rights.
While each delegation wished to
make the 1952 programme as
widely effective as possible, the
limiting factor of budgetary expen-
diture made the Conference decide
to give priority to education. It is
noteworthy that the countries
which urged this priority most
strongly were those which already
have a high level of education and
which will therefore not benefit
themselves from the money ex-
pended on educational projects.
In the field of workers'education,
the Conference asked Unesco to set
up in the Paris area an interna-
tional centre to train specialists
and improve methods of teaching
about world affairs. Unesco will,
as in 1951, continue to put missions
of experts at the disposition of
States to help revise or improve
their educational systems. Among
many other educational under-
takings already started and now
to be extended, there is room here

moved from the Arc de Triomphe
quarter of Paris to a section near
the Eiffel Tower on the Left Bank.
This was announced by the 1951
General Conference of Unesco fol-
lowing an offer made by the French
Government ceding an area of
335, 000 square feet of land for the
construction of permanent head-
quarters to house the international
Secretariat of Unesco. Speaking for
hi-Goverment M. Olivier Lapie,
French MiniSter of Education, in-
formed the Unesco Conference that
France was making available an
interest-free loan of 2. 025, 000. 000
francs (5, 800. 000 dollars} to help
Unesco erect the new building,
which will be constructed at the
Place Fontenoy (shown here) in
the Ecole Militaire district of the
capital. Contruction work is to
begin in about one year from now
and is expected to be completed 18
months later. Under this schedule,
the new Unesco headquarters will
be ready ior occupation by the end
01 april 1954.

\\ A MEETING OF GREAT DECISIONS"
(Continued from previous port)
to mention only a few main ones :
the revision of history and geo-
graphy textbooks, action in support
of women's education, and teaching
the rights of man. Unesco's work
on behalf of youth movements will
cons1st next year of giving further
help to organizations which encou-
rage international contacts, and
try to develop the moral and intel-
lectual solidarity of mankind.
,
The Right To Culture
THE main lines of Unesco's
cultural activities have al-
ready been laid down in past
years : the furthering of world
intellectual co-operation, the pre-
servation of man's cultural herit-
ages and the assurance of protec-
tion to writers and artists. But
for 1952 the General Conference
has given them more precision.
Unesco is to assist and subsidize
up to a total of 167, 440 dollars, a
number of important international
organizations, such as the Interna-
tional Council for Philosophy and
Humanistic Studios, the Interna-
tional Theatre Institute, the Inter-
national Music Council and the
International Council of Museums.
These organizations, whose mem-
bers include the most outstanding
figures in learning and the arts,
will thu. s be able to carry out stu-
dies and publish the results as
well as produce other works which
their normal finances would pre-
vent them from doing. Unesco is
also to convene next year a meeting
of thinkers, scientists and writers
in Geneva, and an international
conference of artists in Venice.
The diffusion of culture received
special consideration at the Con-
ference. Emphasis in the 1952 pro-
gramme ori the artistic education
of the general public is largely due
to efforts by the United Kingdom
and the United States. Literary
exchangers, through the translation
of classics have been given a lead-
ing place, and the efforts of
Unesco in this work will concern
masterpieces in Arab, Persian, Ita-
lian and Latin-American litera-
ture.
Science For Mankind
IN the same way as it works inco-operation with artists and
writers, Unesco will also work
for and with men of science. A
total of 218, 000 dollars will be
allocated in 1952, in the form of
subventions or service contracts., to
scientific organizations which in-
clude the International Council of
Scientific Unions, the International
Union for the Protection of Nature
and the International Union of
Mathematics.
Unesco will also increase its
efforts on behalf of international
institutes of scientific research.
It has already been decided to
strengthen the International Arid
Zone Research Council, which is to
take part in a world-wide effort to
check the encroachment of desert
conditions and soil erosion, and to
establish an International Compu-
tation Centre at a forthcoming
international conference to be held
in Paris. (See page 13,)
Emphasizing that all scientific
progress should contribute to the
improvement of living conditions
of mankind, the Conference also
decided that Unesco should carry
out a world survey of research
institutes and laboratories to study
what contributions they can bring
to the solution of modern economic
and social problems.
While the natural sciences can
help in the field of social problems,
the solution of these depends more
specifically on other specialized
studies and methods and, directed
as they are towards the study of
the behaviours of human groups,
the social sciences are more capable
than any others of helping the
modern world to resolve its diffi-
culties and problems.
Unesco's action is resolutely
aimed towards action in the cause
of peace, and here the Social Scien-
ces can make an important contri-
bution. This conviction was ex-
pressed in a resolution which pro-
vides for Unesco to collaborate
with United Nations'action desi-
gned (a) to preserve peace in areas
where a conflict is threatening and
(b) to restore normal life in terri-
tories where fighting has stopped.
Beyond Politics
THE resolution was voted with
all the more enthusiasm
since delegates immediately
saw the prospect of its being ap-
plied to Korea. The delegates of
Brazil, France and the United Sta-
tes expressed the general feeling
when they stressed that action of
this sort went beyond any political
implications. An objective analy-
sis of the facts, carried out in an
impartial spirit, is needed to
enlighten governments and public
opinion, and so track down and
prevent the causes of war.
Unesco will also continue its
work of trying to eliminate racial
prejudice and discrimination. It
will publish the results of the latest
scientific research on the subject,
while carrying out on the spot
investigations of conditions which
enable harmonious relations to
be established between different
ethnic groups. It is also proposed
to survey practical means of
removing social tensions of all
kinds.
If the Social Sciences are to be
fruitfully applied to modern world
problems, they must have efficient
international machinery and sound
working equipment. The co-opera-
tion of scientists of all nations
and the pooling of their discoveries
is a basic requirement of progress.
Rehabilitation Work
THE activities which have sofar been briefly described are
all designed to achieve their
effects progressively over a certain
period of time. There are, how-
ever, conditions which require
immediate relief action.
An important part of Unesco's
rehabilitation programme, for
example, is to be devoted to edu-
cation assistance in Korea while
educational assistance to Arab
refugee children in the Middle East
will be continued. This latter
work, started in 1949, has resulted
in the opening by Unesco of 114
schools for 44, 000 children in
refugee camps.
Another major activity-the
Coupons Programme-will be
developed. Under the Unesco Gift
Coupon Scheme, money collected
by organizations through the sale
of stamps is transferred into gift
coupons which are then sent by
the purchasing group to a rehabi-
litation project it has chosen.
Other Unesco coupons enable
people and institutions in soft-
currency countries to purchase
books, films and scientific equip-
ment in hard currency countries
while paying for them in their own
money.
The above round-up of the
programme approved by the Gene-
ral Conference is too short to
allow mention of many other
activities whose full importance
will only be revealed as they
develop in the months ahead. Just
the same, it has been sufficient to
show the immense variety of tasks
which fall to Unesco and, at the
same time, to illustrate that variety
does not necessarily mean dis-
persion.
A central idea uniting these dif-
ferent objectives was well summ-
ed up by the delegate of the
United States when he said :
"Unesco must turn to the tasks
which will help attain peace and
security, social and economic pro-
gress for all the peoples of the
world."Thus, for example, the
special project in fundamental
education which represents the
most immediate answer to this
need, also. helps to bring out in its
fullest sense the true spirit of
Unesco's Constitution.
Each delegation spoke in support
of this interpretation of the mis-
sion of Unesco which, as an orga-
nization, has now acquired matu-
rity and experience and is fully
conscious of its responsibilities.
This conception was expressed by
Mgr. Jean Maroun (Lebanon)
when he said,"Unesco looks

clearly and confidently towards the
future ; its new programme con-
tains a message which is clearer
and more eloquent for being a
message of action."
Several delegations affirmed that
this effectiveness will be achieved
only through action and certainly
not by theoretical discussions.
"We believe", said M. Ribnikar
(Yugoslavia)"that peace is, after
all, possible. Experience has shown
to us that if men do not always
agree on a common ideological
ground, they often succeed in
achieving a community of spirit on
practical conceptions."
Speaking on behalf of the Indian
delegation, Shri Kalam Azad de-
clared :"If any hope is left, it is in
Unesco, for it is only through
intellectual understanding and
sympathy that we may yet avert
the disaster which otherwise threa-
tens to engulf the whole of
humanity in one common ruin.
Economic and political agreement
will only be achieved if cultural
agreement already exists."
Mr. Hector McNeil, Secretary of
State for Scotland, was warmly
applauded when he remarked that,
although until recently the senior
servants of Unesco had taken the
major part in shaping the Orga-
nization's programme, a greater
part of the responsibility. had been
taken over this year by the dele-
gates."We want to see the
Conference making itself respon-
sible for the success or lack of
success of the programme", he
added.
What Can Unesco Do ?
THIS responsibility which fallsto each Member State was
emphasized by M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-
General, in his closing address.
After outlining the different aspects
of the work accomplished by the
Conference, the Director-General
examined both the future of this
work and of the Organization
itself.
"What can Unesco do ?", he
asked.'''Direct action not merely
postulates technique and tools.
It also requires above all men and
money. The men-by which I
mean the experts-are hardly
enough to go round. At least
Unesco can collect and mobilize
the available ability and goodwill,
and it has resolutely applied itself
to the task of increasing the num-
ber and improving the quality of
candidates for this work, and of
training them in ever-increasing
numbers.
"There remains the question of
finance. That is where, for three
years, Unesco has been brought to
a standstill. It will come one day
to the point where it must either
surmount this obstacle or give up
altogether... For the first time,
the contributions of the majority
of Member States have decreased.
I think it my duty to warn the
General Conference very seriously
of the danger of taking this as a
precedent for the future."
Wise Proverb
AFTER showing that thebudget was not large enough
to cover all that the
Organization was capable of doing,
nor to supply all the services
which the Member States had
a right to expect, M. Torres
Bodet declared :"You cannot give
with one hand and take away with
the other. If there was ever an
institution to which that old, wise
and sensible proverb applies it is
indeed Unesco as you yourselves
have created and defined it : an
Organiz ; ; l. tion made for the eman-
cipation of the mind, for education
in peace, and to be the apes. tile of
human rights. One cannot give
with one hand in the programme
and take away with the other in
the budget."
Ending his speech, M. Torres
Bodet reminded delegates that they
would be meeting at the next
Conference in Paris in November,
1952."I hope with all my heart...
that we shall meet in peace", he
said. Emphasizing once again
that the success of the-work to be
undertaken would require the re-
doubling of faith, tenacity and
enthusiasm, he said,"Unesco is not
a luxury designed for easy times.
For my part I have always thought
of it as a fieroic effort, and it is
in the most difficult days that the
world has the greatest need of
it."
