Distant galaxies
caught in a steel mesh
Left, general view of the Arecibo
radio-radar telescope.
Its giant bowl-shaped
reflector, covering
over 18 acres (7 hectares),
Is made up of some
11,000 sections of i In.
(1.25 cm.) thick wire mesh.
Suspended above the centre
is the focusing device
weighing 500 tons
(close-up photo right)
which can be moved about
to allow the telescope
to scan a large area of sky.
The telescope's position,
18 degrees north of the equator,
enables it to reach
all the planets,
for at that latitude
they pass high overhead.
MONG the rugged green hills
Lnear Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
scientists and engineers have built the
world's largest radio-radar telescope. Its
bowl-shaped reflector, which lines a vast
natural hollow in the hills, is a taut ex¬
panse of steel mesh covering over 18
acres. Five hundred feet above it, sus¬
pended from cables supported by three
tall towers, is a 550-ton complex of gir¬
ders, wires and machinery. This is the
telescope's focusing device. A 96-ft (30
metre) metal finger points downwards to
send radio waves to the mesh which then
reflects them into outer space. When
these reflected waves strike something
they bounce back. Scientists analyze the
returning signals for information about
the object encountered in space. The
equipment operates as a radio telescope
when only the reflector (antenna) and
receiver are used; as a radar telescope
when short pulses of radio waves from
a transmitter are distributed over the
reflector. A beam of pulses is directed
to a target in space, and when they
bounce back the reflector is used a
second time to receive them. The tele
scope was originally designed for studies
of the ionosphere, the rarefied outer
atmosphere of the earth, but is now being
used also for radar exploration of the
solar system and for receiving radio sig¬
nals from some of the most distant
objects known to astronomers. The great
potentialities of radio astronomy for
revealing the large-scale structure of the
universe became fully appreciated in the
1950s, when it was discovered that some
of the most intense celestial radio
emitters, hitherto known as "radio stars"
were, in fact, galaxies so distant as to be
on the verge of detectability with the
largest optical telescopes. As Sir Ber¬
nard Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank
Radio Astronomy Laboratories in Eng¬
land, points out in the December, 1965
issue of Science Journal, published in
England, for nearly 20 years the combined
work of the optical and radio astronomers
has. been revealing a cosmos of ever
increasing fantasy. The penetration into
space had increased so rapidly that
already in 1960 it became possible
to identify a radio galaxy (3C295) 4,500
million light years distant from the earth.
