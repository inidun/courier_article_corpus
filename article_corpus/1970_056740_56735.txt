mLOBAL expenditure for military purposes has
reached a new record high. In 1967, the military spending
of the world's nations totalled $182,000 million dollars,
according to "World Military Expenditures, 1966-1967," the
findings of a recent survey of 120 countries carried out
by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in
co-operation with other U.S. government agencies and
several international bodies, including Unesco and WHO.

WORLD ARMAMENTS (Continued)
Startling findings from a world
survey on arms expenditure
The world spends 40 per cent more on armaments
than on public education: $159,000 million for milita¬
ry budgets; $1 1 1 ,000 million for public education.
Average annual expenditure per soldier, world-wide,
is $7,800. Average public expenditure for edu¬
cation is $100 annually per child for the estimated
1,000 million young people in the world school-age
population (ages 5-19).
Developed countries spend a much higher pro¬
portion of their gross national product on public
education (5 per cent) than do the less-developed
countries (3 per cent).
The less developed countries have 72 per cent of
the world's population, but public expenditure on
education is only 11 per cent of world expenditure.
The less developed countries spend an average of
$5 per capita annually for education as compared
to an average of $100 per capita in the developed
countries.
Of the $44,000 million increase in world military
spending from 1965 to 1967, the United States and
the Soviet Union made up almost three-fourths
of the world total.
Compared with 1962," when the United Nations estimated
world spending on arms at 120,000 million dollars, there
has been an increase of more than 50 per cent. If this
trend continues, arms expenditure will consume the astro¬
nomic sum of 4 billion dollars (or 4 trillion dollars in Ame¬
rican usage: $4,000,000,000,000) over the next 10 years.
It is almost impossible to explain what these staggering
figures mean in terms comprehensive to the ordinary man
in the street, but an attempt is made in the graphic presen¬
tation published opposite. It shows that if a coin were
dropped every second, it would take 5,750 years for the last
coin to drop for the 182,000 million dollars spent in 1967 on
armaments, and 126,000 years for the last coin to drop for
the sum of $4,000,000,000,000 likely to be spent on arms in
the next 10 years.
Or to put it another way, if the coins 2 è millimetres in
thickness are piled flat one on top of the other: they would
reach all the way to the moon and extend beyond it by
71,000 kilometres just for the amount spent by the world
on military matters in 1967. For military expenditure in
the next 10 years at the rate we are going, the pile of
coins would rise ten million kilometres into space, or
30 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.
The world is now spending more money on military
affairs than at any period except the peak fighting years
of World War II, and this represents 7 per cent of the
world's gross product. This is equivalent to the total
annual income of the 1,000 million people in the countries of
Latin America, South Asia and the Near East combined.
During 1964-1967 military spending increased faster than
world population growth (by 7 per cent) and much faster
than the growth of the world's gross product (16 per cent).
Japan spends more than 4 times as much on edu¬
cation as on military services. Canada twice as
much. Other developed countries which spend
more on education than on military programmes:
Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands. Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland.
Many countries spend large sums on privately-
financed education and health in addition to public
funds for these purposes. Private spending on
education in the U.S.A. is estimated at $7,000 million
compared with public expenditures of $34,000 mil¬
lion. But total U.S. figure for education is less
than two-thirds the size of its military budget.
The developing countries did not escalate their
military spending as much as the industrially de¬
veloped nations in the period 1964-1967, Their ave¬
rage military outlay per capita was $8 (as against
an average of $170 in the developed countries).
But since the standard of living is low in these
countries, with an average per capita G.N. P. of
$186, even a diversion of $8 per capita for military
purposes represents a very heavy burden.
The world total of about $8,000 million in econo¬
mic aid to the developing nations is less than one-
half of 1 per cent of the gross national product
of the donor countries.
Aid to the developing countries averaged $8 per
capita in the developed countries as compared to
$170 per capita spent on military programmes.
1 l\ Military expenditures of the less developed nations
were more than twice as large as their receipts
of foreign economic aid.
