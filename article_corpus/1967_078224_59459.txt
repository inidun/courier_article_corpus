I T seems impossible to
foresee man's future. However, we do
know that the past determines our pre¬
sent in many realms: language, concept
of the world, religion, science, law.
Moreover, certain biological and phy¬
siological conditions appear to be so
characteristic of the human race that
if they were absent we would no longer
really speak of man as such.
Thus the present largely determines
the future and today, unwittingly, we
are determining for centuries to come
the modes of life of our progeny.
The average expectation of life in
the past (that is, of our ancestors up
to about the year 1800) did not corres¬
pond to man's biological life span. The
systematic analysis of many church
registers of the past is providing us
JEAN FOURASTIE, sociologist and econ¬
omist, is a professor at the Institut d'étu¬
des politiques of the University of Paris
who has written a number of studies of
demographic questions. His publications
include 'La 'civilisation de 1975" (new
edition, PUF 1964, Paris); 'La grande
métamorphose du XX' siècle' (PUF 1962,

Paris); and in English "Productivity, Prices
and Wages" (OEEC 1957, Paris) and 'The
Causes of Wealth' (Free Press 1960,

with a picture of the life span of our
forefathers.
From these studies it would appear
that the average expectation of life, or
the average life at birth, was of the
order of 25 years in France at the end
of the 17th century and the beginning
of the 18th. For certain generations
who lived in ancient Europe during
periods of great distress and misery,
this figure dropped to about 20 years.
It is these figures 20 years, 25
years which' give full significance to
the presently foreseeable figure: 80
years.
In the past, out of one thousand chil¬
dren born alive, an average of about
430 or 440 reached the age of marria¬
ge; tomorrow the figure will be 985.
The average ages at which a person
was first married have varied little
since 1700, at least in France: they

were 27 for men and 25 for women;
today they are 26 and 24. Today, as
in the past, one marries for life, but in
those days married life lasted 17 years
on the average; only one household
in two reached its 15th wedding anni¬
versary. Tomorrow married life will'
last 46 to 48 years.
In traditional society it was at 14, if
he lived to that age, that the average
child saw the first of his parents die;
tomorrow it will be at the age of 55.
This is of course gratifying, but it must
be pointed out that more than half the
personal wealth of a nation will then
belong to men and women over 75
years old.
Formerly, parents often died before
their children completed their educa¬
tion; tomorrow, assuming the age of
marriage to be what it is today, a
normal couple will live for 20 to 25
years after the marriage of their youn¬
gest child.
At the end of the 17th century in
France, but probably In the rest of
the world as well, the life of the ave¬
rage father of a family who had married
for the first time at the age of 27,
could be summarized as follows: born
into a family of five children, he saw
only half that number reach the age
of 15; like his father, he too had five
children, of whom only two or three
were alive at the time of his death (1).
This man, living on an average to the
age of 52 an age which placed him
in the venerable ranks of the elders
saw an average of nine persons of his
immediate family (not including uncles,
nephews and first cousins) die. Among
the nine was one grandparent (the
other three having died before his
birth), his two parents, and three of his
children.
He had lived through two or three

not important in this matter.
famines plus three or four periods of
high grain prices caused by poor har¬
vests which occurred in approximately
ten-year cycles. He had seen various
members of his family fall ill his bro¬
thers, his children, his wife, and his
parents; he had known two or three
epidemics of infectious diseases, not
to mention the semi-permanent epide¬
mics of whooping cough, scarlet fever,
and diphteria.
In former- times death was in the
midst of life just as the cemetery was
in the middle of a village. Since then,
death, poverty and disease have been
retreating. They are no longer consi¬
dered man's relentless companions,
driving him toward a spiritual life and
moral progress, but as accidents or a
sort of amputation, an unfortunate mis¬
chance which runs counter to man's
true nature, and which must not only
be opposed but checked and brought
under control.
There is no doubt that the increase
in the average span of life will have a

WORLD POPULATION (Continued)
When the pyramids turn into rectangles
marked effect on the individual, the
family and society as a whole. The
consequences will be powerful enough
to modify our behaviour, the moral
structure of society, our legal institu¬
tions, and our whole attitude to life
itself. But the demographic conse¬
quences alone appear to be the most
significant and they will certainly weigh
most heavily on the future of mankind.
Indeed, the single fact that less than
450 children out of 1,000 born alive
reached the average age of marriage
in traditional society whereas about
980 will reach the end of the average
child-bearing age in the future, is
indicative of the basic pattern of rapi¬
dly rising population we are headed
for.

AN'S appearance on earth
goes back five or eight hundred thou¬
sand years; four thousand years before
Christ humanity still numbered less
than 10 million; 100 million at the birth
of Jesus; and 2,400 million in 1950;
there will be 7,000 million in the year
2000, according to estimates of the
United Nations.
I do not wish to discuss the level
of stabilization which humanity will
eventually reach, or even if there will
be an effective stabilization level,
although this seems to demand an
affirmative answer. I should like here
to consider the types of humanity
which would result from different
levels of population.
Let us consider two extreme hypo¬
theses regarding conditions of habita-
bility of our planet. In the first man
modifies neither the physical geogra¬
phy of the world nor the climates (Hy¬
pothesis A). In the second hypothesis
man manages to fill in a portion
oí the seas by tipping the mountains
into theiß. so that all terra firma would
become habitable (Hypothesis B).
With Hypothesis A there would be
scarcely seven thousand million hec¬
tares in which one might live without
feeling like a political deportee or a
scientific guinea pig; with Hypothe¬
sis B there would be 15 thousand mil¬
lion hectares.
Now let us refer to Table 1, which
lists a few figures familiar to all geo¬
graphers.
It is simple to calculate the world
populations that would result from the
extension on a world scale of the va¬
rious densities mentioned in this table.
I would merely note that each of the
seven thousand million hectares of
Hypothesis A was already in 1960
more heavily populated on the average
than was each of the 35 million hec¬
tares in France under Louis XV in the
18th century. It may also be noted
that in the year 2000 these same seven
thousand million hectares will have a
slightly higher population density than
that of present-day France (0.9 inhabi¬
tants per hectare as against 0.8).

Ai S for the density which the
city of New York supports at the pre¬
sent time, it would permit the sustaining
of life for 700 thousand million persons
under Hypothesis A and 1 billion
500,000 million (1,500,000,000,000) un¬
der Hypothesis B. If we assume the
rate of increase for the years 1950-60
(the world's population doubling every
40 years) these figures would be rea¬
ched by the year 2200 with Hypothe¬
sis A and by 2310 with Hypothe¬
sis B (3).
In comparison one may recall that
the total population of the world in
(2) The densities of these countries are
calculated here on the basis of total geo¬
graphic area. Obviously much of these
lands is effectively cultivable and habitable
only in a hypothesis similar to Hypothesis B.
(3) It can be seen that Hypotheses A and
B, which are so different from each other
from the technical and geographical point
of view, differ very little from the demo¬
graphic standpoint.
1935 could have been contained in a
single town having the density of Paris
and a diameter of the distance between
Chartres and Rheims (about 250 kms
or 150 miles).
I do not believe that it was out of
place when I used the term "types of
humanity" to designate the populations
which have existed in the past, which
exist today and will exist tomorrow as
a result of these different densities.
Indeed, these density figures are so
widely different that they imply radi¬
cally different ways of life, each in turn
resulting in a different intellectual and
physical environment.
I T takes no great stretch of
the imagination to realize that between
the man living in a natural environment
such as that of France in 1750 and the
man of the future inhabiting an endless
town of the density of New York
stretching over thousands of kilome¬
tres, there are many points in common
with animals living in the open forest as
compared to those confined in a zoo.
The least one can say is that the
problem deserves to be studied and
that we have little time (300 years is
nothing to meet a biological problem)
in which to solve it.
Table 2 shows how sensitive, relati¬
vely speaking, the world will become
to moderate or even slight rates of
population increases, and how difficult
it will be to check the process once
a certain threshold has been crossed.
It is well established in the realm of
geometric progression that beyond a
certain threshold absolute numbers be¬
come so enormous that even a radical
or drastic reduction in the coefficient
of growth can no longer stop the run¬
away increase in absolute numbers.
From the time of Pericles to the year
2000 the global population will have
been multiplied by about 100 (in
25 hundred years), but an equivalent
increase (that is to say, a new multi¬
plication by 100) would lead to ave¬
rage densities of 100 persons to the
hectare. These same figures show the
small value of the cosmic type solu¬
tions (passage from Hypothesis A to
Hypothesis B as described above, or
populating the Moon or neighbouring
planets.)
These solutions which require vast
technical feats would provide only very
slight easing of the situation once the
number of human beings had reached
about a hundred thousand million (the

surface of the Moon is only one-fiftieth
of the Earth's, that of Mars a quarter;
only Venus is of the same dimensions
as Earth, but astronomers today say
that it is very inhospitable.)
The most striking fact is the oppo¬
sition which exists between man's na¬
tural biological faculties of reproduc¬
tion and the perspectives opened up
by the raising of his average life expec¬
tancy to 80 years. The increase noted
which demographers call the "natural
or spontaneous birth rate." If it is
assumed that this cannot happen then
one must assume that the sexual beha¬
viour of present-day and future man¬
kind already differs and will greatly
differ in the future from natural beha¬
viour. Table 2 shows that, even with
the birth rate greatly reduced, the long-
term increases remain large, that even
with an average of three children per

from Pericles' day to our own has
been achieved with natural fertility (an
average of about 4.1 or 4.2 children
per average marriage, corresponding
to about six children per complete
family) (4).
B UT in the future almost all
families will be complete families.
Furthermore, advances in medicine are
reducing and will reduce the incidence
of congenital sterility. Natural fertility
would then produce at least six children
per average family, that is, a reproduc¬
tion rate of 1.65, assuming that the
present death rate is maintained and
that the celibacy rate of about 10 per
cent remains constant. This would
double the number of the potential
parents in 20 years, which would lead
humanity into a growth twice as rapid
as the present, and from today's total
of three thousand million the population
would reach 700 thousand million in a
century and a half.
I say this only to show what would
occur in the near future with the conti¬
nuation of the immemorial birth rate,
(4) A complete family is a family In which
both parents are living at least until the
mother reaches the age of 50.
family, the population of the world
would double in 65 years.
However, the main purpose of table
2 is to show that the demographic prob¬
lem will become one of the great prob¬
lems of the near future of mankind.
It may be conceded that it will become
acute when densities are reached of
the order of ten inhabitants to the
hectare (70 thousand million people);
yet even with the rate of growth of
"highly developed countries," such as
the United States, this acute point
would be reached at a time when the
great-grandson of my grandson would
normally be alive.
IT will be seen from table 2
that contrary to general opinion, little
difference, as far as the crucial point
and the date it is reached are concern¬
ed, exists between the birth rates of the
United States and of the whole of the
rest of the world today (a mere 30 years
delay to reach a density of ten per
hectare and 50 years for a density of
100).
Even between the rates of mainland
China and America the delay in reach¬
ing density ten is only 45 yearsl Only
a much slower birth rate, such as exists
in France today, substantially post¬
pones the time when the crucial point
is reached though it is still astonishing¬
ly close at hand when viewed on the
time-scale of life on earth.
Of course what previous genera¬
tions have done future generations can
undo. By limiting the number of chil¬
dren per household to one the human
race would be reduced, after the death
of the parents, proportionately from
ten to four and a half. Perhaps our
descendants will have recourse to suc¬
cessive pulsations of growth and con¬
traction of this kind, each phase stimu¬
lating the contrary reflex.
But even if the austere one child per
family rationing were to be instituted
it would take four generations to go
from density ten to density one-half,
which was that of France in 1750;
economic and social conditions would
seem to render impossible or at least
extremely perilous such drastic defla¬
tions, or even much more gradual ones.
Table 2, then, seeks to show the
types of humanity which would exist in
the near future if the marriage and fer¬
tility rates observed at present in cer¬
tain regions were generalized through¬
out the world. If we assume that
one day it is generally agreed to stabi¬
lize the world's population at a certain
level and by a specific date, even then
mankind's population worries will not
be over.
T HE world has had no real
experience of a stabilized population
with a long life expectancy. The little
we do know gives cause for alarm.
We know, for example, that a stagnant
population curve has characteristic
economic, social and moral effects
which can be extremely serious.
In such a population the pyramid of
age distributions would become almost
a rectangle. There would be almost as
many persons aged 60 to 80 as there
were children and adolescents under
20 years.
More particularly, the decisions that
limited number of the population to a
fixed figure would have to be delibe¬
rate, whereas traditional humanity
never knew any but unconscious me¬
chanisms in this area.
As our ancestors knew, it was food
which limited the population by the
pitiless rigour of famine. The very
slow advance in agricultural techniques
thus had as a corollary a very slow
increase in the total population. In the
18th century two hectares of average
land in a temperate climate were still 1 0
needed to feed one man. Forty million * **
arable hectares in France fed 20 million
Frenchmen.

A LOOK
AT WORLD POPULATION
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
(Continued from page 13)
Today, with the techniques now avail¬
able (not necessarily used), two hec¬
tares can feed better than in the past,
not one man but ten to 20. Tomorrow
it will be 30 or 40. This would permit
population densities per hectare of
close to those of present-day London
or Berlin.
The brutal though effective mecha¬
nism of food supply, which once limited
the proliferation of the human species
as it does all animal species, no longer
operates. The problem is to discover
if another will take its place.
Man needs, occupies and uses space
that is, geographical places on the
surface of the earth. These are neces¬
sary to satisfy four types of needs:
the need for agricultural produce ne¬
cessary for nourishment; the need for
manufactured products; the need for
shelter; and the need for movement
(exercise, walking, sports, tourism). Let
us call these four "quantities of space"
needed by the average man h^ h3, h3,
and h4, respectively, hj and h2 are
relatively easy to measure accurately;
h3 is tricky to measure; and h4 is al¬
most impossible to calculate.
But the important fact, which Is
easily observed if we compare modern
life with traditional life, is that progress
in production techniques and the result¬
ing improvement in our way of life and
living standards are constantly reduc¬
ing hj and, on the contrary, increasing
h3 and h4. It looks as though h2 is
destined to reach a certain level at
which it will remain stable.
A:
34
S already indicated, for the
average man in the 18th century, f^
was about two hectares (five acres) of
good ground in a land with a temperate
climate; h2 was very small since there
were few industrial plants, factories
and artisans' workshops at that time;
with four or five people often crowded
into a room 16 metres (19 yards)
square, h3 was also small for the aver¬
age man (but for the wealthy with their
chateaux, parks and gardens it was
considerable often from one to two
hectares); finally, h4 was also small
as a need since low living standards
and mediocre techniques deprived the
average man of means of transport
and the desire to travel, but its poten¬
tial was immense in a world still almost
empty of men.
Thus it was the value of h1 that
limited total population until the dawn
of the industrial revolution. But
modern progress is steadily reducing
h-i. It has already shrunk to about
one-third of an hectare (and in the
view of some competent agronomists
even as low as one-tenth); by 2100
or 2200 A.D. it will certainly be much
smaller still. And while it may continue
to impose harsh restraints on certain
nations over the next 50 to 80 years,
it will probably no longer be the factor
that determines population levels in
the future.
S1 INCE one hectare is equi¬
valent to 10,000 square metres and on
the basis of present trends, it seems
likely that hx will still be the largest of
the three space quantities h^ h2 and
h3 as the year 2100 approaches. But
by then the total of all three may well
have been reduced to less than 1,000
square metres, which would allow a
population density of ten to the hec¬
tare.
There remains the term h4. Since
it is far more qualitative than quanti¬
tative, we can only attempt to define
it by having recourse to recollections
of our own travels, to emotions stirred
by discoveries made over the face of
the globe and to the prestige enjoyed
by explorers, pioneers and Alpinists.
For our descendants it is possible that
the hope of reaching an uninhabited
place will be merely something they
read about in books.
Assiduous calculators may well
compute the number of people who
would be jostling each other on the
100 kilometres (60 miles) of beaches
along the French Cote d'Azur if each
of the 550 million Frenchmen were
allowed to spend from two to four
weeks there even once in his lifetime.
They could also estimate how many
metres of beaches with Mediterranean-
type or tropical climates there are
for each Russian, each Chinese and
each Indian today, and even how many
kilometres of artificial beaches would
have to be built to allow each person
to spend two weeks paid holiday there.
Many serious-minded persons would
frown on this sort of calculation.
But I would say its merit is to
demonstrate the differences which
will exist between the civilization of
yesterday, that of today and that of
tomorrow which we are already beginn¬
ing to create.
Our modern civilization is orientated
toward an increase in consumer goods
and toward a reduction in living space.
The rich man of the 18th century had
only a horse-drawn carriage, a few
mirrors, hardly any books and no refri¬
gerator. The average man of tomor¬
row will be rich, far richer than was
the rich man of yesterday in food
products and manufactured goods. He
will be gorged with vitamins, oranges
and pineapples, aeroplanes, electric
razors, and even classical music.
B UT the rich contemporary
of Voltaire had a large house set in
spacious grounds an island of civili¬
zation surrounded by an almost virgin
Nature. This fact allows us to indulge
in some speculation on what life in
Western Europe would be like today, if
the advance in living standards since
the 18th century could have been
accomplished with a static population.
Despite his almost incalculable pri¬
mary and secondary riches, our
wealthy grandson will neither be able
to live in nor build for himself dwelling
places comparable to an 18th century
mansion simply for lack of space.
To become acquainted with their charm
and civilizing qualities, he will be
obliged to buy his ticket and join the
nostalgic and interminable throng
which in France has already been
filing over the past 15 to 30 years
through the stately homes at Vaux-le-
Vicomte, Champs, Anet, Malmaison,
Dampierre, Courance, Ormesson, Cha-
marandes...
