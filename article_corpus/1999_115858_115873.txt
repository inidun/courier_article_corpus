Chinese science has lagged for centuries. But economic reforms have given science in the
w o r l d ’s most populous nation a new life

C e n t u ries before Europe emerged from the
Middle A g e s , C h i n a ’s scientists began wo r-
king in advanced mat h e m atics and astronomy,
and had already claimed credit for inventing paper,
g u n p ow d e r , the compass, and the mechanical clock.
These great and early scientific achievements are
t o d ay well known to virtually eve ry Chinese school-
child. But these same schoolchildren know just as
clearly that China now lags behind in science and
technology.
Chinese offic i a l s , of cours e , k n ow it too. B u t
they also understand many of the reasons and they
h ave launched numerous initiat i ves to revitalize Chi-
nese science.The strategy centres on prodding scien-
tists to commercialize their research.While it may be
too early to yet call China a force in intern at i o n a l
s c i e n c e , the country has clearly become a playe r.
The impediments to scientific progress have
been both ancient and modern.With people and
their labour being more abundant than any other
r e s o u r c e , i n c e n t i ves for labour-saving scientific
innovations have traditionally been scarce.
More recently China has heaped other bu r d e n s
on its science establishment. One was the admi-
nistrative structure it adopted in the early 1950s
from the Soviet Union. By placing nearly all scien-
tific institutions under the military, the gove rn-
ment, or the central Academy of Sciences, China
replicated one of the Soviet system’s main flaws: a
structure that left impenetrable institutional walls
b e t ween those who created good science and those
who could apply it.
In the late 1950s, Mao Zedong launched 20
ye a rs of political mayhem and Chinese science
came to a virtual standstill.
Commercializing research
When the dust settled in 1978, Deng Xiaoping
was in charge and eager to re-open to the world.
Since then, China has done much to break down
walls between researchers and producers. Rather
than directly funding research from state coffers,
China has encouraged scientists to commercialize
their own results and generate their own funding for
further research.
Addressing China’s parliament in March 1999,
Premier Zhu Rongji spoke again of “the problem of
most scientific and technical personnel being
divorced from enterprises and markets”.
One of the main ways in which the gove rn m e n t
tries to encourage commercialization of scientific
research is the 11-year-old Torch Programme which
p r ovides seed capital for technology start - u p s. L o c a l
governments across China have sought to create*Journalist in Beijing (China)

“technology development zones” that offer firms
favourable conditions and tax incentive s. In addition,
the central government has promised to make it
easier for high-tech firms to be listed on the coun-
try’s stock exchanges.
But Chinese corp o r ate investment in science
and technology development is low, accounting for
only 0.39 per cent of sales vo l u m e .E ven for high-tech
e n t e rp ri s e s , the figure reaches only 0.6 per cent,or one
tenth the level of spending in developed countri e s.
Although the government encourages greater
p ri vate investment in science, gr owth has been slow.
O f ficials estimate that overall pri vate inve s t m e n t
increased only 2.9 per cent last year. Government
spending howe ver continues to ri s e . The 1999
budget calls for a 9.5 per cent increase in the cen-
tral allocations for science and technology. T h i s
brings total state and enterprise spending to more
than $14 billion, e q u i valent to roughly 1.5 per cent
of gross domestic product.
S t i l l , China is emerging as a contender. Fo r e i g n
scientists and foreign firms are increasingly eager to
co-operate with Chinese colleagues. More foreign
f i rms (including the likes of IBM) are basing
research facilities in China.The country frequently
launches communications satellites for other
n at i o n s. And China is engaging in increasingly
ambitious projects,like a $60 million scheme with
Germany to launch a one-tonne solar space teles-
cope in 2003.
More telling still is the fact that China’s own
b rightest scientists are showing more interest in
working in their own country. Since 1978, China has
sent 300,000 students abroad, the vast majori t y
for science or technology training.More than two
thirds have stayed abroad,however,and this brain
drain has cost China some of its best talent. But
according to the Ministry of Educat i o n , the number
or returning students is rising rapidly, and there are
now more students returning than leaving. n
