Brasilia is two places. One of them is Brazil’s
f u t u ristic capital, built between 1957 and
1 9 6 0 . This monumental city, dreamed up by
t own planner Lucio Costa and architect Oscar
N i e m e yer and known as the central zone (plano pilo-
t o; see draw i n g, page 31), has about 300,000 inha-
bitants (as ori ginally intended), mainly the staff of
g ove rnment ministries and foreign embassies.
Much less known to the world is the other
Brasilia,the suburbs where middle-class and poor
Brazilians live. In the original plan, these areas
were not supposed to have more residents than
the central zone. But today there are 16 satellite
cities, forming a huge urban expanse containing
1.3 million people. And one thing always stri k e s
v i s i t o rs to this metropolitan jigsaw puzzle: t h e
number of dwellings—whether elegant villas,
humble wooden shacks or residential complexe s —
t h at are surrounded by metal railings.
In front of smart houses in Núcleo Bandeirante,
the oldest satellite city 15 km south of the central
z o n e , and in the nearby towns of Ta g u at i n g a ,G u a r a
and Cru z e i r o, iron railings often rise from the pave-
ment as high as the first flo o r , giving the impression
that people are living in cages.
In the poorest and newest suburbs, like Santa
Maria (which sprang up in 1994), Recanto das
Emas and Samambaia, many people even put up
iron railings round their wooden shacks before
they’ve been completed.The same goes for new
migrants, who continue to settle, though at a slo-
wer rate than before (see factfile), on the “edge of

the edge” of the city, in country areas and even in
the neighbouring state of Goias.
The first explanation you hear for these railings
is the frequency of cri m e .“Until eight or nine ye a rs
ago, the satellite cities were safe places,” says Jesse
de Souza, a 35-year-old army officer. “But since
then,crime has shot up. Burglars don’t bother any
more with the m a n s o e s, the we a l t hy villas by the
lake in the central zone, because they’re too fa r
away and the security there is too sophisticat e d .
The buildings in the central zone are guarded
round the clock.
“But in the satellite cities, it’s much easier for
thieves. Everything gets stolen—bicycles, cars,car
radios, CD players, television sets from inside
houses.They tried to break into our house. It was
the railings that saved us.” De Souza was born in
Bahia state and lives in Ceilandia, a satellite city
of 360,000 people founded in the 1970s to rehou-
se migrants from the slums.
The private surveillance
business
M a ria de Jesus Pe r e i r a , a 40-year-old house-
wife, insisted that her husband put up iron bars
before they could be bu r g l e d . M a ny people are
unemployed in Santa Maria and theft is common.
“And now my four children can play safely,” she
s ay s , “I can even leave them outside the house,
behind the railings,while I run a few errands.”
Since the early 1980s, violence and securi t y
have been a major issue in Brasilia and even more
so in other big Brazilian cities and elsewhere in
L atin A m e ri c a . A whole industry has gr own up
around the demand for pri vate security and sales of
s e c u rity equipment—from intercoms to camera
surveillance systems—are booming.
The most extreme examples of this trend are the
condominios fe c h a d o s, p ri vate estates (houses, a p a rt-
ment blocks, shops and services) hidden behind
walls and which you can only get into by showing
an ID to watchmen at a guardpost. P r o m o t e rs have
successfully sold the idea of “peace and securi t y ”t o
h o u s e - bu ye rs. In the centre of cities and in the sub-
u r b s , such closed communities and other protected
areas are multiplying.They are, as Teresa Caldeira
describes it1, fortified enclaves for the upper and
middle classes. Their existence helps to increase
urban segr e g at i o n , with poorer people relegated to
areas which are still public but poorly equipped
with infrastructures or even derelict.
“Smile, you’re on camera,” reads a sign at the entrance to a bakery in Ceilandia.
The warning continues on the right:“Dear customers:we apologize for the inconvenience 
of these security measures. Please wait.The doors open automatically.”

In Brasilia, the central zone is itself a kind of for-
t r e s s , whose walls are inv i s i b l e . The only border
b e t ween the capital and the satellite cities, which are
situated at a safe distance, is a belt of green coun-
tryside.The guarded communities have grown up
on the edge of this green belt. But surp rising though
it may seem,the satellite cities beyond bristle with
iron railings.
Town planner Marilia Steinberg, of the Uni-
ve rsity of Brasilia, thinks the constant concern
about security masks more subtle reasons for these
measures. “Migrating to Brasilia was for all of us a
g a m b l e , an adve n t u r e ,” she say s. “I don’t know
anyone who’s stayed in the new capital or nearby
who hasn’t now got a better life.The railings protect
you but they also let you show off how quickly
yo u ’ ve gone up in the wo r l d ,m at e rially and socially.”
A wall hides everything but you can look through
railings and see the house and even what is going on
inside it.You can also see the car or cars—a sign of
success—parked in the yard.
Other observe rs agree that such reassuri n g,
effective and probably even essential defences also
play a symbolic role.The inhabitants of this other
Brasilia came to the capital to begin a life or make
a new start, dreaming of success.Yet such dreams
h ave almost been outlawe d . The building of the
central zone, from 1957 to 1960, called for the
h i ring of more than 100,000 labourers ( c a n d a n go s ),
mostly from nort h e a s t e rn Brazil. These wo r k e rs
lived in wooden shacks on the edge of the central
z o n e .After Brasilia was officially opened on A p ril 21,
1960, their makeshift houses were dubbed “illegal
s l u m s ” . But most of the wo r k e rs , proud of their pio-
n e e ring efforts to build a new capital, refused to leave
the new El Dorado. Other migrants eve n t u a l l y
arrived from all over the country and settled on
vacant land outside the central zone.
Faced with the influ x , the federal district autho-
rities decided in 1970 to improve conditions rat h e r
than trying to evict eve ryo n e . They built up the
i n f r a s t ructure of the satellite cities so as to head off
any haphazard “invasion” of the central zone.
The prevailing impression is that each migr a n t
family somehow wants to show by means of railings
t h at it has carved out a fie f d o m ,h owe ver small, a n d
t h at its dream has come true here in the federal distri c t ,
at the gates of what is known as “ o f ficial Brazil”.

Status
symbols
Brazilians of all classes want to own their own
h o m e s. Official figures show 72 per cent of all
houses are pri vately ow n e d , and gove rnment bodies
like the National Housing Bank have always encou-
raged home ow n e rship rather than paying rent,
even in the area of public housing.
But in Brasilia and in the rest of the country,
buying your own house is also a way to protect
yourself against another kind of insecurity—eco-
nomic uncertainty. Continual crises have driven
home a blunt message: that you can easily lose
your job but it’s much harder to lose your house
if you own it in a country where a government
social safety-net hardly exists. All the more rea-
son, then, to see that your house is secure and
that it keeps its value.A house is worth more with
iron bars around it than without.All houses in the
“other Brasilia” fetch a good price, even wooden
shacks.
The railings are part of this world of symbols and
va l u e s.They are also to some extent a counterpoint to
Costa and Niemeye r ’s central zone, with its ava n t -
garde concrete buildings and monuments.The inha-
bitants of the other Brasilia only go into the capital, t h e
city of the ruling class, to work there or to catch a bu s
h o m e . The railings are perhaps the response of the
poor to the social and geographical segr e g at i o n
imposed on them by a fort r e s s - c a p i t a l , a symbol of suc-
cess outside a citadel without wa l l s. n

Town planner Lucio Costa’s 1957 blueprint for Brasilia,known as the central zone (plano
piloto) was based on what he called “two axes which intersect at right angles to make a
cross”or what looks more like a large bird.Along the main axis are the city’s chief centres of
activity—with at one end the huge Square of the Three Powers (executive, legislative and
judiciary) and the Ministries’ Esplanade. On each side of the arms of the cross (or wings of
the bird) are residential areas divided into superquadras (groups of housing blocks).The idea
was to build a city without road junctions, where “the car is no longer the implacable enemy
of people”.Inside the central road intersection complex is a huge bus station called
Plataforma, which more than 400,000 people pass through every day, coming in from the
satellite cities. Brazilia is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
