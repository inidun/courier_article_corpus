ethnic history.These connections are essen-
tial for a society to be capable of caring for
its most vulnerable members. Radical indi-
vidualism does not make for the kinds of
ties that are necessary for basic decency —
not for justice, e i t h e r , which is another two
stages away.
There is often tension between the left and
m i n o r i ty ethnic groups. These groups are
criticized for alienating the majority in a labour
union, for example, by raising issues of racism or
prejudice. They are told to leave their
“ i d e n t i ty politics” at the door and join the wider
cause of the poor. How do you draw the line bet-
ween identity politics and multicultura l i s m ?
There are a couple of different issues here,
one of which is the relation between class
and racial or ethnic identity. Class identity
used to be something not all that different
from what ethnic identity is today.The wo r-
king class used to have a language,a mode
of dress, and a set of values just like any eth-
nic group in A m e rican society today. It is
the decline of the cultural cohesiveness and
d i f f e r e n t i ation of the working class that has
so gr e atly weakened the union move m e n t
in the U. S .The union movement was neve r
simply a movement of people purs u i n g
interests,it was also a movement of people
who shared a way of life—a sense of identi-
ty.
E ven so, the distinction is commonly
made between economic interests (which
are supposedly rational and bring people
You’ve written a great deal in support of multi-
culturalism. In short, you describe systems in
which individuals wear different “hats”—that of
the citizen, a religious affiliation, a union, etc.—
and forge alliances with others in different
groups. While many critics claim that multicul-
turalism dilutes the common glue (national
identity) which binds society, you maintain that
the real culprit is rampant individualism.
A c t u a l l y, multiculturalism can work in both
directions. Some cultures are coercive and
need an individualist corrective.But when
individualism is all powe r f u l , the society
needs the corr e c t i ve of community and cul-
tural cohesion.
I was recently in Je rusalem—where an
Israeli leftist intellectual turned to a visiting
A m e rican communitarian political theori s t
and said:“ For yo u , community is a dream.
For us it is a trauma.” In Israel, the stru c-
ture of religious communities is so powe r-
ful that it divides the polity in fri g h t e n i n g
way s.Ve ry strong ethnic national and reli-
gious communities are often oppressive to
m a ny of their members , most import a n t l y
to women.To be committed to a democra-
tic society of which these women are sup-
posedly equal citizens, you have to find some
way to break into these communities and
reshape their internal life.The only agent
for doing that is the state and that means
you need a strong sense of citizenship and
common values in order to foster resistan-
ce or intervention in the groups.
And what about more individualist societies?
In the U. S . , for example, individuals are
radically focused on themselve s , on their
c a r e e rs , their part n e rs or a rapidly shifting
s e ries of part n e rs h i p s.The individual has
l i t t l e , if any, sense of being obligated or
connected.In such a society, there is a real
necessity to foster and strengthen the bonds
of community. For these bonds to be
a u t h e n t i c, they have to be local or parochial
in some sense.They aren’t going to connect
e ve ry A m e rican to eve ry other A m e ri c a n .
They connect much smaller groups of
people to one another—neighbours , fa i t h
communities or people with common



MICH A EL WA LZ ER :
A USER’S GUIDE
TO DEMOCRACY
A leading American political philosopher’s 30-year quest for a more just society
together) ve rsus birth and blood, c u l t u r e
and history (which separate people). It is
a common complaint on the left, to tell
people defending identity politics,“You’re
just getting in the way of the class struggle
and a rational defence of the interests of the
p o o r.” This isn’t entirely wrong because
identity politics is often ve ry divisive . But at
the same time, identity politics is a form
of egalitarian politics which must be held in
some kind of useful tension with class.W h e n
g ay men and women can live openly in a
society that has previously forced them into
invisibility, they are not just enjoying more
freedom.The society is more egalitarian.
How can we bring new groups into society?
It is important that the naturalization pro-
cess isn’t too long or discri m i n at o ry.T h e
old price for admission—especially in coun-
t ries like France—was that you had to leave
the old culture behind.You not only beca-
me a French citizen, you were supposed to
become French. In the United Stat e s ,a nyo-
ne who has gr own up in an immigr a n t
neighbourhood has felt that there was some-
thing shameful about the old culture.We
knew that our parents or gr a n d p a r e n t s
would stay aw k wardly representat i ve of
something that we were going to and had to
leave behind.It was an imposed surrender
of identity. Now we’ve raised the question:
can we redefine the terms of assimilat i o n ,
of democratic citizenship?
To be an A m e rican citizen, I have to
l e a rn the English language, study A m e ri c a n
history and learn about the political mores
of A m e ri c a n s. But what more is required?
H ow much of my old identities, c o m m i t-
ments and loyalties can I retain and eve n
c u l t i vate and still be within the body of citi-
zens? The terms are now being renegotia-
ted to the advantage of the incomers.T h e r e
are sure to be a lot of difficulties in that
negotiation but I think the product will be
a more egalitarian society.
At the same time, there are real demands
t h at have to be made on people entering a
democratic society.You can see that in any
r e l i gious fundamentalist example any w h e-

re in the wo r l d . R e l i gious fundamentalists
want their children to attend schools tea-
ching doctrines profoundly hostile to demo-
c r atic politics.And they often want the stat e
to pay for that education.The body of citi-
zens has the right to say,“But your children
are going to vote in our elections.They are
going to determine the fate of this country
and of our children. So we will insist that
you teach your children about the values of
d e m o c r atic politics, the right of opposition,
the plurality of part i e s , the freedom of argu-
ment and the history of democracy in this
country.”
You maintain that multiculturalism can
encourage social equality. Through political
activism, groups will forge alliances while pres-
sing ahead with their own interests. Yet you
never examine the ways in which
institutionalized racism can block the path
to equality. Why do you barely even mention
the word racism?
Racism may be too broad a term.The U.S.
is an immigrant society within which

A FISH OU T
OF WAT ER
One of the United States’ most renow n e d
political philosophers, 64-year-old Michael
Walzer is like a fish out of water. “Living in the U.S.,
where there is no leftist movement or social
democratic party, I have a rarefied political exis-
tence,” he says, explaining that his main activity
is to write: books and a constant stream of articles
for left-wing reviews, most notably as editor of D i s-
s e n t, a pillar of America’s intellectual landsca p e .
Unlike so many of his entourage of 19 6 0 s
activists who fashioned themselves as profes-
sors, Walzer was not a “red diaper baby” raised
by communist parents. Experience piqued the
p o l i t i cal awareness of this philosopher. Born in the
melting pot of New York City, Walzer was steeped
in multiculturalism with his family of Jewish shop-
keepers of Eastern European origin. Life veered
left at the age of nine with the family move to a
small Pennsylvanian steel and mining tow n ,
where the strength of the local labour unions
offered a vision of activism. Walzer’s formal poli-
t i cal education began at Brandeis University —
the first Jewish-sponsored university in the U.S.
and a refuge for leftist intellectuals subjected to
the McCarthyite red-hunts of the 1950s.
Next stop for Walzer: the civil rights move-
ment. Within a week of the first sit-in at a segre-
gated lunch counter, Walzer headed south to
write about the movement for Dissent. Within
months, he was involved in organizing northern
support for the movement while pursuing his
g raduate studies in political theory at Harvard Uni-
versity. In the mid-1960s when “white agitators”
were “pushed out of the civil rights movement,”
Walzer explains that he shifted camps to take an
active role in the anti-war movement against U.S.
intervention in Viet Nam. 
“The only way to survive as an American poli-
t i cal scientist,” says Walzer, “is to have one door
outside the academy through political action.” So
throughout his teaching career at Princeton Uni-
versity and Harvard, he has used his pen as a
lance, most importantly through D i s s e n t, “now a
movement magazine without the movement,”
he says. “But we keep going in the hope that we
will encounter our necessary alter ego somew h e r e
down the line.” A.O.  n
h ave been forcibly prevented but also disa-
bled from the inside in a va riety of way s. S o
they have not achieved anything close to
equal status in the society. But the A s i a n
A m e ricans are doing fa bulously well and
yet they initially encountered a racist res-
p o n s e . And I would guess that Hispanic
A m e ricans will ove rtake both black A m e ri-
cans and Nat i ve A m e ricans in terms of eco-
nomic well-being in the near future. So the
problems of American society are the pro-
blems of the two non-vo l u n t a ry immigr a n t
groups—those did not choose, t h at were not
able to choose, to be part of this society.Yo u
can tell long stories about the diffic u l t i e s
va rious immigrant groups have encounte-
r e d . But I don’t think the story about insti-
tutionalized racism helps to explain the dif-
ference betwe e n , s ay, the Irish and the
Japanese.
You reject affirmative action programmes assu-
ring minority representation in
universities, for example. What then are the
alternatives for redistributing resources?
There is a reason for the success of affir-
m at i ve action. It is inexpensive and doesn’t
make any demand on social resources. I t

wo r l d , it would be a huge gain.Then you can
work towards higher levels of mutuality.
Most philosophers on the left seem panicked by
the rise of tribalism since 1989. Why aren’t you
so alarmed?
All forms of parochialism or particularism
are dangerous. A parent’s love for a child
can produce gross injustice and spaw n
f o rms of favo u ritism and nepotism.Yet yo u
wouldn’t want to give up on parental love.
The tri b a l , ethnic or national forms of par-
t i c u l a rism have gr e ater dangers than favo u-
ritism or nepotism because of the command
of resources and weaponry.There is some-
thing to wo rry about.But many leftists have
made the gr e at mistake of opposing eve ry
f o rm of part i c u l a ri s m .This is like setting
yourself against humanity itself.
Consider the hypothetical argument of
m a ny philosophers on the left: I suddenly
find myself in the situation where my child
and another child whom I don’t know are in
d a n g e r. If I can only rescue one, the ri g h t
thing to do, according to these philosophers ,
would be to toss a coin to decide which child
to save .But it’s not possible to turn that from
a philosophical position to a real-life
d e m a n d . It doesn’t recognize forms of
attachment that are natural to human beings.
We have to find a way of living with tri-
bal loyalties that develop historically among
groups of people.This is the 17th-century
English philosopher John Locke’s ori gi n a l
argument for tolerat i o n . Living in an age of
r e l i gious civil wa rs , he said: establish a regi-
me of tolerat i o n .G i ve each community the
right to wo rship as it wants to, in its ow n
bu i l d i n g s , without interference.With this
one thing, he said, you will end the wars.
We have to experiment with forms of
b e n e fits a small, mostly yo u n g e r ,s u b s e c t i o n
of black A m e ricans and creates a small,
r ather vulnerable, black middle class.At the
same time,it avoids the kind of investment
t h at would be necessary for improving the
l e vel of inner city schools, or for changi n g
the racial hierarchy in the U.S.
The rectific ation of inequalities requires
a political movement far bigger than the
black community. But gi ven the political
context in the U. S . , there isn’t going to be
in the near future a significant redistri bu-
tion of resources to individuals. H owe ver it
might be possible to organize a redistribu-
tion to gr o u p s. For example, a signific a n t
p a rt of the A m e rican we l fare state is run by
r e l i gious communities through hospitals,
n u rsing homes, and day-care centres.W h e n
the Republican majority in Congress began
cutting the we l fare budget in 1995, the lou-
dest screams of protest came from the cha-
ritable organizations of the Lutherans,
C atholics and Jews—the three most suc-
cessful groups in getting money for we l fa-
re services from the state—which prov i d e d
in fact something like 60 per cent of their
charitable budgets.
W hy shouldn’t black Baptists control
the same share of tax money as white Luthe-
rans or Catholics or Jews? These other
groups have gr e ater organizational powe r ,
and a long history of collecting this money—
so it’s going to take a deliberate political
decision to make it available to black Bap-
t i s t s. I am not religious myself but I reco-
gnize that these religious institutions are
socially useful.We saw this in the 1960s
when the whole civil rights movement was
run out of the Baptist churches in the sou-
t h e rn tow n s. N ow they might serve as agents
of redistribution.
Tolerance is becoming a buzz-word, sometimes
sounding like a polite way of accepting the
u n a c c e p table. Shouldn’t we strive towards
something more?
The crucial thing is not tolerance but tole-
r at i o n .Tolerance is a mental attitude bu t
t o l e r ation is a set of arr a n g e m e n t s. I think
t h at the attitudes matter less and will come
in time if you get the politics right—if yo u
find the right regime of tolerat i o n . T h i s
reminds me of a Puritan sermon (from the
1630s or 40s) against divo r c e . It said  sim-
p l y : if you hold the estranged couple toge-
ther long enough, something will happen
t h at makes the marriage possible. I don’t
b e l i e ve that about marri a g e , but it may be
t rue for the less intimate coexistence of
gr o u p s. If you force Greeks and Turks to live
together for 200 ye a rs , there is going to be
commerce and friendship and even inter-
m a rriage across the borders—if the politi-
cal regime is successful and imposes peace.
My stress is not on mutual respect but on
peaceful coexistence. S t a rt there. In today ’s
“The conquered Native Americans and the enslaved black Americans… have not achieved anything close to
equal status in American societ y.”
‘Give each community
the right to worship 
as it wants to,
in its own buildings,
without 
interference. 
With this one thing, 
you will end the wars.’

so quickly. Somebody has to be able to move

are not going to eliminate tribal feelings.
Politics is the art of finding arr a n g e m e n t s

You once wrote, “We become social critics 
naturally, by elaborating on existing moralities
and telling stories about a society more just
than our own.” You have been telling stories for
more than 30 years. How have they changed?
It has gotten harder to tell stories about
societies more just than your ow n . N o t
because my own society has gotten more just
but because there has been such a massive
loss of faith in the altern at i ve visions that we
used to refer ours e l ves to.The democrat i c
left longed for the collapse of communism.

r e gimes would immediately open oppor-

tunities for a “third way”—a socialism that
d i d n ’t rely on the state but encompassed a
decentralized and highly part i c i p at i ve form
of democratic politics, with wo r k e rs ’c o n t r o l
of fa c t o ries and new social movements like
feminism and env i r o n m e n t a l i s m .
But instead of opening this new pat h ,
1989 unexpectedly brought a crisis of fa i t h
in any sort of radical altern at i ve .The stori e s
of more just societies now sound like uto-
pian fa n t a s i e s. So before we can start telling
those stories again, we ’ ve got to argue that
there are forms of life different from what
we see around us which are still sociologi-
cally or economically feasible.
I don’t mean to sound gri m . Po l i t i c a l
o p p o rtunities often take shape in unexpec-
ted way s.We always misjudge the time inter-
va l s. 1989 came sooner than we thought and
the opportunities may come lat e r.
Maybe you’re also a bit nostalgic for the excite-
ment and activism of the 1960s and 70s. What
about the new forms of opposition developing
at the international level around a wide range
of single issues—from genetically modified
crops to human rights abuse?
(With a broad smile and a chuckle.) Yo u
m ay be always nostalgic for those moments
of exhilarat i o n . But there certainly are new
f o rms of organization with groups functio-
ning in a space that is beginning to be cal-
led intern ational civil society.They recru i t
m e m b e rs from different countries and act
across boundaries even though they are
most often trying to bring pressure on spe-
c i fic national gove rn m e n t s. But it is not clear
t h at these organizations can be fully part i-
c i p at i ve and democrat i c. Instead of active
m e m b e rs , they have a dues-paying mem-
b e rship which supports the work of a 
highly mobile, professional staff. Po l i t i c a l
activism often amounts to little more than
signing a cheque.I am not sure that this is
the kind of activism that makes for demo-
cratic decision-making.
How do you account for this decline in acti-
vism?
In the U. S . , for example, political part i e s
used to operate at many different leve l s —
the stat e , city and even the precinct (neigh-
b o u r h o o d ) .When you have a party art i c u-
l ated with activists at eve ry leve l , you can be
pretty sure of that group of people’s abili-
ty to hold leadership responsible.The broa-
der the activism, the wider the responsibi-
lity of the leadership.
To d ay, the precinct party offices are
g o n e .You have a candidate and an entou-
rage of publicity and make-up people who
function like a commando unit.They des-
cend on a place in time to make the eve n i n g
TV news and then depart .There is no local
structure to hold them responsible.
An altern at i ve might be a civil society
a rt i c u l ation of democratic politics. I n s t e a d
of relying on party structures which are so
far removed from local communities, c i t i-
zens might form associations through
c h u r c h e s , unions or philanthropic gr o u p s
to press for their demands and hold politi-
cal leaders responsible.
When describing the “good life”, most
philosophers offer sweeping reflections
on universal principles and ideals. Yet you
focus strictly on the nuts and bolts of political
arrangements. Why?
I t ’s a feature of We s t e rn philosophical, r e l i-
gious and more recently political tradition
to focus on the good society and the good
life where that definite article is ve ry defi-
nite and singular in character. Monotheis-
tic religion with its notion of the messianic
kingdom contri butes to that singular
conception which the left inheri t e d . M o s t
people who talk nowa d ays about the good
society are on the left.
I have never believed that there could be
either a definite or a singular picture of the
good life.You could tell stories of good live s.
You could point to people who had live d
we l l .You could describe a va riety of good
societies in move m e n t s , communities and
even states. But given the immense variety
of human beings and the extraordinary crea-
tivity of humanity, it never seemed plausible
to think there can be one way of living, o r
one correct form of social organization.n
