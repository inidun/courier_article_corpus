WOMEN
STUDENTS
STILL
OUTNUMBERED
In 1972, out of every 100
students enrolled in higher
education courses throughout the
world only 39 were women as
against 61 men. In Africa women
constitute only 23 per cent
of the student population,
in Asia (excluding China) 28
per cent, in Oceania 32 per cent,
in Latin America 36 per cent,
in North America 42 per cent,
and in Europe 44 per cent.
On the following pages we show
the increasing, but in most cases
still unsatisfactory, number
of young women in various
countries and regions who are
studying to enter professions
such as medicine, science, law,
the arts, etc. Our figures are
taken from a Unesco study
entitled " Higher Education :
International Trends, 1960-1970 ".
