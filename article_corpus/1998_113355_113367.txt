Vision and action 
for the next century
Challenges await a World Conference on 
Higher Education in the 21st century,
convened by UNESCO in Paris from 5 to 9 October
Is world mobilization in favour of higher edu-
c ation justified while millions of adults and
children are illiterate and lack access to basic
e d u c ation? Is it reasonable to be concerned with
the development of unive rsities in regions where
p ove rt y, sickness and hunger are rife? T h e s e
questions need to be asked since organizat i o n s
such as the World Bank are urging deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to invest in pri m a ry and secondary
e d u c ation on the grounds that they offer a better
r e t u rn and contri bute more to social equality
than higher educat i o n . UNESCO believe s , h owe-
ve r , t h at neglect of higher education could
d e p ri ve the countries of the South of an essential
tool for their development and for strengthening
their autonomy.
UNESCO has therefore decided to convene a
world conference on higher educat i o n .By doing so
it is inviting countries to regard higher educat i o n
not as a burden on state bu d g e t s , but as a long-term
investment that is beneficial to economic competi-
t i ve n e s s , cultural development and social cohesion,
as well as playing a major role in training pri m a ry and
secondary school teachers.
The World Bank and other institutions cast
doubt on the economic cost-effectiveness of uni-
ve rsities and their efficiency as vehicles of social
c h a n g e . This criticism is not totally unfounded.
The goal of the world conference is to put for-
ward substantial measures of unive rsity reform
(redefinition of their mission, o p e r ations and
funding) via action plans designed to enable
higher education to play a central role in
c o n t e m p o r a ry society.
The conference is the result of a long process
of intern ational consultation and refle x i o n . B e t-
ween November 1996 and A p ril 1998, H ava n a ,

be held wholly responsible 
for graduate unemployment 
nor for the gap between

nal conferences which examined trends in higher
e d u c ation worldwide and defined local needs.
D u ring the same period a wide range of nongo-
ve rnmental organizations active in educat i o n
took part in debates on specific themes. T h e i r
p u rpose was to gather the opinions of all concer-
ned in order to prepare a declaration and a plan
of action focusing on four key areas: r e l e va n c e ,
q u a l i t y, i n t e rn ational co-operat i o n , and manage-
ment and funding.
Accountable to society
A framework for pri o rity action proposes,
through concrete means, a “new unive rsity com-
p a c t ” to redefine the relations between higher
e d u c ation and the stat e , civil society and the eco-
n o my. It insists on the democratic nature of
higher learning and its critical and future-ori e n-
ted function, and the need for it to be accoun-
table to society. It opens for discussion questions
of funding and notes the importance of public
s u p p o rt for higher educat i o n , as well as relat i o n s
with the state including institutional autonomy
and academic freedom. Such a pact should help
t r a n s f o rm the higher education institutions of the
t we n t y - f i rst century into centres of excellence
and of the advance of knowledge which respond
to gr owing student demand and the specific eco-
nomic and cultural needs of each regi o n . In short
it sees higher education as playing a key role in
measures designed to promote sustainable and
equitable deve l o p m e n t . ■
