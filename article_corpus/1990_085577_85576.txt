ANNA AKHMATOVA
'MOTHER COURAGE' OF POETRY
BY YELENA BYELYAKOVA
48
IHE life of Anna Akhmatova was a
tragic one. Although she had her mo¬
ments of glory she also experienced
terrible humiliations.
She was born In 1889, and her
youth coincided with an extraordi¬
nary literary flowering, the silver age
of Russian poetry. Her first volume of
verses, Vecher ("Evening") was pub¬
lished in 1912. It was followed two
years later by Chyotki ("Rosary")
which was reprinted eight times and
made her name. The themes of most
of her early poems are meetings and
separations, love and solitude. Their
style Is rigorous, lucid, laconic.
Her poetry was read throughout
Russia, and the critics predicted a bril¬
liant future for this "Russian Sappho".
She published regularlyBelaya
staya (1917; "The White Flock"),
Podorozhnik (1921; "Plantain"), and
Anno Domini MCMXXI (1922).
Unlike many Intellectuals In her
circle, Akhmatova did not emigrate
after the Revolution of October 1917.
Yet In 1923 her work ceased to be
published. The official view was that
her lyrics were alien to the new
generation of readers produced by
the Revolution. Fame was followed
by oblivion: for seventeen years her
name vanished from literature.
Life had other trials in store for
her. In 1921 her first husband, the
poet Nikolay Gumllyov, was executed
after being accused of taking part In
a counter-revolutionary conspiracy.
Her son, the orientalist Lev Gumilyov,
was arrested In 1935 and eventually
spent fourteen years In prison and
exile In Siberia. Her third husband, the
art historian Nikolay Punin, died In
prison.
Yet Anna Akhmatova continued
to write. The anguish she shared with
thousands of other women who
queued outside the prisons of Lenin¬
grad Inspired the cycle Rekvlem
(1935-1940; "Requiem"), which tells
Portrait of Anna Akhmatova (1914), by Nathan Altman (1889-1970).
the tragic story of a mother separated
from her only son. She visited her
friend the poet Osip Mandelstam,
exiled In Voronezh, and wrote poems
filled with foreboding about his Im¬
minent death. She denounced the
Illegal and arbitrary acts which were
being committed In her country, and
exposed the cruelty of Stalin and his
entourage. Fearing arrest, she memo¬
rized her verses rather than write
them down.
In 1940 several poems she had
written before the Revolution were
published. Later, patriotic lyrics she
wrote during the war were published
in several newspapers and
magazines.
But In 1946 she became the
main target of an Ideological cam¬
paign launched against the artistic
and literary intelligentsia by the Cen¬
tral Committee of the Communist
Party, which passed a resolution
condemning the literary reviews
Zvezda ("The Star") and Leningrad
for publishing her poetry, which was
branded as "bourgeois and deca¬
dent", "devoid of an Ideological mes¬
sage" and "alien to the Soviet
people".
The entire printrun of her most
recent collection of poems was des¬
troyed and she was expelled from the
Union of Soviet Writers. For ten years
she was again ostracized. Not until
the thaw which followed the death
of Stalin was she reinstated in the
Writers' Union and allowed to pub¬
lish again. By now the interest In her
poetry was immense.
In the 1 960s Akhmatova became
world famous. Her work was trans¬
lated Into English, French, German,
Italian, Czech, Bulgarian and many
other languages. Many articles,
books and studies were published
about her poetry. In 1964 she
travelled to Italy where she was
awarded the Etna-Taormlna interna¬
tional poetry prize, and In the follow¬
ing year she received an honorary
doctorate from Oxford University.
Anna Akhmatova died on 5
March 1 966. As the years go by the
interest In her work continues to
grow. Her collections of poems are
often reprinted, and unpublished
works are coming to light, Including
some fine patriotic poems which
were virtually unknown in the Soviet
Union until recently. Rekvlem, which
had appeared In the West In the
1960s, was not published In the
Soviet Union until 1987. In 1988, the
Communist Party resolution against
the reviews Leningrad and Zvezda
was officially rescinded and In 1989
Zvezda devoted an entire issue to the
centenary of Anna Akhmatova's
birth.
The city of Leningrad, which
played a major part in her life, was
the centre of the centenary celebra¬
tions In June 1989. A memorial
museum was opened on the Fontan-
ka Embankment, where for over
thirty years she had lived and com¬
posed some of her most tragic
poems. Conferences were organized
by the Russian Literature Institute of
the USSR Academy of Sciences and
the Leningrad Writers' Organization.
At literary and musical evenings lead¬
ing poets read her works and poems
dedicated to her by contemporaries
Including Aleksandr Blok, Marina
Tsvetayeva, Osip Mandelstam, and
Boris Pasternak. Song cycles of her
lyrics set to music by Prokofiev and
Slonlmsky were also performed.
The anniversary provided the
opportunity to pay a fitting tribute to
one of the greatest poets of the
century.
