D m³/year. Due to lateral underflow 
from Saudi Arabia, both ground-
water quality and quantity are de-
teriorating as more saline water is 
being pumped for irrigation pur-
poses. 
To face these challenges, Kuwait 
has for a longtime imported fresh-
water from Shat El-Arab in Iraq. 
This policy was officially endorsed 
by the state in 1939 with the foun-
dation of the Kuwait Water Import 
Company. After the first oil boom 
in the early 1940s, Kuwait began 
its search to diversify its reserves. 
In 1953 it built the country’s first 
water desalination plant boasting 
a total output capacity of 4,545 
ispite a booming economy and 
skyrocketing oil prices, Kuwait 
cannot avoid the challenge of wa-
ter. Its natural resources are some 
of the most limited in the world. 
While some annual precipitation 
does exist, the UN’s Food and 
Agriculture Organization estimates 
that rainwater averages have fallen 
to 104 - 134 mm in comparison 
to the 176 mm for previous years. 
Furthermore, only a small part 
of this water percolates into the 
ground. The desert climate and the 
nature of the soil bring a high rate 
of evaporation. 
Groundwater inflow in Kuwait has 
been estimated at about 20 million 
m³/day. The country now has six 
plants with an annual capacity of 
231 million m³.
Another avenue they have explored 
is that of recycling used water. To-

                             desalinization, recycling, importation: 
               confronted with a virtual absence of water resources, 
Kuwait has been forced to find solutions to face its water shortage problems.
Dry earth is virtually impermeable to rainwater.

re-use and desalination, 
are being increasingly used 
and new technologies 
such asartificial re-charge are 
also becoming more common.”

day, the quantity of treated and re-
used wastewater stands at around 
52 million m³, which is mainly used 
for irrigation. 
Recycling is a priority
A recent study conducted by the 
Kuwait University and the Petro-
chemical Industries Company (PIC) 
indicates that up to 70 percent 
of water used by manufacturing 
industries can be recycled. The 
practice of recycling has become 
a priority as a result of population 
increase resulting from economic 
prosperity. 
To face growing demand, a new 
treatment plan was inaugurat-
ed in Sabiyyah in March 2005. 
Since then, water production has 
reached 182,000 litres per inhab-
itant according to recent studies. 
However, this ambitious project 
did not stop Kuwaiti officials from 
making their repeated calls for wa-
ter conservation. Recent studies 
show that the share of water per 
inhabitant in the region should 
plunge from the 1960’s average 
of 3,500 m³ of water to only 650 
m³ in 2025. Around 80 percent 
of the Arab world already suffers 
from drought.
Despite numerous awareness 
campaigns in Kuwait, water con-
tinues to be perceived as a free 
resource. With each household 
paying a relatively meager 20 to 
30 dollars per month for water, 
who would think the country was 
suffering of a water problem? 
Benefits from subsidies only ac-
centuate the problem. 
Considering water 
a free resource
A recent effort to overcome water 
shortage came with the holding 
of the Seventh Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) Conference on 
Water Management on November 
22, 2005. 
The head of the Council of the 
Kuwaiti Institute for Scientific Re-
sources, M. Al-Hamad, empha-
sized that increasing consumption 
of water in Gulf member states 
increased the depletion of water 
and financial resources. These 
states currently spend millions of 
dollars to establish water plants 
to meet the increase in water de-
mand. 
Another issue raised at the con-
ference was the call for the estab-
lishment of a water grid joining the 
six GCC member states (Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, 
Bahrain and the United Arab Emir-
ates). 
In the meantime, Kuwait must 
continue to rely on water desali-
nation and treatment, alongside 
plans for water import from Iran. 
Although this small state has one 
of the highest per-capita incomes 
in the world, it will not be easy to 
resolve this crucial problem.
