To probe and obtain samples of the earth's mantle (diagram,
left), U.S. scientists plan to drill through the overlying crust
under the ocean where it is relatively thin (about two and a
half miles). Their objective is the crust-mantle boundary,
named the Mohorovicic discontinuity after the Yugoslav
scientist who discovered it (see page 4), and called "Moho"
for short hence the name "Mohole" for this project.

USIS phoios Above, technicians in the test-drilling ship inspect tho
"guide shoe" which protects tho deep-soa drill pipo
and limits bending near tho ocean surface Through¬
out the drilling the ship's pilot had to keep tho vossol
in the centre of a ring of buoys. If tho waves had
pushed it beyond these limits tho drill would havo
snapped. Below, scientists examino tho first coros
brought up from 1,000 feet below tho ocoan bottom.
Test borings for the Mohole Project were made
off California coast from this ship, the Cuss I,
whose diamond studded drills had first to be lowered
through over two miles of water before they bit into
the ocean floor. To keep it in position over the drill
hole the vessel had four outboard motors. Behind
its derrick three miles of drill pipe were stacked.
