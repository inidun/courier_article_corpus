From guitar to qanun
when I was in my teens I
began to learn the classical
guitar, which pianists and
violinists tend to regard as a
somewhat marginal instrument
because its intimate sound is
more suited to solo performances
than orchestral work. Its
repertoire is extraordinarily
eclectic, but the dominance of
Hispanic folk music made me
familiar with particularly
effective kinds of musical
intermixture very early in my
career.
During a long stay in the
Caribbean I studied jazz
harmonies and Brazilian and
Afro-Cuban rhythms. This
liberated me from the rigid
written repertoire of my classical
training and allowed me to
improvise within a framework of
harmonic rules which though
complex were much less
restrictive. I felt that I was
getting rid of the heavy chains
that bound me to repetitive
exercises which were alien to the
essence of music and left no
room for either emotion or
imagination.
I already thought that living
forms of music, both popular
and classical, had an
incomparable vitality and
expressive force. I became
interested in other types of
improvisation, and as I
progressed I composed a number
of contemplative works laced
with Ravelian dissonances and
Afro-Cuban, Brazilian and Indian
rhythms.
I soon learned that the
spontaneous creation of a
rhythmic and melodic idiom was
not exclusive to jazz but was the
basis of traditions such as that of
classical Arab-Islamic music,
which does not suffer from its
lack of a harmonic structure but
celebrates the divine unity of a
spare and graceful monody, pure

meaning, which the prolixity of
harmony would disguise and
deaden.
I discovered this Arab music
by chance, while listening to a
recording by Munir Bachir, one
of the great masters of the
qanun. I had already come across
the taqsim, an Arab-Turkish
form of improvisation, but the
qanun was a revelation.
For the next six years, I
worked on both the guitar and
the qanun. Then, in 1984, the
Tunisian singer Hedi Guella
invited me to play in the first
part of his show at the Carthage
festival, in front of 7,000 people.
The public were indifferent to
my performance with the guitar,
but they greeted my qanun
playing with enthusiasm. From
that moment on, I knew that I
would dedicate myself to the
qanun.
Ever since then my work has
had something in common with
that of a musicologist. Apart
from the daily ritual of practice,
I have studied at length the
history of Islamic music and
civilization, concentrating
primarily on the work of the
great Orientalists. I have
rediscovered many vocal and
instrumental pieces, both
structured and improvised,
which were useful for
comparative study, but also as
the basis of arrangements for the
Al Kindi ensemble which I was
then setting up, and as additions
to my repertoire as a soloist.
I explored different classical
traditions: the Syrian mwwashah,
the Egyptian dawr, the Iraqi
maqam, the Persian
tshaharmezrab, the Turkish
bashraf. Each of these opened up
a new dimension for me: the
lack of orchestral ornamentation
and the virtuosity of Persian
music; the Bedouin ruggedness
and majesty of Iraqi music; the
melodramatic cadences of
Egyptian music; the mystical
depth and surgical precision of
Turkish music; and the multiple
facets of the Andalusian music of
North Africa.
My compositions are
impregnated with all these
diverse musical forms. The
Western influence is also present,
although in small doses these
days. One of the blends I like
best can be heard in Wash
Bagdadi, a piece for the qanun in
which I introduced Persian
musical effects into Iraqi
rhythms and added hints of
Kurdish phrasing and the Somali
pentatonic scale.
I have however composed one
polyphonic work, inspired by
the sober romanticism of Erik
Satie, and on occasion I have
enjoyed playing in iconoclastic
mixed sessions. I have played the
qanun with the Paris Symphony
Orchestra and the chorus of
Radio France on film
soundtracks, with Arab-French
rock singers, and in a
performance of the medieval
music of Guillaume de Machaut
and Adam de la Halle.
But the most extraordinary
experience I have ever had was
when I performed a work by the
contemporary composer Francis
Bayer with an ensemble made up
exclusively of traditional
instrumentsthe Tibetan
trumpet, the Turkish ney, the
shenay of Benares, the Japanese
koto, the Indian sitar, the
Balinese gamelan, the rain rod of
the Australian Aborigines, the
gong of the opera of Beijing, the
Iranian zarb, and the Indian
tabla. For someone like me, who
seeks musical marriages of all
kinds, this was something quite
unique.
