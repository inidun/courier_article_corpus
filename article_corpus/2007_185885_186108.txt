hree-year-old Miguel lived in Los 
Angeles, California, with his moth-
er, who faced chronic illness, de-
pression and poverty. Despite this, 
she brought Miguel to the doctor 
for his well-child visits. Each time 
they left the clinic, Miguel clutched 
a brand-new Reach Out and Read 
book. Miguel and his mother cher-
ished those books. Two years later, 
Miguel is the number one reader in 
his kindergarten class. He loves to 
read and he looks set to become 
a lifelong learner. Miguel is cer-
tain to face many obstacles, but 
Reach Out and Read has brought 
hope to his life. His success, says 
his paediatrician, is a testament to 
the power of Reach Out and Read 
to help families break the cycle of 
poverty. 
This year, thousands of doctors 
will give 4.6 million new books to 
2.8 million infants, toddlers and 
preschoolers from low-income 
families at check-ups and advise 
their parents about the importance 
of reading. The only American lit-
eracy programme featured at the 
recent White House Conference 
on Global Literacy, Reach Out 
and Read doctors distribute new 
books at more than 3000 paedi-
atric practices, hospitals, clinics 
and health centres throughout 
all 50 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. To date, 
American doctors have given out 
more than 20 million books. Inter-
national programmes modelled 
on Reach Out and Read have 
been started in Bangladesh, Italy, 
Israel, the Philippines, England, 
and Canada.
Language and health
Reach Out and Read focuses on 
the most vulnerable children, 6 
months to 5 year-olds living in or 
near poverty. Today, Reach Out and 
Read helps about 25% of Ameri-
ca’s most impoverished children. 
      one of uNeSCo’s two Confucius Prizes for literacy was attributed this year 
            to the u.S. organization, reach out and read, for its work with health care providers 
                       to reach low-income children at risk of dropping out of school.
And the number grows daily. Each 
child who participates in Reach Out 
and Read starts kindergarten with a 
home library of up to 10 books and 
a parent who has heard, at every 
well-child visit, about the impor-
tance of books and reading. Doc-
tors participating in Reach Out and 
Read distribute carefully selected 
new, developmentally and cultur-
ally appropriate books – starting 
with board books for babies and

books for preschoolers. Bilingual 
books are available in 12 languag-
es. Some sites also have volunteer 
readers who read to children in the 
waiting rooms. 
Research shows that the pro-
gramme really works. Parents 
who get books and literacy coun-
selling from their doctors and 
nurses are more likely to read to 
their young children, read to them 
more often, and provide more 
books at home. Low-income chil-
dren exposed to Reach Out and 
Read show improved language 
development, a critical compo-
nent of school readiness. Chil-
dren score four to eight points 
higher on vocabulary tests, giving 
2-year-olds a six-month head start 
developmentally. Reach Out and 
Read is endorsed by the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics. 
Reach Out and Read was co-
founded by Barry Zuckerman, 
M.D., a 6’5” (1.95 m) gentle giant 
who has great warmth, passion 
and unwavering determination 
that all children start life with 
books in their home and a parent 
who reads to them. 
“Reach Out and Read started 
as a single programme at Bos-
ton City Hospital [now Boston 
Medical Centre] with the goal of 
making literacy promotion a stan-
dard part of paediatric primary 
care,” says Zuckerman, Board 
Chair and CEO of the organiza-
tion, who is also Professor and 
Chairman of the Department of 
Paediatrics of the Boston Medi-
cal Centre at Boston University 
School of Medicine. “Today, we 
reach millions of at-risk children 
in the U.S. and serve as a model 
for programmes around the world. 
But we are far from reaching our 
goal of providing books to every 
child and literacy counselling to 
every parent living in poverty.”
Taking advantage  
of existing structures
Although, by international stan-
dards, the U.S. is considered a rich 
country, 35% of American children 
start school without the language 
skills necessary to learn to read. 
“One of the tremendous advantag-
es of Reach Out and Read,” says 
Perri Klass, M.D., Medical Director 
of Reach Out and Read and Pro-
fessor of Journalism and Paediat-
rics at New York University, “is that 
it takes advantage of the existing

health care structures, which are to 
be found in virtually every country 
in the world to deliver basic health 
care to children.” 
Nearly 46,000 medical provi- 
ders have been trained by Reach 
Out and Read since its founding in 
1989. The programme now spends 
a total of over US$30 million per 
annum on its activities across the 
U.S.A. and receives support from 
the U.S. Department of Education, 
as well as 12 states and cities. It 
also receives donations from cor-
porations, foundations, and indi-
viduals. 
While doctors give a lot of impor-
tant advice at check-ups, few inter-
ventions have been the object of as 
much research that substantiates 
their ability to impact behaviour at 
home. “Reach Out and Read has 
one of the strongest records of 
peer-reviewed research support of 
any primary care intervention,” Dr. 
Klass says. “Because we give fami-
lies the books, we provide the tool 
to follow the advice.” 
“Improved language is the single 
strongest predictor for school suc-
cess. Reach Out and Read is work-
ing to reach parents and children 
at the critical stage before they 
enter kindergarten so children en-
ter school prepared for success in 
reading.”
