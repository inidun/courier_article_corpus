LA RGE DA MS — T HE END 
OF AN ERA ?
◗ Peter Coles
Growing debate about the rights and wrongs of large-scale dam construction focuses 
on the very meaning of development
■
At the last count,there were around
40,000 large dams on the wo r l d ’s
ri ve rs , according to the Intern at i o n a l
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD).1
Most of them were built in the last 35 ye a rs.
A further 1,600 are under construction in
over 40 countri e s. But is the era of bu i l d i n g
ve ry large dams coming to an end? Pres-
sure groups of displaced rural communities
and ecology organizations have already dis-
rupted dam building in the United States
and India.
This coming August the independent
World Commission on Dams (WCD), set
up in 1998 by the World Bank and IUCN
(the World Conservation Union) to look at
the long term developmental effectiveness
of dams, will publish its conclusions after
t wo ye a rs of fa c t - fin d i n g . P r e l i m i n a ry
r e p o rts to the Commission, whose 12 com-
missioners span most groups of stakehol-
ders, are already suggesting that the deve-
lopment benefits may not be all they
p r o m i s e d . And that the people who gain
least from dams are those already at the
bottom of the socio-economic pile.
“Dams are both a technology option
and a development choice,” said South
A f rican Minister of Education and W C D
Chair Professor Kader Asmal last Decem-
ber. By focusing on dams as a reflection of
societal needs, he said,WCD is inevitably
confronting the very meaning of “develop-
m e n t ” . “ We are tackling the question of
h ow know l e d g e ,i n t e r e s t s , and values deter-
mine the context within which dams are
either chosen or rejected as the preferr e d
o p t i o n , and how such decisions can best be
n e g o t i ated between competing interests.”
Pa rt of W C D ’s remit is to find out what
these interests are. They might, f o r
1. ICOLD, founded in 1928, seeks to advance the
art and science of dams. It has some 6,000
individual members and National Committees in
80 countries. ICOLD defines a large dam as one
that is over 15 metres high.
On the rise: construction of a dam as part of the giant Three Gorges project on China’s Yangtze River.

e x a m p l e , include the needs of industry and
urban residents ve rsus agriculture and ru r a l
p o p u l at i o n s , o r , more cy n i c a l l y, the dam
i n d u s t ry ve rsus those interested in inter-
m e d i ate technology or traditional solutions
to development challenges.
For ICOLD, the links between dam
building and development are obvious.Two
prerequisites for the development of a
n ation are energy and wat e r , s ays one
ICOLD paper. But since these resources
are most scarce precisely where demand is
rising most rapidly, dams have become
almost synonymous with deve l o p m e n t .S o,
while dam building in developed countri e s
has slowed to a trickle in the last decade,
major constructions are underway in indus-
t rializing countri e s , like China’s massive
Three Gorges project and India’s Narm a d a
Valley Development project (see art i c l e
below). Over half of all large dams (more
than 22,000) are in China,while India has
become the third largest dam constructor
in the world,with over 3,000 large dams.
Smoothing
the flood-and-drought cycle
Although dams produce power without
c o n t ri buting to the greenhouse effect—
about 20 per cent of world electricity and
s e ven per cent of all energy, according to
ICOLD—their pri m a ry purpose is wat e r
c o n t r o l . R e s e rvo i rs can provide dri n k i n g
wat e r , while smoothing out the “boom and
bu s t ” cycles of flooding and drought
brought about by monsoons.They do this
by storing excess water in reservo i rs duri n g
the rainy season and releasing it in times of
s c a r c i t y. But by far the gr e atest use of dams
is to supply irri g ation water for agri c u l t u r e .
In developing countries, according to the
United Nations Environment Programme
( U N E P ) , i rri g ation accounts for over 75
per cent of water consumption. In some
countries,the figure is over 90 per cent.
At present, according to ICOLD, one
third of all food produced already comes
from irrigated land. And the organization
sees irrigation as the only way to meet the
future increase in demand, expecting 80
per cent of food production to come from
irrigated land by 2025.
But the case for irri g ation is far from
c l e a r - c u t . According to the Intern at i o n a l
Rivers Network (IRN),a non-governmen-
tal organizat i o n , i rri g ation canals cause
e u t r o p h i c at i o n2. M e a n w h i l e , the crops pro-
duced are often for export and do not feed
the sectors of the population that are
expanding most rapidly—the poor. A n d
2. Eutrophication is a phenomenon occurring in
stagnant water, whereby vegetation proliferates
and the water’s oxygen content is reduced.
i r o n i c a l l y, these are the ve ry people who
lose their homes, fa rms and live l i h o o d s
when river valleys are flooded by dams.
E ven before a dam has produced a single
watt of powe r , or litre of irri g ation wat e r ,
tens of thousands of people may need to be
e va c u ated from the ri ver valleys to make way
for the reservo i r. Wo r l d - w i d e , the flo o d e d
valleys that accompany large dams have for-
ced at least 30 million people to abandon
their homes since the 1930s, according to
I R N. In the past, g ove rnments have seen the
human cost of displacement as an inevitable
“side effect”of deve l o p m e n t .N ow these dis-
placed people are fighting to be heard.
“ Past experi e n c e s ,” s ays one report to the
C o m m i s s i o n ,“ s h ow that typical resettlement
p r o grammes are: often prepared late in the
project cy c l e ; under fin a n c e d ; devised using
i n s u f ficient understanding of people’s social,
c u l t u r a l ,e c o n o m i c, p s y c h o l o gical conditions
and environment in which they were loca-
t e d ; implemented with a ve ry short time
f r a m e , with limited objective of restoring pre-
vious income leve l s , and too often term i n at e d
e ven before all displaced people were resett-
led and rehabilitat e d .” One question that
WCD will be trying to answer in its fin a l
r e p o rt is whether the loss of an ancient ru r a l
lifestyle is the inevitable price a nation has to
p ay to achieve security for the majori t y.
Some of those opposed to large-scale
dam construction, like IRN, see the deve-
lopment that dams supposedly promote as
s p u rious in any case, e ven for the largely
urban communities who benefit . In its
publicity for Silent Rive rs, a book by Pat ri c k
McCully that IRN co-published, the NGO
s ays that “ m a s s i ve dams are much more
than simply machines to generate electri c i t y
and store wat e r. They are concrete, r o c k
and earth expressions of the dominant
ideology of the technological age: icons of
economic development and scientific pro-
gress to match nuclear bombs and motor
cars.”
Other critics suggest that the dam
i n d u s t ry simply turned to developing coun-
t ries because the market in deve l o p e d
countries had almost dried up. In the past,
loans from the World Bank and internatio-
nal aid programmes indirectly kept the
multi-billion dollar industry aflo at , w h i l e
s c o ring lucrat i ve trade and technology
transfer deals for the lending nations. But
n ow, under mounting opposition from
pressure groups,the U.S.and many Euro-
pean gove rnments have declined to become
involved in projects like the Three Gorges
and Narmada dams.
With power still mainly in the hands of
the dam builders,the coming WCD report
might at least provide guidelines on how to
include the dispossessed among those who
b e n e fit , while minimizing the extent of irr e-
versible damage. ■
