Songs
of
the
pirogue
by Francis M''Boulé
FRANCIS M'BOULE, of the Cameroon, is a
research worker at the University of Pans VI. A
sociologist and psychologist, he was formerly
associate professor of medical sociology at New
York State University and guest researcher at the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
THE pirogue, or dugout canoe, is a
central element in the life of the
Duala people who live in the coas¬
tal region of Cameroon, on the banks of
the network of rivers that come together
in the Suelaba estuary before spilling out
into the Atlantic Ocean.
Indeed, the pirogue embodies every
aspect of Duala culture. It is a utilitarian
object, providing a means of transport
for people and for merchandise as well as
being the fishermen's tool. It is a sym¬
bolic object that engenders myths and
affirms the pre-eminence of the God of
Water. It is a link that binds men together
since, once they have settled in an area,
the pirogue on the water, far more than
any reference to some more or less
vaguely remembered common ancestor,
is the expression of the unity of all
fisherfolk.
The pirogue makes contact easier and
favours the extension of family links. It is
a means of settling any disputes that may
arise, it plays its part in ceremonies such
as the enthronement of the chief and is,
of course, central to such institutions as
pirogue racing. It is a means of artistic
expression (the finely carved figureheads
on the prow) and it confirms the cultural
unity of the society through the songs of
the crews (which celebrate the pirogue as
ancestor, as the mother of heroes, as the
mother's noble son, etc.).
Pirogue races are still held today. Nine
days before the event, all the men capable
of taking part gather together. The eve¬
nings are alive with song and the feats of
the great piroguemen of the past are
recounted.
The songs of the piroguemen cover
every aspect of the life of the
community economic, political and
personal. The song is improvised by the
soloist and is then taken up in turn by his
audience, reinforcing the unity of the
group.
The history of the group is also reflec¬
ted in the creation of the figureheads that
decorate the prows of the racing pi¬
rogues, the most powerful figure or ani¬
mal representing the kinship group.
The prow presents a challenge to rival
groups who take it up by creating in their
turn similar figures which, it is hoped,
will stand out by their originality.
Thus, for a Duala, the pirogue is
indeed an extension of himself.
Before the start of a pirogue race the
rival crews sing in an attempt to intimi¬
date their opponents. Here are two of
these songs:
Yo, Yo, Yo!
Nkondo (I) mightier
than all other "lands"!
(I) Name of the pirogue.

African birds and snakes mingle with European motifs in the design
of this finely crafted ornamental prow of a Duala pirogue. The bird
is associated with the gods of the air, the snake with water
divinities. The central figure, a woman with multicoloured breasts,
is a motif from a genealogical tree, and the animals she holds in her
hands may have a totemic significance.
Come and see
Nkondo, mightier
than all other "lands".
I love Nkondo,
the one pirogue which troubles
all the land of the Duala.
Nkondo the triumphant...
You, sons of Duala,
descendants of Bedi,
I .defy you
Nkondo! mightier
than all other "lands".
Be not dismayed,
Ours is the only pirogue
that fills the hearts of others
with hate and fear.
Ebenye, mun'ango
A ma pumwa wenge
Kana mbela na
A ma longo wenge
Kana ngoso (I) na...
Ebenye, your son
has flown today
like an eagle.
Today he has sung
like a nightingale (2)...
(1) Ngoso: (parrot); literary style which might be likened
to the epic style in Western literature.
(2) "Parrot" in the Duala version.
