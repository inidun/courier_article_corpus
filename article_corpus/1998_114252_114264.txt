For the past six years, the computer services
c o m p a ny De Chazal Du Mée (DCDM)
Consulting has worked hard to establish itself
in the sunny island of Mauri t i u s. It has thought
big and taken a gamble by developing and export i n g
its own software.
With a score of other firm s , DCDM Consul-
ting is a pioneer among the computer companies
which have recently sprung up in the island. Most
of these firms have gone into data inputting for big
European companies. The gove rnment agency
which promotes new technology, the Nat i o n a l
Computer Board (NCB), s ays about fifty firms are
also selling hardware.
DCDM Consulting was started in 1992,when
the computer industry was beginning to take off.
“The firm is completely in pri vate hands and we
h ave n ’t had a cent of gove rnment subsidy,” s ay
Yolaine Yong and Pratik Ghosh, who manage the
company under its Singaporean chief, Seow Liang
Pe rn g . “But the conditions the gove rnment has
c r e ated to encourage new technology have really
helped us.”
Foreign experts
and financial incentives
Since 1989, when the NCB was set up, t h e
g ove rnment has been concentrating on pushing the
c o m p u t e ri z ation of the island’s firm s. It has brought
in foreign expert s , mostly from Singapore, and pro-
vided incentives such as low-interest loans and cus-
toms duty exemptions for companies import i n g
material to computerize their operations.
More recently, a “computer park” was opened
south of the capital, Po rt - L o u i s. Companies setting
up there get tax breaks and the use of cheap-r at e ,



The Indian Ocean’s digital tiger
With its bold decision-make rs, skilled labour force and
ambitions for globalization, Mauritius stakes its claim to join
the information economy
A small island can have big ambitions—and Mauritius 
does not hide its aspiration to become the top supplier of computer
services in the Indian Ocean

Last year, the country passed a copyright law and
set up a ministry of telecommunications and infor-
mation technology. Several of the island’s colleges

June, the government announced it would set up
the Mauritius Institute of Te c h n o l o gies to train
high-flying technicians.
The switch
to computers
A small island can have big ambitions, a n d
Mauritius does not hide its aspiration to become
the top supplier of computer services in the Indian
Ocean, the region’s “digital tiger”.
At the start of the 1990s it was not all that easy
for inexperienced local firms to switch to compu-
t e rs. They had to know what to buy and how to
maintain their new systems. A need for computer
s e rvices was born . A response came when the
accounting firm De Chazal du Mée, a partner of the
big intern ational consulting company A n d e rs e n
Wo r l d w i d e , set up DCDM Consulting to advise
large companies,mostly sugar factories and textile
mills.
The demand for software soon followe d .To d ay,
Yong and Ghosh are proud of having devised an
accounting software package used by about forty
firms,computer systems for insurance companies,
banks and the national airline, and an integr at e d
management system for sugar factories.
Moving up
the ladder
DCDM’s staff of about 160 computer techni-
c i a n s , e n gi n e e rs , s t at i s t i c i a n s , economists and
accountants—all of them unive rsity gr a d u at e s —
were trained in Mauritius or in Europe. Most are
recruited at the bottom of the ladder,as “analysts”
e a rning about 8,000 rupees ($320) a month.A c c o r-
ding to their performance, they can move up into
the elite of “consultants”, whom they accompany
on visits to customers. As well as on-the-job trai-
n i n g, they take courses to fa m i l i a rize themselve s
with the latest technological developments.
But competition in the computer industry is
fie r c e .M a u ri t i u s , with its small businesses and low
ove r h e a d s ,o f f e rs relat i vely cheap serv i c e s. H owe ve r ,
over the horizon in India, for example, rival firms
can find even lower cost labour.
Using its association with A n d e rs e n , DCDM is
keen to expand its activities beyond Mauri t i u s.
Already it is in charge of maintaining the Botswa n a
g ove rn m e n t ’s computers. It has also written for the
World Bank an integr ated computer progr a m m e
to run development projects in Kenya , Ta n z a n i a
and Uganda.
