A What's What' of libraries
and archives
5,000 years of archives
3000-2800 BC. In the temple of Eanna, in
the Mesopotamian city of Uruk (now
Varka), not far from what was then the
mouth of the Euphrates, accounts and in¬
ventories were written in Akkadian
cuneiform script on clay tablets. It is from
these, the oldest surviving, written
documents, that the first economic archives
developed. At about the same period the
hieroglyphic system of writing was being
developed in Egypt. It was used initially for
inscriptions on monuments.
1400-1200 BC. Diplomatic correspondence
on clay tablets was documented in well
organized chancery archives, remnants of
which have survived in various capitals of
the Eastern Mediterranean region such as
Tell-el-Amarna in Egypt, Ugarit in Syria
and the Hittite capital, Boghazköy, in
present-day Turkey. Documents in clay
tablet form dating from the same period
have been found in the so-called Palace of
Nestor, north of Pilos, in the
Peloponnesus. .
78-79 BC. The Tabularium of the central
State archive of the Roman Empire was
constructed at the foot of the Capitol,
above the Roman Forum. Its ruins can still
be seen. At first the Romans wrote on
whitened wooden tablets (album). Later
they adopted papyrus rolls from the Egyp¬
tians and Greeks. Fundamental laws were
publicly displayed on bronze tablets.
98 AD. A document written in the Chinese
province of Gansu testified to the invention
of paper, which legend attributes to the
minister Ts'ai Lun. From China paper ar¬
rived in Japan and Korea. It reached the
Arabs about 750 via the trading centre of
Samarkand and afterwards spread to the
whole of the Arab cultural area.
538 AD. The Emperor Justinian decreed
that the treaties and acts entered in the city
registers or gesta municipalia, and per¬
manently preserved in a special public
building called the archeion or archivum,
should be regarded as authentic. He thus in¬
tegrated the archives into the corpus juris
on which the development of European law
is based.
753-755 AD. Deeds or charters on parch¬
ment with wax seals stamped on or hanging
from them became the most important
form of document during the European
Middle Ages. The earliest ones which have
come down to us, now in the National Ar¬
chives in Paris, are the original charters
issued by King Pippin to the Abbey of St
Denis. The first archives of deeds and
charters originated in monasteries. It, was
only later that city and State archives came
into existence.
1198. The present register of the Vatican ar¬
chives was begun when the Papal Chancery
was transferred to the Vatican. The older
register, in which the ancient tradition of
the Roman public records or commentant
survived, was destroyed in the Lateran fire.
Soon after 1200 a register of cor¬
respondence, which was important for the
organization of archives, began to be kept
in the royal chanceries of Paris, Barcelona
and London. In the last-named capital they
were kept in the form of rolls.
C. 1450. In addition to the older charter or
treasury archives, there now appeared ar¬
chives of administrative records, for which
paper imported into Western Europe via
Spain was already being used in rapidly in¬
creasing quantities from the 14th century
onwards.
1794. The French National Convention
adopted the Archives Law of 7th Messidor
of the year II, under which the nation's ar¬
chives, previously largely kept secret, were
opened to the public. The system of
organizing archives on national and
regional or departmental lines, which was
introduced under the revolutionary regime
in France, became the model for modern ar¬
chives organization in Western Europe.
1821. The Ecole des Chartes, the first
school to specialize in training archivists
and librarians, whose formation is concen¬
trated on the study of historical sources,
was established in Paris.
1841. A decree made work in French ar¬
chives subject to respect des fonds. The
principle of provenance, already partly
observed elsewhere, under which archives
are classified according to the authorities
and institutions where they originated,
became the fundamental modern system of
archive organization.
1910. The first international congress of ar¬
chivists and librarians was held in Brussels.
The subjects discussed ranged from the
repair of archive volumes and restoration
problems to the economic archives then be¬
ing set up and the handling of film archives.
1918. The revolutionary government in
Russia led by Lenin issued the decree of
1.6.1918 on the "reorganization and cen¬
tralization of archives". Its concept of a
centralized State archive became the model
for archives in the Socialist countries.
1948. Influenced by the damage caused to
archives during the Second World War, a
group of archive experts invited to Paris by
Unesco decided upon the creation of the In¬
ternational Council on Archives (ICA). Ar¬
chivists from 33 countries participated in
the founding congress two years later.
1950. The passing of the Federal Records
Act in the USA provided a legal basis for
the system of rational records administra¬
tion already in operation and for the
establishment of record centres. The British
Public Records Act of 1958 created another
model for records administration.
1968. The creation of a regional archives
association for Southeast Asia (SARBICA)
confirmed the spread of modern archive
concepts in the Third World. In the same
year it was decided at a congress in Niamey
to set up a regional training centre in Dakar.
The resultEDADis a model for closer
co-operation between archive, library and
documentation centre. Meanwhile the In¬
ternational Council on Archives embraces
nine regions in every part of the world. At
the International Archives Congress in
Washington in 1976 there was talk of a
"geoarchival revolution".
1984. About 1300 archivists from over 100
countries took part in the 10th Interna¬
tional Archives Congress in Bonn (FRG).
Under the general theme of "the challenge
to archives", the participants discussed the
effects of computerization and the new
media, and new tasks in the public sphere.
Built In 1534, during the Ming dynasty,
the Imperial History Archive, located In
the eastern part of Beijing, Is the oldest
and best preserved Imperial archive In
China. Right, the main hall of the Archive,
built entirely In brick to reduce fire risk.

The ancient Chinese used to Inscribe I
their writings, mainly divlnatory or
oracular, on bones or tortoise shells
which they preserved with great care.
This Inscribed fragment of bone, 3,000
years old and little more than two cen¬
timetres long, was unearthed recently at
Zhouyuan, In Shanxl province.

Archives
by the kilometre
THE importance of the world's ar¬
chival institutions, from large
National Archives to local record
offices, may be gauged from the number
of people who use them or by the volume
of their holdings, usually measured in
metres of shelvingalthough such quan¬
titative yardsticks provide only a limited in¬
dication of the value of their contents for
research.
One of the world's oldest archival in¬
stitutions is the General Archives in
Simancas (Spain), with 9,500 metres of
records some dating as far back as 834.
The largest archival institution outside
Europe is the National Archives in
Washington, D.C., which today has 470
kilometres of shelving. The Public Ar¬
chives of Canada preserve 38 km of con¬
ventional archives, and 350 km of semi-
current records administered in federal
records centres throughout the country.
Europe's biggest archives are the Ar¬
chives Nationales in France (350 km not
including 36 km at the Archives d'Outre-
Mer, 27 km at the Foreign Affairs archives
and 65 km at the Armed Forces archives)
and the Public Record Office in London,
which holds 379 km (the India Office
records occupy 11 km of shelving
whereas the National Archives of India
preserve 25 km).
The State Archives of Venice hold 68
km, surpassing archives which are
historically as important such as the Na¬
tional Archives of Belgium (55 km) and
Hungary (33 km).
The Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv in
Vienna preserves 25 km of data, but there
are five other central archives in Austria,
which together preserve 100 km.
In Czechoslovakia, federal, regional
and local archives together preserve 563
km. In the Netherlands, a small, densely
populated country with a long history in
which cities played an important role,
there are 383 km of historical archives, 63
km of which are in the National Archives at
The Hague.
Major archives exist not only in Europe
and North America. The National Ar¬
chives of Zimbabwe preserve 49 km, not
counting 33 km of semi-current records in
other centres. In Nigeria the National Ar¬
chives store 28 km.
All these institutions, as well as hun¬
dreds of smaller archives, are listed in the
International Directory of Archives
published by the International Council on
Archives (a new edition is currently being
prepared for publication this year.
