The rescue of the Bulgarian Jews in 1943
by Emmanuel Vaillant
On 8 March 1 994, a
ceremony was held at
Unesco Headquarters
in Paris under the
patronage of
M. François Mitterrand,
President of France, to
commemorate the
saving of the Bulgarian
Jews during the Second
World War. The
Bulgarians were one of
the few peoples In
Europe to protect their
Jewish community, even
though their country
was allied to Nazi
Germany. The following
article draws largely on
the testimony of Louis
Blum, who lived
through these events
and, Ike 47,000 ofhis
fellow citizens, escaped
deportation to the
death camps. Forty
years later history
honours the memory
of thousands of
Bulgarians who
rejected Intolerance. It
also records the
shameful story of the
1 1,363 Jews from
Thrace and Macedonia
who were sacrificed
because they did not
possess Bulgarian
nationality.

Bulgaria, ruled by King Boris III, had a
population of six million in 1939. The
regime had fascist leanings, but a number
of opposition political parties were tol¬
erated. The people were mostly Orthodox,
and the Jewish community was well inte¬
grated.
When war broke out, Bulgaria
leaned towards the cause of Nazi
Germany, on which it was economically
dependent. The government soon
drafted an anti-Semitic law, "for the pro¬
tection of the nation". A year later the
law was adopted in the teeth of fierce
opposition from many Bulgarian mem¬
bers of parliament and writers.
On 1 March 1941, the country offi¬
cially became an ally of the Third Reich
and was later permitted to administer
Thrace and Macedonia. At that time
12,000 Jews, considered to be stateless
persons, were living in Bulgaria's two
"new territories".
In August 1942 a Commission for
Jewish Questions was set up under the
anti-Semitic ideologist, Alexander Belev.
In the same month a decree expelling
Sofia's Jews to the provinces was pro¬
mulgated.
"We were given six months to leave
the capital," Louis Blum remembers.
"Those who did not leave voluntarily
faced deportation to a city arbitrarily
assigned to them by the authorities. Most
of Sofia's Jews preferred to stay, hoping
that things would sort themselves out. At
the end of May 1943, however, they were
all forced to leave.
"My family chose to leave Sofia in
November 1942. We settled in Pazardjil,
near Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest
city. There were about a thousand of us
Jews in a district of some 30,000 inhab¬
itants. A few months after our arrival,
alarming rumours began to go round.
There was talk about trains carrying
Jews from Greece and Thrace to Poland
in cattle wagons. On 9 March 1943, the
police arrested our community leaders
and their families.
"About thirty people were interned
in the Pazardjil Jewish school, which
was in the grounds of the synagogue.
No one was allowed to visit them,
although a crowd of their Jewish and
non-Jewish friends gathered nearby.
Protests spread like wildfire. Efforts
were made to influence the authorities.
We discovered that the detainees were to
join the trainloads of deported Greek
Jews and that other arrests were immi¬
nent. Schoolmates immediately offered
to let me stay the night at their homes,
just in case.
"The next day all the Jews who had
been arrested were released. The decree
for their deportation to Poland had been
rescinded. After their release, there was
a big demonstration at which people
cried 'Long live Bulgaria, homeland of all
its children'. It was not until later that we
learned what had really happened."
An indelible stain
On 22 February SS Sturmführer Theodor
Dannecker, a close colleague of Adolf Eich-
mann, met Alexander Belev in Sofia where

the two men drew up a plan to deport
20,000 Jews to Germany. The first target
was the Jewish community in the terri¬
tories of Thrace and Greece ceded to Bul¬
garia by Nazi Germany. At the beginning
of March, with the consent of Boris III and
his government, 1 1,363 "non-Bulgarian"
Jews were arrested. Packed into freight
trains, they crossed Bulgaria on their way
to Treblinka, from which they never
returned.
The agreement signed by the
I Nazis provided for the depor¬
tation of 20,000 Jews. More than 8,000
still had to be found. The Commission
for Jewish Questions drew up a list of
8,400 names. The deportations were
scheduled for 9 March. The day before,
an official of the town of Kiustendil dis¬
covered dozens of freight wagons
standing near the local station, ready to
transport Jews to Poland. He told one of
his friends, who was close to the deputy
speaker of the Bulgarian parliament,
Dimiter Pechev. Deeply distressed by
this piece of information, Pechev raised
the matter in parliament on the same
day. Before being dismissed from his
post, he had time to collect the signatures
of forty-three leading opposition fig-
"The next day, all the Jews who
had been arrested were
released. The decree for their
deportation to Poland had been
rescinded. After their release,
there was a big demonstration
at which people cried 'Long
live Bulgaria, homeland of all
its children.' It was not until
later that we learned what had
really happened."
ures. Elin Pclin, president of the Bul¬
garian Writers' Association and a friend
of the King, wrote that "The conscience
of the Bulgarian people hangs in the bal¬
ance. The stain cast on our people by
the expulsion of our Jewish fellow-citi¬
zens will not be erased for generations to
come."
Resistance began to take shape. Asso¬
ciations of doctors, shop-keepers,
lawyers, university professors and the
highest officials of the Orthodox Church
called for the annulment of the expulsion
decree. In Plovdiv, Patriarch Cyril told
the Jewish community, "Wherever you
go, I shall go too." The Red Cross and
foreign Jewish leaders also brought pres¬
sure to bear, as did the Allies, who
announced an offensive on the Russian
front. In a report commenting on the
reaction of the Bulgarian people, the
ambassador of Nazi Germany wrote:
"The Bulgarian efforts to save their Jews
are due to the mentality of this people
which lacks our clearmindedness and
our ideological vision. Raised with
Armenians, Greeks and Gypsies, the
Bulgarians have no trouble living with
Jews, so that in their eyes nothing justi¬
fies the measures we are taking regarding
them." On 10 March, after a big demon¬
stration in the streets of Sofia, Boris III
withdrew the expulsion decree and the
Bulgarian Jews arrested in the provinces
were freed.



A prayer for peace
However, the repeal of this decree was not
followed by the abrogation of the anti-
Jewish laws. In May and June 1943, almost
20,000 Sofia Jews were deported to
provincial cities. During the same period,
7,000 Jews were sent to forced labour
camps.
"After the events of March
1943," continues Louis Blum,
"my father decided to send my brother
and me to Palestine. It was hard enousrh
"The Commission for Jewish
Questions drew up a list of
8,400 names. The deportations
were scheduled for 9 March.

the town of Kiustendil discov¬

parliament."
to get a Bulgarian passport, but getting
a British visa for Palestine was even more
difficult. Meanwhile, I passed my school
certificate in June 1943. I was immedi¬
ately put into a Jewish group and sent to
a work camp. Conditions were very
hard, but no one died of mistreatment,
exhaustion or hunger."
Before the end of the war Louis
Blum, his brother and 2,000 other Jews
managed to obtain a British visa enabling
them to go to Palestine. In 1948 and
1949 35,000 more Bulgarian Jews fol¬
lowed them. Today there are no more
than 5,000 Jews in Bulgaria.
On the occasion of the commemo¬
ration of the events of 1943, Eddie
Schwartz, president of the Organiza¬
tion of Jews in Bulgaria, stated, "At a
time when children and women, men
and old people so near to us are suf¬
fering and dying, victims of an insane
inter-ethnic conflict in the Balkans, the
Bulgarian example assumes the dimen¬
sion of a prayer for humanity and for
peace."
