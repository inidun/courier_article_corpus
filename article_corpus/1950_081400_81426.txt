world problems like disease, hunger, ignorance and poverty,
which recognize no frontier, can never be overcome unless
all the nations join universal efforts to these ends.
"We re-affirm the validity of this principle of universality.
The United Nations system makes ample room for diversity
within a universal framework. We believe it would be a
disaster if efforts to realize the principle of universality zn
practice were to be abandoned MOM.
"We believe that the greatest efforts should, on the con-
trary, be directed towards achieving in fact true universality
in the membership and programmes of the United Nations
and of tho. < : e of the Specialized Aflencies which are foundea
on that principle.
"We also believe that it is necessary for all governments
to renew their efforts to conciliate and negotiate the poli-
tical differences that divide them and obstruct economic
and social advancement.
"Specifically, we believe that it is essential to the future
of both the United Nations and the Specialized Agencies
that the present political deadlock in the United Nations be
resolved at the earliest possible moment.
"The peace and well-being of all peoples demand from
their Governments a great and sustained new effort by the
nations of the world to achieve a constructive and durable
peace."
