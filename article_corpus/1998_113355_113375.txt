A skull rotates on the black screen.
The picture of a baby flanked by

but it is no laughing matter when sites
on bomb-making, child prostitution and
the superi o rity of the white race appear.
The Intern e t , the outcome of a successful
m a rriage between telecommunicat i o n s
and inform ation technology, is posing
unprecedented inform ation control pro-
blems which gove rn m e n t s , s e rvice prov i-
d e rs , e d u c at o rs and families are fin d i n g
hard to solve .
Messages travel without
leaving a tra c e
A newspaper has an editorial team and a
p rinting plant, a television network has
n e w s c a s t e rs , studios and transmitters. I n
other wo r d s , traditional media are identi-
fiable and have a physical or mat e ri a l
component that the authorities can call
to account when they consider that the
l aw has been broken.They can prosecute
a journ a l i s t , shut down a newspaper or
c o n fis c ate a transmitter. The media are
also attached to a terri t o ry. Their mes-
sages may cross borders , but their activi-
ties come under the jurisdiction of at
least one country.
The Internet is another matter alto-
g e t h e r. F i rst of all, there are countless
t r a n s m i t t e rs of inform at i o n . A hundred
million people have access to the Inter-
n e t , and any one of them can not only
send electronic mail and take part in chat
f o rums bu t , with a little electronic tinke-
ri n g, t u rn their personal computer into a
s e rvice provider that others can tap into.
In a way, t h at person then becomes “ v i r-
t u a l ” . His or her message can travel along
so many routes that when it reaches its
d e s t i n at i o n , the ori ginal source can no
longer be traced.
L e gi t i m ate or not, the monitoring of
contents must take this new situation into
a c c o u n t .T h at would require a unive rs a l
a greement based on a common set of ethics,
or at least a lowest common denominator.
But that is far from the case.The Nether-
l a n d s , C h i n a , Z a m b i a , the United Stat e s ,
Cuba and France, to name just a few coun-
tries,have radically different and even irre-
concilable views on what is and what is not
permissible on the Internet.
I n t e rnet service prov i d e rs and some
o r g a n i z ations campaigning to “clean up
the We b ” point to an assault on morality.
The fierce competition among serv i c e
p r ov i d e rs has led many of them to culti-
vate a wholesome image on issues such
as paedophilia, which strikes a chord in
public opinion, out of fear of being consi-
dered purve yo rs of “ s m u t ” .
In The Netherlands, the authorities have
no intention of passing repressive law s. I n s-
tead they are encouraging service prov i d e rs
to clean up their act by eliminating paedo-
phile and racist sites from their servers. In
January 1996 Dutch Internet service pro-
v i d e rs created a foundation in charge of
tracking down undesirable sites. L aw enfor-
cement officials step in only when the author
of the incriminating pages refuses to com-
p l y.But Renee Zwa rt , a member of the foun-
d ation who believes censorship is a “ m e d i e-
val instru m e n t ” ,s ays her organization does
not attack freedom of expression.
M a ny companies supply their clients

Will censorship on the Internet forbid the unacceptable or just silence

How can we prevent children from accessing violent sites, without restricting freedom of expression?

Pat r o l , C Y B E R s i t t e r , N e t N a n ny and
S u r f wat c h . They offer a list of we b s i t e s
or forums with a reputation for contai-
ning mat e rial considered offensive and a
list of key words that are judged obscene.
The connexion is interrupted wheneve r
a user tries to log on to one of these sites
or as soon as a forbidden word appears
on screen.The Electronic Frontier Fo u n-
d at i o n , an A m e rican organization dedi-
c ated to a radical defence of freedom of
speech on the Intern e t , is totally in line
with its country ’s laws and tradition.T h e
f o u n d ation argues that although these
p r o grams screen out indecent content,
they also block access to many political
and social sites, including pages devo t e d
to fighting Aids and promoting wo m e n ’s
ri g h t s.The experiment is “ i n c o n c l u s i ve ” .
M o r e ove r , “it is relat i vely easy to outs-
m a rt these progr a m s , e ven for a begi n-
n e r ,” s ays Je a n - Paul Cloutier, an inde-
pendent World Wide Web pioneer in
Quebec and editor of Chroniques de Cybé-
ri e, an on-line inform ation and commen-
t a ry magazine about the inform at i o n
h i g h way s.
G ove rnment restrictions can be enforced
in the name of morality, but above all they
are used to prevent the use of the Internet for
“subversive” ends. In China, for example,
I n t e rnet users must register with the police
and agree not to use the medium for “anti-
g ove rnment activities”. W h at ’s more, t h e
g ove rn m e n t , which has eve ry modem-ow n e r
on fil e , has monitored all traffic since 1996.
“For example,it is now against the law for
a businessman to use the Internet to obtain
stock market information considered stra-
t e gi c,” s ays Christophe Tr o n c h e , a member
of the French section of Citadel, an organi-
zation that campaigns for the upholding of
individual freedom on the Intern e t . In Cuba,
the regulation commis-
s i o n , which approve s
requests for Intern e t
access, is entirely made
up of representatives of
the justice, interior and
a rmed forces ministri e s.
In countries like
China and Cuba,m o n i-
t o ring cy b e rspace is
easier because “the tele-
c o m m u n i c ations opera-
t o rs belong to the stat e ,” Cloutier explains.
But monitoring is less straightforward when
the site is offered by a server located out-
side the country. T h at is the case, f o r
e x a m p l e , in A l g e ri a , where Internet users
have access to a site created by “dissident
o f f i c e rs ” in the armed forces. “The A l g e-
rian gove rnment doesn’t like our site’s
content. . . .We use the Web as an opportu-
n i t y,” s ays the site’s anonymous we b m a s-
ter.
The Internet can be used as an alter-
n at i ve to censored traditional media,
especially the printed wo r d . In Nove m-
ber 1997 the French organization Repor-
t e rs without Frontiers , which defends
freedom of the press, t ried using the
I n t e rnet to gi ve a new lease of life to the
M a u ritanian newspaper M a u ritanie Nou-
ve l l e, whose publication had been sus-
pended for seven months, by putting
some of the publicat i o n ’s articles on line.
To d ay, opponents of monolithic regi m e s
can use the Internet to set up areas of
freedom that are forbidden in their ow n
c o u n t ries and can reach an intern at i o n a l
audience that would be difficult to obtain
o t h e r w i s e . C e n s o rs around the world are
coming up against this phenomenon
because “ right now the Internet is the
only area of freedom outside all political
c o n t r o l ,” s ays Lyonnel T h o u venot of
R e p o rt e rs without Frontiers.
In liberal democracies, where most
e f f o rts to ban mat e rial on the Intern e t
are focused on sites with paedophile and
racist content, the first attempt to control
the Web dates back to 1995. T h at is when
the US Congress passed the Communi-
c ation Decency A c t , which aimed to
s e verely punish the transmission of
“ s h o c k i n g ” and “ i n d e c e n t ” m at e ri a l
through computer networks in the name
of the protection of children. Under the
t e rms of the law, v i o l at o rs could fa c e
fines of up to $250,000 and two - year pri-
son sentences. A ye a r
l ater the act was ru l e d
unconstitutional and
s t ruck down by the
Supreme Court . In the
name of freedom of
e x p r e s s i o n , n e o - n a z i
sites have also been
a l l owed to continue in
the United States and
to flourish in Den-
m a r k .
In Germ a ny last May, a Munich court
c o nvicted Felix Somm, the former local
manager of the service provider Compu-
S e rve , of spreading porn o graphic mat e ri a l
over the Internet through newsgr o u p s ,
handing down a suspended two - year pri-
son sentence and fining him 100,000
m a r k s.The conviction has been appealed.
The judicial authorities in Germ a ny are
also uncompromising when it comes to
neo-nazi propaganda or far-left on-line
magazines such as R a d i k a l, which is accu-
sed of being an apologist for violence. A
Dutch server offers the peri o d i c a l , w h i c h
is also banned from newsstands. H owe ve r ,
Cloutier say s , “few states have laws speci-
fically pertaining to the Intern e t . . . .E ve ry-
thing depends on how existing laws on
freedom of expression are applied, on the
m a r gin of manoeuvre one has to cri t i c i z e

to prevent the use

tions of content that could endanger stat e
s e c u ri t y. . . .”
The matter becomes even more com-
plicated if encryption is
taken into account.The
main way in which the
flow of inform ation on
the Internet is control-
led is by states refusing
to make encry p t i o n
technology totally avai-
l a b l e . E n c ryption tech-
nology is based on a kind
of lock that can be ope-
ned by a key known only to the two corres-
pondents and makes it possible to read mes-
sages that were sent in code. Ending that
monopoly would technically mean ending
c e n s o rship on the Internet because anyo n e
would be able to send or receive an encry p-
ted message that no unauthorized pers o n
would be able to read. In fa c t , e ve ry stat e
f e a rs that these massive , r e p e at e d , c r o s s -
border electronic exchanges,which escape
all control, will limit their powers and pri-
vileges in the age of globalization.Some of
these powe rs are legi t i m ate if they help com-
b at money-laundering or the spread of pae-
d o p h i l i a .O t h e rs are obsolete.The gr owth of
electronic trade requires total protection of
p ayment methods,which themselves depend
on secure encry p t i o n . But most expert s
a gree that the Internet must move out of its
present pri m i t i ve stage, in which scholars
and “ p l u g g e d - i n ” individuals exchange
i n f o rm at i o n , and become an instrument of
mass commercial communicat i o n ,w h e t h e r
it is used by companies between themselve s ,
by producers,or by consumers.
O r g a n i z ations that defend freedom of
expression on the Intern e t , such as the A m e-
rican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and
the Electronic Frontier Fo u n d ation (EFF),
are fighting for the total availability of encry p-
tion technology,especially Pretty Good Pri-
va cy (PGP).This software may be ava i l a b l e
to all Internet users in the United Stat e s ,
but only in a ve rsion that is also in the pos-
session of law enforce-
ment officials.In France,
e n c ryption is done with
special permission from
the gove rnment so that
the police can read the
i n f o rm at i o n .
There’s no escaping
o n e ’s roots.The military
designed the Intern e t
because they wanted a
c o m m u n i c ations network with so many
r a m i fic ations that the system wo u l d n ’t be
paralysed by destroying one of its part s. J u s t
try keeping tabs on that. ■

Dubious s e r v e rs
Internet service providers have
proliferated at a breathtaking
p a c e. There were 213 in 1981,
1,000 in 1984,100,000 in 1989,
a million in 1992 and 9.5 million
in 1996.Between mid-1995 and
m i d - 1 9 9 6 , five million servers
were created.
The European Union has iden-
t i fied the following areas where
the Internet can be abused by
the transmission of harmful or
illegal information or even by
criminals:
• national security (terrorism or
instructions for making bombs
or illegal drugs);
• protection of minors (violence
and pornography);
• protection of human dignity
(racial discrimination and inci-
tement to racial hatred);
• economic security (fraud, i n s-
tructions on credit card piracy);
• protection of information;
• protection of privacy (unau-
thorized communication of per-
sonal data,e-mail harrassment);
• protection of one’s good
name (libel,illegal comparative
advertising);
protection of intellectual pro-
perty (unauthorized distribution
of copyright material, such as
software and music). ■
