TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES ARE INCREASING
FOR STUDENTS AND WORKERS
EARLY last year a young American hotel employee set off for
France to spend six months working in a Paris hotel and
thereby improve his knowledge and experience of hotel
management. At about the same time a French automobile engineer
was embarking at Le Havre, en route for a Cleveland factory where
he could study the latest technical methods of American car
production.
These two young men were part
of the ever-growing"army"of
working men and women of many
countries who during 1949 took
advantage of a chance to learn
through foreign travel and study,
and who, by the end of the year,
numbered about 40, 000. Some
learned languages and generally
widened their cultural horizons,
others studied social and labour
problems while there were others,
like the hotel employee and the
engineer, who improved their
working skills by experience under
new conditions.
This year the number of such
journeys will be even greater,
thanks to the joint co-operation of
Unesco and the International
Labour Office (ILO) with trade
unions and other organizations in
twenty countries. To ensure the
maximum result from this co-ope-
ration, Unesco and the ILO last
month called a meeting in Unesco
House of experts on education and
cultural exchange programmes for
worker.
MUCH of the agenda was basedon a panoramic survey of
international travel for workers
and others presented in Study
Abroad, Volume 11, a comprehen-
sive handbook published by Unesco
as a guide to fellowships, scholar-
ships and related educational
opportunities throughout the world.
Volume 1, published in 1948, was
the first attempt to make a uni-
versal compendium of fellowships
and grants available for study
abroad.
The value of Study Abroad
Volume II has bees widely
recognized in the world's news-
papers. Recently, for example, the
London"News Chronicle"declared
that the publication offered a
challenge to political leaders"to
pay more than lip service to the
gospel of (one world'."Another
London newspaper,"The Times",
in an editorial entitled"Wand-
ering Scholars", wrote :"The
Grand Tour is, indeed, as dead as
the Doge and the stage coach, but
Ã  n, ew method of travel, confusing
through the number of official and
unofficial bodies concerned, and
yet full of life and growth has
recently developed. The extent is
shown in a survey produced by
Unesco".
Volume 11, a work of 363 fact-
packed pages, shows that the free-
dom to study abroad is areater in
1950 than it. has ever been before
in the recorded history of human
scholarship : seventy-two countries
and territories, as well as the Uni-
ted Nations, Unesco and other in-
ternational organizations, have
donated 2171 fellowships to nation-
als of eighty-eight nations.
MOREOVER Volume II also showsthat the cultural exchanges
of workers have become an
important part of the world's free
flow of the kind of knowledge that
stimulates understanding and
friendship among people.
Eleven countries, according to
the Unesco handbook, have made
thirty-three international agree-
ments on workers'apprenticeship
programmes, and a number of
other agreements are being worked
out. Eighteen additional countries
furnished valuable information on
workers exchanges. The agreements
already concluded permitted some
9. 000 young men and women to
travel in 1949 to foreign countries
to participate in observation tours,
study courses, and trade union
activities. In addition, TTWre than
31, 000 travelled either on planned
educational and cultural tours, or
for general touristic purposes.
STUDY Abroad. Volume 11 devotesthirty large pages to a detailed
factual description of the pro-
grammes or workers exchanges-
either for vocational ends, or four
general cultural and educational
purposes-already carried out by
18 European countries, the U. S.
and Canada, as well as inter-
national non-governmental agen-
cies.
But professional industrial and
agricultural workers from many
other countries were also given op-
portunities for vocational travel ;
these included, for example. Austra-
lia, the Union of South Africa, Bul-
garia and a number of the nations
of South and Central. America. And
in the more general educational
field, the area covered was even lar-
ger geographically.
Among the workers whose travel
was arranged under the inter-
governmental agreements w ere
more than 3, 000 trainees-young
workers and apprentices who. went
abroad in order to increase their
occupational knowledge by taking
student-training employment in
agricultural, industrial and com-
mercial enterprises. Although all
the agreements were bi-lateral,
some were part of joint program-
mes undertaken by groups of
countries. This was true of exchan-
ges of agricultural and horticul-
tural workers between England,
Wales and various European coun-
tries, also of exchanges of agricul-
tural workers between Denmark
Finland, Norway and Sweden.
or addition to agriculture, theoccupations which traine s most
frequently entered under ths
exchange programmes, as reported
by the ILO, were the hotel industry,
engineering, jobs as mechanics and
in offices and commercial establish-
ments. Some 30 other types of
work which trainees undertook
varied from gardening to glass
blowing and From cheese making
to bookbinding.
Thirteen nations answered enqui-
ries sent out by Unesco on workers'.
cultural exchange programmes, and
the replies provided information
about programmes in eight addi-
tional countries. Most of the ex-
changes, according to Study
Abroad, Volume II, were arranged
by trade unions, workers'educa-
tional associations, and other non-
governmental organizations. Un-
like the trainees'foreign visits
which extend from twelve to
eighteen months, the educational
and cultural journeys were quite
short-one to three weeks.
The overriding pur p 0 s e of
Unesco's efforts in the field of
international exchanges was sum-
med up recently by a Scottish
newspaper,"The Evening Times"
of Glasgow, which wrote :"With
the tens of thousands of fellowships
and other aids to foreign study
available there should. be more
glimmers of understanding between
nations".
