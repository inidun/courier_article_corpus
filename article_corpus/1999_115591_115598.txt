Basketballer Michael Jo r d a n ’s announcement
on Ja n u a ry 13 that he was retiring made head-
lines all around the wo r l d . He was up there with
Pelé, they said.The American superstar’s skill has
dazzled eve ryone who has watched him dashing
around a basketball court; as he leaps to dunk the
ball in the net he seems to be momentarily sus-
pended in the air.They call him “Air Jordan.”
But Jo r d a n , the Chicago Bulls star whose income
as a player last season was estimated at $30 million,
is also at the head of a business empire. His impact
on the U. S .e c o n o my is reckoned by Fo rt u n e m a g a-
zine at $10 billion. His link with the sporting goods
firm Nike is believed to have generated about $5.2
billion in sales of shoes and clothing.
Idol of the wo r l d ’s youth he may be, but people
argue about the role in society that he has—or
hasn’t—played.The basketball shoes carrying his
name have been stitched by child wo r k e rs in swe at-
shops, say U.S. trade unions. He has never spoken
up for Black causes,say leaders of the Black Ame-
rican community. Has he not set up thousands of
young people for a big fall because he is such a
symbol of social advancement and success? Try as
they might to emulate him, their chances of suc-
ceeding are close to nil.
In fa c t , has he not been a huge publicity machine
which has strengthened social inequalities in the
U.S. and other countries and helped big transna-
tional companies to conquer a world market?

first wo m e n ’s Olympic games.Women athletes are still
in a minority in the Olympics, after making their debu t

They have their own sports meetings, and since 1960
they have had their own Olympic games. H owe ve r ,
the presence of the disabled in mainstream clubs is
still rare and the example of the Norwegian swimmer
described on page 22 is an exception.
So is sport an instrument manipulated by the
p owerful? Or is it a lifeline for those who are
marginalized and excluded by society? Can it be an

outlet for social discontent? The examples cited above
p r ovide no straightforward answer to these ques-
tions. In some cases sport serves the establishment;
in others it can be a seedbed for social activism.At one
and the same time it plays a host of contradictory
social roles at local, n ational and intern ational leve l .
S p o rt does not speak with a single vo i c e . It is
not monolithic. It holds different meanings for dif-
ferent social groups,partly depending on what they
want to get out of it. For the we l l - h e e l e d ,s p o rt can be
a way of adve rtising their social stat u s. P l aying at
e x c l u s i ve golf, tennis or cricket clubs can be an
opportunity to display membership of a privileged
gr o u p.A m ateur sport was controlled for a long time
by such people.
At the other end of the spectru m , s p o rt prac-
tised with the most rudimentary facilities can be a
gr e at form of self-expression for disadvantaged yo u n g
people the world ove r , and may—in exceptional
cases—offer them a way out of pove rty and depri va-
tion. Here the myth of sport as a ticket to upward
mobility can be seen in its quintessential form.The
profiles of a young Korean tennis prodigy (page 23)
and a footballer from Côte d’Ivoire who finds him-
self out on the street after once being hailed as the Pe l é
of his neighbourhood (page 24) illustrate the force and
fragility of this myth.
The kaleidoscope of sport also includes the big-
time spectacular events which have become first and
foremost a commodity whose economic import a n c e
and presence in the media are gr owing non-stop
(see boxes below). And finally there’s sport as it is
e n j oyed by so many people around the wo r l d — a
pastime that helps to keep them fit and brings them
together in a convivial setting. But here too the com-
petition can be intense, and the atmosphere may
t u rn sour. I t ’s among amateur sportsmen and sport s-
women that dru g - a buse is rife and where on-the-
field clashes can be the most violent.
S p o rt is something more than a mirror of the
societies in which it is playe d . It is not a carbon copy
of their inequalities and problems. It is a world in its
own ri g h t , with its own life and its own contradictions.
Through the medium of sport , countless vo l u n t e e rs ,f o r
e x a m p l e , organize activities and events that make a posi-
tive contribution to their communities (see article on
Midnight Basketball in the U. S . on page 25).T h r o u g h
s p o rt , a strong feeling of comradeship develops among
athletes at all leve l s. In short , major social issues
i n fluence sport , just as sport can play a big part in hel-
ping to solve them.
In a world in which all gifted young athletes were
talent-spotted and gi ven equal opportunities to deve l o p
their skills, s p o rting encounters really would take place
on a level playing field. But we do not live in an ideal
wo r l d . The gr e at myth surrounding sport is that it
abolishes social divisions, or at least that its symbolic
force gi ves it a gr e ater capacity to do so than any other
social activity. But the fact remains that the essence of
sport is competition,and competition means making
c o m p a ri s o n s , setting up hierarchies and separat i n g
winners from losers. n
