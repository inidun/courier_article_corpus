r^MONG the attractions of the
Paris zoo in the Bois de Vlncennes
is a group of unusual animals whose
family, the lemurians, is in danger
of extinction in its natural habitat.
Lemurians are proslmlan primates
whose rarest species is the aye-aye,
which is about 40 centimetres long.
Arboreal mammals with large marble-
like eyes, forward-facing ears, and
long bushy tails, lemurians are found
in their natural state only on the
island of Madagascar, where they
arrived 35 million years ago from
Africa.
In the study of evolution, lemu¬
rians are to Madagascar what the
finches, on which Charles Darwin
based one of his major arguments for
his theory of natural selection, are to
the Galapagos islands. They are an
inexhaustible source of information.
Unfortunately, their existence is
threatened because they are being
deprived of their natural habitat by
man-made forest fires, the extent of
which has been revealed by satellite
photographs. This is an ecological
catastrophe fraught with many con¬
sequences. In ten years at most no
lemurians will be left if nothing is
done to protect them.
To avoid this irreparable out¬
come, Unesco has recently approved
the creation of a biosphere reserve at
Mañanara on the east coast of the
island, at the request of the Malagasy
authorities. In the next few years four
more reserves will be created in the
hinterland. Thanks to large-scale

financial assistance from the United
Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the World Bank, the European
Economic Community and the Federal
Republic of Germany, $ 1 0 million will
be invested in the project, which is
bound to have economic and social
consequences. In addition, thanks to
Unesco scholarships, young Malagasy
have begun to follow training courses
which will enable them to take an
active part in the scheme.
Dr. Jean-Jacques Petter, who is
responsible for the conservation of
animal species at the Vincennes zoo,
is in charge of the technical aspects
of the project. A medical doctor by
training, Dr. Petter has been carrying
out research in Madagascar for thirty
years. He talks with enthusiasm and
affection of a country he knows well
but at the same time does not con¬
ceal the gravity of the situation.
"Every year," he says, "300,000
hectares of forest are destroyed by
fire in Madagascar. This phenomenon
is not unique to the island. We are
familiar with devastating fires in the
South of France, many of criminal
origin. In the case of Madagascar, all
the same, they have particularly dra¬
matic consequences since each year
some 200,000 lemurs, 200,000
sifakas and 600,000 members of
other animal species disappear."
One factor in this complex
problem is Madagascar's very high
rate of demographic growth. The
average family has eight children.
Rural populations practise slash and
burn subsistence farming and grow
rice or maize in forest clearings.
Unfortunately the soil is crystalline
and soon ceases to be fertile. After
a few years nothing grows, and the
villagers burn more forest. Such
widespread forest burning eventually
has an impact on the climate. On the
east coast rainfall is less abundant
than it was.
The systematic destruction of the
forest, which a Malagasy proverb
wrongly maintains is eternal, also
causes the loss of many plant species
which are only found in Madagascar
and to which the existence of the
lemurians and other animal species
is closely linked. The primitive plant
and animal life of Madagascar is of
great scientific interest and should be
strictly protected if only because
Madagascar has been separated from
the continent of Africa for tens of mil¬
lions of years and its ecosystems are
unique.
"At Mañanara," Dr. Petter
explains, "we began to make the
local people aware of the problem a
few years ago. Thanks to the existing
village structures we gradually suc¬
ceeded in signing contracts with the
villagers to safeguard the forest. With
the exception of a few die-hards', we
are now sure that the 20,000 inhabi¬
tants of the surrounding region will
cease to burn these 40,000 hectares
of fine forest."
In exchange for their co¬
operation, the villagers benefit from
a development programme which
will intensify as a result of the trans¬
formation of Mañanara into a
biosphere reserve. Irrigation projects
will be launched, small dams will be

built, new crops will be introduced,
and sheep and goat farming
increased. Fish-farming, apiculture
and animal vaccination programmes
will also be carried out. In addition
the villagers will be provided with
schools and dispensaries which will
encourage them to settle in one
place. In a word, a partnership
between man and Nature will
become possible. Dr. Petter summed
up the policy as follows: "To protect
the lemurs is to protect the
Malagasy."
As the most recent biosphere
reserve to be inaugurated by Unesco,
Mañanara stands to gain from
experience accumulated in other
reserves in the humid tropics. Like
other biosphere reserves, two-thirds
of which are located in industrially
developed countries, Mañanara con¬
sists of three zones: a strictly pro¬
tected core area; a carefully
delineated buffer zone destined for
research, education and environ¬
mental training activities, as well as
leisure activities and tourism; and a
transition area where efforts are
made to encourage co-operation
between researchers, managers, and
the local population, with a view to
promoting long-term development of
the region's resources while fully
respecting the aims of the reserve.
The director of Unesco's Division
of Ecological Sciences, Mr. Bernd Von
Droste, believes that the purpose of
biosphere reserves goes far beyond
the material aspects of development.
.He sees the reserves as a cultural
enterprise in the widest sense of the
term and a justification of interna¬
tional solidarity. Of fundamental
importance for the future of
humanity, they are what J. Ronald
Engel of the University of Chicago has
called "sacred spaces". By associating
the protection of animal and plant life
with the economic and social
development of local populations,
they contribute to the conservation
of biological diversity, genetic
resources and ecosystems.
The 286 biosphere reserves in 72
countries play a key role in Unesco's
Man and the Biosphere (MAB)
Programme. Created in 1971, MAB
seeks to provide the scientific basis
for the study of problems related to
the wise use of resources, by
associating in each case the local
populations who are directly con¬
cerned. National MAB committees
have been created in over a hundred
countries and work in close associa¬
tion with the Unesco Secretariat.
The financial resources of the
MAB programme are still very
modest. Perhaps the story of the
lemurians of Madagascar, whose
name is of Latin origin and means
"the spirits of the dead", will help to
awaken the conscience of mankind.
