MARIA SKLODOWSKA
The Dreamer in Warsaw
by Leopold Infeld
B EFORE the last war, in
Warsaw, near the Vistula River stood
the castle of the Polish kings which
served as the residence of Poland's
presidents between the two world wars.
Nearby lay the Old Town with its
medieval buildings, known from the
pictures by Canaletto (See the "Unesco
Courier", March 1961). Near the Old
Town was the "New Town", built a
little later.
The last war destroyed the castle,
the Old Town and the New Town
even more thoroughly than the rest of
LEOPOLD INFELD, a leading Polish physi¬
cist and a member of his country's Academy
of Sciences, is head of the department of
theoretical physics at the University of
Warsaw and director of the Institute of
Theoretical Physics. From 1933 to 1935
fie was at Cambridge University where he
collaborated with the famous physicist Max
Born. From 1936 to 1938 he was at Prin¬
ceton University where he worked with
Professor Albert Einstein and from 1938 to
Î950 fie was lecturer and then professor at
Toronto University. He is the author of
numerous scientific books, among them:
"The Evolution of Physics" , which he wrote
with Albert Einstein.
Warsaw which was almost completely
obliterated by the Nazis.
The present government decided to
rebuild the Old and the New Town
exactly (at least externally) as they
were in the times of the last Polish
king and are known from old pictures
and plans. Thus for a man born a
hundred years ago, the rebuilt Old
and New Town would seem stranger
than to someone born 200 years ago.
!n the New Town there is a small
thoroughfare called Fréta Street, and
at number 16 a plaque records that
in 1867 Maria Sklodowska was born
there. One hundred years ago that
is, four years after the last Polish
Uprising was crushed. Afterwards
Czarist repression became even stron¬
ger than before, as did the patriotic
feelings of the Poles.
The mother of Maria ran a small
private school at 16 Fréta Street and
her husband, Wladyslaw Sklodowski,
was a secondary school teacher of
mathematics and physics. Maria's
parents were members of the small
Polish gentry. They formed a closely

In this section of
Warsaw's "New Town"
(destroyed during the
last war and completely
rebuilt since 1945),
Maria Sklodowska was
born and spent her
youth. Later, when she
became Marie Curie,
she wrote in her
autobiography of those
early days» "I devoted
most evenings to my
own education. I had
heard that a certain
number of women
had managed to enter
schools of higher
education in
St. Petersburg or abroad
and I determined to
prepare myself to
follow them one day."
knit family in which there were five
children, four of them girls Zosia,
Maria, Bronia, Helena and one son,
Joseph. All, with the exception of
Helena Sklodowska Szalay, died
before the last world war.
There must have been a really cul¬
tured atmosphere in the Sklodowski
home. Let me quote a passage from
the biography of Maria Sklodowska
Curie by her daughter, Eve Curie,
who writes :
"It was true that Mr Sklodowski
knew everything, or nearly everything.
The poor man, father of a family,
balancing his budget with the greatest
difficulty, had found leisure to develop
his scientific knowledge by going
through publications which he procur¬
ed by considerable effort. It seemed
to him quite natural to keep up with
the progress of chemistry and physics,
just as it was natural to know Greek
and Latin and to speak English, French
and German (as well as, of course,
Polish and Russian); to translate the
finest works of foreign authors into his
native language in prose or verse..."
The family often moved house,
depending on the state of their finan¬
ces. Nowollpki, Karmelicka and Leszno
Streets appear in the early biography
of Maria. Before the last war I knew
these streets well. They we're in the
heart of the Jewish district. They
were ugly, narrow cobble-stoned
streets, often jammed with horse-drawn
droskies filled with merchandise.
In the Russian gymnasia (high
schools) which prepared students for
the University, pupils were not allowed
to talk to each other in their mother
tongue. They were not allowed to do
so even in the street. Polish was
treated and taught as a foreign lan¬
guage. If someone was found guilty
of the "crime" of speaking Polish he
was denounced and punished by soli¬
tary confinement. A second offence
led to a beating and if it happened for
the third time the culprit was expelled
from the school and no other school
could accept him. But the attempts of
the Czarist authorities to Russify
Poland by such draconic laws proved
a completa fiasco.
Some Polish students attended pri¬
vate schools, at least for the beginning
of their education. The young Maria
went to Jadwiga Sikorska's school for
girls at the corner of Marszalkowska
and Królewska Street. Schools like
this which did not give the right to
enter university, were centres of Polish
patriotism and organized resistance.
At a moment's notice, when a certain
bell rang in the class a warning that
the Czarist inspector had come to
visit the school everything changed
in a few .seconds as if by magic. A
patriotic lesson in Polish history would
suddenly become a lesson on mathe¬
matics conducted in Russian. Such
changes were made easier by the
rottenness and corruption of the
Czarist Regime. Almost all the inspec¬
tors were ready to take bribes, usually
handed to them between the covers
of a book.
ARIA was the best student
in her class. In order to enter any
university anywhere she also had to
finish the hateful gymnasium which
she did, winning a gold medal when
she was barely 17 years old. The
Czarist university at that time did not
accept girls. In any case, few Poles
attended it and from 1905 there was
an organized boycott of all govern¬
ment schools, including the university.
Yet it was impossible to curb the
Polish spirit of learning. As they did
60 years later under the Nazi occu¬
pation, the Poles organized a "univer¬
sity on the run" : classes were held
secretly, each time in a different home.
The students also brought education
to the workers. The young people
around Maria felt that what the people
of Poland needed most was educa¬
tion.
It was the era of Positivism in lit¬
erature and the time when Polish youth
rebelled against Romanticism. They
were influenced by philosophers like
Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer;
they recognized the importance of the
work of great scientists such as Pas¬
teur and Darwin. Maria was also
influenced by this trend. Indeed, we
know from a letter to her father that
she read Spencer's books on sociology
in French and "a wonderful book on
anatomy and physiology by Paul Bert
in Russian."
Maria Sklodowska was 18 when her
older sister Bronia went to Paris to
study medicine.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that
while in Paris Bronia met and married
Doctor Dluski, and that after they
returned to Poland the young couple
established a sanatorium in Zakopane.
This health resort, lying in the beautiful
Tatra Mountains later became a vaca¬
tion resort for Pierre and Maria
Slodowska Curie, who were among the
first to discover Zakopane, now known
as "the pearl of Poland".
While Bronia was in Paris, her father,
on his salary as a school teacher,
was unable to go on supporting the
burden of paying for his daughter's
studies. Maria agreed to help, and a
position of governess was offered to
her by the Zurawski family.
During the holidays the Zurawski's
eldest son Karol came home from the
University where he was studying
mathematics. A love-affair began
between Maria and Karol. Maria had
beautiful platinum blond hair, gray,
sparkling eyes, and a determined
mouth. Karol was the first young, well
educated man in whom she had
become interested.
But a marriage between the daughter
of a gymnasium teacher and the son
of a landowner was regarded in 19th
century Poland, as in most of Europe,
as a "mesalliance". The parents of
the boy did not give their consent.
I met Karol Zurawski when he was
about 50; I was around 20 and a
student at the Jagellonian University,
Cracow, where he was then a profes¬
sor of mathematics.
He was a good mathematician and
there is still a theorem in hydro¬
mechanics known by his name. I saw
him even after the Second World War
in Warsaw, where he had moved from
Cracow, and where he died, twenty
years after Maria's death.

THE DREAMER IN WARSAW (Continued)

Maria's interest in mathematics
started just at the time when she met
him. She was always very capable
and had a good memory. But I believe
her friendship with Karol showed her
the first vista of the beauty of mathe¬
matics.
If one once understands Mathematics
and Physics, one becomes their slave
and lover for the rest of one's life
as did Maria Sklodowska.
When she returned to Warsaw she
worked for some time in the Museum
of Industry and Agriculture. There,
under the guidance of her relative
Joseph Boguski, who later became a
professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic,
the young girl enjoyed her first ex¬
periments in physics and chemistry.
Because of the disappointment of
her first love, because of her awakened
interest in Science and because Rus¬
sian universities were closed to women,
Maria decided to go to Paris in 1891
and to study there. She intended to
return to Poland as a qualified teacher
in mathematics and physics. Although
fate interfered with her plans, she
was always in close touch with her
family and with her country, which
she visited many times.
IN May 1912, after the
death of her husband, and after the
Curies had received the Nobel Prize,
à Polish delegation was sent to Paris.
Among its members was the famous
writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, author of
"Ouo Vadis", who urged Maria to re¬
turn to Warsaw to continue her scien-
tifio work there.
Maria's daughter writes that it was
a difficult decision for her to take.
But I find this hard to believe.
Warsaw was then a desert as far as
experimental physics was concerned,
and no experimental scientist can work
in a desert. She promised, however, to
direct from afar the new laboratory
that was planned and she recommen¬
ded for posts on its staff her two most
talented Polish students, Jan Danysz
and Ludwik Wertenstein.
The laboratory was opened in August
1913. Money had been provided by
an industrialist who wished the labora¬
tory to be named after his son, a pupil
of Maria's in Paris, who had died as
a young man. So the laboratory,
named for Dr. Kernbaum, was created,
and for its inauguration Maria visited
Poland and gave a lecture in Polish.
The history of this laboratory,
belonging to the " Learned Society of
Warsaw", and the role it played in the
scientific development of Poland
deserve a few words.
Jan Danysz, one of the Polish stu¬
dents recommended by Maria, was
killed a few years later in the Battle
of Verdun. His son is now a distin¬
guished physicist in Warsaw, and is
the co-discoverer, with Jerzy Pniewski,
oí the fundamental particles known as
hyperons.
The laboratory was directed by Pro¬
fessor Wertenstein, undoubtedly the
most distinguished but officially the
least recognized experimental physicist
in Poland of the generation between
the world wars. It had little or no
State support, though in 1921 it rec¬
eived an important grant from Maria.
Yet, because of its scientific work and
because of the schooling it gave to a
few young scientists, it became known
throughout the world as the only
laboratory in which studies on nuclear
physics were kept alive in Poland.
When, after the First World War, a
free Poland was created, Maria dream¬
ed of building a big institute in
Warsaw devoted to research on radium
and its power for healing. But the
new-born country spent vast sums on
its military preparations and it was
left to a specially organized society to
collect money and to present the
Institute as "a national gift" to Maria
Sklodowska Curie.
In 1925 Maria came to Warsaw to
lay the corner-stone for the laboratory
building, and in 1932, when the hospital
at the Institute was finished, Maria
again came to Warsaw to present the
Institute with a gramme or radium
which she had received in the U.S.A
Two years later Maria died, and
seven years later night fell on Europe.
Science is an international venture.
There is no English, French or Polish
Science. But there are contributions
of each country to the development of
science, usually commemorated by
the names of the men responsible for
each gigantic step forward.
On its way science smashes old
dogmas, looking for new truths. The
dogma of the Moving Sun was demo¬
lished by the work of Copernicus,
Gallileo, Kepler, Newton, Laplace,
Einstein. It would be idle to ask who
was the greatest. But the first of them
was Copernicus.
The dogma that the atom is the
indivisable, smallest part of matter was
smashed by Pierre and Marie Curie,
by Irène and Frederic Jolliot-Curie, by
Sir Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, and
a hundred others who came after
them. But the first were Pierre and
Marie Curie.
Poland can be justly proud to have
given to the world Copernicus and
Maria Sklodowska Curie.
