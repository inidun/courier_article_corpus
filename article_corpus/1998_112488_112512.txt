In June 1992, heads of state from eleven coun-
t ri e s — A l b a n i a , A rm e n i a , A z e r b a i j a n , B u l g a-
ri a ,G e o r gi a ,G r e e c e ,M o l d ova ,R o m a n i a ,R u s-
s i a , Turkey and Ukraine—signed a treaty in
Istanbul setting up the Black Sea Economic Co-
o p e r ation Regi o n .I n c o n c e i vable fifteen ye a rs ago,
this initiat i ve is one of the most dramatic changes
to have taken place in the region since the fall of
the Berlin wa l l .W h at e ver the part i c i p a n t s ’c a l c u-
l at i o n s , tactical considerations and ulteri o r
m o t i ve s , the project illustrates their desire to ease
tensions in the region and establish dialogue.
Two major changes have swept through the
Black Sea regi o n . F i rs t , the herm e t i c a l l y - s e a l e d
border between Tu r k e y, a member of NATO,
and its Wa rs aw Pact neighbours opened up.
S e c o n d , r e l ations between the former Sov i e t -
bloc countries are radically different today from
w h at they were before 1989. In this new
c o n t e x t , r e gional security will probably conti-
nue to hinge on the two main Black Sea powe rs ,
Russia and Tu r k e y, especially since access to the
B o s p h o rus and Dardanelles straits is likely to
remain on the agenda. But that issue will no
longer be framed in the same way it was duri n g
the Cold Wa r. Economic and env i r o n m e n t a l
m at t e rs , especially the transport of oil from
R u s s i a , Kazakhstan and A z e r b a i j a n , will be
more important than they were in the past.
Passage through the straits is at the heart of
the issues concerning the Black Sea because
the transport of oil and gas from the Caspian
Sea is one of the pivotal questions in the region
t o d ay. The 30-year contract for exploiting
Azerbaijani oilfields signed in September 1994
was called the “deal of the century”.The agree-
ment provides for the extraction of 511 million
tonnes, half of which are earmarked for export.
Planned investments amount to $7.5 billion.
Seventy per cent of the profits will go to
Azerbaijan while the members of the consor-
tium, made up of Azerbaijani, Russian and
Western companies, will split 21 per cent.
Three smaller consortiums have been formed
since.
Two proposed pipeline routes were ruled
out from the start. The United States was
opposed to the so-called “Iranian” route, and
Azerbaijan opposed another that would have
run in a straight line through Armenia. Two of
the three options still under considerat i o n
involve the Black Sea.
The first consists of using the existing,
ageing pipeline that connects Azerbaijan and
the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.
That option is financially advantageous and
meets with Moscow’s approval, but Turkey
raises objections on security and environmental
grounds, especially in relation to the cities of
Istanbul and Canakkale.
The second solution would be to build a
new pipeline through Georgia and Tu r k e y. Two
va riants are possible. In the firs t , more likely
c h o i c e , the pipeline would end up at Supsa, a
G e o r gian Black Sea port . In the second, i t
would branch off at Tbilisi and lead to the
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. T h at
solution is ve ry expensive , but would have the
a d vantage of “cutting the cake in two ” a n d
decreasing consumers ’ energy dependence on
R u s s i a . H owe ve r , s e c u rity is a concern since the
Kurdistan Wo r k e rs Pa rty (PKK) has already
announced its intention to sabotage the project.
The possibility remains of shipping oil via
the Black Sea, to the Bulgarian port of Burgas
and thence to the Greek port of
Alexandropolis. That would pose several pro-
blems, including passage into the Aegean Sea,
which is disputed by Athens and A n k a r a .
Another obstacle is that this solution would
bypass Turkey and its high cost could only be
met by the European Union, which would put
a further strain on its relations with Ankara.
A host of factors will influence the choice of
a pipeline route, including the clout wielded by
the United States and other powers such as
China, especially in regard to the transport of
oil from Kazakhstan. Oil, regional co-operation
and military rivalries are some of the issues that
still make the Black Sea one of the world’s most
sensitive geostrategic areas. ■

On the borders of the former Soviet empire, with an
outlet onto sensitive areas of the Mediterranean, the
Black Sea is attracting envious eyes.
