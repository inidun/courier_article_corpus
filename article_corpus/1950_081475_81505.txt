BACH-THE GENIUS
WHO SERVED TRUTH
by Georges FRADIER
BACH continues to grow in statÙl'e. On. the 28th July, 1750, only a handfu,
of discerning musicians and lovers of music, including the King of
Prussia, to whom the old master had recently dedicated his,"Musika-
lisches Opfer", mourned the end of a r are virtuoso. Outside his family and a
few pupils, the compositions which had piled up in his cupboards over a period
of fifty years, were scarcely known.
A century later, Bach's
genius received somewhat
wider recognition but that
recognition was still limit-
ed. A group of intellec-
tuals in Germany, under-
took an up-to-date edition
of his works, or of what
remained of them. Bach
had become the mysterious
master of World-famed
musicians : Mendelssohn
had revived"The Passion

to the younger musicians,
Schumann offered the
"Well-Tempered Clavier",
with the advice :"make it

to celebrate the bi-centen-
ary of Bach, in order to
take on the air of a capi-
tal city, for a few hours or
weeks. The massive figure
of Johann Sebastian Bach,
father of Music, continues
and will continue to domi-
nate the'world.
He Lived So Simply

of art, a nobler or pur-
er mind. lIe lived so sim-

But in the twentieth cen-
tury, the art of Johann Se-
bastian is ageless ; it is no
more"old"than a Cretin
fresco or a mediaeval ca-
thedral. For Bach believed
himself to be neither a
prophet nor an innovator :
he simply placed his ge-
nius so much in the service
of truth, that this truth to-

more than one person who
seeks'a refuge in the con-

20th century, can still find

and peace-the music

ner, then Brahms, avowed
their allegiance to the"pa-
triarch who had preceded
them".
In 1050, two hundred
years after his death, Bach
truly came into his own.
There have been innumer-
able Bach festivals, special
days devoted to Bach, Bach
concerts, gramophone re-
cords and programmes on
the radio, consecrated sol-
ely to Bach.
Father Of Music

many organized a se-
ries of festivals in both the
East and the Western zo-
nes, arranged by a central
committee. The New Bach
Society held a festival at
Göttingen, west of the
Elbe, from 23-30 July, and
at Leipzig on the east from
2G-30 July. From if-20
July, the German Society
of Musicology organized a
General Congress on Musi-
cology in Luneburg, where
Bach studied, and from 23-
2G July the Society held a
Bach Seminar in Leipzig.
