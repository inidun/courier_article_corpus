IT HAPPENED
IN MARCH...
PARCH, once the first month of the year, has always hand a special signi-ficance for poets, chiefly because its twenty-first day, the vernal equinox,
marks the beginning of Spring in the northern hemisphere. With Spring
comes the re-awakening of the earth and the resumption of ploughing, and
this, at the half U ! Gy point of a century facing gigantic agricultural problems
to feed mankind, is of special significance.
March 21 has been proposed as an appropriate date on which to honour the
nameless inventors of man's basic food producing instrument, the plough.
Unfortunately, we do not even know when or just where they lived. We do
know, however, that, four thousand years before Christ, the Sumerians inherited
the primitive swing-plough from a civilization of which all trace has been lost.
Yet, that same plough, just as Virgil described it in the first Georgie, is still
found in same countries to-day.
It was the Greeks and the Gauls who thought of attaching two wheels to the
plough, athough, after their time, it remained practically unchanged until the
eighteenth century. Then it was transformed by the addition of a mould-board,
two steel shares and four wheels. Later it was to become even more complex
and, last of all, it was fitted with a motor. In 1800 it took a man 120 hours to
plough, harrow, sow and harvest two and a half acres of ground. To-day it takes
him 15.
THE"Fatherof Czecho-
slovakia",
born on 7
March 1850,
was the son of
an emancipa-
ted serf. By
turn teacher.
journalist and
member of
parliament, on
his 60th birth-
day he told his
followers :"I
have hardly
begun". He
had yet to
become a
conspirator, a
diplomat, a...--L-..
MASARYK
strategist, a revolutionary and a
statesman. He was still to found
a republic and to guide its destiny
for 15 years.
Before his death, he watched
with distress the rising tide of
Fascism, and he at that time
wrote :"We must realize that
patriotism and international res-
ponsibility go hand in hand. Pa-
triotism and internationalism
supplement one another".
o N 8 March1850, this
ex-bank-
clerk from
Gottingen
founded the
news agency
which bears
his name.
Newspapers
were then
being read by
more and more
people ; busi-
ness and
polities both
demanded
news with less
and less delay ;
Julius REUTER
Reuter's aim was to become the
press correspondent and reporter
for the whole world. He began by
establishing a carrier-pigeon link
between France and Germany and
went on to organize a service of
small steamboats between ships
and their harbours. In a short
time he was using the telegraph
and submarine cables.
IN March1750, Leo-
nard Euler
of Basle pu-
blished his In-
troduction to
the Differen-
tial Calculus.
One hundred
years later,
March 1850,
Rodolph Clau-
sius, a native
of Pomerania,
worked out
the rudiments
of a new
science Ther-
modynamics.
After 55 more years, in March 1905,
Albert Einstein published an article
entitled :"Zur Elektrodynamik
bewegterkorper" (Electro Dyna-
mics of Moving Bodies) in a Berlin
journal. Men had never dreamed
that pure science could have such
an effect on their lives. Euler, a
founder of what was called"pure
mathematics", was only investigat-
ing analysis. Clausius was only
applying analysis to the principles
of the conservation and dissipation
of energy, to deduce the bases of
the kinetic theory of gases. Ein-
tein simply discovered a mathema-
tical equivalence between thermo-
dynamics and mechanics ; energy
and mass became one and the same
thing ; and the mass of any par-
ticle of matter corresponded to a
certain quantity of energy. But
Einstein also showed that the
quantity was tremendous-that
the energy in material is equal to
its mass multiplied by the square
of the speed of light. No discovery
has ever offered greater hope-
or a greater threat to humanity.
AT the time of"his death,
on 12 March
1925, Sun Yat
Sen, who was
the first Pre-
sident of the
young Republic of China, had be-
come for his countrymen the very
pattern of the modern Chinese.
He converted the idea of the
right of the governed to call the
government to account into a
rallying-cry for millions.
Sun Yat Sen himself had writ-
ten :"I am a coolie and the son
of a coolie. I was born in poverty
and I am still poor. My heart has
always been with the struggling
masses".
