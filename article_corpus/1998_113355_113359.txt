For years ‘community mothers’ have been helping to bring up children in
Colombia, a country plagued by violence and poverty
In the mid-1980s, the Colombian
g ove rn m e n t , a l a rmed by ve ry high
r ates of infant mortality and malnu-
t ri t i o n , launched a far-reaching pro-
gramme to protect pre-school-age chil-
d r e n , with the help of the United Nat i o n s
and the Inter-American Deve l o p m e n t
B a n k .
The first “ we l fare centres”, a l s o
k n own as h o b i s, opened in the slums of
C a l i , an industrial city of almost two mil-
lion people, in Cart a g e n a , w h o s e
550,000 inhabitants live mainly off the
petrochemical industry, and Guspi, a
small town in the southwest of the coun-
t ry. They were run by vo l u n t e e rs know n
as “community mothers ” who organized,
on their own or with the help of NGOs,
e d u c ation and care facilities for about
3,000 children. The programme initially
reached only 7 per cent of the popula-
tion concern e d .
K i n d e r g a rtens for the children of
working mothers appeared in Colombia
in 1974. But a new educational model
a rri ved in 1977 with “ n e i g h b o u r h o o d
c e n t r e s ” based on parental and commu-
nity part i c i p at i o n . These centres soon
opened their doors to ve ry poor children,
with the help of UNICEF and the
Colombian Institute for Family We l fa r e
( I C B F ) , an official body with ministeri a l
p owe rs in charge of policy concern i n g
the family and the protection of minors.
In 1987, the ICBF funneled 8 per cent of
its funds to the community mothers and
offered them an institutional framewo r k .
To d ay, the figure is 40 per cent.
The $55 million ICBF programme now
reaches 60 per cent of ve ry needy children in
1,042 towns in a country where, a c c o r d i n g
to figures provided by the United Nat i o n s
D e velopment Programme (UNDP), o n e
p e rson in five gets by on
less than two dollars a
d ay. It won part i c u l a r

flour made from soy-
b e a n s , w h e at , maize or
rice supplied free by the
g ove rnment through the
community mothers
n e t wo r k .
The “ m o t h e rs ” , who now number
82,000, are becoming increasingly impor-
tant and are in gr e at demand by fa m i l i e s
d i s rupted by the violence, which as of
Ja n u a ry 1998 had forcibly dri ven 1.1 million
people (42,000 families) from their homes.
Each mother takes about fifteen chil-
dren into her home and gets the equiva-
lent of about half the legal minimum
wage (about $130 a month) and the ri g h t
to social security and a pension. A p a rt
from food for her group (which she can
also gi ve to her own children), the ICBF
p r ovides utensils and a few staple items.
It also grants a small loan to install sepa-
r ate washing and toilet facilities for the
children and to improve hy giene in the
k i t c h e n , the eating areas, the bedrooms
and the court ya r d , where the children
spend most of their time. About a mil-
lion and a half chil-
d r e n , aged from two to
s e ve n , are looked after
and socialized in this
way before they go to
s c h o o l , while their real
m o t h e rs are out at
wo r k .
The community
m o t h e rs do their best to
adapt their hours to
those of the working parents, but as a rule
they look after the children between eight in
the morning and four in the afternoon from
Monday to Friday.They organize their day
t h e m s e l ve s , guided by the ICBF’s educa-
tional aims, which focus on making the chil-
dren aware of values such as solidari t y,
f riendship and respect for differences.A c t i-
vities are divided into three main cat e g o-

dren through games, with an emphasis on
social skills; using role-playing to fa m i l i a-
rize them in groups with real-life situat i o n s ,
like going shopping or visiting the doctor;
and allowing the children to express them-
s e l ves by talking about their personal expe-
riences or even describing their dreams.
An apprenticeship 
in social skills
The activities va ry according to the age
of the child, with the older ones being
introduced to the main school subjects if
the community mother is capable of
doing this. O ver the past twenty ye a rs ,
the mothers have managed, often with
s u p p o rt of NGOs, to acquire more skills
and undeniable social recognition, bu t
m a ny have not managed to finish their
s c h o o l i n g, and some cannot even read.
“There is no official cert i f i c ate which
s ays you can be a community mother,”
s ays Lilia Labrador, the ICBF’s head of
pre-school educat i o n , “ but they have a
chance to study to secondary school gr a-
d u ation level through coaching schemes
recognized by the education ministry.”
Before being hired, the “ m o t h e rs ” g o

future role and take a self-assessment

their experiences and work out together
a ny problems. These courses gi ve some
community mothers a chance to take up
other work and skills or be chosen for
other ICBF programmes such as fa m i l y
e d u c ation or education for pregnant

Substantial funds are needed to ru n

h owe ver and evasion is widespread. S o
money has to be scraped together where-
ver it can be found. For example, p u b l i c
l aw 333 of December 1996 stipulat e s
t h at the proceeds of money, houses and
vehicles seized from drug smugglers by
the national narcotics authority must go
to support street children.
But things are not so simple. S y l v i a n e
B o u r g e t e a u , r e p r e s e n t at i ve in Bogota of a
French watchdog on dru g s , the Observa-
toire Geopolitique des Drogues, s ays the
l aw has “ n e ver been applied.” A p a rt from
the inheritance tangles that arise after
d rug seizures, the new occupants of
houses confis c ated from drug smugglers
often get threatened or are bu r g l e d . T h e
then Colombian gove rnment even admit-
ted on its official website last 24 March
t h at despite the seizure of about 20,000
items of propert y, only one such confis-
c ation had been legally confirm e d .
A l s o, seized property does not alway s
fit the practical needs of the we l fare orga-
n i z at i o n s. The houses are ve ry luxuri o u s
and need costly refurbishing. S o m e t i m e s
when a bus is needed to take some chil-
dren somewhere, the only vehicle ava i-
lable is a Rolls Royce Gucci.
So the measure has its limits, but they
are not insuperable. Just before public
l aw 333 was passed, the ICBF managed
to conve rt a former disco seized from
d rug smugglers in the chic Zona Rosa
area of Bogota into a centre for haemo-
p h i l i a c s. And more recently, the lat e s t
a n t i - d rugs publicity campaign directed at
young people was financed by money sei-
zed by the national narcotics authori t y.
