Some women’s groups consider prostitutes as victims; others regard them 
as ‘sex workers’ with rights
■
“Ever since the Chinese declared ‘To
get rich is to be glori o u s ,’ wo m e n
without connections, brain power or
money have been using the only asset ava i-
lable to them for quick money. Equipped
with a room,a bed,a supply of condoms, a
red light—and voila—instant brothel. . . .
These girls can make much more money
at $30 a customer, than $4 per day in the
fa c t o ri e s. As is (the case) in almost eve ry
u n d e r d e veloped country ! ” according to the
International Sex and Red-Light Guide.
Sold for $30, the guide “ i n s t ru c t s ”m e n
on where to find cheap sex around the
wo r l d .This is a business ve n t u r e ,a c c o r d i n g
to the authors, where the only principle is
getting the most for your money.“If one so
chooses to use her body in this manner, in
lieu of social slave ry at the hands of pove rt y
e m p l oye rs , and men are willing to pay them
more than slave labour wages,so be it.If it
is not your body and not your life,it is also
not your bu s i n e s s. Until [someone] can
c o rrect the whole wo r l d ’s economic condi-
t i o n , as well as the ove rp o p u l ation problem,
someone has to pay the bills.”
But who? The poorest, the most vulne-
rable? There is no denying that the sex indus-
t ry has taken on intern ational dimensions,
recognized as an economic motor for many
c o u n t ri e s , p a rticularly in A s i a .The irony is
t h at prostitution is not entirely legal.Wo u l d
l e g a l i z ation reduce some of the inequalities
and abuse suffered by the women invo l ve d ?
Or by legitimizing prostitution, would we
r e ve rse decades of work to promote human
rights and improve the status of wo m e n ?
An acrimonious debate
On the surface this looks like a rehashing
of a timeless debat e .But it isn’t .The question
is no longer about morality—is prostitution a
vice and are those invo l ved evil or somehow
lacking in judgment? We now ask: is prosti-
tution a form of exploitation to be abolished
or an occupation to be regulat e d ?
This has proven to be one of the most
divisive issues among women’s groups
around the wo r l d .There are basically two
camps—those seeking to eradicate prostitu-
t i o n , like the non-gove rnmental Coalition
Against Trafficking in Women and prosti-
t u t e s ’ rights gr o u p s , p ri m a rily based in the
N e t h e r l a n d s , the United States and England,
who view the women invo l ved as “sex wo r-
k e rs ” . There is considerable acri m o ny bet-
ween the two. For example, the Coalition
maintains that these groups generally repre-
sent the interests of the “pimps and procu-
r e rs ” . In rebu t t a l , the ri g h t s ’ groups main-
tain that the abolitionists are locked away in
the ivo ry towe rs of academic feminism, c u t
off from the day - t o - d ay realities facing pros-
t i t u t e s.
The dividing line between the two camps
lies in distinctions between so-called “ f r e e ”



Should prostitution be
l e g a l?
In the Netherlands, prostitution is legal for European Union residents.

and “ f o r c e d ” p r o s t i t u t i o n . A b o l i t i o n i s t s
generally maintain that the vast majority of
women are forced into prostitution,while the
sex wo r k e rs insist that this is not necessari l y
the case. But as both point out, for different
r e a s o n s , these distinctions ove rsimplify the
i s s u e s.The 12-year-old Nepalese girl sold to
an Aids-infested brothel in India clearly neve r
consented to this form of slave ry.The dru g -
addict in New York who must fulfil a quota of
clients to get a fix from her pimp is not free to
make decisions concerning her body. B u t
w h at of the Ukrainian woman who looses her
job and decides to go to Germ a ny to work as
a maid but ends up in a brothel?
For the Coalition, “the distinctions bet-
ween free and forced prostitution obscure
the powerful structural socio-economic
conditions—like pove rt y, m a r gi n a l i z at i o n ,
lack of opportunities and prior sexual
a bu s e — t h at often dri ve women and children
straight into prostitution situat i o n s ,” s ay s
Aurora Javate de Dios of the Coalition’s
A s i a - Pa c i fic branch.“Economic cri s i s ,n at u-
ral disasters , political unrest and confli c t
s i t u ations make women and children more
vulnerable and easy prey to sex traffickers
and recru i t e rs.We see this eve ry w h e r e ,e s p e-
cially in developing countries of the South.”
For Javate de Dios, l aws aimed at distingui-
shing between free and forced prostitution
will never recognize the complex dynamics
i nvo l ve d .The most they can possibly do is to
identify the most extreme forms of coercion,
while ignoring the impact of pove rty and
implicitly legitimizing pat riarchal relat i o n-
s h i p s.
The line between free and forced prosti-
tution also we a rs thin on the opposite side of
the spectru m , according to Lin Chew,a for-
mer spokesperson for the Fo u n d at i o n
Against Trafficking in Wo m e n , a non-gove rn-
mental organization based in the Nether-
l a n d s. “When does anyone make free deci-
s i o n s , especially in the labour market? A man
who works in a chemical fa c t o ry, w h o s e
wages will never get him over the pove rt y
line—did he choose this way of life? A n d
w h at about the woman whose backgr o u n d
n e ver afforded her the chance to develop any
skills? W hy should this question of free
choice only apply to prostitution?”
There is, h owe ve r , one point on which
the two camps agr e e : d e c ri m i n a l i z at i o n .I t ’s
time to repeal laws used to punish prostitutes
in seeking to protect public decency and
o r d e r. B e yond this, the two camps dive r g e .
For abolitionist groups like the Coalition,
women are victims, but anyone who profit s
from their exploitation deserves punishment.
For the prostitutes’ rights gr o u p s , h owe ve r ,
Manila prostitutes sail out to ships moored
offshore.
Prostitution and the law
■ According to the 1949 UN Conve n t i o n
for the Suppression of the Traffic in Pe rs o n s
and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of
O t h e rs , which has been rat i fied by 72 stat e s :
“prostitution and the accompanying evil of
the traffic in persons . . . are incompatible
with the dignity and wo rth of the human 
p e rs o n ....”Pa rties agree to punish anyone who:
“procures,entices or leads away, for pur-
poses of prostitution, another pers o n ,e ve n
with the consent of that person”;
“exploits the prostitution of another per-
s o n ,e ven with the consent of that pers o n ” ;
“keeps or manages, or knowingly fin a n c e s
or takes part in the financing of a brothel”;
“ k n owingly lets or rents a building . . . f o r
the purposes of prostitution”.
In practice, governments have develo-
ped three basic legal fa m e works concern i n g
prostitution:
Prohibition . The act of accepting pay-
ment for sex and sometimes paying for sex
is illegal and punished. This is the situa-
tion,for example,in the Gulf States and in
most of the United States.
C ri m i n a l i z at i o n .The law forbids cert a i n
activities related to payment for sex rat h e r
than paid sex itself.These activities include
soliciting for clients,a d ve rt i s i n g, living off the
e a rnings of prostitutes, r e c ruiting prostitutes
or helping them to circulate from one coun-
t ry to another.This is the most common legal
f r a m e work for commercial sex throughout
We s t e rn Europe, I n d i a , Southeast A s i a ,
C a n a d a ,Australia and the Pa c i fic and most of
L atin A m e ri c a .
R e g u l at i o n r e f e rs to exceptions to cri-
minal law made for those parts of the sex
i n d u s t ry which comply with certain condi-
t i o n s. In the case of female sex wo r k e rs ,
such systems are often linked to manda-
tory health checks.
Some examples:
In Brazil , prostitution is not illegal bu t
it is illegal to operate a brothel,to rent pre-
mises to prostitutes, exploit children or live
off the earnings of a prostitute.
In Canada , the law does not prohibit
the act of prostitution but criminalizes a
wide range of related activities like solici-
ting, living off the earnings of prostitution,
operating premises,etc.
In Denmark , it is not illegal to prov i d e
sexual services so long as prostitution is not
the main source of income (in which case
the charge is va gr a n cy ) .R e c ruiting is illegal.
Greece and Turkey have both legali-
zed prostitution.Women must register and
attend clinics for regular examinations, in
some cases as frequently as twice weekly.
In India , despite the many laws against
the sex industry and traditional caste-bound
p r o s t i t u t i o n ,prostitution and trafficking is still
c o m m o n . Conditions are ve ry bad for those
i nvo l ve d .
In Senegal , it is illegal to aid, a b e t , p r o-
cure or live off prostitution earnings or run a
b r o t h e l . Female prostitutes must regi s t e r ,
c a rry cards and have regular medical exams.
Most women take part in the informal sector.
Enforcement is we a k .
In T h a i l a n d , it is illegal to be a prostitute
or to live off a prostitute’s earn i n g s.H owe ve r ,
the laws are not consistently enforced. ■

‘Why do men choose to buy the bodies of millions of
women and children, call it sex, and seemingly get
tremendous pleasure literally over their bought bodies?’

you cannot help sex wo r k e rs by forcing their
e m p l oye rs undergr o u n d . But you can try to
l e vel the playing fie l d — t h at is ensure that
these wo r k e rs are protected from occupat i o-
nal hazards and receive fair treat m e n t .This is
probably the latest chapter in the debat e :t h e
role of the stat e .
Here we find two camps within the pros-
t i t u t e s ’ rights gr o u p s.One branch pushes for
complete decri m i n a l i z at i o n ,t h at is no regu-
l ation of the industry, while another support s
l e g a l i z at i o n . “ L e g a l i z e d ” prostitution refers
to a wide range of situat i o n s. It can simply
mean that prostitution is not against the law.
More often the case, t h o u g h , l e g a l i z ation is
s y n o nymous for regulat i o n , with laws enfor-
ced by police. Licenses can be issued, f o r
e x a m p l e , with mandat o ry health-checks.
Zoning laws may set up “eros centres” r e m o-
ved from residential areas. If brothels are ille-
g a l , it might be an offence for two prostitutes
to work out of the same house.A n t i - p i m p i n g
l aws may oblige a prostitute’s lover to prove
t h at he or she is financially independent.
Standards can also be set for the wo r k i n g
s p a c e , a s s u ring for example, sufficient ligh-
t i n g, quality mat t r e s s e s , fire precautions and
air supply. L aws can assure that a woman is
not obligated to drink alcohol with a client.
While appropri ate tax brackets can be set up
for earnings and rights to health insurance
and retirement ensured.
In theory, these regulations are intended
to protect prostitutes. But some do just the
o p p o s i t e , according to sex worker groups like
the US-based COYOTE, which calls for
complete decri m i n a l i z ation of prostitution.
Government-run brothels “would be the
p r o s t i t u t e ’s wo rst nightmare,”according to a
COYOTE position paper. “I can think of
nothing worse than having to work for a
bu r e a u c r at—especially in the sex industry —
where there is already a long and well docu-
mented history of abuse by the police. . . .
Perhaps brothels are an ideal situation for the
male clients—a man gets to go to a place
where all the women are lined up waiting to
be chosen—but it is an extremely uncomfor-
t a b l e ,d e grading situation for wo m e n . . . .”
As for licenses, they “do nothing to
ensure the safety of either the customer or
the prostitute.T h at is not to say that wo m e n
shouldn’t have frequent medical checks—
they should,” according to COYOT E , i n
reference to complaints that women are
t r e ated like cattle by health inspectors in
poorly equipped fa c i l i t i e s. “Just as a res-
taurant will lose its reputation if the food
isn’t fresh and its customers become ill,so
will the free market regulate the health stan-
dards of working women.”
For the Coalition Against Trafficking in
Wo m e n , the debate over the role of the stat e
is simply a way of stonewalling the real issues.
The term “sex wo r k e r ” d o e s n ’t dignify the
woman invo l ve d , it dignifies the pimps, p r o-
c u r e rs and traffickers. “ W h at prostituted
women must endure in their ‘ e m p l oy m e n t ’i s
w h at in other contexts would be the accepted
d e finition of sexual harassment and sexual
a buse in the wo r k p l a c e ,” according to Ja n i c e
R ay m o n d , of the Coalition. “Does the fa c t
t h at a fee is paid transform this abuse into a
‘ j o b ’k n own as ‘commercial sex wo r k ’ ? ”
Courses in sex work
R aymond points to cours e s , available for
a fee in the Netherlands, on how to do sex
wo r k ,c ove ring eve rything from role-play i n g
sessions in bars to and inform ation on tax
b r e a k s. “ W h at young girl would you encou-
rage to become ‘ s k i l l e d ’in this trade? W hy is so
much attention paid to promoting the ‘ t r a d e ’
and nothing done to help women get out of it?
Because its easier to believe that prostitution
is a choice for these wo m e n . . . . If the issue of
choice must be raised, let it be raised in the
context of the men who buy the sex of prosti-
