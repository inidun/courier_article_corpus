Cotton Mather, thé Puritan pastor in Boston,
found it hard to believe, but he finally published
thé "discovery" in a text - Some Account of What
Is Said of Inocuîating or Transplanting thé Small
Pox - and found himself thé laughing stock of
thé era's médical profession, with thé exception
of Zabdiel Boylston. He tested thé vaccine on
his own son and two of his slaves. It was a
success. He continued thé experiment on 241
people. Only six were infected. Late, Thomas
Jefferson had complète success with 200 slaves,
80 of them his own. After that, thé vaccine was
accepted by thé white population and saved a
good number of American soldiers from illness
during thé war of independence.
Edward Jenner, internationally recognized as
thé father of thé smallpox vaccine, wasn't bom
when Onesimus taught his master thé method
used by African healers to fight thé illness. Thé
young African had been deported to America in
1706. His name remains inscribed in thé history
of medicine, but in a footnote.
Other slaves kaew similar fates. A certain
César, for instance, devised an antidote for
rattlesnake bites, mixing several ingrédients
induding wood ash and tobacco. It is very
probable that thé remedy was based on
traditioaal African kaow-how. A description was
published in 1792, in Massachussets Magazine.
Thé remedy did not earn ils inventor worid

Général Assembly to restore his freedom.

People in thé United
States who want thé real
thing, not an imitation,
often say they want "thé
real McCoy. " But most
probably hâve no idea
that they are referring
to a gadget invented by
an African American,
Elijah McCoy. In 1872, he
received a patent for thé
drip cup, a tubricating
device for steam engines
that fed oil to moving
machinery, avoiding thé
waste and cost of having
to stop engines in order
to lubricate them. People
were so confident in thé
reliability of McCoy's
invention, which had a
séminal impact on thé
evolving railroad industry,
that to be sure they were
getting his device rather
than someone else's
imitation of it, they asked
for "thé real McCoy."
McCoy, who arrived in
thé United States after
thé Civil War, was thé
son of African-Americans
who had escaped from
enslavement and fled to
Canada.

Benjamin Banneker, son of a slave father
and free mother born in Maryland in 1731, was
granted more récognition. A brilliant astronomer
and mathematician, he published an Almanac
in 1791 containing such an impressive wealth of
information that Thomas Jefferson was prompted
to Write him a letter. In his letter, Thomas Jefferson
speaks of thé almanac as proof "that nature bas
given to our black brethren, talents equal to those
of thé other colors of men" and informs thé author
that he is sending it to Monsieur de Condorcet,
Secretary of thé Academy of Sciences in Paris. It
was a revolutionary gesture for thé time.
Thé Fédéral Gazette and thé Baltimore Daily
Advertiser also paid tribute to Banneker's genius,
publishing articles about thé "direct descendant of
an African" a few days after his death on October
25, 1806.
Other scientists such as thé engineer Lewis
Howard Latimer (1848-1928), who became one
of thé "Edison Pioneers", or Norbert Rillieux
(1806-1894) from New Orléans, whose process
for refining sugar cane juice into sugar is used
to this day, also received récognition. But for thé
most part thé scientific contributions of slaves and
their immédiate descendants remained cloaked
in silence. Too often, as in thé case of Onesimus,
it was thé masters who published or patented
thé slaves' inventions, with thé latter considering
themselves lucky to hâve their names even
mentioned.

personalities, who should be familiar to us,

a child of former slaves,

intermittently. Married at âge
