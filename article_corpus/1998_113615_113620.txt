study guides, financial advice for tuition and
more—all without hours or energy wa s t e d
waiting in line. If seeing is believing, w hy
not wander over to the students’ centre for
a quick visit? A few keystrokes on the
I n t e rnet and you are there.
Welcome to the world of online
e d u c at i o n . Students around the globe can
enrol in classes like Temasek’s, which cover
e ve rything from engi n e e ring to tourism and
even an introduction to Japanese Katakana
characters.Time and distance are no longer
an obstacle to learn i n g, as students dow n l o a d
specially designed courses according to their
own schedules, with tutorials and extra
m at e rials available via e-mail, CD-roms and
electronic libraries open around the clock.
E x a m s ,p a p e rs and even pri vate consultat i o n s
with professors or other students are all done
within the comfort of home.
In the last year, virtual classrooms of all
shapes and sizes have been under
c o n s t ruction around the wo r l d ,o f f e ring ve ry
real solutions for unive rsities and training
institutes threatened by dwindling public
resources and students needing more fle x i b l e
c o u rse mat e rials and schedules to compete in
t o d ay ’s job market. M e x i c o ’s Monterey
Institute of Te c h n o l o g y, for example, i s
d e veloping online courses and import i n g
them from universities north of the border.
E ven the World Bank is getting invo l ved with
plans for a virtual university in Africa.And
while it is natural to find traditional distance
e d u c ation prov i d e rs such as UK Open
U n i ve rsity breaking into this new field,
p r e s t i gious brand-name schools are also
i nve s t i n g . Duke Unive rsity of the United
S t ates has proudly opened its “ G l o b a l
Executive MBA” to a hand-picked class of
mostly intern ational businesspeople with
tuiton at $85,000.
This new distance education is a far cry
from the lowly correspondence courses of
w w w. $ $ $ @o n l i n e.
The construction boom in “virtual classrooms” is leading universitites to find
new partners and competitors in the corporate world
the past, seen as a “ s e c o n d - c h a n c e ” for those
who couldn’t make it in or have access to
regular educational channels. It also
represents not just another learn i n g
o p p o rtunity but a promising new market for
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations and computer
c o rp o r at i o n s ,vying to provide the “ p i p i n g ” —
s atellite systems, computer plat f o rms for
a d m i n i s t r ation or “ s m a rt cards” o f f e ri n g
access to electronic libraries—to delive r
s e rvices far and wide. From Germ a ny to
M a l ay s i a ,t e l e c o m m u n i c ations and computer
giants are negotiating “ w i ri n g ” costs with
public and pri vate learning institutions,n ow
seen as new part n e rs for computer companies
like Microsoft and Apple.
Consider the case of We s t e rn Gove rn o rs
U n i ve rsity (WGU) formed in 1997 by a
group of gove rn o rs from the we s t e rn United
S t at e s. C o nvinced that education was fa i l i n g
to meet the needs of employe rs and students
alike,they created a virtual university which
distributes services (courses) developed by
a s s o c i ated unive rsities and corp o r ate training
p r o gr a m m e s. The real surp rise lies in its
National Advisory Board,a powerful mix of
s t ate representat i ves and business leaders
from companies like Microsoft,Apple,Sun
M i c r o s y s t e m s , IBM and above all AT & T,
(one of the wo r l d ’s largest
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations companies), which has
donated more than $750,000.With backing
like this,the governors are broadening their
h o ri z o n s , m oving beyond the local market
by brokering co-operative agreements with
ove rseas “ s u p p l i e rs ” — u n i ve rsities and
telecom companies—in Ja p a n , the United
Kingdom,Canada,Mexico and China.
“Globalization is a term that gets used a
l o t , but just like trade and commerce,
e d u c ation is becoming more and more
i n t e gr ated across national borders ,” s ay s
Reidar Roll of the non-profit International
Council for Distance Education (ICDE),
which includes learning institutes and
c o rp o r ations in more than 130 countri e s.
“ We are beginning to see a more global
education market.”
Roll doesn’t seem to question the rise of
this “market”—a battle cry for those who see
education as a public responsibility and not
a commodity.Yet in this new electronic age of
distance educat i o n , the fine line between the
private and public sectors has been blurred
from the start .While unive rsities did much of
the research and development making online
l e a rning technologically possible—often with
c o rp o r ate support—it is the pri vate sector
which supplies the pieces needed to bu i l d
the virtual campus.
E ven the course content is market-based.
Online students are for the most part not
looking for philosophy or art history classes
but professional training in areas like bu s i n e s s
m a n a g e m e n t , financial serv i c e s , E n g l i s h ,
i n f o rm ation technologi e s , teaching and health
sciences.
In short , the incredible potential for
online learning lies in the insecurity of today ’s
job market as the eve r - s h o rtening shelf-life of
knowledge forces the “professionally fit”to
continually upgrade their skills. In Finland,
for example, 45% of employed adults
b e t ween the ages of 25 to 64 take part in
some form of career-related continuing
e d u c ation and training during a ye a r ,
according to a 1997 survey by the
O r g a n i s ation for Economic Co-operat i o n
and Development (OECD). E ven Canada’s
l ow rate of 28 per cent still represents
considerable demand.
“ People want to acquire the skills that
are applicable and enhance their mobility,”
says John Mallea, a Canadian expert in the
field and consultant for the OECD. “ I n
E a s t e rn and Central Europe, p r o f e s s i o n a l s
‘Globalization is a term
that gets used a lot, b u t
just like trade and
c o m m e rc e, education is
becoming more and
m o re integrated acro s s
national bord e rs ’

education
are studying international trade, European
l aw, financial serv i c e s , computer training and
English in numbers we haven’t seen before.
Until last ye a r ’s curr e n cy cri s i s , Asia was a
huge growth area,with more than 50 MBA
p r o grammes being offered in Hong Kong
alone,many by distance means.”
At the same time, r e gional trade
agreements in North America,Europe and
Southeast Asia are opening the door to free
trade in educational services,particularly in
professional training, which is considered
less sensitive than pri m a ry or secondary
schooling in terms of national autonomy.
“Education is considered a service like any
o t h e r ,”s ays a legal officer of the World Tr a d e
O r g a n i z at i o n , who points out that 30
c o u n t ri e s , from Ghana to Norway and
R wa n d a , h ave signed on to the General
A greement on Trade in Services (GAT S )
with specific commitments assuring foreign
p r ov i d e rs fair access to their educat i o n a l
markets.
A new market
in grey matter
For better or wo rs e , free trade in online
education is still far from a reality.A battery
of barri e rs or bu f f e rs—depending on yo u r
point of view—is firmly in place. To begi n
w i t h , academic accreditation systems are still
the preserve of national authorities and so
va ry gr e atly from one country to the next.
The lack of technological standards is another
obstacle in delive ring education from one
country or region to another.
At the same time, financial questions
remain on issues like taxation and intellectual
p r o p e rt y.For example, should an A u s t r a l i a n
c o m p a ny pay local revenue taxes for cours e s
sold in Malaysia? Or consider the case of
Mexican students attending a Canadian
u n i ve rs i t y.They usually pay higher admission
fees than local tax-paying students. Should
the same rules apply to their online
c o m p at riots? Finally, h ow can teachers
protect their intellectual property rights on
c o u rses and mat e rials beamed around the
world?
A long list of task forces and forums is
working in unive rsities and intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z ations to tackle these thorny issues.A t
the same time, the pri vate sector is more than
willing to help, by offering grants,technical
advice and other forms of support to ensure
a free flow of services.
Online learning is revolutionizing education as computer and telecommunications companies seek to develop this
new market.

While it is too soon for any accurat e
forecasts of the online education market—
e s t i m ates va ry from one to four billion dollars
for the year 2000—there are gr owing fears
t h at companies will eventually take over the
role of learning institutes. “If Microsoft
wanted to, they could create a unive rsity to
c o m p e t e ,” s ays Roll of ICDE.“Or if Harva r d
wanted to, they could enter alliances to offer
them (the companies) a brand name on the
i n t e rn ational market. I think the plans are
t h e r e .”
Not so fa s t , s ays Jim Ku h r , manager of
Microsoft’s worldwide education activities.
“ We don’t see ours e l ves as an educat i o n a l
c o m p a ny — we are not experts in curri c u l u m
or pedagogy.Our focus has been to work with
p a rt n e rs who are specialists
in that.But we do have an
interest in providing the
i n f r a s t ructure pieces—like
n e t work operating systems,
share files and e-mail—
needed to make distance
learning successful.”
While Kuhr recognizes
brand-name unive rsities as
obvious marketing targets,
the real heav y weights may
lie in developing countri e s
in Asia and Latin A m e ri c a .
“The enrolment potential is going up so
d r a m atically that the gove rnments cannot
afford to build the brick and mort a r
campuses to meet the demand. T h e s e
g ove rnments see online learning and other
o p p o rtunities in the inform ation society as a
way to radically move their countries ahead—
t h at is, if they find the initial investment for
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e .”
In fa c t , “ w i ri n g ” is becoming less of a
financial burden as telecom prices fall with
deregulation.And with the current spate of
m e r g e rs transforming the industry, n e w
markets like online education are becoming
all the more competitive.
AT & T ’s interest in online education is
“ m u l t i - l aye r e d ” ,according to Marilyn Reznick
of the telecom gi a n t ’s philanthropic
f o u n d at i o n .“ We have a responsibility to make
sure that people can understand the
t e c h n o l o gies we deve l o p. It is also in our
interest to send our philanthropic dollars to
u n i ve rsities where we do bu s i n e s s , r e c ru i t
p e o p l e , train our employees and do our R&D.”
“ We might also go to a unive rsity with
which we have relations and ask, ‘are yo u
going to provide the wo r k e rs we need?’ I f
n o t , we will help provide the resources to
d e velop that training. But we would neve r
dream of telling them how to teach.We are
not competing with them.”
A sigh of relief from the ivory towers? “I
am not sure that any corp o r ation will tell yo u
their strat e g y,” s ays To ny Bat e s , director of
the Distance Education and Technology unit
of Canada’s Unive rsity of British Columbia.
“And if they did, that strategy may change.
For instance, we are actually making a profit
on some of our online courses.Who knows
what will happen once that gets out.”
The secret to the unive rs i t y ’s success lies
in cherry-picking and niche-marketing.“To
offer a basic microbiology course, we would
need some competitive advantage over the
rest of the world,like a Nobel Prize winner,
which we don’t have.But with our contacts
in the forestry department, we are offering
c o u rses in wood science, for example, i n
Indonesia and A u s t r a l i a , where there is an
e m e r ging regional market
in secondary wo o d
products.
“All of this sounds like
someone trying to run a
bu s i n e s s , and I am
s u rp rised to find my s e l f
liking this role,” s ays Bat e s.
“This is in response to a
g ove rnment which tells us
to be less dependent on
t a xe s. This is not an
inevitable result of market
forces but a political
decision.”
H owe ve r , there is a fine line betwe e n
p r o fit-making and becoming profit - d ri ve n .
“ You have to ask,‘ w h at is the role of a publicly
funded college?” s ays Bat e s.“It is difficult to
justify tax dollars spent on education if the
p ri vate sector can do the job as well as the
public sector. But I think the public needs
some independent critique and analysis of
the government and private sector policies.
Somebody has to have the independence to
ask who is benefiting in a society.”
There is also a question of equity. “ T h e r e
are areas that you just cannot make money
o n , like education for the handicapped or
social work cours e s. T h at is where the
g ove rnment has to step in to ensure that all
s e c t o rs of society are served as much as
p o s s i b l e .” n
