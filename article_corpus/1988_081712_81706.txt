Declination of the Earth's magnetic field
The Earth's magnetic field is oriented slightly askew from what might be
expected. The magnetic North Pole is about 1,900 km from the geo¬
graphical true north of the planet. The difference between a finger pointing
at the true geographical North Pole and a compass needle pointing at the
magnetic North Pole is known as the angle of declination or variation; it is
not constant, and continually shifts. By the eighth or ninth century AD at
the latest, the Chinese had discovered this magnetic declination.
As Needham says, in doing so the Chinese were "antedating European
knowledge of the declination by some six centuries. The Chinese were
theorizing about the declination before Europe even knew of the polar¬
ity...." The magnetic compass and the polarity of the Earth's field are not
mentioned in any Western writing until 1 190 AD, and the Chinese had had
the compass for a good fifteen hundred years before that. In his Dream
Pool Essays of 1086, the medieval Chinese scientist Shen Gua wrote on
magnetic declination that "Magicians rub the point of a needle with a
lodestone; then it is able to point to the south. But it always inclines slightly
to the east, and does not point directly at the south. "
