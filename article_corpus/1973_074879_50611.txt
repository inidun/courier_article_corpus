Young scientists' round table at Unesco
ENVIRONMENT
AND POLITICAL
COMMITMENT

IN the midst of the current
debate on the environmental crisis,
young scientists have made their
voices heard on a number of impor¬
tant issues.
Over the past 18 months, Unesco
has participated in several internatio¬
nal meetings with young natural and
social scientists: at Enschede (Nether¬
lands) in July 1971, at a meeting
organized by the World Federation of
Scientific Workers on the theme
"Young Scientists and Contemporary
Society", and at Hamilton (Canada) in
August 1971, at the International Youth
Conference on the Human Environ¬
ment.
More recently, on the eve of the
1972 United Nations Conference on
the Human Environment in Stockholm,
Unesco brought together a small
group of young scientists from indus
trialized and developing countries, to
discuss two recent models of the
global future and the solutions which
they suggest.
The two models were the Massa¬
chusetts Institute of Technology-Club
of Rome study, "The Limits to
Growth", and the United Nations
World Plan of Action for the Appli¬
cation of Science and Technology to
Development. In the event, the young
scientists, meeting at Unesco's h.Q.
in Paris, focused most attention on
the first of these studies.
The Club of Rome initiative in mak¬
ing the study was generally welcomed.
Doubts were expressed, however, on
two quite separate issues: the meth¬
ods used to construct the computer
model; and the model's political impli¬
cations, particularly in view of the
"a-political" stance claimed by those
who produced it.
The young scientists questioned the
validity of the model on several
counts, but directed most of their cri¬
ticisms at its political aspects. For
most participants, the selection of five
basic parameters, of a purely techni¬
cal nature, meant that the model was
not one which applied to the real
world situation.
Why, they asked, were war, the
arms trade, colonialism and imperia¬
lism rejected as specific factors that
might, and indeed already were,
causing breakdowns? Why was the
unequal distribution of resources, bet¬
ween nations and within them, not
included in the analysis?
There. was considerable agreement
that all the model's assumptions were
conditional on an unaltered status
quo in world affairs; that it was a
"conflict-free" model of a world which,
in reality, is torn by conflict.

The model was also considered
to have some dangerous effects.
One participant described it as a
"recipe for stagnation" which would
do, and had already done, far more
to obscure ideas than the piecemeal
approach of the world's politicians
which the Club of Rome had sought
to avoid.
As the young scientists saw it, one
basic assumption behind the Club of
Rome model is that world population
growth is the essential cause of the
future breakdowns in society that the
model predicts. All the participants
agreed that population growth is nei¬
ther the only nor the main cause of
the environmental crisis. Other fac¬
tors involved are economic growth,
the type of technology used, particu¬
larly in developed countries, the
nature of existing political and eco¬
nomic systems, the high level of
consumption in the developed world,
etc., etc.
They saw high rates of population
growth as a symptom, and not a
cause, of underdevelopment which
results from political exploitation of
the developing countries by the dev¬
eloped.
Nearly all participants agreed that
the problems of development, of
family planning, of the relationship
between rich and the poor countries
and the problems of the environment,
cannot be analysed as separate
issues. The interdependence of these
factors means that the "environmental
crisis", as the industrialized countries
term it, is in reality a multiple crisis
or a series of convergent crises.
Young scientists from Third World
countries, in particular, pointed out
that a planetary disequilibrium had
always existed to the detriment of the
poor countries, broadly those in the
southern hemisphere.
Problems of the environment and
development were debated primarily
in their political context and only
secondarily, or not at all, in their
scientific context. This reflects the
increasingly prevalent view among
young scientists today that science
should be politically and morally
committed; that the value of science
is measured by the extent of its ethical
commitment; and that the rôle of
science should be seen as part of the
political context.
They also stressed the importance
of restoring public confidence in
science. The man in the street should
have a clearer understanding of the
ideas underlying science.
But they warned against the dan¬
gers of technological domination. In
many cases it would be better to
improve traditional practices rather
than introduce totally new forms of
technology. The right attitude would
be neither an unquestioning venera¬
tion of technological progress nor a
blind subservience to tradition.
The young scientists outlined a
major research programme which
would for the first time investigate
traditional labour technologies on a
decentralized basis. The aim should
be to put local resources and skills
to maximum use and to make scien¬
tists out of laymen rather than huma¬
nitarians out of scientists. A great
demand exists in developing and
industrially developed countries for
new technologies which are not harm¬
ful to the environment.
Finally, general agreement was
reached on a number of basic prin¬
ciples: that science can never be a
substitute for political debate, that
men must once again be counted as
men and not as statistics, that an
obsession with quantity must give
way to considerations of quality, and
that global analyses must be replac¬
ed by regional and local solutions
which will reintegrate man fully with
nature and with the technologies he
has created.
