LAST year we came to stay in Delhi.At First I was very lonely. I had
no friends to play with. So one
day father said,"What a lazy girl
you are. Why don't you go out and
play ?"You see, I did not want my
father to know the real reason. But
I'll tell you the reason. You know,
once I went to play, but the girls did
not take any notice of me. I did not
tell father because I thought he would
feel sorry. So now I said,"All right,
father, but..."Father did not care
for the"but"and said,"Go, darling".
So I dressed and went out. A girl
met me and said,"Come and play
with me."I was very happy and
played with her. After some time
her other friends came. And one of
them asked me"What is your caste ?"
I did not know, so I said,"I don't
know."When I came home I asked
father,"What is our caste ?" He said,
"We do not believe in caste."
The next day when I went to play,
the girls again asked me"What is
your caste ?"I said,"We do not
believe in caste."Then one girl said
to me,"But what are you ?"I said"I am a little girl". That girl be-
came annoyed and said,"Don't be
funny, are you a Muslim or a Hindu or
a Christian or a Parsi ?"I said,
"I am a Muslim."Then she said,
"We won't play with you."I was
very angry and sorry because I fool-
ishly thought that no girl would play
with me. So I went home with a
grumpy face.
The next day when he told me to go
out and play I said,"I won't go be-
cause they say I am a Muslim and
they won't play with me."Father
smiled and said,"Never mind, go and
play with your little niece. You have
to learn to make friends."
The next evening we were all sitting
in the drawing room. The bell rang
"Tring... Tring."I went and opened
the door, and saw a tall Sikh gentle-
man with a long white beard. His
wife and a girl of my age were with
him. I went and told father that
some people had come to see him and
he said,"Tell them to come in."
I did and then ran into my own
room. After some time father called me
and said,"Here is a new friend for
you. Go and show her your dolls
and books."I took her with me and
we two played nicely together. After-
wards they went away.
I asked mother,"What did that old
gentleman say ?"Mother said,
"Oh, they are very good people. You
know, they had heard that some girls
refused to play with you. So they
came to say,'If nobody plays with
your sweet little daughter, my daugh-
ter will play with her'."
So I started to play with her. And
then do you know what happened ?
After some time other girls also joined
us. Now we all have become friends.
One day my eldest sister, who has
passed her B. A. and thinks she is a
philosopher, said to me :"Syeda,
how many friends have you now ?"
I said,"Oh, lots and lots.""Who
are they ?"I answered."They are
all little girls, Hindus, Muslims, Chris-
tians. Sikhs and all, and we have now
made a little club. Its name is
"Happy-go-Incky Club."Then my
sister said,"There are so many people
in the world and if they also become
friends like you little girls have become
they can make the world a Happy-go-
lucky Club. Can't they ?"
