Facts and fig u r e s
Public expenditure on education has remained stable despite the steady
rise in enrolment. The private sector, which has long been involved in
education, has reinforced its position in the market and staked new
territory in software and computer tools for learning.
In general terms, the poorer the region,the smaller the
budget for public education.At all levels, public
expenditure per student has generally remained the same
in relation to the gross national product.
Yet it is widely believed that greater investment is
required to educate all students properly, including those
from disadvantaged backgrounds.

dramatic increase has been in developing countries:
primary and secondary enrolment has risen eight-fold,
while the number of higher education students has
increased by a factor of 14.

Data concerning private education is generally sparse,
incomplete and not always coherent. It is estimated that
the private sector accounts for about 20% of total
spending on education and is generally on the rise.
This proportion, however, can vary widely between
countries and often within a single country depending
upon the level of education.
