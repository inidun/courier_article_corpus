In the former Yugoslavia, the destruction of cultural heritage erased a common identity in cities
and fulfilled an archaic dream in the countryside
t h at generals and politicians are being prose-
cuted by the Intern ational Criminal Tri bunal for
the former Yu g o s l av i a .
Other terms emerged during these wa rs :
“ u r b i c i d e ” to describe the bombing of cities
such as Mostar and Sarajevo in Bosnia and
H e r z e g ov i n a ,and “cultural cleansing” or “ c u l-
tural genocide” to indicate the fate of mosques,
c h u r c h e s ,m u s e u m s ,a r c h i ve s ,l i b r a ri e s ,s c h o o l s ,
and so on. I n e v i t a b l y, these terms were part of
a propaganda wa r , but all too often, t h e y
r e flected the new landscapes of Croat i a ,B o s n i a
and Herzegov i n a ,and more recently,of Kosovo.
The deliberate destruction in wa rtime of
cultural heritage is no historical nove l t y.S o m e-
times destruction has been an affair of pillagi n g

In 1991, in the early days of the Cold
Wa r ’s end, We s t e rn Europeans we r e
shaken by television images of a dow n p o u r
of explosives falling upon the sleepy little
Danube town of Vu k ova r , and plumes of
s m o k e snaking their way over Dubrov n i k ,“ t h e
j e wel of the A d ri at i c ” and a World Heri t a g e
s i t e . From 1991 to 1999, c o u n t ries of the
f o rmer Yu g o s l avia were subjected to wa r.W h i l e
m o d e r ate commentat o rs referred to a cam-
paign of “ethnic cleansing,” those targeted by
the violence spoke of “ g e n o c i d e .” It is precisely
on this count and for crimes against humanity
for profit , at others it has been part of the
widely recognized right to annihilate the
e n e my.D u ring World War I,churches and old
t own centres were reduced to rubble out of
m i l i t a ry necessity.D u ring World War II, l a r g e
G e rman urban centres disappeared as part
of strat e gic “area bombing” by Common-
wealth airforces.
But there are other reasons.The phy s i c a l
genocide of Europe’s Jews by the Nazis wa s
accompanied by a cultural genocide—the des-
t ruction of synagogues, c e m e t e ries and other
landmarks and treasures.
In the case of the former Yu g o s l av i a , t h e
h e ritage sites destroyed for purely military rea-
sons were few and far betwe e n . H i s t o ry

reminds us that sacral buildings have been
d e s t r oyed time and time again in the Balkans.
The longstanding belief that the Ottoman
a rm i e s , in the 15th century, were gentle with
C h ristian heritage might well be a my t h .L at e r ,
in the 19th century, the conquering Hapsbu r g
a rmies and Catholic administrat o rs in Croat i a
t u rned a handful of mosques into churches and
d e s t r oyed the rest.More recently,d u ring Wo r l d
War II, m a s s i ve destruction of Serbian
O rt h o d ox churches was carried out in Croat i a
and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the fa s-
cist Ustasha forces. Ruins in Eastern Slavo n i a
and Krajina,prominently Serb areas of Croat i a ,
stand as tangible reminders of this peri o d .
But the more recent events are of a sin-
gularly different nat u r e .We are not referring to
foreign powe rs invading a terri t o ry and swe e-
ping aside eve rything in their wa k e .We are in
the presence of old societies which were to
some extent integr at e d , but in the process of
breaking up.The Serbian inhabitants of Croa-
tian Krajina were not newcomers to the regi o n
in 1991. C r o at s , Muslims and Serbs have
l i ved together in Bosnia and Herzegov i n a
since the 16th century.And more recently, i n
the 20th century,m i xed marriages in cities and
t owns played a significant role in we aving the
social fa b ri c. In the country s i d e ,where people
often settled by ethnic belongi n g, the situat i o n
was different. A c c o r d i n g l y, d u ring the wa r ,
when Muslims, C r o at s , Serbs or Kosova r
Albanians were chased out of their villages
while their mosques and churches were mined
or bu rn e d , it was the “other”—“the forei-
gner”—who was being removed from the
r e gi o n .The public dream of the nat i o n a l i s t s
(and sometimes the unavowed secret dream of
the villagers) was thus fulfil l e d : to be finally at
p e a c e , alone among our own people. T h e
mythical pure rural world was creat e d .
In the cities and towns of Bosnia and Her-
z e g ov i n a , d e s t ruction had a different signifi-
c a n c e . It was common to hear in Sarajevo
and Mostar that synagogues, C h ri s t i a n
churches and mosques are only 100 metres
from each other.This may not in fact be tru e ,
but in people’s minds, it wa s.The cities enjoye d
gr e at religious foundations and were home
to the finest Ottoman sacral heri t a g e .A sense
of integr ation had developed through a
common attachment to places and shared
s p a c e s.The coexistence of religious traditions
p r ovided people with a common sense of
ow n e rship of sacral heri t a g e .S e r b s ,M u s l i m s
and Croats also took equal pride in their
secular bu i l d i n g s , such as the Sarajevo Nat i o n a l
and Unive rsity Library.
“Ethnicized” herita g e
All this was profoundly changed by wa r.
Although we perceive destruction as barbari c,
it is seen as an act of creation in the eyes of its
p e rp e t r at o rs. In the countryside of Croat i a
and Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , it was the crea-
tion—or the liberation—of a mythical ru r a l
s o c i e t y, with the symbols of the unwa n t e d
other—his minarets or church steeples—eli-
m i n ated from the hori z o n .But in the cities of
Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , a common civic
identity was destroye d , and along with it, t h e
“ o t h e r ” inside the people. Secular and sacral
h e ritage became ethnicized: before the wa r ,
nobody in Mostar would have said that the Old
B ridge was a “ M u s l i m ” m o n u m e n t . Its des-
t ruction by Croat tanks turned it into one. I n
Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , the impove ri s h m e n t
of the post-war cities is appalling, not simply
because they are largely emptied of another
ethnic group or of gr e at sacral bu i l d i n g s.T h e
s u rviving bu i l d i n g s , e ven intact, are simply
ghosts from another age: the “ o t h e r ” has been
e l i m i n ated at all leve l s , inside people and out-
side on the streets.
In this context, the restoration and rebu i l-
ding of cultural heritage can take on political
and dow n right divisive dimensions: it is no
longer a question of rebuilding what was held
in common, but only “ w h at was ours.” T h e
technical problems of reconstruction are infi-
nitely less important than the “ d e - e t h n i c i z a-
t i o n ” of heri t a g e , and it is difficult to imagi n e
h ow the Balkan societies will be able to ove r-
come this problem.The only hope of restori n g
a once commonly held landscape lies in a
commitment to do so by the ethnic or nat i o n a l
group that carried out the cri m e s. ■
