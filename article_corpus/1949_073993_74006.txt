'REPORT TO U. N.'
GGREPORT to the United Nations", a comprehensive accountof Unesco's activities and development during 1948 together
with details of the Organization's programme of work for 1949.
as approved by the General Conference last December, has just
been published for submission to th : United Nations.
In an introduction to the Report, Dr. Torres Bodet, points out
that it lays stress on Unesco's work for the re-establishment of
international contacts in the fields of education, science and
cultur*.
IN conclusion, he writes,"This is what I personally regard asUnesco's ultimate aim : through education, science and
culture to bring about true fellowship between all peoples of the
world and betwen all men in each eountry.
"Unesco is thus faced with two equally important obligations :
to make each culture understand that it enriches itself by
borrowing from others and repaying them with interest from its
own finest and rarest creations ; and to bridg the wide gulf
betwecn intellectuals and the masses so that a bond of brother-
hood may draw them together for the l : enefit for aU."
The Report and its 15 annexes cover every aspect of the
Organization's work during the past year. financial and adminis-
trative facts, information about Unesco's relations with other
organizations and details of its 1949 programme. The 176 page
report, which constitutes a valuable reference book, will b*
examined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council
at its summer session.
