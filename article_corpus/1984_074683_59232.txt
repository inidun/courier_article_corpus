Four centuries of growth
THE period from the twelfth to the
sixteenth century was a key period
in the historical evolution of Africa.
These four centuries saw the rise and
development in Africa of brilliant civiliza¬
tions. In the north and on the eastern
coasts of the continent, under the banner
of Islam, merchant cities sprang up which
made of Africa one of the major cross¬
roads of world trade. Huge caravans
crossed the Sahara linking the north with
the Sudan, the "Land of the Black
Peoples", and with the gold mines of
Ghana and Mali.
Commerce was at its most intense and
trade in goods of all kinds linked the
various regions of the continent. Ar¬
chaeology has today revealed that even
the equatorial forests were not an im¬
penetrable barrier to the circulation of
men, ideas, techniques, goods and food¬
stuffs.
Historians and researchers have long
attributed to Islam the birth and develop¬
ment of the continent's cities, kingdoms
and empires. But far from the Islamic zone
of influence, on the Atlantic coast and in
southern Africa, kingdoms and cities
arose that were just as advanced and well
organized as those of the Sudanese
region. Among them were the brilliant
by Djibril Tamsir Mane and splendour
civilizations of Ife and Benin which reach¬
ed their apogee from the twelfth to the
fourteenth century and whose statuary art
constituted a heritage of striking originali¬
ty. Thanks to archaeology, the civilization
of Zimbabwe, the ancient empire of
Monomotapa, is also gradually yielding
up its secrets. Today we know that perma¬
nent contacts between west Africa and
the Maghreb, Zimbabwe and the east
coast were maintained by pilgrims, travell¬
ing traders and commercial interchange.
Our knowledge of this important period in
African history is based on written
documents, oral tradition and, more and
more, the findings of archaeological
research.
On pages 5 to 11 we present extracts from
two chapters of Volume IV, Africa from
the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century, of
Unesco 's General History of Africa, as well
as a glimpse of a third chapter which ex¬
amines the role of Africa in the intercon¬
tinental exchanges of the period. Professor
D. T. Mane is the general editor of volume
IV, the English edition of which is to be
published later this year in ajoint co-edition
between Unesco and Heinemann, London,
and University of California Press. (See in¬
side back cover).
