Reaping the wind
Don Quixote would have
been dumbfounded by
this modern version of
the windmill with its
rotor 17 metres in dia¬
meter. As well as provi¬
ding energy directly for
grinding and threshing
grain, cutting wood and
pumping water, wind¬
mills are now being stu¬
died as a means of gene¬
rating electricity in areas
isolated from power
grids. This experimental
model, built at the U.S.
Energy Research and
Development Adminis¬
tration's laboratories in
New Mexico, can pro¬
duce 60 kilowatts in a 45-
kilometre-per-hour wind.
