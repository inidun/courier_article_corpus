HERITAGE
AHIPOUNAMU
by Ann-Marie Johnson
Extraordinary flora and fauna flourish in Southwest New Zealand, one of the
world's most spectacular wilderness areas, which was placed on the World
Heritage List in 1990.
The Fox glacier, on
the western slopes of
the Southern Alps.
Maori people see more than
I a mountain when they look
at the snow-covered heights of
New Zealand's highest peak.
Members of the Ngai Tahu tribe
see their ancestor, Aoraki, first
born son of Raid, the Sky Parent.
In mythical times, Aoraki was
shipwrecked after his canoe over¬
turned as he sailed in the South
Pacific. Trying to save themselves,
he and bis crew clambered to the
high side of the hull . . . and
remained there for eternity.
Today, the canoe forms the South
Island of New Zealand, while
Aoraki and his crew, still clinging
to the hull, have become the great
mountain chain known as the
Southern Alps.
In due course, Aoraki's son,
Tuterakiwhanoa, came searching
for his father. Finding the remains
of the shipwreck had turned to
stone, he began to reshape it into
a suitable home for his human
descendants. Other atua (demi¬
gods) with skills in landscaping,
fisheries, birds and horticulture
helped him, creating the South
Island eventually inhabited by the
Ngai Tahu.
The results of their ancestors'
labours can be seen today in one of
the world's most spectacular and
pristine wilderness areas, south¬
west New Zealand, known in
Maori as Te Wahipounamu. Since
the atua created this vast region,
man has had virtually no impact on
it. In fact, no humans at all lived
there until about 1,000 years ago.
For millennia, the only sounds to
be beard were the rustling of
leaves, the rushing water of moun¬
tain streams and birdsong echo¬
ing through the densely luxuriant
dark-green bush. In the absence
of predatory mammals, plants did
not need to develop defence mech¬
anisms, some birds lost the power
to fly and did not develop the
bright plumage seen in the birds
of more dangerous countries.
Unique species evolved, their
development hindered only by the
effects of the climate.
THE PLACE OFTHE GREENSTONE
When the Maori arrived, they
found a land rich in resources they
could use to sustain their exis¬
tence and around which they
could build their culture. Abun¬
dant birds and fish provided food,
the bush gave them timber. But
the most valuable prize was hewn
from the rock of Aoraki's mythical
canoe and was reflected in the
name the Maori gave the region:
Te Wahipounamu, or the place of
the greenstone.
Creenstone (nephrite) was the
most precious of all stone to the
Maori. It was used for tools,
weapons and ornaments, and in
some forms is believed to hav e spir-
itual force. It was certainly the
most important item the Ngai

In 1642 the Dutch navigator
Abel Tasman became the first
European to sight Te Wahi¬
pounamu, but no one landed there
until the arrival of the English
explorer James Cook in 1773. He
and his crew spent six weeks in
Dusky Sound, clearing a small
part of the native forest to make
way for an astronomical observa¬
tory. The tree stumps left behind
can still be seen today.
But the first real effects of
<wm
European settlement were not felt
until more than twenty years later,
after sealers began to harvest the
fur seals found along the coast.
By 1820 the seal population had
been almost wiped out. Fortu¬
nately they were given legal pro¬
tection in 1ÎÎ75, and the popula¬
tion has since recovered to the
point where there are now thou¬
sands spread along the coastline.
Europeans were also largely
responsible for perhaps the most
devastating impact on the wilder¬
ness of Te Wahipounamu. The
introduction of browsing and
predatory mammals such as red
deer, the Australian brush-tailed
possum, rabbits and rodents
wrought havoc in an ecosystem ill-
equipped to defend itself against
such creatures. Several bird
species have become extinct,
while others are among the world's
most endangered. Some palatable
plants were eliminated from
accessible areas and severe dam¬
age occurred in many ¡daces.
But the untrained eye does not
notice such things. Te Wahi-
pounamu's remoteness and isola¬
tion have saved it from the worst
encroachments of human civiliza¬
tion, and there are still areas where

human beings have never set foot.
The first major land-based explo¬
rations were carried out in the sec¬
ond half of the nineteenth century,
but a number of the remote valleys
were still considered to be unex¬
plored as late as the 1970s.
ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS
Today experienced trampers can
find huge expanses which offer
neither tracks nor huts nor any
other sign of human inhabitation,
giving them the opportunity to
i*evel in the rare and sometimes
frightening sense of complete soli¬
tude. With no roads, houses, traf¬
fic or noise, walkers easily find
themselves overwhelmed by their
insignificance in the midst of the
magnificent mountain and forest
scenery that surrounds them.
They are left to depend on their
own resources in the knowledge
that they are hours away from
outside help.
But less hardy or more gre¬
garious visitors can enjoy Te
Wahipounamu's wonders in a little

more comfort. The world-famous
Milford Track offers guided or
independent walks of two to five
days through spectacular scenery,
as do several other less well-known
trails, such as the Routeburn,
Greenstone or Ilolyford tracks.
Numerous shorter walks, ranging
from thirty minutes to a full day,
are spread along the length of Te
Wahipounamu, giving safe and
easy access to the wilderness. Sev¬
eral of these walks have been
equipped with informative dis¬
plays to help explorers under¬
stand the surroundinglandforms,
wildlife or vegetation.
But such displays cannot tell
all there is to know about Te
Wahipounamu. The region's 2.6
million hectares are breathtaking
in the extent and variety of their
natural beauty. Forming fully a
tenth of New Zealand's entire
landmass, the area is united only
by its diversity. Changes in vege¬
tation and scenery which span
thousands of kilometres on the
continents are compressed into an
area only about 450 km long and
between 40 to 90 km wide.
The area contains New
Zealand's highest mountains,
longest glaciers, tallest forests,
wildest rivers and gorges, most
rugged coastline, deepest fjords
and lakes, and largest populations
of forest birds. It is home to the
world's largest buttercup, the Alt.
Cook Buttercup; possibly the
highest sea cliff, Mitre Peak; the
world's only alpine parrot, the
friendly but mischievous kea; and
the total wild population of the
rare takahe.
There are dozens ofbird species
in Te Wahipounamu, including
many found only in New Zealand.
Among the best known is the kea,
which shows no fear of intruders,
and in fact often seems to actively
seek contact with humans often
to their discomfort. Willi its strong
hooked beak, this inquisitive bird
can destroy sneakers left outside
overnight, canvas or vinyl bags and
anything else it decides to take an
interest in.
New Zealand's smallest bird,
the rifleman, lives in the region's
mountain forests, and the tiny
rock wren can be spotted in alpine
areas. One of New Zealand's few
alpine birds, the rock wren sur¬
vives the harsh mountain winters
by sheltering in openings within
the rock debris beneath the snow.
Further down the mountains, the
beautifully echoing song of the
aptly named bellbird, or kori-
mako, is commonly heard, and
careful observers can also see the
tui,bush robin, flocks of screech-'
ing kaka (forest parrot) and
kakariki (parakeet). Tawaki or
Fjordland crested penguins
inhabit parts of the coastline,
while about 50 pairs of the beau¬
tiful kotuku (white heron) regu¬
larly nest at the northern end of
the region. Although common in
other countries, the kotuku is
rare in New Zealand and has great
spiritual significance for the
Maori, who see it as a symbol of all
that is beautiful and rare.
SURVIVORS FROM A LOST CONTINENT
Scientists tell us that Te Wahi¬
pounamu is the best modern rep¬
resentation of the ancient flora and
fauna of Gondwanaland, the south¬
ern super-continent that broke up
to form New Zealand, South Amer¬
ica, India, Africa, Antarctica and
Australia. New Zealand broke off
80 to 100 million years ago before
the appearance of marsupials and
other mammals, and the country's
subsequent long isolation enabled
ancient life forms to survive to a
far greater extent than elsewhere.
The great forests of rimu, southern
beech and kahikatea are the clos¬
est links with Gondwanaland, as
are unique birds like the flightless
kiwi, which New Zealanders have
adopted as their national symbol.

gigantic ¡liâtes making up the
earth's crust. This is one of only
three places in the world where
a major tectonic plate boundary
can be found on land. Earth¬
quakes caused by the collision of
these two plates have helped New
Zealand gain its reputation as the
"Shaky isles", but the fault line
has also given rise to a dramatic
landscape of deep fjords and high
mountains.
The glaciers of Te Wahi¬
pounamu are also evidence of the
movements under the earth's sur¬
face. These glaciers, particularly
those named Fox and Franz-Josef,
were among New Zealand's first
tourist attractions for those
wealthy enough to undertake the
arduous trip into the wilderness.
But the movement of the glaciers ¡
is so rapid that visitors a century g
ago saw a different sight to those ü
we see today as both glaciers are |
2 to 3 km shorter than when they g
were first surveyed in the 1890s.
Fox Glacier is 13 km long, while
Franz-Josef is 10 km, and both
flow very quickly, averaging as
much as 1.5 metres a day,
although rates of up to 8 in a day
have been recorded. Nearby, the
28 km Tasman Glacier, which
flows from Alt. Cook (Aoraki), is
one of the longest glaciers in the
southern hemisphere.
The glaciers are very sensitive
to climatic changes, advancing
during periods of heavy snowfalls
and receding under less severe

weather conditions. However, Te
Wahipounamu's weather is rarely
extreme, even though the region
lies across one of the world's
windiest latitudes, the Roaring
Forties. The large amounts of
ocean surrounding New Zealand
moderate temperatures, so the
climate is temperate and avoids
major seasonal changes. The
Southern Alps form a barrier to
the prevailing moisture-laden
westerly winds coming off the Tas¬
man Sea, with the result that the
West Coast is subject to heavy and
sometimes violent rainstorms at
any time of the year. The coastal
lowlands receive 3,000 to 5,000
mm of rain a year and this level
rises with the terrain, so that the
western flank of the Southern
Alps can receive more than
10,000 mm a year, although
much of it falls as snow.
Today, the Ngai Tahu are not
the only people who have reason to
be grateful that Aoraki was ship¬
wrecked in an isolated part of the
South Pacific. Visitors from
around the world, as well as New
Zealaudcrs themselves, are increas¬
ingly discovering the magnificenc e
of this untouched ¡tart of the
world. Even in this age of easy
travel, Te Wahipounamu's remote¬
ness means that tourist operators
and administrators have had time
to benefit from the lessons learned
from the effects of uncontrolled
tourist development elsewhere.
Although recreational use of the
region is generally encouraged,
the activities that are available,
such as boating, fishing, hunting
and mountaineering, have little
impact on the environment.
Growing awareness of the
importance of conserving the
world's few remaining areas of
untouched wilderness ensures
that Te Wahipounamu will con¬
tinue to be preserved as far as pos¬
sible in its pristine state. If Tuter-
akiwhonoa ever returns to survey
his handiwork, he will not find Te
Wahipounamu very different from
the way he left it. I
