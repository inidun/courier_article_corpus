Bonjour Québec
For two centuries after the Treaty of
Paris (1763) which brought to an end
Anglo-French contention for the pos¬
session of New France, English was the
language of business and economic
power in Quebec. The language clash
that this situation gave rise to bore
witness to the struggle of a people
against assimilation. Cut off from its
French roots, the language of Quebec
was obliged to evolve outside the
mainstream of the French language
and to affirm its own specificity.
The industrial expansion of the
beginning of the twentieth century
threatened to result in the "angliciza-
tion"of the lower-paid workers, and in
1902, the Association for the Use of
French in Canada was established
whose aim was to encourage the study,
improvement and protection of Cana¬
dian French. Nevertheless, up to 1960,
the language question seems to have
been limited to literary squabbles and
nationalistic rhetoric.
The popular spoken language,
Joual, has given rise to a great deal of
controversy. No one seems able to
agree on a precise definition of Joual;
does it include the entire vocabulary of
Quebec French, or does it cover only a
Montreal dialect full of anglicisms? Is
it a new language, a patois, or simply a
certain level of a language? Each
linguist and commentator adopts a dif¬
ferent viewpoint and the debate
widens, since the linguistic question is
only one aspect of a wider social
problem.
From the linguistic point of view, the
peculiarities of Quebec French are not
a matter of vocabulary, syntax or mor¬
phology, but rather of phonetics.
Apart from a certain number of
anglicisms, which vary from region to
region, the vocabulary is marked chief¬
ly by the use of archaic words or expres¬
sions that can still be traced back to cer¬
tain regions of France. To these must
be added words that had to be invented
to describe the realities of a new land:
bancs de neige (snow banks), poudrerie
(blizzard), érablière (maple grove),
orignal (moose). The syntax borrows
some English or American construc¬
tions, yet without straying from the
French sentence form. Crammed with
abbreviations, the morphology is often
elliptic and at times abrupt,
syncopated.
The Quebec accent, however, like
the accents of Marseille or Belgium, is
immediately recognizable. It is a matter
of a tone and a rhythm which, com¬
bined with nasalization, diphthongiza-
tion and the displacement of the tonic
accent, demand a certain period of
adaptation for an untutored ear. Once
the listener has become accustomed to
these peculiarities, he soon realizes that
Quebec speech is neither a dialect nor a
patois; even less is it an autonomous
language distinct from French.
Joual has had a striking impact in the
literary field. The people of Quebec
have long been asking themselves
whether they have a literature that can
be considered distinct from French li¬
terature. Their writers have wavered
between universalism (respect for the
beauty of mainstream French) and
regionalism (giving rein to exoticism
and the picturesque). They were aware
of the gap that existed between the writ¬
ten and the spoken language in Quebec.
This debate was necessary to clarify
the issues about a language under
pressure. The people of Quebec can
now set about trying to define a French
language which is specifically North
American; not a new but a different
language which is developing within
the environment in which it is
employed.
Language, which is a form of cul¬
tural and political expression, remains
a matter of discussion. The number of
dictionaries and indexes which attempt
to capture its specificity, the multiplici¬
ty of opinions, the inquiries aimed at
establishing a better assessment of its
representativeness are all evidence of a
permanent, continuing questioning.
Two important Commissions were
set up: the Royal Commission on Bil-
ingualism and Biculturalism
(1963-1970), which resuUed in the
recognition of the equality of English
and French regarding their use in all

Federal offices and institutions
throughout Canada, and a Commis¬
sion of Inquiry, on the status of the
French language and language rights in
Quebec, whose multidisciplinary
studies have opened up new horizons.
Established in 1 961 , the Office of the
French Language is responsible for
watching over the enrichment and cor¬
rect use of the spoken and written
language and acts as an arbiter on the
usage of technical terminology. The
purpose of the Charter of the French
Language, which was adopted in 1977
and was the outcome of a lengthy
period of discussion, is to guarantee the
French-speaking people of Quebec cer¬
tain fundamental language rights and
to make French the normal and
customary language of work, com¬
munications, trade and commerce,
both of the administration and the
business world.
