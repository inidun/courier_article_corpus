Gaudi's
phantasmagoria
in stone
The best-known work of the celebrated Catalonian
architect Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926) is undoubtedly
the cathedral of the Sagrada Familia (Holy Family)
in Barcelona. The conception and construction of
this extravagant building (which was never
completed) show Gaudi at the height of his
creative powers. In 1891, he took over the project
from another architect who had built the crypt,
and worked on It for the rest of his life. Photo 2

Initially inspired by neo-Gothic and Arabic models,
Gaudi soon left behind all consideration of the
past, and began to cover the cathedral's façade of
the Nativity (photo 3) with a riot of complex forms
from Nature. The stone seems to flow In curves
like lava, solidified in a wild profusion of plant and
animal motifs, stalactites and stalagmites, clouds,
stars and constellations. Photo 1 shows in close-
up a detail of what Gaudi called his "Milky Way
coagulations". But the architect also moved away
from the use of natural imagery for its own sake
to a conception of architecture in which there is
often a logical structural reason behind the
apparently capricious forms. The many sculptures
adorning the cathedral illustrate a tireless quest
for realism. All the New Testament figures were
portrayed from life. Gaudi used his workmen and
their families as models, and the church became
known as "the cathedral of the poor". In photo 5,
