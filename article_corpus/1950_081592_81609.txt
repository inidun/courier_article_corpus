AN international agreement which will allow a wide rangeof educational. scientific and cultural materials to move
across frontiers free of duty will be opened for signature
on the 22nd of November, at United Nations headquarters. Lake
Success, New York. The text of the Agreement was adopted
unanimously at the last General Conference of Unesco, at
Florence.
All Member States of Unesco and of the United Nations may
adhere to the"Agreement on the Importation of Educational.
Scientific and Cultural Materials."as the new pact is called.
It will come into force following ratification by ten countries.
Sponsoring the Agreement, the Unesco General Conference
urged Member States to sign and ratify it and to implement
its provisions in the most liberal manner. The United Nations
Economic and Social Council has also drawn the attention of
Member States to the"practical importance"of the agreement.
countries, books continued
to enjoy immunity from
tariffs affecting most other
classes of goods. The tariff
rates introduced by France in
1892, for example, gave com-
plete exemption to books re-
gardless of origin. By 1906
Austria-Hungary, Germany,
Japan and many smaller
countries had followed the
French lead. Italy, Russia,
Spain and the United States
allowed books in foreign
languages to enter freely but
imposed a duty on imported
books printed in the native
language.
WARS RAISE BARRIERS
THE outbreak of war in 1914brought this comparatively
happy period to a close.
During World War I itself,
tariffs rose generally and new
restrictive measures were de-
vised to meet the emergency.
Of these, the most notable was
the licensing system, which
enabled governments to exer-
cise an unprecedented degree
of control over foreign trade.
Since the aim was to restrict
trade in goods considered non-
essential to the war effort,
many articles of educational
value suffered.
By the end of World War I,
the whole structure of pre-war
trade had been shattered. The
economic depression of the
1930's led to a host of restric-
tions more rigid and extensive
than those adopted after 1914.
The division of the world into
currency blocs and the intro-
duction of quota systems plac-
ed an even greater check on
world trade. Informational
materials suffered particularly,
though films enjoyed some re-
lief under the"Convention to
Facilitate the International
Circulation of Films of an
Educational Character", which
"ESSEMDAL GOODS"ONLY !
THE vast devastation causedby the rec nt war and the
external indebtedness of
many countries struck a final
blow at the multilateral trading
system. Informational mate-
rials, which had never been
more greatly needed, suffered
as much, or more, than other
commodities, since internatio-
nal trade was still largely
confined to the exchange of
"essential goods"and nearly
all countries were faced by
extremely complex payments
difficulties.
Despite the growth of
restrictions generally, many
countries were
disposed to pro-
vide special fa-
cilities for trade
in instruments
of knowledge. It
was necessary,
however, for an
inter-govern-
mental agency
to draw atten-
tion to the pro-
blem as a whole,
to stimul-
ate governments
into concrete
action and to
provide a frame-
work within
w h i c h remedial measures
might be effected.
Unesco's first undertaking
was to sponsor a new agree-
ment to replace the League of
Nations Convention on educa-
tional films, already mention-
ed, which had lapsed during
the war. The draft of a con-
vention, broadened to include
many other audio-visual ma-
terials, was approved by the
Unesco General Conference In
November, 1948. Known as the
"Agreement to Facilitate the
International Circulation of
fied by three (Norway, Pa-
kistan, Yugoslavia). Ratifica-
tion by ten countries is needed
to bring it into force.
When the Unesco General
Conference met at Beirut
in November, 1948, it instruct-
ed the Director-General to
prepare the draft of a second
international agreement, de-
signed to faciiitate the inter-
national circulation of public-
ations. A draft was drawn up
and the Director-General took
the opportunity to submit it
for consideration by the Con-
tracting Parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (G. A. T. T.), which met
at Annecy, France, in April
1949. Thirty-four nations, in-

the Second World War.
a l rge oblong crat
turned up at the Customs
warehouse of a busy port.
The Customs inspector, upon
opening the crate, discovered
that its contents consisted of a
smooth and graceful piece of
solid brass, shaped rather like
a banana standing on its end.
The inspector was completely
at a loss as to how he should
classify the object. Finally, he
arrived at a decision : the
object was"block matter"-
and duty was charged accord-
ing to the relatively high rate
for imported raw material.
But the importer challenged
the inspector's decision. The
"raw material"turned out to
be the abstract sculpture"Bird
in Flight buy the noted Ru-
manian sculptor, Brancusi,
and, in the opinion of art
critics, one of his finest works.
After much delay and ar-
gument, the inspector's ruling
was reversed by the courts and
the piece of sculpture was
allowed to enter duty-free.
The inspector's view that the
Brancusi was just a piece of
brass, is not as extraordinary
as it might seem. It is reject-
ed in the tariff regulations of
many countries which tend to
regard not only works of art
but other educational, scientific
and cultural materials as or-
dhlary commodities, subject to
the same restrictions which
are imposed on commercial
imports.
This tendency has for
many years seriously hinder-
ed the international circula-
tion of educational, scientific
and cultural materials. Some
countries tax imported films
by the foot and sculpture by
the pound. Duties on books
range as high as 300 per cent.
Scientific equipment, needed in
research laboratories, is taxed
with equal severity. Exhibi-
tions and collections, destined
for schools or art galleries,
languish in customs ware-
houses while their sponsors try
to raise the heavy bond often
required by the authorities.
HISTORY OF RESTRICTIONS
MOST of the tariff, quotaand currency restric-
tions on the movement
of informational materials
are of fairly recent origin. In
many cases, moreover, they
have been extended to instru-
ments of knowledge as part of
a general trend toward control
which engulfed these materials,
along with oth√®r"commodi-
ties", fortuitously rather than
by design.
During the earlier part of
the period between 1850 and
today, informational materials
benefited by the general mo-
vement in favour of
free trade. The Indu-
strial Revolution and
the absence of major
wars led to a general
demand for tariff re-
form, which in Europe
led to the conclusion
of a number of com-
mercial treaties inspir-
ed by liberal princi-
ples. Thus, in 1860,
the United Kingdom
concluded with France
a commercial treaty
providing for free
trade in books.
Though the next 20
years witnessed a re-
turn to protectionist
practice in various

League of Nations in 1933. The
24 signatory States to this
convention had agreed to
exempt educational films from
import duties and gran them
the same tax privileges as
might be enjoyed by locally-
produced ones. But in the
troubled years preceding World
War II, political preoccupa-
tions diverted attention from
the damage done to education,
science and culture generally
by tariffs, quotas and exchange
controls.

ting.
The conference set up a
seven-nation working party,
under the chairmanship of
Belgium, to consider the Unes-
co Agreement. The working
party concluded that Unesco's
general objective to remove
trade restrictions on instru-
ments of knowledge would best
be furthered through a broad
international agreement to
facilitate the international cir-
culation, not only of publics-
tions, but of a wide variety out
educational, scientific and cul-
tural materials. The working
party then proceeded to draft
such an agreement and the
G. A. T. T. conference, after
approving the text, recom-
mended the convention to
Unesco for sponsorship.
RECENT UNESCO ACTION
THE General Conference ofJt Un sco, t its 4th sessi n
in September, 1949, ins-
tructed the Director-General
to circulate this text to GoV-
ernments and to convene a
meeting of experts to revise it
in the light of comment re-
ceived. Delegates from 25
Member States met in Geneva
for two weeks in March 1950
and reached agreement on a
revised text. The Agreement
on the Importation of Educa-
tional, Scientific and Cultural
Materials, as it was now called,
was submitted to the General
Conference, at its 5th Session
in Florence, and, with a num-
ber of further revisions, was
adopted unanimously. Its
terms are described in an
accompanying article.
The General Conference
urged Member States to sign
and ratify it and to implement
its terms in the most liberal
manner. In a statement to
the Conference, the Director-
General declared that the
entry into force of the Unesco
Agreement would represent a
substantial contribution, in the
technical field, to mutual un-
derstanding and peace.
