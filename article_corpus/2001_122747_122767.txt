A local train named desire
The railroad that chugs across Austria’s Semmering pass is on the UNESCO World Heritage list. More
than a technological achievement, this local train evokes memories of a vanished, melancholy world
t ’s not a good idea to visit the Semmering
pass if you’re sad, unless you’re feeling
really blue. And if you do make the
j o u r n e y, take the old S e m m e r i n g b a h n
r a i l r o a d , which will offer much more
than a winding trip through the moun-
tains:a list of sentimental or legendary
names will send chills up and down your
s p i n e. Höllental (Hell Va l l e y ) , B ä r e n-
sattel (Bear Saddle), Eselstein (Donkey
R o c k ) , Adlitzgräben (Adlitz Graves),
Kalte Rinne (Cold Furrow). I ’ve always
preferred to cross the Semmering on
this local train rather than on the com-
fortable express.
Once, I looked at the scenery strad-
dling my motorcy c l e.The Höllental valley
was cold and wet,the curves on the way
to the pass scattered with sandy furrows.
But even back then, I was too melan-
cholic to admire the beautiful,strangely
anachronistic scenery. What, lurking in
the verdant forests, makes you cry and
puts joy back in your heart? Perhaps I
always chose the wrong time of year for
a trip to the Semmering. When the fog
brushes up against the rocks with its
shreds of unhappiness and slips into the
green meadows, when the gardens shoot
past the train’s windows, dazzling with a
thousand colours, there is just one thing
I want to do: shine one last time and
learn to die with beauty,before the dead
season comes.This mountain and scenery
fill me with such sadness! Old memories
come flooding back. Not mine, but those
that others have told me, which they in
turn had heard somewhere. Even so, t h e y
stir something in me. And I always con-
jugate the Semmering in the past tense,
like the beginning of a fairy tale:“Once
upon a time…”
Once upon a time, t h e n , a land on
the eve of a revolution had an emperor
who decided to conquer a mountain.In
so doing, he resorted to a modern
strategy whose purpose was to take
people’s minds off the problems of the
day. Confronted with the revolution of
1 8 4 8 , he decided to send construction
workers to the area straddling Lower
Austria and Styria and keep them busy
on a bold project. The clever emperor
killed two birds with one stone. Part of
the impoverished, desperate revolu-
tionary proletariat found itself far from
Vienna, forced to do hard construction
work.And the government took all the

that looked as though they might col-
lapse beneath the weight of ornate Art

rose with the same arrogance as their
counterparts on the Ringstraße,Vi e n n a ’s
most fashionable thoroughfare. Th e y

wealthiest people and most famous
celebrities.
Silhouettes of
a vanished world
N o b l e s, b a n k e r s, i n d u s t r i a l i s t s,
p a i n t e r s, writers and philosophers felt
an irresistible attraction to Semmering.
E l e g a n c e, luxury and beauty, m i n g l i n g
with a good dose of decadence and nar-
c i s s i s m ,gradually overran the high moun-
tain pastures. In the event of an emer-
gency, Vienna was not far away, and the
train trip was more enjoyable than trav-
elling by horse and carriage. In summer,
the area vied with the Mediterranean.
In winter, it was the meeting place for a
closed circle of regular visitors.
That world,which is as irretrievably
lost as Atlantis, was strictly off-limits to
people outside the closed circle of
fin a n c e, politics or the interloping sphere
of culture… Shh! Isn’t that the writer
Arthur Schnitzler’s ghost behind the tall
pine tree over there? Isn’t he casually
holding the manuscript of a melodrama
credit for a spectacular, c o u r a g e o u s
undertaking—in Au s t r i a , at any rate:
building a railroad that defied the moun-
t a i n s.Workers filled crevices in the rock,
built viaducts over valleys and ravines.
And the result was majestic. Today, the
almost Gothic arches, which stand out
against the sky and mountains in some
p l a c e s, seem as though they had been
built merely to beautify the scenery,
rather than to hold up the deafening roar
of tons of steel which seemed to signal
nature’s capitulation to industry.
A certain Carlo Ghega, who was born
in Venice and has gone down in archi-
tectural history and Austrian politics
under the name of “Knight Karl von
Ghega,” shepherded this adventure to a
successful conclusion. Tie after tie, r a i l
after rail, he tamed the rebellious land-
scape in heroic solitude. At least
according to the undying legend, which
even inspired an Austrian bank note (it’s
out of circulation today). On the other
h a n d , the labourers who wore themselves
out hewing the rock walls with pickaxes
and spades are seldom mentioned.Th a t ’s
how history is written.
The work was finished in 1854. A t
the time, Semmering station was the
highest point on Earth reached by a rail-
road. The passengers were just as “ele-
v a t e d .” Lavish villas and luxurious hotels
in his pale hands? And down there, on
that carpet of moss, isn’t that Sigmund
Freud,looking a bit under the weather,
lost in his thoughts? A little further away
in the undergrowth, is that a grazing deer
or the poet Peter Altenberg walking for-
ward with an energetic gait? Silhouettes
of a vanished world…. Only the trees
still remember these happy, sad or loving
figures strolling beneath the dense
canopy of foliage and needles. But for
me, their presence haunts the woods, in
the dark shadows of the rock walls.
I do not see any female silhouettes,a s
though women had never existed! Ye t
Wanda must have stayed near here. Or
perhaps she did not have enough money
to spend a summer in Semmering. She
undoubtedly would have felt comfort-
able had she been able to afford a pre-
sentable dress. And who knows, maybe
the course of her life would have changed
if she could have left her unbearable hus-
b a n d , Leopold von Sacher- M a s o c h , a t
h o m e. But those are just assumptions
and guesswork. And I’m surprised at
feeling so down again.
Those ladies who accompanied those
gentlemen to the Semmering took the
waters there and enjoyed the change of
s c e n e. They came to chat and turn on
their charm or,once their beauty wilted,
while away the boredom. All of them

sank with their century without a trace.
The only things left are faded captions on
old photographs, like “ladies of the
nobility at a charity ball in front of the
champagne kiosk in Reichenau Park,
probably on the 50th anniversary of the
Semmering railroad,in 1904.”
Why does this scenery keep me from
living with my day and age? Why does it
drive me into a state of melancholy, t h r u s t
me into a past that is so at odds with my
d e s i r e s, a kitschy, hopeless past occa-
sionally resuscitated on the fli c k e r i n g
screen of a revival movie house? Th e
emperor hunting big game; the young
empress disguised as Romy Schneider,
unless it’s the other way round; Austria
depicted as a sewing kit,filled to the brim
with aristocrats flanked by their sup-
pliers! Only a handful of zealous laun-
d r y w o m e n , upright hunters and wary-
looking poachers—against a backdrop
of mountains and meadows—answer
back.
A concrete jungle?
What awakens these old stories,
which have so little to do with me? Is it
the landscape or my passion for words?
Or the dark melancholy that the Sem-
mering makes me feel? I never see it in
the full light of day, even when the sun is
shining at its brightest. Though it is
breathtakingly beautiful,this landscape
tells me a tragic tale. No matter how
much I think about the farmers, c o a l
m i n e r s, metal-workers and small
landowners who populate it, I cannot
soften this gloomy impression. M o u n-
tain life is tough.
L e t ’s turn away from the past and
look towards the future. Hikers, moun-
t a i n - c l i m b e r s, t o u r i s t s, sports enthusiasts
and railroad buffs make up most of the
S e m m e r i n g ’s summer population. B e i n g
a railroad buff myself, I am closely fol-
lowing the debate over building a tunnel
under the Semmering—a project that
fills me with dread and mistrust. If the
tunnel does go through (it depends on
political choices),that will be end of my
magnificent,melancholic journeys.
The tunnel would let anonymous
express trains zoom through the belly of
the mountain, saving the 20 minutes that
I so thoroughly enjoy losing in the switch-
backs.The 21st century citizen that I am
could congratulate herself on such effi-
c i e n cy and progress! But I don’t .I n s t e a d
I am outraged at seeing this wild yet at
the same time civilized place usurped,
bruised and turned into a concrete jungle.
Isn’t it the fear of witnessing the disap-
pearance of these unfathomable dreams
that come over me without rhyme or
reason during each of my journeys in the
Semmering? They wander like stray cats,
wending their way through the landscape,
hiding, fearful, free and untamable like
nightmares.
I admire this area, but I wouldn’t
want to live with it.
Only visit the Semmering if you are
prepared to feel sad. Unless you are
really happy. ■
