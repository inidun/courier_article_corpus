WORKING HER WAY
THROUGH COLLEGE
Nearly half the 103,070 students enrolled in
the universities and other institutes of higher
learning of the German Federal Republic during
the past university year were obliged to do
some part-time work to help pay for their stu¬
dies. Nearly 46,000 out of 86,000 men stu¬
dents and 2,928 out of I 6,780 women students
were " working their way through college ".
Here are some moments in a typical day of
Gerda Kasslan, a 21-year-old student (also
pictured on page I 3). Gerda sits in a crowded
lecture room at University of Freiburg im
Breisgau, later joins her friends in student's
room or else cooks a meal in her bedroom.
To help pay for her studies she works in a
museum. In her " spare time ", she is glad to
relax and listen to a musician friend playing
the violin.
