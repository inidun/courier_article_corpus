The wheelbarrow
The wheelbarrow was apparently invented in south-western China in the
first century BC by a semi-legendary personage called Guo Yu.
The oldest surviving picture of a wheelbarrow dates from about 1 00 AD.
It is a frieze relief from a tomb-shrine excavated near Xuzhou (Jiangsu)
which very clearly shows a wheelbarrow with a man sitting on it. There are
several other illustrations from this period, the Han Dynasty, indicating
that wheelbarrows were increasingly commonplace.
The earliest descriptions of the construction of wheelbarrows are
couched in coy and obscure language. For the first few centuries, wheel¬
barrows were of great military importance, and specifics of their construc¬
tion were closely guarded secrets. Some carried men on seats, and others
carried supplies. They were also used to form protective movable barriers
against cavalry charges. The ingenuity of the Chinese at exploiting the
wheelbarrow was limitless, and they were even given sails, with which they
could achieve speeds over land or ice of 60 kilometres per hour.
A large variety of designs existed, some with wheels in the dead centre,
with the weight resting entirely on the axle, and others with wheels
forward. Some had tiny wheels, some had huge ones. Additional small
wheels were sometimes fitted in front to ease the passage over potholes and
other obstacles. Practically all shapes and sizes of wheelbarrow existed
and still exist in China.
