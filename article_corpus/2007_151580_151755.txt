Discoverers - Portraits of Women
by José Banaag
Marie Curie 
(1867-1934)
The first woman to receive the 
Nobel Prize in 1903, for physics, 
she and her French husband dis-
covered natural radioactivity. 
Further research led her to the 
new elements radium and polo-
nium, named after her native 
Poland. For this, she was the sole 
laureate of another Nobel, in 
1911, for chemistry.

Lise Meitner 
(1878-1968)
She entered the University of 
Vienna only in 1901 because of 
restrictions on women’s enrol-
ment. She concentrated in 
nuclear physics, collaborating for 
30 years with Nobel laureate Otto 
Hahn. Together, they developed 
uranium fission.

Gerty Cori 
(1896-1957)
This Prague-born doctor worked 
as a researcher for free while her 
husband taught pharmacology at 
the same American university. 
Their long professional partner-
ship was crowned with a Nobel 
Prize in 1947 for discovering the 
metabolism of glycogen.

Irène Joliot-Curie 
(1897-1956)
Daughter of Marie Curie, wife of a 
physicist, she and her husband 
discovered artificial radioactive 
elements for which they shared 
the Nobel Prize in 1935. She 
actively campaigned for the 
social and intellectual advance-
ment of women in France.

Barbara McClintock 
(1902-1992)
Sole recipient of the 1983 Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 
this American geneticist observed 
coloration patterns of maize ker-
nels. She found that genes are 
mobile, that they can move 
around chromosomes.

Maria Goeppert-
Mayer (1906-1972)
For love of physics, this unem-
ployed wife of a university pro-
fessor continued her research 
through the American Depres-
sion. She and two other physi-
cists made important discoveries 
on the nuclear shell structure, 
receiving the Nobel Prize in 
1963.

Grace Murray Hopper 
(1906-1992)
She was the first to use the term 
“bug” when she opened her mal-
functioning computer and found 
a moth inside. This mathemati-
cian and rear admiral of the 
United States Navy is one of the 
developers of UNIVAC, the first 
commercial computer, in the late 
1940s.

Rita Levi-Montalcini 
(1909-)
In 1936, Mussolini passed laws 
discriminating against non-Aryan 
Italians. This doctor built a secret 
laboratory in her bedroom, the 
first of several wartime hideouts. 
She shared the Nobel Prize with a 
colleague in 1986 for discovering 
growth factors essential in the 
treatment of severe burns.

Dorothy Crowfoot 
Hodgkin (1910-1994)
She devoted most of her life 
teaching chemistry in women’s 
colleges in the United Kingdom. 
Her research led her to crack the 
structures of biochemical sub-
stances, notably penicillin, vita-
min B12 and insulin. She was 
awarded an unshared Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry in 1964.

Gertrude Elion 
(1918-1999)
When her father went bankrupt 
during the American Depression, 
she got a scholarship. When labo-
ratories offered few jobs for 
women, she found an assistant-
ship without pay. She discovered 
acyclovir, an antiviral treatment 
against herpes and chicken pox, 
receiving the Nobel Prize in 
1988.

Rosalind Franklin 
(1920-1958)
Because her father frowned on 
higher education for women, an 
aunt offered to pay her dues at 
Cambridge University. This scien-
tist’s study of living cells led to 
crucial keys in the molecular 
structure of DNA. She also made 
important findings in virology.

Rosalyn Yalow 
(1921-)
Graduate schools were reluctant 
to grant fellowships to women, 
so she worked as a secretary at 
Columbia University. Her later 
career in physics culminated in 
the invention of a technique to 
measure the amount of insulin for 
which she received the 1977 
Nobel Prize.

Christiane Nüsslein-
Volhard (1942-)
Some 40,000 fruit fly families 
provided the keys to her ground-
breaking study of early embryonic 
development, useful for scien-
tists to better understand human 
development. The Nobel Founda-
tion awarded the 1995 prize to 
this German geneticist and two 
others.

Jocelyn Bell 
(1943-)
While at Cambridge Observatory 
in 1967, she and fellow astrono-
mer Anthony Hewish discovered 
pulsars - quickly rotating, 
strongly magnetised neutron 
stars which regularly emit radio 
signals. Today there are 700 
known pulsars.

Linda B. Buck 
(1947-)
She and fellow American Richard 
Axel received the 2004 Nobel 
Prize for giving a deeper under-
standing of our sense of smell. 
They catalogued odorant recep-
tors, describing the vast family 
of 1,000 genes which enable us 
to recognize some 10,000 differ-
ent smells.
