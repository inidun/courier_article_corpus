The pioneering film-maker once dubbed "the Homer of the cinema" dominated the
Ukrainian cinema for three decades

OLEXANDER Dovzhenko was one
of the giants of Ukrainian
cinema. He was born in the
town ofSosnytsia on 30 August 1894,
shortly before the invention of the
cinema. After teaching for a while at
a primary school, then studying eco¬
nomics at the Kiev Institute of Com¬
merce, he was caught up in the mael¬
strom of civil war in 1918.
Once the Soviet regime had been
established, Dovzhenko took up var¬
ious responsibilities in education and
the fine arts. In January 1920, he chose
his political camp by joining the
Borot'bisti, a Ukrainian peasant party
in favour of independence. When it
was dissolved he found himself,
almost reluctantly, a member of the
Ukrainian Communist Party.
After a spell with the People's Com¬
missariat of Foreign Affairs, which
took him to Warsaw and then Berlin,
where he took lessons from the
Expressionist painter Erich Heckel,
Dovzhenko settled in Kharkov, then
Ukraine's administrative capital, and
took up painting. He contributed illus¬
trations and cartoons to several news¬
papers, and designed film posters.
After half-heartedly toying with
the idea of a theatrical career,
Dovzhenko ended up joining the
Odessa film studios. He had earlier
decided to give himself ten years in
which to master the art of painting,
and nowassimilated cinematic tech¬
nique within a year. The next step was
to make his mark on the screen.
Dovzhenko's first film efforts in
1926 were minor works: a satirical
comedy, Vasya the Reformer, and a
burlesque short, Love's Berry. Then
he directed his first successful film, a
thriller called The Diplomatic Pouch
(1927), in which he himself played
the part of a stoker, his first and last
screen role.
A year later, Zvenyhora secured
Dovzhenko a place in the pantheon of
great directors. It is an eclectic but
spontaneously original work, a
sweeping poetic pageant that encom¬
passes ten centuries ofUkrainian his¬
tory. The linking thread of this visual
symphony in twelve cantos is the
figure of an old man who embodies
the patriarchal peasantry, and who is
attached to the values of the past and
indifferent to those of the Revolution.
The film marked the beginning of
Dovzhenko's own personal tragedy.
A deeply patriotic artist,
Dovzhenko ran up against the ideo¬
logical and aesthetic constraints of a
totalitarian regime throughout his
career. He was forced to make con¬
cessions to those in power and to
praise them in sometimes overblown
terms. He stated, for example, that
his aim in Arsenal (1929) was to
destroy nationalism and chauvinism
and glorify the working classes. The
film, which describes the workers'
uprising against the Rada (central
council) ofKiev, exaggerates the Bol¬
sheviks' achievements. Arsenal, which
bristles with didactic symbolism, is
the most expressionist work produced
by Ukrainian cinema.
That did not stop Dovzhenko
campaigning actively for the recog¬
nition of national minorities. He
championed above all the cause of
his native land. Earth (1930), made
at the watershed between two eras
and a harbinger ofgreat upheavals to
come, is a hymn to the glory ofnature
and its perpetual confrontation with
man. The shots showing the first
tractor flattening the boundary mark¬
ings in the fields and turning the peas¬
antry into a collectivist society were
much imitated in later Soviet films.
An epoch-making work that car¬
ries an extraordinarilypowerful emo¬
tional charge and produces an almost
physical effect of revelation, Earth
was violently criticized for its pan¬
theistic view of the world and its
excessive naturalism. It was also
denounced as nationalistic. Almost
thirty years later, a jury of 117 histo¬
rians meeting in Brussels in 1958 rated
Earth one ofthe twelve best films ofall
time.
Exiled in Moscow
Labelled a reactionary and banned
from lecturing at the Kiev Film Insti¬
tute, Dovzhenko was forced to stay
in Moscow and had to pay a high price
for his professional survival. His first
sound film, Ivan (1932), foreshadowed
Socialist Realism. It shows a radically
transformed Ukrainian landscape,
devastated by collectivization.
Starving peasants try to escape depor¬
tation and the effects ofan artificially
engineered famine. Those taken on
as navvies on the construction site of
the Dnieper dam project are the cen¬
tral characters of this film of great
pathos, which ambitiously tackles
such issues as the forced industrial¬
ization ofan agricultural community
and the social rehabilitation of the
peasantry through collective labour.
At a time when Russian directors were
becoming increasingly prosaic,
Dovzhenko steered the Ukrainian

cinema towards more poetic hori¬
zons.
After the genocide of 1933,
Dovzhenko was forced to endure a
twofold exile: he was robbed of both
his native land and his creative uni¬
verse. Stalin sent him off to Siberia to
shoot Aerograd (1935), a film about
the construction of a Utopian city.
The mise-en-scène of this visionary
work shows Dovzhenko at his most
inspired. It was the first time he had
set eyes on the landscape of the taiga,
and he immediately spotted its pow¬
erful aesthetic potential. Aerograd,
which describes Japanese infiltration
into eastern Siberia, delivers an eco¬
logical message. But it was soon for¬
gotten.
Stalin wanted Dovzhenko to make
a "Ukrainian Chapayev". He therefore
authorized him to return to Kiev to
direct Shchors, a historic and revolu¬
tionary epic to which he was to devote
four years ofhis life. The film paints a
moving portrait of the commander
of the first Ukrainian Soviet division
during the civil war. Shooting was
long and difficult, as Dovzhenko was
kept under close surveillance during
the purges of 1936-37: the rushes were
systematically sent to Moscow and
checked by the Kremlin. Depending
on Stalin's mood and the political sit¬
uation at a particular moment,
Dovzhenko might be forced to rejig
whole sequences, sometimes even
five or six times. Shchors, who had
actually been killed by a stray bullet,
had to be shown as the hero of a Bol¬
shevik happy end. It is true that the
war clouds were gathering.
A new form of creation
After the signing of the Russo-German
pact in September 1939, western
Ukraine was reunited with the Soviet
Ukraine. The event was the subject
of Dovzhenko's first documentary,
Liberation (1940). He made two others
during the Second World War, The
Battlefor Our Soviet Ukraine (1943),
an extremely violent indictment of
war, and the more considered and tri¬
umphant Victory in the Ukraine
(1945). Towards the end of the war
Dovzhenko wrote and secretly edited
for the Yervan studios a documentary
about Armenia, Native Land (he is
not credited as editor).
Dovzhenko had earlier planned to
make a film called Ukraine in Flames.
But the publication in 1943 ofextracts
from the script caused a scandal. He
was summoned before the Politburo
by Beria, who controlled the Soviet
Union's internal security system, and
roundly admonished by Stalin, who
accused him of being a defeatist and
party to a nationalist plot. Such treat¬
ment only made Dovzhenko all the
more determined to look beyond the
Stalinist notion of the class struggle
and criticize the education of Soviet
youth and its ignorance of history,
which he saw as the reason for the Red
Army's defeat in 1941.
Dovzhenko was dismissed from
his post as artistic director of the Kiev
studios. He then embarked on a new
career as a war correspondent, writing
some thirty articles, pamphlets and
short stories while the war was still
on. The effervescence of his literary
inspiration can be judged from stories
like The Mother, On the Barbed Wire
and Before the Battle, plays like The
Descendants of the Zaporozhe Cos¬
sacks and Life in Bloom, and his novel
The Golden Gates.
Final indignities
After the war, Dovzhenko's filming
activity was severely cut back. The
personality cult was at its height, and
priority was given to biographical
films. It was in that noisome ideolog¬
ical climate that he made his first
colour film, Michurin (1949), a biog¬
raphy of the celebrated Russian
agronomist. But Dovzhenko refused
to produce a work of pure scientific
popularization, and his final cut was
turned down by the authorities. To
save his film from destruction, he
made a second version including var¬
ious rationalist and didactic episodes,
though he did manage to retain two of
the original sequences. A hybrid work,
Michurin is above all a tribute to
nature and to solitude a fate shared
by both the film-maker and his sub¬
ject. Michurin wanted to turn the
earth into an orchard. That was also
the secret dream of Dovzhenko, an
ecologist before his time.
Dovzhenko suffered one final
humiliation. When he had almost fin¬
ished shooting the interiors of
Goodbye America (1950), he was
locked out of the studios. He had
made the mistake of choosing a sen¬
sitive subject, taken from a short story
by the American Annabel Buckart.
The central character of the story,
Anna Bedford, who works at the
American embassy in Moscow, refuses
to become a spy and ends up going
over to the Soviet camp. As always,
Dovzhenko gave a poetic dimension
to the story, one of political brain¬
washing. Once again he was dis¬
avowed : the Cold War was at its height.
Stalin's death in 1953 completely
changed Dovzhenko's life. He lectured
at the State Film Institute in Moscow,
did some more writing, and devoted

anniversar
the last three years of his life to
preparing Poem ofthe Sea. But he died
on 25 November 1956, shortly before
shooting was due to start. He left six
unfilmed screenplays, including one
of Taras Bulba, which he had always
wanted to direct. His wife and collab¬
orator Yulia Solntseva loyally con¬
tinued his work and directed Poem of
the Sea (1958), The Flaming Years
(1961) and The Enchanted Desna
(1964) from his screenplays.
Dovzhenko was not only a tow¬
ering figure ofUkrainian cinema over
almost three decades, but one of the
most pioneering directors in the his¬
tory of film. The man dubbed "the
Homer of the cinema" by the Venice
Film Festival immortalized on film
an era that was at once productive
and tragic. The price he had to pay
was that although he miraculously
survived the system he was totally
ostracized by it.
His work, with its Gogolian under¬
tones, can be seen as a long lyrical
meditation on what it means to be
Ukrainian. His formal innovations,
such as the meditative pause, the
voice-over and an editing style that
breaks free from the spatio-temporal
restrictions of the image, established
a filmic syntax that was totally new
for the period. His brand ofrealism, at
once poetic, revolutionary, romantic
and socialist in form, was always
national in content. Although his mes¬
sage was occasionally obscured by
the philosophical digressions that
accompanied his lyrical outpourings,
his poetic language inspired many
film-makers. Kinugasa, Kurosawa and
Rossellini, to name but three, owed
much to Dovzhenko.
Worshipped abroad but all too
often detested by his own people,
Dovzhenko was a true poet who
always highlighted the purest aspects
of the beautiful. His work marks the
triumph ofbeauty over truth, of inner¬
most conviction over reason. B
