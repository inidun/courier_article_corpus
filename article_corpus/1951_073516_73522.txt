FIFTY years ago, if a travellerwanted to buy a sleeping-car
ticket on a European railway,
he was told he could only ride first-
class. Since there was no market
for any cheaper tickets, there were
none on sale.
To-day, travel is coming out of
the luxury bracket. Organized
tours, family rates on railways,
summer colonies... they all have
contributed to bring travel abroad
which, after all, is the only first-
hand lesson available in internation-
al understanding, within the reach
of more and more persons.
The largest group of potential
travellers is composed of the world's
working population. To-day, in
more and more countries, holidays
with pay have become an accepted
part of the economy.
A recent survey made by M. Ar-
thur Baulot for the International
Union of Official Tourist Organiza-
tions showed that an estimated
150, 000, 000 workers throughout the
world received holidays with pay
every year.
Translated into personal terms,
this means that 150, 000, 000 workers
and their families every year ask
themselves the same question :
"Where shall we go ?"
It is not an easy question to
answer. Despite efforts made at
bringing down the cost of travel, it
is still a heavy burden for most
persons dependent upon salaries.
(In one European country alone, it is
estimated that 40 per cent of
workers enjoying holidays with pay
never leave home.)
Unesco and the International
Labour Organization (ILO) have
been working on the problem for the
past year. The result is a book,
called"WOTkers Abroad", which is
scheduled to be published this
month as a supplement to Unesco's
annually-issued handbook on inter-
national fellowships and scholar-
ships, entitled"Study Abroad".
"Stronger International
Links"
THE objective of the volume isdescribed in a foreward written
by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's
Director General, in which he
declares :
"'Workers Abroad'is issued as a
service to manual and non-manual
workers in Unesco's Member States
and to their voluntary organizations
with the aim of stimulating and
extending the various types of
educational activity designed to
break through national cultural
frontiers by bringing together people
from different countries who do the
same job".
M. Torres Bodet also pays tribute
to the pioneering efforts made by
labour organizations in showing
their members how other people live
and work. He points out that :
"Dating from the turn of the
century, the international links
between workers'organizations have
become immeasurably stronger, and
have been accompanied by increased
attention to the educational and
cultural needs of workers..."
"Workers Abroad"presents a
picture of international travel oppor-
tunities for workers from several
points of view. For the year 1951,
it lists international study tours and
group travel, international summer
schools and seminars, scholarships
available to workers, and, finally,
programmes designed to encourage
the international movement of
trainees.
Unesco's Exchange of Persons
Service, which helped compile the
pamphlet in co-operation with the
ILO, points out in"Workers Abroad"
that this first effort is not a complete
survey. It is confined mainly to
workers'travel opportunities offered
in European countries and the
United States.
It shows that 103 organizations in
thirteen countries offer workers'
scholarships of varying durations.
At the same time, seventy-two
organizations in eleven nations will
be conducting group study tours this
year.
Learning Each Others ways
TUN the book, Unesco points out thatopportunities for employment
interchange, although the most
difficult to realize, are the best way
in which workers from different
countries can learn to understand
each other. Under this system, for
example, textile workers in the
north of France and in Britain's
Midlands might visit each others'
countries and, by working beside
their opposite numbers in the other
country, learn something of their
lives.
The principal obstacles to this
form of travel, lie in administrative
complications, such as labour per-
mits, and in material problems, such
as wage differentials and payments
to dependents who remain at home.
The financial picture presented in
Workers Abroad also shows need of
improvement. In most cases of
short-term exchange, the cost of
the trip is the responsibility of the
individual worker.
There are happy exceptions. One
of these was a three-week tour of
the United States organized in 1950
by thirty-one Swedish newspapers
and Folket i Bud, a magazine, in
which the sponsoring organization
paid all expenses.
The examples of travel opportuni-
ties cited are indicative of a healthy
trend. Take the case of the study
tours organized by the Association
Touristique des Cheminots (Rail-
waymen's Tourist Association) in
Paris. This year, the association
has organized fifteen tours for rail-
waymen from France, Switzerland,
Tunisia, Luxembourg, Austria and
Finland. The tours will take them
just about anywhere from Scandi-
navia to North Africa.
In Belgium, the International Art
Weeks Federation, has worked out a
plan for ten-day tours to Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy,
the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Similar examples can be found in
Workers Abroad for all the countries
listed. The Workers Travel Asso-
ciation in London has announced
five eight-day tours of London,
including visits to factories, and to
a workers'rehabilitation centre for
Norwegian factory workers. In the
Netherlands, the Votkshogeschoot
Brabantsee at Vught has announced
a waterborne educational tour for
Belgian, German and Dutch workers.
Workers'l Entente Cordiale"
A section on international summerseh ois shows an equal variety
of opportunity. At Elsinore in
Denmark, the International People's
College is offering its traditional
low-cost courses through August
and September in such subjects
as modern languages, international
relations, and social legislations.
The Force Ouvriere, one of the
three major French trade union
federations, has organized a summer
school in England in conjunction
with the British National Council of
Labour Colleges, and, in turn, it
will run its own summer school in
France for members of Belgian trade
unions.
One chapter of the book is
devoted to an ILO survey made of
agreements now in existence to
permit the international exchange
of trainees. These agreements, some
drawn up by governments and
others by private organizations, aim
at extending the possibilities for
young workers in industry, com-
merce and agriculture to work side
by side with their fellow workers in
other countries.
Once published, Workers Abroad
will be sent without charge to some
2. 000 organizations such as trade
unions, co-operatives, workers'travel
and workers'educational organiza-
tions and other groups conducting
workers'educational programmes in
Unesco's member States.
This edition will be printed in
English and French with an abridged
version in Spanish as very little
information was received about
workers'travel opportunities in
Latin American countries. A special
edition will also be published in
German.
Workers Abroad represents a
natural extension of Unesco's efforts
to reduce the barriers now blocking
the free movement of peoples. It is
being published to provide workers'
organizations with another tool in
their continual campaign to pull
down these barriers-a campaign
which has been carried on by most
of these organizations since their
foundation.
