Ware now undergoing aWW period of profound and rapid.
though uneven, and not infrequently
crisis-ridden change. This change is
largely connected with the ever-increa-
sing power available to man through
the development of science and
technology.
The roots of the crises lie, however,
in the crucial sphere of social relations
which to a considerable degree are
still not sufficiently adapted to cope
with the rapidity of change caused by
science and technology.
Technology is ambivalent. On the
one hand it has brought immense bene-
fits to mankind. On the other, it has
resulted in an incredible accumulation
of destructive devices. Furthermore,
the contradictions inherent in the
transfer of technology from the indus-
trial centres to the developing areas
of the world have brought very serious
maladjustments and disruptions. In-
equalities have been accentuated and
an extraordinary demographic growth
is taking place.
One thino is bevond doubt : none of
today and tomorrow can be solved
successfully if the conditions of peace
are not ensured, if the relaxation of
international tension is not transfor-
med into an irreversible process, and
if the enormous resources, today still
tied up with armaments, are not
gradually released for human dev-
elopment.
Efforts for the consolidation of
peace, which is to be understood as
a just and democratic system of inter-
national relations based on the prin-
ciples of peaceful coexistence and not
simply as the absence of war, should
be expanded in all spheres, from
economics to science, from diplomacy
to culture.
Annual expenditure on the arms race
is probably around 200 to 250 billion
dollars-a sum equal to the total natio-
nal income of those countries in which
the majority of mankind is living. At
the same time twenty-five hundred
million men and women live a largely
precarious existence at levels of nutri-
tion below the acceptable minimum.

The present growth-rate of these
populations is such that their number
is expected to double in 25 years.
The currently accessible resources
of the earth have their limits. Within
the space of a few generations we
are frittering away reserves of energy
be ! ow the ground which nature has
taken thousands of millions of years
to accumulate.
In the immediate future there is a
danger that we shall destroy, without
a thought for future generations, the
plants and trees produced over the
ages. In the last 50 years, nine-tenths
of the forests of some tropical islands
have disappeared. Many forests are
being ravaged by the paper industry,
on which the press of several indus-
trialized countries, as well as certain
other industries and commercial
interests make excessive demands.
The equatorial forest is being
attacked in turn. The future is also
being jeopardized through the excessi-
vely primitive exploitation of natural
resources by famished groups of
human beings. Their pressing needs
are destroying resources which, if
exploited rationally, would help to
ensure future progress.
Under the pressure of either justi-
fied or artificial imperatives designed
to maintain economic growth, increase
consumption or satisfy it without
heeding the consequences, today's
generations are plundering and pollu-
ting nature and condemning future
generations, tomorr-""-.. __. 1...------

"No man is an island, entire of
itself."The English poet John
Donne's famous words, written
in the 17th century, have never
been more relevant than today.
As inhabitants of a"global
village", our very survival calls for
an effort to rise above our
differences and to transcend
self-interest in the search for
solidarity as a world community.

evolution of the human outlook

A GROWING
CRISIS

Thus the very fact that our resources
 (whether renewable or not) are limited
would indicate that the"Western
model of development"cannot be
applied everywhere or at all times.
A plan of progress based on the Wes-
tern model until now considered by
some groups as capable of extension
all over the world, is henceforth faced
with fundamental contradictions.
In some societies where they are
firmly established, industrialization and
technology deprive individuals and
groups of the possibility of influencing
their living conditions, and hence their
own destiny.
The issue at stake is man's ability
to establish a comprehensible and
creative relationship between himself,
his group and the environment.
Human rights and freedoms are
threatened by multiple intrusions into
private life. As a result of the spread
of computer science and communica-
tion techniques, life is being condi-
tioned on the basis of surveys whose
aims in some cases are to a certain
extent inquisitorial. Thus some of the
industrialized countries must under-
take a new kind of struggle to defend
human rights, the very notion of which
is, an empty promise for the masses
of the developing countries who are
deprived of the most elementary
means of satisfying their needs.
These considerations emphasize the
close interdependence of the prob-
lems facing the modern world. We
are not faced with distinct problems,
each of which we may try to solve
separately and in isolation. We are
dealing with, a complex whole in which
mechanisms or phenomena are
closely interrelated, acting or reacting
on one another. The world must be
considered as a totality or a system
whose parts are organically linked.
A global view must therefore bea prerequ site to any attempt to
solve the different problems of today.
The United Nations declaration on a
New tnternationa ! Economic Order can
be regarded as an event of world-wide
significance attesting to the joint en-
deavours of nations to achieve a
positive settlement of urgent problems
of present-day social and economic
development. The introduction of a
New International Economic Order
obviously concerns not only econo-
mics, but is aiso a matter of social,
scientific, technological and cultural
relevance.
The problems of peace, of human
rights, and of the survival of mankind
are not to be separated from the
problems of development itself. For
this reason we should look beyond
economic development. We must give
up thinking of the centres of econo-
mic power as the sole repositories
of truth, civilization and universality.
It has been held in certain quarters
that industrial growth, modelled on
that of certain European or North
American centres, would itself bring
about a general improvement in human
conditions, each nation being free to
reproduce the proposed pattern for
itself. We must face the fact that
this is not so.
Once it is seen as global, develop-
ment can no longer be the direct
extension to the whole world of the
knowledge, ways of thought, life styles
or experiences specific to a single
region of the world ; each local dev-
elopment must be related to its own
values and culture.
It is not enough to transfer the sum
total of the knowledge available in
developed countries to the developing
countries ; to do this excludes the pos-
sibility of any genuine impl. antation of
science and technology in the coun-
tries at the receiving end. It favours
the"brain drain"and even slows down
the general advancement of knowledge
by depriving the creative imagination
of access to more varied sources than
those on which the existing system
drew.
The immediate problem facing the
developing countries is that of estab-
lishing an infrastructure for science.
As long as this does not exist, as
long as these countries do not possess
their own scientific capability, there
can be no authentic scientific dev-
elopment, but only transplantation of
imported science, which does not cor-
respond to the true needs of the
country.
The kind of scientific development
which does correspond to the needs
of a country can only be based on an
awareness of its civilization, traditions
and values.
Whilst science has been concerned
with discovering knowledge and un-
derstanding nature, its applications
have been largely governed by the
profit motive to the benefit of small
sections of human society-groups or
countries ; and indeed, in this process,
distortions have crept into the priori-
ties for the growth of science itself.
We would also like to draw atten-
tion to the huge sums spent on scien-
tifjc research, half of which at he, ast
are spent on armaments which become
obsolete or cancel one another out
as quickly as possible ; and to the
sums which are spent on stimulating
and attempting to satisfy unnecessary
needs of the consumer system.
An orientation of scientific and
technologic. al development basically
lacking any underlying commitment to
overall social progress has given rise
in many quarters to a feeling of"frus-
tration"and"disillusionment", to a call
for the"containment of science"and
for the"taming"of technology, ultima-
tely resulting in fear and hatred of
science and technology in general.
In actual fact, science is one of the
great creative manifestations of human
genius. What is needed is a new
concept and long-range international
strategy for the development of
science and technology which reflects
overall global social needs-a concept
and strategy that should not and must
not, in their rational advance, become
detached from the basic human orien-
tation and fundamental values of hu-
man life.
With the headlong progress of
science and technology, there are
new developments in the offing whose
implications are of a global nature for
human society as a whole-such as
interference with the genetic code,
deliberate efforts to modify climate,
mass employment of information sys-
tems and storage devices with per-
manent memories, industrial utilization
of micro-organisms, creation of closed
man-nature metabolism cycles and so
on.
CONCERTING questions of sofar-reaching a character, there is
need for a widely based discussion
leading to a global concept and in this
Unesco should play an important role ;
A truly sound concept of the future
of contemporary civilization can only
be based on a parallel development
of man and society on the one hand,
and technology on the other. We are
entering a period in which-without
well-thought-out programmes of social
development, without a purposeful
control of social processes and without
a purposeful shaping of our way of
life-man's socially useful abilities will
be prodigally wasted. We need to
realize that the control of social pro-
cesses is at once the most compre-
hensive and the most difficult task
confronting contemporary science.
Culture is not a luxury reserved for
those whose elementary needs are
satisfied ; it is linked with the organi-
zation of society, and to it society
owes its dynamic force. It is made up
of the wisdom of the illiterate or the
experience handed down through
generations of manual workers as well
as of the highest scholarship. Tradi-
tions which have been forgotten or
destroyed by inconsiderate moderni-
zation are irreparabte ! osses to the
understanding of our destiny.
To over-assert cultural particularities
is just as dangerous as to underrate
them. It is another way of running
the same risks. We must maintain
a constant equilibrium between scien-
ces and cultures, although this is not
enough. It must be matched by an
equilibrium in mutual efforts at com-
prehension, and by incessant adjust-
ments between what different cultures
have to learn from one another.
The processes of education have
clearly to be two-way. No educatio-
na) body can properly transmit what it
knows unless it is sufficiently familiar
with those to whom it is addressing
itself. And since no one can know
everything, mechanisms should be
established to provide balanced
exchanges and thus offset the inequa-
28

that a foreign language is learned
more easily at school when the pupil
knows how to use his own language.
Even learning of the most difficult kind
becomes readily accessible if the
learning process is based on ex-
perience that has been properly lived
and assimilated.
It is not to be taken for granted that
men will escape the course of events
which has led them to the present
dangers ; the survival of the planet is
at stake. Is it not high time to display
a certain modesty, a wisdom which
at times our ancestors possessed and
which could constitute the basis of a
new morality ?
What is at stake, indeed, is not
merely the survival of the human race,
but the survival of all living things.
If man really wants to live in harmony
with the natural environment, as he
c) aims he does today, he must show
respect not only for human rights but
also for the rights of life in its widest
tense. 1
lities of knowledge. The study and
setting up of mechanisms of this kind
is a particularly arduous task since
it has never yet been attempted.
If it had been possible for such
equilibria between the two comple-
mentary flows of communication to
exist spontaneously, the virtues of
peace, freedom, equality, and human
rights and duties would come just as
naturally to human beings as their
physiological functions.
