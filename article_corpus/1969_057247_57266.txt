Man against Nature - 4
BLUEPRINT FOR
PLANETARY MANAGEMENT
IHE very rapid advances
that characterize developing nations
today have produced dramatic new
kinds of interactions with the environ¬
ment that were not so evident in earlier
history.
Nowhere is the problem of accel¬
erated development and its devastat¬
ing consequences more evident than
in many regions of the tropics and sub-
tropics, where two-thirds of humanity
now live. Here the relations between
man and his environment are changing
so rapidly that well-balanced develop¬
ment is seriously endangered and, in
extreme cases, entire populations may
be threatened with extinction as some
actual examples reveal.
Owing to the rapid development of
ever greater land areas and the wide¬
spread use of powerful technological
methods, the various tropical biotic
communities are today undergoing

radical and extensive changes. De¬
forestation, irrigation, the introduction
of exotic plants and animals, the large-
scale use of weed-killers, the eradic¬
ation of certain pathogenic agencies,
etc., have transformed the tropical
landscape more profoundly in ten years
than the traditional agricultural and
stock-raising methods in ten centuries.
In addition to economic advantages,
immediate and undeniable, this "re¬
ordering" of the tropical ecosystems
has sometimes entailed a sudden col¬
lapse of the balances, generally going
back thousands of years, between Man
and his environment and given rise to
unexpected difficulties.
The introduction of livestock into the
savannas of tropical America has pro¬
moted the increase of rabies-trans¬
mitting haematophagous vampires. Ir¬
rigation of the savannas of the Sahel
in Africa has entailed the spread of
bilharziosis. Systematic deforestation
has frequently brought about trans¬
mission to men and domestic animals
of certain arboreal viruses, normally
confined to the pathogenic cycle of
the forest canopy. Some are capable
of causing sickness of little gravity to
monkeys and tree-dwelling rodents, but
they can be much more dangerous to
humans; yellow fever, dengue-fever,
Kyasanur forest disease, etc.
The abandonment of certain tradi¬
tional foods, both animal and vege¬
table, or their replacement by other
kinds of food more easily produced
has often served to aggravate already
existing nutritional deficiencies. Even
eradication of a number of tropical dis¬
eases may cause long-term difficulties.
In Africa, as in Asia and tropical
America, the last twenty years have
seen the rampant spread of bidon¬
villes, shantytowns, barrios and favel-

The plant is no
less appreciated
for its qualities
as a nourishing
foodstuff. The

The world's
largest plant,
and one of the
rarest, is this
Rafflesia which
can attain a width
of 3 feet. Growing
in Malaysia, it
is named after
a zealous British
amateur scientist,
Sir Stamford
Raffles. Stemless
and leafless, it
springs from
a fungus-type
growth which
attaches itself
to the stumps or
roots of vines
or creepers.
This species of
Rafflesia has five
pinkish-yellow
petals, but its
beauty is only

of plants are
now protected in
special reserves.

has of every description, whose crowd¬
ed inhabitants are all too often under¬
nourished, illiterate and have been
frequently ruthlessly severed from their
traditional values.
The pathology of this situation, which
is still little known, is a combination
of the effects of malnutrition and pov¬
erty, and the physical and psychical
effects of manifold stress. It has
resulted in the creation of a súb-
proletariat in poor physical condition,
which deprives agriculture of a source
of manpower but, at the same time, is
unable to offer skilled labour to in¬
dustry. As regards public health, sani¬
tary conditions in these shantytowns
represent a constant menace to the
great urban centres of which they are
a part.
The lure of new cities and industrial
centres involves unprecedented popul¬
ation movements which are the cause
of a demographic imbalance that is in
every way detrimental to the develop¬
ment of many tropical countries. These
migrations are, moreover, frequently
selective: they tend to leave the less
enterprising groups or individuals be¬
hind in the rural areas and to condemn
the majority of the better elements to
chronic unemployment. Populations
biologically well adapted to a special
environment (the high plateaux of the
Andes, for instance), sometimes find
themselves moved by these migrations
into areas climatically unsuited to
them.
These problems and there are many
of this kind require urgent study by
teams of specialists, including ecolo-
gists, medical experts, psycho-socio¬
logists and economists, with a view
to finding satisfactory solutions as
quickly as possible. Tropical ecosys¬
tems are at once so numerous, com¬
plex and delicate that nothing could
be more detrimental to the interests
of the human beings who inhabit them
than a pure and simple "transplanta¬
tion" to the tropics of techniques (and
sometimes even of ideas) which have
proved their effectiveness in the tem¬
perate latitudes.
Irrespective of past and present mis¬
takes, and of the new problems creat¬
ed by accelerated development due to
demographic, economic and social
growth, man has already in the past
tried to solve these problems of habitat
deteriorations; and new ways of think¬
ing and changing technologies give
him the desire and the possibilities
to build or rebuild an environment
which has the quality required for
mental health as well as to provide
the necessary goods and services.
Some examples are given below:
Enjoyment of nature as the hand of
man has arranged it, by people at
many levels of society is now a well-
established fact. There are the great
villas of the past, their gardens and
the manipulation of water for aesthetic
pleasure. We can think of China,
Rome, Persia and Renaissance Italy,
the architectural gardens of France
and the English ¡ardin intime. The
parks of Capability Brown, in England,
could not be enjoyed by his patrons
as we can enjoy them now with the
trees at their maturity. Gardening is
becoming enormously popular and
municipal authorities are gaining con¬
fidence In spending money on their
public parks. Increased affluence
creates a demand for environmental
amenity.
National parks are a major contrib¬
ution to civilization from conservation-
minded people who had a vision of
future human aspirations.
The best results of conservancy and
the study of wild nature have been
achieved through the establishment of
reserves and national parks with a
staff of scientists working permanent¬
ly in them.
