When people are robbed of their
h o m e s , land and possessions by violent
c o n f l i c t , time and time again they ask
for educat i o n . O ver the past decade, f r o m

K o s ovo, the United Nations has been
confronted in all-too-close succession by
w h at are commonly referred to as complex
political emergencies.These crises invo l-
ving violent internal conflicts based on
n at i o n a l i s t , l o c a l , ethnic and religious fa c-
t o rs , lead to huge internal and extern a l
population displacements,the looting and
destruction of infrastructure,the targeting
of civilian populations and the collapse of
essential basic serv i c e s.Their spread, p a r-
ticularly in A f ri c a , owes much to the break-
d own of the post-colonial settlements of the
1950s and 1960s held in place somewhat
a rtificially by superp ower ri va l ries duri n g
the Cold War and associated ideological and
geopolitical alignments.
Warlords and bandits
At the root of many such emergencies
are escalating economic problems that have
s t i m u l ated fierce inter-group struggles ove r
access to and control over resources. I n
some cases, such as Somalia, violent intern a l
conflicts have led to the collapse of the
s t at e ,l e aving ordinary citizens at the mercy
of warlords and bandits.
Assuring survival is of course the first
task of any humanitarian operation.This
means providing basic services such as food,
wat e r ,s e c u ri t y, health care and shelter. B u t
along with this,there is a steadily growing
recognition of the need to introduce edu-
cation in the early stages of humanitarian
a s s i s t a n c e , whether it be for refugees, i n t e r-
nally displaced persons or wa r - a f f e c t e d
p o p u l at i o n s.This notion, of relat i vely recent
o ri gi n , d r aws upon several justificat i o n s.
One is the right to education itself, a right
which is not forfeited because of war or
d i s p l a c e m e n t .This right is enshrined in the
C o nvention on the Rights of the Child
(1989) and was at the heart of the Jomtien
Conference (1990) on Education for All.
These developments have helped to gene-
r ate an intern ational policy context condu-
cive to the recognition not only of everyo-
n e ’s right to education but also of the
o b l i g ation of all social actors — a g e n c i e s ,
donors and NGOs—to translate that right
into practice.
At a practical leve l , e d u c at o rs and psy-
c h o l o gists emphasize the importance for
c h i l d r e n ’s development of minimizing the
p e riod during which learning is disru p t e d .

SCHOOL ING IN TIMES
OF STRIFE
w Mark Richmond
From ‘school-in-a-box’ packages to counselling for children traumatized by fear and
bereavement, education is playing a pivotal role in emergency relief operations

and help them to maintain a connection to
their own socio-cultural env i r o n m e n t .W h e-
ther formal or non-form a l , schooling can
re-establish a sense of norm a l cy in an
a b n o rmal situat i o n , and offer alienated yo u t h
an altern at i ve to militias, c ri m e ,d e l i n q u e n cy
or dru g s. In emergency situat i o n s , s c h o o l s
can be one of the most valuable channels for
c o m m u n i c ating messages about the env i-
r o n m e n t , n u t ri t i o n , mine awa r e n e s s , c h o-
lera and Aids preve n t i o n .They are also places
where themes such as human ri g h t s ,p e a c e
and reconciliation can be broached. S u c h
values constitute the underpinning of any
subsequent programme of national recons-
t ru c t i o n .M o r e ove r , schools can often serve
as centres for relief and rehabilitation pro-
grammes for the community at large. E d u-
c ation can offer opportunities for paid
e m p l oyment and provide adults with a
chance to play a role in their new, a l b e i t
t e m p o r a ry, s u rr o u n d i n g s.Last but not least,
e d u c ation symbolizes a commitment to the
f u t u r e , something more valuable than ever in
the afterm ath of violent confli c t .
While each crisis calls for a specific type
of rapid educational response, the trage-
dies of the past decade have given interna-
tional agencies sufficient experience to draw
up guidelines for conducting operat i o n s.
Because it is impossible to get a schooling
system into gear ove rn i g h t , a phased
approach enabling education to be intro-
duced in the early stages of humanitarian
assistance has become standard practice in
emergency situations.
After the collection of relevant educa-
tional data (number of children, ava i l a b i l i t y
of teachers, etc.), a first phase brings chil-
dren together for recreation activities—
games,songs,listening to stories,and per-
haps some simple lessons. D u ring a second
p h a s e ,n o n - f o rmal schooling is established
on a systematic basis, often using a Te a-
cher Emergency Package (TEP), w h i c h
was first conceived by UNESCO for use in
Somalia and has now been translated into
s e veral languages and culturally adapted
to suit different populations.
Although the concept is evolving, this
“ s c h o o l - i n - a - b ox ” or “mobile classroom” i s
designed for approx i m ately 80 refugee chil-
dren of pri m a ry school age and aims to
teach functional literacy and numeracy,
r ather than a formal graded curri c u l u m
with exams. A box typically includes slat e s ,
chalk, exercise books and pencils for stu-
dents and a teacher’s bag containing cloth
charts (alphabet, number and multiplica-
tion),a guide outlining teaching methods,
an attendance book and scrabble sets of
small wooden blocks so that teachers can
create language and number games. Desi-
gned for a six-month learning span,TEPs
act as a bridge between no schooling at all
and a return to some form of regular schoo-
ling.
After this interim peri o d , the third phase
of near-normal schooling generally begi n s ,
based on curricula and textbooks (when
available) from the country of ori gi n .A n o t h e r
i m p o rtant aspect of emergency educat i o n
p r o grammes is the training of teachers to
recognize symptoms of trauma in children
who all too often arri ve in their new makeshift
schools after witnessing appalling levels of
h o rror and violence. Psycho-social support
p r o grammes include counselling to help
children come to terms with loss, b e r e ave-
m e n t , displacement and fear.
This entire strategy is geared towards
e d u c ation for repat ri at i o n . The concept,
f i rst clearly art i c u l ated during the expe-
rience of providing schooling to Mozam-
bican refugees in Malawi in the 1980s,has
gained growing acceptance in the 1990s,

influx, need to be reassured that refugees
will not settle there on a permanent basis.
Hence the importance of using the mother
tongue as the language of instru c t i o n , of tea-
ching the curriculum of the country of
o ri gin (provided it has not been a source of
oppression to the displaced populat i o n ) ,
and relying largely or wholly upon refugee
teachers to staff the schools.
The notion that education is geared
t owards repat ri ation adds a long-term
dimension to the concept of emergency. It
implies that planners think along a relief-to-
d e velopment continuum that fits in with
the development policy being designed for
a country or sub-regi o n . U n f o rt u n at e l y,
this is not a linear process: c o u n t ries such as
Angola and Sudan have slipped in and out

efforts at national reconstruction.
Community initiatives
Broadly speaking, emergencies can be
c o n c e i ved as opportunities for educat i o n a l
t r a n s f o rm at i o n .This is why the planning of
e m e r g e n cy educat i o n , especially when the
task of rebuilding educational systems begi n s ,
must integr ate an approach that combines
t o p - d own technical planning,which tends to
c h a r a c t e rize most postwar systems, w i t h
bottom-up community-oriented deve l o p-
ment initiat i ve s. In emergency situat i o n s ,
p a r e n t s ,e l d e rs and professionals often play
an important role in the setting-up and ru n-
ning of schools, often developing a sense of
ow n e rship towards them.
They should continue to have a voice in
the planning of education after resettling in
their country of ori gi n . But traditional ave-
nues through which financial support is
channelled for reconstruction tend to
exclude civil society. D o n o rs go through
the central state—often a highly weakened
state with poor administrative and mana-
gement capacity—to deliver funds, a
method that tends to undermine more par-
t i c i p at o ry approaches to educational plan-
n i n g . The intern ational community also
needs to take stock of recent interventions
and assess them in more thorough and cri-
tical way s. The turn over of crises in the
past decade has been such that sufficient
time has not been devoted to actually lear-
ning from the past. R ather than jump onto
the next emergency, key practitioners
i nvo l ved in large-scale operations should
be given the opportunity to take stock so
that institutional knowledge can be accu-
m u l ated and lessons learnt can inform
future practices. Such reflection could also
s e rve to put education higher up on the
agenda when defining budgets and priori-
ties for complex emergencies. n
