Le sida déferle: a l e r t e z les jeunes!International Y ar 2000: peace is in our ha ds
When Tian Huiping discovered that her son,
Ta o t a o, was autistic, the world closed in
on her. Her doctor in the huge inland
metropolis of Chongqing had never seen a case of
autism and was in no position to give any counsel.
Neither could she turn to a community or a
g ove rnment department for support , China being
a country where disabilities are even today not publi-
cly discussed, scarcely researched and to all intents
and purposes not treat e d .
N ow, eight ye a rs after the painful discove ry of
Ta o t a o ’s condition,Tian has managed not only to
find a way to support her son, but also through crea-
ting the country ’s first and so far only school for
autistic children,has offered a ray of hope to those
suffering from the disease.
To bring the Stars and Rain School for autis-
tic children to where it is today required determ i-
nation,hard work and creativity in fund-raising.It
also demanded a dri ve to keep going even when the
mission seemed doomed.“People say to me,‘Why
should we spend all of this time and money if there
is no cure?’ I try to tell them that to get a child func-
tioning will give that child a better life,” she says.
Tian came to Beijing in 1992 with nothing but
a suitcase and her son to look for someone who
could offer her help and advice.One doctor’s offi-
ce had a pamphlet about children with autism, a
condition marked by severely limited responsive-
ness to others and abnormal speech pat t e rn s. F r o m
w h at little inform ation the pamphlet gave her,T i a n
decided she was the best person to try and help Ta o-
t a o, n ow 14. Her personal quest soon turned into a
mission to help others like her.
Her idea for a school was picked up by a bu s i-
nessman who thought it might be a good way to
make money. She enrolled six autistic children and
hired two teachers.The businessman backed out of
their arrangement but Tian was so encouraged by
the improvement of the children that she and one
of the teachers decided to go it alone.They pac-
ked all their possessions into a cardboard box and
moved to a single dingy room in Beijing.
The fees for the cours e , which among other
things teaches parents to help their children and
lasts about three months,are about $120 per child—
a lot of money in a country where most make just
about that each month. E ven so, these funds are
i n s u f fic i e n t .T h a n k f u l l y,T i a n ’s work has at t r a c t e d
the attention of the foreign community in Beijing,
and a few foreign children from diplomat fa m i l i e s
have attended the school.
Tian says that to meet annual costs she needs to
raise about $12,000, while development will
demand another $24,000.The school has recei-
ved aid from the Canada Fund, the A u s t rian gove rn-
m e n t , and Hong Kong’s Round Ta b l e , a philan-
thropic organizat i o n . For the past few ye a rs a
C h ristmas Bazaar has been held at the Germ a n
embassy in Beijing with some of the proceeds going
to Tian’s school.
Before Stars and Rain,autistic children in Bei-
jing could only attend schools for the mentally disa-
b l e d . In many cases this doesn’t work well for autis-
tic children because often they are extremely
intelligent and above the level being taught. S t a rs
and Rain tries to enable the child to function first,
and then  hopefully integrate into regular schools.
When Tian started the school and parents wo u l d
come to her or telephone from across the country
asking for inform ation about autism to help their
c h i l d r e n , she had a list of three doctors in China
who could diagnose the illness. N ow, six ye a rs lat e r ,
she proudly  shows a list of more than 20 doctors
who have an understanding of autism.
The school holds four sessions a year and is boo-
ked at least six  months in adva n c e .The current ses-
sion has 27 pupils and that ’s about the maximum
the school can handle at a time.
Next project on T i a n ’s hori z o n : raising money
to buy a house for adult sufferers. n

a school in Beijing to help her son and other suffere rs.
