The sea, the desert and the jungle

THE extension of human life
and civilization over the
earth is limited by large
unproductive and uninhabitable
areas of desert, of jungle and of
the sea. They have long been
mapped and explored; lines of
communication have been laid
across them; explorers have des¬
cribed them well. But they remain
essentially as obstacles to man, not
as assets, though each of them is
rich in unused resources.
To study those .resources and to
make them useful is a large prob¬
lem in research which becomes
more urgent as the population of
the earth increases. It cannot be
solved by any single nation. The
deserts and the jungle do not
respect national boundaries but,
like the sea, touch the vital
interests of many lands: To con¬
trol the jungle, to water and
fertilize the desert and to develop
marine life for human food are
now necessities for they are
activities which would benefit a
large section of mankind. To
make this possible requires an
international research programme.
Such research has been one of
the objectives of Unesco since its
inception, although Unesco is best
known for its educational work. It
is true that the conditions of
human life can be greatly improv¬
ed by the spread of present
knowledge and of practices which
are well established in some
countries. But there are many
fields in which the entire sum of
human knowledge is inadequate
and where more knowledge must
be gained by research for the
benefit of all.
Using the sun's energy
Some of these problems, like the
direct utilization of the sun's
energy and the understanding
of the weather, are world-wide.
Others are primarily of regional
interest. Thus, for instance,
Unesco was responsible for the
organization of the European
Council for Nuclear Research
which will open new opportunities
for the study of this great new
field of science to the students
and scientists of Europe, by
combining the resources of the
European countries to establish
a research laboratory at Geneva
which would inherently be too
costly for any one of them.
Unesco has also sponsored the
organization of an International
Computation Centre to be located
in Rome which will make available
to the scientists of all the world
the most modern electronic equip¬
ment for complicated mathematic¬
al calculations which are vital to
the solution of many problems.
These are typical Unesco
research projects, one of world
importance, the other regional.
The studies of the sea, the desert
and the jungle have progressed
more slowly. One reason is that
they involve many nations scatter¬
ed widely over the earth and not
a single compact region.
Unesco's Advisory Committee on
the Problems of the Arid Zones,
for instance, includes experts from
Peru, Mexico, India, Turkey, Aus¬
tralia, U. S., Syria, England and
France. The Committee covers
the sciences of meteorology
geology, hydrology, plant ecology,
soil science, agricultural engineer¬
ing and zoology.
The ocean's riches
Thus the great problems of the
deserts are jointly attacked
and the results are pooled for
the benefit of all. Slowly but cer¬
tainly the result will be the impro¬
vement of agricultural and even
industrial conditions in the arid
regions and the utilization of sun¬
shine, of mineral resources and of
enhanced arid-zone vegetation. It
may be some time before the desert
"blooms" or can support a large
population but definite improve¬
ments are already a reality.
A similar study is now being
organized for the jungle areas,
technically known as the "humid
tropical zones", where vegetation
of all sorts is ample but where its
control for prosperous and healthy
human life has been difficult. The
conquest of the jungle will not be
effected by explorers but by
scientific research.
Even more important, especially
to the populous nations of the
Orient, is a proposed study of the
resources of the ocean. There Is
far more life and food In the sea
than on the land yet it provides
only a small fraction of man's
food. The cultivation of sea
plants and the collection of fish
and other sea animals for food
could undoubtedly be greatly
increased if the exact conditions
of life in the sea were better
understood, especially in their
relation to adjoining land areas.
At Manila last November,
scientists from the Indo-Pacific "
nations met with officers of
Unesco and of the U. N. Food and
Agricultural Organization to
discuss international action to
promote and serve research in
the marine sciences and the
exploitation of marine resources.
The scope and importance of
Unesco's programme of scientific
research require close contact
with governmental research labo¬
ratories. For this reason a new
Advisory Committee on Scientific
Research has just been created.
