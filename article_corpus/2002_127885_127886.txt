“I remember:
we left Saint
Petersburg (Russian
Federation) during the
winter. I was afraid of
what awaited me in
my new home
country.  At first, it
was the heat in Israel
that surprised me, and
the children who
spoke a language I
couldn’t understand.
Then I learned the
language and made
friends.”
Iliya is nine years
old.  Like thousands
of children aged from
nine to 15, he
participated in a
writing contest for
aspiring short film (10-
15 minutes) and
cartoon makers
sponsored by
television channels
from around the world
— from Chile to
China, passing through
Belgium, Hungary,
Ireland, Israel and
Italy.
The winners
gathered in Treviso,
Italy, from May 27 to
June 2 to present their
works at the
international CIAK*
Junior Festival.
Created by the Alcuni
group, a cultural
association that
produces youth
programming, the
event is sponsored by
UNESCO and the
International Council
for Cinema, Television
and Audiovisual
Communication
(CICT).
The children’s
works were judged by
groups made up of
directors, psychologists
and teachers. Some
6,000 scripts were
received in Italy, while
20,000 entries came
from China. In Israel,
“Moving”, Iliya’s film,
was selected. At the
festival, his work
received the prize for
best group of actors
and UNESCO’s Fellini
medal.
But the work of two
classes of students
from the Belgian city
of Bruges took home
the festival’s prize for
best film. “Shadows”
tells the story of
Hanne, a teenager who
goes blind.  The issues
confronted by the
students are serious
but their message
remains positive: make
peace, protect the
environment...
This festival —
where children get to
be creators, actors and
spectators at the same
time — highlights the
educative role that
television can play in
children’s lives.  For
Damir Dijakovic, from
UNESCO’s Venice
office, the CIAK Junior
festival has become “a
place where those who
want television to be
instructive can
brainstorm.”
