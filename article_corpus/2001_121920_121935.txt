t ’s five in the morning. The day dawns in the
Jalrez Va l l e y.Along the base of rocky mountains
topped by snow-capped peaks, a band of
vegetation stretches for 50 kilometres.We pass
groups of women in brightly-coloured clothing
and children herding sheep.Bomb craters still scar the
ground while flags flutter in the wind,
commemorating the s h a h i d s—the martyrs of the
war against the Soviet Union. Soon we come to the
village of Doabi, with its 560 inhabitants and 80
f a m i l i e s.
“Asalam-aleikum!”Hadji Amin,the khan—the
equivalent of mayor—gives us the traditionally warm
Afghan reception.We talk about the major problem
of the moment,the drought.More than a score of the
valley’s 180 villages have been badly hit and 10,000
people out of the local population of 50,000 may be
forced to leave the area.After 20 years of war, t h e r e
remains no government institution able to mount
any relief operation.That now depends entirely on the
villages themselves and on the links they have forged
with humanitarian organizations such as Solidarités
and agronomists working in the region.
The drought has affected non-irrigated crops
across the whole country.Amin has heard that more
and more people are fleeing abroad, and that
hundreds of families are arriving each day in the
refugee camps on the border with Pakistan or in the
western town of Herat. Some of them have been
through this grim experience before.At the height
of the war,as many as six million people are thought
to have fled the country. Today, 2.6 million are still
refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
Despite the gravity of this new crisis, p e o p l e
are forging a response. This is probably the only
constant in the country’s recent history. The war
took the lives of a million A f g h a n s.To d a y,ten million
mines are still strewn throughout the land and
tremendous hardship endures, but the villages are
mitigating some of the damage through their solid
traditional structures.
In Doabi, daily life is based on almost total self-
s u f fic i e n cy. Wh e a t , potatoes and fruit are grown,
while chickens, sheep and goats are raised along with
a few cows and beehives. In this broad-based rural
e c o n o m y,people trade with each other,put together
community work teams and help families in need.
Sipping tea until
consensus is reached
At the end of the summer, in the yards where the
grain is threshed,everyone hands over a share of his
harvest to the mullah, another to the mirab—the
“water overlord” who looks after the irrigation
canals—and one to the shepherd. The rest is then
divided up. The farmers are proud that Pakistani
merchants come all the way here to buy apples,
production of which has been expanded in
recent years.
Whenever a dispute surfaces in the village or
with a neighbouring one, or when some kind of
wider threat arises, such as drought, the village
assembly meets. This is the d j i r g a (in the Pashtu
l a n g u a g e, or s h u r a in Dari),which gathers together
the elders, the q a z i (religious judge), the mullah, t h e
t e a c h e r, a few farmers—some of them former
resistance chiefs—and of course the khan. All the
men wear a turban, s h i r t ,
baggy trousers and a p a t u, a
thin wool shawl.Over tea,
everyone listens and has
their say. Decisions arise
once consensus is reached.
It would be wrong to
see the d j i r g a as a simple
stopgap making up for the
lack of other systems of
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n . B y

ALAIN BOINET
DIRECTOR OFTHE FRENCH NGO SOLIDARITÉS,
HASWORKEDIN AFGHANISTAN OVERTHE PAST 20 YEARS
A f g h a n i s t a n:
in the valley of
d r o u g h t
T h roughout this nation shattere d
by years of war, t raditional village
assemblies have continued
to gather, p roving their deep
commitment to bettering
everyday life
The place where disputes are settled and decisions made.

have often been summoned at the regional and
even national level.By keeping up the local d j i r g a s,
the traditional system which has helped to define the
common good for the whole country is being
m a i n t a i n e d . Even if this seems a pipe-dream today,
Amin adds that everyone is convinced it is the best
way forward.
Afghanistan is a patchwork of ethnic groups
and the Jalrez Valley hosts a rare combination.Its
people are mainly Pashtuns,but there are also Ta j i k s
and Hazaras—reputedly descendants of Genghis
Khan’s soldier-workers—who make up the Shiite
minority in a country that is 85 percent Sunni
Muslim.Other ethnic groups in the valley include
Turkmens, Uzbeks and Nuristanis.
We stop in front of the mosque in Qala Ali, a
village high in the mountains hard hit by the
d r o u g h t , where about 40 Hazara families live.A s i d e
from hosting the shura, the mosque also welcomes
travellers and serves as a school,where the mullah
teaches the Koran,writing and basic arithmetic to
the village children.
Mullah A h m a d , who is clearly in charge, s p e a k s
for the village, which has managed to retain its
quasi-autonomy despite the wars. Tr a d i t i o n a l l y,
some of the menfolk go off to Kabul or Iran to
earn more money for their families; this year the
exodus is larger than normal.
There has been no rain for two years.The wheat
harvest has shrunk by 80 percent and the potatoes
are not growing any more.The villagers have sold a
few of their animals and everyone has gone into debt
while awaiting better days. Education is Ahmad’s
other big concern. For several years the village
assembly has wanted to hire a m o a l e m ( t e a c h e r ) ,b u t
money is shorter than ever.
In 1974, A f g h a n i s t a n , one of the world’s
1 0 poorest countries, had 500,000 school pupils,
1 5 , 0 0 0 teachers (2,000 of them women), 350 schools
for girls and 2,500 for boys. The national system
was certainly patchy, but it provided education up
to university level.To d a y, education depends entirely
on the meagre resources of the villages and teacher-
training has vanished.
The new masters of Kabul
On the drive back to Kabul, we pass men on
horses and large trucks brightly painted with lions
and flowers going up to the pass. Over the past few
years, this route has changed.There is more traffic
n o w, you do not see any armed men and the
checkpoints manned by this or that faction at almost
every kilometre have gone.
Our driver explains how the Taliban took control
of the valley soon after they entered Kabul in
September 1996. First they sent several men to call
for a ceasefire, threatened those who resisted with
dire punishment and bought off any hesitant
f a c t i o n s.Only after that did they install their military
and civilian governors.
Public services are non-existent. But thanks to a
balance of power very much in their favour, t h e
Taliban have ended the interminable faction wars.
The country still has no legitimate government,
fighting continues in the northeast, stronghold of
General Ahmed Shah Massoud, and violence
occasionally flares up elsewhere.The new masters of
Kabul have nevertheless managed to obtain a
monopoly of force, one of the state’s primordial
roles.
One day, perhaps, a great national djirga will
define the common good and the duties of a new
national state. M e a n w h i l e, the inhabitants of the
v a l l e y, exhausted by 20 years of fighting, h a v e
decided to lay down their arms for peace and
security, two things they lost sight of long ago. ■
