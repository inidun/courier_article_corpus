lOW SALERNO IIGITED
A PI TI TIROUGI TIE
"DARK AGES"
by Dr. Riccardo LUZZATO
WHEN the Provinces of the Western Empire wereoverfiooded by primitive warrior tribes in the fifth
century, the great wealth of scientific knowledge
created and accumulated by the Romans, Greeks and the
older eastern civilizations seemed irretrievably lost to
Europe. Yet, during the troubled centuries of the early
Middle Ages there was established an international
scientific organization which was to flourish for more
than 500 years, in the face of all the violent prejudice
At the start 01 the ninth century, Salerno was simply a little coastal
town to whose hospital came many sick people from Rome. Gradually,
more doctors arrived in Salerno and they were followed by students
of both sexes (as is shown in the above engraving) from many Medi-
terranean and Western European countries. The medical school of
Salerno-"the most celebrated of all those formed in the West after
the fall of the Roman Empire"came into being. It ofücially ceased
to exist in 1811, but already for some time past had only existed in
name. Today, not a stone remains of the famous"Hippocratic City"
where generations of doctors from many countries worked for the
advancement of medical science.
then prevailing in the Christian
world.
Sometime during the ninth
century, in the lovely seaside
town of Salerno in Southern
Italy, a school was founded
which was to renew and
preserve medical knowledge for
the \World and provide an
everlasting example of the
practicality and importance of
intercultural co-operation.
The masters oj Salerno stimulated enthusiasm
for scientific experiment throughout Europe
for many years. Such experiments included
that made by a sixteenth century Venetian
doctor named Sanctorius. who invented a
balance to help him determine the amounl
and weight 01 perspiration given oij by the
human body in relation to the effects 01
lood and drink. The above engraving shows
Sanctorius itting in the balance he invented.
The Venetian doctor calculated that for every
8 lbs. oj food and drink consumed in a day,
5 Ibs. were lost through the pores oj the
skin. The importance oj this knowledge, he
held. was that"most illnesses are caused
through an excels or a lack oj perspiration".
History at that time did not
yet reach the remarkable
standards of medical science,
and records are incomplete
about the early days of the
Civitas Hippocratica, as the
school was called in honour of
the greatest physician of An-
cient Greece. Modern histo-
rians generally agree however,
in ascribing its foundations to
four scholars : Master Adela,
an Arab, Master He-
linus, a Jew, Master
Pcntus, a Greek-and
Master Salernus, an
Italian. Each taught
in his language, which
meant Latin for Saler-
nus and Hebrew for
Helinus.
The next news we
have states that in 904
a Salernitan physi-
cian was in residence
at the court of the
King of France. In
984, Alberon, Bishop of
Verdun, came to seek
the advice of the
Salernitan physicians.
At a later period many
other princes of the
Church and secular
rulers had recourse to
their aid.
The international
character of the insti-
tution is illustrated
by the fact that the
nationality of many of
its famous teachers
was hardly known. At
the Civitas Hippo-
cratica, they were
just teachers, and the
thousands of students
who came from Arabia,
Africa, Spain, Britain,
Palestine, Northern
France and other countries
knew and cared little about
the origins of their professors.
This applies, for instance, to
Gabriopontus who died about
líJ50. Some historians think he
was a Greek, others that he
was a Lombard, others again
that he was a Salernitan.
Works Of"Dame Trot"
OKIE of his best knownsuccessors, Constantinus
Africanus, was born in Car-
thage and made long journeys
to Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia and
India, to bring the latest
achievements of Eastern
science to Salerno.
The passion for science at
Salerno was strong enough to
overcome more than one form
of prejudice. A prominent fi-
gure of the early period was
the woman physician Trotula,
about whose personality little
is known, although she left a
number of medical treatises
which were used as textbooks
up to the sixteenth century
and were first printed by
Aldus in Venice in 1547. Other
women too were admitted to
the lectures and to study.
Woman doctor Tr otul a
acquired such a wide fame,
that she gained a certain
popularity in old English liter-
ature under the name of
"Dame Trot"and became
Madame Trotte in the thirt-
eenth century medical trou-
vère Rutebceuf (Le Dex de
I'Erberle).

THE FOUR HUMAN TEMPERAMENTS
QUATUOR HUMORES HUMANO CORPORE CONSTANT : SANGUIS CUM
CHOLERA. MELANCHOLIA QUOQUE, PHLEGMA. According to the
Salerno School :"Those of sanguine temperament, servants of Venus
and favourites of Bacchus, have a jovial humour... the choleric man
has a bold heart but a lean body, slender and sickly.... The melan-
cholic person, of a sombre and sometimes crabbed humour, is diligenl
in his studies, but sleeps badly and broods over his plan. with
stubborn concentration.... As for the phlegmatic person, he is short
of stature, broad and thick-set and frigidly resists all forms of agitation..."
Written records of the Sa-
lerno school show the influence
upon it of the great Arabian
schools of the Orient and
Mohammedan Spain. The Per-
sian physicians Rhazes (865-
925) and Avicenna (980-1037) ;
and the Spanish Arabians
Avenzoar (1113-1162) and
Averroes (1126-1198), as well
as the great Maimonides, a
Spanish Jew (1135-1204), were
intensively studied at Salerno.
Two of the most celebrated
Jewish physicians, the urolo-
gist Isaac Judaeus (9th or lOth
century) and the oculist Ben-
venutus Grassus (born in

universality of science, even
in the so-called Dark Ages,
was the long-continued colla-
boration of Christians, Mos-
lems and Jews, during the
whole of European history's
"crusading season". To the
average European of the Middle
Ages, whoever did not belong
to the orthodox Christian
Church, whether he was a Jew,
a Moslem, a Hindu, a pagan-
or worst of all a heretic-was
hardly considered as a human
being.
century) had studied and
taught at the Salerno school.
From Salerno and Mont-
pellier came also the famous
French physician Pierre Gilles
de Corbeil, who later taught
in Paris and became court
physician to King Philippe
Auguste. The Emperor Fred-
erick II, son of a Norman
Italian mother and a German
father, followed the recom-
mendations of the school of
Salerno. At his brilliant court
at Palermo the dignitaries
were chosen from among great
thinkers, regardless of their
ancestry or creed, and Arabic
was almost as largely used as
Italian and Latin. As Jatf' :'I. S
1413 King Ladislaus of Hun-
gary gave special privileges to
Salerno teachers.
The school made one. par-
ticularly memorable literary
contribution, in the poem
"Regimen Sanitatis Salernita-
num", probably dedicated to
Robert, eldest son of William
the Conqueror and pretender
to the throne of England. It
was re-edited over 300 times
and translated into many lan-
guages. From Arnold of Vil-
lanova's edition in 1553 may be
quoted the following verses :
"The Salerne School doth by
these lines impart All health
to England's King and doth
aduise, From care his head to
keepe, from wrath his heart...
Use three Physicians still :
first Doctor Quiet, Next Doctor
Merry-Man and Doctor Dyet"
and to on for 362 stanzas.
A Scientific Renaissance
SALERNO re-awakened ascientific spirit, i depen-
dent of dogmatic doctrines :
, revived ancient texts, and
inspired its students to a calm
and critical appraisal of facts
as they found them. Thus,
Salerno paved the way for the
greaF achievements of the uni-
versities of the Renaissance.
Its outstanding accomplish-
ments and its lasting influence
were possible because, right
from the beginning, it over-
came the towering barriers of
religious and national preju-
dice and aimed to make know-
ledge available to the greatest
possible number of people 01
all countries of the. then
known world.

of"Regimen Sanitatis Salernilalum"published in Venice in 1567.
