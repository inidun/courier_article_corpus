The first time I came up against racism
was in France. I was nine years old,and
blacks were given nicknames in my
s c h o o l . Was this racism? Coming from
c h i l d r e n , it might just seem like
f o o l i s h n e s s, but still it affected me. I ’d
come from Guadeloupe, where many
communities live together, and I’d never
felt any discrimination there.
Racism isn’t natural. I t ’s thought out,
and generated by adults who establish
differences on the basis of skin colour
and culture. To do away with it, schools
have a critical role to play. Children still
learn about “human races,” whereas there
is in fact only one race. It would be more
accurate to speak about different
communities.
The history of peoples is very badly
taught: each country grabs hold of it to
justify their past behaviour. L i k e w i s e, I ’v e
always been shocked that blacks only
appear in the history books from the time
of slavery.Their life before this dramatic
page of history is never revealed, as if
they had always been slaves! Their true
past and culture are all too often scorned,
creating a historical void and pulling a
veil down over the memory of these
peoples.
If we want to have the slightest hope
of eradicating racism,we have to commit
ourselves to the task of memory.C e r t a i n
nations must recognize the wrongs they
have done, especially with regard to
s l a v e r y, which I believe is one of the
sources of racism. The truth must be
w r i t t e n ,not in a spirit of vengeance, but as
a way to set us on the path toward
genuine reconciliation.
The battle is far from won. When I
arrived in Italy in 1996, I didn’t notice
any signs of racism or xenophobia.Then
the situation suddenly took a turn for the
worse. Why this rejection of the other?
Why this aggression? These questions
remain unanswered.
I lived through a painful experience
during a match in Parma,my club at the
time. Some fans started chanting a song
about two black players:“Ba eats bananas
in Weah’s hut.”At the end of the match,
I raised the incident with other members
of the club. I felt their indifference, and
could not accept it. Keeping silent is the
worst attitude to take. The fight against
racism is also a fight against silence.
I meet regularly with Italian school
kids and try to drive home the importance
of communities mixing with one
another—a source of vital cultural
e n r i c h m e n t . I’m convinced that these
youngsters would not throw their weight
behind the kind of racist antics that are
given free rein in football stadiums.
I t ’s not enough to talk about the good
things being done.You have to face what
is bad, and use it to consider what is
w r o n g. Evil must be fought on the spot so
that it does not lead to intolerable
p r o b l e m s. Fo o t b a l l , for example, is a very
powerful social force: we have to work
towards eliminating all forms of racism in
stadiums and stop people from using this
sport as a platform for their unacceptable
opinions.
I am disappointed that racism is still
alive and kicking. I t ’s been around for
c e n t u r i e s. We ’re always being told that
we live in a wonderful world that has
brought people closer together thanks
to new technologies.But reality is harsh:
we have not made much progress in
spiritual terms. The right to be different,
even from one’s neighbour,does not exist.
G l o b a l i z a t i o n ,as I see it,means respecting
the other, respecting a person’s
d i f f e r e n c e s,because each and everyone of
us carries a different history inside. ■
