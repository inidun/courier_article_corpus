ARE NOT ENOUGH

Liberia, Mrs. Awori
has spent ten years in Kenya and Uganda,
acquiring a profound knowledge of the
special problems of the African woman.
THE international cry for equal
rights for women is not the
panacea for the problems of the
African woman. Whether equal rights
have been the solution to the problems
of an oppressed group anywhere has
yet to be proved. It is therefore
necessary that the problems which the
African woman faces be examined and
their nature determined before an
adequate solution is suggested.
My standpoint is that the exploita¬
tion which the African woman expe¬
riences today, as a result of her
changing role within changing social
systems, can only be solved by also
taking a look at the role men play in
society.
So I propose to examine one of the
most prevalent problems of the African
woman today, namely the problem of
increased and ever increasing res¬
ponsibilities, in the light of women's
response to these problems and the
proposed international solution of
equal rights.
When it is said in Africa that the
home is the responsibility of the
woman, the statement is not to be
interpreted lightly. It does not simply
refer to the cleaning and cooking and
child-care, but also to the production
and preparation of all that goes into
making her home.
In the Western world a man works
to "provide" for his family. In the
traditional African sense this is the
responsibility of the woman. The
father was important in that it was
through him that a woman and her
children gained membership of a
group and rights within it. He was
also supposed to be the protector and
custodian of his family and its wealth.
So whereas the wealth, property,
children and even the wife could be
said to be "owned" by the father and
his agnatic group, the responsibility of
maintaining and improving those items
owned by her husband fell to the
wife. Even though the responsibility
was great, at least she had the
assistance of others in the homestead
together with the assistance and moral
support of her husband.
In colonial and post independent
Africa this situation has been subject¬
ed to severe changes. The mobility of
men in search of employment and
education leaves women with the full
burden of the family. From Cape
Town to Tunis millions of women have
experienced what it means to be fa¬
ther, mother, husband, wife even
though they are not widows. The
drift into urban areas and mines leaves
women without the protection and
assistance of their husbands.
Our rural sister is the worst hit by
this mobility. Her husband left her
years ago to find work in the towns.
She might see him two or three times
a year, but the rest of their communi¬
cation is limited to messages and
letters often written by others, since
both of them may be illiterate. If she
is lucky, money may trickle back
home in small amounts for school fees
or as capital for development. Other¬
wise she must engage in farming or
business in order to keep herself and
her children fed and clothed.
The towns and mines forgot she
existed when they planned the one
room for her husband to live in, and
bath and cooking facilities to be shar¬
ed with other single men. His wage
does not take his seven children back
home into consideration. Worse still
he must have his small luxuries
alcohol and a few prostitutes.
If she is very poor her children may

not go to school. They stay at home
and help her with the work. Nowadays
many children go to school or drift
to the urban areas as soon as they are
old enough, leaving a great labour
vacuum in the rural areas. Cattle
have to be tended, the land has to be
ploughed, sowed and harvested, daily
household chores must be attended to.
This situation influenced Kenya's
Attorney General to make the follow¬
ing statement to a conference of wom¬
en in East Africa: "Although wives
have a right to be maintained by their
husbands under customary law, in
effect, the dying influence of custom¬
ary sanctions has resulted in many
abuses, whereby husbands go to work
in the towns leaving their wives in the
country without adequate provision.
This aspect must be remedied."
She is amazingly calm and hard¬
working for all her suffering, this rural
woman. Perhaps we do not take a
close enough look at her face to see
the anxiety behind her eyes and the
rapid aging of her figure. She goes
on from day to day carrying out her
duties, assuming the responsibilities
left to her by her husband. She must
protect and provide for herself and her
household. It is she who has come
to understand and accept the clear
distinction between ownership and
responsibility; not conceptually but in
practice.
As long as she has children her
plight is sealed. It would seem that
the closer the African woman is to
tradition, the more seriously she takes
her responsibility for her children.
Motherhood has a mystical slavish
influence on her. She feels she must
always be prepared to make the
ultimate sacrifice for them a feeling
not equally shared by the father.
A mother is always a child's last
resort. So that to leave her husband's
home would mean leaving her children
in the care of an equally over¬
burdened woman and an absentee
father. This would not be an especial¬
ly favourable situation for the children.
Yet to take them as dependents to her
parents, who themselves need her
help, would be unacceptable to her
22

people. So she does what is neces¬
sary to maintain her family.
This woman has a lot to teach her
urban sister who finds herself stripped
of traditional protection and barely
able to cope with her new situation.
Even if she does come to realize the
distinction between ownership and
responsibility, it is when it is too late;
after she has had a baby by someone
who admits that it is his, but will leave
the bulk of the responsibility of rearing
the child to her.
Many African countries have Affili¬
ation Acts granting the unmarried
mother rights to claim maintenance
for her child from its father, but the
amount is usually ridiculously small,
sometimes 3 dollars a month. Kenya,
in fact, repealed its Affiliation Act
in 1969.
In other cases she might marry
someone and find that full emotional
and financial support is not as forth¬
coming from him as might have been
expected. The bitterness with which
she accepts this situation shows in her
face and her manners more than in
the case of her rural sister. If she
is a working girl she can take care
of herself. But she is often still in
school and her parents have to bear
the responsibility.
Only an insignificantly small number
of African women, married or single,
are non-income producing members
of their families, whether the income
is in cash or in kind. This is linked
with tradition and with anxiety. The
tradition is that African women have
always worked. The tradition of
polygamy seems to have made it
necessary for the African woman to be
self-sufficient. The anxiety is related
to making sure that ends meet regard¬
less of the circumstances.
In traditional society the anxiety was
not as great because society had
built-in securities for its members.
In the present situation the anxieties,
especially of the urban African woman,
are tremendous. The family structure,
even though still existent, no longer
provides all the security she needs.
She is anxious about her own
support and welfare. She is anxious
about her husband's continued and
undivided affection. Ten years ago, in
Kenya Women Look Ahead (East'
African Literature Bureau, Nairobi,
1965) C. Oloo and V. Cone alluded
to the tensions the modern African
woman experiences. Today these
tensions are full blown.
Many women married to the most
responsible men will fear to praise
their husbands openly. "He is good
today," they say, "but men change,
you know." The anxieties of the
modern African woman are justified.
Men change and the African male has
undergone many changes which have
also caused him anxieties, the most
severe being that of maintaining his
¡mage as "the boss". This translates
itself into very oppressive behaviour
to both men and women.
What is the African woman doing
about her situation? The answer is
contingent upon several factors. As
has been said before, our rural sister
is more calm about her plight,
especially if she is married and
has several children. If she is un¬
married and young, the town is the
answer with its multifarious means of
"happiness", independence, and a life
which is physically less strenuous.
Even as a single girl her relationship
with men is not rosy and totally to her
advantage. She is constantly in
competition with other girls who are
In many African countries little
more than a decade after
independence, the status of
women, at least in its legal
aspects, is often more
favourable than that of their
European counterparts. In their
daily lives, however, many African
women still face discrimination.

BURDENS
OF SOLITUDE
In Africa today many village
women must look after their
homes and support their families
alone and unaided, while their
husbands are absent for months
at a time working in towns often
hundreds of kilometres away.

out to get the big spenders, the
"sugar-daddies".
If she accidentally becomes preg¬
nant and the relationship falls apart,
she must take full responsibility for the
child or leave it in the dust-bin, where
the social workers collect babies for
charitable homes.
But if she is lucky and her relation¬
ship with her man continues, the baby
will get support and she might get
her rent paid and even a car. These
girls are the envy of women generally.
Without the obligations of wifehood
they seem to be able to get exactly
what they want from men.
Men also seem to respond better to
this situation, which is free of psycho¬
logical, financial and legal complexi¬
ties. A man can step in or out of it
whenever he likes. Many single girls
and young divorcees find this a per¬
fect situation.
The older, Christian woman will take
her problems to the Lord in prayer.
After all, she reasons, the life of Christ
was a sacrificial one. So why not
hers? Without this attitude many of
our young men and women today
would be unable to boast of an
education and a family home life.
Yet this woman too, unable to leave
an oppressive situation because of her
children, will spend sleepless nights
figuring ways of stretching meagre
earnings and making the best use of
them. She has accepted the res¬
ponsibility-ownership dichotomy and
will take the responsibility.
The most- problematic case seems
to be the younger, more educated
African girl. Regardless of the advice
she receives from her elders, she
psychologically rejects the irre¬
sponsibility of her man, but not with¬
out a battle. This reformist believes in
doing something about her situation
and the battle is often fought on
many fronts psychologically, social¬
ly, financially and sometimes even
physically.
This is the girl who believes that
one's rights are not to be taken away
without a struggle. But with what
result? Often, in defeat, she resorts
to the legal system when she may
secure her divorce, only to increase
her anxieties. The care of three or
four children in a male-dominated
society is no easy task for a single
woman. Besides, society has more
sympathy with widows than with
divorcees.
If her elders prevail upon her and
she remains in the union she does so
with bitterness; a bitterness that
produces ulcers, bad headaches, de¬
pression and aggressiveness. But
this is the fighter for equal rights. Her
anxiety moves her to act. She has
fought for equal pay, paid maternity
leave, housing in her own right, the
right to own property in her own name
even if she is married.
She has succeeded in achieving
these ambitions, but none of these
have improved her relationship with
her husband. The more rights she
secures the more independent she
becomes and the more responsibility
she assumes. Unlike her lucky urban
sister with a "sugar-daddy", she finds
herself contributing more than her fair
share for family maintenance.
The situation is so prevalent, many
women wonder why it is necessary to
have a husband. Somehow the
African man does not seem to respond
well in this atmosphere. He feels
overshadowed, overpowered and hu¬
miliated.
For those who are concerned about
the family as an institution of a healthy
society, this situation in Africa war¬
rants examination from a fresh pers¬
pective. Clearly the struggle for equal
opportunities and equal rights might
be more difficult in some countries
than in others, but African women
within a decade of independence are
miles ahead of their European sisters
in their legal achievements.
In Uganda, as soon as women were
courageous enough to ask for certain
rights, by sending a delegation to the
President, everything they asked for
24

was granted. In Somalia, a pre¬
dominantly Muslim country with a
military government, women also have
been legally given equal rights. It
would seem therefore that the struggle
for more opportunities and rights for
women (the word "equal" is totally
irrelevant) is not a priority. These are
being achieved with the co-operation
of men.
The problem that warrants attention
is a clearer definition of the male role
in African society today and this
needs to be done in conjunction with
a definition of the female role. Our
men are having just as many problems
adjusting to the changing circums¬
tances of society.
The struggle for more opportunities
for women will solve other problems
in society but not the problem of the
male-female relationship, which is a
human relations problem, and these
are seldom solved by laws.
The prevalent attitude of most men
towards their present situation was
well expressed by one African leader
in a speech to a women's seminar.
He said, "The wife is responsible for
peace and stability in the home. She
must create a safe and steady base
which would encourage her husband
to succeed in the world of business
or employment. This attitude on the
part of women would reduce heavy
drinking and road accidents and would
induce husbands and children to stay
at home." This statement may be
interpreted in many ways, but it must
never be mistaken for anything other
than what it really isa cry for help.
A statement of this nature shows
a strong unwillingness to take res¬
ponsibility for one's own behaviour.
In effect it says, "My role is to succeed
in employment and business, but you
too must get a job or go into business
because I cannot do it alone. And if
I fail, it is really your fault because
you have made conditions at home
so unpleasant for me. You must also
always be prepared to cover the
tracks of my failure by keeping a smil¬
ing face and an appearance of finan¬
cial and psychological well-being re¬
gardless of what I do." The woman,
therefore, becomes the scapegoat for
all his failures, and not being fully
aware of her situation, she fights for
equal rights and thereby becomes a
better scapegoat.
The African woman today must get
rid of this man-child on her back. This
is the responsibility, the burden.
Equal rights will not rid her of this
burden. She must help her man to
stand on his feet and discover his role
in a relationship of equal responsi¬
bility.
The mechanics of how the role of
men will be defined and how men will
become committed to a more re
sponsible role in their relationship
with women is what requires public
discussion and public concern. At
present our men find their profession,
time spent in bars, and other non¬
productive behaviour useful facades
for their problems.
The task therefore that must begin
in 1975, declared "International
Women's Year" by the United Nations,
is the task of helping our men on the
African continent to define their role
in a meaningful relationship with
women. The training of our sons, an
opportunity often forgotten, is an area
of great potential. As for our hus¬
bands and fathers of our children,
the battle seems impossible, but to
win it would certainly be worth the
effort.
