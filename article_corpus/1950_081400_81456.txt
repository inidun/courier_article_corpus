OUTPOSTS IN A FIGHT AGAINST DESPAIR.
SCHOOL NUCLEI BRING NEW HOPE
of the Inca empire are only
THE town of Cuzco, perched on a high plateau of theAndes, still contains vestiges of the empire of the
Incas, whose capital it was. All round the town the
ruins of temples bear witness to the lost civilization.
Other remains, less spectacular, but perhaps more signi-
ficant, such as planted terraces on the mountainsides and
irrigation installations, show the high degree of accom-
plishment which it reached.
On these now desolate mountain heights live the
descendants of the Incas. Comprising 46% of the popu-
lation of Peru, they are therefore an important ethnic
group.
But the wealth and glory
a memory. The descendants
of the Incas live in direst
poverty. Mostly illiterate,
they lack even the most
elementary knowledge. They
have forgotten the arts of
their ancestors and have
not acquired the modern
techniques that might help
them live decently. Their
helplessness and resignation
present many problems in
addition to that of restoring
dignity and self-respect.
For example, despite the
fact that 64 per cent of the
whole population of Peru
works in agriculture, the
country has to import the
greater part of its food
supply.
The bad conditions in
way of life. Each nucleus
has, besides its Director, a
team of educators special-
ized in various subjects :
agricultural techniques and
the conservation of the soil,
health and hygiene, the
Spanish language.
Teachers Have Twin
Tasks
THESE specialists aretrained at seminars
organized jointly by the
Bolivian and Peruvian Go-
vernments with the help of
the Inter-American Co-
operative Service for the
Production of Foodstuffs.
Their first task is the actual
construction of the"school
nuclei", built in the local
style, with thatched roofs,
letting in plenty of light and
aim. Besides teaching duties,
each member of the team is
responsible for looking after
all the school buildings in
the area in which the"nu-
cleus"has been set up. He
has, indeed, not only to
look after them but also, if
possible, to improve them.
Obviously, the education
of the children cannot of
itself suffice to change the
living conditions of so many
people. Adult education is
therefore an important fac-
tor in the task or the
"school nuclei". The teach-
ers attached to them can
undertake to impart know-
ledge of such matters as soil
conservation, agricultural
techniques and domestic
training.
An Escape From
Misery
IT is difficult to giveinstruction in hygiene to
people who, rather than call
a doctor or allow themsel-
ves be vaccinated, prefer
to call medicine men. In
any case, the proportion of
doctors in the Cuzco district
is one to 40, 000 inhabitants.
Nevertheless in Bolivia
and Peru, the new"` schools
nuclei"will soon give the
Indians a chance to escape
from the misery to which
history reduced them cen-
turies ago. It is hoped that
this work will result not
only in increased agricultu-
ral production and an im-
proved standard of living,
but also in closer relations
between the two main
groups of the population.
"Othet remains, perhaps more significant. such as planted terraces on
the mountainsides and irrigation installations, show the high degree 01
accomplishment reached by the Inca civilization."The Incas built beau-
tüul cities, like hanging gardens on the craggy summits 01 the Andes,
such as Machupicchu, whose terraces and ruined fortress are shown in
this photo. Today, the governments be Peru and Bolivia are helping the
descendants 01 the Incas to escape from the misery to which history
reduced them centuries ago.
which a great many South
American Indians now live
result from historical cir-
cumstances no longer oper-
ative. The achievements of
their ancestors are proof of
the gifts and capabilities of
the race. There is. the
greatest promise, therefore,
in helping to develop their
capabilities. The first step
is to educate them ; to
teach them to read, to culti-
vate their land and to care
for themselves.
Joint Attack On
Ignorance
m particularly inte-
resting experiment of
this kind has been
undertaken by Peru and
Bolivia. Faced with similar
problems, the two countries
decided to solve them by
joint action. The Ministries
of Education, Social Affairs
and Agriculture of both
countries have, with the
help of the Inter-American
Co-operative Service for
Food Production, drawn up
a fundamental education
programme which already
has some achievements to
its credit.
The first problem was
how to improve the school
system. In some parts of
Peru, such as Cuzco, for
instance, 88 per cent. of the
children do not go to school.
The primary reason is that
communities are widely
scattered and means of
communication s c a r c e.
Defects in the organization
of the school system aggra-
vate the situation : a lack
of school buildings, and of
amenities in such buildings
as do exist, and faulty
training of teachers. Most
of the teaching is in
Spanish, but the Indian
children speak only their
own languages-Quecha
and Aimara.
The first and most im-
portant step taken at the
beginning of the campaign
was the establishment of
"school nuclei". These are
staffed by specially trained
teachers who speak the
languages of the Indians
and are familiar with their
