THE PRECOGNITION OF MAN'S
ECONOM) C RtGHTS
by Gunnar Myrdal
Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe
IN modern legal and sociolog-
. ical doctrine, it is generally
acknowledged that declar-
ations of those rights which,
following on habeas corpus, were
evolved by the revolutionary
thinking of the eighteenth cen-
tury, are not in themselves enough
to secure respect for the liberties
of the individual ; if they are to
have any real meaning, the
proclamation of constitutional
liberties must be backed by
recognition of the economic rights
which it is the duty of any
society to guarantee to its citizens.
No one would seriously ques-
tion today, for example, that
freedom in law and freedoms
from governmental or administ-
rative tyranny cannot be regarded
as man's greatest good if the vast
majority of citizens, while having
such freedom, are allowed to die
from starvation.
Today we believe that constitu-
tional and legal liberties should
be combined with the right of
every citizen to look to the society
of which he is a member for the
satisfaction, through its economic
and social organization, of his
vital needs in the cultural,
economic and social spheres.
The development of theory in
this respect has had a profound
effect on practice. The most
recent constitutions containing a
declaration of human rights
include, in addition to the classic
freedoms, a number of clauses
setting forth the right of the
individual to a decent standard
of living, to work and to social
security.
FAITH PLUS ACTION
THE Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, proclaimed
by the General Assembly
of the United Nations, follows
the same course. Its Articles
22 to 25 give international re-
cognition to a series of prin-
ciples providing a basis for
the"realization, through national
effort and international cooper-
ation, and in accordance with the
organization and resources of
each State, of the economic,
social and cultural rights in-
dispensable for the dignity (of
every individual as a member of
society) and the free development
of his personality." (Article 22.)
It may be wondered whether
the list of economic rights on
which the attainment of these
aims depends, given in the above-
mentioned Articles of the Uni-
versal Declaration, should not be
fuller. In any case, it must be
admitted that the very fact of
including economic rights in the
Declaration contributes to the
credit of the United Nations in
their unstinted endeavours in this
field.
But these efforts must go
further. It is not enough to
proclaim the common faith of
the Members of the United
Nations in the validity of the
rights. set forth in the. necJrti : :.'n ;
all governments must take steps,
in the words of the Preamble to
the Declaration, to secure their
universal and effective recogni-
tion and observance, both among
their own peoples and among
those of territories under their
jurisdiction.
The importance of this question
of the effective observance of
Human Rights has been fully
recognized by the United Nations.
But, while observance of the
succeed
in their
efforts to
bring
about
such im-
provements
in organi-
zation and
the use of
resour-
c e s will
determine their ability to enforce
observance of the principles they
have acknowledged in those Ar-
ticles of the Universal Declara-
tion which refer to the economic
rights of men and women.
All the efforts of the subsidiary
bodies of the United Nations in
economic and social affairs are
more or less directly connected
with the pursuit of this long-
term aim-the recognition and
observance of man's economic
rights. This is the purpose of
the work the International Labour
Organization has been doing for
the past thirty years to promote
social legislation in the different
countries of the world and to
ARTICLE 22. Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social
security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and inter-
national co-operation and in accordance with the organization and
resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights
indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.
traditionally conceived civic
liberties can be secured by evolv-
ing a procedure for international
supervision of the way in which
each of the Member countries
is carrying out the principles
embodied in the Universal
Declaration, far more construc-
tive action has to be taken if we
are to bring about the effective
recognition of economic rights.
When the United Nations
specified, in Article 22 of the
Declaration, that the realization
of economic rights should be
achieved in accordance with the
organization and resources of
each country, they were not
simply stating a truism ; they
were indicating clearly that, if
the proclamation of those rights
in the Declaration is to have any
force, it is essential to perfect
the organization and develop
the economic resources of the
Member States. The extent to
which the United Nations
bring these laws into line with
one another. The Economic and
Social Council has the same end
in view when it seeks for
practical measures to secure full
employment or when, in consult-
ation with the various Specialized
Agencies, it studies ways of
financing economic and social
progress in under-developed
areas. And, lastly, the regional
economic commissions, jointly
or individually, are likewise
pursuing the same aim in seeking,
in agreement with Member
Governments, means to increase
production in each of the coun-
tries concerned, to expand con-
sumption, and to organize in-
ternational trade between them.
These various undertakings
are not all at the same stage of
development. Some of them, like
those of the International Labour
Organization, already have a long
list of achievements to their
credit. Others, such as those of
the regional Economic Com-
missions, though still in their
early stages, are likely, because
of the daily contacts that are
possible between the Commis-
sions and the governments con-
cerned, to produce tangible results
in the near future.
ECONOMIC CHARTER
OUR efforts to bring about theeconomic and social reha-
bilitation of the under-
developed countries, which are
planned on a wider scale and
faced with far more serious
practical difficulties, will certain-
ly take much longer. But the
results it is possible to achieve
in this sphere, thanks to the
readiness of governments to co-
operate, will have even greater
meaning for the future of the
world.
There is, however, this in
common between all the efforts I
have described : when practical
difficulties are encountered, or if
some governments decline to
play their part in international
economic co-operation, it is now
possible, since the adoption of
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights by the General
Assembly, to remind them that
effective co-operation in the effort
to find ways of raising the
standard of the world's economy
follows naturally from the prin-
ciples set forth in Articles 22 to
25 of the Declaration.
The Declaration may therefore
be regarded as a real charter of
international co-operation in
economic matters or, at all
events, as an invitation to the
governments which are Members
of the United Nations to take
effective action to implement the
principles they have formally
approved. This is surely a feature
to which attention may well be
drawn on this third anniversary
of the Universal Declaration.
