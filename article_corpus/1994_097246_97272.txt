Coral reefs are one ofthe won¬
ders of the world. And one of
its most useful. This is how
Professor Jean Jaubert,
director ofthe European Oceanolog-
ical Observatory (l'Observatoire
Océanologique Européen) at the
Monaco Museum, sees them: "Coral
reefs are the marine equivalent of
primeval forests and, as home to an
exceptionally dense and diversified
plant and animal life, help to main¬
tain the major balances of the
planet." Roughly 400 million years
ago they existed in almost every
ocean. Today they form the coast¬
lines of 105 (for the most part devel¬
oping) countries and reefs extending
from the surface down to 30 metres
cover some 600,000 km2.

They are mostly found in the
world's warm and temperate waters,
in the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean,
Polynesia, Australia, usually on the
eastern sides of continents which
protect them from the prevailing
west winds. There are three main
types of coral reef: fringing reefs,
near coasts; barrier reefs, separated
from the coast by a deep lagoon,
the best known example being

Australia's Great Barrier Reef; and
atolls, rings ofreefs around lagoons,
a typical configuration of many
Pacific islands and the kind ofthing
holidaymakers dream of. As well as
being beautiful, coral is also an indi¬
cator ofmarine pollution and vari¬
ations in global climate. Scientists
have noticed that, just as the age of
a tree can be read in the concentric
circles ofa crosscut, coral shows its
age in its skeleton and also the
traces of any aggression ofwhich it
may have been a victim over the
years.
ANIMAL, VEGETABLE
OR MINERAL?
For many years researchers were
stumped as to whether coral was
animal, vegetable or mineral. The
mysterywas solved in the mid-eigh¬
teenth century by a French surgeon,
Jean-André Peysonnel, and an Eng¬
lishman, John Ellis, who declared
coral to be animal! Behind a rock¬
like appearance conferred by its
aragonite skeletons are hidden car¬
nivorous polyps of the coelenterate
taxon (in Greek, coelenteronmeans
"hollow tube"). There are from 2,500
to 2,600 species (not counting soft
corals without skeletons), 700 of
which are found in the Indo-Pacific
region alone.
Corals are small animals about a
centimetre long, consisting of a
cylindrical digestive tube with a
mouth at one end surrounded by
tentacles armed with stinging cells
for capturing plankton. During the
day these tentacles are folded inside
the digestive sac. Like the big car¬
nivores, they only hunt at night,
feeding on plankton, small shell¬
fish and larvae. They evacuate cal¬
cium carbonate which enables
them to produce the outer skeleton
within which they shelter. They live
symbiotically with microscopic
single-celled algae known as zoox-
anthellae, that lodge in their tissue
(up to 7,000 algae per mm2). The
algae process the nitrates, phos¬
phates and carbon dioxide (CO2)
produced in the coral polyp. As a
result of photosynthesis, which is
only possible as far down as sun¬
light can penetrate, i.e. some 50
metres, they generate oxygen and
organic compounds which the
polyps can use. They may also help
the polyp lay down calcium car¬
bonate. Thanks to its algae, living
coral is rainbow-coloured, yellow,
blue, purple, orange, brown or even
fluorescent (it should not be con¬
fused with red coral, used in jew¬
ellery, which is not within the scope
of this article). When the symbiotic
algae leave it, the coral dies and goes
white.
More than a century ago Charles
Darwin wondered why the Pacific
Ocean is almost a desert although
its atolls are luxuriant "oases" where
coral and fish abound. In 1974 three
oceanographers, Yves Magnier,
François Rougerie and Bruno
Wauthy working on behalf of the
French Polynesian Fisheries Service
under the aegis of Unesco's Man
and the Biosphere Programme
(MAB), studied the physical-chem¬
ical balance of the Takapoto atoll
lagoon in the Tuamotu Islands. The
food that sustained life in the lagoon
clearly came from deep water. But
how, since the deep water is cold
and does not mix with the warm
surface water? The three researchers
made the brilliant discovery that
the atoll works like an oil lamp. The
water warms up as it occupies the
reef's porous base (the wick),
causing nutrient salts (the fuel) to
rise with the warmer water towards
the surface where they are con¬
sumed (the flame). The phenom¬
enon was given the name geot-
hermal endo-upwelling and is now
gaining ground in the scientific
community.

(Baja California,
Mexico).
If they are well fed, the polyps
reproduce in two ways. In a single
night shortly after the full moon, the
polyps (which are both male and
female) spew out a cloud of sper¬
matozoa and ova that unite and give
birth to thousands of small larvae,
planula, which, if they are lucky
enough to escape their predators,
attach themselves to rocks. When
the polyp is firmly ensconced, it can
also reproduce asexually by simply
splitting. If it is to prosper, the polyp
must not be subjected to stress.
What it likes is warmth, between 25
and 29°C, but in the Gulf it may sup-
Û
port variations between 14 and 35 C.
It needs clear, salty, highly oxy¬
genated sunlit water. It detests sand
clouds that suffocate it, pesticides
and fertilizers leached by rain
through deforestation, oil, parrot-
fish that nibble its dps and, above all,
human beings who walk on it and
break off its branches for souvenirs.
Although tourism provides
income, the care that the Aus¬
tralians take of the 2,300 kilometres
and the 400,000 km2 of the Great
Barrier Reef should be emulated,
i.e. divers and pleasure boats should
be strictly monitored. But for poor
countries this is easier said than
done.
STRIKING REGENERATIVE POWERS
However, some optimistic news has
reached us from Unesco's Regional
Office in Jakarta, where Robin
Harger, a coral specialist, notes the
striking regenerative powers ofcoral
reefs. He challenges the accuracy
of a map but only the map that
has appeared in a booklet entitled
Reefs at Risk (see further reading
below). In an area of eastern
Indonesia where the map indicates
reefs with a life-expectancy of 10-20
years, he notes 80%-90% coral cover
in a reef in Banda Island that had
been badly damaged by lava flows.
He describes the reef in question as
"absolutely spectacular" with
"humphead parrotfish half the size
of a Volkswagen Beetle". His many
dives around the world enable him
to judge that this ecosystem is in
good health. To say that the reefs
are in a critical condition is to strike
a blow at eco-tourism, "which is
considered as a potential element of
economic salvation."
Coral reefs deserve respect
because they protect coasts and
mangroves from battering by waves
and provide a home for countless
fish and shellfish species. And yet for
centuries in islands like the Mal¬
dives itwas traditional practice, now
prohibited, to extract blocks ofcoral
for building temples and monas¬
teries, so that the fish virtually dis¬
appeared. In the Philippines fishing
with dynamite, although officially

banned, is still practised, and more
generally, the often-criticized cap¬
ture ofexotic fish and the removal of
living coral for European and North
American aquariums are only mar¬
ginal activities.
HEAT WAVE
Another, more serious, threat to
coral is posed by the earth's
changing climate. Some scientists
claim that by the middle of next
century the amount of CO2 in the
earth's atmosphere will have dou¬
bled, there will be a general rise in
temperature, and climatic variation
will be greater than it has been in
the past 6,000 years. What effects
would this have on coral reefs and
the creatures that depend on them
for their survival?
A Global Task Team of experts
sponsored by the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP),
Unesco's Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission and the Asso¬
ciation of the South Pacific Environ
mental Institutions (ASPEI), in col¬
laboration with the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization (WMO) and
the World Conservation Union
(IUCN), asserts that people repre¬
sent the greatest threat to coral reefs.
Because of the constandy increasing
emissions ofgreenhouse gases and
gases that destroy the ozone layer,
we can expect: a rise in air and sea-
surface temperatures; changes in
weather patterns; more frequent
storms, droughts and floods; pos¬
sible alterations in ocean currents
and in the chemical composition
of sea water due to higher concen¬
trations of CO2. The hole in the
ozone layer again comes into it:
coral larvae have a very low toler¬
ance to ultra-violet rays. Freshwater
run-off, loaded with dissolved nutri¬
ents, promotes the development of
phytoplankton, the favourite food of
the larvae ofAcanthaster, an enor¬
mous starfish measuring 60 cen¬
timetres in diameter that can dev¬
astate coral reefs. It extracts its
stomach from its body and attaches
it to the rock, devouring and
digesting all the coral's living matter.
One of the most controversial
human activities in the Pacific
region is French nuclear testing on
the Mururoa Atoll. Yet some scien¬
tists are happy about this because
when testing takes place vertical
soundings to a depth of 1,200
metres and oblique soundings
towards the ocean have made it
possible to study the terrain ofvol¬
canic origin that constitutes the
base and sides of the atoll. Subsi¬
dence after the explosions has also
enabled scientists to study the
impact of the rise in sea-level on
this kind of island.
WHITE DEATH
In April 1991 and again recently
Polynesian fishermen and divers
observed a strange phenomenon
that intrigues researchers. The reefs
seemed to "flower" in gorgeous, flu¬
orescent colours or else to become
totally white. The eight high islands

in the Society archipelago were
affected. Was the coral being deci¬
mated by the few degrees' rise in
the global temperature? According
to the findings of three tropical
oceanographers, Francis Rougerie,
Bernard Salvat and Miri Tatarata-
Couraud, "bleaching" seems to be
the result of a combination of fac¬
tors: "a heat wave in the tropical
ocean combined with an accentua¬
tion of the greenhouse effect, an
overdose of ultra-violet rays con¬
nected with the reduction of the
ozone layer, a shortage of nutrient
salts, disease or oxygen intoxication".
They conclude that "Whatever the
real cause, the threat to the algae-
coral ecosystem is serious and could
be linked to human activities. Are
we witnessing a veritable eco-geno-
cide?" Fortunately, according to Pro¬
fessor Jean Jaubert, the phenom¬
enon is not irreversible and under
certain conditions the symbiotic
algae return to the coral, and they
start life over again together.
The increase in CO2 for which
we are directly responsible now
exceeds the absorbent capacity of
the plant-life that feeds on it, espe¬
cially since we continue to destroy
forests. Yet it is probable that even if
the world were completely
replanted there would not be
enough vegetation to absorb the
751 gigatons of CO2 present in the
atmosphere. Can coral reefs help
us to get rid of it? "Although they
consume CO2 to make their skele¬
tons," Jean Jaubert remarks, "they
actually release more than they
absorb, i.e. about 2 per cent of the
CO2 released by human beings, but
that is a normal figure for the inter-
glacial period we are living in."
Even if they do not get rid of CO2
for us, corals deserve our fullest
attention. They are food-stores,
assuring the survival of all those
who live by fishing on the many
islands surrounded by reefs. The
Monaco Scientific Centre is at pre¬
sent the only place where coral is
grown in laboratory conditions.
Their oldest specimen is 16 years
old. "We take cuttings from it, and
they become our laboratory mice
for experimentation. So we don't
have to take samples from reefs. We
have a kind of nursery of seedlings
ready to help restore reefs that are in
bad shape!"
