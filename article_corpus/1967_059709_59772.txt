I the Mediterranean, until 
about 1500 the galley with one bank 
of oars was supreme both as man- 
of-war and as merchant ship. Oars 
were steadily increased in length, even 
to fifty feet. Reaching inboard for 
one third of their length, they were

manipulated by as many as seven

The steering oar early gave way to 
the rudder, and man power was sup- 
plemented by masts and sails. The 
Venetians and the Genoese used huge 
galleys equipped with both oars and 
sails, called galleasses, and slow 
freighters (naves or carracks) of as 
much as six-hundred tons’ burden. In 
1571, at the Battle of Lepanto, the 
Christian armada included six galleas- 
From ancient times a Mediterranean vessel par excellence, the galley, propelled 
mostly be oars but also fitted with sails, remained in use until the end of the 
17th century. Some were of as much as 600 tons burden and had 30 oars 
on each side. Detail of engraving shows galleys from a 16th century fleet.

ses and over two hundred galleys, to 
say nothing of smaller auxiliary craft. 
Lepanto was the last significant naval 
battle in which the galley was consider- 
ed the decisive vessel, although it con- 
tinued to be used for more than a 
century. 
Meanwhile the sailing vessel had 
come into its own, especially on the 
Atlantic. The stern-post rudder, which 
permitted more rapid steering, had 
probably been known to the Chinese

In 1681, the Languedoc Canal 
(241 kilometres, 150 miles; 
119 locks) was opened in France, 
connecting the Rhone and the 
Garonne Rivers, An engineering

hazardous trip via the straits 
of Gibraltar. Right, drawing by

in the eighth century, to the Byzan- 
tines in the twelfth, and in Poland in 
the thirteenth. It was fully developed 
in fourteenth-century Byzantine ves- 
sels. The fleet which the English king 
Henry V assembled for the invasion 
of France in 1413 included cogs, car- 
racks, barges, and balingers, mostly 
of about five-hundred tons’ burden, 
the best known being the blunt, broad, 
slow-going cogs of northwestern 
Europe. 
Meanwhile the Portuguese and the 
Spanish were developing the caravel, 
a small, broad, high-pooped, lateen- 
sailed, vessel for ocean travel. This 
was the type of ship used by Vasco de 
Gama and Columbus. Columbus’ Santa 
Maria was of only a little over two 
hundred tons. By this time rigging 
had improved; three-masted vessels 
with bowsprits were common from the 
fifteenth century on and with two 
masts square-rigged and one lateen 
rigged, navigators could beat “up the 
wind.” 
S... the winds over the 
Atlantic rarely die down completely, 
nations with Atlantic outlets were able 
to abandon the clumsy oar-driven 
galley in favour of more maneuvrable 
sailing vessels. The Great Armada 
(1588), with only four galleasses and 
four galleys but around one hundred 
and thirty sailing vessels (the largest 
of thirteen hundred tons), exemplifies 
the replacement of the galley by the 
Atlantic type of shipping. 
Improved navigational methods and 
larger freighters permitted freer travel 
on the open ocean, and longer sailings 
eliminated many trans-shipments. 
In addition to the well-known all- 
water route between the North Sea and 
Venice or Genoa via Gibraltar, the 
Dutch and the Germans were able to 
maintain a continuous sea-route be- 
tween the Netherlands and the Baltic 
ports. The explorations of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries gave still an- 
other impetus to water transportation. 
Not only did the growing commerce 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
                         
  
      
  
  
   
       
  
  
    
with the nascent colonies and the 
Far East augment the demands on 
shipping but also intra-European com- 
munications grew because of increas- 
ed traffic in exotic products. . . 
In the seventeenth century, though 
the Dutch had to import most of their 
shipbuilding materials, they were per- 
haps the leading shipbuilders and 
marine carriers of Europe. Pieter J. 
Livorn invented (1595) a type of vessel 
(called in Dutch the fluitschip and in 
English the flute) of slender design, 
light weight, and shallow draft that 
was faster and cheaper to build and 
to run than earlier types. . . 
The Dutch fishing vessels (busses) 
had long excelled in the North Sea 
fisheries, Dutch broad and flat-bottom-

cabotage, and Dutch whalers domi-

through shallow canals. And Drebbel 
built a submarine that in 1620 was 
rowed below the surface of the Thames 
for several hours. . . 
Several improvements in location- 
finding and hygiene facilitated lengthy 
voyages for Dutch and other Euro- 
pean crews. To the magnetic compass, 
known to navigators for several cen- 
turies, was added the telescope, which 
in the seventeenth century was quickly 
adapted to navigation, and finally, in 
the eighteenth century the ship's chro- 
nometer. The planting of vegetable 
gardens at ports of call helped to 
counteract the heavy toll of scurvy.
