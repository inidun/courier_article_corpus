Learning Hebrew Ethiopian-style
In Israel, thousands of Ethiopian immigrants are learning to read and write for the first time. They
begin not with their native Amharic but Hebrew 
o u ’ve got to make it “ r e l e v a n t ,” insists Meir
P e r e t z , the Israeli Education
Ministry official in charge of adult
e d u c a t i o n , in explaining a new approach to
t e a c h Hebrew to thousands of illiterate
Ethiopian immigrants.
Since the early 1980’s, Israel has
brought in tens of thousands of Jews from
E t h i o p i a , including two spectacular airlifts.
More than 40,000 arrived in the 1990s and
about 100 immigrants continue to trickle in
each week.
The government earmarks about $30
million a year to teaching all immigrants
H e b r e w, according to Peretz. With the
Ethiopians it’s not an easy job, since as
many as 90 percent cannot read or write in
their native tongue, A m h a r i c. The scale
and scope of the project is unprecedented
i n t e r n a t i o n a l l y,whereby “a group of mostly
illiterate people is simultaneously trying to
learn to read, write and converse in a
foreign language,” says Peretz.
Peretz realized several years ago that
rote learning of vocabulary and grammar
simply didn’t work with most Ethiopian
adults enrolled in the compulsory
10 months of government-funded classes,
keeping many from joining the workforce
and blending into Israeli society.
Peer learning
A major obstacle is the huge cultural
difference between the rural lifestyle led by
most of the Ethiopians and the customs of
their adoptive Western country, P e r e t z
s a y s.“If I’m speaking with a native English-
s p e a k e r, and he doesn’t know what the
Hebrew word is for glasses, then I can say
what the word is. When a person doesn’t
even know what glasses are, then I have a
cultural problem.”
Peretz has sought to address this
problem by putting A m h a r i c - s p e a k i n g
veteran immigrants, like Isayas Hawaz,
into the classroom for at least a quarter of
the 25-hour a week lessons. H a w a z , 2 5 ,
immigrated four years ago and now helps
teachers translate their lessons into
Amharic at an absorption center in
Mevassaret Zion, a suburb of Jerusalem.
Hawaz said Peretz’s method made all the
difference for him when he was learning
H e b r e w. “At fir s t , I wanted to run away
from class, I couldn’t make any sense of the
alphabet lessons we were getting. My self-
c o n fidence plummeted. Then when they
[older Ethiopians] started translating, i t
all made sense,” says Hawaz.
A temple lesson
P e r e t z ’s curriculum also seeks to pique
pupils’ interest by peppering language
lessons with discussions of current events or
cultural issues.“It is not a good idea to wait
until someone knows Hebrew to explain
what is happening in the country,” he says.
On a hot July afternoon at the
Mevasseret centre , teacher Rina Rosler
discusses Tisha Be’Av, a recent Jewish day
of fasting marking the anniversary of the
destruction of the second holy temple in
the Roman period.She reads her pupils a
legend about the origin of the first temple
which recounts that God chose the site
because two quarreling brothers embraced
there. She writes the key verbs in Hebrew
on the blackboard and asks students for
translations in A m h a r i c.“ The temple could
only be built at a site where?” she asks.
“...Where there is love,” answers Sana’it
Farada,20,a newcomer from the Gondar
region of Ethiopia.
Yet today that site is the scene of
frequent Israeli-Palestinian violence.Wh i l e
the intifada didn’t come up directly, t h e
relevancy of the discussion wasn’t lost on
at least some of the 14 pupils. After class,
teenager Mandefo Mengistu remarks in
Hebrew that “the recent bomb attacks are
not good.”While beaming with confid e n c e,
M e n g i s t u ’s grasp of the language is
e x c e p t i o n a l . Noa Navot, director of the
Mevasseret classes, estimates that only half
of the pupils with previous education in
Ethiopia end up learning enough Hebrew
to land a job. Navot feels the classes should
be extended.“If you plant the seeds and
don’t bother to water them, they just go
dry,” she says.
Yet according to Peretz, very few
immigrants have asked for extended
c o u r s e s.There is, h o w e v e r, growing interest
in a new project to mix language
instruction with vocational training. In the
end, says Peretz,patience is required on
both sides. ■
