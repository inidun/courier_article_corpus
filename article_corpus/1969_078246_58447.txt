THE MENACE
OF 'EXTINCT'
VOLCANOES
I have gradually become convinced of something that laymen and even professional
geologists and volcanologists usually Ignore and it fills me with dread the prospect,
some day soon, of unheard-of volcanic catastrophes. Geological evidence has finally
convinced me that humanity has so far been fantastically lucky, and the catastrophes
of Pompeii and St. Pierre de la Martinique are nothing to what awaits us. These were
small towns compared with the enormous modern cities threatened at closer or longer
range by a volcanic outburst Naples and Rome, Portland and Seattle, Mexico City,
Bandung, Sapporo, Oakland, Catania, Clermont-Ferrand... I Volcanoes regarded as totally
extinct near these cities are dead only to eyes that cannot or will not see. A volcano
may be less than a century dormant and people almost cease altogether to think of it
as such. But volcanoes are geologically live; time for them is counted not in years or
even in centuries, but in millennia and tens of millennia.
Centuries, hundreds of centuries might pass and Clermont-Ferrand, Rome or Seattle
not be wiped out. But the interval might be much less...
