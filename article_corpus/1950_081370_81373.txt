ART TREASURES OF
MEDIAEVAL YUGOSLAVIA
WOMAN WITH THE AMPHORA (Church of the Holy Apostles. Petch
monastery).-1 A Serbian artist of the early l3th Century painted this
fresco. He attempted to solve a 3 dimensional geometrical problem
in terms of 2 dimensional art. Contemporary cubists set the same
problem and solved it in a manner which is strangely similar to the
technique of the 13th Century artist.
IT is 80 years since Japanese paintings were first exhib-
t ited in European museums and art galleries and
some 30 years since the Negro art of Africa first
became widely known in Europe through the same means.
Probably as important in its own way as these two
earlier events was the exhibition of Yugoslav Mediaeval
Art held at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris last month.
realistic drawing of the
features, sometimes carried to
caricature, the almost impress-
ionistic touches, with the flat
and heavy painting of the
hair and deliberate distortion
of the limbs.
It is easy to see why differ-
ent schools of archaeology
have often advanced conflict-
ing theories to explain the
originality of this painting.
The same applies, however, to
Yugoslav architecture and
sculpture, represented in the
Paris exhibition by some very
beautiful casts.
It is understandable too
that at one time at least, this
sculpture and architecture
were regarded simply as off-
shoots of the basilicas of Lom-
bardy.
But architecture and sculp-
ture do not develop for
eight centuries without being
decisively influenced by men-
in this case by the Slav
carvers and masons.
Although not likely to bring
about a revolution in art
these treasures of mediaeval
Yugoslavia lifted the curtain
hiding a fascinating civiliz-
ation, which since the eleventh
century has produced a great
number of masterpieces hith-
erto. insufficiently appreciated.
Most critics and archaeo-
logists, loath to leave the well-
trodden highways of art
history, have neglected these
works of art, and they have
thus remained practically
unknown to the general public
who, for the last twenty years
have learned to familiarize
themselves more with primitive
cave paintings than with
mediaeval frescos.
In Yugoslavia, however, such
frescos now receive their full
share of appreciation, and the
reproductions brought to Paris
through the"Association
Fran√ßaise d'Action Artistique"
and a Yugoslav organizing
committee explain why.
These striking reproductions
demonstrate the vitality of
Yugoslav art, which, influenced
by two often very different
worlds, has evolved original
and individual forms.
What is the reason for the
In this are the decorative
themes in particular seem
to be entirely original, as
if the southern Slavs had
found their most individual
form of expression in the
carving of doorways and
capitals and in the famous
"trellis-work"of friezes and
tympana.
When they adopted Christ-
ianity, they kept their own
language, songs and customs,
and they also preserved their
forms of ornamentation ; the
designs with which the stones
of their buildings are so pro-
fusely carved-transposed
perhaps from more primitive
work in wood-are closely
akin to those still found in
Serbian lace-work, pottery and
textiles.
One of the strangest, even
disturbing things revealed by
the Paris exhibition is Bogo-
mile sculpture.
More than thirty thousand
examples of this sculpture-
striking originality of these
paintings ? Even allowing for
the influence, both technical
and intellectual, of Byzantium
and Ravenna and, perhaps, of
Hellenic survivals, one has
only to look at the Descent
from the Cross in the Mo-
nastery of Milicheva and
especially the extraordinary
Sopotchani Dormition, to rea-
lize that those infiuences
alone cannot explain the
essence of this art.
THE"SCHISM IN ART"
THE fact is that the samecircumstances which fro
the twelfth to the four-
teenth century made it pos-
sible for the southern Slavs
to retain their ecclesiastical
and political independence ;
also account for the free
flowering of their art. This
sudden upsurge of a form
of painting, which included
psychological portraiture and
showed the utmost daring in
the use of colour, has been
called the"schism in art".
There is in fact a great
difference between the art of
Rome or Byzantium and this

carved monoliths, pillars, stelae
and sarcophagi-are fouh5 in
the mountain burial places of
BOSilia and Herzegovina. In
the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries-until the Turkish
occupation-a persecuted
people raied these monuments
of their faith. Their part of
the country was one of the
last strongholds of a little
known religion in which, from
the Nile to the Altai mount-

with an admixture of Christ-
ianity, were combined with
the older tribal myths of the
converts. 
MYSTERIOUS SYMBOLS
CUToff in their naturalstronghold, the Bogo-
miles and Patarini es-
caped the bloodbath in which
their kinsfolk, the Cathari of
Languedoc, perished. These
bas-reliefs, in which"old Slav"
themes are associated with
mysterious symbols, are all
that remain of their civiliz-
ation and tenets.
In one instance, a knight is
shown stretched bareheaded
on the Cross. More often,
clad in armour, the dead man
is depicted with his right hand
raised, disproportionate in size
and surmounted by a sun and
with a bow and arrow carved
at his left.
Tournaments ajid battles,
hunting scene, stylized pic-
tures of the Kolo, national
dance of Yugoslavia, horses
and stages reminiscent of the
primitive magical cave paint-
ings, all bear witness to the
fertile tenacity of a people
who loved and clung to their
past. their native soil and
their church.
To appreciate the signific-
ance of the exhibition one has
only to remember that Europe
has had to wait five hundred
years before discovering this
highly original art ; that it
became familiar with the
sculpture of Easter Island
before it first saw that of
Bosnia, and that about 1900,
critics used to treat the Yugo-
slav frescos as clumsy imit-
ations of Italian painting and
spoke of the BOgIJmile monu-
ments as the crude products of
a barbarian imagination.
While the authors of the
Exhibition catalogue write that
their national art is"becoming
a cultural legacy enjoyed by
all Yugoslavs", their work
itself proves that this newly
revealed art is also destined
to enrich and inspire many
other countries.
