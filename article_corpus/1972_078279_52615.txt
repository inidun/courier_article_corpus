HIS issue is
devoted to a question which
has aroused passionate ar¬
gument and debate for many
years: The Origin of Man.
Recent research has provi¬
ded new answers to many
puzzling aspects of this
question. A few years ago,
Unesco convened an inter¬
national symposium on the
subject in collaboration with
the International Union for
Quaternary Research. The
proceedings have now been
published under the title
"The Origin of Homo sap¬
iens", produced for the
specialist (see bibliography
inside back cover). For this
special issue, the editors of
the "Unesco Courier" have
called upon some of the
leading authorities in the
field of palaeontology to
trace the story of man's ori¬
gins in simple language ac¬
cessible to the layman. It is
the editors' hope that the
texts and illustrations will
help to make all readers
more familiar with man's
past and the long road that
has been travelled since the
19th century refused to be¬
lieve that modern man ever
had any primitive ancestors.

Ramapithecus, who is believed to be the earliest man-like primate. He
is said to have branched off from the apes over 14 million years ago. He
was first identified from a fragment of jawbone found in India in 1934.

Homo sapiens;
20 million years
in the making
by William Howe/Is
ODAY we can almost point
to the first real "ancestor" of man.
By this ancestor I mean a creature
who, among the evolving primates of
20 million or more years ago, had just
branched off from the group of our
nearest relatives, the apes a creature,
still very much like an ape himself,
whose descendants nevertheless
evolved continuously In a different
direction from that point on. We are
quite sure we have the fossil jaws
of such a creature his name Is
Ramapithecus (named romantically for
the Indian god Rama)who lived
about 14 million years ago, and the
story of our knowledge of him is an
interesting story about science itself.
We have realized for some time that
man arose In this way, from animals
leading to the apes on one side and
to ourselves on the other. After
Darwin's great book, "On the Origin
of Species", had made inevitable the
acceptance of evolution (including
human evolution), Thomas Huxley
almost at once showed how closely,
in every way, we resemble the great
apes. He said, In fact, that they,
the apes, are closer to us than they
are to monkeys.
This led to a lot of public jokes
and private dismay, and the Idea was
resisted in many ways, by scientists
as well as others. But now, after a
hundred years, all the study of anatomy
and, quite late, of such things as the
molecular structure of proteins has

only shown more and more positively
that Huxley was right. Indeed we can
go a step beyond Huxley and say
that apes of Africa, the gorilla and
chimpanzee, are more closely related
to man than is any of the three to
the orang-utang of Indonesia.
After Huxley's time, some anatomists
pointed to the fact that apes are
adapted in body form for brachiating,
or hanging and swinging from their
arms. This is a particularly good and
safe way for a large animal to move
in trees. Pointing also to our own
broad shoulders and flat, broad
chests, as well as to details of our
elbow and wrist joints, and arrange¬
ments of muscles, they argued that our
ancestors were likewise adapted to
a considerable degree for brachiation,
and for life in trees. This was one
more argument for close relationship
to the apes.
Here again, other anatomists resist¬
ed the idea, arguing that the
resemblances were not very signi¬
ficant, and perhaps had evolved In
parallel with the apes. They preferred
to think of an ancestral line which
had been separate from apes, or even
monkeys, for a very long time.
(Always in the background there
seems to have been an unconscious
revulsion against relating ourselves
to chimpanzees, by people who looked
on them as "animals", not noticing how
large-brained and intelligent these
same animals really are.)
They had arguments: we do indeed
stand upright, and our feet are very
different from an ape's; and our jaws
are now quite different, particularly
with small eye teeth which do not
project above the other teeth in the
obvious way an ape's do. Could these
larger teeth have evolved backwards
to smaller ones? Could the hand-like
foot of an ape have been made over
into a human foot?
These difficulties are not as great
as they once seemed. Such changes
are almost commonplace in animal
evolution, with teeth being diminished
or lost, and limbs modified in drastic
ways. In addition, we must not try
to picture our common ancestor as
though he were a chimpanzee or
gorilla; these animals have been
evolving too. As study has gone on,
and fact is piled on fact, most anthro¬
pologists have become convinced that
our forebears did indeed use trees like
the African apes, who actually live
more on the forest floor than in trees.
Still later, fossil jaws of the ancestral
ape Dryopithecus drew attention to
the very close likeness of the molar
teeth in ourselves and apes. Though
the first specimen was found in
France in 1856, it was during the early
part of this century that such fragments
were discovered in greater numbers,
from fossil-bearing beds of Miocene
and Pliocene age, and in the time
range of about 20 million to 8 million
years ago.
The fossils have come from other
parts of Europe and from India, and
later from East Africa, Georgia
(U.S.S.R.) and China. With all this, the
web of evidence has drawn tighter
around our connexion with the apes.
For Dryopithecus was evidently the
ancestor of the large apes, and his
remains are so widespread that we
can now hardly expect to find a new
and different fossil group in the future
from which we ourselves might have
come.
Another important fossil "ape", J)
Oreopithecus of Italy and East Africa,
who lived at the same time, became
well known a few years ago. But,

THE ROAD TO HOMO SAPIENS
Drawings on the next four pages show artist Rudy Zallinger's impression
of primate and human evolution. The drawings are reproduced with the
kind permission of Time-Life Books, New York, and are taken from "Early
Man", a richly illustrated volume in the "Life" Nature Library series which
young and old readers alike will enjoy (see bibliography, inside back cover).
Above the figures is shown a time scale. The progression is not always strictly
chronological since in certain cases considerable overlap existed. Proto-apes
and apes were quadrupedal but are shown standing for comparison.
PLIOPITHECUS
An early proto-ape, it resem¬
bled the modern gibbon al¬
though its arms were not as
disproportionately long. Now
classed as an ancestor of the
gibbon line. First fossil re¬
mains found in 1834.
PROCONSUL
Once regarded as a direct
ancestor of man, but now
considered as a very early
ape, the ancestor of the
chimpanzee and perhaps of
the gorilla. Numerous frag¬
ments found in East Africa
add up to almost complete
skeletons. A contemporary of
"Pliopithecus".
DRYOPITHECUS
First of the fossil great apes
to be discovered, its remains
have been unearthed through¬
out Europe and in North India
and China. Fossils range
from about 20 million to 8
million years in age. Man is
considered to have emerged
from "Dryopithecus" stock.
OREOPITHECUS
A contemporary of "Dryopi¬
thecus", it is believed to have
stood about 4 ft. tall and
weighed about 80 pounds. Its
remains, discovered in Italy
and Africa, led scientists to
wonder if it could be a direct
ancestor to man, but it is now
widely regarded as a side
branch of the ape family.

20 MILLION YEARS (Continued)
while his body form was rather like
a chimpanzee's, showing a similar
kind of adaptation to trees in a related
animal, his teeth are quite different
from a chimpanzee's and from ours
as well, a fact which only links our
descent still more closely to the apes
of Africa.
It was out of the Dryopithecus stock
that man emerged, and in fact it was
from among the fossils of Dryopithecus
fossils that our ancestor Ramapithecus
became known. G.E. Lewis of Yale
in 1934 described the first upper jaw,
found in India's Siwalik Hills, and
pointed to some man-like features.
Your own mouth will show you these
things, where you can feel them with
your finger. Your dental arch is short
and rounded in front, while that of
apes has become increasingly longer
and broad across the front, with
large canine teeth and broad incisors.
Your molar teeth have the cusp and
furrow pattern of Dryopithecus, but
are square; an ape's are longer. This
length makes an ape's face projecting;
yours is straighter:
Approaches to the human shape
could be seen in the small fragment
of Ramapithecus as though he had
just set his foot on a path diverging
from Dryopithecus, although unfortun¬
ately we have not found the foot, only
the Jaw. So Lewis thought Rama¬
pithecus might belong in our ancestry.
But the tide of scientific opinion
and such tides are apt to Influence,
not facts, but the way we see facts
was against Ramapithecus, and the
fossil was put away in a drawer as
simply one more kind of Dryopithecus.

RAMAPITHECUS
Now considered by many
specialists to be the oldest
of man's ancestors in a direct
line. Probably still lived in
trees and resembled ancestral
apes more than man.
A. AFRICANUS
The first hominid, this early
form of "Australopithecus",
(or "Ape of the South") was
a biped, walked upright and
was able to run in the open
plains. This major change
from tree-hanging and using
the arms when walking on the
ground (like apes) happened
some time before 5 million
years ago.
,. ROBUSTUS
Though he stood upright and
had hominid features, "A.
Robustus" represents an evo¬
lutionary dead end in man's
ancestry. Dr. Leakey main¬
tains that none of the Austra-
lopithecines can now be con¬
sidered in a direct line with
the genus Homo (see p. 25).
ADVANCED
AUSTRALOPITHECUS
Possessed a bigger brain than
his predecessors, was a bi¬
pedal walker. A contemporary
of "A. Robustus". Primitive
tools discovered with both in
East Africa but which creature
produced them is not certain.
Known as the Pebble Culture,
the tools are small stones
with only a few flakes.
After almost 30 years, however, L.S.B.
Leakey found a very similar fossil at
Fort Ternan In Kenya, which he could
date as being 14 million years old.
It happened that at the same time,
Elwyn Simons at Yale was looking
once again at Ramapithecus. He was
impressed with what Lewis had
pointed to, and saw the same features
in Leakey's new specimen.
Perhaps more Important, Simons
rescued other pieces of Ramapithecus
from burial in museum drawers. He
began examining old collections in
various places from the U.S.A. to
India, and recognized a few more
fragments with the same special
features, fragments which had
previously been misnamed and
ignored, but which he identified as
fossils of Ramapithecus.
This careful sorting out made it
easier to see the slight distinctions
between Ramapithecus on one hand
and Dryopithecus, ancestor of the
apes, on the other. Thus we also
see the beginnings of the separating
paths of human and ape evolution,
or between animals properly called
pongids (apes) and those called
hominids (anything on the human side
of the same group). So palaeontology
is not all looking for fossils in old
river banks.
What brought the split about?
Evolution has "reasons" it follows
lines of successful adaptation but
we know so little about Ramapithecus
having only his jaws and teeth, that
we cannot see the "reason". We
cannot simply say that it Is better or
more successful to be "human",

HOMO ERECTUS
Usually referred to as the first
"true man" of the genus Homo,
but we now know that earlier
australopiths had many similar
traits and also worked tools. He
knew the use of fire and pro¬
duced the first true handaxe
(Abbevillian culture). First "Homo
erectus" found was the famous
Java Man of 1891.

because that really means nothing,
and Ramapithecus certainly resembled
the ancestral apes far more than he
resembled man. Like some chim¬
panzee populations he seems to have
lived In an open wood and, again
like chimpanzees, it is probable that
he was still a tree-user.
Professors Simons and Keith Jolly,
however, think he had begun to differ
in diet from chimpanzees (who eat
much coarse wild fruit) by using
tough but nutritious foods like nuts,
seeds and hard roots. This is because
his teeth had thicker enamel than
an ape's, and showed signs of heavy
wear. He seems to have used his
molars as grinders, more than his
front teeth, and this would be related
to his shorter face.
Ramapithecus lived from some time
before 14 million years ago down
at least as far as 8 million. Then,
simply because no fossils have yet
been found, there is a gap in know¬
ledge until 5 million years ago. But
surprising changes must have taken
place: by this time much more obvious
human ancestors had appeared, and
they are fairly well known from the
time between about 4 million and
1.5 million B.C. Here also, however,
there was a long wait for recognition
in the face of doubt.
It was in 1924 that Raymond Dart
in South Africa saw the first skull, of
a young child, in a box of fossils
brought from Taung. He thought from
its face and teeth that it stood
halfway between man and ape, and
he named it Australopithecus ("ape
of the south"). But he had not found

Two schools of thought today

races had a common ancestor;
the polycentric sees them

ancestral lines.
and we never do find a complete
skeleton, adult, and exactly dated;
and his colleagues rejected his idea,
believing this juvenile, still with its
milk teeth, to be merely an interest¬
ing new ape. Much later, and slowly,
did the many finds arrive which
showed that Dart himself had been
too cautious. (The further fossils were
found years ago by Dart and Robert
Broom In South Africa. New ones
are found every year, greatly added
to by discoveries In East Africa by
Dr. and Mrs. Leakey (at Olduvai
Gorge) and their son Richard (in north¬
ern Kenya) as well as by Professors
Camille Arambourg and F. Clark
Howell.)
In the jaws of these australopithe-
cines, the large (but human) back
teeth also strongly suggest powerful
chewing for tough foods. The front
teeth (canines and incisors) were
small and entirely hominid in nature,
not something partly ape-like. For
several million years there were two
lines of these australopiths: Australo¬
pithecus, barely the size of a modern
African pygmy, and Paranthropus, who
was a little larger but had jaws as
powerful as a gorilla's, though the
jaws were short and deep (for grind¬
ing with the back teeth), not long,
with a gorilla's large canines (for
stripping forest vegetable food).
The australopiths, we know, were
bipeds like modern man, capable of
running In the open plains. Their hip
and leg bones differ from ours today
in some ways, showing that they were
less efficient walkers. Nevertheless,
some time before 5 million years ago

they had passed a major milestone of
change, from tree-hanging, and from
using the arms when walking on the
ground (like apes), to a free upright
gait on an arched foot with an erect
torso. Apes can walk this way but
poorly: their feet are flat, their great
toes protrude and do not help in
pushing forward, their knees will not
straighten (except in orangs), and their
long, high pelvic bones make them
top-heavy.
"O we now know that defi¬
nite hominids go back before 5 million
B.C., while at the same time our
strong likeness to the African apes
means that we have a common ances¬
tor at a time not too remote. Ramapi¬
thecus looks like the beginning of our
line, and if he seems very ape-like we
must remember that it Is the human
side, not the ape, which has been
changing most rapidly. We can be
sure our ancestors abandoned trees
and a diet of fruit and coarse vegeta¬
ble matter, perhaps only in the last
10 million years or less.
The reasons why we became bipeds
are far from clear, though many have
speculated. Even now we cannot run
very fast: on uneven ground a gorilla,
using the knuckles of his hands in
running, can go as fast. We can,
however, cover long distances in
hunting, but could the first bipeds do
so? Carrying food in the arms to a
safe eating place might have encour¬
aged uprightness: so might the need
of a small animal to rise and peer
over tall grass.
Perhaps, in our tree life, we became
adapted to uprightness, as did apes,
but not to such a degree that, as in
apes, a heavy torso and long arms
encouraged throwing part of our
weight on our arms. Perhaps several
such factors combined; we cannot say.
But bipeds we were by about 5 million
years ago, with important changes
still going on in hip bones and feet
to make this kind of gait more
effective (see photos pages 42-43).
The australopiths are our undoubt¬
ed ancestors at that time; there
are no other possible candidates.
Once again, there is controversy
over the actual path of evolution.
Some think there was only one varied
species of australopith, not two
distinct lines. And in former days it
was assumed that there must have
been a "cerebral rubicon", a magic
brain size of about 750 cubic centi¬
metres below which an ancestor could
not be "human".
But simple stone tools, which are
over two million years old, have now
been found near Lake Rudolf in East
Africa. They could have been made
only by the australopiths since no
more "advanced" men are known to
have existed then; and the brains of
these austrapoliths were not larger
than a chimpanzee's. So shaped stone
tools did not wait for "man" to make
them, and it is thought likely that tools
actually helped the australopiths to
become "man", by accenting the
evolutionary advantages of skilful
hands and larger brains (1).
At any rate, this was the next
major step, the advent of Homo
erectus. His appearance, about. 1 mil¬
lion B.C., probably follows another
small gap in the record which might
make the difference from Australo¬
pithecus more obvious. "Homo", a
new genus, recognizes the difference,
and the new group. Also Homo
erectus is commonly spoken of as
the first "true man", but it is not clear
that such an expression is justified,
since many of his traits were already
present in the australopiths, who were
also working tools at an earlier time.
These new men, however, must
have presented an appearance more
like our own. In body size, and in
general features of the skeleton, they
were much the same as ourselves.
The head also would have looked more
"human", with a smaller face and with
jaws dominated at last by the brain-
case. However, this braincase was
thick, and brain size had come only
half the way from australopiths to
modern man.
The first Homo erectus to be found
was the famous Java man (originally
named Pithecanthropus), of 1891. He
caused a scientific explosion, as the
first really primitive man to come
to light, and even his own discoverer
came to think that he was really a
large tree-living ape. He reigned
virtually alone (very recently five new
examples of his skull have been
found) until the Peking men of north
China were discovered, but Homo
erectus is now recognized from East
and North Africa, and In Hungary
(Vertesszollos) and Germany (the
Heidelberg jaw).
We know little about the transition
to Homo erectus, or where it took
(1) Some of these same australopiths, be¬
fore the tools were found, had already been
classed by Leakey and others as very early
'men', or Homo and, following a suggestion
of Professor Dart, were named Homo habi-
lis, with the sense of being 'good with the
hands". We shall come back to this.
place. Writers like to argue for either
Africa or Asia as the "home of man",
but this may not be important. Rama¬
pithecus probably reached India from
Africa 10 million years ago at least,
and after that there must have been
hominids in both continents, at the
stage of Australopithecus. It happens
that their remains so far have been
found mostly in Africa, in favourable
spots like Olduvai Gorge.
We have a few suggestions of what
occurred. The large-jawed Paran-
thropus seems to have changed hardly
at all during three million years or
more. The site of Swartkrans, in
South Africa, yielded many of his
known fossil parts. It also provided
two or three jaw fragments, of the
same age, which Broom and Robinson
twenty years ago believed to be
different from Paranthropus, and more
advanced in form. They christened
the type "Telanthropus", though Rob¬
inson later decided that the parts
belonged to Homo erectus. In either
case, two different hominids were
there together, one being Paranthro¬
pus and the other a more advanced
kind. Here is a powerful argument
for the real existence of two different
forms at the same time.
few years ago, by an
almost magic piece of luck, three men
were looking over these and other
fragments in the collections in Pre¬
toria when they noticed broken edges
which could be fitted together to make
larger pieces, where this had not been
seen before.
They were able to join the "Telan¬
thropus" upper jaw to much of a face,
an ear region, and a bit of forehead.
(Palaeontology, I said, is not just a
matter of looking in river banks.)
This gave most of the face and front
of the skull, to which the lower jaw of
"Telanthropus" would have been a
fairly good fit. The whole thing
suggests Homo even more strongly
than before, but seems to be too
small in size.
At about the same time Mrs. Leakey
found a small crushed skull in the
lowest levels of Olduvai Gorge, be¬
low the well-known Zinjanthropus (a
Paranthropus) and dated to not quite
two million years. This was only the
latest in a series of similar finds from
Olduvai, all of which had been called
Homo habilis by Leakey and his
associates. Though fragmentary, they
were obviously not Paranthropus,
having higher skulls and smaller jaws,
and to many they suggested the

smaller South African form Australo¬
pithecus.
After a great deal of work, the new
skull was put together. This and the
reconstructed "Telanthropus" give us
a better picture: they are somewhat
more advanced than the known Austra¬
lopithecus but are still very small for
Homo. They may well be showing
us the ancestor who had just begun to
make stone tools and who, in the next
million years, turned into Homo.
Again, controversy. Some prefer to
call this little person Homo habilis, in
the belief that both Australopithecus
and Paranthropus became extinct, and
that this graceful little creature dev¬
eloped directly into high-skulled,
large-brained Homo sapiens without
passing through the stage of low¬
browed, thick-skulled Homo erectus.
But this raises the problem of who
might have been the ancestor of
Homo habilis, unless it was Australo¬
pithecus, whom he greatly resembles;
and also the problem of why remains
of only Homo erectus have been
found for the period immediately after.
It seems safer to assume, for the
present, that the Australopithecus line
began making simple tools nearly
2 1/2 million years ago and, during
a time from which we have almost
no fossils, grew larger in size and
advanced to the erectus stage, while
Paranthropus continued contentedly
munching coarse vegetable food with
his great jaws, ignoring tools, until
he became extinct.
If the first Homo erectus to be found,
the Java Man, was considered in the
1890s to be very subhuman, we know
better now. In Africa, and evidently
in Europe, he made large stone hand-
axes, or coups de poing, increasingly
well-shaped in comparison with the
earlier pebble tools.
We do not really know about how
he used them. All we can say is that
he occupied the warmer parts of the
Old World for at least half a million
years (and even some cool places in
Europe and China), as the major
glacial periods were beginning; and
that in this time he showed some
evolutionary progress in brains which
became larger and skulls and jaws
which became less massive.
At the moment, he may now seem
more like a well-defined "stage" than
he should, because we not only lack
fossils from the period just before,
but also have very few from the
hundreds of thousands of years follow¬
ing the second (Mindel) glaciation.
Change doubtless went on by small
steps during these times, but we
cannot see the steps just now.
The Swanscombe and Steinheim
skulls, of the Second Interglacial,
perhaps 250,000 years ago, and the
new Tautavel skull from the early Third
Glacial, are important. They are much
advanced over the known erectus men,
but they are still too few to help us
much, or show what was happening
worldwide. It is only in the Third In¬
terglacial and the last, or Fourth Gla¬
cial, mainly within the last 100,000
years, that we come again to a wealth
of fossil men, and to the Neanderthal
problem, the greatest controversy of
all.

was reported in 1856, he too was
thought to be subhuman by some, but
only an exceptional modern man, pos¬
sibly a diseased person, by others (the
first controversy, now forgotten). A
Neanderthal skull is indeed excep¬
tional, being very long and low, with a
continuous protruding bony browridge
across the forehead containing well-
developed sinuses or air spaces. But
the skull contours are not those of
Homo erectus, and the brain was at
least as large as our own.
Neanderthal man's face was equally
remarkable; it was long, protruding
sharply forward In the midline from the
top of the nose on down. Had his
nose not been so broad we might call
him "hatchet-faced", but modern "hat¬
chet-faced" north Europeans are apt
to be tall and slender, while the Nean¬
derthals of Europe were short and
stocky.
'ONTROVERSY over pri-
mitiveness and antiquity did not last
long. Today we know that Neander¬
thal man occupied Europe in the Third
Interglacial and much of the Fourth
Glacial periods (perhaps between
150,000 and 35,000 B.C.), and that he
was the author of the Mousterian va¬
rieties of retouched flake stone tool,
which were technically far advanced
over something like a handaxe. These
tools in some ways foreshadowed
those of the Upper Palaeolithic, which
were made from bladelike flakes and
were used by Cro-Magnon man among
others.
For a hundred years now, discov¬
eries of skeletons of the European
Neanderthals have given rise to a
conception of his "classic" form as I
have described it. They have also
reinforced the conclusion that he gave
way, with seeming abruptness, about
35,000 B.C. to men who were entirely
modern in physique, though robust,
and who were in fact like living Euro¬
peans.
This is the heart of the modern con¬
troversy, with strong opinions on both
sides. I have stated the distinctive¬
ness of Neanderthal man too simply
and sharply, in order to begin with a
contrast. In North Africa there were
other Neanderthal-like men, more mod-
en. in some ways, lacking the typi¬
cal facial projection of the Europeans.
They too were followed by modern
men of rugged build, apparently com¬
ing from the east about the same time
(35,000 B.C.), or perhaps earlier.
The Near East is more puzzling.
Men with Neanderthal faces, and
with Neanderthal peculiarities of the
skeleton, existed in the early
Fourth Glacial, with Mousterian tools.
But their skulls were not as "classic"
as the Europeans, and some of them
were remarkably tall, like the Amud
man of Israel, found by Japanese
excavators. (Here we must remember
that modern men vary greatly Scots
and Eskimos might be compared to
these Neanderthals in body size.)
The argument is over whether the
Neanderthals, in Europe or elsewhere,
were in fact replaced by invaders, with
really new Upper Palaeolithic methods
of tool-making, in a brief period (a
few thousand years); or whether the
Neanderthals simply evolved into mod¬
ern man on the spot, while his stone-
working, adopting new techniques,
made the changes from what is termed
Mousterian to what is termed Upper
Palaeolithic.
It Is a complex argument, and is
based partly on assumptions (and, I
believe, partly on tides of scientific
opinion, like older arguments). In
spite of all that is known, ways of
convincing opponents have not been
found. Some archaeologists empha¬
size transition in tool-making. Other
archaeologists grant that there are im¬
portant Mousterian survivals in the
early Perigordian culture of the upper
Palaeolithic of France. But they see a
clear break with the coming of a
second culture, the Aurignacian, which
has different tool-making techniques
and also a wealth of decorative
objects previously lacking. This they
view as something entirely new, an
intrusion; and they cannot imagine a
simple cultural evolution.
Similarly, some anthropologists can¬
not imagine biological evolution so
swift as to produce a modern face
and skull from that of Neanderthal
Man in a few thousand years. Others
are doubtful about the shortness of
the period, and emphasize intergrad¬
ation in shape between Neanderthal
and modern man, especially in the east.
They hold that evolution, not replace¬
ment, presents fewer difficulties. They
note that if there was an invasion, the
source of the "modern" Upper Palaeo¬
lithic men has not been found and that,
if the European Neanderthals are rather
special, the Near Eastern Neanderthals
are more intermediate and "progres¬
sive".
These scholars would paint a rather
simple picture of human history, prob¬
ably too simple. They suggest that
there was everywhere a "Neanderthal
phase" of human evolution in the last
glacial period, out of which all of us
Eskimos and Scots alike emerged
as modern man. This broad view as¬
sumes that there were Neanderthal
men everywhere in the Old World, as
there certainly were throughout Eur¬
ope and apparently around its edges.
Carleton Coon, in a well known
book, "The Origin of Races", has
argued for another theory something
like this one. Modern races appeared
in different parts of the Old World,
not from a single Neanderthal phase
or Neanderthal population, but from
different races of Homo erectus
already present in these places.
There are difficulties here, but the
theory does recognize something im¬
portant which the other scholars neg¬
lect: that there were other kinds of
Ice Age men, such as Solo Man of Java
and Broken Hill Man ("Rhodesian
Man") of southern Africa, who had
some of the primitive traits of
Neanderthal man but were really
quite different. They are less well
known: they are discoveries, or
facts, which are still hard to interpret.
Solo Man, though living at the same
time as the Neanderthals, had a much
thicker and cruder skull, more like
Homo erectus.
There is a final chapter to all this.
What do we know about modern man
himself? Living races seem very dif¬
ferent, some with very dark skin, some
with blond hair, some with narrowed
eye openings. But in form of skull
(and this is what we can compare with
early man) they are really much alike,
with smaller faces and higher, narrow¬
er bralncases. This is my own conclu¬
sion, after having worked with skulls
from all parts of the globe. I believe,
as do many colleagues, that all must
have some common source. But
where, and when?
H1ERE we are In a shadow-
land lighted by too few discoveries.
Outside of Europe, where we observe
the disappearance of Neanderthal
Man, remains are especially scanty.
Nevertheless, striking recent finds
seem to mean that Homo sapiens of
our own kind existed elsewhere, in
Africa and Asia, in the same period
as the Neanderthals of Europe.
They are different from those "pro¬
gressive" Neanderthals I spoke of.
Several skeletons from Jebel Qafzeh,
in Israel, have no radiocarbon date but
come from cave levels in which the
tools and the soils indicate a time
fairly early in the last glacial period,
probably well before 40,000 years ago.

And the skulls are surprisingly modern
not completely so, but being quite
different from Neanderthals. Only the
large bony brows, and perhaps larger
front teeth, in some of them, suggest
Neanderthal Man, and others of the
tribe had quite small teeth, and small¬
er, modern brows and faces as well,
as far as Is now known.
Two skulls found by Richard Leakey
in Kenya, of modern form or close to
it and not Neanderthal are surely
older than 37,000 years. Some autho¬
rities think they may be very much
older. For to the east a skull from the
Niah Cave in Sarawak (Borneo) has
been dated by two methods to about
40,000 BC, and it looks like a Melane-
sian or possibly an Australian.
I ODERN men of the same
general kind had made the difficult
water crossings (difficult for early
men) to Australia before 30,000 B.C.,
and many recent discoveries attest
the presence of such people there and
in New Guinea over the next ten
thousand years. In the New World,
recent finds prove the Indians were in
South America about 20,000 years ago,
much earlier than had been generally
believed, so that men had come to the
Americas from Asia probably several
thousand years before. No American
skeletons are as old as this, but we
can only suppose that these earlier
men were like the later.
Now here is the important thing.
All the known skeletons I have men¬
tioned were of modern form. In
addition, the European Upper Palaeo¬
lithic people had the nature of later
Europeans; the early Australians were
recognizably like later Australians or
Melanesians; and we can only suppose
that the first Indians of America were
the same kind of proto-Mongolold we
see In them today.
The Omo skulls of Africa cannot be
recognized yet, and otherwise there
are no African skulls quite so old.
But the signs are that, by the time the
Neanderthals vanished, or before, not
only was modern man fairly wides¬
pread, but the races we see today had
already taken shape.
We still cannot say how this happen¬
ed. It is strange that we should
know so little of our nearest ancestors.
But we cannot expect to have the
whole story after only one century of
searching. There are blank parts of
our history now, but they will be filled:
we have hundreds of years of ex¬
ploration ahead of us.
