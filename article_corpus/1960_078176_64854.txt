THE HEN WITH THE GOLDEN CHICKS
by Emil Condurachi
Director, Institute of Archaeology of the Academy

Among the
most treasured
possessions of
the Rumanian
National Anti-
qui t ies Mu¬
seum in Bu¬
charest is a
collection of
twelve works
of art in gold
which has
become known as "The Hen with
the Golden Chicks.'' The name has
come from a group of magnificent
bird-shaped clasps contained in the
collection which comprises in all
twelve objects, some worked in solid
gold and embellished with engraved
or carved designs, others in gold leaf
filagree work adorned with precious
stones set in gold.
Together they compose an inesti¬
mable treasure as much by their
beauty and value as by the light they
throw on the past history of the
Rumanian people and of Europe, and
in particular the little-known period
of the great tribal migrations be¬
tween the 4th and 7th centuries A.D.
Like every treasure worthy of the
name this one has an exciting story
behind it. One day in 1837 two Ru¬
manian peasants were working in a
quarry at a tiny village called Piet¬
roasa when they suddenly unearthed
a fantastic treasure in gold. One by
one they drew from the ground
26 cups, vases, clasps and other gold
objects, many of them decorated with
precious stones.
For a whole year they kept then-
discovery a secret until they met an
Albanian stone-cutter and decided to
sell him the entire treasure trove for
4,000 piastres. The Albanian decided
that it would foe easier to sen the gold
if he broke up all the objects and
disposed of them one by one to diffe¬
rent jewellers. Some he smashed up
with an axe, scattering the precious
stones with which they were studded,
and he split a solid gold tray into
four parts, all of which were later
recovered and reassembled.
Fascinated by the gold, he threw
away all the precious stones as well
as some chips of gold which were
later found by some village children.
Thus the rumour spread through the
village that a treasure had been
discovered and this, in turn, reached
the ears of the authorities. An in¬
vestigation was made, but it was not
until five years later, in 1842, that

careful searching enabled 12 of the
original 26 objects to be recovered.
But the chequered history of the
"Hen with the Golden Chicks" did
not end on the day in 1842 when the
treasure found its way, into the
collection of the National Antiquities
Museum in Bucharest. In 1868 it
disappeared in mysterious c i r-
cumstances and was badly damaged
by" those who stole it.
Fortunately, a young Rumanian
archeologist, Alexandru Odobescu,
had spent several years studying the
treasure and delving into its origins.
The drawings and reproductions he
had had made of the objects enabled
them to be reconstructed and restored
when they were eventually recovered.
Nor was this
the last ad-
venture for
the Pietroasa
treasure. In
the Autumn of
1916 it was
evacuated
from the Mu¬
seum in Bu¬
charest to save
it from the
armies invading Rumania, and was
taken to Russia along with other
works of art. Later, it was handed
back to the Antiquities Museum by
the Soviet Government.
The total weight of the objects
now preserved in the Museum is
44 pounds, and the fact that there
were originally a further 14 objects,
which were never recovered after the
peasants had sold them, shows that
this was undoubtedly one of the
largest treasures of its kind ever
discovered in Europe.
There are differences of opinion as
to the origin of the collection. Some
historians, like Alexandru Odobescu,
believe that the treasure belonged to
the Visigoth king, Athanaric, who in
378 A.D. fled from the Hun invasion.
According to this version, Athanaric
took refuge in the region of Pietroasa
and there buried his most precious
possessions, hoping that a change in
fortune would enable him to recover
them sometime later.
Other scholars, however, maintain
that the treasure belongs to a later

GOTHIC PANTHEON OF THE GODS
One of the most remarkable pieces of the Pietroasa treasure is a beau¬
tifully worked shallow dish, or patera, dating from the 2nd or 3rd
century A.D. Ten inches in diameter, it is decorated with a statuette
surrounded by sixteen figures of gods, Graeco-Roman in style, several
of which are reproduced here. Above, left to right: the third of the
Gothic Fates holding in her left hand the scissors with which, like her
Greek counterpart Átropos, she cuts the thread of human life; a young
man, naked and carrying a mantle draped over one arm and a whip
in his other hand, is probably the Germanic Castor; woman dressed
in a flowing robe, a pail in one hand and a porringer in the other, is
another of the three Fates; statuette of the Gothic Earth goddess
(seen also in centre of dish, below). Opposite page, top: the Gothic

period and is not connected with the
flight of the Visigoths. They point
out that Athanaric would have been
ill-advised to bury what was the
royal treasure or even the sacred
treasure of the nation in a region he
was going to have to abandon
completely.
But the objects themselves do have
many things to tell us of their origins
and purposes. Archaeologists agree
that they do not all belong to the
same period, and the techniques used
to make them, their shape and their
ornamentation all indicate that they
came from different workshops.
There is no doubt that the tray-
shaped patera encircled by divinities,
Graeco-Roman in style, is the work
of an artist from one of the Greek
settlements to the south of what is
now the Soviet Union
The same applies to a pitcher with
a long, straight handle, the lip and
rim adorned with carved leaves. This
is similar in all respects to the multi¬
tudes of Greek "cinachoiai" made of
silver or terra cotta. The date of
these works can be fixed approxi¬
mately as the middle of the 3rd
century A.D.
The filigree
objects adorn¬
ed with col¬
oured stones,
on the other
hand, date
from the 4th-
6 th centuries
A.D. Objects
such as these,
embellished
with garnets,
turquoise, topaz and other precious
stones are the work of Oriental
craftsmen.
In the 3rd and 4th centuries, such
works of art and the precious stones
decorating them came mainly from
Sassanide Persia; and the Eastern,
Iranian style spread everywhere and
became greatly in demand among the
chiefs of the tribal aristocracy and
the rich merchants established on the
northern shores of the Black Sea.
This explains the great numbers of
objects made by this technique, which
was later to become characteristic of
German workshops.
From one end of Europe to the
other, all the royal treasures of the
Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Bur-
gundians and Lombards contained
works of art fashioned in the ancient
Persian style.
Not all the mysteries of the
Pietroasa treasure have yet been
resolved. But as artistic and histori¬
cal testimonies of the ancient story
of the Rumanian people and that of
mediaeval Europe as a whole, the
"Hen with the Golden Chicks" has
served asan touchstone of rare value.
