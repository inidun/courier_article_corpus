Mass Communications Projects
Division has evolved several spe-
cific activities wich are today in
the process of implementation.
Each is designed to show con-
cretely and dramatically how peo-
ple may work together across na-
tional frontiers, how true advan-
cement has been achieved only
through such coJlaboration and
how full a future lies ahead if we
approach it on a One-World basis.
The projects will be brought W
fulfilment not by the Unesco Se-
cretariat alone, working in isola-
tion within its headquarters in
Paris, but by the cooperation of
the National Commissions and
governments, through the mass
media of the film, press and radio
industries, and by the close parti-
cipation of the most essential
members of Unesco : the people
everywhere.
Unesco itself will carry out little

It is well-known that cultural
news presented to the public has
for its pretexts occasions such as
the re-issue of a book. the opening
of a gallery or exhibition. Such
occasions are a means of breath-

of refreshing memories of events
