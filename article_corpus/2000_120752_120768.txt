A rg e n t i n a ’s gritty resurgence
A constellation of young directors is touching the “rawness of things in the street” with a

CINEMA The present is an absurd legacy of the past,”
says young Argentine filmmaker Pablo
Trapero.“It’s crazy that a guy of 50 has to
start from scratch like a kid.That kind of
absurdity creates a tension I used to tell the
story of Rulo.”
R u l o, the hero of Mundo Grúa (Crane Wo r l d,
1 9 9 9 ) ,Tr a p e r o ’s first feature fil m , is a worker fig h t i n g
to survive. O n c e, long ago, he had his 15 minutes of
fame as a member of a rock band, but he is not too
nostalgic and meekly accepts his daily lot. He quali-
fies as a crane operator,but is rejected for the job he
wants after failing a medical.Then a job in the pro-
vinces comes up, involving driving an excavator at a
site hundreds of kilometres from Buenos A i r e s, f a r
from friends and family. Rulo puts up with this until

he gets bored,then returns to Buenos Aires to face an
uncertain future.There is something noble about this
man who manages to keep going by clinging to what
little he has—loyal and unshakeable friendships.
The 28-year-old Trapero studied film at univer-
s i t y, and had only made short films before directing
Crane World. Shooting stretched out over a year
since it could only be done when there was enough
money for equipment and crew, though the gaps
allowed him to put together sequences and rewrite
the script as he went along.
“I wanted a film that was like a hidden camera
filming snatches of reality,” he says.The film,made
in semi-documentary style, gives a dramatized view
of daily life stripped of all pretence.“ The crane is for
all of us a symbol of building the future,” says Tra-

pero.“Rulo wants to have a future but he can’t get
o n e.” Everyday life, familiar characters, a bare nar-
rative and independent production—all are hall-
marks of other recent Argentine films that have
borrowed from the John Cassavetes tradition of
neo-realism and the “new waves”of the 1960s.
The nearest thing Argentina has previously had
to this kind of cinema came from the so-called 60s
Generation group of fil m m a k e r s, who trained in art
cinema and short movies.They called for a break with
t r a d i t i o n , with the big-studio star system and even
with “ e n t e r t a i n m e n t ,” just as their young descen-
dants in the 1990s have been fighting against the
hackneyed style of television and other media.Th e
critical and public acclaim received by Crane Wo r l d
along with its festival successes have shown how
potent this new genre of films can be.
Glossing over a troubled
past
The enthusiastic revival of Argentine cinema
in the 1960s was fleeting, but it gave birth to two
major fil m m a k e r s : Leonardo Favio and Hugo San-
t i a g o.Several years had to pass, h o w e v e r,before this
legacy could be built upon. First,the 1976 military
coup put an end to any chance of making fil m s.
Then, after democracy was restored in 1983, most
new films chose to flatter people’s good consciences.
This soothing, opportunistic genre was epitomized
by Luis Puenzo’s The Official Ve r s i o n ( 1 9 8 4 ) ,w h i c h
won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film and tells how
a woman begins to suspect that her adopted
daughter is one of the children of people killed by
the military.The story is not about the girl or her tor-
tured and murdered parents or about her grand-
mother who searches for her, but about a woman
filled with doubts about herself.Some films,never-
theless confronted the grisly events of the military
regime. They included Alejandro Agresti’s Secret
We d d i n g (1988) and Hugo Santiago’s
The Pavements of Saturn (1985).
The latest batch of films has received
scant encouragement.A new film industry
law (1994) was immediately applied in
the wrong way.Two new taxes—on video-
cassettes and films broadcast on televi-
sion—on top of the existing ones (a per-
centage on every cinema seat sold) were
meant to help subsidize Argentine fil m s,
but an economic recession cut proceeds to
a third of the envisaged amount.Fi n a n c i a l
aid to films on general release,m e a n w h i l e,
was disbursed according to box-offic e
r e c e i p t s. As a result, the animated fil m
M a n u e l i t a (1999) about a female turtle,
seen by two million cinema-goers,
received a much larger subsidy than either
Crane Wo r l d or Silvia Prieto,with 68,000
and 14,000 box-office sales respectively.
But Trapero is not alone in leading a
cinematic charge. Martín Rejtman,
Esteban Sapir and A d r i á n
Caetano/Bruno Stagnaro are also part of
a movement going by the name of “ N e w
Argentine Cinema,”which has produced
the country’s most exciting films in recent
years.“Films should be about everyday
t h i n g s,” says Sapir. “ You should
shoot in a different way and touch
the rawness of life in the street.We
have to change cinema by making
real life into a poem.”
It all began in 1995 with the
commercial screening of H i s t o-
rias Breves, a collection of short
films that had won prizes from the
National Institute of Film and
Audiovisual A r t s.The formula was
r e p e a t e d , and gave impetus to
several young directors—Raúl de
la To r r e,Eliseo Subiela, Juan Jo s é
Ju s i d , Daniel Barone and Beda
Docampo Feijoo—whose enthu-
siasm had managed to break
through a suffocating academic
milieu.
Argentina is now turning out
between 20 and 30 films a year.
But local showings are not enough
to recuperate the one to two mil-
lion dollars each film costs to
make, a budget that directors are
unwilling to trim. Rejtman attacks
this way of thinking, saying it is
“important for filmmakers to stop
thinking about sales strategies and
start thinking about film strate-
g i e s. I’m not saying there’s no
commercial cinema but we have
to stop thinking just about that.”
New films like P i z z a , Beer and
C i g a r e t t e s,Crane Wo r l dand Mala Epoca (Bad Ti m e s ) ,
which cost four or five times less to make than other
m o v i e s,had well-balanced investment/return ratios.
“ We should make films over the next five years that
d o n ’t cost more than $400,000 each,” says Caetano.

“ Th a t ’s still a huge amount of money for a country
without any.”Young filmmakers have learnt to save
money by forming co-operatives, not shooting at
w e e k e n d s, using natural backdrops and employing
non-professional actors and technicians who are fil m
s t u d e n t s.
Stagnaro and Caetano, two of the participants in
the Historias Breves, co-directed P i z z a , Beer and
C i g a r e t t e s in 1997 by respecting these conditions.
Its enthusiastic reception highlighted a slowly-deve-
loping trend that had evolved from films such as
Fine Powder (1996) by Esteban Sapir, which com-
bined the experimental style of Godard with novel-
ties from video-art;Garage Olimpo (1999) by Marco
B e c h i s, a lucid and painful look at detention centres
during the military dictatorship; and Mala Epoca
(1998) by Mariano de Rosa, Nicolás Saad, R o d r i g o
Moreno and Salvador Roseli, which linked a
number of stories set in a hostile urban context,
where everyone appears misplaced and unsettled.
“ We film things we’d like to see ourselves as
fil m - g o e r s,” says new director Andrés Ta m b o r n i n o.
Lucrecia Martel, also shooting her first fil m , says that
what annoys her about the “ d i n o s a u r s ” (the previous
generation of filmmakers) is that they became
“indifferent and timid,and so ended up using false
metaphors instead of getting out into the street
and depicting things as they are.”
The new wave of films cannot be called a move-
m e n t .They do not fit a defined set of values and are
not aesthetically uniform.Their vitality comes from
their diversity and their different approaches; t h e y
share what a country suffered, they share the spirit
of a generation, the methods of production, t h e
personal imprint of the author, the shunning of rhe-
toric and the concern for identity.They give a blunt
but impassioned account of Argentina following
the military dictatorship, in the era of Presidents
Raúl Alfonsín and Carlos Menem.
A film like Crane Wo r l d was a hit because it is a
sombre portrait of people who refuse to abandon
their hopes. It is this combination of melancholy and
resistance that connects Rulo with his audience. ■
