White fortresses in
c y b e rs p a c e
The face of racism changes on the Internet as preppy professionals join the ranks of the
“classic” tattooed skinheads. Will they prove even more dangerous?
fter celebrating the Internet as a digital
nirvana in which democracy and free
speech flo u r i s h , we are finally uncovering
the dark side in which racists and
xenophobes not only broadcast their
propaganda in cyberspace but also ply their
paraphernalia and hate through
international networks.However the spate
of scare stories about the burgeoning tide
of racist online materials ignores the
ultimate question: is the face of racism
c h a n g i n g ?
Most articles focus exclusively on the
number of websites, virtual discussion
groups and chat rooms spreading the
messages of white supremacist groups
like the Ku Klux Klan, White A r y a n
Resistance and the British National Party,
which first seized the Internet as an
unregulated and relatively cheap media in
the mid-1990s. While there is no doubt
that these sites and groups are growing,
accurate estimates are difficult to
c a l c u l a t e.To investigate hate on the Net,
you must combine the skills of a detective,
a lie detector and propaganda code
breaker. For online materials are part of
a digital masquerade that conceals as
much as it shows. You cannot simply
count and record web addresses because
of the frequency in which pages are
posted and taken down.H o w e v e r,e x p e r t s
agree that there are hundreds of sites,
perhaps as many as 3,000.
Much of the debate about hate on
the Net has revolved around censorship.
Internet Service Providers (ISP) may
voluntarily prohibit use of their servers
and install filters along with web browsers
to prevent access to key racist sites. But it
is almost impossible to regulate the Net as
a whole.The debate about censorship has
become a cul-de-sac because of the
seemingly irreconcilable tension between
the libertarian ethos of free speech and
the difficulty in defining the limit of what
is morally acceptable to say or write. To
some extent, the polemic overshadows
the critical issue:what is drawing people
into the racist Net world?
“WHITE PRIDE WO R L DW I D E ” —
with this slogan, Don Black of the U. S.
launched the world’s first and most
notorious racist website S t o r m f r o n t o n
March 27,1 9 9 5 .B l a c k ,a former Klansman,
learned his computer skills in a federal
prison in Texas where he compulsively
worked on the prison’s Radio Shack T R S -
80 computer at U. S. taxpayers’ expense.
Once out of jail,Black put his new skills to
work to build an international system of
followers by offering a trans-local notion of
r a c e.
A common language of race
and white solidarity 
Consider this passage from an e-mail
sent to S t o r m f r o n t:
“I am a 20-year-old white American
with roots in North America dating back
300 years and then into Europe,
N o r m a n d y, Fr a n c e. Well anyways, I am
proud to here [hear] of an organization
for the advancement of whites.”
Racists like Black are basically using
the Internet to foster a notion of whiteness
that unites old world racial nationalisms
( i . e. in Europe and Scandinavia) with the
white diasporas of the New World (i.e.
United States, C a n a d a , South A f r i c a ,
Australia and New Zealand and parts of
South A m e r i c a ) . Despite the diversity of
racist groups in cy b e r s p a c e, they share a
common language of race and white
s o l i d a r i t y. Fi r s t l y, this notion of whiteness
promotes a racial lineage that is plotted
t h r o u g h ,and to a large extent sustained in
cy b e r s p a c e.The Internet is the technology
of globalization, i n t e r c o n n e c t i n g
permeable human cultures. Yet in the
racist Net-world, the Internet is used to
foster an ethos of racial separation.Wi t h
the goal of establishing “white fortresses”
in cy b e r s p a c e, these racists are forging

In Britain, David Copeland’s racist nail-bombing ca    

new connections between ultra right-wing
sites in North A m e r i c a , Western Europe
and Scandinavia at a considerable pace.
Ye t , it is still the American websites and
news groups that are the most
sophisticated and the most active.
The big question remains exactly how
many people are being drawn into racist
activism by the Net? Recently, A l e x
Curtis—self-proclaimed “Lone Wolf of
hate” from San Diego and producer of
the extremist magazine The Nationalist
O b s e r v e r—claimed to “reach 100s - 1000s
of the most radical racists in the world
each week.” However, it is dangerous to
o v e r-estimate the level of activity. Th e
number of white racists regularly involved
in the Internet globally is somewhere
between 5,000 and 10,000,divided into 10
to 20 clusters.Once again, it is impossible
to offer anything other than an educated
g u e s s. The number of “ h i t s ” on a web
p a g e, for example, need not indicate
“sympathetic inquiries,”rather they could
include opponents, monitoring agencies
and researchers. The key point is that
these relatively small numbers of people
can have a significant presence.
Not only are they using the Net for
r e c r u i t m e n t , but attempts are also being
made to combine cy b e r-activism with that
of the “real world.” For example, t h e
RaceLink web page offers a list of
activists’ contact details and locations
around the world.A d d i t i o n a l l y,The A r y a n
Dating Pa g e (now posted on S t o r m f r o n t)
offers a contact service for white
s u p r e m a c i s t s. While most of the profil e s
are A m e r i c a n , there are also personal ads
from a range of countries including Brazil,
C a n a d a ,H o l l a n d ,N o r w a y,Po r t u g a l ,U. K . ,
Slovakia and Australia as well as from
white South A f r i c a n s.
Lonely hearts in search 
of their own kind 
One of the interesting things about
scrolling through the personal ads is that
the faces that appear are nothing like the
archetypal image of “The Racist.”There
are very few skinheads with Nazi tattoos:
these white supremacist “lonely hearts,”
mostly in their twenties and thirties, l o o k
surprisingly prosaic. Take 36-year- o l d
C a t h y, who lives in the U. S. state of
P e n n s y l v a n i a , which is far from an ethnic
melting pot, but who is “desperate to
move to a WHITE area!” She appears
in the photograph in a rhinestone outfit
with glitzy earrings:“ The picture of me is
a little overdone,” she explained.“I had
photos done with the girls at the office …
I look like an Aryan Princess when I get
dressed up. But I am really the girl-next-
door type.” O r, 1 9 - y e a r-old Debbie from
New England,who wrote:“I am [a] young
white power woman who seeks someone
seriously devoted to the white power
m o v e m e n t .A person whose commitment
is undaunting. I would like to speak with
men who share the same values as I.”
The male ads provide an equally
unexpected set of portraits of white
s u p r e m a cy. Frank (see photo next page),
a 48-year-old divorced single parent from
Palo Alto California,writes:“Today I’m
a responsible parent and have my views
but don’t go out of my way to let it be
known unless confronted. I have tattoos,
and am down for the Aryan race.So hope
to hear from you fine ladies in the near
f u t u r e.” Here Frank presents himself as a
kind of white supremacist “new man.”
This is contrasted with John Botti’s ad, a
2 5 - y e a r-old from Los Altos who presents
himself as a preppy,“going places” k i n d -
o f - g u y.He wrote:“I am looking for some
who is as conservative and pretty as hell.
Equally as important is someone with a
quality education.” These are images of
fascism in the information age that bear
little resemblance to previous
i n c a r n a t i o n s.This was brought home very
powerfully by the image of Max, a 36-
y e a r-old Canadian,who described himself

little resemblance to previous
i n c a r n a t i o n s.This was brought home very
powerfully by the image of Max, a 36-
y e a r-old Canadian,who described himself
as a “long-time Movement activist.” He
listed his interests as anthropology, M o n t y
P y t h o n ’s humour, the Titanic story, C e l t i c
music and [U.S.] Civil War re-enacting.
Max chose to have his photograph taken
at his computer keyboard, where he
presents himself as the picture of
technological profic i e n cy.This struck me,
the first time I saw it, as a very appropriate
image of the face of today’s racism.
H o w e v e r, these postmodern portraits
of racism are coloured by fragmented and
multiple identities little suited to the
disciplined organization of “real world”
racist politics. In this mercurial world,c a n
the ideology and commitment to racism be
turned off as quickly as the computer?
There is some evidence to suggest that
Net-racists have a rather chaotic affil i a t i o n
to white power politics. For example,
American Milton J.K l e i m , who was once
the self-styled “Net Nazi Number 1,”
renounced his politics almost overnight.
Shifting from National
Socialism to misanthropy  
Kleim first became involved through
U s e n e t ,a network of online newsgroups,a s
a student in 1993. But he didn’t have a
face-to-face meeting with anyone in the
racist movement until he graduated in
1 9 9 5 .Less than a year later,he abandoned
racism altogether. In an e-mail interview he
c o m m e n t e d : “ The act of leaving was
p a i n f u l , and the aftermath stressful […] I
essentially became a ‘ n o n p e r s o n ,’ and I
h a v e n ’t really been denounced […] I only
received two or three harassing phone calls
from displeased movement adherents…
The saddest part is that my ‘ m o v e m e n t ’
experience was my most exciting, m o s t
rewarding time in my life,” he commented.
“ I ’ve moved from National Socialism to
M i s a n t h r o p y.”Racist culture offered Kleim
a sense of purpose through an online
identity and a temporary resolution to
existential crisis.This same sense of purpose
comes through in many interviews with
Net racists.What is equally true is that this
does not last and the virtual mask of racial
extremism can be quickly cast off.
Not only does individual commitment
appear shaky, but so do the larger
networks of Net-based racist groups. I n
the “real world,” each group generally
revolves around or owes its existence to a
charismatic leader who takes on the
initiative of forging alliances. Th e s e
a g r e e m e n t s,h o w e v e r, are generally short-
lived because of power struggles between
the various leaders. In cy b e r s p a c e, t h i s
fall-out seems to be occurring at an even
faster pace.B a s i c a l l y, the condensed rate
of exchange in cyberspace shortens the
fuse for an explosion. The vituperative
on-line feud between Harold A .
Covington of the National Socialist Wh i t e
P e o p l e ’s Party, William L. Pierce of the
National Alliance and both sets of their
supporters (in the U. S.) is perhaps the
best example of this syndrome.R e fle c t i n g
on “ The Future of the White Internet,”
Covington wrote:
“ The Net is being viciously and
tragically abused by a shockingly large
number of either bogus or deranged
‘White Racists’ […] I think it is too early
just yet to quantify just how the lunacy
interacts with, counteracts and affects the
impact of the serious political work.It is
like panning for gold in a flowing sewer;
both the raw and toxic sewage and the
gold are there, and the question is how
much gold any individual can extract
before the fumes and the corruption drive
him off—or until he keels over and falls
in and becomes part of the sewer system.”
The racist use of the Internet is not
about to deliver a mass global racist
m o v e m e n t . In this sense, the imitators of
fascism and Nazism are not in the same
league as the zealots of yesteryear. Ye t
the significance of this phenomenon
should not be sought in the numbers of
a c t i v i s t s. The fact that those involved
remain relatively small should not be read
as a comforting statistic. Wh a t , t h e n , i s
the nature of this threat? The real danger
is perhaps that in the information age
isolated acts of racist terrorism may
become commonplace. In this respect the
1999 London bombing campaign
conducted by David Copeland—who
found his “ r e c i p e ” for nail bombs on the
Net—may be an indication of the form
that racist violence will take in this
m i l l e n n i u m . These acts are perpetrated
by individuals whose prime contact with
racist politics is via their computer
