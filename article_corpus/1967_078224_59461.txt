HANGING CITIES AHEAD ?

c»"CONVENTIONAL architecture, even ¡n the
form of skyscrapers, may soon be inadequate to meet
the problems arising from the population explosion
while increasingly complex technology makes huge
urban centres a necessity.
The creation of "space cities" hanging above those
already existing would mean that more room would
be available for housing and agriculture. The French
architect Yona Friedman has devised a type of
"mobile" architecture which -could be expanded and
shifted within an immense metal framework mounted
on piles and which could be suspended over cities.

plex incorporated in the network.
Left: the sort of "space district" which might cover
Paris, for example. Above: residential district over
the Seine: the model superimposed on the photograph
of the river banks, with the Eiffel Tower in the back¬
ground, gives a clear idea of how one city could be
"hung" over another. The space town would be
air-conditioned and reserved for pedestrians. Yona
Friedman maintains that the whole of Europe's popu¬
lation could live in between 100 and 120 of such
space cities.
