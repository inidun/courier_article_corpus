Children are being told the facts of life 
by a new wave of authors, but there’s still plenty of room
for Prince Charming, fairies and witches.
C h i l d re n ’s books 
n
For ye a rs children’s literature wa s
the Cinderella of literat u r e ,
languishing in the shadow of a
cantankerous stepmother. To d ay the
maiden is ready to go to the ball.
Didacticism and and moralizing are
fading away into the past and writing for
children is becoming an art - f o rm in its
own ri g h t , a genre whose borders now
stretch far beyond the classroom, t h e
l i b r a ry or the nurs e ry. Book production
for young people has also become an
i n d u s t ry which is attracting more and
more attention in the shape of
c o n f e r e n c e s , p ri z e s , book fa i rs and
u n i ve rsity theses all over the wo r l d .
“A children’s book isn’t a schoolbook
a ny longer,” s ays Leena Maissen, head of the
Swiss-based Intern ational Board on Books
for Young People (IBBY), whose offices 
in 60 countries are trying to make more
literature and art available to the world’s
children.
“Books for children are cert a i n l y
valuable teaching aids, and they’re especially
useful for giving children a taste for reading.
But new trends are coming in. Taboos are
being broken, children are being taken
s e riously and being treated like real people,
and long-avoided subjects are being
tackled.”
Fa i ry stories still have a place, of cours e .
Children still dream about witches, bears,
p rincesses and elve s , but in a different way.
Colombian writer Gloria Cecilia Díaz say s
t h at in children’s books these day s , “ t h e
world isn’t always seen through rose-
coloured spectacles. For many people,
talking to children meant using diminutive s ,
talking about little houses and little gi r l s ,a n d
avoiding subjects like disease, violence and
death.”
Manuel Peña Muñoz, a Chilean author
of children’s books, a gr e e s. “Some teachers
think they’ve covered children’s literature
once they’ve told the story of Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs,” she says. “What’s
m o r e , some authors simply tell stories about
princesses and gnomes,add a bit of moral
icing to the cake, and that ’s it. But that ’s not
enough,these days.”
The illustrator’s
magic wand
A number of recent books have
r e worked subjects, f o rms and narr at i ve
t e c h n i q u e s. To d ay ’s children read stori e s
about divorce, death, drugs, air pollution,
political extremism, violence and racism.
And all kinds of books are being published
which rely on the magic wand of the
illustrator or cartoonist.
Before they know how to read, babies
can play with books made of fa b ric or books
made to take in the bat h .L ater on, they are
given picture books that may be cubical or
triangular, outsized or miniature, possibly
b i l i n g u a l .They also like work-books which
come with wat e r c o l o u rs and paintbru s h e s ,
and comic books crammed with detail
where they have to spot a figure hidden
among thousands of others.
Not that the traditional children’s book
is being sidelined.There are still story b o o k s
where the pages pop up when they are
o p e n e d , to make a forest or a castle.A m o n g
the latest ideas are interactive 
s t o ries where readers choose the plot or
ending they wa n t , and books on CD-Rom,
which are ve ry popular in rich industri a l i z e d
c o u n t ri e s.
The public has enthusiastically gr e e t e d
the wealth of ingenuity displayed by
p u b l i s h e rs. “ P r e v i o u s l y, giving a child a
book was almost seen as an insult,” s ay s

come of age
Canadian author Marie-France Hébert .
Her books, published by the French-
language Quebec publisher La Court e
Échelle, sell like hot cakes, in hundreds of
thousands of copies.“ T h e r e ’s a real appetite
for reading these days and I try to get across
to children the passion for reading which is
food for the mind and the heart , like a
medicine or a vitamin.”
Updating
traditional tales
Robert hates maths—he can’t make
head or tail of it. But one night he dreams
of meeting a sharp-tongued little goblin
who promises to teach him all about it.Of
course, he thinks it’s just another bad
dream. But actually he’s being taken on
an exciting journey into the world of
m aths by The Number Devil, a book
published in 1997 by the German poet
and essayist Hans Magnus Enzensberger,
one of a growing band of authors who are
writing these days for children as well as
adults.
Morocco’s Tahar Ben Jelloun (Racism
Explained to My Daughter) , Spanish wri t e rs
Fe rnando Savater (A Father Addresses his
Son on Questions of Ethics) and Carm e n
M a rtín Gaite (“Little Red Riding Hood in
M a n h at t a n ” ) , Chilean Luis Sepúlve d a
(“The Story of the Seagull and the Cat
who Taught him to Fly”) and A u s t ri a ’s
Pat rick Suskind have all updated traditional
s t o ries or tackled topics like racism and
ecology.
The Cuban writer Joel Franz Rosell
s ays this renewal of children’s literature is
p a rtly because school programmes have
been revamped to include modern wo r k s.
“ P u b l i s h e rs see an enormous market here
and are ve ry keen to profit from it,” h e
s ay s. “The thing about the market for
c h i l d r e n ’s books is that children don’t bu y
the books themselve s , someone else does—
p a r e n t s , t e a c h e rs or librari a n s. The child
d o e s n ’t know or care whether there’s an
a u t h o r. Some researchers have eve n
d e s c ribed children’s literature as texts
without authors. But parents are amazed by
the fact that their children can read authors
t h at they like too.”
Some authors say they don’t sw i t c h
styles when they write for children. O t h e rs ,
such as Jasmine Dubé, from Quebec, say
they write in a totally different way.“ W h e n
I write for adults,” she says,“I feel like I’ve
got less spirit, that it’s more cerebral, that
I’m censoring myself more. I don’t gi ve
such a free rein to my imagi n ation and I’m
less direct. I think other wri t e rs do it much
better than me. But when I write for
c h i l d r e n , all my passion and urgency
return.”
C h i l d r e n ’s literature is not deve l o p i n g
at the same speed eve rywhere in the wo r l d .
“In some places, like India, books are still
w ritten for children in a ve ry traditional
way and change is ve ry slow in coming,”
s ays Maissen. Yet from India sprang the
f i rs t - e ver children’s book more than 2,000
ye a rs ago—a collection of tales called the
Pa n c h at ra n t a. The country, which has 18
official languages and more than 1,600
d i a l e c t s , publishes books for children which
mostly draw on tales, legends and heroic
past eras.
The most daring publishers and authors
are in We s t e rn Europe. In Eastern Europe,
the new market economy leaves little room
for quality books. “The Czechs, S l ova k s
and Russians used to be top of the league for
children’s books,” says Maissen.“But the
economic crisis has pushed their highly
c r e at i ve people into illustrating books
published in the West.”
Between books 
and television
Books for children and teenagers have
a healthy share of the market. F i g u r e s
available at the 1998 Frankfurt Book Fa i r
s h owed that 7.5 per cent of the 78,000
books published in Germ a ny in 1997 we r e
for children, a percentage which has
remained steady over the past few ye a rs. I n
F r a n c e , c h i l d r e n ’s books have held up
better than other titles in the publishing
c risis which began in the early 1990s, a n d
in 1997 represented 8.3 per cent of all
s a l e s. In Brazil, 31 per cent of books
published in 1997 (including some
schoolbooks) were written for children.
But such figures should not hide the
fact that reading is competing with
t e l e v i s i o n , films and electronic media,w h o s e
audience is gr owing faster than book
r e a d e rs h i p. A UN E S C O-sponsored surve y
carried out in 1995 by Utrecht University,
in The Netherlands, s h owed that in regi o n s
where there was electricity, 93 per cent of P
‘Some teachers think they’ve covered children’s literature
once they’ve told the story of Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs. What’s more, some authors simply tell stories
about princesses and gnomes, add a bit of moral icing to
the cake, and that’s it. But that’s not enough, these days.

schoolchildren spent an average of three
h o u rs a day in front of a television. G i ven a
choice between a book and T V, most of
them chose TV.
Building a youthful 
following
Publishers have risen to the challenge by
b ri n ging out written adaptations of the
l atest Disney film and telling the story of the
sinking of the Ti t a n i c from all kinds of
a n g l e s. Of course such products don’t have
a ve ry long shelf-life, lasting only as long as
it takes for the big transnational film
companies to come up with another money-
s p i n n e r. To surv i ve such fa d s , p u b l i s h e rs
h ave to build up a loyal following among the
reading public.“ I t ’s important to publish for
different age gr o u p s , to respond to feedback
from readers and keep them when they
become adults,” s ays Norma Sturn i o l o,
editor of the Espacio Abierto series at the
Spanish publisher Anaya.
The major children’s classics, which are
a lways being republished, seem to last
f o r e ve r. At the latest publishers ’ b a l l ,
Cinderella continues to whirl around with
Jules Ve rn e , Lewis Carr o l l , Mark Twain and
Saint-Exupéry. Will she one day lose her
glass slipper? Will she continue to enchant
her readers whatever their age?
G l o ria Cecilia Díaz voices what many of
her colleagues think in pri vat e ,t h at “one of
the nicest things is that gr own-ups read my
books as well.” n
