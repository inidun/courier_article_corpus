Bi l b a o ’s Guggenheim Museum
c e l e b r ates its first annive rs a ry in
O c t o b e r. In the year since the
d o o rs first opened, the gigantic glass and
titanium building designed by Califor-
nian architect Frank O. G e h ry has at t r a c-
ted more visitors than the population of
the city which it has helped to place
firmly on the world cultural map.
In the early 1990s, f o l l owing the decline
of its heavy industry and the shut-down of
s t e e lworks and shipya r d s ,Bilbao might have
become a backward-looking city immers e d
in nostalgi a .I n s t e a d , at a time when Seville
was inaugurating Spain’s first high-speed
train and smartening itself up to celebrate its
U n i ve rsal Exposition, Barcelona was sta-
ging its Olympic Games and Madrid wa s
chosen as the Council of Europe’s “Cultu-
ral Capital of Europe”, this port on the
Atlantic coast of nort h e rn Spain decided to
look to the future and discard its traditional
image as a grey city with nothing to offer
but its financial status as the headquarters
of Spain’s leading banks and the country’s
second biggest stock market in terms of tur-
n ove r. In short , it embarked on a revo l u t i o n
which is still only in its early stages.
With suppor t from the European
U n i o n , the Spanish and Basque gove rn-
m e n t s , the regional council and pri vat e
e n t e rp ri s e , a wide range of initiat i ve s
were launched to transform industri a l
Bilbao into a city of culture and serv i c e s
with the aid of noted architects from all
over the wo r l d . Façades were cleaned,
p o rt facilities were renovat e d , the airp o rt
was modern i z e d , an eighteen-year motor-
way construction plan got under way and
drainage schemes were drawn up to
enable the ri ver Nervión to be used for



Life looked grim as the industrial heart of this
Basque city ground to a halt. But an ambitious
new cultural policy may be just what the

Bilbao: the
Guggenheim effect
The Guggenheim Museum has become Bilbao’s leading tourist attraction.

r e c r e ational sailing.The whole operat i o n
will cost around $1,500 million.
One major project was to provide Bil-
bao with a metro. This idea, in abeya n c e
since the 1970s, was executed by the Bri-
tish architect Norman Fo s t e r , w h o s e
f u t u ristic semi-circular fa n - s h a p e d
entrances to the first line were immedia-
tely dubbed “fo s t e ri t o s”– “little Fo s-
t e rs”–by the Bilbainos. The metro has
helped soak up the traffic snarls that pla-
gued this city of 370,000 inhabitants–a
million counting the subu r b s.
The Guggenheim Museum is the keys-
tone of this vast progr a m m e . It was gi ve n
the go-ahead after a marathon series of mee-
tings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Fo u n-
d ation in New York with the Basque autho-
ri t i e s , represented at the highest level by the
head of the autonomous government.The
f o u n d at i o n ’s administrat o rs , who wa n t e d
to create a new European museum, in addi-
tion to those in Berlin and Venice,to show
their celebrated collection of modern and
c o n t e m p o r a ry art , chose Bilbao after Seville,
M a d ri d ,Vienna and Salzburg turned the
o p p o rtunity dow n . The project has been
totally funded by the Basques. The city
a u t h o rities provided the land–a disused
industrial site in the port district,the auto-
nomous gove rnment and the prov i n c i a l
a u t h o rities coughed up
$154 million,and eighty
p ri vate companies pled-
ged to make a contribu-
tion of one kind or ano-
t h e r. In return , t h e
foundation promised to
put its collections at the
m u s e u m ’s disposal, t o
handle management and
a d m i n i s t r ation and to
organize exhibitions.T h e
Bilbao Guggenheim has
also assembled its ow n
collection of wo r k s , largely by contempo-
rary artists. Paintings by Willem De Koo-
ning, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschen-
berg can be seen alongside works by
i m p o rtant Basque artists such as T x o m i n
Badiola, Eduardo Chillida and Prudencio
Irazabal.
The museum was inaugurated on 18
October 1997 in the presence of King
Juan Carlos and a 10,000-strong crow d .
In the first month, it attracted 100,000
v i s i t o rs , becoming Spain’s third most
popular museum, after the Prado and the
Reina Sofia in Madri d . After eight
m o n t h s , 700,000 entries had been regi s-
tered (the most optimistic forecasts had
predicted 400,000 visitors in the firs t
t we l ve months), a quarter of whom we r e
v i s i t o rs to Spain. According to data col-
lected by the museum, 86 per cent of the
v i s i t o rs said they wanted to come again.
The Guggenheim effect was born .
The last gr e at museum built in the twe n-
tieth century stands in what was once a
waterfront area littered with empty contai-
ners. It is currently hosting (until 22 Octo-
ber) an exhibition of 5,000 ye a rs of Chi-
nese art , from neolithic times to the modern
e r a .Bilbao is the only European city to hold
the show. On its 10,000 square metres of
exhibition space–nineteen galleries on three
f l o o rs–sculptures and seri graphs by the
Basque artist Cristina Iglesias are also on
view (until Ja n u a ry 1999). One of the rooms,
130 metres long and 30 metres wide, is easily
spacious enough to accommodate a foot-
ball mat c h .The museum also comprises an
auditorium, a library, a restaurant serving
r e gional specialities and a bookshop contai-
ning the latest books on contemporary pain-
ting.
But the Bilbao Guggenheim is some-
thing more than an art museum. Its cha-
r a c t e ristic silhouette has been a backdrop for
TV commercials and pop gr o u p s – S m a s h i n g
Pumpkins launched their latest disc there,
and Simple Minds used the gallery as a set-
ting for their videoclip G l i t t e r b a l l. C o u t u-
riers Carolina Herrera and Paco Rabanne
have transformed the central atrium into a
c at walk to present their collections. For the
first time in ye a rs ,d a m p,
grey Bilbao is becoming
k n own to the world for
something other than
t e rr o rist violence and
kidnapping.
H ow are the Bilbai-
n o s , whose city once
only received a bri e f
w rite-up in the touri s t
g u i d e s , reacting to this
newly acquired reputa-
tion? At first they we r e
sceptical about the
whole thing, r e m e m b e rs journalist Fe l i x
L i n a r e s.Then they gradually realized that
it was serious and today they are deligh-
t e d . “A familiar sight elsewhere, such as a
Japanese tourist taking photos, was some-
thing quite new here!” s ays Linares, w h o
notes that it’s still virtually impossible to
find a restaurant open on a Sunday eve-
n i n g .
Angel Gago, S e c r e t a ry-General of the
B i s c ay Hotels A s s o c i at i o n , thinks that
there has definitely been a boost to tou-
ri s m . “Until not so long ago the prov i n c e
mainly attracted business people,” h e
s ay s. “They came during the week for
trade exhibitions. From Monday to Fri-
d ay there was a decent rate of room
o c c u p at i o n , but on Sat u r d ay and Sunday
the place was deserted”–especially since
m a ny locals leave the city during we e-

The Museum was

presence of King Juan
Carlos and a 10,000-
strong crowd

kends for nearby beaches. To d ay the
annual rate of hotel-room occupation is
around 42 per cent. “ We are wo rried by
talk of building four or five new hotels
which could not be absorbed in the
i m m e d i ate future, and increased capacity
would force us to lower pri c e s ,s o m e t h i n g
we want to avo i d ,” s ays Gago. The tou-
rists who visit Bilbao today are relat i ve l y
well off, and Gago points out that “ t h e
hotels and restaurants which have bene-
fited most are the fifteen or twenty feat u-
red in the tourist guides, whereas all told
the city has 8,000 cat e ring establish-
m e n t s.”
Gago believes that anyone who drops in
on Bilbao today is a candidate for a return
v i s i t .“ D o n ’t forget,” h e
s ay s.“ We have the Gehry
M u s e u m ,Fo s t e r ’s metro,
Santiago Calat r ava ’s
b ri d g e , the area around
the Palace of Congr e s s e s
designed by César Pe l l i ,
an Argentinian architect
living in New Yo r k , i n
other words works by five
or six wo r l d - famous architects within a few
kilometres of each other.”
In her book T x o ri bu ru ( “ L i n n e t
Head”) the Bilbao writer and illustrat o r
Asun Balzola describes her city as it wa s
in the 1940s. “These were ye a rs of iron
and we lived at Bilbao, also a city of iron,
a lways we t , gleaming and black because
it was always raining. . . . The green sha-
d ows of umbrellas stained the streets and
houses blackened by smoke from the fa c-
t o ri e s. . . . Bilbao was a replica of Coke-
t ow n , the imagi n a ry industrial town des-
c ribed by Dickens in Hard Ti m e s.”To d ay
Balzola smiles as she describes her city’s
new image. “The district where I spent
my childhood has changed beyond belief.
Then it was a noisy industrial area, t o d ay
i t ’s a ve ry peaceful place. Bilbao was a
grey city like . . . well . . . M a n c h e s t e r
p e r h a p s. N ow it’s white, l u m i n o u s.”W h at
s u rp rises her most is that “people have
adopted the Guggenheim Museum, t h e y
d o n ’t see it as the property of gentlemen
in New York but as something of their
ow n . The most encouraging thing is that
young people are the chief admirers.”
And she adds: “When yo u ’re inside the
bu i l d i n g, the light, and the spirals of the
architecture almost make you forget its
c o n t e n t s. You would almost be willing to
visit it if it was empty. The Guggenheim
has made Bilbao a much more at t r a c t i ve
c i t y. You can see it from many parts of
t ow n . You walk along a street and sud-
denly there is this gr e at
titanium-clad moun-
tain in front of yo u . I t
p l ays tricks on yo u .”
Meanwhile other
projects are fuelling the
on-going Bilbao revo l u-
t i o n . “In the next three
or four ye a rs the city will
totally change,” s ay s
G u i l l e rmo Fe rn a n d e z , a Bilbao city official.
In a few months’time the Euskalduna Pa l a c e
of Congresses and Music will be inaugura-
t e d . Likened by its architects, Fe d e ri c o
S o riano and Maria Dolores Pa l a c i o s , to a
ship under construction;its role will be to
put Bilbao on the intern ational opera,
concert and congress circuits.
Meanwhile the Gehry Museum, t h e
younger brother of Frank Lloyd W ri g h t ’s
building on New Yo r k ’s Fifth Ave n u e , h a s
already taken its place in the annals of
t we n t i e t h - c e n t u ry architecture. O u t s i d e
the bu i l d i n g, beside the lines of visitors ,
the people of Bilbao look on with a mix-
ture of astonishment and incredulity. ■

Sixty years of art-loving 
The Guggenheim Foundation was
set up in New York in 1937 to pro-
mote contemporary art and manage
the collection belonging to the Swiss-
born patron of the arts Solomon R.
Guggenheim.It administers two mu-
seums in New Yo r k ,one in Ve n i c e,o n e
in Berlin,and now one in Bilbao.
In 1943 the foundation commis-
sioned architect Frank Lloyd W r i g h t
to design its spiral-shaped first
New York museum, which was ope-
ned in 1958 on Fifth A v e n u e, a sto-
n e ’s throw from Central Pa r k . I n
Ve n i c e, the Venier dei Leoni p a l a c e
is the home of the collection of
Peggy Guggenheim, S o l o m o n ’s
n i e c e, who by the time of her death
in 1979 had assembled an outstan-
ding collection of abstract and sur-
realist art.
The Guggenheim collection has
regularly been enriched by fresh
acquisitions and donations. W i t h
some 10,000 works, it is the worl-
d ’s most important private collec-
tion of modern and contemporary
a r t , comprising expressionist,
c u b i s t ,f u t u r i s t i c ,d a d a i s t ,n e o p l a s t i c
and surrealist works signed by
artists including Vasily Kandinsky.
Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, S a l-
vador Dalí, Alberto Giacometti,
Marc Chagall and René Magritte.
What makes the Guggenheim
Foundation special is its desire to
form a network of museums and
exhibition centres in different parts
of the world. Although its head-
quarters is in New Yo r k , the delibe-
rate absence of a nerve-centre
helps it to save costs when moun-
ting temporary exhibitions, t o
increase its income from sponsor-
ship and to keep its works moving
a r o u n d . The Guggenheim system
has been described, by some admi-
r i n g l y, by others grudgingly, as a
“ f r a n c h i s e ” m u s e u m .
