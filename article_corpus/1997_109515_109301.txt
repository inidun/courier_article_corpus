Sarajevo's battered

Ottoman quarter).
I "The day the Sarajevo Library
burned down, in 1992, and
the ashes rained gently down over
the city," says Maja Barlich, a staff
member of Bosnia and Herzegov¬
ina's Institute for the Protection of
the Heritage, with sadness in her
voice, "everyone was crying, as if
they had lost someone dear to
them."
The magnificent Viennese-style
building which stood on the edge
of the Ottoman quarter, grandly
embodying the city's cultural iden¬
tity, spirit and history, was
destroyed by the fury and accurate
shelling of fighting men. The ruins
did not, however, remain silent for
long. Music soon took possession
of the shell of the building, hcrald-

rushing waters of the Miljacka, now
flowing clear once more.
Leaving behind the seriously
shell-damaged high-rise blocks of
flats of the Tito period, the=trav-
eller arrives in the city centre, where
the strictly classical architecture and
the ochre and pink mansions, now
windowless or unsafe, serve as a
reminder that this was part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire until
early in the century. Then comes the
fifteenth-century Ottoman quar¬
ter, Bascarsija with its maze of
medieval lanes and the oriental
charms of Slatilo cose, the "Sweet
corner", so called because of its
many pastry shops. This old neigh¬
bourhood was relatively little dam¬
aged and soon came back to life. Its
shops reopened quickly, and the
imposing Begova Disrinja mosque
is being rebuilt.
"Sarajevo was very badly dam¬
aged," emphasizes Colin Kaiser, head
of UNESCO's Sarajevo office. "They
wanted to smash the city's identity.
Irremediable losses of archival mate-
ing a kind of cultural resistance
movement. "We still went to the
ruined library during the war," Maja
Barlich recalls. "Several concerts were
given there I remember hearing
Mozart's Requiem." Ruined build¬
ings nearby were made the venue
for film festivals and other cultural
events. Despite the shelling and
bombing, Sarajevo's pulse went on
beating regularly.
Unlike its illustrious neigh¬
bours such as Dubrovnik or
Budapest, Sarajevo never enjoyed
the reputation of being an impor¬
tant cultural centre. Built in a nar¬
row valley, the city and its five cen¬
turies of history are strung out for
seven kilometres along the notori
ous "Sniper Alley" and beside the §

rial were caused by the destruction of
the library, the National Museum
and the Oriental Institute. A whole
segment of Bosnia and Herzegov¬
ina's memory has been wiped out."
The selection of targets and the accu¬
racy of fire produced terrible results:
universities, schools, research estab¬
lishments, museums and the finest
of the Austro-Hungarian mansions
were systematically targeted. The dif¬
ference in the amount of damage
done to religious buildings is no
coincidence: the Orthodox church
and cathedral seem to have survived
unscathed but some of the mosques
in the Ottoman quarter were heavily
bombarded. Some of the old resi¬
dential neighbourhoods also suf¬
fered badly; many houses that were
thought to have been spared were in
fact hit by shells.
Piecemeal
reconstruction
Sarajevo is no longer entirely a
wasteland. "The city has been chang-

ing very rapidly of late," explains
Francis Bueb, the founder of the
André Malraux Cultural Centre,
which was set up while the war was
still raging. "The streets have been
cleaned up, the rubble cleared, the
burned-out cars removed and the
broken windows replaced." The
reconstruction of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has begun, albeit on a
modest scale.
The rebuilding of the cultural
heritage may seem to be of sec¬
ondary importance to the major
institutions which are hard at work
finding funds for urgent small-scale
projects, but for the people who
live here, the return to normality
also involves the rebuilding of their
cultural identity. "Destroying our
heritage was a way of denying our
existence", says Maja Barlich. "The
cultural monuments and sites have
to be restored in order for us to
recover our national traditions and
identity."
Lack of co-ordination
Urgent action is needed. Winds can
be very violent in Sarajevo and can
hasten the collapse of weakened
buildings, while the lack of co-ordi¬
nation in international reconstruc¬
tion efforts is hampering opera¬
tions. Since the Dayton agreement
was signed, such efforts have
increased in number but there has
not been enough co-ordination,
some countries financing operations
without knowing whether or not
other countries have already drawn
up estimates for the same project.
This lack of co-ordination is pre¬
venting full realization of the objec¬
tives: Austria, for example, with the
help of European Union funding,
has undertaken the cleaning and
protection of the library, but no-
one knows who will be responsi¬
ble for the next stage of the opera¬
tion (the total cost of which has
been reckoned at around $14 mil¬
lion). Discussion has begun as to
whether the library will recover the
literary, cultural and historical func¬
tions it had before the war or be
assigned other functions of a more
administrative nature, such as it had

in its early days. The debate is sure
to be lively, in view of the build¬
ing's symbolic importance.
The political make-up of Bosnia
and Herzegovina is scarcely con¬
ducive to making the country's cul¬
tural reconstruction any simpler:
each of the ten districts composing
the Muslim-Croat Federation, for
instance, has responsibilities in the
field of culture, but some districts
have no suitable structure to dis¬
charge these responsibilities.
On the road to
reconstruction
"At present there is no interna¬
tional-level order of priorities," says
Colin Kaiser. "The precise extent of
damage to cultural property in the
Muslim-Croat Federation is
unknown and, apart from exten¬
sive damage to religious buildings
mosques and Catholic churches
little is known about the situation
in the Serb Republic. This is why
we want to set up a forward-look¬
ing programme for the reconstruc¬
tion of the country's cultural her¬
itage." Unesco is due to send a
mission to Sarajevo in the near
future for that purpose.
For the time being, the main
project is for the rehabilitation of
the old town of Mostar, a pro¬
gramme financed by the Italian gov¬
ernment, and for the restoration of
a mosque, also in Mostar, funded
by Saudi Arabia.
In October 1996 UNESCO,
which has already been playing a
part in the refurbishment of the
National Museum, organized a sem¬
inar on the reconstruction of the
cultural heritage, enabling interna¬
tional experts to work alongside
Bosnian student architects and local
engineers. "There were 35 local par¬
ticipants and experts from all over
the world," explains Sibyl Renaud,
administrative officer in UNESCO's
Sarajevo office. "They worked on
two cases in Sarajevo the library
and the old Ottoman quarter and
three building sites in Mostar."
According to French architectJ.-
L. Taupin, a historic monuments spe¬
cialist who took part in the seminar,
"coexistence is working well. We can¬
not imagine the reconstruction of
Sarajevo without the city's history
being taken into consideration."
