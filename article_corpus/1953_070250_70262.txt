TRAVEL BOOKS
LA PARISIENNE PREFERS
BIOGRAPHIES
LOOK in the guidebook to Paris
and and among the monuments
and public bui) dings you
will find listed the city's famous
libraries : celebrated names like
the Bibliothèque Nationale, the
Sainte-Geneviève, the Mazarine,
the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal.
But these are not the libraries
of the people of Paris. They are
mostly reference libraries from
which books can only be borrowed
on rare occasions by specialists,
research workers and students.
The gas company employee and
the typist, the bank messenger
and the mechanic, the young
worker and his romantically
inclined sister, therefore, do not
go to these places to borrow
books. These people, the average
readers, never need to go any
further than the local librarv in
their arrondissement to find the
books thev need.
Despite appearances, no large
city is a single, massive entity of
people and buildings. To the
people who live there it often
becomes a nation whose provinces
are the neighbourhoods in which
they dwell. And though the city
has its illustrious institutions
these are not always as alive and
as close to the people as the more,
humble ones : the parish church,
the local cinema, the grocer's shop
on the corner. It is into this
category of accepted, familiar
institutions that the local branch
library fits.
A century ago people had to do
without them, for as late as the
year 1866 Paris possessed only one
municipal library. Then with the
development of compulsory pri-
mary education, the situation
began to change. By 1882, each
of the twenty Paris districts had
its library, and today the city has
a total of seventy-seven.
A family affair
THEY are modest places theseseventy-seven libraries. Gen-
erallv thev are housed in
the local town hall or in schools
where accommodation is limited
because of the need to make room
for an ever-increasing school
age population. So, because they
cannot accommodate many readers
within their premises, most of
them function primarily as
lending libraries.
Their share of the municipal
budget does not allow the
librarians to purchase all the
modern equipment they would
like to see installed, but has to be
uaed to meet the basic need of
book buying. Even so the budget
is now reaching encouraging pro-
portions, having risen from about
f22, 000 in 1950 to f40, 000 for the
current year.
What sort of books make up
the total collection of 769, 000
volumes on the shelves of the
Paris libraries' ? As might be
expected, a high proportion are
either French classical or modern
novels or translations of foreign
ones. But historical works make
up 21. 2% of the total and, not
counting works of fiction, books on
literature and philology represent
13. 3%. The remaining books are
devoted to geography, the fine
arts, the social sciences, philo-
sophy, religion and to musical
scores.
Last year, for example, 2, 929. 000
books were given out on loan and
more than 25, 000 new borrowers
were registered in the various
districts.
While the people of Paris who
use the libraries come from every
age group, it was especially noted
that the proportion of young
people who take out books is
becoming greater and greater.
Interesting, too, were the figures
recorded last year in terms of the
oecupations followed by library
users. Employees and officials
of various sorts made up 21 % of
the total : students, 17'% ; school-
children and apprentices, 14% ;
those with no occupation (chiefly
women), 13% ; workers and crafts-
men, 11. 5% ; primary and second-
ary school teachers, 6% ; profes-
sional people (lawyers, doctors,
engineers, etc.) 3 % ; tradesmen,
4. 7%.
A really important fact recorded
was that the majority of these
readers made regular visits to the
library and, on the average, read
between one and three books each
week. It was also noticed that
not only the card holder, but all
the members of a family made
use of the books that were
borrowed.
Best sellers
01TRAY, to what one mightexpect it is not always the
best selling novel that meets
the greatest popularity among
book borrowers. According to a
report recently published in the
"Official Municipal Bulletin of
the City of Paris", sixty per cent
of the people who take out novels
like to borrow at the same time
serious non-fiction on a subject
which particularly interests them
or on topical questions.
Choice, by the way, is not just
a haphazard affair. Many people
are strongly influenced by the
opinions of literary critics whose
articles they read in their daily
papers or magazines. Similarly
the radio and the cinema are also
having their effect. As soon as
a book, no matter what kind it
may be, has been made into a
film, it is immediately in great
demand.
Libraries have to exercise a
great variety of choice in their
book purchases so as to meet the
extremely diverse requests for
works of a general cultural
character. Men, for instance, are
attracted by books on travel, by
scientific and technical works and
those dealing with contemporary
history. Women show a predilec-
tion for plays, biographies and
poetry. Books on philosophy and
the social sciences are especially
popular with young people while
biographies and historical works
are sought after by elderly
persons.
A book a year
UNFORTUNATELY, say the libra-rians, echoed by education-
ists, neither the present
facilities offered by libraries nor
the use made of them is satis-
factory. Paris, a city of over
four million inhabitants, needs
more than seventy-seven libra-
ries. To be satisfied with the
present achievements would be to
admit that each Parisian only
needs to read one book each year.
There are, of course, many
people who buy books. But the
important point to remember is
that those who visit local libra-
ries are, in the main, people who
cannot afford to buy the books
they need. Therefore, the figure
which count-is the one which
shows the number of volumes
loaned by the municipal libraries
- three million ; three million
books which had it not been for
the libraries would not have been
made use of.
When library officials approach
the city authorities for funds to
expand the existing Parisian
libraries they might well use as a
justification the words of the
Fresh'h statesll1an who organized
the country's educational system.
"One may'do everything for the
primary school, for the secondary
school and for the university,"
said Jules Ferrv,.'but if, after all
this, there are no libraries,
nothing will have been achieved."
