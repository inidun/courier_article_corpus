schoolbooks or at best have had to learn
from borrowed ones, acquire a sense of

of the media’s current educat i o n a l

A few weeks ago, several children
wrote to the editors of Zurquí, the
educational supplement of the Costa
Rican daily newspaper La Nación. They
complained that their parents wouldn’t
let them cut out and paste figures from
the paper as the instructions indicated.
Defending themselves, the parents argued
they did not want to spoil their precious
family collections of Zurquí issues. In the
following week’s supplement, the editors
came up with a suggestion: photocopy the
figures, so that children could cut them
out and parents could keep their newspa-
per intact.
This is just one sign of the growing
interest generated by the educational sup-
plements published by many Lat i n
American papers. A distressed 11-year-
old schoolgirl in Bogotá, the capital of
Colombia, phoned the country’s largest
daily, El Tiempo, to beg for a back issue
because she had lost her own copy. What
she really wanted was Mi Tiempo, an edu-
cational supplement the paper distributes
free to pupils at 80 public and private
schools in the city. “The girl was upset
because she lost the paper before she’d
finished doing all the activities in it,” says
Ofelia Corradine, the managing editor of
the monthly, which prints 31,000 copies.
For most of the school pupils in
B o g o t á ’s poorest neighbourhoods—30
per cent of which are taking part in the
project—Mi Tiempo is not only the closest
to a schoolbook that pupils have ever
come across but also something they can
take home to colour, draw in, and write
down what they think. One of the issues
in the first half of 1999, for example, ran
articles about tolerance and getting along
with others, with plenty of space where
the children could express their opinions.

lop a close personal relationship with the

Educational supplements for young readers are flourishing 
in the Latin American press
television. These supplements also try to
explain in simple terms current events
like the war in Kosovo or the recent
Turkish earthquake. Estadinho also carries
regular columns on language and science.
‘A fun way to read’
Other smaller papers are hot on their
h e e l s. In the Argentine city of Bahía
Blanca, La Nueva Provincia sends a fort-
nightly supplement called El Diario de los
Chicos to 3,000 subscribers aged between
5 and 14. One of its writers, known as
“Santiago”, is a 12-year-old film critic
with a collection of 700 film reviews from
newspapers all over the world. In the city
of Paysandú, Uruguay’s most widely read
provincial paper, El Telégrafo, publishes
Gurises (which comes from a Guaraní
Indian word meaning “ c h i l d r e n ” ) , a n
eight-page tabloid whose motto is “A fun
way to read”. Ever Thursday, the day it
a p p e a rs , “ t h e r e ’s plenty of fun in
Pay s a n d ú ’s schools,” s ays Enri q u e
Sánchez, a journalist on El Telégrafo.
Gurises publishes material for class-
room use and gives news about school
events, competitions and other children’s
activities. It also provides an outlet for
imaginative work by printing unpublished
stories and, with backing from the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF), tries to get across
to its readers the importance of protec-
ting nature,with a section of photographs
on environmental issues. In 1996, the
g ove rnment of this nort h e a s t e rn
Uruguayan province declared Gurises to
be “of value” to the province because it
encouraged children to read.
The newspapers are usually not just
concerned with attracting young readers,
but also with getting their parents into the
habit of reading the paper every day.

heavily for survival on news-stand sales
than on income from advertising.This is

The result is a flurry of promotional
activities to boost circulation, with initia-
tives such as subscribers’ clubs—started
by El Tiempo in Bogota—and competi-

atlases, encyclopaedias, health booklets,
football posters, CDs and cookbooks.
Education sells papers

the library would still probably show the

Some of the supplements follow the sylla-
bus prescribed by their country ’s educa-
tion ministry. Z u r q u í ’s e d i t o r , Pat ri c i a

is connected with Costa Rica’s official syl-

w hy it’s used so much by parents and espe-
cially teachers.”
Following such programmes involves
tackling the same subjects every year, but
the editors try to vary their approach each
time around. To teach about resistance to
the invasion of Nicaragua by the U.S. fili-
buster William Walker in 1856, Zurquí
used a play and included a script and ins-
tructions about how to make costumes.
The following year, it printed cut-outs to
put in a history corner in the classroom.
Later the children were encouraged to
produce a newspaper which featured the
main historical events and a description
of daily life in those days.
Low-cost reading
The great advantage of the supple-
ments is that they are much cheaper than
schoolbooks and books in general. The
edition of La Nación which contains
Zurquí costs only $0.39,while school text-
The supplements can increase the
circulation of their parent papers largely
because education continues to be regar-
ded in Latin America as a means of social
advancement.1 But they also have defini-
te advantages over other teaching
methods and resources.
One is their considerable capacity to
r e l ate knowledge to the present. P r o d u c i n g
a schoolbook, from the moment someone
thinks of writing it until the time it lands on
a pupil’s desk, takes at least two ye a rs. I n
c o u n t ries with few resources to update their
school pri m e rs regularly, this period can be
much longer. But newspapers record
e vents which happened only a few days ago.

Every Sunday, the Panamanian children’s supplement Aprendo prints sports news (at left) and children’s opinions on the week’s special topic (right).

Development Programme (UNDP), 23 per cent
of children who attend school in Latin America
and the Caribbean do not reach the fifth year.
‘The fact that the supplement
is connected with Costa Rica’s
official syllabus is an
additional attraction. 
That’s why it’s used so much
by parents and especially
teachers’

books cost $5.

daily paper La Te r c e ra, has 100,000 rea-
d e rs. It has two sections, one for pri m a ry
school children and another for those of
high-school age. It featured English as a
subject this year and has been on the We b

popular we b s i t e s ,” s ays Nuria Cot, a tea-
cher who edits the supplement.
Chile’s education minister, José Pablo
Arellano, pointed out at the end of 1998
t h at Icarito “ r e p o rted on curri c u l u m
changes being considered in the country’s
educational reform programme and also
on new teaching methods.” This meant,
he said, that the supplement was “an
extremely valuable reference tool for both
pupils and teachers.”
The teachers and children recognize
the value of the supplements. M a r í a
V i r ginia López Jo r d á n , a secondary
school teacher in Jujuy (Argentina), says
“ t h e y ’ ve provided me with up-to-dat e
material which you can’t get in school
textbooks. I’ve worked with teachers in
other subjects like history, g e o gr a p hy,
ethics and civics.The pupils can weigh up
the various sources, which stimulates dis-
cussion and helps them form opinions.”
Other advantages the teachers usually
mention are the interest the supplements
generate in the classroom, the valuable
extra source of information they provide
and the way they illustrate abstract ideas
with concrete examples.
Learning without tears
Despite all this, the supplements are
sometimes criticized for being over-aca-
demic.The press ought to be encouraging
interesting and enjoyable extra-curricular
activities, but instead it is becoming a
kind of school in itself.
Kelly says that despite attractive desi-
gn and bright colours, the content is
sometimes too seri o u s , especially in
Colombia and Argentina. Supplements
try to talk in an adult way about complex
political and social topics. “A British child
would quickly switch off,” he says. Still,
he underlines that one of the best ways to
judge the quality of the supplements is to
see how schools make use of them. “If
they do—and this is happening—it means
the supplements must be providing some-
thing that the country needs.”
Kelly thinks the press projects in
schools should first of all entertain chil-
dren and encourage them to express
t h e m s e l ve s. “There is nothing which
assures that being serious will make
people learn better.The opposite tends to
be true.When you make something exci-
ting and interesting, that’s when young
people open up and understand what you
are doing,” he says.
Tribaldos, the editor of Aprendo, says:
“We’re writing for the child of today.
We’re producing a supplement which is
entertaining and instructive at the same
time.” This credo has to survive. At least
those who associate education with plea-
sure hope it will. n
