Eve ry day, women continue to be victims of rape,
t r a f fic k i n g, a c i d - t h r ow i n g, d ow ry deaths and
other kinds of tort u r e . At the opening of this
new century, women are still not considered as equal
human beings in many parts of the wo r l d .R e l i gion and
patriarchy continue to have an all-encroaching hold
on their live s , maintaining and justifying their age-old
oppression.In some South Asian societies,this hold
is even increasing.
I do not believe that there can be real equality in
a society dominated by religion. Western countries
speak repeatedly about the necessity of economic
d e velopment to alleviate pove rt y. But this is not
enough.Societies such as Saudi Arabia may be eco-
nomically developed, but women are deprived of all
ri g h t s. The supremacy of religion is incompat i b l e
with freedom of expression, wo m e n ’s rights and
d e m o c r a cy. This is why I see religion as the main
enemy of women’s development.
We have to act on several fronts at once. F i rst of all,
i m p r oving access to educat i o n . In a society like Ban-
g l a d e s h ,80 per cent of women are illiterat e . For centu-
ries women have been taught they are the slaves of men.
It is ve ry hard to change their minds,to make them awa r e
of their oppression, to gi ve them a sense of their inde-
p e n d e n c e . This educational effort has to go hand in
hand with a secular feminist movement in society. S u c h
m ovements have to start within the country and they
cannot take hold when people are uneducated and una-
ware of their oppression. I’m not sure you can accom-
plish much from the outside, except to expose in the
media the atrocities women in all too many countries fa c e
in their day to day live s.
In Muslim countri e s , this movement is emergi n g,
but ve ry timidly, and it has a slim margin of maneuve r.
It has the uphill task of fighting for the repeal of religi o u s
l aws and the introduction of a uniform civil code. So fa r ,
it  tends to be constituted by a few individual feminists
who are forced to be diplomat i c, to compromise with
f u n d a m e n t a l i s t s , be they men or wo m e n . But they are
t rying to change the system,step by step, and it will take
a ve ry long time. People are not yet ready to do away
with religious laws that impact upon eve ry aspect of
s o c i e t y, from education and health to the workplace and
the home.
For wo m e n ’s status to change, we also need enligh-
tened leaders who believe in equality. In countries such
as mine, women with a strong voice do not have the
s u p p o rt of political leaders , whether they be men or
wo m e n .Look at the countries in which women are in
p o l i t i c s , or even heads of stat e . Does it follow that
women in those countries are emancipated? Because
of long-standing vested interests, such leaders continue
to back measures that oppress wo m e n .They are not
i d e o l o gically committed to changing these condi-
t i o n s. In South A s i a ,most of the women who become
heads of state are religi o u s , and like men, they adhere
to the religious objectives of the Establishment. I am
the victim of a country where the prime minister is a
wo m a n . Because I went one step too far in denoun-
cing religion and the oppression that it keeps wo m e n
u n d e r , I had to leave my country.
I have seen women oppose me when I talked
about women’s rights. They said straight out that
God did not believe that women should have so
m a ny ri g h t s.And I have met men in my country who
are against what is said in the religious scriptures and
b e l i e ve in equality between men and wo m e n . I t
does not depend on gender. It depends on one’s
c o n s c i e n c e . Muslim women who are we a ring the ve i l
and glorifying their subservience are obviously not
going to better the lives of the oppressed.
Until a society is not based on religion and wo m e n
are considered equal to men before the law, I do not
think that politics will advance the cause of wo m e n .I n
We s t e rn countri e s , women are educat e d , they are
t r e ated equally, they have access to jobs. In these
c o n d i t i o n s , their part i c i p ation in politics has a meaning.
E d u c at i o n , a secular feminist move m e n t , a n d
l e a d e rs—both men and women—committed to equa-
lity and justice.This is what it will take to change the
dire conditions which too many women still fa c e
t o d ay. It will take a ve ry long time, but we are here to
work towards that end. ■
