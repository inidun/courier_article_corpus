A s i a ’s

Astonishing and moving films from Asia
and Iran are giving cinema a fresh impetus
and countering American attempts to
dominate the world’s film industry
Cinema is alive and
w e l l , and fil m m a k e r s
are still surprising
and enthusing us.
More often than not,
the most promising come from
A s i a , the continent at the head
of a new cinematic move-
m e n t . The quality of films
being made in this vast
region is improving all the
time, and new talents are cropping
up to compete with American and
European directors.
The 2000 Cannes Film Festival
underscored this extraordinary vita-
l i t y. I r a n ’s Samira Makhmalbaf and
her wandering teachers in B l a ck-
b o a rd s pushed out some highly
sophisticated competitors, such as
the American Coen brothers’
ironic O Brother Where A r t
Thou? Danish director Lars von
Trier may have won the Golden
Palm for his very nordic D a n c e r
in the Dark, but China’s Jiang
Wen took the Grand Prix,Tony
Leung from Hong Kong the Best
Male Performance prize and Ta i-
w a n ’s Edward Yang the prize
for Best Director. The Locarno Film Fe s t i v a l
confirmed the trend in August by awarding its
Golden Leopard prize to Chinese director Wang
S h u o ’s B a b a and the Silver Leopard to Hong Ko n g ’s
Fruit Chan for Little Cheung.Asian films also fig u r e d
prominently at the Venice Film Festival in Sep-
tember, with The Circle by Iranian director Jafar
Panahi reaping the Golden Lion.
Such surges of new talent are nothing new in
cinema. In the early 1960s, the “new wave” in the
French film industry provided the paradigmatic
example of how this could be done. Since then,
there have seen many such creative rebellions—in
Poland (Roman Po l a n s k i , Jerzy Skolimowski),C z e-
choslovakia (Milos Fo r m a n , Ivan Passer), Ja p a n
(Nagisa Oshima, Shohei Imamura) and Brazil
(Glauber Rocha,Ruy Guerra).
Wherever they arise, these new waves—since the
term has become part of our basic vocabulary—
share common traits. They reflect a protest against
traditional concepts of fil m m a k i n g, led by artists
calling for greater freedom of expression as a way
of escaping from the straightjacket imposed by the
film industry of that time.A few strong personalities
carry others with them,a movement takes shape and
then blossoms.
But today one factor has changed in the equa-
t i o n : the American movie business has since streng-
thened its grip and taken over nearly all the cinemas
around the world. Its commercial strength remains
unrivalled, even though the quest for domination
has badly eroded the creativity of American fil m .I t
would be hard to find the modern equivalent of a
John Cassavetes,whose emblematic S h a d ow s ( 1 9 6 0 )
inspired a whole generation of filmmakers.

In the face of this U. S. j u g g e r n a u t , how have
t o d a y ’s new waves managed to take hold the world
over?  First of all, they have been recognized by
international critics,who have always done the spa-
dework when it comes to spotting new talents. O n e
need only remember the pivotal role played by
Henri Langlois, head of Fr a n c e ’s National Fi l m
Library, critics like André Bazin,directors such as
Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut and a whole
team of “Young Turks” at the French Cahiers du
C i n é m a magazine in bringing to light a pack of
directors from the U.S., Japan,India,the ex-Soviet
Union,Scandinavia and elsewhere.
Freshness and simplicity:
the keys to Iranian success
Film festivals, such as Cannes, Venice, Berlin,
London and Nantes, sought out new high-quality
work to enhance their programmes, helping impor-
tant filmmakers get established.O b v i o u s l y, n e i t h e r
critics nor festivals can create new cinematic move-
ments. But they can give them the chance to break
through and enable directors to continue making
fil m s,while sometimes even attracting support from
authorities in their home countries.
Taiwan’s case is instructive. The Three Conti-
nents Festival in Nantes (France) gave prizes in
1984 and 1985 to two films by Taiwanese director
Hou Hsiao-hsien, who went on to win international
a c c l a i m . The Taiwanese authorities then decided
to back the most promising directors and help spur
the growth of a new film industry.U n f o r t u n a t e l y, t h i s
policy was soon abandoned. Hou, Yang and Tsai
Ming-liang have enough of a reputation to raise
backing abroad,but for younger fil m m a k e r s, t h i n g s
are much tougher (see page 33).
Although American hegemony has had devas-
tating effects in some Asian countries (in Indo-
n e s i a , for example, American companies control
99 per cent of distribution and have stifled local
fil m - m a k i n g ) , the continent’s overall scene is one of
buzzing creativity.
Iran provides the finest example of dynamic
c i n e m a . Modern Iranian films are enrapturing, w i t h
an element of surprise and a human sensitivity that
is hard to find in American movies.A sense of fre-
shness and simplicity explain the appeal of these
films. The country was producing such films long
before the ayatollahs took power in 1979 (see page
2 6 ) . In the 1970s, Abbas Kiarostami had already
made such remarkable films as Tr a v e l l e r (1974) and
The Report ( 1 9 7 7 ) . But it was not until the 1988
Three Continents Festival that a Kiarostami fil m ,i n
this case Where is the Friend’s Home (1987), was
shown outside Iran.The new government had done
nothing to help the industry sell its films abroad,a n d
few festivals were able to show the works of Iranian
directors. It took many years for people to realize
how creative their films were, and how filmmakers
had managed to overcome censorship with a strong,
personal and original style.Elsewhere in A s i a , Ja p a n
stands out as a leader in the creative arts. B e g i n n i n g
with a Hollywood-style big studio system, its golden
a g e, in my opinion,has never won the recognition it
truly deserved. In the 1950s, Japan was producing
about 650 films a year—more than the United
States—and could boast great directors like Kenji
M i s o g u s h i , Yasujiro Ozu, M i k i o
N a r u s e, Akira Ku r o s a w a , w h o s e
talents were sometimes slow to be
r e c o g n i z e d . As the big studios
declined and these directors disap-
p e a r e d , another generation arose,
including names such as Nagisa
Oshima and Shohei Imamura, who
expressed themselves with greater
freedom by tackling subjects that
were more social and violent.Today
the country is turning out a new wave of provoca-
tive directors like Kiyoshi Ku r o s a w a ,Shinji A o y a m a ,
and Shinya Tsukamoto (see page 28).
These new film movements—and there are
many more, such as in South Korea (page 31) and
Argentina (page 35)—guarantee cinema’s survival.
Critics and festivals have not invented them.They
are simply helping such work reach audiences eager
to support quality films. So long as this continues,
there is reason to remain optimistic. ■
