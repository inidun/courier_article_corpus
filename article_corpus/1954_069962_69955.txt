32 social scientists
testify against segregation
SIGNIFICANT social changes are
usually the result of many differ¬
ent factors acting in combination,
and the historic United States Supreme
Court decision on segregation is no
exception to this rule. The heightened
social conscience of the American
people, in the South as well as in the
North ; the greater awareness of the
meaning of a democratic tradition
which in many parts of the world has
been under attack; the precedents set
through desegregation in a number of
universities ; the skill with which the
legal case was' prepared; the tre¬
mendous progress made by Negroes
themselves all these, and other
causes as well, contributed to the end
result.
There is one aspect of the decision,
however, which has not always been
recognized and
by Otto Klineberg
come to regard themselves, as inferior,
are severely handicapped in their per¬
sonal and intellectual development. It
is pointed out, for example, on the basis
of a number of important scientific
studies, that "minority group children
of all social and economic classes often
react with a generally defeatist attitude
and a lowering of personal ambitions.
This, for example, is reflected in a
lowering of pupil morale and a de¬
pression of the educational aspiration
level among minority group children
in segregated schools. In producing
such effects, segregated schools impair
the ability of the child to profit
from the educational opportunities
provided him."
which has far-
reaching im¬
plications, name¬
ly, the role played
by the social
scientist.
Throughout all
the legal develop-
ments which
paved the way for the final outcome,
the National Association for the Ad¬
vancement of Colored People, which
conducted the case against segregation,
called in social scientists as consul¬
tants, to give advice regarding the
present scientific position on the issues
being debated, as well as the manner
in which that position might best be
integrated into the legal argument.
In all the cases heard in the lower
courts, social scientists psychologists,
sociologists, anthropologists and educ¬
ators were called in as witnesses.
As an appendix to the brief presented
to the Supreme Court by the NAACP
counsel, there was filed a social science
statement entitled "The Effects of
Segregation and the Consequences of
Desegregation", signed by 32 dis¬
tinguished American social scientists.
It was described as "a consensus of
social scientists with respect to the
Issue presented in these appeals". Its
contents form the basis of many of the
questions to which the Supreme Court
Justices addressed themselves during
the final hearings.
Its conclusions are devastating to
the doctrine, previously maintained,
that separate but equal educational
facilities for Negro children are in fact
compatible with the American Consti¬
tution.
In essence the Statement insists that
enforced segregation is a symbol of
inferiority, and that children who are
regarded by others, and consequently
Dp Klineberg, Professor of Psychology, Colum¬
bia University, and a member of Unesco's Social
Sciences Department, has devoted much of his
life to a study of the Negro problem. He is
the author of several boohs on the subject in¬
cluding Uace Differences, Negro Intelligence and
Selective Migration, and Characteristics of the
American Negro. He testified at recent U.S.
Court heariiu/s on the effects of seyregation on
the personality of children.

Harmful effects
A questionnaire"
sent to a 'large
number of Ame¬
rican social scien-
t i s t s inquiring
into their views
on all children ^mTeffSs'
of enforced se-
gregation under
conditions of equal facilities, indicated
that 90 % of them felt that "enforced
segregation is psychologically detri¬
mental to the members of the segre¬
gated group." More than 80 % were of
the opinion that enforced segregation
was detrimental to the majority group
members as well.
Children of the majority group gain
status not always in terms of per¬
sonal ability and achievement) but
through the unrealistic conviction that
they are superior ,
r e
because of their
physical appear¬
ance or racial
origin.
The Statement
also disposes of
the question as
to whether there
are inherited dif¬
ferences in the abilities of Negroes'
and Whites which would justify edu¬
cational separation of the two racial
groups. After a brief review of
the relevant evidence, the conclusion
is reached that "fears based on the
assumption of innate racial differences
in intelligence are not well founded."
The writer might add that he himself
gave testimony to this effect in one of
the cases heard In the lower courts,
and his conclusions were not challeng¬
ed by the attorneys for the state con¬
cerned.
. Attention is given to the question of
the probable effects of desegregation,
since it has often been predicted that
this would have dire consequences even
leading to violence and bloodshed. In
this connection an imposing array of
evidence is available which indicates
that the process of desegregation can
and usually does occur without such
unfavourable consequences. The ad¬
mission of Negroes to a number of
southern universities, for example, took
violence unfounded
place much more smoothly and un¬
eventfully than many people had anti¬
cipated.
The Statement rightly points out
that the "most direct evidence avail¬
able on this problem comes from ob¬
servations and systematic study of
instances in which desegregation has
occurred. Comprehensive - reviews of
such instances clearly establish the
fact that desegregation has been
carried out successfully in a variety of
situations although outbreaks of vio¬
lence had been commonly predicted.
Extensive desegregation has taken
place without major incidents in the
armed services of both Northern and
Southern installations and involving
officers and enlisted men from all parts
of the country, including the South.
Similar changes have been noted in
housing and industry."
Apparently many people believe that
somebody else will start the rioting,
even though they themselves are pre¬
pared to accept the new situation.
There will of course be difficulties in
the way of further desegregation, but
previous experience indicates that they
can be surmounted.
It is not easy to determine just how
large a part this Statement, as well as
the continuing consultations between
NAACP counsel and American social
scientists, played in the final outcome.
Possibly the Supreme Court would have
reached the same conclusion in any
case. It is significant, however, that
the actual decision as handed down
refers explicitly to recent ^progress in
the field of psychology, and particularly
to, what is now known regarding
the harmful ef¬
fects of feelings
of inferiority on
the personal and
social develop¬
ment of children.
Thus, a far-
reaching change
in human rela¬
tions, which will
affect the whole pattern of democratic
existence in the United States, with
possible repercussions on other parts of
the world as well, has been set in mo¬
tion at least in part through progress
in the social sciences.
Some years ago Gunnar Myrdal in
his An American Dilemma called for an
"educational offensive" to reduce the
gap between public opinion and social
science in the whole area of race rela¬
tions.
Unesco, through the work it has
undertaken on race problems, has been
actively engaged in such an "offensive" ;
so have many individual social scientists
in many parts of the world. The gap
has been greatly reduced, and the
conclusions of the social scientists now
find much wider acceptance.
The Supreme Court decision repre¬
sents the most spectacular and con¬
vincing example of the part which
science can play in contributing to
human progress. \

NEGRO WOMEN
OUTNUMBER THE MEN
Between 1890 and I9S0, the Negro population ¡n the U. S. rose from
7,500,000 to over 15,000,000. From 1940 to 1950 there was a great shift
away from the South to industrial and urban areas in the North and West,
but some ¿0 % of American Negroes still live In the South today. Since the
Civil War, Negro women have outnumbered male Negroes and this difference
has recently increased still more. It is only since 1950 that statistics showed
more white women than white men. On the average Negro households are
somewhat larger than white households in all regions. In nearly one out of
four Negro families in the U. S. a woman is the head. The Negro " granny "
wields strong authority In many rural families. .
