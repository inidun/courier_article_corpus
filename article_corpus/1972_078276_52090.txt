The drowned city
of Port Royal

Shipwrecks are not the
only source of data for the marine ar¬
chaeologist working in the Caribbean.
Ringed almost completely by an earth¬
quake belt, it has provided another
type of underwater site: the sub¬
merged town.
Two of the three recorded James¬
town, off the Island of Nevis, and
Orangetown, off the Island of St. Eus-
tatius sank as the result of the same
earthquake on April 30, 1680. The
couple of hundred buildings of
Jamestown, the main sugar port, lie in
from 3 to 10 metres of water, covered
now by about one metre of sand. Of
the 150 buildings in Orangetown, a
smugglers' base located on a bluff
overlooking the sea, about a third top¬
pled into the sea, In depths of from
7 to 20 m.
Neither town came anywhere close
in size and importance to Port Royal,
in Jamaica, the third earthquake vic¬
tim. In four decades, thanks to pri¬
vateering and the contraband trade
with the Spanish colonies, it had
become the most important trading
centre in the Caribbean and possibly
in the whole New World.
Shortly before noon on June 7, 1692,
there were three strong earth tremors,
quickly followed by a tidal wave. With¬
in minutes, nine-tenths of the city's
2,000 buildings, many two and three
storeys high, had either sunk or slid
into the sea, and over 2,000 persons
perished. No accurate estimate is
available of the material losses.
Apart from the number and variety
of sites, the Caribbean has two other
ROBERT F. MARX, specialist in maritime his¬
tory and marine archaeology, particularly of
the Spanish colonial period in the Caribbean,
directed the mapping and excavation of the
sunken city of Port Royal, Jamaica (1965-68).
He has discovered and explored a number
of Mayan archaeological sites and 'cenotes'
(sacred wells) as well as many wrecks in
the Caribbean and off the coasts of Spain.

advantages for marine archaeology.
First, an enormous wealth of sources
is available, mainly in Spanish
archives, to aid in locating and identi¬
fying sites and furnish information
about the artifacts recovered. Sec¬
ondly, the working conditions are
extremely favourable. The clarity of
the water in most areas facilitates
location, and photography in situ or
as an aid in mapping.
Most sites are in shallow waters.
These can be rough on an exposed
reef, but there are no strong tides
or, in most places, even currents, and
no danger to divers of nitrogen narco¬
sis or the "bends". Uniformly warm
temperatures and fine weather permit
work to continue throughout the year
even in the hurricane season, weeks
of complete calm are common.
Port Royal offers the most exten¬
sive and important underwater site in
the western hemisphere. Salvage op¬
erations began there on the very day
it sank beneath the sea in 1692, and
continued for many years.
In January 1966, the Jamaican gov¬
ernment began a long-term, proper
excavation of the site which is expect¬
ed to continue for many years. It was
my good fortune to be selected to
direct the project, and I spent the
first four months of 1966 making a
thorough survey.
This indicated that the site measured
some 140,000 square metres in depths
of from 1 to 20 m. of water with
75 per cent in less than 10 m.
The composition of the bottom
sediment varies greatly. On average,
below the silt there is a 1 to 1.8 metre
deposit of hard packed mud and dead
coral fragments; below this deposit,
the sediment is about 70 per cent black
sand and 30 per cent coarse gravel.
A variety of excavation tools were
tested: two types of "prop-wash",
several types of water and air jets, hy¬
drolifts and air-lifts. Our final selec¬
tion was a 10 cm. diameter air-lift, with
a screen to prevent any artifacts larger
than a small coin from going up the
tube. We found that all the other
excavation tools, and even larger-
diameter air-lift tubes, could damage
artifacts.
The sediment is pumped to a barge
where it passes through a fine-mesh
screen and small objects (beads,
musket balls, pins, etc.) are recovered.
Larger artifacts are recovered on the
bottom and sent up in buckets.
A minimum of three divers are re¬
quired on the bottom: one to hold the
air-lift tube, one to send or carry arti¬
facts to the surface, and one to send
up bricks and other debris which are
too large to pass through the screen
on the air-lift tube.
Visibility rarely exceeds 30 to 60 cm
before the day's excavation starts.
Once pumping begins, it is reduced to
a few centimetres (around the mouth
of the air-lift tube) or zero. This makes
the work more difficult, as everything
must be done by touch.
The sophisticated horizontal and ver¬
tical control method used by land ar-

disaster to the great Caribbean trading centre and pirate lair of
Port Royal, Jamaica. Within minutes of the first tremor, 2,000
men, women and children had died and nine-tenths of the city's
2,000 buildings had disappeared into the sea. Major underwater
excavations at Port Royal began in 1966. More artifacts have
now been recovered than from all the wreck sites explored in
the Caribbean during the past two decades. Below left, diver

the air-lift is retained by a huge sieve in the centre of the barge.

chaeologists and by George Bass on
some of the Mediterranean sites (see
article page 8) was ruled out by the
lack of visibility and by the nature of
the sediment in which cave-ins are the
rule rather than the exception. Al¬
though most of the artifacts are re¬
covered from the first 3 m. of sedi¬
ment, we excavate to 5 m. and occa¬
sionally find artifacts in the lower
sediment.
Horizontal control is maintained by
marking with four buoys the square to
be excavated and each day recording
the position of the top of the air-lift
tube whenever important objects are
recovered and brought up. Vertical
control is maintained by establishing
the depth of water, and noting the
depth that the air-lift tube is down
each time that artifacts are brought
up for tagging.
Excavation began on the site on
May 1, 1966 and has since gone on
continuously, six days a week. We
have systematically excavated a rec¬
tangular hole 133 by 50 m. to an
average depth of 5 m. Only three intact
brick buildings have so far been un
covered, but hundreds of fragments of
brick walls and thousands of brick¬
bats have been located.
On the basis of old maps and
property records, we estimate that the
area excavated contained from thirty
to forty buildings. By checking
owners' initials on pewter and silver
artifacts with the old property records,
we have been able to identify many of
the sites. Most were private homes,
but we also found two taverns, a car¬
penter's shop, a cobbler's shop, a
pewterer's (or silversmith's) shop, the
fish and meat markets, and two turtle
crawls. In this same area we located
two shipwrecks dating from the 1692
earthquake and another dating from a
hurricane in 1722.
Excluding treasure, more artifacts
have now been recovered than from all
the wreck sites worked in the Carib¬
bean over the past two decades. Over
20,000 iron objects have been recover¬
ed most still await a suitable method
of preservation. Other finds include
2,000 glass bottles, 6,500 clay smok¬
ing pipes, and over 500 pewter or sil¬
verware items.
Two large hoards of Spanish silver
coins were found: the first in a wood¬
en chest bearing a brass keyhole
plate with the coat-of-arms of Philip IV
of Spain, the other under a fallen wall
believed to be part of a pewterer's or
silversmith's shop.
Yet, after almost two years of op¬
erations, we have not excavated even
five per cent of the site, and many
years of work' remain. It is to be
hoped that Port Royal will eventually
be used as a training centre for
students of marine archaeology.
Unfortunately, there is both very little
official interest and little financial sup¬
port; at the moment, only the Mexican
and Jamaican Governments are spon¬
soring projects.
In the Caribbean, as elsewhere, mar¬
ine archaeology is still in its infancy
as a discipline. The techniques are
still experimental and there are few
really expert archaeologists. Yet, com¬
pared with the Mediterranean, and
considering the opportunities it offers,
the Caribbean has attracted less than
its share of archaeological effort.
