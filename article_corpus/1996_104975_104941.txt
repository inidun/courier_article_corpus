Africa's women muralists Wall painting, like body decoration, cloth
dyeing and pottery, is primarily a
woman's art in Africa.
It is as necessary and as incorporated
in the lifestyle of these people as walk¬
ing, eating and sleeping. First and fore¬
most, this art form is a means of beau¬
tifying the space in which the women and
their fami lies spend a great deal of time,
of enhancing an otherwise harsh envi¬
ronment. Itis also a magicalform of cre¬
ativity, the magic coming not from its
meaning or intent but from the act of
applying the paint to the wall.
Before painting begins, the women
must restore and replaster the walls with
a mixture of mud and cow dung. The sur-
