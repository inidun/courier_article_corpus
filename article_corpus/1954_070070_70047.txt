BEHIND the reforms which have gradually diminished the
horror of prison conditions, there are the works of phi¬
losophers and jurists who fought for equality between
men, respect for the individual and the supremacy of reason
over prejudice. There is also the example of charity relieving
suffering and defying unjust laws. The humble devotion of
a St Vincent de Paul was as important to this movement as
the genius of a Spinoza or a Grotius. And it is quite clear
that there is a direct link from Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu,
Christian Wolff, Helvetius or Rousseau down to the
somewhat specialized reformers a few of whom are presented
here. Here are some of the great men to whom we owe the
major features of our modern penal institutions.



Seven apostles
of the
prisoner's rights
Cesare
Beccaria
(1738-1790)
Few books have had as
much influence on our penal
systems as the great work of
Cesare Beccaria : "Trattato
dei delitti e delle pene"
(Essay on Crimes and
Punishment) which appear¬
ed in 1764. It was an
immediate success in Italy
and in France. Soon, its
fame spread throughout Eu¬
rope and to America. Even
more important, its teachings
were to be embodied several
years later in the constitu¬
tions of certain nations
which, in turn, served ' as
models to the lawmakers of
nearly every country on
earth.
Beccaria was a disciple of
Montesquieu, whose "Persian
Letters" he read enthusiasti¬
cally at the age of 22, and a
friend of d'Alembert, Dide¬
rot, Helvetius and Buffon
- 4 - - S
counting the steps, measur¬
ing the rooms, copying down
the regulations and testing
the supplies. He is said to
have spent over £30,000 of
his own fortune in the work.
Howard then turned his
attention to quarantine sta¬
tions, the lazarettos, where
plague victims or contacts
were isolated, and coura¬
geously visited those of
Constantinople and Smyrna.
Travelling from . Smyrna to
Venice he purposely chose a
ship with a foul bill of
health, knowing that he
would thus be confined in a
lazaretto on arrival in Ven¬
ice. He spent 42 days in
two lazarettos studying
conditions at first hand.
There remained the prob¬
lem of military hospitals,
and knowing those of Russia
to be very defective he set
out on what was to be his
last journey. It took him to
St Petersburg, Moscow and,
eventually, to Kherson, in
the Ukraine, where he nurs¬
ed a young woman suffering
from "camp fever" and died
of it himself on January 20,
1790.
Philippe Pinel
(1745-1826)
About the year 1765, a
French medical student
named Philippe Pinel revolt¬
ed against the prejudices,
case-hardened traditions and
bookish teachings of his day.
He wanted to apply to medi¬
cine "a method similar to
that of the other physical
sciences". ' He followed this
idea all of his life, but he
won his greatest glory as a
liberator. It was not crimi¬
nals who were freed by Pinel
but the insane who had been
treated up until then (at
least in the Western World)
as criminals and worse.
As physician to the Bicetre
Hospital where male lunatics
were kept in Paris in 1793,
he could no longer bear the
sight of these miserable crea¬
tures howling in the cages
where they were chained and
whipped. He wrote to his
superiors: "Far from being
criminals who must be pun¬
ished, the insane are sick
persons whose pitiful state
deserves all of the considera¬
tion we owe to suffering
humanity." The authorities
hesitated; one of the leaders
of the Reign of Terror came
to Bicetre to see for himself.
"Citizen, you must be crazy
yourself to wish to unchain
such beasts" he said.
Pinel's answer perhaps
went beyond merely the
insane: "I am convinced that
the reason why nothing can
be done with them is because
we deprive them of freedom."
He "unchained" his patients
and, two years later, he did
the same for insane women
at the Salpetriere Hospital.
The book he wrote on his
"Research and Observations
on the Treatment of the
Insane" spread his ideas far
and wide. They were daring
ideas: he preached that men
could be cured of insanity
only through the use of
"reason, sensitiveness and
persuasion". "The insane", he
wrote, "should be approached
with a love of humanity
great enough to inspire the
courage to conquer routine
and fear."
Jeremy
Bentham
(1748-1832)
Jeremy Bentham, one of
the English pioneer prison
refcrmers, like Beccaria, bas¬
ed his thinking on the great
principle of utilitarianism :
the just action is the one
which brings the greatest
happiness ( to the greatest
number of' people. This was
the foundation of his work
as a moralist and as a jurist
which brought him recog¬
nition and admiration from
such disciples as Mirabeau,
Thomas Paine and Benjamin
Rush, from distant corres¬
pondents such as Mohamed
Ali and from a large number
of far less respectful imita¬
tors and plagiarists. Talley¬
rand once commented of
Bentham: "Though pillaged
by everyone, he remains
rich". In his writings, Ben¬
tham maintained that pun¬
ishment is an evil in itself
ana can only be accepted "so
far as it promises to exclude
some greater evil".
In his conception of the
treatment of offenders Ben-

-who received him trium¬
phantly in Paris.
Applying to criminal law
the main precepts of the
"philosophy of light", Becca¬
ria began with the "Social
Contract", under which the
individual voluntarily gives
up part of his liberty as
small a part as- possible. to
society. The only objective
of criminal law, he reasoned,
was to defend society and,
therefore, the restraint it
places upon the guilty man
can go no further than is
absolutely necessary to pro¬
tect society. As for the
death penalty, it is neither
useful nor necessary, and,
added Beccaria, it has no
basis in law because no indi¬
vidual has ever voluntarily
given society the right to
decide if he is to live or die.
Beccaria probably never
would have written his
book without the help of two
of his fellow countrymen,
the Verri brothers, both ar¬
dent reformers. In Milan,
Alessandro Verri was known
as "the protector of pri¬
soners" and he lashed out
daily against the frequency
of judicial errors, the irregu¬
larity of court procedure, the
cruelty and the dispropor
tionate nature of penalties,
tho use . of torture and the
hellish conditions in prisons.
"Of Crimes and Punish¬
ment", therefore, was the
fruit of common meditation
over first-hand evidence. In
fact, this book became known
not so much for its princi¬
ples but for its criticism of
the arbitrary and ferocious
judicial methods of its time.
Those who read this scathing
analysis (among them was
the Empress of Russia) were
unable to do so without a
feeling of shame. In the
end, their shame proved
salutary.
John Howard
(1726-1790)
When John Howard, a
wealthy English landowner,
was appointed High Sheriff
of Bedfordshire in 1773, one
of his duties was the safe
custody of prisoners in his
county. But unlike others
holding the ' same office in
England he was more
concerned about the dread¬
ful state of the prisons and
the misery of the inmates
than with the problem of
preventing them from escap¬
ing.
He was particularly shock¬
ed to find in prison people
who had been declared not
guilty or against whom a
Grand Jury had failed to
find a true bill of accusa¬
tions, but who remained
there simply because they
could not pay "release fees"
to the prison officers.
It was true that many
such men and women were
not likely to stay in prison
indefinitely for they had
every chance of dying
quickly from hunger or
disease. Howard set out to
change what he had seen in
his county's prisons. Visit¬
ing jails, poorhouses and
houses of correction, he un¬
covered many abuses. When
the evidence he collected
was placed before Parlia¬
ment, two bills were passed
requiring counties to pay
their prison staffs and to
clean prisons, and clothe and
care for the inmates.
But Howard was still not
satisfied. After visiting Scot¬
tisn and Irish prisons he
went to France and visited
the principal Paris jails,
although he failed to get
inside the Bastille. From
here he went to Holland
Flanders and Germany. A
second visit to the continent
and more inspections in
England gave him the mate¬
rial he required for his fa¬
mous work "The Stat» of the
Prisons in England and
Wales", in which he also
included accounts of some
foreign prisons. One of the
results was the passing of a
bill authorizing the construc¬
tion of two penitentiary
houses in which it was
intended to introduce suc¬
cessful mesures Howard had
seen in Ghent and Amster¬
dam such as giving inmates
useful work to do.
A simple, deeply religious
man, Howard worked unaid¬
ed by either state or chari¬
table institutions. Self ap¬
pointed inspector of prisons
at home and abroad he tra¬
velled some 50,000 miles, note¬
book in hand, visiting pri¬
sons, hospitals, lazarettos,
schools and poorhouses,
questioning the authorities,
6 7
tham was far in advance of
his age, but a plan for prison
reform which he proposed
was spoiled by the elaborate
detail which he loved. Under
this scheme, he declared:
"Morals would be reformed,
health preserved, industry
invigorated and instruction
diffused."
Manuel
Montesinos
(19th century)
If a traveller had set out
in 1835 to visit the world's
most modern and most "pro¬
gressive" prison, he would
probably have ended up in
Valencia, Spain. There, Colo¬
nel Manuel Montesinos had
set up a penal system which
'combined liberal ideas with
firm discipline. He operated
it on principles which, even
today, are sometimes regard¬
ed as novel and surprising.
Our traveller certainly would
have been' struck by the
appearance of this prison,
the cleanliness of its cells, its
dining rooms and its work¬
shops, and the charm of its
gardens. He would have
admired the wide variety of
occupations offered its in¬
mates in all, more than
forty trades were taught
there. But Montesinos' ma¬
jor innovation was his me¬
thod of individualized treat¬
ment. When an inmate
arrived at Valencia, he
underwent a detailed exami¬
nation of "his instincts, his
culture, his education and
his moral and religious
situation", and this study
continued until his release.
It was Montesinos who de¬
clared: "Tho crime remains
outside the door of this ins¬
titution; our mission is to
re-educate the man".
Cesare
Lontbroso
(1835-1909)
When Society had recog¬
nised that the insane were
not criminals, a delicate
question began to be posed:
were criminals, in many
cases, mentally abnormal?
The answer of Cesare Lom-
broso of Italy was that "the
criminal is more often a sick
man than a guilty one". A
psychiatrist and an anthro¬
pologist, Lombroso pleaded
that nations, instead of
passing hasty judgments,
should study "the human ac¬
tion called crime". This stu¬
dy, in his opinion, should not
be solely the business of jud¬
ges but should be entrusted
to specialists capable of exa¬
mining a criminal on the
basis of "climate, geography,
race, population density,
birth-rate, diet, alcoholism,
education, economy, religion
and, finally, the prison it¬
self." It was a demanding
programme. To Lombroso, a
crime was usually only the
act of an abnormal or a sick
person. Society's duty in
connection with crime,
therefore, should be only
concerned with "curing the
delinquent." "It is time,"
he declared, "that we change
our concept of the defence
of society to one of rehabili¬
tating the guilty man."
Franz von Liszt
(1815-1919)
One of the most illustrious
figures in criminal law, Franz
von Liszt was as illustrious
in science as was his cousin
in music. Liszt's life work
was the scientific foundation
and reform of criminal law.
He challenged the principle
of regarding punishment as
a reprisal and introduced
the method of investigating
the causes of crime. To¬
gether with G.A. ven Hamel
of Amsterdam and Adolphe
Prins of Brussels, he estab¬
lished in 1889 the Interna¬
tional Association of Crimi¬
nal Law (L'Union Interna¬
tionale de Droit Penal) . The
Association contended that
crime and punishment should
be considered as much from
a sociological as from a judi¬
cial point of view, and the
reforms it initiated became
the basis of modern criminal
law. Liszt's efforts is favour
of conditional sentence and
pardon as well as postpone¬
ment of punishment later
passed into practice.
