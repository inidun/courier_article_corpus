would draw their attention to social and
cultural issues instead of bombarding them
with Western pop culture,” says Ahamed.
The idea for a television network focu-
sing on env i r o n m e n t ,d e velopment and cul-
ture was first raised in a conference of South
Asian broadcasters in 1989, a proposal
which was welcomed by UN E S C O. But it
was the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 that
actually paved the way for setting up an
a l t e rn at i ve television unit.The Non-Gove rn-
mental Organizat i o n s ’ (NGO) forum at
Rio gave the mandate to the W I F, which has
been in the field of development commu-
nication in Asia since 1980.
The W I F, funded mostly by Norwe gi a n
and Swedish aid agencies, set up the netwo r k
in Colombo where it has  a full-fle d g e d
media centre.YATV was launched with an
initial investment of about $18 million. It is
a business enterp rise with 51 per cent ow n e d
by the WIF and 49 per cent by pri vate inve s-
t o rs , mostly multinational corp o r at i o n s.
For WIF, Asia was the obvious place to
launch an alternative network. Half of the
r e gi o n ’s three billion inhabitants are under
2 4 , hence the tremendous impact of televi-
sion. In addition, there were no television
n e t works or channels dedicated to pro-
grammes dealing with social and environ-
mental issues.
YATV started with one-hour we e k l y
p r o gr a m m e s , based mostly on inform at i o n
about developmental issues provided by
the United Nations and NGOs. In 1996 the
network started producing seven different
30-minute programmes broadcast each day,
focusing on a wide range of subjects.To d ay,
on ave r a g e , about 15 hours of YAT V ’s pro-
grammes are shown every week on terres-
t rial and satellite channels throughout
Asia—such as India’s Doordarshan Metro
( D D 2 ) , Pa k i s t a n ’s PTV Wo r l d , N e p a l ’s
NTV, Malaysia’s RTM, Bangladesh’s Ten
Network,Thailand’s ITV and Channel 5,
and Viet Nam’sVTV 2.
Despite this wide geographical spread
and with an estimated viewership of about
250 million people,YATV producers admit
that they have not yet conquered a mass
a u d i e n c e . Without a channel of its ow n ,
this will be diffic u l t . Recent surveys estimat e

Asia Television Netwo r k ’s (YATV) head-

one can find yo u n g s t e rs in casual clothes
occupying newsrooms and studios. In A s i a ’s
vast and expansive electronic media wo r l d ,
YATV may sound like one more television

tainment-only progr a m m e s.
Not so.The netwo r k ’s young crew is put-

“ YATV is a network for Asian yo u t h . O u r
motto is ‘infotainment and edutainment’.
It is a combination of education and infor-
m ation with a lot of entert a i n m e n t ,” s ay s
H i l my A h a m e d ,m a n a ging director of YAT V

S t a rted in 1995 by the Worldview Inter-
national Foundation (WIF) and some pri-

An estimated viewership
of 250 million people
The Asian satellite television boom in
the early 1990s opened up new opportu-
nities for many channels and companies
producing programmes for local
audiences, triggering a race for maximum
viewership. This eventually led to many
Asian television networks opting for the
shortcut method of making or buying
p r o grammes based only on entert a i n-
ment. According to YATV officials most
of these programmes lacked creativity and
imagination, and were simply imitations
of Western television programmes.
“There was a crying need for an alter-
n at i ve television, especially for yo u t h ,w h i c h

A young crew: recruited from across Asia, the network’s journalists and technicians are on average 24 years old.

t h at about 30 million Asians watch YAT V ’s
p r o gr a m m e s. “This is not a mass appeal
programme. We cater to a niche audience
wishing to see more meaningful and quali-
t at i ve programmes than watching Music
Television (MTV),” says Ahamed.
But even getting this far has not been a
smooth ride.YATV has had to battle with
giants like the STAR TV network and we l l -
established television companies from other
Asian countri e s. They soon realized that
only by being innovat i ve and different from
other playe rs could they gain viewe rs ,e s p e-
cially among youth.
To begin with,YATV recruited yo u n g s t e rs
without any experience in television journ a-
lism and trained them to make progr a m m e s.
To d ay, it manages a crew of about 120 yo u n g
media professionals drawn from va rious A s i a n
c o u n t ries—the average age being 24.
“We asked our young team members
w h at type of programmes they would like to
see and how they would go about making
them.This helped to develop a style of our
own,” says Ahamed.Apart from few high-
level positions, young people, between 18
and 25 handle editorial planning, r e s e a r c h ,
w riting and fil m i n g, making YATV a unique
television network in the region. In short,
these are programmes made by yo u n g
Asians for young Asians.
YATV programmes are characterized by
their fashionable and creat i ve camera wo r k ,
their animated and art i c u l ate presenters and
their extensive use of computer gr a p h i c s ,s t i l l
not ve ry common among many Asian pro-
d u c e rs. The Pan-Asian background of the
professionals is also an asset in making pro-
grammes that attract yong people from dif-
ferent countri e s.
But slick presentation aside, young vie-
we rs are attracted by Made-in-Asia qua-
lity programmes dealing with sustainable
d e ve l o p m e n t , wo m e n ’s rights and more
i m p o rtantly their own culture and tradi-
tions. “Previously no producer thought of
making programme series on Asian folk
music, dance and arts,” says Parthiban, a
23-year-old producer atYATV. Slowly but
surely YATV programmes have gained
p o p u l a ri t y. Within a year after its incep-
t i o n ,YATV gained entry into the top twe n t y
of Sri Lanka’s favourite programmes.
Advancing
the cause of women
N ature Calls is a popular YATV pro-
gramme now shown in many Asian coun-
t ri e s. It looks at environmental problems from
the rainforest of the Amazon to the plains of
Tanzanian Serengeti, from the peaks of the
H i m a l ayas to the coral reefs of the Maldive s.
The programme presents stories show i n g
our common heritage and highlights the need
for a balance between exploiting and conser-
ving resources.
A recent N ature Calls focused on
ancient irri g ation systems and organic fa r-
ming techniques practiced in the A s i a n
r e gion for centuri e s. It also discusses how
e c o - f riendly traditional fa rming techniques
could help to improve env i r o n m e n t a l
conditions in the regi o n . A feature on Eco-

Another popular progr a m m e , Space to

c o n c e rn to wo m e n , including educat i o n ,
e m p l oy m e n t , h e a l t h c a r e , s e x u a l i t y, r e p r o-
d u c t i ve ri g h t s ,a b o rt i o n , and discri m i n at o ry
practices like the dow ry system, a rr a n g e d

views and takes a firm stand against cert a i n
practices upheld in the name of tradition.
The YA Tri b e aims to celebrate A s i a ’s

ditional Asian musical forms and art i s t s , a s

Learning the ropes: over sixty YATV trainees have moved on to secure jobs with Asia’s major television networks.

In the past three ye a rs , young people from
N e p a l ,I n d i a ,B a n g l a d e s h , Pa k i s t a n ,M a l ay s i a
and the Philippines have trained and worked
alongside Sri Lankans at the production head-
q u a rt e rs in Colombo.After gaining a few ye a rs
e x p e rience at YAT V, trainees often move on
to other mainstream netwo r k s.To d ay, over 60
of its trainees have landed jobs in almost all
the major television networks in Asia.
“At YATV I feel that I am doing something
t h at has the potential to make a difference, t o
e m p owe r , to inform , to show that someone
c a r e s ,” s ays 22-year-old Robin Dav i d , a n
Indian media professional who produces YA
C a f é, a programme on Asian music, c o o k e ry
and fashion.
To ensure that programmes include content
from countries across the regi o n ,YATV has pro-
duction centres in Nepal, I n d i a ,B a n g l a d e s h
and Malay s i a , along with a network of stri n g e rs
in Pa k i s t a n ,T h a i l a n d , the Philippines and Sin-
g a p o r e .The programmes are mainly produced
in English and either dubbed or subtitled in dif-
ferent languages.
In addition, Pakistan Television’s satellite
s e rvices provide an Urdu ve rsion of the pro-
gramme N ature Calls to Bangladesh and the
Gulf Stat e s.V i j ay - T V, a satellite television
channel in southern India, broadcasts a Ta m i l
ve rsion of N ature Calls. An Astro Satellite T V
cable and satellite services provide Malay s i a
with Bhasa Malaysia and Tamil ve rsions of the
p r o gr a m m e I - Z o n e, dealing with youth issues.
YATV is about to make its debut in China.
Chinese Educational Television (CETV) has
a greed to broadcast YAT V ’s two progr a m m e s
on N ature and Culture.YATV officials say that
these programmes will be adapted to Chinese
v i e we rs.With the new deal the channel hopes
to broaden its audience substantially.
YATV mostly buys airtime from terr e s-
t rial and satellite networks preferably at pri m e
time in order to attract the largest possible
a u d i e n c e . Income is generated mainly by pro-
gramme sponsorship and adve rt i s i n g .S o m e
n e t works buy programmes directly or enter
into a cost-sharing or co-production arr a n-
gement with YAT V.
Recently organizations such as UNICEF,
the Asian Development Bank,S ave the Chil-
d r e n - N o r way and WHO have started spon-
s o ring programmes on children’s ri g h t s ,
d e m o c r a cy, sustainable development and
n at u r e .O p e r ating with an annual budget of
$3 million,YATV made modest gains for the
first time in 1999 and hopes to turn a gr e at e r
p r o fit this ye a r.
YATV recently started dealing with sen-
sitive political topics through programmes
on Sri Lanka’s long-drawn-out ethnic
c o n fli c t . S at h i ( Awareness) in Sinhala and
V i l i p p u ( Awakening) in Tamil are the net-
wo r k ’s responses to the perceived apat hy,
insensitivity and resignation of a large num-
ber of people to events in the country.P r o-
d u c e rs put the blame on a lack of awa r e n e s s
about the needs and experiences of those
most affected by war.
“It was not easy in the beginning as
h a r d - l i n e rs from both sides were not happy,”
s ays Sulochana Pe i ri s , a 26-year-old pro-
ducer in charge of Sathi.
Opening up
a dialogue
The two progr a m m e s , telecast nat i o n a l l y,
look at the need for initiat i ves to be taken by
both communities to achieve peace and
r e c o n c i l i ation in Sri Lanka.For the first time,
Sinhala viewe rs get the Tamil pers p e c t i ve of
the conflict through one programme while
the other gi ves Tamil viewe rs the Sinhalese
side to this 25-year-old saga.
“It has a good response from the yo u n g
p e o p l e .This is the reason why we want to
continue with it,” says Nimal Perera,news
director of the Talashine Network Ltd
(TNL),a private channel in Sri Lanka.
N ow YATV is looking beyond Asian bor-
ders. As a first step they want to produce a
s h ow called Planet A s i a, a compilation of its
best programmes,aimed atWestern coun-
t ri e s , to raise awareness among yo u n g
people of the issues facing their Asian peers.
YAT V ’s future plans include entering the
European ethnic television market.T h r o u-
ghout Europe there are many ethnic Asian
channels trying to cater to immigrant com-
munities.
With their success, do they hope to
fight Western culture? “No it was not our
aim. We know that it is difficult to fight
the likes of MTV culture,” says Ahamed.

The network makes extensive use of computer graphics, still a fairly rare practice in Asia.
