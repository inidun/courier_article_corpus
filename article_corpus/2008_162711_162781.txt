attained only gradually. 
Even now certain very pri-
mitive tribes, like the Nam-
bikwara of Central Brazil, 
just thrust the food they 
kill or gather (small ani-
mals and wild root-vegeta-
bles) indiscriminately into 
hot embers. The ashes that 
stick to it provide the 
necessary mineral salts. 
This primitive cooking is 
fatal to the sense of taste, 
for the palates of the Nam-
bikwara cannot cope with 
any strong stimulus; they 
have a horror of salt, and 
even of hot food; when I 
offered them a boiled – 
and boiling hot- dish, they 
drenched it with cold water 
before eating it. True this 
archaic attitude is excep-
t ional. Many peoples, 
however, suffer not from 
want of cooking ability but 
from a far more serious lack- that 
of the means of production- as a 
result of which they can hardly 
rely upon more than one type of 
food at a time.
Eating one’s fill
Ethnologists such as E.E. Evans-
Pritchard and  …
is to use the food as its own 
container, by stuffing the animal’s 
body, or flour-paste, with a mix-
ture which cooks while this outer 
cover grills or roasts.
Hot food? Horrors!
All these methods represent dis-
coveries to which the human race 
If, as has been said, the 
art of cooking is to 
combine flavours of diffe-
rent foodstuffs so as to 
blend or to bring out their 
contrasts, the process 
sounds simple enough to 
have been discovered by 
any one of the world’s peo-
ples. Yet this is not the 
case. It is not possible to 
combine different ingre-
dients unless they are 
easily and simultaneously 
to hand, nor can their fla-
vours be mingled and har-
mon i z e d  w i t hou t  a 
knowledge of cooking – 
one that goes further than 
the mere heating of food. 
Even the method of boi-
ling food in an earthenware 
pot is not universally 
employed. Some peoples, 
who have no pottery, bring 
food to the boil by putting it into 
a vessel made of wood or bark 
filled with water and then drop-
ping in heated stones. To other 
peoples, boiling is not known at 
all; they dig ovens in the ground 
and line them with hot stones, the 
food roasting slowly between 
layers of green leaves which give 
off moisture. Yet another method 
theSe CookS did not SPoil the broth
Did you know that for certain peoples, eating 
is an indecent act? They take their food in 
solitary confinement. In this April 1957 
Courier article, Lévi-Strauss ponders not only 
the social aspects of food, but also the human 
adventure of seeking out flavours.

history of cooking is the story of 
a search for means of making 
bread tasty, of creating and foste-
ring the appetite for a basic 
foodstuff – bread, rice, millet, 
maize or manioc, according to the 
region- which supplies energy but 
has little flavour. Meat came later; 
for a long time it was, and in 
many parts of the world it still is, 
a luxury reserved for the privi-
leged. The real foundation of 
 cooking throughout the 
world is carbohydrates enli-
vened by a condiment. 
Bread and onions, chapattis 
ad chutney, rice and sauce 
made from fermented fish; 
millet, maize or manioc 
with pimentos – all these 
are simply variations on a 
universal theme, on which 
the art of cooking has built 
up countless melodies.
Spices changed 
the world
The difficulties attending 
this quest of flavours are 
illustrated by the great sea 
voyages of the 16th cen-
tury, undertaken with what 
today seem the most trivial 
motives. Only some 400 
years ago, Europe was orga-
nizing those tremendous 
expedit ions chief ly for the 
purpose of obtaining spices. 
This marks the birth of cooking 
in Europe and, perhaps everywhere 
else as well, since no culinary 
style seems able to do without 
certain products of American 
origin, unknown elsewhere in the 
world before the discovery of the 
New World – potatoes, tomatoes, 
peanuts, chocolate,  …
origin; the inner glow produced by 
alcohol is for them a sign of anger, 
whereas they connect fasting with 
the highest spiritual emotions. “I 
feel like a young girl again, I’m so 
light hearted!” exclaimed one old 
African woman, on a day when she 
chanced to have eaten her fill. 
In the history of the human 
race there is a memorable, yet 
unknown day: the date when man 
discovered how to keep two diffe-
rent sources of nourishment at his 
disposal all the year round and, by 
combining them, overcame the 
two great dangers to his nourish-
ment- the scarcity of food and its 
insipidity. 
For to eat one’s fill is not 
enough. As a French proverb has 
shrewdly put it, one must not lose 
“the taste for bread”. The whole 
… Audrey Richards have des-
cribed how, in certain parts of 
Africa, the physical health and 
mental outlook of the native 
population are affected by the 
periodicity of foodstuffs. Many 
communities have enough to eat 
during only part of the year, when 
manioc, millet or rice is available. 
After these “fat months” come 
the “lean months”, when the 
people have only what they can 
collect at random. The 
daily meal shrinks in 
size and, still more 
important, a diet rich 
in carbohydrates is 
suddenly replaced by 
one consisting almost 
entirely of such vege-
tables as marrows and 
melons. 
We, with our well-
assured food-supply, 
can hardly imagine the 
intensity of the sensa-
tions resulting from 
this substitution. The 
feeling of repletion 
abruptly gives way to 
hunger-cramps. Violent 
diarrhoea succeeds the 
contrary discomfort of 
flatulence and intesti-
nal fermentation. 
The native population thus 
finds that both their bodies and 
their spirits are radically affected 
by changes in diet. As Audrey 
Richards has said with so much 
insight, it is not surprising that 
such communities regard food as 
perilous stuff, charged with every 
sort of magic influence. They the-
refore associate the sensations 
engendered by food with feelings 
to which we attribute a different

t he i r  mea l s  in  “so l i t a r y 
 confinement”, so as to conceal 
the “indecent” act of eating. Wri-
ting on the Kwakiutl, Boas descri-
bes the etiquette  …
A feast consists of 14 courses- 
rolls and wafers of maize in six 
different colours, various kinds of 
meat, offal, mutton sausages and 
blood pudding. All these are eaten 
with a meat- brush, a small, stiff-
bristled affair which is alternately 
thrust into the dish and sucked 
clean.
Shamed fish do not 
return
The consumption of food is a dis-
tinctly social affair. There are 
very few peoples who, like the 
Paressi of Central Brazil, take 
… vanilla and pimentos. 
A whole chapter of ethnology 
in fact, remains to be written. 
It would describe the character 
and geographical distribution 
of the rules – some very simple, 
others incredibly complex- for 
obtaining, treating, associa-
ting and mingling the various 
basic foodstuffs. It would 
reveal the Polynesians as the 
inventors of the soil-less agri-
culture, for some of these 
islanders succeeded in cultiva-
ting gardens on their coral 
reefs, in trenches filled with 
putrefied refuse: it would show 
that certain tribes, though 
extremely primitive in other 
respects, have performed the 
extraordinary feat of producing 
basic foodstuffs from poiso-
nous plants such as manioc and 
acorns. 
It would also show that cer-
tain primitive peoples have 
developed cooking that is full 
of subtleties. In one of his 
books on the Kwakiutl (inhabi-
tants of the North-West Coast 
of America), the distinguished 
American ethnologist F. Boas 
gives no less than 156 recipes for 
preparing various kinds of fish, 
fruit, and wild root-vegetables. 
One of these, chosen at random, 
consists in beating up snow until 
it has the consistence of whipped 
cream and then mixing it with 
fish-oil, molasses and uncooked 
berries. 
Under the descriptive title Zuni 
Breadstuffs, a book by another 
ethnologist, Cushing, gives a fas-
cinating account of the produc-
tion and preparing food in this 
Pueblo Indian tribe of New Mexico.

Multicoloured spices at Aswan market (Egypt, 2008).

come across  disconcerting ins-
tructions in native recipes, such 
as the following (originating with 
the Tsimshian Indians of the nor-
thwest Pacific coast), which I 
offer as food for thought to hou-
sewives, on concluding this brief 
in t roduc t ion  to  cu l ina r y 
ethnology. 
When fat is to be extracted 
from olachen, the fish are first 
dried in the open air. They are 
then boiled in vessels filled with 
… of a ceremonial feast: the 
culinary preparations, the arran-
gement of the different kinds of 
vessels and mats, 
the despatch of 
messengers with 
the inv itat ions 
(which must be 
refused several 
times before final 
acceptance), the 
songs in honour of 
the guests, and the 
bestowal on each 
of them of a spe-
cially selected por-
tion, befitting his 
rank. 
There is nothing 
to surprise us in all 
this; Kwakiutl eti-
quette is not so different from our 
own formal dinners. We too honour 
our guests with embroidered 
cloths, silver plates and with 
choice dishes. But our cooks, 
unlike the tribal ones, have for-
gotten what was once an essential 
rite –that of doing honour to the 
animals about to be eaten, so that 
their species may not vanish from 
the earth. Thus we sometimes 

water into which stones heated in 
the fire are dropped, the fat being 
skimmed off as it rises to the sur-
face. The remainder of 
the fish is afterwards 
spread on a sieve 
above some recipient, 
and an old woman 
presses it to her naked 
breast as hard as she 
can, to squeeze out 
the rest of the fat 
(men are strictly for-
bidden to perform this 
degreasing operation). 
The cakes of fish 
are then heaped up in 
a corner of the hut, 
where they lie rotting 
until they swarm with 
maggots. Despite the 
intolerable stench, they must not 
be thrown away. Moreover, none 
of the “cooks” concerned is 
allowed to wash; every one must 
remain covered with filth until 
the end of the proceedings, which 
may last for two or three weeks. 
Otherwise the f ish would be 
“ashamed” and would never come 
back again. 
