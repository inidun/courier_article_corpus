Samia Wadie Hannah
began her working life at
the age of five helping her father
collect garbage in the streets of
Cairo. She never went to school
and remained unable to read until
she enrolled in an adult literacy
class run by the priest of her local
Coptic church. Later she gained a
¡primary school diploma by corre¬
spondence. She now works as a
supervisor for an environmental
association in Cairo.
A few years ago an immigrant
from a Pacific rim nation came to
Houston, Texas with almost no
English and little understanding
of American culture. He enrolled
at San Jacinto College, a two-year
community college where he
learned the basics of English and
acquired an understanding of life
in the United States. He went on to
take a series of degrees, culminat¬
ing in a Ph 1) from the Massachu¬
setts Institute of Technology. He is
now a successful scientist.
Kerstin Ilerz-Ilabbert grew
up in Montabaur, Germany, where
her father was a heating
mechanic. After leaving school she
did an internship with a newspa¬
per hoping to become a journal¬
ist. Failing to find a journalistic
job, she trained as an office assis¬
tant in a ¡public relations firm,
where she was very unhappy. At
the age of twenty-three she
decided to go to university. Sup¬
ported by her ¡parents, various
grants and a ¡part-time job in the
Post Office, she completed six
years at the Universities of Hei¬
delberg and Hamburg and
emerged with an MA in German
literature, sociology and ¡peda¬
gogy. She now ¡plans to study for a
doctorate in literature.
These three people experi¬
enced a ¡profound change in their
lives because of the educational
opportunities offered to them as
adults. Millions of people all over
the world are at this moment
engaged in some form of educa¬
tion, but millions more are denied
that opportunity. Huge reserves
of human potential remain locked
away, unrealized. A new global
effort is needed if this potential is
to be released.
Against this backdrop, over
1,500 delegates from all over the
world are gathering for UlSESCO's
Fifth International Conference on
Adult Education (COFINTEA),
which is being held from 14 to 18
July in Hamburg, Germany (see
box). The conference will address
a wide range of adult education
issues, including the following.
WORK AND EMPLOYMENT
The world of work is changing
rapidly and dramatically. Tech¬
nology is developing at e\ er-inercas-
ing speed, industry is continually
seeking greater efficiency, global
competition is intensifying, and
secure jobs are becoming a rarity.
The British sociologist Charles
Handy believes that in a few years
time (inns in some industrialized
countries will be cutting their work
force by half, ¡paying staff twice
as much and obtaining three times
the ¡productivity. Wholesale clo-

worldwide commitment to lifelong learning is needed to release huge
reserves of unrealized human potential

The Fifth International Conference
on Adult Education
"Adult learning: a key for the 21st century" is the motto of Unesco's Fifth
International Conference on Adult Education (COFINTEA), which is taking place
from 14 to 18 July in Hamburg (Germany). The Conference, organized by Unesco
with a number of international partners, is continuing the work of four earlier
Unesco adult education conferences: Elsinore (Denmark, 1949), Montreal (Canada,
1960), Tokyo (Japan, 1972) and Paris (France, 1985).
A major part of the discussions at Hamburg will focus on the theme of
democracy, i.e. making access to education more democratic and promoting
democracy through education. This theme links with that of promoting a culture
of peace and mutual understanding-something that is more necessary than ever
in a world where nationalities and linguistic and ethnic communities are
increasinglyinterpenetrating one another.
The most immediate outcome of the Conference will be two documents: a
Declaration on Adult Learning, in the form of a broad policy manifesto; and an
Agenda for the Future, containing a series of more detailed proposals.

launched a massive educational
¡programme costing £3!) million
¡pounds a year, offering employ¬
ees not only job-related training
but also grants to study whatever
subject they wished, from poetry
to guitar-playing. The outcome
was that annual revenue per
employee went up from £31,000
in 1989 to £122,000 in 1994
the result of a more motivated,
flexible and creative work force.
LITERACY
Approximately one billion adults
worldwide are unable to read and
write. A recent survey revealed
that even some of the world's rich¬
est nations have a high ¡percentage
of adidts whose literacy is below
the level of a ¡primary school leaver:
approximately 20 per cent in the
United Slates, 16 ¡per cent in
Canada, 15 per cent in Germany
and 10 per cent in the Nether¬
lands. This means that many adults
in these countries arc unable to fill
out correctly an application form

for a job, understand a simple bar
chart or read a bus timetable, let
alone compete in an increasingly
difficult labour market.
In the developing world the
problem is even more acute. One
developing country that has taken
this message to heart is India,
which is spending a massive 8 per
cent of its education budget on
adult literacy, reaching 50 mil¬
lion people every ) ear.
THE ENVIRONMENT,
MINORITIES AND GROUPS
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
The ¡protection of the environment
demands the active ¡participation
of informed and empowered citi¬
zens world-wide. This in turn calls
for raising people's awareness and
knowledge whether about solar
energy, recycling or rain forest
protection. Yet in spite of a num¬
ber of inspiring exceptions, envi¬
ronmental education has remained
until now a regrettably marginal
field. In Germany, for example,
only 1.5 ¡>er cent of adult educa¬
tion courses deal with this theme.

Many groups and communities
receive much less than their fair
share of educational opportuni¬
ties. This applies to women all over
the world. Another category con¬

migrants in the world today who
have been forced to leave their
homeland because of war, perse¬

are often excluded from regular
schools in their host countries and
grow up into under-educated and
therefore marginalized adults.

DEMOCRACY AND
A CULTURE OF PEACE
"in a community of many cultures
the interchange between them is
very important," says Justin Ellis,
Under Secretary for Adult Educa¬
tion, Libraries and Culture in
Namibia. "Often it is easier to do
this in non-verbal ways, such as
through music, dancing, theatre and
crafts. In our programmes we try to
combine education and culture."
At the same time it is neces¬
sary to question the nature and pur¬
pose of education itself. This

tures and languages on those who

MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGIES
FOR EDUCATION
Radio and television have long
been used in distance learning.
Now videos, interactive compact
discs and the Internet are ¡proving
to be immensely valuable educa¬
tional tools. The Internet has also
opened up vast ¡possibilities for
education, and its potential has
only just begun to be exploited.
With an Internet link it should
eventually be possible for some¬
one to take anything from a liter¬
acy course to a study programme
in advanced engineering. Already
there are courses where students
link up via the Net to hold regular
"virtual reality seminars" and to
carry out joint study projects.
However, there are serious
drawbacks to the Internet. For
vast areas of the developing world
access to it is either non-existent
or limited, and where it exists it is
often too costly for most citizens.
On the other hand, if the Inter¬
net becomes more widely used,
there is a real danger that it will
be an instrument for transferring
the values, languages and cultural
norms of the industrialized North.
Even with a full connection, it is
difficult to use the Net system¬
atically for educational purposes.
Those who attempt to do so are
often overwhelmed by the sheer
chaotic multiplicity of informa¬
tion that surges back and forth
over the information highway.
In the twenty-first century the
¡public must learn to become
active, critical and discriminating
users of the media. In ibis way
they will resist ¡political and com¬
mercial manipulation and be able
to use the media intelligently for
educational purposes. M
