Healthy
housing
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
r Although indoor pollution is
often overlooked, it directly
orindireetly affects the health of a
broad spectrum of people, from
those living in mud huts to those
whose homes are in modern sky¬
scrapers. This pollution can come
from three different sources: out¬
door air pollution (whose planetary
impact was described in our Decem¬
ber 1997 issue); building materials;
and the activities of occupants.
A healthy home must he
designed to protect its inhabitants
from extremes of cold and heat, rain,
noise, dust, insects, and rodents. It
must he constructed on a well-
drained site, and have access to run¬
ning water and a waste-disposal sys¬
tem. Overcrowding should be
avoided to reduce the risk of conta¬
gious diseases. Neither the heating
system nor the cooking facilities
should give off noxious fumes.
Unfortunately, not everyone living in
the Third World or in industrialized
countries lives in these conditions.
The very poor have to make do with
insalubrious shelters on the edges
of cities and endure a range of dif¬
ferent kinds of pollution.
Another situation that is often
overlooked, although it is very com¬
mon, is that where the home is also
a workplace. In such cases, the use
and storage of toxic or dangerous
chemical substances needs to he
reviewed in order to make sure that
people are better protected. In addi¬
tion, the stress caused by the cost of
housing, insecurity of tenure, and
the threat of expulsion when a home
is being illegally occupied, can have
an important hearing on mental
health.
A POLLUTED ENVIRONMENT
In industrialized countries where cur¬
rent standards arc well respected,
these risks arc generally very low.

Architects arc closely concerned with
the structure of buildings and with
the quality of building materials. The
World Health Organization (WHO)
nevertheless observes that in these
countries, "the advent of air condi¬
tioning and energy conservation mea¬
sures have been accompanied by
growing problems of indoor air qual¬
ity. . . . Some pollutants arise from
insulation products, some from
kerosene heaters, and others from
modern housing materials. As many
Kuropeans spend up to 90% of their
lives in buildings, the health effects
of the indoor climate are significant."
Some construction materials,
including fihreboard, insulation
foams and certain glues (for carpets or
nigs, for example), emit organic prod¬
ucts such as formaldehyde. Heat and
humidity increase formaldehyde
emissions and the gas seriously irri¬
tates the eyes. Paint, lacquer, varnish
and other resins can also release
volatile organic compounds into
indoor air.
In 1976, members of the Ameri¬
can Legion, an organization of U.S.
war veterans, met in an air-condi¬
tioned hotel in Philadelphia. More
than 200 of them came down with
pneumonia and 34 of them died.
Later, the bacteria that caused their
deaths was identified and named
Legionella pne.umophyla. These

bacteria proliferate in humid areas,
in toilets, and poorly maintained
bathrooms. Steps can he taken to
prevent what became known as
Legionnaire's Disease by means of
simple hygiene measures, starting
with very careful, regular cleaning
of sanitary appliances.
The land on which buildings are
sited may also contribute to pollu¬
tion. Some kinds of granite or similar
rocks contain traces of radium. As it
breaks down, this naturally radioac¬
tive element produces radon, a
radioactive gas that seeps through
tiny cracks in walls, porous floors
and building materials, and makes
its way into home interiors. The bet¬
ter the homes arc insulated, the
more the gas accumulates. Radon's
main affect on health is to increase
the risk of lung cancer. Ten years
ago in the United States, radon panic
made radon detection all the rage.

technicians, even in areas where
there was no danger whatsoever!
THE RAVAGES OF ASBESTOS
Construction materials can cause
serious damage, especially when
they contain asbestos. Asbestos is
naturally present in rock formations
worldwide. It belongs to a family of
mineral substances composed of
solid, non-combustible fibres. These

properties make asbestos a highly
sought-after construction material.
Its production and commercial use
began in the Western world at the
turn of the century and became very
widespread after World War II. As
early as 1931, however, public
health officers in the United King¬
dom revealed the connection
between inhaling asbestos dust and
respiratory diseases (asbestosis, lung
cancer).
Asbestos workers were, the first
to be affected. Professor Bignon, a
French lung specialist, claims that
no epidemiological study has so far
proven incontrovcrtibly that there
is a link between lung cancer and
exposure to rooms where asbestos
has been used. Nevertheless, pre¬
cautionary measures should be
taken to eliminate asbestos as
quickly as possible from buildings
(as has been done at UNESCO Head¬
quarters in Paris), and especially
from rooms used by children.
New Caledonia offers an inter¬
esting case in point. The island's
inhabitants suffer from a very high
incidence of pleural cancer, a rare
form of asbestos-related cancer that
affects the moist membrane lining
the chest cavity and surrounding the
lungs. This cancer seems unrelated
to any industrial activity, however.
The French National Institute for
Health and Medical Research
(INSERM) carried out an investiga¬
tion which determined that a white
plaster coating, called pö, used by
the Kanak tribes to protect the walls
of their homes, was toxic. The plas¬
ter is produced locally from a
crumbly rock that turned out to he
a form of asbestos. Pö was very
widely used from the 1930s onwards
when the colonial authorities
encouraged indigenous Caledonians
to replace their traditional branch
and leaf huts with mud-walled
houses on the grounds that these
were more hygienic. The affected
dwellings must be identified and a
new technique developed to elimi¬
nate the asbestos from the mud
walls.

Fuego, Chagas' disease, also known
as sleeping sickness or American try¬
panosomiasis, affects 18 million peo¬
ple and threatens 100 million more.
First described at the turn of the
century in Brazil by Carlos Chagas,
this parasitic disease is transmitted
to humans by a trypanosome carried
by blood-sucking bugs of the lledu-
viidae family. In Brazil it is respon¬
sible for one in every ten deaths
among 25- to 64-year-olds. The lar¬
vae live in the crev ices of walls and in
the dust of poor rural dwellings, and
they thrive particularly well in
warm, moist areas. Plastering the
walls and regularly spraying them
with insecticide would solve the
problem, but this solution is too
expensive.
Lead poisoning is another illness
linked to the age and decrepitude of
housing. Paint in old buildings eon-
tains a great deal of lead. Children
swallow some of this when they
break off bits of peeling paint and
put them in their mouths. This type
of poisoning also affects people who
drink water which has remained in
lead piping for some length of time.
Children with lead poisoning have
behaviour problems and perform
poorly in school.
The gas and smoke given off by
fuels used in homes can also prove
dangerous. When coal burns in an
open or poorly designed fireplace or
in badly ventilated rooms, it gives
off dense toxic fumes, particularly
of sulphur dioxide. In cold regions
such as the Himalayas, the high¬
lands of Papua New Guinea and cer¬
tain Chinese provinces, families are
exposed to smoke from open

hearths. Heating stoves can also pro¬
duce indoor pollution. Oil-fired
stoves give off nitrogen oxide and
carbon monoxide. Biomass fuels,
such as wood, animal dung and agri¬
cultural waste produce hundreds of
highly carcinogenic chemical com¬
pounds. This problem ran only be
solved by using efficient smoke-
extraction methods and providing
adequate ventilation.
