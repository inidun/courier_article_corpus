The d o t . b o m b s y n d ro m e
Everyone agrees that privacy is good for business. But is there a market
for companies offering to protect it?
W
hile several firms have recently suf-
fered class-action lawsuits and public
outrage over apparent intrusions
into customers’ personal data,
American Express is one of a
number of businesses that may be blazing the right
path from privacy to profit s.
Last year, the credit card issuer rolled out
“Private Payments,” enabling its customers to go
online and obtain “ D i s p o s a b l e ” credit card numbers
that could be used for only one online purchase. If
the number was ever stolen after being used for a
purchase, it would be worthless.
A key lesson is that protecting privacy, in this
case the credit card number,became an “ e n h a n c e d
value”to an existing service. Moreover,American
Express understood that the credit card number
was the “tip of the privacy iceberg”—it plans to
roll out a suite of related services, like anonymous
Internet browsing, in 2001. Rival companies, like
Visa/Mastercard,are following the same trail.
Another company to watch is PrivaSys, of San
Fr a n c i s c o,which has patented technology to enable
plastic credit cards to generate disposable num-
bers for each purchase.
PrivaSys does this by
equipping the card with a
c a l c u l a t o r-styled key pad
and LCD screen, a very
thin battery, and a special
magnetic stripe. The card-
holder punches a 4-digit
PIN into the credit card
itself and—v o i l à !—the card
generates the disposable
number.
But securing payments
is just one part of an emer-
ging privacy protection
m a r k e t . Other firms are
offering anonymous or
“ p s e u d o n y m o u s ”b r o w s i n g
t o o l s, packages to control
cookies—the strings of
code that are planted on
the user’s computer by
websites—and services to
block hacker intrusion.
Only time will tell which
companies will control niche markets or achieve cri-
tical mass.
Wh a t ’s clear is that the nascent e-commerce
industry badly miscalculated the importance of pri-
vacy to their business model. For without privacy,
there was no consumer confid e n c e, and without
such confid e n c e,e-commerce had no chance of ful-
filling the short-term, high expectations that ini-
tially sent their stock values soaring. The current
shake-out of the “dot.bomb” industry shows how
costly this miscalculation over privacy was.
An added but
essential value
But if you thought privacy was a big issue for e-
c o m m e r c e, consider the debate on the wireless
i n d u s t r y.Referred to as Mobile or M-commerce, t h i s
industry appears to have unlimited potential to
deliver information and location-based services,
advertisements, and discount coupons to cellular
phones and hand-held wireless devices. M - c o m-
merce risks hitting the major “ p r i v a cy buttons”:
constant surveillance via location-based tracking;
unsolicited ads clogging communications devices;
detailed profiles of individuals’ interests and move-
ments;and insecure payment mechanisms.
Nonetheless, the industry is showing signs that
it has learned from the mistakes of e-commerce.A
few months ago at a workshop of the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, leading wireless industry groups
unveiled guidelines requiring companies to obtain
a consumer’s consent before collecting or using
personal data. This wasn’t altruism: the industry
understands that consumers will not tolerate com-
mercial services to their cell phones unless they
explicitly consent.
So far, privacy’s brief tenure in the commercial
marketplace indicates that some people are willing
to pay extra to protect their privacy. But the more
important lesson is that consumers are unlikely to
take more than a few extra steps to secure their data.
If they perceive that a given medium, like the
I n t e r n e t , is not privacy - f r i e n d l y, they either change
their habitual uses or actually refrain from them
altogether.
The likelihood is that privacy will become an
“added value,”creating a market for those who can
integrate privacy into payment mechanisms without
excessively burdening the consumer. ■
