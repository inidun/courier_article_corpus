AGE LADDER OF RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS
This comparative table, drawn up by the "Unesco Courier", shows the legal minimum age established in
48 countries for marriage, civil majority (generally defined as the age at which parental authority ceases),
criminal responsibility and the right to vote. Where the minimum age for marriage given is lower than the
age of civil majority, this means that parents consent to the marriage is still required. It will be noted that
there is still often a discrepancy between the minimum voting age and the age of criminal responsibility,
that is to say the age at which, in criminal proceedings, young people are considered as adults.

opportunities and facilities, by law and
by other means, to enable him to
develop physically, mentally, morally,
spiritually and socially in a healthy
and normal manner and in conditions
of freedom and dignity."
Children, the Declaration adds,
should also enjoy the benefits of
social security, adequate nutrition,
housing, recreation and medical ser¬
vices. Special protection should also
be provided for the child's mother,
"including adequate pre-natal and
post-natal care." The child who is
physically, mentally or socially handi¬
capped should be given the special
treatment, education and care required.
The Declaration proclaims that
children need love and understanding
for the full and harmonious develop¬
ment of their personalities and should,
wherever possible, grow up in the care
of their parents. It also declares that
State and other assistance toward the
maintenance of children of large
families is desirable.

officially, of paternal or parental
authority was fixed until recently at

twenty-one. This has now been
lowered by law in quite a number of
countries to twenty or even eighteen
years of age. Furthermore, the
inquiry carried out by Unesco has
revealed the interesting fact that the
legislation of all the countries studied
sets even lower minimum ages at which
young people have the right to perform
certain acts independently.
Minimum age for marriage. In nearly
all the countries studied, young people
may marry before attaining the age of
majority generally twenty-one. But
in the Socialist countries the minimum
age for marriage coincides as a rule
with the age of majority, which is fixed
at eighteen. In Chile, too, the two ages
coincide at twenty-one, while in Den¬
mark the minimum age for marriage is
the same as the age of majority
(twenty) but this only applies to boys.
Generally speaking, the minimum age
for marriage is lower for girls than
for boys. In some countries young
people can get married even before
reaching the minimum legal age if
special permission is obtained from
the judicial or administrative auth¬
orities. Such permission, which is
usually granted in grave circumstances,
especially in the event of pregnancy,
can be requested by young people of
either sex (in Denmark, the Nether¬
lands, Czechoslovakia, U.S.A., etc.) or
by girls only (in Romania, Singapore,
Laos, etc.).
The minimum legal age of marriage
for boys and girls in different countries
is given in the table on page 26.
Parent's consent. Young people may
not marry before attaining their
majority without the consent of their
father and mother or of the person
exercising parental authority.
In Belgium young people who have
attained their majority, are required,
up to the age of twenty-five, to consult
their father and mother before getting
married.
In Monaco, young people who have
attained their majority are required,
up to the age of thirty, to produce
evidence of their parent's consent.
These requirements are pure for¬
malities, but it is noteworthy that they
have not yet been abrogated
In Algeria, under Islamic law, women
may not make the decision to marry
of their own accord, even after they
have attained their majority.
