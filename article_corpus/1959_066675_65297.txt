THE MUSEUM INSIDE
THE RECEIVER
Every Monday after the evening
meal, thousands of people in the
Netherlands turn on the radio
and go on a guided tour of some of
the art masterpieces in their country's
great museums. The guides on these
broadcast tours are prominent art
connoisseurs, museum directors or
art historians who tell listeners about
the origin of a particular work, the
significance of its composition and
beauty, about the artist who made it,
its period of origin and so on.
Gathered around the radio, families
(left) follow the talks with the aid
of a reproduction of the work being
presented. Well over 90,000 people
joined the "art by radio" club last
year. In return for a small fee sub¬
scribers receive in advance four
reproductions of the works to be
discussed every month colour repro¬
ductions of paintings,, reproductions
in black and white of drawings,
sculpture, graphic wofk and an
occasional example of applied work.
Works are selected to offer charac¬
teristic examples of alternately old
and contemporary artists such as
Rembrandt's "The Return of the
Prodigal Son" (below left) and
"Portrait of the Artist's Wife" by
Paul Citroen of the Netherlands
(opposite page)-. Subscribers also re¬
ceive texts of the broadcast commen¬
taries and special binders which
enable them to assemble at each
year's end a personal collection of
40 reproductions and related texts.
This project, now a firm favourite
on the Netherlands Radio network,
was started by a group of art
historians and artists who founded
a non-profit organization called
Openbaar Kunstbezit (Our Art Heri¬
tage) which arranges the broadcasts.
This form of museum visiting at
home has proved a real boon to many
who are too old to travel, to the sick
and those who live in isolated places.
Subscriptions cover schools, sanatoria,
hospitals (opposite page, below) youth
welfare centres and even prisons.
Members are also provided with a
free pass giving them access to over
50 museums in the Netherlands.
Museum attendance has risen by an
estimated 50,000 to 60,000 since the
broadcasts began, and for days after
some broadcasts many people can be
seen studying the original of the
work of art presented over the air.
Through the letters it receives, the'
Foundation has regular confirmation
that its work is opening the door to
art and culture for many people. An
82-year-old listener recently wrote:
"You do more than television, for
besides the voice you give us the
colours and the image is not gone
when the programme ends. My
album remains my treasured pos¬
session to which I turn again and
again."
