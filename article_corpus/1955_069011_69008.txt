The traveller arriving for the first
time in Bombay is struck by an
impression of lavish luxury side
by side with the poorest kind of slums.
And he will probably ask himself how
many of the people in the well-to-do
neighbourhoods know or care about the
uprooted masses living nearby. For
my part, I thought of the week-end
work camps organized in the Paris
suburbs by the Service Civil Interna¬
tional, and of the many American
Friends Service Committee camps in
the poorer quarters of New York and
Chicago.
But it was not long before I learned
that in Bombay, as
in other big cities,
there are groups of
people who do know
and who do care.
They are doing
something about it,
too, and on a much
larger scale than
any work camps in
Europe or in the
United States. They
belong to Rashtra
3eva Dal, and their
work squads known
as Sane Guruji Sevf.
Patak go into the
slums, in teams some
10 to 30 strong,
to launch clean-up
campaigns and ini¬
tiate people into
the fundamentals of
health, sanitation
and child care.
Followers of Gandhi,
they use drama and
music to get their
points across, and
their shows draw
thousands on public
squares.
But Rashtra Seva
Dai's main task is
the improvement of
conditions in rural
areas where 80 %
of India's popula¬
tion live. I got my
first glimpse of this
work at Hadaspar,
not far from Poona,
where 3,000 volun¬
teers (550 of them .
women), were "bunding" on a co¬
operative farm formed by small land¬
holders whose plots are too minute to
be worked individually.
Bunding, I learned, means digging
the earth and heaping it into long
dikes to protect the crops from the sun
and wind. The volunteers in the camp
came from all walks of life students,
farmers, engineers, architects, doctors,
teachers, craftsmen and shop-keepers.
Not many Indian work camps,
however, are as large as this. Usually,
they consist of 20 to 30 selected
volunteers, as in the case of Taranagar,
near Hyderabad. There, I joined a
group of students working with the
villagers to lay the ' foundations of a
library and to rebuild the local
teacher's living quarters. When the
students first came to Taranagar, three
years ago, the villagers asked them to
repair a ruined temple, inhabited by a
huge cobra. The students and the
peasants cleared the underbrush from
the temple, killed the snake and
converted the ruined building into a
community centre.
Since then, every year, Hyderabad
students spend their vacations carrying
out projects suggested by the villagers.
A school has been opened and a teacher
found for it, a market built, and a
major road repaired. Hyderabad's
Health Department helped to spray
mud huts with DDT and to distribute
anti-malaria pills. Soakage pits, com¬
post heaps and smokeless cholas
(stoves) were built. A co-operative
was opened in 1954, and this year,
chapaties (India's wheat pancake
bread), vegetables, curry and curds in
a bamboo hut covered with mats and
plastered with mud and cow-dung.
During the meal, dozens of villagers on
their way to a nearby temple, stopped
in and said "hello". They all glanced
at our plates and probably were pleased
to note that the international cuisine
was no different from their own.
Ingrid, the camp housemother, who
is a trained nurse, knew many of these
people. Their wives often came to look
at her kitchen with its stove burning
waste wood instead of cow-dung. Any
new "home appliance" always drew a
crowd. Besides, it was Ingrid who kept

It is a long trek from Hyderabad to
the Service Civil International camp at
Matras in the State of Bihar which
had suffered terribly during the floods
of August 1954. Many villages were
still isolated from the outside world
and when I left the railway station at
Dharbanga, I had to wade over paddy
fields for nearly three-quarters of an
hour, with water up to my knees and a
heavy suitcase on my shoulders, heart¬
ily wishing I had carried a rucksack
instead.
At Matras, a village of 1,100 inhabi¬
tants, the project consisted of re¬
building the school which had been
washed away, and also of constructing
a "Govardham" or earth platform to
shelter the villagers and their cattle
in the event of another flood. The
villagers were giving one day a week
of voluntary labour to work with the
international team consisting of two
Indians, a Pakistani, a Swiss, a French¬
man and a German girl.
After hauling baskets of earth all
the morning, we had our lunch of

went by, she had to institute visiting
hours for her dispensary so as not to

national team had become a demons¬
tration in fundamental education.
As we finished our meal, we were
startled by an unusual uproar outside
the hut. The mud platform at the
back was swarming with teen-agers in
"dhotis" and shorts. More than two
hundred of them had come with their
teacher to help.
Soon the schoolboys were digging
lumps of earth with whatever they
could find and, forming a human
chain, passing the big chunks up to the
platform. By the end of the afternoon
the results of their work were very
visible they had not lost a minute
and they returned to Dharbanga,
walking and wading all over again.
This example is a good illustration
of the great possibilities of small work
camp groups in India. They can
induce thousands of young people to
work on community service projects in
a country where manual labour is still
regarded in many circles as degrading.

Unesco Courier. N" 6. 1955
In India, a tradition going back to
the Vedic age, once made it a duty for
every individual to give certain services
to his community: "Gyandan" the
gift of knowledge; "Dhanda" the gift
of wealth; and "Shramdan" the gift
of labour. Every physically fit man
had to make this gift of labour at least
once in his lifetime.
Gandhi, who coined the phrase
"work is worship", revived these
ancient traditions, and, more recently,
Vinoba Bhave initiated a new move-
. ment the "Bhoodan" or land gift
which may set off an economic revo¬
lution.
Many who have studied these
movements believe that Shramdan and
Bhoodan herald a renaissance that
will not halt at India's borders, but
will spread to all South-East Asia. In
any event, Shramdan and Bhoodan
have become magic words in India.
When on leaving Matras I took the
train at Dharbanga, one of my fellow
passengers stared at me and said to his
neighbour in Hindi: "He's one of the
Shramdan wallahs. I saw him working
with the others." A hush came over
the carriage, but it was soon broken by
questions about the work, the volun¬
teers and the camp. Several young¬
sters announced that they would go to
Matras with their friends to work. A
little later, I changed trains, but my
new fellow travellers were equally
interested, and two men told me: "We
want to devote a year to this work."
Last December, the Kosi Area Bharat
Seva Samaj (a voluntary service asso-

ciation) wired India's Ministry of
Irrigation and Power in Delhi that
local citizens had decided to begin work
on eight miles oí the eastern Kosi
embankment.
This telegram may mark the
beginning of a new phase of local
participation in India's development
programme. The Kosi Valley Project
is a multi-purpose dam on the lines of
Tennessee Valley Authority. It will
not only control floods on the wild
Kosi river racing from its source in
Nepal to the Ganges valley, but will
also furnish irrigation water and elec¬
tric power.
In India, where power machinery is
often not available, the speed with
which large-scale projects are complet¬
ed depends on public co-operation.
And this is where work camps have an
important part to play. If the millions
who live in the valleys of the Kosi and
the Ganges can be awakened and
encouraged to co-operate, they will do
the job of a thousand bull-dozers and
they will know that they are working
for themselves.
The Kosi project was worked out by
the Indian Planning Commission in
co-operation with the Nepalese Govern¬
ment. Thus, Indian voluntary work
camps will have their first chance of
action on an international scale.
In India itself, the scope of their
work is ever increasing. Last year,
the Co-ordination * Committee for
International Voluntary Work Camps
estimated the total number of camps
in India to be nearly 450. In 1955, the
number of camps will be at least 1,000
with a total of some 50,000 volunteers.
To staff these camps, a training centre
for leaders was started near Delhi
early "in 1955, while other leader
training courses have been organized
in Hyderabad and Bangalore.
