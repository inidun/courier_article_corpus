In 1969, the Italian semiologist Umberto Eco pre-
sented Mafalda to Europe with these words:
“Since our children are soon to become through
our choice a multitude of Mafaldas, it would be
rash not to treat Mafalda with the respect a real
person deserves.” But who is this six-year-old girl
whose name has been given to a square, who was
on the verge of being named an Illustrious Citizen
of Buenos Aires and was chosen as one of the 10
most influential Argentine women of the 20th cen-
t u ry? “The important thing is not what I think of
Mafalda, but what Mafalda thinks of me,” said the
writer Julio Cortazar about this irreverent little girl
who worships the Beatles, hates soup, and is con-
cerned about the Cold War and the health of Planet
Earth. Mafalda shares her concerns with her
parents, who she never ceases to ply with
impertinent questions (“Have you tw o
planned our education or are you just
making it up as you go along?”), and with
her brother Guille, the personification of
childish innocence. The gang is rounded
off by the materialistic Manolito (son of the local
shopkeeper who dreams about owning a chain of
supermarkets), the timid romantic Felipe (who is
always looking for excuses not to got to school),
the narcissistic Miguelito, Susanita
(who hopes to be a housewife and
the mother of a large family), and
Libertad, the smallest of them all.
“I drew her like that beca u s e
freedom always seems small,”
recalls Quino. ■

How would you define your brand of humour?
I don’t think my cartoons are the sort
t h at make people laugh their heads off. I
tend to use a scalpel rather than tickle the
ri b s. I don’t go out of my way to be humor-
o u s ; i t ’s just something that comes out of
m e .I ’d like to be funnier,but as you get older
you become less amusing and more incisive .
Your books have been published to great acclaim
in France, Greece, Italy, China and Portugal. Does
this mean that humour is universal?
I think so. Local connotations vary of
course,above all in political humour. But



QUINO, ON THE FUNN Y
SIDE OF FREEDOM
“I don’t believe humour can alter anything, but sometimes it can be the little grain of sand that acts as a ca talyst to change,” says Argentine
cartoonist Joaquín Salvador Lavado, better known as Quino, who has been hailed as “the greatest Latin American cartoonist of the century. ”
Born in Mendoza in 19 32, he never wanted to be anything but a cartoonist and has spent a lifetime at the drawing board. He won an inter-
national reputation with his Mafalda series (see box), which shows the adult world as seen through the eyes of children. Its main chara c t e r ,
an inquisitive girl who is always asking awkward questions and worries about world peace, has featured in ten books, which have been tra n s-
lated into over 20 languages and published in newspapers and magazines in many parts of the world. Burnt out by the pressure of having to
come up with new ideas every week, Quino decided to stop drawing Mafalda in 1973, and spend more time on other projects that give free
rein to the caustic humour that has always been his hallmark. Meticulously executed in black and white and packed with telling details, his
d rawings focus on power relationships, social inequalities and environmental degradation. In short, on all kinds of issues that, as he readily
admits, “have nothing funny about them.”
a joke can be just as relevant to Franco’s
Spain as to Fidel’s Cuba or the military
r e gimes of Latin A m e ri c a . As for jokes
about food, the kind of things we say
about meat in Argentina can be trans-
posed to rice in Japan. I’ve heard it said
that a North American actor became so
enamoured of a certain form of Japanese
humour that he decided to learn Ja p a n-
ese and export it to the United Stat e s.
When a Japanese joke mentions cherry
p i e , he talks about pizza instead so that
his audience can get the point. But the
humour works the same.
You have never managed to make a
breakthrough in the English-speaking world.
Aren’t you interested in that particular marke t ?
F i rst of all, I ’ ve never thought in market
t e rm s.Things either happened or they didn’t .
Ye a rs ago a book of my cartoons without
wo r d s , The Wo rld of Quino, came out in the
United Stat e s. It was ve ry well received by my
N o rth A m e rican counterp a rt s , i n c l u d i n g
S c h u l z1. Someone even said: “ at last a car-
toonist who doesn’t draw couples reading
1. Charles M.Schulz (1922-2000).American
cartoonist, creator of the Peanuts series,whose
main hero is Charlie Brown with his dog Snoopy.

the morning paper at the breakfast table.”
But the book didn’t sell. I think the English-
speaking public is used to a much quicker
visual humour than mine. I focus on details,
and a reader always has to ask why I included
this or that particular feat u r e . If I draw a
n e w s p a p e r ,I write things on it that form a sort
of code for the readers.A lot of people don’t
notice these details.As for Mafa l d a , the Bri t i s h
thought she was “too Latin A m e ri c a n .”
Would you say your humour is typically
Argentine?
The Mafalda series is, c e rt a i n l y.The env i-
ronment in which the characters live is the
Buenos Aires neighbourhood where I live d
my s e l f, and Mafa l d a ’s way of talking is also
typically A r g e n t i n e ,e ven in the editions pub-
lished in Spain and elsewhere in Latin A m e r-
i c a . In the rest of my work feat u ring dialogue
I try to use an idiom that is a bit more neu-
t r a l .As for my other cartoons I wo u l d n ’t know
h ow to answer your question. My parents,my
aunts and uncles and my grandparents we r e
all Spanish. I spent my childhood surr o u n d e d
by immigr a n t s : the butcher was Spanish, a n d
so was the shopkeeper who sold us lentils.T h e
gr e e n grocer was Italian, and my parents’a n d
my gr a n d p a r e n t s ’f riends were from A n d a l u-
s i a . My first real contact with Argentines wa s
in pri m a ry school. When I started there I
spoke with such a strong Andalusian accent
t h at my schoolmates couldn’t unders t a n d
w h at I said. I found it hard to mix with them.
Sometimes you use captions, sometimes you
don’t. Do you think text is a crucial factor in
humour?
I would prefer to do without wo r d s. B u t
some ideas would be incomprehensible
without text. Humour is like cinema in this
r e s p e c t .C h a p l i n , for instance, n e ver needed
wo r d s. Neither did Jacques Tat i . But Wo o d y
A l l e n , who doesn’t use visual gags, s t o p s
being funny the moment he stops talking.
What are your favourite subjects?
I don’t think I have any, though over time
I see certain themes crop up again and again.
W h at you find most often in my work is
humour about the weak and the powe r f u l ,
about the relations between power and ordi-
n a ry people. I grew up in a highly politicized
fa m i l y.The Spanish civil war and the rise of
fascism were the dramas that marked my
c h i l d h o o d . They gave me a political vision
of life, one which I like to express in all my
d r aw i n g s. I think power relationships exist
in all situat i o n s , whether a person is fa c e d
with a gove rnment offic i a l , who is always the
p owerful one, or a waiter or a doctor. I ’ m
fa s c i n ated by relationships based on depen-
d e n c e . Other subjects I deal with include life
and deat h , with death as the powerful fig u r e
and the living as the we a k . I wo rry about los-
ing my freedom in old age—I’m terri fied by
the idea of having to depend on other people
for the most basic things. So I draw cart o o n s
of 84-year-olds who want a glass of wine
against their gr a n d c h i l d r e n ’s wishes.
Are there any taboo subjects?
When I start e d , I made jokes about
p ri s o n e rs. P ri s o n e rs and the shipwrecked
are the staples of world humour. But when
people were imprisoned on political
grounds in Argentina, I stopped handling
the subject,and I still couldn’t deal with it
t o d ay. I think it’s counterp r o d u c t i ve to
tackle issues as tragic as prisons and tor-
ture through humour, and though I’ve been
criticized for it, I couldn’t bring myself to
join in Amnesty Intern at i o n a l ’s campaigns.
I don’t like tragedies such as earthquakes
and natural catastrophes either, though I
think this has more to do with a personal
phobia that is not shared, for example, by
Brazilian cart o o n i s t s. Some ye a rs ago a
U ru g u ayan plane carrying a rugby team
crashed in the A n d e s.Those who ultimat e l y
survived had to eat the flesh of those who
had died.A Brazilian humorous magazine
d e voted an entire issue to this episode,
which wa s n ’t in the least funny. But they
managed to make it funny, t e rribly dark bu t
f u n ny.And not so long ago I saw an issue of
a French we e k l y, Le Canard Enchaîné I
think it wa s , which featured a draw i n g
about rape in prison, a subject I would be
incapable of tackling.
Your most recent book, Cuanta Bondad, is full
of drawings that poke fun at modern
technology: the fax, the computer, the mobile
phone. Do you really dislike these things?
I hate mobile phones, and the stupid way
they are used gets on my nerve s. I can under-
stand that a doctor,an electrician or a plumber
might need a mobile phone. Not long ago in
A s t u rias a man saved himself from being
mauled by wo l ves because he called for help
on his mobile.But I can’t stand being in a doc-
t o r ’s waiting room listening to people call to
s ay that the doctor’s late with his appointments
or to ask if they need to stop by the gr o c e r ’s. I
think the Internet is ve ry useful in some cir-
c u m s t a n c e s. In the field of medicine, for exam-
p l e , i t ’s wonderful that a small- town doctor
can consult a leading authority in the United
S t ates or Switzerland. But it’s another thing
entirely to get hooked to the Internet and look
for a partner or spouse by computer search. I

k n ow an old wo m a n , an Italian psychologi s t ,
who communicates with Tibetan monks via
the Internet though I’m sure she never both-
e rs to say hello to her neighbours.A lot of com-
m u n i c ation means people isolate themselve s
from the people around them.
Football also features in some of your pieces.
Do you like the game?
I don’t know as much about football as I
would like, but it interests me above all from
a social viewpoint.I t ’s the only sport that leads
its spectat o rs into cri m e . I ’ ve seen violence
b e t ween ice hockey teams, including the deat h
of a player who was hit in his sternum and left
for dead. But in football it’s the public itself
t h at hits out, attacks and kills. An A m e ri c a n
author who studied the phenomenon of hooli-
ganism in England came to the conclusion
t h at what makes football fru s t r ating is spend-
ing 90 minutes waiting for a goal to be scored.
In basketball, or even in hockey, the scoreline
is changing continually, but in football 30 or
40 minutes can go by without a goal. As a
result fru s t r ation builds up among the spec-
t at o rs and it has to express itself somehow.
I’m more interested in football from that angle
than as a sport ,though I admit there are play-
e rs whom it’s a pleasure to wat c h . W h e n
Johann Cruyff was on the fie l d , it was like
watching Rudolf Nureyev on a stage.
God often appears in your cartoons. Why is that?
I don’t believe in God,but I read the Bible
a lot because it’s a fantastic source of ideas.
And if God doesn’t exist, h e ’s a ve ry good
s u b j e c t .H e ’s a figure about whom it’s impos-
sible to be indifferent: e ve ryone either love s
him or hates him. And he keeps on popping
up in my cartoons because in a way he’s a
character you can identify with. When yo u
d r aw you create things with a pencil, and yo u
can construct on paper all the different wo r l d s
t h at come to your mind. He may not exist,
but as Borges said,i t ’s enough to have a wo r d
t h at designates something for that thing to
come to life.F u rt h e rm o r e ,r e l i gion is like sex
or dru g s : it always sparks reactions and letters
from readers , and I love that .
What is your worst professional memory?
W h at has most annoyed me, without a
s h a d ow of a doubt, has been the use of my
c a rtoons for purposes poles apart from those
t h at inspired me to draw them. I get part i c u-
larly angry when my cartoons are used in
right-wing political campaigns. Once I wa s
sent from Spain a sticker showing Guille,
M a fa l d a ’s brother, c a rrying a pro-Franco
fla g .T h at was a terrible blow,since I was born
in a family that had lost the Spanish civil wa r ,
and films about that period still make me cry.
My comic strips were also used in a political
campaign by an Argentine military offic e r
who had been chief of police in Buenos A i r e s
p r ov i n c e . I wonder if those people have read
my work and totally misunderstood it, o r
whether they understood it all too well and
wanted to twist its meaning.These are things
t h at I simply can’t figure out. I gather that
M a falda has been used in Venezuela in an
election campaign, but I’m not going to hire
a law yer in Caracas because if I did things
would drag on for eve r.
Have you always been totally free to draw as
you please?
It seems paradox i c a l , but under the ru l e
of Argentine military gove rn m e n t s — w h i c h
is the same as saying almost all of them, s i n c e
I ’ ve only known four democratically elected
presidents since I was born—there has neve r
been any official censorship bu r e a u . In con-
trast to Brazil, where there was a body to
which all cartoonists had to submit their
d r awings before they could be published, i n
Argentina it was the editors who tried to talk
you round.The problem was that you neve r
knew what or who the problem wa s , so yo u
s t a rted to censor your own wo r k . When I
a rri ved in Buenos Aires with a file full of car-
toons I realized straightaway that neither the
Church nor the military could be targets, t h at
sex was a subject you had to handle with kid
g l ove s , and there was no question of talking
about homosexuality.Since I was young and
wanted to be published, I buckled down to
the approved subjects. But even today,w h e n
a nything goes,I still find it ve ry hard to get out
of the habit of self-censors h i p.
You lived in exile during the military
dictatorship2. Were you forced to leave the
country?
I left when the situation was really bad.A lot of
my friends had disappeared,and when I we n t
to deliver a cartoon to a magazine that pub-
lished my wo r k , I would find that a bomb had
just gone off there or that the building had
been machine-gunned the night before.W i t h
work like mine, which can be done on a hotel
table in any place you like, it would have been
stupid to stay. B e t ween 1976 and 1979 I live d
in Italy.Then I started to go back to see how
things we r e , and today I live for eight months
of the year in Buenos Aires and the rest of the
time in Milan, which is my European base. I
also spend a lot of time in Spain and France.
Outside Argentina, have you had to make any
concessions to ensure your books get published?
A few,ye s , but usually for anecdotal not
to say comic reasons. Some 15 ye a rs ago I
found out by chance that Mafalda was ve ry
well known in China. A little Chinese gi r l
told me this when she asked me to auto-
graph an album at a Buenos Aires book fa i r.
Until then I had no idea that my books had
been published in China, so I was ve ry
i n t ri g u e d .Through a friend I managed to
find out that the pirated editions had been
produced in Ta i wa n , and that the editor, l i k e
all good pirat e s , was English. My agent
managed to get these pirate editions with-
d r aw n , and regular editions have recently
s t a rted to be published in mainland China.
I was there a few months ago, and I asked
h ow they had translated all the strips in
which Mafalda talks about the ye l l ow peri l .
When I wrote those strips we had just found
out that China had the atomic bomb,a rev-
e l ation that caused gr ave concern in the
We s t .They told me that eve rything about
China had been cut, since they thought that
I didn’t know enough about China to gi ve
an opinion—a wonderful piece of reason-
i n g, I thought. I also found out that
S u s a n i t a , M a fa l d a ’s friend who dreams

v i rtual subve rs i ve due to China’s fa m i l y
planning policy.
Mafalda is anything but politically correct. Has
this ever caused you any problems?
I still recall a case involving Cuba, a
c o u n t ry I’ve visited seven or eight times and
where I have good fri e n d s.T h e r e ’s a Cuban
edition of Mafalda and an animated fil m
s e ries based on the strip cartoon was made
t h e r e . But whenever I go to Cuba, s o m e o n e
asks me to explain the strip in which Mafa l d a
is sitting in front of a plate of soup—the dish
she hates more than anything—and wo n-
d e rs why Fidel Castro doesn’t sing the praises
of soup so that it can be banned in A r g e n t i n a .
I t ’s certainly true that back then anything to
do with Cuba was suspect in A r g e n t i n a .B u t
w h at Mafalda actually says is:“ W hy doesn’t
‘ t h at idiot’ Fidel Castro. . . ? ”The Spanish
newspaper El Pa i s has censored some of my
d r awings on the grounds that they are too
“ gri m ” , to which I reply that I may be gri m ,
but I’m never as grim as real life.
Your Mafalda series has been compared to
Schulz’s Peanuts.
N at u r a l l y. I started the Mafalda stri p
after being commissioned to adve rtise a
brand of domestic appliances for which I
was specifically asked to do something of
the same kind. I bought all the books by
Schulz that I could find in Buenos A i r e s ,
studied them and then tried to do some-
thing similar but adapted to our situation.
The campaign never got off the gr o u n d
because the magazine that was going to
publish the cartoons realized it was closet
a d ve rt i s i n g . So I put my drawings away
until a year later, in 1964, when I rescued
them for the magazine Primera Plana.
Why do you think Mafalda is still being
published and read almost 30 years after you
stopped producing it?
I suppose it’s because part of the mes-
sage is still relevant.The human race still
has a lot of issues to address.The world of
which Mafalda was so cri t i c a l , the wo r l d
that existed in 1973 when I stopped pro-
ducing the strip has not disappeared; per-
haps it’s even got worse.Though it flatters
me to know that Mafalda is still being read,
i t ’s also sad to think that the social injustice
she denounced remains in place.
Why did you stop drawing Mafalda, against
your readers’ wishes?
Humour and art in general wear them-
s e l ves out. I admired Schulz a lot, and I
loved Peanuts. I read the strips with great
enthusiasm for 10 or 15 years. But I would
h ave liked to have seen that special brand of
humour reflected in other things. I feel the
same about the Colombian painter Fe r-
nando Botero: I just don’t think he should
keep on painting f at figures all his life.As
for my s e l f, after ten ye a rs of Mafa l d a , I
s t a rted to suffer each time I drew a new
instalment, and I found it extremely hard
not to repeat myself.When I started draw-
ing, I learnt that if you conceal from some-
one the last drawing in a strip and that per-
son still knows how it’s going to end, then
your story isn’t up to scratch.Even though
the books continue to sell ve ry well and
people ask me for more, I think that I made
the right decision when I stopped doing
Mafalda,and I don’t miss her at all.

once told me that hundreds of people wo u l d
l ove to have their own weekly page to say
w h at e ver they liked.Becoming aware of that
responsibility made me feel dizzy, but as for
the rest, i t ’s none of my bu s i n e s s.
Do you identify with any of your characters?
I identify to some extent with all of them.
I believe that all the characters who appear in
my drawings are releva n t . I learnt this from an
i n t e rview with the A m e rican film director
Frank Capra, who was talking about the
i m p o rtance of extras.When he filmed street
scenes he would speak to each of the extras
and carefully describe their role.Yo u ,m a d a m ,
are an anxious woman going to the pharm a cy
to buy medicine because your husband is
s i c k .Yo u ,s i r , are a decorator going to paint an
a p a rtment and yo u ’re lat e . E ve ry character
who appeared in Capra’s fil m s , e ven in the
b a c k gr o u n d , had a story. L i k e w i s e , when I
d r aw a restaurant, I imagine that the man
s e ated at the table behind works in a bank
and has a brother-in-law who has gone to live
in Ve n e z u e l a . I love doing that .
You once said that human beings are the
cancer of the planet. Is there no hope?
I’ll gi ve you just one example: it has
a lways been said that the Amazon region con-
stitutes the lungs of our planet, but that does-
n ’t stop people from continuing to destroy it.

Nevertheless, you have drawn her again . . . .
Ye s. UNICEF commissioned some
d r awings for the tenth annive rs a ry of the
C o nvention on the Rights of the Child, a n d
I was delighted to do them.I also drew her
again for the fifth anniversary of President
Raul Alfonsín’s democratic government in
Argentina, and I’ve allowed her to be used
in public health campaigns and on behalf of
causes that I think worthwhile. Now I use
her when I want to protest against some-
t h i n g — s h e ’s the spokeswoman for my rage.
But I never have agreed and never will
a gree to her being used in adve rtising cam-
paigns, nor will I allow any adaptation for
the theatre or the cinema. The only con-
cession I have made was for an animated
film because drawings were used in it.
What do you tell your readers, especially
children, who ask you to draw Mafalda again?
I t ’s easy to answer children. I drew
Mafalda for 10 years,so I always tell them
the same thing.I say:imagine having to do
the same thing eve ry morning from the day
you were born until today.Would you like
t h at? They always say no. Fifteen- or six-
teen-year-olds are harder to convince,and
I don’t think I manage to do so.
Certain pseudo-scientific studies circulate on
the Internet arguing that Latin American
children who read Mafalda tend to hate soup.
Some girls have actually been named after
her. A magazine even chose her as one of the
10 most influential Argentine women of the
20th century. Isn’t this a heavy responsibility?
A b s o l u t e l y. But the real responsibility for
me is facing a blank page each week on
which I can say what e ver I please. S o m e o n e
[I’ve made up my mind to face
reality. Just let me know when
it turns beautiful again.]

i n g l y, only when there’s blood or when it’s
j u s t i fie d . I once did a drawing in which yo u
see a child left alone at home paint a line ru n-
ning all through the house, from the staircase
to the hall to the bedrooms. When his par-
I t ’s as if someone with lung cancer did noth-
ing to prevent it, still less to cure it. Since so
m a ny people are wo rried about the destru c-
tion of the A m a z o n ,w hy doesn’t the United
N at i o n s , s ay, buy it and protect it? But no.
Humans are like that .They keep on smoking
in spite of lung cancer.As I see it, hope lies in
c u l t i vating a certain historical optimism. I
strongly agree with the Po rtuguese Nobel lit-
e r ature laureate José Saramago, who has
a lways maintained that socialism and the left
will one day regain their lost prestige. I think
h e ’s ri g h t . I always compare politics to av i a-
t i o n . O ver the centuries many people died
while trying to fly.But before they could fly in
hang gliders or ultralight aircraft, they firs t
had to invent the internal combustion engi n e ,
which is extremely heav y. If Leonardo da
Vinci had known of the lightweight mat e ri a l s
t h at we have today, people could have been
flying since the fifteenth century. I t ’s a bit like
visiting the Christian catacombs in Rome.
W h at men! Three centuries in hiding! W h at
political group today could stand three cen-
t u ries without being infil t r ated? And 2000
ye a rs lat e r , they are still around, though it’s
t rue that they’ve become the exact opposite of
w h at they claimed to be.
Do you always draw in black and white?
Ye s , with a few exceptions.The French
edition of Mafalda is in colour because the
publisher thinks that if it’s not in colour, i t
wo n ’t sell in France. I agreed but I’m not ve ry
happy about it. M a falda as I see it is in black
and white, and in general I prefer comics in
black and white except when colour really
adds something. Of course when you see
Akira Ku r o s awa ’s fil m s , you realize that
colour does add something. I use it ve ry spar-

ents come home,he greets them by say i n g,“ I
bet you don’t know the colour of freedom.”
What colour was it?
