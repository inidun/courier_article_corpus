ARCHITECTS OF A NEW
STRATEGY FOR EDUCATION
Right, the seven members of the Inter¬
national Commission on the Development
of Education which carried out a world¬
wide inquiry for Unesco. Comprising
prominent figures from different cultural
and professional backgrounds, the Com¬
mission reached wide agreement on the
problems of present day education and
on guidelines that could lead to their
solution. It proposed a far-reaching pro¬
gramme for world educational reform
based on the principle of lifelong educa¬
tion.

I N many countries today
education is regarded as an excep¬
tionally difficult problem, but all
countries without exception agree it
is a task of the utmost importance.
Everywhere men anxious to build a
better world proclaim education to be
the keystone without which their work
is in vain. In setting up the Interna¬
tional Commission for Educational
Development, Unesco has shown that
it is alive to the political ¡issues of
our time.
Educational systems with long-
established traditions that have stood
the test of time, needing only a few
adjustments to keep them running
smoothly, are now the target for cri¬
ticisms that often question their
whole essence. Youth today is in
more or less open revolt against
established educational methods and
institutions, though it is not always
easy to determine exactly how much
of its general unrest and outbursts of
rebellion may be ascribed to this
specific cause.
In the developing countries educa¬
tional systems of recent date, usually
copied from a foreign model, have
run into trouble.
Emerging from the colonial period,
the developing countries threw them¬
selves wholeheartedly into the fight
against ignorance, which they viewed
quite rightly as an essential prelimi
nary to lasting liberation and real
development.
They believed it would be enough
to wrest the weapon of technical
superiority, as it were, from the hands
of the colonizers. They have now
realized that the models they chose
(which were often already out of date
for those for whom and by whom
they were devised) are not suited
either to their needs or to their prob¬
lems.
Their investment in education is far
beyond their financial capacity- More
graduates are produced than the
economy can absorb, so that many
remain unemployed; this is not only
unprofitable but causes psychological
and social damage so extensive as to
disturb the balance of society.
As they cannot bring themselves to
renounce one of the basic principles
for which so many sacrifices were
made and so many battles fought, they
are faced with an "agonizing reapprai¬
sal". Such a situation calls for an

effort of solidarity on the part of the
more favoured nations.
Lastly, some States regard their own
educational systems as fairly satisfact¬
ory and there is no authority competent
to say whether they are right or wrong.
They may perhaps be deluding them¬
selves and fail to perceive some deep-
lying deterioration invisible to the
superficial gaze. In that case the
awakening will be a rude one, as
France found in May 1968. But equally
possibly these countries may have
succeeded, by good management or
good luck, in achieving this adjustment
which others find so difficult.
Yet even those modern States
which think they are doing quite well
and are therefore not troubled by any
fears of crisis or pangs of conscience,
do not necessarily .feel that they have
nothing to worry about. On the con¬
trary, they generally pay great atten¬
tion to modernizing and improving their
institutions and methods and are not
afraid to innovate.
But they cannot ignore the rest of
the world.
When they are scaling the heights
of knowledge and power, how can they
fail to feel concern and even anxiety
at those vast areas of ignorance still
darkening our planet, like those other
persistent shadows of hunger and
early mortality?
The great change we are now exper¬
iencing calls in question the unity and
the future of the species and man's
very Identity. The danger lies not
only In the painful prospect of severe
Inequalities, hardship and suffering,
but in a real dichotomy of the human
race, split into superiors and inferiors,
masters and slaves, supermen and
submen.
Among the risks Inherent in this
situation would be not only those of
conflict and disaster (for modern
weapons of mass destruction might
well fall into the hands of deprived
rebellious groups), but the fundamental
risk of dehumanization affecting priv¬
ileged and oppressed alike.
Some people think there is no need
to "dramatize" the current problem.
This is an extremely mistaken view.
The situation we are considering is
entirely new and quite without preced¬
ent. For it does not proceed, as is
still too often repeated, from a simple
phenomenon of quantitative growth.
If we take a broad view of education
through the ages, we see that advan¬
ces in education accompany economic
progress.
In stable societies of the agrarian
type, education Is concerned with the
transmission of skills, traditions and
values. It does not raise any special
problems of its own, as distinct from
social, political and religious problems.
As the pace of economic progress
quickens, the educational system natu¬
rally tends to dispense an increasing
amount of knowledge to an increasing
number of persons, since more elabor¬
ate production requires a more highly

EDUCATION AND THE DESTINY OF MAN (Continued)
A new commitment to the use of technology
skilled labour force, and in addition,
this labour force promotes further
technical Improvements, as it throws
up inventors and innovators.
In the long term, education Is linked
to social and political development as
well as technical and economic pro¬
gress. Better educated people tend
to assert their rights as citizens and
if there are a lot of them, they press
their claims for democracy.
The view that educational institutions
are purely conservative or even repres¬
sive forces is not correct. Of course,
every Institution is by its very nature
a stabilizing influence, and teaching
implies a tendency to repetition and a
concern with form, formulas and form¬
ulation, in the same way as the prac¬
tice of law. In times of rapid change
this dual aspect becomes more strik¬
ing; education then seems to be an
obstacle to the movement which It has
nevertheless provoked.

¡ITHERTO, however, there
has been nothing comparable In its
consequences to what we now call
the scientific revolution.
For In fact, much technical progress
was made in earlier days through
scientific observation and the discovery
of "recipes" which involved no special
intellectual grasp of the secret forces
of nature. Only in relatively recent
times have conquests through fund¬
amental research penetrated to the
core of the problems examined, while
at the same time their practical applic¬
ations have entered ever more rapidly
into the daily life of the man in the
street.
The changes wrought by the
18th century industrial revolution and
the early machine age were concerned
with the physical and muscular capac¬
ities of the workers; but the scientific
revolution has invaded the intellectual
field with the automatic transmission
of information over any distance and
the invention and constant improve¬
ment of computers.
This phenomenon necessarily affects
the whole of mankind.
The effects of economic expansion
may differ greatly according to the
region and the social group, but mass
media and cybernetics reach everyone
everywhere.
The scientific revolution thus places
knowledge and training In an entirely
new perspective; man now has new
possibilities of thought and action and
for the first time their context Is truly
universal.
This fact inevitably comes to mind,
but it should be stressed that people
do not always deduce Its logical con¬
sequences.
In the economic and social sphere
people are no longer so easily resign¬
ed to class distinctions or national
disparities as in the days when these
were regarded as ordained by the
natural order of things. Nor are they
resigned to educational underdevelop¬
ment, particularly since they have been
led to believe that education for all is
the key to economic advancement.
The problem of democracy is even
more cogent. All nations now aspire
to democracy, and this has nothing
whatever to do with their GNP or their
enrolment rates. But the democracy
to which they aspire is different from
the type we have known hitherto.
In this field no nation is really satis¬
fied with its performance; and it Is a
field where the development of the
individual personality is paramount.
The technological age brings un¬
deniable benefits and opens up vast
prospects, but there is a debit side
too. Scientists warn us of dangers
on all sides, in terms that sometimes
mask their hallucinatory quality over¬
population to the point where it beco¬
mes inconceivable, destruction of the
soil and the countryside, asphyxiation
of cities, exhaustion of food and ener¬
gy resources, a new Flood caused by
the melting of the polar icecap, mind-
destroying chemicals in the atmos¬
phere, and so on. . .
Some do not hesitate to propose
the complete halting of growth "zero
growth" on the grounds of limiting
the damage; while others, without
openly going to this extreme, advocate
a revival of Malthusianism in the guise
of an "ecology policy".
Such solutions would ultimately con¬
solidate international disparities and
even accentuate distortions. Growth
must therefore continue, but in order
to exorcise its perils and reduce its
harmful side effects, communities must
be able to establish the necessary
priorities and controls in a democratic
manner, which assumes the presence
of adequately educated, informed and
responsible persons.
Growth oriented towards the quality
of life and the search for equilibrium
in human affairs cannot be left to
governments alone, bogged down in
their problems of administration and
often In systems founded on prejudice.
Only public opinion, If it can shape
world opinion, can manage to impose
simple and obviously essential measu¬
res, yet postponed ad infinitum, such
as a ban on nuclear weapons and the
switching of some portion of the
unproductive expenditure on military
preparations to social purposes.
If the people are to take over this
role, which is within their power, they
must become aware of their identity,
their aspirations, their strength; they
must shake off their fatalism and their
resignation, and this psychological
confidence can only be acquired
through education made available to
all.
'EMOCRACY now appears
to be the only way of preventing man
from becoming the slave of the ma¬
chine and the only condition compati¬
ble with human dignity and the human
intellect, and hence deserves our full
support.
The Commission considered it vital
that science and technology become a
basic element in education of every
type and for all ages including chil¬
dren, adolescents and adults.
Both developed and developing
countries will have to devise very
similar strategies, though their resour¬
ces differ.
In the developed countries the educ¬
ational system always or nearly
always has a dual character: the
education it dispenses is pre-techno-
logical and its social recruitment is
elitist (in the case of higher education).
This is the system with the same
characteristics which has generally
been introduced into the developing
countries, where it has the additional
disadvantage of not being adjusted
to the cultural background or to the
social and human environment.
In both cases, therefore, it is neces¬
sary to move from the pre-technolo-
gical to the technological stage and to
construct a broadly based education
for the people on the foundation of an
educational system limited to. the few,
for whom it was a guarantee of jobs
in the higher levels of the economy
and the administration.
Logically speaking, this dual trans¬
formation should be accomplished in
one operation, but this has not always
been the case.
Surprising as It may seem, countries
regarded as "developed" are faced

with an internal situation of educational
Underdevelopment. Students of work¬
ing-class origin exhibit (at least rela¬
tively speaking), symptoms of mal¬
adjustment and failure similar to those
observed in the ex-colonial countries
which adopted a western-style educ¬
ation, lock, stock and barrel.
So the spotlight falls in both cases
on the combined problems of motiv¬
ation and employment, which govern
the Intake and output of the educ¬
ational cycle.
Motivation Is the key to any modern
education policy.
Curiosity, the desire to understand,
to know or to discover, is one of the
basic drives in human nature. Through
the notations devised by science it Is
now possible for the dullest minds to
assimilate concepts which it needed a
genius to discover.
This ought to be the most powerful
motivation, if It were encouraged. But
it is not. On the other hand, the
stimulus of ambition and a good job Is
not strong enough to guarantee the
democratization of higher education in
a number of industrialized countries,
nor even to ensure regular school
attendance in the developing countries.
We then have the paradoxical situa¬
tion that in some regions where only
half the children can get to school,
half of that half fail to settle down and
drop out even in the first cycle.
HE employment motiva¬
tion, on the other hand, cannot secure
real democratization and also has the
serious drawback of giving credence
to the idea that a diploma entitles its
holder to a job of equivalent level.
Graduates who cannot find jobs
corresponding to their qualifications
feel that they have been cheated and
prefer to remain unemployed rather
than demean themselves by doing a
lower-grade job, for which they have
anyway not in fact been trained.
Modern democratic education requi¬
res the revival of man's natural drive
towards knowledge and the simulta¬
neous dismantling of the diploma-em¬
ployment mechanism which in many
cases (even in developed countries) Is
not viable economically.
Some educationists advocate far
more radical action, often based on
the same principles.
Because the educational system is
often obsolete and hidebound, they
propose it should not be reformed but
abolished. Because the school should
be in closer touch with everyday life,
some think it should simply be done
away with. Such views are usually
presented as progressive and even
revolutionary, but If they were in fact
generally adopted, their effects would
be far more retrograde.
The scientific and technical revolu¬
tion, with its mass media delivering an
endless flow of information, and many
other economic and social factors
have greatly modified traditional sys¬
tems of education, revealing the weak¬
ness of some forms of instruction and
the strength of others, broadening the
scope of self-learning activities and
enhancing the value of active and
conscious attitudes in the acquisition
of knowledge. Teaching methods bas¬
ed on reflection are acquiring increas¬
ing prestige.
The problems involved in teaching
and educating students of all ages,
including adults, lead to many forms of
out-of-school learning. Such education
offers a wide range of possibilities
which must be used productively In all
countries. Scorn for out-of-school
education ¡s a relic of the past and no
progressive teacher can hold such a
view.
Yet both now and in the future the
school defined as any agency dis¬
pensing systematic education to the
rising generation is the decisive fac¬
tor in training men fitted to contribute
to the development of society and play
an active part in life.
The Commission's attitude differs
both from the limited approach of
those still hypnotized by existing struc¬
tures and from the ideas of those who
dream of breaking them down and
rushing out into the unknown, with no
thought for the constraints of reality
and feasibility.
The Commission therefore stressed
two fundamental concepts: lifelong
education and the educational com¬
munity. If learning is the affair of a
lifetime and of a whole society, then it
is necessary to look beyond the
reform of "educational systems" and
think of an educational community.
That is the real educational challenge
of tomorrow.
The "age of change" provides us
with the necessary instruments for
meeting the quantitative and qualitative
demand for education which it pro¬
vokes. But we must know how to
recognize and adapt such instruments
for this purpose.
The two major innovations of the
technological age mass media and
cybernetics both relate to information
and are therefore naturally suitable for
applying to learning and education.
Yet little use is made of program¬
med instruction, radio, television, and
especially computers in education.
When they are used, radio and tele¬
vision are external and parallel to
formal education.
All countries, whatever their level of
development, must adopt the large-
scale use of educational technology
and technological principles, or in
other words, post-machinist Intellectual
technologies.
What ¡s a very valuable facility to
the developed countries appears to
the developing countries as the pre¬
requisite for tackling the general prob¬
lem. For most of them educational
innovation offers the only hope of find¬
ing a satisfactory solution in a reason¬
able time.
Present procedures do not offer any
solution for illiteracy affecting a large
fraction of the population (despite the
undoubted progress of functional liter¬
acy) nor in many cases for securing
the generalization and profitability of
school attendance, nor for promoting
adult education and the gradual Imple¬
mentation of the concept of lifelong
education.
The outlook is quite different If it
is decided to introduce the full-scale
use of educational technologies and
especially the dual method of pro¬
grammed instruction and radio-televi¬
sion programmes.
I|F we agree that the time
is ripe for educational reform, that
education is today facing a critical
challenge, that we must all join to¬
gether in rethinking it In its entirety,
then International co-operation and
world solidarity are clearly more
necessary than ever before.
The research organizations that will
have to be set up or extended to
develop forms of technological aid to
education can. benefit all countries.
The need for innovation is felt today
in many developed countries and their
problems are no different in essence
from those of the developing countries
they are trying to help.
The Commission found that present
forms of bilateral and multilateral aid,
the resources available and the basic
conceptions are not commensurate
with the educational requirements of
the world community. And the dispar¬
ity is even greater if renewal becomes
the top priority in educational activity.
Ways of broadening and strengthen¬
ing solidarity must be found. We are
convinced that they can be found
through the action and ingenuity of
countries, peoples, educators, resear- Q
chers, and International organiza- V
tions, especially Unesco, which has
a leading role to play in this field.
