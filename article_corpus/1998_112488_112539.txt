there are buildings that to my
mind are unlike any to be seen
e l swhere in the world and in such gr e at num-
b e r.There are churches hewn entirely out of
the living rock, which is sculpted with gr e at
i n g e n u i t y.”Francisco A l va r e z , the chaplain
of an early sixteenth-century Po rt u g u e s e
d i p l o m atic mission to A b y s s i n i a ,h e s i t ated to
say more about the wonders he had beheld
in Lalibela. Had he found the wo r d s , h e
thought,no one would have believed him.
Lalibela is a medieval monastic com-
plex perched at an altitude of 2,700
metres, where the sky meets volcanic rock
t h at solidified as it flowed down the
mountainside. It is a holy city inspired by
a dream, which may explain its airy grace
and the awe visitors feel when they behold
it. Legend has it that King Lalibela was
born in Roha,on the site of the little town
of 10,000 inhabitants which today bears
his name, some 700 kilometres from
Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. At his
birth, a swarm of bees enveloped him,
thus giving rise to his name, which means
“the bees know he will be great.” During
L a l i b e l a ’s childhood the throne of
Ethiopia was occupied by his brother
who, fearing the oracle’s words would
come tru e , poisoned him. The yo u n g
prince fell into a coma that lasted three
days. This “near-death experience”, as it
would be called today, was regarded as a
miracle. God had Lalibela brought up to
heaven and ordered him to have churches
hewn out of the living rock. In the early
twelfth century, when Christians despai-
red at seeing Jerusalem fall into the hands
of the Muslims, Lalibela came to the
throne and had eleven monolithic
churches carved out of the pink tufa.
French archaeologist Francis A n f r ay,
who has spent thirt y - t wo ye a rs in
E t h i o p i a , s ay s , “This imposing complex of
churches is the only one of its kind in the
wo r l d ,” which is one reason why Lalibela
is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
Another is that it’s a living site where 350
p ri e s t s , 250 deacons, 450 monks and 400
students still wo r k , study and wo rs h i p.T h e
r e l i gious services held there have not
changed in 800 ye a rs. E t h i o p i a ’s Ort h o-
d ox Christians consider it a second Holy
L a n d . The local stream is even called the
Jordan and there is a mountain named
Mount Ta b o r. E t h i o p i a ’s leading pilgri m a-
ge site, Lalibela sometimes we l c o m e s
20,000 to 50,000 believe rs at a time, e s p e-
cially during the peak Chri s t m a s , E p i-
p h a ny and Easter seasons. M a ny of them
trek to the complex on foot.
A deteriorating site
The churches have deteriorated over the
centuries, but by and large they have
withstood wars, invasions and the torren-
tial rains that drench the highlands from
June to September. But as the twentieth
century draws to a close, Lalibela’s rock
churches face new threats.They will need
the protection of Egzia Beher, t h e
Ethiopian Christians’ word for God, to
survive the expected wave of tourists.
“The gove rnment wants Lalibela to
attract as many visitors as possible,” says
Jara Haile Mariam, director of cultural
heritage at the culture and information
ministry. The goal is to help offset the
area’s extreme poverty. Tarja Laine, of
Finland, has carried out a detailed study
of the site and co-ordinates a develop-
ment project managed by the Finnida co-
operation agency. “The environment is
extremely eroded,” she says. “It will not
support any more forestry or farming.
Tourism is the only way for the people to
upgrade their living conditions.”
Right now, most of the population
lives below the poverty line and 97 per



Modern tourism is a mixed blessing for an extraordinary complex of medieval churches
hewn from the living rock of the Ethiopian highlands.

cent suffers from malnutrition.The infant
mortality rate is 153 per thousand and 68
per cent of the inhabitants can neither
read nor write. One adult in three is
unemployed and most of the rest eke out
a living selling firewood or as day labou-
rers.The churches are the town’s only real
source of wealth. In addition to the clergy
and students associated with them, they
provide work for those members of the
community who live from the touri s t
trade. An entrance ticket costs 100 birrs
($12) for a non-Ethiopian, which is twice
the monthly wage of half the inhabitants
of Lalibela. A young guide can earn more
in three hours than his father does in a
month! But the site still only draw s
10,000 tourists a year, who spend an ave-
rage of two days there. They complain
about poor sanitation infrastru c t u r e s ,
rude and underqualified guides, harass-
ment from beggars and high admission
prices.
Still, medieval Lalibela is slowly but
surely catching up with the twentieth cen-
tury. Five years ago it was impossible to
reach the medieval complex by road
during the rainy season.A few kilometres
from the centre, an acacia tree still cast its
shade over the single, narrow, red clay
airstrip. Since 1997 a new road has led to
the town, which has a real airport and
telephone service. A development plan
drawn up in 1996 calls for the building of
restaurants, souvenir shops, a museum, a
parking lot,a crafts centre, a post office, a
bank and other amenities. And electricity
is on the way. “But the power plant was
built too close to the churches, and the
cables spoil the scenery,” says Laine. “If
the ministry of culture had been consul-
ted, that mistake would have been avoi-
ded. The problem is, the ministry does
not have enough influence to control
development of the site.” Haile Mariam
says “there is a conflict between conserva-
tion and deve l o p m e n t ” and that the
government bodies in charge of tourism
and planning should be more sensitive to
the preservation of heritage.
“In the long run tourism will kill
Lalibela the same way it killed Mont Saint
Michel in France,” says Anfray. “We must
try to limit the damage.” Pietro Laureano,
an Italian architect working for UNES-
CO, adds, “I worked on the site of Petra
in Jordan. It’s a disaster. Hotels have been
built helter-skelter, even though the tradi-
tional local villages could have accommo-
dated tourists. Lalibela may develop in
the same disorderly way if we don’t give
the inhabitants and tour operators guide-
lines for protecting the perimeter around
the churches.” Mariam is campaigning for
the creation of “satellite villages” but ack-
nowledges that Ethiopia is too poor to
fund new infrastructures.
But the worst-case scenario can still
be avoided. “No irreparable damage has
been done,” Laine says reassuri n g l y.
What’s more, increased tourism could
spur intelligent development of the site.
According to a 1996 study conducted for
Finnida, visitors are overwhelmingly in
favour of protecting the perimeter around
the churches, which they fear will turn
into a “Holy Hollywood.” Sixty per cent
complained about the churches’ p o o r
condition and 83 per cent regret that they
are covered by shelters—sheet metal and
wooden structures that will, it is hoped,
prevent leaks from further damaging the
landmarks until a better solution is found.
“They’ve been talking about restoring the
churches for thirty years,” Anfray says.
“Work financed by an American founda-
tion started under the auspices of UNES-
‘In the long run tourism
will kill Lalibela, just as it
has killed Mont Saint-
Michel in France. We
must try to limit the
damage. ’

government didn’t ask for the restoration
campaign to start up again until 1993.”
Political instability and the top-to-bot-
tom reorganization of the country after
the Mengitsu regime fell in 1991 put pre-
servation efforts on hold. Since then,pro-
jects have been designed but they remain
on the drawing board.“Various Ethiopian
a u t h o ri t i e s , the church, the European
Union and UNESCO are all involved in
restoration,” says Anfray. “That adds up
to a heck of a lot of people and organiza-
tions.” Bureaucracy and the Ethiopian
civil war have not been the only stumbling
blocks. After decentralization measures
were implemented in 1995 and 1996,
heritage preservation fell to the federal
ministry of culture, but carrying out the
projects and local planning schemes are
within the province of the region.There is
also interference from the newly created
municipality and the clergy, w i t h o u t
whom nothing can be accomplished in
Lalibela.
M o r e ove r , UNESCO and the
European Commission, both of which are
i nvo l ved in developing Lalibela, h ave
conflicting preservation pri o ri t i e s.
UNESCO cannot afford to restore the
rock churches, and restoration falls outsi-
de the Commission’s sphere. All the
European Commission can do, s ay s
Anastase Zacharas, who is in charge of
the dossier at the European Commission,
is safeguard Ethiopia’s tourist potential.
Conflicting priorities
Europe is going to funnel 4.7 million of the
200 million Ecus it has earmarked for
d e velopment in Ethiopia between 1996
and 2000 largely into the construction of
at t r a c t i ve high-tech shelters to cover the
c h u r c h e s. The process is underway.
Architecture firms around the world have
been invited to tender bids, the winner will
be announced in March 1999 and the
s h e l t e rs will be completed by December
2 0 0 0 . This will leave a million and a half
E c u s , which will be used to carry out stu-
dies on the reasons why the churches and
the trenches that once formed a water drai-
nage network have deteri o r ated and to pay
s p e c i a l i s t s. M e a n w h i l e , UNESCO and the
Ethiopian department of preservation of
cultural heritage would like to see restora-
tion work begi n .Their experts have appro-
ved a pilot project calling for the use of tra-
ditional building methods and unsuccess-
fully tried to include it in the European
U n i o n ’s package. “ We have a lot of money
for the shelters but much less for conserva-
t i o n . There is no choice. It doesn’t make
s e n s e . People have been waiting for ye a rs
for the churches to be repaired.We have to
produce something or we lose credibility,”
Haile  Mariam says regr e t f u l l y.
“Our bureaucratic systems are too
rigid to fund small-scale operations like
pilot projects,” s ays Zacharas, w h o
believes the shelters are a necessary but
temporary evil.“They’ll be able to protect
the churches for ten year s. Then Ethiopia
will have to find the money to fund the
work.” In other words, it won’t be starting
tomorrow. But heaven can wait. . . . ■
