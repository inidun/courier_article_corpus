A greater need
than ever
for tolerance
and understanding
WE do not live in an
ideal world and it
would be vain to seek to idealize
it. That the world is often torn by
political, economic and social con¬
flicts is the patent reality of today.
But this reality forces us with¬
out denying any of the contra¬
dictions of our times and without
giving up truth and justice as the
basis for our action to seek to
rise above the tensions and con¬
flicts of today if we genuinely wish
to act in conformity with the prin¬
ciples of our Constitution.
I wish to make another urgent
appeal for tolerance and under¬
standing. In the future we should
try, even if at first it seems impos¬
sible to do so, to achieve through
patient dialogue the consensus
which should be the golden rule
in an institution such as this.
Admittedly, this calls for quiet,
patient and unflagging efforts and
for mutual concessions. It is by
this means that the moral autho¬
rity of our Organization can be
strengthened. I am firmly resolved
to speak out on important inter¬
national questions each time and
whenever I. deem it necessary in
order to reconcile conflicting
points of view and in order to
reach the broadest possible
agreement.
One thing strikes me immedia¬
tely: the importance that the Gen¬
eral Conference as a whole has
given to Unesco's ethical action,
particularly its efforts to contri¬
bute (in its fields of competence)
to the effective application of hu¬
man rights, the maintenance of
peace and the development of
understanding among peoples.
Unesco's action for peace must
be pursued on two fronts : first,
against all forms of oppression
and discrimination which endanger
peace and international security
and are a denial of human dignity;
and second, support for the forces
of progress, freedom, justice and
mutual respect among nations.
In this respect the General Con¬
ference has repeatedly stressed
that justice is directly linked with
the concept of social progress
and that equity must govern rela¬
tions between both individuals and
nations.
With these imperatives in mind,
Unesco will do its utmost, during
the next two years, to ensure that
the combined resources of res¬
earch, education and communi¬
cation make a more effective con¬
tribution to promoting the right to
education, science and culture.
As the United Nations agency
pledged to uphold the highest in¬
tellectual and spiritual values,
Unesco will also see to it that this
vigorous and sustained effort
extends beyond its own spheres
of competence to embrace the
whole range of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
Unesco's determination to com¬
bat the inequalities which deprive
vast numbers of the world's people
of the right to education has been
the guiding principle for plan¬
ning many of Unesco's activities
in education. Although Unesco
can contribute only indirectly to¬
wards removing the social bar¬
riers which many delegations
have denounced as a major cause
of the inequalities in education,
through its programme for equal
access to education it is directly
attacking specific forms of discri¬
mination against women and girls
(who make up half of humanity), ^
migrant workers and their fami- r

INTERNATIONAL
WOMEN'S
YEAR
Designated as International Women's
Year by the United Nations General
Assembly, 1975 will mark a turning
point in the struggle to end
discrimination against women. The
United Nations has established three
themes for International Women's
Year:
the promotion of equality between
men and women;
the integration of women into
development;
recognition of women's increasing
contribution to strengthening world
peace.
Unesco's contribution to the
achievement of United Nations
objectives for International Women's
Year will include the following
activities:
Education
International meeting, in 1976
(in co-operation with the International
Labour Organization) on educational
and vocational guidance and job
opportunities open to women. It will
study ways of integrating women
into economic, social and cultural
development and of promoting equal
access to education.
Study on working mothers and on
solutions adopted in different
countries to problems of educating
pre-school-age children.
Meeting of women holding major
posts in Unesco Member States on
the theme " Exchange and co-operation
between women in different countries".
Inquiry into recent steps taken by
governments in different parts of the
world for the advancement of women
in such fields as education,
employment, social welfare, family
planning, legal status, etc.
Two major programmes to develop
women's technical education in rural
areas, in the Central African Republic
and Mauritania.
Promotion of equal access for
women to all literacy programmes.
Social sciences
Research on the changing role of
men and women in family and
community life.
Study on the image of women
presented in school text-books.
Study on how women can contribute
to the strengthening of peace.
Information
Study on the effectiveness of mass
communications (radio, television,
etc.) in the education of women.

lies, refugees, and people strug¬
gling for their independence.
In addition, there are other
Unesco activities which can be
said to fall into this same cate¬
gory, aimed at removing obstacles
or changing conditions which
hamper equal access to education
for all. These include educational
programmes for rural develop¬
ment and literacy and adult edu¬
cation programmes, all of which
have been given priority status
by Unesco's General Conference.
In many countries, the econo¬
mic and social inequalities that
exist between urban and rural
areas are tantamount to discrimi¬
nation in education for millions of
rural children and young people.
In the years ahead, therefore, we
must step up our efforts in edu¬
cation for rural development.
Because it is so widespread
and has such profoundly negative
effects on the development of the
individual and the community,
illiteracy remains one of the ma¬
jor evils of the twentieth cen¬
tury. Its persistence its actual
increase, when reckoned in abso¬
lute figures makes it one of the
most formidable challenges that
the international community must
take up if the future of mankind is
not to be seriously compromised.
If Unesco's action in this res¬
pect has perhaps not yet been as
fully effective as one could wish,
this is mainly because the prime
factor in attacking this problem is
national determination, since only
governments are able to bring
about the kind of total mobiliz¬
ation of a country's resources
without which literacy campaigns
are doomed to failure.
Adult education too is a power¬
ful force in the democratization of
education, and one of the main
links in lifelong education. It is for
these reasons that the General
Conference has asked that Unes¬
co's activities aimed at correcting
the imbalance found in many edu¬
cation systems should be con¬
tinued and intensified, in line with
the recommendations of the Third
International Conference on Adult
Education, held in Tokyo, since
this imbalance is detrimental to
adult education which has its own
objectives, content and methods.
In recent years, the idea of life¬
long education has become one
of the key-features of Unesco's
programme... I think it will be pos¬
sible to free the concept of life¬
long education both from the un¬
duly restrictive definitions some
people have tended to give it and
from the equally dangerous risk
of vagueness which all too often
deprives general concepts of any
real content, so that its full scope
and living reality may be clearly
seen.
Unesco's programme for science
and technology has been reinforc¬
ed in the past few years, although
its scope is perhaps not yet as
broad as it should be.
As regards the spread of scien¬
tific knowledge, I welcome the
support given to the UNISIST pro¬
gramme since the exchange of
scientific and technological infor¬
mation is of fundamental impor¬
tance for the progress of both the
industrialized and the developing
countries. But the developing
countries still need to be able to
make use of such knowledge in
ways that they themselves choose.
It is with this in mind that we
shall continue to aid Member
States whenever they ask for as¬
sistance in formulating science and
technology policies appropriate to
their development needs.
Regarding human resources in
science and technology, you have
adopted a recommendation on
the status of scientific research
workers, the application of which
should give positive results. We
shall also try to facilitate contacts
between research workers and
institutes, particularly on a re¬
gional basis.
I also note with satisfaction the
importance accorded to science
and technology training program¬
mes at all levels. Training scien¬
tists, engineers and technicians is
still a crucial problem for most
developing countries. For this
reason, we must step up our
efforts in this field too, giving
special emphasis to the quality of
such training.
Our post-graduate training pro¬
grammes have an important func¬
tion and meet real needs. We
shall try to strengthen this part
of our programme, particularly in
the developing countries; and I
should like to thank those States
which have arranged for their
institutions to provide post-gradu¬
ate courses.
I wish to say a few words about
"transfers of technology" al¬
though, in fact, I prefer the term
"development of appropriate tech¬
nologies". Some countries have
fallen into what may be called
"technological traps". Imitating
others, they have adopted tech¬
niques which call for considerable
capital, costly equipment and fo¬
reign specialists, and which are
not really suited to their needs.
It would nevertheless be absurd
to reject any innovation from ano-

ther country or even to refrain
from using advanced technologies
whenever the right conditions can
be fully met. I think that one of
Unesco's functions should indeed
be to assist Member States which
seek such aid to find the right
path, particularly by promoting the
pooling of ideas, information and
experience and by helping to
launch pilot projects that can be
further developed.
While it is true that many coun¬
tries seeking to further their dev¬
elopment still lack the necessary
scientific and technological know¬
ledge, it is also true that, on a
global scale, we have both the
knowledge and the resources with
which to banish hunger, cure
disease, and remedy poverty and
injustice. What we lack is an ethic
which provides an alternative to
the egoistic or uncontrolled and
intimidating application of science
and technology, a humanitarian
and humanizing ethic which can
guide the thinking and purpose
of men and women towards more
fraternal and more universal aims.
While certain parts of the pro¬
gramme for the social sciences,
humanities and culture, were
approved unanimously, others in
some cases gave rise to widely
diverging opinions. This occurred,
in particular, when ideological
differences brought to light dif¬
ferent interpretations of economic
or social and cultural questions
which the social sciences cannot
as yet analyse objectively, for
want of scientific tools that would
enable us to reach a universal
consensus.
Thus, any action that enables
the social sciences to contribute
to the development of scientific
methods whose usefulness and
objectivity are universally accepted
would be both justified and bene¬
ficial. And at the same time as
such methods are improved,
efforts must be continued to make
better use of them. In saying this
I have in mind both the developed
countries, with their specialists
whose goal will always be to
seek perfection, and the develop¬
ing countries, where the main
emphasis must be placed on basic
training by means provided for in
one of the resolutions adopted by
the General Conference.
However, over and above these
specific activities, the role that
the social sciences play or will
play in Unesco's programme has
been considerably expanded. It
has been rightly pointed out that
the social sciences are at the
crossroads of numerous activities,
of which the problems of peace,
of development or of the estab¬
lishment of a new international
order are only three examples.
The social sciences should provide
the thinking which precedes action
and then enriches it.
Similar observations could be
made concerning culture. Today ^
there is a growing awareness that r

culture is ah integral part of over¬
all development. This situation
is not without its dangers, as I
have already said in speaking of
the relationship between cultures,
which are sometimes fragile, and
technologies which are often reck¬
lessly imported. The only way to
transform this fragility into
strength may be through the plann¬
ing of cultural policies in harmony
with policies for education and
science. If these three compo¬
nents are integrated, each will be
strengthened by the contributions
and support of the others.
I shall not examine in detail the
numerous activities which you
have approved, such as the pres¬
ervation and development of
national cultural heritages, the res¬
titution of cultural property to its
country of origin, the preservation
of historic quarters, towns and
sites in places where moderniza¬
tion is in many cases intrusive, or
man in his environment in con¬
nexion with the Man and the Bio¬
sphere Programme. Yet the fact
that I mention these activities only
briefly in no way detracts from
their importance nor from the
attention I intend to give to them.
It was gratifying to find so many
speakers contributing to the Gen¬
eral Conference discussions on the
programme for free flow of infor¬
mation since access to information
is vital both to the strengthening
of international understanding and
to the development of science and
technology. However, in this field
as in many others, a certain laxity
of language can be harmful.
Information may appear differ¬
ently to those who communicate
it and those who receive it. The
former see it as a service they
are providing, whereas for the
latter it is or it may appear to be
an intrusion upon their environ¬
ment or their privacy. Freedom to
circulate information may become
a pretext for exercising pressure,
and this raises the problem of the
content of information.
You were therefore right in
emphasizing that the free flow of
information, which has its rightful
place in Unesco's Constitution,
must be a two-way flow, and be
regarded as an exchange, if in this
field too we are to avert a division
of the world into producers and
passive consumers. In this respect
the adoption of a code of ethics
for journalists, which has been
proposed, could become the coun¬
ter-balance to an ill-defined free¬
dom of the press. Many other
problems are inextricably bound
up with the free flow of informa¬
tion. One example is the shortage
of newsprint and the control of
its production in a manner pre¬
judicial to certain countries, parti¬
cularly the least developed, as is
the case today.
Intellectual co-operation which
was the very root of Unesco, since
our Organization was in a real
sense the successor to the League
of Nations Institute of Intellectual
Co-operation, remains one of the
principal reasons for Unesco's
existence even if, as a result of
changes in the world, the Organi¬
zation has gradually extended its
activities to new fields. Today,
intellectual co-operation is truly
the source and the fundamental
condition of all international action
for progress.
Without a global exchange of
ideas, human knowledge would
not achieve that universality which
not only puts it in its true perspec¬
tive and enriches it, but at the
same time enables it to be used
for the benefit of the world com¬
munity. To appreciate the true
value of the communication of
knowledge, one need only think
of the injustice caused in the field
of science, for example, by the
monopolization of knowledge for
the benefit of the few, the threats
to international peace and security
to which this may give rise, and
the obstacles to progress which it
creates.
Unesco's record in intellectual
co-operation is outstanding and is
widely known. I shall try to
broaden this basic activity still
further, steering it when neces¬
sary in new direction's.
I think that Unesco, whose vo¬
cation it is to be one of the cen¬
tres of universal thinking, should
call more frequently on the great
figures of the world intellectual
community philosophers, histor¬
ians, men of letters, scientists,
specialists and research workers in
all disciplines and of all schools,
artists and sculptors to reflect
together on certain major prob¬
lems of our time. I intend shortly
to set up a working group of this
type, whose members could give
useful advice on certain aspects
of Unesco's role in the coming
years.
We ought .also to stimulate in¬
ternational co-operation among
the major research institutions by
encouraging the development of
fundamental and applied research
at national level in the various
branches of knowledge. I think,
in fact, that we should get the

most influential institutions in the
world to participate closely in the
execution of Unesco's programme,
as part of a mobilization of the
world scientific community to
serve mankind and especially the
developing countries.
I should like to emphasize here
the crucial role which Unesco's
National Commissions must play
by initiating .and stimulating in¬
tellectual co-operation among the
various national institutions. Simi¬
larly, I think that the trend which
has developed in recent years
towards entrusting certain pro¬
gramme activities, such as studies
or research, to non-governmental
organizations, deserves to be en¬
couraged as it has frequently pro¬
duced excellent results.
Inter-university co-operation,
which we chiefly promote through
the International Association of
Universities, is of course one of
the fundamental forms of intellec¬
tual co-operation.
In this connexion, we expect a
great deal from the initial work of
the European Centre for Higher
Education in Bucharest and from
the similar centres soon to be
established in Latin America and
the Arab countries. Moreover, the
conclusion of agreements bet¬
ween States, modelled on the
Mexico City Convention on the
recognition of studies, diplomas
and degrees in higher education,
should infuse fresh life into in¬
tellectual co-operation by encou¬
raging the movement of students
and teachers and the pooling of
ideas...
I view with great hope the activi¬
ties of the United Nations Univer¬
sity which will shortly begin. Con¬
ceived as an "international com¬
munity of scholars engaged in
research, post-graduate training
and dissemination of knowledge",
the United Nations University will
study from an interdisciplinary
standpoint the urgent problems
posed by the survival, develop¬
ment and welfare of mankind.
But as well as offering unprece¬
dented opportunities for throwing
light on these problems through
the combined intellectual efforts of
the international community's most
eminent institutions and persona¬
lities, the United Nations Univer¬
sity will also help to strengthen the
solidarity of the world community
and stimulate the flow of ideas, in
particular by endeavouring as
laid down in its Charter to "alle¬
viate the intellectual isolation of
members of academic and scien¬
tific communities in the developing
countries". We may thus hope
that in addition to being a symbol
of the universality of thought and
an international intellectual centre,
the university will be a powerful
force for international rapproche¬
ment and understanding.
Co-operation among the Spe¬
cialized Agencies of the United
Nations system is obviously diffe- .
rent in nature from that which r

in the developed and developing
countries today face a mounting tidal
wave of information, studies and
reports on many subjects from all
parts of the world. They can only
have proper access to and make use
of this accumulated mass of
information if it is systematically
processed, stored and exchanged at
national and world levels. Two
Unesco sectors (Sciences and

may develop between the other
organizations I have mentioned,
since it is not only a welcome
source of enrichment of interna¬
tional thought and action, but is
indispensable for the satisfactory
operation of the whole U.N. sys¬
tem, indeed for its very existence...
The United Nations General
Assembly is to examine in 1975
the problem of the overall co-ordi¬
nation of the institutions of the
United Nations system and their
respective roles, with a view to
improving the system's ability to
satisfy the needs of the interna¬
tional community as effectively as
possible.

out major programmes in close
collaboration with other U.N. Spe¬

ations (1), Unesco will collaborate
fully in all efforts aimed at better
co-ordination between the parallel
activities of these organizations.
I shall do my utmost to increase
Unesco's co-operation with its
sister agencies in every way.
The problems of aid to devel¬
opment, so often associated with
Unesco's operational activities,
are also now taking on new
dimensions. The debate on a new
international economic order, be¬
gun at the sixth special session
of the United Nations General
Assembly, has already led to
extremely interesting discussions
in the Economic and Social
Council, and will be the subject
of the special session of the
United Nations General Assembly
in September 1975, thus gaining
fresh scope and a new quality.
Here we are no longer con¬
cerned with operational action or
aid to development, in the tradi¬
tional meaning of these terms, but
with problems affecting all man¬
kind. It is for this reason that
we should speak of co-operation
for development rather than aid
to development. Indeed, the inter¬
national crisis in energy sources
has demonstrated the vulnerability
of the developed countries and the
interdependence of all countries,
whether regarded as developed
or developing.
Unesco must be able not only
to participate in this .debate,
within the United Nations or
elsewhere, but also to contribute
to it the wealth of experience it
has accumulated over the three
decades of its existence.
Co-operation for development
is a daily fact of the Organiz¬
ation's life and there can be no
question of halting current op¬
erations on the grounds that there
is need for reflection with the
idea of reorganizing the pro¬
gramme. Two parallel and si-

¿0 Food Programme.
multaneous activities are called
for: we must do all we can to
formulate new objectives and new
means of co-operation for devel¬
opment and we must carry out
current projects and programmes
as efficiently as possible...
It is commonly said that devel¬
opment is an integrated process,
a many-faceted enterprise in which
efforts must be brought to bear
on several fronts simultaneously.
But in the past, we have been
unable or unwilling to draw the
logical operational conclusions
from this self-evident fact, namely
that if development is an inte¬
grated process, the financing and
fields of action of programmes of
co-operation for development
should also be integrated.
Among the many fields of action
in development, probably the best
example is that of rural devel¬
opment programmes. For rural
development means the devel¬
opment of education, agriculture,
roads, cottage industries, distri¬
bution networks, water supply
systems, a system of credit, a
health service, etc. Are there in
fact any areas of human activity
that are not part of rural devel¬
opment?
The same is true of financing.
During recent decades, each of
the international or bilateral
financing bodies has painstakingly
established its criteria for
financing and has selected the
types of activities for which it
provides support. This special¬
ization, the at times unduly rigid
choice of criteria and the over-
compartmentalization of different
activities may curb the introduc¬
tion of new approaches and new
procedures for co-operation for
development.
So we should carefully examine
the real content of development
and study the areas in which
co-operation for development is
possible and desirable, dis¬
tinguishing them from those which
should be the responsibility and
the result of national efforts. The
aim is certainly not to establish
new restrictive criteria in addition
to those I have just mentioned;
on the contrary, it is to identify
openings which will yield maximum
results with modest resources.
And here I wish to emphasize
two things: Unesco is not founded
on a theoretical universality; it
also exists to serve its Member
States, each of its Member States.
It is essential that each Member
State rich or poor, industrialized
or aspiring to be so, in northern
or southern hemisphere, in east
or west should be able to find
a place in the Organization and to
receive from it all the services
which it is entitled to expect.
Aid to development, then, in
spite of its importance, is only
one aspect of Unesco's action.
As Assistant Director-General for
Education, it became clear to me
that we could also render useful
services to the industrialized
countries by offering them our
vast experience of the problems
in our fields of competence with
which they are confronted daily.
Moreover as I shall always
emphasize development poses
problems, however different they
may be, to all countries. It is time
that we geared our action ac¬
cordingly and it is also desirable
that the industrialized countries
bring more of their problems to
us so that together we may work
out new forms of co-operation.
