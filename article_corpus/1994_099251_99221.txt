From barbarism
to tolerance
by Kanan Makiya
The history of 17th-century
Europe can help us to
understand intolerance today
Parts of Europe were very wild and
I cruel places in those times. The con¬
tinent was engulfed in religious wars, some
small and some not so small. Germany lost
half its population. Whole tracts of land
were laid waste, their villages were sacked
and the people in them massacred. Very
little value was placed on human life. Some
historians think that the imprint of all this
destruction on German culture and politics
could still be felt in the twentieth century.
Although religion was the principal ide¬
ology in the seventeenth century, attempts
to suppress religious dissent always failed
in practice. In the name of Catholic or
Protestant ideals, ordinary men and women
died in droves.
Did all the fanaticism and destruction in
Europe usher in a new age "teaching
mankind by the rudest possible process", as
one writer put it, "the hard lesson of tol¬
eration"? Hardly, since national wars very
quickly replaced religious ones, and ideo¬
logical wars soon found their way back
into European affairs. But the forms of
intolerance tended to change in Europe.
And that is important. Cruelty and forms
of punishment, for instance, became an
issue. And if a kinder, less cruel age was not
ushered in, it is fair to say that a powerful
new idea was born.
