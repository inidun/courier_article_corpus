interview
I What was the first film you
ever saw?
A kind of German spaghetti western
called The Children of Mara Mara. I've
never come across it again, but it made
a very strong impression on me it
showed some children hung up on
meat hooks, like in a butcher's. That
was in 1953, when I was thirteen.
> Had you never been to the
cinema before that?
No, never. We mainly listened to
the radio. I remember that two or three
years later I saw Jean Cocteau's The
Blood of a Poet, and another high¬
light of that period was Alfred Hitch¬
cock's Rear Window.
I Was that when you first
wanted to make a film?
What I wanted, when I was about
fourteen, was to do something dif¬
ferent; I didn't want to be a doctor or a
lawyer, for example. Like a lot of
teenagers I wrote poetry and short sto¬
ries, but what I was looking for, even
more than a means of self-expression,
was a way of exploring the world. I
remember being fascinated by an
article in a magazine I found in the
cellar, with pictures of a film crew on
location somewhere in Africa men in
caps, camels, a camera on a tripod. I
said to myself, that's what I want to do.
I was also taking a lot of photographs
at that time, but most of all I read. I was
an avid reader, which explains the pas¬
sion I still have for adapting literary
works for the screen.
I What did you read?
A bit of everything, or perhaps I
should say a lot of everything. As
often happens in such cases I read
everything too soon. I was fond of
Faulkner, Hemingway and Balzac I
remember La Peau de chagrin and
Splendeurs et misères des cour¬
tisanes very vividly not forgetting
Dostoevski. I must have been twelve
when I read Schopenhauer: "It's not
at all the sort of thing for you," my
father said.

> Why did you come to
France?
To learn French. When I was
about fifteen or sixteen I went to a
school in Vannes. A Jesuit there had
a great influence on me; we saw eye
to eye in matters of theology, philos¬
ophy and the cinema. It was at the
school film club that I developed my
knowledge of, and love for, the
cinema. I saw what we used to call
the "classics", from Buster Keaton to
Carl Dreyer, and discovered the great
pre-war German directors, Fritz Lang
in particular. A little later I got to know
the work of Friedrich Murnau, Ewald
André Dupont I'm thinking of his
film Varietyand Lupu-Pick.
> What about the films that
were coming out then?
I was impressed by many of them,
especially Elia Kazan's On the Water¬
front, with Marlon Brando, which
opened my eyes to the fact that the
cinema was capable of doing some¬
thing about injustice. There was also
Alain Resnais' Nuit et brouillard
{Night and Fog) with its powerful rev¬
elation of the death camps, and, in a
very different register, Henri Verneuil's
Please, Mr. Balzac, with Brigitte
Bardot and Darry Cowl, and Federico
Fellini's // Bidone (The Swindlers).
> In what way did they affe ct
you?
I gradually realized that making
films is a proper job that has to be
learned. After getting my school-
leaving certificate in France I enrolled
at IDHEC, the French school of cine¬
matography, but I didn't take the
course. ... In fact, owing to a series
of coincidences I was taken on as a
trainee by Louis Malle. He was
making Zazie dans le métro at the
time. That was my real introduction to
directing. I've been in films ever
since. . . .
> How did your career
develop?
It began in France, where I worked
Volker Schlöndorff's Young
Törless (Fed. Rep. of
Germany, 1966), based on a
story by Robert Musil, with
Matthieu Carrière (left) in
the title role.

under Jean-Pierre Melville and Louis
Malle, and then I decided I wanted to
be a German director and went back
to Germany. The first film I made, in
1965, was Der Junge Törless
("Young Törless"), based on the
novel by the Austrian writer Robert
Musil. It went down well. I then made
two more pictures with the actor and
film director Margarethe von Trotta. In
1978, my adaptation of the Günter
Grass novel Die Blechtrommel (The
Tin Drum) won awards at Cannes and
in Hollywood. I was deeply Involved In
the German film movement of the
1960s and 1970s alongside
Alexander Kluge, Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, Peter Fleischmann, Werner
Herzog and others. When that move¬
ment broke up, I left for the United
States, where I worked mainly for tele¬
vision. I also made Swann in Love,
based on Proust's novel.
i What are your recollections
of the United States?
The working conditions were
excellent, and I made films with such
Hollywood legends as Dustin
Hoffman and Richard Widmark. But I
find it hard to accept that films are
ordinary commercial products. I
believe that film-making, whether it is
an art as some people claim or just a
means of expression, deserves better.
The absolute power enjoyed by pro¬
ducers and distributors in the United
States gets in the way of such
expression at least as far as I'm con¬
cerned! Directors have to wage a
hard, endless struggle that in the long
run wears out even the most resilient.

All the same, I would be happy to
go back to the United States to make
a film. I have some good friends there,
especially Billy Wilder, who made
Some Like it Hot, an amusing, astute
man. I go along with his idea that film
directors are showmen. . . .
> What does he mean by that,
exactly?
He says a director is like a music-
hall magician. He gets about the same
amount of applause every evening
but now and again, when he is in the
middle of his act, a beautiful naked
woman crosses the stage behind
him, unbeknown to him, and the
audience goes wild. He goes home
that night, well pleased with himself,
thinking: "That's it, I've found how to
do it, I've made it!" The next day he's
back on stage, raring to go. . . .
I But the naked lady, in other
words the sudden incursion
of life, fails to materialize?
Not that evening. It's impossible to
know when she will appear, but the
important thing is that she doesn't
walk out on us, that we still have a
chance. . . .
I After the United States you
returned to Germany. . . .
Yes, I moved around. I made
another film, my most recent, The
Voyager, based on the novel Homo
Faber by the German-speaking Swiss
writer Max Frisch. Then, in 1990, an
outstanding opportunity occurred,
the possibility of taking over the leg¬
endary Babelsberg studios of which I
am now director. These studios, at
Potsdam, near Berlin, in the former
German Democratic Republic, embody
the whole history of German cinema.
After reunification the question of
what to do with Babelsberg arose.
The technical facilities were in a dilap¬
idated state and everything needed
seeing to. I hesitated at first but then
took the plunge, helped by my old
friend Peter Fleischmann. Now the
studios are coming back to life and in
a little while we may well have
Europe's finest movie factory.
Is European cinema still a
feasible proposition?
Very much so. In the first place
there is the heartening example of
French cinema, which has managed
to stand up for itself better than the
others and Is doing well. We shall try
and take a lesson from the French
legislation. We are also encouraged
by the upturn In cinema attendance in
Germany and Britain, in addition to
which it seems obvious to me that, in
the cinema as in other spheres,
Europe still has plenty to say and
plenty to offer. Diversity is Europe's
strong point.
But surely the American
cinema dominates the
market in Europe, as it does
elsewhere.
In the movie theatres, yes, but tele¬
vision Is different. On television, most
of the big hits I'm talking about fea¬
ture films are domestic products.
There's no question of closing the
door to American film imports; that
would be ridiculous, and impossible
in any case! We simply have to
explain patiently and in simple terms,
as we aim to do in all our discussions
and negotiations with European insti¬
tutions, that there is room for another
form of cinema. This ambitious, high-
quality cinema is European cinema;
but it is also the rest of world cinema,
that of Nikita Mikhalkov, Zhang
Yimou, Abbas Kiarostami, Souley-
mane Cissé and a thousand other
young directors who will all go under
if we go under, without having had
the opportunity to make a film. Don't
forget that as well as producing films
Europe also coproduces them, in
Europe itself and outside of Europe.
> So there is no cause for
pessimism?
Nor for complacency. The struggle
ahead will be long, hard and compli¬
cated, since it Involves both eco¬
nomic and artistic considerations.
I What about the crisis in the
cinema?
That's nothing new. All my films
were made in a state of crisis, so. . . .
I So you think the crisis is
more apparent than real?
Of course not: Europe's film
output, for instance, has fallen off
considerably. We have not always
been aware of the danger ahead, but
there is no cinema crisis as such. In
point of fact, more films are being
seen today than ever before. The dif¬
ference is that now we often watch
them at home, on television or on
video. Does that mean the cinema is
weaker, is cinema-going no longer the
incomparable experience that set my
heart beating faster when I saw On
the Waterfront at the age of fifteen?
The answer depends on us.
