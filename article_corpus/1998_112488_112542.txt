W hen Linus To rvalds created a “ f r e e ”
o p e rating system called Linux in
1 9 9 1 , little did the young Finnish
student imagine he would become the stan-
dard-bearer of a crusade to preserve the open-
ness and co-operat i ve spirit that have been the
basis of the Intern e t ’s and the World W i d e
We b ’s success, in the face of “ b i g, bad Bill

A beacon in the world of free software, Linux is used by
an estimated seven million people worldwide. Enthusiasts
say this operating system is a refreshing alternative to
commercial software.
least partly protected from market forces.
At stake are the free movement of ideas
and the dynamism of research. “Free soft-
ware is an area of technical wo r k , bu t
a b ove all, it is a matter of ethical philoso-
p hy,” s ays Richard Stallman, an A m e ri c a n
computer pioneer and head of the Free
S o f t ware Fo u n d at i o n .
“Computer pro-
grammes can be nat u-
rally duplicated to infi-
n i t y, like theorems,”
s ays Bernard Lang of
the French Institute
for Computer and
A u t o m ation Research
( I N R I A ) . “But nowa d ays the rules of the
m at e rial world are being imposed on the
i m m at e ri a l . Research is controlled by a few
s o f t ware companies. They use propri e t a ry
s t a n d a r d s and fo rm at s, which nobody
u n d e rs t a n d s , to cling to their monopoly. A s
a result, they are forced to constantly chan-
ge their products before other companies
figure out how they’re made. This control
over standards kills competition and fetters
c r e at i v i t y, whereas freeware is a source of
constant innovat i o n .”
Linux proves the point. Available free
of charge on the Intern e t , it is part of cy b e-
r h u m a n i t y ’s shared heri t a g e .The progr a m-
me uses public stan-
d a r d s , is close to the
Unix operating system
and works equally we l l
on a Mac or a PC and
e ven on slower compu-
t e rs. Linux meets three
f r e e ware cri t e ri a . I t s
source code is ava i l a b l e ,
so anyone can take part in developing it or
can modify it to suit their needs; it can be
freely copied and redistri bu t e d ; and anyo-
ne can improve it, as long as they make the
source code for the changes available to
e ve ryo n e .
“Linux isn’t just one big entity,” s ay s
R o b e rt Yo u n g, president of Redhat
S o f t wa r e , an A m e rican firm that distri-
butes the product. “ I t ’s a collection of lots
of little part s. Each has its own team of
p r o gr a m m e rs on the Internet and a team
leader who approves or rejects the altera-
tions suggested. And the ultimate boss is
To rva l d s.”
Linux enthusiasts, most of them engi-
n e e rs and science students, u n a n i m o u s l y
laud the product. “ I t ’s quick, compact and
ve ry secure—a huge asset if you want to
c r e ate a patent data base or a secure pay-
ment system. It’s a far cry from the
Microsoft equiva l e n t ,W i n d ows NT, w h i c h
has security gaps,” s ays Jean Roure of
A c t i c i e l , a French company that designs
we b s i t e s. “ Pe rs o n a l l y, I’m not wa ging wa r
on Microsoft,” he adds. “I just want to gi ve
my customers the best of the Internet and
Linux lets me do that . If a pri vate firm came
up with a better offer, I ’d pay the pri c e .”
“ We ’re fighting Microsoft, the most
a g gr e s s i ve firm and the one best at marke-
ting its products,” s ays Yo u n g . “So why are

companies turning to Linux? Because it
d o e s n ’t crash and it works ve ry we l l . A n d
w hy is it so good? Because it has the wo r l-
d ’s biggest team of software engi n e e rs who
are constantly improving it, just for the
l ove of it.” T h at ’s the spirit of the cy b e r-
c o m m u n i t y. “Free software is a communi-
ty project and eve ryone who depends on it
ought to look for ways to contri bute to
building the community,” s ays Stallman.
People who work on it don’t make money
but they do earn a reputation—not such a
bad deal. To rvalds was an unknown stu-
dent in Helsinki. Because of Linux, e ve ry
firm in Silicon Valley wanted to hire him
when he gr a d u at e d .To d ay he is working at
Tr a n s m e t a , a new A m e rican high-tech
c o m p a ny.
Another big advantage Linux offers is
efficient “ a f t e r - gi ve away serv i c e .” “If yo u
h ave a problem,” s ays Roure, “ you log on
to a discussion group and even at two in
the morning you’ll always find someone
who knows someone who has an answe r.
I t ’s free and takes 20 minutes. If there’s a
hacker at t a c k , for example, the group will
tell you ‘ h e r e ’s how to defend yo u rs e l f.’ I t ’s
i nva l u a b l e . With commercial softwa r e ,
yo u ’re completely at
the company ’s mercy
and it may be we e k s
before you get an ans-
we r.”
Another fan is
L e c t r a - S y s t è m e s , t h e
wo r l d ’s leading com-
puter-assisted textile
m a n u fa c t u r e r , which recently started using
L i n u x . “The system is generally popular
with our customers ,” s ays Pierre Ficheux,
a senior exe c u t i ve with the company,
“especially the ones who don’t know any-
thing about computers and think it’s
W i n d ow s ! ” With no head office, no stock
exchange quotation and no adve rt i s i n g
v i s i b i l i t y, Linux makes some people feel
u n e a s y. “ We don’t use Microsoft much,
but we ’ ve kept it to reassu-
re our customers ,” s ay s
R o u r e . “ People think any-
thing that ’s free must be
i rr e s p o n s i b l e .”
L i n u x ’s main draw-
back is its complexity.
“Most computer-illiterat e
people don’t know how to
use it, although installa-
tion is getting easier and
the number of simple,
a u t o m ated office-type
a p p l i c ations is on the ri s e ,”

according to Roure. “ I t ’s still pri m a ri l y
used for complex applications like setting
up network serve rs or for simulat i o n . B y
the way, it was used to create most of the
special effects in Ti t a n i c.”
Young explains, “Most companies
want a specific application—for example a
firm of architects wants a drawing pro-
gramme—and only afterwards bother
about what operating system it uses. L i n u x
has far fewer applications than W i n d ow s
and that ’s the main problem. But it’s only
been in professional use since 1995 and
things are changing ve ry quickly.”
The outlook for Linux is bri g h t . A
number of pri vate firms are starting to live
off it. They are prospering and creat i n g
jobs by offering Linux users services for a
f e e . A case in point is Redhat Softwa r e ,
with 40 employees and a $6 million turn o-
ve r in 1997, a figure expected to rise to $10
million this ye a r. Founded in 1995, R e d h at
specializes in custom-made systems and
sells Linux on a CD-ROM updated eve ry
six months. “ We ’re playing with 450 pro-
gr a m m e s ,” s ays Yo u n g, “including com-
mercial software compatible with Linux.
We put it together according to our custo-
m e rs ’ needs and set an
overall framewo r k . I n
1997 we had 150,000
c u s t o m e rs , 80,000 of
them in the U. S . a n d
50,000 in Europe. O u r
C D - ROM costs $50, o r
nothing if you dow n-
load it from the
I n t e rn e t , which is what most of our two
million or so users do.”
So why pay? “ I t ’s like asking people
who buy bottled water why they don’t
d rink it out of the tap. The answer is that
they don’t trust it.We ’re also selling simple
i n s t a l l ation as well as trouble-shooting in
case of a problem.”
Young is keeping a cool head under his
red hat . The battle against the Microsoft
empire has not been wo n
ye t . “So far they have n ’t
caused us any trouble,”
he say s. “ T h at ’s a bad
s i g n . They see us as an
i n t e r e s t i n g, but not ve ry
t h r e atening experi m e n t .
We get far more new cus-
t o m e rs from Unix than
from Microsoft. We ’r e
also expanding the soft-
ware market by cutting
the cost of technology.”■
