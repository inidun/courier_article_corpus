for the lasting eradication of poverty.This calls for
a paradigm shift in thinking about development
from a “do good”approach based on patronage to
one of genuine partnership with the poor.M a h a t m a
Gandhi in India was one of the first to deprecate the
p o l i cy of “poor feeding,” insisting that governments
and communities must enable everyone to e a r n h i s
or her daily bread.
Eco-jobs and micro-credit
to boost village income
These considerations led to the birth of the
biovillage movement in Po n d i c h e r r y. The term
“ b i o v i l l a g e ” is derived from the Greek word b i o s,
which means living, and our priority was just that:
human-centred development. Poverty persists in
conditions where human resources are undervalued
whereas land and material resources are overvalued.
The biovillage model of rural and agricultural
development is designed to remedy this imbalance
by conserving and enhancing natural resources,
eradicating poverty and empowering women.
This programme has been in progress in 19
villages in Pondicherry since 1994, covering a
population of 24,000 people, though we have plans
to extend the scheme to around 375,000 people
throughout the region by 2007. One leg of the
programme is eco-farming, meaning that chemicals
and capital—the building blocks of modern
farming—are replaced with knowledge and
biological inputs like vermiculture [exploitation of
e a r t h w o r m s ] , bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides; t h i s
in turn creates new eco-jobs in villages. Th e
p r o g r a m m e ’s other leg is the creation of more
avenues for rural non-farm employment based on
marketing opportunities.
New opportunities for earning a living are
devised through analyzing a family’s resources.As
a result, landless labouring families take to
household mushroom cultivation, ornamental fis h -
rearing, coir rope-making, rearing small ruminant
animals under stall-fed conditions and other
enterprises which are within their means. Th o s e
with a small plot of land can take to hybrid seed
p r o d u c t i o n , flo r i c u l t u r e,d a i r y i n g,poultry and other
high value enterprises. Groups of assetless women
engage in aquaculture in community ponds. A l l
these exercises are based on micro-level planning,
and enterprises supported by micro-credit.
A range of activities helps enhance total income

B i o v i l l a g e s :
a blueprint for the future?
The father of India’s Green Revolution—and early critic of its abuse —
has a new brainchild: villages where the poor have the means to earn
their living and preserve the land
The 20t h century ended with spectacular
achievements in every field of human
endeavour and the spread of democratic
systems of government. It also ended with
nearly a billion people going to bed
partially hungry and with the universal goals of
“ f o o d , h e a l t h , l i t e r a cy and work for all” s t i l l
remaining distant dreams.The uneven progress in
bringing the benefits of modern science and
technology to the least well-off, particularly in the
areas of medicine, a g r i c u l t u r e, i n f o r m a t i o n
technology and biotechnology, has led to increasing
divides between rich and poor in areas that are
critical to human well-being: d e m o g r a p h i c
distribution, technological and digital access, and
economic power.
Any objective balance sheet of human
achievements during the 20th century thus reveals
both “ b r i g h t ” spots in relation to prosperity built on
technological innovation, and “hot spots” w h e r e
poverty, deprivation and gender inequity remain,
and in some cases have even worsened.
The M. S. Swaminathan Research Fo u n d a t i o n
was established in Chennai [formerly
Madras] in India in 1990 with the aim of
addressing environmental degradation,
population explosion,poverty and gender
injustice at the micro-level in a few such
social “hot spots.” The Fo u n d a t i o n ’s
mandate is to impart a pro-nature, p r o -
poor and pro-women orientation to an
economic growth strategy in rural areas—
a strategy that above all else focuses on
creating jobs. This emphasis stems from
the fact that jobless economic growth is
joyless growth, and the observation that
inadequate purchasing power is the
overriding cause of household food
i n s e c u r i t y.
The Union Territory of Pondicherry in
the state of Tamil Nadu was chosen as the place to
start this adventure in empowering women and
men mired in poverty with skills, information and
access to technology. Such people are poor only
because they have no assets—no land,no livestock,
no houses and often no education.Their only assets
are time and labour.Our challenge was therefore to
enhance the economic value of these assets, a goal
that could be achieved through a transition from
unskilled to skilled work. Asset building and
community development have to be the pathways

capita for villagers) and minimize risks.Education and
t r a i n i n g, social organization and producer- o r i e n t e d
marketing are all crucial to the programme’s success.
Self-help groups operate a community banking system
involving low transaction costs and high loan recovery.
Most importantly, the biovillage movement is based
on i n c l u s i o n and not e x c l u s i o n.The local women and
men who become trainers are inducted into a
Biovillage Corps of Rural Professionals.
An ever-green approach 
to environmental awareness
Most of the nearly 100 members inducted so far
are either semi-literate or even illiterate,but they are
the prime-movers and doers of the biovillage
m o v e m e n t , proving beyond all doubt that the rural
poor can take to new technologies like fish to water,
provided they are able to learn through practical
work experience and not classroom lectures.
How can such a biovillage movement spread?
With the help of the Pondicherry administration, w e
propose to convert all 270 villages in the Territory
into biovillages,a plan that will require a further $15
million (most of which will come from ongoing
programmes for the poor and possibly from the
International Fund for Agricultural Development).
Several institutional structures have accelerated
the pace of change.A Biovillage Council, c o m p r i s i n g
a male and female member from each village,
undertakes strategic planning. A Biocentre serves

as a single-stop resource centre, providing the
necessary inputs, information and training. A n d

connection provides information to families on
h e a l t h , e d u c a t i o n , e n t i t l e m e n t s, e c o - t e c h n o l o g i e s
and marketing.
The biovillage model helps bridge all four
d i v i d e s — d e m o g r a p h i c, d i g i t a l , economic and
t e c h n o l o g i c a l . It promotes harmony with nature and
with each other. It is based on eco-technologies,w h i c h
are environmentally benign,economically viable and
socially equitable. It shows the path to an ever- g r e e n
revolution in agriculture,where productivity advances
can take place without leading to ecological or social
h a r m . The choice of technologies is fle x i b l e. A n d
while the concept has certain ground rules, like a
“ p r o - n a t u r e,pro-poor and pro-women”orientation to
spreading technology and a partnership approach to
eradicating poverty, the precise action plans are
developed by the villagers in association with
p r o f e s s i o n a l s.The virtual colleges linking scientists and
rural families help to hasten the spread of such
symbiotic partnerships. Under UNESCO’s A s i a n
Ecotechnology Network, the biovillage paradigm of
sustainable human development is now spreading to
other parts of India and to other nations.It has led to
the emergence of many new voices and leaders in the
v i l l a g e s, who in turn ensure the programme—like
the communities it involves—can survive and prosper.
