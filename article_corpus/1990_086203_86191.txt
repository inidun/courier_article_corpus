Responding
to the challenge
1 he effort required to carry out mass literacy
campaigns, to provide the necessary post-literacy
work, and to make primary education available
to all, still represents an enormous challenge to
the countries of Asia and the Pacific.
It is true that the literacy rate in the region
rose from 39.6 per cent in 1960 to 60.4 per cent
in 1980 and that during the same period the num¬
ber of literate adults increased from 393 million
to 953 million. It is estimated that the figure for
1990 is 1,377 million, and that it may rise to 1,888
million by the year 2000. But the picture is not
as bright as it may seem. The total number of
illiterates rose from 600 million in 1960 to 628
million in 1980. If this trend continues, the figure
will persist into the early 1990s and will then fall
slightly to 562 million in the year 2000.
In 1990 most of the countries in the region
will, admittedly, have achieved 70 per cent
literacvthe crucial point beyond which it seems
to be proven that the literacy process is self-
perpetuating until illiteracy is virtually eradicated.
Fiji, Malaysia, Viet Nam and the Philippines
are among the eastern and south-eastern Asian
countries which in 1990 should achieve a literacy
rate of 80 per cent, while the Maldives, Mongolia,
Sri Lanka and Thailand will have passed the 90
per cent mark. Four out of five Indonesians and
three out of four Chinese and Turks will also be
literate in 1990.
Nonetheless there will still be 200 million
illiterate persons in China, 23 million in Indonesia
and 8.7 million in Turkey. The problem is more
acute in central and southern Asia: in 1990, the
literacy rate will probably exceed 50 per cent in
India and in Papua New Guinea, and 60 per cent
in Iran, but Bangladesh and Pakistan will achieve
a maximum of 40 per cent, and Bhutan, Nepal
and Afghanistan will not exceed 30 per cent.
The problem of illiteracy in Asia and the
Pacific is also notable for a "gender gap". While the
number of male illiterates fell from 247 million
in 1970 to 233 million in 1985, the number of
female illiterates increased during the same period
from 390 million to 418 million.
To attain the objective of universal literacy by
the year 2000, the countries of Asia and the Pacific
will have to educate 62 million adults (15 years
and over) each year. Aware of the immensity of
the task facing them, these countries launched a
Unesco-coordinated Asia-Pacific Programme of
Education for All (APPEAL) in 1987. The pro¬
gramme concentrates notably on the introduction
of new teaching methods in order to respond to
the basic needs of marginalized rural and urban
populations, women, minorities and the under¬
privileged. SHOZO JIZAWA 15
