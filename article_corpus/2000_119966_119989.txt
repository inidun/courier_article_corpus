The first rays of morning sun appear through the
w i n d ow.The water boils, the dry clothes must be
brought in, the children woken up. In the humble
house where Damiana Barrientos lives in one of
L i m a ’s southern subu r b s , a new day is begi n n i n g .
But for Damiana, this is no ordinary daw n :t o d ay she
must go to court .
In Fe b ru a ry 2000,Damiana won the right to free
medical care from the Pe ruvian health ministry until
she makes a full recove ry from an operation per-
f o rmed against her will. “ E ve rything began in the
m at e rnity ward of a Lima hospital in 1998 when I gave
b i rth to my baby,who died a few days after I had a cae-
s a r e a n ,” s ays Damiana.“There they cut my fa l l o p i a n
tubes and forged my signature on a paper saying I had
c o n s e n t e d .But complications emerged afterwa r d s ,a n d
n ow I’m suffering from a dropped uteru s.”She we n t
to the court s , but though the state acknowledged that
there were “ d e ficiencies in the quality of care,”her case
was closed.Thanks to law ye rs from the Committee for
the defence of wo m e n ’s rights in Latin A m e rica and
the Caribbean (CLADEM-Pe ru) and to the Mov i-
miento Amplio de Mujeres group (MAM), D a m i a n a ’s
case was taken to the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights, where it is now awaiting sentence.To
d at e , CLADEM has filed legal complaints over 243
cases of forced steri l i s at i o n .1
Since 1996, when the first evidence emerged of
s e rious violations of human rights through the imple-
m e n t ation of vo l u n t a ry surgical steri l i s at i o n ,MAM and
CLADEM have sought to reform the family planning
p o l i cy embraced by the Pe ruvian gove rnment in 1995,
and aimed at reducing the birth rate in rural areas from
5.6 children for each woman to an average of 2.5
children by the year 2000.“Our goal was to ensure that
women could freely opt for one of the va rious methods
of family planning and get the gove rnment to prov i d e
i n f o rm ation on all the altern at i ves rather than impose
vo l u n t a ry steri l i s ation as the only possible method,”
s ays CLADEM’s Giulia Ta m ayo.
“Health festivals”
According to CLADEM,the family planning pro-
gramme heralded by President A l b e rto Fujimori as a
way to make health services more democratic and
t r a n s f o rm women into “ m a s t e rs of their destiny ”h a s
been conve rted since 1996 into a policy of forced
s t e ri l i s ation devoted to meeting national quotas,w i t h
s u r gical steri l i s ation as the only option.To make the
l atter more popular,“health festiva l s ” were organized
in which women were goaded into agreeing to undergo
the operat i o n . “ We decided to have only two chil-
d r e n .T h at ’s why we chose to have our tubes cut, a n d
we are happy!”Messages like this featured prominently
on the colourful banners hoisted in villages to
announce the health festiva l s , which would last bet-
ween one and three days and include sporting activi-
ties and public concert s.
D u ring the festiva l s , va c c i n ation campaigns,
tests for breast and uterus cancer and dental check-
ups were promised, but not all of these serv i c e s
were provided.No official information is available
on the number of festivals held between 1996 and

1 9 9 8 , though according to the health ministry,
there were 463 “ c a m p a i g n s ” in the first half of
1996, which were attended by 120,000 people in
remote rural areas.
“These massive campaigns were preceded by
home visits carried out by medical wo r k e rs with the
aim of winning over fertile women with more than four
c h i l d r e n .People lived in a state of permanent anxiety,”
declares Ta m ayo. R e p o rts collected by Ta m ayo indi-
c ate that couples were explained the benefits of the sur-
g e ry, which was presented as the only option, b e f o r e
being forced to sign a document.Those who under-
went the operation were then presented with 15 kilo-
grammes of food, while the health worker who suc-
cessfully persuaded the woman in question wa s
awarded a bonus.
CLADEM gathered together a large number of
complaints proving that the poor sanitary conditions
in which the steri l i s ations were carried out had caused
s e rious complicat i o n s , sometimes leading to deat h ,
and that these after-effects were not just limited to iso-
l ated cases as the gove rnment had claimed, but we r e
p a rt and parcel of a vast systematic practice. In the
absence of any official answe rs to its questions,
CLADEM called on the press at the end of 1997 to
make the complaints public and put direct pressure
on the gove rn m e n t .
“Not all of the family planning programme is
w r o n g .We don’t oppose it, but we want to point out
the traumatic results of the coercive implementat i o n
of vo l u n t a ry steri l i s at i o n ,” o b s e rves MAM’s María
Esther Mogollón. In 1998, her organization decided
to check out reports that had emerged from Lima and
the country ’s interi o r.“Fifty vo l u n t e e rs visited hospitals
in 19 out of the 25 districts where the programme had
been applied to talk with those affected and with doc-
t o rs ,” s ays Mogollón. “The two most serious pro-
blems we saw were medical negligence and a lack of
i n f o rm ation for wo m e n ,” she adds. MAM has since
decided to distri bute pamphlets listing the rights of
health service users , and urging them to contact an
e m e r g e n cy advice hotline in the event of any abu s e s
of those ri g h t s.
O f ficial statistics report that 800,000 couples we r e
attended by state family planning services in 1998,bu t
t h at only 3.5 per cent chose vo l u n t a ry steri l i s at i o n ,a n d
t h at so far the total number of sterilised men and
women in Pe ru stands at 300,000 —in a proport i o n
of 10 women to each man. U n o f ficial fig u r e s , i n
c o n t r a s t , suggest that almost 500,000 people have
undergone the surgery.
Fo l l owing the campaigns mounted by
CLADEM and MAM, the health ministry has been
forced to change its methods, and now incorp o r at e s
the MAM pamphlet in the inform ation it distri bu t e s ,
as well as offering two advice sessions to would-be
patients: one on contraceptive methods, and the
other on the contraceptive method chosen, i n c l u d i n g
(if necessary) a briefing on the possible complica-
tions and irr e ve rsible nature of surgical steri l i s at i o n .
A 72 hour-period between signing the consent form
and the operation has also been granted to allow for
any second thoughts.
A year after the introduction of these reform s ,
Pe ru ’s family planning programme now maintains a
much lower profil e . No health festivals have been
staged this ye a r ,while according to authori t i e s ,d e m a n d
for vo l u n t a ry steri l i s ation has dropped by 30 per cent.
The main goal of the wo m e n ’s rights groups has been
to condemn the deva s t ating effects and psycholo-
gical damage that have followed the operat i o n s , bu t
their campaigns have helped ensure that poor ru r a l
people can plan their family freely, and learn the way s
of responsible parenting. ■
