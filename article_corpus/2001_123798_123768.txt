“I
t seemed absolutely improbable, b o r d e r i n g
on the impossible,” U. S. Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt said last January in reference
to a water accord reached among seven of
the southwestern U. S. states after five tough
years of negotiation.The challenge he faced in brokering
this agreement is one shared by many senior
administrators around
t h e w o r l d . As increasing
scarcity exacerbates water
c o n flicts within and among
c o u n t r i e s, water nego-
tiations will inevitably grow
in scope and intensity
almost everywhere.
In a thirsty world,
water can no longer be
regarded primarily as a
“strategic asset” that can
be secured and
safeguarded through the
instruments of
conventional security, l e a s t
of all through the use of
f o r c e.As with atmospheric
pollution leading to ozone
depletion and climate
c h a n g e, or with the
depletion of renewable
resources such as fish
stocks and forests, w a t e r
disputes involve a whole range of political,economic,
social and scientific considerations.The challenge lies in
finding and maintaining a balance between political
and technical priorities.To this end, the United Nations
has developed a framework convention to guide fresh
water negotiations—which 10 states have ratified out of
the 35 required for the treaty to come into force.
National governments are,h o w e v e r, increasingly turning
to an alternative form of negotiation involving neutral
m e d i a t o r s, who work closely with international
o r g a n i z a t i o n s, development banks, and a wide cross
section of groups concerned about the future of water
use.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its 1999
annual report, offered to mediate regional water
disputes as part of a policy to increase access to clean
water in A s i a .And the work of the World Commission
on Dams is cited by many as a remarkable feat of
consensus building between widely divergent interests
around a highly controversial development issue.
From these experiments and other environmental
n e g o t i a t i o n s, we can
highlight some key
principles and “ b e s t
p r a c t i c e s ” in water
negotiations.
Finding a 
unified voice
To begin with,it is not
always obvious who
should be at the
negotiation table. Th e
standard response is for
national governments to
treat water as a foreign
policy matter, and thus to
charge their top-level
diplomats with working
out bi- or multi-lateral
a g r e e m e n t s. It is a mistake,
however, not to include a
host of non-governmental
actors in these
negotiations (farmers,
industry, environmental and women’s groups, etc.),
whose activities directly affect the condition of a
w a t e r s h e d , and whose livelihoods depend on the
r e s o u r c e.These groups,along with local authorities and
indigenous groups, can offer relevant technical and
traditional knowledge necessary to mitigate the
stresses and strains suffered by a water system.
To be effective, these groups must be sufficiently
organized to speak with something approaching a
u n i fied voice. So even before the larger dialogue
b e g i n s, each group must work out its differences
through internal consultations which should continue
throughout the negotiation process. This ongoing
feedback forestalls the tendency of negotiators to

lock into a position before hearing what others have
to say. Just to be certain that all of the key actors are
i n v o l v e d , an impartial mediator should conduct a
series of confidential interviews with all the key
stakeholders to clarify their concerns and identify
additional players that should be included.
Finding the key people is only one element in
preparing for negotiations. Mediators should also
play a role in “joint fact-fin d i n g ” by helping to identify
experts acceptable to everyone involved and by
framing questions that these scientists should then
be commissioned to investigate. Their findings can
help reduce uncertainties and set priorities that may
differ from country to country so that an overall
“package” of proposals can be
c r a f t e d . They can also help to
establish “red lines” o r
thresholds of resource damage
and depletion that would trigger
more stringent obligations
(known as “ c o n t i n g e n t
agreements”).
Once the key people and
data have been assembled, the
actual negotiations can begin.
After a mediator prepares a
written conflict assessment to create an overview of the
parties’ interests and priorities, face-to-face meetings
can begin. They usually start with the business of
setting an agenda and adopting procedural
groundrules that will allow for constructive
deliberation—or the “creation of value”—in an
atmosphere that emphasizes creative problem-solving.
No party is ever pressured to commit or to
compromise in well-managed mediation. At stage
three it is time to decide—or “distribute value.” The
challenge here is to make sure that the goodwill
previously generated isn’t lost as parties fight for
competing proposals. Once an agreement on the
substance is reached informally, the mediator must
then be certain that it is communicated accurately to
the official decision-makers.
Still waiting
for the “Green Helmets”
In treaty-making, much of the focus is on the
painstaking task of drafting written agreements.Yet,
in the global arena, the resulting provisions are
typically difficult if not impossible to legally enforce.
Calls for an international water court are unlikely to
be heeded in the near future. Nor is deployment of
“Green Helmets”—a kind of environmental
counterpart to the existing blue-helmeted United
Nations peacekeeping forces—feasible. I n t e r n a t i o n a l
relations theorists and lawyers hotly debate the
propensity of states to comply with treaty obligations.
Some subscribe to the Machiavellian notion that
nations flout norms with impunity whenever they
think that the costs of adherence outweigh the benefit s.
Others favour the theory that most nations observe
m o s t international law principles and obligations m o s t
of the time, if only to avoid the “ s h a m i n g ”c a m p a i g n s
orchestrated by non-governmental organizations.B u t
even the optimists readily acknowledge that many
factors other than willful disregard get in the way of
perfect compliance.The vague language of many legal
rules, for examples, is a problem. In addition, some
states simply don’t have the capacity—technically or
financially—to do what they have promised.
These constraints must be kept in mind when
transforming informal understandings into binding
c o n t r a c t s.There are a few important ways of enabling
agreements to adjust over time to
changing circumstances and new
n e e d s. One is to build into the
agreement mutually reinforcing,
s t e p-by-step performance re-
q u i r e m e n t s : the continued
cooperation of one side is tied
to compliance by the others.Th i s
reassures more dedicated or
active states that their initiative
and largesse will not be taken
advantage of by laggards.
Penalties might also be levied in the case of non-
compliance, or rewards might be agreed upon ahead
of time for each step completed as promised.
Fi n a l l y,any effective agreement requires the active
engagement of actors operating on the ground.Wa t e r
negotiations can no longer be left solely to elected
l e a d e r s. The conversation must be broadened. We
also need greater transparency with regard to decision-
making and greater rigour with regard to the scientific
basis underlying the agreements reached.These are the
key lessons learned from the two-decade long
experience with environmental treaty-making and
negotiation efforts. ■
