Le sida déferle: a l e r t e z les jeunes!International Y ar 2000: peace is in our ha ds
War and peace
For me, the culture of peace and the humanist values that I insist on are one and the same
t h i n g .N a t u r a l l y, the culture of peace includes the idea of the absence of wa r. Th a t ’s essential
because in a sense peace has become the luxury of developed societies.These societies have
managed to eliminate war from daily life, but only recently. My generation, now reaching the
age of 50,is the first in European history which has not set about killing each other. But war
hasn’t disappeared from everywhere in Europe—look at the former Yu g o s l a v i a .And certainly
not from the rest of the world, which is torn by dozens of armed conflicts which the media
only occasionally report on.We, the developed countries, are no longer at war, but the worl-
d ’s poor people are.The culture of peace is first and foremost about ending war because wa r
isn’t an abstract problem for most of humanity.
If we define war more broadly, to include personal daily violence, from the violence of chil-
dren in the United States who kill their schoolmates with guns to the violence that so many
women are still subjected to, then the culture of peace is part of a broad context of social pro-
b l e m s.Violence is at the root of our societies, and radical cultural change is needed to get rid
of it.The culture of peace is the most fundamental principle of our time, and one that’s easy
for anybody to understand and accept. M.C. n



Revolt against v i o l e n c e
Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells* thinks violence aggravated by globalization will trigger a
new wave of planet-wide opposition
* Mr Castells is professor of
sociology and city and regional
planning at the University of
California at Berkeley (USA).His
trilogy about information
technology and the global
economy, The Information Age:
Economy, Society and Culture,
has been published by Blackwell,
Oxford,UK.
The 3 volumes are: The Rise
of the Network Society (1996),
The Power of Identity (1997) and
End of Millennium (1998).
You predict that a multitude of what you call
ethical-pragmatic movements will gradually join
hands until they’re strong enough to counter the
negative effects of globalization.Do you think
they’ll grow into a kind of worldwide “grand
coalition”?
F i rs t , the word “ c o a l i t i o n ”here shouldn’t be unders-
tood in an organizational sense. I don’t see a sort of
huge intern ational solidarity organization emergi n g
to replace old-style working-class and political orga-
n i z at i o n s. But tools like the Internet could enable
these multifarious movements to keep in touch far
more effectively without coming under the kind of
bu r e a u c r atic control which organizations inevita-
bly deve l o p. I envisage stronger and more regular
interaction between active grassroots communities.
By being perfectly in tune with their own environ-
ments and at the same time connected by the Inter-
n e t , these communities will be capable of precise-
ly targeted activities,while still focusing from time
to time on major international efforts.
What is the basis of your prediction?
A process of eliminat i o n .H i s t o ry shows that injus-
tice and oppression always provoke a reaction.We
l i ve in a ve ry creat i ve wo r l d , where the wealth of
information is growing exponentially, but also in a
world that is increasingly unjust, o p p r e s s i ve and
a b s u r d .There is a huge contrast between the cur-
rent widespread violence and the unive rsal harm o-
ny we could achieve . So there must be a potential
for revolt.
A l s o, the political tools and organizations we ’ ve
used over the past century, especially gove rn m e n t s ,
h ave lost their legi t i m a cy.The vast majority of people
no longer trust them to do anything except follow
initiatives originating elsewhere.
C o l l e c t i ve mobilization against injustice and
oppression is not only inevitable but is already taking
shape—individualism and cynicism are defin i t e l y
not universal;social change is bound to come.But
because political systems are no longer capable of
spearheading it, it will come from outside, from these
m ovements which share humanist ideals and orga-
nizational innovations.
But doesn’t the idea of people coming together
conflict with the general trend towards indivi-
dualism?
Yes and no.Ye s , as far as the dominant ideology of
our advanced societies is concern e d .N o, b e c a u s e
if you take the world as a whole, this grouping of
forces is in tune with vast grassroots move m e n t s
of community solidarity based on spiritual va l u e s
and sense of identity. On the other hand, this col-
l e c t i ve force is radically different from insular gr o u p s
or movements based on exclusion of others. E ve n
if it only acts on a one-off basis it can find a place
for anyone who shares unive rsal values or who
believes in solidarity between humans and human
solidarity with nature.In fact that’s its hallmark.
Will it be strong enough to foster a strategy 
to counter the current shortcomings of globaliza-
tion?
I don’t think a united, c o h e r e n t , l o n g - t e rm strat e-
gy based on a kind of counter-programme is going
to emerge.That would just be harking back to old-
style militancy, an attempt to put new wine in old
b o t t l e s , something which an overwhelming majori-
ty of these new move m e n t s ’m e m b e rs reject.T h e y
will organize highly symbolic gat h e ri n g s , like that
which took place during the World Trade Organi-
z ation conference in Seattle in December 1999. B u t
b a s i c a l l y, they will continue to act in an unco-ordi-
n ated way, focusing on issues that are sometimes
local and sometimes global.By global,I mean eve-
rything from saving whales to fighting against sla-
very.
These movements are having an undeniable
effect on the process of globalizat i o n .The public
m o o d , at least in democratic societies, is playing a
key role. B a s i c a l l y, their most immediate action is
to change the prevailing values of public opinion.
They manage to get traditional political forces and
g ove rnments to adopt these va l u e s ,e ven in a somew-

h at mangled form , because movements use them as
a kind of common curr e n cy at election time.“ A d o p t
these values and we’ll urge people to vote for you,”
they say.Take the example of ecological va l u e s.T h e y
h ave emerged from a changed perception of our
r e l ationship with the env i r o n m e n t .They have ended
up influencing the political system to such an extent
that it has markedly changed its ways in the last 10
or 15 ye a rs , something it wo u l d n e ver have done on
its own.
So the state’s role will still be crucial?
D e fin i t e l y, and that ’s one paradox for these move-
ments which distrust the state so much. A n o t h e r
paradox is that if they were to give priority to pres-
s u ring states to change their policies, they would fa i l
because they would lose their influence in society.
The transmission mechanism does not run from
these movements directly to the stat e , but from the
m ovements to the society and from the society to
the stat e .Basically it’s through awa r e n e s s - c h a n gi n g
in society that they can make their mark.
So are we moving towards a politics which is
increasingly fragmented and fluid?
Yes indeed.And one in which political parties will,
at best, become interm e d i a ries instead of the ini-
t i at o rs they once we r e .They’ll be reduced to taking
the pulse of social movements and translating them
into options for gove rn m e n t . Pa rties unable to do
this will be swept away by the democratic system
because the control and monopoly of inform at i o n
are getting weaker all the time.C o n t r a ry to the recei-
ved wisdom, the media will increasingly report on
e ve rything that ’s going on in society because of the
emergence of countless networks of altern at i ve infor-
m at i o n .The end of the monopoly on inform at i o n
also means the end of gove rn m e n t ’s monopoly on
action. n

Social change is bound to come.
But because political systems are
