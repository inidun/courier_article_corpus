A convenient s o l u t i o n
J.A. Allan*
T h i rsty countries in the
Middle East are
compensating for dwindling
water supplies by importing
‘virtual water’ in the form of
wheat and other farm cro p s.
B e l o w, P rof J. A . A l l a n , a water

and African Studies, o u t l i n e s
the issues surrounding a
c o n t ro v e rsial policy and
concept whose wisdom is
widely questioned (see article
page 31).
It would require an inhuman level of courage for
a political leader of a country that has enjoye d
water security for 5,000 ye a rs to announce that
supplies are no longer adequate. Instead, leaders
insist that supplies are “ s u f f i c i e n t ” . But this is
deceptive. Supplies are “sufficient” for the small
amounts needed for dri n k i n g : one cubic metre per
year per pers o n . They may also cover curr e n t
domestic and industrial needs, although both of
these are on the rise. But there isn’t enough fresh
water to cover these demands in addition to the
tremendous amounts needed for food production.
It takes at least 1,000 cubic metres of low quality
water to raise the amount of food an individual

needs in a year.
Instead of paying the political costs of publicly
recognizing this defic i t ,l e a d e rs rely on the conve n i e n t
solution of “ v i rtual wat e r ” .To raise a tonne of wheat ,
you need 1,000 tonnes of wat e r. I m p o rting a million
tonnes of wheat is the equivalent to importing a billion
tonnes (cubic metres) of wat e r. Since the end of the
1 9 8 0 s , the MENA region has been importing 40
million tonnes of cereals and flour annually. M o r e
v i rtual water “ flow s ” into the region each year than
flows down the Nile into Egypt for agri c u l t u r e .

is extraordinarily cheap. W h e at prices have been
falling for the past century. On the curr e n t

United States and the European Union, wheat is
traded at about half the production cost.

So it seems that the MENA region is simply
making the most of the situat i o n ,i m p o rting a highly
subsidized product containing a precious resource.
Yet depending on intern ational trade for such a
vital resource is not socially acceptable in these
c o u n t ries nor is it a strat e gically secure policy.T h i s
p a rtially explains why in the United Arab Emirat e s
d e s a l i n ated water is either piped kilometres to reach
fa rms in the desert or soil is actually moved from one
area to another to build new fa rms for gr e ater food
self-sufficiency. Up until 1991,Saudi Arabia used
significant amounts of fossil water—which is
extraordinarily pure but non-renewable—to grow

200,000 hectares along the Mediterranean coast at
an estimated capital cost of $25 billion.These are

extreme examples. But consider the case of Egypt,
where about 90 per cent of the national wat e r
budget goes to agriculture and yet another 7.5
million tonnes of grain, equivalent to 7.5 billion
cubic metres of virtual wat e r , were still imported last
year to feed the population of about 63 million.
By downplaying the role of virtual water,there
is a risk that countries will undervalue their own
resources and put off innovat i ve and painful policies.
I rri g ation water is almost free in Egypt, w h i c h
makes for a very expensive policy.The same water
could bring a hundred times more in returns in
the industrial or service sectors. H owe ve r , t h e r e
are major political costs invo l ved in such a transition.
Almost 40 per cent of the labour force works in
agriculture, while most farmers have less than two
hectares each. These people cannot suddenly be
expected to pay for water or abandon their live l i h o o d s.
Time is required to change people’s perceptions of
water and to develop a diverse economy capable of
creating new jobs in other sectors.
Israel is an interesting case in point. This was a
c o u n t ry committed to making the desert bloom. I t s
fa rm e rs have the means to employ the most effic i e n t
i rri g ation systems.And ye t ,d u ring the past ten ye a rs ,t h e
g ove rnment has shown that it is possible to reduce wat e r
a l l o c ations to agri c u l t u r e . It is one of the few countri e s
in the world to charge a high proportion of the delive ry
cost (40 per cent) for irri g ation wat e r. But the curr e n t
p rices would have to double or even treble for the real cost
of water to be recove r e d .
Other MENA countries,like Jordan,Tunisia and
M o r o c c o, are starting to take the same approach.
The trade in virtual water could offer more time and
ease the political tensions in making this difficult
transition. Or it could be used to avoid dealing with
a very real problem. n
