outset, to certain novel and 
daring forms of mathematical 
thought. […] 
The criticism to which the 
experimental psychologists of the 
beginning of this century, and the 
traditional economists and demo-
graphers, are open is certainly not 
that they have paid too much 
attention to mathematics, but 
rather that they have not paid 
enough; that they have simply 
borrowed quantitative methods 
which, even in mathematics itself, 
are regarded as traditional and 
largely outmoded, and have not 
realized that a new school of 
mathematics is coming into being 
and is indeed expanding enor-
mously at the present time – a 
school of what might almost be 
called qualitative mathematics, 
paradoxical as the term may seem 
because a rigorous treatment no 
longer necessarily means recourse 
to measurement. This new mathe-
matics (which incidentally simply 
gives backing to, and  …
In the last ten years or so 
these ideas, which were of such 
interest to the ancient world, 
have once more become matters 
of immediate practical concern; 
for it should be noted immediately 
that the developments to which 
this number of the International 
Social Science Bulletin hopes to 
make a modest contribution are 
by no means confined to the 
social sciences. They are also to 
be seen in the so-called sciences 
of man (if a distinction can in fact 
be made between the two groups). 
I would go even further, and say 
that the most sensational develo-
pments were perhaps first seen in 
the  sciences of man – possibly 
because, at first sight, those 
 sciences seem the most remote 
from any idea of exactitude and 
measurement, but also, in all pro-
bability, because the  essentially 
qualitative object of their study 
made it impossible for them to 
‘tag along’ behind traditional 
mathematics, as the social 
 sciences have done for so long, 
and forced them to turn, from the 
When we consider the history 
of science, it looks as if man 
realized, at a very early stage, 
what his programme of research 
was to be and then, once having 
decided on it, took hundreds of 
years to acquire the means of 
 carrying it out. In the earliest 
days of scientific thought, the 
Greek philosophers stated the 
problems of physics in terms of 
the atom, and now, two thousand 
five hundred years later – in a 
way that they probably never 
guessed – we are just beginning 
to fill in the framework which 
they outlined so long ago. The 
same might be said of the appli-
cation of mathematics to the pro-
blems of mankind, for the 
speculations of the earliest geo-
meters and arithmeticians were 
concerned with man far more than 
with the physical world. Pythago-
ras was deeply interested in the 
anthropological significance of 
numbers and figures, and Plato 
was much taken up with similar 
considerations. 
human mathematiCS
Human mathematics will escape the 
despair of “great numbers” – the raft 
to which the social sciences, lost in an 
ocean of figures, have been helplessly 
clinging, says Lévi-Strauss in an article 
published in the Social Science Bulletin in 
1954, which recommends co-ordinating 
methods of thought. Excerpts

… expands on, earlier specu-
lative thought) teaches us that 
the domain of necessity is not 
necessarily the same as that of 
quantity.
Neither addition, 
nor multiplication, 
marriage can be 
expressed  
as equations
This distinction became clear to 
the present writer in circumstan-
ces which it may perhaps be per-
missible to recall in this context. 
When, about 1944, he gradually 
became convinced that the rules 
of marriage and descent were not 
fundamentally different, as rules 
of communication, from those 
prevailing in linguistics, and that 
it should therefore be possible to 
give a rigorous treatment of them, 
the established mathematicians 
whom he first approached treated 
him with scorn. Marriage, they 
told him, could not be assi-
milated either to addition 
or to multiplication (still 
less to subtraction or divi-
sion), and it was therefore 
impossible to express it in 
mathematical terms. 
This went until the day 
when one of the young lea-
ders of the new school, 
having considered the pro-
blem, explained that, in 
order to develop a theory 
of the rules of marriage, 
the mathematician had 
absolutely no need to 
reduce marriage to quanti-
tative terms; in fact, he did 
not even need to know 
what marriage was. All he 
asked was, firstly, that it should 
be possible to reduce the marria-
ges observed in any particular 
society to a finite number of cate-
gories and, secondly, that there 
should be definite relationships 
between the various categories 
(e.g. that there should always be 
the same relationship between 
the “category” of the parents’ 
marriage and “category” of the 
children’s). From then on, all the 
rules of marriage in a given 
society can be expressed as equa-
tions and these equations can be 
treated by tested and reliable 
methods of reasoning, while the 
intrinsic nature of the phenome-
non studied –  marriage – has 
nothing to do with the problem 
and can indeed remain completely 
unknown.
Small numbers,  
big changes
Brief and simple as this example 
is, it is a good illustration of the 
direction now likely to be fol-
lowed in collaboration between 
mathematics and the sciences of 
man. In the past, the great diffi-
culty has arisen from the qualita-
tive nature of our studies. If they 
were to be treated quantitatively, 
it was either necessary to do a 
certain amount of juggling with 
them or to simplify to an exces-
sive degree. Today, however, there 
are many branches of mathema-
tics – set theory, group theory, 
topology, etc. – which are concer-
ned with establishing exact rela-
tionships between classes of 
individuals distinguished from 
one another by discontinuous 
values, and this very disconti-
nuity is one of the essential cha-
racteristics of qualitative sets in 
relation to one another and was 
the feature, in which their alleged 
“incommensurability”, “inexpres-
sibility”, etc., consisted. 
This mathematics of man – to 
be discovered along lines that 
neither mathematicians nor 
sociologists have as yet 
been able to determine 
exactly, and which is, no 
doubt, still to be elabora-
ted to a very large extent 
– will, in any event, be very 
different from the mathe-
matics which the social 
sciences once sought to use 
in order to express their 
observations in precise 
terms.
It is resolutely determi-
ned to break away from the 
hopelessness of the “great 
numbers” – the raft to

old tradition, for the earliest 
Greek philosophers, the sages of 
China and India, and the thinkers 
of the peoples who lived in Africa 
and America before colonial times

cance and peculiar properties of

Think both 
mathematically and 
sociologically
The enormous majority of social 
scientists have, even now, had a 
classical or empirical training. 
Very few of them have mathema-
tical background and, even if they 
have, it is often very elementary 
and very conservative. The new

ging; its ultimate object is no 
longer to plot progressive and 
continuous movements in mono-
tonous graphs. The field with 
which it is concerned is not that 
of the infinitesimal variations 
revealed by the analysis of vast 
accumulations of data. The pictu-
res it gives is, rather, that resul-
ting from the study of small 
numbers and of the great changes 
brought about by the transition 
from one number to another. If 
the example is permissible, I 
would say that we are less concer-
ned with the theoretical conse-
quences of a 10 percent increase 
in the population in a country 
having 50 million inhabitants 
than with the changes in struc-
ture occurring when a “two- 
person household” becomes a 
“three-person household”.

sciences by certain aspects of 
contemporary mathematical thin-
king will therefore call for a 
considerable effort of adaptation 
on the part of the social scien-
tists. A good example of what can 
be done in this direction was 
recently set by Social Science 
Research Council of the United 
States of America, which, during 
the summer of 1953, organized a 
mathematics seminar for social 
scientists at Darmouth College in 
New Hampshire. Six mathemati-
cians gave an eight-weeks course 
for 42 persons on the principles 
of the set theory, the group 
theory and the calculus of 
probabilities. 
It is to be hoped that experi-
ments of this sort will be made 
more often and more generally.

and the revolutionary new offe-
rings of mathematical research 
and culture. 
It would, however, be wrong to 
suppose that the whole problem 
consists simply in reorganizing 
instruction, so as to enable social 
scientists to take advantage of 
the latest advances in mathe-
matical thought. It is not 
simply, nor indeed mainly a 
question of taking over methods 
and results from the mathema-
tics wholesale. The special 
needs of the social sciences, 
and the distinctive features of 
the subject of their study 
necessitate a special effort of 
adaptation and invention on 
the part of mathematicians.
Co-ordination of 
methods of thought
One-way collaboration is not 
enough. On the one hand, 
mathematics will help the 
advance of the social sciences 
but, on the other, the special

countries; but the tea-
chers and administra-
tors, most of whom 
have had a traditional 
training, are intellec-
tually ill-equipped to 
plan and carry out such 
a revision. International 
action by the very few 
specialists throughout 
the world who are now 
able to think both 
mathematically and 
sociologically, in terms 
of the new situation, 
therefore seems parti-
cu l a r ly  de s i r ab l e . 
UNESCO would render 
the social sciences an incalculable 
service if it concentrated on wor-
king out a sort of theoretical 
model course in social science 
(which could subsequently be 
adapted to suit local circumstan-
ces), that would strike a proper 
balance between the traditional 
contribution of those sciences 
requirements of those 
sciences will open up new 
possibilities for mathema-
tics. Viewed in this light, a 
new form of mathematics 
therefore has to be develo-
ped. This cross-fertilization 
has, for the past two years, 
been the main object of the 
Seminar on the Use of 
Mathematics in the Human 
and Social Sciences, organi-
zed at UNESCO House in 
1953 and 1954 under the 
auspices of the Internatio-
nal Social Science Council, 
in which mathematicians, 
physicists and biologists 
(on the natural science 
side) and economists, sociolo-
gist s, histor ians, linguist s, 
anthropologists and psycho-ana-
lysis (on the human and social 
science side) have taken part. It 
is still to early to assess the 
results of this daring experiment; 
but whatever shortcomings it may 
have had – which are only to be 
expected in this period of trial 
and error – all involved in it are 
unanimous in stating that they 
gained much from the seminar. 
For man suffers quite as much, 
in his inner life, from “intellectual 
watertight compartments” as he 
does, in his community life, from 
the distrust and hostility between 
different groups. By working for 
the co-ordination of methods of 
thought, which cannot for ever 
remain entirely unrelated in the 
various spheres of knowledge, we 
are helping in the quest for an 
inner harmony which may be, on a 
different level from that with 
which UNESCO is concerned but 
no less truly, the real condition 
for wisdom and peace. 
