ccoRDiNG to forecasts by the
United Nations Environ¬
ment Programme (UNEP),
if world energy consump¬
tion were to continue at its
.1990 level, oil reserves
would last 46 years, coal reserves
205 years and natural gas reserves
67 years. In addition, the produc¬
tion and use of these fossil fuels
are responsible for a constant
increase in water, soil and above
all atmospheric pollution by
nitrogen oxides, sulphur and
methane. The amount of carbon
dioxide, which stood at about 6.3
billion tons in 1988, could double
by the year 2010. "By the end of
the 1980s," writes Mostapha K.
Tolba, former Executive Director
of UNEP in his book Saving our
Planet (1992), "it had become
clear that current trends in energy
consumption especially of fossil
fuels could lead to increased
degradation of the global envi¬
ronment (from, for example, acid
rain, urban air pollution and cli¬
mate change), undermining
future development and well-
being across the planet."
Presented as a "clean" form of
energy, nuclear energy raised high
hopes, promising cheap and
abundant electricity. But the
Chernobyl accident, aging power
stations and the build-up of toxic
wastes that are difficult to process
soon cooled people's enthusiasm.
In addition, this form of energy
production is far too expensive
and technologically too onerous
for the developing countries.
Although they are not high on
the political or economic agenda,
probably because oil is cheap, the
so-called renewable energies
solar electricity, biomass, wind
energy, ocean energy have not
been as successful as they deserve.
And so Unesco has decided to
organize this year an international
conference on renewable energy
sources, the World Solar Summit.
The term solar is used symboli¬
cally to designate the different
renewable sources ofenergy. The
meeting, which will take place at
Unesco Headquarters in Paris
from 5 to 9 luly 1993 in close co¬
operation with relevant organi¬
zations, is designed as a summit of
experts.

A group of high-level special¬
ists will assess solar energy devel¬
opment in the two decades since
a conference was last held on the
subject by Unesco in 1973. They
will also explore the future of
renewable energy resources and
will consider the launching of a
World Solar Energy Decade (1995-
2005). The major objective, how¬
ever, will be to formulate a World
Plan ofAction to develop and use
renewable energy resources effec¬
tively.
The moment has come to assess
the state of political and techno¬
logical progress in this field and to
highlight the many advantages
renewable energy sources offer for
the environment, sustainable
development, health, cleaner
industry, a higher degree ofenergy
security and self-sufficiency for
nations. Research and develop¬
ment must be encouraged without
neglecting the socio-cultural and
educational aspects of the use of
solar energy which could change
our way of life. This mission
Unesco, within its fields of com¬
petence, is ready to undertake.
