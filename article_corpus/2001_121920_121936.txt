W
hen the state we a ke n s, d o e s n ’t
organized crime often takes its
place?
The emergence of organized crime
is symptomatic of a malaise in all of
s o c i e t y, which is not necessarily an expression of the
s t a t e ’s weakness. There are strong states in weak
societies and vice versa.The words “ s t a t e,” “ s o c i e t y,”
“ s t r o n g ” and “ w e a k ” can be used in any combination.
Most countries have beautiful constitutions,but in
themselves they do not guarantee the rule of law,
which is instead based on a vibrant civil society, a
strong and independent press, and a real separation of
powers between the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of government. And above all, you need a
culture of lawfulness to prevent the emergence of
organized crime.A strong state,as such, is completely
compatible with the existence of criminal
o r g a n i z a t i o n s. I n d e e d , the state is sometimes the
instrument of criminal systems.
Would you say that the situation is ripe for
organized crime when the social contract linking
society to the state is disrupted?
Ye s.A case in point is what happens after a war.
Look at Kosovo today: the United Nations’ presence
there has not proved sufficient to control organized
c r i m e. Generally speaking, when the relationship
between the state and society deteriorates,all kinds
of shadow or parallel societies, which lie at least
partly outside the scope of the law, increase their
i n flu e n c e. These shadow societies can assume a
political expression, for example, as liberation
m o v e m e n t s ; a religious expression, as millenarian
s e c t s ; or a criminal form, as in the mafia or triads.
There are currently dozens of countries in the midst
of a transition period which will hopefully lead to
stronger democracies.But during this stage, they are
susceptible to higher levels of organized crime.Th e y
are nevertheless better off than countries ruled by
military “ k l e p t o c r a c i e s.”
H ow does organized crime establish its influ e n c e ?
To start with, the use of similar methods enables
organized crime to co-exist with the state.Some secret
services use the same clandestine practices as criminal
o r g a n i z a t i o n s, such as safe houses, c o r r u p t i o n ,
blackmail and wet jobs [murder]. R e s i s t a n c e
movements may also do the same in wartime. E v e n
when they are victorious, not everybody gains power.
Some less fortunate members turn to crime.We know
of many cases where organized crime and entire
sectors of the state maintain secret partnerships that
b e n e fit each other. In return for at least a modest
level of impunity, organized crime provides a supply
of voters and funds election campaigns.Often a regime
has to collapse before the full measure of white collar
or khaki crime becomes apparent. An example is
N i g e r i a .Under the late dictator Sani A b a c h a ,abuse of
public office became a multi-billion dollar business.
A re white-collar criminals a serious thre a t ?
They come from the highest echelons of the state
and know how to maintain a semblance of legitimacy
while manipulating laws and institutions. O r g a n i z e d
crime rings cannot do that. Old apparatchiks and new
robber barons have plundered on a grand scale many
states created in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s
c o l l a p s e. Secret service agents have used their know-
how to set up crime networks. To d a y, the Russian
m a fia is reportedly active in over 50 countries.

Troubled lands w h e r e
criminals are king
Organized crime can take root in all kinds of states but finds a ripe
breeding ground in crisis-ridden countries, says Alex Schmid from
the United Nations’ Terrorism Prevention Branch
Waiting for the judge after a mafia strike in a Sicilian village.

Organized crime’s grip on society often seems
i r reve r s i b l e. Is your cause a hopeless one?
N o.There is a very wide variety of examples.S o m e
criminal organizations rise and fall, others keep on
going for generations. M a fias—namely secret societies
with a code of silence and hierarchical command
structure—are just one face of organized crime.To d a y
there are much more amorphous networks formed on
a project basis which change countries and members
with ease. Criminal groups also arise in immigrant
c o m m u n i t i e s,where people are struggling for survival.
Depending on the situation, the second generation
children either become law-abiding citizens or take
over the criminal business of their fathers. S o m e t i m e s
new groups eliminate their predecessors. In We s t e r n
E u r o p e, the Albanian mafia has made considerable
inroads on the Turkish mafia ’s control of heroin
distribution from the Balkans.
It is often easier for the police to combat foreign
organized crime groups.When the police is infil t r a t e d ,
and corrupt elements start eliminating “good cops,”t h e
fight becomes more diffic u l t . Then the priority is to
clean up the police either by creating a new police
corps or by resorting to the intelligence service.
Is democracy an effective we apon against
organized crime?
It is wrong to assume that organized crime does
not exist in democratic countries. Open societies offer
excellent opportunities for mafia groups.D e m o c r a c i e s
must therefore wipe out police corruption, set up
effective intelligence services and win broad public
support for their fight against crime. In addition,
measures such as reducing the size of the black market,
controlling immigration in a fair and liberal way and
cutting unemployment can all help. Elected offic i a l s
and senior civil servants must be made accountable,
while corruption and money laundering must be
fought vigorously. If those who hold power in the
state set a good example of integrity and demonstrate
genuine care for the well being of people, it is possible
to fight organized crime effectively. P r e s e n t - d a y
Palermo is an example of how the tide can be turned
even in the heart of what was traditional mafia
t e r r i t o r y.
Has the reduction of government intervention in
the economy created a breeding ground for organized
c r i m e ?
Privatizations and deregulation offer organized
crime great possibilities. The deregulation of
international financial markets since the 1970s have
made money-laundering possible on a global scale.I n
many countries, private security companies have
more personnel than the police force, without having
the authority and legal basis of the latter. Given that
private security firms in some countries have a well
deserved bad reputation, this is an alarming trend.
Open societies with open borders are vulnerable
to transnational criminal activities. Modern criminals
can use information technology to plan theft or fraud
in one place, before syphoning off the profits into
off-shore bank accounts at the other end of the w o r l d .
But the international community is trying to meet
the challenge. In December 2000,124 countries met in
Palermo to sign the new Convention against
Transnational Organized Crime,a powerful instrument
for international law enforcement cooperation. O t h e r
instruments of this kind are needed to combat cy b e r-
c r i m e, for which the European Union is already
working on a regional convention. A convention
against corruption is under consideration.
The police and justice systems must harmonize
their responses to organized transnational crime and
increase their effectiveness. States and societies must
acquire the means to fight it.And the United Nations
must serve as a forum to co-ordinate their efforts. ■
