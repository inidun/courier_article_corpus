THE STRANGE
VICISSITUDES
OF LEONARDO'S
MANUSCRIPTS
J OR almost three centuries, Leon-
«l^ardo da Vinci's mass of scientific
I jottings and sketches languished
} in obscurity. They were buried
in notebooks and scribbling pads
which were chaotically disorganized
and hard to read. That is why, until the
end of the 18th century, Leonardo's
fame as an artist far surpassed his
reputation as a scientist and engineer.
Then too, after Leonardo's death in
1519, his manuscripts were first
neglected and later split up and dis¬
persed. Many of them disappeared
forever.
In his will Leonardo left all his manu¬
scripts to his faithful pupil Francesco
Melzi, who had accompanied him on
his travels and was present at
his death-bed. Melzi transferred his
precious inheritance to his villa at
Vaprio d'Adda near Milan. After
Francesco's death in 1570, his son and
heir, Orazio, failed to see the signifi¬
cance of the Leonardo material and
simply dumped it in the attic.
Thus it was an easy matter for Lelio
Gavardi, the tutor in the Melzi house¬
hold, to get his hands on thirteen
Leonardo manuscripts. Gavardi went
off to Florence with his prize, hoping
to sell it for a high price to Duke
m#H
by Paolo Galluzzi
Francesco de Mediéis. However, in¬
credible though it may seem, one of
the Duke's counsellors advised his
master that "These are not things for
Your Excellency to bother with," and
the sale did not go through.
Gavardi now abandoned his idea of
selling the manuscripts and asked his
friend Ambrogio Mazzenta, who was
about to leave for Milan, to take them
back to Orazio Melzi. However, Orazio
did not want them and (according to
the account in Mazzenta's memoirs)
"was amazed that I had gone to all
this trouble and made me a present
of the manuscripts."
At this point, Pompeo Leoni of
Arezzo comes on to the scene, and
his role in the strange story of
Leonardo's manuscripts is extremely
important. Leoni, court sculptor to
Philip II of Spain, showed great interest
in the Leonardo manuscripts preserved
by Francesco Melzi's heirs and man¬
aged to acquire many of them in
exchange for promises of personal
favours and protection. Leoni also
got hold of ten of the thirteen note¬
books given to Mazzenta by Orazio
Melzi. Thus, in the eight years between
1582 and 1590, almost all Leonardo's ^
papers passed to a new owner. r

PAOLO GALLUZZI is the director of the
Leonardo Museum and Library at Vinci, west
of Florence. He is currently preparing for
Italy's National Research Council a dictionary
of Galileo's philosophical and scientific ter¬
minology. He has written many studies on
the history of Italian scientific thought in the
16th and 17th centuries.

, Leoni wanted to present the docu¬
ments in a more attractive package,
and therefore decided to split up
several of the notebooks and re¬
arrange them into large codices. But
he was totally incompetent for this
kind of work, and the net effect of
his bizarre attempt at "restoration"
was to alter the whole arrangement
of Leonardo's papers and to destroy
vital evidence as to when they were
composed, in what order, the original
number of notebooks, and so on. He
also paved the way for a new Odyssey
of loss and dispersion.
There is no evidence that Leoni
carried out the intention which he
expressed to Orazio Melzi of handing
the Leonardo material over to Philip II
of Spain as a gift. It appears that he
only gave a sample of the documents
to his royal patron and kept the rest
for himself, since many of the manu¬
scripts came into the hands of Polidoro
Caichi, Leoni's son-in-law and heir,
who put them up for sale.
Around 1622 Caichi sold the large
volume compiled by Leoni and now
known as the Codex Atlanticus to
Count Galeazzo Arconati of Milan, and
in 1636 Arconati gave this Codex
(together with other Leonardo manu¬
scripts) to the Ambrosian Library in
Milan.
Other Leonardo documents which
had been in Leoni's possession ended
up in England. Thomas Howard, earl
of Arundel, managed to acquire the
second large volume of Leonardo
papers compiled by Leoni. This is the
collection of drawings now known as
the Windsor Collection, since it is
housed in the Royal Library, Windsor.
Another manuscript (the present Codex
Arundel 263) was also acquired by
Thomas Howard and subsequently
given by one of his heirs to the Royal
Society. The earl of Arundel's acqui¬
sitions date from 1630-1640.
In the 18th century new "movements"
of Leonardo manuscripts took place.

The big treadmill-powered machine
depicted at right in a drawing
from the Codex Atlanticus was devised
by Leonardo for lifting and
transporting excavated materials in
the construction of a canal. In
Leonardo's time, parts of the River Amo
between Florence and the sea were not
navigable because of tortuous bends
and sudden changes in level.
Leonardo had an abiding interest In
changing the river's course Into
a canal in order to create a great
waterway between Florence and the se«

and took back to England the Codex
which now bears his name. Another
manuscript, the so-called Codex Tri-
vulzianus (notable for the long lists
of words recorded in it by Leonardo)
was back in the Ambrosian Library
around the year 1750 Arconati had
donated it to the Library and later
removed it.
At the end of the 18th century even
those notebooks which seemed to have
found a permanent home started to
move around again. During the Italian
campaign in 1796-1797, Napoleon was
ordered by the French government of
that time, the Directory, to confiscate
Italian art treasures and send them to
Paris. The Codex Atlanticus and the
manuscripts housed in the Ambrosian
Library were among the major works
which thus found their way to the
French capital.
The Codex Atlanticus was deposited
in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the
manuscript material was handed over
to the Institut de France. Then at the
end of the Napoleonic Wars the
foreign governments involved managed
to obtain the restitution of many of
the art treasures which had been
removed from their countries. The
Codex Atlanticus was returned to
Milan, but the Institut de France held
on to the other Leonardo manuscripts.
In the 19th century English libraries
enjoyed a new influx of Leonardo
documents. In 1876, for example, John
Forster gave the South Kensington
Museum (now the Victoria and Albert
Museum) the three Leonardo note¬
books which are today known as the
Forster Codices. However, after this
generous gesture another extremely
alarming episode occurred. Count
Guglielmo Libri, a bibliophile and a pio¬
neer of modern scientific historiogra¬
phy, became interested in Leonardo,
and even thought of bringing out an

LEONARDO'S MANUSCRIPTS

edition of Leonardo's unpublished
writings.
However, Count Libri could not re¬
sist the temptation of removing a num¬
ber of leaves from the Leonardo note¬
books which he studied at the Institut
de France. Libri was a sharp business¬
man and he set about selling the
manuscripts he had appropriated.
Some of the stolen manuscript pages
found their way to England, while
the small Codex on The Flight of Birds
was purchased for 4,000 lire by a cer¬
tain Count Manzoni, who later sold it
to an eminent Leonardo scholar, Theo¬
dore Sabachnikoff. Meanwhile, the di¬
rectors of the Institut de France be¬
came suspicious of Libri, the only
person who had been in a position to
consult the Paris manuscripts. Libri
denied the theft energetically, but the
evidence against him was overwhelm¬
ing, and he was sentenced (in his
absence) to ten years' imprisonment.
After this scandal, the Leonardo pages
that had illegally crossed to England
were returned to the Institut de France,
and Sabachnikoff handed over The
Flight of Birds Codex to the Biblioteca
Reale in Turin, where it still is today.
The story of the main changes of
ownership of the Leonardo notebooks
might have ended there. However, at
the beginning of 1967 came official
news of an astonishing find : two Leo¬
nardo notebooks previously consid¬
ered lost had been discovered in the
Madrid National Library.
After an initial reaction of justified
amazement, people began to ask how
these two manuscripts could have tur¬
ned up in Madrid. Scholars have come
up with the following answer. Some of
the Leonardo material owned by Pom¬
peo Leoni was sold in Spain after his
death. One of the purchasers was
probably Juan de Espina, a Madrid
collector. Between 1620 and 1630 first
the future Charles I of England (then
the Prince of Wales) and later the
Florentine Vincenzo Carducci visited
de Espina and saw his collection.
Both visitors were particularly im¬
pressed by two books "written and
drawn by the great Leonardo da Vinci."
When de Espina died in 1642, he
left his precious collection to the King
of Spain. The legacy included the two
Leonardo books, and these were then
deposited in the Palace Library, which
around 1830 became the nucleus of
Spain's recently founded National Li¬
brary. It is highly likely that the two
recently discovered notebooks are the
two manuscripts which once belonged
to de Espina.
In a nineteenth-century printed cata¬
logue of the Madrid National Library,
there is a reference to two Leonardo
"autographs". However, everyone who
followed up this reference and asked
to consult the precious manuscripts
was disappointed. Other manus¬
cripts were found at the shelf-marks
given in the catalogue, and there was
no sign of the Leonardo autographs.
At the end of the 19th century, a
Florentine bibliophile named Tammazo
de Marins tried to find the manus¬
cripts in the Madrid Library, but he
This drawing from the Codex Atlanticus
suggests that Leonardo envisaged
a form of water skiing. However, these
floating shoes and supporting sticks
were never made, and we do not know
what material he intended to use
to make them buoyant.

was unsuccessful and the Library's di¬
rectors decided to consider the two
volumes as definitely lost.
Then, in 1964, an eminent French
Leonardo scholar, André Corbeau, ex¬
pressed his conviction that the two
manuscripts were in fact in the Natio¬
nal Library and that their failure to
come to light might well be due to an
error in the printed catalogue. At this
point the Library's directors decided to
make another attempt to locate the two
notebooks.
This time the search was success¬
ful. At the beginning of 1965, Don Ra¬
mon Paz y Remolar, the director of the
manuscript section of the Library, had
the immense surprise of finding the
Leonardo volumes, not at the shelf-
marks given in the nineteenth-century
catalogue (Aa 19 and 20), but at shelf-
marks Aa 119 and 120.
The news of this important discovery
spread by word of mouth through the
world of scholarship. In 1967 the news
was officially confirmed, and today the
massive contribution to our knowledge
of Leonardo's work provided by these
new manuscripts is at last being made
available to the public in a facsimile
edition to be published this autumn
by McGraw-Hill Book Company of
Codex Madrid /and Codex Madrid II,
as they are now called.
Another event of the last few years
which can be compared without exces¬
sive exaggeration to the discovery of
a new manuscript is the restoration
of the Codex Atlanticus belonging to
the Ambrosian Library in Milan.
The man behind this great project
was Cardinal Montlni, Archbishop of
Milan, now Pope Paul VI. In 1962 he
successfully urged the directors of the
Ambrosian Library to send the precious
Codex to be restored at the Convent
of Grottaferrata near Rome. The idea
was not only to conserve the Codex
Atlanticus, but to salvage as much as
possible from the disastrous scissors-
and-paste job carried out by its compi¬
ler, Leoni, who had arbitrarily gathered
together whatever he thought related
to mechanics in the Leonardo papers
and notebooks belonging to him.
Leoni had taken large sheets of thick
white paper (the size used for atlases,
hence the title Codex Atlanticus), and
used them as a backing on which to
"stick" the original pages by Leo¬
nardo, which were considerably smal¬
ler and often covered from top to bot¬
tom with sketches and writing.. Some
of Leonardo's pages were covered
with drawing and writing on just one
side of the paper. In these cases, or
whenever Leoni considered the hand¬
ful of notes and hurried sketches on
the verso of the paper to be unimpor¬
tant, he stuck the verso directly on to
the backing page.
When, however, Leonardo had cov¬
ered both sides of the paper with nota¬
tions and drawings, Leoni made a kind
of window in the backing page so that
both recto and verso were visible. Fi¬
nally, when dealing with large-sized
Leonardo pages, Leoni adopted yet
another system : he folded the page
in two, introduced a window in the
backing page on which he mounted
one of the two halves, and left the
other half of the Leonardo page hang¬
ing folded just as it was.
Leoni's barbaric treatment of the
manuscripts had unfortunate results.
A large number of verso sides on
which Leonardo had recorded his
thoughts are lost. The margins of the
pages which have been pasted on to
"windows" are also lost, and these
often contained parts of a drawing
or the continuation of writing. Third¬
ly, in the case of the large pages
folded in two, the part left hanging
has often been torn off and conse¬
quently has disappeared.
The restoration carried out during
ten years of devoted work at Grotta¬
ferrata has entirely altered the appear¬
ance of the Codex Atlanticus. In many
ways it is now a completely new docu- .
ment. The restorers used the most
advanced techniques. For example, the
Leonardo originals were scrupulously
washed and toughened with sophis¬
ticated modern fibres and chemicals
in order to make them more resistant
to the ravages of time.
Today, as a result of this great
enterprise, the Codex Atlanticus con¬
sists of 1,068 pages, divided into
twelve leather-bound volumes.
There was no question of letting the
newly-restored Codex be used for con¬
sultation, and so a facsimile edition of
it is being produced by the Florence
publishing house of Barbera. The
first volumes, the end-product of re¬
fined technology and painstaking colla¬
tion with the original, have already
been published, and the Commissione
Nazionale Vinciana is at present pre¬
paring more transcriptions of the Co¬
dex, which will thus soon be available
to Leonardo scholars in its entirety.
Thus modern scholars and restorers
have done much to repair the havoc
wreaked on Leonardo's manuscripts
and we can now appreciate more fully
the activity of one of the most power¬
ful and universal minds the world has
ever known. Paolo Galluzzl
