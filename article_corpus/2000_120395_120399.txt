Ma ny view globalization as a technology-
d ri ven global order that has led to an inten-
s i fic ation of interconnectedness among
nations.This, however, is merely one facet of glo-
b a l i z at i o n , and does not presuppose the ideolo-
gical homogenization or the rapid retrenchment of
the welfare state that is currently underway.
The dispute over globalization is not about the
i n t e n s i fic ation of global interconnectedness. R at h e r ,
it  is over the vision of the global system that globa-
l i z ation projects.This vision entails a global economic
system with identifiable rules of behaviour in trade,
fin a n c e , t a x at i o n , i nvestment policy, i n t e l l e c t u a l
property rights, and currency convertibility, all of
which are crafted along neo-liberal principles with
minimal governmental regulation. As the political
economist Ellen Wood per-
ceptively notes, this vision
of a global system repre-
sents a new phase of capi-
talism which is “more uni-
ve rs a l , more unchallenged,
more pure and more una-
d u l t e r ated than eve r
before.”
For many cri t i c s , g l o-
balization is essentially an
a n t i - d e m o c r atic process that excludes the interests
of a wide range of groups. But the process is not
shaped by market forces alone. It is only made pos-
sible by the acquiescence if not active support of
g ove rn m e n t s , especially those in advanced countri e s.
G ove rnments in developing countri e s ,m e a n w-
hile,are often said to be unable to stand up to glo-
b a l i z ation without incurring severe costs. T h e
g ove rnment of South A f ri c a , for example, c o u l d
be punished by capital flight if it insists on imple-
menting its agenda of social reform .The masses of
South Africa,however,are likely to sustain heavier
costs if the gove rnment abandons its reform i n g
m a n d at e . Faced with such a dilemma, g ove rn m e n t s
h ave generally selected the side of capital for a
simple reason: as the economist Paul Krugman has
noted, the collapse of communism has taken the
heart out of opposition to capitalism.
The list of problems caused by globalization is
l o n g . In low-income countri e s , such as those in
Sub-Saharan A f ri c a , where gove rnments have been
unable or unwilling to provide their populations with
e ven the most basic protection from the new phase
of global capitalism and structural adjustment
programmes,the people’s plight has been particu-
larly severe.
Opponents of globalization are addressing
genuine problems. But it is uncertain whether they
will succeed in reversing globalization or even in
m i t i g ating its adve rse impacts.To begin with, m a ny
of them are badly organized. Most of them have also
rallied around specific issues instead of art i c u l at i n g
a comprehensive counter vision.At this point, the
counter vision they project appears to be a global
system which is not shaped by the narr ow interests
of capital but which accommodates the interests of
diverse social groups. This
v i s i o n , h owe ve r , is not ye t
well developed.
Furthermore,these op-
ponents have yet to deve l o p
viable strat e gies to constrain
g l o b a l i z at i o n . Some argue
for weakening or even abo-
lishing institutions such as
the World Bank, the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund,
and the World Trade Organizat i o n , which they view
as agents of globalizat i o n . But to the extent that these
organizations are effective agents of globalization,
it is unclear why business interests and gove rn-
ments would allow this to happen.The relevance of
these bodies is only likely to decline if Third World
c o u n t ri e s , especially middle-income ones, b e gin to
reduce their dependence on them under pressure
from their populations.
Yet the main problem faced by these critics is
that many of them do not see the relevance of the
s t at e . A successful struggle for genuine popular
democracy can liberate the state from the grip of
c o rp o r ate and financial interests, t u rning it into a cri-
tical agent for the promotion of broad social inter-
e s t s. M a ny NGOs rely instead on civil society,
though this cannot substitute the state in policy-
m a k i n g .The struggle against globalization is essen-
tially a struggle for democracy:the state cannot be
bypassed, but must be won. ■
