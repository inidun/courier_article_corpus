N February of this year the
United Nations Economic and Social
Council published the findings of its
second world inquiry on population and
development carried out with the
governments of 80 countries. The
inquiry "was made with the co¬
operation of the United Nations
Economic Commissions for Europe,
Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and
sought to determine trends as regards
government attitudes and policies
towards population.
The inquiry revealed that in a con¬
siderable number of countries the
population problem seems to be mainly
confined to matters concerning the rate
of natural increase. Many countries
directly linked population policies with
economic, social and political actions.
The Government of Egypt, while
emphasizing the primary role of social
and economic development, also gives
due consideration to demographic
policy and action.
In its response, Panama declared:
"In Panama it is believed that the
problem is not situated in the control
of population growth but rather in the
elimination of poverty. This problem
requires the execution of a broad eco¬
nomic and social policy which provides
for just and favourable working condi¬
tions and assures equal opportunities
for all."
A statement made by the Chinese
observer at a meeting in Geneva of
the United Nations Population Commis¬
sion in November 1973, implies a simi¬
lar position.
"We have learned from our own
experience", Mr. Yu said, "that it is
erroneous and untruthful to say that
over-population is the main cause of
the poverty and backwardness of the
developing countries of Asia, Africa
and Latin America and that a popula¬
tion policy is decisive in solving the
problems of poverty and backward¬
ness... China pursues a policy of dev¬
eloping her national economy in a
planned way, including the policy of
planned population growth. We do
not approve of anarchy either in phy¬
sical production or in human repro¬
duction."
The view of the Soviet Union is
expressed as follows:
"Historical experience shows that
population growth cannot be an obsta¬
cle to economic and cultural develop¬
ment. Since social life is based on the
conditions and level of material pro¬
duction, the solution of the problem
of harmonizing economic and social
.development and population growth

consists not in adjusting population
growth to the growth of the economy,
as is the case in family planning, but
in ensuring rates of economic growth
which will exceed population growth
rates and guarantee a rise in the
standard of living of the people.
However, some countries clearly
state that they have encountered great
difficulties in raising the standard of
living of their population, while simul¬
taneously sustaining a high rate of
population growth.
The Tunisian Government reports
that it "is profoundly aware of the near-
impossibility of raising the standard of
living per inhabitant, of solving the
employment problem, or even of con¬
tinually ensuring the present rate of
school attendance if the current rate
of population growth continues."
It has adopted a number of legisla
tive measures (postponement of age
at marriage, limitation of family allow¬
ance to four children, liberalization of
abortions for social reasons...)
The Government of Thailand also
considers the high rate of population
growth as an impediment to economic
and social development: its policy sup¬
ports voluntary family planning.
The U.N. Report summarizes its find¬
ings in the major regions of the world
as follows:
Africa
Clear indications on the goals of
national population policies are given
in the responses of three out of 15
African countries. These are Egypt,
which is seeking to reduce its birth
rate to 30 per thousand by 1978,
Kenya, also striving to lower the birth
rate, and Tunisia where the long-term
target is to attain the present level of
fertility in Italy (17 per thousand) by
the end of the century.
In Madagascar and Swaziland there
are good prospects that family planning
will be given higher priority in the
development plans of these countries.
Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi and Zambia
have not yet formulated any population
policy, although Ethiopia has under¬
taken a number of population studies.
Liberia expects to develop a policy
after the population and housing cen¬
sus of 1974.
North America
While the United States of America
does not have an officially formulated
population policy it takes a positive
position in making available family
planning services to all people desiring

them. "This position implies a policy
oriented de facto towards a further
decrease in the rate of population
growth."
Canada has not yet considered the
official formulation of an explicit popu¬
lation policy.
Latin America
The picture which can be deduced
from the somewhat limited number of
responses from Latin American coun¬
tries may not fully represent the actual
situation in the whole region.
Five countries, namely, Barbados,
Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
Panama and Trinidad and Tobago have
pursued for some time a policy of
reducing the rate of population growth.
It seems that Mexico may be about to
join this group.
Chile, Peru and Uruguay have adopt¬
ed a neutral position, assuming that
general economic and social develop¬
ment as such will eventually dispose
of the population problem. In Chile
and Uruguay the rate of growth has
been falling for some time and is now
comparatively low. In Peru the govern¬
ment does not interfere with existing
private family planning.
Asia
The majority of Asian countries have
recognized the necessity of implement¬
ing an active population policy. This
analysis is hased on responses from
23 Asian countries, not including China.
Among the countries which have
replied to the U.N. Inquiry the majority
entertain a clear policy aimed towards
an abatement of population growth.
India is continuing its present policy
with this aim in view. Iran expects
to bring down its annual population
growth to about 1 per cent within 20
years. Japan is striving to attain a
stationary population. The objective
of the Laotian Government is to reduce
the present 2.4 per cent rate to 1.2 per
cent by the year 2000.
In Pakistan a national slogan, "fewer
and healthier children", is being widely
publicized. In Nepal the present popu
lation policy is to reduce the rate of
growth. In the Philippines it is estimat¬
ed that a variety of measures will bring
the birth rate down from 43.2 per
thousand in 1970 to 34.8 per thousand
in 1980. In Singapore the- ultimate
objective is a zero population growth.
In Sri Lanka (Ceylon), although no pre¬
cise target is given, it is expected that
family planning will have to be more
vigorously pursued.
Thailand aims to reduce the popula¬
tion growth rate from over 3 per cent
to about 2.5 per cent by 1976. The
Turkish Government is taking meas¬
ures to keep the population under 65
million by the year 1995. The Republic
of Viet-Nam aims to reduce its present
3.0 per cent population growth rate.
The positions of the Governments of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and the Syrian
Arab Republic are not explicitly stated,
but their replies suggest that in the
future they will wish to seek a slower
rate of population growth.
The policy of the Government of
Iraq is to sustain up until 1980 the
present rate of fertility and to lower
the rate of mortality, and that of the
Government of the Khmer Republic
appears to be aimed towards an
accelerated growth.
Europe and
the Soviet Union
Twenty-one countries (including the
U.S.S.R.) responded to the U.N.
Inquiry. Most of the European coun¬
tries have moderate or low rates of
population growth. Accordingly their
population policies are concerned to a
much smaller degree with growth prob¬
lems than are those in other continents.
At the forefront of European interest
are issues of urban congestion, hous¬
ing, aging, general welfare, ecology
etc., and in some cases also the prob¬
lem of depopulation.
No country in this region has indi¬
cated an explicit policy of reducing the
rate of population growth.
The Federal Republic of Germany
and the Netherlands show some con
cern with the pressures that could
result from further increases in the
total number of inhabitants in their
respective countries.
In the following countries the govern¬
ments do not interfere directly with
demographic processes: Austria, Den¬
mark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the
Ukrainian S.S.R., the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia.
Five European countries indicate that
their policies are in favour of an
increase in their population. These are
Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hun¬
gary and Romania. The position of
Poland is not clearly determined, al¬
though there is concern about the
possible impact of low rates of popula¬
tion growth on future development.
Oceania
Australia and New Zealand have no
specific demographic targets, but both
countries are interested in maintaining
a controlled rate of population growth
through their policies of immigration.
The policy of Fiji is for a reduction of
population growth.
In conclusion:
It seems warranted to state that
governments on the Asian continent,
which comprises half of mankind, have
recognized that continued population
growth can be a burden on the eco¬
nomy, and they are increasing their
efforts to achieve a rate of growth
which will render the task of economic
and social development more mana¬
geable.
Although some changes in popula¬
tion policies in Africa and Latin Ame¬
rica are taking place, differences of
national approach among countries in
these regions are quite apparent. Most
of Europe, North America and Oceania
have already achieved low rates of
population growth. The moderate
acceleration of growth rates which are
the targets of some European countries
will probably be counteracted by
further declines in other countries, so
that an even lower rate of population
growth is apt to result in these regions
combined.
