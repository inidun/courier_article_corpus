These forms sculpted by the hand of nature, from a collection made by the
speleologist, Norbert Casteret, are now on view at the Fontaine-de-Vaucluse
Museum in southern France. Below left, stalactite with an "eccentric"
ending. Below, "ballet" of calcite deposits. Right, a "cauliflower" stalactite
formed by water impregnated with aragonite, a carbonate of lime.

SCULPTURE
WITH WATER
In the darkness of the world's
caves and grottos, centuries
and eons of time have
chiselled out graceful pil¬
lars and draperies in stone.
These mineral deposits are
caused by water seeping
through porous limestone
rocks. Dripping from the
ceiling of a cave, the water
leaves particles of lime. In
time a " stalactite" is formed,
hanging from the roof. The
drops deposit more lime as
they splash on the floor of the
cave and so form "stalag¬
mites" which point upwards
like icicles in reverse. Some¬
times stalactites and stalag¬
mites join together to form
pillars. When infiltrating water
runs down the cave walls
it forms stone curtains or
drapes, as in the cave of La
Clamouse, at St.-Guilhem-le-
Désert in the south of France
(left). As the other photos
show, these stone formations
can take on far more eccentric
shapes. This happens when
the drops of water are diverted
to one side or when air
currents in the cave produce
more evaporation on one
side of the mineral formation.
