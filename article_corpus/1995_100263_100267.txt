The state ofresearch
Although patients and the public are not yet aware of it,
important advances in the understanding of Aids patho¬
genesis have been made in the last four years which could
lead to better therapeutic approaches in the near future.
It appears that indirect effects of HIV infection, via cir¬
culating HIV proteins or non-infectious virions, could
amplify the direct infection of target cells. Moreover, the
strong oxidative stress which follows HIV infection could
also increase damage to the immune system.
We now have powerful weapons with which to coun¬
teract the effects of HIV infection, as well as the appro¬
priate laboratory tools with which to make a rapid eval¬
uation of the effectiveness of the combat. But we do not yet
know how to combine these weapons optimally.
I therefore propose that a network of clinical research
units be created in which researchers and clinicians will
work closely together: for small cohorts of HIV-positive
asymptomatic individuals, "à la carte" treatment will be
defined, based on the return to normal of all surrogate
markers.
Such treatments will have to be complex to counteract
the multiple facets of the disease. One could, for instance,
envisage combinations of several antivirals (reverse tran¬
scriptase inhibitors and antiproteases), of antibiotics, of
antioxidants and cytokines involved in the restoration of
cellular immunity against the virus and the opportunist
agents (IL-2, IL-12).
The first step will be to stabilize to a low level the HIV
infection in such patients. A further step may be a complete
eradication of HIV infection.
