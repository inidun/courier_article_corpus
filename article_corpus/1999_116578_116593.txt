“Petra has changed more in the last 15 ye a rs
than it did in the previous 14 centuries,”
s ays Ahmed Salamin, who knows what
he is talking about. He was born in Wadi Moussa,
the nearest town to the outstanding Jordanian site,
and served as its mayor before becoming assistant
director-general of the Petra Regional Planning
Council (PRPC). Fourteen centuries ago, he says,
a series of earthquakes seriously damaged the
ancient city, once the capital of the kingdom of the
N a b at a e a n s , an Arab people who controled the
c a r avan trade routes between Arabia and the Medi-
terranean before they were conquered by Rome in
106 A.D.
To d ay, Petra and those who seek to preserve the
site have nothing to fear from the forces of nature
or the Roman Empire.The present danger comes
from the legions of tourists overrunning the site,
whose 800 monuments carved into pink stone we r e
included on UN E S C O’s World Heritage List in 1985.
The number of visitors rose from 100,000 in the lat e
1980s to 400,000 six ye a rs lat e r , then declined
s l i g h t l y. Recent regional tensions stemming from the
crisis with Iraq and the deadlock in the peace pro-
cess have deterred visitors, especially Israelis and
A m e ri c a n s , from visiting some Middle Eastern
countries.
A comprehensive plan
Concerned about the influx of tourists and the
chaotic growth of Wadi Moussa, Queen Noor of
Jordan sounded the alarm in the early 1990s. She
appealed to UN E S C O,which sent a mission of expert s
to Petra in 1992.The outcome was the Management
Plan for the Petra National Pa r k , which includes an
a rr ay of measures cove ring the conservation and res-
t o r ation of monuments, site deve l o p m e n t , t h e
i m p r ovement of infrastru c t u r e s ,c h a rting a future for
the area’s 25,000 inhabitants, and protection of
the environment.
In accordance with the plan’s recommenda-
t i o n s , the Jordanian authorities set up the PRPC in
1995 to bring together all the official bodies
c o n c e rn e d . Chaired by the minister of touri s m ,t h e
council includes representat i ves of the depart m e n t
of antiquities, the ministries of planning, finance,
l a b o u r , h e a l t h , local gove rn m e n t , and irri g at i o n ,
the environmental protection department and local
communities. Financed by a 25 per cent cut of the

Pe t ra’s new invaders
w Christophe A y a d
Pe t ra was declared a world heritage site in 1985, Since then it’s been an uphill battle 
to protect Jo rd a n ’s glorious ancient city hewn from pink ro c k

site’s receipts,the council is empowered to review
and approve all decisions concerning Pe t r a . B u t
s e veral questions remain unanswe r e d . Does it have
enough political clout to control all the changes in
its 900-square-kilometre area of competence? How
can conser vation needs and tourism interests be
balanced in a country where tourism accounts for
earnings of nearly one billion dollars a year and
17,500 jobs?
So far,tourism does not seem to have inflicted
irreparable damage on Petra, and the prospect of
increased revenues has led to some indispensable
i m p r ove m e n t s. Under a $27-million pri o rity action
plan set up with the help of the World Bank in
1996, construction work has begun on a drainage
s y s t e m .P r e v i o u s l y, u n t r e ated waste and waste wat e r
were often discharged into the env i r o n m e n t . I n
a d d i t i o n , t e rraces dating back to the Nabat a e a n
p e riod have been gradually restored and wadi beds
c l e a n e d . Once the hydraulic work is completed,
the authorities will renovate the road netwo r k ,e s p e-
cially in the centre of Wadi Moussa, which is
congested with buses and taxis. O l i ve and pine
trees are being planted to stop desert i fic at i o n .R e f o-
r e s t ation “will help absorb water in the event of
t o rrential rainfall and beautify the site,” s ays Zeidoun
al-Muheisen, director-general of the PRPC.“And
i t ’s the best way to prevent unauthorized bu i l d i n g .”
T h at threat , among others , is associated with the
activities of the Bduls, Bedouin who lived in the
ruins of Petra until 1985.They farmed in the area
and had their goats graze there before being expelled
and rehoused in the village of Oum Seyhoun on the
edge of the archaeological park. N ow most of them
make a living from touri s m , renting horses or selling
t ri n k e t s. But the tri b e ’s population has continued to
gr ow and the Bduls, who believe they have been mis-
treated, are cramped in their new village. “There
were 40 Bdul families in 1985. To d ay there are
350,” says Salamin.“The tourist boom has drawn
newcomers from the Aqaba region.If they want to
move here all they have to do is buy land.”
If they can afford it. Land prices have skyroc-
k e t e d .T h at is why, s ay the Bduls, they are forced to
add storeys to their houses, which are now visible
from the site, where their flocks still gr a z e .They can
also expand Oum Seyhoun, but only on its nort h e rn
s i d e .The east is set aside for reforestat i o n , the south
is occupied by the archaeological site and the west
is part of the natural park that is currently being
created.This strictly regulated area will probably
c over 264 square kilometres, f o rming a huge bu f f e r
zone around Pe t r a .The U. S .N ational Parks Serv i c e
will train a team to manage the area. But the pro-
ject is still on the drawing board.
The hotels that have sprung up like mushrooms
in Wadi Moussa have also caused degr a d ation to the
s i t e .Ten ye a rs ago there were fewer than five ;t o d ay
there are around sixty. “The PRPC did not exist
when most of the building permits were issued,” s ay s
Salamin. “From now on we are making sure that
nothing which can have a negat i ve impact on Pe t r a
will be bu i l t .” He is probably thinking of the
unsightly Mövenpick restaurant, l o c ated a few
metres from the entrance to the archaeologi c a l
p a r k , and the six hotels overlooking the site from the
village of Taybé.The private sector is not the only
culprit.Two large public buildings stand at the left
of the entrance to Petra. One is the Wadi Moussa
sports hall.The other is the future headquarters of
the PRPC.
The admission fee at Petra is 20 dinars ($30), a n
exorbitant price that does not seem justified and
makes the Nabataean city one of the world’s most
e x p e n s i ve sites. Of cours e , some difficulties are
hard to avoid: to reach the heart of Petra, visitors
must take the Siq, a narr ow, 800-metre-long gorge
c a rved into the rock that leads to the impressive A l
K h a z n a h , a monument with a columned fa ç a d e
cut into the solid rock. Congestion seems inevi-
t a b l e .To limit it, h o rses are not allowed through the
gorge unless they are drawing carriages.
Other improvements have made life easier for
v i s i t o rs. Toilets have been bu i l t , the site is kept
meticulously clean, and souvenir ve n d o rs have been
grouped together and will eventually be move d
outside the park. On the other hand, the tourist
information centre is too small and is used almost
e x c l u s i vely to display the handicrafts made by local
women under the aegis of the Noor al-Hussein
Foundation.Signposting is minimal:there are few
maps and no explanations.
Under pressure from tourism and in the
absence of a local tradition of site restorat i o n ,
c o n s e rvation may be the most pressing issue. I n
Bdul, bedouins who once lived in Petra,now await tourists at the entrance to the site.
‘ F rom now on we are making 
s u re that nothing 
which can have a negative 
impact on Pe t ra 
will be built’

1993 the German intern ational co-operat i o n
a g e n cy, the GTZ, launched an ambitious pro-
gramme in co-operation with Jo r d a n ’s depart m e n t
of antiquities. The first on-site training centre is
scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.A f t e r
years of work,the centre developed a natural mor-
tar which is particularly suitable for the stone at
Pe t r a . This discove ry seems especially import a n t
since the cement and reinforced concrete used in
earlier restoration work have caused damage to the
Khaznah and other monuments.These “modern”
m at e rials trap water in the monumental stonewo r k ,
which is gradually eaten away from within and
cracks in some places.
R e s t o r ation is a long job, but tour operat o rs are
in a hurry and the scales are tipping in their favo u r.
C o n s e rvationists are having trouble making their
voices heard.The department of antiquities report s
to the ministry of tourism, which does not like to
see scaffolding up for a long time. In an effort to
stop water seepage into some of the monuments,
the authorities have applied sprays that prevent the
stone from breathing and may cause the same pro-
blems as cement.
Controversial 
initiatives
That’s not all, say archaeologists,who are par-
ticularly critical of the activities of the Petra
National Trust,a private foundation whose mem-
bers are prominent figures who want to contribu-
te to the enhancement of Jordan’s foremost cul-
tural treasure. Chaired by Prince Raad ben Zeid,
a cousin of the late King Hussein, the Trust has
commissioned a Swiss company to build a series
of dams in the small valleys that give on to the
Siq. The purpose is to avoid a recurrence of the
tragedy that occurred in 1963, when 21 French
tourists drowned as a result of flash floods. The
$1.5-million project, which is financed by the
Swiss government, damages the site’s integrity,
say archaeologists, who would like to restore the
Nabataean hydraulic system. Experts are also
upset about the way the same company excavated
the ancient pavement “with a bulldozer and
without archaeological supervision.”To cap it all,
the Swiss firm coated the Siq’s unpaved surfaces
with a white, powdery substance that has spread
to the walls of the gorge, masking the rock’s
magnificent colours.
“We’re not here just to restore four monu-
ments, carry out a high-profile operation and
leave,” says Helge Fischer, head of the GTZ pro-
ject.“Our objective is to set up a Jordanian struc-
ture capable of looking after the restoration of
monuments.” This body, the Conservation and
Restoration Centre in Petra (CARCIP), will be
independent of the department of antiquities and
staffed by highly-qualified professionals. So far,
GTZ has spent $3.5 million on equipment and
training six specialized workers, two architects
and two stone-cutters. In the long term, the team
should comprise ten or more people. But CAR-
CIP has not yet got off the ground. n
