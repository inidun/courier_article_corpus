O n a humid tropical evening in mid-Apri l ,
H e n ry Muhamad Ali stood under a tall
billboard in southern Ja k a rt a .“ L o o k ! ” h e
said bitterly, pointing up to the sign above his head.
“It says eve rybody should apply for a building perm i t
when constructing their houses.”
Ali had good reason to be bitter.The billboard
had been set up at an intersection near the campus
of the Unive rsity of Indonesia, on a grassy spot where,
exactly a decade ago, he had been living in a house
legally built on a 2,000-square-metre plot of land.
Then came the day when he and his family we r e
forcibly evicted.
“Hundreds of police and army officers , s o m e
a rmed with machine guns,forced my wife and children
to leave our home,”he cri e d , adding that tractors had
been used to flatten his house.
All over the Ja k a rta agglomerat i o n ,m a ny middle-
and lower-class Ja k a rtans could tell similar stori e s.
They were the legal ow n e rs of houses w h o s e
c o n s t ruction had been authori z e d .Then they we r e
d ri ven out to make room for the skyscrapers ,r e a l
estate complexes and highrise condominiums that
have transformed central Jakarta.
Land speculation in Ja k a rta—and in Indonesia
in general—has been more intensive than elsewhere
in A s i a .There are several reasons for this. One is
t h at Indonesia has no progr e s s i ve tax system to
discourage people from accumulating land holdings.
(A progr e s s i ve tax system is one in which we a l t hy
people pay relat i vely more tax than the less we a l t hy. )
S e c o n d l y, Indonesian people traditionally like to
i nvest their money in land, which is considered a
yardstick of their social status as well as a source of
we a l t h . G ove rnment officials as well as pri vat e
d e ve l o p e rs jostle to accumulate land: the higher an
o f fic i a l ’s rank, the more land he is likely to possess.
T h i r d l y, Indonesian banks traditionally regard land
as good collateral for loans, and in the 1980s and
1990s competed with each other to provide credit
for land speculat i o n . They did not realize that
Indonesia’s economic structure was fragile.
B e t ween October 1993, when the gove rn m e n t
issued a package of deregulation measures which
included the liberalization of land ow n e rs h i p, a n d
June 1998, I n d o n e s i a ’s National Land A g e n cy issued
“ a p p r o p ri ation perm i t s ” to scores of deve l o p e rs
over a total area of almost 250,000 hectares.
An appropri ation permit allows deve l o p m e n t
companies to approach residents in a target area to
n e g o t i ate and sell their land. In practice, d e ve l o p e rs
often used strong-arm methods to force small land-
owners to sell up.
According to an estimate by the Ministry of
Public Housing, by 1999 enough land had been
“ r e l e a s e d ” by its ow n e rs to satisfy Indonesia’s
demand for new houses for a hundred ye a rs. In other
wo r d s , the speculat i ve bubble bu rs t , and one reason

The South’s urban re v o l u t i o n
w hy the Indonesian banking sector is enmeshed in
economic crisis today is because of its non-
performing property loans.
In this “land ru s h ” the gove rnment ignored tow n
planning blueprints it had helped to prepare. H e n c e
the story of people like Ali.
At the height of the forced eva c u at i o n s , in the
l ate 1970s and in the 1980s, Indonesian newspapers
were full of stories about deve l o p e rs using arm e d
thugs to harass small land-ow n e rs and soldiers
strong-arming citizens opposed to what was going
o n . Human rights law ye rs tried desperately to
n e g o t i ate but in some cases they too were prosecuted
and even jailed.
Not all threatened home-ow n e rs took things lying
d ow n . Some organized resistance, and in one case
s o l d i e rs on an eviction mission were attacked with
s h a rpened bamboo spears. “ M a ny of these people
were actually killed,” s ays Pa n a n gian Simanungkalit
of the Center for Indonesia Property Studies, w h o
e s t i m ates that 4.5 million people were eva c u ated from
their homes in Ja k a rta during the authori t a rian ru l e
of President Suharto between 1968 and 1998.
When officials
override planning blueprints
For 55-year-old Ali this was not the first time he
had been evicted from his home. In 1959, w h e n
Indonesia was preparing to host the Asian Games,
his house was one of hundreds in the Senaya n
d i s t rict of central Ja k a rta that were bulldozed to
make room for the Senayan Sports Complex, t h e
largest in southeast Asia.
On that occasion he received a small amount of
c o m p e n s at i o n , and used it to buy a plot of land
about two kilometres away. T h e n , in 1979, h e
decided to sell up for a profit and buy the 2,000-
square-metre plot of land in Srengseng Sawah where
he would later experience eviction for a second time.
Before he made the purchase, h owe ve r , he took
certain precautions. He went along to the office of
the Gove rnor of Ja k a rta and to the mayoralty of
s o u t h e rn Ja k a rta (see box) and consulted the Master
Plan the authorities had drawn up to deal with
problems of Ja k a rt a ’s rapid urban gr ow t h . He wa s
reassured when officials told him that the Srengseng
S awah area was intended to be a housing zone. L at e r
he was issued with a building perm i t .T h e n , in 1989,
officials simply said that they had changed the
Master Plan. When Ali protested the Ja k a rt a
authorities ordered the soldiers to go in.
W h at happens to Ali and the millions like him
who have been expelled? Where do they go and how
do they set about rebuilding their lives?
A lot depends on their means.The authori t i e s
p r ovide compensation for evicted people, but this
is usually ve ry low. On average it amounts to one-
t wentieth of the market price of their propert y
according to Panangian.
The gove rnment tried to introduce low - c o s t
housing in certain areas, but its efforts were a drop
in the ocean and were soon dwarfed beneath the
forest of high-rise condos and skyscrapers.
Officials usually encourage displaced small
l a n d ow n e rs to move to the suburbs or to join a
g ove rnment-sponsored transmigr ation progr a m m e
designed to relocate people from ove rp o p u l at e d
islands such as Java , Madura and Bali to more
s p a rsely settled islands such as Irian Jaya ,
Kalimantan or Sumatra.
Those who can afford to do so move out to the
s u bu r b s. M a ny have settled in Bekasi, to the east,
and Tangerang to the we s t , which have become the

main concentrations for the gr owth of
m a n u fa c t u ring employment and population on the
outer edge of the Ja k a rta agglomerat i o n . For the
poor it wa s , and is, a ve ry different story (see below ) .
Compared to many,Ali was lucky.When he wa s
e v i c t e d , he filed a lawsuit against the authori t i e s. A t
f i rst he got free legal aid, but did not work while
waiting for his case to come up and spent a lot of
time attending court sessions. After a protracted
legal battle his case was dismissed on appeal in 1996,
but he was awarded compensation of around 50
million rupiah ($19,230 at the then exchange rat e ) .
This was just enough to buy the 150 square-metre
plot of land where he and his family live today, a
kilometre away from the site from which they we r e
expelled in 1989.
When he lost his house, Ali also lost his
workplace—he used to be a we l d e r. Like other
displaced households, the family has become much
p o o r e r. If Ali had been allowed to keep the house
he owned in Senayan in the 1960s and 1970s he
would now be a ve ry rich man indeed since land
p rices in this desirable area of Ja k a rta have
skyrocketed.
Ali is now out of wo r k .His wife,Umroh A i n i ,t ri e s
to support the family and has opened a small kiosk at
a bus stop, selling soft drinks and peanuts. T h e i r
c h i l d r e n , aged between nine and 30, share the small
house with their parents.The three oldest sons dropped
out of school and found work as bus dri ve rs.
Displaced people like Ali lose their confidence as
well as their homes.They feel they have failed in life.
They also leave behind them the tightly knit social
s u p p o rt network of neighbours and relat i ves which
is a strong feature of Indonesian life. People who live
in Ja k a rt a ’s new suburban areas usually come from
a pat c h work of ethnic and religious backgr o u n d s.
M a ny people do not know their neighbours.
Those who live in the suburb areas face many
p r o b l e m s , r a n ging from longer commuting hours
to bad sanitat i o n , i n a d e q u ate telephone lines and
low water quality.
Clean water 
for 5% of the population
Water supply is an ever-present problem in cities
of the South and Ja k a rta is no exception. PAM Jaya ,
the water supply operat o r , is perhaps Ja k a rt a ’s wo rs t -
run state-owned company. In spite of 170 per cent
gr owth between 1987 and 1997, it can only supply
clean water to around 5 per cent of the populat i o n .
Displaced families have to rely on their we l l .T h e
water from A l i ’s well is still dri n k a b l e , but many
other fa m i l i e s , especially in central and nort h e rn
Jakarta,have to buy their drinking water every day
from itinerant vendors.
PT Te l k o m , I n d o n e s i a ’s telecoms utility, h a s
t u rned in a better perform a n c e .B e t ween 1992 and
1997 it increased the number of telephone lines in
Ja k a rta from 560,000 to 1.7 million, a 200 per cent
i n c r e a s e . But supply is still far below the demand
of Jakarta’s nearly 10 million people.
The trouble is,Ali couldn’t possibly afford to be
hooked up.When asked his telephone number, h e
smiled and shook his head, “These shoes I am
we a ring are the only ones that I saved from the
wreckage in 1989,” he said. “If I can’t afford to bu y
new shoes, h ow can you expect me to have a
telephone?”
L ater on that A p ril eve n i n g, when Ali was about
to leave to meet his wife, he described how he had
joined thousands of students occupying Indonesia’s
parliament building in May 1998. He shared their
objective: to kick out Suharto.
“ S u h a rt o ’s daughter built this inters e c t i o n ,”A l i
said as he left the site where his home and his dream
were taken away from him a decade ago. One thing
he didn’t lose on that fateful day was his pri d e . n
