The authors of this article, members of the
Club of Rome, collaborated in a new global
computer study on the interrelationship of
population, food resources, energy and eco¬
nomic growth, to be published next October.
Here they present its conclusions with regard
to food and population.
MIHAJLO D. MESAROVIC, of the U.S.A.. Is
professor of engineering and mathematics
and director of the Systems Research Center
at Case Western Reserve University, Cleve¬
land.
EDUARD PESTEL, of the Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many, is professor of engineering and director
of the Institute of Mechanics at the Technical
University of Hanover.
MAURICE GUERNIER, French economist
specializing in problems of tropical agronomy,
has led several African development planning
missions, in Cameroon, Dahomey, Chad,
Rwanda and Burundi.
II N recent years, a consider¬
able number of studies have appeared
on global problems. These studies
have analysed the demographic char¬
acteristics of the world and their pro¬
jected pattern to the year 2000,
agriculture, food supplies, energy
resources-, etc. Each of them is
extremely important in its field.
However, these problems are closely
connected. The future of agriculture
for example can be discussed only in
terms of future needs and therefore
of demographic growth. Demographic
growth is in turn directly related to
food and other factors.
To forecast world population 30 or
50 years ahead is therefore feasible
only if account is taken of all the
factors in the equation, particularly
agriculture, food, fertilizers and energy,
both in a given region and in others
where the picture may be different.
This phenomenon the interaction,
the inseparable fusion of all these
problems might be termed the "world
problem complex". In other words, all
these analytical studies are valid only
if they are linked together in a global
network the world problem complex.
And yet it is equally essential to recog¬
nize the world's diversity. One can¬
not speak of the world's food problem,
but only of North America's food prob¬
lem, Western Europe's food problem,
the Soviet Union's, South Asia's, etc.,
and each is profoundly different.
There may be famine in one region,
abundance in another. We must
therefore agree that the world is at
the same time one world and many.
To understand it properly, it must be
studied in its unity and in its diversity.
The future obviously is uncertain.

But we can anticipate its characteris¬
tic features if at first we learn to
understand the unity and the diversity.
We should then be able to forecast
probable trends, so that finally be¬
cause we understand the causes we
may be in a position to choose bet¬
ween a number of possibilities.
The new world study, which we have
completed at the request of the Club
of Rome, had exactly this purpose of
understanding our planet better, of
discerning future trends more surely,
so that it might be possible to influence
the future, by heading off catastro¬
phes, by averting large-scale injus¬
tice, and by promoting a better quality
of life...
The study required two years of
work with a large team of specialists,
and culminated in the construction of
what we call the Mesarovic-Pestel
Model (1). All the data are recorded
in three computers situated at Cleve¬
land (Ohio), Hanover (Fed. Rep. of
Germany) and Grenoble (France),
which can be questioned by telephone
or satellite from any part of the world.
True to the concept of the world's
diversity, all the data registered relate
to ten large regions North America,
Western Europe, Japan, Australia-
South Africa, U.S.S.R. and Eastern
Europe, Latin America, the Maghreb
(North Africa) and Near East, tropical
Africa, South Asia, China. There are
therefore ten autonomous economic
models, which allow one region or a
group of regions to be studied, but
there is also in effect a single world
model, since the ten sections are inter-

linked. This model is thus a reflection
of the world's unity and diversity.
A second major characteristic is
that the Model is a "multi-level"
one, comprising data on natural resour¬
ces (oil deposits, mineral reserves),
technological data (industry), econ¬
omic data and so on. All these data
are interlinked, since they react one
with the other.
A third characteristic is that the
Model constitutes, not a means of
predicting the future manifestly an
absurdity but a tool for understand¬
ing what is likely to happen if on the
first hypothesis events are allowed
to unfold without hindrance, or if on
the alternative hypothesis various
different kinds of action are taken.
The different possible policies fed into
the computer are called "scenarios".
Each scenario elicits a reply derived
from all the basic data of the Model.
A final important characteristic of
the Model is that obviously it does
not record all the countless world
data, but only the principal basic rela¬
tionships. To put it in simplified terms,
what the Model brings into play
essentially are the demographic char¬
acteristics, the food requirements,
energy, economic growth-r-in short,
the major construction materials of
the future, the materials with which,
if he holds them in his hands, man
can build a better world.
Here are some of the principal con¬
clusions of the Mesarovic-Pestel
Model, in particular with regard to
population and food.
The most crucial questions in this
respect are: Is the precarious state
of the world food supply situation a
temporary aberration, resulting from
inadequate attention given to the prob¬
lem and which therefore can be
remedied quite readily? Or is it a
persistent or even worsening problem
whose solution would require major
efforts ? If the latter is true, the next
and most urgent question is: What
are the characteristics of the different
strategies which can be used to avert
a catastrophe?
Analysis of the first question pro¬
duced the conclusion that the historical
pattern of development will make the
situation increasingly worse until it
reaches truly catastrophic proportions.
In considering the second question
we analysed a number of scenarios
and were able to identify some basic
components which any strategy aimed
at the solution of the world food situa¬
tion must have.
Our world model has certain features
of special relevance to the food-popu¬
lation problem. The model contains
a detailed representation of diet and
food types, region by region, and is
based on 26 different varieties of food.
The model also incorporates the effect
that is produced by lack of essential
diet elements, such as protein, on the
population.
The regionalization of the model is
most important here since, although^

MOUNTING PRESSURE
ON THE LAND
The four graphs on these pages were
produced by a computer on the basis
of data provided by a new world
computer model elaborated by
M.D. Mesarovic and E. Pestel.
According to these studies, certain
catastrophic events await the world
before the year 2025.
The graph, right, shows how the density
of the population, expressed in numbers
of persons per square kilometre of
cultivated land, is exercising pressure
on the food production potential of
5 major regions of the world. The study
states that the worst hit will be
South Asia, where every square
kilometre of cultivated land now
supports 370 human beings. In the
year 2000 it will have to feed 700 persons,
and 1,370 by 2025. In Western
Europe, by contrast, each square
kilometre will have to feed less than
500 persons by the year 2025.

The thick black line on graph, right,
shows in billions how the population
of the Third World would grow if the
present average growth rate were
to continue. It would reach the figure
of 12 billion around the year 2030.
The curve labelled 1975 indicates
that the Third World's population
would level off around the year
2060 at a figure of 6.27 billion if
population controls were Introduced
now. The other two curves show
that if population controls were
Introduced in 1985 and 1995, the
Third World's population would
level off at 7.97 billion (around 2070),
and 10.17 billion (around 2085).

kwe are talking of the "world" food
problem, the location of actual food
supplies and the location of actual
food deficits are clearly crucial fac¬
tors. For example, the potential for
increasing the production of prime
beef in Latin America is of minor
importance for the relief of food short¬
ages in South Asia, especially if it
is potential in the sense of assuming
use of land yet to be developed.
The comprehensiveness of our
approach, as exemplified by the num¬
ber of data levels included in the
Model, is also important. Too often
the question of food supply is con¬
sidered solely within the confines of
economics. It might be stated for
example that all we need is a three per
cent annual increase in agricultural
output and this is represented in
monetary terms. Yet one does not
eat dollars but grain; the real ques¬
tion is how much food can be pro¬
duced in physical terms. Hence a
mere accountant's approach is not
sufficient here.
Nor can the world food supply
problem be solved by a laboratory-
type approach, since the problem is
not what a wizard could do if he
could transform all arable land in the
world into a greenhouse, but rather
what can be produced with the land
of the type and area we have avail¬
able, using the economic and human
resources which exist at a given time.
Assessing the development of world
food supply on the basis of laboratory
or experimental results leads to rather
naïve, if not downright irresponsible,
conclusions. One is dealing, after all,
with human lives, which should not be
considered so lightheartedly.
Another important feature of our
model is its capacity to consider in
realistic terms the relationship between
the implementation of a population
policy and its effects on population
change. Our population sub-model

SOUTH ASIA'S
FOOD GAP
On the graph, left, the black line
represents the population increase in
South Asia, assuming that a population
policy is initiated that leads to
equilibrium fertility in about 50 years,
so that population grows from 1.3 billion
in 1975 to 3.8 billion in 2025. It is
also assumed that there will be no
starvation to slow down population
growth. In this situation the annual
protein needs of South Asia (top curve)
would increasingly surpass its own
annual protein production (bottom curve),
thereby resulting in a protein deficit
of an estimated 50 million tons in
the year 2025. (This protein deficit
is represented by the pink area.)
Even if these 50 million tons of protein
were available elsewhere in the world
for export to South Asia, it would
pose practically Insurmountable transport
and distribution problems.
CHILD MORTALITY AND

IN SOUTH ASIA
On graph, left, referring to South Asia,
the horizontal black dotted line
depicts the total daily protein ration
considered necessary for each person
70 grammes and the falling black
curve represents the daily regional
per capita protein supply that would
exist if South Asia's population were
to grow to 3.8 billion people In 2025.
If South Asia does not import enough
food in the years ahead, the Mesarovic-
Pestel model foresees half a billion
children in South Asia dying of hunger
by the year 2025 (red area on graph.).
Pink area shows number of children
who are expected to die up to the
year 2025 from other causes, even
if food is available. The above figures
are considered by the authors of the
Mesarovic-Pestel world study as very
rough estimates and should not be
considered as firm forecasts.

shows that if current trends prevail
there will be by the end of this century
more people in the "South" than in
the entire world today, and in another
25 years three times as many.
What would happen thereafter is so
astronomical as to be almost ridicu¬
lous to consider. There is no ques¬
tion as to whether such development
will take place or not. The only ques¬
tion is whether the slowdown of popu¬
lation growth will be the result of a
deliberate population policy or the
result of "natural forces" primarily
starvation and malnutrition.
We can feed into our model a range
of population policies aimed at bring¬
ing the population to equilibrium, at
different times-and at different levels,
and implemented with various degrees
of effectiveness.
The need to show the results of
various population policies in a real¬
istic manner is apparent when one
appreciates the delays between the
start of implementation and the effect.
For example, if a fully effective popu¬
lation policy, starting in 1975, achieves
its aim of bringing the fertility rate in
the entire "South" region to an equili¬
brium level in 35 years, the population
equilibrium is not reached until 75
years after the initiation of the policy,
that is 40 years after the objective of
fertility equilibrium has been reached.
Moreover, by the time population
equilibrium has been attained, the
population will be more than twice
as high as when the policy is initiated.
The need to look at least 50 years
ahead, when considering the develop¬
ment of the world system, is thus self-
evident. Unfortunately, few people
are willing to look 50 years ahead.
Finally, the strains on regional re¬
sources can be appreciated from the
fact that on each square kilometre of
cultivated land in the South Asia region
there will be, in the year 2000, 330
additional persons to be fed, and 1,000
33

34
additional persons in the year 2025.
These figures should be compared
with those for North America, where
there will be an additional 37 persons
per square kilometre of cultivated land
in the year 2000 and 80 more persons
in 2025. To cap all this, the rate of
growth of urban population in South
Asia is twice the growth rate of the
total regional population.
It is not surprising that the most
critical situation regarding food supply
is in South Asia and Tropical Africa.
Here we shall restrict ourselves to
South Asia, since it represents the
biggest problem because of the sheer
numbers involved.
We shall present the results in refer¬
ence to some key scenarios, each
representing a plausible sequence of
events resulting from various political
decisions and social choices.
First scenario
The purpose of the first scenario,
called "Standard", is to obtain an
indication of the persistency of the
food gap during the next 50 years:
in particular, whether the food situa¬
tion is going to be better or worse
and by how much.
The scenario assumes that the his¬
torical pattern of development based
on a somewhat optimistic view of the
past and present situation will continue.
In particular, a population policy is
assumed which will be successful in
bringing the fertility rate to equilibrium
level in about 50 years. It is also
assumed, optimistically, that the aver¬
age use of fertilizer per hectare in the
entire region will surpass the present
North American level towards the end
of the relevant time-period. This will
allow yields to increase by about
1,000 kilogrammes per hectare, again
on average, i.e. taking into account
every piece of land under cultivation.
This in fact is about the increase
which the Green Revolution has
brought on average in the best of all
lands in India and Pakistan. It is
also assumed that all remaining arable
land is quickly brought under cultiva¬
tion and that all the necessary techno¬
logical inputs including irrigation will
be available.
Finally, in order to assess the
magnitude of the food problem, we
assume that no massive starvation
takes place; the difference between
needs and regional production will
then indicate the food deficit which
has to be made up by regional imports
as outright aid if starvation is to be
prevented.
As regards food production, we
focus on a total protein content of the
food produced because it is here that
the worst shortages exist in the
present food supply situation. The
average diet of protein in more than
half of the world is estimated to be
about two-thirds of the daily need, and
in animal protein hardly one fourth.
Furthermore, since food supply in
South Asia relies predominantly on
grain, there is a close relationship
between protein and caloric intake.
If one is at the bottom level, then so
is the other.
The results of our analysis show
quite clearly that the gravity of the
food crisis in South Asia will far from
lessen but rather will increase to un¬
bearable proportions. The protein
deficit will increase up to more than
50 million tons annually; and this in
spite of all the assumed advances
including permanent cultivation of all
possible arable land. The cost of
importing such food would be stagger¬
ing. It would amount to one third of
the total economic output of the region
and perhaps three times as much as
could be paid for by exports.
Much more revealing than the mon¬
etary figures are the physical quan¬
tities involved. If the food deficiency
has to be covered chiefly by grains,
the annual import will have to reach
in 2025 about 500 million tons of grain,
which is a larger amount than the
total annual grain production, as opti¬
mistically projected from the historical
trends for the year 1980, in all the
north regions combined. In sheer
bulk, this would be double the ton-,
nage of all goods being shipped from
the United States overseas at present.
The average haul from the North
American Mid-West to either coast is
between 1,000 and 2,000 miles, so
about 750 billion ton-miles would be
required, if one had to carry the grain
by rail from the harvest place to the
ships in port. This ton-mileage is
nearly equal to the total annual rail-
freight mileage in the United States
of today. These quantities would
have to be moved to South Asia every
year, not only in the year 2025, and
increasingly beyond, without end, if
some other development does not
take place. In the case of India alone,
an enormous fleet of trucks would be
needed to distribute the grain to
500,000 villages.
Second scenario
Clearly, such a development is not
sustainable. But what would happen
if the needed food imports were not
provided? This is analysed in the
second scenario, in which all other
assumptions have remained the same,
except the assumption that the food
imports will be covered by someone
from somewhere. This assumption is
removed. The result is diet deficiency
and mass starvation.
The catastrophe would start some
time in the early 1980s and would
reach its peak around the year 2000,
when the deaths related to food defi¬
cit would more than double; after that
peak the natural consequences would
start bringing the population down.
The number of food deaths related
to child-birth would aggregate to about
500 million children, from 1980 up to
the year 2025 ; and the sufferings, of
course, would continue for many de¬
cades beyond. In such catastrophic

68

(Continued from page 34)
circumstances no population policy
could function any more.
Starvation would not be limited to
isolated small areas from which people
could escape, but would extend its
stranglehold over vast regions inhab¬
ited by hundreds of millions. The
population would be trapped and
there would be no fertile areas to go
to as the recent events in semi-arid
Africa have so tragically shown. There
is no historical precedent for this kind
of slow, inexorable destruction of the
population of entire regions which at
their peak were inhabited by several
billion people.
No doubt these events would
eventually lead to an equilibrium
population, and one might see this as
a return to the days before the popu¬
lation explosion took place, i.e. to the
times when birth-rate and death-rate
were nearly in balance. But, surely,
this must not be allowed to happen.
Obviously a solution requires a more
effective population policy.
Third scenario
In the third scenario we have
assumed that the equilibrium fertility
rates are achieved in 25 to 30 years
rather than in 50 years as in the first
scénario. Possibly an optimistic as¬
sumption, but certainly one that should
be achievable. .
Even under these more favourable
conditions the analysis shows that
severe malnutrition cannot be avoided
unless food imports are made avail¬
able, but the required imports are, this
time, on a much smaller scale and the
really large needs appear at a later
date than in previous scenarios,
starting in the 1990s rather than the
1980s.
Also, the amount of food which
would have to be covered by imports
would be reduced to about one fifth
of the needs. The volume of the
imports, in reference to production,
transportation, etc., might then be
manageable, but the economic impact
of food import would still be devastat¬
ing. The problem, however, would be
reduced to economics.
Fourth scenario
In order to see how this cost-eco¬
nomic obstacle to the solution might
be removed, we designed the fourth
scenario in which we assumed that
investment aid is provided to South
Asia in sufficient amounts and at the
required time to close the food gap.
The magnitude of such a programme
would require a concerted action by
all regions of the "North".
The analysis indicated a substan¬
tial increase in the export potential of
South Asia. If the world economic
situation realizes this great potential,
South Asia could pay for the bulk of
the necessary food import. The export
must be industrial, since the agricul¬
tural sector will be occupied with the
demands of the region.
This means that South Asia must
be allowed to develop its own export¬
able and competitive industrial special¬
ization which will not be left to the
mercy of narrow national interests but
rather will rely on long-term world
economic arrangements. This, in turn,
will require the emergence of a new
global economic order in which indus¬
trial specialization corresponds to
regional capacities, the most effective
utilization of labour and capital and of
available world resources, on a long-
term basis.
To summarize, the only feasible
strategy to meet the world food situa¬
tion calls for:
a global approach to the problem;
' productive investment and not only
commodity aid;
balanced economic development
for all regions;
' a world-wide diversification of in¬
dustry leading to a truly global and
balanced economic system;
an effective population policy.
This strategy is also the conclusion
reached by our model for every other
sector of human activity. Omission
of any one of these factors will lead
to certain disaster.
The situation is urgent. The solution
produced by our analysis requires
changes which cannot be achieved
without compromise among the many
parties involved. Even if the will is
there, how much time is left for us to
argue about the many details of
implementation?
The results of our analysis show
that achieving the aims of the popu¬
lation policy in 30 rather than 15 years
would make a difference of 80 per
cent to the number of births. A mere
20 years delay in initiating such a
policy would lead to a 300 per cent
increase. The inescapable conclusion
is that time is indeed short. Delay in
implementing the options to bring
food supply and need in balance could
be fatal.
