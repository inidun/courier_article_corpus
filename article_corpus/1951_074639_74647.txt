HAS THE UNIVERSE A FUTURE ?
PERHAPS the greatest and mostpersistent riddle in all of
science is that of the nature
of the cosmos. Almost inevitably,
a glance at the night sky with its
seemingly innumerable stars and
wispy nebulae bring to the human
mind such questions as :"What is
this universe in which we find our-
selves ? How did it all begin ?
What is its ultimate destiny ?"
By the very nature of such ques-
tions, definite, positive answers are
beyond the powers of science. Ne-
vertheless, from earliest times men
have pondered the subject of cos-
mology as it is called-the study of
the universe as a whole. Such spe-
culations come not only from theo-
logians and philosophers but from
scientists as well ; for it was inevi-
table that the increasing success of
physics in explaining our imme-
diate surroundings should have en-
couraged attempts to supply a ra-
tional basis for the more distant
reaches of our environment.
In a subject so devoid of land-
marks as cosmology, one is forced
to assume the existence of some-
thing to begin with. In the
eighteenth century the German
philosopher Kant and the French
mathematician Laplace imagined
a primordial cloud of gas which
eventually contracted, shedding
material to form the planets as it
did so. The remaining central body
was assumed to be the sun, our
own star. This process was presum-
ably taking place all through
space to give birth to the cosmic
population of sun-and-planet sys-
tems. Early in the present century
the American astronomer F. R.
Moulton subjected the contraction
hypothesis to mathematical scru-
by Ira M. Freeman
tiny and found it dubious. He, to-
gether with geologist T. C. Cham-
berlin, advanced an alternative
idea : a universe consisting initially
of already formed stars moving
haphazardly through the void.
When, on the average once in a
million million years, two of these
stars happen to pass close to each
other, great filaments of matter are
torn from their sides by gravit-
ational attraction. This material,
drifting along with each parent
star, would ultimately condense to
form planets coursing about it. This
so-called"PIanetesimal Theory"was
refined and improved by English
astronomers such as Jeans and Jef-
freys, and became the accepted doc-
trine in its field.
While these close-to-home pro-
blems concerning mere planetary
systems were thus claiming atten-
tion, the relativity theorists had
been busy with attempts to under-
stand the structure and pattern of
the universe as an entity-ques-
tions having to do with the nature
of space and time and with such
ideas as whether or not the uni-
verse is limited in extent. From
their intricate, mathematical equa-
tions they distilled suggestive ideas
bearing on the inherent curvature
of space ; of a cosmos that is finite
in extent, yet unbounded ; of a uni-
verse whose members may all be
fleeing from each other at tremen-
dous rates.
In the meantime, observation had
been advancing, too-not only as-
tronomical observation, but obser-
vation of laboratory phenomena
which might some day contribute
sturdy props to the structure of a
truly comprehensive theory of the
universe. The spectroscope had re-
vealed the composition, tempera-
tures and speeds of motion of the
stars and nebulae within reach of
our telescopes. Nuclear physics had
disclosed the source of the lavish
outpouring of stellar energy to be
nuclear condensation of the hydro-
gen of which stars are, for the most
part, composed.
It was shortly before the begin-
ning of World War II that two
young Cambridge University ma-
thematicians, Fred Hoyle and Ray-
mond Lyttleton, began a collabora-
tion that was to give science its
boldest and most comprehensive
cosmology up to the present time.
They subjected to mathematical
analysis the often-proposed idea
that the stars are formed as-con-
densations from a thin cloud of gas
stretching through all of space.
The results showed that the fate of
a star is governed by the extent to
which it sweeps up and draws to
itself this wispy matter. As an in-
cipient star gathers together suffi-
cient material it becomes hotter
and hotter and finally (after thou-
sands of millions of years) its tem-
perature is high enough to kindle
the nuclear reaction on which all
stars must rely for producing their
energy. What occurs subsequently
depends on how abundant are the
cosmic clouds of gas through which
the star moves. Our sun, as it
happens, has in the past browsed
through relatively barren pastures,
picking up only a few shreds of
matter and-fortunately for us-
remaining an average, middle-class
star. If a star greedily gathers too
much matter, it heats up at a pro-
digious rate and soon, after mere-
ly a few hundred million years, it
blows up. The Hoyle-Lyttleton
theory gives a plausible account of
the manner in which the planets
might be formed from the debris of
such an explosion.
Having put the explanation of
the origin of stars and their pla-
nets on a reasonable basis, Hoyle
and Lyttleton turned to a consi-
deration of the mechanism of the
universe in its entirety. Here they
joined forces'width two colleagues,
Bondi and Gold, to develop what
is certainly one of the most revo-
lutionary of contemporary scienti-
fic theories. Briefly, they adopt
the now familiar idea that the uni-
verse is expanding, and that this
swelling of space itself finally car-
ries the distant galaxies of stars
out of existence entirely. To com-
pensate for the loss it is assumed-
and this is the boldest of their
postulates-that new matter is con-
tinually being created, atom for
atom, through all of space. The
entire picture is one of serene,
comfortable continuity. But plea-
sant as it is to contemplate, the
Hoyle-Lyttleton-Bondi-Gold version
of our cosmos is assuredly not the
last word on the subject ; for it is
probable that theorizing about the
umverse, like the universe itself, is
something without end.
