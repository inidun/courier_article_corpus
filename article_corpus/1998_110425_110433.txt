Ten centuries of uninterrupted creative effort shaped the
architecture and art treasures of Mount Athos, which was
placed on the World Heritage List in 1988.

St. Panteleimon, which was rebuilt In the early 19th century.
Mount Athos, a rocky head¬
land soaring 2,000 metres
out of the Aegean Sea, is the most
easterly of the three promontories
of the Greek peninsula of
Chalkidiki. The peninsula's rugged
terrain and inhospitahle coastline
make settlement and communica¬
tions on it extremely difficult.
There is evidence that five towns
existed there in Antiquity, but
later, after the destruction and rav¬
ages of the early Middle Ages, the
site appears to have attracted only
anchorites and monks.
The origins of monastic life on
Athos are lost in legend. The ear¬
liest historical sources attesting
to the presence of a solid religious
structure date from the ninth cen¬
tury. At that time the monks lived
ascetic lives in isolated huts or
kellia that were in many cases
interconnected to form small
monastic communities or lavras.
There also seems to have been a
rudimentary form of central orga¬
nization, perhaps not unlike the
monastic republic that developed
later. But cenobitic monasteries
(where the monks have everything
in common) were only found out¬
side the peninsula in the nearby
inhabited regions.
The first cenobitic monastery
on Athos (the Great Lavra) was
founded by Athanasius the
Athonite in 963 and was soon fol¬
lowed by others. By the middle of
the eleventh century there were
no less than 200 "monasteries",
but numbers fluctuated consider¬
ably during the Byzantine period,
and it was only under the Ottoman
occupation that the numbers and
types of monasteries on Mount
Athos stabilized into more or less
their present state. When
Stavronikita Monastery was
founded in the mid -sixteenth cen¬
tury, the number of monasteries
was fixed at twenty, the present

Stavronikita, the
smallest monastery
on Mount Athos.
Dedicated to St.
Nicholas, it was
rebuilt in the 16th
century by Jeremy I,
the Patriarch of
Constantinople.
number. During the same period,
the kellia, some of which replaced
defunct monastic communities,
gradually came under the control
of the twenty monasteries. At the
end of the seventeenth century,
sketes large communities depen¬
dent on the monasteries were
founded. The first of these foun¬
dations were "idiorrhythmic"
(each monk living at his own
rhythm); later ones were cenobitic.
Throughout their history, both
under the Byzantine and Ottoman
Empires, the large monasteries
wielded exceptional economic
power and enjoyed a privileged
position. Their main sources of
wealth were the exploitation of
large estates (metochia), dona¬
tions received from sovereigns and
other prominent people and, in
later times, from zefeies (long-
term fund-raising trips) made by
monks to the Orthodox countries
where Athos always exercised
great spiritual influence.
These spiritual and material
factors had important repercus¬
sions on building activity on Mount
Athos. Athonite architecture
reflects architectural ambition and
a diversity of influences the latter
being particularly apparent in the
later (eighteenth-twentieth cen¬
tury) buildings. This marriage of
different cultural and architec¬
tural inputs and the use of crafts¬
men from different regions gave
rise to organic building complexes
which served as prototypes for
other Orthodox countries. After
the fall of Constantinople in 1453
and the Ottoman dissolution of the
Byzantine empire, Mount Athos,
which was directly subject to the
Patriarch of Constantinople,
became one of the most important
centres of artistic activity in the
Orthodox world and perhaps its
leading architectural centre.
In the late fourteenth century,
Mount Athos entered a period of
economic depression which lasted
until the end of the fifteenth cen¬
tury and, for some monasteries,
until the early sixteenth. The pop¬
ulation, which in its two great peri¬
ods of expansion (the eleventh and
fourteenth centuries) is reckoned
to have numbered about 6,000 and
4,000 monks respectively, proba¬
bly fell to around 1,500. But as
the fifteenth century came to a
close, a new period of activity
began with the renovation ofbuild¬
ings, the construction of imposing
fortifications and the extension of
the enclosures in some monasteries.
This activity came to an end at
the beginning of the seventeenth
century, when Mount Athos again
gradually sank into decline, this
time until the. mid-eighteenth cen¬
tury. From the second half of the
eighteenth century until the Greek
War of Independence of 1821,
there was a renaissance during
which some, of the idiorrhythmic
monasteries converted to the ceno¬
bitic way of life. New construction
work continued until the end of
the nineteenth century, and the
main architectural imprint on
Mount Athos today is that of the
eighteenth and nineteenth cen¬
turies. From 1850 on, Russian
monks flocked to the peninsula,
bringing with them an entirely dif¬
ferent kind of architecture. At the
turn of the century construction
activity again slackened and was
then interrupted by the First
World War. Mount Athos fell bark
into a deep sleep from which it is
only now emerging.
