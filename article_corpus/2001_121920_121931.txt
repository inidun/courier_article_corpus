T
hings are going from bad to worse in
M a r t i s s a n t . I t ’s the same all over the
Haitian capital of Po r t - a u - P r i n c e, but the
situation is even more acute in this
sprawling slum that stretches up the side of
a hill south of the city. At the last count, in 1996,
about 25,000 people lived here. And the number is
growing all the time because of the high birth rate and
the exodus of people from the countryside. Th e r e ’s
filth everywhere—puddles of dirty water in potholed
s t r e e t s, gutters choked with garbage,buildings erected
without any planning.The inhabitants,who lack even
the most basic public services,call themselves  “ p e o p l e
on the outside.”
But they have laboured, since the fall of the
Duvalier dictatorship in 1986,to build up alternative
services enabling the community to live, or rather,
to survive. To d a y, jobless youngsters just out of
s c h o o l , others who have learned a trade,
unemployed people and women are all involved
in running a variety of community groups dedicated
to different goals.
É d o u a r d , a father of three, is an active leader of
the Youth Association of Saint Bernadette and
Malet Streets (AJSM). “Our first concern is the
garbage,” he says. AJSM members, most of whom
have no job,pick up the rubbish and take it down the
hill to the main road.The garbage trucks don’t pass
through the teeming streets of Martissant.
The group has submitted a $900 project proposal
to the Port-au-Prince city authorities to buy gloves,
w h e e l b a r r o w s, picks and shovels, and even
megaphones to keep people informed. So far, t h e r e
has been no response. “We’ve been shunted from
one office to another,” says Malherbe, an A J S M
m e m b e r. “If this goes on, w e ’ll call everyone
together and stage a demonstration.”
Garbage disposal and other sensitive problems
sometimes set off bloody disputes between
people who live higher up the hill and those lower
down who suffer as a result of the rubbish dumped
t h e r e. Calling the police doesn’t help: they refuse to
get involved and advise people to deal with it
themselves.
When neighbourhood quarrels erupt, p e o p l e
turn to the older and wiser
inhabitants of the town—often
natives of Martissant or
homeowners—to mediate and
restore peace. When this
h a p p e n s, two or three elders put
their heads together to find a
satisfactory solution rooted in
common law. Recourse to the
state legal system is rare. “ I t ’s a
waste of time,” says one man.

The inhabitants of
the Port-au-Prince slum
of Martissant have created
a mosaic of community
groups to fill in as best
they can for a crying absence
of public services

Demanding that a neighbour be taken to court
could also be risky. Would the bailiff dare come
face to face with the ch i m è r e s, the gangs of
j o b l e s s youths in the pay of the ruling party?
C o n fident of their unbridled power, these youths
use intimidation to control access to the slums
they hold sway over.
The young people of Martissant have also
formed “vigilance brigades” of 10 to 15 people to
defend themselves against robbers and prevent
crime after dark. Not a full-time force, they are
mainly active after an upsurge of crime.
“We look out for trouble from the rooftops,”
says Charles, who belongs to one of these groups.
“As soon as we see a ze n g l e n d o [Haitian Creole
for a thug], we alert everyone by blowing into a
l a m b i [a giant sea shell].” The inhabitants
immediately spring into action, catch the ze n g l e n d o
and take him to the police,who often let the culprits
go free.“So sometimes he gets lynched by an angry
crowd,” says Charles.
During the day, Martissant hums with activity.
Vendors wander the streets hawking their goods
while others set up shop along the main road
b y the seashore, often spreading their wares out
i n the middle of the street. Sometimes the
authorities send out men to force them back on
to the p a v e m e n t s.
Most of the women in Martissant work outside
the formal economy. They have no ready access to
credit, so they turn to money-lenders who “stab”
them with exorbitant interest rates that can reach
30 percent a month.Lenders resort to any means,
including armed force and violence, to make debtors
repay their loans. But there is no protection to be
f o u n d :victims have little faith in the state’s capacity
to address their grievances.
“We’ve set up an informal community bank,”
says Marie-Eramite,of the Martissant Organization
of Valiant Women (OFVM).About 50 people pay
one gourde (four U. S. cents) each day. After a
m o n t h , the kitty is handed over as credit to two
members of the group. This works better, she says,
than the more traditional system in which monthly
deposits are made.
“ The state should do its job and build us a
market here,” says Guerda,a single mother with fiv e
c h i l d r e n . Like many heads of families, her main
worry is paying the rent for her “house,” a single
room for which she pays between $200 and $300
a year.
Bribes to go
to high school
“ The rent was due yesterday and I’m busy lying
low,” she says. Guerda earns less than 36 gourdes
($1.40),which is the official daily minimum wage.
She knows her landlord wants to raise the rent by
about $80 a year, even though she can barely
manage the current amount.Guerda also points out
that landlords in Martissant “ d o n ’t pay any taxes on
the rent they collect.”
Only a tiny number of houses or shacks are
connected to the electricity grid.
Many people tap into the supply
i l l e g a l l y, using special wiring. A n d
some sell the stolen electricity to
their neighbours for about $2 a
month.
When there’s a fir e,“ i t ’s up to all
of us to put it out,” says Marie-
Eramite. “Last summer, we had to
form a k o n b i t [a Creole word
designating a group of people
working together] to extinguish the
fla m e s. The whole neighbourhood
helped fetch water in whatever was
at hand. The children helped by
throwing stones at the blaze.By the
time the firemen arrived, the fir e
had been extinguished.At fir s t ,t h e y
refused to help, saying the streets
were too narrow for them to enter.”
Parents in Martissant dream of
being able to send their children to
secondary school.But this is hard to
do, says Guerda,“because they ask
us for bribes of about $40 per pupil.”
The cost of schooling rises every
year and the c o l l è g e s [high schools]

Many children never even set foot in the slum’s poorly equipped school.


hardly deserve the name. “When my kids go off to
school each morning to Hermann Hereaux,one of
the oldest state schools around here, I worry about
the walls collapsing onto them,” says Yo l e t t e.Th e r e
are no toilets or drinking water at the school. The
neighbourhood sometimes goes without water for
three months at a stretch.The parents have decided
to get together to buy the materials to build new
wooden benches for the children to sit on. “ Th e
carpenters are going to make them for free,” she
says.
Valiant as the efforts of civil society may be, t h e y
soon come up against the obstacles of enormous
needs and meagre resources.Take for example the
Haitian Women’s Solidarity Organization, which
opened a clinic in Martissant in 1996, the slum’s fir s t
medical facility. “ We look after women and
children,” says Marie-Yolenne, who works there.
The clinic is open three days a week and has a
female gynaecologist who also acts as a general
p r a c t i t i o n e r. She sees about 3 0 patients a day, w h o
pay 15 gourdes ($0.60) for an appointment.B u t ,s h e
says,“they struggle to pay for the medicine.”
Like the inhabitants of other slums, the people
of Martissant believed change would come with
the December 1990 presidential elections, w h i c h
brought the left-wing priest Jean-Bertrand A r i s t i d e
to power. But they were disappointed. Far fewer
went out to vote last November 26 when he ran for
re-election.
“ We still hope things will change,” says Guerda
stoically.“Because we just can’t go on like this.” ■
