◗ Is there really a crisis in higher education?
I dislike the word “ c ri s i s ” . Although the pro-
blems differ from country to country, h i g h e r
e d u c ation all over the world is going through a
p e riod characterized by the gr owth of the stu-
dent populat i o n , an increase in unit costs, a n d
the difficulty of gearing courses to the gr a d u at e s ’
need to find jobs that match their training. T h e
entire world is facing a hard choice between pure
market logi c, where unive rsities would compete
with each other like bu s i n e s s e s , and the curr e n t
system dominated by the public unive rs i t y
bu r e a u c r a cy. L a s t l y, the planetary deve l o p m e n t
of the unive rsity system has not reduced inequa-
lities as it was supposed to do, but has actually
helped to exacerbate them.
◗ In what way?
There are two mechanisms at work that attract the
best students,regardless of their nationality, to the
best unive rs i t i e s ,p ri m a rily A m e rican ones. Not only
will the elites of the South continue streaming to
the countries of the Nort h , especially English-spea-
king ones,but unive rsites are going to create “ n o m a d
c a m p u s e s ” in the client countri e s. Like companies,
brands such as Harvard and Stanford will be expor-
ted with their standards of quality to Singapore and
New Delhi. Because of this pri vat i z at i o n , we will
no longer be able to speak of the North as such, bu t
of autonomous unive rsity systems. H a rvard and
Oxford will lend their labels to the unive rsities of
the South.The major universities will function like
vacuum pumps,sucking up the best students.
◗ Is this trend unavoidable?
It must be resisted by creating transnational ins-
titutions capable of combating the introduction
of market logic into higher educat i o n . The pri c e
to pay for that is the setting up of mechanisms to
monitor the quality of public serv i c e . Public uni-
ve rsities must agree to submit to assessments
made by outside bodies. Europe should set up
an assessment agency that would make unive rs i-
ties permanently open to scru t i ny and have them
sanctioned if they do not comply with the stan-
dards set for them.
◗ What criteria would those assessments be
based on? Should the aim of higher education
be to train producers or citizens?
It has to do both, of course.The ties between uni-
ve rsities and business must be strengthened so that
companies more readily agree to accept training
p r o grammes that lead to diplomas. At the same
t i m e , e ve ry unive rsity gr a d u ate should have lear-
ned at least four things there:h ow to be a good citi-
zen,how to communicate,create and criticize.In a
country like France, there is still room for impro-
vement in that regard. E d u c ation does not stress
the importance of those four concepts enough.C o m-
m u n i c ating means knowing how to use a computer,
but it also means knowing how to speak at least two
foreign languages,which is rare.The skills needed for
critical discussion are also far from widespread.
◗ What does it mean to be a citizen?
F i rst of all, it means knowing the law, o n e ’s
duties and one’s ri g h t s. But it also means lear-
ning how to live in society, to make decisions, t o
p a rt i c i p at e . Student life itself should be a firs t -
hand experience in learning about democracy.
◗ Your comments suggest that democracy is
having rather a rough time worldwide, with
inequalities increasing. But is higher education
becoming more democratic in the wealthy
countries?
It is becoming a mass phenomenon without
becoming more democrat i c. In the rich countri e s
there is what might be called “cultural insider
d e a l i n g ” .This means that children whose parents
are unive rsity gr a d u ates not only possess what
the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu calls “ c u l-
tural capital”, but have another essential adva n-
tage as we l l : access to networks enabling them
to find out how to acquire the best educat i o n .
This phenomenon is wo rsening in societies that
are increasingly fragmented into communities
living side by side but cut off from each other.
To d ay only a small number of people have access
to genuine higher educat i o n . In many parts of
the world we are witnessing a lengthening of the
p ri m a ry education period and the virtual disap-
pearance of secondary educat i o n ; p ri m a ry and
higher education meet up with each other. A n d
higher education is splitting in two : “ l owe r
h i g h e r ” e d u c at i o n , available to eve ryo n e , g o e s
more or less from the last ye a rs of high school to
the master’s degr e e . Access to true higher edu-
c at i o n – p o s t gr a d u ate studies–requires member-
ship of certain social and cultural circles. T h at is
h ow inequalities persist behind a semblance of
d e m o c r a cy. ■

Tomorrow’s world elite

expert fears the rise of a two-tier system, with quality higher education
reserved exclusively for the elite
