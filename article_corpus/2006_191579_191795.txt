                                   were dashed because she was female. not one to give up, she switche
                         sports and eventually became an olympic gold medalist in athleticism.
maria mutola
the running wonder from mozambique
s a young girl, Maria Mutola was 
more interested in playing foot-
ball than studying. She would fre-
quently skip class to go kick the 
ball with the boys from her poor 
neighborhood in the outskirts of 
Maputo (Mozambique). 
Maria had a remarkable talent for 
dribbling, running fast and scor-
ing goals, and -- despite her par-
ents’ opposition -- she dreamed of 
becoming a professional football 
player. “One day, when I was 14 
or 15 years old”, she recalls, “the 
coach of the Aguia d’Ouro foot-
ball club was passing through my 
neighborhood and, after watching 
me play for a while, invited me to 
join his team.” 
Maria’s participation in the city’s 
football championship was a 
great success, but widely con-
tested by the other teams. “Being 
the only female player brought 
me a lot of problems, but I always 
tried to just concentrate on play-
ing good football.” 
Aguia d’Ouro went on to win the 
city’s championships in 1987, but 
the losing team in the final filed a 
formal complaint to FIFA against 
the use of a female player in of-
ficial competitions. 
FIFA allowed Mutola’s team 
to keep the trophy. But the 15-
year old was nevertheless dev-
astated, as she understood that 
she would never be allowed to 
pursue a career as a professional 
football player. 
What she didn’t know was that 
this episode would not be the 
end, but merely the beginning of 
an extraordinary journey in the 
world of sport.
“We have so many great athletes, 

but we have a culture that doesn’t 
support sports. I had to send her to 
America because that was where 
she would improve the most.” - 
José Craveirinha
From football 
to athletics
Maria’s ordeal made the headlines 
and grabbed the attention of José 
Craveirinha, Mozambique’s most 
renowned poet and a passionate 
athletics fan. After watching her 
play football, he knew she had the 
potential to be a great runner. He 
gave her a pair of training shoes 
and introduced her to his son 
Stélio, a track and field coach. 
“My first training with Stélio didn’t 
go very well,” remembers Maria. “I 
wasn’t used to running so much, 
and after that session I couldn’t 
even sit down. I didn’t show up to 
practice for a whole week!” 
But Craveirinha didn’t give up on 
her. “The Poet came to my house,” 
Mutola says. “He convinced my 
parents that athletics could open a 
lot of doors for me.” 
Craveirinha was right. Just a few 
months after her first workout, 
Maria Mutola won a silver medal 
in the 800m at the 1988 African 
Championships. That same year, 
she represented Mozambique at 
the Seoul Olympic Games. 
In 1990, she won a scholarship 
from the International Olympic 
Committee to study and train in 
the USA. “It is truly a sad thing,” 
Craveirinha said at the time, “We 
have so many great athletes, but 
we have a culture that doesn’t sup-
port sports. I had to send her to 
America because that was where 
she would improve the most.” 
Throughout the 90s, Maria Mu-
tola became one of the world’s 
elite track athletes, dominating the 
800m, 1000m and 1500m in ma-
jor championships. 
Her crowning achievement came 
at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 
when she brought home Mozam-
bique’s first ever Olympic gold in 
the 800m. 
In 2003, she was awarded the 
world’s biggest prize in athletics, 
a one million dollar jackpot for 6 
consecutive wins in the Golden 
League competitions of the Inter-
national Association of Athletics 
Federations. 
That same year, Maria was 
appointed Youth Emissary for 
the United Nations Development 
Programme, in recognition of her 
outstanding career in athletics.
The Mutola 
Foundation
After almost 20 years of dedica-
tion to athletics, Maria believes she 
still has a lot to do for sport. That 
is why she has created the Maria 
Mutola Foundation, which funds 
education and athletics for under-
privileged children. 
Since 2001, the Foundation has 
permitted over 30 Mozambican 
young athletes to participate in 
international competitions. It also 
works on the integration of sport 
and other socio-cultural activities 
in school curricula, and is planning 
the construction of a professional 
training centre in Maputo. 
“All kids in Mozambique should be 
able to have a Craveirinha in their 
lives,” says Maria Mutola, “some-
one who believes in their talent 
and is willing to support them. 
That’s what my foundation is for.” 
Three years ago, the Mutola Foun-
dation sent Carina Pinto to study 
and train in the USA. “She now 
attends the New York University 
and will graduate in two years”, 
Maria says with pride. “The day 
she receives her diploma will be a 
great victory for me”. 
At 34, Maria Mutola is a national 
hero and one of Maputo’s avenues 
has recently been named after her. 
When asked about her legacy, she 
says humbly “I am proud that my 
program is now helping so many 
young athletes. All I want is for kids 
to understand, like I did 25 years 
ago, that the combination of edu-
cation and sport can be the key to 
success.”
