theme suggested for the
observance of World Health Day in
1952-points to a goal shared by
all nations, and it shows where some
of the problems lie which must be
solved if efforts to improve health
throughout the world are to succeed.
Despite the magnificent progress
made by medical science, three out
of every four men, women and
children in the world still suffer
from diseases spread by unsafe water
supplies, unsanitary excreta dis-
posal, uncontrolled insects and
rodents, and inadequate protection
of milk and other foods. The res-
ponsibility for this tragic wastage
of human life and energy rests witch
each of us, individually, in our
three-fold capacity as members of
the family and of the local com-
munity and as citizens of a shrunk-
en world.
Each of us needs to realize that
sanitation is, after all, a way of life.
Whether we live in a"developed"
or an"underdeveloped"country, it
is our duty both to ourselves and to
our neighbours to practice certain
elementary principles of hygiene
which can be applied with little, if
any, expense by individuals and by
families. Keeping a clean home, a
clean shop, a clean factory and a

clean neighbourhood, we are meeting
one of the first requirements for our
own health and for a healthy com-
munity.
But we must go beyond this ; we
must also support fully the establish-
ment and development of local and
national programmes in community
sanitation. They deserve our sup-
port because they aim at providing
services designed to protect us
against the many dangers that may
threaten health and life if conditions
in our physical environment are
unsatisfactory.
Finally, as citizens of a world
where all men have become neigh-
bours, we must share with one an-
other the things we learn about pro-
moting health and preventing
disease through the techniques avail-
able to a modern science of environ-
mental sanitation. Such an ex-
change of knowledge among all
nations is as justified on humani-
tarian grounds as it is essential
for reasons of self-interest.
The World Health Organization
has, from its beginning, given a high
priority to international measures
for raising standards of environ-
mental sanitation. Along with its
other activities, WHO will continue
to support and encourage local, na-
tional and international efforts di-
rected towards helping people to
achieve a reasonable control of the
physical features of their environ-
ment.
I earnestly hope the observance
of World Health Day on this April
7 will serve to make clear to men,
women and children everywhere the
value of healthy surroundings and
their importance for the health of
all peoples.
