BRIDGES BETWEEN EAST & WEST
An analysis of Index Translationum'
by Robert L Collison
It is very tempting to regard the Index Translationum
solely as a bibliography: it is arranged as one, and
the majority of its users have an overwhelmingly
bibliographical interest in its contents. Reference librar¬
ians are well accustomed to handing the Index to
readers who wish to check whether a certain book has
been translated, and frequently make use of it themselves
for discovering such details as original titles. For these
purposes the Index is an admirable tool and, as its long
file increases year by year, it will very soon cover the
whole world. There would thus appear lit.tle point in
singling it out from the many other excellent inter¬
national bibliographies which are now in being.
To make no more use of the Index Translationum than
one would of a bibliography of iodine, of gerontology or
of genealogy, would however be to ignore completely its
value as a significant human document in the increas¬
ingly important matter of the effective communication
of ideas. The history of translation has never been
adequately written: it may indeed be an impossible task,
for who can assess the degree of impact of an idea, who
can trace accurately a curve denoting the decline in that
impact according to the length of delay which it
undergoes? Such ideas arise as one glances through the
columns of the Index, for there is much evidence that
very few books achieve speedy translation.
Even more important is the fact that while some
fortunate works are translated into several languages
immediately, their language-field may still be somewhat
limited geographically. Thus, the Index Translationum,
1953, shows that Alain Bombard's Naufragé Volontaire
appeared within a year also in Danish, Dutch, English,
German, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and
Swedish a considerable achievement until one considers
that no Asian or East European language is included in
this' list. One can then make an analysis of the exchange
of culture between Asia and the Western world during
the same year. But as it is compiled from the Index Trans¬
lationum, it is not complete since some countries are not
represented. Yet it does give a fair picture of the present
state of affairs and there is no reason to believe that the
analysis of other years would reveal any important
differences.
The analysis shows that books were translated into
Asian languages from Polish, Russian, German, Norwe¬
gian, Ancient Greek, French, Italian and English, for the
countries of Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, India
and Indonesia. (Japan, with its 1,299 transla¬
tions, has been omitted, since its statistics
would unduly distort the picture given by
the remainder of the countries.) It will
be noted that' among the languages missing

from this list there are both Spanish and Portuguese, lan¬
guages which embrace not only the Iberian peninsula
but also the whole of Latin America. This means Asia
will remain almost completely unfamiliar with the works
of important contemporary South Américain novelists,
such as Gabriel Casaccia of Paraguay, the Colombian
Eduardo Caballero Caldeón, and the chief of Brazil's
modern literary movement Mario de Andrade (1893-1945).
Nor is this to say that the Western world is much
better off concerning Latin-American literature. Few
people in Europe are familiar with Argentine's out¬
standing writer Victoria Ocampo and her works of
literary criticism on Dante, Keyserling, Virginia Woolf,
etc. Admittedly poetry makes special demands on the
ability of the translator, but this should not excuse the
neglect, outside the Spanish-speaking world, of eminent
writers like Jorge Carrera Andrade of Quito, Jose Luis
Cano from Andalusia, or Venezuela's Miguel Otero Silva.
The position is even worse as far as Asian languages
are concerned. The analysis shows that in the exchange
of ideas the West is the gainer, since the number of
Asian works translated is large and also covers many
countries. But an examination of the type of books
translated reveals very unequal treatment. While there
is a tendency to translate the older works, and those of
such outstanding writers as Sri Aurobindo, Das Gupta,
Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru, etc., there are large fields quite
untouched; thus, such Telugu poets as Viresalingam,
Guruzada, Nanduri and Devulapalli, are known only to
Western specialists. The poems of Kuo Mo-jo, now
President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along
with the novels of Pa Chin, Mao Tun and China's leading
woman writer Ting Ling, remain mostly in their original
language, and the West has not been able to read The
White-haired Woman (a play co-operatively written by
members of the Lu Hsun Academy at Yenan), or Taghi
Maddarasi's Jecholiah and her Loneliness which was
recently published in Teheran.
Robert Musil, long neglected in his native Austria and
in Germany, wrote Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften in 1930
the English edition of this great novel did not begin
to appear until 1953, and, although the translation was
warmly welcomed and had a kind of literary success,
its impact was hardly that of C. K. Scott Moncrieffs
translation of Proust which reached English-speaking
readers very soon after the publication of the original
volumes. Henri Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes
waited 16 years before an English translation was publish¬
ed, and its effect cannot therefore be compared to that
of Kafka's works which were available in other languages
very early. This state of affairs continues.
Nor is such a position restricted solely to literature: in
the field of art, the works of Emile Mâle and Henri
Focillon are largely unknown to those who cannot
read French. Take for instance, Focillon's remarkable
L'An mille (Paris, Colin, 1952) which summarizes with all
the vigour of an outstanding scholar the state of the world
in the apocalyptic year a.D. 1,000: even to mediaevalists,
outside of France, this book is mostly unknown. Similarly,
in the more practical fields of industry and trade, such
works as Marc Rosenberg's Geschichte der Goldschmiede¬
kunst auf technischer Grundlage (Frankfurt, Keller and
Baer, 1910-22, 4 parts), Marcel Huet's Traité de pisci¬
culture (2nd ed. Brussels, La Vie Rustique, 1953) and
Lucien Neipp's Les Machines à imprimer depuis Guten¬
berg (Paris, Club Bibliophile de France, 1951), remain in
their original languages publishers who have been
approached claim that there is not the public for such
works to make translations a commercial proposition.
The barriers which face the translator are in any case
real and discouraging. In the first place he must satisfy
himself that no translation of the book he has in mind
has already been madea point on which the Index
Translationum provides good guidance. Then he must
obtain translation rights: the words Tous droits de repro-
12
auction et de traduction même partielle formellement
réservés stare at him from the back of each title-page,
and the concession he seeks is by no means easily obtained
if he is a newcomer to the work. For months, perhaps
years, he must maintain himself while he makes his
translation. As his only intellectual reward his name
may appear on the title-page, . and even then the
reviewers' disagreement with minor points of interpreta¬
tion may suffice to condemn his whole effort.
The legal position and the problem of payment for
translation rights may partly explain why the lists of
translations into Asian languages include so little contem¬
porary material. For instance, in Indonesia in 1952
translations were made of Fenimore Cooper's Last of the
Mohicans, Dumas' La Dame aux camélias, Gogol's Taras
Bulba, Kipling's Elephant Boy, the Adventures of Baron
Mimchhausen, Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and three plays
of Shakespeare. The only well-known modern works were
Dale Carnegie's How to win friends and influence people,
Stephen Vincent Benét's The Devil and Daniel Webster,
and Dorothy Parker's The Big Blonde.
Thus the Index Translationum in recent years has
listed little copyright material and few scientific or
technical works for Asian countries. While not
denying that the selection of non-copyright classics is a
wise move for any publisher who is building up his list of
steady sellers, the present outlook for the contemporary
creative writer is not bright. Assuming that in any one
country perhaps only five works of international importan¬
ce are issued in any single year, it is reasonable to try
to ensure for those works a world audience as speedily as
possible. Between those works and their potential readers
in other countries and continents lie various barriers
legal, financial, linguistic. None of these is insuperable,
given a modicum of goodwill and continuing international
co-operation. By means of mutual agreements for the
exchange of literary property, the legal and financial
barriers could be swept away at least for those countries
which lack large reserves of foreign currency.
The linguistic barrier is however far more substantial.
In the first place translators are not plentiful in any
country, and they face many problems. F. A. Rush gives
some idea of the difficulties which exist concerning
dictionaries ("Dictionaries and the translator", Inter¬
national PEN bulletin of selected books, March 1955,
pp.7-10), pointing out that most dictionaries continue to
perpetuate a false idea of translation. Brenno Silveira
in his brief but masterly A Arte de traduzir (Sao Paulo,
Ediçoes Melhoramentos, 1954) emphasizes the differing
claims of free and literal translation. Other difficulties
are speed in the case of topical works, and inadequate
payment. All these difficulties affect Asian and Western
translators alike, though the larger potential audiences
in many Western languages tends to make translation in
the West slightly easier.
To the individual translator one or more of these
difficulties may be insuperable. One solution is pointed
to in the entry for Burma in the Index Translationum.
Each year the Index lists a number of translations done
by the Burma Translation Society. This is an idea which
could be adapted to suit the needs of many countries,
and provide parts for different categories of people.
Critics could join in the work of selecting the right books
to be translated, business men organize negotiations over
copyright and publication details, language experts divide
the field according to their various skills, while well-
informed amateurs might share the work of proof¬
reading, publicity and marketing.
The exchange of literary output between East and West
remains quite inadequate, slow and uncertain. A more
intensive study of each other's publications and improved
international co-operation over translation could
however, help the reader of the future to become aware
of intellectual advances without the long delays to which
the world is now accustomed.
