The problem raised here 
does not in any way 
imply the recognition that 
social sciences are a field 
of their own, nor that they 
are defined by special cha-
racter ist ics. Do social 
sciences deserve a sepa-
rate place, next to the 
humanities on one hand, 
and to natural sciences on 
the other? Do they offer 
any real originality, other 
than – as has amusingly 
been said – of not being 
more soc ial than the 
others, and much less 
scientific? 
Even in the United 
States, where the tripar-
t ite div ision between 
human sciences, social sciences 
and natural sciences seemed to 
have been solidly established for 
half a century, new categories are 
appearing. Thus, behavioral scien-
ces bring together the three orders 
to the extent that they directly 
interest humans. And yet, the 
best French translation of “beha-
vioral sciences“ is sciences de la 
conduite humaine, that is to say 
that there is a return to the bipar-
tite distinction, which has been 
traditional in Europe since the 
Renaissance: on the one hand, 
natural sciences, which deal with 
the objective world; on the other, 
the humanities, which deal with 
humans and the world in relation 
to them.
These methodological problems 
have an immediate importance for 
our debate: if social sciences must 
be considered as separate scien-
ces, their contribution to the 
humanization of civilization is not 
at all obvious; it needs to be 
demonstrated. If, on the other 
hand, social sciences are not dif-
ferent from the research traditio-
nally carried out in the 
name of human sciences, if, 
therefore, they are within 
the field of the humanities, 
it is self-evident that any 
thinking about humans is 
“humanising” just because 
it is “human”. According to 
one conception or the other, 
their contribution to pro-
gress will also seem diffe-
rent. In the first hypothesis, 
this contribution will be 
conceived using the engi-
neer’s model: study a pro-
b lem,  determine the 
difficulties and devise a 
solution using the appro-
priate techniques: social 
order is considered as an 
objective datum, which only 
needs to be improved. On 
the contrary, in the second case 
the stress is placed on becoming 
aware: just the fact of judging an 
order bad or imperfect humanizes 
it, as the emergence of a criticism 
is already a change. 
What is therefore the common 
characteristic in research that is 
classified under the name of social 
sciences? They are all linked to 
society, and to the improvement 
of the knowledge of society; but 
not for the same reasons. 
Sometimes, they are  …

Contrary to what one might believe, the mathematization of social sciences is not at all 
accompanied by dehumanization, as Claude Lévi-Strauss declared in this archive document, 
dated 8 August 1956. Technological civilization is not a separate civilization. Humanization 
is based on all humans and all the sciences.

… problems whose characte-
ristics are so unique that one 
chooses to isolate them from the 
others, in order to solve them 
better: such is the case of law, 
political science and economic 
science. Sometimes, one intends 
to study phenomena common to 
all forms of social life, 
but by reaching them 
at a deeper level: this 
is the ambition shared 
by sociology and social 
psychology. Finally, one 
sometimes wants to 
include in the knowledge 
of humans types of acti-
vities that are very 
remote, in time or in 
space, and this research 
falls within the field of 
history and ethnology. 
Uniqueness, depth, 
remoteness: three forms 
of resistance of social 
facts, that the corres-
ponding disciplines 
attempt to overcome in 
parallel, but using dif-
ferent means. 
The three forms do 
not have the same 
basis; it is a fact that 
several centuries sepa-
rate us from the Middle 
Ages, and several thou-
sand kilometres from 
Melanesian societies; 
on the contrary, it is a 
convention that politi-
cal or economic systems 
are sufficiently isolated 
from the rest to justify separate 
disciplines. It has legitimately 
been possible to claim that this 
arbitrary division of social pheno-
mena leads to dehumanization, 
and in several ways.
Social sciences: 
a gratuitous 
manipulation of 
symbols?
One may first wonder if all social 
phenomena benefit from the same 
degree of reality, and if some of 
them (those that are being cove-
red here) are not an illusion, a 
sort of collective phantasmago-
ria. The problem is then to know 
if certain levels can be isolated, 
or if they do not depend on other 
levels with which they maintain 
dialectical relationships. Finally, 
science always postulates the 
coherence of its object; if the 
social sciences at issue are defi-
ned by reference to a pseudo-
object, do they not merely consist 
in a sort of game, a gratuitous 
manipulation of symbols? We 
would then be in the area of 
mystification, which is quite the 
contrary of humanization. 
And yet, mystification is 
al so a human operat ion. 
Whatever the degree of reality 
that we recognize in legal or 
political systems, and whatever 
the objective function they 
perform in the life of societies, 
these systems are productions 
of the mind. By studying their 
structures and the mechanism 
of their functioning, and by 
establishing their typology, we 
learn at least something, namely 
how the human spirit works to 
give a rational form (be it only 
in appearance) to what has 
none. On the condition that the 
corresponding sciences are 
really sciences (that is to say 
that they are carried out in true 
objectivity), the knowledge 
that they gather is humanising, 
for they allow humans to 
become aware of the real func-
tioning of society.
The case of economic science 
is especially significant, as, in 
its liberal form, it has been 
accused of manipulating abstrac-
tions. But in social sciences, as 
elsewhere, abstraction may be 
understood in two ways. Too 
often, it is used as pretext for an 
arbitrary division  …

losophical hypothesis of the 
unity of the human spirit, or 
more exactly, of the univer-
sal existence of a human 
nature is borne out. No 
matter from which angle it is 
approached, either individual 
or collective, in its expres-
sions that are apparently the 
least controlled, or perceived 
through traditional institu-
tions, we see that the human 
spirit obeys the same laws, 
always and everywhere.
The third wave
Ethnology and history put us 
in the presence of an evolution of 
the same type. It was long belie-
ved that history only aimed at 
exactly recreating the past. In 
fact, history, as well as ethno-
logy, studies societies that are 
different from those in which we 
live. They both seek to widen spe-
cific experience to the dimen-
sions of an experience that is 
general, or more general, which 
thus becomes more accessible to 
humans of another country or of 
another time. 
Like history, ethnology is the-
refore part of the humanist tradi-
tion. But its role is to create, for 
the first time, what might be 
called democratic humanism. After 
the aristocratic humanism of the 
Renaissance, founded only on the 
comparison of Greek and Roman 
societies (because no others were 
known) and the exotic humanism 
of the 19th century, which added 
to them the civilizations of the 
East and Far East (but only through 
written documents and figurative 
monuments), ethnology appears 
as the third wave –  …
symbolism that is in fact the same 
one as that that used by social 
psychologists and linguists, to 
the extent that language and 
social stereotypes are also based 
on subconscious activities of the 
mind. 
It is worth focusing on this 
convergence of social sciences for 
a moment. Our sciences f irst 
became isolated in order to 
become deeper, but at a certain 
depth, they succeed in joining 
each other. Thus, little by little, 
in an objective area, the old phi-
… of concrete rea-
lity. Economic science 
has been a victim of 
this error in the past. 
On the other hand, the 
recent at tempts to 
apply modern mathema-
tics (called “qualita-
t ive”) to economic 
theory, have led to a 
remarkable result: the 
more the theory became 
mathematic and there-
fore – seemingly – abs-
tract, the more it 
implied historical and 
concrete objects at the 
outset, as the substance 
of its formalism. No form of eco-
nomic bourgeois thought is closer 
to Marxist conceptions than the 
highly mathematic treatment pre-
sented by von Neumann and 
Morgenstern in 1944 in the Theory 
of Games and Economic Behaviour: 
for them, the theory is applied to 
a society divided into rival groups 
and between which antagonisms 
or coalitions are created. Contrary 
to what one might believe, the 
mathematization of social scien-
ces is not at all accompanied by 
dehumanization. It corresponds to 
the fact that inside each disci-
pline, theory tends to become 
more and more general. In mathe-
matical expression, economic 
science, sociology and psychology 
discover a common language. And 
it may be very rapidly seen that 
this common language is possible, 
because the objects to which it is 
applied are, in reality, identical. 
The same “humanist” connec-
tion occurs in psychology and 
sociology. Thus, by studying the 
mechanisms of subconscious life, 
psychoanalysts make use of a

With the risk of belying the title 
of this lecture, it is therefore not 
by declaring themselves social and 
isolating themselves from the rest 
that our  disciplines will be able to 
humanize civilization, but by quite 
simply attempting to become more 
scientific. Technological civiliza-
tion is not a separate civilization, 
which requires the invention of 
… no doubt the last – 
because, of all social sciences, 
it is the most characteristic of 
the finite world that our planet 
has become in the 20th cen-
tury. Ethnology appeals to all 
human societies, in order to 
draw up a global knowledge of 
humans; and, even better, the 
distinctive characteristics of 
these “residual” societies have 
led it to create new types of 
knowledge, which, as we are 
gradually realizing, can profita-
bly be applied to the study of 
all civilizations, including ours. 
It operates simultaneously on the 
surface and in depth.
Technological 
civilization is not a 
separate civilization
In the absence of written 
texts and figurative monu-
ment s,  these ways of 
knowledge are both more 
external and more internal 
(one might also say coarser 
and finer) than those of the 
other social sciences: on the 
one hand, study from the 
outside (physical anthropo-
logy, prehistory, technology), 
on the other hand, study 
from the inside (identifica-
tion of ethnology with the 
group whose existence it 
shares). Always below and 
beyond social sciences, eth-
nology can neither be disso-
ciated from natural sciences 
nor from human sciences. Its 
originality consists in the 
union of the methods of 
both, at the service of a generali-
zed knowledge of humans, that is 
to say anthropology.

special techniques for its improve-
ment: the humanization of social 
life is not the task of one profes-
sion. It depends on all humans and 
on all sciences. 
Humanizing technological civili-
zation is, first, to 
put it into perspec-
tive in the global 
history of huma-
nity, and then to 
analyse and unders-
tand the driving 
forces of its advent 
and functioning. 
In every case, as a 
result: to know. 
The contribution of 
our sciences will 
be evaluated, not 
us ing dubious 
methods that are 
subject to the 
whims of the day, 
but according to 
the new perspecti-
ves that they will 
be able to open to 
humanity, so that 
it may better understand its own 
nature and its history, and there-
fore also judge it. 
