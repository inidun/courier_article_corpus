encourage violence and revenge as solu-
tions to problems,experts say.
M o r e ove r , child rights activists contend
that corporal punishment goes against the
1989 United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child, which affirms the chil-
d ’s need for care and protection. A rticle 19
of the convention, which has been ratified
by 191 countries including Kenya , s p e c i-
fies that states must take appropriate mea-
sures to protect children from “all forms of
p hysical or mental violence, i n j u ry or abu s e ,
neglect or negligent treat m e n t , m a l t r e at-
ment or exploitation.”
The HRW report , based on a fie l d
study, including scores of interviews with
s t u d e n t s , t e a c h e rs , parents and offic i a l s ,
says that Kenyan children are often puni-
shed for petty offences like coming late to
school or wearing a torn uniform.
The problem has dire implications for
basic education.A recent study shows that
the enrolment rate in pri m a ry schools is
fast declining and only 42 per cent of those
enrolled in  first grade complete the pri-
mary school cycle.The decline is, among
other reasons,due to poverty and a hostile
learning environment,say analysts.
“Some students told us that they drop-
ped out of school because of severe beat i n g
by their teachers.This is in clear violation of
children’s right to education,” says Thon-
den.
“So far no teacher has been convicted
for these deat h s ,” s ays Jemimah Mwa k i s h a ,
a journalist who has written extensively on
the subject in Kenya’s leading newspaper

When Justus Omanga, a fourth gr a d e
student at Mobamba Secondary
School in Kenya ’s Kisii distri c t ,r e p e a-
tedly denied allegations that he had brought
a girl into the school compound one night
last A u g u s t , his teachers became furi o u s.
Four of the teachers kicked, hit and beat
Omanga so hard with a huge stick that the
b oy fell unconscious.A month later he died
in hospital as a result of severe damage to
his kidneys and other internal injuri e s ,
according to family members.
O m a n g a ’s case is not isolat e d . A c c o r-
ding to the Kenyan media corporal punish-
ment has led to the deaths of at least six
students in the last four ye a rs.While caning
is a regular feature in schools, some stu-
dents have suffered serious injuries which
include “ b ruises and cuts, broken bones,
knocked-out teeth and internal bleeding,”
s ays a recent report from the New Yo r k -
based non-gove rnmental organizat i o n
Human Rights Watch (HRW) titled Spare
the Child: C o rp o ral Punishment in Kenya n
Schools.
An incentive to violence
and revenge
K e nya is not the only country in the
world that still practises corporal punish-
m e n t .I n d e e d , only 70 countri e s ,b e gi n n i n g
with Sweden in 1979, h ave banned the
p r a c t i c e . But experts say Kenya is one of
the worst offenders when it comes to vio-
lence stemming from corporal punishment.
“In Kenya corporal punishment against
children in schools has reached dange-
rously high levels,” says Yodon Thonden, a
Tibetan-American who led the five-mem-
ber research team which prepared the
HRW report.
A p a rt from the brutality which is often,
in Kenya at least,associated with the prac-

resentment and low-self esteem. It can also

SAVE THE CHIL D

The widespread use of corporal punishment in Kenyan schools has led to increasing dropout
rates and in a few cases, to death
Daily Nation.
Neither are teachers commonly sen-
tenced for inflicting serious injuri e s. V i c-
tims often come from rural areas, w h e r e
people don’t have the finances to hire a
l aw yer and where legal aid is poor. In some
instances where teachers have been taken to
c o u rt , they have gone unpunished, as it has
been difficult to prove a motive in the killing
as required under the criminal law, Mwa-
kisha says.
Parents scared
to speak out
E x c e s s i vely harsh corporal punishment
tends to be particularly common in the
countryside.“In rural areas,parents don’t
f o rmally object to their children being bea-
ten for fear they [the children] might be
victimized further,” says Mwakisha.
In public, K e nyan education ministry
o f ficials have strongly denied the HRW alle-
g at i o n s ,s t ating that some isolated incidents
in rural schools have been exaggerat e d .
H owe ve r , in pri vat e , a senior educat i o n
ministry official admits that the report was
“more or less corr e c t .” He says teachers
“ b rutally beat children in many schools
without any proper reason.This is a prac-
tice that can only be stopped by abolishing
corporal punishment altogether.”
Nevertheless the recent deaths and the
r e p o rt have triggered a debate in Kenya on
banning corporal punishment, as other
A f rican countries including Namibia, B u r-
kina Faso, South Africa and Ethiopia have
done in recent years.
According to government regulations,
c o rporal punishment may be inflicted only
in cases of continued or gr ave neglect of
work, lying, bullying and gross insubordi-
nation.The beating, with a cane no more
than half an inch thick, can be gi ven only by
or in the presence of a head teacher. Regu-
lations state that boys should be hit on the
backside and girls on the palm of the hand.
Students are not supposed to get more than
six strokes as punishment and a wri t t e n
‘Some students told us that
they dropped out of school
b e cause of severe beating by
their teachers. This is in clear
violation of children’s right to
e d u ca t i o n ’

record of all the proceedings should be
kept.
“The rules are hardly followe d . Te a-
c h e rs use clubs, bamboo canes, s o m e t i m e s
even a rubber whip to beat the students,”
says Thonden.
For many teachers, a tool to cope
with big classes
A strong constituency of Kenyan tea-
c h e rs is in favour of retaining corp o r a l
p u n i s h m e n t , e ven though they concede
more restrictions are required. A few ye a rs
ago when the Director of Education tried to
make the practice illegal, the teachers ’u n i o n
said it would not recognize such a ban.
Many teachers argue that without cor-
poral punishment the schools would des-
cend into chaos and that children wo u l d
become even more unruly by the time they
reached high school. In fa c t , they believe
that in the long run corporal punishment
means less rather than more violence.
“ We s t e rn countries gi ve excessive freedom
to their children. Look at the violent inci-
dents in many schools in the United
S t at e s ,” s ays Lawrence Kahindi Majali,
Assistant Secretary General of the Kenya
punishment by citing Kenya ’s long tradi-
t i o n . “When we were under British ru l e ,
those who refused to pay taxes or those who
did not obey the rules were caned in public.
The use of the cane was a symbol of autho-
rity and the legacy continues,” s ays Majali.
M a ny teachers admit that they often
c a rry out corporal punishment without the
presence of the headmaster. In violation of
the rules,the students are sometimes bea-
ten all over the body, and often records of
c o rporal punishment are not kept in
schools.
Stephen P, a fifth grade student in Moi
p ri m a ry school in Nairobi, s ays teachers
cane him or slap him regularly. His offences
include coming late to school and not
p aying school fees on time. Elizabeth Z,
who is in the fourth standard, s ays teachers
slap her and pinch her on the cheeks for
not doing homework.
“My children were not treated well by
the teachers after I complained about
caning by their class teacher,” s ays Deborah
N,a mother of two living in Nairobi.
Teachers are also afraid.They quote a
growing number of instances in which tea-
c h e rs have been attacked by students. I n
National Union of Teachers (KNUT).
M a ny Kenyan teachers also contend
that corporal punishment is one of the few
d i s c i p l i n a ry tools available gi ven large class
s i z e s. According to a gove rnment report
there are 5,718,700 students and 192,000
t e a c h e rs at pri m a ry school leve l , giving a
teacher-pupil ratio of 1:31. In many schools
classes of 50-60 students are common.
The burden is heaviest in rural areas
where retired and transferred teachers ’
posts are often left va c a n t . As a result,
a u t h o rities frequently combine two or three
schools in a regi o n , putting additional pres-
sure on the existing teaching staff.
Te a c h e rs also try to justify corp o r a l

“The best method of teaching mathematics?” A cartoon published in Daily Nation, a leading Kenya newspaper.
‘When we were under British
rule, those who refused to pay
taxes or those who did not

a symbol of authority and the
l e g a cy continues’

one extreme case,a class prefect was killed
by students in the town of Nye ri , near Nai-
r o b i , early this year for being too strict with
them.
The fact that corporal punishment
leads so often to brutality may be sympto-
m atic of the pressures facing the whole tea-
ching profession. Te a c h e rs ’ s a l a ri e s — r a n-
ging from 4,000 Kenyan shillings ($60) to
about 15,000 ($200) a month—are among
the lowest in the civil serv i c e .Te a c h e rs seem
to take their frustrations out on their stu-
d e n t s , s ay expert s. “ L ow salaries reduce
teacher morale, and many of the lowe s t -
paid teachers are forced to find housing in
slum areas,” says the HRW report.
Mounting tension
E d u c ation ministry officials say gui-
dance counsellors in secondary schools
encourage teachers to adopt methods to
deal with depressed or problem students
and thus avoid tensions leading to corp o r a l
punishment.
The counsellor discusses with the
concerned student why he or she commit-
ted an offence and tries to find solutions.
But officials admit that there are not
enough counsellors in schools due to fin a n-
cial constraints and even those who have
been posted as counsellors undertake other
responsibilities due to shortage of staff.
Te a c h e rs in favour of reducing corp o r a l
punishment feel that the best place for
introducing altern at i ve disciplinary
methods is the Teacher Training Pro-
gr a m m e s. At present teachers say that they
hardly spend more than four to five hours
on classroom management during their ini-
tial two - year training period for pri m a ry
school.
Realizing the gr avity of the problem,
m a ny non-gove rnmental organizat i o n s
h ave now joined the campaign to abolish
c o rporal punishment and have started wo r-
king with teachers to minimize its use until
the law is changed.
“Until a legal sanction is obtained, we
decided it would be better to work with the
teachers,” says Jacqueline Anam-Mogeni,
child rights adviser at the Netherlands
Development Organization (NDO).
The Nairobi-based NDO organizes
workshops and training programmes to
help teachers to get to grips with their pro-
blems and encourage them to use counsel-
ling methods and other forms of punish-
ment,such as manual work.
Alternative
solutions
NDO selects a group of teachers and
vo l u n t e e rs from other non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations from a particular regi o n
where corporal punishment incidents are
h i g h , and organizes workshops exposing
them to human rights and child ri g h t s
issues.After a week’s training, the teachers
go back to their schools and return for eva-
luation every three months.
“We first ask the participants how they
t r e at their own children at home. Once they
realize there is a problem they themselves
come up with altern at i ve solutions,” s ay s
Mogeni.
The first session attracted 24 part i c i-
pants from different parts of Kenya.Some
t e a c h e rs say their attitude towards children
has changed after part i c i p ating in the
course.
“Before I went for the child rights trai-
n i n g, I always viewed the punishment as
p a rt of the learning process. N ow I wo r k
with the pupils almost at a level of part-
n e rs h i p,” s ays Esther Nyakio Ngugi , a tea-
cher at Kiri giti Girls A p p r oved school in
K i a m bu .
Teachers who participated in the pro-
gramme say they have realized that they
were basically driving away students from
schools due to constant beatings.
“This is only a begi n n i n g . We need
more gove rnment and public support till
we finally abolish corporal punishment,”
says Mogeni. ■

‘Before I went for the child
rights training, I always 
v i ewed the punishment 
as part of the learning process.
Now I work with the pupils
