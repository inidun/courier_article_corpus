He built an empire on the sands of some of the
wo r l d ’s most beautiful beaches by wheeling
and dealing with kings and presidents. H e
made a fortune by selling a sun-splashed brand of
hedonism with the trademark bikini-clad couple fro-
licking along a lick of white sand. Meet Gilbert Tri-
g a n o,one of the two men responsible for starting the
wo r l d ’s most famous network of resort s , the Club
M e d i t é rranée—better known as the Club Med.
At the age of 78,Tri g a n o ’s club-days are over bu t
he has found a new role as a consultant to govern-
ment officials on the tourism industry, which may
send shivers up the spines of those devoted to the
new school of cultural tourism. Club Med’s hall-
mark lazy get-away in which visitors need not
exchange money, let alone venture to a local res-
t a u r a n t , is often cast as the dark side of the industry.
“It’s become a sin just to use the expression ‘mass
t o u ri s m ’ ,” s ays Tri g a n o, “ but that ’s what we are
faced with. Should we be nostalgic and try to return
to the past when people didn’t travel in groups or
should we try to better control the flows?”
The spirit of the times
I r o n i c a l l y,Trigano cannot help but hark back to
Club Med’s early days in the 1950s, when the
r e s o rts consisted of tented camps on pristine beaches
of the Mediterr a n e a n . “The real success of the club
m ay not have been in the quality of the services bu t
in the way it represented the spirit of the times.We
[ Trigano and his business partner Gérard Blitz]
were young men, survivors of the war.We made a
profession out of offering others what we wanted for
ourselves: a chance to discover the sea, to breathe
deeply and live healthily. There was an incredible
desire to discover new things in life and new people.”
Trigano maintains that the same trends are
intensifying today.Yet there is a hollow ring to his talk
about discove ring other cultures.The clubs are and
have always been removed from surrounding life.
The flash of these pleasure domes often seems
indecent in poor countries. “It is very easy to criti-
cize along these lines,” s ays a visibly aggr avat e d
Tri g a n o, but the bottom line is that tourism bri n g s
much-needed money and jobs.
“Besides do you really think that anyone can
u n d e rstand the culture of a country like Mauri-
tius after visiting for eight or 15 day s ,” s ays Tri g a n o.
“ People at the club basked in the sun of Spain.
They tasted the tomatoes of Tunisia and the gri l l e d
mutton of the Berbers in Morocco. They didn’t
discover these countries but they did get a taste of
them.”
According to Tri g a n o, it would be irr e s p o n s i b l e
for the club to dive any deeper into local culture.“ I n
Indonesia,I used to pay actors to stage traditional
m a rriages because I was furious that people wa n t e d
to penetrate Buddhist temples to see a ceremony.
This would have been totally inappropriate.”
Trigano has just returned from Pa l e s t i n e ,
enchanted by the cultural heri t a g e . Yet he is
also concerned,explaining that the impending
recognition of the formal state of Palestine will
unleash a wave of tourists. “Now is the time to
a c t ,” s ays Tri g a n o. “It would be a bit far-fetched for
me to play the role of the moralist”and tell the Pa l e s-
tinians what to do, he say s. “It is a lot more plausible
for me to offer my experience as to how a ‘good idea’
can get out of hand.”
“My role used to be to look for isolated sites of
exceptional beauty,” s ays Tri g a n o, and then deve l o p
them by brokering deals with the gove rnment to
b ring electri c i t y, d rinking water and even small air-
p o rt s. “It is possible to discover and develop a
site without destroying it,” he insists. But what of
places like Cancún in Mexico, the Moroccan beach
r e s o rt of A g a d i r , or Tu n i s i a ’s Isle of Je r b a . In all
three cases, Club Med was the first to lay the
f o u n d ations for the tourism industry. I n d e e d ,w i t h
a certain pri d e , Trigano explains that when he
and his team arri ved over 30 ye a rs ago, “ t h e r e
was nothing.”Yet he is also the first to admit that
“they are now concrete horr o rs.” Was this
inevitable? “Not entirely,” he say s. For Tri-
g a n o, the error lies not in developing a site
but in ove r d e veloping it—and to avoid this,
“ a u t h o rities must have the courage to issue
l aw s ” to regulate the industry ’s gr ow t h . “ I ’ m
not ashamed of anything I have bu i l t ,” s ay s
Tri g a n o. As for the others. . . . nw UNESCO Courier journalist
