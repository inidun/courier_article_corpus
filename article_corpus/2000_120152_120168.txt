A recipe for kwaito
Let’s begin with the basic ingredients: South African
disco music, hip-hop, rhythm & blues, reggae and a
mega-dose of American and British house music.Mix it
all up,add loads of local spice and attitude and you’ve got
kwaito. Mostly, but not always, the lyrics are chanted or
rapped—not sung—over a slowed-down bass heavy,
electronically programmed beat.
As pioneering DJs like Oscar “Warona” Mdlongwa,
e x p l a i n , in the late 80s,“we started remixing international
house tracks to give them a local feeling.We added a bit
of piano, slowing the tempo down and putting in per-
cussion and African melodies”.
“ Lyrically we were inspired by people like Brenda Fa s s i e
and Chicco Twa l a ,” says another founding father, A r t h u r
M a f o k a t e. Brenda and Chicco were the rising stars of the
older “ B u b b l e g u m ” disco music.“ They were representing
us and talking about what was happening in the ghettos, a n d
they spoke in a mixture of English, Z u l u , Sesotho and
Iscamtho (slang).”
Kwaito is steeped in the ghetto, often reeking with a
roughneck attitude. But don’t be fooled into thinking
that these stars are cheap imitations of U. S. gangsta rap-
p e r s.These musicians are far too street-wise to glorify vio-
lence in crime-ridden South A f r i c a . Nor is there a need to
i n flame race relations after the victory over apartheid. Fo r
today’s youth,the struggle lies in securing a better eco-
nomic life.
In fact,kwaito producers were the first in the country
to launch their own black-owned record labels.The major
companies are now trying to cut in on the scene with their
own kwaito rosters but most of the big names are sitting
tight with the original labels. The genre is a major money-
s p i n n e r, with leading groups like Bongo Maffin , TKZee and
Boom Shaka releasing albums that clock over 50,000 in
s a l e s. If there’s a sound that represents young South
Africa right now, it’s kwaito. M.M. ■
