Shooting on a shoestring
Young Japanese producers are stretching tight budgets to produce a wave of often dark
films while the big studios, fattened by prosperity, are falling on hard times

The tiny bar in To k y o ’s Shinjuku district has
barely changed over the past 50 years. I t s
owner keeps a careful eye on the rows of
whisky bottles that line the ancient dive’s
w a l l s, each bottle bearing the name of a
filmmaker from somewhere across the world.E v e r y
time one of these illustrious guests passes through
To k y o, they find their private bottle waiting, i n t a c t .
For Masaki Ta m u r a , a famous director of photo-
graphy who worked with the big names in documen-
tary and fiction films in the 1970s and 1980s, the bar is
a favourite hangout when taking a break between
two shoots.One day in the early 1990s,h o w e v e r, in the
middle of a shoot with a famous director, Ta m u r a ’s
patience with movie-making finally broke.“I was sick
of the old methods. The approach was too conven-
t i o n a l . I wanted to give up film and I didn’t work for
the next three years. I thought it was all over for me.”
That is until he met Shinji Aoyama and did
camera work for his first fil m , H e l p l e s s. “During the
s h o o t , everybody knew how to do everyone else’s
j o b,” he says.“ You had to because the budget was so
s m a l l . It was a miracle how we managed to make a
three-hour film in cinemascope with so little money.”
At 61,with a moustache,shock of grey hair, s e n s i-
tive face and calm voice of a character from a Ya s u j i r o
Ozu fil m ,Tomura describes his new career as a conver-
s i o n . “At fir s t , I didn’t understand the film language
these young people used. The way they worked was
new to me. Ideas come from all sides. Everyone has

something to say and we discuss everything together.
But I got used to it and now I speak that language.”Fo r
the past five years,Tamura has been working exclusi-
vely with this young generation,whose creative energy
has given new life to Ja p a n ’s battered film industry.
These filmmakers are all between 20 and 40 years
o l d , and produce their films with extremely limited
resources in the world’s most expensive city. Some of
them have worked in television, advertising or car-
t o o n s, and hold down several jobs to make ends
m e e t . They tend to focus on social and psycholo-
gical themes, like delinquency and mindless crime,
which mirror the confusion and malaise of a gene-
ration that has rejected the old ambitions of getting
r i c h , blind loyalty to one’s employer and social har-
m o n y.
Without access to major distribution networks,
they make do in a ghetto of art cinemas where com-
petition is fie r c e : this new genre can never earn much
m o n e y. Financing the productions is also a night-
m a r e,with budgets ranging from $100,000 to a million
d o l l a r s.Most do not even have an inter-negative ver-
sion (from which copies can be made without dama-
ging the master)—a common sacrifice made by
makers of short films elsewhere.
“I often have to go into debt to get the fil m
s t a r t e d ,”says Shinya T s u k a m o t o.“ You start shooting
with the crew working for nothing and hoping to
get paid later.Then I show the rushes to video editors
to try to get them to invest in the fil m .” Making fan-
tasy films in the tradition of the Frenchman Georges
M é l i è s, Tsukamoto is a director, c a m e r a m a n , s e t -
d e s i g n e r, actor and producer all rolled into one.
At 40, he has made six films independently and
another two for the big studios. It took eight months
to make Bullet Ballet, his seventh and second-to-last
fil m , whose street scenes were largely shot clandes-
t i n e l y. Like his first fil m s, Te t s u o and To kyo First,
Bullet Ballet conveys the vibrant energy of its director,
who depicts the fragile equilibrium of young people
living on the brink of disaster, in a culture of violence
from which there is no return.
Just as in the 1970s, when major studios such as
Nikkatsu switched to B movies and the soft porn
works on which many filmmakers cut their teeth,
t o d a y ’s producers have made erotic films (p i n k u
e i g a) and gangster films on budgets even smaller
than their elders.These video or 16mm productions
are targetted directly at the video market.
Kiyoshi Kurosawa continues to make film noir
on 16mm for video,though he infuses his creations with
a surprisingly philosophical dimension.The two major
works of the Revenge II s e r i e s,Eyes of the Spider a n d
Serpent Pa t h ( 1 9 9 8 ) ,were shot one after the other,e a c h
in two weeks, with the same crew and
the same actors. The same plot of
r e v e n g e,h o w e v e r, is handled very dif-
ferently in the two cases.“I don’t mind
shooting like this,” he says.“In fact it’s
a luxury to be able to make two ver-
sions of the same story.”Takashi Miike,
king of gangster gore fil m s,a g r e e s.
Takeshi Kitano,big brother to this
new generation of fil m m a k e r s, s t a r t e d
out in a similar fashion.It was too hard
being an actor and producer at the same
t i m e, so he went behind the camera.
Today his company Office Kitano turns out a steady
stream of independent fil m s,though he makes most of
his money by selling to television.
Never before has a “new wave” in Ja p a n e s e
cinema made such a virtue out of necessity.The cur-
rent generation has set up its own makeshift net-
work with a freedom unprecedented in the history of
the nation’s film industry.The French “new wave”o f
the 1960s had little choice but to depend heavily on
big studio money. So long as the films drew the

bosses always found a way of wor-
king together.
But falling attendance rates
combined with an economic down-
turn has dealt a sharp blow to the
Japanese industry. The major dis-
t r i b u t o r s — To h o, Toei and Sho-
chiko—have brushed aside the
newcomers and made money by
filling their cinemas with foreign
films (70 per cent of total revenue),
animation (about 20 such films were
made in 1999) or their own pro-
d u c t i o n s.
As a result, the “new wave” o f
the 1990s had to set up shop,p h y s i-
cally and fig u r a t i v e l y, in a country
where training had long been the
preserve of big studios. New fil m
and video schools are springing up
like Eiga Bi Gakko, which was
founded two years ago by pro-
ducer Kenzo Horikoshi. C l a s s e s
are often taught by young direc-
tors, who submit film proposals as
part of the school programme to
produce two films each year.Aki-
hiko Shiota made a couple of
erotic films before his remarkable
Moonlight W h i s p e r s in 1999,w h i c h
follows three children growing up
in a city suburb and cost less than
$200,000.
“ The films are made without any thought of the
big studio network,” says Hirokazu Ko r e - E d a ,w h o
directed Wonderful Life. Because they owe favours
to no-one, the young directors are totally free to
e x p e r i m e n t .For Wonderful Life,Ko r e - E d a ,who was
trained in documentary production,sent his assistants
out on a five-month mission to capture on video
“the best memories” of about 500 elderly people.
He looked at the rushes, did the casting and then
contacted those he had chosen to appear in the fil m .

which last over five minutes.H story,his third fil m ,i s

As for A o y a m a , his feature film E u r e k a d e a l s
with a recurrent theme in 1990s Japanese cinema—
that of a new life, a transition to an alternative state
of existence following a traumatic experience. I t
shows three people, a man and two children, w h o
have escaped from a bloody hostage-taking episode
and struggle throughout the film to find their way out
of a maze of misfortune.
New outfits upstage 
the big studios
The technical, stylistic and narrative maturity of
E u r e k a,made in black and white cinemascope,s t a n d s
out among other independent films which,despite all
their energy,sometimes seem laborious productions
overly concerned with navel-gazing and experi-
m e n t a t i o n . It is perhaps no accident that the fil m
was one of the first produced by Suncent Cinema
Wo r k s, the new company of Takenori Sentoh.The 38-
y e a r-old producer is seen by many as a pioneer of new
Japanese cinema. In 1992, he joined the pay-TV
channel Wowow and gave several beginners their
first break, including Aoyama for H e l p l e s s. S i n c e
t h e n , Sentoh has produced more than 35 films for
Wowow and others companies, including some fes-
tival favourites of recent years. In 1999, he set up
his own production company, S u n c e n t .
Distribution is still very difficult in Ja p a n , b u t
S e n t o h ’s success abroad and Kitano’s commercial
breakthrough have encouraged other centres of
independent film production, i n c l u d i n g, i r o n i c a l l y,
the former major distributors Daiei and Nikkatsu.
Some previously occasional partners of the new
Japanese cinema (video editors, advertising agen-
cies and radio and television stations) are now more
involved in co-production, while countless multi-
media firms (Little More, Uplink and Gaga, f o r
example) are encouraging alternative productions.
Meanwhile the disintegration of the big-studio
system is gathering pace.An almost-bankrupt Sho-
chiku has sold its studios at Ofuna, near To k y o.
“ This reminds me of the g e k o k u j o,”says the head of
a film school, referring to 15th and 16th century
feudal Japan when the serfs took the place of the
g e n t r y.Sentoh for his part has started hiring banking
executives and others totally alien to the film
industry on the condition that they are true fil m
f a n a t i c s.He has always wondered,he says,“if anyone
in the mainstream Japanese movie industry even
likes cinema.” ■
