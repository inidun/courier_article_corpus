N G O s : gladiators of freedom
Working on the ground and in international campaigns, NGOs have managed to shed a glimmer of
hope on the lives of hundreds of thousands of child slaves
CHILDREN IN CHAINS
t five in the morning, well before most
children get up to go to school,12-year-
old Abula sets out on a six-kilometre
barefoot trek along a road made of mud
and stone to work on a coffee plantation
in Bouafle, Côte d’Ivoire.
When he gets there, wet and tired,
the foreman tells him where he is to plant
that day.“ You have to work fast because
they threaten to punish and starve us if we
d o n ’t do the set amount of work,” he says.
“If we can’t work because we’re ill, we
risk being physi-
cally tortured.O n e
day I saw them tor-
ture two friends of
mine who wanted
to escape. Both of
them ended up
dead.”
Abu la wa s
rescued by A n t i -
Slavery Interna-
t i o n a l , which was
founded in Lon-
don in 1839 and
proclaims itself
t h e w o r l d ’s oldest
NGO.
Alo ng  w i th
other international
o r g a n i z a t i o n s, s u c h
a s t h e I L O ,
UNICEF and the
European Union, NGOs have grown
much more effective in their fight against
child slavery and gone beyond simply
trying to make governments and inter-
national bodies aware of its most extreme
e x p r e s s i o n .Their most valuable work lies
in rescuing and rehabilitating dozens of
children suffering the cruellest forms of
exploitation.
These NGOs work though close coor-
dination between North and South.Th o s e
in the South gather evidence and testi-
m o n i e s,while those in the North publicize
the issue and help organize international
c a m p a i g n s, the most striking of which
was the Global March Against Child
Labour in 1998,when groups set out from
A s i a , Latin America and Africa to
assemble outside the ILO’s headquar-
ters in Geneva and denounce all exploita-
tion of the world’s children.
Anti-Slavery International is now
pressing governments and political
leaders to make the fight against child
workers part of their political pro-
g r a m m e s. It maintains permanent con-
tact with NGOs in the South and funds
projects there to investigate the situation
of child workers.
One such NGO is the Bangkok-
based Child Workers in Asia (CWA ) ,
which recently highlighted the case of a
child who was being atrociously
e x p l o i t e d . Like Abula in A f r i c a ,1 4 - y e a r-
old Devi Lina Sari also rose before dawn
to go to her job on a sugar plantation in
Medan, Indonesia. “I set out at 6 a.m.
every day except Sunday,” she says. “I
start work at seven and finish at four in
the afternoon, with an hour’s break at
midday.”
Like all children of her age, s h e ’d like
to play with her friends,but after cutting
s u g a r-cane for eight hours she is too
exhausted to do anything but rest.“If I
cut myself with the machete, the boss
pays for medicine but I have to reim-
burse him. If I’m ill and can’t work, I
don’t get paid.”
When CWA identifies a child worker
being exploited,one of its officials goes
with a policeman and a social worker to
rescue the child and return him or her to
the parents (if the child has been taken
away by force),or else hand him or her
over to a rehabilitation centre or volun-
teer family if the youth has been sold as
a slave.Children who have had the trau-
matic experience of slavery are rehabil-
itated over a period of three to six
months.
The worst kind of child exploitation is
s e x u a l . M a r i a , a
1 2-y e a r-old Hon-
duran girl, w a s
kidnapped in her
c o u n t r y, sold in
Guatemala and
taken from there
to Mexico, w h e r e
she was bought by
the owner of a bar
who forced her to
become a prosti-
t u t e, servicing 20
men a day.
This tragic case
was discovered
b y Casa A l i a n z a ,
founded in Gua-
temala in 1981 and
now the Latin
American branch
of Covenant House,
a New York-based NGO. Casa Alianza
started out by rehabilitating street chil-
dren in Central A m e r i c a , but for the past
four years it has focused on exposing the
sexual and commercial trafficking and
exploitation of children,which includes
p o r n o g r a p h y, sexual tourism and child
prostitution.
This is a massive task, but it has
already proved effective: Costa Rica’s
special judge dealing with sex crimes
acknowledges that two-thirds of the cases
coming before him have been raised by
Casa Alianza. ■
