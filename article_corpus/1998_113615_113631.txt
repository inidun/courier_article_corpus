Even die-hard optimists would not have believe d
it possible when a handful of non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGOs) came together in 1992
to take landmines out of the wo r l d ’s ars e n a l s. B e c a u s e
the lowly landmine has been in widespread use by
most fighting forces in the world throughout this
c e n t u ry, the possibility of banning the weapon looked
far from achieva b l e .H owe ve r , the situation changed
d r a m atically in five ye a rs. “The campaign started a
process which in the
space of a few ye a rs
changed a ban on
a n t i p e rsonnel mines
from a vision to a feasible
r e a l i t y,” explained the
committee awarding the
1997 Nobel Prize for
Peace to the
I n t e rn ational Campaign
to Ban Landmines
( I C B L ) .
The ICBL made
wishful thinking a reality when 121 gove rn m e n t s
came to Ottawa,Canada in December 1997 to sign
the Mine Ban Tr e aty (MBT).The numbers continue
to gr ow as does the momentum towards a total
e l i m i n ation of landmines. The Nobel Committee
concluded that “as a model for similar processes in the
f u t u r e , the campaign could prove of decisive
i m p o rtance to the intern ational effort for disarm a m e n t
and peace.”
In the late 1980s and early 1990s,NGOs began to
s e riously think about trying to deal with a global
h u m a n i t a rian crisis—the tens of millions of landmines
claiming hundreds of lives eve ry year all over the wo r l d .
It became ve ry clear that to eliminate the problem, i t
would be necessary to eliminate the weapon—to ban
the production and use of landmines.
In October 1992,Handicap Intern at i o n a l ,H u m a n
Rights Wat c h ,Medico Intern at i o n a l ,Mines A d v i s o ry
Group, Physicians for Human Rights and Vietnam
Veterans of America Foundation formally launched
the ICBL with a “joint call to ban antipers o n n e l
landmines.”These organizations,which became the
s t e e ring committee of the ICBL, called for an end to
the use,production,trade and stockpiling of mines.
The call also pressed gove rnments to increase
resources for humanitarian mine clearance and for
victim assistance.
The intern ational campaign has become an
unprecedented coalition of over 1,000 organizat i o n s
working together in 60 countries to achieve a ban.
And as the campaign grew, the steering committee
expanded to represent its diversity.The Afghan and
Cambodian campaigns and Radda Barnen we r e
added in 1996; the South A f rican campaign and
K e nya Coalition in 1997; and the A s s o c i ation to A i d
R e f u g e e s , Ja p a n , Lutheran World Fe d e r at i o n , t h e
Colombia Campaign Against Landmines, I n t e r
A f rican Union of Human Rights and Norwe gi a n
People’s Aid joined early this year.
The core strength of the campaign, has alway s
been its loose stru c t u r e .There has never been a central
s e c r e t a ri at or headquart e rs.There has never been an
ove rr e a c h i n g, bu r e a u c r atic stru c t u r e . ICBL members
a lways meet regularly to plot out overall strat e gi e s
and plan joint actions,but beyond that each NGO and
each national campaign is free to develop its ow n
work best suited to its mandat e , culture and
circumstances.
The overall strategy of the intern ational campaign
has always been to press for nat i o n a l , r e gional and
i n t e rn ational measures to ban landmines. Initially an
attempt was made to persuade the nations to review
the 1980 Convention on Conventional We a p o n s
( C C W ) , which attempted to control the use of
a n t i p e rsonnel mines and to ban the weapon by
amending the conve n t i o n . While the revised CCW
did not ban them, pressure by the ICBL made many
governments take the issue seriously.
D u ring the last phase of the CCW review, t h e
campaign called on individual gove rnments to come
together in a pro-ban gr o u p. A series of meetings
b e t ween pro-ban gove rnments and the ICBL was held
in Geneva during the final sessions of the review
c o n f e r e n c e . After the conference in May 1996, t h e
Canadian gove rnment offered to host a gove rn m e n t a l
meeting in October.The hectic negotiations in the
subsequent months paved the way for the histori c
December 1997 meeting in Ottawa for the Mine Ban
Tr e at y.
At the time of wri t i n g, t wenty-eight stat e s — m o r e
than half the number necessary for entry into force—
h ave deposited their instruments of rat i fic ation at the
United Nat i o n s. Six other gove rnments have fin a l i z e d
and just have to deposit the ratification.
The ICBL,and its part n e rship with gove rn m e n t s ,
has launched a truly remarkable and historic process.
It has clearly demonstrated that civil society and
g ove rnments do not have to see themselves as
a d ve rs a ri e s. It also shows that small and middle powe rs
can work together with civil society and address
humanitarian concerns with breathtaking speed. n
