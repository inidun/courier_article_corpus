When Hurricane Mitch hit Tegucigalpa, the
capital of Honduras, in the evening of 28
October 1998, the first thing Carlos, M a u ri c i o
and Jaime did was to persuade families in the Nueva
S u yapa neighbourhood to quit their corru g at e d
iron and brick shacks.
As the rain fell in torrents they took the stri c k e n
s l u m - d we l l e rs to improvised shelters in schools and
c h u r c h e s.Then the three volunteer wo r k e rs with AT D
Fo u rth Wo r l d , a non-gove rnmental humanitari a n
o r g a n i z at i o n , went back to rescue their street library.
They collected the children’s books,c r ayo n s , sheets of
p a p e r , s c i s s o rs and modeling clay displayed on the
green plastic sheet that for some ye a rs they had regu-
larly been taking to the city’s poorest distri c t s , a n d
r e t u rned with their precious cargo to the refugee shel-
t e rs. Along with some 160,000 other ATD Fo u rt h
World vo l u n t e e rs and 300 paid staff members in 30
c o u n t ri e s , they have been wa ging a “ war on pove rt y
through culture”—at the risk of shocking the ve ry
poor whose other needs are much more glari n g .
Not by bread
alone
Reinforcements soon reached them from neigh-
b o u ring Guatemala and from France, where AT D
Fo u rth World is based.The newcomers brought pup-
pets with them as well as shovels to clear the ru b b l e .I n
the end the shovels were hardly used,but the puppets
worked ove rt i m e .While rescue wo r k e rs gave emergency
a s s i s t a n c e , ATD Fo u rth Wo r l d ’s “cultural activists”
helped the hurricane victims keep their spirits up by len-
ding them books and performing sketches.
“ E ve ry b o d y,especially society’s poorest members ,
needs culture as much as bread. Not before or after
b r e a d , but at the same time.”T h at is the basic tenet of
ATD (Aid in Total Distress), which was founded in
1957 in a camp for homeless families in the Pa ri s
s u burb of Noisy-le-Grand by Father Joseph W r e s i n s k i .
F i rst the priest invited actors to perform Sophocles’
A n t i go n e in the muddy, ramshackle settlement.T h e n
he laid on an exhibition of ori ginal works by Picasso,
B r a q u e , Miro and Léger. “Culture is a fundamental
ri g h t ,” said Father W r e s i n s k i ,“ but the shame the poo-
rest people have to endure cuts them off from that
ri g h t .” He wanted culture “to cease to be a pri v i l e g e ”
and to help people outside mainstream society “ b e l i e ve
in their own culture and in their intelligence.”
ATD Fo u rth World began working in Central
A m e rica in 1979. On the edge of Te g u c i g a l p a ’s huge
city dump,needy people of all ages jostle for position
w h e n e ver a garbage truck arri ve s. They eke out a
m e a gre living by scave n ging through the ru b b i s h .
ATD Fo u rth World volunteer Régis De Muylder has
not always been gi ven a wa rm welcome when he has
t u rned up with his green plastic sheet. “ We don’t
want your books,” he was often told. “Here we have
to fight to eat . Our children are dying of hunger.”B u t
De Muylder refused to gi ve up,and today adults and
children stop work when he and other vo l u n t e e rs
a rri ve . “ L e ave them alone,” s ays veteran garbage
picker Don A n t o n i o.“ T h e y ’re here to help us, not to
judge us.” Don Antonio has himself learned h ow to
w rite in order to describe “ w h at he has gone through”
to his children.He finds it too hard to tell them about
such grim experi e n c e s.
Street libraries have been set up in 25 countries in
the North and the South.Their main aim is to encou-
rage children of school age to enrol in school,or if they
h ave dropped out to go back to the classroom. AT D
Fo u rth World says that unless people learn how to
read or write they cannot hope to escape from pove rt y.
Vo l u n t e e rs fa m i l i a rize the most disadvantaged yo u n g
people with a va riety of teaching mat e rials in order to
p e rsuade them that ignorance is not inevitable and that
they can go to school without feeling ashamed.Pa r e n t s
are patiently handled so as to get them used to the idea
of sending their children to school.
Another objective is to bring children, t e e n a g e rs
and adults together  and encourage them to respect
each other and get on together.“ We ’re not trying to
e n t e rtain the poorest people or organize neigh-
bourhood eve n t s ,” s ays Je a n - M a rie A n g l a d e , a one-
time chemical engineer who is now an ATD Fo u rt h
World staff member. “Our goal is to build self-
confidence in people who are outside the mains-
tream and to help them see their strengths,” so that
they can recover their human dignity, make their
voices heard and assert their rights. n
