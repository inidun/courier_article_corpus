AFTER the disaster of
National Socialism and
war, adult education in
Austria has more to do
than merely to spread know-
ledge ; it must demonstrate the
real values in democracy, hu-
man understanding, tolerance
and self-control.
This is not at all easy, as
the younger generation first
got to know these words
amidst misery, starvation and
political chaos. In any case,
it is not enough to approach
the intellects of the students,
but the whole human being
with mind and soul.
But there is another diffi-
culty. Austria is a country of
an old and most valuable cul-
ture. But many people, beset
by daily problems, find no
comfort in it. To many, cul-
ture appears to be a luxury,
useless for the"man in the
street", So adult education
has to build new bridges be-
tween men and culture to
make them meet.
In Austria, adult education
tries to approach the whole
human being. For this reason,
the residential colleges have
arranged courses of four to
twelve weeks'duration, in
which young farmers, farm-
workers, factory-workers and
clerks become a community of
their own. Plays, excursions,
dancing, singing, music, sport
are important parts of this
syst8m of education. The
teacher behaves as a friend,
the lectures are followed by
discussions.
Set ! Activity the Goal
A MORE rationalistic type isthat of the Folk High
School (Volkshoch-
schulcn) and evening classes
in the towns. It is not easy
to get. a holiday for purposes
of adult education ; so many
people, busy all day long in
offices and factories, attend
evening courses and single lec-
tures in these institutions.
From there classes grow nu-
merous discussion groups and
study circles, for self activity
is a conscious goal. As far as
possible, all technical means,
such as cinema, phonographs
and projectors are used, but
these means are most limited.
Of special interest and im-
portance are the attempts
towards artistic education.
Here again, institutions of
adult education try to lead the
students to understand art by
self activity (singing groups,
sculpture workshops, handi-
craft clubs, etc.). Excursions
to museums and exhibitions ;
good reproductions of works
of art in the rooms and corri-
dors contribute also to the
students'interest.
Role of Libraries
IN the provinces, excursionsto si nna or oth r towns,
to theatre concerts, exhi-
bitions are increasing in num-
ber. The Volkshochschule
Linz has initiated visits to
Italy and other neighbouring
countries, a most valuable re-
newal of an old educational
idea.
In the libraries, the leaders
advise the readers from a psy-
chological point of view to
bring the right book together
with the right person as far
as possible. This is made
more difficult by the limited
book supply in many libraries.
The librarians are partic-
ularly encouraged to increase
their usefulness by attending
special courses. Lectures are
given to enable readers to
meet the authors personally
and discussion groups meet
frequently.
In the last few years, many
new circulating libraries have
been founded : small chests for
fifty or hundred books are
sent to remote places and ex-
changed from time to time
Small town libraries have a
similar exchange system.
