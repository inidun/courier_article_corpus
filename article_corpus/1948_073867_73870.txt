In addition, the Supreme Com-
mander suggested that Unesco
serve as the agency to encourage
the exchange of scientific, educa-
tional and cultural publications
between Japan and other coun-
tries. He also recommended that,
in view of the financial difficul-
ties which today face Japanese
students wishing to study abroad,
Unesco undertake to make known
existing fellowships and scholar
ships for which Japanese may be
eligible.
It was pointed out to Dr. Kuo
that Japanese desiring to go
abroad for educational and culture-
al purposes required sponsors
who could guarantee their total'
expenses while away from their
country.
General MacArthur also point-
ed out the desirability for ; :'. CAP
representatives and selectd Jap-
anese experts to attend, as
observers, sessions of Unesco's
General Conference, certain
technical conferences (particular-
ly those concerned with textbook
revision). seminars, etc. He sug-
lZested to Do, Kuo that : 3CAP
might furnish Unesco with in-
formation on Japanese tes : book
revision and that Unesco in turn
inform SCAP of progress made in
developing criteria for text. boot
reform.
At the end of this meeting,
General MacArthur told Do, Kuo
that the Japanese people, with
SCAP assistance, have under-
taken a nation-wide programme
'oaf educational, scientific ana cul-
tural activity which is in har-
mony with the aims and pur-
poses of Unesco. Working through
Unesco, the Supreme Commander
said, SCAP might encourage
those activities bv continued ma-
nifestation of interest and bv the I
extension to Japan of special
assistance in certain areas and
projects.
