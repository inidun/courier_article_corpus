The intern ational situation in the late 1990s
d e m o n s t r ates more than ever the indivisibility
of all ri g h t s — e c o n o m i c, s o c i a l ,c i v i l ,p o l i t i c a l
and cultural—in the broadest sense.We have reached
a critical juncture where the number of rights is
increasing while their wording and practical
application are changing.The ideals which inspired
the Unive rsal Declaration may be
d e valued and the principles it has tri e d
to protect used to serve special interests
lest we focus on the stakes, p l aye rs ,
i n s t i t u t i o n s , s t r at e gies and interests
involved in defending them.
Since the 1980s, the planetary
interdependence stemming from
g l o b a l i z ation has increased debate and
media coverage of human rights in
m a ny arenas. The recommendat i o n s
t h at came out of conferences held
d u ring the present decade—Rio de
Ja n e i r o, C a i r o, C o p e n h a g e n , B e i j i n g
and Istanbu l — h ave usually been based
on an affirm ation of ri g h t s : rights to a clean
e nv i r o n m e n t , socio-economic ri g h t s , the rights of
women and the right to housing.
A gr owing number of people and organizations are
i nvo l ved in these issues, which is helping to raise
awareness of human rights and to spread more
i n f o rm ation about them in specific areas of concern .
But these sometimes powe r f u l , sometimes we a k
players have conflicting positions and interests and
a d vo c ate strat e gies that do not always coincide.
Interdependence does not necessarily mean
establishing symmetrical relationships and equal
o p p o rt u n i t i e s.The va rious forms that globalization is
taking and their destabilizing effects on social
relationships may even explain the growing concern
with human rights.
These “new rights”are appearing in a particular
context,which explains why there is an urgent need
to defend them and accounts for certain problems
r e l ating to how they have emerged. For they must be
defended without dividing up the issues and dive rt i n g
attention from the political and social relationships
that lead to violations.
We can tell if we are really looking at the
emergence of new rights or whether we are just seeing
an updating of the 1948 Unive rsal Declaration by
studying the va rious form s
g l o b a l i z ation takes and curr e n t
strategies of economic growth. More
s p e c i fic a l l y, we must focus on the new
f o rms of exclusion and margi n a l i z at i o n
t h at characterize a whole chain of
r e l ationships from the intern ational to
the regi o n a l , n ational and gr a s s r o o t s
l e ve l s. We must re-examine our
conceptions of globalization and
economic gr owth to try and
u n d e rstand the complexity of the
c u rrent process and the emergence of
new human rights demands.
Most economists argue that
g l o b a l i z ation is the outcome of unavo i d a b l e
adjustments to the new rules of intern at i o n a l
competition and to the laws of the market-place which
supposedly ensure the optimum distri bution of
resources around the wo r l d .But globalization should
be seen more as an eminently political process
i nvolving negotiations and struggles for influ e n c e
and power engineered and institutionalized by playe rs
such as gove rn m e n t s ,t r a n s n ational corp o r ations and
multilateral financial institutions.
W h at is more, the globalization of financial
markets and that of goods and services has different
s o c i a l ,economic and political implications depending
on the regi o n . E ven though they are all part of the
same worldwide process, these different situat i o n s
h ave their own special feat u r e s , which must be taken
into account when it comes to questioning human
rights and the necessity of defending them.
The liberalization underway goes hand-in-hand
Fifty years after the 1948 Universal Declaration, is there a
new generation of human rights? If so, how does it relate to
the rights enshrined half a century ago?
‘In a free nation, i t
often does not matter
whether individuals
reason well or poorly; i t
is enough that they
r e a s o n . From this
springs the liberty that
g u a rantees the effects
of that reasoning.’
Montesquieu,
1689-1755, France
G l o b a l i z a t i o n :
Since the 1980s,
planetary
interdependence
has fueled the
human rights
debate

with a programmed withdrawal by the state
from certain areas such as planning,
production and social reform and a re-
orientation of its involvement in others, like
r e d i s t ri bu t i o n ,r e g u l ation and mediat i o n .T h e
aim is to encourage special economic gr ow t h
strategies based on the promotion of private
interests.That has helped to undermine the
l e gi t i m a cy of states already beset by fiscal
c risis—especially in the South,where countri e s
are struggling with “structural adjustment”.
T h at has special implications for human ri g h t s.
The gr owing politicization of the
g l o b a l i z ation process, and especially the
politicization of how the crisis is managed in
the developing countries undergoing stru c t u r a l
a d j u s t m e n t , has led to a redefinition of the
s t at e ’s role. But in both the North and the
S o u t h , economic recove ry based on the pri vate sector
i nvo l ves special forms of integr ation with global
markets and new relationships with transnat i o n a l
corporations.
D o m e s t i c a l l y, r e f o rm programmes that seek to
create a set of economic and social relationships in
accordance with intern ational norms of productivity,
capital returns and competitiveness are directly or
indirectly attacking long-held ri g h t s ,
where they exist, such as employ m e n t
and social security benefits.The aim
is to help redistri bute resources from
“less productive ” s e c t o rs — s o c i a l
we l fa r e , health and educat i o n , f o r
example—to “more productive ”o n e s.
T h at shift comes at an incalculable
social cost because it invo l ve s
dismantling rules by which society
has operated over the last seve r a l
decades.
D u ring the 1990s, as the margi n a l i z ation and
exclusion of certain social cat e g o ries increased, t h e
Bretton Woods intern ational financial institutions gave
Bonnie Campbell*
some thought to the plight of  “target gr o u p s ” —
women, old people, children and the handicapped.
Special measures were adopted in their favour, but
without questioning the economic programmes which
had helped to wo rsen their situation in the first place.
More recently, the World Bank’s 1997 Wo r l d
D e velopment Report1, which focuses on the
redefinition of the stat e ’s role, contains a chart
s h owing the different functions the
bank thinks the state should fulfil l .
The role of “ e n s u ring social equity”
is not presented as an end in itself—
and even less as a social or economic
ri g h t — but as a means to stabilize
and consolidate a model of economic
gr owth whose logical progress can
only increase inequality and so lead
to potential violat i o n s.
Pove rty and the va ri o u s
dysfunctions of society wo r l d w i d e
are partly rooted in a selective and inequitable form
of social and political regulat i o n ,which means that the
battle to win new human rights is actually a struggle
Globalization takes many forms
that affect the way states
function.

what is at stake?
The battle for new
rights is actually a
struggle for the
redistribution of
power

for the redistri bution of power—an eminently political
m at t e r.By presenting economic,and now institutional
r e f o rms from a purely technical point of view, t h e
m u l t i l ateral and national institutions are dodging key
questions with regard to the control of the
development process.Who controls it? What is their
aim? In whose interests? It seems illusory to redefin e
measures for promoting social and economic rights,
including the aspiration to broaden their scope,b e f o r e
the content and purpose of the gr owth those
institutions recommend is made clear.
The increasingly aggr e s s i ve and multi-fa c e t e d
i n t e rvention by multilateral and bilateral aid
institutions in social and political mat t e rs is an at t e m p t
to reduce political processes to technical management.
Those institutions and their officials say there are
c e rtain “ n o n - n e g o t i a b l e ”n o rms dictated by economic
t h e o ry alone.The result is an attempt to take politics
out of the process, d e nying the legi t i m a cy of political
g o a l s.T h at is the context in which human rights must
n ow be placed and in which the gr owing role of
t r a n s n ational companies—with their freedom of
action, influence on public policy-making and thus
their power—can be understood.
But the social,political and economic impact of
outside playe rs va ries depending on many fa c t o rs ,
including domestic political situat i o n s. They range
from a state of law in which legally-recognized bodies
m ay publicly challenge rules about basic employ m e n t ,
health and environmental standards, to countri e s
where state structures have been we a k e n e d , t h e i r
legitimacy undermined,and where there are few, if
any, fora for public discussion.
In this context the major transnat i o n a l
c o rp o r at i o n s ,especially those that sell consumer goods
in we a l t hy countri e s ,h ave been busy promoting the
establishment of codes of conduct or ethics to avoid the
kind of boycotts that have occurred in Europe and
the United Stat e s. But most codes, when they exist,
h ave major loopholes, including a lack of means to
enforce them,of effective ove rsight and of sanctions in
the event of violat i o n s. C o n s e q u e n t l y, the adoption
of such codes can actually be a smokescreen for human
rights abuses by large corp o r at i o n s.
At the same time, the process of globalization and
the questions raised about the stat e ’s role in
r e d i s t ri buting resources, along with its withdrawa l
from many areas of political and social responsibility,
has underscored the emergence of new playe rs making
their voices heard for the first time. They are
mobilizing and organizing to demand new rights in
new ways, including rights for the homeless, young
p e o p l e , the elderly and the handicapped, the right to
b r e ath clean air, to drink uncontaminated water and
to eat food that is not poisoned by pesticides. In some
Alaska:cleaning up a beach after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
1989.

N o rth A m e rican cities, car windscreen wa s h e rs have
formed groups to defend their right to earn a little
money.
In many respects,these demands update several
articles in the 1948 Universal Declaration.Some of
them—the right to access personal dat a , to a healthy
life without genetic engi n e e ring and to a clean
e nv i r o n m e n t — r e flect technological and scientific
a d va n c e s. But again, the question
might be asked: who controls the
benefits of such technology and
science? Who decides how they shall be
used? To which ends and in whose
interests?
In this sense,we may be seeing less
the emergence of a new generation of
human rights and more the recognition
t h at , in the context of globalizat i o n ,
defending them must take into account many places
and interests in space and time. In other wo r d s , t h e
issues and the demands take different forms depending
on the place and the moment.As relationships become
increasingly complex,there is a chance that codes and
r e g u l ations will appear that seek to legitimize special
i n t e r e s t s ,methods and strat e gies in the name of human
rights while they may actually gi ve rise to the abuse of
those rights or the endorsement of a new and unjust
balance of powe r. As politicization of the issues
i n c r e a s e s , so do the chances of co-opting human ri g h t s
and seeing them used to serve the interests of a special
f e w.
The impact of human rights on the curr e n t
g l o b a l i z ation process is above all a political mat t e r
t h at requires identifiable playe rs to
build different power relationships at
different leve l s. Emphasizing the
p l aye rs and the responsibilities not
only shows that development and
defense of human rights are closely
l i n k e d , but also that the defense of new
and old rights—which are
inseparable—depends on taking back
control of development strat e gies and
of the power needed to defend them. n
