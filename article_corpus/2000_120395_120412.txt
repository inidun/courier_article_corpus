for solid gro u n d

The role of NGOs should be to foster the emergence of a worldwide civil society, the first step
t o w a rds making globalization a more democratic affair

NGOs were not born ye s t e r d ay, but the ri s i n g
number of conflicts that have reve r b e r at e d
in recent decades around a world globali-
zed in the neo-liberal mould has led
them to multiply and dive rsify into highly visible
b o d i e s.
Who are the main playe rs in this process of glo-
b a l i z ation? Gove rnments (politics) and the market
(the economy) are the twin pillars supporting the
p r o d u c t i ve systems and structures of modern
s o c i e t i e s. So who has the legi t i m ate right to change
them? The societies themselve s , for they alone
are made up of citizens grouped together as a
p e o p l e , a nation or a country.The right does not
belong to gove rn m e n t s , s t ate  stru c t u r e s , c o rp o-
r ate  exe c u t i ves  or markets. This is why, a s

N G O s , our attention  is directed at civil society
i t s e l f.
At the global leve l , our basic task is to foster the
emergence of a worldwide civil society as a pre-
condition to calling for a new style of globalizat i o n :
“ world gove rn a n c e .” Our mission is to encou-
rage the re-founding of globalization along more
d e m o c r atic lines by taking part in public debat e
and promulgating the concept of world citizenship.
The political stances we take and our lobbying
a c t i v i t i e s , t h e r e f o r e , do not come out of the blue,
but are efforts to transmit the main currents and
a s p i r ations of public opinion and make this opi-
nion stronger and clearer.
The tripartite
m i ra g e
All NGO actions
are based on a ob-
vious pri o ri t y, n a m e l y
t h at of support i n g
social protests and
public pressure duri n g
major negotiat i o n s
taking place within
the main circles of
p owe r. T h at is why
t h e a greements we
conclude and the
alliances we forge are
a b ove all else aimed
at organizations and
m ovements ari s i n g
from civil society.
T h at is also why we
build foru m s , c o-
alitions and netwo r k s
t h at straddle nat i o n a l
b o r d e rs. On the basis
of our approach, we
can think globally, s e t
up links between the
p a rticular and the
u n i ve rs a l , swap expe-
riences and keep ours e l ves regularly inform e d .
To d ay, global power is monopolized by major
m u l t i l ateral organizat i o n s , and is fundamentally
a n t i - d e m o c r atic in its structure and wo r k i n g s. I n
their current form , these organizat i o n s ’ claims to
embody democracy and unive rsal citizenship ri n g
h o l l ow. In fa c t , their only possible claim to legi t i-
m a cy is through the vo t e . But not all the nat i o n a l
g ove rnments represented in intern ational orga-
n i z ations have been elected by popular suffrage,
and ve ry few of them represent all the different
social forces that go into making up their nat i o n s.
Does this mean that NGOs, which are sup-
posed to embody civil society, should claim to
represent these peoples? Does it mean that our
goal should be to win a place at the heart of a
future new world democratic order? Does it mean
t h at we are fully entitled to a seat in some new tri-
p a rtite structure—made up of gove rn m e n t , c o m-
panies and civil society—that some people are
campaigning for? In my opinion, all of that is just
a mirage; e ven wo rs e , we risk losing sight of our
most useful and most legi t i m ate purpose if we
embrace that vision.
Small players,
big issues
NGOs are not out to conquer power or win
e l e c t i o n s , be they wo r l d ,n ational or local bodies.
We are not set up like political part i e s , e ve n
though our activities are public and seem highly
p o l i t i c i z e d .We cannot even present ours e l ves as
r e p r e s e n t at i ves of civil society because civil
society has not entrusted  us with  any such
m a n d at e .
So what do we want? To reach out, m o b i l i z e ,
e d u c at e , get across
m e s s a g e s , s u g g e s t ,
i n n ovat e ,p e rsuade and
politically strengthen
va rious groups in civil
society and, more spe-
c i fic a l l y, those excluded
from the decision-
making process. We
want to gi ve a voice to
i d e a s , va l u e s ,q u e s t i o n s
and proposals that
i nvo l ve social justice, a
more equitable distri-
bution of we a l t h , r e s-
pect for the env i r o n-
m e n t , the stru g g l e
against pove rty and
social exclusion.
Who are we? Small
p l aye rs , compared to
the other pillars of civil
s o c i e t y, such as trade
unions and profes-
sional organizat i o n s ,o r
bodies in the state or
the market. But we are
also—and this is something new—“big” p l aye rs ,
because our mission and our field of action are not
limited to a gi ven society, n ational economy or
single gove rn m e n t . Our task is to form a bri d g e
b e t ween the local and the global: in other wo r d s ,
to deal with what is unive rs a l , with what is
common to all humanity. Human ri g h t s , s o c i a l
c rises and environmental protection are global
i s s u e s.We deal with them in specific situat i o n s , bu t
our pers p e c t i ve is always planetary.
So where does our legi t i m a cy lie? In the qua-
lity of the va l u e s ,p rinciples and ideals we defend.
In the relevance and the importance of the issues
we raise. In the inve n t i veness of the proposals we
put forwa r d . Our only source of legi t i m a cy is our
ability to develop ideas aimed at action—ideas that
are up to the standards of public duty to which we
