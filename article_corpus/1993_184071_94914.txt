WHAT IS MODERN?
What do we mean by "modern"? The concept is elusive, ambiguous, ever-
changing. It is a paradox, constantly disputed, that refuses to be pinned down
by even a tentative definition. That which is modern is that which defies its
own definition, or is defined in negative terms, by what it is not.
There are modern things, not only objects but also functions, qualities
and forms of behaviour. Compact discs are modern and so are organ trans¬
plants and concern for the environment. A taste for superlatives is one fea¬
ture of modernity, whether applied to the prowess of athletes or the soft¬
ness of detergents. Extremity of scale is another, one might think the
minuscule in electronics, the gigantic in architecture.
Perhaps the best way to understand "the modern" is to take a cluster of
modern phenomena and to see what signs, clues and images they reveal.
Acting on this assumption, we asked men and women from different back¬
grounds, cultures and walks of life artists, designers, writers, architects,
musicians, philosophers, doctors, engineers to investigate the concept of
modernity. To help them on their way we suggested a number of ideas, clues
and keywords such as fragmention, the act of seeing, disorder, miniature,
new, audio and invisible.
As it happened, some of these clues did not lead far. However, new
pointers emerged. Where they led to can be seen on the following pages, in
a compilation of images and "signs of the times" that illustrate some of the
innumerable manifestations of modernity.
