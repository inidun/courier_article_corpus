A re l e a s e from life
Strides in medicine may allow people to live longer, but the result is not
always a happy one. In the Netherlands, euthanasia is now legally
available—but just how far should we go?

I
s a human body worth less in the Netherlands
than elsewhere? Does it lose its meaning here
once it gets old and decrepit? One might think so,
for this European country of 16 million people is
the only nation in the world where doctors, i n
accordance with the law,are able to end patients’ lives.
In April 2001, the Dutch senate gave the new law
on euthanasia the green light. The decision grabbed
international attention, although it was the predictable
outcome of a debate that has lasted a quarter of a
century. The law only established what was slowly
becoming normal procedure: that doctors are no
longer punishable if they carry out euthanasia as
long as they strictly conform to certain requirements
of due care. For example, they must be satisfied that
the patient is, according to medical criteria, s u f f e r i n g
unbearably and incurably, and has made the choice to
end his or her life without any outside pressure.
With the new law’s approval,the glorification of
suffering—a once pervasive streak in the Christian
tradition—seems to have been consigned to the
c o u n t r y ’s past. As Dutch theologian Annelies van
Heyst recently put it in Tr o u w, an ordinary life brings
enough suffering as it is. She nevertheless went on to
regret that along with the glorification of suffering, t h e
common rituals and comforting symbols of
Christianity had also been swept away:“Our culture
is focused on success and self-development. Fa s t ,
flashy, healthy—and when a problem comes up, this
is felt as if life is taking you for a ride.”

“ D e g r a d i n g ”and “ h u m i l i a t i n g.”With these words
euthanasia was justified from the very first lawsuits in
the 1970s and 1980s. Degrading meant, in the first
p l a c e, physical decay, such as terrible bedsores,
incontinence and loss of mobility. A culture that
places increasing emphasis on a flawless and beautiful
body is increasingly unable to cope with such ailments:
this might be one explanation for the support for
euthanasia,albeit rather a cynical one.
Advocates of euthanasia instead speak of self-
determination and compassion. They feel that it’s a
doctor’s duty to mitigate suffering, and the ultimate
consequence of this duty is death at request.An oft-
heard argument is that doctors themselves cause a lot
of suffering in their efforts to repair the old, s i c k
b o d y. In the past,
elderly people would
often die as the result
of a short and fierce
i n f e c t i o n , such as
t u b e r c u l o s i s. Th e s e
days, they have to live
for years in a body that
slowly gives up before
finally dying after a
wasting disease.
Everybody has the
right to go on to the
very end, those in
favour of euthanasia
s a y,but nobody should
be obliged to do so.
Many European
countries might share
the same
d e m o g r a p h i c s, b u t
t h e y ’re not necessarily
ready to follow in
Dutch footsteps. Th e
law is the fruit of a
unique set of
circumstances. First, it
required an influential
o r g a n i z a t i o n , t h e
Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society, which counts
around 100,000 members, including many prominent
n a m e s. S e c o n d , a small group of influential politicians,
who had been trying for years to get euthanasia
legalized, garnered support within the present left-
liberal government coalition.Dutch doctors, finally,
had long been seeking to be treated as integrated
m e d i c a l , psychological and social workers.
Euthanasia—literally “a good death”—fit this holistic
description to a T.
This particular alliance of doctors, politicians and
patients, however, is now threatening to fall apart.
Doctors see the new law as the final conclusion—“no
further than this.” But the Dutch minister of national
health care, Els Borst,let it be known that she wants
to initiate a debate over giving elderly people who are
simply tired of life the means of putting an end to it,
even if they are not terminally ill.The minister has the
full support of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society.
A g a i n , the magic word is “ h u m i l i a t i o n .” What if a
p e r s o n , after a rewarding social life, has to spend the
rest of his or her years in total solitude after everyone
around has passed away and every new day adds
only more torment? Is this not just as humiliating as
the last phase of cancer, with all the pain and loss of
decorum that accompany it?
Over 80 percent of the Dutch population are in
favour of euthanasia carried out by a doctor, o n
condition that all the legal demands about due care
are met.There is much less enthusiasm for a more or
less easily available
suicide pill for those
who are old and weary
of life. According to a
recent poll,46 percent
of Dutch people are
against this, of which a
significant number are
over 60. Doctors doubt
that the right to self-
determination should
go this far. Psychiatrist
Frank Ko e r s e l m a n
argued recently that
“autonomy is an
i d e o l o g y, even a
relatively fanatical one,
to which the
boundaries between
life and death are being
subordinated.”
In the mid-1990s,
Dutch doctors actively
ended about 3,200 lives
a year, r e p r e s e n t i n g
about 2.6 percent of all
d e a t h s. The ageing of
the population and
developments in
medical science will undoubtedly increase the demand
for euthanasia,but not without limits:it has become
clear that doctors refuse two out of three requests.
Most do not regard being tired of life or “not wanting
to be a burden to others”as valid reasons to carry out
this procedure. Euthanasia mainly concerns cancer
patients in their last days, and this is likely to remain
the case in years ahead. When questions about
terminating life are raised,doctors tend to fall back
on familiar territory: the body. “ They are there to
help when there are biological functional disorders,”
wrote Ko e r s e l m a n .“ To do this, they have instruments
such as pills and psychotherapy. Suffering is only
what brings people to the doctor. That the doctor
can sometimes alleviate this suffering is a fortunate
Tired of life?
