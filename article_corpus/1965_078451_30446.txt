TODAY Angkor is rising from its ruins.
Magnificent pyramid-shaped tem¬
ples covered with finely worked

Empire. To the world, the name Angkor,
in Cambodia, personifies the harmonious
art of the Khmer people which flowered
gloriously between the 9th and the 13th

Bases of these pillars in a gallery at
Angkor Wat have been attacked by an

caused damage throughout the temple.

School and the Cambodian authorities,

Sandstone that appears healthy comes
away in layers exposing badly-decayed
stone. In one place stone is friable and
crumbles into dust. In another, bacteria,
fed on the droppings of bats, eat away
reliefs. In the temple of Bataneyi Srei
dark patches disfigure the rose-coloured
sandstone. What look like the traces of
a great fire are actually incrustations of
manganese oxide. But happily science
is now able to deal with ravages that
only yesterday were quite irreparable.
