Going the cooperative way
The El Mezquital slum may still be a target for gangs, but its inhabitants
have devised some of Guatemala City’s best-run community projects,
giving access to clean water, health centres and schools
“G
angsters kill three youths in El
M e z q u i t a l ” ran the headline in
one of Guatemala City’s evening
papers in its first edition of the
new year. Few readers were
s u r p r i s e d , since the name of El Mezquital has, l i k e
other poor areas of Central A m e r i c a ’s biggest city,
become intimately associated with extreme poverty,
crime and violence.
More than 120,000 people are thought to live in
the six districts or shantytowns of El Mezquital on the
southern edge of Guatemala’s capital. Some work for
the government or in the private sector and a few
have professions, but the vast majority are either
unemployed or, like 43 percent of the country’s
labour force, work in the informal economy.
In the centre of El Mezquital the roads are paved,
there is public transport and small businesses operate.
But the shantytowns are mostly run-down areas
where wood and tin shacks are often built on the
edge of ravines.
Because they were built on illegally occupied
l a n d , the shantytowns at first had no public services
of any kind. This encouraged the growth of
community efforts that have turned out to be the
best run in the whole city. Determined not to rely on
what little government help was available, t h e
inhabitants decided to set up groups aimed at spurring
community development, either by providing vital
support to some government institutions or by taking
direct charge of supplying and administering basic
s e r v i c e s.
Pitching in: inhabitants of El Mezquital digging a trench to install water pipes.

“ When the co-operative was founded in 1990,
there were just 35 of us. Today we have over 1,600
m e m b e r s,” says Juana de Jesús Padilla, a housewife
who is spokeswoman of the “Effort and Hope”
United Housing Co-op (CO I V I E E S) , which was set
up to obtain legal titles to squatted land and raise
money to build houses.
“Back then we didn’t have any water supply,”
she says, “so we did our laundry in the river and
drank water we bought from the water trucks that
came round. As a result, many children contracted
stomach illnesses.” Several NG Os and government
bodies gave money to help the community come up
with its own project to supply drinking water,and the
recently founded CO I V I E E S agreed to get the plans
going and run them.
With the initial funding, three wells were sunk,
pipes laid and plants built to treat drinking water and
purify contaminated water.Although experts did the
technical work, many volunteers from the
neighbourhood helped out for free. The head of the
p r o j e c t , María Elizabeth Mijangos, reports that the
wells produce about 57,000 cubic metres of water a
month for 2,600 families. “ We charge one quetzal
($0.13) per cubic metre, while the city authorities
charge other neighbourhoods three quetzals,” s h e
s a y s.
Garbage collection is also managed by CO I V I E E S
via a truck that passes through twice a week. Th e
service charge is 15 quetzals ($1.95),about five times
cheaper than what the city charges.
The Neighbourhood Association for the
Betterment of El Mezquital (AV E P RO C O M E Z) was
founded in 1989. Its current secretary, civil servant
David Luna,recalls how six years ago the El Mezquital
health centre announced it would have to close down
because it could not meet the minimum standards of
cleanliness and security required to operate.The area
around the centre, protected by a simple fence of
wire netting, was also a constant target for gangs.
“ We held raffles and went door to door asking for
d o n a t i o n s,” says Héctor Gutiérrez, the engineer who
heads AV E P RO C O M E Z. “ We wanted to build a
perimeter wall to protect the centre, but we soon
realized we needed more than that. So we thought of
investing the initial funds in something that would

generate enough profit to ensure the centre’s future.”
A car park next to the health centre was thus
b o r n . “ The area was full of rubbish,” says Ja c i n t o
G o n z á l e z , the association’s vice-president.“It took us
six months to clean the place up, get rid of the weeds
and level the ground.”The car park, which holds up
to 35 vehicles, charges 90 quetzals ($11.70) a month
or 5 quetzals ($0.65) a day, and the profits go to
maintain the centre and pay for a security guard.
Amid El Mezquital’s traffic and pollution the
renovated health centre is a little oasis,with lawn grass,
t r e e s, rosebushes and birds. “ We see about 2,400
patients each month and give them free consultations
and medicine,” says Walter Méndez, one of three
doctors working there.Although the clinic belongs to
the health ministry,“most of what you see here is the
result of AV E R P RO C O M E Z,” he says. “I think it’s the
best-equipped clinic in
the whole city.”
Money from the car
park has also been used
to buy desks and other
furniture for the new
g o v e r n m e n t - o w n e d
Institute of Basic
E d u c a t i o n , w h o s e
premises were handed
over completely empty
to the teachers appointed
by the education ministry
to run it. P r i m a r y
education in the
neighbourhood is mainly
provided by two state-
run and two Catholic schools that are virtually free,
though there are also a few private schools
Street crime, h o w e v e r, remains El Mezquital’s
greatest unsolved problem.“ We all risk being attacked
in the street or in our homes and the police do nothing
about it,”complains José Luis Guitiérrez,who lives on
10th Street, one of the most dangerous in the whole
n e i g h b o u r h o o d .The threat posed by gangs of youths,
known as m a r a s, is not confined to El Mezquital. A
survey published in the local press showed that about
90 such gangs operate in the capital. In 1999 alone
more than 4,000 gang members,most of them children
from slum areas, were arrested and charged with
using and dealing drugs, possessing illegal fir e a r m s,
m u r d e r, sexual abuse and blackmail.
Brother Demsey Luarca,who runs the Dios Con
Nosotros parish, shares the concerns. “ The kids at
our school are an easy target for the m a r a s, who lie in
wait for them as they come and go and rob them of
their small amount of lunch money, their schoolbooks,
even their clothes and shoes.”
After many fruitless attempts to get the police to
a c t ,Brother Demsey tried to set up a neighbourhood
watch system similar to one in an adjoining
c o m m u n i t y, where residents raise the alarm with
whistles when they suspect criminals are prowling
a r o u n d . But the idea did not work, he says, b e c a u s e
people feared reprisals from the gangs.
Although El Mezquital has a police sub-station
with six permanent offic e r s, inhabitants seem to have
little trust in them.The story has been the same at the
national level following the 1997 peace agreement
between the government and guerrilla forces which
created a young police force that is still inexperienced
and lacks the equipment needed to maintain law and
o r d e r.
M e a n w h i l e, the people of El Mezquital have fix e d
their hopes for a better future on their own efforts.A t
the end of a day’s work as a small merchant, Ja c i n t o
González often joins a few neighbours to do
community tasks such as cleaning and painting the
Institute building.“Some people manage to contribute
m o n e y,” he says, “but it’s more valuable to give an
hour of one’s time.”
Despite some inevitable internal problems and
occasional power struggles, the community groups are
attracting people in growing numbers.There is talk of
opening a second health centre, another car park
and a playground, as well as expanding the water
supply system and launching a reforestation
c a m p a i g n .
“I’m 67,” says Juana de Jesús Padilla, “but I feel
more like 15.As long as I have the strength I’ll spend
all my free time working for the co-op.”No-one could
doubt her determination. ■
