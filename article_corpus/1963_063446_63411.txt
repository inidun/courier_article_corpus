15 YEARS AGO..
On December 10, 1948, the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the
General Assembly of the United
Nations meeting in Paris. At
that time, Unesco's Director-
General, Jaime Torres Bodet
hailed this great event in these
words:
THE declaration of io December
1948 is more than an historical
summary, it is a programme.
Every paragraph is a call to action,
every line a condemnation of apathy,
every sentence a repudiation of some
moment of our individual or national
history; every word forces us to scru¬
tinize more closely the situation in
the world today.
The destiny of mankind is an
indivisible responsibility which we
all must share. So long as it remains
possible to flout with impunity even
one of the rights of one single human
being, the United Nations Declara¬
tion will continue to accuse us all of
cowardice, sluggishness, laziness, and
to remind us that we are lacking in
human charity. So long as the greater
part of the human race continues to
live face to face with hunger and

injustice and to die in squalor and
ignorance, the Declaration adopted in
Paris will represent nothing more
than a remote ideal.
To make the Declaration known
everywhere is to wage a world¬
wide campaign for a life
worthy of man, to whom the
governments have dedicated this
Declaration, not in mere lip service,
but in solemn recognition of their
duties to civilization and to humanity.
To help States carry out these
duties in the field of education,
science and culture is the proud
mission of Unesco. What nobler
task could be assigned to culture,
education and science, than to make
all men the guardians, and hence
the fervent exponents, of the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights ?
