In a letter addressed to the then prime minister,
Rajiv Gandhi,the Goan activist group Citizens
C o n c e rned About To u rism (CCAT) wrote in
1990:
“ O ver the last ten ye a rs , hippies and similar
backpack tourists have virtually taken over (…)
They live here without visas or passports. …They
lie around nude on our beaches and practice and
p r o p a g ate free love and free sex. D rugs are an inte-
gral part of their relaxed way of life.They are para-
sites who thri ve by sucking the life-blood of our
nation—OUR  YOUTH.”
While doing fie l d work for my Ph.D. on touri s m
problems in Goa, a former Po rtuguese colony in
southern India,I’ve encountered many such emo-
tional reactions to the white traveler/hippie culture



Fear and l o a t h i n g in Goa
◗ Arun Saldanha
‘Sex drugs and rock ’n’ roll’ is the traditional source of moral panic 
for parents and police. But in Goa, p a rents fear that their youth will 
be corrupted by cultural imperialism

existing uneasily in traditional coastal villages.
These reactions lead back to a general Goan patri-
otism, “tested” by the perceived cultural threat of
t o u ri s m , especially in the nort h e rn village of
A n j u n a . In the early 1990s, hippie tourism gave
way to one of the world’s most famous rave scenes
with Goa trance music, which not only at t r a c t s
hordes of travelling rave rs and package touri s t s
from the UK, Israel, Germany, France, Japan and
other countries, but many local youths as well.
Panic about young people succumbing to sup-
posedly “ f o r e i g n ”p l e a s u r e s : does this sound fa m i l i a r ?
Youth culture is,by defin i t i o n ,d e v i a n t . It subve rts the
meanings adults gi ve to decency and health, r e s p o n-
sibility and tastefulness, night and day. I t ’s not ve ry
s u rp rising that adult disapproval results in hy s t e ri c a l
media reports and often in restrictions or police
action aimed at subve rting the subve rs i o n s.
A turning point
in the 1980s
Though sociologists have studied how genera-
tional aspects of moral panic are connected with
class, gender, ethnic and sexual dimensions, there
h a s n ’t been much attention on the i n t e r c u l t u ra l
i s s u e . In Goa, moral panic becomes a Nort h - S o u t h
i s s u e , one of insidious “cultural imperi a l i s m ” .S o m e
local youth—boys, not girls who generally stay at
home in India—are thought to prefer We s t e rn
m u s i c, d rugs and sexual habits to “traditional VA L-
UES like honesty, hard wo r k ,d i s c i p l i n e , good moral
b e h aviour and pat ri o t i s m ”( C C AT ) . For many par-
ents, journalists and activists,white foreigners are
forcing their culture in a colonial way upon the
helpless kids of Goa.
The reality is more complex.In the 1970s, the
hippies lay naked and stoned on drugs, listening
to their music, while the locals worked for a liv-
ing. Two radically different worlds co-existed
within the same village, but there were never
problems to speak of. In the 1980s, the party
crowds grew to the thousands, the music became
electronic (thus louder),and the drug market bet-
ter organised.
3 Defusing the alarm
Two worlds collide at a flea market in Anjuna.

Goa trance parties traditionally happen at full
m o o n , C h ristmas and New Ye a r , on the beaches,
in forests and on hills.They are normally free,g o i n g
on till late morn i n g, keeping the village awake with
the throbbing kick dru m . Goa trance music is a
fa s t , hypnotic kind of techno, with flu c t u at i n g
streams of bleeps, squelches and soundscapes
vaguely reminiscent of Eastern harm o n i c s.A n j u n a ’s
hippie past is reflected in fluorescent paintings and
performances to match the music’s heavy psyche-
delic thrust, further enhanced by the use of illegal
drugs like LSD, Ecstasy and hashish—this music
i s n ’t called t ra n c e for nothing. The psychotropic
atmosphere and imagery is simulated on the Inter-
net and at psy-trance parties around the wo r l d ,
from Slovenia to Sydney,Thailand to Tel Aviv.
M a ny Goans also take part by selling c h a i
(Indian tea), snacks and cigarettes or by dri v i n g
t a x i s , renting out rooms, b i k e s , p a rty spaces and
sound equipment. They also sell booze, c l o t h e s ,
d ru g s , f o o d , cassettes and paraphern a l i a , f r o m
chillums (traditional Indian hash pipes) to incense.
And because loud music after 10 p.m. is illegal in
Goa, cops and corrupt politicians can earn piles of
rupees by routinely charging b a k s h e e s h ( b ribes) for
the parties and fishing for drug possession. In short ,
Anjuna’s party scene is as much of interest to for-
eign freaks and dealers as it is to Goans.
Yet this economic dimen-
sion is ignored by the media
and activists. Instead they
demonise the scene as one
which cat e rs to foreign plea-
sures while corrupting Goa’s
g ove rnment and seducing its
yo u t h . This is moral panic,
a rt i c u l ated along a postcolo-
n i a l , intercultural dimension.
M o r a l , because there’s alway s
a puritan and pat riotic under-
t o n e . Pa n i c, because the effects
of Goa trance are exaggerat e d .
Moral panic then gets in the way of admitting that
m a ny Goan boys and men genuinely enjoy the par-
ties without the drugs (too expensive) and without
sex (contrary to widespread belief in the area, o n e
d o e s n ’t copulate at a rave ) .W h at ’s more, gr ow i n g
n u m b e rs of much richer youth from Mumbai (for-
merly Bombay) are discove ring the rave Mecca in
their own country.Weekends and holidays are spent
basking in the festive glory,although they are careful
to throw away their hippie clothes before returning to
D a d , Mum and their yuppie jobs.
I’m not saying Goans, Indian touri s t s , M u m b a i
y u p s , white package touri s t s ,b a c k p a c k e rs and trance-
heads all happily dance together in pluralist commu-
n i o n . I’m only saying that the audience is extremely
d i ve rs e , far more so than in the We s t .The starkly ad hoc
manner of organising these parties makes it difficult to
call the phenomenon a planned strategy of narcotics
m a fia , m u l t i n ational capital, or wacko India-imita-
t o rs intent on turning the young Indian generat i o n
into equally wacko We s t - i m i t at o rs. I t ’s true that
t o u ri s m ,d rug traffic k i n g, c o rru p t i o n , and stereotyp-
ical imaging of Goa/India all feed on the inequality
existing in the world between North and South,w h i t e
and brow n , rich and poor. But deducing that Goa’s
youth has been sucked into a “ f o r e i g n ”hedonism and
m at e rialism is a totally different mat t e r.
Can we conclude that moral panic isn’t justifie d
in Goa? Well, moral panic is never justified, as it’s
a lways based on exaggeration and misinterp r e t a-
t i o n .W h at is justifia b l e , is putting things in per-
spective and in concrete terms. Many Goans make
good money during winter by virtue of the trance
parties. Busting the events,as the government and
police seem eager to do lately, will hurt these poor
locals much sooner than the big hotel owners and
d rug dealers.The repressive climate reinforces cor-
ruption and prevents open debat e .And the touri s t s
will only head someplace else.
L i k e w i s e , m a ny local young men and Indian
l ower-class tourists enjoy dancing to the music.W h o
are intellectuals and parents to argue that this fun is
not “ r e a l ” but induced by foreigners? How do they
k n ow that the “ f ri e n d s h i p s ”b e t ween locals and for-
e i g n e rs are purely utilitarian? Labeling Goa trance as
“ n o n - G o a n ” and “ c o l o n i a l i s t ” denies intercultural
dialogue and possible solutions to the problems.
I r o n i c a l l y, the middle-class Catholic parent culture
forced upon Goan yo u n g s t e rs is more clearly a result
of aggr e s s i ve colonialism (of
Po rt u g a l ) , than the Goa
trance subculture they’re fli rt-
ing with. For it is nothing
more than fli rt i n g : after the
t o u rist season, i t ’s back to
Indian village or small-tow n
life again. In the eyes of danc-
ing Goans and foreigners ,
Goa trance is Goan.
N ow let’s accept that
Goa trance is part of Goa.
Does that resolve all of the
problems? Of course not. Po l-
lution is part of Goa and it’s not okay.M a ny problems
in Goa (like pollution and corruption) are connected
to rave touri s m , but we cannot just blame the touri s t
i n d u s t ry and foreigners.F i rs t ,we need to identify the
p r o b l e m s. A Goan boy decides to pierce his nose in
keeping with trance fa s h i o n . Is that a problem? Or
should we be more concerned that cops pay to be
posted at the coast to collect b a k s h e e s h? Let’s deal with
the second firs t .L e t ’s not judge,like many Goan city-
folk do, from wild second-hand stories of the malign
l u n atics of Anjuna or from inconsistent pat ri o t i c
denials of intercultural exchange.
I sense the reader frow n i n g . Listen to this Euro-
pean wise-guy spilling big words about other peo-
p l e ’s problems, calling them naïve and on top of
that getting credit for it… same old North/South
d o m i n ation but now on a unive rsity leve l .But con-
sider another possibility. Instead of hiding behind
the façade of detached social science, w hy not try to
s t i m u l ate debate on how to solve Goa’s rave -
tourism problems? ■
