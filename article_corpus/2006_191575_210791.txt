LIbanon
the scars of war
                              continuing to live after the bombs and the trauma of war: 
                                   this is the challenge that confronts certain lebanese children. 
                           in this environment, game playing is the preferred means by which 
                                   to encourage children to express their suffering.
Fadi leaves the rubble of his house 
in the suburbs of Beruit, a box full 
of books in his arms. He’s going 
to live not far from there in the 
suburb of “Tarik Jadida” (the new 
road), with relatives. Already his 
school is too far away, so he will 
need to find a new one. He’s up-
set not to have found his drawing 
book amidst the ruins. 
Now in Cana, in the south of 
country. Souad’s black scarf re-
veals a round face and shy look. 
Souad is a survivor of the Cana 
massacre of 1996. Six years old at 
the time, she was seriously injured 
and burned. “I lost my mother and 
my five brothers and sisters. I’ve 
become accustomed to war, I’ve 
adapted. I’m no longer fearful. But 
when they bombed Cana for the 
second time in august 2006, I be-
gan to cry and to scream. It was as 
if I was reliving the first massacre. 
When I was little, I drew pictures 
to escape my fear, but since then 
I have left school and I no longer 
draw.”
A mirror of war
Fadi and Souad are two victims 
of war, traumatized forever by 
what they experienced. It is for 
them that, for the first time, aid 
programs have been implement-
ed in Lebanon. Game playing is 
the preferred means by which to 
bring them to express what they 
feel. Claire El Saïd, Bureau Chief 
for the International Movement of 
Apostolate of Children in Beirut, a 
Catholic organization that works 
in advisory capacity for UNICEF, 
says: “Children must play until 
they are tired. We are studying 
the violence that manifests itself 
in their games. Children are a mir-
ror of their surroundings.” 
The International Movement of 
Apostolate of Children is particu-
larly active in attempting to reduce 
the impact of media violence on 
children. “We must try to avoid 
the aftermath of war,” comments 
El Saïd. 
Secretary General of the Higher 
Counsel for Children (Ministry of 
Social Services), Elie Mikhail has 
coordinated her activities with 
those of humanitarian associa-
tions in order to implement a psy-
chological support programme. 
Programmes and activities have 
been rolled out to comfort chil-
dren and help them to adapt to 
a new reality. A mechanism has 
been put in place to detect trauma 
cases and put children in touch 
with psychologists. 
The Minister of Education and 
Higher Learning has also taken the 
issue on board. He has launched 
the training of 105 teachers in the 
Marjeyoun region. This seminar 
is based on providing emotional

support to children after the war. 
Moreover, the Education Minister 
has collaborated with UNESCO 
and UNICEF in the regions of 
Bint Jbeil, Nabatieh, Marjeyoun 
and Hasbaya in southern Leba-
non. Twenty-five public school 
teachers from public schools 
have participated in workshops 
organized by UNESCO’S office 
in Beirut. Their goal: help students 
to overcome the hardship of war 
with practical, artistic or theatrical 
activities, all while providing psy-
chological support.
Singing for peace
In parallel to extra curricular activi-
ties such as recreational camps 
on the weekend or excursions, 
drawing and singing activities are 
also taking place. The artist Ja-
hida Wehbeh thus chose a group 
of children to sing a song about 
peace with her. 
Line Jones, a consultant with the 
International Medical Corps (IMC) 
in the field of mental health, inter-
venes in the villages of the South. 
Using puppets, she teaches chil-
dren how to stay clear of bombs 
and gives them an opportunity to 
express what they may be repress-
ing. Upon arriving in Lebanon, 
she discovered that children in 
the South were prisoners of their 
own homes: recreational activities 
were generally taking place in ru-
ins reminding them of a childhood 
they were forced to give up. Some 
children were taking courses in 
tents. For this reason, she sug-
gested that the leaders of interna-
tional organizations build a centre 
that would provide children with 
a place to play and speak openly 
about their fears. This centre was 
built in the Khiyam area. 
Meanwhile, Claire El Saïd notes 
that this work would never have a 
significant effect if it consisted of 
short term activities. She hopes 
the Ministry of Education and 
specialized international organi-
zations will implement a minimum 
one-year action plan and have 
children in need undergo therapy 
even if they do not show any signs 
of distress.
