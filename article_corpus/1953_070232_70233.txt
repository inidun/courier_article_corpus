'THE CHILDREN FIGHT FOR LIFE'
IN the aver-j age Amer-
ican home
blessed
with young
children, the
parents have
three constant
problems.
One is to in-
duce the chil-
dren to eat properly-to down the
spinach before the dessert. An-
other is to make them dress pro-
perly-rubbers in the rain, muf-
flers in cold weather. The third
is to get them to the doctor or den-
tist-on schedule.
But, for most American children,
the spinach, the, rubbers and the
doctor are available.
For more than half the children
on earth they are not.
There are about 900 million
children under fifteen on earth
today. More than half-about 500
million-live and die in want.
The youngsters may never have
tasted milk, or worn shoes or visit-
ed a doctor. But they are famil-
iar with hunger and cold and
disease.
The only organization that even
begins to answer their needs is
UNICEF-the United Nations In-
ternational Children's Emergency
Fund.
Its total expenditures have been
less than the cost of a single air-
craft carrier. What in the world,
you may ask, can UNICEF do with
so little money ? That is a long,
exciting, heart-warming story.
It began in 1946. In Europe,
there were 30 million children in
dire need as a result of the war.
First, they needed food. As soon
by E. leanor ROOSE. VE. L T
as the United Nations General As-
sembly had set up the organization
and the United Nations Appeal for
Children had brought in some
money, UNICEF began to supply
food, in the cheapest, most nutri-
tious form : dried skim milk.. That
winter three million children in the
eleven European countries hardest
hit by aggression received enough
milk to keep them alive.
They needed clothing, too. UNI-
CEF got raw materials-cotton,
wool and leather-and these coun-
tries made them into dresses, suits
and shoes.
Tuberculosis was reaching epi-
demic proportions. UNICEF join-
ed the Scandinavians-who start-
ed on their own-and, With a pre-
paration called BCG, launched
campaigns of vaccination against
tuberculosis in children. That
programme has developed into
history's largest mass vaccination
campaign.
Picture a European child, in the
early post-war emergency, being
given a cup of milk, a blanket or
a pair of shoes, a vaccination.
Now picture UNICEF's later
development.
A 13-year-old Filipino boy was
night-blind, could not see at all
after dark. One night he failed to
arrive home before sunset. His
frantic parents sent out searching
parties. While they were beating
the woods, his mother heard
someone approaching the house.
Because of the firm, rapid step,
she knew it could not be her Jose.
But it was !
"Mama,"Jose shouted,"I can
see !"
At school, for the past few
months, José had been getting
shark-liver oil capsules from UNI-
CEF. They contain vitamin A,
lack of'which causes night-blind-
ness. Playing baseball, José had
been late starting home.
The"cup of milk"still is basic
in the UNICEF programme. (An
Italian child, asked what UNICEF
meant, said :"It is the American
word for cow".) But it is impor-
tant to note that the number of
children"sitting around the UNI-
CEF food table"has declined from
an early post-war figure of seven
millions to half that. Of those
still being fed, about 575, 000 are
refugees or are living in drought-
stricken areas. They get skim
milk to keep them alive.
But the rest of the milk supply
goes for different purposes. In
Africa, 340, 000 children get skim
milk to combat a common diet
deficiency condition called kwashi-
orkor. In Central America, the
milk is distributed in UNICEF
assisted demonstrations to show
its value in improving general
child health, so as to encourage
permanent, locally maintained
school-feeding programmes. In
Asia, Latin-America and the east-
ern Mediterranean the milk goes
to maternal and child-welfare
centres.
Along with the milk goes fish-
liver oil-cod-liver oil to be taken
by the spoonful or concentrates in
capsule form. An important med-
ical target is rickets, but the over-
all aim is to set up proper diet as
a means to better general health.
This would be of little lasting

value if under-developed countries
"went on depending on outside food
sources.
So, with the help of another UN
agency called the Food and Agri-
cultural Organization, UNICEF
began to teach people haw to
increase their own milk production
and how best to use what they had,
by pasteurization, refrigeration and
drying.
Out of milk conservation equip-
ment provided by UNICEF, four-
teen countries in Europe, the
Middle East and Latin-America
soon will offer safe, low-cost or
free milk to four million children.
From the beginning, UNICEF
has required that all countries
requesting assistance match UNI-
CEF's aid, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, with home-supplied effort.
Many have done more-they have
become substantial contributors to
the Children's Fund as a whole.
The"matching"principle goes
far. Of seven million dollars'
worth of textiles ant leather goods
distributed by UNICEF up to the
middle of 1951-two all countries in
Europe, and to Japan and Korea in
Asia-all were processed within,
or at the expense of, the receiving
country, except in Korea. For
Korea, Japan did the processing.
Result of such"matching" : for
the seven million dollars advanced
by UNICEF, at least one garment
or a pair of shoes apiece for five
or six million youngsters.
Dr. Roger P. Stewart has a story
of his UNICEF'work in Greece
that puts the breath of life into
these dull figures :
In a rain-drenched Greek village,
shattered by war, he was giving
out blankets. Outside the tent,
mothers and grandmothers stood
hopefully in the downpour. There
was nothing Dr. Stewart could do
for them. His charges were the
children-shivering, half naked,
shoeless.
Inside the tent, the youngsters
received half-soaked blankets with
incredible delight, tucked them
under their tatters and ran home.
But one tiny five-year-old had
stayed at Dr. Stewart's side all
through the proceedings, though
told his family's quota had been
filled. He kept looking at Dr. Ste-
wart with dark, trusting eyes.
The pile of blankets dwindled to
nothing-and still he remained.
Dr. Stewart remembered some-
thing in his car-an indescribable
garment found in a batch of
gift clothing, halfway between a
night-shirt and an overall ; rainbow
coloured, partly cotton, partly wool
- and frilled.
Dr. Stewart got it out of the car
and offered it.
The five-year-old eyes opened
wide. There was a squeak of
rapture.
And another UNICEF'worker
saw how little it takes to win the
eternal gratitude of children.
Child health is a small phrase-
with big meanings. Current
authorized programmes, assisted
by the UN's World Health
Organization, call for 58, 900, 000
youngsters to be tested for tuber-
culosis. Of these, one-third to
on-half will be vaccinated with
BCG anti-tuberculosis serum. For
yaws, bejel and syphilis, 23
million, are to be examined, and
all cases of infection will be
treated.
Against malaria and other in-
sect-borne diseases, protection is to
be provided for 20 million, chiefly
in the form of DDT sprayings.

Smaller projects, such as immu-
nization against whooping cough
and diphtheria, will reach one and
a quarter million children.
Will all this really be done ?
Sceptics may note that in Asia
alone 9 million youngsters already
have been tested for tuberculosis
and 3, 200, 000 vaccinated ; 2 million
examined for yaws and 3i5, 000
treated ; 1, 500, 000 protected against
malaria.
"Training"is the key word in
much of what UNICEF does.
The first thing is to show people
what is best to do. But the next
and perhaps most important step
is to train native technicians to
handle the procedures scienti-
fically. After that, the technicians
train other technicians in an ever-
widening circle.
All UNICEF can do is to provide
a nucleus of knowledge and initia-
tive, a mobile corps to be sent to
trouble spots and a store of up-to-
date"demonstration"materials.
Ideally, that is all UNICEF ought
to do, since it hopes simply to teach
people how to help themselves.
Nevertheless, UNICEF already
has given direct aid to 42 million
children in 64 different countries.
Current programmes will raise
those figures to 60 million children
in 72 countries.
When UNICEF medical supplies
and food and clothing began to go
out all over the globe, it was
proposed that the name should be
translated into various languages,
or at least that the initials forming
it should be translated into the
various alphabets. But there was
a standard UNICEF symbol stamp-
ed on each packing case. And
before much should be done about
the translation,'"UNICEF"had
become an actual word on the
banks of the Ganges in India, near
the Arctic Circle in Finland and
along the Equator in Brazil and
Ecuador.
The'word is permanent in the
minds of those grateful peoples.
But UNICEF is set up as a tempo-
rary agency, a sort of step-child
whose future is always uncertain.
The"E"still stands for emergency,
though the needs of 500 million
children in want are anything but
temporary. My hope-and the
only practical salvation for those
500 million children-is that UNI-
CEF will be made permanent.
Thirty little orphans in a convent
on a border between Jewish and
Arab territories symbolize one
reason for my hope. UNICEF
has sent food to the convent since
1948, when fighting disrupted the
area and children began to starve.
Not long ago, the five-year-olds
decided to show their gratitude.
With pieces of cardboard, bits of
coloured stone and strips of satin,
they lovingly fashioned and dress-
ed a ten-inch high figure. Gleam-
ing, the figure stands on an altar
in the kindergarten, where all can
see and remember to give thanks
to their benefactress.
Her name ?"Mademoiselle UN-
ICEF."
I want Mademoiselle to go on
helping them-and helping all the
other millions of children in the
world who so desperately need her.
