c o u n t ries to support an ambitious intern at i o n a l
research project on the tropical oceans.The synergy
b e t ween researchers around the globe made it possible
to envisage a bigger project than any one country
was willing to fin a n c e .
B o rn in 1985, the 18-nation Tropical Ocean and
Global Atmosphere Program (TOGA) started a
decade of observations that helped to minimize the
impact of the 1997/8 El Niño. Its long-term aim wa s
to establish an observation network to predict cli-
m at e . By the end of the project, in 1995, an arr ay of
about 70 bu oys—the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean
A rr ay (TAO ) — was in place, straddling the equat o ri a l
Pa c i fic.These continue to send real-time measures of
sea surface temperat u r e , s u r face wind and salinity
via sat e l l i t e s , to research centres that use the data to test
and fine-tune climate models. Ships are assigned full
time to placing and servicing the bu oy s. It is a costly
t a s k , but the annual $18 million that the U. S .a l o n e
i nvested was a small price compared to the estimat e d
$2 billion they lost in the 1982/83 El Niño.
Measuring sea level by satellite
Unlike the at m o s p h e r e , the scale of some ocean
phenomena can be relat i vely small—10 to 100 km
across—so many more data points are needed. F u r-
t h e rm o r e ,c l i m ate modelling and forecasting require an
u n i n t e rrupted series of dat a .When TOGA start e d ,a few
s atellites were making observations of the sea surfa c e ,
but cloud cover frequently obscured their view.With the
1992 launching of the Franco-U. S . To p e x / Po s e i d o n
s atellite equipped with two radar altimeters that could
see through cloud, it became possible to measure sea
l e vel to within a few centimetres.Scientists invo l ved with
TOGA were able to conve rt this inform ation into
t e m p e r ature dat a .
When TOGA ended in 1995, the scientists
r e grouped under a new $100 million per year pro-
gr a m m e — C l i m ate Va riability and Predictability
( C L I VAR)—continuing for 15 ye a rs. Using the same
bu oy s , these scientists first detected an unusual rise in
t e m p e r ature below the surface in the tropical Pa c i fic
early in 1997—first signs of an El Niño.Combining the
bu oy data with satellite images, they were able to track
its onset almost daily. When it was clearly bu i l d i n g
u p, the U. S . National Cl i m ate Centre broadcast dat a
on the Intern e t . El Niño watch centres established in
some of the vulnerable countries like Pe ru were able to
take action while others like Kenya , which did not
h ave such fa c i l i t i e s , were ill-prepared when floods and
drought hit.
The success of TOGA and CLIVAR in predicting
the 1997/98 El  Niño has confirmed that the inve s t-
ment was wo rt h w h i l e .N ow,s c i e n t i s t s ’ main aim is to
make their forecasting models even more reliable,b y
combining a supply of data from the bu oys with
images from new Jason sat e l l i t e s.The longer ahead
El Niño is detected, the gr e ater the opportunity vul-
nerable nations have of taking action. n

Pe ruvian fis h e rmen have known about El Niño for
hundreds of ye a rs , but until now they have neve r
been able to predict when it would stri k e .In 1982/83,
this recurring we ather pat t e rn caused an estimated $8 to
$13 billion in damages.T h e n ,e ven the wo r l d ’s leading cli-
m ate experts were not much wiser than local fis h e rm e n .
But when the 1997/98 El Niño appeared—the strongest
on record—a vast intern ational monitoring network wa s
in place.With a few months wa rn i n g, fa rm e rs in Brazil
and Australia were able to switch to crops that would not
be hit by the coming drought,while some other countri e s ,
expecting flo o d s ,d e l ayed construction projects and bu i l t
b a rri e rs.
El Niño happens when there is a reversal in the
usual wind and surface temperature pat t e rns in the tro-
pical Pacific. Scientists knew that the world’s oceans
play an important role in determining climate by sto-
ring and transporting large quantities of heat energy,
but they knew little about how oceans interact with the
atmosphere. By the early 1980s, a new generation of
s u p e r c o m p u t e rs had appeared able to run complex cli-
mate models.What was missing were the data from a
very wide area.
In 1979, the U. S . N ational Oceanic and A t m o s-
p h e ric A d m i n i s t r ation (NOAA) had a research project in
the equat o rial Pa c i fic, m e a s u ring ocean current in real
time from a bu oy moored on the equat o r. But the costs
of the 1982/83 El Niño led the U. S . to be among the firs t
