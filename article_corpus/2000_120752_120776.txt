D e e t e s :
a bridge to the hill tribes

t a time when many T h a i
people viewed the hill
t r i b e s1 in the north of the
country as a security risk,
you started working with
t h e m .Wh y ?
In the early 70s, I was a
university student in
Bangkok where I heard
all kinds of stories about
the hill tribes,many of whom had fled from
ethnic conflicts and hardships in neigh-
bouring Burma, L a o s, China and Cam-
b o d i a . The hill tribes were accused 
of drug traffic k i n g, prostitution and de-
stroying forests with their slash and burn
cultivation methods. I decided to see for
myself through a student volunteer pro-
gramme to teach the Thai language in the
h i l l s.It didn’t take long to see that there was
very little truth in those allegations.
I first went to stay with the Lizu
people in Chiang Rai province.Here was
this city-girl, born in Bangkok, who had
never before climbed mountains, s t u m-
bling along trails for four hours. I ’ll never
forget how refreshing it was to find the
village and its tidy winding paths shel-
tered by an enormous forest. Despite all
of the negative things that I heard, to my
great surprise, I found the hill tribes living
in a pure environment leading a simple
traditional life. I couldn’t understand
their language yet I could feel the
With an iron will and a calm
spirit, the activist continues her

Individuals and groups with vested
interests exploited the geographic advan-
tage of the region for opium production.
But the blame fell on the hill tribes, lea-
ding the United Nations and the Th a i
government to massively introduce the
cultivation of cash crops like fruits and
v e g e t a b l e s.These projects have had little
success in improving the life and dignity
of the hill tribes and have taken a heavy
toll on the environment.
The Hmong tribe, for example,
have been among the worst affected.To
grow vegetables, they diverted more and
more water from the rivers and began
using fertilizers to increase their yields.
By reducing and polluting rivers, t h e y
came into conflict with the Thai farmers
living in the lowlands.
Wasn’t this also linked to the problem of
d e f o restation? We ren’t the hill tribes
accused of causing great damage by clea-
ring forest for farming and then burning
the fields after a harvest to re j u v e n a t e
the soil?
Tr a d i t i o n a l l y, the hill tribes used
slash and burn tactics in a limited way—
just to produce food for their families.
But in trying to produce cash crops and
satisfy the demands of the market, t h e
tribes surpassed the natural capacities of
the land,degraded by deforestation and
e r o s i o n . The Akha tribes, for example,
began cultivating rice in steep areas,
which caused soil erosion.They are now
trying alternative methods.
H o w e v e r, I do not think that slash
and burn cultivation alone caused the
deforestation in the northern region.
Timber companies and other commercial
groups from the south should be held
responsible for the large-scale problem.
I do not deny that a country like Th a i l a n d
needs more timber and other natural
resources for its economic development.
But at what cost? To d a y,no one appears
willing to publicly discuss this problem.
You  started out as a ‘ s p o ke s p e rson’ for the
hill tribes. How has your role changed?
By studying their language, h i s t o r y
and kinship system, I gained their confi-
d e n c e.This enabled me to introduce some
basic education projects which later led to
the creation of the Hill Area Development
Foundation (HADF,see box).Since then,
with the help of donor agencies, and the
Thai government we were able to esta-
blish schools for children as well adults in
the hill regions.
The general aim is to offer access to
the formal education system. H o w e v e r,
we also try to instil the children with a
deep sense of pride in their history and cul-
t u r e, so that they won’t blindly assimilate
the ways of mainstream society but change
in a positive way, based on their culture.
For example,we very carefully developed
a new syllabus integrating the knowledge
of the ethnic tribes with that of the Th a i
curriculum for the HADF-run schools.
We also concentrate on offering
training in sustainable agricultural
methods so that hill tribe farmers can
people—they were so pure in heart.Th e i r
spirit inspired me. I wanted to understand
their philosophy, their way of life in har-
mony with nature. I was enchanted by
the songs and folklore through which the
elders passed on their knowledge and
wisdom to the young.
The headman of the first village I
visited was like a father to me. He invited
me to stay, and even offered to build me
a hut, in exchange for teaching the chil-
dren and adults the Thai language. E v e n
though the Lizu and many other groups
have lived in Thai territory for genera-
t i o n s,very few spoke the language.Th e y
were so far removed,geographically and
c u l t u r a l l y, from the mainstream.We made
an agreement.Until they could speak for
t h e m s e l v e s, I would serve as an interme-
d i a r y, a bridge between the hill tribes,
the Thai government and wider society.
What kind of problems were the hill tribes
f a c i n g ?
At that time, nearly half of the hill
tribes didn’t even have Thai citizenship.
As a result, they didn’t have any legal
rights to the land they had been cultiva-
ting for years. The increasing demand
for forestland was pitting them against
Thai authorities who were declaring a
growing number of forest regions as
nature reserves in order to protect the
environment.
There were no roads, s c h o o l s, h o s-
pitals or public services in the hill regions.
The illiteracy rate was about 90 per cent
and the birth rate in the highlands was
almost three times higher than that of
the lowlands. Infant mortality was almost
d o u b l e. In short, they were the most
disadvantaged among the disadvantaged
in the country.And yet,even though they
were deprived of basic amenities, the hill
tribes never thought that they were under-
privileged because nature provided for
all their needs, including medicine.
We ren’t there accusations that the hill
tribes were involved in opium cultivation?
For generations, tribes like the Lizu,
the Hmong and others grew opium as
part of their cultural tradition. E l d e r s
would sometimes smoke during family or
community gatherings. It was also used
for a variety of traditional medicines.
These people rely on their own resources.
But I can assure you that a hill tribe never
got rich by growing opium for outsiders.
H o w e v e r, the situation changed
when increasing Western demand for
opium (to produce heroin) triggered
illegal trafficking of the drug from the 
so-called Golden Tr i a n g l e, the area bor-
dering Thailand,Burma and Laos.
Near the Myanmar frontier, Akhas slash and burn the land before planting crops.
1 . A c c o rding to the Hill Area Development Fo u n-
d a t i o n ,a p p r oximately one million hill tribe people
live in T h a i l a n d ’s mountainous northern and wes-
tern border regions. About 65 per cent of the hill
population belong to two major ethnic groups–the
Karen and Hmong tribes. Other tribes like the
L a h u ,A k h a ,M i e n ,H ’t i n ,L i z u ,Lawa and Khamu
make up the rest of the population.

“ a life in the hills ”
abandon slash and burn tactics.The new
t e c h n i q u e s, apart from preventing soil
e r o s i o n , revitalizes the land.
The environmental groups were
right to highlight the problem of defo-
r e s t a t i o n . H o w e v e r, instead of offering
a l t e r n a t i v e s, the government just began
evicting the tribes from forest areas.
Our aim isn’t simply to introduce new or 
foreign techniques but to adapt and 
revitalize traditional agricultural prac-
t i c e s. For example, the Karen tribes
continue to follow an age-old rotation
s y s t e m . Instead of clearing land entirely,
they simply cut the branches from the
bottom of trees. They then rotate bet-
ween swathes of land to grow a single
c r o p,which gives the soil a chance to reju-
v e n a t e.
This kind of training project seems to be
part of a larger struggle to strike a balance
between various groups depending on the
same limited re s o u rc e s. Can you describe
the ongoing conflict between the hill tribes
living in the re g i o n ’s watershed area and
those in the lowlands? 
In tropical countries like Th a i l a n d ,
we depend on a delicate natural process
whereby forests absorb rainwater and
release it into the rivers.If you reduce the
f o r e s t ,the rain just runs off the land and is
wasted instead of flowing into the rivers.S o
we must take immediate steps to preserve
the remaining forestland in the watershed
a r e a .Apart from being the main sources
of water, the watershed area is also very
supportive of many ecosystems.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y, only the hill tribes
living in the watershed region are
expected to preserve the forest while
those living downstream in the lowlands
and cities are not showing any signs of
changing their ways. In fact, they use
more water than people living in the ups-
tream areas. It is totally unfair on the part
of the authorities to impose restrictions
on the hill tribes and force them to relo-
cate far away from their region in an
effort to save forests.
How can we expect the hill tribes
alone to make all the sacrifices? Preser-
ving the environment is the duty of eve-
ryone and if we do not want the hill tribes
to use the forest,we have to provide them
with alternatives.Th a t ’s why I insist on a
harmonious relationship between the
two sides.
In recent years, the Thai government has
been investing in development projects
for the northern re g i o n . What are the
results so far?
There are more roads, e l e c t r i c i t y
and other basic infrastructure in the hills
n o w. But far less has been invested in
education or environmental projects
because politicians derive few benefit s
from them. When companies bid for a
contract to build a new road, for example,
a commission is usually given to the poli-
tician involved.
As a result of the construction pro-
j e c t s, there is increasing contact between
the hill tribes and lowland Thais which
has led to a new set of problems. Th e
insular life of the hills made it easier to
create a shared vision of life in harmony
with nature. Now the hill tribes must
deal with the symbols of materialism.I n
a way, they face the same problems as
many developing countries.
Greater exposure to advertising
creates more greed.Young people in par-
ticular want to wear blue jeans, drive a
m o t o r cycle or a car, just like city people.
They no longer want to work the land but
simply make money.So many are migra-
ting to big cities, which creates a lot of
social tension. In the cities, they often
get involved in prostitution, for example,
and then return to the hills carrying
diseases like A I D S.
Little by little, cultural identity is
eroded by materialism.If this continues,
I am afraid that the culture of the hill
tribes could be lost forever. So we—the
hill tribes,NGOs and government—must
find ways of improving living conditions
and assuring the people similar rights to
lowlanders while retaining their specific
cultural identity.
You mention the need for land rights, y e t
many of these people don’t even have a
Thai passport. Why is citizenship such a
p ro b l e m ?
Due to political and economic rea-
sons many hill tribes from neighbouring
countries have been migrating to Th a i-
land for centuries.You must understand
that indigenous people in general don’t
feel bound by national borders.To begin
w i t h , they are often forced to move
because of political conflicts and envi-
ronmental needs.
Up until 1992,it was relatively easy
to obtain some kind of identity papers 
if you were born in Th a i l a n d . But the
government changed the laws, after 
large-scale migration into the area for
both political and economic reasons.
According to new rules,applicants should
prove that they and their parents were
born in Th a i l a n d .But  few of these people
possess birth certific a t e s. We must also
consider the plight of those not born in
the country. How can we send people
back to Burma where there is no justice? 
It is very complicated. The Th a i
government cannot grant citizenship to
everyone and is doing its best under the
present circumstances. The cross-border
migration also brings friction within the
tribal communities.For example,H m o n g
ethnic tribes in Thailand are finding it dif-
ficult to secure enough forest for their
own families. So when ethnic confli c t
began driving Hmong tribes from Laos
across the border, the Thai Hmong asso-
ciation told them that they should go back
to their country once the situation stabilizes.
The hill tribes of Thailand are a major tourist
a t t ra c t i o n . Have they pro fited from this?
Eco-tourism and cultural tourism
should improve understanding between
people from different parts of the world.O n
the contrary,the travel industry is exploiting
the hill tribes in Thailand without even rea-
lizing it. While the government earns
revenue by promoting tourism in the north,
hardly any of the money is invested back in
the region. Only the tour operators and a
few middlemen profit .
The tourists tend to treat the 
indigenous people as some kind of exotic
s p e c i m e n . Instead of coming to the hills to
take photos, they should learn to respect
the local people and their culture. In nor-
thern Th a i l a n d , boats carrying foreign
tourists often stop at Lahu and Karen vil-
lages along the Mekong River.Wh e n e v e r
a boat arrives, children start running in

Action Network. From Malaysia to the
Philippines and even Nigeria, t h e
struggle is in many ways the same.P e o p l e
need the rights to their lands and
resources—the right to earn a living with
nature. They need protection from the
multinationals, which plunder areas for
resources like timber, oil and minerals.
In the name of research, c o m p a n i e s
make millions by patenting the traditional
knowledge and medicines of indigenous
p e o p l e s. Now the tribes themselves are
being used for genetic research. In return,
the tribes get nothing. In Th a i l a n d , w e
have had some well-known cases of
exploitation of tribal medicines by We s t e r n
c o m p a n i e s.But due to legal complications
we could not do anything about the abuse.
We must also question government
policies for managing resources. Fo r
e x a m p l e, countries often declare forest
regions as protected areas, ignoring the
rights of indigenous peoples who have
been living there for hundreds of years.U p
until recently, the major environmental
campaigns and treaties did not look into
the problems of the indigenous people.
In the early 1990s, the United Nations
declared the International Decade for the
Wo r l d ’s Indigenous Peoples (1995-2004),
yet so far, it has not been successful.O n l y
a few countries have taken concrete steps
to recognize their rights.
The positive side, however, is that
groups internationally are co-ordinating
their efforts and learning from others’
e x p e r i e n c e. But the time has come to sit
down with bodies like the World Trade
Organization and the World Bank to
frankly discuss the world’s future. ■

A LIFE IN THE HILLS
In 1973, university students in Thailand sta-
ged mass demonstrations calling for demo-
cracy and an end to the country’s military dic-
t a t o r s h i p. In response, authorities closely
monitored all student activities inside the
c o u n t r y. Tuenjai Deetes’ work as a student
volunteer teacher in the hill village of Baan
Pangsa in northern Thailand was no excep-
t i o n . Undeterred by intimidation and sur-
v e i l l a n c e, Deetes pursued her mission with
determination.
In 1976 Deetes found herself in a similar
situation following a left-wing inspired stu-
dent revolt in the country, which was brutally
repressed after the military staged a coup in
October of that year. When authorities came
knocking on her door, she recalls telling them:
‘‘I believe in peace and non-violence and wish
to continue with my work for the hill tribes.’’
Though initially dubious,o f ficials allowed her
to pursue her work and Deetes went on to
win government support for her projects
soon after. On the other hand, she was alwa y s
cautious not to take sides in ethnic conflicts
or to confront directly the drug lords in the
sensitive border region.“We had to operate
with extreme care and tact without offen-
ding anyone.”
Deetes founded the Hill Area Development
Foundation (HADF) in 1986 to assist hill tribes
in dealing with problems ranging from envi-
ronmental management to social develop-
m e n t .To d a y, the HADF works in 27 hill villages
in the watershed area of the Mae Chan and
Mae Salong rivers on the Thai-Burmese border.
Slightly built,the 48-year-old Deetes travels
indefatigably from one hill village to another.
It requires extraordinary courage and convic-
tion for a Bangkok-born-and-raised girl to
give up the comforts of the big city for the
remote hill regions. Over the years, D e e t e s
has won enormous respect and admiration
from her peers, who recently elected her as a
senator after she stood as an independent
candidate in Chiang Rai, the capital of the
mountainous province in northern Thailand
where she works.
Deetes’ dedicated and selfless service has won
her many laurels, including the 1994 Goldman
Environmental Prize, given annually to grass-
roots environmental activists. During the 25th
anniversary of the United Nations Environ-
ment Programme in 1997, she was named as
one of “25 Women Leaders in A c t i o n ” for her
role in protecting the planet.
Despite her achievements, Deetes remains
modest and down to earth. In the coming
years she wants to train more volunteers to
work with the hill tribes and create a network
of organizations in the region. ‘‘I cannot
change the governments of the world on my
o w n . With small groups, we can change the
world and steer it in a positive direction,’’ says
the soft-spoken Deetes.Married with two chil-
d r e n , she now lives in Chiang Rai. ■

also come to the hills looking for sex tou-

take serious steps to ban this.
What is it like to work in Thailand for an
NGO championing the cause of indige-
nous peoples? What contacts do you have
with other NGOs abroad and what are the
issues involved?
Many people are questioning non-
governmental organizations in general.
They are often regarded as being in per-
petual opposition to the government.
Some groups and newspapers in Th a i l a n d
accuse the NGOs of selling the country’s
misery abroad in order to get foreign fun-
d i n g.In a country like Th a i l a n d ,I think the
main role of the NGO should be to offer
a voice to the disadvantaged.By offering
a different viewpoint, we can offer alter-
native perspectives on our society. I am
certain that most NGO workers realize
that they alone cannot achieve the mission.
They need co-operation from other parts
of the society.
I have learned a lot from working
with indigenous groups internationally,
particularly through the Rainforest
An Akha woman shops in Chiang Rai.
