Festival.
Tomás Gutiérrez Alea's
Strawberry and
Chocolate (Cuba,
1994), starring Jorge
Perugorria as the artist
(right) and Vladimir
Cruz as the student.
> Your latest film,
Strawberry and
Chocolate, tells about an
encounter between a
homosexual intellectual
and a member of the Cuban
communist youth
movement. Where did you
get the idea of looking at
the problem of
homosexuality in Cuba?
I read Senel Paz's* original story in
manuscript. What I wanted to show in
the film, and what I believe, is that the
problem is broader than just homo¬
sexuality. It's the idea of tolerance and
accepting other people. Basically the
film is the story of a youth, David, who
learns to become a man by tran¬
scending his limited vision of reality
when he comes into contact with a
social outcast.
> Were you surprised by the
film's success in Cuba?
I sincerely thought people would
like it because it's a moving human
story with a fair share of humour, and
because I was satisfied with my work.
But its success went beyond my
expectations.
But your film is pretty
hard on life in Cuba. At the
end your hero, Diego, even
decides to emigrate.
Weren't you afraid of
being labeled an "enemy of
the revolution"?
To my mind a society can go for¬
ward only if it is aware of its errors and
failings. Criticism is an ideal revolu¬
tionary weapon.
I How do you see your work
as a film-maker in a
nationalized system
compared to your
colleagues in Europe and
the United States?
Each system has its pros and cons.

But I would like to say that Cuban
cinema isn't a typical "state-run"
cinema. It is true that to make films you
have to go through the government-
controlled Cuban Film Institute. But the
Institute is run by open-minded cre¬
ators, not by civil servants. It Is not like
some other bureaucracies with which it
is more difficult to work. Here the state
monopoly on production may tend to
limit creative development, while under
a capitalist regime there is a risk that
producers who are only interested in
profits will go for sex-and-violence for¬
mula movies. On the other hand, it is
true that the absence of a monopoly
encourages the existence of indepen¬
dent directors and producers.
I Is there a crisis in the
Latin American cinema?
Latin American cinema is in a state
of permanent crisis because it is not in
control of distribution. Our films are
seen less in Latin America than in
Europe and even in the United States!
Cuba is an exception to the rule
with its Latin American Film Festival
and our San Antonio de los Baños
film school, which takes students
from all over Latin America. In addi¬
tion, the Cuban revolution has always
insisted on the importance of close
cultural ties with the rest of the conti-

nent. In Cuba you can see films from
Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela and
other Latin American countries, but
we are virtually the only country in that
position because the major distribu¬
tion circuits are controlled by transna¬
tional companies linked to the inter¬
ests of Hollywood producers.
But doesn't a fascination
with Hollywood also enter
into it?
It's true that American producers
have substantial resources at their dis¬
posal, but they also know how to
make attractive films and sell them
admirably. Good films, important films,
are also made elsewhere, but no one
can see them. When someone tells
me that if a film hasn't been suc¬
cessful it's because it isn't commercial,
I say, "Start by showing it in normal
conditions."
This doesn't mean competing with
Hollywood in special effects. We've
got to offer something else, another
kind of cinema that doesn't depend
on violence, special effects and the
sensational. Let's take advantage of
streamlined technical equipment to
make inexpensive quality films. That
can be done anywhere.
I Which film tradition do
you belong to?

Barravento (The
Turning Wind, Brazil,
1962), the first feature
film by Glauber Rocha
(1938-1981).
Our cinema is the heir of Italian
neorealism. After the.war we in Latin
America saw films shot with rudimen¬
tary equipment, sometimes even on
worn-out film stock, films like The
Bicycle Thief or Open City, which
broke away from the Hollywood pro¬
ductions we had got used to. It was a

Solanas's El Sur
(Argentina,
1988).
revelation, and we took to it very
quickly. It enabled us to solve the
problem of our still faltering film
industry, i.e. how to make films with
the resources at our disposal that
expressed our personality yet still
strove for the universal. So neorealism
was the starting point for all of us.
This doesn't mean that we are making
neorealist pictures today. That was a
moment in the history of the cinema, a
productive episode which has led on
to other things.
As for me, I think I am making more
analytical films, but I don't deny my
debt of gratitude, or my admiration, for
my neorealist teachers. I have also
been influenced by other film-makers
such as Luis Buñuel, to whom I feel
close in so many ways, and Jean-Luc
Godard with whom I find it harder to
identify but who has given me several
keys to cinematic expression.

Prize, 1991.
