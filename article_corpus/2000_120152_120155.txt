South A f rica recently announced that
it is ready to part with 1,500 ele-
phants which, it says, are destroying
trees that other species depend on for their
s u rv i val in the country ’s famous Kru g e r
N ational Pa r k . If there are no takers the
animals will be culled and their tusks
added to South A f ri c a ’s bu l ging ivo ry
stockpile.
The South A f rican offer highlights a
c ritical dilemma facing all those concern e d
with wildlife conservation:is it possible to
protect endangered species like elephants
and rhinoceros effectively if trade in wildlife
p r o d u c t s , e ven on a one-off basis, i s
a l l owed? South A f rica is one of many
African countries which argue that a lim-
ited trade in wildlife product stockpiles
should be allowed so that the proceeds can
be used to pay for conservat i o n . G ove rn-
ments and conservation groups that are
hostile to this approach claim that any kind
of sale will stimulate the illegal market,
encourage more poaching and ultimat e l y
push species such as elephants and rhino
closer to extinction.
The debate on this controversial issue
reaches a crescendo eve ry two or three
ye a rs at the Conference of the Pa rties to
the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES). The con-
vention has 151 member states which vote
at the conference on proposals to limit or
place an outright ban on intern ational trade
in species considered to be at risk (see box ,
p. 1 4 ) . At the CITES conference held in
Nairobi, Kenya, in April this year, calls to
lift the ban on trade in products such as
i vo ry, t u rtle shells and whales provo k e d
fierce debate.
While countries like Kenya and India
opposed lifting the ban on the ivo ry trade,
Japan and Norway wanted the ban on whaling
lifted because, they said, the stocks of some
whales on the endangered list are healthy
enough to withstand commercial harve s t i n g .
After long deliberat i o n s , the CITES part i e s
a greed to maintain the existing trade ban on
i vo ry products, t u rtle shells and whale meat
for the next three ye a rs.
Conservationists no longer oppose the
idea of wildlife being exploited per se. I f
properly managed, they say, wildlife can
provide food for impoverished rural popu-
lations and wildlife-based tourism can be
an important source of income.
H owe ve r , the sustainable use of wildlife
means striking a delicate balance.“ We only
s u p p o rt using wildlife where it is benefic i a l
to both the local community and to the
ecosystem,” says Gordon Sheppard of the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
“It is oversimplistic to ban trade,” says
Jon Hutton, director of A f rica Resources
Trust (ART ) , an NGO invo l ved in com-
munity conservation schemes in southern
A f ri c a . “ We need to assess the trade-offs
and come to a rational decision. We have
to weigh up the profits from trade that can
be reinvested in wildlife conservat i o n ,
through funding government law enforce-
ment or indirectly through providing an
income for local communities, against the
possible costs, such as an increased risk of
poaching.
“In much of A f ri c a , wildlife represents a
net cost. It can kill people and damage crops
and is therefore eradicat e d ,either deliberat e l y
or gradually by exclusion. More and more
land is being conve rted to agri c u l t u r e ,e ven if
it is marginal for live s t o c k , because rural peo-
ple often have no altern at i ve .A RT  is invo l ve d
in schemes which return wildlife ow n e rship to
fa rm e rs. They then have a choice betwe e n
c attle and crops or wildlife, and in many
c a s e s , they choose the second.Wildlife can
be sold three times: to touri s t s , to sport
h u n t e rs , and finally as ivo ry and hides. T h e
sale of wildlife products often brings in the
most reve n u e .The sale of ivo ry and hides for
example represents 80 per cent of the value of
an elephant.To u rism can bring in reve n u e ,
but most of the profits are made by intern a-
tional tour operat o rs and not by local com-
m u n i t i e s. S p o rt hunting on the other hand
can bring in enormous revenue for the local
community and it can be carried out in areas
t h at may not be suited to touri s m .”
While the “ n o n - c o n s u m p t i ve use” o f
species for tourism is accepted by most
wildlife organizat i o n s ,some are against  “ c o n-
s u m p t i ve use”—the killing of animals for
food or profit . Animal we l fare organizat i o n s
b e l i e ve that it is almost impossible to exploit
animals without severely affecting their pop-
u l at i o n s.“In pri n c i p l e , it is a nice idea,” s ay s
Sarah Tyack of the Intern ational Fund for
Animal We l fare (IFAW ) , “ but there are too
m a ny examples of where it has fa i l e d .”
Rhino revenue
In practice, e x p e rts say managing sus-
tainable use of a species can be ve ry diffic u l t
because wildlife needs and animal behav-
iour pat t e rns have to be carefully balanced
with human needs.Some species such as the
h awksbill turtle (see page 16), can easily be
ove r e x p l o i t e d ,and uncontrolled tourism can
s e verely affect some species. In Kenya ’s
famed Masai Mara reserve , for example, s c i-
entists found that the hunting success of
lions was reduced by a heavy inflow of
t o u ri s t s. Large groups of tourist vans tend
to gather around the cats and frighten off
their prey. “The key to using wildlife sus-
tainably is good management but in many
c o u n t ries the resources or expertise are sim-
ply not ava i l a b l e ,” s ays Sheppard.
South A f rica provides a good example of
the sustainable use of an endangered species.

The decision to strictly limit or outrightly ban trading in endangered species regularly puts
governments and conservationists before a critical dilemma

“The key to using wildlife
s u s tainably is good
management but in many
countries the resources 
or expertise are simply not
a v a i l a b l e . ”

The A f rican white rhinoceros is one of the
most endangered animals on earth but South
A f ri c a , as home to 80 per cent of the esti-
m ated 8,500 animals remaining in the wild,
has plenty. Well protected from poaching,
South A f ri c a ’s rhino population is gr ow i n g .
“ N u m b e rs could double in a decade,” s ay s
the World Conservation Union’s (IUCN)
Rhino Specialist Group,“ but only if there is
s u f ficient new land for surplus animals.”
The South African government argues
that if it were allowed to export rhino
h o rn , c u rrently banned under the
C I T E S , the revenue generated wo u l d
help to pay for rhino conservation.What
is more,profits from rhino horn would act
as an incentive for private landholders
and communities to maintain wild areas
for rhino conservation.
South A f rica charges a trophy fee for
rhino hunting, which generated $24 mil-
lion between 1968 and 1996, when the
c o u n t ry ’s white rhino population quadru-
p l e d . R e venue from hunting finances the
high cost of protecting rhinos from
p o a c h e rs , which can be as much as $1,000
per km2 per ye a r.
The interest in rhino has also helped
fund national parks.When protected from
p o a c h i n g, rhino populations can increase to
a level where they are too numerous to sur-
vive in limited park areas.To keep popula-
tions within ecological limits, l i ve rhino are
sold to pri vate rhino sanctuari e s. I n
KwaZulu-Natal, sales of live rhino, which
can fetch up to $30,000 per head, g e n e r at e d
a turn over of $1.57 million in 1998,and last
ye a r ’s rhino sales provided about 10 per
cent of the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Con-
s e rvation Serv i c e ’s operating bu d g e t . “ I n
a time of declining gove rnment spending on
c o n s e rvat i o n ,” s ays Martin Brooks, h e a d
of Scientific Services with Kwa Z u l u - N at a l
N ature Conservation Serv i c e , “wildlife sales
h ave been a vital source of revenue for con-
servation.”
H owe ve r , other A f rican stat e s , w h i c h
do not have sufficient funds or staff to tackle
p o a c h i n g, argue that any legal trade in rhino
horn will stimulate the illegal market and
lead to heavy poaching.
For example, people living in Damara-
land in nort h west Namibia are against lifting
the ban on trade in rhinos.When the regi o n ’s
rhino population was dwindling in the early
1990s due to illegal poaching, the Save the
Rhino Tru s t , a UN-sponsored gr o u p, s t a rt e d
a project which encouraged local popula-
tions to benefit from rhino through eco-
t o u ri s m .The project has been successful in
g e n e r ating revenue for the local community,
and former poachers have even been
r e c ruited as rhino trackers for touri s t s.
“ We worked with the communities and
they saw that the rhino were wo rth more to
them alive than dead,” says Simon Pope,
who worked on the project. “The people
worked hard to save their rhino but were
very worried about international trade in
rhino horn being allowe d . They believe d
that it would encourage poachers to come
and take away their live l i h o o d .” U n p r o-
tected by park rangers , rhinos on com-
munal lands would be especially vulner-
able to increased poaching.
Ja p a n , which strongly opposed boosting
trade restrictions at the recent CITES con-
f e r e n c e , argued that complete protection of
endangered species would be detri m e n t a l
to national economies and communities
dependent on wild species for their live l i-
Hides and other wildlife products on sale at a market in Laos.

h o o d s. D u ring the conference, Japan and
N o r way aggr e s s i vely lobbied for removal of
the Minke and Grey whales from the
endangered species list.
It is estimated that there are more than
a million Minke whales. Japan and Norway
argue that the population is healthy enough
to allow a sustainable harve s t . H owe ve r ,
many conservationists insist that the other
great whale species have not yet recovered
from centuries of commercial slaughter and
that a limited trade in Minke whale meat
could not be regulated well enough to pre-
vent the illegal hunting and sale of meat
from these protected species.
Changing
consumer habits
W h at hard evidence exists to show that
limited trade in wildlife products might
s t i m u l ate consumer demand and lead to
increased poaching? In 1997, the CITES
conference sanctioned the one-off sale of
ivory stockpiles from Africa to Japan as an
e x p e ri m e n t . About 60 tonnes of ivo ry we r e
s o l d .Two ye a rs later A f rican gove rn m e n t s ,
including Kenya, and a number of inter-
n ational conservation organizations quoting
independent studies, argued that poaching
and the movement of illegal ivo ry stocks had
increased as a result of this one-off sale.
There are neve rtheless questions about
whether trends in poaching and the illegal
market can be inferred from studies which,
due to paucity of funds, are often weak in
their methodology and focus on limited
a r e a s. “Independent studies from non-gov-
e rnmental organizations can be unreliable,”
s ays Sabri Zain of T R A F F I C , an intern a-
tional organization set up by the IUCN and
WWF to monitor intern ational trade in
w i l d l i f e .To help to fill this gap, the European
Union has promised to donate four million
Euros ($4 million) to monitor elephant
poaching and the illegal trade in ivo ry.
Another key problem is that of enforc-
ing intern ational trade bans and keeping
tabs on regulated sales. “Tiger poaching
for bones for traditional Chinese medicine,
as well as for skins, remains a gr ave threat ,”
s ays Peter Ja c k s o n , chair of the IUCN’s
C at Specialist Group. “ U n f o rt u n at e l y
e f f e c t i ve measures to control or reduce ille-
gal trade are seldom enforced in most
range countri e s , despite resolutions by the
CITES Conference of the Pa rt i e s.”
A d vo c ates of trade argue that tighter
controls simply incite smugglers to become
more sophisticated and drive illegal trade
further underground. Furthermore, some
wildlife deri vat i ves are almost impossible
to detect. R aw ivo ry might be difficult to
conceal but tiger bone can be pow d e r e d
and rolled into cigarettes or boiled dow n
into gelatine.
M e a n w h i l e ,c o n s e rvationists have been
a c t i ve in curtailing demand for some
wildlife products. Education programmes
in China have encouraged consumers to
reject tiger bone remedies and an interna-
tional campaign is currently underway to
highlight the plight of the Tibetan antelope,
which is in danger of being hunted to
extinction for its fine fur, used to make
highly sought after shahtoosh shawls.
C o n s e rvationists have also co-operat e d
with Chinese medicinal practitioners to fin d
a l t e rn at i ves to tiger bone and rhino horn ,
which are used in traditional medicines.
Mole rat bone is now being promoted in
China as an altern at i ve to tiger bone and
there is some evidence of a reduction in the
use of tiger-based medicines. Less than five
per cent of Asian consumers surve yed in
Hong Kong, Japan and the United Stat e s
said that they had actually used medicine
containing tiger part s.
Declining resources
for conservation
Trade bans should probably be gi ve n
more time to see if they can be made more
e f f e c t i ve through intern ational pressure on
g ove rnments and educating consumers. “ A
trade ban can only be as effective as the
n ational measures taken to stop illegal hunt-
ing and trade, and the efforts made to enlist
the invo l vement of gove rnments and con-
s u m e rs ,” s ays Steven Broad, director of
T R A F F I C .
But some argue that trade or no trade,
time is running out for wildlife. “ T h e
biggest single threat to wildlife is the
d e s t ruction of habitat ,” s ays Simon Riet-
bergen of IUCN.The figures are alarm i n g :
we have already removed or seri o u s l y
degraded 80 per cent of the planet’s forest
cover and 50 per cent of the world’s wet-
l a n d s. “Lack of resources and declining
g ove rnment budgets for conservation are
leaving many parks without adequate pro-
tection,” says Rietbergen. No matter how
effective a trade ban, it cannot slow down
the current rate of habitat loss or pay for
wildlife protection. Trade which has the
potential to save more wild areas and pay
for their protection may ultimately be the
preferred option. ■
