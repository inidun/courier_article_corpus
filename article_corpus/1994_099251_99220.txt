The
fundamentalists
and science
by Faouzia Charfi
I In several Arab countries fundamen¬
talist students are in the majority in
scientific institutions in the universities,
especially in the engineering faculties. This
is because the exact sciences can be more
easily dissociated than the human sciences
from the humanist context in which they
developed.
How can rejection of Western values be
reconciled with the necessary acceptance of
the scientific revolutions experienced by
the West? The answer is, by accepting only
their technological contributions. Funda¬
mentalists prefer technology, which leaves
little room for doubt, to science that incites
to reflexion. And they make skilful use of
technology. During a pre-election meeting
in 1991, the Algerian fundamentalist leaders
did not hesitate to use laser technology to
write the sacred formula "Allah is great"
on a cloud.
Fundamentalists only accept what is not
likely to contest their interpretation of the
religious texts. At the end of the twentieth
century, it is difficult not to recognize the
progress made in physics and biology, for
example. But it is possible to accept only the
implications of biological research for med¬
ical development; the theory of the evolution
of species does not need to be taught. From
progress in physics they willingly accept
the remarkable development of the means of
communication but are ill at ease with the
finite value of the speed of light	
In the name of an unavoidable reference
to the sacred, scientific knowledge is muti¬
lated, curbing the cultural and scientific
development of Islamic countries where
today scientific thought is less free than it
was during certain periods of the Middle
Ages.
