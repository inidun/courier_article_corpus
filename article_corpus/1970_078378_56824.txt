^B^r NE of the intriguing Euro¬
pean archaeological discoveries of
recent times, which has raised more
questions than it has answered, is that
of an 8,000 year old settlement at
Lepenski Vir ("the whirlpool of Lepe-
na") on the Yugoslav bank of the Dan¬
ube which forms the frontier with
Romania about 175 miles east of Bel¬
grade.
It came to light in the course of
salvage archaeology in an area due
to be flooded by a new dam. In spring
representatives of the govern¬
ments of Romania and Yugoslavia
together laid the foundation stone of
the Djerdap dam which the two coun¬
tries were to build jointly in the scenic
splendours of the Iron Gates, a moun¬
tain passage of the Danube where,
until 1896, massive boulders had
impeded the course of navigation. The
banks of the Danube would, at this
point, be engulfed by the waters of
a vast reservoir lake.
Dragoslav Srejovic, a young lecturer
at the Belgrade University Faculty of
Philosophy, believed that this area
might be the site of an ancient culture
that could provide the link between
mesolithic times and the later neolithic
culture of Starcevo. Starcevo Is the
oldest neolithic culture of the Balkans
dating back to 5000 B.C.
Immediate action was called for; it
would be a race against the rising
flood waters like that undertaken by
archaeological teams during Unesco's
campaign to save the Nubian monu¬
ments from the Nile, though of course
on a much more limited scale.
A special committee, headed by
Professor Lazar Trifunovic of the Bel¬
grade National Museum, gave Dra¬
goslav Srejovic the task of attempting
to uncover the secrets hidden under
the banks of the Danube.
In July 1965, after making a num¬
ber of preliminary probes, Srejovic
pitched his tent on the banks of the
river by the turbulent rapids of Lep¬
enski Vir. He knew that, throughout
the ages, men had been dependent
upon the Danube. Century after cent¬
ury they had cast their nets there

LEPENSKI VIR
Europe's oldest settlement
on the banks of the Danube
achieving magnificent catches of fish
trapped by the turbulence of the
waters.
It was the turbulence of the river
at this point that had first caught
Srejovic's attention seven years earlier
in 1958. Would not other men, even
before the inhabitants of the Starcevo
era, have throught of establishing
themselves on this favoured site?
With a small team he began an
investigation in depth below the Star¬
cevo era layers which were spread
over the district. One day their picks
hit a solid reddish-coloured object and
the archaeologist proceeded to clear
the ground around it. The reddish
colour persisted, marking out a trape¬
zoidal shape. Could this be the
foundations laid by men who had lived
there long before their descendants
of the Starcevo era?
Eleven trapeziums were soon unco¬
vered and carbon 14 testing confirmed
Srejovic's speculations. The culture
of Lepenski Vir was found to go back
to nearly 60 centuries before the
Christian era earlier than any other
settlement unearthed thus far in
Europe.
Lepenski Vir is situated in eastern
Serbia on the Yugoslav-Romanian
border in a tiny area, itself in the
shape of a trapezium, 170 metres long
by 50 metres wide (560 ft by 165 ft).
Its total area, therefore, is no greater
than that of a small hamlet. But, as
we shall see, the importance of a
discovery cannot always be judged
from the size of the site on which
it is made.
Protected by thick forests and rocky
escarpments, the cluster of structures
was built on a small, clear stretch of
beach and, for a long time, the river
remained the sole means of access.
Considered in the context of its sur¬
roundings, Lepenski Vir .is but an
insignificant detail on the vast canvas
of the Iron Gates, the extraordinary
ravine that forms a little world on its
own.
Facing the settlement, on the Roma¬
nian bank of the river, theTreskavac
mountain rises sheer and barren to
a height of 679 metres (2,230 ft). The
entire mountain has a curious trape¬
zoid shape and its outline stands out
sharply against the sky.
It is curious to observe that both
the shape of the tiny valley and the
foundations of the dwellings unearthed
all have this same trapezoidal form.
This has led to the conjecture that the
natural trapezoid shapes directly inspir¬
ed the men of Lepenski Vir in their
architecture and that its geometric
shape became a symbol and pattern of
special significance.
Four layers, totalling about ten feet
in depth, have been unearthed thus
far. This super-imposition of layers
makes it possible to establish that
Lepenski Vir was in constant devel¬
opment for a period of over 1,000
years, from 5800 to 4700 B.C. The
topmost layer, which is also the most
recent (dating from 4850 to 4700 B.C.)

On this stretch of
river bank Yugoslav
excavation teams
painstakingly dug out
a three-yard thick
deposit. The first
remains they uncovered
were those of a
culture settlement,
dating back to
5000 B.C. Beneath
these lay the
foundations of homes
and numerous artefacts
belonging to a still
earlier culture. One
of the most striking
features of the
Lepenski Vir
excavations are the
many art objects
revealed (see

MAN
FISH
OR DOODLE?
The sculptors of Lepenski Vir respected the basic shape of their raw material stones
rounded and polished by the swirling waters of the Danube. The examples above and
below right have been variously Interpreted as representing fish, human heads
or as being simply geometric doodles like those executed on bone by the hunters
of post-glacial Europe a few millenia earlier.
The Lepenski Vir people have been referred to as a-ceramlc
or pre-ceramlc and the few sherds of pottery found on
the site (above) have been ascribed to the Starcevo era,
previously the oldest known neolithic culture of the Balkans.
However the oldest piece of pottery found at
Lepenski Vir has been put at 5600 B.C., thus ante-dating
the Starcevo culture. The incised decorations on a grey
sandstone plaque (below) may represent hunting scenes.

LEPENSKI VIR (Continued)
consists of a light soil of black ash
and has two levels of dwellings, A
and B, in which vestiges of the Star¬
cevo culture are mingled with those
of lower levels. In the humus of
level B are to be found tombs of
historic and prehistoric eras which
suggest that the more recent genera¬
tions continued to use them as their
traditional burial places.
By their colour, structure and their
remains, the deeper layers (dated
4950, 5600 to 5000, and 5800 B.C.
respectively) are clearly distinguish¬
able from the most recent layer. Lep¬
enski Vir, therefore, offers evidence
of two types of prehistoric cultures
the most recent overlapping with that
of Starcevo and the older one being
a new phenomenon, the unexpected
revelation of European pre-history.
Like the traditional village, Lepenski
Vir had its central square as a meeting
place and streets whose pattern chang¬
ed from era to era. The houses,
about a hundred of which have been
uncovered, were often built one on
top. of another in succeeding centuries,
since the tiny site of the settlement
severely restricted its habitable area.
The houses had a solid floor made
of a chalk-based mortar of a reddish
colour covered with a pink or white
facing. The walls and roof consisted
of skins stretched over supporting
poles and an overhead beam. The
dwellings were in the shape of a
trapezium with the roof sloping shar¬
ply towards the shortest side and
the entrance on the opposite and
largest side. At the entrance to each
house two threshold stones were
placed in such a way as to direct the
dwellers towards the side walls so
that they would not, in the dark,
stumble against the centrally sited
hearth built of chalk blocks or clay.
Around the hearth was placed a
sacrificial altar with sculptures and a
large rounded stone half buried in
the ground. This may have been a
symbol of the sun for it was often
embellished with a design reminiscent
of the sun's rays.
Several hearths were surrounded
by thin flagstones in the shape of
isosceles triangles, the meaning of
which is unknown. It has been sug¬
gested that they may symbolize the
link between man and his dead ances¬
tors. In several buildings were found
tools, weapons, including clubs mea¬
suring 25 to 50 cm. (10 to 18 in.) in
length, and ornaments (all these
objects were made of bone or stone),
as well as a few sherds of pottery
dating back to 5000 to 5600 B.C.
The pottery has been assumed to
be that of the Starcevo period, since
the excavators have referred to the
Lepenski Vir people as a-ceramic and
pre-ceramic. The oldest dating of
5600 B.C., however, which antedates
the Starcevo era, has posed a new
puzzle for the archaeologist.
Another surprise was furnished by
the curved support stones that held

The people of
Lepenski Vir buried their
dead inside their houses.
Skeletons (right) were
found lying beside the
hearth looking, in the
words of the excavators,
"as if they had fallen
asleep with their hands
resting under their heads."
Excavators found only
skeletons without skulls
or else human skulls
without skeletons.
The skulls show
that Lepenski Vir
man had big brow ridges.
Stag antlers were placed
in the graves with
the human remains.
The rectangular
hearths (right) found
inside each house
measure about 1 metre
by 50 cms (3 ft by
18 ins) and are surrounded
by curious "A"-shaped
settings. According to
certain archaeologists
these may have had a
symbolic meaning, but
others think they served a
utilitarian purpose as
sockets for struts
supporting cooking
utensils.

the poles forming the frames of the
walls and fulfilled a function similar
to the metal sleeve joints that modern
campers use in frame tents.
All but four of the houses faced
towards the west with the largest side
turned towards Mount Treskavac in
such a way that the prevailing east
wind did not blow through the entran¬
ces but was deflected along the sides
of the houses. With its carefully
planned and thought out construction,
its standardized workmanship, its use
of applied geometry and the ease of
movement allowed for in the interiors
of the houses, Lepenski Vir Is almost
a "modern community" of pre-history.
The Lepenski Vir people were wild
fruit gatherers, hunters and fishermen.
But it is possible that before their
culture came to an end, they cleared
some tracts for a rudimentary form of
agriculture and cattle-rearing.
It has not been possible to reconsti¬
tute the rites practised in the home
sanctuaries. Fish, stags and dogs
were sacrificed. These are the only
animals depicted in the sculptures and
remains of all three have been found
near the altars.
The Lepenski Vir people were buri¬
ed in their houses. They lay in graves
beside the fire, in Srejovic's words,
"as though they had fallen asleep
with their hands resting under their
heads."
In the oldest clusters of dwellings
excavators found no skeletons but
only parts of skulls. If we accept
that the layers in which these remains
were buried had never previously
been disturbed, it seems probable that
only the heads of the dead were
preserved. Subsequent generations
followed the same custom, but in later
periods the inhabitants sometimes
buried the whole skeleton and some¬
times preserved "the myth of the
head" by burying skeletons without
skulls, or skulls without skeletons.
The antlers of a stag were invariably
placed in the tomb beside the human
remains and sometimes the animal's
complete skull as well.
The sculptures uncovered at Lep¬
enski Vir are of great interest. Most
of the human and animal heads are
life size, a remarkable fact consider¬
ing that all previous prehistoric sculp¬
tures have been miniature in size.
The sculptor of Lepenski Vir took
for his raw material large stones that
had been rounded and polished by
the action of the river. He infused
life into them without altering their
fundamental structure. Dragoslav
Srejovic believes that the artist was
obliged to respect the original form of
the stone, which was an object of cult
worship.
Thanks to the help afforded by the
government of Yugoslavia, Lepenski
Vir will be saved from the flood
waters. Soon the settlement is to be
transferred to a nearby site out of
reach of the new water line of the
Danube.

THE MOURNFUL FACES
OF LEPENSKI VIR
Eight thousand years ago,
the men of Lepenski Vir
produced these carved images,
using as their raw material
the rounded, yellow sandstones
they took from the river bed.
Some thirty of these strange
sculptures have been discovered
ranged around the hearths
of the dwellings. The heads
vary in size from 57 cm.
(almost 2 ft.), shown on left,
to fist sized or smaller figures.
Most are life size. Bizarre figure,
top left, evokes both man and fish.
