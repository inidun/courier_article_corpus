CUBA DEFENDS 
T HE TURT L ESHELL TRA DE

The protection of animal 
species is not necessarily 
incompatible with responsible 
commercial exploitation, 
says Cuba

E ve ry ye a r , thousands of haw k s b i l l
t u rtles (Eretmochelys imbri c at a) are
caught and killed despite the exis-
tence of the 1975 conve n t i o n ( C I T E S ,s e e
b ox p. 14) banning the sale of their shells,
which are the source of a hard, c o m p a c t ,
translucent substance much in demand for
making combs, j e we l l e ry and eye - g l a s s
f r a m e s. The trade ban has contri buted to
h u rting Caribbean fishing communities
t h at for centuries have lived off the turt l e s
and their protein-rich meat and eggs.
Cuba is no exception. B e t ween 1960 and
1 9 9 0 , some 150,000 hawksbills (about 5,000
a year) were caught along Cuba’s coastline,
which accounts for a third of the species’
nesting places in the Cari b b e a n .
Ten ye a rs ago, Cuba introduced fis h i n g
r e g u l ations that allowed co-operat i ves in only
t wo villages,one on the Isla de la Juventud (off
the south coast) and one in the eastern prov i n c e
of Camagüey, to catch a maximum of 500
h awksbills a year but banned hunting them
d u ring the mating season or catching speci-
mens with shells less than 66 centimetres
a c r o s s.The turtle meat is then distri buted to
a u t h o rised fishing co-operat i ves and to Cuban
h o s p i t a l s. C atching hawksbills is banned in
the rest of the country and punishable by a
fine of 5,000 pesos ($250) in a society where
people earn only about $10 a month. A l s o,
s ays José A l b e rto A l va r e z , an expert at the
Environmental Inspection Centre (CICA),
“if fishermen poachers are found with their
b o at , the boat is confiscat e d . This is the
harshest penalty under our fishing law.”
Cuba signed the CITES bu t , like Ja p a n ,
its main client, opted out of the clause deal-
ing with haw k s b i l l s. This allowed both
c o u n t ries to continue trade in the shells. I n
1993,however, Japan signed the hawksbill
clause and ceased to be a bu ye r. Since then,
Cuba has stockpiled 6.9 tonnes of haw k s b i l l

shells in a warehouse in the fishing village of
Cojimar,near Havana.
CICA says the hawksbill turtle is not in
danger of extinction along Cuba’s coastline,
and that regulated hunting helps local fis h i n g
c o m m u n i t i e s.But the trade ban means Cuba’s
stock of shells is steadily gr ow i n g . At the
CITES conference held in Nairobi in A p ri l
2 0 0 0 , Cuba sought permission to sell its cur-
rent $5 million stockpile to Japan and then to
sell the shells of up to 500 hawksbills a ye a r.
The proposal narr owly failed to win the nec-
e s s a ry two-thirds majori t y.
A regional 
programme
C I C A ’s director Silvia A l varez says “ t h e
votes in favour were significant because they
were based on technical evidence,while those
against were based on emotion, because the
t u rt l e , like dolphins, whales and elephants,
are creatures people adore.
“A catch of 500 a year isn’t ve ry large
at all because surveys show that there are
about 15,000 nesting female haw k s b i l l
t u rtles in Cuban wat e rs ,” she say s. “ We ’r e
defending the principle of a regulat e d
trade in them, with the proceeds going to
the communities that catch them and to
p ay for more research into the species.”
She accepts that the rest of the wo r l d ’s
refusal to back the Cuban position ari s e s
from  fear that the sale of the shells in Ja p a n
would encourage a black market in them,
but adds that Cuba “takes quite the opposite
v i e w.There is a black market in the shells
precisely because selling them is totally for-
bidden.”
Cuban scientists say that in the area
b e t ween Puerto Rico and the V i r gin Islands—
c o u n t ries that contain only one per cent of
the total hawksbill habitat—about 2,000 tur-
tles are caught illegally eve ry ye a r.“ We should
h ave a regional programme for controlled
fis h i n g,” s ays Ms A l va r e z .
A Caribbean-wide group was set up in
1997 to look into the state of the species. I t s
m e m b e rs include Cuba, A n t i g u a - B a r bu d a ,
St Lucia,St Kitts-Nevis,St V i n c e n t ,Tri n i d a d
and Tobago and Suri n a m e . Ve n e z u e l a ,
Colombia and the Dominican Republic have
expressed interest in joining.
M e a n w h i l e ,Cuba continues with its pro-
gramme of catching an annual maximum of
500 turt l e s.“ We ’ ve got two more ye a rs until
the next CITES meeting to show that what
we ’re doing is a good thing,” s ays Ms A l va r e z ,
who thinks “the main obstacle is the notion
t h at the only way to protect natural resources
is not to use them.” ■
