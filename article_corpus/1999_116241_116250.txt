L a g o s: the survival 
of the determined

It’s rush-hour near the stadium in Lagos where
N i g e ria has just lost a football mat c h . Streams of
young men run through the street to let off steam
as crowds dive into the tangle of battered yellow
minibuses. A dozen passengers pack into one bus,
and the dri ver grinds into gear, lurching at full
throttle to gain a six-inch lead over his competitor.
The side-view mirror has to be pulled in for the bu s
to squeeze through.Girls balancing bags of water on
their heads edge their way through the traffic to ve n d
their wares.Toilet brushes,cutting shears,smoked
fish, hankies,inflatable globes and even a steering
wheel are sold by boys as the coil of traffic becomes
ever more ensnared.But the action never stops for
a moment.That’s Lagos—a city that moves, mira-
culously, against the odds.
A mighty 
magnet
I t ’s difficult to find the centre, let alone the
l o gi c, of this city reputed to be the most dangerous
in A f ri c a .Three bridges connect about 3,500 square
kilometres of lagoon, i s l a n d s , swamp and the main-
l a n d , where unlit highways run past canyons of
s m o u l d e ring garbage before giving way to dirt
streets we aving through 200 slums, their sewe rs
running with raw waste. So much of the city is a
my s t e ry. No one even knows for sure the size of the
p o p u l at i o n — o f ficially it’s 6 million, but most expert s
estimate it at 10 million (see box)—let alone the
number of murders each ye a r , the rate of HIV
infection or the quantities of drugs that pass through
the port of A p a p a . C o rruption is endemic at all
levels. A bus driver doesn’t even slow down to slip
a few bills into a policeman’s open palm to avoid
being pulled ove r.The rich barricade themselves on
two fortress islands, removed from the mainland,
where two-thirds of the population live below the
poverty line.
But to look upon Lagos simply as the archetypal
urban nightmare is to miss the point. L a g o s , as the
e c o n o m i c, cultural and, until 1991, political powe-
rhouse of mighty Nigeri a ,i s , for all its fa u l t s , also a
magnet pulling some 300,000 people eve ry ye a r.T h e
streets aren’t all paved with concrete, let alone gold,
but Lagos appears as an El Dorado in the pove rt y -
s t ricken countryside where work can be found and
dreams of the good life can come true. In reality,
most find it a daily struggle to make ends meet, ye t
an iron-clad conviction that those dreams will mat e-
rialize one day gives Lagos a vibrant beat.
If you ask Lagosins about the glue that holds
their city together they speak of endurance. Fo r
s o m e , it is a capacity to withstand sufferi n g .T h i s
helps to explain the much talked-about boom in
e va n g e l i s m .“ People are seeking spiritual solutions
to their economic problems,” s ays Pastor Ebenezer
B a b a j i d e , who opened his Jesus Generation Gospel
Church last year in the annex of a nurs e ry school.
But there is a dri ve that goes beyond simply the will
to survive.

Lagos is a city where near anarchy prevails rather than government. Lagosins respond 
to the chaos by relying on their own ingenuity to get by
On the Apapa-Oshodi
Expressway, a typical traffic
jam—locally known 
as a “go-slow”.

The South’s urban re v o l u t i o n
“In Nigeri a , there is a spirit to aggr e s s i vely pur-
sue the good life,which you wo n ’t find elsewhere on
the continent,” s ays Felix Morka, e xe c u t i ve director
of the non-gove rnmental Social and Economic
Rights Action Centre.The oil boom beginning in
the 1970s raised expectations for a better life which
people managed to hang on to, even after the eco-
nomy took a nose-dive in the 1980s and the World
B a n k ’s structural adjustment policies made life
more diffic u l t . “ I t ’s as if people are struggling to
r e ve rse the economic dow n t u rn as individuals,”
says Morka.“Everyone wants capital to start their
own bu s i n e s s. This industriousness is ve ry Nige-
rian but the struggle is even more fierce and stark in
Lagos where there is such a concentration of pres-
sures,resources and population.”
Wheelbarrows
rented out as beds
Instead of exploding under pressure, L a g o s i n s
h ave pumped that much more out of the inform a l
s t ru c t u r e , which Morka calls “an incredible renewa b l e
resource that has been the military gove rn m e n t ’s
gr e atest ally.”This underground economy enables at
least half the city’s people to make ends meet. B y
taking the edge off economic hardship, the inform a l
sector cuts down the potential for political upheava l .
Typical of the informal sector is the professor
who earns 5,000 naira, equivalent to about $55 a
month, and takes on a second or even a third job.
Perhaps he opens a small food store to pay for his
daughter’s tuition fees of $85 per semester. In this
vast black market, vegetables and fruit flow across
the border from neighbouring Benin, their entry
eased by bribing customs officials who earn about
$55 a month.When the government cuts domes-
tic fuel supplies to meet export demands, the
informal sector fills the tanks of taxis and buses to
keep Lagos moving. Behind this informal sector
lies a powerful if not desperate spirit of initiati-
ve—wheelbarrows are rolled out of a construction
site at night to serve as rented beds at 20 cents a
shot for homeless seeking shelter under an ove-
rhang.When rain makes a market run with mud,
kids wait with buckets of water to wash shoppers’
feet for a few naira.
The informal sector is where a man pushes a
c a rt from one home to the next, making $65 per
month for hauling away garbage and then earn i n g
another $55 by salva ging the reusable junk.A tanker
pulls up to fill a 100-gallon water tank for $6 to the
owner who then sells a bucketful for five cents. I t ’s the
b a rter that takes place when a baker has too many
l o aves left over at the end of the day or the flu rry of
m o t o r cycles gathered at the street corner where
buses don’t stop.And it’s at the heart of a basic code
ruling Lagos, from the thriving fruit market to the
quiet fishing community: Do It Yo u rs e l f.
A maze of planks stretch into the lagoon of
E bute Metta, where about 400 wooden shacks sit on
stilts over the wat e r ,r e m oved from the surr o u n d i n g
soot and speed of Lagos. Naked kids swing from the
p l a n k s , while women bathe and prepare the eve n i n g
meal.“We built this place on our own,” says Chief
Johnson Aibe, by trading fish for wood from mills
nearby to build homes and canoes.There are no offi-
cial deeds or titles in this community. A council of
elders decides who can build a new home at what
p ri c e . H a rsh experience has taught these people
that the less interface with officialdom, the better.
They used to live on the other side of the lagoon bu t
in 1985 the government decided to demolish their
homes to build housing estates that these people
couldn’t afford.Many lost everything, never recei-
ving a naira in compensation.Their options lay in
r e bu i l d i n g, by their own means, on their own term s.
In some way s ,E bute Metta reflects a lost Lagos
of the 1950s and 60s, when people flocking from the
c o u n t ryside basically built small communities within
the city along ethnic and geographic lines.Today’s
cosmopolitan Lagos has moved past this tradition.
“Eko gbole o gbole,” an expression in Yoruba,one of
the country ’s 250 local languages, has a double

m e a n i n g : “Lagos is a melting pot”or “ A nything goes
in Lagos.” The bonds of the extended family still
we ave this city together. Spare rooms, for example,
are virtually non-existent as there is always a brother
or a cousin needing a place to stay. Church groups
also play a key role in celebrations and tragedies,
p r oviding a safety net of support for their members.
At the same time, Lagos is like any other major
c i t y, where personal contacts are the key to fin d i n g
a decent apartment or a new job. Yet in this city,
connections are also essential for finding basic ser-
vices like electri c i t y, s e c u rity and wat e r. For example,
p ower outages lasting eight hours are a routine part
of the day. Only the rich can afford a generat o r , bu t
the crafty will work together to lay cables and pirat e
electricity from a government building nearby.
Tapping into
water pipes
Break-ins are a major concern for rich and poor
communities alike. So each household in the neigh-
bourhood will chip in about $25 a month to hire
local patrols which go so far as to close local roads
late at night.
“Do not vandalize!” reads a public announce-
ment painted on a water main lining a highway.
“Stop the thieves who depri ve you of wat e r.” But in
a city where only an estimated 30 per cent of fa m i-
lies have running wat e r , tapping into a pipe is not a
crime but a chance for home improvement.
While complacency doesn’t gain much gr o u n d
in Lagos, the driving initiative has yet to spark an
organized demand or movement for socio-eco-
nomic ri g h t s. While the reasons behind this are
c o m p l e x , there is one obvious fa c t o r: over 30 ye a rs
of military control and human rights abuse with the
likes of the infamous General A b a c h a , who died last

year. How do you demand the right to water from
a regime which openly rejects the rule of law?
A new elected government is now taking the
reins and offers some sense of optimism. But “ e l e c-
tions are just the tip of the iceberg,” s ays Prof.A k i n
M a b o g u n j e , N i g e ri a ’s most famous geogr a p h e r.
“ To bring some sanity to a city like Lagos, yo u ’ ve got
to bring gove rnment down to the people by getting
them involved in decisions concerning their own
n e i g h b o u r h o o d s ,” he say s.“This is the only way they
can be expected to not just contribute to public
works but monitor the ways in which people’s repre-
sentatives spend their money.”
Concrete bunkers for the lucky
M . O.A j ay i , an urban planner, s ays that instead of
receiving gove rnment help in response to gr a s s r o o t s
p r o b l e m s , Lagos has been subject to orders , i s s u e d
from the top down and often causing more harm than
good (see article below ) . The district of Maroko,
which was razed in 1990, is the most obvious case in
p o i n t . About 300,000 people used to live in this
beach-front slum.Sitting below sea-leve l , Maroko wa s
regularly flo o d e d , with tides of wat e r , mud and raw
waste making it an unhealthy place to live and an eye-
sore for the neighbouring community of V i c t o ri a
I s l a n d , a fortress for the ri c h .
“The police just came with bu l l d o z e rs and told
us to leave ,” s ays Helen Omame, 5 0 ,r e m e m b e ri n g
the day 9 years ago when her home was destroyed.
“ People were killed in the demolition, children left
s t r a n d e d .”To d ay, she and her husband live with their
8 children a few kilometres down the coast at “ n e w
M a r o k o ” , almost a carbon copy of the ori gi n a l ,
where the lucky live in concrete bu n k e rs built by the
s t at e . Like many other fa m i l i e s , the Omame fa m i l y
were never compensated for their losses. At night,
the family splits up to sleep in the wooden shacks of
the market.“The kids are really feeding the fa m i l y,”
s ays Helen.“ I t ’s easier for them to find odd jobs, l i k e
collecting garbage and carrying sacks of sand at
construction sites.”
Ironically, this may be the up and coming area
of Lagos. “Everyone is moving out here fast,” says
a smiling Ellen Kole inside her new ice-cream
shop. While luxury homes with domed roofs and
sweeping balconies sprout on the horizon, more
modest families like hers flock to three-roomed
bungalows, lacking water, electricity and a drain
for raw waste. “The new government is going to
invest here,” Ellen announces. In the meanwhile,
her family and neighbours will make do on their
own as they push the city’s limits. Lagos moves
on, without a straight course or a plan, but with a
singular will. n
