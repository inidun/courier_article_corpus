DECLARATION
The Declaration of Independence of the United States is one of the world's great
documents on freedom and human rights. On the following pages we present
major portions of the Declaration accompanied by special explanatory notes and
commentaries. We hope this presentation will be of interest to younger and older
readers alike. This text is a condensation from the booklet "About the Declaration
of Independence", a Scriptographic Booklet published by the Channing L. Bete Co.
Inc. 45 Federal Street, Greenfield, Mass., U.S.A. 01301 © 1969. It appears with the
permission of the publisher from whom a copy of the complete booklet is available
for $1.00 (prepaid).

We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all
men are Created equal ;/that they are endowed
by their creator with certain unalienable rights ;
that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness ; that to secure these rights, govern¬
ments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed ;
that whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the
people to alter or abolish it/and to institute new
government., laying its foundation on such princi¬
ples, and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to effect their sa¬
fety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes ; and, ac¬
cordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind
are more disposed to suffer while evils are suffer-
able, than to right themselves by abolishing the
forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing in¬
variably the same object, evinces a design to re¬
duce them under absolute despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such govern¬
ment and to provide new guards for their future
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of
these colonies ; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former sys¬
tems of government...
