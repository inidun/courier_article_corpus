The train and the migrant have become
indivisible through time in South A f ri c a .S o n g s
and lore feature the trains which brought the
first migrant workers to South Africa in the early
t wentieth century from the neighbouring countri e s
of Namibia, Z a m b i a ,Z i m b a b we , Mozambique and
Lesotho.
Millions of miners have come to dig gold from
the mines which bu rr ow deep into the eart h , a n d
m a ny other migrants have tilled and coaxed fru i t
from the soil in South A f ri c a ’s nort h e rn prov i n c e s.
For decades, South A f ri c a ’s wealth has relied on the
labour it imports from other A f rican countri e s.
Under apartheid,migration policy was used to
encourage white immigrants to come to the country
to shore up the numbers of the ruling minori t y.
They were gi ven incentives to locate here and many
non-governmental organizations were established
to help them settle. Most white South A f ri c a n s
carry dual citizenship.
On the other hand, black labourers we r e
brought in on contract to keep the mines and the
farms going—the mining and agricultural sectors
are two of the biggest contri bu t o rs to the gr o s s
domestic product. But with the demand for gold
drying up, the lacklustre sales figures have meant
that hundreds of thousands of miners from across
the region have been retrenched.

Confronted with a serious economic crisis and mounting xenophobia,
South Africa is up against the need for a new immigration policy
A f ri c a , yet thousands still flock in from the regi o n
e ve ry day in search of a living. The country is fa r
wealthier than other countries in the region—it is
responsible for 83 per cent of the regional gr o s s
n ational product. On top of this, m a ny believe that
South A f rica has a political responsibility to contri bu t e
to the development of southern A f rica because of past
policies to destabilize neighbouring countri e s.
Xenophobia in needy districts
These immigrants show that South A f rica has
joined the heaving global movement of humanity in
search of a better life. It is a receiver nat i o n : f r o m
Somalia and Morocco,car-loads of immigrants make
the hostile twe n t y - d ay trip loaded down with goods
to sell. Ghanaians have entered the retail bu s i n e s s
with fla i r , introducing new fashions to the tip of the
c o n t i n e n t . N i g e rians have set up cocaine cart e l s ,
joining an Italian and Eastern European mafia long-
established on these shores. Ta i wanese run the
poaching businesses in the fishing industry and
women from nearby Mozambique and fa r away
Manila sell their bodies in the city streets.
These people have become an easy target for
South A f ricans who toil in a country of gri n d i n g
p ove rt y, gr owing joblessness and a declining
economy. As with many countries in the world,the
xenophobia is worse in poor, working-class areas.

V i gilantes attack migrants in the inner cities and in the
shack lands.
The derogat o ry term m a k we r e k we r e—a cru d e
o n o m atopoeic imitation of how foreigners speak—
is used to describe foreigners as “those we don’t
u n d e rs t a n d ” , and newspapers abound with the fie ry
r h e t o ric of xe n o p h o b e s. “These people carry
diseases which they spread around and they infect
u s ,” said a young shop-owner in A l e x a n d r a
township, a poor area near Johannesburg. Others
complain that “They take our jobs”and “are willing
to work for less than us.” The xenophobia has
become so dangerous that some describe it as an
epidemic which has become endemic.
Yet studies show that many foreigners are here on
legal visitors ’ p e rm i t s , o t h e rs are employing South
A f ricans in street and formal businesses and most
d o n ’t want to make this country their perm a n e n t
h o m e . Still the myths pers i s t . A local survey found
t h at about four in five respondents thought the South
A f rican gove rnment is too soft on foreigners. S o u t h
A f ri c a ’s different ethnic groups were at one in their
belief that gove rnment should batten down the
h atches and get tough with foreigners.
A conundrum for government
This populist push is fueling gove rnment action.
M a ny immigrants try to enter the country illegally
through the vast Kruger National Park in the nort h .
In the past six ye a rs , an army unit which only polices
illegal immigrants has caught 17,000 people trying to
enter the country. Most are from South Africa’s
n e i g h b o u ring stat e s ,although the statistics show that
Ta i wa n e s e , Pakistani and Eastern Europeans have
also been arr e s t e d . Existing immigr ation laws have
c riminalized between two and five million people
thought to be living in the country illegally.
South A f rican Home A f fa i rs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is responsible for
m i gr at i o n ,would like to receive a much gr e ater slice
of the nat i o n ’s budget for policing the borders , and is
on record as saying that the country is at risk from
f o r e i g n e rs who run criminal syndicat e s ,p r o s t i t u t i o n
rings and deal in contraband. But his policy papers
h ave been fine tuned and written in the know l e d g e
t h at South A f rica cannot win a place in the global
e c o n o my by adhering to the “ f o rtress South A f ri c a ”
school of migr ation policy. In fa c t , establishing a new
m i gr ation policy for the country presents
g ove rnment with a conundru m : the middle path lies
somewhere between open borders and “ f o rt r e s s
South A f ri c a ” and defining that path is still ve ry
much a work in progr e s s.
The gove rnment is looking toward a special
arrangement with the other countries in southern
A f rica and moving eventually toward open borders.
But this is a long way off. A 1995 draft agreement
to throw open borders was gi ven the thumbs-dow n
by gove rn m e n t . I n s t e a d , a more cautious ve rs i o n
a d vo c ating a phased instead of a big bang approach
was written in 1997.
In the meantime,the migrant and the train are
still indivisible. Except that now the trains are used
to deport illegal immigrants out of South A f ri c a .
They shunt the desperate and the destitute back to
their home countries in dingy carriages, dumping
them like unwanted surplus at the borders from
whence they came.
South A f rica has a new refugee policy in line
with United Nations standards; its migr at i o n
policies for citizens from the rest of the world will
move increasingly toward letting in only those the
country needs. It is suffering a brain drain with the
loss of key skills like those of doctors , d e n t i s t s ,
engineers and information technology specialists.
New policies will seek to create instead a brain gain
by “headhunting”talent to come to South Africa.
In the meantime, the tide of xenophobia is
swelling. It is a violent tide but one which appears
impotent in the face of the thousands of new
residents (legal and illegal) who arrive here every
day.They have turned the country into a veritable
salad of nat i o n a l i t i e s. Together with older
immigrant communities, they ensure that this is a
world in one country. n
