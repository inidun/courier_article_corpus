Michael Heller*: The limits of scientific understanding
“There is a great temptation for the scientist to identify the limits of
rationality with the limits of scientific method—or, to put it in a more
picturesque way, to identify the limits of the method with the limits of the
universe. This temptation is so powerful because the scientific method is
the easiest kind of rationality and can efficiently distinguish what is
scientifically valuable information from what is not.
The nature of the big bang is a purely scientific problem. To “explain”it as
a result of God’s action is like ascribing thunder to the bad temper of Zeus.
I think the really important question lies elsewhere:namely, where do the
laws of physics come from?
There are currently two ways of answering this. One is to show that on a
fundamental level there reigns complete anarchy and the laws of physics
are just effects of purely random averaging processes. The other is to
imagine a set of all possible universes, each of them with different physical
laws. We then happen to be living in a highly ordered universe because in
all other universes the life of beings like ourselves is excluded.But can such
probabilities be an ultimate explanation? Why does the universe—or the
set of all universes—have this property of probability? Here, I think,we are
touching the real limits of our understanding of the universe.
The only way to get rid of such questions is not to ask them. But that
would go against a criterion of critical rationality:one should not cease to
look for further arguments as long as something remains to be argued
for.”
