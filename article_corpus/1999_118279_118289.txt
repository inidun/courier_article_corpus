The price of t r u t h

Amnesty applications have shed light on unsolved murders in South Africa, but for some
families knowing the truth is not enough
W
hy should victims of apartheid accept that the
South A f rican Truth and Reconciliation Com-
mission (TRC) gave amnesty to assassins and
mass killers of the former apartheid regime? This is
just one of the questions asked by critics of the T R C
process inside the country.At the heart of all cri t i c i s m
is the legal power gi ven to the commission to gr a n t
a m n e s t y,under certain conditions to people who com-
mitted politically motivated crimes between 1960 and
1 9 9 4 . Amnesty means a person can never be cri m i-
nally charged with that cri m e , nor can he be sued in
a civil court for damages resulting from that act.
More than 7,000 people applied for amnesty,
including two former cabinet ministers of Pri m e
Minister P. W. B o t h a ’s gove rnment and several of
his police generals. Most have been granted amnesty,
although several cases are still under considerat i o n .
Ve ry often, the families of the victims murdered
by former policemen and soldiers , and in a few cases
by members of the two liberation arm i e s ,h ave rejected
the entire notion of amnesty.The most prominent
include the widow and son of Black Consciousness
leader Steve Biko, who was beaten to death in a cell
by policemen, and the family of Gri f fiths Mxe n g e , a
black law yer whose throat was cut by three policemen
because he represented anti-apartheid activists.
They argue that the provision for amnesty robs
them of any sense of justice. In their view, m u r d e r e rs
should face a criminal trial and be jailed—failing to
do so cheapens the lives of their victims.Simply confes-
sing to these brutal acts should not be enough to bu y
the perp e t r at o rs complete freedom, they argue.T h e y
are also against the provision that no civil claims may
be made against the killers once they receive amnesty,
arguing that it cuts out the chance of obtaining com-
p e n s ation for the death of a breadwinner to their fa m i-
lies as well as for pain and sufferi n g .
The counter-argument, s t ated many times by
Commission chairp e rson Desmond Tu t u , is that it
would not be in the interest of national reconciliat i o n
to send hundreds of former policemen, s o l d i e rs and
e ven politicians to jail. N o n e t h e l e s s ,t wo of the wo rs t
k i l l e rs in the apartheid police force,Eugene de Kock
(whose request for amnesty is pending) and Ferdi Bar-
nard (who did not ask for it), were prosecuted and
gi ven life sentences.Wouter Basson, the head of the
f o rmer gove rn m e n t ’s Chemical and Biological Wa r-
fare progr a m m e , is currently on tri a l .There is no evi-
dence to suggest that these cases undermined the
r e c o n c i l i ation process in any way.
Another argument often put forward in favour of
amnesty is that much, if not most, of the inform at i o n
the TRC obtained about the evils committed by the
a p a rtheid gove rnments was disclosed to them through
the amnesty applications of perp e t r at o rs of gross human
rights violat i o n s. If it were not for these stat e m e n t s ,t h e
t ruth about a large number of unexplained events and
u n s o l ved murders would not have come out.And for
the nation as a whole, if there had to be a tradeoff, t ru t h
was considered more important than justice.
New heroes
The amnesty applications of Phila Ndwa n d we ’s
m u r d e r e rs is a case in point.The young mother of a
baby boy and a unit commander of the A f rican Nat i o-
nal Congress army, N d wa n d we was stationed with
her unit in neighbouring Swaziland when she crossed
the border one day, n e ver to be seen again. For many
ye a rs the ru m o u rs dogged her family that she could
possibly have been a collaborator of the apart h e i d
g ove rn m e n t .Then the story came out in the amnesty
a p p l i c ation of four policemen.They had lured her ove r
the border with a false message, and then kept her in a
d e s o l ate house.There they assaulted and tortured her
in an effort to get her to join the apartheid police or
tell them her unit’s secrets. According to the police-
m e n ’s stat e m e n t s , she told them she would prefer to
d i e .They shot her in the head and bu ried her.
Phila Ndwa n d we ’s remains were dug up and
r e bu ried at a huge public funeral, where her nine-
year-old son received a medal for exceptional bra-
very on behalf of his dead mother. Instead of Phila
N d wa n d we being remembered as an apartheid col-
laborator,South Africa gained a new hero. ■
