To see just how much Indonesia has
changed since the fall of its longtime
president Suhart o, simply step out
onto the street.Do not even search for one
of the almost daily demonstrations that
snarl traffic in Jakarta and other big cities.
Just head as far as the nearest newsstand.
T h e r e , on display, are the dozens of loud
m a g a z i n e s ,s a u cy tabloids and hard-hitting
n e w s p a p e rs that have sprung up since ri o t s
in the capital ended the former general’s
32-year rule in May 1998.
G r a n t e d , media penetration is still low in
this country of 204 million, the wo r l d ’s fourt h -
largest in size. But in a short period of time,
it has undergone nothing short of a press
e x p l o s i o n . In the 12 months following Suhar-
t o ’s resignat i o n , the gove rnment granted 718
new media licences,a leap from the 289 issued
in the 53 ye a rs since the country ’s indepen-
d e n c e .And more recently, in November 1999,
the gove rnment abolished the all-powe r f u l
D e p a rtment of Inform ation (known as Dep-
p e n ) . For decades, this fixture of gove rn m e n t
e xe rted tight control over the media and for-
bade coverage of any subject that stoked sen-
timents of ethnicity, r e l i gi o n , race or belief—
a justifiable policy in a nation made up of
numerous ethnic and religious gr o u p s. B u t
t h at rule was gradually stretched to cover any-
thing that annoyed the gove rn m e n t .
In the mid-1990s, as Suhart o ’s authori t y
was increasingly questioned, the press
became bolder and the gove rnment har-
dened its stance. When Te m p o, a leading
n e w swe e k l y, c overed a debate within gove rn-

the former East German nav y, a deal

INDONESIA: 
L E A RNING THE ROPES 
OF PRESS FREEDOM

King of Spades
A popular TV talk show was cancelled
after its host interv i e wed one of the judges
who ruled in favour of Te m p o. But the jour-
n a l i s t s ’r e s o l ve did not wa n e , especially from
l ate 1997, when the media did its best to
c over the increasing discontent and unrest
throughout the archipelago, especially the
student-led anti-Suharto demonstrat i o n s.
After Indonesia’s parliament reelected
S u h a rto to a seventh 5-year term , D & R
magazine ran a cover port r aying the president
as the King of Spades.The act drew a sharp
r e buke from Deppen, which initiated pro-
ceedings against the magazine.But before the
case could be resolve d , riots erupted across
Indonesia and Suharto resigned.
When his vice-president, M r. H a b i b i e ,
stepped up to succeed him as a transitional
fig u r e , there were initial concerns about whe-
ther the small gains the press had made cove-
ring the tumult surrounding Suhart o ’s fa l l
would be rolled back.Those concerns multi-
plied when Habibie appointed East T i m o r
veteran Lieutenant General Yunus Yo s fiah as
minister of inform at i o n .Yet expanded press
freedom has actually been one of the much-
maligned post-Suharto transitional gove rn-
m e n t ’s most significant accomplishments.
One of Yosfiah’s first acts was to take
away Deppen’s right to revoke press
l i c e n c e s. He also streamlined the process of
granting gove rnment approval to new media
o r g a n i z at i o n s. He even asked applicants to
Under the Suharto regime in Indonesia, the newsweekly Tempo was banned for covering 
a politically sensitive topic. Its reappearance in October 1998, above, symbolized the beginning 
of a new era of press freedom.

r e p o rt any Deppen official who sought
favo u rs—such as stakes in media start -
ups—in return for a licence. He cut the
number of daily stat e - run radio news broad-
casts that stations were required to air from
14 to four.And he allowed the form ation of
other journ a l i s t s ’a s s o c i ations than the stat e -
sanctioned PWI. In a recent interv i e w,Yo s-
fiah explained the changes:“Now it’s dif-
f e r e n t .We consider journalists as colleagues.
We have a new paradigm.”T h at new stance
was symbolized by the reopening of Tempo
in October 1998.
At the same time, a group of publishers
and broadcasters also began efforts to revise
S u h a rto-era press regulat i o n s. The result
was Law no. 4 0 , passed in September 1999,
and described as “the first law liberating the
press from tyranny,” s ays S.L. B at u b a r a ,
chair of the Indonesian Newspaper Publi-
shers Association.The new law (see box)
revises 25 articles in the previous press law
t h at left the position of the press largely up
to the discretion of the inform ation minister.
It abolishes the system of licensing the
m e d i a , and transfers regulation of the press
to the industry itself.The Indonesian Press
and Broadcasting Society is now encoura-
ging its members to set up internal ombu d-
smen, and is drafting a common code of
conduct.
Although the law leaves many questions
u n r e s o l ved—especially with regard to
b r o a d c a s t i n g, film and programme censor-
ship and the apportioning of frequencies—
the reform of Deppen’s role and the laws
under which it controlled the press do mark
a step forwa r d .M a ny local journalists report
a reduction—even the disappearance—of
m i l i t a ry or bu r e a u c r atic interference in their
wo r k . But legal restrictions formed only
p a rt of the constraints on Indonesia’s press
under Suhart o.The press is still vulnerable
on other fronts. For example, while Indo-
n e s i a ’s laws expressly forbid foreign ow n e r-
ship of media, less is said about domestic
c o n flicts of interest. Nothing protects jour-
nalists from media owners.
Habits that die hard
Although Habibie himself tolerated daily
c riticism of his gove rnment and its poli-
c i e s , some of his allies and support e rs we r e
less forgi v i n g . Unrest erupted in Ja k a rt a
when Indonesia’s electoral college conve n e d
in November 1998 to confirm Habibie and
his policies. Soon afterwards, private tele-
vision station SCTV came under pressure.
A state-owned bank called in the station’s
$34-million loan, which triggered the sale of
a majority stake in the company. A firm
run by Habibie’s brother took the lead in
n e g o t i ating for a share. In a stat e m e n t ,
SCTV news producers claimed that the
g ove rnment was punishing the station for its
reports on the tumult.
Another grey area is the criminal code,
which retains many articles relating to the
press,including one that threatens as long
as four ye a rs in prison for writing or broad-
casting enmity, h atred or insult to members
of gove rn m e n t . The criminal code poses
an obstacle to coverage of past and present
g ove rnment misdeeds—especially since law
in the past has regularly been used to brow-
beat and control whistle-blowers.Yasmen

the need for, or even the principle of, a free

sense that the media is responsible for poli-

emotional issue of reporting religi o u s - l i n k e d

responsibilities and duties, much less their

are the responsibilities they must assume,”

tions providing formal training to journ a-
l i s t s. Few unive rsities have journalism fa c u l-
t i e s.
Aside from a flu rry of foreign-funded
s h o rt seminars for local report e rs , by and
l a r g e , Indonesian journalists learn from their

s e n i o rs and on the job.As such, standards are
often confused with accepted practice, a
s i t u ation exacerbated by low salari e s. O n e
long-standing habit is so-called “ e nve l o p e
j o u rn a l i s m ” in which report e rs who at t e n d
press conferences receive envelopes of cash
from the event organizer.The press also still
largely cove rs current events by quoting
public fig u r e s ’ views and announcements,
instead of setting its own agenda—a hangove r
from the Suharto era.
