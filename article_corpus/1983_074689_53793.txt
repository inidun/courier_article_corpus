Unesco's international programme
for the development of communication
rHE International Programme for the Development
of Communication (IPDC) was established by a
unanimous decision taken by the community of
Member States of Unesco at the 21st session of its General
Conference, held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in- 1980. Its
statutes, rules ofprocedure and plans for future action are
therefore the result of a consensus of opinion among the
thirty-five nations which constitute its Intergovernmental
Council and have the support of the Member States of the
Organization.
This governing body has been given a challenging man¬
date. Composed of representatives proportionally divided
among the Member States from all geographical regions of
the world, this body has been called upon to work out,
finance and implement a practical programme in order to
reduce the existing gaps in communication within, as well as
among nations. It must be proved that it is possible, in spite
ofpolitical differences, to arrive at concrete and constructive
decisions through co-operation and a willingness to listen
and learn from each other.

Objectives
The main objectives of the IPDC are:
to identify the needs and priority areas for the information and
communication development plans in developing countries;
to promote, in these countries and in accordance with their com¬
munication policies, the creation or extension of infrastructures for
the different communication sectors as well as improved interna¬
tional exchange of information;
to analyse the technical and financial needs and resources in the
fields of information and communication at the national and inter¬
national levels;
to ensure better co-ordination and reciprocal consultation among
parties interested in the development of communication;
to secure funds, from both public and private sectors, to support
these activities;
to strengthen co-operation and co-ordination of Unesco's ac¬
tivities with other Specialized Agencies concerned, especially with
the International Telecommunication Union (ITU);

to promote viable regional communication institutions, establish¬
ed with Unesco's assistance and which may play an extensive role
in the planning and execution of regional projects within the
programme;
to provide consultative and advisory services to developing coun¬
tries in the field of communication;
to sensitize all parties concerned (be they developing or developed
countries, international organizations and agencies of the United
Nations system, non-governmental organizations or other public
and private bodies active in this area) to the important role played
by communication in the development process;
to encourage maximum co-operation and concentration of ef¬
forts among those interested in communications development;
to support the exchange of information, programmes and ex¬
perience among media agencies, especially in developing countries;
to prepare studies based on experience gained in international co¬
operation in the domain of information and communication
development, particularly between developing and developed
countries.
International dissemination and
exchange of information by global
satellite systems
A worldwide experiment in the transmission of televised news sup¬
ported by Unesco's International Programme (IPDC) for' the
Development of Communication is due to start operating early in
1983, the World Communications Year.
This is one of three interregional projects planned within the
framework of the IPDC, the two others being: a study of the ap¬
plication of communication technology to rural areas, and the
establishment of a Centre for the study of communications, energy
and space technologies. Some twenty regional projects have also
been approved, as have a number of national projects in fifteen
countries.
The project has the support of the regional broadcasting unions,
both INTELSAT and INTERSPUTNIK having agreed in principle
to take part in the experiment. Field studies, data-gathering mis¬
sions and regional meetings have been held in Africa, Asia and the
Arab States.
The project is planned in two stages: first, an experimental
demonstration, and second, global interconnexion through the per¬
manent leasing of transponders for collection and dissemination of
television news and programmes.
The experimental demonstration will provide a simulated test of
exchanges within and between these regions, as well as an oppor¬
tunity to monitor the operation of their systems and their gradual
integration with the present inter-union satellite exchange systems.
Since March 1982, a substantial amount of planning for the ex¬
perimental period has been done by the broadcasting unions, the
central co-ordinator and Unesco's Division of Free Flow of Infor¬
mation and Communication Policies. The experiment is scheduled
to run for an initial eight-week period to test co-ordination pro¬
cedures and gauge its effect on viewers.
