interview
Macedonian director Milco
Mancevski (above). His film
Before the Rain won a
Golden Lion award at the
1994 Venice Film Festival
and was nominated for an
Oscar in 1995.
> When you were twenty,
you decided to leave your
country. At the age of
thirty-four you returned
and shot part of Before
the Rain there. Why did
you leave? And why did
you come back?
I think all twenty-year-olds need to
take off and reinvent themselves.
America the American dream is the
promised land of reinventing. It's no
coincidence that in the old days
people changed their names when
they landed there. It answered a con¬
scious or unconscious need to go
back to square one. I left because I
needed to leave. That was the first
reason. The second was the cinema.
And the third, which ties up with the
first, was the discovery of something
new a new culture, a new way of
life, a new vision. As for going back,
it's something I'm always doing. I'm
always schizophrenically in some
halfway house.
The myth of homecoming
is present in your film:
Aleksandar, a Macedonian
photographer living in
London, decides to go back
to his home village.
The film is actually based on three
mythical models: Ulysses or home¬
coming, Romeo and Juliet or impos¬
sible love, and Hamlet or self-ques¬
tioning. For me the cinema is not really
an art but a process of "myth-telling".
My work as a film-maker has involved
finding ways of telling myths in a new
language, no more than that, since
you can't invent new myths.
I Your three myths are
explored in the film's
three sections, which are
called "Words, "Pictures"
and "Faces". Where did
you get the idea for those
titles?
I have no preconceived ideas or pre¬
meditated message. When I was
writing the screenplay, it became clear

that these three elements were essen¬
tial. Don't forget they are the three
fundamental components of any film.
Take any film, analyse it, dissect it,
and that's what it'll boil down to.
> You have said in an
interview that the film
grew out of a feeling. . .
It was all very hazy at the begin¬
ning. After a long absence, I returned
to Skopje for personal reasons. War
was about to break out in Slovenia.
There was a kind of pressure in the air,
as when something important is
going to happen or when it's about
to rain. That was the feeling. The the
title followed. The story came after¬
wards.
I The story is constructed
around an imaginary
conflict between
Orthodox Macedonians
and Muslim Albanians. Is
that something you feel is
in the offing?
The story isn't specific to Mace¬
donia or the former Yugoslavia. It
could easily be set In Northern Ireland
or the former Soviet Union or some¬
where else in the world. From a prag¬
matic point of view the film spells out
a warning. But it's not a documentary
and must certainly not be regarded as
one. Anyway a documentary would
have had to involve politicians, given
the role they play in wars. Before the
Rain is far removed from politics. I'm
not capable of talking about politics,
which doesn't interest me anyway.
> It's a highly stylized film.
The cinematography often
has an unreal beauty.
I gave a lot of thought to that
problem. For a long time I couldn't
make up my mind whether to opt for a
more realistic, documentary angle or a
stylized approach. I ended up
choosing the latter, again without any
rational explanation. It just seemed the
natural choice though it could be
that the story itself and the characters
required it. If, in the first part of the
film, the images seem to come straight
out of a fairy tale, it's because the hero
of the story, the young Orthodox
monk, Kiril, treats the real world as
though it were a fairy tale. He and God
are as one. Everything is beautiful.
The full moon and shooting stars are
shown as he sees them. I've already
pointed out elsewhere that those
shots were commissioned not by the
Macedonian Tourist Office, but by the
character of Kiril.
> Do you see yourself as
belonging to any
particular tradition?
To many traditions, not one. I
don't think I belong to a particular cin¬
ematic movement. Everything you see
leaves a residue in you, especially if it's
good art. A great many film-makers,
artists and writers I admire are present
in what I do, though I don't know to
what degree. That's something for
other people to decide.
I Is there no connection at
all between what you
were doing previously
your commercials, music
videos, documentaries
and your feature film?
Does the writer in you
influence the film-maker?
When it comes down to it, I'm a
purist. I like pure art, like music,
painting and perhaps poetry. Narrative
film and the opera are to my mind
rather hybrid forms. That's why, in all
the work I've done so far, I've tried to
seek out the pure element. Of all the
forms you just mentioned, the one
where I feel the greatest freedom is
writing. When it comes to film-making,
I'm an apprentice. For me, film and
video are ways of broadening my
writing, which thereby gains a new
dimension and at the same time
reaches a wider public.
I also believe video and film have
virtually nothing in common. A music
video belongs to the world of design
and focuses on a star. A film tells a
story and focuses on people. What is
more, their means of expression are
completely different.
As regards documentaries, I've
made several, but I don't believe in the
genre. I don't believe in it because it
claims to reproduce objective reality,
whereas we all know how difficult it is
to say what objective reality is. The
very act of describing that reality
impinges on and alters it. However
hard they try and whatever their aims,
directors end up having to commit
themselves.

opening and closing scene
of Mancevski 's Before the
Rain (1994).

> The question of
commitment is one of the
big issues underlying your
film. Many people in the
former Yugoslavia have
had to face this problem.
There are two options open to
Aleksandar: either he can rejoin his
cousins' "camp" by handing over to
them the young Albanian woman,
Zamira, who is suspected of murder,
or he can continue to protect Zamira
and clash with his own family. He
chooses Zamira and thus signs his
own death warrant.
Unlike Aleksandar, the young
monk, Kiril, is incapable of taking
sides. He shelters Zamira, not because
he chooses to do so, but by a quirk of
fate. Then he falls in love with her and
leaves the monastery to go abroad
with her. But he shies at the first
obstacle: when he is caught unawares
by Zamira's family, he yields unprotest-
ingly to the will of the grandfather and
turns his back on her. In a desperate
attempt to follow him, she dies at the
hands of her own brother.
Kiril does not get involved, does
not act, does not decide. He is one of
those people who submit. He is the
only one of the three main characters
who survives, but he is the most
tragic. Aleksandar, on the other hand,
dies, but dies with a smile on his face.
He is dead, but not really tragic.
Aleksandar decides to save
Zamira.
é Where do you stand
exactly?
It took me a whole film to explain
my position, and even then. . . . How
do you expect me to sum it up in a
few words? One thing is certain: no
stance really stands the test of time.
People like us, who grew up during
the period of the Cold War and com¬
munism, have seen how revolutions
can degenerate. You launch yourself
into an ideal with your head full of
dreams and, without your realizing it,
that ideal turns into a caricature of
itself. But there's nothing you can do
about it, as you've already committed
yourself. I've always wondered how
we can define ourselves in terms of an
ideology and stick to our guns when
the whole world around us is
changing.
I You take a stand against
violence. . .
Yes, of course. I condemn vio¬
lence, exclusion, tribalism, nationalism
and everything I regard as "collective
selfishness". But the problem is how
can you keep on being a pacifist
when someone throws stones at
you? If you react, you're compro¬
mising your ¡deals. If you don't react,
you end up getting bombs thrown at
you.
I One of the most violent
scenes in your film the
massacre in a London
restaurant is acted in
Serbian, without any
translation. Is it solely
aimed at spectators from
the former Yugoslavia?
On the contrary, it's aimed at
everyone except Yugoslavia. I origi¬
nally intended to shoot the scene in
another language. It didn't matter
which one, it could have been
Armenian, for example. Then some
technical constraints cropped up.
However that may be, the scene is
seen and experienced by Anne, an
Englishwoman. That's why it has not
been translated: Anne doesn't under¬
stand a word. She is present at one of
those massacres you glimpse on tele¬
vision before switching to another
channel. The difference in this case is
that war comes out of the television
set and into your own world. The

people directly Involved in a war aren't
the only ones involved. "Ask not for
whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."
> Did you have to make
sacrifices in order to
shoot your film?
All directors make certain calcula¬
tions. Those who make so-called art
films do too. Talking about politics,
putting in a dash of Surrealism,
shooting some very slow scenes,
projecting an image of the world as
seen through the eyes of a child
these are often "gimmicks" that help
you to sell yourself as a "director of
art films". American cloak-and-dagger
films and the kind of movies Arnold
Schwarzenegger appears in are gim¬
micks of a different kind designed to
attract another kind of audience. What
I mean is that form in itself is neither a
guarantee of quality nor a passport to
mediocrity. A film should have both a
highly emotive side and a very well-
structured side. One of those two
ingredients without the other results in
kitsch. Together they create a contrast
which gives an added dimension to
the finished film.
I didn't come under any outside
pressure when making Before the
Rain, apart from a problem of time, in
other words money. But that's all part
of the job.
