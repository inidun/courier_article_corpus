It all starts with a sense of powerlessness, sprin-
ging from a paradox that can be formulated in
many different ways but which boils down to a
simple tru t h : humanity will have to make some
pretty fundamental changes if it wants to surv i ve .We
clearly cannot rely on the main political and eco-
nomic playe rs — i m p risoned in their agendas, h a m-
pered by short-sightedness and practical
constraints—to take up the challenge.Instead,it’s
up to the ordinary citizens to organize on a global
s c a l e , and change from being powerless to taking a
s t a n d , joining the debate and drafting a different way
forward.
The Charles Léopold Mayer1 Foundation for
Human Progress was set up in 1982 in Geneva
with the aim of linking activism in the world to
study of the future.At the time, our societies, t h o u g h
richer and wiser than ever before, seemed singularly
unable to satisfy the hopes
and most basic needs of
their members. We had
to weave a closer relation-
ship between thought and
a c t i o n , b e t ween adva n c e s
in knowledge and possibilities for human progr e s s.
The foundation started out by support i n g
e n d e avo u rs that brought these elements together—
a novelty at the time—but these initiat i ves still
remained isolated “ p r o j e c t s.” For example, o n e
project in Brazil invo l ved assistance in building a net-
work across 10 regions to gather inform ation on tra-
ditional branches of knowledge and contrast the fin-
dings with modern science. In Tanzania, a project
aimed to improve agricultural training by making it
more attuned to small farmers’ needs.
While involved in these projects, we made two
d i s c ove ri e s. F i rs t l y, we found that solutions to pro-
blems must be made on the basis of each part i c u l a r
social context, though the problems themselves are
broadly the same.A common denominator of issues
cropped up in all the projects, no matter where
they were taking place. But these shared characte-
ristics were often hidden by the sheer complexity of
local circumstances, ri gid mindsets, i n s t i t u t i o n a l
factors and different schools of knowledge.
This common denominator became the ve ry
basis of our programmes, and explains the impor-
tance we have attached to establishing netwo r k s.
Equipping some of our partners with Internet, a
potentially formidable tool for democratic progr e s s ,
has thus become one of the foundation’s priorities.
Our second discovery was that the most useful
knowledge for future action comes from practice,
namely from one’s own experience and that of others
– experience that must be identified and recorded so
others can learn from it. Hence the need to store
information and circulate it by creating a tool for
communication that can become a type of “collec-
t i ve intelligence.” Since 1986, the foundation has gr a-
dually built up an intern ational database for shari n g
experience,establishing first of all norms for orga-
nizing and distri buting the inform at i o n .To d ay, t h i s
c o rpus of shared experience cove rs a wide area,
from the geopolitics of drugs and social exclusion in
Asia to the management of difficult neighbourhoods
in nort h e rn France and innovat i ve educat i o n a l
methods in Brazil. S o m e
8,000 contri butions from
citizens and local, regional
and national institutions,
research centres and NGOs
are gathered in the dat a -
base, while the Association of Chinese Mayors has
expressed interest in adopting it for future use.
By enabling some of our netwo r k ’s members to
become more knowledgeable than recognized
experts in the field, these tools are among the key
elements that will help take “civil society” into its
third historical phase.A first period of protest was
f o l l owed by part i c i p ation in major world foru m s ,t o
which we brought a critical vo i c e .N ow we are gea-
ring up for a new era of initiat i ve by connecting the
a l t e rn at i ve strat e gies and visions that people around
the world are searching for, weighing up and inve n-
ting.All these alternatives are based on the simple
premise: think locally, act globally.
This new unity, built over time and striving to rea-
lize a common goal through respect for the part i c u-
l a rities of eve ry place, is the essence of the Alliance for
a Responsible and United Wo r l d . Set up in 1993, it has
p a rt n e rs in 115 countri e s , and made its most recent
project a bid to “encourage the definition and prac-
tical application of a form of ‘ world gove rn a n c e ’t h at
meets the challenges of the 21st century.” ■
