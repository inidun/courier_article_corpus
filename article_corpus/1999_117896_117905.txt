Civil law: Inspired by Roman law. L e gi s l ation is the
primary source of law. Civil codes are the centre-
piece of the legal framework and the foundation of
all other laws which complement or make excep-
tions to it.The codes are mainly characterized by a
high level of abstraction which enables the judge
to interpret and analyse situations either by
applying the legislation or by extrapolatiing from
the overall framewo r k . France is a prototypical civil
l aw nat i o n . O ver 60% of the world population is
influenced by this tradition.
Common law: D e ri ved from English unwritten law
t h at evo l ved from the 12th century onwa r d .K n ow n
as “judge-made law ” . J u ri s p rudence is the pri m a ry
source of law. D e veloped through an inductive
a p p r o a c h , legal concepts emerge and progress ove r
t i m e ,c o n s t ructed by an amalgamation of numerous
cases that bring together the legal scope of these
c o n c e p t s. Common law prevails in the United King-
d o m , the U. S . A . and most Commonwealth coun-
t ri e s ,i n fluencing over 30% of the world populat i o n .
Islamic law: C o n t r o l l e d , ruled and regulated by the
Islamic religion and followed by over 20% of the
world populat i o n . Its main source is the holy book,
the Koran, complemented by the Sunna—limited
i n t e rp r e t ation of the Koran by the prophet.This legal
methodology is known as Shariah (the way to fol-
l ow ) .The sacred law purp o rts to regulate all aspects
of society and its citizens. One unique characteri s t i c
of Islamic law is the precedence of collective ri g h t s
over individual ri g h t s. Individual rights and freedoms
are restricted by the religi o n ’s moral and divine impe-
r at i ve s. Recent developments have favoured an
e x t e n s i ve interp r e t ation of the moral rules to adapt to
the new reality of the 21st century.
Mixed systems. They include two or more legal
methods used concurrently or interactively in a
multi-cultural or multi-religious society. The legal
systems of many North A f rican and Middle Eastern
c o u n t ries are strongly influenced by the civil law tra-
d i t i o n ,but in some areas, especially those relating to
p e rsonal stat u s , family mat t e rs and property law,
these countries tend to follow Islamic tradition.
Customary law: Body of usage and customs that
h ave , through time, acquired force of law.There are
many expressions of customary law, which can be
developed notably through religion, race or cultu-
ral identity. It plays an important role in a relat i ve l y
large number of mixed law countries and, over time,
m a ny of these nations tend to implement their “ c u s-

Some were exported far and wide. Now there are signs that they are starting to converg e.

Legal systems in former Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.The vast majority of these countries were
part of the civilist legal tradition prior to the 1917
r e volution or postwar changes. Fo l l owing those
e ve n t s , p a rts of their codes were inva l i d ated to
accommodate communist ideology, and their civil
codes were never fully abrogated between 1917-
1 9 9 1 . Since 1991, Russia and other East European
c o u n t ries have been undergoing important reform s
to adapt to globalization, while remaining true to
their civilist roots.
Impact of globalization: Legal systems have become,
in certain areas, b a rri e rs to the development of
world trade.Hence,in the last 50 years,the rise of
international institutions which promote the har-
monization of laws and try to minimize the effects
of “transystemic legal barri e rs ” .I n t e rn ational trade
is the driving force in the development of a jus com-
mune that will transcend and coexist with traditio-
nal legal systems. n
