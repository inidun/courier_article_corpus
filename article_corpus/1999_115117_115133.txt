The spectre of new biological weapons made possible by the mapping of 
the human genome makes it more urgent than ever to prevent biotechnology
research from being hijacked for evil purposes
Genetic w e a p o n s:
a 21st-century
nightmare?
n
It sounds like science fic t i o n , but like
m a ny another prediction that was once
dismissed as far-fetched it may become
a reality.
Scientists have wa rned that recent
a d vances in biological research could eve n-
tually lead to the creation of a new type of
b i o l o gical arsenal capable of targeting a
specific group of human beings with
common genetic characteri s t i c s , as may be
the case with certain ethnic groups.
“It will unfort u n ately be possible to
design biological weapons of this type when
more information on genome research is
ava i l a b l e ,” s ays Dr Vivienne Nat h a n s o n ,
head of science and health policy at the
B ritish Medical A s s o c i ation (BMA), t h e
body which represents the medical profes-
sion in the United Kingdom.
This terrifying prospect may be an unwe l-
come piece of spin-off from research being
c a rried out under the Human Genome Pro-
ject (see box ) , an intern ational scientific effort
to map and sequence the genes in the human
body and find out more about human DNA
( d e ox y ribonucleic acid), the molecule which
p r ovides the biological instructions to make
a human being.
Repairing defective genes
L ate last ye a r ,genome research achieve d
a breakthrough when scientists for the firs t
time deciphered the full genetic progr a m-
ming of an animal.The creature was a micro-
scopic roundwo rm known as C a e n o r h a b d i t i s
e l e ga n s, but because wo rms and humans have
t u rned out to share many genes in common,
the wo rm genome is regarded by biologists as
an essential basis for understanding how the
human genome wo r k s.

a gree that the technology to produce ethnic
weapons is not a reality now,some feel there
is a real chance that it may be deve l o p e d
within the next ten ye a rs.“No need to wait till
the project is completed. E f f o rts to regulat e
genetic research should begin now,” s ay s
D a n d o.
P r o f. Dando says the world community is
already struggling to eliminate existing bio-
l o gical we a p o n s.These we a p o n s ,which carry
agents spreading deadly diseases like anthrax
and other lethal tox i n s , can deva s t ate human
beings without causing damage to bu i l d i n g s
or infrastru c t u r e .E x p e rts say that a few hun-
dred kilograms of a “ we a p o n i z e d ” b a c t e ri a l
p r e p a r ation has the potential to wipe out up
to three million inhabitants concentrated in a
city like New Yo r k .
The apartheid regime in South A f rica is
widely believed to have developed forms of
b i o l o gical we a p o n ry for use against the black
p o p u l at i o n . In the past, h owe ve r , c o u n t ri e s
h ave rarely used such biological weapons in
wa r fa r e ,p a rtly because of their fear of elimi-
n ating friendly populations and killing their
own combat a n t s.The new developments in
genetic research described by Professor
Dando would remove these limitat i o n s.

nThe Human Genome Project (HGP),
which began in 1990, is an intern at i o n a l
1 5 - year $3-billion initiat i ve to trace and iden-
tify all the 60,000 to 80,000 genes (the human
g e n o m e ) .I n t e rn ational in scope, it has been
d e s c ribed as the largest scientific research
e f f o rt ever undertaken in the biologi c a l
s c i e n c e s. It is also seeking to determine the
complete sequence of 3 billion sub-units of
human DNA (deox ribonucleic acid), t h e
molecule which codes genetic inform at i o n
and provides the biological instructions to
make a human being. At least 18 countri e s
h ave established genome research projects,
and about 1,000 individuals from 50 coun-
t ries are members of the Human Genome
O r g a n i z ation (HUGO), which helps to co-
o r d i n ate intern ational collaborat i o n .
About 17 per cent of the genes had
been sequenced by late 1998,and the pro-
ject is expected to be finished by 2003,the
Genome research: hopes and d i l e m m a s
‘The social and ethical
s a f e g u a rds which may
p revent ethnic conflict and
weapons development need
to be discussed urg e n t l y ’
Scientists say a detailed understanding of
genetic mechanisms of human beings will
help them to find out the causes of many
d i s e a s e s. For example, k n owledge of an indi-
v i d u a l ’s genetic make-up will enable doc-
t o rs to predict whether or not a specific dru g
will work on a particular pat i e n t ,a l l owing the-
rapies to be more accurately targeted. S i m i-
l a r l y, genetic testing for predisposition to a
range of illnesses could become feasible,a n d
by using what is known as gene therapy doc-
t o rs would be able to replace deficient genes
or repair defective ones.
H owe ve r , genome research may turn
out to have a grim downside.
It has proved that biologically there are
more similarities between human beings
than differences, f u rther dissolving tradi-
tional prejudices of race and ethnicity.
H owe ve r , differences do exist, and if inve s-
t i g ations provide sufficient data about ethnic
genetic differences between populat i o n
gr o u p s , it may one day be possible to target
the groups with dangerous micro-organisms.
One specialist who takes this eve n t u a l i t y
very seriously is Malcom R. Dando, Pro-
fessor of Peace Studies at Bradford Uni-
versity, England. In Biotechnology,Weapons
and Humanity, a newly published report
which he wrote for the BMA,he examines
the whole question of how the revolution in
biotechnology might be used to attack the
genetic constitution of an ethnic group.
“The social and ethical safeguards which
m ay prevent ethnic conflict and we a p o n s
d e velopment need to be discussed urgently,”
he said in an interv i e w. Although scientists
Genetic inform ation is already being used
in some countries to “ i m p r ove ” b i o l o gi c a l
we a p o n s ,e . g . by equipping them with agents
to provide increased antibiotic resistance—
and it is likely that this trend will accelerate as
the knowledge and understanding of its appli-
c ations become more widely know n .
In the hands of
terrorists or cult groups
The problem of the proliferation of bio-
l o gical weapon research has been aggr avat e d
by fall-out from the collapse of the form e r
S oviet Union. Most of the nearly 30,000
scientists who were invo l ved in biologi c a l
research in the USSR during the 1980s are
n ow out of a job because of the country ’s eco-
nomic diffic u l t i e s. Last ye a r , some of them
disclosed that they had been approached by
c e rtain countries which have shown part i-
cular interest in learning about microbes
t h at can be used in war to destroy or protect
c r o p s , as well as genetic engi n e e ring tech-
niques that could be used to make deadly
g e rms for which there may be no antidotes.
Dando argues that scientists in countri e s
t h at belonged to the former Soviet Union
should be dive rted from invo l vement in pro-
grammes with sinister motives by schemes
such as scientist-to-scientist exchanges, j o i n t
research projects and the conve rsion to civi-
lian use of laborat o ries and institutes once
a s s o c i ated with the Soviet military effort .
One prospect that alarms arms control
experts is that biological weapons will fall
into the hands of terrorist or cult groups.
Twe l ve people were killed and 5,000 injured
year that marks the 50th annive rs a ry of the
d i s c ove ry of the structure of DNA by Ja m e s
Watson and Francis Crick.
D e t e rmining the sequence of the DNA
bases in the entire human DNA will eve n-
tually determine where genes are located and
w h at instructions are carried in a part i c u l a r
section of DNA. This inform ation will be
used by researchers to understand the func-
tion of genes and how they cause disease.
Genome research has already helped scien-
tists to identify genes associated with dia-
b e t e s ,breast cancer and A l z h e i m e r ’s disease.
The project also opens up an arr ay of ethical
dilemmas relating to such questions as genetic
testing for predisposition to hereditary diseases
and the possible use of genetic inform at i o n
about individuals for commercial purp o s e s
( e . g . insurance) and the sharing of know l e d g e
b e t ween rich and poor countri e s.Another key
issue is that of the intellectual property of

r e s e a r c h e rs , especially since pri vate compa-
nies have entered the gene-mapping race.
UN E S C O has adopted a Unive rsal Decla-
r ation on the Human Genome and Human
Rights which was endorsed by the United
N ations on 9 December 1998.Among its sti-
p u l ations is the follow i n g : “No one shall be
subjected to discri m i n ation based on genetic
c h a r a c t e ristics that is intended to infringe or
has the effect of infri n ging human ri g h t s ,f u n-
damental freedoms and human dignity.” n

in the Tokyo subway in 1995 in an attack
launched by the Aum Shinry k yo cult using
s a ri n , a lethal nerve gas that produces
asphyxia.Investigations later revealed that
the cult group had had no problem in
recruiting scientists to work on biological
weapons but could not employ the we a-
pons due to lack of a proper delive ry system.
As a first step in coping with the problem
of potential new biological we a p o n s , a rm s
control experts are calling for the bolsteri n g
of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Conve n-
tion (BTWC),an intern ational treaty signed
in 1972.The convention prohibits its signa-
t o ries from deve l o p i n g, p r o d u c i n g, s t o c k p i l i n g
and acquiring biological we a p o n s.
Dando points to the fact that though
142 nations have signed the convention so
fa r , this has not deterred countries from
d e veloping or obtaining knowledge on bio-
logical weapons. “This is mainly because
there is no verification system attached to
the convention,” he says.
Monitoring  the uses
of genome mapping
“The threat of new genetic weapons is
clearly going to be an ongoing problem for
the intern ational community,” s ays Michael
M o o d i e , President of the U.S.-based Che-
mical and Biological A rms Control Insti-
t u t e . “Such weapons are covered by the cur-
rent treat y,but this needs to be strengthened
by an effective ve ri fic ation protocol and fully
implemented so we can be sure states comply
with their obligat i o n s. A va riety of tools
should be used, including arms control,
e x p o rt controls and enhanced intelligence
capability to monitor countries of concern .”
The BMA report cited earlier says pro-
fessional scientists and physicians should
shoulder their ethical responsibilities and
take no part in biological and genetic we a p o n
p r o j e c t s. It calls for close monitoring of deve-
lopments in biotechnology worldwide and
open debat e ,p a rticularly in relation to the use
of genome mapping. H owe ve r ,“These mea-
sures can minimize the threats but not eli-
m i n ate them,” s ays Nat h a n s o n .
There is also gr owing concern about the
misuse of genetic inform ation available on
I n t e rn e t . Scientists worldwide share infor-
m ation on new findings in biological research
through Internet which could be manipu-
l ated by pri vate gr o u p s. N athanson say s
I n t e rnet service prov i d e rs have an ethical
o b l i g ation to ensure inform ation on biologi c a l
weapons is not available on their we b s i t e s.
One big problem in monitoring is how
to distinguish between research carried out
for good and evil ends. The fact is that
genetic research which develops specific
therapeutic agents is scientifically indistin-
guishable from research to develop a lethal
or disabling agent targeted at specific clus-
t e rs of genes in an ethnic gr o u p.This makes
it all the more necessary to make sure that
information is used for positive purposes.
According to Dando, one avenue to be
explored is to ensure that developing coun-
t ries are gi ven the opportunity to share the
benefits of the modern revolution in bio-
t e c h n o l o gies which can be used for disease
control and economic deve l o p m e n t . I n
return they would be required to promise
that malign research would not be carried
out in their laboratories. “This is currently
being negotiated by countries which are
party to the BTWC,” he says. n
