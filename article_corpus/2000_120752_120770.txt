D i re c t o rs 
in exile
Rithy Panh  (Cambodia), Alejandra
Rojo (Argentina) 
and Abderrahmane Sissako
(Mauritania) have all 
settled in France, but the 
pull of their home 
country permeates their 
artistic lives
How did you get into film?-----------------
Rithy Pa n h: It wasn’t something I chose.
Film came to me when I went into exile
after what I went through in Cambodia.
If I’d stayed there, I probably would
never have become a fil m m a k e r. It isn’t a reco-
gnized profession there.But  I’ve always been aware
of the power of images. In Cambodia,I lived next
door to a film studio, so I used to peak in on the
shoots.
The Khmer Rouge genocide is a genocide with
no recorded images except for photos. As such,
everything is  photographed in people’s memories.
What you’ve seen and lived through is always run-
ning through your mind. It was this—the process of
remembering things—that drew me into film. My
desire to make them was born here in Fr a n c e.Wh e n
I arrived in 1979, I knew my work would have to
relate to what had happened in Cambodia.After a
w a r, either you keep quiet or you try to piece toge-
ther what’s been shattered.I dabbled in painting and
w r i t i n g, and then, one day, someone lent me a
camera for a party at a vocational college where I
was taking a carpentry course. Some people made
cakes for the occasion, I made a little film.I knew
then, at 20, where my vocation stood. I attended
classes at IDHEC [a prestigious French film school]
and made my first documentary, Site Number Two,
about a Cambodian refugee camp.
Alejandra Rojo: When I was a kid, I wanted to
be a painter. But I was living in a very political envi-
r o n m e n t ,not an artistic one.My father was a lawyer
and my mother a psychoanalyst.When I was about
1 5 , I lost interest in painting, graduated from high
school and began studying science. But two years
l a t e r, I dropped all that and decided that I wanted to
make fil m s.So I followed classes and took the plunge.
Abderrahmane Sissako: I was brought up in
Mali and returned to Mauritania to finish high
s c h o o l . Right after that, I went off to the Soviet
U n i o n , like thousands of other African students. I t
was easier to go there than to Fr a n c e. I had a scho-
larship to study film and I started making my own.
How did you come to France?
Pa n h: Because of the Khmer
R o u g e. I was 17 years old. M a n y
members of my family were killed
and the rest of them fled to France.
R o j o: I came here when I was 12,
as an exile. My father defended poli-
tical prisoners.The whole family had
to leave A r g e n t i n a . It was the time of
the death squads—22,000 people
d i s a p p e a r e d . We were apparently on
the target list.
Sissako: I came in 1993 because
my film October had been chosen for
the Cannes Film Fe s t i v a l . I was
invited to stay here and continue fil m m a k i n g. I
spent 12 years in Russia and now I’m in Fr a n c e. Fo r
how long, I don’t know.
What are the pros and cons of living outside yo u r
own country? Does it affect the way you make fil m s ?
Pa n h: When you’re an exile, you don’t really
have an identity any more.Whether in Cambodia or
France, I’m kind of at home everywhere and now-

here. Far and close from everything. I’m interested in
this distance. It allows you to stand back and to see fur-
t h e r, to grasp the shape of things.The lesser evil for an
exile is managing to make use of this. I go back to
Cambodia and then I leave it again. I t ’s a natural cy c l e.
Coming back to a Paris film studio is somewhat like
going on a retreat.I recharge my batteries. Cambodia
is a cultural desert.
R o j o:Exile changes your whole destiny. No matter
w h a t ,i t ’s always uprooting. But half my family wasn’t
killed or put in concentration camps.
I had a two-week sea voyage and
then understood what a drop in
status meant. You were someone
back home and  suddenly you
became nobody. In the end, t h a t ’s
not such a bad thing. You’re less at
the mercy of your social background.
You see things from a more personal
standpoint. Having to work in ano-
ther language creates a style simply
because you’re not fully in tune with
what’s being said.I’m always aware
of the gap, that what’s one way here would be different
there. Many immigrants share this feeling of living a
double life.But as an artist, I manage to go beyond this
stage.A film,a painting, a piece of music are all coun-
tries in themselves.You don’t need a country once you
have that.Exile is a moderately interesting life expe-
r i e n c e, but it’s fascinating from a cinematographic
standpoint.It’s a source of new ideas and stories. Our
age makes me think of some science fiction stories
about inter-galactic peoples who move about and
migrate on a mass scale. When I sit down to write, I
don’t tell myself that I’m going to write stories about
exiled people.They just come to me, from deep down
in my sub-conscious. You don’t make the films you
want.You make the films that have to be made.
Sissako: Exile is always a handicap. But distance
allows you to look at your own country, its past, i t s
history from a slightly foreign viewpoint. When we
talk about home, we tend to hesitate, to go by feel.It’s
a delicate process that you can lose a grip on at any
m o m e n t . Maybe we have more sensitivity. S o m e t i m e s
you choose to be silent and allow people to interpret.
What ties do you have with your native country?
Pa n h: I ’ve just made my first film in Fr a n c e,a docu-
mentary about the Cambodian community here. I ’ve also
shot one film in Mali. I ’ve made all the others in Cam-
b o d i a . I’m interested in living with the people there.
The film nearly becomes secondary.H e r e,I feel tired and
s t r e s s e d .Th e r e, the people who have to fight to survive
give me strength. Survivors always feel guilty.To escape
from this strange feeling, I need to be with other people.
The camera lets me do that—lets me say I have words,
dreams and thoughts to express, that I really belong to
the world. Film has helped me restore my own dignity.
In Cambodia, I’m also helping to train filmmakers and
t e c h n i c i a n s,with assistance from the Ministry of Culture.
Over the past 10 years,w e ’ve put together a good team.
Rojo: I don’t go back to Argentina very often.The
last time, I felt I was living in an American colony.
Here in France, you don’t realize how fast globali-
zation is racing ahead.The countries of the South are
becoming colonies,holiday camps or military camps
of the great American empire. There’s a film to be
made about that. I ’d go back to Argentina to work,
but that’s all. I t ’s to do with my family being
r e j e c t e d . I don’t see anything too exciting about
being Argentinian and it’s very hard to feel a cultural
identity there. I t ’s a sort of recent patchwork of
which I’m a good example.My maternal grandmo-
ther was Lithuanian and her husband was an Egyp-
tian who spoke Yiddish.My paternal grandfather,
who was a Spanish Catholic, married a Russian-
German Protestant.
S i s s a ko: I often go to Mali and Mauritania—
usually about twice a year, often to check film loca-
t i o n s. I go back and forth. Each trip enriches and
alters the story and each casting changes the film in
some way.
Do you have any urge to live in your native country?
Pa n h:D e fin i t e l y.But there’s no movie business
in Cambodia. I t ’s easier to find the money in Fr a n c e.
I raise money here but I keep to small Cambodian-
scale budgets.
R o j o: I think there’s something in Latin A m e r i c a
t h a t ’s worth really looking into,but I haven’t found
it yet.
S i s s a ko: I know I’ll go home one day. I’m in
France for financial reasons. I’m starting to be
known and I’m getting some interesting proposals
from producers and television. I t ’s very hard to
work in our countries.Filmmakers are on their own.
There’s no money to be had,no local film industry,
no film schools. Africa’s always had this dearth of
production and things are just getting worse. No
more than 10 films a year are made on the whole
c o n t i n e n t . You can’t have a ski champion in a
country where there’s no snow.
What are your plans?
Pa n h: Apart from fiction and documentaries, t h e
project closest to my heart is the gathering of a fil m
archive on the Cambodian genocide.Over the next
20 years, the witnesses will either die or their memo-
ries will become distorted.We live in a society domi-
nated by images. If we don’t make our own images,
we won’t exist any more.The countries of the South
are going to die of that too, after already being eco-
nomically pillaged.
Rojo: I’m working on a story about a woman
with a split personality.About a robot that replaces
a woman.
Sissako: My next film will be about exile. I’m
going to try to tell the story of people who apply to
emigrate,who are waiting to leave. I’d like to show
that exile begins before the voyage itself. My films
are often linked to my own life.At the same time, I ’l l
try to tell how I got into film. ■
