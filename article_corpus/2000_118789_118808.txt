The journalist: a disappearing
species in the online world?
What is the role of the journalist in the new, direct-access media system? Is the journalist obso-
lete? I believe not.I believe that in an online world where there is an abundance, in many
cases an over- a b u n d a n c e, of information the role of the journalist becomes more important than
e v e r. But that role must change. Journalists must amplify their role as sense-make r s, helping direct
the public to reliable information, and pointing out when certain online information should be ques-
tioned because of the partial nature of its source.
Journalists in the digital age must be even more zealous in their pursuit of the truth, of balance
and fairness. These values are not necessarily part of the tradition of other “content”providers
who now have a ready-to-use medium to reach a global audience.
D e m o c racy depends on the effectiveness of its journalistic institutions to provide a fourth bra n c h
of government to act as a check on the other three, the executive, the legislative and the judicial.
J o u r n a l i s m ’s only real power comes in the court of public opinion, and without credibility, this power
is lost.
In the age of online digital media, entrepreneurial journalists and journalism organizations must
seek new ways to re-engage an increasingly global public without sacrificing any of the tra d i t i o n a l
newsroom values of accura c y, f a c t - c h e c k i n g , use of reliable sources and independence from com-
mercial,governmental and other influences. If it can succeed in striking this balance, journalism
will enjoy a renaissance in the 21st century, and society will be its benefic i a r y.A failure to find this
balance can only lead to the collapse of impartial journalism and the loss of reliable information
upon which society today relies for self-governance. J.V.P.■
