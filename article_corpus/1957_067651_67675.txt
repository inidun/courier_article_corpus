JEAN COCTEAU
Fishermen's chapel
For twenty years or more the fishermen of Villefranche-
sur-Mer, a tiny port on the French Riviera had an
unusual place to hang their fishnets and store their
tackle the 14th century chapel of St. Peter, an aban¬
doned Romanesque barrel-vault, situated by the sea.
Last year, they were persuaded to store their parapher¬
nalia elsewhere and handed over the keys to Jean Cocteau,
who has spent a good six months decorating the chapel.
This month it will be officially opened to worshippers and
rededicated to St Peter, the patron saint of fishermen.
Cocteau has painted a series of murals running along
the walls and vaulted ceiling of the chapel. Drawn in
flowing linear style, they depict scenes in the life of St.
Peter and are done in charcoal brightened with mono¬
chrome painting. Angels in the Cocteau manner, looking
as if they had escaped from his poems, bridge the vaults.
"As an artist", he has said, '"I wanted to create a chapel
in which the poet, without losing any of his prerogatives,
would become immediately accessible to fishermen and
simple people."
These frescoes, his first religious subject, represent the
peak of Cocteau's artistic activities. In previous years, he
has held several exhibitions of his paintings and illustrat¬
ed many of his own books: for his novel, Les Enfants
Terribles, he produced 60 drawings, and he has
assembled his pen-drawings in albums under the gener¬
al title Graphic Poems.
At the age of 17 Cocteau published his first book of
verse, La Lampe d'Aladin (1909), and since that time has
been faithful to his motto: "In art one must serve the
nine muses". He has even served a tenth muse, the cinema.
His artistic activities range from literature, theatre and
music, to ballet, circus and painting. Innovator in letters
and the cinematographic art, Jean Cocteau, who has
described himself as "'having always lived standing up",
was recently honoured with a seat in the hallowed Aca¬
démie Française.
