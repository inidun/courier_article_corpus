GREENWATCH
Climate change:
the great debate
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
| Some people see the Third
Conference of the States Par¬
ties to the Framework Convention
on Climate Change, which is being
held in Kyoto (Japan) this month, as
the last chance to fight global warm¬
ing by taking urgent mandatory
steps. Others see it as a chance to
argue with the pessimistic predic¬
tions of most scientists.
One might ask why, just for
safety's sake, every country doesn't
immediately agree to curb green¬
house gas emissions. The answer is
that the necessary steps would be
unpopular, would lose votes and cost
a great deal. Governments handle
energy and transport matters with
kid gloves.
IS IT GETTING WARMER OR NOT?
In the past, people cither adjusted
to the climate or migrated. These
days, humanity seems capable of
influencing climate itself. Accord¬
ing to the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) we have
altered, and are continuing to alter,
the balance of gases in the atmos¬
phere. This is especially true of the
greenhouse gases carbon dioxide
(C02), methane (CH4) and nitrous
oxide (N20) as well as water
vapour, which is the largest con¬
tributor to the natural greenhouse
effect, but whose presence in the
atmosphere is not directly affected
by human activity.
These gases make up only 0.1%
of the earth's atmosphere, which is
78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen.
Without the greenhouse effect
caused by the presence of an enve¬
lope of these gases, the earth would
be 30°C colder than it is. Since the
beginning of the industrial era, we
have produced enormous quantities
of C02 by burning fossil fuels, and
by cutting down forests we have
reduced the planet's natural capac¬
ity to absorb it. Stock breeding and
agriculture produce mostly methane
and nitrous oxide. If gas emissions
continue to grow at the present rate,
the amount of C02 in the atmos¬
phere will have doubled between
1750 and the beginning of the 21st
century, and will perhaps even triple
between now and the year 2100.

Admittedly the situation is wor¬
rying, but some aspects of it are still
a matter of debate. Respected scien¬
tists at the University of Virginia and
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech¬
nology (MIT) argue that if the earth
has got warmer over the past 20 years,
the atmosphere has cooled because of
aerosols (ash from volcanic eruptions
or combustion, for example), and that
logically, the more industrialized
northern hemisphere should be warm¬
ing more than the southern, whereas
the opposite is happening. They also
say that modelling of the earth's cli¬
mate does not take into account the
clouds which can cool the lower
reaches of the atmosphere.
But the facts are stubborn. The
planet has become between 0.3°C
and 0.6°C warmer in the past cen¬
tury, the hottest for 600 years. In
the same period, the sea level has
risen by between 10 and 25 cen¬
timetres.
Facing the doubters is a formi¬
dable adversary: the Intergovern¬
mental Panel on Climat Change,
which was set up in 1988 jointly by
WMO and the United Nations Envi¬
ronment Programme (UNEP) and
involves 2,000 scientists around the
world. The Group was mandated to
assess the state of existing knowl¬
edge about climate change; the envi¬
ronmental and socio-economic

impacts of such change ; and possible
response strategies. Its First Assess¬
ment report, published in 1990, pro¬
vided the scientific and technical
basis for the United Nations Frame¬
work Convention on Climate Change,
whose ratification procedure was
opened at the Earth Summit held
in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. By May
1997, 166 countries had ratified the
Convention.
GOOD AND BAD PERFORMERS
Some countries have fulfilled their
commitments and taken steps to
limit C02 emissions. Early in 1997
the World Wide Fund For Nature
(WWF) published a list of good and
bad performers. Germany, for exam¬
ple, is set to meet its commitments to
cut its C02 emissions (800 million
tonnes a year) by the year 2000. The
Germans are expected to push at
Kyoto for further emission reduc¬
tions by 2005.
New Zealand, however, which
produces less than 300 million tonnes
annually, has no plans to reduce its
emissions and does not accept the
need to act urgently. Russia, with
more than 800 million tonnes (10.2%
of world C02 emissions in 1996), has
the same attitude. Next comes China
(13.5%), then Europe (19.6%), and
finally the leading polluter, the
United States (25%). Japan, the

world's fifth major polluter (5.6%),
does not intend to reduce emissions
by more than 5%. But it is in the
United States that the situation
seemed to be most inflexible when
the U.S. Senate unanimously passed
a resolution on 25 July stating it
would not ratify any climate agree¬
ment that did not require the par¬
ticipation of the developing world.
Since then things have changed
and President Bill Clinton announced
at a press conference on 22 October
1997 that he will propose at Kyoto to
reduce U. S . greenhouse gas emissions
to the 1990 level between 2008 and
2012, and to reduce them even fur¬
ther in the following five years. A $5-
billion budget will be earmarked for
the development of clean technolo¬
gies and industrialists will have nine
months to prepare pollution reduc¬
tion plans. President Clinton also reaf¬
firmed the need for participation by
developing countries. He noted that
a tonne of carbon emitted in
Argentina has the same effect as a
tonne of carbon emitted in the United
States. In principle developing coun¬
tries would only have to accept tar¬
gets beyond 2010.
The U.S. Information Agency's
Jim Fuller has said that his country
will present a draft treaty on world
climate change to the Kyoto con¬
ference. "The commitment to reach
legally binding targets and timeta¬
bles has sparked controversy in the
United States," he writes. " envi¬
ronmentalists and scientists who sup¬
port curbs on greenhouse gases say
they are crucial to preventing future
disaster. But some scientists and
industry representatives dispute the
accuracy of future warming predic¬
tions and oppose limits on energy
consumption they say will cause
irreparable harm to the U.S. econ¬
omy." He went on to say that "Most
studies suggest that reducing green¬
house gas emissions 20% below
1990 levels by the year 2010 . . .
would reduce the gross domestic
product of the United States by 1%
to 2% and cost nearly $100,000 mil¬
lion per year."
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT
But why, it may be asked, should
poor countries limit their emissions
when the rich countries of the North
are mainly responsible for global
warming?
Robert Wolcott, of the U.S. Envi¬
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA),
believes it is not a question of past
but future responsibility. "Emissions
of developing countries are and will
be increasing at a far more rapid rate
as they move through what you could
think of almost as a corridor of tech¬
nologies," he notes. "They will be
adopting technologies that are more
or less currently in place or have
recently been in place in the devel¬
oped world." This is why the EPA
advocates "a climate technology
transfer program in which we will join
with our developed-world partners
to supply the most advanced and
appropriate technology to emergent
economies to facilitate their sus¬
tained growth economically, but in
the least greenhouse-gas intensive
fashion."
The EPA is also considering a
greenhouse gas emissions trading sys¬
tem. This would involve fixing an

ï annual worldwide maximum emis¬
sion level. Then a maximum level
would be worked out for each coun¬
try, taking into account various fac¬
tors, and ensuring that all the indi¬
vidual country levels, when added
up, did not exceed the fixed world¬
wide level. Each country would then
grant greenhouse gas emission
allowances to companies within the
limit assigned to it. The trading
mechanism would work in the fol¬
lowing way: a country or a company
emitting less greenhouse gases than
its authorized total would be enti¬
tled to sell to another country or

company a "pollution allowance"
corresponding to the gap between
its real and authorized emission rate.
Wolcott recognizes though that
these ideas are causing concern in
some countries which view them "as
a form of carbon colonialism . . . and
feel that this puts them under the
influence of, and even control of,
investors from the developed world."
ALL OR NOTHING
A preparatory meeting for the Kyoto
conference was held in Bonn (Ger¬
many), the headquarters of the UN
Convention on Climatic Change, in
August 1997. The Convention's
Executive Secretary, Michael Zam-
mit Cutajar, has admitted the con¬
ference was a failure. "We are all
worried about the slow progress at
the Bonn meeting," he said. "There's
only a short time now to build up
the necessary political will to pro¬
duce a solid agreement at Kyoto."
Such lack of political will , which
was also evident at the June 1997
Earth Summit in New York, is dis¬
turbing and bodes ill for the Kyoto
conference. The oil and coal indus¬
tries, as well as the most unenlight¬
ened industrialists, fear for their
profits, since they might well be
heavily taxed.
On the other hand, Kyoto will be
a special opportunity to promote
clean energy sources which, when
developed, could at last be gener¬
ally affordable.
