The Educated
Man in 1984
by Dr J. Bronowski
Director of Research, British National Coal Board
THE education of the man of 1956
was largely formed twenty or
thirty years ago. When we ask
what to-day's education should do,
the man we have in mind to inform
and to form is the man of twenty or
thirty years hence. Thus the year
1984, the year of George Orwell's
book, carries a symbolism which our
education ought particularly to keep
in mind.
Education in schools and universi¬
ties has many functions. I shall con¬
fine myself to two, both of them do¬
minated by the skills which we need
in order later to carry on adult life.
Education in this sense is learning to
do something quite precise.
Even so, there are different things
to be learned, or rather there are
different purposes for which we learn
things. The young man at night
school learns book-iteeping in order to
keep books. An engineering student
learns the calculus in order to become
an engineer. A historian learns
Medieval Latin in order to read
documents. These are examples of
education for a very specific purpose,
and since this purpose often helps us
to earn our living, I think of it as
vocational education.
But I knew a man once, a school¬
master who had just retired from
teaching mathematics, who then
learned Italian in order to read
Dante. What he learned was indeed
precise, and the purpose specific, yet
I cannot feel that this was vocational
education. The learner was fitting
himself to derive from the work of
Dante a larger, deeper sense of the
many-sidedness of human life than
had reached him in translation. At
sixty-five, he was fitting himself not
to make a living but to live.
Humanism doomed unless...
This is the purpose for which we
learn English and arithmetic
and history at school, for these
are subjects which do not stop at a
single need, at writing letters and
making out bills. They inform and
hold together the fragments of so¬
ciety, so that they form and, in a
sense, are its culture.
But my subject is science as part of
culture, and a scientific education as
a necessary part oí our cultural
education. Our society is divided
between the past and the future, and
it will not reach a balanced and
unified culture until the specialists
in one field learn to , share their
language with those in another. The
scientist has much to learn still, in
language and thought, from the
22
humane arts. But the scientist also
has a contribution to make to culture,
and humanism is doomed if it does
not learn the living language and the
springing thought of .science.
The syllabus of schools and univer¬
sities is always in movement from
vocation to culture. No doubt
reading was first taught as a strictly
useful skill ; certainly Latin and
Greek ;were first taught for clerical
use. Some subjects in the syllabus
remain vocational subjects: others
turn out to have a wider range of
uses. Men find that, whether they
are farmers or mechanics or bank
clerks, they, cannot do without them.
So in time these subjects cease to be
the prerogative of specialists and
become general needs.
From creches to reactors
Science was once the concern of
specialists, and now enters into
the life of everyone. The switch¬
board and the motorcar, the treat¬
ment of flour and of cigarette paper,
the building of a creche and of an
atomic pile are our daily concerns. We
simply cannot dissociate ourselves
from the hot-water system, the
airmail, frozen food and the linotype
machine. A nation where the
screwdriver and the fusebox are still
handled with suspicion is to-day a
backward nation.
When a society is penetrated by
technical skills and engines, the
decisions of State cannot be taken
out of the context of science. No
voter can advocate a policy on
myxomatosis without a general sense
both of the ecology and of the econo¬
mics of rabbits. And no Member of
Parliament or minister can make
intelligent judgments on such a
profound issue as the secrecy
which surrounds fundamental atomic
research until he is at home in the
tradition of science since Giordano
Bruno and Galileo. The fate of a
nation may hang on a error of
judgment here.
To - make science familiar as a
language, we must start in the
schools. General science courses
suffer from two handicaps: they
have to be planned as part of the
education of the scientist as well as
the non-scientist, and they are tied
to the rather dull resources of school
laboratories.
Fixing our minds more especially
on the non-scientist, I would propose
less mathematics than he does now
but more of a more practical kind.
The language of mathematics is still
taught as a dead language: there
should be more translation from
everyday facts into mathematics,
and back into the everyday. Statis¬
tical methods should be made part of
the education of everyone in schools
and universities, for only from sta¬
tistics can the non-scientist learn to
use averages and approximations.
My second proposal concerns the
teaching of physics and chemistry:
I think that the atomic picture
should be made central to both
subjects much earlier than at present.
The picture of the way atoms are
assembled can be made real and
exciting to the non-scientist because
it lends itself both to geometrical and
to statistical thinking.
My third plea is for more biological
teaching: there is a wealth of natural
material and natural interest in
plants and insects and in animal
processes which we allow to wither.
Biology offers us a path into scientific

thinking by way of the pleasures of
collecting and of skill of hand.
Liking to collect, to observe, to draw,
to take apart and to put together
this is how many children and adults
of little other education find their
way into the arts, and could find it
into science.
Fourthly, I think we need to teach
science as an evolution of knowledge.
For the evolution of science goes to
the heart of the scientific method: it
shows at each step how the logical
deduction from what seems to lie
behind the known facts must be
confronted with experience. We
make an induction, we put the
deductions from it to test, and on the
results we base a new induction this
is the progress of science.
To these four general points I will
add a fifth: that every boy and girl,
every undergraduate, should do one
small piece of personal scientific
research. It can be as simple as the
pitch of an insect's wing beat, or the
composition of a rock, or growing a
crystal ; but I believe that this small
practical experience could change the
light in which non-scientists see the
long and unsung vigils of the solitary
research worker.
Science must become part of our
culture or we shall fail, not to train
scientists, but to preserve our culture.
It is certain that the educated man in
1984 will speak the language of
science. Will he be a specialist, a
scientist or technician with no other
interests, wno will run his feliowmen
by the mean and brutal processes of
efficiency of George Orwell's book?
Or will he be a humanist, who is at
home in the methods of science, but
who does not regard them as mere
tools to efficiency. The choice be¬
tween 1984 and an earthly paradise
does not depend on the scientists, but
on the people for whom they work.
And we are all the people for whom
science works.
H.G. Wells used to write stories in
which tall, elegant engineers admi¬
nistered With perfect justice a society
in which other people had nothing to
do except to be happy. But a world
run by specialists for the ignorant is,
and will be, a slave world. By
leaving science to be the vocation of
specialists, we are betraying demo¬
cracy, so that it must shrink to what
it became in the decline of Athens,
when a minority of educated men
(who had to be paid to make a quor¬
um) governed 300,000 slaves. There
is only one way to head off such
disaster, and that is to make the edu¬
cated man universal in 1984.'
