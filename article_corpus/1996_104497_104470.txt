DOUDOU
N'DIAYE ROSE
Praise-singer, musician, and living repository of oral
history, the griot is an important figurein West Africa.
Doudou N'Diaye Rose, chief drum major in Dakar, is the
most famous living Senegalese griot. He has revolu¬
tionized the language of drums and spent many years
touring the world with his talented troupe.
How did your parents react
when they found out you loved
music?
Doudou N'Diaye Rose: Very
badly to start with. My great¬
grandfathers, whom I never
knew, were musicians. But
alter them no one in my family
had played music profession¬
ally. Several of my relations
were intellectuals. My father
worked as a chartered accoun¬
tant and had been a builder.
When I was about nine years
old my urge to play drums
became irresistible. I went all
round Dakar in search of a
suitable teacher. In the end I
chose El lladj Mada Seek,
who was a drum major. I spent
my whole childhood with him.
How did he teach you?
D. N'D. R.: He got us to come
round to his house. lie
explained the meaning of
rhythms and demonstrated
them on the drums. He let us
choose an instrument, then
asked us why we had chosen
it. In traditional Wolof music,
you have to be able to play
every kind of drum. First you
learn how to play the gorong,

then after a few months you go
on to another, then another.
We did little jobs for our
teacher in exchange for
lessons. When he went to play
at a baptism or a wedding, we
pupils would take his drums
along, lie only turned up at
the last minute. We also
helped him make his musical
instruments. Very early on I
began to go to various kinds of
ceremonies with more experi¬
enced musicians, and as they
thought I was talented they
let me play.
The study of percussion
instruments involves a great
deal of work, and I had to
practise alone. The trouble
was, my maternal uncle for¬
bade me to practise. When¬
ever he found out I'd played
truant in order to devote my
time to music he gave me a
good spanking. My teacher
came to talk to him and put in
a good word for me. My family
also pleaded with him to be
more indulgent, but for years
he kept on beating me and
he was a big man! We finally
came to a compromise. I
attended school regularly and
in return I was allowed to play
at weekends. I ended up
taking my school certificate,
then I went to technical col¬
lege. For some years I even
worked as a plumber.
Were you paid when you took
part in ceremonies?
D. N'D. /?.: Yes, and I took
the money back to my family.
Even then, they didn't want to
know. It went on like that until
one day, when I was nineteen,
my uncle came to give me yet
another spanking and I stuck
up for myself. It has to be said
that by then everyone was
already talking about me as a
musician. My teacher some¬
times accepted two engage¬
ments and passed one of them
on to me. I was invited all over
the country. In the end, when
my uncle realized how suc¬
cessful I was, he felt ashamed
and apologized to me. By the
time he died he had com¬
pletely redeemed himself. He
protected me with his lucky
charms and became my body¬
guard. I paid for him to go on
a pilgrimage to Mecca.
How did you build up your
international career?
D. N'D. R.: When I was
twenty-five, my teacher went
to live in Côte d'Ivoire, leaving
me his musicians and his
instruments. I became a chief
drum major and played with
the group until I was thirty.
Two years later, I decided I
wanted to learn Senegal's var¬
ious traditional rhythms and
their meaning, so I travelled all
over the country, spending
about three months in each
region. I would approach the,
elders, bringing them rice,
sugar, candles and other gifts
in exchange for their teaching.
I learned how news had been
announced with drums in
Senegal's ancient kingdoms.
The kings had their own per¬
cussion groups, and the leader
of the lamp drums, who was
known as the fara lamp,
passed on the king's messages
to the people. Each instru¬
ment had a well-defined role.
A drum called khin was
widely used at court. It is now
used by a Murid sect for
Muslim ceremonies. I also dis¬
covered a very old square
drum mounted on a frame, the

hen the drums dance:
the marriage of hands and feet
assiko, which comes from the
island of Corée.
A similar drum has been found
in some mountain communities
in Jamaica, where it is called
gumbe.
D. N'D. R.: The word gumbe
is also used in Senegal. It is
the name of a dance which is
also old accompanied by
singing, where women would
delicately raise their volumi¬
nous boubous. At a concert we
gave recently in Bahia the
audience was very enthusi¬
astic, because we were giving
them an opportunity to listen
to their musical roots. In
1960, when Senegal became
independent, I joined the
Senegal Ballet, and we went on
tours to Europe Czechoslo¬
vakia, Bomania, Turkey. Then
I decided to form my own
group and taught music to my
children. Now they work with
me. In 1980 I set up the
Rosettes, a female percussion
group, then the Roseaux, a
troupe of children aged
between four and twelve. They
performed in Japan last year.
How did you come to play with
Miles Davis?
D. N'D. /?.; Miles had heard
me on tape and asked me if I'd
like to play in the first half of
his concert at the Parc des
Expositions in Paris. When the
concert was over, he came and
improvised with us. I've also
played in the first half of con¬
certs by the Boiling Stones
and several French singers.
How did you learn to dance?
D. N'D. R.: By watching other
people. All drummers know
how to dance. It's vital to dance
well in order to play drums.
Do dancers depend on the
drums or do they invent their
own rhythms?
D. N'D. R.: They follow the
drums, but each dancer has his
or her favourite rhythms and
can ask the musicians to play
them. It's the drum major who
changes the rhythm, and he
has to know what kind of
instrument a particular musical
genre should be played on.
What's more, each dance has
its own symbolism.
Are old dances still
performed?
D. N'D. R.: Yes. The yaba,
for instance, which is a partic¬
ular favourite with older
women in the regions of Saint-
Louis, Dakar, Corée and
Rufisque. It can be danced for
hours on end. It was originally
a dance for courtesans. Only a
few years ago, women would
still put on their finest attire
and jewelry, and do their hair
in little plaits. They showed
off their dresses and gems as
they danced. Some of them
undid their hair, then plaited
it again as they continued to
dance. During this dance the
men would try to seduce the
women. Many couples first met
when dancing the yaba, and
some have since been married
for forty years! Another dance
is the uongue, which is per¬
formed by initiates after cir¬
cumcision, or danced to cele¬
brate the end of the harvest.
The farevoudiare is danced
by boys who are trying to
appeal to girls. If a girl finds a
dancer to her liking, she lets
him know by taking off her
headscarf and throwing it
down in front of him. Lebou'
women prefer the mari
gorong, where the rhythm is
provided by two drums. It is
danced at baptisms and wed¬
dings, as well as at circumci¬
sion ceremonies. Griots may
sometimes play for traditional
Senegalese wrestling bouts. On
these occasions they use a
drum with a low sound, which
has the same name as the
sport itself: lamp. Here again
the drum major leads, with
ten or so drummers behind
him. Certain passages in
pieces played on the khalam
(a Wolof lute) may be accom¬
panied by mu filed drums.
Has the drums' repertoire
changed down the years?
D. N'D. R.: Yes, enormously.
The mbalax, for instance, is a
basic rhythm which came into
being in the 1970s and is
played by one or more drums
for festive dances performed
during certain ceremonies
such as baptisms and wed¬
dings. The younger generation
has changed. They know how
to dance to new rhythms,
though some youngsters some¬
times ask ine to play them old
ones. A very expressive dance
that is all the rage with the
Senegalese today is the
digente niit at nit (under¬
standing between human
beings), in which the dancers
put their hands on their hearts
and pretend to sleep. Its mes¬
sage is that everyone should
get on with everyone else and
open up their hearts from
dawn to dusk.
B Since the griots' usual role is
to keep traditions alive, were
your compatriots surprised when
you created new rhythms?
D. N'D. R.: i\oand I've
invented more than 500 of
them. Actually, that's what
helped me to become popular.
I didn't think it was right that
my predecessors created
rhythms and 1 didn't. I've been
inspired by events like football
matches. Creating is something
that is always uppermost in my
mind. I have composed the sig¬
nature tune of Senegal's televi¬
sion news, among other things.
It came to me one night when I
was in a hotel in Romania and
couldn't get to sleep. I could
hear windows banging, birds,
wind and rain, and I recorded all
those natural sounds on a little
tape recorder. When I got back
to Dakar, I went to the beach
and continued recording the
return of the pirogue boatmen,
the roar of the sea and, (luring a
football match, the cheering of
supporters, the sound of the
ball hitting the ground, and the
shouting of players. I had a
good think, then I translated all
those impressions into the lan¬
guage of drums.
How do you compose?
D. N'D. R.: J hole up in a
house I own near Dakar, so I
can get some peace and quiet.
I invent sequences of rhythms,
which I then work together.
As our music is passed on
orally, I've created a code of
gestures that enables me to
tell the musicians when to
increase their tempo or
volume, or when to change
rhythm. There are passages
where I improvise, and where
the other drummers have to
follow me.
What plans do you have for
the future?
D. N'D. R.: I would like to
organize a concert in France in
the year 2000 which would
demonstrate the wealth of
Africa's rhythmical and
musical heritage. I'll shortly be
touring Africa, from the
Maghreb to South Africa,
looking for musicians and
dancers. The show should
include rhythms, musical
instruments and costumes from
various African countries. I
