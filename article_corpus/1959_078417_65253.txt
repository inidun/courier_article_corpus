PEDESTRIANS, LOOK OUT!
Pedestrians in the over 65 age group are nowadays the chief
victims of fatal traffic accidents and the mortality rate is
still increasing. An increase of one hundred per cent or
more in the mortality from traffic accidents among pedestrians
in this age group ' occurred in- some countries between 1950 and
1955. The death rate for young pedestrians, however, rose much
less in some countries and even decreased in others, according to a
study by the World Health Organization (WHO) covering 18
countries.
A comparison of the average annual figures for the period
1950/52 with those for 1953/55 shows that in most countries the
number of pedestrians killed per million motor vehicles has
dropped; that countries with the sharpest increase in road traffic
have the. highest rate in fatal accidents, and that there are far
more men than women among the victims.
The greatest increase in the death rate of pedestrians over 65
years of age has taken place in the Netherlands where it rose
from 40.5 annually per million inhabitants to 96.8 an increase
of 139 per cent, while the increase for all ages was -, 69.6.
Increases were, noted in five other countries, in the following
order: Norway, Japan, Union of South Africa and Denmark.
During the same period (figures for 1950-52 compared with those
for 1953-55) the increase in the United Kingdom Was from 154.1
pedestrians aged over 65 killed per million inhabitants to 178.9
an increase of 16 per cent.
The only countries where a decline in mortality has taken place
are the United States of America (12.8 per cent less for those
aged over 65; 13.4 per cent for all age groups) and Ireland (7.3
per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively).

Of all countries covered, by the study, Japan has the highest
overall rate of traffic deaths with an annual average for the
period 1953/55 of 2,336 pedestrians killed 'per million motor
vehicles compared with 129 in the U.S.A. where there are many
fewer people walking on the roads.
Here are the average annual figures in 1953/55 for 16 countries
covered by the study.
