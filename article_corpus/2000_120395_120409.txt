While some circuit board assembly lines have
since been exported abroad, to Ta i wa n ,K o r e a ,I n d i a
and East Germ a ny, j a n i t o rs need not wo rry that their
e m p l oye rs will pull out and move elsewhere. T h e
gleaming office buildings in Cupertino and on the
man-made lake at Redwood Shores are not going
away.
But the janitors have also been caught in the cha-
r a c t e ristic bind of the new economy. Conditions of
e m p l oyment in California have gr own increasingly
tenuous as the new economy goes from strength to
s t r e n g t h .According to Working Pa rt n e rs h i p s , a labour
think-tank based in San Jo s e , 45 per cent of Califor-
nians now have no more than two ye a rs ’ tenure in their
c u rrent jobs,and temporary employment agencies bet-
ween 1993 and 1998 expanded by 182,900 people —
more than the net job gr owth in the software and elec-
tronic industries combined. The trend towa r d
o u t s o u r c i n g, as businesses pare down extraneous
e m p l oyees to concentrate on their core bu s i n e s s ,h a s
been felt throughout the wo r k f o r c e .
Fo u rteen ye a rs earlier, wo r k e rs like Mendoza
would have been in-house employees earning as
much as $14 an hour at such firms as Hewlett Pa c-
k a r d . But in the economic slump of the early 1990s,
the high-tech firms reaped a bonus, spinning off jani-
t o rial wo r k , along with such services as landscaping
and securi t y, to competing independent contractors
and substantially bri n ging down the cost of janitors ’
l a b o u r , to around $8 an hour.



Justice for Ja n i t o rs
in Silicon Va l l e y
◗ Victoria Elliott
By exposing the fla g rant gap between rich and poor, j a n i t o rs in A m e r i c a ’s high-tech heartland
have captured nationwide attention in their fight for decent working conditions
◗ Editor at the San Francisco
Chronicle
V icente Mendoza, an immigrant from Mexico,
t r avels about 15 miles (24 km) through the
rush hour traffic each morning from Oakland,
C a l i f o rn i a , to his first job in San Ramon, where he
s h ows up to work in a restaurant at 9 a.m. After five
h o u rs of wo r k , he stops home again for a couple of
h o u rs , then crosses the San Mateo Bridge over the San
Francisco bay and heads for the offices of A d va n c e d
Micro Devices, 26 miles (40 km) away in Sunny-
va l e .H e r e , he works as a janitor for his second shift of
the day, from 6 p. m . to 2.30 a.m.The office wo r k e rs
are gone; only a few late night stragglers see him
push his cart around, loaded with cleaning fluid and
m o p s. By the time he gets home again, i t ’s 3:15 a.m.
I t ’s surp rising he had any energy left over to
m a r c h ,but this spring Mendoza was one of the 5,500
j a n i t o rs in Service Employees Intern ational Union,
Local 1877, who came out with the Justice for Ja n i-
t o rs movement to rally in Sunny vale for decent wo r-
king conditions and better wa g e s.They wore red T-
s h i rts to make the point that invisible as they are,
working out of the public view, they were determ i n e d
to be seen.
Tenuous contracts
In this they succeeded. L ow-paid wo r k e rs in a
high-tech economy, they managed to capture at t e n-
tion nationwide as cast-offs of the unprecedented
gr owth in Silicon Va l l e y.Working relentlessly to try to
make ends meet, they have been left behind by an
i n d u s t ry that has gr own faster and produced more
wealth than any other in the history of the wo r l d .
At the World Trade Organization protests in Seat t l e
in December, there was little talk of this vo l atile nexus
of the world economy.And ye t ,according to one of the
S e attle protesters , Raj Jayadev—a young Bay Area acti-
vist who grew up in San Jose as the son of Indian
i m m i grants—Silicon Valley brings together the key
issues raised by globalizat i o n .
“The labour stru g g l e , the environmental degr a-
d at i o n , the inequities, the falling standards of living,
the importance of immigr ation — it’s all played out
on the shop flo o rs of Santa Clara County,” he say s.
Jayadev describes how he worked on the assembly line
at Hewlett Pa c k a r d , lifting boxes with an electri c a l
e n gineer from the Punjab, an Eritrean with a degr e e
in finance and a plant owner from Kerala, I n d i a , all of
whom were acutely conscious of their drop in stat u s.

The Silicon Valley giants in turn argued that they
had no responsibility for the wo r k e rs that the sub-
c o n t r a c t o rs brought in to sweep their marble halls.
Ja n i t o rs ’l e a d e rs ,h owe ve r ,h ave not hesitated to exploit
their position as a symbol of the vast disparities of
wealth in the area. “It was a larger question that
brought so much at t e n t i o n :W h at are we going to do
with our poor in today ’s booming economy ? ” s ay s
Mike Garcia, the president of the local janitors ’u n i o n .
“These people were working two to three jobs and
t rying to raise a fa m i l y. M e a n w h i l e ,t h e y ’re cleaning
the edifices of the fil t hy ri c h , the ove rnight billio-
naires and millionaires. H ow could they explain that
their janitors are living two to three families in a
g a r a g e ? ”
Tom Csekey, the union’s vice president, has spent
the last decade with Garcia building up union repre-
s e n t ation among janitors in the Bay Area from about
25 per cent of the janitorial workforce to more than
75 per cent this ye a r. In 1996, they were able to get a
living wage ordinance passed in Los A n g e l e s ; t h e
u n i o n ’s recent struggles have centred on immigr at i o n
issues and health insurance. “ We devised a strat e g y
where we were able to talk not so much about wa g e s
as about the conditions the wo r k e rs live in,” s ay s
C s e k e y.“The backdrop was going to the clients and
s ay i n g : ‘These people work within your wa l l s.Yo u ’ ve
got some level of responsibility here.’ ”
And fin a l l y, faced with a chorus of protest from
other unions, C atholic bishops and local politicians,
e xe c u t i ves at the biotech firm Genentech and the
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations company Pa c i fic Bell we r e
shamed into admitting responsibility for wo r k e rs they
had refused to acknow l e d g e .
The contract the janitors settled in June,w i t h o u t
going on stri k e , was the most generous in the history
of the union. It provides for an eight per cent annual
increase in their hourly pay over the next three ye a rs ,
from $7.64 or $8.04,depending on which county they
work in, to $9.64 or $10.04. But that is hardly going
to help them move out of the conve rted garages they
l i ve in, where a small two-bedroom house can fetch
$ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 .
After prevailing both in the Bay Area and in Los
A n g e l e s , the union is now concentrating on the jani-
t o rs of Sacramento.The expiration of the contracts it
has just negotiated has been synchronized, so that in
three ye a rs , 14,000 janitors across California will be
acting in concert .
The dispossessed
Much of the workforce of Silicon Valley is as ye t
u n o r g a n i z e d , from the crews at Internet start - u p s
who work 14-hour days and camp out in their offic e s
to the lower echelons. In the almost entirely non-
unionized “clean rooms” t h at assemble circuits,A s i a n
wo r k e rs are often wa ry of joining a union, s o m e t i m e s
because their immigr ation status is uncert a i n .
But among the ranks of the janitors ,m a ny of whom
are also undocumented, the Mexican tradition of orga-
nizing is strong. “They understand the concept of
u n i o n i z at i o n ,”s ays Garcia.“ T h e y ’re not confused at all
t h at our powe rs lie in our ability to come together.”
Garcia is anxious to make common cause with the
increasingly dispossessed middle classes.The stri k e ,
he feels,has helped to turn around the climate of xe n o-
phobia that swept through California over proposed
a n t i - i m m i grant legi s l at i o n . “ People look at immi-
grants in a much more positive vein today,” he say s ,
“as hard-working people trying to advance them-
s e l ve s.”
M a rianne Steeg, staff director of the South Bay
Labor Council, argues that the janitors ’s t rike helped
to draw attention to questions of the area’s social
c o n t r a c t , putting the need for affordable housing,
t r a n s p o rt ation and health care firmly at the top of the
political agenda.
“School teachers , fir e m e n , health wo r k e rs — so
m a ny of our wo r k e rs who can no longer afford to live
here —no longer identify with the upper-middle class,
but with the working poor,” she say s , adding that the
s t rike put a dent in the shining armour of the high-tech
firm s.“They can no longer claim that the prosperi t y
of Silicon Valley means prosperity for all.” ■
