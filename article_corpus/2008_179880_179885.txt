For Jabu Sithole, a trip to the 
clinic was nothing less than trau-
matic. The soft-spoken mother of 
five could not read or write and her 
illiteracy had a profound impact on 
her children’s health. 
“I have five children. Each child has 
a clinic card bearing his or her name. 
But if one of the children got sick, I 
did not know which card to take. I 
had to take the sick child and all five 
cards and ask the clinic sister to find 
the right one. The nurses laughed at 
me. I would delay taking my children 
to clinic because I was embarrassed 
and ashamed.” 
But after just three months of 
attending literacy classes, Jabu could 
recognise each child’s name – her life 
was beginning to change. Not only 
was Jabu learning to read and write, 
she was learning how to cope in a 
place called Kwanibela. 
Kwanibela is an isolated area deep in 
rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

One of the two UNESCO Confucius 
Prizes for Literacy was awarded 
this year to the NGO Operation 
Upgrade (South Africa) for its 
Kwanibela project. Its innovative 
methods have proven effective in 
promoting rural women’s literacy and 
empowerment. An example to follow.

50 kilometres away. No wonder some 
call it “God’s forgotten land”. 
For the past eight years there has 
been little rain. Aside from a lack of 
water, there is no electricity or 
phone lines, maize is considered a 
luxury and only 26 percent of the 
population is literate. 
Some people, usually men, leave 
their families and head for the big 
city in the hope of a job, while 
others try to eke out a living on the 
tribal land that is home to some 
26 000 people.
Reading brings 
nourishment
However, over the past four years, 
there has been a glimmer of hope. 
Jabu, and many others like her, have 
joined The Kwanibela Project, an 
adult literacy project run by a non-
governmental organization called 
Operation Upgrade, founded in 
1996. 
The new project, started in 2004, has 
had considerable impact on Kwanibela 
residents. It offers mother tongue, 
English and numeracy classes using 
interactive methods and theme-
based lessons, integrating such 
issues as HIV and AIDS. 
”Literacy classes must reflect the 
social context. So while English is an 
option for the learners, HIV and AIDS 
and food security are part of almost 
every lesson. You cannot be in a lit-
eracy class if you can’t feed your 
children,” says Pat Dean, director of 
Operation Upgrade and the Kwanibela 
Project. It’s this approach that has 
resulted in 28 classes, facilitated by 
18 educators and catering for over 
400 adult literacy learners. 
A major achievement of the project 
has been the establishment - by the 
learners themselves - of food tunnels 
using hydroponic methods. Every 
one of the 28 groups has a tunnel 
which not only offers some form of 
food security but also a source of 
income. In fact, so successful has it 
been that one of  … 

 compare with driving into the area 
to start work: “Even though they 
cannot read `Operation Upgrade’ 
written on the car they know it’s us, 
and their warm welcome brings a 
smile to my face.”  
… the groups has been given a 
contract to supply spinach to a major 
South African supermarket group.
Fighting  
back against AIDS 
However, there are many challenges 
ahead, says training co-ordinator 
Itumeleng Petersen.: “It’s sad to see 
the men who come back from work-
ing in big towns like Johannesburg 
and Durban. Many are infected with 
HIV and they return to sometimes 
four or five wives. They infect them 
all. But through our work the women 
are learning to protect themselves 
and to access medication when they 
are infected.” 
AIDS education is a huge part of the 
project. The literacy educators are 
also trained to take the AIDS mes-
sage out to the community and incor-
porate it into their literacy lessons. 
The Kwanibela Project has even tack-
led the critical problem of water 
head on. Some learners have been 
provided with `hippos’ (a rolling 
device that makes water transporta-
tion easier) and others have had 
their homes fitted with rain water 
harvesting systems. 
Such is the commitment to the 
project that the majority of learners 
walk for hours to their literacy 
classes – it’s not uncommon to walk 
20 kilometres a day just to learn. But 
clearly the rewards far outweigh the 
efforts. Says Petersen, ”When they 
start stringing a sentence or two 
together you can see their eyes light 
up. To them it’s like striking gold.” 
Nomonde Diko, a Kwanibela Project 
trainer, adds that nothing can 
Kwanibela “pupils” have greenhouses that ensure food security and provide revenue.
