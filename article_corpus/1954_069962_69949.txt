A he recent decisions - of the
United States Supreme Court
outlawing racial segregation in
public schools have. finally settled the
question as to whether segregation
per se is a form of discrimination
which is inhibited by our funda¬
mental laW. These decisions also
demonstrate that one's right to be
free from distinctions based upon
race can come only from the law.
They finally show that some laws
do not give this freedom. This brings
us to a consideration of the distinc¬
tion between the adjudicative and
legislative processes.
Adjudication is the function of
courts. It decides and enforces indi¬
vidual liabilities as they stand on the
basis of existing facts and under
existing law. On the other hand,
legislation is rule-making. It creates
a right, duty or status directed toward
the correction of a situation rather
than particular persons and is inde¬
pendent of the existence of any pre¬
vious right, duty or status. There¬
fore, adjudication may be called anti¬
dotal laW, a remedy for counteracting
injurious effects, whereas legislation
is prophylactic law, a means of pre¬
venting an anticipated harmful effect.
In the combat against racial discri¬
mination, we cannot afford to ignore
the importance of resort to the legis¬
lative process. Historically, the earli¬
est blows delivered against racial¬
ism in America were legislative
22

enactments. For example, in 1777 and
1846 Vermont and Rhode Island,
respectively passed . laws forbidding
slavery in their lands. In 1855, Mas¬
sachusetts prohibited racial segrega¬
tion in its school systems. The
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments to the Federal Consti¬
tution are also a species of legisla¬
tion: and, of course they were intend¬
ed to forbid states to indulge in
racial discrimination. Furthermore,
- federal statutes were enacted in 1870
and 1875 to implement
these Amendments.
Although this federal
legislation did not survive
the test of judicial chal¬
lenge, it pointed the
way for states to breathe
life into the Civil War
Amendments. The states
responded with a flurry of
legislation designed to
prohibit racial discrimi¬
nation in many- walks
of life. After the turn
of this century, there
was little activity on the
part of the states and
none by the federal go¬
vernment other than a co¬
dification of the remanants
of the Civil Rights Act of
1870. But a resurgence of
activity in this area has
developed in the states in
the past decade.
A brief review of exist¬
ing laws against discrimi¬
nation reveals that only
17 states and the Dis¬
trict of Columbia have not
changed their laws sanc¬
tioning racial discrimina¬
tion in public schools.
Thus a majority of 31 sta¬
tes have passed acts which
have either expressly bar¬
red this type of discrimination or acts
which have been interpreted to effect
this result. Significantly, five states
have extended the coverage of their
laws to prohibit private schools from
practising racial discrimination.
In the field of public employment,
the federal government and fifteen
slates have enacted legislation bann¬
ing discriminatory hiring practices in
the agencies and operations controlled
by them. Eight states have required
that both governmental and private
employers cease racial discrimination
in their establishments; and penalties
have been provided to enforce these
laws. Four other states have passed
similar laws but without enforcement
provisions. At the municipal level,
some 29 cities have also passed fair
employment practices ordinances. It
is of some interest to point out that
only four of these cities are located in
ONE OF 1,629 NAACP LOCAL U.S. BRANCHES. Legal anion
undertaken by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People is financed by contributions from sympathetic individuals and organiza¬
tions as well as from the Association's 1,629 city and county branches spread
across 44 States. This is the entrance of one local NAACP branch in New York.
states with state laws enforcing non¬
discrimination in employment. Three
more cities have forbidden race dis¬
tinctions to be made in public em¬
ployment.
So-called "civil rights" laws have
been passed and are being enforced
in 19 states and the District of Co¬
lumbia. These laws generally for¬
bid racial' discrimination or any de
nial of full and equal enjoyment of
public accommodations (e.g. hotels,
restaurants, etc.), places of public
amusement (theatres, amusement
parks, etc.) and vehicles of public
transportation.
What does all of this mean? First,
each of these laWs prohibiting racial
discrimination represents a definitive
statement of governmental policy as
well as a standard for future conduct.
They have notified the persons sub¬
ject to their jurisdiction that indivi¬
dual prejudice must be
lost in the quantum of the
greater good. Such legis¬
lation also provides for
legal protection which mi¬
nority groups need in a
society where there is go¬
vernment by majority rule.
Furthermore, the educa¬
tional effect of laws
prohibiting discrimination
should not be minimized.
In this respect, the legis¬
lative process can promote
an individual's understand¬
ing of himself, his fellow
man, and the dynamics of
the democratic way of life.
While there is much to
be done even after laws
are passed, the setting
down in print of a law
which implements or ex¬
pands the principle that
our Constitution is- colour
blind is a tremendously
vital step. Of course,
anyone can validly com¬
ment thai legislation does
not extract the roots of
prejudice and intolerance.
These are personal con¬
quests. Neither will le¬
gislation completely pre¬
vent all oufcroppings of
discrimination in the spe¬
cific situations which il seeks to
correct. But it does create new rights,
duties and status which are consistent
with, rather than in derogation of,
the cherished aims of the democratic
creed "all men are free and equal in
the eyes of the law". For these rea¬
sons, therefore, we must develop both
preventive and corrective measures to
stamp out racialism in our land.
