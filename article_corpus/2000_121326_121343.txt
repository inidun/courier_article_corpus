Ian Ta t t e rs a l l :
the humans
we left behind
We have a history of diversity and
competition among human species which
began some five million years ago and
came to an end with the emergence of
modern humans.Two million years ago,
for example, there were at least four
human species on the same landscape.
Maybe they got along by basically
ignoring each other or even having
peaceful interactions.We don’t know.
In any event,we are now the sole
surviving twig on a big branching bush
produced by this process of evolutionary
e x p e r i m e n t a t i o n .We ’re n o t the pinnacle
of a ladder that our ancestors laboriously
climbed.
How do your views on human evolution
differ from traditional Darwinian notions? 
According to Darwin, you have
legions of organisms that over time
evolve themselves into a new species.
It’s like a fine-tuning process, guided by
natural selection, in which the individuals
best-adapted to their environment
reproduce and pass on their “ f a v o u r a b l e ”
characteristics, so that each generation
improves upon its predecessor.
So we tend to think of evolution in
terms of characteristics, rather than
s p e c i e s. For example, we speak of the
“evolution of upright walking” or the
“evolution of the hand,” often without
realizing that legs and hands can only
be part of the story. The reality is that
natural selection is a blind mechanism
which can vote up or down only on entire
o r g a n i s m s, warts and all. I n d i v i d u a l
organisms are mindboggingly complex
and integrated mechanisms: they succeed
or fail as the sum of their parts, n o t
because of a particular characteristic.
I t ’s the same with populations and
s p e c i e s.Species are out there competing
with others in a real world of limited
r e s o u r c e s.Wh a t ’s more, the ecologies of
which they form a part have an alarming
t e n d e n cy to change abruptly. If your
habitat is covered by an ice sheet, i t ’s
pretty irrelevant how well you are
adapted to the meadows and forests now
buried beneath the ice.
Finally in the Darwinian notion you
have a slow accumulation of changes over
generations leading to the creation of a
new species [when individuals of the same
lineage can no longer reproduce].
However a population will change
morphologically [biologically] with time
i ke most people, I was taught
to think of human evolution
as a linear chain, with a
“missing link” connecting apes
and a series of pro t o t y p e
humans in a process of
perfection reaching the pinnacle that we
occupy today. This is the traditional view
of paleoanthro p o l o g i s t s, veritable human
fossil hunters who try to piece together our
h i s t o r y. But the field is now incre a s i n g l y
divided and you are seen as the leader of
a new and growing camp. Please explain.
This notion of human evolution as
being a linear trudge from primitivism to
perfection is totally wrong. I came to
paleoanthropology from the study of
lemurs [monkey-like primates] in
Madagascar where you have a huge
diversity of animals. You cannot help
a s k i n g,“How did these creatures become
so diverse?” Yet this question is not
asked in paleoanthropology because
there is only one species of humans
today. Somehow we believe it is normal
and natural for us to be alone in the
w o r l d .Yet in fact, if you look at the fossil
r e c o r d , you find that this is totally
unusual—this may be the first time that
we have ever had just one species of
humans in the world.

Neanderthals have been known for 
150 years now. What can we possibly
find that nobody has noticed before ?
but this doesn’t necessarily lead to the
creation of a new species.For meaningful
genetic changes to take hold, t h e
population must be small. [ The larger the
p o p u l a t i o n , the more difficult it is for
major genetic changes to spread.]
So why haven’t we seen this diversity in
the fossil re c o rd? A c c o rding to tra d i t i o n a l
re a d i n g s, t h e re are about six or seven
species of humans. Yet you argue that
there are at least 17 and probably more.
Paleoanthropologists have basically
not paid enough attention to morphology
when comparing fossils and tend to
overlook differences in the shape of the
s k u l l , for example, the jaw or the spine.
They seem to think that once they have
measured the age and the brain size of the
f o s s i l , they can shoehorn it into a
particular species. It is very clear that over
the long haul, the brain size of hominids
has increased.H o w e v e r, this “ t r e n d ”h a s
distracted attention away from diversity
and led scientists to focus on continuity,
thereby reinforcing the notion that our
evolutionary history has been one of a
s l o w, single-minded progress from
primitiveness to perfection.
In addition,paleoanthropology has
been practiced largely by people who
come from a human anatomical
background.So many don’t know what
the rest of the living world is like.
You’ve spent the past seven years tra v e l l i n g
a round the world with a colleague, Je f f re y
S c h w a r t z ,to study every major human fossil
ever found.Why? 
We started out looking at the
N e a n d e r t h a l s, thinking “My God, t h e
Neanderthals have been known for 150
years now. What can we possibly fin d
that nobody has noticed before?”And
the very first one we picked up we saw
some structures inside the nasal cavity
that had never been noticed before. By
extracting more information out of the
record, we hope to get a better idea of
the diversity that exists out there.
I don’t think anyone has ever seen the
e n t i re fossil re c o rd . How did you get past
the politics in the field to gain access? 
It is very diffic u l t , especially for
more recently discovered fossils.They are
often very personal discoveries and there
is a tendency to say,“How can y o u m a k e
comments about a fossil I f o u n d ? ”A l s o,
most human fossils are found in the Th i r d
World and are sometimes seen as
bargaining chips for extracting money
from We s t e r n e r s. There can be a
tremendous amount of commissions,
bureaux and administrative hoops to jump
through before you can get access to the
f o s s i l s. But I have been very impressed
by the ways in which our colleagues have
helped us.The whole process could have
been a lot more gruesome and a lot more
e x p e n s i v e.
T h e re ’s a pile on your desk of about 2,000
pages describing the fossils which, a l o n g
with photos, will be published in a thre e -
volume set beginning this Marc h . T h e
photos alone will mark a major step in the
field because most PhD students never
even see the fossils they study.Why is it so
important just to describe, let alone
a n a l y z e, fossils that have been known for
over a century? 
One of the big problems has been
that everyone describes fossils
d i f f e r e n t l y. They use different
terminologies that are all based on
Homo sapiens and are not necessarily
appropriate for other kinds of fossil
hominids. By using Homo sapiens as a
kind of reference point or template, the
existing body of literature tends to distort
the fossil record. We ’re describing
everything the same way so that even if
you haven’t seen the original fossils, y o u
can consult and compare these
descriptions and come to your own
c o n c l u s i o n s. For the first time, h u n d r e d s
of fossils will be compatibly described.
By studying lemurs, you may have
developed the critical eye needed to
recognize diversity in human fossils. But
can you hold up the skull of one of our
ancestors, say a Neanderthal, and really
maintain the same detachment as when
looking at a monkey’s skull? 
I don’t think that you should look
at a human fossil with a different eye
than you would use for any other fossil.
They are both documents of species that
have now vanished.They are part of the
w o r l d ’s history of diversity. Besides if
you study hundreds of fossils, you don’t
have time to ponder the existential
aspects of being human.
Some might argue that this detachment is
your weakness. By focusing solely on
biological differences between fossils, y o u
pigeonhole them into narrow categories
that ignore other factors, namely culture.
I don’t think that we’re excluding
a n y t h i n g. But if you don’t start with
m o r p h o l o g y, y o u ’re going to be misled all
the way down the line. Once you have a
systematic structure into which to place
your species, then you can mix in
everything else—like the tools that they
used or their settlement patterns.
Do you ever find it surreal to try to piece
together such a vast history with such
m e a g re clues—bits of jaw here, some bra i n
case fragments there? It must take a solid
Mystery hangs over the top skull:
scientists are not sure if it is Neanderthal,

molecules have and we should always
believe molecules above morphology.”
But I don’t think that is true.There are no
magic bullets.We can widen the field with
genetic and isotope studies but we will
learn the most by persuading people to
look more closely at the existing fossils.
A battle is raging between sociobiologists
and cultural anthro p o l o g i s t s. B a s i c a l l y,
sociobiologists believe that humans all
s h a re some kind of essential nature
shaped by evolution. C u l t u ra l
anthropologists, in contrast,vehemently
reject universal statements about human
n a t u re and focus on local context in
explaining our behaviour. Where do you
stand?
I’m not certain about what the
cultural anthropologists stand for.But the
general feeling is that history is driven in
some way by cultural factors.Yet I see a lot
of randomness and contingency in history.
On the other hand, t h e s e
evolutionary psychologists [sociobiology
applied to our species] are completely
m i s l e d . For example, say they want to
explain something like violence.They will
treat it as a separate category and then
develop just-so stories as to why that
particular characteristic emerged in
e v o l u t i o n ,all the while forgetting that any
characteristic is embedded in a very
complex organism.
You’ve raised the issue of violence.Why do
you think we have a tendency toward s
a g g ression? Why can’t one genera t i o n
learn from the next and avoid conflict? 
We are psychologically so

ego to come to a firm conclusion.
N o, because you’re not creating
a n y t h i n g. Yo u ’re doing your best to
reconstruct evolutionary history and you
know that science in general is a system
of provisional knowledge—it’s not an
authoritarian system of belief where you
make “ a ” discovery and that stays
definitive for the rest of time. All that
scientists know is that what we believe
today is probably not going to be what
we believe tomorrow. Science is
grounded in doubt.
But some people are more willing to
accept this provisional nature than others.
You probably have colleagues fuming with
your ongoing list of human species.
I t ’s just because they’re not used
to it. I t ’s hard to convince people to
reconsider fossils they thought they have
known for over 30 years. But they are
more flexible with new fossils because
they don’t have any received wisdom
about species no one knew existed before.
This seems to be the heyday of geneticists.
There is a strong feeling that if they can
just manage to extract the DNA fro m
human fossils, we will finally get to the
bottom of our evolutionary history. D o
you think genetic re s e a rch will tra n s f o r m
the field of paleoanthropology? 
My feeling is that the two sets of
data are still pointing in the same general
direction of multiple human species.A n d
that is comforting. But there are paleo-
anthropologists out there feeling
depressed and saying, “Oh God! Our
data don’t have the resolution that

If you really want to understand human
n a t u re, don’t look to the past,
look to how people are in the pre s e n t
complex—or perhaps screwed up—at least
partly because of the way in which our
brains were built up over the ages,
structure on structure.While the old notion
of an inherent conflict between older and
newer brain structures and functions seems
o v e r s i m p l i fie d , it is self-evident that it is in
our controlling organ, the brain, that we
must search for the keys to the
contradictions that we all exhibit, e v e r y
d a y.
Hold on. I thought you just rejected the
evolutionary biologists’ penchant for
looking to biology to explain our  behaviour.
In my book Becoming Human, I
write that it may seem odd to devote
hundreds and hundreds of pages to ways
of looking at the fossil record and then
conclude that you cannot learn much
from it about how people behave today.
If you really want to understand what
humans are, don’t look to the past,look
to how people are in the present.
Not only do we look to the past to
u n d e rstand the present but we pro j e c t
the present on interpretations of the past.
For example, the Neanderthals are
veritable icons, yet they were just one
actor on a huge stage. How do you explain
this emotional attachment? 
Neanderthals were very happy
living in Europe for 200,000 years and
suddenly modern Homo sapiens s h o w
up and BOOM! Th e y ’re gone. So to
make it more palatable, some people
have been suggesting,“ We l l , maybe they
were just genetically swamped by hordes
of invading modern humans.” I don’t
think that can possibly have been the
case. Neanderthals and modern Homo
s a p i e n s are just too different to have
interbred successfully. But if it makes
people feel better about poor old
Neanderthal being genetically swamped
than physically annihilated, then so be it.
One thing truly sets us apart from every
other species: c o n s c i o u s n e s s. H u m a n
consciousness has been described as a
kind of inner eye, which allows the brain to
observe itself at work and there f o re
permits us to have the complex
i n t e r p e rsonal relationships that far exceed
those of any other animal. Modern human
anatomy goes back over 100,000 years
but it wasn’t until maybe 40,000 years
ago that modern cognition suddenly burs t
on the scene, as evidenced by the cave
art of the Cro - M a g n o n , for example, i n
E u ro p e. What triggered this cognitive
explosion? 
It is impossible to be sure what
this innovation might have been,but the
best current bet is that it was the
invention of language. For language is
not simply the medium by which we
express our ideas and experiences to
each other. Rather it is fundamental to
the thought process itself. It involves
categorizing and naming objects and
sensations in the outer and inner worlds
and making associations between
resulting mental symbols. It is impossible
for us to conceive of thought (as we
know it) in the absence of language,a n d
it is the ability to form mental symbols
that is the fount of our creativity, f o r
only once we create such symbols can we
recombine them and ask questions like
“What if…?”
Why haven’t other species developed
spoken language?
Many species have very complex
v o c a l ,gestural and scent-based systems of
communication but even in the great
a p e s, vocalizations seem limited to
expressing emotional states. We have
managed to separate vocal sounds from
e m o t i o n , and instead to attach them to
symbols that we form in our minds.As far
as we know, this is a unique ability that
was only relatively recently acquired. I n
f a c t , if we were to set the evolutionary
clock back only a few hundred thousand
years and run the whole process all over

of us are in states of disgrace and always
shall be.
S e c o n d , ethics are all products of
the human mind. We cannot derive any
concepts of morality or of natural law
from contemplating nature. The reason
why is that nature is indifferent to
individual suffering or success and to call
such indifference amoral would be to
a n t h r o m o r p h i z e.
Human evolution has come to a standstill,
you say. We haven’t really changed since
acquiring cognition and we cannot expect
any major innovations in the future.Wh a t
is holding us back? 
Yo u ’ve got to have small
populations in order to get meaningful
genetic innovations. The population is
getting larger all the time, individuals are
i n finitely more mobile now and the
prospect of isolation of populations is
lower than it ever has been. We can
imagine some sci-fi scenarios of isolated
space colonies but they would inevitably
be sustained by a lifeline from Earth. O r
we can imagine genetic engineering.
H o w e v e r, a r t i ficially produced genotypes
could only be sustained by sequestering
“ e n g i n e e r e d ” individuals which I doubt
and hope would never be deemed
p e r m i s s i b l e. But if it was, these genetic
innovations would remain only among
these small “ l a b o r a t o r y ”p o p u l a t i o n s.
So to hope that a bit more
evolutionary fine-tuning will solve our
problems is foolish optimism.We have to
cope with ourselves as we currently cope
with the world and the problems that we
cause in it.We have reached a pinnacle in
the sense that Homo sapiens is truly
something unique.Whether you think it
is superior or not is up to you. I suspect
that if other species were capable of
contemplating this question, they would
not conclude that we represent a
p i n n a c l e.
In the world’s richest, most industrialized

over the teaching of human evolution in

wants to impose Biblical scriptures in the

your work? The Internet has a long list of
sites in which creationists not only attack
your work but also pray for your soul.
I t ’s absolutely appalling.This is the
only country where this is happening.I t ’s
due to a certain group of fundamentalist
Protestants who seem to feel that human
beings need the word of God in order to
behave properly. Th e y ’re threatened,
insecure and looking for a scapegoat.
I get an occasional letter from
creationists who are very concerned
about my soul and insist that I follow the
“true path.” But I’ve never received any
threats or felt any restrictions in my work.
For a man who studies dead people, you
seem to go out on a limb politically. You
cannot avoid the ire of the creationists but
you have gone a step further by writing
that attempts to limit women’s
re p roductive rights are “the ultimate
example of human hubris” at a time when
global human population growth is
causing ecological havoc.Why go so far?
I just draw conclusions on the basis
of what I see around me in the world as
a human being, not as a
p a l e o a n t h r o p o l o g i s t . I’m concerned
about this emphasis on the quantity of life
because it’s ultimately going to have a
deleterious effect on its quality. Th e r e
are three times as many people in the
world as there were when I was born.
But it cannot go on indefin i t e l y … ■
INTERVIEW BY AMY OTCHET
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST.

I ’ve never had a more profound or
powerful experience. It is such
extraordinary art in such an
extraordinary environment—the age is
only a secondary part of that experience.
This symbolic activity appeared so
s u d d e n l y : art and carving, e n g r a v i n g,
notation music, people decorating their
bodies and burying each other in
elaborate styles and so on.
You’ve maintained that this kind of
symbolic activity was for the most part
reserved to Euro p e. Perhaps it was
occurring elsewhere in Africa or Asia but
just slipped through the cracks of a spars e
fossil re c o rd? You could be accused of
Eurocentrism.
We have some early hints in A f r i c a
of humans transporting exotic materials
over long distances, some traces of fli n t
mining and 50,000-year-old ostrich
eggshell beads and so on. People may
have even been navigating to Au s t r a l i a
60,000 years ago.These are all things that
probably required the same kind of
cognitive apparatus that produced
L a s c a u x . But the record is tantalizingly
p o o r.
This isn’t to suggest that any of this
cognition and creativity originated in
E u r o p e.Apparently the first Cro-Magnon
brought these capacities with them but
from where we don’t know. It may well
have begun in A f r i c a . But right now, t h e
best record that we have is in Europe.
And that’s why it attracts so much
a t t e n t i o n . H o p e f u l l y, w e ’ll be learning
more from other parts of the world as
we make more discoveries.
You’ve suggested that the art at Lascaux
reflected a body of mythology, a view of
the world and humanity’s place in it. Do
you think this thirst or quest to unders t a n d
our origins is a distinctly human trait? 
Oh yes.This intense curiosity about
our origins, this intense need to know
“ w h y ” is a profound part of us.I think the
bottom line is that the ability and desire
to ask these questions are deeply
embedded in the human psyche.We are
trying to satisfy this curiosity when we
study human evolution. Indeed we may
not be learning nearly as much about
ourselves as we think we are.
For many people, the ultimate question is
whether primitive man was more noble or
“better off” than civilized man. In your
o p i n i o n , did a state of gra c e, so to speak,
exist before or after the advent of
civilization as we know it? 
(Burst of laughter) Fi r s t , a state of
grace is a concept which humans devise
while knowing that it doesn’t exist.M o s t
