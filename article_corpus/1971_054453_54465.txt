On the following pages we
present a remarkable series
ofphoto-studies of the bas-
reliefs of the temple of
Bayon made by a French
photographer, Luc Ionesco.
Ionesco spent five years
examining and photograph¬
ing the monuments at
Angkor, often waiting many
hours in order to obtain the
right shot. The result is an
extraordinary testimonial
revealing details with a
depth and precision rarely
attained before. A young
Khmer ethnologist, Soubert
Son, has written the com¬
mentaries on these photos
specialty for the "Unesco
Courier". Mr. Son was
born in Phnom Penh and
is a former Unesco scho¬
larship-holder for the study
of the conservation and
restoration of monuments.

he walls of the Bayon temple
of Angkor bear striking testimony to the exceptional care and
interest that King Jayavarman VII took in the joys and suffer¬
ings of his people. Towards the end of the 12th century,
Jayavarman ordered his sculptors to carve on the outer walls
of the Bayon the minutest details of the daily life of his
subjects, providing a veritable saga of the humble men and
women who had contributed to his empire's greatness.
A profusion of carvings of people, plants and animals unfolds
before our eyes like a gigantic strip cartoon, completely
covering the 1,300 square metres (approx 14,000 sq. ft.) of the
Bayon gallery walls (above, the outer gallery to the south of
the temple). The carvings present scenes from the everyday
life of the common people, their work, their food, their
amusements, etc. The daily life of the Khmers was linked to
the rhythm of the two main seasons of the year: the dry
season, the time of festivals and leisure activities, and the
rainy season, the time of work in the paddy-fields. Here the
close link between the temple and the rice crop is clearly
evident (see article page 6).
From sunrise to dusk, craftsman, merchant and housewife
went about their business. From 6 a.m. to noon the markets
were particularly animated with their stalls laden with
vegetables, rice, herbs and spices, fish and meat, silks from
China, pewter-ware from Chen-chou, porcelain from Ch'uan-
chou, fishing tackle, medicines, combs and trinkets and hard¬
ware of every kind. (Photo left, detail of a teapot measuring
only a few centimetres on the Bayon wall.)

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (Continued)
The Khmer sculptor had a keen eye for the human foibles and
idiosyncrasies of his fellow men whom he carved with
spontaneous realism and an occasional touch of humour. We
can pick out merchants and craftsmen, masons shaping their
stone (above right), pedlars selling grilled fish on skewers
(above left), cooks busy at their ovens preparing cakes,
cooking rice or serving drinks (below). Elsewhere the artist
regales us with scenes from the life of the nobility, from
military life, of craftsmen sitting down to a communal meal.
He shows us landscapes, farmyard scenes, cattle (right, a bull
tethered to a tree), as well as amusing incidents such as the
youngster pilfering goods from a stall while its owner is
taking a short siesta.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 32)
On the following four pages we present a photo-panorama
of one of the complete outer walls of the Bayon temple.
The bas-reliefs on the inner walls are devoted to religious and
court scenes. The outer walls portray scenes from daily life
and historical events in Angkor's past. Here the sculptors
gave free rein to their narrative talents.
Many of the scenes they depicted were doubtless inspired
by the festivities connected with the celebration of the New
Year and the Rice and Dance Festivals. Below, an acrobat,
lying on his back, manipulates a wheel with his feet, while
another actually seems to be performing a juggling act,
balancing children on his head and hands. A tightrope-walker
sways above the crowds, who watch with open-mouthed
admiration. Hunting scenes are frequent, with the hunters
attacking game of all kinds with bow and arrow, crossbow
and blowpipe. (Photo right, detail of bird perched on a branch).

FIND THE CROCODILE !
Amidst the wealth ofplants and animal and human figures in
the Bayon bas-relief (above), can you spot the crocodile and
fish, captured and magnified by the camera's lens (right) ?
If not, turn the page and you will see this same detail in its
broader fishing scene setting. The three photographs togeth¬
er illustrate the extraordinary carving ability of the Khmer
artists and their skill in portraying fine detail as well as the
revelatorypowers ofmodern photographic art. The panorama
shown on these two pages and the two previous pages
represents 26 metres, that is 85 ft. or one tenth of the length
of the wall with its bas-reliefs five metres (16y2 ft.) high
which surrounds the Bayon temple.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 34)
The temples of Angkor Wat were veritable cities within a city
and their towers looked out over a huge urban area with its
artificial lakes, its palaces, its residential quarter for ambass¬
adors and high dignitaries its jewellers' and weavers' stalls,
its painters' and sculptors' studios, its masons' and carpen¬
ters' workshops. Beyond lay the rural suburbs where lived
the peasants, market-gardeners and fishermen. Thanks
to the genius of the Khmer sculptors, many details of their
working methods have come down to us across the gulf of
eight centuries. For example, a whole sequence of the
Bayon bas-reliefs is devoted to fishing which, though practi¬
ced all the year round, really came into its own during the dry
season, when the amateur angler, freed from his work in
the paddy-fields, could devote himself to the sport.

12TH CENTURY DIARY IN STONE (continued from page 36)
In this scene (top of photo) a fishing-boat makes headway
through waters abounding with turtles, crocodiles and fish
of all kinds. In the stern is the oarsman, while, in the bows,
the fisherman has just cast his net. Between them, a third
member of the crew displays his catch. Fishing with nets
probably took place on rivers and on the great artificial lakes
which the Khmers built. The fishermen's flimsy craft are
dwarfed by the big pleasure boats, like the one in the centre
of the scene, on which the passengers amuse themselves
with all manner of games and dances. The bottom of the
frieze depicts a series of common scenes, including (right)
a group laying bets on the outcome of a cockfight. These are
just a few pages from this history book in stone, vibrant
with life, bequeathed to us by Khmer sculptors and artists.
