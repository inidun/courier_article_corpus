Zero immigr ation—the call of Pa u l i n e
H a n s o n ’s One Nation party—is threat e n i n g
the dreams of thousands of potential settlers
to Australia, a country that once opened its arms
wide to people seeking a new way of life.
The threat took shape with Hanson’s message
t h at “ We are in danger of being swamped by A s i a n s ” ,
d e l i vered in her maiden speech to A u s t r a l i a ’s Fe d e r a l
Parliament two ye a rs ago. Since then it has escalat e d
to the point where the party she leads won a quart e r
of the votes in a recent state election and threat e n s
the strongholds of the existing part i e s.
Australia has been proud of its populat i o n
d i ve rsity over the last 25 ye a rs since it changed its
r e s t ri c t i ve immigr ation policy (the White A u s t r a l i a
p o l i cy) to one that is non-discri m i n at o ry. T h e
c o u n t ry now draws on people from 150 countri e s
as settlers.
Subject to a yearly quota, the policy allow s
a nyone from any country to apply to migr at e
regardless of their ethnic ori gi n , s e x , colour or
r e l i gi o n .Whether or not an applicant is accepted as
a settler depends on a points score that takes into
account English language ability, skills and fa m i l y
links and support .
Today about one in four Australians was born
overseas.About five per cent of them were born in
Asian countri e s , 6.2 per cent in the United
K i n g d o m , 6.8 per cent elsewhere in Europe and
1.2 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa.
Since the Second World War a total of 5.6
million people have migrated to Australia. Under
p r e vailing policies migr ation is projected to help
increase A u s t r a l i a ’s population from the present
18.5 million to 23 million in 50 years time.
The gove rnment has responded to the One
N ation Pa rty with a major national campaign to sell
its immigr ation policy.The Minister for Immigr at i o n
and Ethnic A f fa i rs , Philip Ruddock, has travelled the
n ation making it clear there is “no place for racism in
A u s t r a l i a ” .The question, he say s , is “not how do we
stop migr at i o n ,but how do we manage it to gain the
best outcomes for A u s t r a l i a .”
Opposition to Pauline Hanson’s policies has
been loud and vocal, and community support for
m i gr ation dive rsity has come strongly from dive rs e
and influential sources. A joint statement by the
e m p l oye r , l a b o u r , r e l i gious and social we l fa r e
groups spelt it out: “ We Australians should be
proud of the way in which migrants have
t r a n s f o rm e d ,s t r e n g t h e n e d , and enriched our nat i o n
economically, socially and culturally.”
The One Nation party draws on the gr ow i n g
resentment of some Australians who see newcomers
taking “ t h e i r ” jobs in a contracting workforce in an
e c o n o my increasingly affected by the Asian dow n t u rn ,
taking “ t h e i r ” places at the ove r c r owded unive rs i t i e s
and defrauding the gove rnment benefits system.
Environmental groups and the political parties
t h at represent them are also calling for reduced
immigration.They want Australia to determine its
“ c a rrying capacity”—just how many people the
c o u n t ry can continue to sustain without furt h e r
polluting its land, b e a c h e s , ri ve rs and wat e r way s
and endangering its rare plants, birds and animals.
In response to some of these criticisms the
g ove rnment has begun to tighten up the conditions
under which migr ation applicants will be successful by
a l l o c ating 50 per cent of places to skilled people, a n d
by clamping down on those who ove rs t ay their visas,
work illegally and exploit the appeal procedures to
prolong their illegal residence or abuse the we l fa r e
s y s t e m .
The chairman of the Fe d e r ation of Ethnic
A f fa i rs Council of A u s t r a l i a , Randolph A lw i s , i s
c ritical of the gove rn m e n t ’s “ p a n d e ring to extreme
e l e m e n t s ” in A u s t r a l i a . By accenting skills and
English language ability, Australia is in effect
applying indirect discri m i n at i o n , he say s ,t h e r e b y
excluding highly desirable migr a n t s. Some of
A u s t r a l i a ’s business leaders of today arri ved in
Australia without a word of English, he points out.
“There are a lot of cases of highly skilled people,
who because of systemic prejudices, are unable to
get jobs straight away.They are going through a lot
of hardships because, under government policies,
they get no social benefits for two years,” he says.
“Other countries are paying a lot of attention to
our immigr ation policy,”he wa rn s.“ People who have
a choice, who have the skill and knowledge will

Australia’s policy of migration diversity has become
