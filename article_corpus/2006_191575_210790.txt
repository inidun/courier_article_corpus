                       but more often than not, the most severe menace after a conflict 
                                             remains plundering.
Iraq
must cultural heritage  
be a casualty of war?
t times the destruction is delibe- 
rate. Think of the Buddhist statues 
in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, destroyed 
by the Taliban in 2001. Most often, 
though, it occurs as a target of oppor-
tunity, where criminal gangs, already 
involved in the lucrative international 
black market for antiquities, move in 
en masse in the absence of security. 
This was, and still is, the situation in 
southern Iraq where dozens of pre-
Islamic archaeological sites are be-
ing pillaged by looters searching 
for objects that can be sold, mostly 
tablets and statues from the UR III to 
mid-Babylonian periods. The looting, 
which began in the power vacuum 
that followed the 1991, accelerated 
rapidly just prior to, and immediately 
following, the 2003 conflict. 
But in these regions of ongoing in-
stability, amidst the general chaos 
Little funding 
for culture 
The entire budget 
for rebuilding 
the Iraqi National Museum 
and protecting the more than 
1700 archaeological sites 
was just $3MM; 
$1MM donated from 
the Packard Humanities Fund, 
$1MM from 
the US State Department 
and $1MM 
from Japan channeled 
through UNESCO.
and human suffering, is there any real 
hope for protecting cultural heritage?
The will to implement 
a solution
During three trips to Iraq between 
May 2003 and August 2004, I tried 
to find an answer to this question. 
To my surprise, I found that the 
problem of looting in Iraq could be 
addressed and the situation im-
proved relatively simply. 
The real test was not finding the 
solution, but finding the will to im-
plement it. 
To stop the looting in southern Iraq, 
partners had to be identified on the 
ground, and then properly supported. 
In May 2003, the necessary infra-
structure was already in place, both 
in Baghdad, in the form of the State 
Board of Antiquities and Heritage,

and in the provinces, where the sys-
tem of antiquities inspectors and ar-
chaeological site guards remained 
largely intact after the fall of Saddam. 
This fragile but functioning infra-
structure needed modest logistical 
support and funding. Abdul-Amir 
Hamdani, a courageous and dedicat-
ed Iraqi archaeologist and the local In-
spector for Antiquities in the Dhi Qar 
province, one of the most heavily loot-
ed in the south. 
Mr. Hamdani tried to patrol the hun-
dreds of sites in the province with a 
mere 150 trained guards and local 
police, who were not equipped for 
the task. They didn’t stand a chance 
against the well armed looters. 
In an increasingly dangerous post-
conflict Iraq, the archaeological 
guards needed guaranteed salaries, 
new equipment, communications 
equipment and most importantly 
greater numbers. An archaeologi-
cal site guard in Iraq is paid $100/
month, so for $2MM/year the State 
Board of Antiquities and Heritage 
could have hired 1000 equipped site 
guards, which could perhaps have 
sufficed to stop the looting through-
out southern Iraq. 
Non-profit organizations and NGOs, 
some with significant financial re-
sources earmarked for cultural pres-
ervation in Iraq, sat on the sidelines 
as the looting worsened. Some were 
stalled by the divisive and complex 
politics of the occupation itself, oth-
ers by a reluctance to fund projects 
that involved the possibility of armed 
engagement with looters. The latter 
touches on a fundamental dilemma; 
who should be responsible for po-
licing cultural heritage? While these 
questions were being debated, the 
looting continued.
What might have 
been…
One need look no further than the 
protection of Iraq’s oil to under-
stand what could have been done. 
A $30MM contract was provided 
to a security firm for a protection 
force to guard pipelines in the Dhi 
Qar province. Within one year, 
800 guards were hired and trained 
to guard the pipelines, which are 
located in close proximity to the 
archaeological sites. Outfitted with 
guns, trucks, radio equipment and 
air support from Coalition forces, 
the oil protection force boasted 
that they had not had one terror-
ist attack against the pipelines in 
their sector. Is it naïve to think that 
something similar could have been 
done for Iraq’s cultural treasures? 
Securing cultural history ulti-
mately requires three levels of 
planning; adequate protection of 
the heritage sites prior, during and 
post-conflict, addressing the basic 
economic interests in looting at a 
local level, and tackling the illegal 
trafficking in looted objects on the 
demand side. 
Cultural heritage is a finite re-
source that can disappear rapidly 
in conflict and post-conflict situ-
ations. Its protection following a 
conflict should be given the high-
est priority. 
As Winston Churchill famously 
said, “a nation that forgets its past 
has no future.” When nations col-
lapse, it is the moral responsibility 
of the international community to 
step in and protect the past for the 
sake of all our futures.
