The story beggars belief. In the 1970s,
international agencies headed by the
United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) began pumping millions of
dollars of aid money into Bangladesh for
tubewells to provide “ c l e a n ” d r i n k i n g
w a t e r. According to the World Health
Organization,the direct result has been
the biggest outbreak of mass poisoning in
h i s t o r y.Up to half the country’s tubewells,
now estimated to number 10 million, a r e
p o i s o n e d . Te n s, perhaps hundreds of
thousands will die.
Why? Because nobody tested for the
likely take 30 years to find all the
poisoned tubewells—longer than it took
to sink them all. So why are the
authorities and international experts
proving incapable of coming up with a
solution? 
The roots of the problem go back to
the early 1970s when most Bangladeshis
living in the countryside relied on surface
ponds and rivers for their drinking water.
Sewage bacteria, h o w e v e r, unleashed a
battery of water-borne disease which killed
a quarter of a million children each year,
according to the World Bank.So UNICEF
sought to solve the problem by instigating
a massive tubewell project to tap into
underground water sources, d e s p i t e
warnings by some local people that they
were pumping the “ d e v i l ’s water.”
UNICEF explains today that “at the

Thirty years ago, Bangladeshi villages began pumping arsenic-laced water 
natural poison, arsenic, widely found in
underground water. And when a doctor
did find traces of the metal, and when
Bangladeshi villagers did start turning
up at doctors’ surgeries with the tumours
and telltale signs of arsenic poisoning,
the results were swiftly buried so that
nobody made the connection.
Even now as the scale of the calamity
e m e r g e s, nobody is admitting culpability.
Not UNICEF, which initiated the
tubewells programme and paid for the
first 900,000 wells, nor the World Bank, a
fellow sponsor. Not the Bangladeshi
g o v e r n m e n t ,or the foreign engineers and
public health scientists who did not think
to test the water for so long.
The same agencies that played
godmother to the catastrophe are now

t i m e, standard procedures for testing the
safety of groundwater did not include
tests for arsenic [which] had never before
been found in the kind of geological
formations that exist in Bangladesh.” B u t
many geochemists,such as John McArthur
at University College London, scoff at
such a suggestion. They blame dogma
among public health people with no
knowledge of geology, and who equated
underground water with safe water.
Who knew what and when? Th e
Bangladeshi government claims that cases
of arsenic contamination came to its
attention in 1993 and concluded two years
later that the poisoning was widespread,
with tubewell water the likely cause. B u t
according to Quazi Quamruzzaman of the
Dhaka Community Hospital, t h e
government was told as early as 1985 that
Bangladeshis crossing the border into We s t
Bengal were being diagnosed with arsenic
p o i s o n i n g. Arsenic is a slow killer. Th e
most obvious signs are the blisters found
on the palms of the hands and soles of the
f e e t ,which can eventually turn gangrenous
and cancerous.M e a n w h i l e,the poison also
attacks internal organs, notably the lungs
and kidneys,which can result in a battery
of illnesses including cancers.Despite the
mounting evidence of contamination,
there were no investigations.
The World Bank also maintains that
“before 1993, groundwater was never
tested for arsenic,” according to Babar
K a b i r, hydrogeologist and head of the
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s water department. B u t
Peter Ravenscroft,an engineer based in
Dhaka for the British engineering
consultancy firm Mott MacDonald,who
worked extensively for international aid
agencies on the tubewell programme,
says he first found arsenic in
groundwaters in the late 1980s and
published his findings in 1990.
Yet it wasn’t until 1998 that the
international community finally appeared
to accept some responsibility for solving
the mass poisoning of Bangladesh. The
World Bank announced an emergency
three-year programme to identify the
killer tubewells using simple tests and to
“put in motion concrete actions [to]
combat a major health crisis with
devastating effects on the lives of
millions.” With almost every one of the
c o u n t r y ’s 68,000 villages potentially at
r i s k , the Bank said it would initially survey
4,000 villages and draw up action plans for
each. This “fast-track project” was to be
the first phase in a 15-year programme to
screen the country’s tubewells.
But the “ f a s t - t r a c k ” programme took
another year to negotiate between the
international agencies and the
Bangladeshi government, pushing its
completion date to late 2002. A n d
inquiries by the UNESCO Courier have
revealed that the programme remains
mired.Richard Wilson,a leading analyst
of the crisis from Harvard University’s
department of public health, says “ t h e
project is stalled.” He blames the
Bangladeshi government’s failure to
“decide how to spend the money” a n d
says that leading officers at the Bank are
privately “most upset about it.”
The Bank denies this publicly.K h a w a j a
M i n n a t u l l a h , a water specialist at the Wo r l d
B a n k ’s Dhaka offic e,s a y s :“It is not stalled.
There is now steady progress after an
initial slow pace.” But so far, he says, o n l y
800 villages have been screened,little more
than one percent of the country’s villages.
And few if any action plans have been
completed because, says Minnatullah,
scientists have failed to find a “ p r o v e n ,
a f f o r d a b l e ” method of removing arsenic
from village pumps.
While little changes in the lives of
most villagers, local scientist and activist
Dipankar Chakraborti (see box) is
shocked to find a flood of foreign
consultants gearing up for a junket on an
even bigger scale than the original
tubewell programme. “I cannot accept
that 50 percent of the fund will go to
foreign consultants. Bangladesh has
become an experimental station of
Western countries.”
Not that indigenous action has had a
flying start.The Bangladeshi government
created a steering committee which in
turn set up an expert committee in
September 2000 “to detect the causes of
arsenic contamination across the
country”—a matter that most experts
believed to have been long since resolved.
While the official programme has
s t u t t e r e d , many non-governmental
organizations—and none more so than
Chakraborti and his colleagues at the
Dhaka Community Hospital—have been
filling the gap. But the task is far too big
for any NGO. Shahida A z f a r, U N I C E F ’s
representative in Dhaka, told a
conference in the city last May that “to
date, only 250,000 tubewells have been
t e s t e d . If we keep this up it will take us 30
years to complete the testing.”
And now it appears that even this
baleful calculation may be optimistic.
According to Minnatullah, screening of
the first 800 villages revealed 70 percent
more pumps than estimated beforehand.
“Current observations indicate that there
are about 10 million handpumps,” he told
the UNESCO Courier—more than twice

countries.”

as many as assumed when the programme
was set up.
Indeed the WHO released a report in
September estimating that between 35
and 77 million Bangladeshis may be
drinking water containing more than the
safety limit of 10 parts per billion of
a r s e n i c.According to the report’s author,
Allan Smith of the University of
C a l i f o r n i a , B e r k e l e y, the scale of the
disaster is “beyond Bhopal; b e y o n d
Chernobyl.”
There is no way yet of predicting which
of the country’s tubewells is safe and which
carries a promise of disease and death.A
study by David Kinniburgh of the British
Geological Survey,published in June 2000,
found that neighbouring villages,and often
even neighbouring households, d r i n k
water with vastly different levels of
p o i s o n i n g. There is no alternative, h e
c o n c l u d e d , but to test almost every
tubewell in the country (see box).
It seems likely that water from about
half of all the country’s tubewells, in more
than 40,000 villages, exceeds the W H O
l i m i t , many by several hundred times,
according to the health organization.Th e
figure may be rising.Chakraborti recently
reported disturbing new evidence from
Faridpur district where some wells tested in
1995 as safe are becoming contaminated.
The amount of arsenic in the water is
a few parts per million at most. But over
the years it accumulates. It can take a
decade or more of drinking poisoned
water before the physical symptoms
e m e r g e. O f ficial figures show some 8,500
people have been diagnosed with arsenic
p o i s o n i n g.But nobody doubts that there is
massive under-reporting in Bangladesh’s
largely rural and desperately poor
population of 128 million,for whom there
is no national health service.
“ Twenty thousand people could die

each year,” according to the UN
Development Programme. The possible
death toll is difficult to calculate because
some cancers typically take 20 years to
e m e r g e.Smith estimates that in many parts
of southern Bangladesh, one in ten adult
deaths could soon be from arsenic-
triggered cancers of internal organs, s u c h
as the bladder and lungs.People are made
more vulnerable by poor nutrition, t h e
large volumes of water they drink
(typically five litres a day, s a y s
C h a k r a b o r t i ) ,and because they may ingest
more arsenic through eating rice irrigated
by poisoned water and then boiled in it.
“So far as we know there is no
medicine available for chronic arsenic
toxicity,” says Quamruzzaman of Dhaka
Community Hospital.The only treatment
is safe water, nutritious food and time.
This can clear up the skin blotches on
people in the early stages of poisoning.
But once gangrene and cancer have taken
hold they may be beyond hope.
Where is the situation worst?
Chakraborti says “one of the worst villages
I have ever visited” is Stadium Para in
Meherpur district, right on the border with
I n d i a . Here nine residents have already
died of cancerous ulcers caused by arsenic.
One was only 25 years old. B u t , after fiv e
years of surveying, he nominates the
southeastern village of Seladi as “in all
probability the most arsenic-contaminated
village in the world.” Here 72 out of 73
tubewells are contaminated. No fewer
than 21 contain arsenic at more than 1,000
parts per billion, and the highest at 4,000
p p b,or four hundred times the WHO limit.
In some villages almost everyone is
a f f e c t e d . In other villages,only a minority
are poisoned.But they may suffer worst of

with them,” says Jinat Nahar Jitu of Dhaka
Community Hospital. “ They are barred
from coming out of their homes or even
from using water from clean wells.”Wi v e s

unfounded fear that they may infect others.

symptoms as the arsenic levels accumulate
in their bodies.
There are some technical solutions to
providing safe drinking water for the
people of Bangladesh—albeit hard to
execute in such a poor, ill-educated and
rural countryside (see box). But first the
millions of dangerous tubewells have to
be identifie d . The slow progress of the
World Bank programme so far could prove
a mortal blow. In his September report,
Smith warned that “the worst thing that can
possibly be done is nothing.”But for most
Bangladeshis caught up in this disaster,
nothing is exactly what is being done. ■
