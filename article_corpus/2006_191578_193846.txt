        Despite a ban on logging and cutting down trees, 
     increased use of charcoal contributes to desertification in kenya. 
new legislation and environmental activism aim to fight this trend
 which threatens to turn the country into a desert.
Dishevelled, soiled and covered in 
black soot, Dismus Njuguna hawks 
charcoal in the scorching sun on 
the roadside of Nairobi’s South B 
residential district. He says busi-
ness is thriving now that the coun-
try has begun recovering from a se-
vere drought. 
He collects about 500 shillings 
(about seven dollars) a day, a con-
siderable sum in a country where 
more than 60 percent of people 
survive on under one dollar a day, 
before returning home to the near-
by Mukuru slums. 
Njuguna is among around 30 oth-
ers on the same road, and thou-
sands across the country, scram-
bling to meet customer demand.

fuel have contributed to the rise in 
demand for charcoal. 
“We are forced to buy charcoal 
because we cannot afford fuel or 
electricity,” said Maria Kimuta, a pri-
mary school teacher. Nearby a row 
of women frying fish and pancakes 
on the roadside say they need a 
steady flow of charcoal - mostly 
from indigenous hard wood - to 
stay in business. 
“We are used to this charcoal 
since it is efficient when cooking on 
the wayside,” said Mary Nyagothi, 
a fish monger in Nairob’s Gikomba 
Open air market. 
Experts say increased use of char-
coal over the years in Kenya has 
increased deforestation in several 
parts of the country, mostly in the 
Mau Forest, which acts as the main 
water catchment area in the east 
African nation.
Activism 
and legislation
In addition to banning logging, 
government officials have outlawed 
the cutting down of trees, war- 
ning of an increasing desertification 
across the country. 
“The situation is very bad and we 
must all work to change this habit 
of recklessly cutting trees. I request

every Kenyan to plant a tree so that 
we can make afforestation in Kenya 
a success,” Kenyan government 
spokesman Alfred Mutua said. 
Mutua said deforestation has in-
creased the effects of drought, 
which has affected around 15 mil-
lion people in east Africa, of which 
eight million of them are in dire need 
of relief supplies. In Kenya alone, 
some 3.5 million need food aid. 
Environmental activists like 2005 
Nobel Peach Prize winner Wangari 
Maathai are concerned that ram-
pant tree cutting will alter rain pat-
terns and expand deserts. Rapid 
desertification in Africa “is a result 
of deforestation, devegetation, es-
pecially due to poor farming prac-
tices and soil erosion that made 
riverbeds red-brown,” Maathai said 
in Nairobi. 
Alarmed by years of forest mis-
management, Maathai lobbied 
several lawmakers to pass a forest 
law last year that, if effectively 
implemented, will go a long way 
to protect Kenyan forests. After 
a near 10-year delay, the Kenyan 
parliament approved The Forest 
Bill 2005. The bill replaces a law 
adopted during British colonial rule 
of Kenya in 1947 that has failed to 
protect the country’s forests. 
Since independence in 1963, 
Kenya’s forest cover has shrunk 
from 10 percent of its 582,650 
square-kilometre (224,962-square-
mile) territory to a mere 1.7 percent, 
according to environmentalists who 
campaigned for the new law.
Migration contributes 
to desertification
“The continent’s growing popula-
tion is often forced to migrate in or-
der to find water”.
According to regional environmen-
tal experts, more than two-thirds of 
Africa is either arid, semi arid or 
just plain dry lands. The continent’s 
growing population is often forced 
to migrate in order to find water and 
grazing lands for their livestock. 
“This migration, usually with their 
livestock concentrated in one area, 
usually ruins the environment and 
contributes to expansion of deserts 
and to some extent climate change,” 
said an environmentalist who had 
done studies in parts of east Africa. 
The Worldwide Fund for Nature 
has warned that Africa is losing two 
million hectares (five million acres) 
of forest every five years, moving 
the continent closer to becoming 
one huge desert.

In Nairobi as in the rest of Kenya, charcoal is 
the most commonly-used fuel.
