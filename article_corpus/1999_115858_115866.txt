Little in life fits into neat boxes dividing one
set of objectives from another. And science is
far from an exception. I have in mind the pre-
mise that pure research, m o t i vated exclusively by
the search for knowledge for its own sake, has suf-
fered from the rise in technological or applied
r e s e a r c h . As industry increasingly invests in and
c o l l a b o r ates with the academic wo r l d , some people
assume that scientists have strayed from the goal of
“ a d vancing know l e d g e ” to “ c r e ating we a l t h ” .
There is no denying the trend towards indus-
t rial funding of unive rsity research which began in
the 1970s and has since intensifie d . In the United
S t ates for example, i n d u s t ry ’s share of academic
R&D support rose from 2.6 percent in 1970 to
almost seven per cent in 1995, an almost eight-fold
increase in absolute R&D purchasing powe r. B u t
a g gr e g ate data do not suggest that a rise in applied
research means a cut in pure (also referred to as
“ f u n d a m e n t a l ” or “basic”) scientific research.
There are several reasons. F i rs t , i n d u s t rial money
is just too small a fraction of unive rs i t i e s ’ t o t a l
research budgets to have such an effect.
More import a n t l y, in most areas of scientific
e n d e avo u r , the goals are a mix of pure and applied
r e s e a r c h . In the past few decades, pure research
has led  to highly profitable and socially va l u a b l e
products or know l e d g e . At the same time, p r o fit -
m o t i vated inventions and new technologi e s — t h at
is to say, applied science—have provided new tools
for breakthroughs in pure research.
Einstein and the laser
Consider the example of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). This was a “pure” research
discovery made in 1946 on the ways in which cer-
tain nuclei act as tiny magnets. Scientists then
could scarcely have imagined the practical appli-
cations which would lead to today’s multi-billion
dollar industry in magnetic resonance medical
imaging (MRI),which doctors use to scan the tis-
sues and bones of patients in diagnosing cance-
rous tumours or hair-line fractures. But the origi-
nal discovery only provided the opportunity for
the applications. To realize these required a great
deal of additional sophisticated engi n e e ri n g,
applied science and commercial development.
Likewise, the notion of pure research being
separate from applied science fails us in tracing
the  development of fibre-optic communications,
in which glass or plastic fibres transfer light waves
generated from lasers, whose amplitude is then
modulated to carry information for telephone
conversations or TV programmes. In 1905 Albert
Einstein first predicted the idea of stimulated
emission of electromagnetic radiation, a pure
research principle  underpinning lasers. But it
wa s n ’t until 1960 that T. H . M a i m a n , a n
American scientist, built the first laser. Yet, to
actually use lasers for communications applica-
tions required scientists to learn to make fine
glass optical fibres of unheard of purity. To achie-
ve that end, scientists needed to do fundamental
research on the nature of defects and impurities
in materials—but with a very well-defined practi-
cal objective (i.e., communications). In addition,
fibre-optic communications required a good deal
of engineering. Thus, the journey from the pure
scientific research of Einstein to the development
of fibre-optic communications involved a com-
plex interplay of pure research and application-
motivated fundamental research.
These examples demonstrate that the notion
of pure and applied science waning and waxing at
the expense of each other just doesn’t hold water.
There are just a few fields—like particle physics,
cosmology and some areas of pure mathematics
—in which the research agenda can be determi-
ned exclusively by the conceptual structure of the
subject without regard for possible societal or
business applicat i o n s. But generally speaking,
pure science discoveries open up unsuspected
opportunities of application, while at the same
time the search for technological applications
often invites us into new areas of fundamental
research. n
