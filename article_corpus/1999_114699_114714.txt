In A f rica gerontocracy is dying.The traditional
p o l i t i c a l , social and economic order dominat e d
by the elders seems doomed to extinction.
The elders exercised—and still do, though to
a much lesser extent—authority in the context of
a ru r a l , clan-based society where technical, s o c i a l
and religious knowledge was acquired during a
long process. Tr a d i t i o n a l l y, the oldest fa m i l y
member managed the land, the main productive
r e s o u r c e . He divided it up, d i s t ri buted the reve n u e s
and decided how unconsumed products should be
u s e d . Management of agricultural surpluses gave
rise to the main source of his powe r. He receive d
and gave girls in marri a g e , since he alone was able
to provide them with a dow ry.The younger males
were thus dependent on him when they took a wife.
M a rriage was a decisive step towards social
promotion and claiming a birt h ri g h t . An elder
could use his wealth to increase the number of his
w i ves and strengthen his social ties.
The elder’s power also had a political and
r e l i gious basis. He presided over the village’s destiny
by taking part in the council of elders and
a d m i n i s t e ring the ancestor cult. As a member of
secret organizations he helped enforce respect for
the social order and sanctioned anyone who broke



African youth makes a t a ke o v e r
The upheavals that have rocked African societies in the past half-century have
undermined the elders’ traditional power base
the ru l e s. The elder was the master, e ven though
he consulted the younger members of the
community, especially on family matters. He was
t r e ated with deep respect.Young people and wo m e n
adopted a submissive attitude towards him.
When individualism 
erodes clan structures
Most A f rican societies are pat ri l i n e a l , a n d
women and children live with the husband’s fa m i l y.
Women had an inferior social stat u s.They acquired
influence with the onset of menopause, w h i c h
brought their condition closer to that of the men,
but never obtained the right to represent or head
the fa m i l y. E ven after reaching an advanced age,
they were barred from taking part in official
decision-making and enjoyed no economic or
social powe r. At best, they wielded their authori t y
in the pri vate arena, especially over their daughters -
i n - l aw.
In the recent past a series of events and
d e velopments have enabled youth to supplant
their elders. C o l o n i z at i o n , the arri val of
C h ristianity and Islam and the implementat i o n
and subsequent spread of the market economy
and the wa g e - e a rning system have placed more

emphasis on the individual than the clan and
taken a toll on traditional stru c t u r e s. But the
d e c i s i ve fa c t o rs in the emancipation of yo u n g
people have been education and urbanizat i o n .
In the 1940s and 1950s, the small minori t y
admitted to We s t e rn unive rsities played a key role in
t r a n s f o rming A f rican societies and ousting their
elders from positions of power.Western education
discredited the wisdom of the elders. Now, “those
who know”are those who have gone to school and
a r e , t h e r e f o r e , yo u n g . Their studies, which they
p u rsue in tow n , enable them to escape from the
elders’control.
D u ring the colonial peri o d , p ri m a ry schools,
missions and colleges of education helped train a
group of yo u n g, s k i l l e d , “ e d u c at e d ” A f ri c a n s
including teachers , civil servants and health
wo r k e rs. Some turned away from their fellow
A f ricans and A f rican va l u e s , while others gr e w
aware of colonial oppression and became close to
the working class forming in the cities.They were in
the vanguard of political and labour struggles as
well as the battle for independence. Most of the
earliest African heads of state were young. But by
c l i n ging to power until an advanced age, some have
lent credence to the idea that the A f ri c a n
gerontocracy has not had its last word.
The spread of 
Western values
The overall development of A f rican society
n e ve rtheless continues to undermine the
g e r o n t o c r a cy ’s foundat i o n s. U r b a n i z ation has dealt
a blow to an essentially rural-based political
o r g a n i z at i o n . In the 1940s, economic activities
began shifting towards the cities.Young people are
the most mobile group, capable of adapting to city
l i f e , to new technology and to modern forms of
wo r k .They are also more receptive to the spread of
We s t e rn va l u e s ,c o nve yed by the school system, t h e
a d m i n i s t r ation and the media. G r a n t e d , young city-
d we l l e rs are still attached to the villages where they
were born . But by living far from their
c o m m u n i t i e s , they are gradually adopting new
lifestyles and becoming self-sufficient. A more
individualistic society is taking shape in which the
r e l ationships of domination and allegiance betwe e n
young people and the old generations are dying
o u t .A ny young man who can afford to can now get
m a rri e d . E ven in the country s i d e , which is
intensifying its exchanges with the cities, t h e s e
developments are having an effect.
But on two counts change is coming slowe r.
F i rs t , gender inequality persists and wo m e n ,
including in the cities, are still subject to the
goodwill of the men in their fa m i l i e s. S e c o n d ,m o s t
young A f ricans remain dependent on the gr o u p
because of low urbanization and school at t e n d a n c e
rates,unemployment and poverty.The question of
whether they will be able to take over the reins from
their parents is posed today in dramatic terms. ■
