BILL OF HEALTH?

O
ur needs for the earth's min¬
eral resources are constantly
increasing, but it is no secret
that mineral extraction can cause
damage to the environment. How
high are these environmental costs?
"The industrial sector," writes
Mostafa K. Tolba, former executive
director of the United Nations Envi¬
ronment Programme, in Saving Our
Planet (1992), "is an important user
of natural resources and is the major
contributor to the world's pollution
loads. The use of metals has
increased over the past two decades,
although regional consumption pat¬
terns vary. The developing countries
have most of the world's proven
reserves of important minerals such
as bauxite, copper, tin, cobalt and
phosphates, but they consume only
about 12 per cent, exporting most
of their production to developed
countries."
In a study written in 1994 for the
Organization for Economic Co-oper¬
ation and Development (OECD)
Alyson Warhurst confirms this
analysis. "Many developing coun¬
tries depend on the production of
minerals to finance their develop¬
ment efforts," she writes. "In cases
such as Zambia, Zaire, Bolivia,
Peru, Chile and Papua New Guinea,
more than 40 per cent of their for¬
eign exchange earnings have come
from mineral exports in recent
years. In other countries including
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Colombia,
Venezuela and to a lesser extent
Brazil, mineral production accounts
for important portions of GNP."
Many industrialized nations are not
far behind. Canada, for example,
is one of the world's major mineral
exporters.
In both the developing and the
industrial countries, the extraction of
this wealth takes a toll. Every stage of
mining and mineral processing
prospecting, building access roads
to the site, ore extraction, smelting
and refining can have harmful
effects on nature. All rock is com¬
posed of minerals, but they are only
described as ores when their con¬
centration is high enough to make
exploitation commercially worth¬
while. Most ores consist of several
different minerals or metals, and in
order to obtain them in pure form
they have to be separated via a series
of physical and chemical processes
that are potentially polluting.
GOLD, MERCURY AND CYANIDE
Even at the exploration stage,
drilling and earth-moving can
damage the environment, but these
operations are usually limited in
scope. Environmental degradation
really begins when a mine starts to
be exploited. Six to eight years usu¬
ally elapse between the discovery of
a lode and its commercial exploita¬
tion. In the meantime roads and
buildings have to be constructed,
wells must be dug and the topsoil
has to be removed. Large-scale exca¬
vation is required. Open-cast mines
cause the greatest damage, pro¬
ducing about eight times more waste
per ton of ore than underground
mines. Although such waste material
may remain chemically inert, it can
block watercourses, cause clouds of
dust and even, if it contains sulphur,
dangerously pollute runoff water.
Animal and plant life, forests, agri¬
culture and recreation areas may
also be damaged.
The State ofCanadas Environ¬
ment (1991) describes how enor¬
mous amounts of rock must be exca¬
vated to obtain a relatively small
amount of minerals or metals: ore
with 2 per cent copper content yields
20 kg of metal per ton of processed
rock. According to another example
cited in the OECD report, in the
United States, in the case of a lower
copper content, about 0.9 per cent,
an estimated 990 million tons of ore
must be mined to obtain 9 million

tons of copper. The figures are even
more dramatic for gold mining. A
company in the United States, Gold-
strike, had to excavate 325,000 tons
of ore and waste to produce 50 kg of
gold metal. This gives some idea of
the environmental degradation
caused by this kind of activity.
Because of the volumes involved
and the reagents required to obtain
pure ore, there is good reason to
feel anxious about water quality in
mining regions. Mercury and sodium
cyanide are commonly used in gold
mining, for example. The gold amal¬
gamates with mercury and is then
heated to 300-400°C when the mer¬
cury vaporizes, leaving the gold.
The mercury can be recondensed
for future use, but it can also escape
from jerry-built mining installations
belonging to small-scale prospectors
and turn up in the river mud. Gold
miners frequently move from place
to place and pay little attention to
the environmental impact of what
they do. Mercury not only poses a
direct threat to their health, it also
works its way into the food chain so
that fish from the river are dan¬
gerous to eat. "With an estimated
usage rate of 4 kg of mercury per kg
of gold produced," the OECD report
continues, "the total environmental
loading of mercury from such
sources is roughly 400-500 tons per
year." Two recent case-studies on a
river in Mindanao (Philippines) and

Pelada (Brazil).
the Madeira River in the Amazon
region of Brazil have shown that
mercury toxicity in alluvial mud and
fish was six times higher than the
rates accepted by the World Health
Organization. Several cases of acute
mercury poisoning and related
deaths have been reported from
both the Philippines and Brazil.
IT COSTS MORE TO POLLUTE
THAN PROTECT
A humorist once wrote that cities
ought to be built in the countryside.
In much the same vein an economist
recently suggested that the low-
income countries were ready to
accept environmental degradation
in return for industrial expansion.
And surely nobody lives in deserts
and jungles, anyway. It is hard to

share this viewpoint, for the fact is
that jungles and deserts are rarely
uninhabited. As Alyson Warhurst
points out, ". . . mineral projects . . .
due to their remoteness, often
require agricultural and fishery pro¬
jects to be established nearby. Pre¬
cisely by being so remote, communi¬
ties that do suffer environmental
degradation of their resources are
less likely to have it recorded and
less able to respond." And in any
case who would be ready to listen to
their claims? Warhurst cites "the
enforced removal of two aboriginal
communities from their land during
the construction of the North
Queensland (Australia) bauxite strip-
mine at Weipa in the early 1960s,"
and notes that the Bougainville
copper mine in Papua New Guinea
has ravaged vast areas of Nasiosi
and Rorovana farmland and forest.
Contrary to what one might
expect, it costs mining companies
more to pollute than to respect the
environment. First of all because
they can be held responsible for the
harmful effects of their activities on
people. The OECD study cites as a
recent example that of "Colquiri
where the Bolivian State Mining
Company, COMIBOL, was respon¬
sible for both the mine and the wel¬
fare of the mining community.
Through mismanagement it allowed
chemical effluent from the concen¬
tration plant to flow directly into
the natural drainage supplying
water to the community, resulting
in high mortality and illness, par-

ticularly amongst infants, the eco¬
nomic burden of which fell on the
company." Moreover, while the dust
and vapour that escape from
smelters are highly toxic and can
contribute to acid rain (an estimated
6 million tons of sulphur dioxide are
released into the atmosphere each
year by the smelting of copper and
other non-ferrous metals), they also
contain valuable metals such as gold,
or expensive reagents such as mer¬
cury and cyanide. Producing
cleanly, i.e. reducing emissions and
recovering metal losses, is not only
environmentally indispensable but
also makes economic good sense.
For many years mines were
opened, worked, then closed and
abandoned as landfill sites. Mostafa
Tolba notes that "Thousands of
landfill sites and surface impound¬
ments used for dumping hazardous
wastes have been found to be unsat¬
isfactory. Corrosive acids, persis¬
tent organic compounds and toxic
metals have accumulated in these
sites for decades. In the Clark Fork
Mining Complex in western Mon¬
tana the largest site identified in
the United States, and considered
the largest hazardous waste dump in
the world ponds of wastes from
copper and silver mining and
smelting activities have been accu¬
mulating for 125 years." Cleaning up
abandoned sites is expensive. The
United States legislation known as

the "Superfund" is based on the
principle that "the polluter pays"
and obliges mining companies to
spend millions of dollars on site
rehabilitation.
The most responsible and
dynamic mining companies in the
North may well be heeding the new
"ecological imperative", but it will
be less easy to apply in the South.
What the South needs, far more
than repressive and virtually unen¬
forceable laws, is technology trans¬
fers, training programmes and the
enhancement of its engineering and
managerial skills. But perhaps the
first step of all should be for the
North to respect the South, espe¬
cially in this field. I
