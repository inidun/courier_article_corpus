ve r , it was never perceived as a people’s progr a m-
me,and suffered from embezzlement of funds and
poor target achieve m e n t . In 1988 the system wa s
turned on its head.An autonomous National Lite-
r a cy Mission A u t h o rity was established, to which
the central gove rnment directly sanctioned funds,
by-passing the state governments. District literacy
committees were put at the centre of the program-
m e , receiving 100 per cent of the funds.This brought
it success at the grassroots level.”
These committees are autonomous bodies
which report directly to the National Literacy Mis-
s i o n . E d u c ation experts and NGOs are strongly
represented on them alongside local offic i a l s.T h e y
conduct door-to-door surveys to identify non-lite-
rates, organize mobilization activities, select orga-
nizations and volunteers to participate in the cam-
p a i g n , and develop locally-relevant learn i n g
materials while keeping the larger national canvas
and its concerns in view.
“ We realized that in order to succeed,l i t e r a cy had
to become a grassroots social move m e n t , and that is
w hy we put vo l u n t e e rs at the heart of our strat e g y,”
explains Mr D. R . Pa ri h a r , M a h a r a s h t r a ’s deputy
s e c r e t a ry of school educat i o n .The campaign is dri ve n
by over 10 million unpaid vo l u n t e e rs nat i o n w i d e —
t e a c h e rs and students from schools, colleges and uni-
ve rs i t i e s , public sector employe e s ,h o u s e w i ve s ,e x - s e r-
v i c e m e n , retired gove rnment officials and NGO
m e m b e rs.E ve ry state has a specialized resource centre
which conducts a two - d ay training programme for
vo l u n t e e rs  and provides them with literacy 
m at e ri a l s. “The pri m e rs are simple with lots of dra-
w i n g s , w ritten in the local Marathi language, a n d
about ve ry practical things like purchasing ve g e t a b l e s
‘You know, my daughter has gr a d u ated from
u n i ve rsity and now wants to study for a
Master’s degree,” exclaims Sagar More as
t e a rs of pride well up in her eyes at the thought that
her own daughter can dare to dream so big.
M o r e , who is invo l ved in India’s National Lite-
r a cy Mission as a volunteer with CORO (Commit-
tee of Resource Organizat i o n s ) , is a Dalit. As such,
she belongs to the “Scheduled Castes”—the lowe s t
castes in India.“As an ‘ u n t o u c h a b l e ’ , I had to sit one
outstretched arm away from the upper caste girls in
my class,” she recalls.“I was constantly humiliated by
the teacher,and dropped out after one year of school.
But after becoming literate through CORO,
I became a volunteer teacher with them.”
When India’s planners acknowledged that deve-
lopment could never really take off as long as the
c o u n t ry was anchored down by illiteracy, a nat i o n a l
l i t e r a cy mission was initiated in 1988 to impart
functional literacy to adults between 15 and 35
years. It ushered in a radical change of course by
emphasizing initiative at the grassroots level.
D ri ven by some ten million vo l u n t e e rs , the mis-
sion has recorded remarkable progr e s s , especially in
rural areas and amongst wo m e n . I n d i a ’s literacy
rate,which was 18 per cent of the total population
in 1951, rose from 52 per cent in 1991 to 62 per
cent in 1999.If the present trend continues, India
could attain a 75 per cent literacy rate by the year
2005, well ahead of 2011,as originally forecast.
“The national adult education programme wa s
actually started by the gove rnment in 1978, w i t h
NGOs assigned barely 10 per cent of the funds,”
explains Murlindhar Gode, f o rmer chairman of the
Maharashtra State Literacy Commission.“Howe-

or bri n ging up children,” explains P. Wa n k h e d e , a n
adult education officer in Maharashtra stat e .
In the Bombay area, C O RO was founded when
NGOs active in wo m e n ’s rights and youth move-
ments and amongst trade unions realized to what
extent illiteracy was impeding their wo r k .“ We have
n e ver seen literacy as an end, only a means,” s ay s
S u j ata Khandekar, C O RO ’s chief secretary. K h a n-
dekar is actually an engineer with the state electri c i t y
b o a r d . Because of her interest in literacy issues and
the campaign’s national dimension, she was autho-
rized to work for CORO while continuing to receive
p ay from her employe r. “ L i t e r ates must be able to
use literacy to enrich their lives—to learn to demand,
to question, to have a commitment to changing their
s i t u at i o n .Mere fa m i l i a rity with alphabets and coun-
ting numbers up to 100 is of no use.Therefore, we
also have programmes for neo-literates relating to
s av i n g s , legal literacy, social ri g h t s , alcoholism and
atrocities against women.”
Through community functions involving popu-
lar film stars ,p l ays and television seri a l s , vo l u n t e e r
t e a c h e rs are mobilized.“Most of our teaching vo l u n-
t e e rs are between 15 and 30.T h e y ’ ve followed about
s e ven ye a rs of schooling.We prefer to choose them
from the same community as the learn e rs ,” K h a n-
dekar points out. “ We cover an area of 1 million
people in Bombay—of which 70 per cent live in the
s l u m s , including Dharav i , one of the biggest in A s i a .”
One indicator of CORO’s success can be gau-
ged, not from asking students like Sagar More to
count up to 100 or sign her name, but from her
a s s e rt i veness and confident smile. She has been
t r a n s f o rmed from an illiterate woman who was too
timid to speak up even when spoken to into a zea-
lous motivator,a treasurer of the women’s Federa-
tion Credit Society and a librarian in charge of a
mobile library. Although Sagar abandoned her 
f o rmal studies after one ye a r , she and her husband,
also a Dalit,h ave ensured that all their four children
have passed the 10th grade.
“I feel so gr at i fied when our learn e rs tackle local
civic problems and take social responsibility for
o t h e rs. I ’ ve worked for CORO for five ye a rs without
being paid, but now they give me a salary of 1,500
rupees ($36) a month,” s ays More. “ S o m e t i m e s
they can’t pay even that , but A m b e d k a r ’s idea of
e d u c ating others through s h ra m d a n ( d o n at i n g
labour) means much more to me.” More is referri n g
to Dr Babasaheb A m b e d k a r , a Dalit from Mahara-
shtra state who rose to become the architect of
I n d i a ’s constitution. Throughout his career, h e
emphasized education and women’s rights and is
considered a pioneering social reformer.
M o t i vation among the Dalits is especially high.
“I found I was more effective when I made educa-
tion an emotional issue,” s ays Vilas Sarm a l k a r ,a n o-
ther volunteer teacher.“The Dalits really revere Dr
A m b e d k a r. O n c e , when I was dealing with a fa m i l y
that was reluctant to come to the class,I asked if I
could then take down the portrait of him that they
hung in their house. N o, n o, they said, h o rri fie d ,
and made sure they came from the next class on.”
While volunteer teachers show unquestionable
commitment to their wo r k , their enthusiasm could
wane in the long run in the absence of monetary
b e n e fits for them. “Of cours e , e d u c ation through
vo l u n t e e rs makes for financial  sav i n g s. But the tru t h
is that even if you have the money, it cannot buy yo u
community part i c i p at i o n ,” s ays Pa ri h a r.As CORO ’s
Khandekar sums it up, an important means of sus-
taining vo l u n t e e rs ’ momentum is by applauding
their efforts in the larger community. “Right now,
they are only local heroes,” she say s. “But in fa c t ,
they should be eve ry b o d y ’s heroes.” ■
