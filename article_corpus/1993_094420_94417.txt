ranee of what is going on in Bosnia
today or of what is at stake there.
No longer can anyone maintain that there
is nothing to choose between the lawful
representatives of the sovereign state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the massed forces
of "ethnic cleansing" that are near to having
destroyed it.
The international media have seen to
that: the press and, more especially, radio
and television show us day in and day out
how the tide of horror is inexorably rising,
detailing the plight of the refugees, the con¬
centration camps, the murders of children
and the mass rapes; writers and artists of all
political persuasions are becoming per¬
sonally involved; and the resolutions of
the United Nations Security Council are
becoming increasingly urgent.
Everyone has now begun to realize that
what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina
is much more than a local conflict between
rival communities; it is the clash of two
outlooks that exist in all societies the world
over: one that is humanist and open, and
that opts for pluralist democracy, and, on
the other hand, one that yields to the temp¬
tation to create a supposedly "pure" ethnic
entity by force. Everyone knows politi¬
cians in particular that there is nothing
more contagious, in the long run, than that
temptation, and that there is no greater
threat to world peace, as the Holocaust of
fifty years ago reminds us.
How is it, then, that the irreparable has
been allowed to happen? How has it come
about that victory seems to have been con¬
ceded defacto to the ethnic cleansing cam¬
paign?



Why, despite the total involvement of
the mass media, whose awesome power
has recently been brought to bear to alter
decisively the course of world events, has
nothing been done to prevent a disaster
that everyone foresaw and everyone has
denounced?
Why?
