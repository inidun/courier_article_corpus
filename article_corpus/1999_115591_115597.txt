Sonia is starting to understand why a
foreigner might want to seek asylum. She is
not a refugee herself, but an 18-year-old
French student who has come to the Parc
de la Villette in Paris to visit an exhibition
entitled “A different kind of journey—the
p aths of exile”. She is taking part in a simu-
lation exercise for which she has assumed
the identity of Sybel, a 21-year-old Tu r k i s h
girl whose photo appears at the entrance to
the exhibition, along with photos of 11
other refugees of different nat i o n a l i t i e s ,
among them Luis, L e i l a ,Ve s n a ,K a n a , Pave l ,
and Tarik.The stories of how they came to
be exiles are acted out in detail by 27 pro-
fessional actors who play the roles of
officials, customs and police officers in a
room as big as a gymnasium where airport
customs offices and police headquart e rs
have been reconstituted.There are even a
minefield and a clandestine workshop.
In the three months after it opened in
N ovember 1998, the exhibition at La V i l l e t t e
attracted over 10,000 visitors. Its educa-
tional interest lies not so much in the wo r d s
the actors use as in their behaviour as they
make visitors experience the humiliations
and contempt with which refugees are often
t r e at e d . “I felt a profound sense of injustice,”
Sonia explained. “It takes a great deal of
courage to do what Sybel did. I didn’t know
h ow much a person might have to go
through simply to live like everyone else.”
E m p at hy, the imagi n at i ve power to enter
into the feelings of others and to identify
with them, is a mechanism that is widely
used nowa d ays to create an awa r e n e s s
among young people and adults in deve-
loped countries of the situation faced by
refugees who seek asylum there. But this is
just one of many applications of simula-
tion games, which are, for example, used to
fa m i l i a rize children with the pollution
hazards in Mexico City or A u s t r a l i a n
firemen with procedures for controlling
forest fir e s.To d ay, u n i ve rsities and compa-
nies all over the world are using these games
because they have proved to be a low-cost
and effective method of preparing people for
the world of work.
Role-playing in simulation games pro-
vides flashes of insight which improve the
quality of our perception of others and of
gi ven situat i o n s. It changes the way we look
at others. “I now think of the refugee pro-
blem in terms of individuals and not of
figures,” said Mark Madoga on leaving La
Villette. “When I see a refugee on the TV
news,I see above all a human being.”
When bombs rain down
A similar result is obtained by “ Pa s s a g e s ” ,
a simulation game created in 1995 by the
O f fice of theUnited Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR),working with
t wo psychologists and a game specialist. L i k e
the La Villette exhibition, it seeks to make a
broad audience aware of the situation confron-
ting refugees, but it consists simply of a 30-
page handbook and is much less costly and
simpler to put into effect because only four lea-
d e rs are needed for 50 part i c i p a n t s. In four
ye a rs , over 5,000 persons in Switzerland,
S we d e n , the Netherlands, Tu n i s i a , A u s t ri a
and Chile have taken part in the game—
mostly scouts in the 12-to-18 age gr o u p, a s
well as students, t e a c h e rs and NGO members.
One of the most intense experiences of
“ Pa s s a g e s ” is when participants listen blind-
fold to a simulated bombing at t a c k .There is
complete pandemonium, and in the general
p a n i c, families split up. Parents and chil-
dren start to call out for one another. C l a i r e ,

in Geneva , admits that even after seve r a l
ye a rs ’ work with asylum seekers , she still did
not understand why refugees were so insis-
tent on keeping their families together—so
much so that this was liable to become their
only concern . “And then I too experi e n c e d
the terrible sense of families being separat e d
d u ring the bombardment,” she said.“ For me
the only thing that counted from then on in
the game was family unity.”
Role playing in action
Many companies now use simulation
games to train their staff—from manual
workers and technicians to executives—in
such areas as marketing, production mana-
gement and human resources. In France, a
c o n s u l t a n cy, P r o c o n s e i l , decided to tap the
rapid expansion of this market by creating
a subsidiary dedicated solely to the deve-
lopment of adult training games: C I P E
( I n t e rn ational Centre for Educational Pe d a-
gogics). In the last ten years,the company
has designed 25 games in 10 languages and
trained more than 10,000 pers o n s. Its thou-
sand or so customers in 18 countries include
the French companies A é r o s p atiale and
Y ves Saint Laurent, as well as the unive rs i-
ties of the Sorbonne in France and Nuova
Magini in Italy, a university technological
institute in Spain and Harris Semiconduc-
tors in the United States.
The use of simulation games began to
spread after the Second World Wa r , notably to
teach business management. The most
popular of the early games, “ Top Manage-
ment Decision Simulat i o n ” , was designed in
1956 by the A m e rican Management A s s o-
c i at i o n . In the 1970s,m a ny courses giving an
introduction to economics were deve l o p e d ,
including the “Island Game” i nvented by
p s y c h o - s o c i o l o gist Claude Zerbib, and Prof.
Je a n - M a rie A l b e rt i n i ’s “The Company in
A c t i o n ” , a role game in which each part i c i p a n t
p l ays in turn an offic i a l , an entrepreneur and
a head of fa m i l y.
In the field of air accident prevention,
s i m u l ation exercises have become highly
sophisticated. John Rolfe,an expert in this
field, not only uses conventional high-tech
flight simulat o rs , but also includes such
s i t u ations as hijacking and the sudden illness
of a pilot. In co-operation with the Royal A i r
Force and British commercial airlines,R o l f e
reconstructed the circumstances in which
accidents occurred and created emergency
s i t u ations which crews must learn to handle
by following established procedures without
being led astray by snap judgments.
The development of information tech-
nology and the Internet has encouraged
the creation of simulation games designed
among other things to develop commer-
cial and electoral strat e gi e s ,d e fine the most
convenient transport timetables and make
p o p u l ation and climatic forecasts based on
different scenarios.
D a n ny Saunders , who publishes T h e
I n t e rn ational Simulation and Gaming Ye a r b o o k
which first appeared in London in 1991,
says the number of simulation games has
doubled in recent ye a rs.The United Stat e s ,

among the most active countri e s. I n
English-speaking business schools, s i m u l a-
tion games are coming to be used as an
assessment technique. “At the end of the
c o u rs e ,” D a n ny Saunders say s , “a gr o u p
of students are asked to propose at least
t wo creat i ve ways of leading a company out
of a crisis situation based on an authentic
case.”
In Spain, the use of training games has
also gr own in recent ye a rs , according to Jo s é
Luis Menes Soler,Training Director at the
Zaragoza Intern ational Business School
(CESTE) whose curriculum has offered
c o u rses including corp o r ate simulat i o n
games for the past six ye a rs. According to
Menes Soler, “it is a reve l ation for students
to see how the consequences of their deci-
sions in a particular area such as marketing
or finance can affect a company ’s ove r a l l
r e s u l t s , because all the areas of the bu s i n e s s
are inter-relat e d .” It might have cost their
companies a gr e at deal of time and money
had recent gr a d u ates been obliged to learn
these consequences in a real work situat i o n .
Training South African
entrepreneurs
Among the steps taken to correct the
inequalities created during the apartheid era
in South A f ri c a , an Equality Act today
requires companies to offer positions of res-
ponsibility to blacks, m a r ginalized for so
long that they often lack adequate expe-
ri e n c e . To remedy this shortcoming many
South A f rican companies use training games
such as “ Team Business”, c r e ated by Busi-
ness Education Design. The parti c i p a n t s
are divided into five groups, each of which
is responsible for creating a company to
m a n u facture and sell cardboard boxe s.T h e
players must find raw material suppliers,
negotiate loans with banks,buy the neces-
s a ry equipment and design their products.
According to Esmo Ndzimande, an exe-
cutive with South Africa’s ESKOM power
c o m p a ny, this game is a valuable introduc-
tion to the general principles of manage-
ment and prepares employees to react to
rapid change. “ W h at ’s more,” he say s ,
“observing the corporate process through
simulation helps us to detect faults in our
production system because it provides us
with a model showing how things should
really function.”
According to a study by South Africa’s
N ational Productivity Institute (NPI),
managers in some 50 companies in South
Africa which have adopted this kind of trai-
ning programme reported “ i m p r oved team-
work and willingness to share tasks, as well as
increased productivity, i m p r oved unders-
tanding and appreciation of the role of mana-
gement, a reduction in conflict in the work
s i t u at i o n , i n n ovat i ve ideas and efforts to
implement cost savings.”
Suitcases that didn’t suit
M i riam Garza, an industrial engi n e e r
who teaches organization and production
management courses at the Unive rsity of
San Luis Potosi in Mexico, uses CIPE’s “ K i t
C a s h ” game to explain how companies func-
tion.
Her students are divided into three
groups.They are asked to set up companies
which are contending for the suitcase market.
Each team starts out with the same amount
of cash, and has to manage its budget,plan
manufacturing, accounts and cash flow. As
the game progr e s s e s , va rious difficulties ari s e ,
such as production delays caused by break-
d owns and sudden changes in customer
tastes.
One of the students, G i l b e rto Cru z ,
r e m e m b e rs that his team’s first excurs i o n
into the market was disastrous.“Our suitcases
were far more expensive than those made by
the competition,” he says.“We realized that
we had not invested enough in machinery.”
Forced to cut their production costs in
order to compete, the young people had to
reappraise the ideas they had studied in the
classroom because they had not learned how
to apply them in practice. “Until we realized
t h at the market was not interested in our
s u i t c a s e s ,” C ruz adds, “ we didn’t unders-
tand the importance of good planning and
sound market research. Seeing the other
teams make a profit while we were crippled
with debts was far more effective than any
amount of classroom theory.”
Training games are increasingly used. B u t
h ow effective are they? Their advo c ates believe
they are a marvellous way of capturing part i-
c i p a n t s ’ at t e n t i o n .They illustrate complex pro-
cesses in a simple manner and are a useful
tool for making the public aware of all kinds of
p r o b l e m s. But objective assessment methods
are essential: in what sense and in which situa-
tions is simulation better than other teaching
methods and why? According to Danny Saun-
d e rs “ t h at is the gr e at challenge of the learn i n g
g a m e ” . n
