While the region increasingly taps the media’s potential to spread the message on
Aids pre v e n t i o n , t raditional taboos continue to hamper the educational pro g ra m m e s

MTV Asia is currently broadcasting an excel-
lent HIV- p r e vention campaign. S avvy and
m o d e rn ,M T V ’s commercial efforts reach
a f fluent youth in major cities.The music love rs who
see MTV’s HIV education spots have the means to
afford condoms and protect themselve s.These yo u n g
people include many of the future leaders of A s i a ’s
next generat i o n .
But the majority of youth in the Mekong regi o n
— young agricultural wo r k e rs in rural areas,newly arri-
ved fa c t o ry wo r k e rs in big cities, d ay labourers on
c o n s t ruction sites and others — d o n ’t have access to
M T V ’s message. Much of the HIV and Aids educa-
tion aimed at youth takes place in schools,but it usually
only begins after the sixth gr a d e . A large number of
young people have already left school by this age. I n
C a m b o d i a , for instance, only 40 per cent of children
continue their education after their sixth ye a r.
Throughout the regi o n , traditions still act as a
sizeable obstacle to effective HIV/Aids prevention pro-
gr a m m e s. Sexual education is not considered a part
of the natural process of gr owing up.Parents still gr e at l y
i n fluence their children’s choice of marriage part n e rs.
In countries like Cambodia and Mya n m a r ,a rr a n g e d
m a rriage is often practiced. P r e - m a rital sex for “ g o o d ”
women is considered scandalous. Couples often do
not dat e , and thus, sexual negotiation doesn’t begi n
until well into the marital relat i o n s h i p, if eve r.
Scare tactics
As in many countri e s ,t e a c h e rs and students in the
r e gion often have trouble discussing sexual issues in
the classroom.Teacher trainers , who help teachers
l e a rn to discuss sex with their students, often find that
these adults have never touched a condom before and
are frequently embarrassed while giving the lessons.
Most grew up in an environment in which sex wa s
n e ver discussed. O f t e n , the task of conducting sessions
on condom education is left up to NGOs. Pa rt l y
because of the traditional difficulty of talking openly
about sexual issues, m a ny of the education pro-
grammes have focused on scare tactics: if you have sex
or inject drugs you will get Aids and die.Youth can
often list what is considered appropri ate and inap-
p r o p ri ate behav i o u r ,but this knowledge doesn’t alway s
change how they act.Traditional taboos have fil t e r e d
into the formal and non-formal health education sys-
t e m s , and affect how gove rnments and societies at
large perceive sexuality and HIV. For instance,
condoms were illegal in Myanmar until 1992. In some
c o u n t ri e s , a woman carrying one would be conside-
red a prostitute by many members of her community,
including the police.
E f f e c t i ve youth education programmes need to
equip young people with the skills and know l e d g e
to effectively negotiate their sexual behav i o u r. S u c h
programmes must start out by listening to the stu-
d e n t s , finding out about the reality of their sexual
l i ve s , and helping them to deal with these situat i o n s.
The reality is that throughout Southeast Asia there
h ave been fairly profound changes in sexual morals
and social behav i o u r: for instance, young couples
are now more likely to hold hands than 20 ye a rs ago.

now often left to the young themselves. Advertise-
ments show a life in which an acknowledgment of
sexuality is the social norm.
S t i l l ,m a ny traditional attitudes towards sexuality
p r e vail and some have a particularly high cost. B e c a u s e
female virginity is highly prized in some countri e s ,i t
is considered acceptable for young men to visit pros-
t i t u t e s.The sex trade has been a major cause of the
spread of Aids in the regi o n . In T h a i l a n d , there are
n ow more men infected with HIV than wo m e n , bu t
the ratio is expected to be even by 2005. Fo rt y - f o u r
per cent of the prostitutes in the nort h e rn region of
Thailand are thought to be HIV- p o s i t i ve . In Cambo-
d i a ,t h at figure is over 60 per cent in some areas.
Dealing with prostitution
In Cambodia, they start at 13, or even yo u n g e r.
M a ny sex customers delude themselves by thinking
t h at they are less likely to contract HIV from the yo u n g .
By UN standards, 80 per cent of the sex wo r k e rs in
Cambodia are yo u t h . In other countri e s ,m a ny yo u n g
hill tribe women have ended up in the sex industry.
And this trade continues to gr ow.
M a ny gove rnments have tried to deal realisti-
cally with the prostitution issue. For example, C a m-
bodia and Thailand have supplied condoms in bro-
t h e l s. This is an important measure, when yo u
consider that the yo u n g, less well-off men who drop
out of school before being taught about HIV- p r e-
vention and reproductive health, are among those
who may feel they can’t afford a condom. But not
all condoms are free. Pove rt y, especially among
yo u t h ,p l ays a major role in the spread of the viru s.
W h at appears to be a cheap price for a condom to an
office worker in Bangkok, m ay be prohibitive l y
e x p e n s i ve to a bicycle tire repairman in a village.A s
m a ny A f rican programmes have show n , money for
e d u c ation and prevention in all form s , from all sec-
t o rs , is a key factor in fighting the spread of the viru s.
Because so many young people in Southeast A s i a
are beyond the reach of traditional HIV/Aids educa-
tion progr a m m e s ,m a ny of the most successful ones
h ave invo l ved peer group talks.These might take place
in the wo r k p l a c e ,i n f o rmally at someone’s home,
d u ring youth festiva l s , vo c ational training pro-
grammes or via other community activities. Pe e r - t o -
peer education invo l ves not just discussing Aids and
the peer pressures involving sex, but includes talking
about eve ry t h i n g, helping young people gain life skills
to negotiate all the issues in their live s.
The local media that may reach the majority of
the less-educated population make an import a n t
contribution to forming people’s attitudes to HIV.
Soap operas have been a successful medium for
spreading the HIV message in Viet Nam. A non-
g ove rnmental organization in Cambodia sponso-
red a boat tour along the Mekong to produce a video
about an HIV- p o s i t i ve Cambodian soldier retur-
ning home. Because it was well-made and captured
the audience’s interest, the video was an extremely
e f f e c t i ve education tool and was seen by ove r
100,000 in the space of three months.
To counter gi ven the many negat i ve represen-
t ations of Aids victims in T h a i l a n d , a group of NGOs
has commissioned a series of portraits of yo u n g
people with HIV. Professional photogr a p h e rs ,m a ny
of whom have worked with fashion magazines, h ave
d o n ated their services to help young people see that
these individuals are as beautiful, and as full of life,
as everyone else.
The epidemic, which disproport i o n ately affects
young people, must be seen as a socio-economic
and a development problem by gove rnments and
society at large. Unless there is a rapid and effective
r e s p o n s e , it is foreseeable that Aids will curb the
economic gr owth of the region in the ye a rs to come.
It is imperat i ve that development plans incorp o r at e
an HIV/Aids pers p e c t i ve , and all the more so when
dealing specifically with programmes targeting the
region’s youth. n
