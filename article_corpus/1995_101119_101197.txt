round 900 million people
living in drylands all over
the world are directly
affected by the phenomenon of
desertification which is also respon¬
sible annually for the loss of some
$42 billion in income: Asia
accounting for $21 billion approxi¬
mately, Africa $9 billion, North
America $5 billion, South America
and Australia $3 billion each, and
Europe $1 billion," reports the Sep¬
tember 1994 issue of UNESCO's envi¬
ronmental education newsletter
Connect. "Of about 100 countries
affected by what is now considered
to be one of the most serious global
environmental problems, 81 are
developing countries, including a
majority of the Least Developed
Countries."
The stakes are high, and the
solutions hard to find. Detailed
study, however, has enabled scien¬
tists to rebut certain false yet per¬
sistent ideas that tend to shed the
responsibility for desertification
onto people who are actually blame
less. These people are victims of the
disappearance of traditional prac¬
tices that were effective in managing
dryland ecosystems and getting the
most out of them. Jean-Jacques
Perennes, who has studied the
North African environment for forty
years, believes that small farmers
have been forgotten by the agro-
industry, by engineers and by the
technocrats in charge of major inter¬
national programmes.
DISTURBING THE BALANCE
V
In the past twenty years the defini¬
tion of the term desertification has
given rise to much debate. In 1994
the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee for the Elaboration of
an International Convention to
Combat Desertification defined
desertification as "land degradation
in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-
humid areas resulting from various
factors, including climatic varia¬
tions and human activities."
According to Monique Mainguet,
professor of geography at the Uni¬
versity of Reims (France), "One
third of the land-mass, from 35 to 37
per cent of our planet (45 million
km2) are dry areas inhabited by 15
to 20 per cent of the world's popu¬
lation. These lands are found in the
polar, temperate, sub-tropical, trop¬
ical and even equatorial zones."
Yet 69 per cent of these drylands
that are used for agriculture are
either degraded or seriously threat¬
ened by desertification. "Natural
factors," Connect points out,
"though capable of putting severe
strain on the ecosystem, by them¬
selves do not account for land degra¬
dation unless they are aggravated
by human activities such as ill-
planned cultivation practices, defor¬
estation, overgrazing and faulty irri¬
gation techniques."
Dr. Mainguet says that the imbal¬
ance has several causes. The first
dates from the beginning of the colo¬
nial period, when pastoral societies
lost their influence over arable
farmers, and hence their power to

control access to land and water.
Arable farmers occupied the grazing
lands, and the herders were rele¬
gated for too long to unsuitable
areas. Today, because of advances in
veterinary medicine, the size of
herds is increasing. With the best
of intentions, outside funding
sources are increasing the number of
public wells without consulting local
populations, and traditional prac¬
tices have gradually been aban¬
doned. The situation is further com¬
plicated by demographic factors, a
reduction in the time when the
ground is left fallow, the felling of
trees for fodder and firewood, and
urban growth that increases the
demand for food, although farmers
feel excluded from development
because cereal prices are falling.
The British ecologist Edward
Goldsmith is indignant because, he
says, nomad pastoralists have been
accused of being unproductive and
of destroying the environment,
whereas well-boring programmes
that have led to overgrazing and
the prohibition on burning grass¬
land before grazing have increased
the proliferation of tse-tse flies and
reduced the nutritional value of
dry-season grass. Goldsmith
believes that in view of the disas¬
trous failures of modern animal
husbandry programmes, the tradi-

tional methods seem increasingly
soundly based.
Monique Mainguet provides
some interesting details about bush
fires. Whether accidental or delib¬
erate, these fires destroy the humus
which retains water, mineral salts
and microbial life in the topsoil.
They are harmful in the middle and
especially at the end of the dry
season, but not at the beginning of
the season when they free the soil
from the preceding season's residual
growth and provide the animals with
good-quality fodder.
GOOD AND BAD METHODS
Human beings have survived in
deserts only because they have been
able to increase the quantity ofwater
available to meet their needs. One
example of wise practice is found in
the semi-arid zone of Brazil's
Nordeste region, where organic
matter is used as fertilizer, and the
people avoid ploughing the land so
as not to cause compacting of the
soil. Run-off water is captured in
small ditches, and a layer of plant
debris spread over the ground main¬
tains moisture in the soil and turns
into humus. Grazing land and cer¬
tain crops are sheltered from the
sun by bushes and trees. Fodder is
stored in silos. In contrast to such
extremely useful operations, large-
scale irrigation threatens to cause
salinity of the soil, as well as being
costly and creating few jobs.
Constant irrigation is not a mir¬
acle solution, as some have thought.
The October 1994 issue of the UNESCO
Courier looked in some detail at the
example of the Aral region.

to industry, while 8 per cent is used
for domestic purposes. At present,
according to Edward Goldsmith, 90
per cent of the land in Egypt, 68 per
cent in Pakistan, 50 per cent in Iraq,
38 per cent in Peru, from 25 to 30 per
cent in the United States and from 15
to 20 per cent in India, Russia and
Australia are suffering from salin¬
ization. Sodium chloride and sodium
sulphate, and sodium, magnesium
and calcium carbonates in the soil
or in irrigation water accumulate at
the root level of crops or, worse still,
turn into a sterile, rock-hard crust.
At an International conference
on "Arid Lands Today and
Tomorrow" held in Arizona in 1985,
UNESCO environmental specialist
Michel Bâtisse pointed out that
although industrialized countries
such as the United States and Aus
tralia have the resources to make the
best use of their arid regions, this is
not the case for countries like India ,
Kenya and Somalia. "Moreover," he
continued, "the spectacular but
somewhat artificial arid-land devel¬
opment schemes implemented here
and there, most notably in oil-rich
countries of the Middle East, should
create no illusion. Heavily subsidized
irrigation, careless mining of fossil
aquifers, energy-voracious desali¬
nation of seawater not to mention
the towing of icebergs are no
answer to sustained development."
UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere
Programme (MAB) has for many
years been trying to encourage a
harmonious balance between
research, its applications, engineers,
public authorities and people, who
often seem to be ignored by inter¬
national projects.
"Humanity's efforts to survive
in arid regions," notes Monique
Mainguet, "have helped to sharpen
the human mind. Was it not in these
areas that monotheism and the phi¬
losophy of continuing progress first
took hold? The 20th century, a time
of fewer certainties, has seen the
high water mark of one phase of
development, then the first signs of
decline. I wonder if great works,
because of their vast scale and their
sometimes disastrous consequences,
are not symptoms of a kind of loss of
control by human genius and the
prelude to a disturbing decline."
Will the 21st century be a time when
the idea that small is beautiful is
rediscovered?
