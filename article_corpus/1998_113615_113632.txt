Be rtrand Russell’s caution on the ethic of
science is more pertinent today than eve r
b e f o r e . But we still seem far from deve l o p i n g
an effective human rights framework to guide the
choices we , as a world community,make about the use
of emerging technologies.The sheer momentum of
s c i e n c e ,s p u rred on by the commercial entities funding
research,continues to dominate our decisions. Can
human rights instruments gi ve us the direction we
need?  Perhaps not.
The response of legi s l at o rs to the ongoing “ g e n e t i c
r e vo l u t i o n ” i l l u s t r ates the shortcomings of curr e n t
r e g u l at o ry approaches.The Human Genome Project,
an intern ational effort to sequence and map all the
human genes, is probably the most scrutinized scientific
e n d e avour in history. Most of the part i c i p ating nat i o n s
h ave set aside part of their science budgets to address
the ethical, legal and social issues invo l ve d .Yet this
analysis has resulted in only a few formal genetic policies
with any real legal teeth.
Domestic law has always struggled to keep pace
with the advance of technology. The problems are
amplified in the arena of international human rights
law with its plurality of cultures, beliefs and values.
Only the most basic principles are likely to surv i ve the
polarized debates. As exemplified by the UNESCO
D e c l a r ation on the Protection of the Human Genome,
the substance of many of the final documents seems
to hinge on the interp r e t ation of amorphous terms like
“human dignity”.
There are also more specific reasons why it is
difficult to create effective human rights “ ru l e s ”
including:the daunting task of writing scientifically
meaningful regulations and the fact that the social
n o rms which compel the implementation of
safeguards evo l ve almost as quickly as the technology
(consider in vitro fertilization).
The regulat o ry issues raised by Dolly, the firs t
cloned mammal, highlight these challenges. Fo r
e x a m p l e , a number of the pre-Dolly laws prohibiting
human cloning, such as Great Bri t a i n ’s , a d d r e s s e d
e m b ryo splitting technology. As a result, a ri gi d
a p p l i c ation of such provisions would miss the nuclear
transfer technique used to create Dolly.
More import a n t l y, Dolly highlights the need for
meticulous policy analysis. U n f o rt u n at e l y, an ill-
i n f o rmed polemic seems to dri ve far too much of the
“ b i o p o l i cy ”d i a l o g u e . One could argue that both the
eugenic laws of the early twentieth century and the
recent commentary on human cloning are based on an
i n a c c u r ate view of genetic determ i n i s m .T h at is an
ironic conclusion, since state-imposed eugenic policies
obviously offend human dignity while cloning
r e g u l ations explicitly seek to protect it. N e ve rt h e l e s s ,
if one scrutinizes the proposals to ban human cloning
it is difficult to find a sat i s fa c t o ry critique of this paradox .
A wo rrisome trend gi ven that a deterministic ethos is
arguably more threatening to human dignity than an
u n d e veloped cloning technology.
But let us consider a possibly more troubling
c o n t r ove rs y. M a ny have argued that the marri a g e
b e t ween commerce and human genetics will usher in
an era of  laissez faire eugenics in which the social
d e finitions of disease, disability and norm a l cy are
dictated by market forces.
H ow can traditional human rights instru m e n t s
address such a concern? It may be impossible.First,
the commercialization of genetics is part of a gr ow i n g,
multi-billion dollar industry viewed by many
governments as a vital part of the economy.
S e c o n d ,because the notion of autonomy remains
a fundamental human ri g h t , a ny policy seen as
curtailing the ability to choose will meet resistance.
F u rt h e rm o r e , in many We s t e rn countries individual
freedom is indistinguishable from a perceived right to
be an unrestrained consumer. In health care,
a u t o n o my has metamorphosed from a right to
determine what is done to your body into a right of
access. State imposed eugenic policies are relatively
easy to condemn, but how do you get at the aggr e g at e
effect of consumer decisions?    
F i n a l l y, the subtle attitudinal changes associat e d
with the genetic revolution are the result of social
f o r c e s , not state policies.As such they may easily pass
unnoticed.
Though I am not a “ L u d d i t e ,” some form of social
control is needed.H owe ve r ,m a ny concerns associat e d
with the genetic revolution may be beyond the reach
of human rights instru m e n t s.The genetech industry
will be propelled forward by social forces imbedded
in the fa b ric of We s t e rn culture. It seems certain that
the cumulat i ve pressure of these forces will prove too
much for the most sharply crafted declaration. n



Keeping up with
science Timothy Caulfield*
“Science, by itself, cannot supply us with an
ethic.  It can show us how to achieve a given
end, and it may show us that some ends
cannot be achieved.  But among ends that can
be achieved our choice must be decided by
other than purely scientific considerations.” 
Bertrand Russell, 1950
