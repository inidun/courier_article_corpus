The world's first iron bridge, built in 1779
across England's River Severn, came to epitomize the genesis of
industrialization based on iron and coal

B . . . Ifan atheist who had never
heard of Coalbrookdale could be
transported there in a dream, and
left to awake at the mouth of one
of those furnaces, surrounded on

his life the most profligate unbe¬

to incredulity, he would infallibly
tremble at the last judgement that in
imagination would appear to him.
With these apocalyptic words,
written in 1801 , the dramatist and
traveller Charles Dunlin concluded
his observations on the Severn Gorge
in Shropshire, in the Midlands of
England. What drew Dihdin and
numerous other travellers there in
the late eighteenth and early nine¬
teenth centuries was the remark-

ahle concentration of industrial
activity, concerned in the main with
ironmaking, spread along some five
kilometres of the valley of the River
Severn. Today this area, known as
the Ironhridge Gorge, is a World
Heritage Site in recognition of its
outstanding importance in the early
development of industrialization.
THE DARBYS OF COALBROOKDALE
The initial importance of the Sev¬
ern Gorge stems from the pioneering
work of the Quaker ironmaster Abra¬
ham Darby (1678-1717) who in
1709 developed a technique for
smelting iron using coked coal as a
fuel instead of the charcoal made
from wood which was convention¬
ally used at the time. lie had taken
over an existing charcoal-fired blast
furnace built about J 638 in Coal¬
brookdale, a small side valley of the
River Severn, and using local coal
converted into coke he was success¬
ful in smeltingironore to form a use-
aide iron.
Although the impart of this new
technology was limited at first, per¬
haps because there was little price
advantage in coke-smelted iron, by
the middle years of the eighteenth
century Coalbrookdale and the sur-
roundingarea, by then in the hands
of the second Abraham Darby
(1711-63), bad become an impor¬
tant source of good quality iron.
Ry using coked coal as fuel iron¬
masters were freed from the restric¬
tions imposed by limited supplies of
timber for charcoal. Already, by
1700, Rritain had less forest cover

than any other European state, as a
result of clearance for agriculture,
cutting for charcoal and the
demands of the Navy for ship¬
building. Rut coal was available in
virtually unlimited quantities; and
with coke as a fuel, blast furnaces
could be built bigger, thus allow¬
ing larger castings to be made. Coke
smelting was to become almost uni¬
versal in the early years of the nine¬
teenth century.
THE WORLD'S FIRSTIRON BRIDGE
During the eighteenth century the
Coalbrookdale Company became
renowned not only for the making
of iron but for using iron in new and
innovative ways. Here the first iron
rails were made along which ran
trucks with iron wheels, pushed by
men or pulled by horses, carrying
iron goods down to wharves on the
river. Then in the 1770s came the
most dramatic and spectacular new
use for iron, in the building of the
world's first iron bridge.
The River Severn, England's
longest river, was one of the keys to
the success of the Coalbrookdale
area. It provided ready access to out¬
side markets for the products of the
iron foundries and forges, for coal
and clay from local pits, and foi-
bricks, tiles and pottery. Rut the
Severn also presented a barrier to
the movement of goods by road from
one side of the gorge to the other.
The need for a bridge resulted in
the novel proposal to build one ol
iron. Under the supervision of the
third Abraham Darby (1750-89),
then in charge of the Coalbrookdale
Company, the bridge was cast and
erected in the summer of 1779. It
was opened on New Year's Day
1781, the first large-scale use of iron
for structural purposes in the world
and a remarkable demonstration of
the utility and versatility of iron for
construction. With a span of 30
metres, the graceful semi-circular
arch reached across the gorge of the
Severn at its narrowest point, an ele¬
gant centrepiece for what the cotton
master Charles Ilulbert was to call
in 1837 "the most extraordinary dis¬
trict in the world".
As a river crossing and as a sin¬
gular example of new engineering
the Iron Rridge was an immediate
success but its symbolic significance
was much greater, not only in
Britain but throughout Europe and
in the United States. It epitomized
the birth of a new era in human his¬
tory in which industrial technolo
gies were to provide immeasurable
opportunities.
Even before the construction of
the Iron Rridge the valley of the
River Severn around Coalbrookdale
was already becoming a magnet for all
who wished to see the the birth of
industrialization based on iron and
coal. Many visitors from ov erseas came
to see the furnaces and forges of the
iron industry, coalpits and pumping
engines, the canal with its celebrated
inclined plane down which boats
could pass to the Severn, the famous
china works at Coalport and the Tar
Tunnel nearby from which oozed nat¬
ural bitumen used for waterproofing
and medicinal purposes.
The gorge exercised a peculiar
fascination on artists too. Here the
combination of topography the
River Severn llowing through its
precipitous gorge and the smoke
and flames of the furnaces and
forges conspired to produce a scene
at once picturesque, and sublime.
Rut one view above all others epit¬
omizes the artist's vision of the new
industrial Britain. It has become
the archetypal description of the
first industrial nation. Coalbrook¬
dale by ¡Sight, painted in 1801, is
the work of Philippe Jacques de
Loutherbourg (17-10-1812). In it,

the buildings of an ironworks are

In the foreground horses pull a
wagon on an iron tramway among
great castings. The painting has
become one of the most famous
images of the new industrial age.
DERELICTION AND DECAY
Throughout the nineteenth century
industry thrived in the Ironbridge
Gorge, as it was to become known,
but its unique contribution was
largely over. Other, better located,
industrial areas overtook it in scale
and influence. As canals and later
railways linked the growing indus¬
trial regions of Britain to ports like
London, Liverpool and Glasgow,
Coalbrookdale became bypassed.
By the beginning of the twenti¬
eth century the Ironbridge Gorge
was in decline. The Coalport China
Works closed in 1926, production
having moved to the Potteries of
Staffordshire, but the foundries in
Coalbrookdale remained, as they
do today. The last of the tile works
in the Gorge, where from the 1870s
decorative floor and wall tiles had
been made from local clay, closed in
1969. Dereliction and decay were
the features that characterized the
gorge. Cottages once occupied by
workers in the iron, pottery or tile
factories lay empty, shops closed
as people moved away to find work
elsewhere. To the north the area of
the old East Shropshire coalfield
was similarly in decline. The last
pit closed in 1979.
But the distinguished industrial
history of the Ironbridge Gorge was
never forgotten. Writing in 1955
Michael Rix (1913-81), an archi¬
tectural historian, referred exten¬
sively to the importance of the area
and its monuments and used for the
first time in print the term "indus¬
trial archaeology" to describe their
significance. In 1961, in the third
issue of the Journal of Industrial
Archaeology he made an impas¬
sioned jilea for the establishment
of "national parks" of industrial
archaeology stating that the "Iron-
bridge Gorge is a prime candidate
for such a designation".

group, had excavated the Old Fur¬
nace and opened a small museum
in 1959 to commemorate the 250th
anniversary of Darby's smelting of
iron with coke. And a growing num¬
ber of those with an interest in
industrial archaeology made pil¬
grimages to see the extensive
remains, still surviving, of this pio¬
neer industrial site.
The years of industrial and
urban renewal after the Second
World War saw the sweeping away
of much of the evidence of Rritain
as an early industrial nation but this
destruction, inevitable as it was, led
to a growing recognition that the
archaeological evidence of the age
in which we still lived the indus¬
trial age was disappearing too.
Efforts began all over the country to
record or preserve the archaeology
of the Industrial Revolution.
Such was the extent of the
decline in and around the Iron-
bridge Gorge and the area immedi¬
ately to the north that it was des¬
ignated as a New Town, making it
eligible for special funding from
government. Under the terms of the
New Towns Act of 1946 new com¬
munities were established in many

parts of England, initially on green
field sites, in order to accommodate
the growing populations of great
conurbations like London, Birm¬
ingham and Manchester. Under the
same legislativ e provisions a second
generation of new towns was cre¬
ated with the same aims but
located in areas of industrial decay,
high unemployment and social
deprivation.
The old East Shropshire Coal¬
field became one of these new
towns. The objective was to renew
the worn-out infrastructure, build
new houses, and encourage new
industry to bring jobs to the area.
The boundaries of the new town of
Telford, named, appropriately,
after the great civil engineer
Thomas Telford who had estab¬
lished his early reputation in Shrop¬
shire in the 1780s, were specifically
defined so that the Ironbridge
Gorge was included in recognition of
its historical and archaeological
importance and amenity potential.
The new town could have
spelled the extinction of the indus
trial archaeology of the Ironbridge
Gorge. But from the outset enlight¬
ened planning and informed direc¬
tion and management of the new
town development corporation
ensured that proper recognition was
accorded to the most important
sites and monuments. It was Telford
Development Corporation that took
the lead in establishing the Iron-
bridge Gorge Museum Trust,
charged with the daunting task of
preserving and presenting to the
public the evidence of early indus¬
try in the Gorge.
The Trust was formed in 1968
and within three years was engaged
on a major programme of conserva¬
tion and interpretation. Most of the
physical requirements of the Gorge
have been met. The whole of the
valley has been designated as a Con¬
servation Area, and there are now
some 300 buildings listed as being
of architectural and historical
importance.
With the demise of Telford
Development Corporation, its work
of creating the new town substan
tially complete, one element of man¬
agement and control has gone. The
Corporation's support for the
Museum Trust has gone too, to he
replaced by a government endow¬
ment. Proper international recog¬
nition came with the designation of
the Gorge as a World Heritage Site
in 1986, the first area of industrial
significance to be so listed.
Places like the Ironbridge Gorge,
by virtue of their renown and the
recognition that comes with it suffer
peculiar forms of stress. Visitors in
particular are an iuescapable con¬
sequence of fame. They place stress
on communities and on the fabric of
historic environments. There is some¬
thing slightly obscene about places
that are monuments to work being
given over to pleasure. But visitors
have rights and demand access. If
the Ironbridge Gorge is to take its
rightful place as one of the great
monuments to human endeavour
then it needs all the attentive care
and thoughtful respect that we can
bestow. I
