Albert Einstein (1879-1955). The great
physicist played a leading raie in the work
of the Internationallnstitute of Intellectual
Co-operation.
The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget
(1896-1980) was Oirector of the Interna-
tional Bureau of Education from 1929 to
1968.
plia for help, the French Government
offered to create in Paris and to finance
an International Institute of Intellectual
Co-operation, and, in 1926, with the bles-
sing of the Assembly of the League of
Nations, the IIIC came into being.
Properly financed and staffed by a
permanent Secretariat, the IIIC breathed
new life into international intellectual co-
operation. The Institute established
seven sections which dealt with : general
affairs, relations between universities,
libraries and scientific unions, juridical
questions concerning intellectual proper-
ty and the conditions of intellectual
labour, translations and the exchange of
literary works between nations, museums
and artistic relations, and information
and relations with the press and other
media.
We begin to see the embryonic outlines
of things to corne.
International Bureau of Education
(IBE)
After thé First World War, although indi-
vidual educationists and intellectuals
called insistently for an international
organization to promote co-operation
between countries in education, govern-
ments tended to guard jealously their
right to unqualified contre ! over the
education process within their bound-
aries. Indeed, the League of Nations ex-
pressly limited the educationa) activities
of the IIIC to theoretical pedagogical
matters and declared that it should"ab-
stain from activities concerning educa-
tional questions which belong to the
realm of the sovereign Member States."
This, however, merely had the effect of
encouraging independent action and, in
1925, the International Bureau of Educa-
tion was founded in Geneva as a non-
governmental organization. This was
made possible through the sponsorship of
the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute of
the University of Geneva. Despite the
support of this prestigious body, the IBE
soon found itself hampered by lack of
funds and, in 1929, it became a mainly
intergovernmental organization when a
number of States met in Geneva to draw
up and sign a new constitution. However,
the reformed IBE still remained indepen-
dent of the League of Nations.
The main objectives ofthe IBE were to
act as an information clearing house for
aH matters connected with education, to
gather information concerning both pri-
vate and public education, and to under-
take scientific and statistical research in
the educationai field.
During the Second World War the acti-
vities of the IBE were severely curtailed.
Its efforts were concentrated on the
humanitarian work of supplying"intel-
lectual aid"to prisoners of war of ail
nationalités. AItogether it sent some
600, 000 volumes of scientific and literary
works to prisoner of war camps.
With the emergence of Unesco it be-
came clear that the new organization was
better placed to carry out many of the
functions of the IBE, and in 1947 a pro-
visional agreement was drawn up be-
tween the two bodies for their future
unification. In 1968, under the terms of a
new agreement, the old IBE ceased to
exist, its functions being fully assumed by
Unesco. A new IBE was established in
Geneva, under the aegis of Unesco, as an
international centre for comparative edu-
cationa) studies. N
