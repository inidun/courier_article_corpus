Getting youth through the Aids crisis
A fter she heard from a cousin in Ouagadougou
(Burkina Faso) about the dangers of cat c h i n g
A i d s , one of Konat é ’s two wives asked him to
wear a condom. The dismayed Konaté told his
f riends about the request and they made fun of him.
His pride was so wounded that he became impotent
and even his mistress couldn’t solve the problem.
E ventually the village witch-doctor interve n e d
and told Konaté his only hope was to say a prayer at
the foot of the tree on which the “ t h i n g ” ( t h e
condom) supposedly gr e w. So Konaté went off to
look for the tree.
The film K o n at é ’s T h i n g, which came out this
ye a r , tackles Aids prevention in a light-hearted way,
by laughing at male sexual pride and odd customs.
Fanta Regina Nacro, the fil m ’s 36-ye a r - o l d
Burkinabé director,explains her approach:
Why did you use humour to handle such a
distressing topic?
Being alarmist about Aids wo u l d n ’t have helped
m u c h . People run away from painful images. B u t
we all like recalling funny episodes.
As an A f rican wo m a n , I’m particularly concer-
ned about A i d s. I wanted to use the wonderful means
of communication I had—film—to help prevent the
d i s e a s e . I know how my people think and it wo u l d n ’t
h ave worked to say to them in a moving or peremp-
t o ry way “ Wear a condom!”The whole weight of tra-
dition would have come down on me.So I took ano-

Fighting prejudice with laughter, film director Fanta Regina Nacro 
gets a strong message acro s s
ther tack.Through laughter, you can fight prejudice
more easily.
You raise a number of questions yet you don’t deal
directly with young people even though they have
been hit the hardest by the epidemic.
I’m the first to admit this.But try and tell that to the
N ational Centre for Aids Preve n t i o n . I was told that
it would be “ d r a g ging them down into debauchery.”
They were so insistent that I gave up.The issue reeks
of hy p o c ri s y. Health offic i a l s , community organiza-
t i o n s ,e ve ryone invo l ved in the fight against A i d s ,t h e y
all avoid talking about and to young people. Fo rt u n a-
tely children are present during awareness campaigns
in the villages and no one chases them away. So they
l e a rn how to use condoms, just as they can if they see
my fil m .
We don’t have the right to leave children in the
dark about A i d s. Right now, I’m trying to get the
film more widely distri buted so most young people
in Burkina Faso can see it. I t ’s been shown on nat i o-
nal television but not eve ryo n e ’s got a TV set.A tra-
velling cinema is in the wo r k s , along with public pre-
sentations and discussions to be held in provincial
towns and villages.
How do you gauge your success?
In A f rican countri e s , where there aren’t any ve n-
ding machines for contraceptive s ,p e o p l e — e s p e c i a l l y
young people—don’t dare to go and buy them.We
d e c i d e d , as part of a promotion campaign, to either
hand out a free box of contraceptives or the equiva-
lent of one dollar.When a fa rm - worker was handed a
b ox of condoms, he was visibly delighted.When he
was gi ven money, he was gr ateful but nothing more.
With a dollar,he could buy five boxes but he wo u l d n ’t
dare do so.
Since the film has been shown in Burkina Fa s o,
kids have been asking in the market simply for
“ K o n at é ’s thing” and that ’s what they get. T h i s
a c h i e vement is much more important to me than
any prize the film has won.
