S to us, her colleagues at Novaya Gaze-
ta. It help us and allows us to con-
tinue working,” declared Viatcheslav 
Izmaylov, journalist at Novaya Gaze-
ta, assigned the investigation on her 
murder. “It represents recognition 
and is important for her children.” 
Among her collection of interna-
tional prizes, Ms Politkovskaya had 
received the Golden Pen of Rus-
sia award, a Special Diploma of the 
Jury of the Andrei Sakharov Prize, 
the Olof Palme Prize and the 2003 
Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE) Prize 
for Journalism and Democracy. Her 
global fame did not suffice, however, 
to keep her safe. Nor did the security 
plan that on several occasions pro-
vided her (and other Novaya Gazeta 
journalists now) with 24 hour police 
protection.
Several times, she was offered 
political asylum in Europe, but she 
always turned down the possibility. 
“She couldn’t abandon people who 
ANNA POLITKOVSKAYA:  
MURDERED BECAUSE SHE 
STOOD ALONE
She used to say “Words can save 
lives.” She was convinced her testi-
mony could help mentalities evolve. 
Yet words finally killed her. Anna Polit-
kovskaya was murdered on Saturday 
7 October 2006, shot down as she 
was coming home, on Lesnaya street 
in Moscow. Her last article on Chech-
nya, unfinished, was published by her 
newspaper Novaya Gazeta (circula-
tion: one million) a few days after her 
death. 
To pay tribute to her courage and 
commitment, the Director-General of 
UNESCO, on the recommendation 
of an independent international jury, 
decided to name her laureate of the 
UNESCO-Guillermo Cano World 
Press Freedom Prize posthumously, a 
first in the prize’s history. The chairman 
of the jury, Kavi Chongkittavorn, hailed 
Ms Politkovskaya’s “incredible stub-
bornness”, which pushed her to con-
tinue “chronicling events in Chechnya 
when the whole world had lost interest 
in that conflict”. “This prize means a lot 
counted on her,” her Novaya Gazeta 
colleague explains. “She never took 
sides, but she denounced all viola-
tions. Her articles talked about peo-
ple, justice and law.” The United Na-
tions High Commissioner for Human 
Rights Louise Arbour recognized 
these qualities when she said “Her 
death is an immense loss for the 
Russian Federation and for all who 
fight for human rights.” 
The woman whose warmth belied 
her rather severe appearance was 
born in 1958 in the United States, 
the daughter of Soviet diplomats. 
Mother of two children, now aged 
26 and 28, she began her career at 
Izvestiya in the 1980s, during pere-
stroika. She joined the editorial staff 
of the opposition biweekly Novaya 
Gazeta in 1999, and was respon-
sible for the paper’s coverage of the 
war in Chechnya. 
In 2001, accused of entering 
Chechnya without authorization, she 
was abducted for three days. Seven 
months later she received a threat-
ening letter from an officer convicted 
of executing Chechen civilians. She 
had written extensively about him 
and her articles had weighed upon 
the trial. Ms Politkovskaya lived un-
der the shadow of constant menace. 
“But during the last weeks, the 
threats had stopped. We noticed 
and found it strange,” recalls Mr Is-
maylov. In the diary she kept on her 
computer, she admitted her fears. 
“She was afraid of doing her job, of 
going to Chechnya. It was painful 
work. Yet her conscience compelled 
her to surmount her anxiety. No one 
noticed that in the seven years she 
worked at Novaya Gazeta, her hair 
had turned white.” 
“If all journalists had been as cou-
rageous as Anna Politkovskaya, she 
wouldn’t have been killed,” affirmed 
the head of the journalists’ union in 
Russia on the day of her funeral, “be-
cause those who killed her would 
have hesitated at the thought that 
another journalist would take her 
place. She died because she stood 
alone.”

For the first time this year, the UNESCO-Guillermo Cano World Press 
Freedom Prize was awarded posthumously, to the Russian journalist  
Anna Politkovskaya. Despite fear and threats, she continued  
to cover the situation in Chechnya until she was murdered.
