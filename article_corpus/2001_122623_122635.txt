S
ince the dawn of civilization, h u m a n k i n d
has marvelled at the skies and at Nature’s
myriad creations.This sense of wonder was
deeply interwoven with a sense of fear:
N a t u r e ’s dual role as creator and destroyer
has puzzled and polarized our perceptions of the
c o s m o s. As a way of establishing a degree of control
over the apparent unpredictability of natural
p h e n o m e n a , gods were held responsible for these
c o n flicting manifestations.In short,Nature was deifie d .
The question of why there is something rather
than nothing was a crucial part of this process. All
cultures have attempted to provide an answer to the
mystery of creation, and our modern scientific
tradition is no exception.Perhaps more surprisingly,
there is an intriguing correspondence between
answers suggested by mythic narratives and those
suggested by scientific research. The crucial
d i f f e r e n c e,of course, is that the
scientific process is capable of
weeding out explanations
which do not measure up to
o b s e r v a t i o n s,while those based
on myth are held true on the
basis of faith alone.
Greece and reason
Creation myths can be
divided conveniently into two
k i n d s : either the cosmos
appeared at a specific moment
in time marking the beginning of history, or it has
always been “there.” Myths with a creation event
describe time in a linear fashion,with a beginning,
middle and, as in the Christian narrative, an end.
Myths without a creation event may consider time
to be either unimportant or cy c l i c. Within these
two sets,we encounter an enormous variety.S t a r t i n g
with the “no creation myths,” the two possibilities
a r e :an eternal,uncreated cosmos,as in the narrative
of the Jains of India,or a cyclic cosmos, c o n t i n u o u s l y
created and destroyed, as beautifully represented in
the Hindu tradition by the dance of Shiva.
The first and by far the most common “myth
with creation” invokes a deity or deities who create
the world, as in the Judaeo-Christian myth of
Genesis. A second possibility is that the world was
created out of nothing, without the interference of
a god; this is what the Maori people of New Zealand
have in mind when they sing, “from nothing the
begetting, from nothing the increase. . . .” A final
possibility is that the world appeared spontaneously
from a primordial Chaos, where order coexists with
disorder, Being with Non-Being.
The religious nature of the creation event has
permeated scientific thought since its origins in
Ancient Greece in the sixth century BC. As the
Greek philosophers pondered the physical
mechanisms that created the world and controlled
its motions, many assumed an organizational
principle based on rational design, attributed to a
“ D e m i u r g e ” by Plato or to the “Unmoved Mover”
by A r i s t o t l e.Plato was a true heir of the Pythagorean
t r a d i t i o n ,which saw the world as a manifestation of
N u m b e r, arranged and combined to create the
harmonies perceived by the
s e n s e s. The emphasis on a
creation event was somewhat
left aside, being substituted by
the importance of reason in
understanding the workings of
N a t u r e.The philosopher, in his
search for rational meaning,
was in effect elevating himself
to a higher level of existence—
that of the Demiurge’s mind.
To understand Nature was to
understand God,or, in an oft-
quoted aphorism,to understand the mind of God.
This tradition reappeared in the West during
the birth of modern science in the Renaissance.
The great natural philosophers that spearheaded the
so-called Copernican Revolution were all, to a
greater or lesser degree,deeply religious men, w h o
saw their scientific work as an integral part of their
religious beliefs. Th u s, Copernicus himself was a
canon of the cathedral in Frauenberg, a reluctant
revolutionary who sought to reconcile the
arrangement of the celestial spheres with the
Platonic ideal of circular motions with constant
v e l o c i t i e s. His model of the solar system was an
elegant compromise between the old and the new,
looking back at Plato and forward at the aesthetic
principles of his time. His great opus, On the
The m y t h s of science
Myth, religion and science have more often than not proved inseparable
in addressing the eternal imponderable: why something rather than
nothing?
2 . C O S M O S, GOD AND US

To understand Nature
was to understand
God, or, in an
oft-quoted aphorism,
to understand
the mind of God.

Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs, was dedicated to
Pope Paul III, in the hope that the Church would
recognize the need for a reinterpretation of the
Scriptures based on the new astronomical thought.
It was through the work of Giordano Bruno
a n d , more importantly,Johannes Kepler and Galileo
G a l i l e i , that the Copernican Revolution was
e n a c t e d . Kepler was deeply influenced by the
Pythagorean tradition, a number mystic who
believed geometry to be the key to the cosmic
harmony. His three laws of planetary motion are a
powerful illustration of how the scientific output of
a great mind can be a byproduct of a belief system
tempered by the analysis of data.
No final truths
G a l i l e o ’s now famous tribulations with the
Church were also a product of his beliefs.A pious
(and overconfident) man, Galileo took as his
personal mission to reset the course of Christian
t h e o l o g y, preaching to the Church leaders the
importance of accepting the new cosmic design.
The clash was unavoidable, and in 1633 Galileo
was forced to abjure his conviction in the
Copernican system.Not for long, though,for soon
after Isaac Newton put forward his three laws of
motion and his universal theory of gravity in 1687,
the sun-centered cosmos became widely accepted.
To Newton, the cosmos was a manifestation of
G o d ’s glory, i n finite in extent and sublime in design.
During the twentieth century, the Newtonian
universe was substituted by a curved Einsteinian
universe;Einstein showed how matter and energy
can bend space and alter the flow of time, e n d o w i n g
them with an unprecedented plasticity. N o w h e r e
is this more spectacularly displayed than in the
expansion of the universe itself,discovered by Edwin
Hubble in 1929. Once again, the question of origins
came back to haunt scientists: if the universe is
expanding, there was a moment in time when all
matter was squeezed into a very small volume.
Astronomy was proclaiming that the universe did
have an origin, after all.A cry of dissent emerged
from Cambridge University via the proposal of the
“steady-state model,” where the universe never
had a beginning in time.With the discovery that the
whole cosmos is immersed in a bath of microwave
radiation in the 1960s, the steady-state model was
abandoned by most cosmologists; the “ b i g - b a n g
model” has since been accepted as the one which
best fits the data.
Can science “explain” the age-old question of
Creation? Certainly,physical models describing the
origin of the cosmos can and have been proposed,a t
least since the 1970s.But these models face a serious
technical obstacle: the lack of a proper theory to
describe physical processes at the enormous energy
scales prevalent during the first moments of cosmic
h i s t o r y. They could be called scientific creation
n a r r a t i v e s, at least until they can be placed on more
solid theoretical ground.We see old themes coming
b a c k ,dressed in scientific jargon. In some models the
universe was born out of “ n o t h i n g,” a quantum
vacuum populated by all sorts of ephemeral energy
fluctuations;others see the beginning as essentially
c h a o t i c, with an ordered cosmos emerging
homogeneously in three dimensions.
Some of these models of creation make
predictions about measurable properties of the
u n i v e r s e,which can be used to test and refine them.
Yet it may be hard to rule out all alternative models,
which may also be compatible with these
measurements. The best that we can hope for is a
workable model of cosmic origins, compatible with
observations but open to changes. S c i e n t i fic inquiry
is after all an ongoing process—there is no fin a l
t r u t h , only approximations to the truth.
Furthermore, science, at least as it is formulated at
p r e s e n t , cannot answer questions concerning its
own origin: we do not know why the universe
operates according to the laws we have uncovered
and not others. This essential incompleteness of
science suggests a new form of complementarity
between science and religion; religion does not exist
to cover the holes of our scientific knowledge, but
as a driving force behind scientific inspiration.
Through our search for knowledge we uncover our
true nature, fuelled by the same sense of mystery
which filled our ancestors with awe. ■
