Refugee Musical
"ambassadors 
Tour
Western Europe
To draw attention to the plight of over 650qualified musicians and singers still living
in International Refugee Organization
(IRO) camps in Germany, Austria and Italy, five
refugee musicians made a concert tour under IRO
sponsorship to several Western European capitals
during July.
These five musicians-violinists Elise Cser-
falvi, 22, and Arpad Gerecz, 25, both of Budapest ;
pianists Charles Reiner, 26, of Budapest, and
Boris Maximowicz, 44, of Kiev ; and 26 years old
basso Ladislas Pudis, of Czechoslovakia-were
selected at a competition by a jury of Geneva
Conservatory professors.
Together with accompanist Siegfried Oehl-
giesser, also a stateless refugee, these artists
gave performances in Geneva, Zurich, Amster-
dam, Paris and London.
The concert tour was organized by the IRO to
awaken world attention to the problem of refugee
intellectuals and artists who, five years after the
war's end, are still waiting for a chance to leave
the displaced persons camps of Central Europe.
In January 1950, there were still 38, 000
refugees registered with IRO who were pro-
fessional and managerial workers, or members of
their families.
The Director General of IRO, Mr. Donald
Kingsley, has appealed to the governments of
the world to find new homes for this"forgotten
elite"before this U. N. specialised agency closes
down on March 31st next year.
