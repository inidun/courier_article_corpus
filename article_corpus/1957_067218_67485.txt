I hough little more than 250 miles separate
I Cairo from the St. Catherine Monastery in
the Sinai Peninsula this distance adds up to a
two-day journey by automobile. In the pre-
automobile era, pilgrims spent 15 days on
camel's back on the same trip.
From Cairo to Suez there is a fine highway,
but once across the Canal, the road becomes
little more than a track on which vehicles
have to move slowly, grinding through the
sand or bouncing over loose stones. But the
traveller becomes so absorbed in the majestic
beauty of the scenery and in the monastery
when he reaches it that he hardly notices the
rigours of the journey.
In the first centuries of the Christian era the
Sinai Peninsula became a centre of refuge for
monks and Anchorites (the early Christian
recluses and hermits). About the beginning
of the 4th century they sent a delegation to
St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great,
asking her protection. She ordered the
erection of a small fortress with a church
built inside.
We still have a descriptive picture of the
area as it appeared to a nun of noble birth
named Sylvia (also .known as Etheria) from
Spanish Galicia, who went to visit the Holy
Places of the Sinai early in the 4th century.
Apart from her pious virtues, Etheria had
also the makings of an excellent reporter.
She recounts the journey she made to the Sinai
in great detail, with a wealth of
facts on the history of each site
(facts which have hardly changed
in 16 centuries). At the foot of

Sinai Monastery

Uoth the St. Catherine Monastery (one of the
oldest known in the Christian world) and the
priceless treasures it contains have been pro¬
nounced "intact" following the recent hostilities
on the Sinai peninsula, where the monastery is
situated.
The statement was made by a Belgian specialist,
Professor Gerard Garitte, who was sent by
Unesco to investigate the condition of the
monastery and its collections, at the request of the
Governments of Egypt and Israel.
Professor Garitte was also a member of a three-
man team who microfilmed almost 2,000,000
pages of manuscripts of the St. Catherine collec¬
tion in 1950 for the U. S. Library of Congress.

for monks and gardens. Below, close-up of ramparts.

Mount Moses (The Mountain of the
Decalogue) she found a community of
monks living on the reputed site of
the Burning Bush, where according to
the Bible, God appeared to Moses,
telling him to ascend the mountain
to receive the Ten Commandments.
On the accession of the Emperor
Justinian in 527 A.D. these monks
asked the ruler to build them a mon¬
astery behind whose walls they would
be safe from bandits and other mar¬
auders.
Justinian agreed, and on his orders
the present monastery was built.
With its towers and high walls it was
more like a castle than a home
of monks, but, fearing that even
these walls would not be sufficient
protection, Justinian also sent 200
slaves with their families to defend it
in case of attack. The monastery
gained its name from the fact that
relics of St. Catherine of Alexandria,
found on the Sinai Peninsula, were
brought there and may still be seen
by pilgrims.
Entering the fortress-monastery by
the three successive gates is like

stepping into the past, into a fortified
castle of the Middle Ages. Looking
down from the ramparts and towers
one sees narrow winding alleys which
separate the quarters of the monks.
But this is an almost deserted for¬
tress. Instead of the hundreds of
religious men it once housed, there
are today only a dozen or so monks
who spend their lives in their ce1' or
in the chapels. They follow, as hi ihe
past, the Greek Orthodox rite.
Despite all the sieges and pillaging,
the treasures which have accumulated
there during 14 centuries are consider¬
ed priceless. The walls of the Basilica
are covered with ancient icons of
great artistic value. On each side of
the altar are two reliquaries offer¬
ings to St. Catherine decorated with
precious stones.
One, dating from the 18th century,
was the gift of the Russian Empress,
Catherine the Great. Nearby on a
small table is a golden chalice and a
tiara enhanced by rubies and emer¬
alds. It would require a catalogue of
many pages to enumerate all the
riches that exist here.
Behind the altar is the Chapel of
the Burning Bush. All who enter are
asked to remove their shoes in com¬
memoration of the words God spoke
to Moses: "'Put off thy shoes from
off thy feet, for the place whereon
thou standest is holy ground." Here,
too, the walls are almost completely
covered by icons.
For many years the monks had no
idea of the real value of their posses¬
sions, but since the discovery of the
Codex Sinaiticus, they have watched
over their treasures., jealously. The
Codex Sinaiticus, one of the three or
four oldest texts of the New Testa¬
ment, was discovered in 1844 by the
German biblical critic, Tischendorf,
who visited the monastery library,
hoping to come across some interest¬
ing manuscripts to use in his studies.
In the middle of the room he found a
wastepaper basket full of parchment
sheets due to be burned. Examining
one of them, he recognized it as a
fragment of a very ancient biblical
manuscript, as, he also found, were
the other 129 sheets he rescued from
the same waste basket.
He obtained 43 of the sheets and
impressed on the monks that they
should carefully preserve the rest.
Later the Czar of Russia bought the
manuscript from the monks for the
equivalent of just over £1,000.
In 1933 the Soviet Union sold the
Codex Sinaiticus to the British
Museum for £100,000 said to have
been the highest price ever paid until
then for a book. The monks' regret
at having disposed of the manuscript
some eighty years earlier can easily be
imagined.
Today a new building houses the
library which is the pride of the
monastery. With around 3,500 Byzan¬
tine, Greek, Arab and Russian docu¬
ments it is regarded as the second
most important collection of manu¬
scripts in the world. (The most im¬
portant is in the Vatican.) St. Cather¬
ine's has also a number of gospel
books, some of them bound and others
illuminated with delightful miniatures.
In 1950 a three-man team microfilmed
most of the contents of the St. Cather¬
ine collection for the United States
Library of Congress, taking nearly
2,000,000 photos of the manuscripts
page by page.

TABLETS OF STONE
IN THE WILDERNESS
St. Catherine's Monastery is located on
Mount Sinai, but contrary to popular belief,
this is not a single peak. Rather, it is a
massif and the monastery is on a plateau
almost completely surrounded by higher
mountains. One of these is Jobel Musa
(Mountain of Moses) where Moses is said
to have received the Ten Commandments
on tablets of stone. Photo above shows a view
from atop Mount Moses. The savage beauty
of this rugged, bare landscape is heightened
by the mystery which 'surrounds the silent
rocks. Right, the chapel dedicated to the
prophet Elijah on the path leading to Mount

Moses. When St. Catherine's had hundreds
of monks, some climbed to the chapel to
say mass under the enormous cypress tree
which is several hundred years old. Above

at the monastery... tending their oil-can
gardens on the balconies outside their rooms.

FOUNDER JUSTINIAN AND WIFE-The
striking fresco in central nave (right) shows
Emperor Justinian I who founded monastery in
sixth century, and his wife Theodora. It is
surrounded by delicately carved woodwork
covered with gold. Monastery was once one of the
great centres of Eastern Christianity. Its library
of manuscripts, second only to that of the
Vatican, contains some of the oldest surviving
Christian documents. There are fragmentary
texts identified as having been written as far
back as the fifth century and complete works
from the eighth century on. Library contains
3,500 manuscripts of which 2,500 are in
Greek, 600 in Arabic. Others are written in
Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Coptic and Slavic.

CHAPEL OF THE BURNING BUSH - The

Chapel of the Burning Bush in the St.'Catherine
church is the most sacred ground on the whole
Sinai peninsula. This, it is believed, is the
exact spot where Moses beheld the burning
bush which was not consumed, and heard the
voice of the Lord say: '"Put off thy shoes from
off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground." Today visitors are required to
remove their shoes before setting foot in the
chapel. The walls of the church are covered
with one of the world's richest collections of
ancient Byzantine icons. Other treasures include
silver lamps, chasubles embroidered with gold,
jewel-embedded crosses, Russian chalices, finely
woven altar cloths, and Greek belts of silk.

3,000 STEPS TO MOUNT MOSES A stairway of 3,000 steps, carved from the
rose-coloured granite by monks, leads to the summit of Mount Moses (7,500 feet
high) regarded as the Mt. Sinai of the Scriptures. The stairway runs from
near the monastery, climbing up the mountainside through a narrow, rocky gorge.
