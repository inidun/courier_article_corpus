The granny boom
■
In developing countries the elderly make up a
smaller proportion of the population than they
do in developed regi o n s , but their numbers are
growing much faster than those of the rest of the
p o p u l at i o n . In fa c t , as the World Health
O r g a n i z at i o n ’s 1998 Wo rld Health Report p o i n t s
o u t , “Most of the increase in older populations will
occur in developing countries, which will face the
most serious challenges in providing a ‘ we l fa r e
package’of services for their older people.”
Most low-income developing countries have
hardly begun to face up to the aging of their
p o p u l at i o n s , for reasons which are unders t a n d a b l e .
M a ny countries in tropical A f ri c a , for example, a r e
confronted with urgent problems including rapid
p o p u l ation gr ow t h , high infant and child mort a l i t y,
and excessive rural-urban migration.
Rampant urbanization
According to one study, the size of the older
p o p u l ation in developing countries was expected to
increase by almost 90 per cent between 1980 and
2 0 0 0 , and by over 300 per cent by 2025.1 There are
considerable regional va ri ations in this gr ow t h . I n
A f ri c a , for example, little change in the age stru c t u r e
of the population is expected until 2025. In East A s i a ,
h owe ve r , gr owth will be substantial, while China
stands out as the most rapidly aging society, with a
p o p u l ation structure that by 2025 will be closer to that
of the developed regions than it is today.
U r b a n i z ation has been an essential part of most
c o u n t ri e s ’ d e velopment in recent decades, and in
d e veloped regions there is a disproport i o n at e
r e p r e s e n t ation of older persons in urban areas and
inner subu r b s. In the developing countries the age
s t ructures of urban populations seem to be follow i n g
this trend, but at the same time certain specific
r e gional and national tendencies are apparent. I n



Hard choices for
theThird World Nana Apt*
A f ri c a , for example,older persons are more likely to
l i ve in rural areas than their counterp a rts in other
world regi o n s. In A s i a , there has been a trend towa r d s
u r b a n i z ation of the elderly, although a substantial
m a j o rity still remain in rural areas. It is expected
t h at by 2000 older persons in Latin A m e rica are
more likely to live in urban than rural areas.
Weakened family ties
Economic and social fa c t o rs are bound to have an
a d ve rse impact on the situation of older people duri n g
the process of urbanization and industri a l i z ation that
is currently underway in the developing countri e s.
T h at process gradually weakens traditional fa m i l y
p at t e rns which provide social roles for older pers o n s
and ensure that they play a pivotal role in society
e ven as they advance in age.The crucial question is
whether cultural norms in these countries will remain
strong enough for families to maintain their ties to the
elderly as the dependency burden increases.
The gr owth in the numbers of older people in the
d e veloping world is taking place in a context where
traditional obligations are changi n g, and the domestic
a rrangements of the intergenerational family which
traditionally supported older persons are under threat .
The indicat o rs increasingly reveal a trend away from
the traditional perceptions and practices of obligat i o n s
t owards respect and care for the elderly.
S u p p o rt for the gr owing numbers of older
people will largely depend on informal serv i c e s
provided by their kinsfolk. However, neglect and
i s o l ation of the elderly are surfacing in many A f ri c a n
c o u n t ri e s , for example, where only a relat i vely small
number of people in formal employment are entitled
to social security.
L ow wages and job insecurity make it hard for
younger A f ricans living in cities to support their
elderly kin, just as their counterp a rts in rural areas are
finding it hard to meet the needs of the rural elderly.
In one study on the views of Ghanaian youth on
a gi n g, 81 per cent of those questioned expressed
the opinion that it was no longer feasible for yo u n g
families to live with their elderly relat i ve s.2
Clearly, the domestic separation of the urban
elderly from the traditional structure is a reflexion
of the changing nature of the traditional family in
Africa.There is an evident difference of loyalties
between the newer urbanized conjugal family and

Developing countries beset with a host of
other urgent problems have not yet begun to
cope with the needs of aging populations

the extended traditional family. However,it would
be a mistake to think that this development is simply
the outcome of the adoption of “modern” values
and at t i t u d e s ;i n f r a s t ructural and structural fa c t o rs
are invo l ve d . Urban housing conditions, f o r
e x a m p l e , go a long way to explaining these changes.
In rural Ghana, a c c o m m o d ation can easily be
provided for all social categories. Shortage of land
is not a factor and simple additional dwellings are
c o n s t ructed out of local mat e rials as the need ari s e s.
Urban accommodation on the other hand usually
has to be paid for with cash and landlords often
impose a limit on the number of persons entitled to
inhabit their propert y. These fa c t o rs all bri n g
pressure to bear on fa m i l i e s , especially large fa m i l i e s.
Longevity creates the possibility that household
and kinship structures will contain four or five
generations, whereas previously three generations
was the predominant form . In other wo r d s , t h e
working generation will be called on to take care of
its parents, grandparents and great grandparents.
