                         from art and politics to bioethics, religion, the internet 
       and the odyssey of tea, french philosopher michel onfrey focuses 
       on a multitude of issues that concern contemporary humanity 
  in his numerous books and lectures. for mr onfray, philosophy must be 
                   effective on the existential plane.
Michel onfray  
A philosopher of the enlightenment
You once said that philosophy 
doesn’t fall from the heaven of 
ideas, but rises up from earth. 
Would you explain? 
There is in fact a multitude of ways 
to practice philosophy, but out of 
this multitude, the dominant histori-
ography picks one tradition among 
others and makes it the truth of 
philosophy: that is to say the ide-
alist, spiritualist lineage compat-
ible with the Judeo-Christian world 
view. From that point on, anything 
that crosses this partial – in both 
senses of the word – view of things 
finds itself dismissed. This applies 
to nearly all non-Western philoso-
phies, Oriental wisdom in particu-
lar, but also sensualist, empirical, 
materialist, nominalist, hedonistic 
currents and everything that can be 
put under the heading of “anti-Pla-
tonic philosophy”. Philosophy that 
comes down from the heavens is 
the kind that - from Plato to Levinas 
by way of Kant and Christianity - 
needs a world behind the scenes to 
understand, explain and justify this 
world. The other line of force rises 
from the earth because it is satis-
fied with the given world, which is 
already so much. 
You define yourself as  
a hedonistic philosopher.  
What does this term comprise 
for you? 
Hedonism is one of the philoso-
phies not compatible with Judeo-
Christianity and therefore cast 
aside by the dominant historiog-
raphy. In opposition to the ascetic 
ideal advocated by the dominant 
school of thought, hedonism sug-
gests identifying the highest good 
with your own pleasure and that of 
others; the one must never be in-
dulged at the expense of sacrificing 
the other. Obtaining this balance 
– my pleasure at the same time as 
the pleasure of others – presumes 
that we approach the subject from 
different angles – political, ethical, 
aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, peda-
gogical, historiographical…I have 
written books on each of these fac-
ets of the same world view.
You’ve been attacked virulently 
for your atheistic stance,  
to the point of receiving death 
threats. How do you respond?
I note that believers prove me 
right when I state that monotheism 
is intrinsically intolerant, vindictive 
and intellectually exterminating….
If someone threatens to kill you 
for saying their religion is intoler-
ant, they prove what I’m saying is 
unfortunately true. In Europe, we 
live under democratic regimes; 
elsewhere, in other times and other 
places, there wouldn’t have been 
these threats, I would have had my 
head chopped off directly. 
You are an action philosopher 
who fights on every front.  
How can a philosopher make  
himself “useful” today? 
By radically turning your back on 
the academic, doctoral way of pro-
ceeding, that is to say by avoiding 
speaking in a way that is abstruse, 
fuzzy, incomprehensible, to a few 
fans of sectarian modes of thinking

who get off on sticking together and 
reproducing intellectually through 
incest. Therefore by expressing 
yourself clearly and simply, like 
Seneca or Cicero…And then by 
ceasing to lecture everybody, and 
by being content to remain only in 
the realm of the verb, where things 
are so easy, and yet trying to pro-
duce philosophical effects on the 
existential level – there too like the 
ancient philosophers – in places or-
ganized for that purpose, like for in-
stance in “universités populaires” *. 
  
Can we compare 
the “Université populaire”  
in Caen, which you launched  
in 2002, to the school  
in the Garden of Epicurus? 
I started a second one in 
Argentan, in Normandie (France), 
my home town, which is a sub-pre-
fecture damaged by the harshness 
of the free market, and which is 
habitually ignored by the powers-
that-be in the capital, but also by 
the regional and departmental au-
thorities. What I wondered, in fact, 
was what a micro-resistance to the 
micro-fascisms of our era could be 
like, in an open community inspired 
by an Epicureanism in touch with 
our post-industrial modernity.
For you, nothing is universal. 
Can this idea be identified  
with that of cultural diversity,  
as advocated by UNESCO?
No, some things are universal. I 
believe, for instance, a man is worth 
the same as a woman, a white 
person is worth a black person, 
a doctor of philosophy is worth a 
peasant on the Nile, an atheist is 
worth neither more nor less than 
a devout Jew, a handicapped per-
son is worth a sports champion, 
in other words one being is worth 
another being, whatever they both 
are. That’s the first universal thing 
I believe. 
The second one is that a happy 
human being is better than an un-
happy human being, and every-
thing must be done to increase the 
universal dose of pleasure and re-
duce the dose of pain as much as 
possible. 
Finally, of course I believe in the 
diversity of cultures and the need 
to safeguard them, but I also be-
lieve that some cultures are bet-
ter than others. I do indeed think 
a civilization is more worthwhile 
where little girls are not genitally 
mutilated, rather than one where 
their wholeness is destroyed; a 
civilization in which you can say 
the opposite of what your coun-
try’s spiritual and temporal powers 
think, rather than one where you’re 
sent to the gallows because your 
thinking doesn’t match the norm. I 
believe that a civilization that gives 
homosexuals the same rights as 
heterosexuals is better than one 
that jails them, etc. 
I’m just a philosopher of the Enligh- 
tenment who thinks the Light is 
preferable to the Darkness and 
the Declaration of Human Rights 
superior to legal texts drawn from 
age-old mythologies…
*(like folk high schools or adult  
education centres)

How can philosophy make itself useful ?
The Epicurean Garden.
