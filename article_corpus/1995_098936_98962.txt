SOLVING
THE FOOD/POPULATION
EQUATION
BY LESTER BROWN
Seldom has the world faced an
unfolding emergency whose
dimensions are as clear as the
growing imbalance between food
and people. For our generation, the
challenge is to reverse the deterio¬
rating food situation and achieve a
balance between people and food
that is both humane and sustain¬
able. And this, in turn, depends on
reversing the deteriorating rela¬
tionship between ourselves (cur¬
rently increasing by 90 million per
year) and the natural systems and
resources on which we depend.
It cannot be argued that
resources are not available. Despite
the end of the cold war, the world is
still spending close to $700 billion a
year for military purposes, much of
it designed to deal with threats that
have long since disappeared. Mean¬
while, the United Nations Popula¬
tion Fund (UNFPA), the lead agency
in the effort to stabilize world pop¬
ulation, has an annual budget of
$240 million.

STABILIZING WORLD POPULATION
Elements ofa global food and pop¬
ulation strategy are, however, begin¬
ning to emerge. In April 1994,
UNFPA sketched the outlines of a
bold effort to stabilize world popu¬
lation at 7.8 billion by the year 2050.
This plan is a broad-based one that
includes family planning, raising
the level of female education and
pressing for equal rights for women
in all societies.
Implementing the proposed
UNFPA Programme of Action
requires an estimated $11.4 billion
for 1996, gradually rising to $14.4
billion by2005. Of this total, roughly
two-thirds is to be mobilized within
developing countries themselves.
The complementary resource flows
from donor countries would
increase to $4.4 billion (1993 dol
lars) in 2000, rising further to $4.8
billion in 2005.
Achieving the UNFPA's fertility
reduction goals requires substan¬
tial increases in female education.
Although the education ofgirls and
women contributes simultaneously
to economic progress and lower fer¬
tility, in many countries, fewer than
half the girls ofprimary-school age
are in class. Almost all governments
have adopted universal primary
education as a goal, but many have
seen their educational system over¬
whelmed by the sheer number of
children entering school. The gov¬
ernments ofhigh-fertility societies
cannot realistically hope to rein in
population growth without broad¬
ening access to education and thus
providing women with options
beyond childbearing.
Fulfilling this social condition
for a more rapid fertility decline will
require a heavy investment in both
school building and teacher
training. Providing elementary edu¬
cation for the estimated 130 mil¬
lion school-age children not now
in school (70 per cent ofwhom are
female) would cost roughly $6.5 bil¬
lion per year. Providing literacy
training for those men and women
who are illiterate and beyond school
age would require an additional
estimated $4 billion per year.

MASSIVE REFORESTATION
On the food side of the equation,
major efforts must be made to pro¬
tect the soil- and water-resource base
and increase investment in agricul¬
tural research. At the root of food
scarcity in many developing coun¬
tries is the loss of vegetation from
deforestation, overgrazing and over-
ploughing. As vegetation is
destroyed, rainfall runoff increases,
reducing aquifer recharge, increasing
soil erosion and, in turn, lowering
the inherent productivity of the
ecosystem.
Where firewood is scarce, crop
residues are burned for cooking
fuel, thus depriving the soil of
needed organic matter. Adding trees
to the global forest stock is a valu¬
able investment in our economic
future, whether the goal is to sat¬
isfy the growing firewood needs in
the Third World or to stabilize soil
and water regimes. Accordingly, we
propose as part of a global food
security budget a massive refor¬
estation plan totalling $5.6 billion
a year by the end of the decade.
More than a billion people live in
countries that are already experi¬
encing firewood shortages. Unless
corrective action is taken, that
number will nearly double by the
year 2000. An estimated 55 million
hectares of tree planting will have to
be done to meet the fuelwood
demand expected then. In addition,
anchoring soils and restoring hydro-
logical stability in thousands of
Third World watersheds will require
tree planting on some 100 million
hectares.
SOIL CONSERVATION
Planting trees to restore watersheds,
thereby conserving soil and water,
complements the expenditures on
soil conservation by farmers. To cal¬
culate the cost of a global effort to
stabilize soils, data are used from
the United States, where it is esti¬
mated that roughly $3 billion a year
would be necessary to stabilize soils
on U.S. cropland.
First, it is assumed that one tenth
of the world's cropland cannot sus¬
tain cultivation with any economi¬
cally feasible soil-conserving agri¬
cultural practices roughly the same
proportion as in the United States.
This would equal some 128 million
hectares wordwide. Applying the cost
ofconverting such land to grassland
or woodland in the United States, at
$125 per hectare as a first approxi¬
mation, the global costwould be $16
billion per year. If expenditures to
conserve topsoil on the remaining
erosion-prone cropland another
100 million hectares are compa¬
rable to these, a global programme of
conservation practices enacted by
2000 would cost an additional $8 bil¬
lion annually.
By 2000, when both the crop¬
land conversion programme and
the full range of soil- conserving
practices are in place, global expen¬
ditures to protect the cropland base
would total some $24 billion per
year. Although this is obviously a
large sum, it is less than the U.S.
government has paid farmers to
support crop prices in some years.
As a down-payment on future food
supplies for a world expecting at
least two billion more people, $24
billion is an investment humanity
can ill afford not to make.
At a time when the backlog of
yield-raising technologies is
shrinking, international expendi¬
tures on agricultural research are
diminishing. The urgency of
reversing this trend is obvious. A
remarkably successful international
network of seventeen agricultural
research institutes identifies gaps in
global agricultural research and sys¬
tematically fills them. Despite its
widely recognized success, funding

time when every technological
advance, however small, is needed to
help buy time to slow population
growth, investment in these centres
should be rising, not falling.
FOOD SECURITY AND POLITICAL
STABILITY
In summary, the food security
budget we propose, including
needed expenditures on both sides
of the food/population equation,
would start at $24 billion in 1996,
increasing rapidly to just over $58
billion in the year 2000 and then
grow much more slowly, reaching
$61 billion by 2005. Athough the
budgetwe propose is described as a
food security budget, it is also a
political stability budget an
investment in an environmentally
sustainable, politically stable future.
Aside from the global food secu¬
rity budget, which involves public
expenditures, there are several
needs that are best satisfied by
reforming economic policies,
specifically those that deal with
water efficiency and global
warming. With water becoming
increasingly scarce, future gains in
irrigation depend heavily on the
more efficient use of irrigation
water. The key to this is to remove
the subsidies that provide farmers
with free water or water at a nom¬
inal cost. Only if farmers pay market
costs for water will they make the
needed investments in irrigation
efficiency.
In a related area, much progress
has been made in recent years in
reducing fertilizer subsidies, a prac¬
tice that often led to excessive fer¬
tilizer use and damaging levels of
nutrient runoff into rivers and lakes.
The other area needing major
reform is the tax system, which
should be restructured so that those
who burn fossil fuels pay the full
costs of their use. As it now stands, a
utility company that bums coal pays
only for the costs associated with
extracting and burning it, while
others are left to bear the indirect
costs of air pollution health-care
costs, crop losses and the damage
from acid rain to forests and fresh¬
water lakes. The motorist driving
down the road never pays for the
crop damage in the adjoining fields
caused by pollution from the auto¬
mobile.
Similarly, those who burn fossil
fuels are not paying the costs of
global warming and overall climate
instability. Accordingly we recom¬
mend a restructuring of the tax
system to partially replace income
taxes with taxes on fossil fuels. This
would help offset the inability of
the market to fully incorporate
costs, steering the evolution of the
global energy economy in an envi¬
ronmentally sustainable direction.
