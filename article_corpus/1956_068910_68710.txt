BOROBUDUR Sr^'
From India, Buddhism spread in the first
century to almost every part of Asia. Wherever
it took root, it brought artistic inspiration and
stimulated much of the greatest art that Asia
has known. One of the most noble monu¬
ments of Buddhist art is the gigantic sanctuary
raised from 750 A.D. onwards at Borobudur
on the island of Java. Details, shown here,
from one of Borobudur's hundreds of bas
reliefs, relateoneofthe "avadanas" the Buddhist
legends of saintly deeds. According to this
particular legend there existed in the time of
Buddha a realm called Roruka ruled by a
Buddhist king named Rudrayana. One day '
a tremendous sand storm buried the kingdom,
but the king's minister, Hiru, managed to
save its treasures and escaped by sea.
After a long and perilous voyage, he finally
reached a friendly land and founded agreat city.

of the career of the Bodhisattva in the realms
of the mystic Buddhas. The three miles of
carvings are arranged in such a way that by
following the rite of pradaksina (walking round
them and always turning with the right shoul¬

of the Buddha. Crowning Borobudur, a
