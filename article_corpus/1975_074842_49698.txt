THE EARTH'S
INVISIBLE
GARBAGE MEN
by Albert Sasson
ICRO-ORGANISMS cause vari-
1 ous forms of pollution (by
proliferating in water and industrial
wastes, by corroding stone and thus
damaging buildings, or by contaminat¬
ing food) bur they are indispensable
for getting rid of solid organic wastes
or those suspended in water.
The . purification and recycling of
waste waters is indeed the most
important operation of industrial micro¬
biology, not only for reasons of hygiene
but also to enable us to use water
economically.
The biological purification process
begins after the liquid waste has been
settled and when the sludge is fed
into a digestion tank, where it under¬
goes fermentation, producing methane
which is mixed with town gas, thus
increasing the heating power of the gas.
The product of this process, digested
sludge, contains many nutrients and
for this reason it is often added to
household refuse to enrich the compost
which results from the decomposition
of such refuse.
In several countries active research
is being pursued on the growth of
certain species of single-cell algae in
waste water. The Japanese, for
instance, have built a plant in which
algae absorb the carbon dioxide in
dirty water, thus producing 9,087 litres
of clean water and 27 kg. of algae
daily. The algae are concentrated and
added to animal feed. Similar experi¬
ments have been carried out in

Household refuse and the digested
sludge obtained from sewage can be
fermented in special factories which
produce composts rich in bio-de-
gradable organic matter, providing not
only an excellent natural fertilizer but
also improving the physical properties
of the soil.
In European countries, an average
of between 650 grammes and a kilo
of rubbish per inhabitant is produced
each day. The corresponding figure
in urban areas of sub-tropical Brazil is
600 grammes and in Rabat (Morocco),
an estimated 500 grammes. In small
towns and villages in the tropics and
sub-tropics, it is much less (about
250 grammes daily).
When such refuse is fresh, each
gramme contains millions of microbes.
Pathogenic microbes and parasites
are killed off in the various stages of
decomposition, leaving a compost
containing antibiotic substances and
microbes which are not antagonistic
to those already existing in the soil.
The processing and composting of
such household refuse produces
roughly 40 to 50 kg. of compost for
each 100 kg. of refuse.
Added to the soil in varying doses
(20 to 40 metric tons per hectare) the
compost has a marked effect on its
physical properties. Incorporated with
sandy soils, it increases their capacity
to retain. water and fertilizers and thus
improves crop yields (by 15 to 20 per
cent in the case of citrus fruit trees).
It also increases the permeability of
heavy soils, preventing them from
turning to mud in rainy weather, and
considerably reduces erosion on hill
slopes.
A town of 100,000 to 150,000 in¬
habitants may produce 50 to 100 tons
of untreated refuse, and hence 17 to
25 tons of compost daily.
High-grade ores of copper, nickel,
chrome, tin and molybdenum are
becoming increasingly hard to find,
and it is not an economic proposition
to process low-grade ores in the same
way as high- and middle-grade ones.
Certain microbes can, however, be
used in the extraction of these metals
after the ores have been dissolved
in water or sulphuric acid.
Sulphides, to take a well-known
example, are often leached from the
soil by natural means and furnish
metal-rich solutions. Copper was
being extracted from water in this way
in the Isle of Anglesey (Wales) as
early as the 16th century and from
water which had drained off the land
in the Rio Tinto area of south-west
Spain some 300 years ago.
It was also in the Rio Tinto region
that a bacterium similar to Thiobacillus
ferroxldans was isolated some years
ago. The same species had been
discovered in the course of studies
carried out in the coal mines of
Pennsylvania: the high acidity of the
mining effluents was killing off veg¬
etation in the neighbourhood and it
was during investigation of the nature
of the process responsible that the
bacterium was isolated from the
solvent used for leaching the pyrites
contained in the coal.
An identical microbe was sub¬
sequently isolated from the copper-
rich water in Bingham Canyon, Utah
(site of the largest open-cut copper
mine in North America). Laboratory
research showed that sulphurated ores
containing at least eight metals can
be attacked by this micro-organism.
Some idea of the importance of this
process of microbial leaching can be
gained from the fact that in 1966 the
copper mines of the United States W
29


u
produced 370,000,000 metric
tons of mine waste containing small
quantities of metal. In 1965, ten per
cent of the country's copper output
was extracted by means of microbial
treatment from these wastes.
The copper thus recovered is esti¬
mated to have cost $1,000 per ton
against a world market price of $1 ,400.
On this reckoning, if 50 per cent of
the copper contained in a million tons
of mine waste of 0.3 per cent metal
content could be recovered, the
operation would make a profit of
$600,000.
Microbial leaching is thus seen to
be an economically viable process, and
Is in fact practised in ten countries,
including Mexico, U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.,
where at least eleven mines are using it.
Thlobacilli and also iron bacteria
can also be used in the extraction of
uranium from certain ores such as
brannerite. The uranium dissolves as
uranyl sulphate, from which it can be
extracted by various methods.
By 1985, when it is expected that
world demand for uranium will have
increased ten-fold, extraction by means
of biological leaching should be a fully
economic proposition.
At Stanrock, In Canada, for example,
seven and a half tons of uranium oxide
are extracted every month simply by
spraying the walls of the underground
galleries, where the microbes are
already at work. The solution is
pumped up to the surface without the
miners having to handle and shift vast
quantities of ore of little value, as must
be. done in the case of more conven¬
tional extraction techniques.
Sweden possesses large deposits of
shales which contain uranium in small
quantities. With the indirect help of
bacteria, it would certainly be possible
to concentrate the uranium; the cost
should not be exorbitant in view of the
fact that one ton of uranium is worth
more than $16,000.
Using heterotrophic bacteria, which
require organic substances as food, it
has been possible to dissolve out the
gold contained in some latente
deposits of West Africa. An organic
compound produced by the bacteria,
and soluble in butanol, apparently
combines with the gold.
At the Irkutsk Institute of Rare
Metals, Soviet scientists studying bio-
metallurgical processes for dissolving
and precipitating gold report that
within 20 Hours 30 per cent of the gold
Is dissolved out of the ore.
In the case of manganese, the ores
generally used are oxides, manganite
and pyrolusite. Oxidation, which can
be either a chemical or a biochemical
process, is in this instance effected by
two classes of iron bacteria. Leaching
carried out when an advanced state of
corrosion has been reached makes it
possible to extract manganese from
low-grade ores.
The use of micro-organisms to
extract certain metals has a number
of advantages: little or no energy Is
required, relatively little investment is
involved, and the reagents employed
are very cheap. On the other hand,
it is a slow technique and in order to
be profitable has to be used in con¬
junction with or as a follow-up to nor¬
mal methods.
Lastly, it should be pointed out that
this aspect of applied microbiology
calls for co-operative research in
geology, mineralogy, biochemistry and
microbiology and in various, branches
of the mining industry.
