Rituals & symbols
of Time reborn
by Mircea Eliade
Primitive peoples divided time
into periods such as heat and
cold, drought and rain, sow¬
ing and harvest, but at a very
early stage of history these divi¬
sions led to the idea of a temporal
cycle and hence to the concept of
the "year". The beginning of the
year varied from country to
country and from epoch to epoch,
calendar reforms being constantly
introduced to make the ritual
meaning of festivals fit the seas¬
ons with which they were suppos¬
ed to correspond.
In most primitive societies the
"New Year" is equivalent to the
raising of the taboo on the new
harvest which is thus proclaimed
edible for the whole community.
This means that the "divisions of
time" are determined by the rituals
governing the renewal of food re¬
serves, that is, the rituals that
guarantee the continued existence
of the whole community. The
adoption of the solar year as the
unit of time is of Egyptian origin.
The majority of other historical
cultures (and Egypt itself down to
a certain period) had a year, both
lunar and solar, of 360 days (that
is, 12 months of 30 days each), to
which five extra days (called the
intercalary days) were added.
However, neither the instability
and latitude in the beginning of
the New Year, nor the varying
lengths attributed by different peo¬
ples, were able to lessen the impor¬
tance attached by all nations to
the end of one period of time and
the beginning of another. This
conception of the end and the be¬
ginning of a temporal period based
on the observation of biocosmic
rhythms, formed part of a larger
system the system of periodic
regeneration of life, presupposing
a new Creation, or symbolic repe¬
tition of the cosmos.
A scapegoat for sin
The end of the year was mark¬
ed by a number of rituals:
fasting, collective ablutions
and purification; extinguishing
the fire and ritually rekindling it.

nial; the expulsion of "demons"
by means of noises, cries, blows,

Dr. MIRCEA ELIADE is Rumanian by birth,
and now resides in France. He is the author
of a history of religions, and other works on
Shamanism, Yoga, and Primitive symbolism.

(the "scapegoat" of the Israelites)
or of a man (Mamurius Veturius,
in Rome), regarded as the material
vehicle through which the sins of
the community were removed
beyond its boundaries. There were
often ceremonial combats between
two groups of actors, or collective
orgies, or processions of masked
men (representing the souls of the
ancestors, or the gods).
In many places the belief still
survives that at the year's end the
souls of the dead return to earth
and visit the living. The spirits
lavish honours upon them for seve¬
ral days, after which they are led
in procession to the outskirts of
the village, or are driven from it.
It is at the same period that the
initiation ceremonies for young
men are performed.
From chaos to cosmos
Naturally, we seldom find all
of these elements grouped
together on a equal footing
In certain societies the ceremonies
of extinguishing and re-kindling
the fire predominate; in others it
is the expulsion of demons and
diseases or the expulsion of the
"scapegoat" in animal or human
form. But the meaning of the
whole ceremony, like that of its
constituent elements is sufficient¬
ly clear with the division of time
into units or "years" we witness
not only the definite conclusion of
an interval of time and the be¬
ginning of another, but also the
complete wiping away of the pre¬
vious year and of past time.
This is also the meaning of puri¬
fication rituals to burn away and
annul the sins and errors of the
individual and of the whole com¬
munity not a mere "purifying".
Regeneration, as its name indi¬
cates, is a new birth. The annual
expulsion of sins, diseases and de¬
mons is basically an attempt to
restore "pure", primordial Time
in other words, the "instant" of
Creation. Every New Year is a
resumption of time from .the be¬
ginning, that is, a repetition of the
origin of the universe. The ritual
combats between two groups of
actors, the return of the dead, the
Saturnalia and the orgies, are so
many elements which denote that
at the end of one year and in ex¬
pectation of the New Year there
is a repetition of the mythical
moment of the passage from chaos
to cosmos.
The ceremonial for the Babylo¬
nian New Year, the
akitu, is sufficiently (Cont'd on

pect, and can be traced back to the
farthest antiquity. Its ideology and
ritual structure existed as early as the
Sumerian period, and the system of
the akitu has been identified from Ak¬
kadian times in the Bronze Age. We
are thus dealing -with documents of the
most ancient civilization known to his¬
tory, in which the sovereign played a
considerable role. He was regarded as
the son and representative of the divi¬
nity on earth and as such was responsi¬
ble for the regularity of the rhythms
of nature and for the welfare of the
entire society. Hence it is not surpris¬
ing to find that the King was a promi¬
nent figure in the ceremonial of the
New Year. Upon him fell the duty of
ensuring the "rebirth" of time.
In the course of the akitu ceremony,
which lasted twelve days, the so-called
Epic of the Creation, Enume elish, was
solemnly recited. This ritual was really
a re-enactment of the combat between
the god Marduk and the sea monster
Tiamat a fabulous battle which had
taken place "before the beginning of
years" and which had put an end to
chaos by the final victory of the god.
Marduk had created the universe from
fragments of the torn body of Tiamat,
and created man from the blood of the
demon Kingu (Tiamat's most powerful
ally). That this commemoration was
in effect a re-enactment or re-actuali¬
zation of the Creation is proved both by
the rituals and by the formulas recited
during the ceremony.
The combat between Tiamat and
Marduk was mimed by a struggle bet¬
ween two groups of actors. The cere¬
monial was also a feature of the New
Year dramatic celebrations among the
Hittites, in Egypt, and at Ras Shamra.
(Continuée/ from page 7)
But this struggle was more than a com¬
memoration of the original duel bet¬
ween Marduk and Tiamat; it was, a
contemporary version of the Creation.
Within the frame of the same akitu
ceremonial was sakmuk, "the festival of
the Fates", in which omens for each of
the twelve months in the year were
determined. These were equivalent to
creating the twelve months to come.
Marduk's descent into Hell was marked
by a period of mourning and fasting for
the whole community and of "humilia¬
tion" for the king, a ritual which form¬
ed part of a vast carnival system. It
was at this time, too, that the expulsion
of sins took place by means of a scape¬
goat. The cycle was closed with the
sacred marriage between the god and
the goddess Sparpanîtû.
Slaves become the masters
We thus see that the Babylonian
New Year festival consisted
of a series of rites, purporting
to abolish past time, restore primordial
chaos and re-enact the creation of the
universe: (1) The first act represented
the domination of Tiamat and thus
signified a return to the mythical
period before the Creation. This
included the enthronement of a
"Carnival King", the "humiliation"
of the real sovereign and the complete
reversal of the social order - (the
slaves became the masters and vice
versa). Every feature suggests univer¬
sal confusion, the abolition of order
and hierarchy, "orgy" and chaos. (2)
The creation of the world, which had
taken place in mythical times, was thus
re-enacted every year. (3) Man parti-
Rosh Ha'Shanah to the sound of the rani's horn
The Jewish New Year, Rosh
Ha'Shanah, marks the birth
of the world which, according
to Jewish tradition, took place on
the first of Tishri (September-
October) 5716 years ago. The fes¬
tival is observed for two days and
during the synagogue service the
Shofar (ram's horn) is sounded to
arouse Jews to duty and responsi¬
bility on the first day of the new
year. The Shofar must be a ram's
horn and not the horn of calf or
cow as this would be a reminder of
the Israelites dancing in worship
around the Golden Calf. Accord¬
ing to the Hebrew prophets, the
sound of the Shofar will also usher
in the Messianic era when the im¬
mortal dead will arise from their
long slumber for judgment and
eternal life.
Jewish families gather together
for a meal following the evening
service in the synagogue. The
master of the household recites the
benediction over a sparkling goblet
of wine symbol of joy from
which all members of the family
then sip. The meal is begun with
slices of apple dipped in honey,
accompanied by a New Year
prayer. All other food eaten at
this meal is sweet and no sour or
pickled foods are permitted as
being incongruous and out of har¬
mony with the nature of the festi¬
val.
On New Year's Day pious Jews
wend their way to a stream of
flowing water. Here, they will
recite prayers by the water's edge,
cast in some bread crumbs and
petition divine pardon for their
past sins. The water symbolizes
purity and the bread crumbs "the
leaven in the dough" being the
Rabbinic description of the proud
and sinful heart.
Rosh Ha'Shanah is, with Yom
Kippur, one of the high holy days
of the year. Both are religious in
character, celebrated in a serious
spirit and are known as the "Days
of Awe". The sanctity . of Rosh
Ha'Shanah is felt most at the
morning services in the syna¬
gogues, where the prayers, the
Shofar, the readings from the
Torah and the Rabbi's sermon all
underline the significance of the
day.
cipated directly, though in a limited
way, in this cosmic process (struggle
between the two groups of actors re¬
presenting Marduk and Tiamat). (4)
The "festival of the Fates" was a fur¬
ther symbol of the creation, since it
decided the "Fate" of each month. (5)
The ritual marriage represented the
"rebirth" of the world and of mankind.
The symbolic repetition of the Crea¬
tion as part of the New Year festival
has been preserved to this day among
the Mandaeans of Irak and Iran. The
Persian Tatars still begin the New Year
by planting seeds in a jar full of earth;
this, they say, is done in memory of
the Creation. This custom is in keep¬
ing with the general Persian system,
as Nawrôz (the Persian New Year)
commemorates the day on which the
world and man were created. The
"renewal of the creation" takes place
on the day of Nawrôz, says the Arab
historian, Albîrunî. "This is a new day
of a new month of a new year", the
King would proclaim, "what time has
consumed must be renewed."
It was also the day on which men's
"destiny" was fixed for the whole year.
Innumerable fires and lights were
kindled on the night of Nawrôz, and
libations were made to ensure plenti¬
ful rainfall during the coming year. It
was also the custom for everyone to
sow seven .kinds of seed in a jar and
"from their growth, they drew conclu¬
sions regarding the nature of the year's
harvest". This custom was similar to
the "fixing of Fates" which marked the
Babylonian New Year, and has survi¬
ved to the present day in the New
Year ceremonies of the Mandaeans and
Yezids in Asia Minor.
The twelve days between Christmas
and the Epiphany are likewise still
regarded as a forecast of the next
twelve months. Peasants in Europe
foretell the weather and rainfall for
each month on the basis of the con¬
ditions prevailing during those twelve
days. The Indians of the Vedic period
considered that the twelve middle days
of winter constituted an image and
replica of the whole year.
Twelve days of the Fates
Almost all Indo-European peoples
possessed, from the very ' earliest
times, ritual dramatizations of
New Year myths which bear a certain
resemblance to the ancient systems
found in the Near East. But simi¬
lar dramatizations can be traced
in China, in Japan, among certain
North American tribes, and others.
The dead return among the living; fire
is put out and rekindled; boys are ini¬
tiated; there is a procession of carnival
masks; ritual battles take place bet¬
ween rival groups; there is a burst of
eroticism (the pursuit of virgins, mar¬
riage by rape, orgies) ; the twelve
months to come are forecast from the
"fate" of the twelve days.
Thus, each of these rituals has its
particular significance, and all contri¬
bute to building up a system whose
aspects include the abolition of the past
and a return to "chaos" (darkness, de¬
bauchery, abolition of rank, etc.), fol¬
lowed by a new creation, that is by a
repetition of the cosmogeny. The New
Year expresses man's deep-rooted
longing for regeneration by regene¬
rating Time and the Universe as a
whole to begin a new life in a new
Creation in other words, to be purged
of one's sins and forget one's failures.
