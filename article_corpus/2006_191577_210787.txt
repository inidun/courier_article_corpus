Issues
great epics – heroic tales 
of man and superman
september 1989 
Whether composed by unknown poets, or 
transmitted orally and reshaped from century 
to century, epics relate to the birth of a culture, 
an empire, or indeed the universe, maintained 
in the national memory of one generation 
to the next. The epic has thus survived 
the vicissitudes of history. 
theatre of the world 
april 1983 
From African rituals to the kabuki of Japan, 
world theatre covers an immense canvas, 
the “concentrated expression” of a culture. 
It draws on popular myths and customs, 
historic ways of life and experiences, 
and assimilates all forms of art, human 
expression and communication. 
music of the centuries
June 1973 
Music is associated with life itself and with  
human society. Even in the early stages  
of every culture, sung recitation is a vehicle  
for historical narrative and the teaching  
of philosophical and moral concepts.  
This issue examines the place of traditional 
music in the world of today.
