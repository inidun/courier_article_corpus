DEFEATING
DECIBELS

Traffic and

major causes
of noise
pollution in
cities. Right,

1 hat is a drop of water? It's
the best way of demon¬
strating how noise is
transmitted. When a water
drop hits the surface of a
pond, it causes waves that spread
outward in concentric circles, just
as sound waves move through the
air. Moreover when the drop strikes
a resonant surface, it produces a
noise that may seem like torture
even if the impact is very mild. It is
not so much the intensity of noise
that makes it unbearable as its
repetitive nature, the attention we
give it and the impossibility of con¬
trolling it. Noise is becoming a
threat to human health, and as
such, ranks among the foremost
environmental problems in the
industrially developed countries
that are member States of the Orga¬
nization of Economic Co-opera¬
tion and Development (OECD).
"People consider noise to be the
main local environmental
problem, sometimes even more
important than air pollution or the
quality of drinking water," says an
OECD study, The State ofthe Envi¬
ronment, published in 1991.
Although they suffer just as much
from noise, the inhabitants of
developing countries don't talk
much about it, largely because it
is overshadowed by the demands of
the struggle for survival.
Noise is a blend of sounds. Its
frequency, i.e. the number of vibra¬
tions per second, is calibrated in
hertz. The human being perceives
sounds between 20 and 20,000 Hz,
while elephants are sensitive to
infra-sounds (less than 20 Hz) and
bats and dolphins, though virtu¬
ally blind, move about thanks to
ultra-sounds that they emit at
greater than 20,000 Hz. We experi¬
ence the sound level, expressed in
decibels (dB), as pressure on our
21

ears. With the audible threshold
being zero dB, 85 is the risk level, 90
dB the danger level and 120 dB the
pain threshold. Beyond that the
ear-drum may rupture.
NOISES THAT HURT
It is therefore easy to understand
that too much noise can damage
our ears. What is more surprising is
that our health is affected in other
ways too. There are immediate
effects, i.e. cardio-vascular prob¬
lems with an accelerated heartbeat
and high blood pressure, gastric-
intestinal problems, a decrease in
alertness and ability to memorize,
nervousness, pupil dilation and a
decrease in the visual field. These
effects may be temporary; others
are longer lasting, e.g., insomnia,
nervousness, bulimia, chronically
high blood pressure, anxiety,
depression and even sexual mal¬
functions!
Discomfort may arise from even
very low noise levels. A couple, for
example, lives in a small town. Next
door there is a cock that crows at
dawn. The wife doesn't mind, but
her husband can't stand it. He
wakes up early and waits for the
cock to crow; when it does, he flies
into a rage. This happens every
morning until, rather than wring
the bird's neck, the couple moves
away. Another example. A sixty-
year-old widow lives alone. A
young couple moves into a semi¬
detached house next door that
they've just built. The noise of their
love-making enrages the widow,
and she lodges a complaint. An
expert measures the disturbance
caused and notes that there is no
possible effective sound insulation.
The judge orders the young lovers'
house to be pulled down; it is not in
conformity with the legal norms
of the building code.
Noise is a psychological fact. It
contains an emotional element. In
a manual entitled Noise and Its
Effects on Health the French Min¬
istry of Social Affairs emphasizes
that "active, ambitious people with
a sense of responsibility seem less

bothered by noise than introverted
people". It adds, "Certain groups
are more sensitive to noise or are
apt to be made more sensitive to it
by specific factors: those prone to
depression, hypochondria and
anxiety or who are going through a
difficult experience such as a
divorce, unemployment or rela¬
tional problems."
On the other hand deafness is
the most indisputable effect of
noise on people. An explosion of
140 dB can cause permanent deaf¬
ness, for it destroys certain cells in
the inner ear that do not regen¬
erate. Permanent deafness can also
occur gradually as a result of expo¬
sure to 85 dB sound-levels over sev¬
eral years. This level is not con¬
fined to factories where
occupational medicine, at least in
the rich countries, is trying to
reduce noise levels. A rock concert
emits as many decibels as a work¬
shop for testing jet-engines. The
noise-prevention brigade of Lau¬
sanne's city police department in
Switzerland received permission
to order the lowering ofnoise levels
at a concert given by the singer
Michael lackson, after posting the
following notice to spectators,
"Bring ear-plugs or cotton".
Moreover, the craze for the
Walkman has been held respon¬
sible for serious hearing problems
among the young. Germany has
calculated that noise-related health
costs and payments made for
hearing loss amount to nearly 4
billion dollars annually!
INCREASING SOUND POLLUTION
More than a third of the 400 million
inhabitants of the OECD countries
are exposed to a daily dose of 65
dB, an unacceptably high level; 200
million live in an uncomfortable
sound environment. The foremost
culprit is road traffic. Between 1970
and 1988 inlapan, for example, the
motorway network was extended
by 510 per cent, while the number
of motor vehicles increased by 200
per cent and total traffic grew by
126 per cent. Aircraft are guilty too.
They constitute a nuisance for 2
per cent of the population in the
United States, i.e. 5 million people,
four times more than in Europe or
lapan.
Trains disturb a smaller per¬
centage of people, usually depen-

ding on their frequency, the density
of the rail network and local topog¬
raphy. Factories, workshops and
building sites, though increasingly
well monitored, are no less a dis¬
turbance for a fair amount of the
population, not to mention for the
workers themselves. Among the
sources of neighbourhood noise
problems the cause of countless
complaints and court cases are
stereo systems and household
appliances, joint-housing equip¬
ment and barking dogs.
What can be done about rapidly
growing sound pollution? Australia
is the champion for noise reduc¬
tion. Some of its states require a
"noise" label for chainsaws, lawn-
mowers and pavement breakers.
When the police in the southern
city of Adelaide spot an unsafe or
noisy car on their roads, they pre¬
sent the owner with a "defect
notice". The car's registration is sus¬
pended until it has been repaired in
an authorized garage. In New
South Wales noisy vehicles can be
stopped and tested by the side of
the road. The excellent results thus
obtained are derived from close
co-operation between the police
and environmental officials.
However, Switzerland is the only
country with legislation designed
to ensure that the best possible
technology for reducing noise is
always used. It requires construc¬
tors, for example, to encapsulate
already low-noise-producing truck
engines. The costs are covered by
the users. Moreover, the Swiss
Society of Engineers and Architects
has defined the required norms for
sound-proofing building interiors:
stairwells, lifts and heating and
ventilation systems.
A NEW CHAPTER
IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
In Switzerland, as in France, Aus¬
tralia and lapan, the authorities are
trying to promote the notion of
"quiet" communities with reduced
levels of industrial, traffic and
domestic noise. In Australia big
campaigns against noise, featuring
posters proclaiming, "Be neigh¬
bourly, it feels nice" or "A quiet day",
have a real impact on the popula¬
tion. In Switzerland the picture of a
black cat on wheels encourages
people to drive quietly. Unfortu¬
nately new problems are arising
more and more urgently in the
OECD countries, i.e. rapid increases
in motor traffic, especially planes
and trucks, increases in evening,
night-time and weekend noise
levels in rural areas, and a prolif¬
eration of motorized pleasure craft,
Walkmen and ghetto blasters.
The history of sound is linked
to the history of humanity. "The
acquisition of language," writes
sound engineer Denis Fortier, "then
of chanting and music, has taken
thousands of years of patient
learning, the time required for the
brain to learn oral and auditory
communication." The Greek
philosopher Pythagoras believed
that music enabled man to harmo¬
nize with the cosmos, which, long
before the theory of the Big Bang
was formulated, ancient India
believed was born from sound.
Sound is vital for communicating,
but when it becomes noise and a
nuisance, it can also kill communi¬
cation. From now on the fight
against noise must be a part of any
environmental policy.
