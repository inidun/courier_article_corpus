Steven Weinberg*: Towards a final theory
“I’m reasonably sure that we will have a final theory from which all the
regularities in nature can be deduced, but I am also reasonably sure that
the final theory will leave us with a mystery: why isn’t the theory
something else, such as a theory with nothing at all, or a theory with just
two particles endlessly in orbit around each other. The best we can hope to
do is discover a theory that is logically fragile, in the sense that any small
change in the theory would lead to logical contradictions.
On a more mundane level, there are limits to science that are not so
fundamental but as a practical matter we will probably not be able to
transcend. For example, the final theory may very well be something like
string theory, but I cannot conceive of how we will ever directly produce
structures that are 17 powers of ten smaller than those probed in the
laboratory today. Likewise there’s a wide class of cosmological theories in
which our big bang is one of many that go off all over the universe, though
in principle we will never observe the others. In both cases the theory will
be successful or not depending on whether its predictions for things we
can observe are correct.
As for religion,whatever reasons it provides still raise the question of why:
why should there be deities with certain characteristics? In fact the more
you learn of physics, the less you see of what may be regarded as
purpose.”
