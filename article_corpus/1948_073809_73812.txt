opinion the world's institutions of
higher learning had not yet learn-
ed how to form the citizens of a
world community. He called on
universities to grasp the leader-
ship which can give the world an
understanding of interdependence
of nations and a One-World way
of living.
Str2ssing the importance of the :
conference, he pointed out its
purpose as that of promoting in-
ternational understanding through
providing an opportunity 01 repre-
sentatives of universities through-
out the world to discuss their
common problems and to arrive
at common solutions.
Mr. Laves emphasized that such
discussions would be useless unless
they were practical enough to en-
compass the realities of the pre-
sent-day world."Research atone",
he said,"is not enough. Positive
steps are required... to ensure that
understanding is made widespread
and that the necessary trained
leadership is available to conduct
the affairs of this one world".

Dr. Clarence E. Beeby, Assistant
Director-General of Unesco, then
spoke on the"Purpose and Scope
of the Conference"in which he
called on the delegates to assume
the leading role rather than have
Unesco as the most active parti-
cipant.
University problems throughout
the world, Dr. Beeby declared,
were very similar. The universities
of today are overcrowded, lack
trained personnel and equipment
and. more important, sufficient
funds are not made available by
governments.
Regarding the scope of the con-
ference, Dr. Beeby pointed out
five main fields of study which
would be covered : the changing
role of the university, better aca-
demic standards, the financing 01
