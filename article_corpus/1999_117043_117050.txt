For almost half a century eugenics—literally the
science of “ i m p r ov i n g ” the gene pool—has
been equated with the horr o rs of Nazism.
While German geneticists such as Benno Müller
Hill have sought to confront the scientific commu-
n i t y ’s complicity with the Nazis, s y s t e m atic scru t i ny
of eugenic policies in other countries has long been
neglected.
H i s t o rians have recently filled the gap to offer a
c l e a r , if depressing, picture of cultural and poli-
tical support for eugenics in North A m e rica and in
m a ny European countries from the start of the
20th century to the 1970s. Industrial barons and
political elites had predictably little sympat hy for the
socially disadvantaged who were the targets of
eugenic policies. S u rp ri s i n g l y, eugenics also at t r a c t e d
considerable interest among we l fare reform e rs ,
Marxist and socialist intellectuals as well as feminists
c o nvinced that science should help the state in fos-
t e ring a genetically “ fit ”p o p u l at i o n . Some favo u r e d
negative eugenics, seeking to limit the production
of the “ u n fit ” ;o t h e rs opted for positive eugenics to
encourage the “fit”to have more children.
Once the horr o rs of Nazism were widely know n ,
m a ny countries were careful to avoid using the
word eugenics even though they continued to prac-
tice it.These “ p o p u l ation policies” mostly took the
f o rm of the compulsory steri l i z ation of “ f e e b l e
minded” women. Racism led to African American
women being grossly over-represented among the
60,000 people forcibly sterilized in several A m e ri c a n
s t ates from 1907 to 1960. In Scandinav i a ,p o l i t i c a l
leaders and geneticists adopted state policies for
c o m p u l s o ry steri l i z ation out of concern that the
e m e r ging we l fare state would encourage the “ u n fit ”
to reproduce and so reduce the quality of the
n ational stock. In Sweden alone, 63,000 people, 9 0
per cent of them women, were sterilized between
1934 and 1975.Norway, a much smaller country,
sterilized 48,000 in the same period. By contrast,
British and Dutch geneticists and policy-makers
adopted voluntary sterilization together with the
mass institutionalization and segr e g ation of the
“feeble-minded”.
The silence surrounding these painful chapters in
h i s t o ry is not surp ri s i n g . It takes a dour courage to
u n e a rth the horr o rs of any nat i o n ’s past. In Swe d e n ,
for example,the press first sparked public outrage ove r

eugenics in the 1970s.Yet it wa s n ’t until 1996 that the
g ove rnment agreed to compensate the women who
s u f f e r e d .To d ay ’s renewed interest in the past stems
from founders of the Human Genome Project
( H G P ) . From the project’s conception in 1985, l e a-
ding scientists like James Wat s o n ,c o - d i s c overer of the
s t ructure of DNA, s aw the need publicly to confront
this sinister past to prevent the shadow of the old stat e -
controlled eugenics from impeding the progress of the
H G P.As a result, they set aside part of the three-bil-
lion-dollar research budget to study not just the past
but the social, legal and ethical implications of cur-
rent research. M a ny scientists are acutely aware that
new forms of eugenics risk arising with new deve-
lopments in the field of genetics.
Fears of growing stigmas
Today geneticists are generally very careful to
avoid any links to state-controlled eugenics by adop-
ting a new approach with a Janus-like posture.
Facing the patient—the would-be parent—they
p r ovide informed choice about DNA testing. Fa c i n g
the stat e , they promise that fewer disabled chil-
dren will be born. However, as more foetuses are
screened for a growing range of conditions, many
voices within the disability movements argue that
“ t e s t i n g ” amounts to searching for the “ a b n o rm a l ” .
This “ s e a r c h ” steadily reduces our notions of what
it is to be “ n o rm a l ” , and this, activists say, w i l l
intensify the stigmatization of all disabled people.
Some activists have come close to an absolutist
opposition to all DNA testing to prevent women
from aborting so-called “abnormal”foetuses.This
position has predictably raised serious concern in the

global movement of women struggling to control
their own fert i l i t y. I n d e e d , the disability move m e n t
can look like an ally of pro-life gr o u p s.Yet it is pos-
sible, as disabled feminist groups have shown, to
share the disability movement’s concerns and still
defend women’s reproductive rights.
The “genetically approved”
To begin with, it is crucial to recognize that
despite the proliferation of DNA tests—each
patented and profit-yielding—genetics has so far
failed to fulfill its vaunted promises of gene therapy.
D o c t o rs are screening for conditions and disorders
which they cannot treat. So abortion is often pre-
sented as treat m e n t . Meanwhile a good mother-to-
be is expected to accept every test she can either
afford or the state provides. For many bioethicists,
feminists and disabled rights activists,this prolife-
ration of DNA tests opens the way to “consumer
e u g e n i c s ” which in the guise of offering gr e at e r
r e p r o d u c t i ve choices in practice applies pressure to
select the “genetically approved”.
To assure truly free reproductive decision-
making, it is crucial to ask: who benefits from the
tests—individuals or companies selling them? For
most women—not all—a DNA test which can accu-
r ately indicate a terrible genetic disorder in the
foetus enhances, even if sadly, her ethical choices.
But what about the possible proliferation of DNA
tests for relat i vely minor genetic disorders , l i k e
deafness or restricted stature? 
Another major ethical issue lurks in the proli-
f e r ation of DNA testing: by focusing on genetic
we a k n e s s e s , we may neglect environmental fa c t o rs ,
like pove rt y. A m e rican sociologist Tr oy Duster
points out that the most effective way—in both
medical and economic terms—to promote the birt h
of healthy newborns lies in helping poor women eat
properly during pregnancy. In the state of Cali-
f o rn i a , more infants suffer from the serious and
often fatal health problems caused by low birt h
weight than by genetic disease. For Duster, t h e
state decision to invest in DNA testing instead of
anti-poverty programmes opens the “backdoor to
eugenics” with painful implications in view of the
fact that A f rican A m e ricans are massively ove r -
represented among the poor.
How can we better manage this powerful bio-
technology? We can begin by stimulating an
informed debate about the possibilities and limits
of DNA testing.The public needs a solid informa-
tion base to take an active part in developing sen-
sitive and effective regulatory systems. Screaming
headlines announcing “designer babies” in which
fantasy parents choose the height, i n t e l l i g e n c e ,
looks and behaviour of their future offspring will do
little to help us resolve thorny ethical questions
a ri s i n g .I n s t e a d , we might begin by learning from the
t wo countries where the public trusts its gove rn m e n t
most when it comes to biotechnology, Denmark and
the Netherlands. It is not by chance that they have
done the most to manage these technologies demo-
cratically. n
