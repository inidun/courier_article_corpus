The world is going through a period of fa r -
reaching upheaval.Armed conflicts, flagrant
and systematic violations of human rights and
the denial of fundamental freedoms continue to make
headlines in various parts of the globe.
W h at parameters would help us take stock of the
c u rrent situation regarding these rights and freedoms?
Let us deliberately leave aside the quantitat i ve view of
t h i n g s , which sets out to put a figure on the violat i o n s
and outrages committed eve ry day. This sort of
g u e s swork is misleading, for there can be no doubt that
there are countless situations midway between the
absence of killing, abduction and arbitrary detention
and the wholesale application of human ri g h t s —
s i t u ations where the fact that no crime has been
committed does not necessarily mean that justice
prevails. Intimidation and blackmail can also create
a semblance of order.

As the world changes, so does the defense of human rights.
International civil society is mobilizing in reaction to  new
threats to the gains already made
mechanisms are the norm at i ve and theoretical
f r a m e work of tangible results and a systemat i c
broadening of the concept of human rights over the
past 50 ye a rs.A p p r oved in 1948 by the intern at i o n a l
community as a common set of rules recognizing the
inherent dignity and inalienable rights of all people in
all countri e s , the Unive rsal Declaration wa s , in its
d ay,a response to the global clamour for an end to the
horrors of world war. Subsequently, the struggle for
human rights was also a powerful weapon in the
demise of totalitarian regimes such as those in Eastern
Europe and of bloody military dictat o rships on eve ry
c o n t i n e n t . It also served to curb the authori t a ri a n
b e h aviour of gove rnments formally considered
d e m o c r at i c.At times, this struggle has borne the seeds
of democracy, not just in terms of a system of
g ove rnment but of a forum for exercising fundamental
f r e e d o m s.We all remember how intern ational public
o p i n i o n ,with its insistent demands for human ri g h t s ,
c o n t ri buted to the fall of regimes like those of Marcos
in the Philippines, Somoza in Nicaragua,Pinochet in
Chile, Pol Pot in Cambodia and apartheid in South
Africa.
“All rights for all” is the basic message of the

U n i ve rsal Declaration which continues to be the
source of inspiration and the standard by which we
measure our successes.There is not a single country
t h at denies its validity and all countries have
subscribed to it.Yet,does this signify anything more
than mere formal recognition? When countries rat i f y
the Universal Declaration,they agree to implement
the rights explicitly set forth in its articles,to ensure
t h at they are applied and to sanction those who violat e
t h e m . There is a tendency all over the world to
i n c o rp o r ate these intern ational legal instruments into
n ational law. But the weakness of national judicial
systems and the widespread corruption of political
a u t h o rities are such that the effective application of
these intern ational instruments is nothing more than
a mere aspirat i o n .T h u s , it is not so much the existence
of constitutional texts which defines democracy bu t
the establishment of the rule of law,with authorities and
means of recours e , which guarantee their applicat i o n
for the benefit of citizens.
Even so, in the face of critical and vigilant public
opinion no country, g ove rnment or political, m i l i t a ry
or judicial authority would now go so far as to deny
the existence of these fundamental ri g h t s. I n d e e d ,
the most significant progress made in recent ye a rs
lies in the level of awareness attained by millions of
individuals all over the wo r l d . As we have seen in
many peasant communities in the Andean region of
L atin A m e ri c a , citizens of the most fa r - flung corn e rs
of the earth who have never heard of the Universal
Declaration still demand “human rights”.
The existence, d ri ve and combat i ve spirit of
thousands of associat i o n s — r a n ging from the relat i ve s
of victims of violations to organizations with an
i n t e rn ational scope of activity—have led to victory
in battles which seemed doomed.We are witnessing
the emergence of a global human rights culture based
on implicit recognition of the fact that citizens’
o r g a n i z ations exercise the right to keep watch over the
behaviour of states.
This increasingly keen awareness on the part of
civil society is bound to have an impact on gove rn m e n t
policies and lays the gr o u n d work for adva n c i n g
i n t e rn ational legal machinery and instru m e n t s. O n e
obvious example is wo m e n ’s struggle to ove r c o m e
d i s c ri m i n at i o n .The United Nat i o n s ’ adoption in
1967 of a special declaration  on wo m e n ’s
rights, as well as the Beijing Conference
and the implementation of the measures
resulting from it, are some of the
i n t e rn ational milestones in the
social advancement of wo m e n .
They are largely due to the work
of activists in the field.
H owe ve r , the emergence of a
worldwide ethical awareness is
accompanied by new social
c l e avages that are transform i n g

the planet’s political and economic landscape. S o m e
of the most blatant features include the stepped-up
pace of globalizat i o n , the prominence gi ven to market
forces at the expense of their social and gove rn m e n t a l
r e g u l at i o n , the superi o rity of productivity and
c o m p e t i t i veness over equity, the weakening of the
n at i o n - s t ate and the creation of new economic blocs.
For the moment,g l o b a l i z ation has not meant that
e ve rybody has access to common unive rsal va l u e s.
While exacerbating social exclusion and division, it is
also fostering a context conducive to the strengthening
of intern ational mechanisms for
protecting human ri g h t s.T h at is one of
the main ambiguities of the present
s i t u ation which will have to be borne in
mind in the future, since it is changi n g
people’s perceptions of their rights as
well as the environment in which they
can be exercised.
The question ari s e s ,t h e n ,w h e t h e r
basic freedoms and rights have made
a ny significant progress in the past ten
ye a rs of liberal cru s a d i n g . G e n e r a l l y
speaking, the answer is “no”, among
other things because the strong state is
being replaced not so much by a small
and efficient state as by a weak one,which tends to
g ove rn on the basis of political corruption and
cronyism.
In this new context, it is necessary to highlight
t wo aspects essential to the progress of human ri g h t s
in the wo r l d : the struggle to prevent human ri g h t s
v i o l ations from going unpunished and the recognition
of the indivisible nature of those rights.
It is common to find judicial and propaganda
m a n o e u v r e s , often illegal and violent, aimed at
protecting the intellectual, p hysical or political
a u t h o rs of dreadful crimes committed against
individuals and humanity. Impunity has come to be
granted by law, so that military authorities are
e x o n e r ated from responsibility. In most cases, t h e
granting of impunity has been the outcome of
n e g o t i ations between democratically elected
g ove rnments and soldiers surr e n d e ring powe r , o r
b e t ween rebel military organizations and transition
g ove rnments after periods of domestic violence.T h i s
was the case between the guerrillas of El Salvador and
G u atemala and their respective gove rnments and
a rmed forces. Practical steps must be taken to do
away with the problem of impunity,
so that the truth will be know n ,j u s t i c e
done and appropri ate compensat i o n
granted to the victims or their relat i ve s.
To turn the page, it must be read
b e f o r e h a n d .
This is likewise related to the
establishment of a new intern at i o n a l
o r d e r , since the mechanisms of
impunity and arbitrariness also act at
the intern ational leve l . The major
p owe rs often change the rules according
to their political interests or economic
i m p e r at i ves by condemning or
pardoning the crimes committed by
c o u n t ri e s , depending on whether they are “ e n e m i e s ”
or potential “ a l l i e s ” .
The principle of indivisibility implies,in the first
p l a c e , rejection of a ranking order of human ri g h t s ,a s
well as recognition of the give-and-take relationship
b e t ween individual freedoms and the conditions
essential for exercising them.In this sense, one of the
most disturbing new trends is the loss of economic,
social and cultural rights affecting wo r k e rs in almost
e ve ry country.The decline in earning leve l s ,d e p l o r a b l e
working conditions, instability and the loss of we l fa r e
b e n e fits by millions of people, all of which are refle c t e d
in gr owing social exclusion, are a significant step
b a c k wa r d s. U n d e r d e velopment creates a climat e
c o n d u c i ve to violations of fundamental rights and
inhibits the emergence of a civil society capable of
entering into dialogue with the state.Not only does
this foster individualism or an “ e ve ry man for himself”
at t i t u d e , but it hinders the development of legal
protection existing for civil and political rights.
The fiftieth annive rs a ry of the Unive rs a l
D e c l a r ation on 10 December 1998 affords an
o p p o rtunity to consider the gains made and to renew
the pledge of the intern ational community and
citizens to engage in the enormous task before us.
N e w s p a p e rs and television remind us that there is no
reason for complacency or self-sat i s fa c t i o n .T h e r e
are, however, grounds for hope in the effective and
increasingly forceful mobilization of human ri g h t s
activists in national leagues or intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z at i o n s , often at the risk of their live s. T h i s
confirms that people are no longer prepared to leave
the fulfilment of their aspirations for a more just,
f r at e rnal and caring world to gove rnments or
international authorities. n
