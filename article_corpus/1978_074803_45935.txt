Milestones
Despite very wide variations in geographical environment, material living
conditions, social and cultural background, children throughout the world
present a number of characteristics in common and pass through the same
stages of development. The table of development "milestones" given here
is taken from a study carried out by the International Children's Centre at
Unesco's request. But since children are individuals, the acquisitions listed
are not milestones that a child must pass at exactly the age stated. They are
points of reference in the development of motor activity, sensory perception,
speech and relations with other people. Many others could be cited which
parents will discover for themselves through observation and experience.
