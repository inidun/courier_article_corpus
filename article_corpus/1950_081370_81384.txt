For Ram Char'era

"ABSTRACTS"

EACH ONE TEACH ONE.-In
India, as in those other countries
where the problem of illiteracy is
greatest, there is a shortage 01
trained teachers.
Fortunately, every
one who has at-
ready received so-
me instruction can
help others to
learn reading and
writing. This ph010
from the Centrul
Provinces of India
shows a Hindu lad
sharing his know-
ledge with some
Muslim friends.
N the little town of AdiIabad in
I rural India, a teacher, aided byUnesco, is guiding both a
seven-year-old boy and his 35-year-
old father along the road of
reading and writing which leads to
more active, more creative and
happier lives.
Little Ram Chandra was eager
from the very beginning, but his
father had been apathetic."Why",
he asked"should a poor and igno-
rant man learn to read about the
great world outside this valley ?
Why should he puzzle his tired
brain over the poetry of a man
named Tagore ? What good is all
this to me-and what good will it
be to my son ?"
But the teacher persuaded the
father that there are good reasons for
both of them to learn to read and
write.-Soon, father and son will learn
from books the cause of the"strange''
illness which frequently hits their fa-
mily. They will know that dysentery
is caused by pol : uted water from the
old well on the North Road, or carried
by swarms of flies in their house.
And they will learn that it may be
checked, even in Adilabad.
Ram and his father are being taught
to read and write so that they may
improve their lives with such facts,
and others-how to build a chimney
and fireplace with mud, why their
courtyard space should be planted
with vegetables, and how reasonable it
is to learn handicraft and practical
trades.
Bugs On Paper
T) AM'S teacher wants literacy tobring the world s experience about
prenatal care and baby health
into the home of Ram's father and
mother. Many other useful, definite
objectives for the people of Adilabad
loom before this teacher as he labours
to eliminate illiteracy. Naturally, he
also wishes to bring cultural enjoyment
to Ram and his father, including the
poetry of Tagore. But first things
first.
Similar objectives are before teachers
in Southern Italy, Indonesia, Tunisia,
Chile and among Eskimos in Green-
land-wherever there is a person
working to help another comprehend
the"bugs on paper". These"whys"
of literacy work depend largely upon
the"how"it may be accomplished.
The tools are important, shaping
human lives. The published"tools"
of the world-wide literacy programme
are varied and they issue forth in a
flood of matter in many languages.
The Secretariat of Public Education
in Mexico City issues a book of 112 pa-
ges which is a"primer"for literacy
teachers of modest education. A Lon-
don publisher prints a series of book-
lets as follow-up reading for the
newly literate. The Northern Rhode-
sia Publicity Office makes a film-strip
available showing the"each one teach
cne"system of helping people learn to
read and write. And it goes on for
hundreds of pages, the roster of the
materials which can be obtained by
teachers.
Briefing By Unesco
BUT where is this list, and how doesone come by it if one is a teach r
in Adilabad or the mountains of
Chile ? The teacher of Ram Chandra
provides the answer. He studies each
month a folio of 12 pages or more
which is published by Unesco, at
Unesco House, in Paris, under the title,
"Fundamental Education Abstracts."
He is"briefed"in this folio on the
late t publishing and'film-making de-
velopments in the field of fundamental
education, just as doctors are kept
informed of scientific developments
through the printed abstr, acts which
circulate throughout the world.
Thumbing through one of these
folios, one finds that a report has been
published On the Development of
Broadcasting to Africans in Central
Africa."The actual schedule of one
week's programmes is included, along
with an analysis of difficulties and
progress. This is a technique which
can be useful in many rural areas
where the village gathers about one
radio to listen to the world.
And there is another study of work
among 250 illiterates of Rome."Self-
government within the group of youths,
and extensive use of the library are
marked features."
Unesco includes general publications
which are useful after literacy is
achieved. Among these are pamphlets
giving clear directions on how the
people of a village can save their soil
from erosion. Another is titled,
"Improving Our Community Homes".
There are lists of textbooks, and in-
structions for making educational
films. Of equal significance are lists
of works on community responsibilities
and the international aspects of mo-
dern citizenship. In each case the
source, price and ordering arrange-
ments are given, as well as-a brief
summary of the subject.
To Live Fuller Lives
cm A BSTRACTS"are printed inEnglish, Spanish and French.
They are distributed to libra-
ries, teacher-training institutions, field
missions in fundamental education,
and other key locations throughout
the world where the data are of maxi-
mum, immediate value. There,
teachers and field workers consult
"abstracts"and order the books, pam-
phlets, films or other materials essen-
tial for their programmes, or for fur-
thering their own technical know-
ledge.
A small staff of experts in Unesco
prepares materials, advises on lan-
guage problems and serves as a world
clearing-house for fundamental edu-
cation. They also publish four times
a year a Bulletin hi which typically
successful programmes are analyzed
and illustrated as examples. In one
recent Bulletin, a 13-page article by a
British administrative officer described
literacy, health, agricultural and con-
struction work among Nigerian tribes.
Others dealt with Indian, Egyptian,
Chinese and Latin-American program-
mes in fundamental education.
Unesco staff people also prepare
audio-visual devices and exhibits for
special field tours to demonstrate mo-
dern methods for speedier teaching.
All these services are organized to aid
the teacher and field worker"to help
men, and women to live fuller lives in
adjustment with their changing-envi-
ronment, to develop the best elements
in their own cultures, to enable them
to take their place in the modern
world, and to live together in peace."
