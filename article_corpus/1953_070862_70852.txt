o THE HAIL OF COSMIC RAYS
FROM OUTER SPACE
m BALL lying still on a table is
. harmless ; the same ball
flying through the ir can be
dangerous and cause pain.
The difference is the energy of the
ball's motion. Is it the ball that
hurts when it strikes, or is it the
energy ?
What would be the effect of
throwing a package of energy alone,
with no ball ? It cannot ordinarily
be done because energy is normally
carried by pieces or particles of
"matter". In the case of molecules
and atoms if is usually the energy of
motion, even when it is felt as heat.
In the case of protons and electrons
it may be electrical energy.
But in the case of the particles that
are smaller than the atomic nucleus,
whether inside it or free in space,
energy is their outstanding property.
Only in motion or through some
form of energetic action can any of
the particles of nuclear size be detect-
ed and studied. It is thus in the
form of"rays"that these exceed-
ingly small particles come to man's
attention. In nuclear research the
subject of study is always a combi-
nation of matter-and-energy in
which the two are so closely related
that one may even turn into the
other.
The most energetic particle produc-
ed naturally on earth is the alpha
ray from radium, which is a helium
nucleus ejected at perhaps one tenth
of the velocity of light. How it gets
that speed and energy from within
the close quarters of the radium nu-
cleus is still a mystery. But if such
concentration of energy is rarely
found on earth, outer space, the
"empty"space beyond the earth's
atmosphere, bristles with it. The
study of these"cosmic rays"is one
of the most intricate and adventu-
rous of all modern researches and
can merely be sketched in a brief
article.
It began during the opening years
of this century when the British
Professor C. T. R. Wilson first sus-
pected that the gradual leakage of
static electricity from his well insu-
lated laboratory apparatus was due
to some unknown penetrating radia-
tion, like X-rays perhaps, originat-
ing outside the earth.
The Swiss scientist A. Gockel,
testing this idea in a balloon, found
in 1909 that the effect was in fact
stronger at an atti-
tude of 2i miles
(4. 300 metres). In
the next year the
Austrian V. F. Hess
confirmed this dis-
covery by ascend-
ing still higher to
5, 200 metres (3i mi-
les), and gave the
rays their present
name : cosmic. In 1913 the German
Kolhorster reached a height of six
miles (9, 000 metres) and found that
at that height the rays were 30 times
as intense as at sea-level.
Whence do they co. me ? An easy
guess is that their source is the sun.
But they are just as intense at night
as by day, even though at night the
entire great mass of the earth is in
their path-so they do not come
from the sun. From the stars of
our own galaxy, the Milky Way ?
That is possible, perhaps probable.
Or they may be produced by colli-
sions or explosions of individual
elementary particles in the empti-
ness of space itself. At present no-
one knows.
What is known is that the energy
that constantly reaches the earth in
this form is at least as great as the
energy of all the light from all the
stars-except the sun. We live in
a constant hail of cosmic rays.
Each human body is pierced more
than twenty times a second by these
rays-which, fortunately, are
harmless.
From where do they
come-the Milky Way ?
Nobody yet knows
What is astonishing about them is
their enormous energy. They are
certainly particles, most of them
protons, some of them the more
complex nuclei of helium atoms,
with a small proportion of the larger
nuclei of heavy atoms. But they
come to earth at speeds very close
to the velocity of light and with
energies that are measured in many
thousands of millions of electron
volts-or even millions of millions.
The electron-volt is the unit of
energy used for such individual
particles. Technically, it is the
energy acquired by one electron
when it is accelerated by a pro-
pelling voltage of one volt. To
knock an electron from an atom of
oxygen in the air requires about
30 electron-volts. Alpha-rays from
radium carry 4 to
10 million electron-
volts.
But for a cosmic
ray to enter the
earth's atmosphere
near the equator,
in defiance of the
earth's magnetism,
requires an energy
of at least 20 thou-
sand million electron-volts. These
are the feeblest of them. The most
energetic yet found have an energy
of a 100, 000 million times a million
electron-volts. These are energies
far beyond any other earthly expe-
rience.
How this energy is acquired some-
where in the depths of space is
quite unknown. Even if, for ins-
tance, an atom of helium were
completely destroyed, annihilated,
and changed into energy in accord
with the Einstein theory, that energy
would amount to only 4, 000 million
electron-volts. Another assumption,
made by the Italian Professor Fermi,
is that the energy is gradually built
up by the passage of the particle
through magnetic clouds of matter
in outer space which would accele-
rate a particle as a tennis racquet
speeds a flying ball.
But no theory of the source of
their energy is adequate ; the expla-
nation awaits further investigators.
It may well be that the problem
will not be solved until the rays can
be studied in an interplanetary roc-
ket far out in space or in a labora-
tory set up on the air-less surface
01 we moon.
Even more fasci-
nating is the story
of what happens
when these rays
strike the earth's
atmosphere and
drive downward.
Twenty years of
investigation with
the instruments of
modern nuclear physics have pro-
duced photographs of their tracks
in passing through air and through
interposed targets. They have been
measured on the tops of mountains,
in the depths of mines, under deep
water, and high in the stratosphere
by balloons and even in rockets.
They have revealed more of the
nature of matter and of energy than
would possibly have been believed
even ten years ago. Only the con-
clusions-as of now-can be told
here.
Out in space there may be rays of
relatively low energy. But those
that move with less than a thousand
million electron-volts are deflected
by the sun's magnetic field and
never get near the earth. Those that
do reach our vicinity and have less
than 60 thousand million electron-
volts are deflected by the earth's
magnetic field.
The very energetic particles that
drive toward the earth's surface in
spite of the magnetic field collide
with the atoms in the upper regions
of the stratosphere. In such colli-
In the universe of the
infinitely tiny every-
thing is astronomical
sions they lose part of the energy
and create whole showers of elec-
trons which in turn plunge toward
the earth. Such showers covering
many square miles of the earth's
surface were revealed by extended
measurements on high mountains
by the French Professor Pierre
Auger.But the showers also contain pho-
tons, which are uncharged units of
radiation energy, particles of light,
so to speak. These can disintegrate
into a pair of electrons, one positive
and one negative. This already
gives us two new particles, not
mentioned previously, the photon
and the positive electron, which is
quite like the usual negative elec-
tron, except that it is positively
charged. It was first discovered in
cosmic rays Dy tne
American Dr. Carl
D. Anderson in
1942.
But later several
other new particles
were discovered in
these rays. They
are known as me-
sons. They have
the charge of an
electron, some of them positive,
some negative. But they are inter-
mediate in mass between an elec-
tron and a proton. One variety has
a mass of 276 times that of an
electron, another of only 210. Their
existence was suggested theoreti-
cally by the Japanese mathemati-
cian H. Yukawa in 1935 and they
were discovered in cosmic rays in
hums.
But here lis another surprise : the
meson is a phantom particle in that
it exists for only a few millionths of
a second.. ten spite of their short life
they can be detected because, at
their high energy, they travel great
distances. They seem then to be
converted into high speed electrons,
and in the process give rise to still
another elementary particle, the.
neutrino.
By now the variety of particles in
or produced by the cosmic rays has
become too complex for anyone but
an expert to comprehend. Present
knowledge is in that rapid state of
growth when there are more ques-
tions than answers. When the
maze of particles are themselves
understood there will remain the
problem of how they are held toge-
ther in the atomic nucleus, which is
now seen to be a very complicated
particle indeed.
There is at this moment much
discussion as to the role of the
mesons in acting as a force bind-
ing the others together, hence acting
as a sort of glue within the nucleus.
The rays from the sky have
thus revealed unsuspected mysteries
within the nucleus itself. They are
very difficult to study because they
arrive uncontrolled from the outer
universe and are at their best high
in the stratosphere. To study parti-
cles of such high energy on earth
and in the laboratory requires that
the same particles be artificially
created and the cosmic rays thus
duplicated. This in turn requires
endowing them with much more
energy than any earthly particles
normally possess, literally thousands
of millions of electron-volts. To do
this is the function of the'giant
cyclotrons. The story of how it is
done is the subject of the next article
in this series.
One may note in passing that this
one short article has mentioned
pioneer cosmic ray researches in
Great Britain, Switzerland, Austria.
Germany, Italy, France, the USA
and Japan. Research is active in
this subject in many other lands, for
cosmic rays are everywhere. But
cyclotrons are expensive and re-
search with them not so widely
spread among the nations.
 Nuclear events (collisions
between high energy at-
omic particles and nuclei)
are revealed by the thin
white tracks shown in this
strip of photographs, made
at the Nevis Laboratory,
Columbia University, USA
Tracks of particles which
have been given a high
speed in a cyclotron are
automatically photograph-
ed every ten seconds.
Studies of these tracks
help scientists to under-
stand more about the par-
ticles and how they are
held together in the nu-
cleus of the atom. Our
front page shows a similar
