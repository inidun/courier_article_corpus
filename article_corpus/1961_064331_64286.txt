THE ENCHANTMENT OF LINES

"People often ask me about the meaning of my pictures", wrote Rabindranath Tagore. "I
remain silent even as my pictures are. ft is for them to express not to explain. They have
nothing ulterior behind their own appearance for the thoughts to explore and words to describe
and if that appearance carries its ultimate worth then they remain, otherwise they are rejected
and forgotten even though they may have some scientific truth or ethical justification". In I 928,
at the age of 67, Tagore, to use his own words, "fell under the enchantment of lines" when he
discovered that his hand was moving automatica|y across the pages of his manuscripts trans¬
forming the scratches and erasures into designs. For the next 1 2 years of his life he gave full rein
to this irresistible urge and produced nearly 2,()f00 paintings. Although he used all kinds of
paints and produced coloured chalk drawings, pastels, and later dry-points and etchings, Tagore's
preferred medium was liquid colour. He often used ordinary fountain-pen ink and when this
was not available, he crushed flower petals and used them as pigments. He rarely used a brush,
disdained an artist's palette and instead, worked with a cloth soaked in colour, the back of a
fountain-pen, his thumb, a stick or, more often, a knife. As these illustrations show, Tagore's art
was peculiarly his own, and though he held his first exhibition in I 930, Rabindranath Tagore the
Painter has until recently remained practically unknown. (An] illustrated article on his work
figured in the issue of The Unesco Courier, "Famous Authors as Artists", in August 1957).
