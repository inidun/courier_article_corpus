Asian O v e rg ro u n d
The contradictions of Euro p e ’s rage for ethnic exoticism take centre stage in an interview 
with Pandit G of Asian Dub Fo u n d a t i o n , a UK band serving up a searing mix of jungle rhythms,
rap and ‘ t raditional’ sounds steeped in social justice
The global music industry makes a fortune by mixing
various strands of music, often tra d i t i o n a l , w i t h
g e n res like hip-hop or techno. Is this a replay of
classic capitalist exploitation—extract raw materials,
package and sell them back to the “ n a t i v e s ” ?
People have always mixed music from else-
where and turned it into their own style. For
example, bhangra [now very fashionably sam-
pled] is really an indigenous form of Punjabi folk
music created in Britain (see p.49). The early
migrants from the Asian subcontinent largely
came to Britain to work in cotton and textile mills
after the war, particularly in the mid-to-late 50s.
Many came from Punjab, which straddles the
border with Pakistan. So a generation coming
right up to the late 60s was listening to Punjabi
folk music but mixing it with the dominant music
form of the time, rock.That meant using electric
guitars, drum kits as well as traditional instru-
ments. What used to be a big musical troupe
could be replaced with technology and just three
or four members.
But on the opposite pole,you always find peo-
ple out to exploit ethnicity or exoticism. In
Britain, why do musicians like Kula Shaker [a
neo-hippie rock band] need to go to India to find
inspiration or symbolism? Why couldn’t they have
gone to places like Southall [an Asian neighbour-
hood] on their doorstep in London?
What do you think of “Asian Kool”—or the curre n t
rage for Indian-inspired music and fashion? 
We could be talking about Asian Kool,
C a ribbean Kool or A f rican A m e rican Kool. T h e
people pushing this kind of thing have recognised
t h at there is no strong white We s t e rn notion of cool

amongst youth.Largely black identity is mixed up
with being anti-establishment. Exoticism makes
this idea sell a bit but it’ll only be forgotten in a few
years’time.
In the UK, you’ll see people in the streets
wearing their little bindis on their foreheads and
thinking they’ve made an anti-racist statement.
But they wouldn’t talk with Asian people working
in a cornershop. By focusing on the exoticism,
people can say, “These Indians don’t mind being
poor because they’re spiritual.”
What do you think of the “New A s i a n
U n d e rg round”—a tag often attached to Asian Dub
Foundation (ADF)?
I t ’s an easy sound-bite to market the music. B u t
we have to take a British pers p e c t i ve because of the
h i s t o ry of colonialism.White society in the UK largely
sees the Asian community as being homogeneous.Ye t
the handful of musicians that make up this “ A s i a n
U n d e r gr o u n d ”can be Muslim,H i n d u ,C h ri s t i a n ,S i k h
or Buddhist and [ori ginally] come from a geogr a p h i c
area three times bigger than the UK.
“We ain’t ethnic, exotic or eclectic. The only ‘e’ we
use is electric,” rhymes a line from an ADF song. Do
you ever feel the burden of representing an ethnic
community?
We only represent ourselves. There is a line
precisely on that from our album, Rafi’s Revenge:
“Culture is always on the move.There is no fixed
point.” We can also hold this up to white society,
which imagines an ideal time when there was
some pure British society—which never was. Just
like there was never a pure Indian society.
We wo n ’t accept any pigeonholes.The tag that
gets used most to describe us is:political band.We
get journalists say i n g, “Once you get through the
p o l i t i c s , the album isn’t bad.”We believe that eve ry-
thing is political. F i ve Asians gettin’ on stage, p l ay i n ’
guitar and sampler,is political.
You’ve said that ADF has never been directly
censored because of its strong anti-racist political
platform*, but how can the mainstream media and
music industry indirectly stifle a group’s message? 
A backlash is slowly set up. First the media
presents radical music as something new. Even
though what’s new is that the political platform is
reaching a wider audience. But by reaching more
people, you upset the status quo, which doesn’t
sell advertising copy. So what does the press do?
They set you up as celebrities, isolate you and
then try to crush you.
It wouldn’t be direct censorship from the
record company—you’d just find that your record
isn’t available in the shops.You don’t get any tour
support. There’s many ways of stopping a band
from reaching a broad audience. ■

*Among its many anti-racist
activities,ADF has
spearheaded the international
campaign to free British citizen
Satpal Ram,who many believe
has been unjustly imprisoned
for defending himself against a
racially motivated attack by six
men in Birmingham in 1986.
