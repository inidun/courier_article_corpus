a shattered structure, most of its 
treasures having been plundered or 
wantonly destroyed. Across town at 
the Bakhtar National News Agency, 
journalists struggle with a solitary 
decrepit teleprinter to receive and 
send news. With a fledgling private 
press only now emerging, the coun-
try faces an information deficit on a 
grand scale.
 
The challenge 
of forging new nations
The Afghanistan situation is not 
unique. Wherever there is war, 
major civil unrest or new nations 
are being forged from the fires of 
conflict or political transition, there 
often exists a need to reconnect 
society, reconstruct the cultural 
fabric and tackle major issues, such 
as abject poverty, social depriva-
tion and violations of human rights. 
Cambodia had its own initiation in 
the early 1990s as it re-emerged 
from the horrors of a brutal past, 
while Timor Leste, a decade later, 
was born amid tumult and violence. 
Europe saw the depths of pain in 
the former Yugoslavia, and Africa 
has experienced the genocide of 
Rwanda and, now, the agony of 
Darfur. 
While international humanitarian 
relief and development agencies 
cannot, alone, solve societal and 
infrastructural problems which have 
been years in gestation, their im-
mediate presence in post-conflict 
situations can be crucial in assist-
ing local authorities and civil society 
in setting agendas, defining objec-
tives and goals, and encouraging 
democratic outcomes. In situations 
where ‘everything’ needs renova-
tion, prioritizing is complex. Expec-
tations by the long-suffering popu-
lace are high, while skilled human 
resources and immediately avail-
able aid funding are often limited. 
Ethnic and political fractures are 
A nation stays alive when its 
culture stays alive” reads 
a defiant banner hanging 
above the main entrance to Kabul’s 
National Museum.
Half a dozen UN four-wheel drive 
vehicles are lined-up ready to carry 
passengers the 50 kilometres to 
Kabul. I share a place with sev-
eral other new arrivals, including 
the incoming Minister of Women’s 
Affairs in the soon to be inaugurated 
administration of Hamid Karzai. She 
has not been back to Afghanistan in 
years, but her optimism and enthu-
siasm for the new-era in her country 
are infectious. Emotions overflow 
as we traverse a road littered with 
burnt-out military equipment, our 
car occasionally fording river cross-
ings to by-pass bridges destroyed 
in aerial bombing attacks. 
Winter’s shallow afternoon light 
casts Kabul’s streets as bleak and 
spare. Cyclists and donkey-drawn 
carts meander the thoroughfares, 
their riders, exhausted by years of 
conflict and harsh living conditions, 
peering expectantly at the newcom-
ers now flooding into their lives. 
In the days ahead, visits to key 
Governmental authorities and or-
ganizations tell their own story. An 
education system in chaos, where 
dusty shelves and cupboards in 
the central Ministry building are 
stacked with printed records of per-
sonnel and curricula which seem to 
match no reality. Schools lie in ru-
ins. Women, once the backbone 
of the teaching service, have been 
excluded from their duties for years 
and girls have had to rely on clan-
destine schooling. 
“A nation stays alive when its cul-
ture stays alive” reads a defiant 
banner hanging above the main en-
trance to Kabul’s National Museum. 
Once the repository of the arte-
facts and jewels of Afghanistan’s 
rich cultural civilization, it is now 
usually still apparent, while basic 
delivery mechanisms for develop-
ment programmes can be non-ex-
istent.
 
An important role 
for the International 
community
International intervention is not 
without its own problems. An influx 
of well-paid foreigners can impact 
hostilely on local economies, lifting 
the costs of basic food and ser-
vices to well beyond the reach of 
the general population. Inevitably, 
international agencies and NGOs 
source local employees from the 
already well-educated, urban elite, 
further exacerbating divisions 
between ‘haves and have nots’, 
while also draining skilled human 
resources from local enterprises. 
Without rapid and tangible change 
for the better, especially in general 
living conditions, tolerance by the 
citizenry to the presence of the 
global aid community can quickly 
turn to cynicism. 
Each post-conflict society is re-
sponsible for planning, shaping 
and re-building its own future. But it 
is also true that the global commu-
nity has an expectation that agen-
cies such as UNESCO will also be 
present as partners of goodwill and 
expertise in the renewal process. 
For development agencies, walk-
ing the fine-line between knowing 
when and how to act, and when 
to exit a post-conflict situation, is 
much like a de-mining expert facing 
the challenge of clearing another 
of Afghanistan’s minefields. Every 
step forward needs careful judge-
ment and consideration. However, 
although danger lurks, without 
those tentative steps there can be 
no successful outcome to the na-
tion-building task.
