Like many or your generation,
you trace your political awakening 
back to the UK miners’ strike of 
1984-85. But surely it stems back to your
childhood, growing up in a working class
family but attending an elite school on 
a scholarship. You were part of the
“deserving poor”, deemed worthy of 
a first-class education.
This kind of experience gi ves you a ve ry
rapid education about class. . . . All yo u r
m ates at home think yo u ’re posh and all the
people at school think yo u ’re common. S o
you find yo u rself caught in the middle. I
think you’ll find that many comedians, in par-
t i c u l a r ,h ave this sense of being an outsider.
Two heroes of mine were both outsiders :
Oscar Wilde,an Irishman who lived in the
cream of English high society, and Dave
A l l e n , a brilliant comedian in a similar posi-
t i o n .Allen did this wonderful routine which
I think sums it up.
H e ’s on stage in London and say s ,“ We l l ,
I tell Irish jokes. And I get in trouble for tel-
ling ’em. But I think ‘sod it! If you cannot
laugh at yo u rs e l f, w h at ’s the point?’A round
of applause from the studio audience.
So he starts telling Irish jokes.“ Two pad-
dies leave Dublin to go to work in London.
The collective IQ of Dublin halves ove r-
n i g h t .”A big round of applause.“ Yo u ’ ve got
to be able to laugh at yo u rs e l f, h ave n ’t yo u ? ”
he say s. Another big round of applause.
Allen goes on. “When the two get to
London, the IQ there doubles overnight.”
Smaller round of applause. “I thought we
agreed that you’re supposed to be able to
laugh at yourself.”
This catches the audience completely
u n aware of their own bigotry. T h at ’s the
eye of the outsider.
Your brand of stand-up comedy seems to
mean getting up on a soap box to
denounce wrong-doing. Why?
My tour manager always used to say,
“ I t ’s in the genes, m at e .”You see my dad wa s
a lay preacher and my gr e at gr a n d fat h e r
was a Baptist preacher which I think is
funny. I’ll start to worry about it if my son
decides to be a stand-up.
Seriously, do you have to focus on political
issues in your work?
Every single thing that anyone says on
stage belies their world view. It’s a political
decision to believe that people just want a
good night out without having to think.
The person on stage who tells jokes por-
t r aying women in a certain way has made a
political decision to reinforce stereotypes
instead of challenging people to think other-
wise.That performer is saying,“I want the
easiest ride possible. I want mass adula-
tion on the back of you (the audience) not
having to think.” The difference is that I
want mass adulation on the back of people
having to think.
How do you design a TV comedy show to
make people think?
We look at the series as our own “state
of the nation”broadcast.It’s our interpre-
t ation of where Britain is and where we are
in relationship to the world.
We try to get in a position where we
can ask questions that will illuminate the
n ature of power in that situat i o n .With Sel-
l a field nuclear processing plant, the firs t
thing we did was to prove contamination
(see box) by having samples of earth from
around the site analysed. We could then

plant’s nuclear waste? Or is there a wider
problem? Is the site irr a d i at e d ? ”The autho-
rities wo n ’t answe r. This is a bri l l i a n t
s i t u ation in which we really get undern e at h
the mask of public relations.The officials’
silence actually says that they’re fri g h t e n e d
of the answer.
In the last three years, you’ve evolved from
merry prankster to political satirist and
now you’re an information junky. What
happened? 
In the begi n n i n g, the show was about us
taking ri s k s — t u rning up at a cabinet minis-
t e r ’s home at a quarter to seven in the mor-
ning in a tank asking if he could help us
e x p o rt it to Iraq. Or turning up in Yo r k-
shire during a drought with a tanker filled
with water as a “ gift from the people of
E t h i o p i a ” after Britain pri vatized the wat e r
wo r k s.We were drawing out the stupidity of
the situation.
But the next year, we wanted to refine
the show.There were bits which I was very
proud of but it wasn’t mature or rigorous
e n o u g h .There wa s n ’t enough inform at i o n .
So in the second year, we really wanted to
be factually accurat e .N ow in this last ye a r ,
we wanted to go a step further and do sto-
ries that people have n ’t heard about
elsewhere. So we’ve ended up being acci-
dental journ a l i s t s.We didn’t intend for this
to happen. But now that it has, we quite like
i t . Do bad for good—that ’s basically the
ethos of the show.
Nine times out of ten,I think the most
i m p o rtant thing is to actually ask the ques-
tion and get it into the public domain.
Noam Chomsky, A m e rican linguist and
a c t i v i s t ,d e s c ribed it ve ry succinctly when he
said that the media reflect the dominant
interests in the political climate. . . . Who
owns the media? What are their interests?
W h at are the interests of the ruling elite
t h at they’re working with? How are they
setting the political agenda? Look at any
television programme that deals with sup-
posedly serious political news and yo u ’ l l
find interviews with gove rnment spokesmen
or women on an initiat i ve or piece of legi s-
l ation that they’ve creat e d . M aybe they’ll
address an issue the gove rnment is being
attacked about. But nearly all the interv i e w s
will be done with politicians, in studios with
r e p o rt e rs who have to come back to those
same officials the next week for more news.
If they decide to actually question the
relationships of power instead of focusing
just on the intricacies of elite policy, then
t h e y ’re quite often going to run into trouble.
But in staging the event, aren’t you
sacrificing objective and balanced
reporting?
If you take the ideas of objectivity,
balance and impartiality to their logical
May 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 47
“It’s like brain surgery with a hammer,” a
producer once said when describing Mark
Thomas’ television show, a mix of filmed
stunts and improvisation before a studio
audience. Recent highlights include:
m Menwith Hill Military Base
This sprawling complex of what looks like
giant golf-balls has been reported by British
broadsheet newspapers as the world’s largest
electronic monitoring station.It is owned by
the British defence ministry but reportedly
operated by the U.S. National Security Agency.
Since 1996,members of parliament and
concerned citizens have raised questions about
activities at the base. Officials, citing security
reasons, have been tight-lipped.Access to the
base is limited to officials with the highest
security clearance. But Thomas discovers that
the air over the base is not restricted.So he
takes a tour in a hot-air balloon and later
invites 500 or so fans for guided visits
scheduled to lift off this July 4th.
m British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL)
Local residents call Thomas when they find
trains used to transport radioactive waste from
the nearby Sellafield nuclear processing plant
(owned by BNFL) parked too close to home for
comfort. Thomas decides to investigate.
As a conductor leaves the train to open a
gate at a level crossing, Thomas and 40
camouflaged friends pull up in armoured cars
and a helicopter as “the People’s Nuclear Train
Militia”pledging to protect the train from
terrorist attack.
Next,the team don white suites to collect
samples of earth along the tracks surrounding
Sellafield which are analysed by a scientist at
the University of Manchester who finds traces
of radioactive materials. BNFL officials refuse
to meet with Thomas, who they maintain has
“trivialized”a serious subject. Thomas
launches a “telephonathon”,with journalists
and members of parliament barraging BNFL
with questions, essentially asking if the alleged
contamination is due to leaky containers in the
trains or wider problems with the nuclear
plant.In a letter, BNFL maintains that all
operations are carried out in strict accordance
with UK and international standards.
m Defendory International
Thomas and team set up a stand at this major
arms fair held in Greece under the guise of a
public relations firm with the theme: “Are you
ready when Amnesty International comes
knocking on your door?”As various high-
ranking officials visit the stand, Thomas
videotapes their discussions to offer an
unusual look at the men behind the arms
trade. A man who identifies himself on tape as

conclusion, then I believe you should
have the right to reply to every single
advertisement. Every time an advert by
petroleum companies like Shell or Esso
comes on television, then one and a half
minutes should be reserved for someone
from the public to say what they think
about those companies and their environ-
mental records.
The idea of objectivity doesn’t exist in
media—just the veneer of it. One of the
gr e atest quotes came from the British fil m -
maker Ken Loach over a film he did about
union bosses and how often they betray
the wo r k e rs.There was a big row about this
film, with critics saying “You’ve got to be
i m p a rt i a l ” and the union bosses say i n g,
“ We demand the right to reply.” Ken Loach
turned and said,“I am the right to reply.”
In most of the media, impartiality just
means not being too critical of the preva l e n t
ruling class perspective.
So your priority lies in being factually
correct.Impartiality is not a concern? 
We are the balance. I don’t know many
people who have done television pro-
grammes about the pri vat i z ation of the
national healthcare system aside from iso-
lated reports. On the case of the American
n Even the briefest sketch of Mark Thomas would
not be complete without a parenthetical guide
for those readers unfamiliar with the linguistic
subtleties of south London.
In short, Thomas discovers his first love—
stand-up comedy—at the age of 12 and begins to
produce and star in his own school productions.B u t
j o ke-telling veers towards trouble-making as
Thomas assumes the role of the herbert (slang for
a rebel without a cause, prone to drinking) when
he wins a scholarship as part of the “ d e s e r v i n g
p o o r ” to study at an elite school in Sussex.The snub
of upper class students is partially offset by the
wisdom of a drama teacher who helps to transform
t h e herbert into half a r t y - b o y (drama student
convinced of his god-given talent) by exposing
him to the works of Bertolt Brecht.
At Bretton Hall drama college,Thomas takes an
extracurricular course in political realism with the
miners’ strike of 1984-85. L i ke many of his genera-
t i o n , he is shocked into activism by the violence
and emotion of the strike, dividing his time bet-
ween picket lines and benefit shows for the Labour
m o v e m e n t .
After completing his studies, he works with
his father as a painter in London while building
a reputation as a stand-up comedian in clubs
before breaking into radio and television. Th r e e
years ago, he launches his own programme,“ Th e
Mark Thomas Comedy Product”, on Britain’s
Channel 4, a public TV station whose remit
requires it to cater for minority interests unde-
represented by other TV companies. He claims the
title of meeja hor (media whore) meaning
“someone who will do anything to be on the
t e l l y ” . The title is like an ironic wink to the
a u d i e n c e, alluding to the comic’s unease with his
role as “Channel Fo u r ’s pet rebel”.The station has
won a slew of awards for innovative program-
m i n g , b u t , says Th o m a s, the chase for ratings
has also brought a steady flow of imported sit-
c o m s. So when the critics howl, executives point
to Th o m a s.
With rising fame and salary,Thomas has moved
back to his old south London neighbourhood of Cla-
pham with his wife and young son.At the age of
3 5 ,t h e h e r b e r t has found a mission: “do bad for
g o o d ” . n
example, is recorded saying he gets “better at
lying every year”while another man who
identifies himself as the Deputy Commander of
the Kenyan Army says that “wife-beating is a
way of expressing love.”
In a mock workshop on “winning the war
of words” (dealing with the media), Thomas
videotapes a man who identifies himself as an
Indonesian general who admits to the use of
torture. The general was apparently so
impressed by the workshop that he later sent
a colonel from Jakarta to London to meet with
Thomas (incognito) and discuss the possibility
of offering a six-week media training course in
Indonesia. Both officials later deny statements
concerning torture and the use of UK military
equipment to violently quash civilian protests.
m Lie of the land
Under the UK’s Conditionally Exempt Land and
Building Scheme, owners of historic homes are
exempted from paying capital taxes if they offer
public access to their estates. But as Th o m a s
points out, i t ’s impossible to find out where
these homes are because all information
concerning an individual’s tax affairs is
c o n fid e n t i a l . So he launches an investigation in
Oxfordshire to uncover “ p u b l i c ”e s t a t e s, a n d
then traipses through with a bus full of visitors.
On March 3, 1 9 9 9 , the National Audit Offic e
recommended a review of the monitoring
arrangements for exempt estates.
m Do-it-yourself referendum
In the battle to save local hospitals from
closure under a government privatization
scheme, Thomas unearths an obscure parish
council law which obligates local authorities to
pay for and run a referendum on any issue. The
referendum is not binding but, says Thomas,
represents a powerful tool for local
communities to make their voices heard.After
explaining the details of this law on his TV
show, Thomas reports receiving 5,000 calls
within five days from people interested in
organizing their own referenda. The first has
taken place in Wakefield,a town in northern
England where local hospitals face the threat
of privatization.Over 80 per cent of those
people voting flatly rejected all privatization
schemes. The local organizers are now
launching plans for a national movement. n

c a m p a i g n s ,a d ve rt i s i n g, g ove rnment links to
bu s i n e s s , media collusion and so on.
B e s i d e s , when yo u ’re doing a show on
human rights abuse, for example, I really
don’t see how you can give a torturer the
right to reply.
But maybe the lack of information 
isn’t so much linked to a conspiracy but
simply a consequence of commercializing
news and treating information like
a commodity?
N e w s , especially on television, is a com-
modity packaged into the agenda of those
people (business and political elites) and
their interests. But it shouldn’t be. Infor-
m ation or “ n e w s ” is really about things that
touch your life, t h at shape what you do and
h ave in the wo r l d . You have the right to
improve yourself through access to infor-
m ation—this isn’t an affordable right ava i-
lable to some people but not others.This is
about people’s natural ye a rning to aspire to
a better life and to educate themselve s. A s k
kids what they want to do when they grow
up and they say “Astronaut!”No one says,
“I want to work in a toilet.”
To treat this inform ation as a commodity
is to turn democracy into a joke. If demo-
c r a cy is only about putting a cross on a
ballot paper once eve ry five ye a rs , then it’s
a joke. D e m o c r a cy is not this rigmarole in
which a politician puts on a public relat i o n s
vision on how much you need this person to
be elected. It is not about giving someone
t h at you don’t know a mandate to do what
they wa n t . D e m o c r a cy is about being
i nvo l ved in your community and having the
i n f o rm ation to decide “this is what we wa n t
and this is how we want to get it.”
Some people criticize this view and say
that if you take it to the final degree, you’ll
h ave committees on how to run your street.
I do not have a problem with that.
In your shows, there is always a very clearly
defined “bad guy” or “evil empire.” When
will you turn the spotlight on the
audiences’ own contradictions? The British
government is now recognizing that there
is institutionalized racism in the police
force, for example. Yet people continue to
insist,“We’re not racist.This isn’t our
problem.”
Yo u ’re ve ry right to say that . It is without
a doubt that a majority of people in Bri t a i n ,
at some leve l , are racist. But as a white
man, do I then say, “Right, I’m going to
challenge my own preconceptions on stage.”
I don’t see it as my role as a comedian
to dredge my psyche to bring these things
to the fore. Also if you have a culture of
racism, the lead has to be taken primarily
from the top to stop it. The relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween racism and power is immensely
i m p o rt a n t . So instead of doing a show
a s k i n g, “is my next door neighbour racist?”,
it would be more important to focus on
those people who pretend to be accoun-
table, but aren’t fully accountable.
What do you think of the criticism that the
show attacks the status quo but fails to
offer an alternative?
At the end of about half the show s , we
offer a way of joining in the protest.W h e n
we did the show on the referendum to save
t wo hospitals from pri vat i z ation (see box ) ,
we ended with an offer to help people in
other communities by giving them the
i n f o rm ation to organize their own refe-
r e n d a . F i ve days lat e r , we received 5,000
c a l l s. This isn’t just about challengi n g
a u t h o rity because we have the budget to do
s o — w h i c h , by the way, is ve ry small in
t e rms of television. I t ’s about giving people
i n f o rm at i o n .T h at ’s the starting point for
c h a n g e . As far as I’m concern e d , i t ’s a

‘ D e m o c racy is not this rigmarole in which a politician puts on 
a public relations vision on how much you need this person 
to be elected. It is not about giving someone that you don’t
know a mandate to do what they want. D e m o c racy is about
being involved in your community and having the information to
decide “this is what we want and this is how we want to get it”

We ’re also say i n g, n e ver get nicked,
n e ver get arr e s t e d . So when we produce a
s h ow, e ve rything is done legally. If I get
a rr e s t e d , I’m a TV mart y r. I ’ ve got Channel
4 (see box) law ye rs backing me up to the
h i l t . But if someone is arr e s t e d , t h e y ’re in
t r o u b l e .T h at ’s not what this show is about.
We are not saying that to get invo l ved yo u
h ave to be “ s p e c i a l ” . For example, we ’r e
going to have between 500 and 1,000
people coming on July 4th for a balloon
tour of the Menwith Hill base. And it’s all
l e g a l .The idea is to get people to join in and
take this protest as far as we can.
Doesn’t this work bring a new set of
responsibilities?
Aaahah! May b e . A lot of people write in
a s k i n g,“can you help?”You think,“Hell! My
heart bleeds but there’s nothing I can do.”
Someone wrote in asking for help to get
t r a f fic lights installed in the neighbourhood.
It’s an absurd world when people have to
w rite to a comic for help. But I think the res-
ponsibilities are to the team and to myself
to keep our integrity.
Do you find yourself becoming self-
righteous?
I’m very aware that I now get paid really
we l l . I’m a perform e r , so I’ve got an ego the
size of London. But the programme is not
just about my gr at i fic at i o n .I t ’s about doing
something of worth. To avoid getting too
self-righteous, we kind of undermine the
p r o gr a m m e ’s wo rth by laughing.We ’re not
hard-nosed journalists. But somewhere in
our wo r k , there is truth or part of the tru t h
or a truth.And that’s important to us. But
at the end of the day, we ’re TV monkeys get-
ting paid.
I don’t think we take ours e l ves too
s e riously but we do get obsessed by the
wo r k .When we did the show about Colonel
Halim Nawi [an Indonesian military at t a c h é
who came to London to consult T h o m a s
who was posing as a PR specialist, see box ] ,
I was absolutely obsessed with all the details
in the sting. After the interv i e w, my wife
asked “ W h at did he admit to?” It was incre-
d i b l e , I said—he admitted to using UK mili-
t a ry equipment, to tort u r e , to the death of
ten students and so on. My wife just sat
there and said,“Those poor fa m i l i e s.”At that
m o m e n t , I realized that in all the details I’d
lost sight of what was really at stake.
How do you get people to care about
issues that may not touch them directly?
Human rights groups invest in major
campaigns with giant posters of maimed
and starving children. But rather than
engage people, this often makes them turn
away.
It has to relate to people’s live s. Fo r
e x a m p l e , we went to the arms fair in Greece
disguised as a public relations firm (see
b ox) not to just bring back general fa c t s
about the numbers of weapons sold. We
went to bring home inform ation say i n g,
“these guys are tort u r e rs and they’re using
UK equipment.” We are licensing arm s
abroad which are used for murder, r a p e ,
genocide and torture and yo u, the tax-
p aye r , h ave paid for it.Yo u h ave a choice
h e r e .
A lot of the human rights groups don’t
take this approach of making people res-
p o n s i b l e . Unless you engage people at their
l e vel without being pat r o n i z i n g, you’ll neve r
be ve ry effective . Instead you’ll have a lot of
h a n d - w ri n gi n g .And there’s enough of that
already.
Yo u ’ re like a plague politicians try to
a v o i d . But if the show’s success continues,
a politician with a bit of public re l a t i o n s
savvy could start to ask: “why hasn’t
Mark Thomas come and interviewed me
y e t ? ”
When that time comes,my wife has firm ins-
t ructions on how to use the handgun.
