the salon and bedroom will alert security guards.“ O n l y
in A m e ri c a ,” laughs Michael Sykes, a builder at
H e rs h e y ’s Mill.“ We don’t just sell a home but a lifestyle.
We ’re cat e ring to baby-boomers who feel they’ve
worked hard and deserve a carefree life.” So social
a c t i v i t i e s , from Yiddish classes to bingo,are organized
b e t ween tennis games and a swim at the pool, w h i l e
maintenance crews look after the gardening. G u a r d
p atrols along with wooden and concrete gates enclosing
the community offer a sense of security and prestige.
You wo n ’t find any teenagers blasting their stereos.A t
H e rs h e y ’s Mill,as in other adult communities across the
c o u n t ry, federal law stipulates that 80 per cent of
d wellings for the elderly must be occupied by at least
one person over the age of 55.The remaining 20 per
cent is open to those over 43. But residence is stri c t l y
forbidden for anyone under the age of 18.
“ I t ’s like a resort here,” s ays Tom Carr o l l , a
H e rs h e y ’s Mill resident.“When you get to my age,6 2 ,
l i f e ’s about having fun, f u n , f u n . No more kids to
s u p p o rt or so many things to bu y.”About 80 per cent
of residents are retired.“But that doesn’t mean we ’r e
not bu s y,”s ays Carr o l l ,who proudly unveils the “ B a r b i e
doll house”he is building in the community wo o d - s h o p.
“ I t ’s for the gr a n d k i d s.Eight of the 10 of them live within
20 miles of here.Who needs ’em any closer?”
More people like Carroll are choosing to stay in
adult communities close to where they raised their
families instead of moving to retirement hot-spots like
F l o rida and A ri z o n a . Already about 10 per cent of
A m e ricans over 55 live in these communities and more
are spri n ging up, p a rticularly in nort h e a s t e rn stat e s
like Pe n n s y l vania where about 25 per cent of the
p o p u l ation falls in this age gr o u p.
Not eve ryone is so charmed by the lifestyle.“ We like
d i ve rs i t y,” s ays Bill Hoffman, who has decided not to
m ove in after visiting the community. “It can be
depressing to always be around older people.” C h u c k
Hennessy just signed the mortgage for a new home at
H e rs h e y ’s Mill. “Where I live now, I have all kinds of
n e i g h b o u rs—couples of all colours ,s i n g l e s ,l e s b i a n s. I
like that mixture”, which he wo n ’t find in the
overwhelmingly white new neighbourhood.“But aside
from the occasional part y, there wa s n ’t enough
socializing to miss.”For Lucille Jo r g e n s o n , the lack of
d i ve rsity is compensated by “a sense of oneness”f o r g e d
by common interests.“My husband and I moved here
because we felt comfortable in knowing that if one of
us died,the other would be established in a community
of people our age,with activities we could take part in.”
The downside of such a tightly-knit community lies
in the many rules to follow, c ove ring eve rything from
where kids can play to the obligat o ry white window
c u rtains to ensure a classic look from the outside.“ I t ’s a
problem when our grandkids visit,”s ays Martha Tu rn e y.
“I’m allowed to rollerblade,but my six-year-old gr a n d s o n
i s n ’t .”As her husband Bob explains,“A lot of people have
trouble adjusting to this group mentality but they get ove r
i t .There are also those who just love to argue over the
t rivial rules like where you place a flower pot.But then
a g a i n ,you’ll always find people who need to argue about
s o m e t h i n g .W h at else do they have to do?” ■

At first sight, it looks like a typical middle-class

postage stamp lawns at a starting price of about a
