Argentine men used to earn their family’s keep and rule the domestic
roost. Severe recession has pushed some towards the bench press
2 . PASSING RITES
R
odolfo Fo g w i l l ,aged 59, is one of A r g e n t i n a ’s
best writers. Also a respected sociologist,
he served as a marketing advisor for many
leading companies and claims to have made
up to $30,000 a month in his days as a young
e x e c u t i v e. Yet he is anything but economically home
and dry in Buenos A i r e s.
Car companies and candy manufacturers—his
main clients—have dropped production by about 25
to 30 percent in recent years. Suddenly, Fogwill has
free time on his hands and a black cloud over his
h e a d . He has found two solutions: writing poetry and
intense exercise.“At least I am now producing some
muscle,” he says. “I could work for three pesos an
hour. But you set yourself a price. When you are not
paid that,you have time to spare.”
Clad in a track-suit, he demonstrates his latest
kick-boxing move before talking about his daily
exercise routine. “On a typical day, I walk two
kilometres after getting up and smoking a few
c i g a r e t t e s. Then I do an hour of work at a gym,
followed by push-ups and stretching for about 45
minutes.”
Fogwill may be relatively well-off, but his
quandary—and his muscular solutions—are far from
unique. For the last three years, Argentina has been
stuck in a recession. The turbulence in the local
economy came at a crucial time, just as the country
was trying to adapt to free market reforms. For the
p o c k e t s, the minds and the bodies of men, it has been
a time of harsh austerity and rebuilding.
“ N o r m a l l y, man is the provider in an
underdeveloped society’s handout of roles,” s a y s
labour lawyer Horacio Va l l a , 5 1 . “But what we
consider to be basic necessities in an urban society
have a degree of sophistication that is incompatible
with current salary and unemployment levels.”
Unemployment peaked at 18 percent in 1995.
Currently it stands at 14.7 percent, w h i l e
underemployment languishes at 9.3 percent according
to the national statistics bureau.
Precarious
identities
Browse through a newspaper and you can find the
human stories behind the cold fig u r e s. S t e w a r d e s s e s,
pilots and mechanics engaged in a labour confli c t
with the former state-run Aerolineas A r g e n t i n a s
recently spewed onto the main runway of the
Metropolitan A i r p o r t , outside Buenos A i r e s. A
struggle with riot police ensued. By the end of the
n i g h t , a pilot had a black eye and blood stains on the
gold bars of his blue uniform jacket.The pilot, with 22
years of service, was later interviewed on television.
This is the message beamed out on the evening news:
the country is hurting and it is grown men, those who
had a career and more mundane concerns only a
decade ago, who are taking the punches.
It used to be very different.According to Emilio
C a f a s s i , head of the sociology department at the
University of Buenos A i r e s, men formerly dominated
the country’s social life in a “classic Vi c t o r i a n
structure” until around the 1930s. Only in 1926, for
instance, was the woman formally allowed to work
without the permission of her husband or father.As
for the men,writer Luis Medrano speculated half a
century ago that they could be conveniently divided
into two classes: those who go to football matches and
those who go to horse races.
N o w, h o w e v e r, economic free-fall has brought
redundancies and a particular crisis for men,whose
“self-esteem is linked to institutional recognition,”
argues Cafassi.“Never in capitalism has there been
such a degree of social vulnerability.’’
For men trying to meet the standards of a highly
White-collar malaise: jobless lining up in Buenos Aires.

developed urban society, building muscle in the
gymnasium or elsewhere can come as a relief and
reassertion of their precarious identity. But it’s not
only men trapped in a situation of economic check-
mate who take to the weights.
Fabián Casas, a 36-year-old editor at El Gráfico,
the country’s leading sports magazine, claims that
the publication also has its share of economic tension.
Exercise is a vital part of his routine since he took the
job three years ago. Casas, who is single, talks about
pressure and a growing existential void.“If I didn’t
produce some muscle, I would
go nuts,” he says.
Others, who have lost their
steady jobs, simply refuse to be
absorbed by the market again.
Gustavo López, 4 0 , was laid off
two years ago from the power
utility he worked for in Bahía
B l a n c a , a port city of almost
300,000 inhabitants. “I went
from making 2,500 pesos a month to having no
income,” he says.
López used his severance pay to open a “cultural
c e n t r e ” in a downtown venue that was once a butcher’s
s h o p.Night activities include ethnic music concerts and
Indian food.“All the family helps out,” he says. But his
body also feels the strain.“Right now I’m tired because
the change from one activity to another is physically
d e m a n d i n g.” Only one thing remains as steady as
ever:playing football twice a week.
“Men are under double pressure, because they do
not meet demands due to unemployment, or because
the salary they make is insuffic i e n t . Some men are able
to respond, but without fully satisfying the
expectations women have of their role,”Valla says.
Besides losing their traditional role as family
b r e a d w i n n e r s, competition for employment from
women has soared. Cafassi reports that there are now
more female university students than male ones, w h i l e
the number of women who head households is growing.
“Masculine problems are
c h a n g i n g.Stress produced by auto
workers manning production lines
used to trigger sexual problems at
home.Today production lines are
s l o w e r,but the problems produced
by unemployment are more
fierce,” he adds.
Alejandro Belloni,3 6 ,was out
of work for over a year before his
sister found him a job as a hospital cleaner. He makes
1,50 pesos ($1.50) an hour, and works 12 hours a day,
six days a week. B e l l o n i , who lives with family, says he
felt the demands of what he described as a machista
society when he was out of work. “ For women it is
e a s i e r, but men are expected to give support.” He now
feels more comfortable when he dates women. B u t
habits change. When out of work, he used to enjoy
drinking beer with his friends at a corner kiosk.Now
he has quit drinking—and shed several kilograms of
weight. ■

some muscle,
I would go nuts.”
