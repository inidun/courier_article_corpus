r The winding ochre-coloured
dirt road runs for several
kilometres between two walls oftall
golden grass broken by occasional
burnt clearings. A hornbill takes
off in flight. A family of warthogs
ambles by. This is the vast Niokolo-
Koba National Park, created in
Senegal in 1926 and one of the first
in Africa. The 913,000-hectare
park, the central part of which is
completely protected, is adminis¬
tered under the programme for the
management of the Upper Niger
and Gambia river valleys.
The importance of Niokolo-
Koba, which contains exception¬
ally rich animal life, came to be
seen when it was classified as a
UNESCO biosphere reserve and a
World Heritage natural site in
1981. It receives some 3,000 visi¬
tors a year and, with the neigh¬
bouring park at Badiar in Guinea,
will soon form a large transnational
biosphere reserve.
SIMENTI POOL
At Simenti, in the middle of the
park, there is a hotel, a camp for
game wardens and a viewing plat¬
form overlooking the wide, muddy
Gambia river, which flows lazily
between stands of bamboo linked
to giant trees by tangles of flower¬
ing creepers. A troop of green mon¬
keys scamper about in them. Fur¬
ther away, on a sand spit, are a fish
eagle and a herd of guib (tragela-
phus), a species of harnessed ante¬
lope with a white-spotted or
striped coat.
The pool at Simenti a natural
depression of stagnant water
formed at a bend in the river is
replenished in the dry season by
pumping. A large number of ani¬
mals go there to drink. During the
dry season the last traces of green¬
ery are also to be found there.
From the viewing platform, all
kinds of antelopes (giant or Derby
eland, roan antelope, Buffon's kob
and Defassa waterbuck), warthogs
and aquatic birds can be seen. The
common enemy here is mimosa
pigru, a prickly thorn bush which
is slowly encroaching on the grass
on which the animals live. Ele¬
phants, lions and panthers also
roam the park. Unfortunately,
poaching is widespread. Shortly
before I arrived, the game wardens
had rescued a pair of baby pan¬
thers whose mother had been shot.
They are now living in captivity at
the camp, but lack of funds means
they have to feed on a diet of only
one goat every three days!
OPEN AND
LATENT WARFARE
Poachers keep the 150 game war¬
dens on a war footing. Already
eight wardens have been shot dead
and five others wounded. Three
soldiers have also been killed. The
day we were leaving, poachers were
reported nearby. How did the
game wardens spot them in the
dense vegetation? They found
bicycle tyre marks in the ashes of
a clearing where a fire had been
lit to help the pasture to grow
back. Hunters, who spend months
at a time in very remote areas,
obtain water and food from vil¬
lagers who travel around on bicy¬
cles and in return take back
slaughtered game to their villages.
The poachers are better armed
than the game wardens. More than
93 per cent of the wardens are also
due to retire in 2002, which wor¬
ries Lieutenant Boucar Ndiaye.
Unless new ones are engaged, there
will only be ten wardens to watch
over almost a million hectares.
Money is a big problem. The war¬
dens have only three vehicles with
badly worn tyres, no radios and not
even a chainsaw.
The situation is the same on the
Guiñean side. Fifty game wardens
fresh from a new training centre at

Dalaba have not been hired
because there is no budget for
them. The Badiar park, which is
also new, is gradually losing all its
wildlife to hunting by people from
nearby villages, many ofwhom have
kept the weapons which the late
dictator Ahmed Sékou Touré dis¬
tributed to people's militias.
BITTERN ESS AND POVERTY
The biggest enemy of conservation
efforts in both Senegal and Guinea
is poverty. IIow can you tell a man
whose children are hungry that he
must not kill the antelope or
guinea fowl he comes across?
When the Niokolo park was
created, five villages inside its
boundaries were moved fifty kilo¬
metres away. The villagers are still
bitter about this. In the park, the
soil was richer, the yield from
orchards was at its peak and hunt¬
ing flourished. They had to leave
their ancestral cemeteries behind

them. The mausoleum of the Badi
village shrine is now in ruins and is
being slowly engulfed by a giant
kapok tree.
Abdourahmane Samoura, head
of a United States-funded natural
resources management project, is
aware of the problem. "We now
have to make up for past mis¬
takes," he says. But how? "We
can't bring the villagers back," says
Lieutenant Ndiaye. "If we did, in
less than two years there wouldn't
be a single animal left in the park."
MICRO-PROJECTS AND
DEVELOPMENT
A considerable effort is being made
in both Senegal and Guinea to
develop micro-projects in villages
on the edge of the parks in a bid to
compensate for the frustration of
the inhabitants. This includes rais
ing guinea-fowl, fish farming, bee¬
keeping, market gardening, seed
production and the setting up of
nurseries. OusmaneandMariam are
two young agronomists responsible
for convincing the villagers, whose
language they speak, of the need
for these projects. They are not try¬
ing to impose ready-made solutions
but listen instead to what people
want and then try to find a way of
delivering it.
Beekeeping creates jobs. Car¬
penters are needed to build the
hives, blacksmiths to produce
smokers, tailors to make special
clothing. The honey can also save
the palmyra if mead, a drink made
of honey and water, can replace
the popular alcoholic drink made
from the sap of these 20-metre-
tall palm trees. The sap is

drained tree, which takes 20 years
to grow to its full height and can
live as long as 70 years, quickly
dies. Everything about this palm
tree species is useful its wood is
good for timber, its leaves for roofs
and its stalks for fences and fur¬
niture. Its fruit can he eaten raw or
grilled. All these uses are a threat
to its survival. Even though heavy
fines and even prison sentences can
be imposed for cutting down the
trees, felling continues.
The central area of the Samba
Dia biosphere consists of a pro¬
tected palm forest which has for¬
tunately been saved from the
woodcutters. No poachers are
found there either "because there
is no game," says Abdul Diallo, who
supervises the forest without the
help of a vehicle or even a tele¬
phone. Be relies on inter-village
watch committees who let him
know of any illegal felling.
The reserve's buffer zone is by
contrast an uncontrolled mix of
farming activity. The outer area is
in a very poor state. Despite a ban,
the villagers let their animals stray
there, jeopardizing the growth of

10,000 young palms planted in
1997. This is a serious problem for
Diallo who, to pay the reserve's
labour force consisting of six work¬
ers engaged for a period of six
months, last year sold 212,000
saplings and is trying to market
seeds all over the country.
MISSION
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
On the border with Gambia is the
Sine-Saloum Delta biosphere
reserve, centred on two rivers
which split up into countless
waterways fringed by mangroves.

WHAT ARE BIOSPHERE RESERVES?
Biosphere reserves are geographic areas considered typical of the balanced relationship between
people and nature. As of April 1997, 337 Reserves in 85 countries met the criteria for this desig¬
nation laid down within Unesco's "Man and the Biosphere" (MAB) Programme. They combine three
functions:
«"safeguarding samples of the earth's landscapes, plant and animal species and ecosystems;
«-fostering economic development that is ecologically and culturally sustainable;
support for research, monitoring, training and education relating to local, regional
and global conservation issues.
The reserves form a world network within which information, experience and personnel are
exchanged. They contribute to meeting the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity
and the Agenda 21 Programme that resulted from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Envi¬
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro.
HOW ARE THEY ORGANIZED?
A core area needs to be legally established and ensure long-term protection for the landscape,
ecosystem and species it contains.
The limits of a buffer zone around the core must be clearly demarcated. Human activities in this
a rea should not run counter to the conservation objectives of the core area. This may be an area
for experimental research into appropriate methods of managing the ecosystem.
A transition area, or area of co-operation, extends outwards from the reserve. It is here that local
communities and other stakeholders must agree to work together to manage and develop the area's
resources on a sustainable basis.
For fuller details, see "The world network of biosphere reserves" in the May 1997
issue of the Unesco Courier, Landscape with Figures (pp. 36-37).
includes the dry forest of Fathala,
which has splendid trees but little
animal life. Its manager, Major
Jacques Rigoulot, who was already
in charge of the area before the
Senegalese army took it over as a
training ground, has been recalled
to carry out an almost impossible
mission. His task is to rebuild the
burned-down camp, close the
twenty sawmills-cum-woodwork
factories in the area and set up
partnerships with the villages on
the edge of the reserve.
The taxes levied on gathering
dead wood have earned the villages
a million CFA francs ($1,700) in
ten months a lot of money in
Senegal which paid for improve¬
ments in water supply, schools and
clinics. But Rigoulot is bitter.
There is no longer a drop of drink¬
ing water in the reserve since its
single well was contaminated by
sea water, and he has no money to
dig another one. He also badly
needs solar panels to provide
energy for lighting.
However, the results of work¬
ing with the local communities
have been very positive. In the vil¬
lage of Bakadadji, inside the
reserve, Rigoulot helps women to
harvest oysters, whose roasted
shells make good-quality bricks.
Like his opposite number at
Samba Dia, Abdul Diallo, he (and
the village women) could do with
some kind of transport a boat,
for example, since four-fifths of
the reserve consists of mangroves,
inlets and islands.
On the edge of the reserve, just
as at Niokolo, vast areas some¬
times whole islands, which are the
homes of birds have been leased
to foreigners. The local population
derives no benefit from this , except
in the form of payment for guides.
Lieutenant Ndiaye says that if the
villagers were the only people
allowed to hunt, poaching would
certainly be reduced. But defend¬
ing nature is an uphill job that is
made even harder by lack of
resources. This makes the deter¬
mination of Boucar Ndiaye, Abdul
Diallo and Jacques Rigoulot all
the more impressive. I
