“What we call ‘the water problem’ in Spain
is going to become ‘the water war,’ ”
predicted Spanish ecologist José Manuel
Naredo in 1997. Three years later, t h e
400,000 people who marched through the
streets of Zaragoza (a town of 650,000
inhabitants) on October 8 appeared to
prove him right. Their target was the
National Water Plan (NWP), unveiled by
the government on September 5.
The plan’s centrepiece is the diversion
of a billion cubic metres of water each
year from the River Ebro to occasionally
or permanently arid regions on the
c o u n t r y ’s Mediterranean coast. Fo r
inhabitants of the province of A r a g ó n ,
the 700,000 million pesetas (more than
$3.5 billion) that the government intends
to spend on building 529 kilometres of
new waterways and several dams are
simply 700,000 drops of water in a cup
that is already spilling over.
Aragón feels robbed. The 400,000
demonstrators may have been
exaggerating a little when they shouted
that the waters of “our Ebro” would be
used to keep golf courses green, f i l l
swimming pools for tourists and supply
amusement parks while others die of
thirst and neglect. But as Naredo
o b s e r v e s, “people no longer accept the
mainstay of Spanish water policy for the
last century, of taking water where you
find it and transferring it to where it’s
needed.”
The opponents of the NWP have
stepped up their attacks. They say water
supplies can no longer be managed on
technical criteria alone. The planned
diversions are dangerous, they argue,
because the Ebro basin has not had a
water surplus for the past quarter of a

When the rain in Spain 
is not enough
Spain uses vast quantities of water. To meet its country’s needs, the government 
has resorted to technical solutions such as diverting the Ebro river
—a project that many people have condemned for squandering a precious resource

c e n t u r y.
But their main criticism is that the
diversion of the river is completely
u n n e c e s s a r y. Economic history teacher
Enric Tello believes the answer to Spain’s
water problems lies in “reorganizing the
s u p p l y.” He argues that the country is
suffering from “water schizophrenia” a n d
that “sooner or later taxpayers will wonder
why they are still subsidizing the irrigation
of crops that are already being subsidized
and are often produced in excessive
q u a n t i t i e s.”
This “schizophrenia” arises, he says,
from the huge gap between the price of
water for irrigation, which is almost free,
and the much higher cost of water used in
cities and industries. So why not try to
narrow that gap? The answer could lie
in a small detail that both Tello and
Naredo point to: Environment Minister
Jaume Matas launched the NWP at the
headquarters of the Public Wo r k s
Employers’ Federation.
The ministry offers a quite different
s p i n .O f ficials say demand for water will
keep on growing and requires the building
of costly aqueducts. They agree that the
irrigated area of around 3.5 million
hectares should not be increased, b u t
defend the river diversion plan and talk of
building more than 70 new dams at a cost
of three thousand billion pesetas (about
$15.5 billion) over eight years.All of which
clashes with a European Union directive
d e fining every water catchment area as a
distinct management unit and ruling out
water transfers from one area to another.
But the ministry insists it is no longer
possible to “ g o
b a c k w a r d s,”
declaring that the
NWP “will solve the
water problem for
g o o d .” S p a i n ’s 1,070
big dams already
make it the world’s
leading country in
terms of proportion
of dam-created lakes
to total land mass.
The fact is, h o w e v e r,
that many serve no
p u r p o s e, since for months on end they
are filled to only five or 10 percent
c a p a c i t y.
Spain began its first major river
diversion scheme in the 1960s by linking
the Tagus in the west and centre-west to
the Segura in the southeast—a transfer of
600 million cubic metres of water a year.
But in 1999, the province of Castilla,
which the Tagus flows through, refused to
supply a drop more than 40 million cubic
m e t r e s, less than 10 percent of the amount
originally planned.
What had happened? Maize growing,
which requires a lot of water,expanded in
the regions along the Tagus (the Mancha
and the Meseta). To irrigate today’s
150,000 hectares of maize, you need to
draw heavily on underground water and
also pump more from the Ta g u s. I n
Murcia (watered by the Segura), which
benefits from the diversion scheme,
irrigated areas have grown enormously.
Biologist José Luis Benito notes that
“absurd though it might seem, t h e
diversion of the Tagus has turned a
hitherto occasional and irregular drought
into a systematic and permanent one.”
Forty million hectares of Spain have
a Mediterranean climate. Because the
rainy season and warm weather do not
c o i n c i d e, there is little vegetation. P l a n t i n g
m a i z e,a l f a l f a , potatoes and beans in such
a climate is not a particularly sound idea
because these crops depend upon a lot of
w a t e r. In the Mancha, for instance, it takes
a tonne of water to produce a kilo of
m a i z e. If water was not subsidized, a s
Pedro Arrojo has noted in his study of the
irrigated regions of A r a g ó n ,90 percent of
this land could not be profitably farmed.
This has led the historian Tello into
calling for a new agricultural policy based
around sustainable development which
would preserve subsidies for “ m a i n t a i n i n g
balanced land use and other social and
environmental reasons,”but hand out the
aid directly to farms rather than using it to
bring down the price
of water, fuel and
chemical fertilizers.
If water for
irrigation were not
100 times cheaper
than water for
i n d u s t r y, c r o p s
unsuited to Spain’s
climate would be
a b a n d o n e d .But Te l l o
has proposed a
solution already
adopted in the United
States through the California Water Bank.
This “ m a r k e t ” allows farmers, at certain
times of the year, to re-sell some of their
water stocks to cities that need it.B e c a u s e
they make money from this, they can then
grow crops that need less water, even if
they are less profit a b l e. So the cities get
the water they need,the farmers do not lose
money and water resources are not over-
u s e d .
Of the one billion cubic metres of
water that will be diverted under the
NWP, 300 million will go to the Valencia
region, 430 million to Murcia, 90 to the
Andalusian province of Almería and 180
to Catalonia.But the latter has no water
shortage, and is unlikely to have one for
at least another 25 years judging by its

current population growth. Naredo adds
that after Barcelona’s preparations for
the 1992 Olympic Games,which involved
shutting down old industrial plants that
consumed a lot of water,“the city’s water
table rose to the point that it had to pump
water out to avoid flooding the subway
and underground parking lots.”
Tello has looked into the potential
b e n e fits of “a system that would penalize
waste and encourage saving and recy c l i n g
w a t e r.” Whenever industry has realized
water can cost it 10 times less through
careful planning, it has changed its
patterns of use.Tello has also shown that
investing 100,000 pesetas (about $500) to
equip every household in Catalonia with
electrical and water appliances that can
save and re-use water would be cheaper
than a projected scheme to channel water
from the River Rhône, in southern Fr a n c e,
to Barcelona, at a cost of around 200
billion pesetas (more than $1 billion).
Taxing water in a more consistent way
would solve another big problem: that of
outdated piping.Pedro Arrojo has noted
that the water network in Zaragoza was
so leaky that no difference was registered
between daytime and nighttime
c o n s u m p t i o n . In the market gardening
area around Valencia, the price farmers
pay for water is fixed by the amount of
land they need to irrigate, meaning that
losses caused by faulty piping are
generally ignored. Another example is
the Jucar imperial canal, which is built
directly in the earth and results in massive
leakage.
The second largest ecological
reserve under threat
Spain gets 346 billion cubic metres of
rainfall each year, of which 109 billion
remains after evaporation. This should
be enough to meet an annual demand of
35 billion cubic metres,80 per cent of it for
agriculture, which usually pays one peso
per cubic metre.
In areas where the price of water for
irrigation is higher (30 pesetas a cubic
metre) because it comes from
desalination plants or from underground,
farming is very sophisticated. A l m e r í a ,
which 20 years ago was Spain’s poorest
p r o v i n c e, is today the country’s fastest
growing one and relies upon the most
foreign labour (which is neither
welcomed nor assimilated). B e c a u s e
yields are very high, the province has
13,000 hectares of land that are illegally
irrigated.
The diversion of the Ebro is an
ineffective response to Spain’s cultural,
social,political and economic problems.
Opponents of the scheme say it even
creates new difficulties:the defenders of
the environment are especially worried
that the Ebro delta, the country’s second
biggest ecological reserve, m i g h t
disappear.
Since the end of the 19th century,
sediment in the river has dropped by 95
p e r c e n t .As a result, the government has to
invest about 20 billion pesetas ($100
million) to add sand to some beaches.O n e
thing is nevertheless certain: i f
d e s e r t i fication continues to advance in
S p a i n , the country will not be needing extra
