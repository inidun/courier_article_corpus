The Cry, a recent
carving by a Makonde
sculptor from Mo¬
zambique. Using the
natural shape of an
ebony branch, the ar¬
tist has created a
symbolic motif of
fertility.

plateau astride the frontier between
Tanzania to the north and Mozam¬

the wide valley of the Ruvuma River
(see map page 6). Colonial partition
in Africa brought the Makonde
under the rule of different European
powers. In 1964, with the creation
of the Republic of Tanzania, the
Makonde to the north of the Ruvuma
became free citizens of the new

state. Those still living in Mozam¬
bique remained subject to Portu¬
guese control. Makonde resistance
to colonial rule began in 1960 but
was brutally suppressed. In the
armed conflict that followed, the
Makonde gave many freedom fight¬
ers to the war waged against the
Portuguese by the Mozambique
Liberation Front (FRELIMO). At the
same time thousands were forced
into exile in Tanzania where two-
thirds of the 500,000 Makonde
people now live. On its isolated
plateau, the ancient Makonde cul¬
ture has brought forth a remarkable
flowering of sculptured art. A closely
knit, traditional farming people, the
Makonde havedeveloped their wood-
carving skills over many centuries.
For them wood is a material imbued
with force and sacred meaning, and
one of their legends tells how their
first father carved with his hands
the wood out of which the first
mother came to life. Today most
of their sculpture is in the ebony
that abounds in East Africa, a noble
wood but difficult to carve because
of its extreme hardness. Using the
natural form of branch or root, the
i Makonde sculptor can conjure forth
realistic everyday ¡mages or symbols
of rare abstraction. Modern
Makonde art is a unique achievement
as much for its rich variety of styles
as for the abundance of works.
During the past 15 years it has
known an even richer flowering
that of a traditional art delving
into its past while realistically adapt¬
ing itself to modern conditions.
Here we present a few examples of
today's Makonde sculpture in wood.
(1) From the root of an ebony tree,
the artist has depicted an antelope
and a snake (the snake in Makonde
mythology symbolically links the
worlds of the living and the dead).
(2) A herd of antelopes (elongated
shapes of many Makonde carvings
are determined by the sculptor's
choice of wood). (3) Hope of
motherhood. The wished-for child
is shown on the woman's head. In
the Makonde matriarchal society,
women symbolize the continuity
of life. (4-5) Rear and profile views
of an embracing couple whose
masked faces (5) symbolize the
spoken word. (6) Woman, symbol
of fertility, a work whose harmony
of line and movement recalls the
carving; on our back cover.
