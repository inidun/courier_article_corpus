important dates on desertification 
in unesco and the united nations.
1947 
The Director-General of UNESCO 
suggests that comprehensive 
international laboratories for the arid 
zone should be established within the 
United Nations system. 
1948 
The 3rd UNESCO General 
Conference in Beirut (Lebanon) adopts 
a resolution proposed by India 
to examine the possibility of an 
international institute for the arid zone. 
The Central Arid Zone Research 
Institute (CAZRR) in Jodhpur (India) 
is launched with the support 
of UNESCO in 1959.

A group of experts meets in Paris 
(France) and recommends 
the establishment of an international 
advisory committee. 
1951
The Advisory Committee on Arid Zone 
Research holds its first session in 
Algiers. Composed of 15 members 
from different countries, this is the 
origin of UNESCO’s Arid Zone 
Research Programme. 
1957
The research programme is upgraded 
to a Major Project on Scientific 
Research on Arid Lands. 
1965 
The Advisory Committee on Natural 
Resources Research holds its first 
session, replacing the earlier 
committees on arid zones 
and the humid tropics. 
1968 
An intergovernmental conference 
on the “scientific basis for rational use 
and conservation of the resources 
of the biosphere” meets in Paris, 
focusing on all the world’s ecosystems. 
1971
The international coordinating council 
of the new Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) Programme holds 
its first meeting. 
1973 
The UN sets up the Sudano-Sahelian 
Office to spearhead efforts to reverse 
the spread of desertification in West 
Africa. Over 200,000 people died, 
as well as millions of their animals, 
in the drought which began in 1968. 
1976 
In cooperation with the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP), 
UNESCO begins a 12-year 
Integrated Project on Arid Lands (IPAL) 
in northern Kenya to improve traditional 
livestock farming systems. 
1977 
The UN Conference on 
Desertification meets in Nairobi (Kenya) 
and adopts an action plan to combat 
desertification. UNESCO’s 
contribution includes a new map 
of the world’s arid and semi-arid 
regions. 
1980 
UNESCO and UNEP initiate 
a second integrated project on arid 
lands, this time in southern Tunisia, 
to update research findings on the 
region and put them to better use. 
This project is to last five years. 
Similar projects follow in the 1980s 
and 1990s in Lesotho and in various 
West African countries. 
1992 
The UN Conference on  
Environment and Development, 
also known as the Earth Summit, 
is held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).  
Its Agenda 21 calls on the General 
Assembly to preparea legally-binding 
instrument on the problem 
of desertification. 
1994 
The UN Convention to Combat 
Desertification (UNCCD) is adopted 
in Paris on 17 June. The same day 
is proclaimed World Day to Combat 
Desertification. 
1996 
The Convention enters into force on 
26 December, after 50 ratifications are

1999 
The Convention’s permanent 
secretariat opens its doors

UNESCO and UNCCD launch the 
“Education Kit on Combating 
Desertification” for use in primary 
schools. The kit now exists 
in nine languages. 
2002 
The World Summit on Sustainable 
Development in Johannesburg 
(South Africa) calls on the Global 
Environment Facility to become 
Convention’s financial mechanism. 
2004
The comparative research project 
“Sustainable Management of Marginal 
Drylands (SUMAMAD)” is launched. 
Linking eight countries from China to 
Tunisia, it is sponsored by UNESCO, 
the United Nations University (UNU), 
the International Center for Agricultural 
Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) 
and the Flemish Government 
of Belgium. 
2006
The UN General Assembly proclaims
