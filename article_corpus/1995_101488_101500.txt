THE HAGUE
ACADEMY OF
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
One of the world's most prestigious centres for the
study and teaching of public and private interna¬
tional law, The Hague Academy of Intenational Law is
distinguished by a spirit of freedom and respect for
others which is very close to that of the great interna¬
tional organizations and especially to the United
Nations and its judicial organ, the International Court
of Justice.
Founded in 1913 in Paris, it began its work in 1923
in The Hague, at the Peace Palace, which is also the
seat of the International Court of Justice. Its aim is to
spread and deepen knowledge of international law in
order to promote peace and goodwill between peoples
and to help to ensure that disputes between states are
solved through negotiation and not through violence.
Lectures are given at the Peace Palace by well-
known lawyers from all regions of the world and cover
the theory and practice of international law as well as
international legislation and jurisprudence.
The Collected Courses of the Academy, amounting
to over 230 volumes, form a unique collection which
enjoys very high prestige. In co-operation with the
United Nations University (UNU), the Academy has
organized workshops on major themes of concern to
governments all over the world.
The Academy's external programme enables it to
extend its promotional activities in international law in
support of peace and human rights to Africa, Latin
America and Asia.
The working languages of the Academy are French
and English.
