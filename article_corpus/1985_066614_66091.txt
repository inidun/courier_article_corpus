The life of the mind
Clement Attlee (later Earl Attlee, 1883-
1967)
"In the new world order towards which
we are moving it is essential that we
should have appropriate machinery to
deal with each of the major fields of
human activity (.,,) However we cIassify
the principal elements in the public life of
the world it would be impossible to ex-
clude from our classification that large
and significant field of activity which can
be described broadly as the life of the
mind. This covers not only the special
field of education in ail its branches and at
ail its stages, it includes the whole intel-
lectual realm with its'many goodty states
and kingdoms', the sciences, the humani-
ties, the fine arts, research for the
advancement of knowledge and the
who) e vast territory in which ideas are
disseminated. The field of educational
and cultural relationships is surely one of
the richest and most significant in the
internationallife of the world, We cannot
be content until our new world organiza-
tion provides for the fullest and most
beneficent development of these re-
tationships. Do not wars, after ale, begin
in the minds of men ?"
Clement R, Attlee
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
London, 1 November 1945
Below and on the opposite page we present extracts from four
speeches made during thé"Conférence for the Establishment
of an Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of the
United Nations", held in London from 1 to 16 November
1945.
Ellen Wilkinson (1891-1947) addressing a
peace rally in Trafalgar Square, London
"We are met at the end of the greatest
war in history, against the background of
two continents with their attendant
islands, across which the fires of war have
raged. Even now the embers stiiï glow,
and here and there the flames stiH fticker.
AU of us here-all the nations that we
represent-have taken some part in this
great struggle. AU have ranged them-
selves under the flag of freedom and
against aggression and oppression. Many
of us have drunk together from a com-
mon cup of sorrow and sacrifice. Now we
are met together ; workers in education,
in scientific research and in the varied
fields of culture. We represent those who
teach, those who discover, those who
write, those who express their inspiration
in music and art. We have a high respon-
sibility, for entrusted to us is the task of
creating some part-and not the least
important part- {) f that structure of the
United Nations on which rest our hopes
for the future of mankind. It is for us to
clear the channels through which may
flow from nation to nation the streams of
knowledge and thought, of truth and
beauty which are the foundations of true
civilisation."

President of the Conference
Minister of Education, United Kingdom

1952) with a group of exchange students.
"We believe that the intellectualism of
the eighteenth century and the material-
ism of the nineteenth should give place in
the twentieth to the conception of a true
and balanced integration of man. That is
why-while the education of the intellec-
tua) faculties was the chief concern of
those systems which are now obsolete,
and while the education of the will has
resulted in extremes of imperialism that
we condemn-the horizons now open to
our view will demand of us a form of
education aiming at international co-
operation through the medium of truth,
virtue in aM its significance, and
democracy."
Jaime Torres Bodet
Delegate of Mexico
London, 2 November 1945
"Our duty wi)) be more completely de-
fined when our charter has been adopted
by ai) the United Nations, and when, on
what 1 hope may not be a far distant day,
we have the great Soviet Republic in our
midst (..,), We shaH never lose sight of
the fact, so adequately expressed at the
opening of our deliberations, that it is not
the sum of knowledge that is to be the
distinguishing mark of the activities of
our future Organization, but the develop-
ment of culture. One of our great authors
has said :'Science without conscience is
but the ruin of the sou\.'We can say :
'Know) edge without morality can only
result in barbarism,'We who know that
there can be no democracy without cul-
ture, will direct our efforts towards
adding something else to knowledge : a
great ideal, a ctear vision of the great
problems to be solved in the cause of
international peace and, lastly, and
perhaps most important of ale, the mas-
tery of self."

Delegate of France
