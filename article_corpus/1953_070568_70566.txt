LOOKING AT LIFE WITH
THE EYES OF A CHilD
by Henri Matisse
CREATION is the artist's true function ; where there is no creation
there is no art. But it would be a mistake to ascribe this crea-
tive power to an inborn talent. In art, the genuine creator is
not just a gifted being, but a man'who has succeeded in
arranging, for their appointed end, a complex of activities, of which
the work of art is the outcome.
Thus, for the
artist creation be-
gins with vision.
To see is itself a
creative operation,
requiring an effort.
Everything that we
see in our daily life
is more or less dis-
torted by acquired
habits, and this is
perhaps more evi-
dent in an age like
ours when the cin-
ema posters and
magazines present
us every day with
a flood of ready-
made images
which are to the
eye what prejudi-
ces are to the mind.
The effort needed
to see things with-
out distortion takes
something very like
courage ; and this
courage is essential
to the artist, who
has to look at every-
thing as though
he saw it for the
first time : he has to
look at life as he
did'when he was a
child and, if he lo-
ses that faculty, he
cannot express
himself in an ori-
ginal, that is, a per-
sonal way.
To take an exam-
ple. Nothing, I
think, is more dif-
ficult for a true
painter than two
paint a rose, becau-
se, before he can do
so, he has first to
forget all the roses
that were ever
painted. I h a v e
often asked visitors
who came to see
me at Vence whe-
ther they had noti-
ced the thistles by
the side of the road.
Nobody had seen
them ; they would
all have recognized
the leaf of an
acanthus on a Co-
rinthian capital, but
the memory of the
capital prevented
them from seeing
the thistle in nature.
The first step to-
wards creation is to
see everything as it
Thus a work of art is the climax of a long work of preparation.
The artist takes from his surroundings everything that can nourish
his internal vision, either directly, when the object he is drawing is
to appear in his composition, or by analogy. In this way he puts
himself into a position where he can create. He enriches himself
internally with all the forms he has mastered and which he will one
aay set to a new
rhythm.
It is in the ex-
pression of this
rhythm that the
artist's work beco-
mes really creative.
To achieve it, he
will have to sift
rather than accu-
mulate details, se-
lecting for exam-
ple, from all possi-
ble combinations,
the line that expres-
ses most and gives
life to the drawing ;
he will have to
seek the equivalent
terms by which the
facts of nature are
transposed into art.
In mv"Still Life
with Magnolia", I
painted a green
marble table red ;
in another place I
had to use black to
suggest the reflec-
tion of the sun on
the sea ; all these
transpositions were
not in the least
matters of chance
or whim, but were
the result of a se-
ries of investiga-
tions, following
which these colours
seemed to me to be
necessary, because
of their relation to
the rest of the com-
position, in order
to give the impres-
sion I wanted. Co-
lours and lines are
forces, and the se-
cret of creation lies
in the play and ba-
lance of those for-
ces.
In the chapel at
Vence, which is the
outcome of earlier
researches of mine,
I have tried to
achieve that balan-
ce of forces ; the
blues, greens and
yellows of the
windows compose
a light within the
chapel, which is not
strictly any of the
colours used, but is
the living product
of their mutual
blending ; this light
made up of colours
is intended to play
"Freedom of expression, freedom in the choice of subject, composition and colours, and in the tempo of
work. The child must follow his own thought, and he will find an original form in which to express it acc-
ording to his passion and his enthusiasm. In painting, as nowhere else to such an extent, the chi ! d is alone
with himself."-Arno Stern, Director of L'Academie du Jeudi, Paris. (Photo copyright Denise Colomb.)
upon the white and black-stencilled surface of the wall facing the
windows, on which the lines are purposely set wide apart. The
contrast allows me to give the light its maximum vitalizing
value, to make it the essential element, colouring, warming and
animating the whole structure, to which it is desired to give an
impression of boundless space despite its small dimensions.
Throughout the chapel, every line and every detail contributes to
that impression.
That is the sense, so it seems to me, in which art may be said to
imitate nature, namely, by the life that the creative worker infuses
into the work of art. The work will then appear as fertile and as
possessed of the same power to thrill, the same resplendent beauty
as we find in works of nature.
Great love is needed to achieve this effect, a love capable of
inspiring and sustaining that patient striving towards truth, that
glowing warmth and that analytic profundity that accompany the
birth of any work of art. But is not love the origin of all creation ?
(Text recorded by RÃ©gine Pel'llolld.)
really is, and that demands a constant effort. To create is to express
what we have within ourselves. Every genuine creative effort comes
from within. \Ve have also to nourish our feeling, and we can do so
only with materials derived from the world about us. This is the
process whereby the artist incorporates and gradually assimilates
the external world within himself, until the object of his drawing
has become like a part of his being, until he has it within him and
can project it on to the canvas as his own creation.
When I paint a portrait, I come back again and again to
my sketch and every time it is a new portrait that I am painting :
not one that I am improving, but a quite different one that I am
beginning over again ; and every time I extract from the same
person a different being.
In order to make my study more complete, I have often had
recourse to photographs of the same person at different ages ; the
final portrait may show that person younger or under a different
aspect from that'which he or she presents at the time of sitting,
and the reason is that that is the aspect : which seemed to me the
truest, the one which revealed most of the sitter's real personality.
