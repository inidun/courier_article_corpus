The scene is set in Sowe t o, one of Jo h a n-

Jean-François Duroure, a white French
dancer trained in A n g e rs (France) and at
the schools of German choreographer Pina
Bausch and A m e ricans Merce Cunningham
and Viola Fa b e r , is trying to explain his pro-
ject to a group of young street dancers. He
speaks in broken English which his listeners
do not fully understand.The look on their
faces seems to say : ‘Just what does this white
man want of us and why is he here?’
Duroure talks about his gr e at curi o s i t y, h i s
wish to exchange experiences and to cho-
r e o graph them. No reaction from the
a u d i e n c e . His words don’t seem to get
t h r o u g h . S u d d e n l y, Duroure gets up and
s t a rts to dance.The youths join in one by
one and the impromptu performance lasts
five hours.
Communicating
without words
“This is how we finally started to com-
m u n i c ate—without any wo r d s ,” D u r o u r e
s ay s.“This is how I learned to find my phy-
sical spontaneity with them, people without
f o rmal training as dancers but who had dan-
ced since birt h .This is how I brought them
w h at I could and how we established mutual
c o n fidence and respect which enabled us
to create together.”
The result was W h at A r eYou Doing Here,
a “ c h o r e o graphed report ” of sketches blen-
ding dance, music and song with street
scenes and township ceremonies. F r e n c h
and South A f rican cultural officials we r e
sceptical at first about this project by a white
dancer but the final result was wa rmly recei-
ved by the public in South A f rica and
Europe in 1997 and 1998.The choreogra-
pher is currently repeating the experi e n c e
in the city of Durban in Kwazulu-Natal.
Unlike Duroure, who dances mainly to
“inspire encounters and complicity”, E a
Sola seeks through her work to delve into
u n k n own dimensions of the inner self. “ I t ’s
something from ve ry deep down inside
which you then have to pass on to others,”
she say s. Sola is Vietnamese and when she
was barely a teenager, she was forced into
exile in the West,and felt at a loss.
She returned to Viet Nam to delve into
her country’s rich culture,mainly through
the nort h e rn Vietnamese traditional art form
k n own as h at chéo which dates back to the
13th century and combines song, d r a m a ,
dance and percussion.With 15 V i e t n a m e s e



T HE MELT ING POT 
OF MODERN DA NCE
w Jean-Marc Adolphe and Martine Jacot
More than ever before, modern dance is synonymous with buzzing cultural exchange—from
North to South, East to West, and vice-versa
w Jean-Marc Adolphe is editor of the French arts
magazine Mouvement and artistic adviser for dance at
the Bastille Theatre in Paris.Martine Jacot is a UNESCO
Courier journalist.

p e a s a n t s , she produced a modern wo r k ,
which breaks through communication bar-
ri e rs , about remembering pain. Sécheresse et
p l u i e (“Drought and rain”) was a lean, s t ri p-
p e d - d own performance in which the pea-
sants at one point waved pictures of dead
r e l at i ve s.The work was followed by Il a été
une fois (“Once upon a time”) and Vo i l à
vo i l à, which was performed at the Lincoln
Center in New Yo r k .Tr avelling through Ger-
m a ny, F r a n c e ,D e n m a r k ,S we d e n ,B e l gi u m ,

d a n c e rs and musicians, Sola noticed “ w i t h
the same surp ri s e ”t h at at each destinat i o n

feelings beyond wo r d s. So there was no need
for any translations.
A nomadic art
José Navas is from Ve n e z u e l a , w i t h
Indian and Spanish blood from his mother
and Italian and A f rican blood through his
fat h e r. He has been based for the last few
years in Montreal (Canada) after studying
in New Yo r k , and dances and choreogr a p h s
regularly in both Europe and North A m e-
ri c a . By “talking about his Ve n e z u e l a n
c u l t u r e ” through his body, he has found a
way of breaking down language barriers.
M o d e rn dance has clearly become a
major vehicle for cultural exchange around
the wo r l d . It does more than simply
transcend spoken wo r d s : it seems to repre-
sent a common experience of humanity.“ We
are all human beings—a link that comes
before national or ethnic ties,” s ays Duroure.
“A child who cries conveys the same mes-
sage eve ry w h e r e .” Dance also invo l ves a dif-
ferent view of things, appealing to the ima-
gi n at i o n , just like music, and often with
m u s i c.
All these fa c t o rs partly explain the
upsurge of modern dance,a worldwide phe-
n o m e n o n . In 1998, 442 choreogr a p h e rs from
52 countries attended the prestigious Inter-
n ational Choreogr a p hy Fe s t i val in Seine
Saint-Denis (a suburb of Pa ri s ,F r a n c e ) . Fo r
the past decade, more and more festiva l s
giving pride of place to modern dance have
been held all over the world—in Prague
( Tanec Praha, e ve ry June), Brazil (Fe s t i va l
I n t e rnacional de Dança, in Belo Hori z o n t e
in Nove m b e r ) ,To k yo (the Yokohama Fe s t i-
va l ) , Stockholm (Dansen Hus), V i l n i u s
(Lithuania) and Adelaide (Australia).Fe s t i-
vals are also spreading across the Mediter-
ranean regi o n . A modern dance gat h e ri n g
was held in Tunis in early 1999, with dan-
c e rs from Egypt, L e b a n o n , A l g e ri a ,
M o r o c c o, Jordan and Syri a .O t h e rs will soon
take place in Casablanca and Beirut.
Dance often accompanies openings and
gr owth in other domains. In 1995, the firs t
Luanda Fe s t i val in Angola symbolized
attempts to revive the country after 20 ye a rs
of civil war.The second one,held in 1998,
claimed the title of the Fe s t i val of A f ri c a n
C h o r e o graphic Creation and showcased the
blossoming of modern dance across the
c o n t i n e n t . Some of the pri z e w i n n i n g
troupes—from Côte d’Ivo i r e , Burkina Fa s o,
K e nya , South A f ri c a ,N i g e ri a ,M a d a g a s c a r ,
Ghana and Mozambique—went to the Fe s-
t i val of New Dance in Montreal (Canada) in
September 1999.
Dance—the art of move m e n t — h a s
a lways been, in essence, nomadic in cha-
racter (see box ) .Yet the past few ye a rs have
seen a tremendous mingling of different tra-

mobile in time and space.Two French cho-

‘I was trained in African 
s tyles by the older men 
in the village but I never
imagined I could make 
a career of it or that I could
dance in silence, without
music. Abroad, I discovered 
the music inside me.’

r e o gr a p h e rs , Jean-Claude Gallotta and
H e rvé Robbe, went to set up a troupe in
Ja p a n , where the A m e rican Susan Buirge
joined with a Shinto priest and an expert in
ga ga k u music to create a four-part produc-
tion based on the agricultural seasons. C l a r a
A n d e rm att from Lisbon works with Cape
Verdean dancers , and Susane Linke from
G e rm a ny is putting together a show with
Senegalese dancers.There is no shortage of
other examples.
Miniature multinationals
Dance companies are miniature multi-
n at i o n a l s. The Ta n z t h e ater of Wu p p e rt a l
( G e rm a ny) run by Pina Bausch includes
people from ten countries, whose national
traits find pride of place in her productions.
The Tanztheater creates pieces all over the
world these days. Two Burkinabé dancers
joined the Choreography Centre in Mont-
pellier (southern France) while retaining
links with their country. One of them, S a l i a
Sanou,had just completed his law studies
and passed the exam to become a police
inspector when he was invited to
France.“In 1991, you couldn’t make a
living from dance in Ouagadougou,” h e
said of Burkina Faso’s capital. “I was trai-
ned in A f rican styles by the older men in
the village but I never imagined I could
make a career of it or that I could dance in
silence, without music. Abroad, I discove-
red the music inside me.”
In Burkina Fa s o, Sanou and his col-
league Seydou Boro created a piece called
S i g n i n t o, which won a prize at the 1998
Luanda Fe s t i va l . Both dream of opening
together a choreogr a p hy centre in Ouaga-
d o u g o u , where studios but not dancers are
lacking.
“The challenge for me is how to bring
my culture and my experiences to other
people so they resonate even more with
their cultures without making modern
dance too cerebral,” says Deroure in Dur-
ban.He would like to move towards a kind
of language encompassing these different
cultures.
“Everywhere,especially in Latin Ame-
ri c a , our generation is more and more of
m i xed background and the next will be eve n
more so,” s ays Navas in Montreal. “ We ’r e
opening up to the world and exchangi n g
things more than ever before.”
Yet does this mixing process risk homo-
genizing or wat e ring down creativity? “ A b s o-
lutely not,”s ays Sola.“ Tradition without crea-
tion is steri l e . In dance as in other art i s t i c
fie l d s , transplanting one country ’s traditions
to another doesn’t wo r k , except for a few eth-
nology enthusiasts. M o d e rn dance can only
be creation and innovat i o n .” n
