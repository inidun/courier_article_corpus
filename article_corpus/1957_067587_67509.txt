In time, atomic energy may help to dispel the spectre
of hunger from the world . It can guide plant scientists
to improved ways of raising crops, teach them to
combat insect pests and plant diseases more effec¬
tively, and even create new types of plants yielding
a larger harvest. Using radio-isotopes as "tracers"
scientists have learned much about plant growth.
Now, the use of atomic radiation has opened new
horizons in the field of food conservation. Five years
of painstaking research have shown U.S. scientists
how exposure to radiation affects food, as seen in
photos (4-5). Six-month-old sprouting potato makes
striking contrast with two-year-old atomic-preserved
one; all onions here are same age, lower ones were
exposed to radiation. (6) Quick, efficient method of
sterilizing food by exposing it to radiations from
electron-generator. Wrapped in cellophane, food is
instantly sterilized. Radiation passes through package
but leaves no trace, so food is safe to eat. (7) Potatoes
properly exposed to radiation do not sprout, wither or
spoil for two years. This portable atomic-processing
unit can be mounted on a truck and moved into a field
where it can quickly "preserve" an entire potato crop.
Conservation by radiation offers great promise, but
is still very much in the experimental stage today.
