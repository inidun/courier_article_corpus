The Rio convention marked the first major international step towards 
the sharing of biodiversity based on the principle of social fairness
It has become commonplace to say that the
C o nvention on Biological Dive rsity (CBD)
adopted during the Rio Summit in June 1992 is
an important landmark in integr ating the pri n-
ciples of ethics and equity in the use of biodive rs i t y.
To stem the increasingly rapid decline of biodiver-
sity, it was necessary to take action, and quickly,
without waiting for the scientific community to
gather further knowledge. First and foremost, the
CBD was an acknowledgment of this urgent need.
It entered into force in December 1993 and so fa r
has been rat i fied by 177 Stat e s — but not by the United
S t at e s.This agr e e m e n t , the only one of its kind,sets up
a framework for worldwide action aimed at ensuri n g
the conservat i o n , the sustainable use and—a note-
wo rt hy development—the fair sharing of biodive rs i-
t y ’s benefit s. More specific a l l y, the CBD focuses on the
d e finition and the financing of conservation policies,
access to genetic resources,N o rth-South technology
t r a n s f e rs stemming from the use of those resources,
and trade in genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
In part i c u l a r , it acknowledges that poor countri e s
cannot meet their commitments to preserve biodi-
ve rsity unless the developed nations provide them
with access to biotechnologies and the related fin a n-
c i n g .B i o d i ve rsity will unavoidably be depleted through
ove ruse if the current co-existence of unsustainable life-
styles and unacceptable pove rty continues, and if the
means of subsistence of families putting strains on
resources are not strengthened.
The CBD has first and foremost been an effec-
t i ve awareness-raising tool. Political leaders , t h e
media and the general public now know that taking
from nature without restraint jeopardizes humani-
t y ’s securi t y.M a ny states have changed their nat i o n a l
l aws to create or strengthen mechanisms to manage
biodiversity.The convention has also lent support
to the idea that preserving species with their nat u r a l
habitats and enlisting the local people’s support in
managing them are vital priorities.
The convention has also prompted over 130 Stat e s
to adopt a protocol last Ja n u a ry 29, 2000 in Montreal
(Canada) on biosafety in order to regulate intern at i o n a l
trade in GMOs.The negotiations led to a stand-off bet-
ween the European Union and the “Miami Group”,
consisting of the leading GMO producing countri e s
led by the United Stat e s , Argentina and Canada.
According to the text eventually adopted, c o u n t ri e s
m ay oppose GMO imports deemed hazardous for the
e nvironment or health by invoking the principle of pre-
caution—in other wo r d s , without necessarily hav i n g
i rrefutable scientific proof that they are dangerous.
H owe ve r , the issue of whether the protocol ove rri d e s
the rules of the World Trade Organization (the W TO,
which so far has not recognized the principle of pre-
caution) remains to be settled.Only a specific dispute
brought before the W TO will show whether the pro-
tocol has any teeth.
The CBD has certainly enabled progr e s s , but the
funding of conservation projects is far from gua-
ranteed.Development aid has been steadily decli-
ning since 1992.The Global Environment Fa c i l i t y
in charge of, among other things,managing inter-
n ational financing for biodive rs i t y, has received and
distributed about $2 billion in 10 years.
Protecting traditional knowledge
Lastly and, most import a n t l y, scant political
e f f o rt has been focused on guaranteeing a fair share
of biodive rs i t y ’s benefit s. M a ny developing countri e s
continue to denounce what they call “ b i o p i r a cy ”b y
the gove rnments and companies of the Nort h ,
which collect their biological resources for com-
mercial purposes.There is an urgent need to take
steps that would acknowledge and compensate the
inestimable contri bution of indigenous rural fa m i-
lies to the conservation and improvement of the pla-
net’s genetic resources.
T h at task requires changing intellectual propert y
ru l e s.They are currently being revised in the frame-
work of the Tr a d e - R e l ated Aspects of Intellectual
P r o p e rty (TRIPS) agr e e m e n t , which regulates bio-
technology patents and new va rieties of crops.T h e
system in force,based on individually-owned pri vat e
p r o p e rt y, is unsuitable for protecting indigenous
p e o p l e ’s collective traditional know l e d g e .The Wo r l d
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), w h i c h
has launched a study on the need to recognize their
ri g h t s , is likely to help identify altern at i ve solutions.
N e x t , the intern ational community must carry out a
c rucial task: drafting and adopting a protocol on
a gr o b i o d i ve rsity that would protect traditional know-
ledge and fa rm e rs ’ rights over plant genomes. ■
