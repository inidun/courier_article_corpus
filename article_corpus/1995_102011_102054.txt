The balcony of Europe
by Jean-Pierre Kraemer
A pocket-sized international airport ;a fas expanding money market ; a
European centre which houses the
headquarters of the Secretariat of the
European Parliament and other Euro-
pean institutions such as the Court of
Auditors, the Court of Justice and the
European Investment Bank ; a strategic
crossroads where the history of Europe,
from the Early Middle Ages on, has lit-
erally been carved in stone ; the leg-
endary spot where Melusina1, wife of
the city's founder Count Sigefroid, is
said to hide-Luxembourg, capital of
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is all
of these. Its inhabitants, who number
fewer than 100, 000, speak not only
their native tongue Letzebuergesch (a
Mosellan Franconian dialect), but
French and German, and in many cases
English and even Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese. A good half of the capital's
population is made up of foreigners.
CITY AND CROSSROADS
Located at the intersection of two Roman
roads, one from Paris, the other from
Capital of the Grand Duchy,
Luxembourg City was coveted by the
powers of western Europe for
centuries. Since 1994 its old districts
and fortifications have been
registered on UNESCO's World
Heritage List.

Lyons, on a rocky promontory between the
two deep valleys of the Alzette and the
Petrusse, the site of the future city strad-
dled the linguistic borderline between
France and the Holy Roman Empire, in
the heart of ancient Lotharingia. It was
ideally suited to fortification.
THE GIBRALTAR
OF THE NORTH'
In about 1000 A. D., on the site of a
modest Roman fort called Lucilin-
burhuc, or Liitzelburg ("little castle"),
Sigefroid built a feudal castle which
was to become the seat of the illustrious
house of Luxembourg and the"Acrop-
olis"of the future fortified town.
At the beginning of the fourteenth
century the town had 5, 000 inhabitants
and enjoyed an economic boom thanks
to its ideal location on the trade route
between the two leading trading regions
of the time, Lombardy and Flanders. Its
third surrounding wall, known as
Wenceslaus's Wall, which protected
both the upper and lower towns, dates
from the end of the fourteenth century.

Its strategic location made Luxem-
bourg a very attractive prize for the
great continental powers and dragged it
into the upheavals of European politics.
After becoming part of the possessions
of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy,
in the fifteenth century, the Duchy
passed into the hands of the Spanish
Habsburgs, who considerably rein-
forced the fortress when it came under
threat from the French. After being
besieged by Vauban, it eventually fell
to Louis XIV in 1684. A skilled strate-
gist and military engineer, Vauban then
extended the fortifications up to the
top of the promontory, from which he
had succeeded in breaching the town's
defences.
Luxembourg remained in the hands
of the Austrian Habsburgs for most of
the eighteenth century, then fell to the
army of the French Republic in 1795,
before becoming part of the German
Confederation in 1815. The Congress of
Vienna, which redrew the political map
of Europe, made Luxembourg a Grand
Duchy. The city, occupied by Prussian
troops who further reinforced its forti-
fications, became a"federal fortress"
designed to act as a barrier against the
French. But at the London Conference
of 1867 a treaty signed by the great
powers of the time in the hope of pre-
venting a Franco-Prussian war stipu-
lated that the Grand Duchy should
remain in a state of"perpetual neu-
trality", that the Prussian garrison
should withdraw from the fortress, and
that its imposing fortifications should

be dismantled. The dismantling process,
which took sixteen years, resulted in
the disappearance of one of the most
powerful strongholds in Europe, once
called"the Gibraltar of the North".
Initially regarded as a disaster by
the city's burghers, the treaty had a
beneficial effect on Luxembourg. The
removal of the fortifications opened up
a large area of building land and offere d
undreamt-of growth possibilities. Par-
liamentary buildings were erected, new
districts such as the Plateau Bourbon
became urbanized, and cultural institu-
tions were sited there. The price to be
paid for this boom was the loss of a
unique heritage of military architec-
ture, the surviving remnants of which
form part of the historic site placed on
the World Heritage List in December
1994.
INSPIRATION FOR ARTISTS
AND WRITERS
The different powers that ruled Lux-
embourg from the sixteenth to the nine-
teenth centuries left their stamp on the
city's military and civilian architecture
through a process of historical super-
imposition. But the site is chiefly inter-
esting because of the boldness with
which the city blends into a landscape
whose beauty has impressed many great
artists and writers.
There exist 338 street plans, maps
and drawings of Luxembourg which
make it possible to chart its develop-
ment both spatially and temporally.
Many artists have painted views of the
fortified town. Goethe made a series of
pencil sketches and drawings height-
ened with wash and sepia. But there

can be little doubt that it was J. M. W.
Turner who, in his twenty-odd water-
colours of the site, best captured its
atmosphere.
RELICS OF A PRESTIGIOUS PAST
It is true that Luxembourg lost much of
its architectural heritage as a result of
the military attacks to which it was con-
stantly subjected. Gone are its feudal
castle, which was destroyed by a gun-
powder explosion in 1554, the sump-
tuous Renaissance buildings put up by
Governor Pierre-Ernest de Mansfeld,
which fell in ruins in the seventeenth cen-
tury, and the fortress walls, which were
for so long a threat to peace in Europe.
But important relics of Luxem-
bourg's prestigious past have survived,
such as the Eglise St.-Michel, which is
over 1, 000 years old, and Notre-Dame
cathedral, a national shrine and place of
annual pilgrimage, whose three spires
can be seen from far outside the city.
There are also some superb seigneurial
residences, such as the Hotel de Bour-
gogne, seat of the presidency of the gov-
ernment, the Maison de Cassal, the
Hotel de Raville, and the Maison Mohr
de Waldt. Also of great interest to visi-
tors is the Grand Ducal Palace, whose
fine facade shows the influence of the
Spanish Renaissance.
Above all, an elusive spirit of place

has survived intact in Luxembourg. The
visitor can sense it in the steep and
narrow medieval streets ; on the cliff-top
esplanade, known as"the balcony of
Europe" ; in the casemates dug by Hab-
sburg troops, in which the whole popu-
lation of the Grand Duchy could hide ;
in the back streets of the lower town ; at
a bend in the Alzette River, where one
might almost be in some Venetian calle ;
on the surrounding hills, which offer
the finest views over the Bock-the
"Acropolis", where Melusina is thought
to be sewing a linen blouse, the comple-
tion of which will herald the collapse of
the castle.
Apart from its legends, perhaps Lux-
embourg can be regarded as a European
paradigm. After being subjected for so
long to the ravages of war, the city now
embodies what was, perhaps, Lucilin-
burhuc's true mission : the desire for
peace in Europe, t
1 Melusina : a fairy of popular legend. Her
union with a mortal guaranteed the fertility
of the people's land and the prosperity of
their homes.-Ed.
