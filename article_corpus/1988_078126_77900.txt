The development crisis
in Africa
Africa possesses enormous mineral
wealth, including 30 per cent of all
known uranium reserves, as well as
vast rivers with the potential to
supply around a quarter of the
world's hydro-electric power. Be¬

T
EVERYONE agrees that
the present development
crisis in Africa is alarming.
Yet it is not due to a shortage of
human or natural resources. In
addition to the enormous poten¬
tial of its young population (46
per cent under the age of 15), this
second largest continent after
Asia, with an area of 30.3 million
km2, still has 800 million hectares
of potentially arable land (al¬
though only 170 million were
cultivated in 1985). Africa's share
of world mineral reserves is 96 per
cent for diamonds, 90 per cent for
chromium, 85 per cent for plati¬
num , 50 per cent for cobalt, 55 per
cent for manganese, 40 per cent
for bauxite, 13 per cent for cop
per, 50 per cent for phosphates
and almost as much for gold, and
30 per cent for thorium and ura¬
nium; it also has large deposits of
nickel, lead and iron.
Moreover, the continent's huge
energy potential is as yet virtually
untapped: to date only ten Afri¬
can countries are oil producers
and although Africa possesses 20
to 27 per cent of the world's
hydro-electric potential, it has
harnessed only a very small part
of it. It is therefore surprising that
a continent so well endowed with
natural wealth should be in a state
of economic stagnation, or even
decline.
Should we not seek the cause of
the problem in the inadequacy of
Africa's scientific and technolo¬
gical capacity? This seems to have
been the conclusion reached by
the Organization of African Uni¬
ty (OAU) during the preparation
of Africa's Priority Programme
for Economic Recovery, in which
it is stated that: "Experience indi¬
cates that no country has attained
any breakthrough in its economic
development without a minimum
science and technology base."
A divided continent
Development efforts in Africa
run up against a great number of
difficulties, the major causes of
which are the partitioning of the
continent, the dependence of the

The traditional, predominantly
agricultural, sector of the African
economy and the modern, industrial
sector exist side by side without the
one significantly affecting the other.

economic systems of Africa,
unsuitable development policies
and strategies, the educational
situation and the handicap
of illiteracy.
The division into a multitude of
small States is the first obvious
problem for the peoples of Afri¬
ca. The natural wealth referred to
above is very unevenly distri¬
buted among more than fifty
States with, at present, over 500
million inhabitants. Ten per cent
of them live in countries poorly
endowed with natural resources
and half of them, spread among
thirty-four African States south of
the Sahara, live in poorly irri¬
gated or drought-prone areas.
These and many other geo¬
graphical and linguistic consid¬
erations are so many reflections
of a fragmentation generating
economic, commercial, scientific
and technological constraints that
are difficult to surmount within
territorial boundaries which are
usually narrow and often not
clearly defined. This can be illus¬
trated by the following statistics:
in 1983, 39 African States had
fewer than 10 million inhabitants
each. These included 12 of the 14
land-locked States of Africa,
mostly in the Sahel region, and 12
24

K
States with fewer than 1 million
inhabitants. Of the 37 countries
designated by the United Nations
as the "least developed countries"
(LDCs), 26 are in Africa; 24 of
them are classified as countries
which do not produce enough
food to support themselves and 21
are on the World Bank's list of
low-income countries. The eco¬
nomic development of all these
countries would certainly benefit
if they belonged to regional co¬
operation groups or to subregion¬
al economic communities.
All the characteristic features
of underdevelopment are to be
found in African economies.
Based essentially on exports of
raw materials and mass imports of
manufactured goods, these eco¬
nomies are characterized by de¬
pendence, a low growth rate of
gross domestic product (GDP)
estimated at 1 per cent for the
continent as a whole between
1980 and 1984a huge trade de¬
ficit and a heavy foreign debt,
representing 43.8 per cent of
GDP and 187 per cent of the value
of exports and non-factor servi¬
ces* in 1984.
* Not including factor incomes (work and
capital).
The limited range of exports
makes African economies even
more vulnerable. While raw
material prices are collapsing on
the world market, the manufac¬
tured goods imported by African
countries to meet their consumer
needs are becoming more and
more costly, entailing a persistent
deterioration in" the terms of
trade.
As a result, the world economic
crisis which has now lasted for
over a decade has had a harsher
impact on the African economies,
leading to an unprecedented
social, economic and food supply
crisis in Africa. This situation is in
fact only the final stage in a pro¬
cess which began long ago, with
the introduction of economic
structures during the colonial era
based on production strategies
whose chief objective was the ful¬
filment of needs external to the
African continent.
Economics of dependence
After twenty-fivê years of inde¬
pendence in the case of most Afri¬
can States, these structures have
changed very little, and African
economies are still largely depen¬
dent. The development policies
implemented by African coun¬
tries themselves have created the
following additional inade¬
quacies: limited development of
human resources and failure to
exploit them properly; extremely
inadequate scientific and tech¬
nological capacity, reflected in
low labour and capital producti¬
vity; poor organizational and
management capabilities of both
public and private administra¬
tions and enterprises.
In agriculture, the dominant
sector in most African econo¬
mies, development policies and
strategies are marred by inade¬
quate investment, lack of incen¬
tive measures for farmers, short¬
comings in the application of re¬
search findings due to the limited
development of extension ser¬
vices (especially in the case of
food crops), the lack of a pricing
policy and the inadequacy of the
system for the marketing, distri¬
bution, storage and conservation
of agricultural produce.
The industrial sector is still un¬
developed and heavily dependent
on foreign capital. Most com¬
panies are established by means
of transfers of frequently cumber¬
some foreign technology that is
ill-suited to the economic situa
tion in African countries. As a
result, the goods produced by
local enterprises are far from
competitive.
In 1980, the industrial sector
accounted for only 9.8 per cent of
the formation of GDP in the re¬
gion and Africa's share in world
production based on value added
was only 0.9 per cent, compared
with 2.7 per cent in South-East
Asia and 6 per cent in Latin
America.
I Progress in education
A substantial effort has been
made in the field of education
since the Conference of African
States on the Development of
Education in Africa, held in
Addis Ababa in May 1961, where
it was agreed that by 1980 the
countries of Africa were to pro¬
vide free and compulsory primary
education for all, secondary
education for 23 per cent of
schoolchildren having completed
primary education, and higher
education for at least 2 per cent of
students having completed secon¬
dary education.
Today, about fifteen African
countries have achieved or are in
the process of achieving universal
primary education. The average
enrolment rate in the 6 to 11 age-
group for the continent as a whole
is 62 per cent and that of secon¬
dary education is 20 per cent in
the corresponding age-groups. In
higher education, enrolment has
increased eightfold since 1960 but
there are still major disparities
from one African country to
another. Seven countries (Cape
Verde, the Comoros, Djibouti,
Equatorial Guinea, the Gambia,
Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tomé and
Principe) still have no higher
education establishments. As re¬
gards adult education, significant
progress has been made, the illi¬
teracy rate having dropped from
90 per cent in 1960 to 60 per cent
in 1985 for Africa as a whole.
However, Africa is still one of
the most disadvantaged regions in

economy is often heavily depend¬
ent on international markets and

educational terms at all levels.
Despite the progress made, it is
exceptional for even 30 to 40 per
cent of children at primary
schools to go on to secondary edu¬
cation. In 1980, a total of 29 mil¬
lion African children in the 6 to 11
age-group were not enrolled at
school, and 39 million in the 12 to
17 age-group were outside the
education system.
Statistics apart, the most wor¬
rying aspect of school and uni¬
versity education in Africa re¬
mains that of the relevance of its
general tendencies and content
compared to the needs and objec¬
tives of African social and econo¬
mic development. One of the
shortcomings of the existing
education systems in African
countries is the limited develop¬
ment of technical and vocational
education and the scant attention
paid to guiding students towards
scientific and technical subjects.
Science teaching is virtually non¬
existent in primary education,
while in secondary education,
where students are first intro¬
duced to science and technology,
courses lack practical content for
want of suitable equipment and
qualified teachers.
Science and technology
teaching
In higher education, African
universities set themselves in 1961
the objective of training 60 per
cent of their total student intake
in science and technology. In fact,
no university has yet consistently
reached this objective. According
to the partial results of a study
undertaken in 1982 by Unesco's
Division of Science and Technol¬
ogy Policies for an average of ten
countries, the percentage of stu
dents enrolled in science and
technology courses had risen
from 18.76 in 1970 to 28 in 1980.
According to data published by
Unesco's Education Sector, the
percentage of students enrolled in
natural science and engineering
courses increased between 1970
and 1980 in 21 of the 37 countries
covered by the study. The num¬
ber of graduates in the three fields
as a whole (natural science and
engineering, medical science and
agricultural science) represented
less than half the total number of
graduates, with the exception of
four African countries: Egypt (50
per cent), Kenya (51 per cent),
Swaziland (58 per cent) and Tuni¬
sia (53 per cent). In most of the
other countries this proportion
varied between 20 and 40 per
cent.
Generally speaking, the major
problem faced by science and
technology education in Africa
remains the under-equipment of
schools and universities and the
shortage of qualified teachers. In
this respect, it should be stressed
that the establishment by Unesco
in 1984 of a Regional Advisory.,
Committee on the Renewal of
Science and Technology
Teaching in Africa and, at the
23rd session of its General Con¬
ference in 1985, of a Regional
Advisory Committee on Higher
Education in Africa, are impor¬
tant contributions to the devel¬
opment of the scientific and
technological capabilities of the
continent.

ficit and a heavy foreign debt."
