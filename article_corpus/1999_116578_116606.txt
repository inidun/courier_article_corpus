M O R S E :
THE END OF AN ERA?
w Tony Smith
A world information highway built as a result of the 19th-century century communications
revolution came to the end of the road at the beginning of this year. Or did it? 
By the end of the 19th century, Morse telegraphy was in widespread use.

i n s t rument to achieve this by means of inter-
rupted electrical currents corresponding to
a prearranged code (see box ) .
In 1843, C o n gress allocated $30,000
to test his invention on a 40-mile (65-km)
line along the railroad from Washington to
Baltimore.This opened on May 24, 1844,
with the sending of the apposite phrase
“What Hath God Wrought!”,and within a
year pri vate companies came into being
with plans to run Morse lines to all parts of
America.
In 1866, after several earlier at t e m p t s , a
submarine cable linked Britain and Ame-
ri c a . By 1871 a cable had reached A u s-
tralia, and well before the turn of the cen-
t u ry most of the world was covered by a va s t
network of Morse lines.
A new industry
The Morse telegraph created an entirely
new industry which, amongst other things,
offered women for the first time an oppor-
tunity to take up a respectable career, that
of a telegrapher,outside their own homes.
Te l e grams became a way of life for bu s i n e s s
and for individuals, and many large orga-
nizations had their own telegraph offices.
In 1848, six New York newspapers
f o rmed the A s s o c i ated Press, s h a ring news-
g at h e ring and telegraphic serv i c e s. T h e y
hired their own lines and operating staff,a n d
by 1923 AP landlines across North A m e ri c a
totalled 92,000 miles (148,000 km) ser-
ving the interests of 1,207 member news-
papers.
M a ny famous people started their
careers in the telegraph industry. Thomas
Edison, the famous inventor, was an itine-
rant Morse telegrapher at the age of 17,
t r avelling thousands of miles throughout
the United States and Canada, taking job
after job as his fa n cy, or circumstances,
dictated.
Andrew Carn e gi e , the industrialist and
philanthropist, began as a messenger boy
and was a telegraphist for twe l ve ye a rs.

This Morse receiver dating from 1889 is displayed in the telecommunications museum at Pleumeur-Bodou,in France.

Gene A u t ry, “the singing cow b oy ” , w h o
died in 1998 aged 91, was a railroad tele-
grapher in his youth before he became a
Hollywood star.
In the early days of broadcasting, a tele-
grapher accompanied A m e rican commen-
tators to sporting events, and special lines
were installed to connect the stadium to
the radio stat i o n .The telegrapher sent short
r e p o rts to the station describing the progr e s s
of the mat c h , and a “ s p o rt s c a s t e r ” u s e d
them to provide a “ l i ve ”c o m m e n t a ry on the
game as if he were there personally. One
broadcaster who worked in this way in the
1930s was Ronald Reagan,later President
of the United States.
A universal code
The code used on the A m e rican lines wa s
“ A m e rican Mors e ” ,which is not the same as
the intern ational code we know today.The firs t
M o rse line in Europe was between Hambu r g
and Cuxhaven in 1847, but the A m e ri c a n
code was not entirely suitable for the Germ a n
language with its diacritical letters. A new
extended code was therefore devised, i n c l u-
ding some new characters and some retained
from the A m e rican code.
As the telegraph spread to other
German states and to Austria, each state
devised its own va ri ation of the Morse code,
n e c e s s i t ating telegraphic translation to a
different code by an operator as messages
crossed state boundaries.
In 1851 the A u s t r o - G e rmanic Te l e gr a p h
Union adopted a slightly amended ve rs i o n
of the 1847 code for use in all states as part
of a unified telegraph system effective from
July 1, 1 8 5 2 .The new code spread to other
European countries and was finally adopted
for unive rsal use in 1865 by the newly
formed International Telegraph Union.
Later, some countries developed their
own versions of the code for internal com-
m u n i c at i o n s.A p a rt from the ori ginal A m e-
rican Mors e , which remained in use within
the United States, there are Arabic, Bur-
mese, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese,
K o r e a n ,R u s s i a n , and Turkish Morse codes,
and possibly more.
The European code, which finally
became the intern ational Morse code, wa s
the chosen communication mode for the
newly invented wireless at the end of the
19th century.
A good practical system of signalling
already existed between stations using metal
wires to carry their signals.The purpose of
early wireless was simply to replicate and
extend the scope of the Morse telegraph
without the need for wires between sta-
t i o n s. When wireless was found to be
capable of sending messages over gr e at dis-
tances it was adapted for use by ships at sea
which previously had no means of com-
m u n i c ation with land, or each other, e x c e p t
by visual signalling when close-by.
Inspiration for wireless
The most famous early use of Morse at
sea was when the Titanic struck an iceberg
and sank on the night of A p ril 14, 1 9 1 2 .H e r
t wo Radio Offic e rs , Jack Phillips and Harold
Bride, stayed by their radio until the last
m o m e n t , sending out CQD SOS messages
in Morse code calling other ships to their
r e s c u e .“ C Q D ” was a recognized mari t i m e
distress signal, and “ S O S ” was a new inter-
national signal due to replace it shortly.
Their calls were heard 58 miles (93 km)
away by the C a rp at h i a, which arri ved on the

the Ti t a n i c sank and rescued some 700 sur-
vivors. Over 1,500 people died in the tra-
g e d y, including Jack Phillips. B ride sur-
v i ved and although unable to walk or stand,
spent much of the time over the next four
days heroically helping the radio officer of
the Carpathia send a continuous stream of
messages from the surviving passengers to
their next of kin.
Military use
Morse telegraphy was used by military
forces in the Crimean Wa r , and in the A m e-
rican Civil War. In the First World War, it
was widely employed in trench wa r fare with
bu z z e rs replacing sounders. At the same
time early wireless telegr a p hy sets we r e
coming into use.
By the time of the Second World Wa r ,
although wired telegr a p hy was still used,w i r e-
less had become the preferred form of military
c o m m u n i c at i o n . It was also an essential part
of clandestine/intelligence operat i o n s ,p a rt i-
cularly in occupied Europe where Allied agents
risked detection,and their live s ,e ve ry time they
transmitted a message to London. M o rse by
radio also served as a vital communicat i o n s
link for the gr e atly increased use of aircraft in
wa rtime operat i o n s.
In most armed forces today Morse is no
longer taught as a standard form of com-
munication,although some operators still
l e a rn it as a special skill. In a recent unusual
a p p l i c at i o n , Sudan Pe o p l e ’s Liberat i o n
A rmy rebels fighting the gove rnment of
Sudan have been heard on short wave radio,
without Morse keys, vocalizing the code as
“dits” and “dahs”into microphones.
Not quite the end
The invention of radio signalled the
b e ginning of the end for landline Mors e , bu t
it took a long time to happen.While long-
distance radio services challenged the cable
c o m p a n i e s , the advent of the telepri n t e r
took a more immediate effect. B ri t a i n ’s Po s t
O f fice officially abandoned Morse in 1932,
although its use continued in the United
States and Australia until the 1960s.
The same process took place in other
c o u n t ries although from time to time
u n c o n firmed reports indicate that landline
Morse still survives in Mexico and India.
M o rse at sea has officially ceased, but it
has not yet disappeared. Some stations and
ships are still actively carrying Morse traffic,
mostly in the developing world, but some
European stations can also be heard.The
high cost of installing new equipment in
the ships is the main reason for the delay in
c h a n ging to GMDSS, but also training fa c i-
lities have not been able to keep up with
demand.
There is still one major user of Morse
code. Radio amateurs worldwide use it to
communicate with each other because of
t wo adva n t a g e s. It has an intern at i o n a l l y
understood system of abbreviations which
aids communication between people who
are unfamiliar with each other’s language;
and Morse radio transmission is a part i-
cularly effective means of getting signals to
distant places compared with other radio
modes—the same advantages that made it
so valuable for maritime use.
Landline Morse is also kept alive by
hobbyists. In America, Canada and Aus-
t r a l i a , enthusiasts mount historical display s
and communicate with each other using
original keys and sounders via the public
telephone system, dial-up units, a n d
modems. n
