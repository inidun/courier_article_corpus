Do schools foment 
i n e q u a l i t y?
Fernando Reimers◗ a rgues that unless bold innovations are made,
the education gap between rich and poor is bound to widen

The role of education in reducing poverty has often
been stressed. How exactly do education and
poverty relate?
There are several reasons why education can help
reduce pove rt y. One of them is that the cognitive and
social skills and credentials which can be gained in
school expand the choices available to people and the-
refore their freedom.They increase the probability
t h at people will become more productive , get better
paid jobs,and adopt practices that lead to better health
and having fewer children. But the impact of educa-
tion on improving the living conditions of the poor
and its impact on reducing social inequality are two
different things. In some Latin A m e rican countri e s ,
for example, the wage gap between college gr a d u at e s
and those who do not have a college education has
widened during the last decade.
How does this change our way of thinking about
education? 
Making sure the poor have the basic skills that will
enable them to be productive is not enough to reduce
inequalities in a context where the non-poor are also
i nvesting all they can in educat i o n . As a result of the
big effort in expanding access to education that took
place in many developing countries in the 1950s and
1 9 6 0 s , there has been plenty of intergenerational edu-
c ational mobility. In Mexico, for example,40 per cent
of children in their sixth year of school have exceeded
the educational level of their parents.T h at ’s a terri fic
a c h i e vement of the education system.But at the same
t i m e , the parents of the wealthiest 10 per cent are
i nvesting significantly more in the education of their
c h i l d r e n ,who are reaching levels far beyond their ow n .
The distance between these kids and those of the poor
m ay even be widening. So we have a narr owing gap
in terms of average ye a rs of schooling but a widening
gap in terms of the quality of education received by
different socio-economic groups and exclusion from
access to the education levels that matter for social
mobility (upper secondary and tert i a ry ) .
You argue that education systems often re i n f o rc e
this gap.
Let’s examine the origins of these educational
equity gaps. One is that if every parent spends the
same proportion of their resources on educating
their child, richer parents will spend more in abso-
lute terms. At a time when more and more private
resources are likely to be invested in educat i o n ,
this is particularly problemat i c. S e c o n d l y, w h i l e
p r o gr e s s i ve educat o rs would say that it’s the stat e ’s
job to try to close the gap between rich and poor by
directing tax revenue towards those who need it
m o s t , w h at we ’re seeing in many education sys-
tems is the reve rs e . More is spent on urban children
and on unive rs i t i e s , and less on groups with a we a k
political voice.A third source of inequality is that
p e r f o rmance is determined not just by what teachers
do or by resources in the school but also by resources
in the home—by having a parent read to you at
n i g h t , help you with homework and take an interest
in your education.A fourth source stems from the
fact that all too often teachers treat low - i n c o m e
children as defic i e n t , disrespect them and their
p a r e n t s , and as a result teach them in ways that lead
to school failure rather than success.
Do we know what kind of compensatory policies
work best?
Here we have to look seriously at the content of
w h at ’s being taught.A lot of the effort at expansion that
took place in the 1960s and 1970s assumed that if we
just gave more of the same to eve ry b o d y, t h at wo u l d
be enough.T h at is a questionable assumption. S o m e
children are barely grasping a small part of the curri-
culum and the little they do learn will not help them
get good jobs.
In the 21st century it’s probably not going to be
enough just to be able to read,w rite and add numbers.

People will need skills to help them solve their pro-
b l e m s ,d e velop the capacity to learn throughout life,
c o m m u n i c ate and work in teams. We also have to
realize that traditional education systems in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries lack the resources and capacity to prov i d e
all kids with educat i o n , especially at the levels that
m atter for social mobility.
The next education divide will not be measured by
whether or not children complete pri m a ry educat i o n
but by their access to and completion of secondary
e d u c at i o n . But the traditional model of secondary
and tert i a ry education is expensive , with its separat e
subject matter specialists teaching separate gr a d e s ,a n d
some would argue that on effic i e n cy grounds yo u
cannot bring it to small rural communities.This is tan-
tamount to excluding most of the poor.We should be
thinking about altern at i ve approaches such as multi-
grade secondary schools and distance educat i o n .Te l e-
c o m m u n i c ations technologies make it possible today
to think in radically different ways about how to orga-
nize educational dialogue.
Where’s the best place to start designing pro-poor
educational policies?
The home, by designing curricula that tap
resources existing among disadvantaged children.
The assumption should be that low-income kids are
not deficient in any way and that an education should
be designed for them that is relevant to their talents
and can invo l ve their parents. But all too often,
u n f o rt u n at e l y, we don’t know enough about these
children to design relevant curricula for them.It is rare
t h at education systems, p o l i cy m a k e rs and teachers
d e m o n s t r ate sufficient respect for the excluded to ask
them what they want to know and organize educa-
tional encounters in ways that fit their part i c u l a r
demands and circumstances.
Are these innovations difficult to bring about?
They are problematic because you are asking
the most vulnerable part of the education system, t h e
one that deals with peripheral gr o u p s , to do more.

W h at ’s more, not all education systems have the
same capacity for innovat i o n . Institutional capacities,
resource bases and cultural and historical determ i-
nants differ from place to place. But I’m conv i n c e d
t h at insisting on a single model of education is an
impossible aspirat i o n .
What about resources?
Political pri o rities are invo l ved here. S o m e
g ove rnments might say that they don’t have the
resources to innovat e . But how much are they spen-
ding on defence? How much are they spending on
bailing out private banks that have gone bankrupt
and in many cases fuelled corruption and capital
flight out of the country? In the long term , t h e
solution is to deepen democratic processes so that
the least empowered have more power and more
voice. In the meantime inequalities are widening.
The non-poor have to realize that it’s in their interest
to pay attention to the educational chances of the
p o o r. Until and unless that happens, I think we are
going to see reforms that are episodic and unsus-
tainable in the long term . I t ’s ve ry important to
reach a consensus in each society on the role edu-
c ational equity will have as a common aspirat i o n , a
balance of interests.The demand for a more equi-
table distri bution of educational opportunities has
to come from both the poor and the non-poor.
This is one of the main differences that you observe
b e t ween the most and the least equitable nat i o n s :i t ’s
a certain ideology, a culture of how acceptable it is
to have these kinds of disparities. There are ways,
through social marketing campaigns for example, i n
which governments can educate and sensitize the
population at large about certain priorities.
One of the lasting contri butions educat o rs can
make to improve equality of opportunity is to engage
their students and the public,both poor and non-poor,
in conve rs ations about these kinds of issues,about the
value of aspiring to equal education outcomes and
about the avenues to achieve it. ■
