of species of insects which exist only
a few are harmful to man and his
environment. Yet this small per¬
centage causes untold misery. It is
estimated that a fifth of the food
produced in the world is lost, much
of it going directly to feed these pests.
They cause immense losses among
animals reared for food or domestic
use; they can wreck buildings, destroy
forests and bring death to human
beings. Their ravages have been
recorded from the time that writing
was invented. In Africa, up to a half
of the continent's dried fish is lost
to insects, and about 50 million people
could be fed each year by the grain
destroyed through their ravages.
After many centuries of war against
harmful insects, there are indications
that man is gradually winning and that
atomic energy has now added a power¬
ful weapon to the armoury of control
methods which have been developed.
These include insecticides, scientific

methods of growth and storage, breed¬
ing varieties of plants which are resis¬
tant, encouraging populations of bene¬
ficial insects that kill pests, and making
scientific use of diseases that also
kill them.
In most cases, the first line of
defence is the use of insecticides and
this will continue to be so for many
years. Unfortunately, they have
several disadvantages; they kill many
beneficial insects, they raise problems
of potentially hazardous residues in
crops, meat or milk, and eventually
some insect strains become them¬
selves able to resist their effects.
With techniques which have been
developed from atomic energy, control
methods are emerging which are more
precise in their application and seem
to eliminate the disadvantages.
Essentially, atomic energy can be used
in two basic ways in the fight. One
of these is to take advantage of
the effects of radiation in direct
attack. The other is to utilize the
radiation from the radioactive atoms of
elements radioisotopes for marking
insects and materials, thereby gaining
information of their habits, life-cycle,
the structure of their bodies, their food,
the effects on them of radiation and
chemicals, and all the other factors
necessary for planning effective cam¬
paigns.
The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) are
actively collaborating to explore and
develop all the highly varied nuclear
methods now available both for waging
the war and for obtaining the intelli¬
gence essential for the "field troops".
They are supported by entomologists
and scientists of many countries and
by other international, regional and
national organizations.
The use of radiation to affect
insects is emerging as a successful
way of control for a number of them.
It has been found that some, when
exposed to the proper amount and
type of radiation at the correct time
during their development, become
incapable of reproducing although
normal in all other respects. The
radiatio»n induces sterility, and when a
sterilized insect mates either with a
normal insect or another which has
been sterilized there is no progeny.
This fact has led to the "sterile male"
method of control or even eradication
of insect pests.
The technique, stated very simply,
is based on the fact that the wild
normal female of a species will mate
with a sterile male as freely as with
a wild normal male. Therefore, if nine
sterile males and one wild male are
present, nine times out of ten the
female will mate with a sterile male
and she will produce no young. The
more sterile males present, the less
the chance of a mating between a
wild male and a wild female. If
sufficient sterile males are present
during several successive generations,
the population of wild insects declines
to zero, provided reinfestation does
not occur.
The first example of the practical
application of the sterile male
technique was in the south-eastern
United States against the screwworm
fly, which lays its eggs in the wounds
of warm-blooded animals. The dev¬
eloping larvae often cause death un¬
less the animal is treated, the result
being great losses of livestock and
wild game animals.
A "fly factory" was constructed in
Florida to rear and sterilize millions

50 million sterilized flies parachuted each week
20
of screwworm flies a week; these
were then released from aircraft over
the entire infested area. The results
were outstanding. This serious live¬
stock pest was completely eradicated
simply because the wild female
screwworm fly mated more often with
sterile laboratory-reared flies than with
other wild flies there were many more
sterile than normal males present.
The cost of the programmes was
about $10 million; but the screwworm
fly was causing an average loss of
about $20 million a year to the live¬
stock industry in the region. This
approach has now extended to the
south-western United States and
northern Mexico.
This success provided a stimulus to
begin research on several other
species of harmful insects. One of
these is the Mediterranean fruit fly
(Medfly for short, Ceratitis capitata to
the entomologist) which attacks many
types of fruit and causes serious
losses. Very much like the common
housefly in appearance, it is spreading
far beyond the Mediterranean and in
recent years has established itself in
the Americas. Research during the
past few years has demonstrated that
the sterile male technique is applicable
in controlling this insect.
At the present time a major
demonstration is being conducted in
Central America. This programme is
being carried out on behalf of the
U.N. Development Programme as a
co-operative undertaking by the IAEA,
FAO, the International Regional Organ¬
ization for Plant and Animal Protec¬
tion (OIRSA), the governments of
Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Hon¬
duras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
Panama (all members of OIRSA),
and the U.S.A.
Many of the problems associated
with enlarging a laboratory project to
a large-scale field project have been
solved. At the present time more than
50,000,000 of the flies are being
reared and sterilized each week.
Most of them are released from the
air over two experimental areas. At
the same time research goes on to
achieve more efficient methods of
rearing, handling, releasing, trapping
and transporting.
It is anticipated that upon completion
of this project, methods will have been
developed which can be used for
large-scale eradication or control
programmes against the Medfly.
Additional research for the same
purpose is being conducted In Italy,
where the International Atomic Energy
Agency is co-operating with the Italian
Atomic Energy Commission in demon¬
strating that the sterile male technique
is effective, and experiments during
1967 on the islands of Capri and
Ischia quite conclusively demonstrat¬
ed its potential. This year experiments
on the use of helicopters for releasing
flies, and to determine the minimum
number of sterile flies necessary to
achieve eradication under conditions
in Italy are being made.
The sterile male technique appears
to be particularly promising for control
or eradication of the olive fly. This
insect, also very similar in appearance
to the housefly, attacks, as the name
implies, the olive fruit. Thus its maxi¬
mum distribution is easily determined.
Preliminary work in Greece, partially
supported by the International Atomic
Energy Agency, has shown that the
technique is effective in cages
constructed over olive trees. The
»experiments will be on a wider scale in
the next few years. The one remain-

ing problem to be solved is how to
rear large numbers of flies cheaply,
and research is being carried out by
the IAEA, at its Seibersdorf Labora¬
tory near Vienna, Austria, and in Por¬
tugal and Spain.
Agricultural scientists in Canada and
the United States have proved that the
codling moth, which causes damage to
apples, pears, and certain other fruit
all over the world, can be controlled in
this way. Insecticide sprays are
effective against it but often kill
beneficial insects, causing increased
damage to the fruit by other species
of harmful insects. It is considered
that the sterile male technique can be
used for codling moth control or, under
isolated conditions, eradication.
There are of course great differ¬
ences in utilizing the sterile male
technique for insect control as com¬
pared with insecticides. Insecticides
can be effectively used by an individual
olive producer in his olive grove. If
he were to use the sterile olive flies
they would soon disperse away from
his own trees. The sterile male tech¬
nique is essentially for use by one or
more countries over large areas. The
problem of reinfestation must be
considered If eradication is the goal.
The technique may be particularly
effective against new introductions of
harmful insects into an area or country,
if the proper research has previously
been done. The Medfly was first
found in Central America in the
mid-1950s. If at that time the tech¬
niques had been developed, a relatively
inexpensive programme would have
eradicated the pest.
The same can be said for the few
times that the pest made its way into
the United States and the one time it
was found in Santiago, Chile. On
these occasions, repeated insecticide
sprays have been used to eradicate
the Medfly. The sterile male tech¬
nique would be very useful under
these conditions, and the time may
well come when it will automatically
be put into operation to prevent new
threats from becoming serious.
The insects already mentioned are
only some of those now being studied
as suitable for atomic means of
control. There are many others, some
of them much more dangerous both
to food and health. Discussions at
the most recent international meeting
in Vienna ranged over ticks, aphids,
mosquitos, wasps, locusts, sugar cane
borers, cotton weevils, pine cater¬
pillars, and the tsetse fly again' to
mention only a few. Much information
was also revealed to assist in making
better use of beneficial insects, of
which the bee is a notable example.
A word about the tsetse fly, whose
ravages make large areas of Africa
precarious for men and animals. It is
too early to raise high hopes about
defeating it, but enough has been
learned to indicate that, difficult as
the problem Is, the new nuclear tech¬
niques, linked with other scientific
approaches, might finally bring relief.
Many years of research lie ahead
and much money will have to be
spent if it can be found. Just as an
indication of the task, we still have
to breed in captivity a tsetse fly
vigorous enough to compete with the
wild specimen. Substitute foods have
not yet been as effective as the warm
blood of living animals.
R ADIOISOTOPES have pro¬
vided scientists with ways of probing
secrets of nature on the most minute
scale ever achieved. They have been
widely used during the past 10 to
15 years in research associated with
insect control. "Labelling" insects
with a material such as radioactive
phosphorus, has enabled entomologists
to follow the movement of insects
under natural conditions.
For example, if Medflies tagged in
this way are released in an orange
grove, their movements can be
accurately followed by trapping, and
using a Geiger counter to find if any
are radioactive. In this way it was
found that Medflies do not ordinarily
move more than a few hundred metres
under favourable conditions. This is a
very important fact to take into consi¬
deration in using the sterile male tech¬
nique. Other insects fly several miles.
Another useful application of radio-
labelled insects is in population density
studies. A known number of tagged
insects are released and a few days
later traps are set up. The ratio of
tagged insects to untagged insects
may be used to estimate the wild
insect population in the area.
When no adequate trapping tech¬
nique is available, insects can be
tagged with gamma-emitting radio¬
isotopes such as cobalt-60. These
can be detected by portable instru¬
ments at distances up to several
meters, enabling the precise location
of the insect to be determined at night,
in the soil, in tree trunks, and in other
places where it cannot be seen.
How is this labelling, or tagging,
done? The radioisotope can be
included in the media used to grow
the insects, fed to the adult insects,
or applied to the body surface. In
certain cases a tiny piece of radio¬
active wire is glued onto the insect.
The procedure varies with the insect
and with the information needed.
The use of radioactive materials has
vastly Increased our knowledge of
insecticides. One or more radio¬
isotopes are incorporated into the
molecules of the chemical during its
manufacture. This does not affect
its biological action, but enables
measurements to be made of
extremely small quantities. Entom¬
ologists and chemists have in this
way been able to study what happens
to the material in insects, animals, soil,
plants, etc.
The fate of insecticides in various
biological systems is important for
several reasons. It has been founa
that some are biochemically converted
in plants and animals to compounds
and become less poisonous or even
non-poisonous to insects. Others
become more poisonous. It is
important to know these facts before
the compounds reach the public.
Radio-labelling has been widely used
to study how insecticides kill. The
objective of this research is to make
new insecticides which will kill
selectively without ill effects to man,
animals and beneficial insects. It is
hoped that this work will ultimately
lead to production of efficient selective
insecticides which can be safely and
economically used.
There are many uses for radio¬
isotopes in fundamental studies of
insect physiology. By tagging certain
naturally occurring compounds in
insects, it is possible to study many of
the enzymes and hormones that
control their development and behav¬
iour. Once these physiological pro¬
cesses are understood, it may be
possible to alter them and perhaps to
control the pest.
As can be seen from this brief
description, atomic energy is a valuable
tool in controlling harmful insects. It
will become more valuable in the future
as more entomologists are trained to
take advantage of the exciting possi¬
bilities it opens up.
