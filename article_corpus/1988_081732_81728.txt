Australia's unique array of unusual
plant and animal life features several



species of "living fossils" including
(1) the platypus (Ornithorhynchus
anatinus) and (2) the echidna or spiny
anteater (Tachyglossus aculeatus), both
of which possess both reptilian
and mammalian characteristics.
Marsupials, particularly abundant
in Australia, belong to a primitive
order of mammals in which gestation
of the young is completed after birth,
in a pouch on the female's body.
Among the Australian marsupials are
(3) the pygmy possum (Burramys
parvus), 14 cm long including its tail,
which was thought to be extinct but
was recently rediscovered in Victoria;
(4) the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus),
a tree-dwelling animal which
resembles a small bear;
(5) the kangaroo (Macropodidae
family). Inset: an emu (Dromaius
novaehollandiae), a large flightless
bird which lives on the plains. (6) The
kangaroo-paw plant (Anigozanthos
manglesit) is the floral emblem
of Western Australia. (7) A climbing
sundew {Drosera menziesii), an insect-
eater, uses another plant for support.
(8) A "grass tree" belonging
to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae.
