BYAKIKOSUEYOSHI
Japanese children's literature came into
being in the second decade of this cen¬
tury. The first literary review to be entirely
devoted to it, Akai tori ("The Bluebird"),
appeared in 191 8. The country was then enjoy¬
ing a period of prosperity, and the liberal cur¬
rent of opinion known as "Taishô democracy"
was in the ascendant. In education, efforts were
being made to develop children's characters and
creativity by introducing them to artistic activ¬
ities, and the emergence of books written specif¬
ically for children seems to have reflected soci¬
ety's sudden upsurge of interest in them. To
begin with, however, the authors were exclu¬
sively male, and women did not play any of
the leading roles in their stories.
Kenji Miyazawa, for instance, ignored
women almost completely. In "Matasaburô
the Wind" (1939), the predominance of male
characters is flagrant. The main character is a
little boy who has just started primary school
in his village. His father features in the story
but his mother never appears, and although the
teacher is not identified, it is evident from the
language he uses that he is a man, while nearly
all the schoolchildren who are named are boys.
There is a similar preponderance of male char¬
acters in "Night Train in the Milky Way",
which tells the story of a young boy's encoun¬
ters aboard a night train, and in "The Life
Story of GusukôBudori" (1941). This imbal¬
ance is understandable in view of the fact that,
at the time, Japanese women had neither real
social position nor employment.
Watarôsan to ushi ("Mr Watarô and the
Cow", 1942), the only one of Nankichi

" I he emergence of books
written specifically for
children reflected Japanese
society's sudden upsurge of
interest in them."
Niimi's highly popular children's stories to
feature a female character, is particularly illu¬
minating about this situation. The main char¬
acter, who lives with his aged mother and an
equally aged cow, is a good sort, but his fond¬
ness for the bottle all too often leads him
astray. Fortunately, his cow knows its way
home and always brings him back when he is
in his cups, acting in this respect like a prop¬
erly dutiful wife. For that reason, Mr Watarô
has no need of a wife, but the reader learns in
the course of the story that when he was
young he had a beautiful, hard-working wife.
At one point, however, he had by force of cir¬
cumstances to choose between his wife and
his old mother, and he unhesitatingly chose to
separate from his wife, whom he sent back to
her family, and look after his mother.
One of Kusurô Makimoto's children's sto¬
ries, Haha no hi ("Mothers' Day", 1937), is
probably the first to have taken the mother's
role as its central theme. On Mothers' Day,
three children prepare the meal in place of their
mother. She is at first delighted but at the same
time confused, since it is traditionally the
woman's role to do all the household jobs,
and with nothing left to do she soon becomes
bored. The next day, things return to normal
and the mother goes about her work, unques-
tioningly and in silence. The idea that she could
have had a hobby or outside interest seems
never to have crossed the author's mind.
I Women take up thepen
It was not until after the war that things began
to change, when women turned to writing
themselves. The image of motherhood became
more substantial but still remained within the
bounds of the role assigned to mothers by
society.
In Momoko Ishii's Non-chan kumo ni
noru ("Non-chan goes up in the clouds",
1947), for example, a little girl who thinks
that her mother has betrayed her over some
trivial matter runs away from home in tears
and falls in a pond on the surface of which
the clouds are reflected. When she comes'
round, she finds herself on a cloud, where she
meets the old "guardian of the clouds". The
story gives the author a chance to describe a
typical Japanese middle-class family of the

time. Non-chan's father is a white-collar
worker and her mother, though a housewife,
is an educated woman and a talented singer. It
later transpires that she would have liked to go
to a school of music, no doubt in the hope of
turning professional, but she is quite happy in
her role of mistress of the house and mother,
and harbours no dreams of venturing outside
the home.
In the 1960s, there was an unprecedented
boom in children's literature. More and more
books were written by women and they con¬
tained more and more female characters the
portrayal of women by women who were
attempting to make young children aware of
what adult life could be like, involving such
unthinkable and absurd events as divorce and
death.
One example of this trend is Chiisai
Momo-chan ("Little Momo-chan", 1964),
which is also the first story to feature a work¬
ing woman. Momo-chan's mother has cho¬
sen to go out to work and has to put her
daughter in a crèche thus proving her to be
a determined woman, since at that time only
the children of single-parent or poor families
were sent to such institutions. Momo-chan's
adventures have remained popular with chil¬
dren and women ever since.
The main character in Toshiko Kanzawa's
Harapcko onabc ("The empty-bellied stew-

murmurs", 1989), a mother is

pot", 1969) is an old cooking pot who has
had enough of feeding other people and
decides to go off and eat lots of delicious
things, despite the efforts of the other kitchen
utensils to try and stop her. In a postscript, the
author, who is a woman, explains that her aim
in telling this story was to describe the "heart's
never-satisfied yearning" and the "sudden feel¬
ing of emptiness that may come over a house¬
wife who spends all her time working for her
husband and children". The fact that Hara¬
pcko onabe is not a work of realism no doubt
made it easier for Toshiko Kanzawa to express
a housewife's dreams and longings.
Career women and
bluestockings
In the 1970s, it was still difficult for women
to combine housekeeping and a career, and
people still looked askance upon single career
women. Yoshiko Okkotsu's Jttsansainonatsu
("The summer of my thirteenth year", 1974)
shows the stereotyped image of the unmarried
woman as a frigid bluestocking.
Little Rie's mother dies in childbirth, and
her father, a feckless drunkard, starts wom¬
anizing. Rie is taken in by her old aunt, an
unmarried teacher of English, who spends her
time reading weighty tomes in a foreign lan¬
guage and never has a kind word for her.
Finally, Rie can no longer bear the icy atmos¬
phere she lives in and runs away to live with her
father's current mistress, a fat, vulgar, unedu¬
cated hairdresser in a working-class suburb
who nevertheless welcomes her with open
arms.
From the 1980s onwards, it became normal
for women to go out to work and they no
longer had to make the choice between their
job and their home. The fathers who appear in
children's books of this period all fit the
stereotype of the career-obsessed man who
devotes all his time to his work and his busi¬
ness relationships and has no time for his-
home and family. More and more stories about
divorce paralleling what was happening in
society appeared at this time.
In Mama no kiiroikozô ("Mummy's little
yellow elephant", 1985), I told the story of a
divorce from the children's viewpoint. The
couple split up because of the husband's infi¬
delity. The mother then passes her driving test
and buys an old car to broaden her horizons.

She does her best to get along without her
husband, but it's not easy. She gets into several
scrapes and even causes a road accident. Her
adventures are presented as comedy, but she is
nevertheless shown as trying to win her inde¬
pendence.
Some authors still write about the woman
who is victimized by her husband and family
but whose life revolves around her home. In

1989), Kciko Takada gives a good description
of such a woman, tormented by doubts about
the validity of the life she is leading. She is a
conscientious mother who dutifully runs the
household and brings up the children. She has
followed her husband as he was posted from
one place to another, taking charge of the
removal each time and making great efforts to
adapt to each new environment. Her husband
gives her no help around the house. They had
two children, but the younger has died of an
illness brought on by pollution and she feels
guilty about the child's death.

heavily and engage in recriminations until
the day when she walks out, leaving a note
explaining to her husband that she wants to be
on her own for three months to try and sort
herself out. The husband, finding himself
alone and incapable of looking after the
domestic arrangements, calls in his mother-
in-law. Three months later, the wife returns
as promised. As a result of this escapade, the
husband finally realizes the importance of
family life, and the marriage gets off to a fresh
start.
In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly all the chil¬
dren's books that dealt with the problems fac¬
ing women in society were written by women,
but the situation has changed since the early
1990s, when some male authors started to take
an interest in women's issues. One of them is
Hiko Tanaka, whose Kalendâ ("Calendar",
1992) contrasts the women of his grandpar¬
ents' generation, whose lives were only the
lives of "daughters, wives and mothers", with
those of the younger generation, for whom "a
different life exists". M
