CARNIVAL IN LUANDA
BY DOMINGOS VAN-DUNEM
I spent part of my childhood at
Museke Marçal, a poor district of the
city of Luanda where, people used to
say, "the children only bathe when
rain fills the lagoon of Moreira".
There, fifty-odd years ago, my family
and I enjoyed the bittersweet
privilege of taking part in that match¬
less popular spectacle, the Luanda
carnival.
The city was divided into districts,
each of which was the territory of
one of the traditional troupes known
as turmas which with their "kings"
were the life and soul of the carnival.
The two most famous turmas were
O Coraçào (The Heart) and Os Inveja-
dos (The envied ones). Members of
the troupes practised a kind of verbal
jousting known as kazakuta, which
is still the most typical expression of
Luandan folklore.
The turmas began to mobilize in
December, when their most gifted
members rehearsed songs for the car¬
nival. The songs were sung either in
Kimbundu, one of the national lan¬
guages, if they were about unusual
or satirical subjects, or in Portuguese
or in both languages if they were in¬
offensive or ambiguous. The singers
met secretly in private homes or in
rented halls. Violations of secrecy
were severely punished. Dance re¬
hearsals were also held in secret.
The carnival supported a small in¬
dustry, notably the metalworker's art.
Domingos Venenohis name meant
"venom", for although he was a
skinny fellow he was a doughty
fighteris still remembered for the
lamps and the objects decorated with
¡mages and amulets which he made
in complete secrecy. He was a devot¬
ed supporter of O Coráceo, and
worked exclusively for them. Design¬
ers and dressmakers also worked
secretly and exclusively for their
favourite groups.
The first public rehearsal was held
on the first Sunday of January, and
the dress rehearsal took place on the
Saturday before Ash Wednesday
when people prayed to the divinity
that the carnival should take place in
"peace and tranquillity". It cannot be
denied, however, that violent scuffles
often broke out between the turmas.
Early on the Sunday morning the
flags of the turmas were hoisted at 47

48
the gateways to the districts, in the
midst of crowds of excited children.
Then, to the sound of shouting and
applause, they were carried down¬
town by a gang of strapping fellows.
More and more people joined in the
processions as they wended their way
to Ambuilas, a sports ground in the
middle of a big open space where the
rival groups paraded side by side. The
group that won most applause was
judged the winnerthe verdict was
never disputed.
That afternoon all the huts were
empty. No one would have dreamed
of missing the festival. People flocked
in, even from other towns. The at¬
mosphere was euphoric. The mem¬
bers of the turmas wore devils' masks
and brightly coloured costumes much
admired by the crowd. Whistling and
trumpeting rent the air, drums rolled,
the crowds sang in unison. Then
everyone returned to Ambuilas for
another competition.
O Caraçâo and A Fineza (Subtlety),
eternal rivals, submitted their
costumes to the judgement of the
public.
The king of A Fineza, Kamalundu,
a cobbler with bulging eyes, held
himself majestically, leaning slightly
forward. He waved his right hand,
which he had slipped into a zinc
gauntlet, another emblem of the two
turmas.
The enemy king, Epifanio, now ap¬
peared. He too leaned forward slight¬
ly, brandishing a gauntlet which, as
a metalworker, he had made himself.
Both kings proudly entered the lists,
showing off their beautiful costumes
which were inspired by the royal
finery of old Europe. On their heads
glittered zinc crownswe called
them helmetswhich each one had
decorated so as to outdo the other.
Everyone danced frenetically. The
kings, enthroned amidst their court,
dominated the turmas, surrounded
by figures in disguise, some wearing
black cloaks as emblems of the stu¬
dents they would never be, others
dressed in doctors' or nurses' smocks.
Then all present walked to the palace
to join up with other groups and pay
their respects to the governor, who
stood on the balcony with his distin¬
guished guests and saluted the
revellers.
Tuesday was the day to end all
days. No one let up for a second. An
N
enormous crowd raced here, there
and everywhere, enjoying every
minute. Lovers of jousting tried their
hand at kazakuta. Peals of laughter
rang out incessantly as the kazaku-
teiros made fun of everyone and
mocked the ups and downs of life.
Washerwomen cast an irresistible
spell as they cleverly satirized "ladies"
who only the day before had been
lowly servants. Greengrocers
described their tangles with cus¬
tomers who did nothing but grum¬
ble and protest about the poor
quality and high price of their
vegetables.
The governor declared a holiday,
and we all lived each moment as if
it were our last, as if we were afraid
of losing forever the delights of this
incomparable festival. Men and
women abandoned themselves to
delirium. A mother wandered
around, desperately beating a tin can
with her weary hand as she asked
whether anyone happened to have
seen her son, who had got lost in the
general confusion.
Girls dressed in beautiful white
dominoes alighted like butterflies,
arousing the curiosity of the boys and
the jealousy of lovers.
So the carnival went on until
WednesdayAsh Wednesday ac¬
cording to the liturgical calendar, the
Wednesday of mabangas, the shell¬
fish of good luck.
The troupes were tired. The masks
were falling to pieces. Four people
held out a sheet for a collection to
buy mabangas, which were plentiful
in that region and, copiously washed
down, made a meal during which
people took stock of the year that
was past and made plans for the
future.
