In “The Parable of the Mustard Seed”,
the Buddha teaches a lesson that is va l i d
for all cultures:human beings receive no
e xemption from mort a l i t y. Deep in the
throes of grief after the death of her son, a
woman seeks wisdom from the Buddha,
who says that he does indeed have an ans-
wer to her queri e s. Before giving it, h owe-
ve r , he insists that she must first collect a
grain of mustard seed from eve ry house that
has not been touched by deat h . She can-
vasses her entire community, but fails to col-
lect a single seed. R e t u rning to the Buddha,
she understands that , like all other living
beings, we are destined to die.

Staving off death may sometimes compromise a fundamental value, the quality of human life.
D e ath is a defining characteristic of
human experi e n c e .Ye t , while the event of
d e ath remains elusively beyond human
c o n t r o l , the process of dying has increasin-
gly been brought into the domain of medi-
cine and life-extending technologi e s. S o m e
t e c h n o l o gi e s , including organ transplan-
t at i o n ,r e s p i r at o rs , antibiotics like penicil-
l i n , and feeding tubes, enable life to be pro-
l o n g e d . Other technologies may hasten
death.
The decision to use these technologi e s
is a moral choice, because it invo l ves a deci-
sion about a fundamental human good, t h e
p r e s e rvation of life.Ye t , in some situat i o n s ,
a resort to technology to stave off deat h
comes at a price of compromising another
fundamental human va l u e , the quality of
t h at life. Decisions about continuing treat-
ment for the dying or of allowing death to
take place by foregoing or term i n ating such
t r e at m e n t , or even by phy s i c i a n - a s s i s t e d
suicide or euthanasia are thus both existen-
tially and ethically agonizing.As individuals
and their families face these controve rs i a l
questions and as many countries consider
revising their laws on end-of-life choices,
r e l i gious traditions and values can offer gui-
dance and insight, if not solutions.
H i s t o ri c a l l y, r e l i gious communities have
sought to appropri ate death within the life
cycle through rituals of remembrance, a n d
r e l i gious teachings have emphasized that
d e ath brings meaning to mort a l i t y.The pro-
cess of dying is often port r ayed as an inv i t a-
tion to spiritual insight and a key moment

The advance of technologies to prolong life and control dying can raise agonizing 
moral dilemmas. What guidance is offered by the great world religions?

making capacity, but also by relat i o n s h i p s
(with loved ones, for example) and bodily
i n t e gri t y. These characteristics support
human responsibility in addressing end of
life decisions, including refusals of medical
procedures that invade the body with no
real benefit , in the context of a caring com-
m u n i t y. Put another way, p r e s e rving life is
not an absolute good in and of itself. Life is
a good that opens the way to achieving
higher goods that constitute the religi o u s
self.
So by looking within the moral para-
meters set by these three values of soverei-
g n t y, s t e wa r d s h i p, and the self, we find that
a patient can decide to forego life support.
A doctor can also allow a patient to die if
the continuation of life (by technologi c a l
means) assaults the dignity of the pers o n —
if it attacks their rationality, freedom,rela-
tionships with others or their bodily inte-
gri t y.C e rt a i n l y, differences can be discern e d
between these traditions precisely over the
p ri o rity of these goods.For example, O rt h o-
dox Jewish thought emphasizes the sancti-
ty of life (as displayed in bodily integri t y )
which translates into a stronger commit-
ment to life-extending technologies than in
Roman Cat h o l i c i s m , which stresses the
capacity for human relationships as a thre-
shold for determining the permissibility of
stopping life support.
The monotheistic faiths have also focu-
sed a gr e at deal on the legalization of phy-
sician assistance in hastening death by pro-
viding a terminally ill patient with a lethal
p r e s c ription of medicat i o n . In each instan-
c e , arguments supporting phy s i c i a n - a s s i s-
ted suicide have to overcome a long-stan-
ding prohibition of suicide. For a va riety of
r e a s o n s , suicide is sinful according to the
three traditions. Suicide constitutes a wrong
against one’s nature and personal dignity
( “ r e l i gious self” ) . It also harms the com-
munity and violates the sovereignty of God.
As a result, a physician assisting in suicide
may be seen as a moral accomplice in evil,
u n d e rmining the sacred covenant of the
healer.
H owe ve r , some faith communities in
Protestant Christianity and in Reform e d
Judaism have argued otherwise.When fa c e d
with terminal illness, one may well be dis-
posed to ending life, and one’s immediat e
community (or family) may support this
method of deat h .These kinds of arguments

in the cultivation of spiritual identit y.
The wo r l d ’s gr e at traditions of moral
wisdom all begin with a strong predisposi-
tion to favour the preservation of life,
although the specific reasons for this conv i c-
tion va ry from tradition to tradition.Tu r-
ning first to three monotheistic religious tra-
ditions which have had global influ e n c e ,
J u d a i s m ,C h ristianity and Islam, for all their
d i f f e r e n c e s , basically address ethical issues
concerning the end of life from a common
value pers p e c t i ve . In part i c u l a r ,d i s c u s s i o n s
centre on the values of sove r e i g n t y, s t e-
wardship, and the self.
S overeignty denotes that the lives and
bodies of persons are created by, and ulti-
m ately return to,G o d .We owe our existen-
ce to a loving Being who has gr a c i o u s l y
brought us into being. T h u s , the funda-
mental passages in human life, i n c l u d i n g
b i rth and deat h , are of divine concern .T h i s
u n d e rstanding of sovereignty has signific a n t
i m p l i c ations for decision-making at the end
of life. It bestows sacredness upon human
l i f e , which supports the impulse towa r d s
p r e s e rving life by available medical tech-
n o l o gi e s.Yet sovereignty also entails that the
ultimate authority for deciding our mortal
passages belongs to God. Human beings
must not ove rstep these boundari e s , or so
to speak “play God”with life and death.
‘Agents of God’
Through the value of stewa r d s h i p, we
are considered “agents of God”, called to
c a rry out the work of divine intent on eart h .
This task entails decision-making respon-
sibilities for which we are accountable:our
actions either further or violate divine intent.
In addition, as emphasized in Islamic tea-
c h i n g,we are the trustees or stewards of our
b o d i e s.We are therefore entrusted with the
capacities and responsibility to make appro-
p ri ate decisions when confronting a treat-
ment choice at the end of our own life or
that of a loved one.
I n d e e d , with ve ry few exceptions, t h e
major faith traditions of the West have rejec-
ted a view known as “ v i t a l i s m ” , which holds
t h at biological life is to be preserved at all
costs and with all available technologi e s.
Vitalism is considered theologically mista-
ken because it appears to make divine will
and intent contingent upon the state of
medical technology. In other wo r d s , it puts
technology in the role of God.
The dignity of pers o n s , linked to the
notion of “ s e l f” , is another core value of
these monotheistic faith traditions. In Je w i-
sh and Christian thought,this is expressed
in the idea that humans are distinctively in
the “image of God”.Islamic theology does
not use such language, but no less affirm s
the significant value of pers o n s.The “ r e l i-
gious self” is constituted in part by the per-
s o n ’s rat i o n a l i t y, f r e e d o m , and decision-
stress the dignity of the individual as a free
decision-maker (which also applies to per-
sons entrusted with the decision-making
responsibilities of others ) .This dignity pro-
vides the basis for a political and philoso-
phical claim to self-determ i n ation and opens
the possibility for choosing the timing, cir-
cumstances and method of one’s deat h .S o
p hysicians may be permitted to hasten deat h
by prescribed medicat i o n s , or even by admi-
nistering lethal medication.Yet they would
never be obligated to do so.
M a ny religious communities have
denounced the question of legalizing phy-
sician euthanasia,or administrating death.
The most vigorous opposition has come
from the Roman Catholic tradition, w i t h
Pope John Paul II describing euthanasia as
an example of the “culture of deat h ” in We s-
t e rn societies.The Pope believes euthana-
sia is a manifestation of social views that
h ave abandoned the protection of life and
lent support to liberalized abort i o n ,c a p i t a l
punishment,and incessant warfare. In
g e n e r a l , much religious opposition is based
on concern for patients who may be in vul-
nerable positions because of their illness or
their lack of social and economic resources.
There is fear that patients who cannot afford
e x p e n s i ve treat m e n t , for example, will be
pressured to accept euthanasia.There is also
gr e at concern about the moral nature of the
d o c t o r ’s professional self. Islamic teaching,
for example, stresses the phy s i c i a n ’s com-
mitment or covenant to healing. E u t h a n a-
sia would violate this sacred role.
Although few in number, there are indi-
vidual theologians within both the Je w i s h
and Christian traditions for whom eutha-
nasia is not a contradiction but a culmina-
tion of religious values such as compassion,
mercy, and love.By joining these values to
respect for self-determ i n at i o n , some theo-
l o gians can find a way of tolerating eutha-
nasia as a final resort.
Eastern faith traditions
To die we l l ,s ay the teachers of eastern
r e l i gi o n s , one must live we l l .The views of
e a s t e rn religious traditions and philosophies
h ave been ve ry influential in global unders-
tanding about providing appropri ate care
to the dying. For example, the pioneeri n g
work of the Swiss-born psychiat ri s t
D r. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in unders t a n-
ding the experiences of dying patients in
We s t e rn medical institutions drew direct-
ly on understandings of the meaning of
“good death”and “stages”in life in Hindu
t r a d i t i o n . Buddhist values of compassion,
n o n - v i o l e n c e , and suffering have also
i n fluenced the discourse of We s t e rn medi-
cal ethics.The ethical tension in these two
traditions about end-of-life choices is roo-
ted in two main va l u e s ,l i b e r ation and a h i m-
sa (non-violence).
Judaism, Christianity
and Islam basically address
e t h i cal issues concerning
the end of life from
a common value perspective

In Hinduism and Buddhism, h u m a n
beings are captured in endless cycles of
r e b i rth and reincarn ation (k a rm a - s a m s a ra) .
The goal of mortal life is detachment from
the mat e rial wo r l d ,c u l m i n ating in the libe-
r ation of the true self from the body-mind
c o m p l e x .To experience the good life and
the good deat h , we must be constantly
aware of the ultimate trajectory towa r d s
liberation.
In both traditions, all living creat u r e s
( h u m a n s , a n i m a l s , p l a n t s , e t c.) represent
manifestations of the laws of karmic rebir-
t h .To honour these law s , one must show
gr e at respect for the preservation of life and
n o n - i n j u ry of sentient beings. Acts des-
t ru c t i ve of life are morally condemned by
the principle of a h i m s a, which is the concep-
tual equivalent of the We s t e rn principle of
the sanctity of life. In most circumstances
ahimsa b e a rs a moral bias towards life-pre-
s e rvat i o n .Yet there is some ethical fle x i b i l i-
ty which opens the possibility of foregoing
t r e atment or seeking assistance to hasten
death.
As a general ru l e , both Hinduism and
Buddhism oppose suicide as an act of des-
t r oying life. H owe ve r , a distinction is made
in both traditions between self-regarding
(or self-destru c t i ve) reasons and other-
regarding (or compassionate) motives for
seeking deat h .To commit suicide over the
loss of a child or because of economic hard-
ship (self-regarding reasons) is to commit
a morally reprehensible act which refle c t s
the individual’s ignorance about the nat u-
re of life and human destiny. Instead of
achieving the ultimate spiritual goal of libe-
r at i o n , a person who acts in this way will
remain trapped in the ongoing karmic cy c l e
of life-deat h - r e b i rt h .Those who assist in
this suicide may also be subject to karm i c
p u n i s h m e n t , for they have violated the pri n-
ciple of ahimsa.
H owe ve r , a ve ry different pers p e c t i ve
emerges when individuals seek death for
s p i ritual motive s , of which there are
basically two kinds.The first revo l ves around
c o m p a s s i o n ; c o n c e rn for the we l fare of
others as one is dying can be seen as a sign
of spiritual enlightenment. So a person can
decide to forego treatment to avoid impo-
sing a heavy burden of caregiving on fami-
ly or fri e n d s. He or she may also stop treat-
ment to relieve loved ones of the emotional
or economic distress of prolonged dying.
The spiritual goal of liberation can also
be seen as an ethical reason for seeking or has-
tening deat h . When physical sufferi n g
impedes self-control and lucidity, it is per-
missible to shorten life.Pain or lethargy might
cloud the awareness and consciousness at
d e ath that both Hindus and Buddhists belie-
ve is necessary to ensure a favourable rebir-
t h .Extreme suffering might also cause someo-
ne to be so attached to their mat e rial life
(bodily condition) that they cannot purs u e
the ultimate spiritual goal of liberation from
the mat e rial wo r l d .
This pat t e rn of reasoning—the pri m a-
cy of spiritual goals of liberation or com-
passion relat i ve to the preservation of life—
also applies to euthanasia through phy s i c i a n
injection or administration of a lethal dru g .
Hindu and Buddhist scholars have found
s u p p o rt for this so-called “ a c t i ve ” e u t h a-
nasia in their traditions by reflecting on the
meaning of death as a door to liberat i o n ,t h e
c u l m i n ation of life in detachment from the
m at e rial wo r l d .They then go a step furt h e r
by linking compassion to the norm of self-
similitude:“one should act towards others
as one would have them act toward one-
self”.So euthanasia can be seen as a com-
p a s s i o n ate act or a “ m e r cy killing” for a
dying person striving to the highest purp o-
se of human destiny, liberation.
A moral problem arises with euthana-
s i a , h owe ve r , if the administered medica-
tion renders the patient unconscious or
unable to comprehend their descent towa r d
d e at h .The patient is unaware precisely at
the moment when he or she should be most
s e n s i t i ve and receptive to spiritual teaching
and meaning. For these reasons, o t h e r
modes of bri n ging about death are prefe-
rable morally and religiously. n
To die well,
say the teachers
of eastern religions,
one must live well
Hindus and Buddhists believe that it may be permissible to shorten life when physical suffering impedes a patient’s self-control and lucidity.
