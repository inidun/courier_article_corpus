In a Strasbourg (France) laboratory, a speck of blood for genetic analysis 
is taken from a boot.



DNA 
IN THE DOCK 
◗ Martine Jacot
Genetic fingerprinting provides virtually flawless proof and is helping to identify criminals and
free people jailed for crimes they did not commit. But does it violate basic human rights?
■
Police and judges in We s t e rn countri e s
all agree that the arri val of genetic tes-
ting in their daily lives is a far more
r e vo l u t i o n a ry development than the intro-
duction of fin g e rp rinting at the end of the
19th century. It is now just about impossible
to say a criminal has “disappeared without
l e aving any trace,” e ven if he or she wo r e
g l ove s.
Forensic science has made a great leap
forward since 1985,when British scientist
Alex Jeffreys discovered a new way of
identifying people genetically through
their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the
molecule at the core of each living cell. It
is now possible to draw up a person’s
genetic identity card within five or six
hours at minimal cost1 working from infi-
nitesimal pieces of evidence,2 such as a
minute speck of blood, a single hair, a
trace of saliva left on a cigarette butt, a
stamp, a glass or a toothbrush,from sweat
on clothing or, more important, a tiny
drop of a rapist’s sperm. However despite
this “proof”, we should remember that
just because a person’s “traces”have been
found at the scene of a crime, it does not
necessarily mean they are guilty.

Except in the case of identical twins,
the structure of a pers o n ’s DNA is

contains chromosomes. The rest of it,

lities, at least not yet, and is partly made
up of identical sequences. It is these
“repeat units”that are analysed to compi-
le a person’s genetic profile, which takes
the form of a series of figures. These data
are like bar codes which can be easily sto-
red as a computer file. This is a positive
development, say many Western crimino-
logists and the families of crime victims.
Defenders of civil liberties who predict
new Orwellian nightmares, beg to differ.
An Afro-American called A.B. Butler
is one of those whose life was saved by
DNA testing. He was freed in January
1999 after 16 years in prison in Tyler,
Texas, and his 99-year jail sentence for
kidnapping and raping a young white
woman in 1983 was quashed. As soon as
he heard about DNA tests, he asked to be
given one, knowing that the police had
kept a sample of the rapist’s sperm.Three
laboratories confirmed that his genetic
fingerprint was not that of the rapist.
Since the FBI began testing people’s
DNA in 1989, at least 54 pri s o n e rs serv i n g
long sentences, mostly for rape, h ave been
declared innocent in the United Stat e s.T h e
defence of 35 of them was handled by the
l aw school at New Yo r k ’s Ye s h i va Unive rs i t y
as part of the Innocence Project (IP) laun-
ched in 1992 by Prof. B a rry Scheck. T h e
p r o j e c t ’s goal is to make DNA tests routine
when evidence has been kept in the case of
p ri s o n e rs who claim to be innocent bu t

h i g h . Six of the pri s o n e rs freed by the
e f f o rts of the students and teachers invo l ve d
in the project were on death row.
Building databases
“Genetic testing can also help find the
real criminal more quickly,” s ays Scheck.“ I t

time and money in an inve s t i g at i o n . It can

at the scene of the crime and then kept at the
right temperature and analysed by reliable
laboratories.

h ave already helped pinpoint the authors
of more than 200 cri m e s , though so fa r
only sex offences and violent cri m e s.
Resistance to the compilation of such
databases has focused on one key ques-
tion. Should a sample for a DNA test be
taken from someone without their per-
mission? The law in Western countries is
not always clear on this but the principle
has been accepted—in Germ a ny, t h e
N e t h e r l a n d s , N o r way, S we d e n , F r a n c e
and the U.S.—that a sample of blood or
saliva can be taken on the orders of a
judge or a police officer in the course of
an investigation.
But the line between police require-
ments and individual liberties is still a ve ry
hazy one. “When there’s an inve s t i g at i o n
among the inhabitants of a village after a
c ri m e , sample-taking should be vo l u n t a ry,”
s ays Jean Michaud, a member of the
French National Ethics Committee, “ yet a
refusal (to allow a DNA test) can be inter-
preted as grounds for suspicion.”
M a ny police admit howe ver that a per-
s o n ’s DNA can always be analysed from
their confis c ated toothbrush or their coffee
cup without them know i n g, which does
not directly violate their “ p hysical pers o n ”
or their “human dignity”, concepts reco-
gnized in laws on bioethics that have been
passed in many We s t e rn countri e s. S u c h
“ u n fair methods” are clearly condemned
in theory but not explicitly by law.
Constitutional protection
In the United Stat e s , the Massachusetts
state legislature passed a law in 1997 allo-
wing the archiving of data on convicted cri-
minals with retroactive effect. All pri s o n
i n m ates in the state were therefore “ a s k e d ”
to give a blood sample, ostensibly for the
“ s t at i s t i c a l ” reason that many pri s o n e rs
commit new crimes after their release.But
some refused, citing—on the advice of their
l aw ye rs—the fourth amendment to the
U. S . constitution which protects citizens
against “unreasonable searches and sei-
suppose the existence of ways to compare
the genetic profile of someone being sought
and the profile of a suspect. This means
building a database of genetic fin g e rp ri n t s.
In the absence of such dat a b a s e s , police in
the We s t e rn world inve s t i g ating seri o u s
c rimes proceed by trial and err o r ,a n a l y s i n g
DNA from entire villages and neighbou-
r h o o d s.
Police in Britain,who were pioneers in
the field, created such a database in 1995
“backed by women’s groups who suppor-
ted technology that could identify rapists
quickly,” says Peter Martin,a former chief
of Scotland Yard’s laboratories. “When it
was then found that rapists often already
had a record of petty crime,” the databa-
se was expanded.
An identikit picture
from a piece of chewing gum
In Bri t a i n , a nyone arrested or suspec-
ted of a crime can be asked to provide a
s a l i va sample to compile their DNA iden-
tity card. The database currently has the
“bar codes” of about 700,000 people, a n d
in 10 ye a rs time five million of the coun-
t ry ’s 58.6 million people are expected to be
in it. In five ye a rs , the database has enabled
thousands of matches or “cold hits” to be
made that Martin says have led to the
i d e n t i fic ation of more than 260 murderers ,
400 rapists and 2,500 bu r g l a rs.
Police everywhere are naturally keen
to gather all the information they can.
Some are now dreaming of being able to
make an identikit picture of a criminal
just from a piece of chewing gum found
near the scene of the crime. Current ana-
lysis done on non-coding DNA by the
PCR3 method enables the sex of a person
to be determined but not the age or
colour of hair or eyes. But it will be pos-
sible in the future, scientists say. Some
human rights defence organizations say
such cataloguing must stop immediately
and deplore the inadequacy of safeguards
to protect individual liberties.
The fiercest debate about this issue is
r a ging in the United States around the
F B I ’s launch in October 1998 of a nat i o n a l
d at a b a s e , C o d i s , which combines biologi-
cal and computer processes to link up
d atabases in each of the 50 U. S .s t at e s.T h e
FBI says it has 260,000 files on people that
zures”.A Boston court set a precedent in
August 1998 by ruling in their favour and
giving the opinion that taking DNA
samples without permission was a clear vio-
lation of human rights.
“Why don’t we make a database of all
poor people?” asked one of the prisoners’
lawyers, Benjamin Keehn. “Are they also
more likely to commit crimes? Where do
you stop?” The protest against such
moves, which has spread to other states,is
organized by the American Civil Liberties
Union ( ACLU) Freedom Netwo r k , w h i c h
has 250,000 members.The ACLU appea-
led before the National Commission on
the Future of DNA Evidence, a 19-mem-
ber body of distinguished experts set up
at the request of President Bill Clinton,
against the extension of the federal Codis
system to any person who was arrested.
AC L U ’s associate director, B a rry
Steinhardt, said it would mean “equating
arrest with guilt” and would give “police
officers, rather than judges and juries, the
power to force persons to provide the
state with evidence that harbours many of
their most intimate secrets and those of

3. Polymerase Chain Reaction, or genetic
amplification, which became routine in the late
1980s,is the fastest, cheapest and most accurate
method. It requires less DNA than the earlier
RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism) method, which is no longer used
in Western countries. It is now possible,by
looking at a specific marker on sex chromosomes,
to identify a person’s sex by PCR.
‘When there’s an investigation

of a village after a crime,

for suspicion.’

their blood relatives.”
Another set of vital questions arises
from this debate. Who owns the DNA
used to establish a person’s genetic ID—
the person concern e d , the laborat o ry
which did the test, or the police? Should
the sample be destroyed or kept, and if
kept, for how long? The “bar codes” in the
files may for the moment be of little use to
s n o o p e rs , but the “ o ri gi n a l ” D N A
samples contain chromosomes and there-
fore a mass of genetic information about
the person and their relatives,since the 23
pairs of chromosomes we all have are pas-
sed down half and half from each of our
parents.
Who can guarantee that the DNA
samples held in the police databases and
laboratories will not one day be analysed
by nosy people working for, s ay, l i f e
insurance companies to find out if someo-
ne is likely to develop this or that disease?
G e rm a ny, A u s t ri a , F i n l a n d , S we d e n ,
Denmark and the Netherlands have all
removed this risk by ordering the destruc-
tion of the samples once the ID has been
established. Other countries allow police
and labs to keep them—forever in Britain,
for 40 years in France’s planned database
and for various periods in different U.S.
states. The excuse is usually that the
sample might need to be examined again
in the future.
A Pandora’s box
Especially in the last group of coun-
t ri e s , n o n - g ove rnmental organizat i o n s
and ethics committees have criticized 
the growth of “small genetic databases”
collected by laboratories with government
authorization and by private firms acting
in accordance with the law.
Steinhardt points to a survey carri e d
out by the A m e rican Management
A s s o c i ation which found that six per cent
of employe rs were already using genetic
tests as part of job-hiring procedures
without the knowledge of the candidat e s.
The Pe n t a g o n , he told the U. S . c o m m i s-
s i o n ,c u rrently has samples from three mil-
lion of its present and former employees in
a database ori ginally set up to help identi-
fy soldiers killed in the Viet Nam Wa r.
“Once the genetic information is col-
lected and banked, pressures will mount
to use it for other purposes than those for
which it was gathered,” he said. “In fact,
on several occasions, the FBI has already
requested access to this data for purposes
of criminal investigations.”
P r o f. Philip Reilly, a member of the
c o m m i s s i o n , a gr e e s. “There is a prolifera-
tion of databases with DNA in all sorts of
areas in our society which theoretically
could be linked one way or another.” H e
also notes that “ we already collected in
1999 blood from 99.8 per cent of the
babies born in the United States and we
are storing it without their consent.We also
subject it to DNA analysis in some cases.”
The U.S. commission finally recom-
mended that details of the 15 million
people arrested in the U.S. every year not
be archived at federal level. ACLU says it
will fight the establishment of any genetic
database, which it regards as a Pandora’s
box. It is also contesting in court a recent
Massachusetts law which authorizes dis-
closure of details from the police genetic
d atabase for undefined “ h u m a n i t a ri a n
purposes”.
The easier science makes it to compile
genetic profiles from DNA, the more urgent
it becomes to have effective safeguards
against the possible misuse4 of the genetic
