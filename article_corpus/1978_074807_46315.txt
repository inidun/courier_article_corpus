The wall paintings of Koguryo
A fresco
of
daily life
THE tombs of kings and nobles,
discovered during recent decades
along the middle reaches of the Yalu
river in the T'ung-kou plain of south Man¬
churia and in the basin of the Taedong
river, near P'yongyang, represent the
height of artistic and architectural develop¬
ment of the ancient kingdom of Koguryo
(37B.C.-668A.D.).
The sites of the tombs were selected by
diviners for their favourable aspects and are
scattered widely over the countryside.
Some fifty of them are decorated with wall
paintings of great beauty which provide
precious information on the beliefs, the
organization and the daily life of the society
of the period. The architectural skill with
which these tombs were built is evidenced
by the design of the vaulting and the
placing of the pillars. Long buried beneath
their protective mounds of earth, the
tombs exemplify the deliberate marriage of
the aesthetic with the functional.

The royal procession, a mural in King Michon's tomb.
The wall paintings, which are in a
remarkable state of preservation, deal with
a wide variety of subjects.
In the "Two Pillars Tomb", two corteges
wend their way along the walls of the
entrance corridor, traverse the ante¬
chamber, finally converging at the far end
of the main chamber where a man and a
woman are seen seated on a dais.
The huge fourth century tomb of king
Michon, at Anak in the province of Hwang¬
hae, comprises four fully decorated cham¬
bers. Its most remarkable mural is a six-
metre-long portrayal of a royal procession.
The king, seated in an ox-drawn carriage, is
escorted by mounted and foot guards and
a host of retainers and clowns, in all 250
figures. Surprisingly, although almost all
these figures represent conventional
categories nobles, functionaries, monks,
servants, jugglers, etc. each figure is dif¬
ferent, and so are the features of each face.
So subtly are the varieties of expression
rendered that it seems as though each
figure was a real man or woman known to
the artists. The same sorupulous attention
to detail can be seen in the portrayal of
weapons, armour, carriages and land¬
scape.
The Koguryo tomb paintings also pre¬
sent a veritable bestiary, including domest¬
ic and wild animals, real and mythological
beasts, the latter representing the points of
the compass. It was also in the kingdom of
Koguryo that astronomers compiled the
first Korean star maps, such as that painted
on the ceiling of the principal chamber of
the Tomb of the Dancers.
An infinite variety of ornamental motifs
adorn the Koguryo tombs; lotus flowers
and honeysuckle tendrils entwine the pillars
and enliven the ceiling panels, testifying to
the rich artistic technique and the inex¬
haustible inventiveness of the anonymous
artists who produce these masterpieces of
a bygone age.
The wall paintings of
the Anak tombs and
the Tomb of the Three
Chambers are rich in
information on a wide
variety of costumes.
