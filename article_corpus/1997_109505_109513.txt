hsurance: halting
an ominous trend
BY GERHARD BERZ
The insurance industry is adapting in response to growing risk from natural disasters
Over the last ten years, major natural dis¬
asters have caused economic losses
amounting to more than $400 billion
and insured losses of some $100 billion. Com¬
pared with disaster losses in the 1960s the eco¬
nomic loss burden has increased eight-fold,
discounting inflation, and insured losses by as
much as fifteen-fold.
Individual disasters like Hurricane Andrew
(U.S.A., 1992) have cost as much as $30 bil¬
lion in economic damages, two thirds of which
was borne by the insurance industry. Where
there was only one insured disaster loss exceed¬
ing $1 billion before 1987, eighteen such dis¬
asters have occurred since then.
These trends toward a new dimension of
loss potential are primarily caused by a rapidly
growing concentration of people and prop¬
erty in towns and cities, especially in coastal
regions and other areas highly exposed to nat¬
ural hazards.

This dramatic and skewed growth of
insured losses is changing the insurance indus¬
try. Availability of cover against natural disas¬
ters used to be mainly a matter of the right
price. Nowadays it is much more a matter of
capacity. The world reinsurance industry, which
handles most catastrophe risks and had a huge
stake in recent disasters 98 per cent in both the
1985 Mexico earthquake and Hurricane Gilbert
(Jamaica, 1988) and 65 per cent in the Euro¬
pean winter storms of 1990 has realized the
precariousness of giving unlimited propor-

tional catastrophe coverage and has switched
to limited non-proportional coverage.
This shrinkage of insurance capacity will
mean more even distribution of disaster risk
among the four parties concerned insurer,
reinsurer, insured and government. The first
two will still bear most of the burden, but
where losses look like being more than the
insurers could bear, governments will have to
help out as "last-resort" insurers or else give tax
relief so as to preserve the insurance companies'
catastrophe reserves. Even so, the insurance
industry must seize every opportunity to
stop or reverse the ominous rising trend in
loss burdens from natural disasters.
Preparingfor the worst
Insurance is by definition a form of disaster
preparedness. It represents an important, if
not decisive, prerequisite for many economic
activities. Without insurance cover, engineer¬
ing projects in highly exposed regions, such as
offshore installations in the North Sea, or
power stations in earthquake zones, would

be a gamble with a high risk of failure that no
business enterprise could take on.
Consequently the development and appli¬
cation of modern technologies and the eco¬
nomic development of regions where the risk
level is high or unknown have always been
accompanied and promoted by the insurance
industry. Often enough these ventures have
ended with adverse results and sometimes in
total loss. This makes it all the more important
for insurers to assess the risk as realistically as
possible and to bring all available knowhow to
bear on the process. In so doing, they very
often find themselves at the forefront of sci¬
entific and technological development.
I Financial incentives
Once people are insured for a risk, they often
forget about it and lose interest in taking any loss
prevention measures. Insurers must counteract
this mode of thought and behaviour, and they
can best do so by applying financial incentives.
If they unload part of the loss onto the
insured by means of a substantial deductible
a clause in the insurance policy relieving the
insurer of responsibility for an initial amount
of the loss or some other form of "co-insur¬
ance", but at the same time reward him or her
with an equally substantial premium rebate,
they can very effectively motivate the policy¬
holder to prevent losses.
The number of loss cases eligible for set¬
tlement in natural disasters is drastically
reduced by relatively modest deductibles,
because such disasters always entail a large,
sometimes enormous number of minor losses.
Alerting thepublic
Insurance companies publish information in
the form of leaflets, brochures, films and TV
spots in order to alert the public to risks and
draw attention to the precautions they could
take. In the past, such information campaigns
have concentrated on fire, accident and bur¬
glary prevention, but today efforts are shift¬
ing more and more to natural hazards, where
many possibilities for loss prevention have so
far scarcely been tapped.

The insurance industry also has at its dis¬
posal comprehensive worldwide loss experi¬
ence which it uses not only in calculating pre¬
miums and in classifying hazard areas, known
as rating zones, but also in tracing relationships
between event intensity and loss intensity and
estimating loss potentials from realistic disas¬
ter scenarios. In these and other areas of disas¬
ter preparedness, mitigation and relief it can
contribute a wealth of experience to worldwide
co-operation with governmental, non-gov¬
ernmental and scientific institutions, industry
and the media. In the insurance industry the
International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction has a natural partner and ally which
can help to ensure that its success endures far
beyond the present decade.
