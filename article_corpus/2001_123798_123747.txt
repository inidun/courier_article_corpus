A hard sell for teaching
In the industrialized world, teaching is a greying profession and burnout rates run high.Attracting a
new generation starts with tackling some deep-rooted grievances,
which go well beyond better pay
ike religion,a calling often sets students
on the path to teaching, but today, t h e
fervour of times past is waning, leaving
schools across the developed world
scurrying for teachers.
Countries are scouting far from home
to fill vacancies, turning the profession
into a global marketplace,with recruiting
grounds stretching from Russia to South
Africa and New Zealand. Some have
even relaxed immigration rules to attract
candidates.
Governments have also taken to
investing in television advertising
c a m p a i g n s, with such slogans as
“Everybody remembers a good teacher”
( E n g l a n d ) , “Be a teacher, be a hero”
( U. S.) or the more cryptic “ Te a c h e r.Wh a t
if the future was you?”(France).
Advertising may not suffice for
raising the beleaguered status of teachers.
Once they’ve scratched the surface, m a n y
novices put the key under the door. In the
United States, up to 50 percent of
teachers leave the profession within the
first three to five years, a trend echoed in
several other industrialized countries.A t
the present rate, the gaping hole left by an
ageing population of teachers is unlikely
to be filled naturally. In most OECD
c o u n t r i e s, the majority of primary and
secondary school teachers are above 40.
The U.S. has to renew two-thirds  of its
teaching force in the next decade. I n
Fr a n c e, also faced with a steady
retirement of staff,enrollment on t e a c h e r
training courses is down
20 percent.
Ageing aside, similar patterns prevail
in most countries, with economic growth
fuelling the “brain drain.” S c i e n t i f i c
disciplines are the hardest hit, a s
university graduates are lured to private
business by more attractive salaries. E v e n
in the public sector, the OECD has found
that other professions tend to be better
off than primary school teachers. I n
C a n a d a , the latter earn less than a
draughtsman or social worker.
Rising expectations
While front-page stories about
children being sent home or schools
switching to four-day weeks are common
because of staff shortages, the real issue,
says the OECD’s Paulo Santiago, is about
declining quality. As he underlines,
research shows that teachers are by far
the single most important influence on
student achievement. If this is true, it does
not augur well for many pupils,e s p e c i a l l y
those worst-off.

The single most important influence on learning.

In the U.S.,up to 60 percent of teach-
ers who work in poor neighbourhoods are
not certifie d .More than half the country’s
physics teachers don’t have a major or
minor degree in the subject; for math
teachers the proportion is 33 percent.
In country after country, a paradox is in
the making.On the one hand,standards are
being raised and new curricula introduced
in the name of the knowledge economy.
“ Things that you used to see in senior high
school now appear in younger classes,
because we’re trying to cram in more and
m o r e,” says the general secretary of the
Canadian Teachers’ Federation.
On the other, teachers continue to be
faced with large classes, m o u n t i n g
expectations and poor professional
training. “We frequently have to update
our knowledge, especially in the sciences,
and this is not taken into account by
i n s t i t u t i o n s,” says a representative of the
French secondary teachers’ union
( S N E S ) . In Britain, the government
lowered national targets in math for 14-
year-olds after schools complained that
the demands were unrealistic.
Demands for a
greater say
What tends to exasperate the
profession is that these targets often
rhyme with stricter checks on teachers. I n
the UK, for example, teachers are
expected to prepare detailed lesson plans
for inspections and monitoring. “ Yo u
have to prove that you’re doing what the
government has set down,” says Je f f
Holman of the British National
Association of Head Teachers. “There is
a sense that someone is always looking
over your shoulder.”
His concern is shared by his peers in
other countries.“Leading politicians say
we should leave schools in the hands of
professionals, then they turn around the
next week and say that students need
more training in history or again in maths
because we’re lagging behind the rest of
E u r o p e,” says Alf Lindberg, of the
Swedish Teachers’ Union. “ Th e r e ’s a
palpable sense,” according to SNES’
Denis Paget, that “governments no longer
look towards teachers as people who are
c r e a t i v e, but as executors of a
programme.”
For the OECD’s Santiago,“the main
problem is that teachers don’t have
enough autonomy and decision-making
p o w e r. They don’t have much of a say
about the curriculum and teaching
m e t h o d s. For any activity, the most
important thing is motivation, and that
comes from incentives.”
I n c e n t i v e s,h o w e v e r, are an explosive
i s s u e. So far, governments have mostly
opted for “soft”ones. Sweden is offering
training for unqualified teachers. B r i t a i n
has introduced bursaries for trainee
teachers and offered to pay off their
student loans over their first ten years on
the job. In certain short-staffed subjects,
potential candidates are lured by “ g o l d e n
h e l l o s,” while affordable housing has also
been promised in the country’s
prosperous southeast.
Incentives become a much thornier
issue when sacrosanct salary structures
are touched. Teachers’ wages are
traditionally based on education level
and years of service.A r g u a b l y, the snail’s
pace of pay rises adds to some of the
p r o f e s s i o n ’s gripes. The alternative of
tying wages to student achievement and
teachers’ performance in the classroom is
political dynamite. Timid experiments
with performance pay are being carried
out in a handful of U.S. school districts,
while in Saxony (Germany) the education
minister stepped down over an attempt to
introduce this system.
For now, there are less politically risky
o p t i o n s. “Strategies are really crucial,”
says Mildred Hudson,head of Recruiting
New Te a c h e r s, a U. S. n o n - p r o f i t
o r g a n i z a t i o n . “ We ’ve known this was
going to be a problem, but we didn’t plan
p r o p e r l y.” Coaching for apprentice
t e a c h e r s, scholarship support, fie l d i n g
students at the high school level and
scouting for talent in community colleges
have all enjoyed modest success. Many in
the profession also admit that it’s high
time to “recognize that adults can go
through two, three or four careers in their
lifetime,” says Hudson “We don’t know
how to bring those adults into the
classroom and there’s definitely a pool
out there.”
Governments might have woken up
late to the crisis, but shortages are now
climbing high up on the political agenda.
Education was a bone of contention in
recent elections in Britain and the U.S.,
while in Sweden, a country heading for
the polls, a recent Gallup survey revealed
that 78 percent of those interviewed put
education ahead of health care and
unemployment as a leading concern. In
France, also gearing up for elections in
2 0 0 2 , schools have so far not been cited as
a hot campaign topic. “Public debate is
very weak,” laments Monique Vuaillat,
the former head of SNES. Then again,
the shadow of an economic slowdown
might lure some talents toward a
profession they’d once have shunned—at
least until the going gets better. ■

“There’s a palpable
sense that
governments
no longer look towards
teachers as people
who are creative,
but as programme
executors”
