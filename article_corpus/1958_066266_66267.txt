Looking like a child's toy on an earth mound, a long train of railway cars forms a wide circle as it spirals down Lake George escarpment toward
Kampala in Western Uganda. The territories of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika have embarked.on a vast project to improve railway and port facilities
to meet swiftly rising exports of copper, diamonds, sisal, coffee and cotton. The East Africa High Commission, responsible for the development
programmes in these territories has received a §24 million loan from the World Bank to finance the import of equipment and supplies for the projects.

THE UNTAMED
ZAMBEZI
STRIKES
BACK
Ever since David Livingstone came across it in 1855,
the Zambezi River has inspired visions in the minds
of engineers. Untamed since the becinnine of time,
its mighty waters surge through the heart of Central
Africa until, at one point, they are suddenly precipi¬
tated in a deafening roar that can be heard for 20 miles
into the most formidable cataract in the world the Vic¬
toria Falls. From there the Zambezi's waters are carried
away in a tortuous and turbulent course through a series
of steep gorges which form the boundary of Northern
and Southern Rhodesia.
It is in one of these gorges, at a spot called Kariba
Gorge about 300 miles downstream from Victoria Falls,
that the largest dam in Africa and one of the greatest
power schemes in the world, is being built by the Fede¬
ration of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Kariba Dam is
going up with help of an $80,000,000 loan from the World
Bank the largest it has ever made for a single project.
When completed, the Kariba arch dam will contain
1,400,000 cubic yards of concrete and will rise 420 feet
above the river bed just about as high as the U.N.
skyscraper in New York. A roadway, 1,900 feet long,
will carry four lanes of traffic on the crest of the dam.
Such is the flow of the Zambezi at Kariba Gorge that
the reservoir behind the dam will flood 2,000 square miles
of bush country, creating the biggest man-made lake in
the world, 190 miles long and up to 40 miles wide more
than four times the capacity of the Hoover Dam in Amer¬
ica, at present the world's biggest artificial lake.

A few days after this picture was taken in March 1958, the swirling flood waters of the Zambezi River broke over the wall of the coffer dam erected
in midstream for the giant Kariba Dam hydro-electric power station being built In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (photo of flooded coffer
dam is shown next page). For the Kariba Dam, one of the world's most ambitious engineering projects, the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development has made loans totalling S80 million, the World Bank's largest loan in Africa, and its largest for a single undertaking to date.
By 1960, water from this artificial lake will be released
to turn the turbines of six 100,000 kilowatt generators
with a full potentiality of nearly 4,000 million kilowatt-
hours per year. By 1972 installations are scheduled to be
completed for generating 1,200,000 kilowatts. Two under¬
ground power stations are being hewn out of the rock
on either side of_the Zambezi for the turbines. Nearly
1,000 miles of transmission lines will be laid to feed elec¬
tricity to the power-starved copper belt of Northern
Rhodesia and the mushrooming industrial ' cities of
Southern Rhodesia.
Today, when more than ever before, man is trying to
control nature, the Zambezi is a logical candidate for
development. Ever since World War II and even before
then, countless people in government and out of govern¬
ment, scientists, engineers, economists, officials and
businessmen, have been studying the Zambezi, and more
important still, studying the territories and the people
that the river is made to serve.
These territories aré the rich but sparsely populated
countries of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
Covering an enormous area of over 450,000 square miles,
the Federation came into existence five years ago and
has a status close to that of the independent members
of the British Commonwealth. Its population numbers,
little more than seven million people, of which 250,000
are Europeans.
Few people realize that the Rhodesian Federation has
the fastest growing economy of any country in the
world ! Between 1950 and 1955 the national income of
all three regions combined more than doubled itself.
Imports, worth approximately $70 million in 1946 are
now running to something like $450 million, while exports
show a correspondingly spectacular jump in value.
Northern Rhodesia contains the great copper belt of
Africa and now rivals Chile as the world's largest copper
producer. Other mineral products, such as gold, lead,
asbestos, chrome and coal, are now being exploited. In
Southern Rhodesia, in addition to crop exports (tobacco
is the nation's second export item) local manufacturing
industries have show fantastic growth in the past few
years. At Bulawayo, for instance, 300 factories were regis¬
tered in 1957, principally metalworking, machinery and
motor engineering establishments.
Mining and industry now consume 78 per cent of the
power produced in the Federation and much larger quan¬
tities are essential for their continued expansion. In
Southern Rhodesia all urban and industrial centres
depend on electric power. Since there is no gas supply,
all essential services, including water supply in the large
cities, are electrically operated, and power rationing has
been required in recent years.
Power for the copper 'miñes iñ Northern
Rhodesia comes mainly from coal found
only at the western tip of Southern Rho¬
desia. It thus has to be transported two to
five hundred miles over a single-track rail-

KARIBA, WORLD'S LARGEST
MAN-MADE LAKE
The wide waters of the mighty Zambezi will soon be harnessed to provide
power for the development of a vast territory of Central Africa. When the Ka¬
riba Dam spanning the Zambezi Is completed In 1960, some 2,000 square miles
of bush country will be flooded, creating the biggest man-made lake In the
world190 miles long and up to 40 miles wide. It will store 130 million acre-

at present the world's largest man-made lake. Photos show various stages
in the construction of the dam. (1) Cableway used for transporting equip¬

ZAMBEZI
(Continued from p. 1 1)
way to the copper belt. An expensive
alternative is burning wood or im¬
porting coal from overseas via Angola.
Because of this situation, the Gov¬
ernment of the Federation in 1953
decided to turn to hydro-electric
power. The Zambezi became a logical
candidate for power development.
Studies showed that a hydro-electric
station at Kariba Gorge would pro¬
vide enough power to meet expected
requirements of the entire Federation
until about 1970, and would relieve
the pressure on the railroads by re¬
ducing coal haulage for power sta¬
tions, now one million tons a year. It
was estimated that $225 million would
be required to start construction on
the giant Zambezi dam.
Work at Kariba began in 1956
shortly after the World Bank had
granted the Federation its $80 million
loan. But the untamed Zambezi was
apparently determined not to give in
without a good fight.
In 1957, the African rainy season
flooded to extraordinary heights,
wiping out a great part of the work
that had been done on the prelimi¬
nary coffer dams.
After the floods had subsided, the
walls of the coffer dams were doubled
in height and work proceeded on
schedule despite the damage. Then
came the rains of 1958. This time the
Zambezi outdid itself. Passing well
above the flood peak of last year, the
Zambezi unleashed 450,000 cubic feet
of water a second into the Kariba
Gorge. Desperate measures were
taken but, almost as if it were laugh¬
ing at these efforts, the great river
drove the full force of its pounding
fury against the enormous concrete
blocks of the coffer dams and against
two bridges built across the river.
The tremendous pressure cracked fis¬
sures in the base of the coffer dams,
which began to fill rapidly. Soon, too,
the swirling waters poured right over
the top of the central dam block
throwing twisted sprays of water 20
feet into the air. The road bridge
buckled in the middle, toppled into
the swirling waters in two sections,
and was swept downstream.
As a United Nations reporter, Allan
House, commented the event in a re¬
cent U.N. broadcast : "It was an in¬
credible sight. Geologists, old timers
on the African rivers, and chiefs in
the African villages that line the
Zambezi say the flood is one that
would occur only once in ten thous¬
and years.
"Almost as quickly as it had risen,
the great river dropped again, and
work was set about pumping out the
coffer dams in readiness to lay a new
dam base... The walls are being thick¬
ened and raised even higher despite
the fact that everyone agrees on the
impossibility of a greater flood next
year. Additional labour force has
already been set to work to bring the
construction of the Kariba Dam back
on schedule, and the officials of the
World Bank are confident that des¬
pite the efforts of the old Zambezi to
wash it down the drain, their $80 mil¬
lion is safe, and will fulfil its useful
purpose."
