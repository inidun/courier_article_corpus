Communication
facts and figures
rHE changes now taking place and
the likelihood offuture upheaval in
the field of communication and in¬
formation are bringing new dimensions to
thinking about communication and infor¬
mation as essential determinants of change
in the lives of societies.
The means of storing data, sounds and
images are being extended and improved
with the aid of computer memories and
video discs; processing and computation
capacities are being very considerably in¬
creased with microprocessors; transmission
capacities are being extended in space by
way ofcommunication satellites, and at the
surface of the earth or under the sea with
the use ofmicrowaves or opticalfibres; and
data collecting is acquiring new dimensions
with the help of remote-sensing techniques.
The association of computer technologies
and communication technologies is giving
rise to the establishment and interconnex¬
ion ofcomplex networks enabling informa¬
tion to be processed and transmitted instan¬
taneously, in real time.
These technologies are playing a part in
transforming societies and causing them to
move towards ever greater complexity .'
Communication and information may in
fact be regarded as the nervous system of
contemporary societies: they are essential
to their activities, particularly in economic
matters, and play an essential part in finan¬
cial transactions and banking and in the
development of trade, of land, sea and air
transport, of health or public administra¬
tion systems, and of military systems.
Communication and information in¬
dustries are in some countries acquiring
such economic importance that they are
tending to become predominant and to
take over from heavy industry and
manufacturing as the chief component of
the national product. Some people conse¬
quently consider that tomorrow's economy
will be based mainly on information, and
that information is in the process ofbecom¬
ing the key resource marked out for a
major role still more decisive than that of
raw materials and energy.
The impact ofcommunication and infor¬
mation on education is also emerging more
clearly. As we know, it is quite commonfor
children in some countries to receive infor¬
mation put out by the audio-visual media
during periods as long as, if not longer
than, the time spent in the classroom. The
school, as a means of transmitting
knowledge, thus finds itself in a context
very different from that obtaining in the
past, for it is now faced with the need to
provide a kind of "neo-literacy" instruc¬
tion by instilling the ability to select
messages, to interpret them critically and to
classify discontinuous and heterogeneous
flows of information into organized and
coherent bodies of knowledge.
In addition, the new technologies have
given rise to the production ofa great many
educational materials designed to extend
the effects of instruction. Their use and the
possible benefits resulting therefrorñ in
terms of time and manpower savings and
increased effectiveness, together with the
role of the computer as a medium and a
subject of instruction, are central themes
for reflection on the future prospects of
educational methods and programmes.
Scientific and technological development
is also influenced to a great extent by the
existence ofmore and better means ofcom¬
munication and information. This may be a
matter of research and computing capacity
and the circulation and use ofscientific and
technical information intended for
specialists and passing on the store of ac¬
quired knowledge, or ofefforts to make the
general public more aware of science and
technology and the development ofa scien¬
tific and technological culture.
Resulting from the convergence of
various interrelated and interacting
technologies, the world of communication
and information can be seen as a shifting,
complex and as it were ubiquitous entity.
This makes the very great disparities in the
different countries' situations as regards
their communication and information
capacity all the more serious. The least well
equipped countries, especially the develop¬
ing countries, are deprived of some of the
most effective means of controlling the
various aspects of the development process.
The development of communication and
information in the developing countries,
which is generally recognized to be
necessary by the international community
today, is therefore a prime prerequisite for
the advent of a world ofgreater equity and
solidarity and for the free development of
democracy within the various societies. If
they were better able to communicate and
to acquire and impart information, the
developing countries could not only make
their voices heard more effectively in inter¬
national affairs but could also make more
progress in education particularly in the
struggle against illiteracyand could
develop their scientific and technological
potential, improve their health systems,
promote rural development, and be in a
better position to deal with natural
disasters. Communication and information
can also help those countries, and indeed
all others, to consolidate national unity,
preserve their cultural identity, and make
provision for greater participation by the
public in the changes currently taking
place.
With the continuous advancement of
knowledge, information is steadily growing
in volume and variety, and all societies anx¬
ious to make progress are faced with the
need to operate systems for the storing,
processing and dissemination ofspecialized
information, including scientific and
technical information. Information systems
and services are being developed mainly in
the industrialized countries, and some of
them hold a privileged position, in some
cases a monopoly, in regard both to con¬
tent, most often derived from studies and
research carried out in those countries, and
to technical facilities for storage and
distribution.
Many countries have to overcome a
variety of technical obstacles and financial
constraints in order to gain access to infor¬
mation. The compelling requirement is for
freer and more effective access to more
relevant information. Information should
be able to flow freely, and every country
should be able to avail itself ofdata helpful
for its development. It is therefore im¬
perative, on the one hand, to ensure the
compatibility and interconnexion of infor¬
mation systems throughout the world and,
on the other, to foster the development, in
all countries and at the regional level, of in¬
frastructures, networks and data banks
which will make it possible to handle all the
information needed for scientific,
technological, economic, social or cultural
activities, and lastly to create the necessary
conditions for freer access to the informa¬
tion needed for the progress of the various
peoples.
The new communication and informa¬
tion technologies represent a huge potential
and are opening up unsuspected
possibilities for all countries, and more
especially the developing countries. Any
countries that are unable to avail
themselves amply of these technologies are
in danger of finding themselves on the
fringe in relation to the rest of the world,
and their populations in danger of being
cut off from the mainstream of political,
economic and cultural life.

The second halfof the twentieth century^,
has been marked by the expansion of the
mass media and the audience available to
them.

Press agencies are the major source of in¬
formation to newspapers and to broadcast¬
ers, particularly for foreign news. More
than a hundred countries now have their
own national news agencies.
Among the news agencies there are
five Agence France-Presse (France), As¬
sociated Press (USA), Reuters (UK), Tass
(USSR) and United Press International
(USA) which have a particularly wide in¬
ternational role due to the size and techno¬
logical strength of their systems of collect¬
ing news and distributing it in many lan¬
guages all over the world. Each has offices
in more than a hundred countries, and
employs thousands of full-time staff and
part-time correspondents. They collect
hundreds of thousands of words a day and,
domestic distribution included, transmit
millions of words. Each issues news twenty-
four hours a day to thousands of national
agencies, subscribing newspapers, radio
and television organizations in over a
hundred countries. All have regular ser¬
vices, usually daily, in Arabic, English,
French, German, Portuguese, Russian and
Spanish; some also provide their service in
other languages.
Daily Newspapers. Although circulation
has grown constantly, the worldwide total
of daily newspapers has remained fairly
static for a number of years, due to
mergers, the disappearance of small local
newspapers and competition from radio
and television.
Books. This century has seen a great and
still accelerating increase in book product¬
ion, which can be ascribed to the growth in
the absolute number of literates, advances
in education, the arrival of paperbacks,
improvements in production and distribu¬
tion techniques, and the spread of libraries
and travelling libraries even to remote
places. Between 1955 and 1975, world book
production more than doubled, taking the
number of titles -published annually, and
tripled in the number of copies printed.

Radio. Radio is the most ubiquitous of the
mass media. Latest available estimates indi¬
cate that there are well over one thousand
million radio receivers in use around the
world, i.e. approximately one for every

Television. The age of television dawned in
1936 when France and the United Kingdom
began regular transmission ofprogrammes.
By 1950, five countries had a regular TV
service and by 1955 the number was 17.
This figure had increasedfourfold by 1960.
A decade later, more than J 00 countries
were transmitting television programmes.
