THE TRUE TREASURE
OF 'TREASURE ISLAND'
nm
Considering the tale behind it, the true treasure of
Treasure Island is a map 16 inches by 10 inches
drawn by Robert Louis Stevenson and which inspired
him to write his masterpiece of adventure.
Stevenson himself has told the story of how his famous
romance came to be written. In an article which appear¬
ed in the Idler, August 1894, Stevenson recounts that he
drew a map one day
in collaboration with
his schoolboy step¬
son, Lloyd Osbour-
ne. Of it Stevenson
says that he "made
the map of an is¬
land ; it was elabor¬
ately and (I thought)
beautifully coloured;
the shape of it took
my fancy beyond ex¬
pression: it contained
harbours that pleased
me like sonnets: with
the unconsciousness
of the predestined,
I ticketed my perfor¬
mance Treasure Is¬
land."
Further on, in the
same article, Steven¬
son recounts the sad
fate of this first map,
and tells how the
present map, known
through reproduction
to thousands of his
readers, came to be
drawn: "The time
came when it was
decided to publish,
and I sent in my
manuscript and the
map along with it...
The proofs came, they
were corrected, but I
heard nothing of the
map. I wrote and
asked; was told it had
never been received,
and sat aghast. It is
one thing to draw a
map at random, set a
scale in one corner of
it at a venture, and write up a story to the measurements.
It is quite another to have to examine a whole book, make
an inventory of all the allusions contained in it, and with
a pair of compasses, painfully design a map to suit the
data. I did it, and the map was drawn again in my
father's office, with embellishments of blowing whales
and sailing ships, and my father himself brought into
service a knack he had of various writing, and elaborately

forged the signature of Captain Flint and the sailing
directions of Billy Bones."
This famous manuscript map, reproduced here, is
beautifully drawn in exact imitation of an old engraved
map of the period of the story, with an elaborate vignette
at top depicting mermen with dolphins and sea-birds, and
further embellished with sailing vessels of the 18th cent¬
ury. At a spot in the
island a notation in
red ink reads "Bulk
of Treasure Here".
At bottom is Captain
Flint's note of Treas-'
ure Island, dated
August 1, 1750, and
words "Facsimile of
Chart; latitude and
longitude struck out
by J. Hawkins".
Below this is written,
"Given by above J.F.
(lint) to Mr. W. Bones,
Maite of ye Walrus,
Savannah, this twenty
July, 1754, W. B."
Manuscript map is
now in A. Edward
Newton Collection and
is reproduced and
described in Mr. New¬
ton's This Book-Col¬
lecting Game.
Stevenson's ability
. to draw this map
came from his train¬
ing as a civil engineer
and his study of
drawing as a youth.
He has left us a
number of landscapes
drawn while living in
southern France, and
wood engravings. He
often made quick
sketches of the char¬
acters in his books
before setting about
describing them in
words. Stevenson's
inherent gift for re¬
taining the images of
the places he visited and the people he met is revealed
in the descriptive mastery of his works.
Although seriously ill all his life Stevenson lived adven¬
turously and travelled widely in Belgium, France and the
Pacific Islands. For his health's sake he eventually settled
with his family in Samoa. When he died in 1894 at the
age of 44, sixty Samoans carried his body to the top of
Mount Vaea where he now lies buried.
