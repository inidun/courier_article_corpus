During the summer of 1975,the South Bronx
was burning. New York City officials admit-
ted that they couldn’t battle all the fires, let
alone investigate their origins. Chaos reigned.One
long hot day in June, 40 fires were set in a three-
hour period.
These were not the fires of purifying rage that
ignited Watts in 1965, N e wark in 1967, or St. L o u i s
and a half dozen other U.S. cities after the assassi-
nation of Martin Luther King, Jr. These were the
fires of abandonment.
As hip-hop journalist S.H. Fe rnando notes, t h e
Bronx had been a borough of promise for African
American, Puerto Rican, Irish, Italian and Jewish
families after World War II. But as industry moved
n o rth to the suburbs during the sixties,housing va l-
ues collapsed and whites fled,leaving a population
overwhelmingly poor and of colour.
So slumlords were employing young thugs to
s y s t e m atically bu rn the devalued buildings to chase
out the poor tenants and collect millions in insur-
ance.Hip-hop, it could be said, was born in fire.
As rapper Grandmaster Flash and the Furious
Five’s “The Message” would describe it, the New
York ghettoes that fuelled hip-hop’s re-creat i ve pro-
ject were spaces of state neglect and fading liberal
d r e a m s. “Got a bum educat i o n ,” the narr at o r
r hy m e d ,“ d o u b l e - d i git inflat i o n ,c a n ’t take a train to
work there’s a strike at the stat i o n .” But these wo u l d
also be spaces of spiritual and creative renewal.
In an earlier era, say the 1920s and 30s when
jazz legends like Charles Mingus grew up, a youth
might find an extended web of peers , m e n t o rs ,
p at r o n s , bands and venues through which he or she
might master an instrument and find a vo c at i o n .
But by the late 1970s,such music education was a
luxury for most families.
Jamaican connection
The result? Play, as A f rican A m e rican author
Robin D.G. Kelley has put it, became an alternate
f o rm of work for a new generat i o n . Adapting the
Jamaican tradition of outdoor dance parties to the
grid and grit of New York, young black and Puerto
Rican entrepreneurs illegally plugged their stereo
systems into street light power supplies, and start e d
the party.
With vinyl grooves as sheet music, and a rig of
two turntables,a mixer and an amplifier as instru-
ments, Black Art began reinventing itself in 1974

and 1975.That’s when a Jamaican immigrant disc
jockey named Kool Herc started gaining a reputa-
tion in the Bronx for filling the smoky air with “the
b r e a k s ” — t h at portion of the song, often as short
as two seconds,where the singer dropped out and
let the band immerse itself in the groove.
Punching back and forth between two copies
of the same record’s breaks,then ratcheting up the
excitement by shifting to ever more intense breaks,
DJs like Herc and Afrika Bambaataa were creating
a new aesthetic, which simultaneously sat i ated and
teased the audience.
Escaping the chaos 
on the streets
On the one hand, a loop (of beats) became a
metaphor for freedom: through move m e n t ,d a n c e rs
stretched within the space sculpted by the break.A
new canon of songs—drawn from funk, d i s c o, r o c k ,
jazz,Afrobeat and reggae—launched new, athletic
forms of dancing, which would become known as
breakdancing or b-boying.Rather than being pas-
sive spectators,the audience engaged in a real dia-
logue with the disc jockey.
The New York DJs began employing MCs—
m a s t e rs of ceremony—to affirm the crow d ’s response
to proven breaks, win them over to new breaks,d i ve rt
them during bad records and generally keep spiri t s
h i g h . In time, the MCs became attractions in their
own ri g h t . Rocking memorized poems (“wri t t e n s ” )
or improvising them on the spot (“freestyles”), t h e
MC became Eve ry m a n , the representat i ve of the
audience onstage. They reacted to the MC’s flow,
laughed at his cleve rn e s s , cheered his braggadocio,
t h rilled at his tall-tale spinning, felt his bluesy pain,
riding the riddims with words (or “ r a p p i n g ” ) .
The Black A rts poets, the Black Panther messiahs
and other revo l u t i o n a ry firebrands sharpened their
words into spears to at t a c k .This new generation of
r a p p e rs let the words flow generously, in search of a
moment that might serve as a shield of protection, o r
a transcendent escape from the chaos on the streets.
Popular culture in America is one space where
the trope (expression) of working-class creativity is
still firmly lodged. American markets are good at
p r oviding poor audiences of colour easy access to
goods such as music, video and clothing. In the last
three decades, a whole class of middlemen entre-
p r e n e u rs have made fortunes by charting the rapidly
shifting terrain of black and brown ghetto chic.


Born in fire :
a hip-hop o d y s s e y
◗ Jeff Chang
F rom the Bronx to Los Angeles and beyond, a rough guide to the voice 
of a genera t i o n

By the late 70s, black and Jewish record label
owners in Harlem noted the popularity of hip-hop
and rushed to record leading crews. B a s i c a l l y, t h e s e
ow n e rs were geographically and personally close
to the music.When a novelty record by the Sugar
Hill Gang, “Rapper’s Delight” became a surprise
i n t e rn ational smash, major labels began sniffin g
around uptown for the next hit. In 1980, Ku rt i s
B l ow released rap’s first full-length album on a
major label.The stage was set for the ascendance of
hip-hop culture into the most powerful intern a-
tional youth culture of the late twentieth century.
Until the late 80s, the undisputed centre of this
culture was New Yo r k . The visual signifie rs we r e
provided by the vibrant graffiti movement, whose
young renegade artists braved electri fied razor-wire
fences and armed Metropolitan Transit Authority
guards to apply bright spraypaint hieroglyphics
onto the city’s subways. Every time a train pulled
into a station,hip-hop was in respectable society’s
face,like a middle-finger.
Remember the backdrop to the 1980s: the Rea-
gan administration was launching an attack on the
“ we l fare stat e ” , wiping out subsidies for the poor,
a l l owing housing agencies to become dens of cor-
ruption while closing down entire cat e g o ries of gov-
ernment programmes. Hip-hoppers were on the
counter-offensive. As the Furious Five warned:
“ D o n ’t push me ’cause I’m close to the edge. I’m try-
ing not to lose my head. I t ’s like a jungle sometimes,
it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.”
On the technological front, h i p - h o p p e rs racked
up one breakthrough after another.While most rock
musicians of the mid-80s were perplexed by new

sampling technology, rap producers were turning
their new toys into unrelentingly dense, r e fle x i ve
gr o ove s. T h e n , as the anti-apartheid move m e n t
crested in the U.S., groups like Boogie Down Pro-
ductions and Public Enemy extended rap’s social
realism into broader discussions of political action.
But the lofty views of revo l u t i o n a ry nat i o n a l i s m
and hardrock spiritualism veered back to the streets
in 1989.A group of barely twe n t y - s o m e t h i n g s ,w h o
not so ironically called themselves Niggas With A t t i-
t u d e , released what would become an anthem for a
g e n e r at i o n , Gangsta Gangsta.Within six weeks of its
r e l e a s e , the album went “ g o l d ” , selling over 500,000
c o p i e s. Hip-hop shot itself into the heart of wo r l d
culture.
The albu m , S t raight Outta Compton, d e c e n t e r e d
hip-hop from New York to Los A n g e l e s. By the mid-
dle of the Reagan administrat i o n , Compton wa s
one of a gr owing number of inner-city nexuses
where deindustrialization,devolution,the cocaine
t r a d e , gang structures and ri va l ri e s ,a rms profit e e r-
ing and police brutality combined to destabilize
poor communities. Chaos was settling in for a long
stay and gangsta rap would be the soundtrack. By
c o n flating myth and place, the narr at i ves could take
root in every ’hood (neighbourhood). From Port-
land to Pa ri s , e ve ry ’hood could be Compton;
everyone had a story to tell, a cop to fight, a rebel-
lion to launch.

p h o b i c, m i s o g y n i s t i c.
Gangsta rap drew new lines in the culture wa rs.
As the music crossed over to whiter,more affluent
c o m m u n i t i e s , gangsta rap inflamed cultural con-
s e rvat i ves like Bob Dole and neoliberals like 
C. Delores Tucker into demanding new corporate
and state repression. Gangsta rap was even show i n g
up in presidential debates.
P r o gr e s s i ves often speculate that gangsta rap
was foisted on a young public by reactionary record
labels. But to a great extent, the rise of these pop-
cultural trends was completely unplanned.Well into
the 1990s, major recording labels had no idea what
kind of hip-hop would sell. Unlike rock music,
which had long before matured into a stable and
culturally stale economy, hip-hop was like a wild
child whose every gesture and motion was a com-
plete surprise.
In the wake of the Los Angeles riots after the
brutal police beating of motorist Rodney King in
1 9 9 1 , gangsta rap and hip-hop marched towa r d
their gr e atest commercial success. D r. D r e ’s albu m
The Chronic topically moved gangsta rap away from
ghetto commentary to druggy hedonism, a n d ,w i t h
its polished chrome sound,onto mainstream radio
playlists. As cast by MTV and the expanding hip-
hop press, a rtists such as the late Tupac Shakur,
the son of a Black Panther revo l u t i o n a ry, m a d e
rebellion less a battle in the culture wars,and ever
more a mere marker of youth style.
The shrinking music industry also transform e d
the hip-hop scene. Between the early to mid-90s,
s e veral of the independent record label ow n e rs who
had been instrumental in launching the music sold
their companies to major labels,which also began
c o n s o l i d ating and reducing the size of their rosters.
As a result, grassroots acts no longer went from the
streets to the top of the charts. Management firms
guaranteed polished stars and funded the fa rm
teams that would take those stars’ places in turn.
The new hip-hop sound, c risply digitized and
radio-ready, became mainstream pop.
With the massive major label distribution jug-
g e rnauts behind them, it became routine for the
biggest hip-hop acts to debut with gold (half-mil-
lion) or more sales. A half-dozen magazines were
launched to take advantage of the new wealth of
advertising dollars. Hollywood’s big money came
c a l l i n g, making multimedia stars of rappers LL
Cool J and Ice Cube. Commercial tie-ins with
products such as Sprite or the Gap clothing prolif-
e r ated for second-level art i s t s. Producer Russell
Simmons began calling the hip-hop generation “ t h e
biggest brand-building generation the world has
ever seen”.The audience had matured into a mar-
ketable demographic.
Rebellion or
capitulation?
As U. S . author Don DeLillo has wri t t e n ,“ C a p-
ital burns off the nuance in a culture.”To be sure,
hip-hop has transformed popular culture across the
world. In Kenya, youngsters wear Adidas baseball
c a p s , Nike shoes and stage rowdy rap concerts that
look like ve rsions of Bambaat a a ’s romps in the
Bronx of yo r e . I t ’s unclear whether such perfor-
mances reflect a hybrid youth rebellion or capitu-
lation to global capitalism.
Yet somewhere within the culture lies the key
to understanding an entire generat i o n . This cul-
ture forged in fire still keeps its hand near the
m at c h . Rap rewards those who “ r e p r e s e n t ” i t s
a u d i e n c e s ’ r e a l i t i e s. If this often appears as cav i n g
in to baser impulses, h i p - h o p ’s defense is that it
speaks to young people as they are and where they
a r e .
And yet a growing movement believes that the
culture is liberat i n g . In cities across the wo r l d ,
youths use hip-hop to organise the struggles against
racism, police brutality, and the prison-industrial
c o m p l e x . For them, the culture and the politics are
inseparable—they are all part of a cohesive world-
view.Therein finally lies the story:hip-hip, born of
the destru c t i ve fires of the 1960s and 70s, has rekin-
dled creative flames of hope in a new generation.
The cleansing fires are still to come. ■
