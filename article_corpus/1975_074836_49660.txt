From a young
Burmese sirl's notebook
by Khin Myo Than
THE Burmese girl pays great
attention to dress and likes to
wear her traditional costume. She is
very feminine and may appear like a
fragile flower. Her status has not
changed over the centuries. Is she
dominated by men or subdued by so¬
cial tradition, like women in many
other countries were and are still? No,
and she never has been.
As a little girl, she may play the
same games as her young brother.
Should a little boy, on the other hand,

make garlands of flowers ? This is not
considered becoming. At the age of
5 or 6, she starts her schooling. Bur¬
mese people accord an important
place to education and culture. They
respect and honour learned people
and teachers, as they do their parents
and elders. The word "daw", equiva¬
lent to Madam, and used in addressing
a married woman, is also used for
young women holding a university de¬
gree or exercising a profession.
Before the British conquest (bet¬
ween 1824 and 1826), education was
ensured by the Buddhist monks, who
for ethical reasons could only take
care of boys. The girl's education was
at home, in the family, but was not
neglected. The British were very asto¬
nished at the high literacy level in
Burma of girls as well as boys. A Bri¬
tish report of 1826 notes that women
"for the most part know how to read
and write", and, "entered with the
greatest warmth into the news and
politics of the day."
During the colonial period the Bri¬
tish introduced the lay vernacular and
the anglo-vernacular schools for the
local people. Burmese parents readily
sent their little girls to these schools.
Whereas, in pre-colonial Burma, par¬
ents kept money to buy jewels for
their daughters, they soon adapted
themselves to the notion that learning
was a gem that no one could steal.
Nowadays, there is a uniform educa¬
tional system for boys and girls.
The end of childhood for the girls is
marked by "nadwin", a sort of "pas¬
sage rite" (1): on reaching the age of
12 or 13, the girl goes through this co¬
lourful ceremony during which her ear-
lobes are pierced. Henceforth, she is
considered to have reached the "years
or discretion". She wears earrings
and assumes greater responsibility in
the family. Soon she will think of
getting married.
For a Westerner, Burmese society
(1) At about the same age, the age of the Catholics
First Communion, little Buddhist boys too go through
an initiation ceremony called shin-byu. At this ceremony,
their heads are shaved and they wear the yellow robe
of renunciation to worldly things as do Buddhist
monks. They leave their families, for a certain period
of time, to live the life of monks in a monastery. Here
they are taught Buddhist ethics, among other things.

Marriage in Burma is contracted
without any civil or religious
ceremony. A young couple
(photo left) wearing their most
beautiful and colourful clothes are
married according to a simple
traditional ritual at the bride's
house in the presence of relatives
and friends. Below right, Burmese
women board an Irrawaddy river

prepared at home by their husbands.
may seem prudish. Young girls and
boys are not seen kissing and hugging
in the streets, and even married cou¬
ples do not walk arm in arm. Flirtation
and dating do not exist. It is only in
a very discreet and chaste manner
that the Burmese make known their
sentiments and feelings. However, this
does not mean that a Burmese girl
lowers her eyes in front of a man, nor
does she stay at home behind doors.
Young girls and boys have many
occasions to meet: at school or uni¬
versity, but also at pwés (open-air
shows that last for three whole
nights), at festivals and even at the
pagoda where one may talk freely,
unlike in Christian churches.
What I may call "reserve" in the
relationship between young people is
equally shared by boys and girls.
Young men, having at an earlier age
gone through the monastery life,
have learnt from the monks to be¬
come detached from worldly things.
They are self-disciplined and respec-
ful towards others. Girls seem more
worldly: they like being coquettish and
elegant and love to wear jewellery.
However, from childhood their mo¬
thers inculcate in their little girls the
forms of social etiquette and among
others, how to behave with men. Thus
girls and boys do not look for casual
affairs but true love and marriage.
With such conceptions, a boy is not
surprised should a girl he "courts"
(by paying her compliments, compos¬
ing little poems, or giving small pre¬
sents) ask him to marry her, if such is
his intention. But when a girl asks
such a question she is already sure
of the answer.
Though parents may wish their
daughter to marry a certain young
man of their choice, the final decision
lies with the girl. Burmese traditional
law recognizes the priority of the sen¬
timents of the couple over the will of
the parents. If parents are opposed
to a marriage, the lovers may elope
to live together.
The very fact of living and eating
together constitutes the bonds of mar¬
riage. As Burmese parents do not
wish to have to put up with the prob¬
lems following marriage by elope¬
ment, they willingly obey the recom¬
mendations contained in the Bur¬
mese law books, the Dhammathats,
which say: "If a daughter desires to
marry a man, her parents should per
mit her to do so, in order to prevent
disgrace."
Wedded, with or without their par¬
ents' consent, the newly married cou¬
ple is not absorbed into the organi¬
zation of the family of either side, but
on the contrary, marriage emancipates
both partners. Both man and wife
leave their respective family and live
apart in their own house. The Bur¬
mese word for marriage, "ein-daung-
pyu", means "set up house."
In Burma, contrary to many other
cultures, procreation is not the main
aim of marriage. Since nothing is
permanent on this earth the Buddhist
family does not trouble itself with its
perpetuation. A Burman marries a
woman to have a life-long companion
and helpmate with whom he shares
his joys and sorrows and his fortune.
One does not have to strive to make
the family name survive since there
are no family names.
A name is something personal. After
marriage the woman keeps her name
without either substituting it by or
adjoining it to that of her husband.
Children have names which have no¬
thing in common with those of their
parents. Whereas in a Western so¬
ciety the mother-to-be and her hus¬
band go through the names of saints
in the calendar and have to choose
the first name (or Christian name) of
the child, in Burma a name is given
much later. The parents observe the
nature and character of the child and
give him or her a name in keeping
with such considerations, as well as
with astrological data (the time and
day of birth).
The name is a whole (not composed
of name and surname) and usually it
has a meaning. The names are gen¬
erally flattering but not always. It may
happen that a little girl is called, for
instance, Wet Ma (little piggy). On
growing up, if she is not happy or
satisfied with such a name, or any
other which may be flattering but
which she feels is not suited to her
character, she can change it (as can
boys) so that it fits her personality

better. In the towns, a simple an¬
nouncement in a newspaper as to the
change of name is enough.
As marriage has no metaphysical
significance, there is no need to say
"yes" before a priest or a mayor. The
ceremony is performed in the pre¬
sence of the families and friends who
are all witnesses to the marriage.
Wearing their most beautiful and
colourful clothes, they all meet in the
house of the bride.
The ceremony is very simple the
couple superpose their right hands on
a cushion and they may eat out of the
same silver bowl and the marriage is
pronounced. After marriage, they do
not wear wedding rings as in western
societies and there is no outward sign
as to whether one is married or not.
The union is symbolized by the silver
bowl which the couple keep precious¬
ly in their home.
The law relating to marriage has
been for centuries in advance of that
in most Western countries. The rights
and responsibilities of both partners
are equal and reciprocal. As long as
marriage subsists, all property con¬
stitutes an indivisible whole. There is
no marriage contract and the system
of a joint estate is the only existing
one. Marriage is maintained by the
mutual accord of husband and wife.
In Burma, divorce may be obtained
by mutual consent, unlike most coun¬
tries where this is still impossible and
one partner to the marriage has to
prove a fault committed by the other.
In case of divorce by mutual consent,
each spouse takes what belonged to
him before the marriage. Acquisitions
made during the marriage are consi¬
dered as common property which is
divided equally between the spouses.
Though divorce is easy to obtain, it is
very rare.
The equalitarian ideas of Burmese
Buddhist customary laws are so strong
in the country that they also influence
non-Buddhists. An example is the
Burma Muslim Dissolution of Marriage
Act. This measure, which was appro¬
ved by the Burma Muslim Congress
without undue difficulty, became law
in March 1953. It gave Burmese Mus¬
lim women rights equal to those
of Buddhists: equal opportunity to di¬
vorce their husbands, and a right to
the return of their marriage portion
on dissolution of the marriage.
This measure occasioned loud pro¬
tests in some other Muslim countries
where the wife had no redress against
the arbitrary decision of a husband to
carry through a divorce, with or with¬
out cause. The Burmese Muslim wo¬
man has now the same status as her
Buddhist sister and like her goes forth
unveiled.
Marriage and, more generally, rela¬
tions between men and women are
based on equalitarian terms. In France,
for instance, a man "gallantly" gives
up his seat to a woman and lets
her pass before him. Burmese women
do not receive such attention from
their menfolk. As a matter of fact,
in Burma the rules of precedence are
based on age and not on sex. Bur¬
mese people are very respectful to
their elders. Thus, a woman gives
precedence to a man older than her¬
self.
On the other hand, French gallantry
does not seem to be found in family
life. At home after work, a French¬
man seems more preoccupied in get¬
ting into his slippers, watching televi¬
sion or reading his newspapers than
helping his wife with the household
chores. He finds it natural that his
wife, who has also worked the whole
day, maybe in a factory or an office,
should now do "overtime" on so-
called "female duties": looking after
the children, cooking, serving at table
and washing up, etc.
Though Burmese men, in the eyes
of Westerners, may not appear gallant
in public, they do not hesitate to share
in the family tasks. A Burman is not
ashamed nor is he considered "effemi¬
nate" when he does the cooking or
wasrjes the dishes. It is not un¬
common to see a Burman holding his
baby in his arms and walking up and
down a room humming a lullaby before
putting the baby to bed, while his
wife may well be reading a newspaper.
Even though the Burman finds it na¬
tural to do some of the housework, it
is nevertheless the woman who has
the responsibility of looking after the
home. Generally, she is in charge of
the family budget. Traditionally, trade
too has long been in the hands of
women.
In the markets, smoking their big
cheroots (Burmese cigars) or chewing
betel nut, women offer their wares or,
from an eating stall, sell dishes which
were probably prepared by their hus¬
bands while they themselves were
getting dressed up to go to market.
Young women often run little shops,
and thus have many opportunities of
meeting young men and maybe their
future husband... In any case,
married or not, Burmese women are
very sociable and are reputed for
their keen business sense.
Thus, traditionally, men and women
have worked in a complementary way.
Nowadays, industrialization has fur¬
nished new types of work to which
women have quickly adapted them¬
selves. Alongside men, women have
taken the road leading to workshops,
factories and offices. They have

Letters to the Editor
ESKIMOS AND THE RIGHT
TO SELF-DETERMINATION
Sir,
I greatly admired your issue "The
Eskimos, a People that Refuses to
Disappear" (January 1975). It showed
us the Eskimos with their traditional
customs and culture, but above all the
confrontation that exists between this
age-old civilization and the modern
world.
The open letter from Chief Dan
George was a poignant reminder of
this situation. Whenever a people be¬
comes subject to outside domination,
it begins, little by little, to disintegrate.
That is why self-determination must be
a universal rule applying to all peoples.
Unfortunately, far too many have been
denied it, and your issue is a salutary
reminder that we should pay far more
attention to this crucial problem of our
time.
I hope you will find space to deal
more fully with the subject in future
issues. You deserve the highest praise
for the quality of your articles and their
presentation.

SYMBOL OF PEACE
AND BLISS
Sir,
The unusual beauty of the bronze
Buddha shown in colour on the cover
of your December 1974 Issue ("The
Heritage of Nepal") has captured for
me the idea of perfect peace and eternal
bliss. I have framed it and keep it before
me for inspiration.
I am glad to take this opportunity to
say how much I enjoy and appreciate
your magazine, which I have subscribed
to since its beginning, for the light it
throws on the world past and present.
I wonder if it would be possible for
you to print the enclosed Great Invo¬
cation, a world prayer. It is issued by
the Lucis Trust, 235 Finchley Road,

Let light stream forth into

Let Light descend on Earth.
From the point of Love

May Christ return to Earth.
From the centre where the

The purpose which the

From the centre which we

Let the Plan of Love and

NOT A BURDEN ON SOCIETY
Sir,
In the discussion of the problem of
population growth and providing people
with all of life's essentials, especially
food, Julian L. Simon in the May 1974
issue of the " Unesco Courier " indicated
that " babies consume but do not
produce " and that they do not affect the
gross national product "for 20 years
or so ", and therefore many persons
fear that if there are more people now
" there will be less resources left for
people in the future. "
On the other hand, your October
1973 issue justly condemned the fact
that at present 40 million of the world's
children under 14 years of age are
workers.
Thus, in one case, children produce
nothing (and only consume), while in
the other, they only work, and do so
to the detriment of their health and
their physical and mental development.
I would like to point out a solution
that avoids both extremes, one that has
been proposed by two outstanding
educators (Robert Owen in the U.K. in
the 19th century, and Anton Makarenko
in the U.S.S.R. in the 1920s and 30s)
and confirmed in practice and experi¬
ments. It consists of combining work
with study and training, beginning at
about nine years of age.
The opportunity for this has been
created by machine production, which,
unlike manual labour, does not require
great physical strength. Machine pro¬
duction actually created the need for
combining work and study because it
is based on the application of natural
scientific knowledge, which people master
most successfully when they work in
large factories and apply scientific and
theoretical knowledge in practice.
In A.S. Makarenko's experiment,
500 children from the ages of nine to
18 supported themselves, the school
and the factory entirely by their own
labour, and spent 40,000 roubles a
year on visits to the theatre, 200,000
roubles for trips and excursions for the
whole collectivity, besides giving the
state a net profit of 5 million roubles a
year. In other words, each child pro¬
duced 833 roubles of profit a month (at
the exchange-value of the rouble during
the first half of the 1930s).
The children worked four hours a day,
and all received a secondary education.
Not only did they learn a trade, but
even more important, former waifs and
strays became worthy members of
society.
Combining work in machine pro¬
duction with study has a positive effect
on the training of personnel, on the
growth of labour productivity and the
development of industry and technology,
and it is beneficial to the health and
physical development of children and
adolescents, since their work time is
limited (from one to three hours,
depending on their age), and they are
not employed in harmful fields or on
night work.
The main thing Is that their work is
tied in with their training and develop¬
ment. At the same time, the problem
of eliminating juvenile delinquency is
fundamentally resolved.
When society solves the problem of
combining work and study, children and
adolescents will play an entirely differ¬
ent role in population growth. Would it
not be worthwhile to consider this
important factor in discussing demo¬
graphic questions?

become teachers, doctors, engineers,
lawyers, judges and even parachutists
in the army. Burmese women para¬
chutists are said to be the best in
South East Asia. Inversely, men may
be typists or stenographers. In Burma
there are no small ads listing
"women's jobs".
Equalitarian ideas in Burma have
given women access to work at all
levels. The country has no institution
of higher learning like the French
"Ecole Polytechnique", which till
recently was not open to women.
Burmese society readily accepts the
fact that women occupy high-ranking
posts in different spheres of life, even
certain posts that were only occupied
by men during the colonial period.
The evolution of society has enabled
women to play a new role in the
community compared with the time
when their responsibility was usually
at the level of the family (as traders
and heads of small businesses, etc.).
Whereas in France, for instance,
some women are often more interes¬
ted in reading "women's, magazines"
than in following politics, in Burma,
there are no "fashion magazines", and
since the times when they could be
queens or myothugyis (hereditary heads
of a group of villages), Burmese wom¬
en have always been interested in
political affairs. Since independence,
women have been deputies and minis¬
ters, and women flock eagerly to the
polling booths. It is estimated that 80
per cent of Burma's women voted in
the 1960 elections.
Under such conditions, it is not sur¬
prising that Burma has no Women's
Liberation Movement. Burmese women
have nothing to fight for in a society
that has always been called a "society
of equals", in every sense of the term.
