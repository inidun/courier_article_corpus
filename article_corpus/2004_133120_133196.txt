Among the cashew, 
neem and 
teak trees, several people 
gather together on a Sunday 
morning in front of a dozen 
computers to follow the 
instructions of the teacher, 
Waïdou Kare. We are at the 
Community Multimedia 
Centre (CMC) in Banikoara, 
700 kilometres from Cotonou 
(Benin).
Created at the initiative 
of UNESCO, the Banikoara 
CMC combines a local radio 
station, Radio Bani Gans, 
with a community telecentre, 
fully equipped with 
computers connected to the 
internet, printers, telephones 
and photocopying machines. 
It is the only computer-
training centre in the region. 
This is where students, 
municipal civil servants 
and staff from the wildlife 
resource centre, members of 
the cotton growers’ union 
or NGO activists, among 
others, learn how to surf the

programmes like Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint and Photoshop. 
Using the computers costs the 
equivalent of 0.37 euros an 
hour.
The staff of Banikoara’s 
rural radio, founded in 1994 
with the support of the 
Agence intergovernmental 
de la francophonie, realized 
that in an interconnected 
scientific world, those who 
stayed on the sidelines 
risked being entirely 
excluded. This is why they 
opened the telecentre in 
February 2002, to hook 
up to the global electronic 
networks. The centre 
went on to set up its own 
website (http://pp.isfp.ch/
oafrique/benin/banikoara/) 
and organize some “radio-
browsing” sessions. When 
a programme about AIDS 
was on the air, for instance, 
a doctor was invited to the 
studio. While a journalist 
was presenting the show, he 
was looking on the internet 
to answer questions from 
listeners. This opening to the 
world does not, of course, 
replace local information. 
Recently, a news broadcast 
about the collapse of the 
bridge over the Alibori, a 
tributary of the Niger, saved 
many farm workers from 
wasting hours of travel time 
to get to an unusable bridge.

The internet connection can 
also serve to track the market 
price of cotton, points out Bio 
Sayo, former student who is 
now a farmer. “We learned 
that in Côte d’Ivoire, farmers 
had demanded and obtained 
a better price for cotton. 
Their leaders had been able 
to get information about the 
fluctuations of crop prices. We 
can be as vigilant and have 
the same attitude here.”
The CMC has enabled the 
elderly Issa, who has spent 
his entire life in Banikoara, 
to make a voyage into the 
past. From a cupboard, he 
pulls out an old briefcase 
in which he stores a whole 
collection of archives.  He 
takes out yellowed and faded 
photographs from the 1950s, 
and a dozen of death notices 
for friends and relatives who 
passed away over recent 
decades. Thanks to the 
machines at the centre, the 
documents were copied and 
“rejuvenated” and are now 
saved from the ravages of 
time. 
Sometimes the telephone 
doesn’t work, and “our area 
is cut off from the rest of the 
world for several days at a 
time,” explains the Mayor of 
Banikoara, Sabidar Daniel 
Sabi. But the CMC’s problems 
are those of the community, 
caused by isolation and 
the deficiency of basic 
infrastructure.
