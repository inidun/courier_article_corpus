W hat is the common thread running
through the U N E S C O Wo r l d
Heritage sites featured in this issue,
which have inspired a constellation
of writers and artists fascinated by
their unique and irreplaceable nature? The sites
may not be stars on the tourist circuit,nor are they
formally connected with each other, but they are
telling examples of some recent changes in our
attitudes towards heritage.
One is the steadily vanishing division between
cultural and natural heritage.The other is a growing
awareness of the value of intangible heritage,w h i c h
is being undermined and too often brushed aside by
the unstinting advance of globalization.
The World Heritage Convention,adopted by the
U N E S C O General Conference in 1972, fashioned a
v i t a l ,ground-breaking idea into an international legal
s t a t u t e. But it defined humanity’s heritage very
conservatively under two headings: the cultural and
the natural. This marked the culmination of a long
tradition and of a more recent intellectual effort to
match the splendours of art with the wonders of
n a t u r e.
H u m a n i t y ’s admiration for its own creations
was displayed as far back as the second century
B.C. in the famous list of the seven wonders of the
world—a world narrowly confined to the eastern
Mediterranean.
Tides, phoenixes and volcanoes:
proof of divine power in nature
Few people are aware that the wonders of nature
were in fact listed well before the modern era and
the birth of environmental awareness.A 12t h- c e n t u r y
Latin manuscript held in the French National
L i b r a r y, for instance,contrasts the seven destructible
man-made wonders with seven wonders of nature
which,the author says, are proof of divine power.
On the list are tides,plant germination, the phoenix
(the mythical bird that rises from its own ashes), a
volcano (Mount Etna in Sicily), a hot spring near
Grenoble (Fr a n c e ) , as well as the sun and the moon.
These were wonders unaffected by age or accident,t h e
author maintains, and their demise could only come
with the end of the world, whereas the man-made
wonders were destined to disappear well before then.
The 1972 Convention reflects this dual European
t r a d i t i o n . It was not the product of a debate among
p h i l o s o p h e r s, historians and sociologists about the
concept of heritage, but simply the convergence of
two schools of thought. One came directly from the
1931 League of Nations conference in A t h e n s, a n d
concerned preserving cultural heritage as defin e d
in terms of classical notions of a “ m a s t e r p i e c e ” o r
“wonder of the world.” The other stemmed from
the first international conference on protecting
n a t u r e, in Bern in 1913, which was followed up by the
Brunnen conference in 1947 and the foundation the
following year of the World Conservation Union,
whose aim was to pass on to future generations
“ u n s p o i l e d ” natural sites untouched by humans.
Vineyards and rice terraces
find their way onto the List
This division between cultural treasures (thought
of as monuments created by human beings) and
natural ones (which owed nothing to human
involvement) long dominated the application of
the 1972 Convention.In 1994,nearly half the sites
on the World Heritage List were cultural ones within
E u r o p e.Nothing could have been further removed
from the spirit of the Convention.
When in June 1994 the World Heritage
Committee adopted the recommendations of
experts who had looked into how representative the
List was, it absorbed the very different conception
of culture espoused by anthropologists and
e t h n o l o g i s t s, one that encompasses a complex
mixture of social organizations,ways of life, b e l i e f s,
know-how and expressions of past and present
cultures.
The accession to the List of cultural landscapes,
such as the rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras
and Fr a n c e ’s Saint-Emilion vineyards, is one of the

The past is not just made 
of stone
The world’s heritage is about more than monuments and natural
wonders—the intangible ideas and beliefs 
that make up our collective memory also have their rightful place

positive outcomes of the 1994 change in guidelines.
A few years earlier, even though public interest in
historical gardens (such as those of Shalimar, i n
L a h o r e, Pakistan) was fully recognized, s t e r i l e
debates would probably have prevented them
gaining a place on the List.
The same goes for industrial heritage. Before
they began being put “ o p e n l y ”on the List, i n d u s t r i a l
sites were admitted in disguise: the salt mines at
Wi e l i c z k a , in Po l a n d , and the royal salt works in the
French town of Arc-et-Senans, for example, were
accepted in 1978 and 1988 on the basis of their
architectural merit. M e a n w h i l e, the prestige of
monuments declined as interest grew in roads,
railway networks, rivers and canals—all of them
long neglected by the List,perhaps because of legal
problems involved in preserving them.
Moving away from classical
definitions of a masterpiece
Such choices reflect a significant change in our
concept of heritage. By finally questioning the idea
inherited from ancient times and firmly rooted in
European culture of what a masterpiece is, t h e
World Heritage Committee opened the way to a
more balanced picture of humanity’s heritage. A
shared and indivisible heritage, where the
interaction of people and nature is fully recognized,
is gradually winning converts from the incomplete
vision of heritage that the 1972 Convention
perpetuated despite its best intentions.
No longer is the sacred Maori mountain in New
Z e a l a n d ’s Tongariro National Park seen as very
different from Mount A t h o s, in Greece,even though
the forests and volcanic craters of the first are
monuments steeped in sacred meaning while the
second houses the world’s largest collection of
Byzantine art.
Legends, beliefs and traditions:
safeguards to our collective memory
So intangible heritage—the amorphous body
of beliefs, l e g e n d s,written and oral traditions along
with forms of behaviour that make up our
diversity—has made a vigorous comeback onto the
World Heritage List. The 1972 Convention made
only passing mention of intangible heritage and
tied it to the existence of material evidence.But after
long neglect it now seems that intangible heritage is
the key safeguard to humanity’s collective memory,
precisely because of its very vulnerability.
What would happen to Marrakesh—whose city
w a l l s, mosques and palaces are preserved like
museum pieces—if the Jemâa-el-Fna Square was no
longer a vibrant and colourful meeting place of
c u l t u r e s, filled with music and hubbub and the
aromas of several worlds that we are lucky to know?
What would the Sri Lankan city of Kandy be like
without its annual pilgrimage that draws thousands
of the faithful to venerate the remarkable relic that
is the Buddha’s tooth? And what would become of
the World Heritage site of Sukur, in Nigeria,if the
highly structured society living there suddenly lost
all its centuries-old traditions? ■
