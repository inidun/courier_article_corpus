to be connected, volunteers building the
new hospital at Gusau have to make
do with a tiny daily ration (far left). Left,

work. Right, Sunday at Gusau. Building
work has stopped for the day, but the camp

THE HOSPITAL THAT JACK & JILL BUILT
Gusau in northern Nigeria to¬
day has the medical centre it
always lacked. This hospital
has been built thanks to an
initiative taken by the medical
officer of the region. Dr. Dun¬
can. Needing help with the
actual construction. Dr. Dun¬
can called for young volunteers
to come from Great Britain.
Soon, fifteen young people,
boys and girls, arrived at
Gusau and set to work. Under
his directions they spent their
entire holidays building the
centre. The long journey of
these volunteers was paid
by contributions from several
organizations including the Bri¬
tish Red Cross and the Oxford
Committee for Famine Relief.

Right and below, volunteer
workers put the last roof
sections into place on one
of the Gusau hospital build¬
ings. Working on a hot tin
roof under the Nigerian sun
was only one arduous job
they did. On leaving
Gusau the young people
from Great Britain had the
satisfaction of knowing
that the hospital would
soon be caring for sick peo¬
ple from many miles around.
