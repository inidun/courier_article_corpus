For thousands of Londoners , the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew are best known as a favourite
picnic spot on the edge of the city, famous for
their picturesque Palm House and Chinese pagoda,
their unri valled collection of plants and their exten-
sive, highly manicured lawns.
The novelty of the gardens, when they were esta-
blished in the 18th century, was the way in which
they combined the function of cultivating a wide

va riety of plants with an aesthetically pleasing land-
s c a p e , a sharp contrast to the formality of the plant
collections that preceded them.
This remains their charm today.V i s i t o rs can
wander through a selection of carefully selected and
individually labelled trees, and shrubs and flowe-
ring plants from all over the wo r l d .These range from
m a s s i ve rhododendendron bushes from China, t r o-
pical palms grown in a spectacular Victorian glass-
house,to the smallest alpine flowers in a specially-
built rock garden.
Kew played an influential role at the heart of the
B ritish Empire in the 19th century, when it acted
as a central clearing house for trees and other plants
d i s c overed in one part of the empire that could be
p r o d u c t i ve l y, and often profit a b l y, gr own in ano-
t h e r. By the end of the 19th century, Kew was recei-
ving over 2,500 packets of seeds a year from around
the wo r l d , and exporting more than 3,500. O n e
c u r ator wrote that as a result of Kew’s 19th-century
activities the world had been “pretty well ransac-
ked.”
Biopiracy
in an imperial light
It was as a result of Kew’s effort s , for example, t h at
rubber plants from South A m e rica were transferr e d
to highly productive environments in Southeast A s i a .
Less controve rs i a l l y, Kew officials also arranged for
the transfer of cinchona, source of the anti-malari a l
d rug quinine, from its nat i ve Andes to malari a - ri d d e n
areas of A s i a .“In the mid-19th century such activities
r e flected the then global superp ower encouraging the
use of plant resources,” s ays Kew’s director, Pe t e r
C r a n e .“ To d ay they would be seen as pure biopiracy.”
Although Kew’s imperial role ended with the
collapse of the empire early in the 20th century, it conti-
nued to play a major role as a research institution, p r e-
s e rving and cataloguing plants from across the wo r l d .
But it was only in the final decades of the cen-
t u ry that concern for the preservation of biodive r-
sity placed Kew back at the centre of the political
stage as one of the focal points of global ex situ e f f o rt s
to preserve the planet’s biodiversity.
In an ideal wo r l d , all living organisms would be pre-
s e rved in their natural habitat—a strategy known as i n
s i t u c o n s e rvat i o n .But a va riety of fa c t o rs ,from the needs
of researchers for easy access to the fact that many plants
and animals are threatened with extinction in the wild,

h ave led to the gr owth of ex situ s t r at e gi e s.
Perhaps the clearest evidence of Kew’s new role
in supporting global conservation efforts is the Mil-
lennium Seed Bank currently under constru c t i o n
at its outstation atWakehurst Place,a 200-hectare
e s t ate in West Sussex.When completed later this
year,it will be the largest in the world dedicated to
c o n s e rving the seeds of world plants. Its long-term
aim is to collect and conserve 10 per cent of the
wo r l d ’s seed-bearing flora (about 24,000 species)
mainly from arid drylands by the year 2010.
The bank will make seeds available both for
research purposes and for reintroduction into the wild.
In Bri t a i n , seeds of the starfru i t , a small white flowe r
t h at has almost died out were collected and stored at
Wa k e h u rst and samples sent to Kew for DNA fin g e r-
p ri n t i n g .Plants gr own successfully from the seeds are
n ow being reintroduced in their natural habitat .
Roger Smith, head of Kew’s seed conservat i o n
d e p a rt m e n t ,s ays that one of the goals of the seed
bank initiat i ve is to achieve Bri t a i n ’s conservat i o n
o b l i g ations as signat o ries to the 1992 Convention on
B i o l o gical Dive rsity (CBD) “in a way that reduces
c o u n t ri e s ’l e a rning curve invo l ved in setting up their
own collections and allows them to have the insu-
rance policy of seed collections under our control.”
The CBD requires anyone taking plant samples
out of a country to enter a formal agreement spe-
cifying the conditions under which this is being
d o n e , and in particular the compensation that a
c o u n t ry can expect to receive if a commercial appli-
c ation is eventually developed from the plant.
Informed consent
This compensation could, for example, take the
f o rm of an agreed share of the royalties resulting
from the licensing of a patent based on the plant’s
genetic propert i e s.A hypothetical case might be that
of a plant discovered in the Amazon shown to have
p owerful anti-cancer propert i e s. Pa rticularly in light
of their previous reputat i o n , Kew researchers are
keen to be seen to meet CBD requirements.
A greements are currently being negotiated with
c o u n t ries around the world on the conditions under
which seed specimens can be collected and added to
the bank. N ations that have already signed up
include Mexico, South A f ri c a ,N a m i b i a , M o z a m-
b i q u e ,Ve n e z u e l a ,M o r o c c o, E g y p t ,S y ria and Leba-
n o n . Often this means reaching agreement on crea-
ting two parallel collections. One is located in the
c o u n t ry concern e d .The second, “ b a c k - u p ”c o l l e c-
tion will be held at Wa k e h u rst Park while remaining
accessible on request to the depositing country.
Smith says that the need for a binding agr e e-
ment on what Kew can do with the seeds that it
stores can cause problems, for example when a
c o u n t ry lacks any formal mechanism for prov i d i n g
the “ p rior informed consent” for obtaining data on
its plants as required under the CBD.
The same desire to use Kew’s knowledge and
e x p e rience is reflected in a separate initiat i ve to har-
monize procedures for access to seed and germ-
plasm collections around the world.

As a result of this initiat i ve , r e p r e s e n t at i ves of
14 botanic gardens in 11 countries agreed at a mee-
ting in Beijing last year to adopt a common set of
p o l i cy guidelines setting out their commitments on
a c q u i ring and conserving genetic resources, on the
use and supply of such resources, and on the sha-
ring of benefits arising from their use, for example by
commercial organizations.
The new pri o rities that make up Kew’s curr e n t
agenda are ve ry different from those which determ i-
ned its influence a hundred ye a rs ago.“The last thing
we want is to be accused of being biopirat e s ,” s ay s
S m i t h .“ We must not deny that we ever did it. But we
must acknowledge that that world has gone.” ■
