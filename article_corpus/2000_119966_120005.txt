The court threw out the case. Yet the
system’s technical shortcomings, inclu-
ding the inability to prove a voter’s identi-
ty and to ensure the secrecy of the ballot,
were deemed unimport a n t . N e a r l y
86,000 Democrats cast ballots, 40,000 of
them through the Internet. Three-quar-
ters of the e-voters were between 18 and
35, an age group that is usually less inter-
ested in voting than their elders. Only
slightly over 12,000 people bothered to
turn out for the previous such primary
four years earlier.
Was the experiment conclusive? A
local paper, the Tucson Citizen, said many
voters were drawn more by the method’s
novelty than by the candidates. More
generally, Stephen Hess, of the Brookings
Institute, thinks that “procedural ques-
tions are not what prevents people from
voting.” But Santini believes that e-voting
is “an amazing opportunity for our
exhausted democratic system.”
The American firm Election.com has
announced it will provide such voting ser-
vices for next November’s U.S. presiden-
tial election. And Steve Case, of the huge
Internet service provider (ISP) America
Online (AOL), thinks experiments like
the one in Arizona are further proof that
the Internet is “transforming the way
people interact with their local and natio-
nal governments.”
Political parties, new citizens’ move-
ments and public authorities are increa-
singly quick to grasp that fact, at least in
c o u n t ries we a l t hy enough to have 
widespread Internet access. Until everyo-
ne has interactive digital television, the
Net seems to be the quickest, cheapest
and only truly interactive way for citizens
to exchange information and opinions
between themselves as well as with their
elected representatives.
Most political parties now have their
own websites to present their platforms.
Numerous public services use them to
explain their structure, operations and
aims and to answer people’s questions by
e-mail. And many municipalities provide
information and consult citizens by e-
mail before taking any major decision.
A chance
to voice views
New citizens groups that believe in a
different kind of globalisation also make
intensive use of the Internet. In South
Korea,where nearly half the population is
on line, 600 community organizations
recently posted a “black list” on the Web
of 90 parliamentary candidates with
murky pasts, including some who had
been convicted of corruption. Fifty-eight
of them were defeated in the subsequent
election, some by virtual unknowns.
Askwith suggests going one step fur-
ther. He sharply criticised the way a typi-
cal British Royal Commission set up to
study a controversial issue operated. In
practice, only the views of the panel’s
members and the “experts” who appea-
red before it carried any weight, he said.
The citizens who attended the hearing
were few and unrepresentative.They were
“mostly the retired and unemploye d ,
since the ill-publicised event took place
on a Thursday afternoon.” They did not
really understand the issue at hand and
were asked to speak only at the end of the
hearing, and even then only briefly and
for appearance’s sake.
■
A “dumb rage of impotence” is how
Richard A s k w i t h , a senior editori a l
writer for the British newspaper The
Independent on Sunday d e s c ribed his fee-
lings in a recent art i c l e . “ E ve rything our
government does it does in my name, yet
what say have I ever had? One vote in five
ye a rs , for a choice of scarcely distingui-
shable bands of disingenuous careeri s t s.
What kind of choice is that?”
Askwith is implacable:“Parliamentary
d e m o c r a cy, i nvented in the days of the
h o rse and cart and perfected during the
steam age,” has had its day. “ I t ’s time
g ove rnments found a new way to let the
people decide.”1
The solution? The Internet.
“ E - d e m o c r a cy will wake politics up,” s ay s
French MP André Santini,m ayor of the Pa ri s
s u burb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, which he has
made into a model Internet-connected tow n .
“I’m sure it can cure people’s disaffection
with politics, just as the Internet economy is
b e ating unemploy m e n t .”2
The Arizona
experiment
The clearest sign of this political apa-
thy is low voter turnout, to the point that
“these days universal suffrage is now only
universal in name,” says Santini.The first
I n t e rnet voting experiment was the
Democratic Party primary election in the
U.S. state of Arizona that took place from
March 7 to 11, 2000. Opponents of e-
voting went to court, arguing that it dis-
criminated against poor people without
Internet access (the “digital divide”).



IN T ERNET 
TO THE RESCUE 
OF DEMOCRACY ?
◗ René Lefort
Advocates of e-democracy profess that the Internet is the only way to bridge the gap 
between disaffected citizens and politicians. “Nonsense” say others
◗ Director of the UNESCO Courier
1. The Independent, September 4, 1999.
2.The French daily Libération, April 21,2000.
E-voting is “an amazing
o p p o r t u n i ty for our exhausted
d e m o c ratic system.”

In contrast, he says, stand the poten-
tial advantages of the Internet, which is
already used by campaigners who, though
scattered across the world, are all on-line
at the same time, sometimes several hun-
dred of them for days on end, delving
deeply into an issue and expressing infor-
med and considered opinions. T h e s e
groups are known as amphinets. It all
costs very little compared with a face-to-
face meeting of all the participants.
Askwith asks, why not use this method
and open it up to ordinary citizens chosen
at random? Their views, r e p r e s e n t i n g
public opinion, would reach the “repre-
sentatives of the people,” who would no
longer just vaguely hear them but be for-
ced to take their views seriously.
Other e-democracy advocates go even
f u rt h e r. R ather than settling for using elec-
tronic means merely to improve the flawe d
representativeness of elected officials, why
not do without them altogether? Marc
Strassman, executive director of the Cam-
paign for Digital Democracy,3 suggests an
electronic system good enough to eliminat e
any possibility of fraud.Voters would use it
to voice their views on every possible and
imaginable issue, from whether a country
should undertake a military operation to
deciding on the content of a proposed law.
The system would be advanced enough
to immediately and electronically analyse
the full range of opinions. Strassman says it
would correct the “large and gr owing imba-
lance in political influence between com-
mon people and the professional political
class and its clients who increasingly domi-
nate the initiative process.”
The time has gone when parliamentary
decisions were taken after “ c o n s u l t i n g
dozens of people whose opinions and views
are highly privileged at the expense of mil-
lions who are disadvantaged by this
c o n c e n t r ation of powe r ,” Strassman say s.
We should switch to “direct electronic
d e m o c r a cy ” where “millions of e-mail vo t e s
d e t e rmine the direction of the republic.” I n
s h o rt , he argues, “the Net becomes so
p owe r f u l , so ubiquitous and so easy to use”
that it can “let us govern ourselves.”
Santini thinks this will be the key to “a
shift from an occasional democracy to a
continuous one.” It would be akin to revi-
New ways: casting votes via the Internet during the Democratic Party’s primary in Arizona in March 2000.
ving the agora in ancient A t h e n s , the cradle
of democracy where the city’s 20,000 citi-
zens who were entitled to met and debat e d .
The Net would make such a forum per-
m a n e n t , instantaneous and, when eve ry
p e rson on the planet is on line, wo r l d w i d e .
Over-reliance
on technology
“Nonsense,” says Frenchman Jacques
A t t a l i , the founder of Planetfin a n c e ,4 an elec-
tronic microcredit netwo r k . F i rs t , the agora
would not be a democratic ideal: nobody has
thought of reviving it where that would be
p o s s i b l e , such as a village of a few hundred
i n h a b i t a n t s. W hy? Because the representa-
t i ve system would remain indispensable.
There is no doubt the system is in
crisis, says Patrick Viveret, who writes for
the French magazine Transversales Science
Culture. He notes a tendency in represen-
tative systems towards delegating authori-
ty that could go as far as confiscating it
altogether. So citizen participation would
be absolutely vital to genuine
r e p r e s e n t at i o n , and the Net wo u l d

p r ovide “substantial opport u n i t i e s ” i n
that regard.
But making e-democracy a “global alter-
n at i ve ” would mean giving too much powe r
to the “ t e c h n i c i s m ” which is taking over the
m o d e rn economy, the idea that “ p r o b l e m s
can be solved by technology, i n d e p e n d e n t l y
of the playe rs invo l ve d ,” wa rns V i ve r e t .
D e m o c r a cy requires “ c o l l e c t i ve intelli-
g e n c e ” , which is much more than merely the
sum of different opinions, as they are ins-
tantly served up by opinion polls today and
will be by the Internet tomorr ow (the
“ d e m o c r a cy of opinions”).There needs to
be “time for careful refle c t i o n ,n u rtured by
opinions and counter-opinions bri n gi n g
together mediat o rs who say what they think
in the public arena,” he say s.
Also needed, says Attali, is the “time
for political initiat i ves to prove their
worth.” That might entail a period of
unpopularity before they eventually gain
widespread support. The alternative, he
says, is an “Internet world” that would
lead to “excessively reversible and contra-
dictory decisions”, and consequently to a
“dictatorship of the here and now.” ■
