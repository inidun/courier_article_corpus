ANYONE CAN PLAY
What is your opinion of modern art? In what order of preference
would you classify a set of ten paintings without knowing the
name of the artist or the title of the work?
This is the game we invite you to play on the following eight colour
pages on which are reproduced five of the sets (of ten paintings
each) used in the Toronto inquiry into public attitudes to modern art.
1st set (page 19), 2nd set (pages 20-21), 3rd set (pages 22-23),
4th set (pages 24-25), 5th set (page 26). In each set the paintings
on the colour pages are numbered from one to ten for identifica¬
tion purposes only. The numbers do not correspond to the
classification indicated by the Toronto inquiry.
Here is how to play:
Taking each set in turn, rank the ten paintings in your personal
order of preference from one to ten.
For example, let us take the ten paintings on page 19 opposite.
If you like painting N° 6 best and N° 3 second best, write the figure
6 against the word "one" in the first column entitled "First set"
and the figure 3 against the word "Two", also in the first column,
and so on. Repeat this procedure for the four other sets.
When you have finished, turn to pages 27, 28, 29, and 30, where
our colour paintings are reproduced, in black and white, numbered
in the order of preference shown by the Toronto survey and appro¬
priately identified. The numbers in brackets correspond to the identi¬
fication numbers on the colour pages.

You will be able to compare your personal attitude towards modern
art to that of the "general public " as revealed by the Toronto inquiry.
This is a game not a test presented only for your amusement and
we ask you not to send us your classifications.

ANYONE CAN PLAY
(Continued)
(Do not read these pages
before seeing page 18)
// you have noted your own prefer¬
ences in the "Anyone Can Play"
game (see page 18), you can here
compare your results with those of
the Toronto poll.
Right, and on the following pages,
we reproduce, in black and white,
the five sets of paintings published
on our colour page's. Here the
paintings are numbered according
to the order of preference indicated
by the persons polled in Toronto.
No. 1 is the painting most liked;
No. 10 the painting least liked.
Beside jeach painting is the identifi¬
cation number (in parentheses) used
on our colour pages. In each case,
the name of the artist and the title
of the work are given together with,
wherever possible, date of painting
and present location. A short
commentary, based on the findings
of the Toronto inquiry, is given with
each set.

2ND COLOUR SET
PAGES 20-21
Nearly half of those ques¬
tioned on this set chose
Winter Street with Hor¬
ses and Sleighs by the
Canadian painter James
Morrice as their top pref¬
erence. Yet this was not a
judgement influenced by
national pride since only a
few persons said they had
seen it before. It actually
hangs in their own city's
Art Gallery where it is
considered to be a "very
well known "work. Fernand
Léger's Mother and Child
(2nd place) attained high
ranking "only because of
the recognizable subject".
Last place in the set went
to Piet Mondrian's Com¬
position in Blue. This
artist's works were "consis¬
tently and strongly dislik¬
ed", the poll found, even
though a major exhibition
of his paintings had been
held in Toronto shortly
before the inquiry.

3RD COLOUR SET
PAGES 22-23
This group of paintings pro¬
vided some interesting, not to
say surprising, results, and the
ranking order has been describ¬
ed as "unfathomable". The
Villon work, La Jeune Fille,
might have been expected to
end up at or near the bottom of
the list since the composition
is highly unconventional. Ins¬
tead it gets a fairly good rating
(No. 5) ahead of the Modi¬
gliani (No. 6), Buffet (No. 7)
and Picasso (No. 8). On
the other hand, the bridge on
the woman's head in Brau-
ner's painting (No. 9) was
apparently little appreciated.
It is curious to note that the
four least liked paintings all
have staring eyes which led
one commentator to remark
"there appears to be a dislike
for eyes that engage the view¬
er." One respondent thought
that all paintings were by the
same "modern" artist and
that all were "bad".

4TH COLOUR SET
PAGES 24-25
On page 7 it was pointed
out that Millet's The Ánge¬
lus was the top favourite of
the Toronto poll. Here it
will be seen that the paint¬
ing occupies second, not
first place behind Renoir's
The Box at the Theatre.
Why this discrepancy ? The
answer is that the poll
comprised several parts: In
one, a set of paintings was
presented and the persons
in the poll were asked to
choose only two paintings
the one they liked best and
the one they liked least of
all. Here the Millet came
out first above all other
paintings in the series.
In another part of the To¬
ronto poll the public was
shown the same set, but
this time the paintings were
examined with much more
detail and the persons in¬
terviewed were asked to
rank all ten paintings (not
just two) in order of pre¬
ference. In this more de¬
tailed study, the Millet drop¬
ped to second place behind
the Renoir.
This curious switch from
1st to 2nd place did not
occur only- in the case of
the Millet painting, but in
nearly a third of the total
of 23 sets used during the
inquiry. The distinction
between the two parts of
the poll is referred to in
the articles of this issue in
terms of "minor" sets and
"major" sets.
It is interesting to note that
the famous painting by
Grant Wood, American
Gothic was ranked low in
the set (No. 8) because,
though it was better known
to the people of Toronto
than any other work, many
persons said it was a
"parody" of the subject.

5TH COLOUR SET
PAGE 26
Choosing the order of pre¬
ference in this set may have
presented certain difficul¬
ties for the persons inter¬
viewed in Toronto, since
the paintings are notably
"abstract" or "non-repre¬
sentational". The majority
preferred the most "natura¬
listic" work, Claude Monet's
Water-lilies (the control
painting) being ranked No.
1. A fairly large number of
persons could see no reason
why this Monet painting
was grouped with the
others. Other comments
regarding the set as a
whole were : "abstract",
"pop art" ; "colours very
pretty", "just colour and
shape", "colours seem
messy or blurred ", "blobs " ;
"all have something in
them but hard to tell what",
"these are not art", "mean¬
ingless", "all terrible".
