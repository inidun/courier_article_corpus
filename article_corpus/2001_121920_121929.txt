B u m b a : the city
where cyclists are hero e s
Once supplied by the Congo River, this city controlled by rebel groups has
lost its vocation as one of the country’s bread baskets. Instead, cycling
shopkeepers travel perilously to bring back prized goods from afar, while
the Internet offers a reprieve from isolation
A
little Cessna from Aviation without
Borders loaded with crates of drugs
for the hospital makes big circles in
the sky before touching down in
B u m b a . Seen from above, t h e
runway looks like a strip of sand in the middle of
v e g e t a t i o n .The sound of the purring engine stirs
Bumba out of its lethargy. Men in uniform rush
towards the runway, blocking it with a wreck of
a truck, which a Ugandan offic e r
soon orders them to move.
Civilians hurry over on bicy c l e s,
and a European priest waves his
arms.
As soon as the plane arrives,
local taxis called “ t o l e k a s ” —
ancient bicycles with rear seats
padded with wool—pick up the
p a s s e n g e r s. Gently crunching in
the sand, the bikes have become
slumbering Bumba’s sole means
of transportation,except for a few
sputtering motorcycles owned by
diamond-hunters who display their
luck until they run out of fuel: a
barrel of oil costs $300.
The immense, majestic Congo River, the main
artery of this country, which is as large as Europe, i s
now impracticable.The whaling ships have stayed in
K i n s h a s a , the capital, the ferry boats are motionless,
the dug-out canoes lie carefully hidden in the tall
grass of the banks for fear that soldiers will
requisition them.
Bumba was once the centre of a fertile farming
area that kept Kinshasa supplied in manioc, rice and
palm oil. N o w a d a y s, the sleepy city lies in territory
controlled by one of the rebel groups sharing what
remains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
the former Zaire: the Movement for the Liberation
of the Congo,headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba, s t r o n g l y
supported and flanked by Ugandan troops.
Since the outbreak of the war, the shopkeepers
who once were supplied by the river have no other
choice but bicy c l e s.The local population hails them
as veritable heroes.The bravest travel all the way
to Kisangani, capital of Eastern province, o r
Butembo, on the Ugandan border, to bring back
two highly-prized treasures:bales of second-hand
clothes and blocks of salt.They reach astronomical
prices because the cyclists risk life and limb
pedalling across a thousand kilometres of forest in
w a r-torn areas where armed gangs survive by
looting and kidnapping civilians for ransom.Th e s e
m e n , who weigh an average of 60 kilos, carry loads
that sometimes exceed 100, and each trip takes
over two weeks.
Throughout the city, which has no potable water

or electricity,palm oil burns in small lamps ironically
named “Bemba lights” after the local warlord.
E l s e w h e r e, they are called “Kabila lights” after the
recently shot chief of state. Palm oil also turned
Father Carlos, a Belgian priest who has been living
in Equator province for 30 years, into a hero. I t
powers a generator he patched up to run an ancient
wireless telegraph, B u m b a ’s only means of
communication with the outside world.
But it would be wrong to think that this forlorn
place lives in a vacuum without order and
a u t h o r i t y. Fi r s t , rebel leaders, like the central
government elsewhere, maintain structures that
keep a close watch on the population and have the
means to transmit information without delay.
S e c o n d , the Congolese have formed thousands
of grassroots groups that oversee and organize
day-to-day activities,perform the function of social
c o n t r o l , distribute meagre resources, and even
mete out expeditious justice. And a foreigner
cannot walk around the market stalls without
paying a prior visit to the “president.” Elected by
the shopkeepers, he is responsible for keeping
order. He chooses stall locations, sets prices and
settles disputes.
Like in the poor neighbourhoods of Kinshasa
and other towns, crime is relatively low in Bumba,
not because people are more virtuous but because
“vigilance committees,” which were formed a long
time ago to try and prevent atrocities by the
m i l i t a r y, use every means at their disposal.When a
thief is caught in the act, he has the living daylights
beaten out of him and, in some cases, finds himself
with a flaming tyre around his neck. But human
rights organizations have also spread throughout
the country. They make observations, take notes,
publicize atrocities (and there are many) and write
reports.
Standing in the middle of Bumba, the hospital is
i m p e c c a b l e.The staff is dressed in white; the rooms
are swept clean;a young pharmacist proudly shows
off her rows of neat shelves. It takes visitors a few
moments to figure out why they feel uneasy. The
only healthcare facility in this city of 100,000 people
is practically empty.At the end of a long, deserted
c o r r i d o r,nuns have thrown a sheet over a motionless
shape on the flo o r, leaving only the army boots
sticking out.It is the body of a government soldier
taken prisoner who died of hunger because no one
could afford to feed him and he had no relatives in
the area. A physician on duty summed up the
s i t u a t i o n : people have no money.Not even enough
to pay for a doctor’s visit, which costs the equivalent
of two French francs, or the barest minimum of
d r u g s, much less sterile gloves, thread and bandages
for operations.
“Deaths outnumber births,” says Father Carlos,
“and there are more patients than pupils. M y
parishioners stay away from Sunday mass because
t h e y ’re ashamed of being seen wearing rags, o r
nothing at all!”
The schoolhouse doors have been stripped off,
the benches and blackboards taken away by people
who used them to make coffins. But they remain
remarkably organized.The student population has
dropped because families can afford to spend the
tiny sum required to pay school fees on only one of
their children.The government has not paid teachers
for ages, but every three months, parents contribute
the equivalent of one dollar, and the teachers eke
out a living on small incomes.
The classrooms at the Institut Notre Dame, a
private school run by nuns, offers a surprising
spectacle: the pupils have no textbooks. Instead,

t h e y work with a few overcrowded note-
b o o k s. Neat rows of arithmetic problems are
written out next to English and Latin grammar
lessons on the blackboard, and the pupils, who
speak polished
Fr e n c h , e a g e r l y
greet foreign
v i s i t o r s, a s k i n g
them,for example,
whether the
election of a new
president in the
United States will
change anything in
a devastating war
that nobody wants.
Civil servants
nostalgically recall
the one time they
have been paid in
the past three years: a few months after Kabila’s
seizure of power, they received $180 in wages and
back pay. Since then,they only go to work to keep
their spirits up and preserve their social standing,
carefully recording each visitor’s name and position.
Bumba may have few means of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n , but one of them is virtual: t h e
Internet has breathed new life into grassroots
o r g a n i z a t i o n s. When Father Carlos’ generator
w o r k s, volunteer groups use his satellite phone.
Perhaps the Internet has also enabled the
Congolese, who are living in a divided, occupied
c o u n t r y, to keep in touch with each other,c i r c u l a t e
information and, when necessary, contest the
authorities in place. The self-organization of civil
society has offset the vacuum of government and
preserved what, in the eyes of the Congolese,
represents the basics: the identity and unity of
their nation. ■
