B e nyao turn away hundreds of appli-
cants seeking to study at their school,

B e i j i n g . I t ’s not because they’re choosey:
they know all too well that these children
may not have another chance of stepping
into a classroom. But there is simply not
enough space to satisfy demand.
This unlicensed school caters to over
1,300 children from 28 Chinese prov i n c e s.
“ M a ny of the kids have to ride four different
buses to get here in the mornings, it takes
them up to two hours,” says Li.“And they
work hard knowing how difficult it is for
their parents to afford it.”W h at makes these
children different from other city-dwellers
is simply that they belong to China’s “ flo a-
ting population,” a label used to describe
people who are not permanently regi s t e r e d
in their current place of residence. Most are
the children of peasants who have left the
poverty-stricken countryside in search of
work in big cities.
E m p l oyed in menial jobs with no secu-

for the lion’s share of the tough physical
labour that has transformed urban skylines
in the past decade or so.While the govern-
ment puts the “ f l o ating populat i o n ” at
100 million,Western analysts estimate the
figure closer to 150 million, making the
phenomenon one of the largest ru r a l - t o -
urban migrations in history.
This migr ation began in 1979, w h e n
the commune system was dismantled.A gri-
cultural productivity boomed, f e wer hands
were needed to work the land, so families
headed to cities such as Beijing and Shan-
ghai. In the mid-1980s, as rural incomes
steadily fell, the trickle became a flo o d ,
prompting municipal authorities to tighten
m i gr ation ru l e s. M i grants would now be
required to get temporary residence perm i t s
and letters of employment before coming to
the city. In practice, tens of millions never



CHIN A’S MIGRANT CHIL DREN
FALL THROUGH THE CRACK S
◗ James Irwin
Despite China’s educational achievement, migrant children in the country’s big cities are
struggling to find a place in school. For many, the unlicensed route is at best, the only option

obtain such permits. As such, they are not
r e gistered in the place where they are living,
c o n t r a ry to permanent migrants whose
m ove is officially sanctioned.Their tempo-
r a ry status exposes them to widespread dis-
crimination.When it comes to education,
their only option, until recently, has been to
enroll their children in an unlicensed school.
Li Shumei left Henan Province in 1993
to work in a clothing market in Beijing.At
the time, she say s , there were no schools for
migrant children in the capital. Nor were
they allowed to enroll in city schools. A
f o rmer teacher, she started educating a few
children in her home before starting up a
school with her husband.“ For our pupils in
the lower grades, the level of Chinese and
m at h e m atics is about the same as in regular
s c h o o l s ,” said Li. Te a c h e rs have to make
do with a lack of books and other mat e ri a l s ,
but Li explains that one of the gr e at e s t
challenges is to help pupils overcome a
sense of inferi o rity wrought by their second-
class stat u s. And because the school is unli-
c e n s e d , they face difficulties re-enteri n g
the educational mainstream to continue in
higher gr a d e s , though many, once they
reach the age of 12, return to their home
p r ovinces to continue their schooling while
living with relatives.
Some of school’s teachers are recent
gr a d u ates from the students’ home pro-
vinces, others are retired instructors from
B e i j i n g .Their wages are less than half those
paid in the mainstream, with no benefit s.A l l
expenses incurred in running the school,
including salaries, are derived from paltry
tuition fees—about $100 a ye a r. Li was for-
t u n ate enough to receive a generous dona-
tion from a retired couple in Los Angeles
who read about the school in an overseas
Chinese newspaper. The funds were put
towards relocating the school when police
ordered its removal from an earlier site.
According to the Ford Fo u n d at i o n ,t h e r e
are between 200 and 300 unlicensed schools
o p e r ating in the capital which struggle to
p r ovide schooling for an estimat e d
1 0 0 , 0 0 0 m i grant children, m a ny of whom
r e c e i ve no education at all. D o r o t hy Solinger,
a political science professor at the Unive rs i t y
of California at Irvine and author of C o n t e s-
c i t i e s ,” said Solinger. “The municipal
g ove rnments in some cities are now more
p e rm i s s i ve about letting parents set up
schools of their ow n . More migrants can
afford to pay the extra fee required for their
children to attend city schools, not to men-
tion that some migrant parents can now
afford to purchase the card which enables
their children to attend city schools on city
t e rm s.”
O ver the ye a rs howe ve r , people from the
provinces have become accustomed to fen-
ding for themselves to provide education.
“ We actually prefer it when the gove rn m e n t
leaves us alone,” says Chen Yi Fu. “When
they visit the school, they usually either try
to close us down or fine us for va ri o u s
things.”
But with the likelihood that China will
soon join the World Trade Organization and
compete in world agricultural markets, a
large portion of the country’s 800 million
farmers might find it even more difficult to
s u rv i ve in the country s i d e . If current trends
continue, there is little doubt that migrant
e d u c at i o n , and more broadly, m i grant ri g h t s ,
will become an increasingly pressing issue on
the government’s books. ■

t h at only 40 per cent of migrant children
b e t ween five and twe l ve attended school in
B e i j i n g, compared with 100 per cent of nat i ve
c h i l d r e n .This situation is mirrored in other
booming cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
Chen Yi Fu, p rincipal of the Hu Wan Ele-
m e n t a ry school in nort h - e a s t e rn Shanghai,
e s t i m ates that “in some migrant communities,
only 20 to 30 per cent of children go to
s c h o o l .” O f ficial statistics differ.According to
a 1996 study conducted by the Depart m e n t
of Basic Educat i o n , the average enrollment
r atio of migrant children stood at 96.2 per
c e n t .The study at t ri buted non attendance to
ove r c r ow d i n g, high fees and an unfavo u r a b l e
home env i r o n m e n t .
Media exposure and pressure from
s e veral delegates from the National Pe o p l e ’s
C o n gress led to a change in the law in May
1 9 9 8 .The central gove rnment decreed that
unlicensed schools could exist and that it is
u n l awful for large municipalities to deny
entrance to migrant children between six
and 14 who had lived for more than six
months in the area. City gove rnments often
responded by jacking tuition fees to impos-
sibly high levels for  migrants—up to $440
a n n u a l l y, when the average yearly income
of a migrant worker in Beijing is an esti-
m ated $600. And to dat e , only a handful of
c i t i e s , such as Wuhan and Guiya n g, h ave
granted legal status to migrant schools
according to the Pe o p l e ’s Economic Jo u rn a l.
For Chen Yi Fu,a native of Anhui Pro-
vince, “the Shanghai government doesn’t
feel they are responsible for educating our
children, even though the latter belong to
families from rural areas who do all the
hard jobs.” Y i F u ’s school cat e rs to chil-
dren from 13 provinces, who pay close to
$100 per year for tuition. “They are the
lucky ones,” he said, bemoaning the $7,000
rent he has to pay each year to the army,
which owns the land.
Besides the 1998 law howe ve r , t h e r e
are signs that the situation is slowly chan-
gi n g . Recognizing that China’s economic
miracle has clearly not benefitted all regi o n s ,
the central gove rnment has embarked on a
m a s s i ve scheme to invest in the country ’s
h i n t e r l a n d . M o r e ove r , “there are indica-
tions that in some respects, things are get-
ting slightly better for rural migrants in big



“ We actually prefer it when
the government leaves us
alone. When they visit the
school, they usually either try
to close us down or fine us for
various things.”
One of the greatest challenges
is to help pupils overcome
a sense of inferiority wrought
by their second-class sta t u s .
