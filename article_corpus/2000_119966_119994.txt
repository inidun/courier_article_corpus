a handful were activists like her.They were fussed
over by the men in the organizat i o n , who wanted to
show they were modern-minded and strongly in
favour of wo m e n ’s emancipat i o n .The UNEM exe-
c u t i ve committee welcomed Skalli and she took
on her first political responsibilities.
King Hassan II, who came to the throne in
1961,soon called a halt to these “antics.” In 1965,
a high-school student rebellion grew into a popular
u p rising and a state of emergency was declared.T h e
UNEM was decapitated when all its leaders were
drafted into the army. Except for Skalli, t h at is,
who gr e atly resented being treated differently
because of her sex. “I had dreams about an army
t ruck that would pick me up and take me away
with my comrades.”
Skalli acquired her yen for politics during these
ye a rs of activism. But the state of emergency drove
the UNFP, of which she was a member, u n d e r-
gr o u n d . Morocco entered a period of political
repression. Women party members busied them-
s e l ves with looking after political pri s o n e rs ’ fa m i l i e s.
Badia Skalli had the good fortune to be born at
a time when the world made sense, and eve-
rything was linked to some kind of cause.
F i rst came the struggle for independence, then the
big push to build a new and freer country. Cold rea-
lity eventually dashed these hopes, but from the
outset,there had been that dream.
Skalli was born in 1944 in El Ja d i d a , about 100
kilometers south of Casablanca.At 10 she had her
first taste of political activism.A pro-independence
d e m o n s t r ation passed her house, and suddenly she
was marching in step with the protesters. T h i s
earned her a good hiding when she got home,but
the seed had been sown.
When Skalli enrolled at the Unive rsity of Casa-
blanca in 1962 to study law, the National Union of
Moroccan Students (UNEM) was at its height and
spearheading the left-wing opposition part y, t h e
N ational Union of Popular Forces (UNFP).
“You just had to join in,” she remembers.“You
just felt it so strongly.The students were the elite.”
Women students were few and far betwe e n ,and only

For years, M o roccan member of parliament Badia Skalli has put her long-standing loyalty

◗ Freelance journalist based in
Casablanca
In Casablanca, thousands of Islamic conservatives took to the streets on March 12,2000 to protest a proposed reform 
of the family legal code, which governs the status of women.

The young Skalli married, but her husband was
killed in a road accident three ye a rs lat e r. It took her
several years to recover.
The call of politics was too compelling. W h e n
the UNFP split in 1975, she sided with the part y ’s
“ d e m o c r at i c ”wing to help found the Socialist Union
of Popular Forces (USFP),which meant giving up the
tempting dream of revo l u t i o n .The battle was now to
be fought within the institutional bounds defined by
the law. Skalli was one of the part y ’s few female can-
d i d ates in the 1976 local elections, the first to be
held under the state of emergency.
She campaigned in a poor, p r e d o m i n a n t l y
Berber-speaking area, where she found women cut
off from the world because they were illiterate and
did not understand Arabic. She had put her finger
on the plight of Moroccan wo m e n .The young can-
d i d ate also found that vo t e rs had no preconceptions
about women in politics and judged her by what she
s a i d . But the party asked her not to mention the fa c t
that she was a widow—a woman without a hus-
band—in her nomination papers.
S k a l l i ’s election bid fa i l e d , and she took it badly
because the party had lost a seat . The issue of
wo m e n ’s part i c i p ation in politics sparked little
public interest. But she was leader of the USFP’s
wo m e n ’s organizat i o n , founded in 1975 duri n g
I n t e rn ational Wo m e n ’s Ye a r. Awareness was ri s i n g,
but female party activists still put wo m e n ’s issues on
the back burner.
“Next to the historic figures who had fought for
independence or spent time in pri s o n , we felt small
and tended to fade into the backgr o u n d ,” she say s.
Though a key figure in the USFP, it was a long time
before Skalli gained enough self-confidence to assert
her rightful place in the party.
After another defeat at the polls, this time in a
p a r l i a m e n t a ry election, she won a municipal council
s e at in 1983. Two women Socialist Pa rty candi-
dates were elected in the same town and the party
planned to make Skalli the council president.The
proposal triggered an uproar. Despite being socia-
lists, some “comrades” were dead-set against the
i d e a . “A people who entrust their business to a
woman are heading for ru i n at i o n ,” the prophet
Mohammed is supposed to have said.The party lea-
d e rship backed down and the job went to a yo u n g e r
and less qualified man. Skalli had to settle for being
the council vice-president.
The practical experience of sharing power with
men was highly instructive. “Everything happens
behind the scenes, in the framework of a male com-
plicity that shuts out women,” she says. Women’s
issues rarely interest men, she notes, and because
female politicians are so few, they are “like clay
pots against iron ones.”
N ow that she had entered the fight for political
power as an equal,Skalli saw repressed machismo
coming to the surface again.The USFP’s decision
to put her up as a parliamentary candidate sparked
rebellion in the ranks and she encountered her firs t
sexist at t a c k s , such as “she smokes. . . s h e ’s a widow.”
But she was pleased to note once more how little her
gender mattered to the vo t e rs. In fa c t ,m a ny people
b e l i e ved she was more tru s t wo rt hy than men
because of her sex.
S k a l l i ’s political career continued to prosper
and she remained a staunch party stalwa rt . S h e
campaigned for wo m e n ’s ri g h t s , but “the party still
came firs t .” Until the 1993 parliamentary elec-
tions, the USFP wanted her to be its only female
candidate. At that point, she protested and threa-
tened to withdraw if other women were not allowe d
to stand.The party gave in.
Two woman entered parliament that ye a r , a
milestone for Morocco—Skalli and Lat i fa Bennani
Smires of the Istiqlal (Nationalist) Party. Just two
women among 300 men.After the 1997 elections,
there were still only two. But the political scene
c h a n g e d . The left-wing opposition, kept out of
power for nearly 40 years, took over the reins of
government and USFP secretary-general Abder-
rahmane Youssoufi became prime minister. In his
inaugural speech,Yo u s s o u fi said he wanted to pro-
mote wo m e n ’s ri g h t s. The secretary of state for
protection of the family and children got to work on
the matter with the help of women’s NGOs.
Bitter attacks over proposed code
A year lat e r , a draft programme to “make wo m e n
p a rt of the development process” was presented
to the prime minister. It included a reform of the
mudawana, the family legal code based on sharia
(Islamic law), which governs the status of women.
The planned reforms include abolishing polygamy,
raising the marriage age for girls from 15 to 18
a n d , in eve ry case, replacing repudiation with court -
a p p r oved divo r c e . “It was too good to be tru e ,”
s ays Skalli. “But we believed in it.We didn’t expect
such a fuss.”
The first attack on the project came from a
member of the government itself, religious affairs
minister Abdelkebir Alaoui M’d a g h ri .A broad range
of conservat i ves led by Islamic fundamentalists
took up the cry.They put on a show of force, b i t t e r l y
attacking the reform’s supporters as bad Muslims
and even atheists. Bogged down by internal divi-
s i o n s , the gove rnment is playing for time. T h e
reform is a burning issue,and the government has
no intention of getting burned.
The gove rn m e n t ,s ays Skalli, b e a rs an import a n t
responsibility and has clearly displayed a lack of cou-
rage on the issue of women. She recognizes that
much is at stake, for women in particular and
Moroccan society in general, and finds the situat i o n
distressing. But what can you do when you are “a
clay pot”? ■
Now that she had entered 
the fight for political power 
as an equal, Skalli saw 
re p ressed machismo coming
to the surface again.
