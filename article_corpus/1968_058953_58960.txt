, BUSE of drugs is an
affliction that has plagued mankind
throughout history. It has caused
immeasurable harm in the past and
continues to do so today.
For the last fifty years nations
have been co-operating closely to
solve this problem. They have creat¬
ed and put into force a system of
treaties and regulations governing
national and international trade in
narcotics. And it has often been
suggested that the system built up
over the years could well be adopted
as a model in other fields.
But the application of national and
international control to trade in nar¬
cotics has promoted in its turn the
growth of a "black market" in these
products, an illicit traffic with which
the police forces of the world now
have to contend.
JEAN NEPOTE is Secretary-General of
Interpol (the International Criminal Police
Organization).
These are the basic facts of the
problem.
The motivations of drug addiction,
of course, are completely different
depending on whether one is consider¬
ing a heroin addict in New York or
a smoker of hashish in Africa, a
chewer of coca leaves in the Andes
or an opium addict in Hong Kong.
I do not propose to discuss the
psychological maladjustments or the
physical needs which induce a person
to abuse drugs; I wish simply to
review the present situation and to
show how efforts are being made to
deal with it.
To provide a clear picture of the
present state of drug abuse is far
from easy for, as one might imagine,
no precise figures exist of the number
of drug addicts in the world. Statis¬
tics are difficult to obtain, partly
because drug taking is a clandestine
affair and addicts do not announce
the fact to the authorities. Further¬
more many countries still lack the
administrative services which would
enable them to identify and register
drug addicts.
The number of drug addicts varies
considerably from one region of the
world to another and according to the
types of drugs employed. In North
America (U.S.A. and Canada) two
main types of drug are taken, 1)
heroin, affecting about 60,000 persons
(55,000 officially indicated in the
U.S.A. and 2,200 in Canada), and 2)
cannabis which is mostly smoked in
the form of marijuana cigarettes, par¬
ticularly in the U.S.A.
South America's chief drug is the
coca leaf, chewed by at least four
million Indians living in the Andean
Highlands; coca leaves are also used
to produce cocaine which is employed
in various parts of the world by certain
drug addicts.
In Africa, the drug most frequently
used is cannabis, and it is estimated
that the number of persons who
smoke cannabis runs into the tens of
thousands, especially in rural areas.

In Europe the problem of drug
addiction is négligeable except for
reports of the increasing use of can¬
nabis, particularly by young people.
A number of heroin addicts have been
noted in the Federal Republic of
Germany, France, Italy and U.K., but
most of these originated with medical
treatment.
In the Near and Middle East, some
countries are untroubled by drug
addiction whereas in others it is a
serious problem. The United Arab
Republic has many hashish smokers
and a far from négligeable number
of opium smokers. Iran faces a
difficult problem with the switch from
opium to heroin following the coura¬
geous decision of the Iranian govern¬
ment in 1955 to outlaw all use, trade
and production of narcotic drugs.
In the Far East and South-East
Asia, there are still a large number
of opium addicts, in the order of
300,000 to 350,000. The Far East,
like the United States, is undoubtedly
a sensitive focal point in the world
of drug abuse. Governments in the
region frankly admit that many rural
communities in Burma, Thailand and
Laos cultivate the opium poppy and
smoke the drug. Singapore has at
least 10,000 opium smokers, and
Malaysia probably more.
The black spot of the region is
Hong Kong which may have as many
as 80,000 to 100,000 heroin addicts.
A government White Paper published
in 1959 calculated at 170 million Hong
Kong dollars the sums squandered
each year on the clandestine drug
market in Hong Kong.
There are also about 3,000 heroin
addicts in Japan. Of mainland China
we can say nothing, since no official
data is available.
If the national and international
regulations governing the legal nar¬
cotics trade were strictly enforced,
drug addicts would have no source
of supply and would rapidly disappear.
As a result of very precise interna¬
tional agreements, trade in all nar
cotic drugs, whether natural or manu¬
factured, has been severely restricted.
The opium poppy is the basis of
opium and its derivatives: morphine
and heroin. International agreements
therefore, as a first step limited the
number of countries authorized to
produce opium. (There are presently
seven Bulgaria, Greece, India, Iran,
Turkey, USSR and Yugoslavia. Gree¬
ce and Iran, however, have stopped
production).
A complex system of controls,
export and import licenses, was orga¬
nized so that, theoretically, not a
single gramme of opium could escape
control and be diverted from the
authorized trade channels through
which the legitimate needs of medi¬
cine, science and industry are suppli¬
ed. Unfortunately, despite all these
efforts, reality is still rather far from
theory.
Authorized production is diverted
to illegal use, either by producers who
fail to declare the totality of their
crop to the official monopoly, or by

TRADE
ROUTES
OF ILLICIT
DRUGS
Tentacular "trade routes" of the
world's illicit drug traffic criss¬
cross this map prepared by Inter¬
pol in 1967. It shows the areas of
production and drug extraction,
from opium to morphine and from
cannabis crops to marijuana, and
the routes and means of transport.
From the plantations where the
opium poppy is grown illicitly and
from the High Plateaux of the Andes
where the leaves of the coca bush
are harvested, as well as from the
fields where cannabis is grown in
Africa and the Middle East, the raw
materials of narcotic drugs flow-
to ports for illicit export. Traffickers
try to use every trick in the trade
to move their drugs across frontiers.
Vast and complex organizations,
comprising their own pernicious
army of chemists, smugglers, ban¬
kers, wholesalers and retailers spread
a formidable network across the
world. Interpol has set up its
own formidable network to coun¬
teract these clandestine activities.

farmers who plant a larger surface
than that authorized. Anyone familiar
with rationing during the Second
World War can easily imagine this
situation. Moreover, there are vast
areas in the world which have vir¬
tually no government control and
where poppies are grown illegally on
a large scale.
To sum up the opium situation, we
find a sort of crescent-shaped "fis¬
sure" from the Near East to South-
East Asia where opium is produced
illegally. To put it in figures, we
quote an estimate found in a recent
report of the Central Permanent
Opium Committee: 1,200 tons of
opium are apparently produced ille¬
gally in the world while legal pro¬
duction amounts to about 800 tons,
to supply legally recognized needs.
This figure of 1,200 tons was recently
confirmed.
International trade routes in opium
and its derivatives (morphine and
heroin) start from this vast region.
Some reach the United States via
the Mediterranean and Europe; others,
via South-East Asia and Singapore,
reach Hong Kong, Japan and occasion¬
ally the West Coast of the United
States and Canada. There are of
course subsidiary regional zones, but
it would take too long here to list
the various routes.
As for cannabis, it is impossible to
make an accurate estimate of its ille¬
gal production because it can grow
wild just about anywhere, so long as
the climate is at all suitable. Its
traffic is also international in scale.
The situation is a little clearer as
regards cocaine, although it is no less
alarming: most of the cocaine traffic
originates in South America and par¬
ticularly in Bolivia and Peru.
To give a better idea of the
complexity of these problems, it
should be stressed that the illegal
smuggling of narcotics, considered
from a purely national point of view,
is in no way related to drug addiction.
Perhaps the best example is that of
France where the number of heroin
addicts is négligeable but where
important quantities of morphine and
heroin are seized regularly (186 kilos
in 1967) which indicates the existence
of processing laboratories in that
country.
From the criminologist's point of
view, drug smuggling is a special
offence, with a pattern all of its own.
Unlike most criminal offences, there
are, strictly speaking, no victims; no
one complains to the police of injury
or damages; no one reports that he
has obtained a certain quantity of
drugs or how he did so; in this type

of violation of the law, the addict is
the accomplice of the smuggler and
the peddlar.
Nor do cases of drug trafficking
offer much scope for the "scientific"
police investigation. There are few
clues to be gathered at the scene
of the crime; no possibility of techni¬
cal analysis or observation; few fin¬
gerprints which could lead to the
identification of the culprit.
Another peculiarity of the drug traf¬
fic is that, it is often in the hands of
old offenders who are well acquainted
with the dark and slippery ways of
the underworld. It is not usually a
game for novices. The U.S. Commis¬
sioner of Narcotic Drugs reported a
few years ago that 63 per cent of
those arrested for narcotic offences
in the U.S.A. had previous criminal
records.
Traffic in drugs, hence, is the per¬
fect type of organized crime. It is
clearly impossible for the same per¬
son to harvest a kilo of opium in his
own fields in India or Burma, to turn
it into 100 grammes of morphine and
then into 100 grammes of heroin, and
after that cross to the United States,
Canada or Hong Kong to sell it.
On the contrary, the illicit drug
traffic is a "big business" operation,
whose instigators first have to invest
large sums in the purchase of drugs.
They also must hire specialists or at
least persons capable of processing
the raw material through several
stages. They have to set up a
transport system, often stretching
over thousands of miles. Finally,
they have to penetrate and become
known in the closed circles of the
narcotics racket in order to sell their
products.
In the illegal drug trade, there are
the producers of raw material, the
processors or manufacturers, the
wholesalers, semi-wholesalers, retail¬
ers, bankers and carriers.
Good products have their brand
names; blocks of morphine labelled
"999" are famous; so are the little
bags of cannabis marked "The keys
of Paradise". It is not unusual to
see packets marked "Genuine quality
product; beware of imitations".
Drug smugglers are wily and daring.
They use every trick to move their
merchandise. Heroin has been dis¬
covered in the walls of refrigerators
(Hong Kong), in oscilloscopes (USA);
bales of goatskins stuffed with mor¬
phine have been found in Marseilles.
A few months ago, near Geneva, a
Turkish truck loaded with water me¬
lons was stopped; hidden in specially
prepared compartments the police

102 countries in the Interpol network
found 500 kilogrammes of morphine.
In South-East ' Asia small tourist
planes sometimes put down on impro¬
vised landing fields and load opium
which is then parachuted over the
sea. Protected by plastic bags, the
opium is towed underwater and
smuggled into port.
To cross the U.S. frontiers, drug
smugglers recruit "carriers" who, in
the guise of simple tourists, carry
rigged suitcases from one address to
another. Spurred by periodic arrests
and failures, the drug traffickers are
constantly trying to evade the police
and in this incessant battle of wits,
it is obviously the trafficker who
nearly always has the initiative; it is
he who makes the first move.
The world-wide traffic in narcotics
obviously is not an operation master¬
minded by a single gang. But the
activities of small groups of smugglers
together forge a chain that encircles
the world. All these gangs have
their "territories", their contacts with
other gangs, sometimes their mono¬
polies and often their rivalries.
By and large the fight against the
illicit traffic in narcotics is an extre¬
mely difficult one for the police.
Following up the intricate threads of
its clandestine operations involves
long and patient investigation. First
a few suspects have to be singled
out and shadowed continuously for
long periods. Scraps of information
picked up have to be pieced together
like the parts of a jigsaw puzzle until
a coherent pattern is revealed. For
days and nights on end investigators

must watch without being seen, sha¬
dow their quarry without arousing sus¬
picion. And even modern aids such
as cameras with telephoto lenses
cannot solve all their problems.
If it is to be effective, police action
has to be co-ordinated and centraliz¬
ed on a national scale. For many
years the United Nations and the
International Criminal Police Organi¬
zation (Interpol) have urged that
in each country the repression of the
illicit drug traffic should be entrusted
to special investigators with authority
over large areas, and that their action
should be co-ordinated through a
central office.
Co-ordination of police action inter¬
nationally is another indispensable
factor and it was precisely to accom¬
plish this that Interpol was created.
Interpol is not an autonomous
police force which sends out its
detectives all over the world to inves¬
tigate crime and arrest criminals. It
is an organization with international
headquarters in France at St-Cloud,
on the outskirts of Paris, and its job
is to maintain mutual collaboration
between the world's police forces in
the struggle against crime. One need
hardly add that one of its responsi¬
bilities is to co-ordinate the fight
against drug smuggling.
The need-for international action
had first to be recognized by the
police in the various countries, and
they had to realize that their respon¬
sibility did not stop at their own
frontiers. Then machinery for this
co-operation was needed and, as a
priority, the creation in each country
of a special international police liaison
service which would also serve as a
base, for dealing with international
problems.
Today, 102 countries each have this
special police service known as the
"National Central Office-Interpol,"
through which information is exchang¬
ed and arrangements for co-operation
channelled.
The General Secretariat of Inter¬
pol was created as the co-ordinating
body for the centres and as a records
and information centre for police
affairs.
Through the vast network formed
by the National Central Offices and
the Interpol Secretariat there is
now daily co-operation in tracking
down criminals on the run, identifying
suspects, exchanging data, handling
requests for investigations of every
kind everything in fact, which can
help an investigation to succeed
through international action.
To make such contacts easier,
Interpol has set up its own radio
network in which 40 countries now par¬
ticipate. Last year the network trans¬
mitted 120,000 messages, many hun-

dreds of them concerning traffic in
narcotics.
In its role as world headquarters
against international crime, the Inter¬
pol Secretariat not only keeps re¬
cords of all traffickers and of all per¬
sons implicated in any way with the
drug traffic; it also circulates their des¬
criptions and gathers information on
gangs and their smuggling techniques.
One day for example, a man inform¬
ed the Belgian police that he had
been approached to drive his car with
a quantity of drugs from Istanbul
(Turkey) to Western Europe. He was
asked to maintain contact with the
smugglers.
The Turkish police were alerted and
took steps to keep in touch with the
driver and to catch the smugglers
red-handed. The gang, however, was
wary and revealed their plan of ope¬
ration to the "carrier" only in snippets:
a hiding place had been arranged in
the petrol tank of his car. The mor¬
phine was to be driven to Marseilles
and delivered in exchange for half a
Turkish pound note, the other half of
which he would be given just before
leaving Istanbul. On his return trip he
was to travel via Switzerland and
pick up a lead of contraband watches.
On the day he was due to leave,
the Turkish police searched his car
and discovered nearly 40 kilos of mor¬
phine. Most of the gang were iden¬
tified and arrested: information sent to
the French police enabled them to
identify the person who was to receive
the drug in Marseilles.
Sometimes operations of this type
are more complex and delicate. In
such cases, a detective from Hong
Kong, for instance, might be sent to
Bangkok to give the authorities there
details of a case which began in Hong
Kong, but which also had ramifications
in Thailand.
The world still has hundreds of
thousands of drug addicts, but there
would be many many more if pre¬
ventive and repressive measures had
not been adopted and applied on a
world scale. Great progress has been
made in international police co-opera¬
tion since the groundwork was laid
during the period between the two
World Wars.
Yet no one could deny that flaws
still exist in the present system for
stamping out the illicit traffic in drugs.
Not all countries attach the same
importance to the problem, and over
large areas official controls are either
non-existent or inadequate, which
makes things much easier for the
smugglers.
Frontier control is especially diffi¬
cult, in one area because of the topo¬
graphy of the country, in another be¬
cause control services are swamped
by the volume of travellers crossing
the border. The extraordinary ease
with which people travel nowadays
makes it difficult for the police to cap¬
ture all the smugglers and criminals
who slip unseen among them.
Fresh problems have been created
by the new synthetic drugs, LSD
among them.
The police have a difficult job ahead
of them. And they will not succeed
in it unless at the same time the fun¬
damental economic, social and edu¬
cational problems are solved in cer¬
tain parts of the world. Arresting a
drug smuggler is fine. But a drug
smuggler without a job because he
has no merchandise or no customers
would certainly be far betterl
