LFRICA's problems of today
are sometimes described as being
those of the transition from ways and
ideas of the more or less distant past
to ways and ideas of the modern
world. This idea of transition is a
useful one, at least so long as one
keeps in mind that the ways and ideas
of Africa's more or less distant past
were valid forms of civilization, in their
day and age, and not some kind of
hopeless barbarism.
But there may be a better definition
for Africa's problems of today, espe¬
cially in those large regions that are
still under foreign rule, whether colo¬
nial or racist. I suggest that these
BASIL DAVIDSON, British writer and his¬
torian, Is one of the most respected world
authorities on African history and contem¬
porary affairs and has published 17 books
on Africa since 1950. He has closely studied
the history and current situation of Indepen¬
dence movements In Portuguese African
colonies and has several times visited liber¬
ated areas of these territories: Guinea (Bissau)
(1967 and 1972), Mozambique (1968) and
Angola (1970). His "Uberation of Guiñé"
(with a preface by Amilcar Cabrai) was pub.-
lished in 1969, and "In the Eye of the Storm:
Angola's People' In 1972.
problems are really those of the
renewal of indigenous processes of
social and cultural development: of
the renewal, that is, of processes which
were already in existence before the
period of foreign rule but which were
stopped and distorted by the conse¬
quences of foreign rule, and remain
so to this day.
Essentially, then, these are the
developmental problems of a genuine
and effective democratization within
the framework of modernizing institu¬
tions. Looked at in this light, the
problems of the inhabitants of the Por¬
tuguese colonies, a total of some
fifteen million Africans and about half
a million Portuguese and other Euro¬
pean settlers or employees, appear in
all their difficulty.
The position of these Africans is a
rather special one, though possessing
obvious parallels with that of their
neighbours in Rhodesia and South
Africa. This specialness doesn't arise
from the antiquity of Portugal's adven¬
tures in Africa, for the story of Portu¬
guese colonialism is little different in
its broad outlines from that of any
other colonial power.

It's true, of course, that Portuguese
soldiers were able to seize and mini¬
mally colonize a few coastal areas of
Angola and Mozambique as long ago
as the 16th century, while others
pushed up the valley of the Zambezi
as far as Sena and Tete, where they
had founded settlements before 1600.
But the effective colonial occupation
of these vast territories of Angola and
Mozambique, and of the smaller terri¬
tory of West African Guiñé (the old
"Rios do Cabo Verde"), began only

-,
In the 1890s and was not made com¬
plete until the 1920s.
The specialness arises from some¬
thing else. It arises from the nature
of the Portuguese colonial system and
ethos, and above all from their refusal
to make any least concession to the
claims of African equality and sov¬
ereignty in- Africa.
The motivations of those who govern
Portugal are various and interesting.
But whatever they are their stern
intransigence and words far less
polite could reasonably be used, and
often are has enormously enhan¬
ced the problems of modernization.
This intransigence has meant that
the necessary journey "into the modern
world" of the Africans whom they
rule cannot begin so long as they
remain in command.
Within the Portuguese system these
Africans may be able, if rarely, to
acquire the elements of modern edu¬
cation, but it will only be an education
designed to serve the ends of Portu
guese nationalism. These Africans
may be able to participate in moderniz¬
ing forms of economic activity, but
once again it will only be as servants
or subordinates of an economy design¬
ed to benefit Portugal.
The present Prime Minister of Por¬
tugal, Professor Marcello Caetano, has
explained why. "The natives of Africa",
he wrote in an important doctrinal
statement of 1954, never since modi¬
fied "must be directed, and organized

On September 24,
1973, the Republic of
Guinea (Bissau) was
proclaimed by the first
session of the newly
elected National As¬
sembly held in the
liberated areas of the
country. General elec¬
tions for the members
of the National Assem¬
bly were held in 1972
by the African Party
for the Independence
of Guinea (Bissau) and
Cape Verde, known as
PAIGC, following meet¬
ings throughout the
liberated areas (right)

auxiliaries. The blacks must be seen
as productive elements organized, or
to be organized, in an economy direct¬
ed by whites", (,0s Nativos na
Economía Africana, Coimbra 1954),
Denied the hope of peaceful change,
the "natives of Africa", as we know,
have chosen armed resistance rather
than continued surrender to foreign
rule, just as the natives of other conti¬
nents have done in situations not
dissimilar.
Much has been written about this
armed resistance, but really it is not
the interesting or important part of the
story. That part lies in the use which
the movements of resistance have
made of areas, large or small, from
which they have evicted Portuguese
control. There, at last, they have
been able to begin to run their own
affairs, and, in doing that, to forge new
institutions and structures of society
that can underpin the needs of mat¬
erial and cultural progress.
Here, in other words, the tasks of
democratization within modernizing
frameworks are being tackled for the
first time in these territories. No
longer "auxiliaries" of the colonial
system, Africans in these liberated
areas can stand on their own feet and
face the challenge of their own
problems.
What do you find in these liberated
areas? Many visitors from many coun¬
tries, and of many political loyalties,
have gone there to discover the ans¬
wer. Almost all their reports, whether
enthusiastic or sceptical, "committed"
or neutral or even hostile, are in
substantial agreement on the essence
of the matter (1). They find long-
deprived peoples who are caught up
in a major effort to modernize their
lives, and to rule themselves in ways
that are as different from their own
ways of the more, or less distant past
as from the ways of colonial rule.
These peoples apparently see no
gain in working for a mere reform of
colonial structures and institutions, for
no such reform, as they often say, can
set them free. What they are engag¬
ed upon is something greater and
more useful. They define this by what
they do and aim for, but their leading
spokesmen have also defined it in
words which have the ring of profound
meditation. They are fortunate in
having found spokesmen and leaders
of an often remarkable and momentous
talent.
Thus the late Amilcar Cabrai, found¬
er and outstanding leader of the
PAIGC in Guiñé and the Cape Verde
Islands, is the author of writings now
widely recognized as significant con¬
tributions to the theory of social change
among so-called "under-developed"
peoples.
He has described the movements of
liberation as comprising "a forced
march on the road to cultural pro¬
gress", because the compulsions of
armed resistance have here found
their most positive element in the
(1) After an initial visit to colonial Angola
in 1954, the present writer has so far made
four visits to liberated areas: to those of
the liberation movement in Guinea (Bissau)
and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in 1967, to those
of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FREL1MO)
in Mozambique in 1968, to those of the
People's Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) In Angola In 1970, and again
to Guinea (Bissau) in 1972.
drive for , and achievement of new
understandings, new ideas, new modes
of individual and community behaviour,
and, with all this, a new means of
mastering the problems of national
freedom (A. Cabrai, National Libera¬
tion and Culture, lecture delivered at
Syracuse University, New York, Feb.
20, 1970. See also article page 12).
And they have done this because
these movements are nothing if not
movements of voluntary participation.
They are "schools of progress" even
more than they are fighting units or
other means of self-defence.
Or consider a definition of what
these liberated areas are really about
that comes from the Angolan leader,
Dr Agostinho Neto. What they are
trying to do, he said in 1970, "is to
free and modernize our peoples by a
dual revolution against their tradi¬
tional structures which can no longer
serve them, and against colonial rule."
Their aim, in other words, is not
only to displace the Portuguese who
claim to rule them but to build a
new society: to found and develop
institutions of self-rule whose demo¬
cratic and modernizing vitality can
overcome not only the heritage of
foreign autocracy, but also the heri¬
tage of an older Africa divided into
small groups and rival ethnic states.
One may well think this a bold and
unexpected aim to find among peoples
so sorely ravaged and harassed by
military repression and all its accom¬
panying evils, yet this is none the less
the aim that visitors have all agreed
that they have found here.
But what does it look like on the
ground, this "forced march on the road

to cultural progress"? What you find,
obviously, differs much according to
time and place, for all this has to take
place in the midst of wars of repression
that are savagely pursued.
Some liberated areas have long
been safe from any effective enemy
intervention, and there you find the
building of a new society already far
advanced. Other areas are newly
wrested from the enemy, or subject
to frequent ground-raids and bombing
forays; there you find that the work
is often interrupted, and sometimes at
an early stage. But although the
momentary contrasts are many, the
policies and "atmosphere" are strik¬
ingly the same. All three movements
are in close touch with one another,
and have the same basic approaches.
Two examples from my own experi¬
ence. Travelling in 1970 through
areas of eastern Angola under MPLA
control, I coincided with one of the
Portuguese Army's periodical "sweeps
in force". The MPLA's fighting units
there were on the move and so, in
consequence, was the local population
that look to these units for protection.
Woodland villages were abandoned
for the time being; social services,
such as schools and medical services,
were likewise disrupted.
Weeks would pass before things
could be put together again. It was
a trying time, and bore witness to the
sufferings caused by these colonial
wars. Yet the national movement
remained in being, whether in its fight¬
ing units, its village committees, or
its co-ordinated groups of workers con¬
cerned with this or that social and
cultural activity, and could settle back
to its work again as soon as the
danger had passed.
In areas long safe from danger the
picture is a different one. Last winter
I spent some time in the Como sector
of southern Guiñé. From this sector
the Portuguese were completely evict¬
ed in 1965, and had not been able to
return. So for seven years the people
of Como had been free to work at
the building of their new society.
They had gone far towards it. Long-
established village committees, all of
them elected from local people, had
an uninterrupted responsibility toge¬
ther with the full-time workers of their
national movement, the PAIGC, for
every aspect of public affairs, educa¬
tional or medical, legal or political.
Here and elsewhere, even before
the independence of Guiñé was offi¬
cially proclaimed, a new state was
already in existence, a new society
was already taking shape, and in an
atmosphere of calm and confidence
that seemed continou'sly impressive.
Statistics can ten a little
of this story. By 1972, for example,
the PAIGC had promoted enough
schools and trained enough teachers
to give some 8,500 boys and girls the
elements of a modern education They
had even carried through a general
election for a sovereign National
Assembly by direct and secret ballot
in wide-ranging liberated areas.
Similar statistics from the liberated
areas of Angola and Mozambique can
usefully add to the picture.' It is also
clear that much more could be achiev
ed if the means were to hand, whether
in trained personnel or material neces¬
sities, and especially the second.
Yet the living reality that unfolds
before you in these plains and forests,
swamps and woodlands, goes beyond
the statistics, even very far beyond.
Whether in large liberated areas or in
small, strongly held or subject to
repeated raids and bombing, here are
"backward" people who have become
determined to win free from their
"backwardness", and to understand
the world as it really is.
These are people who are working
to achieve this by setting aside the
blinkers of tradition or subjection,
racism or "tribalism", despair or lack
of self-belief. And this they are doing
by a process of voluntary participation
in the changing of their lives and
thoughts.
No-one who travels in these areas
will come back with any impression of
utopia. Far from that, daily life is
harsh in toil and hunger or the threat
of violent death. Not everyone under¬
stands what is being attempted. Many
confusions remain, and no doubt will
do so for long to come. The timid
withdraw, the fools betray.
All things natural to the human con¬
dition are present here. Yet these
things include clarity and courage,
steadfastness and hope, while the
unrelenting growth and expansion of
these movements suggest that these
are the qualities which prevail. These
movements of renewal could not other¬
wise have gained their remarkable
success. It is a success that looks to
the rest of the world for understanding,
and so for aid and friendship.
