FROM TELEPHONE

Whose call
gets priority ?
The ITU Telephone Regula¬
tions lay down the following
priority for telephone calls:
1. Distress calls on land, sea
or in the air, and World
Health Organization calls
concerning epidemics.
2. Certain United Nations
calls.
3. Lightning Service Calls
(restoration of disrupted
telephone services).
4. Lightning Government
Calls.
5. Lightning Private Calls
(triple charge).
6. Urgent Calls (Government,
service and private, in that
order) charged at double
the normal rate.
7. Ordinary Calls.
SOS from
the cosmos
The first conference to allo¬
cate frequency bands for space
radiocommunication was organiz¬
ed by the ITU in Geneva in
1963. The conference recog¬
nized that flights by space vehi¬
cles" or manned satellites were
likely to increase and that the
search for and rescue of the
occupants and recovery of the
vehicles presented problems
similar to those of ships and air¬
craft in distress. It selected the
frequency of 20 007 kc/s for

search and rescue to augment
those already designated for
distress. It also agreed that the
conventional international dis¬
tress signal of ships and aircraft
(SOS in radiotelegraphy and
MAYDAY in radiotelephony)
should also apply for' the time
being to space vehicles.
Our 170 million
telephones
In 1954 there were 90 million
telephones in the world. Today
there are over 170 million. By
the year 2000 there will probably
be 600 million. Thus the idea
of a global telecommunication
network is now becoming a real¬
ity. To deal with the immense
problems of numbering, switch¬
ing, signalling and transmis¬
sion and to estimate the likely
growth of international traffic
and to arrange its handling and
routing, the ITU has set up a
World Telecommunication Plan
Committee. The ITU is the
world forum for discussions on
telecommunication matters, but
the operation of international
links is the concern of nation¬
al administrations and private
companies.
300.000 km/sec
is still too slow
In communications with dis¬
tant satellites (or stars) the
propagation time of radio waves
(300,000 km/sec) is of major
importance. If a relay satellite
is used for voice transmissions,
a delay of almost three-tenths of
a second occurs between the
time of speaking and the recep¬
tion of the words. In an earth-
moon link the delay is approxi¬
mately 1.3 seconds. These de¬
lays in transmission are doubled
for two-way communication.
Fortunately there are now tech¬
niques to counteract and mini¬
mize these difficulties.

Dialing anywhere
in the world
The cornerstone of the future
world-wide automatic and semi¬
automatic telephone service is a
numbering plan designed to take
care of estimated telephone
development beyond the year
2000.
The plan groups ITU member
countries into eight regional
zones and allots each country
a telephone number, the first
digit of which is the number of
its zone. These zone numbers
are: North America (1); Africa
(2); Europe (3-4); South Amer¬
ica (5). South Pacific (6); U.S.S.R.
(7); North Pacific (8); Far
East and Middle East (9). The
figure 0 is reserved as a spare
code.
To compose a complete world
number a subscriber would have
to dial between 13 and 15 digits.
For example, anyone wishing
to call ITU Headquarters in
Geneva from outside Switzer¬
land would have to dial the
following number: first the
world access code number that
connects him to his own coun¬
try's international exchange (two
or three digits); 41 (code of
country being called); 022 (Gene¬
va); 34.70.00 (ITU Headquarters
in Geneva).
Calls put through the world
network will pass through inter¬
national automatic exchanges
containing "memories" used to
store numbers being dialed.
Men to man
the networks
In many countries the effi¬
ciency of the telecommunication
network is not improving rapidly
enough to satisfy either national
or international needs. The ITU
has been working to remedy this
situation in co-operation with
the U.N. Expanded Programme
of Technical Assistance and the
Special Fund. Missions have
been sent to study special prob¬
lems and to advise govern¬
ments on communication deve¬
lopment. The ITU has organiz¬
ed training courses, sponsored
fellowships and seminars and
has supplied training and dem¬
onstration equipment. Thir¬
teen ITU-Special Fund telecom¬
munication training centres are
now operating; four more are in
the planning stage, including
one in Thailand.

satellites
Nothing can be done in the use
of outer space without the help of
radio at present the sole link be¬
tween earth and satellites. Good com¬
munications are actually more essential
for space use than for maritime or
aeronautical services. No signals mean
no information and no way of knowing
what is happening aboard a satellite.
Reduced to silence a satellite be¬
comes a mere pebble in the cosmos.
Conversely a satellite that cannot be
made to stop transmitting may take
up one or several frequencies and
interfere with other transmissions. A
garrulous satellite can be a danger as
well as a bore.
Place for space on
the radio waves
Transmissions from spacecraft can
cover wide areas because of the
altitude and orbital periods of the
space vehicle. A satellite placed in
low orbit, for example, passes regu¬
larly over the same areas, depending
on the tilt of its path. Placed in equa¬
torial orbit at an altitude of about
37,500 kilometres, it "sees" 40% of
the earth's surface throughout the 24
hours of the day. Thus in these
zones space services must be alloted
frequencies that wi.ll not interfere with
transmissions by other services.
Listening for
a feeble voice
Communication between spacecraft
and the earth is affected by distance.
Power sources on board a satellite are
relatively limited which in turn affects
the range of its transmitter. ' Because
transmissions from satellites often
reach the earth as weak signals,
ground receiving stations need special
protection against interference that
could make messages from space
inaudible.
New dimension
in communications
The. growing number of spacecraft
being launched into orbit and the
development of space programmes in
many countries create increasing
demands for new frequency allotment.
Only international agreement can save
communications with outer space from
becoming the next victims of radio
spectrum congestion and also protect
existing services from interference.
With the launching of the first satel¬
lites the ITU took up the problems of
space communications. Its vast new,
responsibilities have been formally
recognized by the United Nations
which has called the attention of all
member states "to the importance of
the action taken by the International
Telecommunications Union in the
peaceful uses of outer space."

TUNED IN TO OUTER SPACE. In this striking photograph of the
Paris Observatory's radio telescope at Nançay, France, stars
formed the myriads of white tracks as the earth turned during
the three-hour time exposure. At the centre of the circles is
the Pole Star. Radio telescopes are used by scientists to study
radio waves from outer space in the new science of radio as¬
tronomy. Since the first artificial satellites were launched in 1957
radio telescopes have also been used to track satellite flights,
because of the sensitivity and precision of their giant antenna.
