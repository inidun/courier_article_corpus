Jubilee 2000 is cited as as one of the biggest
single-issue global campaigns eve r. It is eve n
compared with the anti-apartheid movement of
the 1980s and has clearly had a more global outrea-
ch than campaigns on nuclear power or nuclear
d i s a rm a m e n t .With partner coalitions in 89 coun-
t ri e s , the initiat i ve has already exceeded its target of
collecting 22 million signatures by the end of the
year 2000.
All over the wo r l d , g ove rn m e n t s , e x p e rts and
c a m p a i g n e rs are watching Jubilee 2000’s extraor-
d i n a ry success both in mobilizing a global activist
movement and achieving demonstrable success in
pushing debt onto the agenda of the G-8 industri a l
nations and forcing the World Bank and the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the indeb-
tedness of the poorest countries. Jubilee 2000 suc-
ceeded in getting tens of thousands of people onto
the streets for the G-8 summits in Birm i n g h a m
( U K , 1998) and in Cologne (Germ a ny, 1 9 9 9 ) .
D u ring the lat t e r , finance ministers agreed in 
p rinciple to cancel $70 billion of the $130 billion
owed by the wo r l d ’s poorest nat i o n s. R i val campai-
g n e rs amongst env i r o n m e n t a l i s t s , human rights acti-
vists and trade unionists marvel at the way Jubilee
2000 has trounced those who talked pessimisti-
cally about the apathy and fatalism of civil society.
Meanwhile,some governments are seeking advice
from think tanks as to how such campaigns can see-
mingly appear from now h e r e , mobilize such force
so quickly and with so few resources.
The secret of Jubilee 2000’s success is simple
but unfa s h i o n a b l e : it is the Christian churches.T h e r e
is a polite disagreement over who first came up with
the idea of linking the Biblical concept of jubilee,
expressed in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus,
with the millennium and debt cancellat i o n .C at h o-
lics maintain the Pope spoke of it firs t ,while the UK
evangelical aid agencyTearfund claims to have ini-
t i ated the campaign’s idea in 1994.W h at is without
doubt is that both Catholics and evangelicals have
found a common purpose in the 
c a m p a i g n .Tearfund provided crucial initial funding
for the Jubilee coalition and the Pope has played a
vital role in raising the profile of the campaign in 
southern Catholic countries.
The concept of Jubilee in the Old Testament is
t h at annive rs a ries should be marked by measures
of social justice: s l aves should be freed, land and
wealth redistri buted and debts cancelled. P r ov i d i n g
a target, a date and a biblical justific ation galva n i-
zed the long-running Debt Crisis Netwo r k , a Bri t i-
sh debt cancellation campaign.
The invo l vement of the churches was crucial for
t wo reasons.Their backing brought with it millions
of churchgoers in the UK and the ready-built stru c-
ture of churches and pari s h e s , along with their publi-
c at i o n s. News could—and did—spread fa s t , a n d
Jubilee 2000 found the idea taking off as an integr a l
p a rt of the churches’ c e l e b r ation of the millennium.
Alongside plans for parish parties and fir e works wa s
debt cancellat i o n . Jubilee 2000 found itself addres-
sing church meetings up and down the country.
A winning combination
S e c o n d l y, the churches brought an intern at i o-
nal stru c t u r e .As the idea gained ground in the UK,
it began to spread through diocesan links, b e t we e n
b i s h o p s ’ conferences and via parish twinning to the
s o u t h e rn countri e s. M i s s i o n a ry societies and orders
spread the wo r d . For the first time, the churches
found their belief in solidarity with the wo r l d ’s poor
taking concrete form and direct political expression.
At times, this made the church hierarchies nervo u s ,
admit senior Jubilee 2000 staff, but they found
t h e m s e l ves swept along by the enthusiasm of the
rank and file in the pew.This was faith in action,
their pari s h i o n e rs assert e d , and it helped them make
sense and give meaning to a date in the calendar.
Jubilee 2000’s winning combination was to per-
suade aid agencies (such as Oxfam and Chri s t i a n
Aid) and the churches to work together. It wa s —
and still is—a relationship of creat i ve tension. L e f t -

Jubilee 2000:
c h u rc h e s s p re a d
the word on debt
wMadeleine Bunting
I n s p i red by the biblical concept of jubilee, a global campaign to cancel T h i rd World debt has
managed to influence the agenda of the world’s richest countries
w Senior writer for The
Guardian (UK).Ms Bunting has
overseen the newspaper’s
sponsorship and coverage of the
Jubilee 2000 campaign for
eighteen months.
For the first time,
the churches found 
their belief in solidarity 
with the world’s poor taking
c o n c rete form and 
d i rect political expre s s i o n

wing aid activists do not like working with religi o u s
institutions such as the Catholic church in Lat i n
A m e ri c a , of which certain sectors have been sup-
p o rt i ve of oppressive regi m e s. But while the aid
agencies offered expertise on debt and campaigning,
the churches provided the footsoldiers to gat h e r
s i g n at u r e s ,t u rn up at demonstrations or swamp the
UK treasury or the German embassy with post-
c a r d s. It proved a powerful combinat i o n .D e s p i t e
ri va l ries betwen aid agencies anxious to maintain
their profile and funding, the fact that a coalition of
over a hundred groups—including trade unions and
professional bodies—managed to agree on how to
tackle the gr owing inequality of the global econo-
my added immeasurably to the campaign’s 
credibility.
One other aspect of the churches’ i nvo l ve m e n t
was specific to the British campaign but had glo-
bal consequences.The Labour gouve rnment elec-
ted in 1997 had been particularly sympathetic to
the churches’ r e p r e s e n t ation in the campaign.T h i s
is partly a shrewd political move from a gove rn m e n t
anxious to extend its political base from a traditio-
nal left-wing to a centrist position, and it part l y
stems from conv i c t i o n . Both Prime Minister To ny
Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
B r own are strongly influenced by Christian socia-
l i s m .The latter took on the issue of debt as a per-
sonal commitment and has consistently pushed the
issue up on the intern ational agenda, p r oving a cru-
cial ally in chivying other finance ministers to consi-
der the issues.
What is interesting is that although many point
to Jubilee 2000 as a new form of global activism now
possible because of the Intern e t , it is again the
churches rather than new technologies which have
fuelled its deve l o p m e n t .The Jubilee 2000 we b s i t e
gets about 15,000 visitors a week, but much of the
i n f o rm ation requested has to be printed out and
sent to southern campaigners because their tele-
phone links to the net are so poor.
Advance information
Where the net has been crucial is in connecting
about 180 key activists and organizations around
the wo r l d , enabling them to share strat e gies and
i n f o rm ation to move the global campaign along.
Jubilee 2000 often received inform ation from part-
ner coalitions on debt negotiations forming in a par-
ticular country before the UK Tr e a s u ry.As a result,
when lobbying ministers , c a m p a i g n e rs were often
better informed and could outmanoeuvre them.
There has only been one assembly of all the part-
n e rs ; otherwise meetings have been rejected as
e x p e n s i ve and not ve ry productive .The effic i e n cy
of the information exchange enables a huge global
campaign to be run with only 15 full-time staff in
London supporting the entire edifice.
Jubilee 2000 is a long way from achieving its tar-
get but it has succeeded in getting a considerably
more generous debt relief initiat i ve underway. N o
o n e , t wo ye a rs ago, b e l i e ved the movement wo u l d
be able to achieve what it has. In part influenced by
the campaign, the IMF and the World Bank have
recognized for the first time that their legi t i m a cy
depends on engaging with civil society and are sho-
wing an unexpected reconsideration for some of the
p rinciples which have dri ven their policies since the
wa r. H e a rtened by this, some would claim Jubilee
2000 is a taste of global activism which might achie-
ve real change in this new century. O t h e rs wo rry
t h at with church attendance continuing to decline,
the moral imagi n ation of churchgoers which has
fuelled this campaign might become a thing of the
past and leave a gap in how to motivate people to
express their solidarity. Only time will tell. n

debt relief for the world’s poorest countries was reached.Above, a supporter of the Jubilee
