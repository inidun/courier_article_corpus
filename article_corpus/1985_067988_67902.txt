An Action Plan
for the Mediterranean
It is with regard to the Mediterranean Sea itself
and its protection that the common interest of
the countries bordering on it is greatest and
the need for their cooperation most striking. At
a meeting held in Barcelona in 1 975 under the
auspices of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), these countries adopted
a Convention for the Protection of the
Mediterranean Sea against Pollution, with
four technical protocols concerning the pre¬
vention of pollution by dumping from ships
and aircraft, the fight against pollution by hyd¬
rocarbons and other harmful substances, pro¬
tection against pollution originating on land,
and specially protected areas.
An Action Plan for the Mediterranean was
also approved. It is financed jointly by the
signatory States and by the European Econo¬
mic Community. In addition to legal activities
relating to the implementation of the Conven¬
tion and its protocols, the Action Plan includes
scientific research and monitoring pro¬
grammes relating to marine pollution as well
as economic and social planning com
ponents. The latter consist, firstly, of a pro¬
gramme of specific activities in what are
deemed to be priority areas (soil protection,
water resource management, human set¬
tlements, tourism, aquaculture and renewable
energy sources) and secondly, an exercise in
reflection and forecasting the Blue Plan
whose aim is to offer guidance for govern¬
ments according to different potential de¬
velopment scenarios.
Thus, for nearly ten years now, 1 7 of the 1 8
countries bordering on the Mediterranean,
setting aside the political differences existing
between some of them, especially in the east¬
ern Mediterranean, have jointly faced the
threat to their common environment. These
countries are Spain, France, Italy, Monaco,
Malta, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus,
the Syrian Arab Republic, Lebanon, Israel,
Egypt, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Tunisia,
Algeria and Morocco. Albania sent a delega¬
tion for the first time to the meeting of
contracting parties held at Genoa in Septem¬
ber 1985.
