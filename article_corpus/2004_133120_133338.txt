Human rights, multi-ethnic 
comprehension and a culture 
of peace figure prominently 
among the guiding principles 
set down by the Independent 
High Commission of Education 
for Afghanistan, in its final 
report recently presented to 
government of the Transitional 
Islamic State of Afghanistan.
The High Commission, 
composed of 23 experienced 
Afghan specialists in education, 
science, law and administration 
and including four women, was 
established in November 2002 
by the government in Kabul to 
draw up a blueprint for the long-
term reconstruction of of the 
country’s education system.
It recommends that all 
discriminatory , educational 
and technical constraints 
regarding the education of 
girls and women should be 
eliminated, and that measures 
be taken to provide them 
equal educational and training 
opportunities at all levels. It also 
set a minimim of eight years 
compulsory basic education 
for school-age children (7-15 
years) and recommended 
the establishment of 
basic education centres to 
provide diversified learning 
opportunities for primary 
school-age children. At 
secondary level, environmental 
studies and education for 
human rights, democracy 
and a culture of peace will 
be developed in the school 
curriculum.
