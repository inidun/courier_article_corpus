Economic value dominates everything in the West, and cinema is no exception. Made for
profit, moulded by television, most movies have become pure entertainment. The results

PARIS-BASED
CINEMA CRITIC FOR
THE International
Herald Tribune Every film-buff in Europe knows the name
of Paulo Branco,a renowned Po r t u g u e s e
producer who has worked with Manoel de
O l i v e r a , Raul Ruiz and Chantal
A c k e r m a n ,directors whose idiosyncratic
styles have helped keep independent cinema aflo a t .
B r a n c o ’s views of current American and European
cinema have become clouded with pessimism:We s-
tern cinema, he says, “has slipped into a kind of
comfort level,while filmmakers from China,Hong
Kong,Taiwan,and Korea have had to struggle and
use their imagination,which gives their films edge
and audacity.”
The dominance of economic values and the
search for prosperity in the West appears to have
deprived the region’s filmmakers of creative muscle.
In contrast, A s i a ’s political, economic and social
upheavals have bred a cultural tension reflected in
its flo u r i s h i n g,dynamic cinema.“ The culture is chan-
ging enormously,and telling stories is a way of dea-
ling with the changes,” declares Piers Handling,
director of the Toronto Fe s t i v a l .“Look at post 1917
R u s s i a ,p o s t - World War I Germany,p o s t - World Wa r
II Italy,post-1959 Cuba,post-colonial France in the
late 50s—all started producing dynamic fil m s. Th i s
energy tends to be dispersed when things are going
w e l l .H o l l y w o o d ’s Golden Age in the 30s and 40s was
largely due to a flood of talent from Europe,p e o p l e
running away from communism or fascism and fin-
ding themselves in a country full of immigrants.”
New York critic Dave Ke h r, who sits on the
selection committee of the Lincoln Center’s New
York Film Fe s t i v a l , feels the same.In his opinion, t h e
vitality of Eastern cinema may have something to do
with these countries’ resistance to post-modernist
irony and self reference.“ They take their stories and

1 . FROM WEST TO EAST
Three-dimensional cinema: today’s film-goers are plied with images and deprived of passion.

their genres seriously, whereas the West has lost
belief in the old formulas without finding anything
viable to replace them.”
But Gilles Jacob, president of the Cannes fes-
tival—which this year awarded its Golden Palm to
Danish director Lars Von Trier’s deeply northern
Dancer in the Dark and prizes to three Chinese
films and young Iranian director Samira Makh-
malbaf—remains to be convinced of such a cate-
gorical difference.“Iranian cinema is poetic, fresh.
The consecration of Asian cinema is happening
n o w,but the movement has been growing for years;
Kiarostami is almost 60.The jury’s choice, h o w e v e r,
d o e s n ’t diminish the value of other cinemas.Fr e n c h
cinema is also on the rise.”
After years of failing to recognize filmmakers
from the East,the West now seems only too ready
to welcome them with open arms.“ For years we pre-
tended we could ignore anything that wasn’t A m e-
r i c a n , E u r o p e a n , and sometimes Ja p a n e s e,” s a y s
Marco Muller, who recently left his post as director
of the Locarno festival and co-produced Makh-
m a l b a f’s B l a ck b o a rd s and Zhang Yu a n ’s S e v e n t e e n
Ye a r s. “ We all have a debt towards U. S. c i n e m a
because it’s the first syntax we were exposed to,
but now, we’re being exposed to others from Asia,
Africa and Latin A m e r i c a .The Cannes and To r o n t o
festivals established credibility for these films. It’s
not just story telling, but a different film universe
that has been shaping up in the past two decades.
Western reality desperately needed an injection of
something new and that has come from those who
have been shut out by the industry.”
In the United States, m e a n w h i l e,business values
and the power of the studios have only served to
squeeze diversity out of film production. “ I n
E u r o p e,” says Paulo Branco, “ w e ’re all indepen-
d e n t ; in A m e r i c a , even Martin Scorcese,who started
out independent,knows how to handle being recu-
perated by the system.”
Foreign films: the desperate
search for distributors
And America does not really have auteurs,Fr e n c h
producer Francesca Feder learnt in New Yo r k ’s Spa-
nish Harlem,where she made Raphael Nadjari’s T h e
S h a d e. “In A m e r i c a , you have kilos of film school
movies shown at Sundance,a festival that is like a mar-
keting machine.They look like studio movies made
with less money. Miramax buys a couple, and the
fledgling director graduates to the studio.”
Annette Insdorf, in charge of cinema studies at
Columbia University,d i s a g r e e s, remarking that des-
pite the appetite for Asian cinema, U.S. indepen-
dents flourish while films from other countries like
Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Italy and Germany that
dominated festivals in previous decades are much
less visible.“Independent films in the U. S.are being
produced in larger quantities,thanks partly to digital
video and new venues like Showtime on TV. But
foreign language films are having a harder time in
the U. S.partly because independent American fil m s
are flooding the market.”
Her view is echoed by Jacques Bidou, a Paris-
based producer who worked with Haitian Raoul
Peck on L u m u m b a and Cambodian Rithy Panh
on Un soir apres la guerre (One evening after the
w a r ) . Bidou acknowledges that independent A m e-
rican films still have the advantages of language and
a larger scope:“ The volume of American films that
invade theatres and television in Europe prevents
distribution of those made by other nations,” h e
s a y s.“ The problem is not creativity, i t ’s distribution.
We see movements in China,Ta i w a n , Japanese and
Ko r e a , countries in which national films have an
a u d i e n c e. But when the market is so small, the fil m
needs foreign distribution. Television doesn’t buy
foreign language fil m s, and distributors won’t take
the risk.”
The most visually
overwhelmed generation
Television’s strong-arm in production has cer-
tainly cut into filmmaking ambition, dictating the
nature of movies even down to the casting. Piers
Handling (director of the Toronto festival) feels
that Western cinema is now almost
totally oriented towards the market-
place and the notion of providing
entertainment. “Western audiences
have been devastated by the impact
of television—they are the most
visually overwhelmed generation in
history, so their idea of what consti-
tutes the moving image experience is
a dumbed-down version of life. To
get them to pay attention you cannot
give them small, intimate stories about real people—
too boring and underwhelming—you have to give
them sensation.”As a result,H a n d l i n g ’s Toronto fes-
t i v a l ,which is non-competitive,has picked up on new
trends in world cinema and drawn films from cul-
tures that he argues “are not yet media-saturated,
that still have a literary or verbal culture, such as Iran
and China, and are making the best films in the
world.”
Yet hope remains for the Western film industry,
argues Gilles Ja c o b, insisting that there is still
money to make more challenging movies.“ C i n e m a
is always in the red, globally speaking,” he says,
“ We have to put fresh money into the system and
we need new people, like Francis Bouygues, w h o
launched Ciby 2000.” Over the past few years, C i b y
2000—a French production company—has co-pro-
duced films by David Ly n c h , Quentin Ta r a n t i n o
and Pedro A l m o d o v a r.The international trend for
French producers has developed even further:
Humbert Balsan produces Egyptian Youssef Cha-
hine and Yousri Nasrallah, as well as Sandrine
Ve y s s e t ; Marin Karmitz produces American inde-
pendent Johnathan Nossiter and Austrian Michael
H a n e k e ; while Michel Propper produced Israeli
Amos Gitai and Peter Brook of Britain. Wi t h
several critical and commercial successes under
its belt, c i n e m a ’s alternative globalization appears
well underway. ■
