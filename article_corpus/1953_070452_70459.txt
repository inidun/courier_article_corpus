"Pantagruel"which along with
other similar celebrated works either
make lengthy references to chess or
devote entire chapters to it.
Such an abundant production
clearly illustrates the richness and
variety of the game. As chess en-
thusiasts know full well the 20, 000
books already published are like a
drop of water in the ocean of chess
science and literally millions of
books could be written-and perhaps
will be-before human beings will
have exhausted all the questions
relative to the theory and practice
of the art and science of chess.
Today several hundred monthly
revues not only publish news of the
chess world but in particular give
accounts of recent games between
famous players and make known
new developments in theoretical
chess research, all of which provides
fascinating material for students of
the game.
As a matter of fact these games
reflect very accurately the charac-
ters, tempera-
ments and
personalities
of the famous
players and
they also
express the
artistic and
social trends
of the times
in which they
are played.
Chess has had
its classical,
romantic and
modern
schools and
our own times
Europe's oldest chess illustration (1283)
now in the EI Escorial Library, in Spain.
Second World War, that of George
Allen (now incorporated in the Lib-
rary of Philadelphia), of the one
owned by Bledow (now combined
with the Berlin Library) and the
library of G. B. Fraser.
Van der Linde's own collection was
bought in 1876 by the Royal Library
at the Hague for the sum of 3, 000
florins, the equivalent of £1, 200 at
present values.
The collection of Rimington Wil-
son (2, 310 volumes) included, in
addition to printed works and incu-
nabula, many extremely valuable
manuscripts. One of these was a
copy of the Cessoles manuscript,
referred to above, dating from 1466.
This library was put up for auction
in London in 1928 and Bernard
Quaritch, a firm dealing in ancient
books, acquired most of the works.
Vida's poem, translated into English
verse by Oliver Goldsmith-a manu-
script written entirely in the Eng-
lish author's hand-was sold for
not.
The largest
of all chess
libraries was
that of John
G ri swold-
White, a
lawyer of Cle-
veland, in the
United States,
who died in
1928 at the
age of 83. He
spent more
than 60 years
assembling a
collection 0 f
12, 000 volumes
which includ-
have produced theorists of impres-
sionist, cubist and surrealist chess.
It is thus easy to see how enthu-
siasm has led so many chess lovers
to make collections of ancient and
contemporary books. The first
systematic study on this question
was the work of Dr. A. van der
Linde. This first-rate player pro-
duced the first, and already very
complete, bibliography on works
published up to his time (Gesc/ncTe
und Literatur des Schachspiels, Ber-
lin, 1874).
In addition to the Rimington
Wilson collection and his own, van
der Linde refers to several other
large chess libraries of the middle
19th century. In particular he
speaks of the collection of R. Franz,
which was broken up ; that of van
Heydebrand von der Las. a, which
was in Poland at the outbreak of the
ed some items of inestimable worth
on the game of chess. He bequeath-
ed his collection to the city of
Cleveland which now, therefore, pos-
sesses the largest public chess libra-
ry in the world.
Other public chess libraries which
came into existence in a similar
way include that of Princeton
University in the United States
which was founded on the collection
of 2, 000 volumes-some of them
extremely rare-which formed the
collection of'E. B. Cook, and that of
the Municipal Library of Grenoble,
France, which, since 1856 has
possessed a fine collection inherited
from Frédéric Alliey.
The most remarkable of existing
private chess libraries is undoubtedly
that of a Dutchman, Dr. Niemeyer,
of Wassenaar, near The Hague.
Among its 4, 000 volumes is a first
edition of Damiano's treatise of
which only three copies now exist (1)
as well as a first edition (1749) of
Philidore's famous work,"L'Analyse",
the first really rational work on
chess. Although, in addition to his
mother tongue, M. Niemeyer speaks
English, German, French, Italian,
Spanish, Greek, Latin and several
other languages, he still needs the
help of a translator in order to read
some of his books for they include
texts in many Slav languages, in
Arabic, Yiddish, Chinese, Japanese,
Icelandic, as well as in such dialects
as Telegu, Urdu and many others.
To be able to replay all the moves
in a game it is not necessary
to know the language in which
the book describing the game is
published. Chess notation is in-
ternational. and so it is easy for a
player in any country to follow the
performances of champions of other
nationalities.
Dr. Niemeyer's library,. however, is
only one part of his chess collections.
He has many varied and precious
items which evoke the history of
chess, prints, engravings, autographs
and chess sets.
Before the outbreak of the Second
World War two other chess libraries
were often referred to-those of
Harald Folk and Albrecht Buschke.
The first of these collectors disap-
peared during the conflict, and the
second is now living in New York.
The author of this article has a
library comprising more than 1, 600
works.
To deal adequately with the sub-
ject of collections of chessmen and
chess sets would require a separate
article. Some of these items have
great historic importance. The Bib-
liotheque Nationale in Paris, for
instance, possesses a few chessmen
from the ivory set given to Charle-
magne by the Em-
peror of Byzan-
tium. Visitors to
one Paris museum.
the Musée de Clu-
ny, can admire a
magnificent chess-
board of cedar
with chessmen car-
ved in quartz and
mounted on silver-
gilt which were
offered to St. Louis
by the Prince of
the Bedouin.
These ancient
chess sets com-
mand high prices.

dia before the fifth century A. D. in
which four players used a pattern
of 64 squares, that chess, as we
know it today, was evolved.
From India chess was introduced
into Persia in the 6th century during
the reign of Chosroes the First and
immediately became extremely pop-
ular. In"Shahname" (The Book
of Kings) a history of Persia written
in verse by the celebrated poet Fir-
dousi, there are two chapters des-
cribing and praising the game.
While new cultural currents were
taking chess from India to China
and later to Korea and Japan in the
East, and from Iran to Russia and
Scandinavia in the West, the Arabs
conquered Persia and were quick to
adopt the game. So it was under
the banners of Islam that the noble
game was introduced first into
Spain from where it spread to all the
Mediterranean countries of Europe.
Towards the XIIIth century when
it had conquered practically the
whole of Europe, the game of chess
acquired its present form, and it is
from this period that the beginnings
of a vast flood of writing exclusively
about chess can be dated. The
oldest known European manuscript
on the subject, that of Jacobus de
Cessole which was written around
1200 A. D., contains just a few refer-
ences to the game. The writing of
books on the subject of chess which
has progressively increased down the
centuries was really inaugurated by
two other manuscripts-that of King
Alfonso of Castille (1252-1284), now
kept in Madrid, and the celebrated
work known as the"Bonus Socius"
(circa 1286) the principal copy of
which is now preserved in Florence.
Today there are more than 20, 000
works on chess. There are also
many others like the already men-
tioned Book of Kings and Rabelais'

International by its system of notation and its universal popularity, chess is a cultural activity combining unaerstanding and friendly rivalry. (COI Photo).
dating from the 10th century was
purchased by the American Art
Galleries, New York, for $7,000 in
1927. Today the most famous col-
lections are those of Mr. Liddell, in
New York and of M. J. Maunoury, in
Paris.
Chess is an international game
which because of its system of
notation enables enthusiasts in all
countries to follow its development
throughout the world. It is also
international because it has spread
to every continent creating links
between Europe and the remote
islands of the Pacific and between
equatorial forests and polar regions,
and today it provides an example of
one of the few cultural activities in
which broad understanding and
friendly rivalry prevails.
The International Chess Fede-
ration (FIDE) includes practically
every country in the world. At its
congress, held in Copenhagen in 1950,
its president Folke Regard, could
rightly say :"We may hold different
political conceptions, but in our in-
ternational chess activities we are
not subject to any political pre-
judices. Between the chess players
of the world there also exists a deep
friendship that is completely free
from all political conceptions and
ideologies. We are convinced that
in reality the same friendship exists
between all men.
"We hope that the leaders of all
countries will realise that the
greatest desire of their people is for
peace in their own time and security
for future generations, and that the
leaders can meet in the same spirit
as that which presides at the
meetings of players and organizers
of chess games."
The chess sets and the chess
pieces which are reproduced on
these two pages and on the last page
of the Courier are taken from the
magnificent collection obtained by
M. Jean Maunoury, of France, from
almost every country in the world.
The photographs of these objects
are printed here with the kind per-
mission of M. Maunoury. His col-
lection is one of the most famous
of its kind in existence in the world.
