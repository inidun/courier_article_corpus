On the tra c k s
of a global vice
Corruption may be as old as government, but rapid globalization has given it alarming new
dimensions. For the United Nations, the scourge has become a top priority, although so far, the battle
is being waged in thick fog
ublic corruption is a crime as old as
government itself. In the fifth century
B C, Plato talked about it in his L a w s.
Two centuries later, the Indian political
reformer Kautilya1 listed 40 temptations
that civil servants might yield to. But the
state of corruption today is
unprecedented in at least two respects:
scandals are erupting the world over,
and  people are no longer in the mood to
tolerate them.
In less than a year, two sitting
p r e s i d e n t s — Joseph Estrada in the
Philippines and Alberto Fujimori in
Peru—have been forced to resign, w h i l e
a former president—Carlos Menem of
Argentina—has been put under house
a r r e s t . In each case, the main legal
charges and the immediate public outcry
against them involved corruption.
Something that until recently was
seen as just an internal government affair
has become an explicit priority for all
international bodies, from the G-8
nations and the World Bank to the
United Nations, which plans to draft an
anti-corruption convention by 2002.Th i s
surge of activity reflects various concerns,
but has been fed by a single process:
globalization.
The first “ m a n d a t e ” on corruption
received by international bodies has
come from governments themselves.

Economic austerity has fuelled the fight against corruption in many countries:here a march in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Twenty years of ever-faster fin a n c i a l
t r a n s a c t i o n s, spurred by deregulation
and the rise of electronic
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s, has turned money
gained from criminal activities into a
source of political and financial
i n s t a b i l i t y. And money embezzled
through corruption has gone hand-in-
hand with the money made by organized
crime.
“These two kinds of crime feed off
each other, hiding and recycling their
p r o fits in the same way,” says Daniel
D o m m e l , president of the French branch
of the NGO Tr a n s p a r e n cy International.
“ To stay out of sight, organized crime
uses corruption, which weakens
institutional safeguards against such
criminals.”
In recent years, several scandals have
revealed the extent of the scourge. I n
the summer of 1998, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) lent Russia eight
billion dollars to stave off the collapse of
the ruble. Benyamin Sokolov, Russia’s
chief auditor, told a BBC interviewer in
November that year:“We have looked
into what happened to some of the IMF
money and we have to admit that several
billion dollars did not go to the
programmes they were earmarked for.
Some of it was simply stolen.”
The following summer, the biggest
money-laundering scandal in U. S. h i s t o r y
erupted,with the Bank of New York at
its centre. According to the FBI, t h e
Russian mafia used this venerable
financial institution to funnel $10 billion
back into the Russian economy after its
passage through the tiny Pacific island-
state of Nauru, famous for “offshore”
banks that ask few questions of their
customers.
“ Forty years ago, just one place in the
w o r l d , S w i t z e r l a n d , guaranteed secrecy
for its banking clients, but today there
are more than 50 such countries,” s a y s
Yves Mény, head of the Robert
Schumann Centre at the European
University Institute in Florence and
author of Democracy and Corruption in
E u r o p e ( C a s s e l l , L o n d o n , 1 9 9 6 ) .
Monitoring financial movements,
particularly through tax havens, is now
one of the main features of the battle
against corruption.
An annual
blacklist
The Financial Action Task Force on
Money Laundering (FAT F ) , which grew
out of meetings of the G-8 countries and
is based at the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), has since 2000
published an annual blacklist of the most
financially suspect countries, sending a
sharp jolt through the genteel world of
international finance.
“ We want to get all banking centres,
including the least willing, to conform
to international standards,” says FATF
executive secretary Patrick Moulette.
“ We ’re exerting constructive pressure
on all of them, whether they’re tax
havens like the Marshall Islands,
Dominica and Nauru,or countries such
as Egypt, I s r a e l , Lebanon and Russia.
Note that we’re removing Russia from
our blacklist of 17 countries because it
passed a law this summer imposing
tighter controls on its banking system.”
Economic interests are also pressing
international organizations to crack
down on corruption. But not for moral
r e a s o n s. Firms operating in the
international arena—from construction
to water supplies—are horrified by the
demands for ever-bigger kickbacks.
The bribing game
“Economic liberalization has sent
the cost of bribes skyrocketing, but few
have noticed,” says Rob Je n k i n s, w h o
teaches political science at Birbeck
College (London).“During public sector
p r i v a t i z a t i o n , prospective buyers fig h t
each other to bribe politicians and civil
s e r v a n t s. And with each new reform,
firms that want to have a say in drafting
the new rules or simply want to know
what the rules will be,are forced to make
pay-offs without getting any guarantees
in return.I ’ve seen that in every country
where I’ve looked at economic reform—
in India,South Africa and Uganda.It is
ironic that in the early 1980s, the IMF
and the World Bank promised that their
liberalization programmes would reduce
the power of bureaucracy and thereby
stamp out the source of corruption.”
To eradicate this kind of crime, the
OECD in 1997 drew up a Convention
on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
Officials in International Business
Transactions, which has been signed so
far by 33 countries. “Its main point is
s i m p l e,”explains Dommel.“It bans fir m s
in the signatory states from paying
kickbacks to foreign offic i a l s. Until a
few years ago, such “ c o m m i s s i o n s ”w e r e
tolerated in many countries. In France,
for example, they were officially tax-
d e d u c t i b l e. It was compared to going to

confession in church.”
The Convention’s many critics say it
is a step in the right direction, but far
from enough. “It seems absurd to
condemn bribing an official of a
government-owned airline and then shut
your eyes to a kickback paid to an offic i a l
of a private one,” says Stuart Eizenstat,
former U.S. under-secretary of state in
the Clinton administration.
His comments are especially
pertinent at a time when the economic
fashion is to privatize public services.
Benoît Dejemeppe, a state prosecutor
in Brussels and a corruption expert,
notes that the OECD convention is
largely based on the Foreign Corrupt
Practices A c t , which U. S. P r e s i d e n t
Jimmy Carter pushed through Congress
in 1977 in the wake of the Lockheed
bribery scandal that rocked governments
in Europe and Japan.“In over 20 years,
only four major corruption scandals have
led to criminal convictions,”he says,“ s o
I conclude the law isn’t strict enough.”
A third “ m a n d a t e ” a g a i n s t
corruption comes from civil society,
which has shown increasing concern
about the murky relationship between
politics and money. “In the process of
worldwide ‘quasi-democratization’ and
global access to information,what people
want above all else is transparency,”s a y s
Jenkins.
Eluding all
control
Until the end of the Cold War, the
major political movements upheld
widely contrasting ideologies;how they
were financed was seen as less important.
To d a y, in contrast, institutional political
debate boils down to minor differences
over how to apply broadly similar
economic programmes, all requiring big
sacrifices by most of the population.So
it is no accident that anti-corruption
campaigners have emerged at the same
time as economic austerity in Western
E u r o p e,financial crises in Southeast A s i a
and Latin A m e r i c a , and structural
adjustment programmes in many poor
countries.
But the slowness of the anti-
corruption process, the problems
investigators come up against as they
try to trace international networks, the
rarity and lightness of the penalties—
all have helped in fostering a good dose
of  cy n i c i s m . French journalist Denis
Robert has published several books
about corruption scandals. His latest,
(R é v é l a t i o n $) written with Ernest
Baeckes, is about how a Luxembourg-
based clearinghouse called Clearstream
o p e r a t e s. Such institutions are vital to
the business of banking since they
catalogue all transactions and list the
people who make them. Th e y
nevertheless encourage anonymity and
elude all control.
An insult to the poor
“ The very word ‘ c o r r u p t i o n ,’ if it
means a departure from the legal rules,
is no longer appropriate,” says Robert.
“It’s the system that’s corrupt.And the
institutions never react until long
a f t e r w a r d s. As Spanish judge Baltasar
Garzón said, the fight against corruption
is a fight between a mammoth and a
leopard.”
The battle is not only uneven but is
being waged in thick fog according to
five European judges, all anti-corruption
e x p e r t s, who wrote an article in the
French daily Le Monde last May, soon
after Robert’s book came out.“ The main
thing that emerges from this
i n v e s t i g a t i o n ,” they wrote, “is the
deafening silence of those responsible for
the system that is in the dock.… Th e
tactic of hiding one’s head in the sand
might suggest that the book was a
pointless exercise. But we think that it’s
only just started to tell the true story.…
The book should help Europeans
understand what clearinghouses do and
throw new light on the globalization of
finance.”
The effectiveness of different ways to
fight corruption is still being debated.
But everyone at least agrees on what
the enemy is. Even James Wolfensohn,
the Australian president of the Wo r l d
B a n k , raised the then taboo subject
inside the Bank in 1996. He called
corruption a serious “ c a n c e r ” t h a t
“insulted the poorest people by diverting
money to the richest.” ■
