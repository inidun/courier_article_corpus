With a rapidly aging population and a huge
p r o p o rtion of its elderly people opting for
early retirement, Finland is facing the
prospect of unprecedented labour short a g e .T h e
r ate of greying in Finland is faster than in other
European Union countries and the number of
young wo r k e rs replacing the retiring elders is not
p r o p o rt i o n at e .
The average age of the Finnish population is on
the rise owing partly to changes in the age groups
and partly to the increased life expectancy rat e .
To d ay the elderly constitute 15 per cent of the total
population of around five million.This reflects the
fact that Finland witnessed a higher birth rate than
a ny other country during the We s t ’s post-World Wa r
II baby boom.
Though the stat u t o ry retirement age is 65 ye a rs ,
80 per cent of the population retire before they
reach 60 years of age.Carin Lindqvist-Virtanen, a
senior researcher at the Ministry of Social Affairs,
Helsinki,says that if the present trend to take early
retirement continues “then it will cause seri o u s
problems for the labour market in the future as not
m a ny young people will be there to replace the
r e t i ring wo r k e rs. The massive exodus [into
retirement] could also weaken the financial position
of the pension scheme.”
Among Finnish men, p a rt i c i p ation in the labour
market for the 55-59 group is among the lowest of
the Organization of Economic Co-operation and
D e velopment (OECD) countri e s. One main reason

Finland’s baby-boomers are taking early retirement and there aren’t enough
youngsters to replace them 
for this deve l o p m e n t , analysts say, has been the
g ove rn m e n t ’s encouragement of early retirement
during the economic recession of the early 1990s.
This included favourable options like handsome
pension and unemployment benefits allow i n g
people to retire comfortably at the age of 55.
Age discri m i n ation has been cited by social
scientists as another factor leading employees to
take early retirement. According to a report by
F i n l a n d ’s National Committee on A ging policy,
elderly people are subject to discri m i n ation and
receive degrading treatment.“The elderly are still
frequently treated as economically non-productive
p e o p l e , a care burden or encumbrance and a
medical problem,” it says.
The government has also been discussing the
possibility of raising the retirement age to 67 years
to tackle the labour shortage problem. H owe ve r ,
critics argue that there is little point in doing that
until more people can be encouraged to work up to
the statutory retirement age of 65 years.
The Finnish government last year launched a
five-year programme to stop age discrimination in
the wo r k p l a c e .Annikki Korhonen, senior Adviser at
the National Research and Development Centre
for We l fare and Health, s ays that this Nat i o n a l
P r o gramme for A ging Wo r k e rs (NPAW) seeks to
i n i t i ate a change in attitude which will help improve
the position of aging wo r k e rs and reduce the exodus
of labour. ■
