The Shuar are an indigenous people of the Ecua-
d o rian A m a z o n .Long known to the outside wo r l d
as the Jiva r o, their tough, independent character
and their legendary technique of shrinking human
heads have been described by many trave l l e rs and mis-
s i o n a ri e s.They proudly claim that they have never been
c o n q u e r e d .N ow these one-time hunters and gat h e-
r e rs ,who turned to rearing cat t l e , gr owing citrus fru i t
or practicing traditional horticulture deep in the A m a-
zonian forest,h ave taken a route into the modern wo r l d
t h at enables them to keep their language and culture.
Salesian Catholic priests who came to the
region to convert the indigenous people to Chris-
tianity witnessed the land seizures, settler bru t a l i t y
and other injustices of which the Shuar were vic-
t i m s.They answered their appeal for help by streng-
thening the cohesion of Shuar society and culture
so that they could meet the challenges of rampant
greed and modernization.
In 1964, the priests helped the Shuar to shape
their destiny by setting up the Federation of Shuar
C e n t r e s , the first autonomous organization of its
kind in Latin America.A precursor of the indige-
nous Indian movement which became an impor-
tant political force in Ecuador in the 1990s, t h e
f e d e r ation became to all intents and purposes a
Shuar state within the Ecuadorian state. Its man-
date covered everything from land distribution to
the administration of health and education serv i c e s.
Bilingual schooling by radio
The main agent of this limited autonomous inte-
gr ation was the Bi-cultural Shuar Radio Educat i o n
System (SERBISH). Radio proved to be the most
suitable means of communication in the inaccessible
r e gion of dense forests and impenetrable mountains
where the Shuar live .A radio education scheme using
Shuara and Spanish began in 1968 and four ye a rs
l ater officially became the backbone of the bilingual
schools which had recently been set up.
The chief purpose of bilingual and bicultural
e d u c ation was to teach people Spanish so they
could demand equal treatment as Ecuadorian citi-
zens and to enable Shuara to become a vibrant
m o d e rn language. Shuar families were enthusiastic
from the start about a system which did not require
them to send their children away to austere Salesian
boarding schools where they would be cut off from
their environment and culture. Making bilingua-
lism acceptable meant Shuar children no longer
needed to be ashamed of speaking their own lan-
guage.
SERBISH started out with 33 schools.Within
two years it was broadcasting to 120 and numbers
have been rising ever since. Today, it reaches four
p r ovinces of eastern Ecuador, and provides educa-
tion for about 7,500 children—out of a Shuar
p o p u l ation of 70,000—in 297 schools teaching
from primary to the end of the secondary level.
Linguistic pioneers
The ministry of education has authorized the
work of “tele-auxiliaries”, Shuar teachers paid by
the government or local volunteers who receive a
wage for helping children to listen and learn from
the radio programmes while the teacher attends to
pupils at another grade.
The school system comprises a national curri c u-
lum which prepares children for official exams in Spa-
nish and another which teaches a course in Shuar lan-
guage and culture. At firs t , the courses kept close to
the national curri c u l u m , including its religious bias
due to the Salesians’ i n flu e n c e .To d ay cours e wo r k
focuses more on the traditional Shuar wo r l d - v i e w,
and includes components on folklore,craft techniques
and local plant and animal life as well as lessons to
prepare children for modern life. In addition to a
s e c o n d a ry school diploma in Intercultural Bilingual
E d u c ation (EIB) and in chemistry and biology, S E R-
BISH has for the past year offered one in fa rming tech-
n o l o g y, including sustainable use of resources.
The Shuar are rightly proud of being pioneers,
not just in Ecuador but wo r l d w i d e , and are not
deterred by the current serious problems of their
c o u n t ry, c rushed by heavy foreign debt, m a s s i ve
financial crisis and a plan to make the U.S. dollar
the national curr e n cy which may have gr ave conse-
quences for the poorest Ecuadorians.
The Shuar Fe d e r at i o n ’s radio equipment has not
been updated since the 1960s, which means recep-
tion is poor in some remote communities. A gr e e-
ments were signed last year with foreign aid institu-
tions including Germ a ny ’s GTZ, which topped up
the meagre funding from the Ecuadorian ministry of
e d u c at i o n .M a ny teachers , who earn just over $40 a
m o n t h , cannot travel to the remotest communities,
which can only be reached by small plane.

The Shuar people of the Ecuadorian Amazon have turned their language into a powerful tool
to safeguard their autonomy and cultural identity

determined Shuar. Relying on their organizational
strength,they now have some very ambitious pro-
jects, incljuding one for an educational television
s t at i o n , for which they are seeking foreign technical
assistance and funding.
In the search for an altern at i ve to modern i z at i o n
imposed from above, the Shuar have managed to
reduce semi-illiteracy to seven per cent and total
illiteracy to two per cent.With the self-confidence
his people are famous for, G u i l l e rmo Sensu, head of

faith in the future.“I can assure you we’re going to
fight for our rights to education,” he says.
In Ecuador, where a third of the populat i o n
speaks one or more indigenous languages, people
had to wait until the new 1998 Constitution for
f o rmal recognition that “ For the indigenous
peoples, Quechua, Shuara and other ancient lan-
guages are officially used.”
French linguist Louis-Jean Calvet notes that
Shuar linguistic policy is atypical because it is com-
pletely independent of the state.“As a policy for a
minority, decided by them and applied by them,it
shows how the expansion of the world’s steadily-
gr owing language empires is not inevitable and that
it is possible to fight to be different in a world that ’s
