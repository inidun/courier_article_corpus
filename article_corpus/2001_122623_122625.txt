Toxic rain kills
m o re than the coca
The so-called “war on coca” in Colombia, backed by the United States, is destroying jungles and
forests, and threatening the health of half a million peasants and indigenous peoples
t frst sight, a coca leaf is nothing more
than an ordinary light-green leaf that
grows on a rather ugly bush.But if you
hold one up to the light,it turns yellow
and a system of veins appears that seems
to carry a substance towards the centre.
This is the narcotic over which 15,000
leftist guerrillas and 8,000 far- r i g h t
paramilitary troops are fighting in
C o l o m b i a . Each side’s secret military
structure rests on the underground
economy of growing and refining coca
l e a v e s. Drug trafficking has set off a war
in Colombia just as diamonds have in
Sierra Leone.
Over the last 15 years, t r a f ficking has
turned Colombia into a top national
security issue for the United States, the
world’s largest consumer of cocaine.As
such, the U.S. has a direct influence on
Colombia’s fight against drugs through
hefty budgets, military hardware and
other aid, along with the threat of
political and economic sanctions.
American involvement has increased to
the point that the so-called Colombia
Plan,the main programme of President
Andres Pastrana’s government, n o w
receives $1.3 billion in U.S. aid.
According to Pastrana’s reasoning, i f
all the coca planted in the country is
d e s t r o y e d , there will be no money left to
fight the war, allowing peace to be
negotiated with the outlawed groups.
No more cocaine would be sold on the
streets of American cities. Washington
supports this scenario. To achieve the
goal within five years,a military offensive
was drawn up, including the creation of
three anti-drug battalions and a fleet of
planes to spray the plants with a poison
called glyphosate.
Is this a good thing? Environmental
NGOs such as Acción Andina see it as a
scorched-earth policy and the European
Union criticizes the programme because
it provides no long-term solution for the
survival of communities that live off
growing coca. The government says at
least half a million people—450,000
peasants and 50,000 indigenous people—
depend directly on the crop for their
l i v e l i h o o d . Yet last December, t h e
authorities began large-scale secret
spraying of coca plantations with
g l y p h o s a t e, a pink liquid herbicide used
against all crop diseases.
A desolate
scene
Colombian officials from the
antinarcotics directorate of the national
police say 30,000 hectares of coca were
sprayed with the poison last Ja n u a r y.
Glyphosate has been used since 1984 to
kill marijuana plants.A decade later, t h e
government authorized its use in the
Andean highlands to eradicate a violet
poppy whose buds produce a thick white
liquid that forms the rubbery substance
from which opium, morphine and heroin
are refined.
Although glyphosate is banned in
several U. S. s t a t e s, including Florida,
where it was rejected as a way to
eradicate marijuana plants in the
Everglades region “because of its unclear
effects on the environment,” t h e
Colombian authorities cited research
funded by the country’s national farming
institute that ensures the chemical does
not pose a health risk to humans and is
o n l y slightly toxic for animals and plants.
To appease the growing chorus of
A Colombian national police plane sprays poppy crops in the state of Huila.

c r i t i c i s m , the authorities promised to
implement an environmental
management plan that would limit use of
the chemical to destroying illegal plants,
without harming the rest of the
environment or people. Six years later,
this plan remains a draft document on
the desk of environment minister Juan
M a y r. M e a n w h i l e, the poisonous rain
has now been sprayed over more than
300,000 hectares of jungle and forest.
National watchdog bodies such as
the office of the ombudsman have since
shown that glyphosate causes irreparable
harm to people and the environment
wherever it is used. The ombudsman’s
most recent study
was of the Colombia
P l a n ’s launch in
Putumayo province,
which borders
Ecuador and where
half the country’s
coca is grown.
R e p r e s e n t a t i v e s
of four indigenous
c o m m u n i t i e s
protested last
January 11 against
the damage
glyphosate had done to their staple crops
( m a i z e, b a n a n a s, manioc and other
v e g e t a b l e s ) , their health and the lives of
their animals. A delegation from the
ombudsman’s office, along with experts
from the UN High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR), visited the area
between January 15 and 25 and reported
on what they described as a “desolate
scene.”There had been “indiscriminate
destruction of the jungle, legal crops,
medicinal plants and fis h - p o n d s.There is
clear evidence that wildlife has fled,
rivers are contaminated and production
in the region has fallen.”
Skin and gastro-intestinal problems,
f e v e r s, h e a d a c h e s, n a u s e a , colds and
vomiting were common among the
inhabitants, the mission observed. The
police and the national anti-narcotics
a u t h o r i t y, which are in charge of the
s p r a y i n g, argue that the herbicide is
dropped very accurately thanks to
satellite imagery and aerial photography
that pinpoint the exact location of the
coca plantations. But wind and the
weather means that the chemical can
overshoot the fields by up to 150 m e t r e s,
the ombudsman said.
The social consequences of this are
h u g e.Villages have been abandoned and
about 20,000 people have fled their land
in the face of the military campaign
against coca.Anticipating the arrival of
refugees, the UNHCR set up camps in
the border area of Lake Agrio (Ecuador)
halfway through 2000.“The evidence is
s t r o n g, so we’re calling for an immediate
halt to the spraying and for the
compensation of the victims whose
livelihoods are seriously threatened,”
says ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes.
There is  no effective coordination, he
o b s e r v e s, between the various state
bodies involved in the government’s
anti-drug campaign
and those whose job
it is to protect the
environment.
Peasants like
Aicardo Loaiza
have to live in the
35-degree heat of
the coca plantations
and under the
constant threat of
the guerrillas, t h e
paramilitaries and
the crop-spraying
planes. L o a i z a ,4 8 , came to Putumayo in
1968 drawn by fortunes to be made out of
rice growing. To d a y, he has a wife, 1 3
children and has had enough of growing
coca “for the big shots.” He lives in the
Santana district and is trying to persuade
500 of his neighbours that the only
solution is to sign an agreement with the
government to pull up the coca plants by
hand themselves in exchange for an end
to spraying and subsidies to grow legal
c r o p s.
“Look at us. We ’re the embittered
children of this damn coca thing,” h e
says. “We’ve been doing it for 20 or 30
y e a r s. I t ’s left some of us ruined and
others in jail or in the cemetery.” He has
the hands of an expert coca gatherer, a
r a s p a ch í n, as the drug traffickers call
them,and they were the first to sign an
accord with the government to destroy
the coca plants “voluntarily and not
under threat of the poison.”For Loaiza,
this is the only solution.
In recent months, 5,000 families—
small-time growers with no more than
10 hectares of coca—have chosen this
path.These are people who harvest the
leaves between three and six times a
y e a r,pack them in bags and take them by
river to the nearest processing plant.
Amid or alongside the coca bushes, t h e y
grow bananas, manioc, maize, fruit and
medicinal plants. If these crops are

sprayed from the air, t h e
families’ lives are destroyed in
one stroke.
The agreements signed by
the farmers stipulate that they
must uproot all their coca
plants within a year in
exchange for being included
in alternative development
s c h e m e s. The deal works in
L o a i z a ’s village, where a
factory to process palm-oil
and fruit has been set up to
enable the villagers who carry
out the deal to earn a living.
This would seem to be the
ideal solution for getting rid
of coca without further
damaging the eco-system, at
least in the eyes of peasants
and environmental
organizations. But the funds
set aside in the Colombia Plan
for such alternative
development are small
compared with the amount
for military operations and
s p r a y i n g.The U. S. is supplying
only $300 million for social
and economic substitution
compared with $1 billion for
military purposes.
A new strategy?
Another obstacle to the agreements
with the peasants is that they do not
attract the big-time coca growers, those
who have 100 hectares or more planted,
with hidden arsenals to protect them.
Gonzalo de Fr a n c i s c o, an aide to
President Pastrana, runs the Colombia
Plan in Putumayo province. Th e r e, h e
s a y s,“the government has no choice but
to use military means and aerial
spraying.”
The head of the national anti-
narcotics authority, Gabriel Merchán,
told the UN E S C O C o u r i e r that “the drug-
t r a f fickers are the ones who damage the
environment and nobody protests
against that.The arguments are all about
condemning the use of glyphosate
despite the fact we’ve used it in
accordance with national law and
international rules.” E n v i r o n m e n t
minister Juan Mayr agrees, and both
men insist the “drug traffickers have
deforested 600,000 hectares of jungle
and forest land and use 75 chemicals
more poisonous than glyphosate.”
Tomás León Sicard, a Colombian
National University researcher and
expert on the environment and
d e v e l o p m e n t , thinks the parties involved
should stop being politicians for a
moment and get to the heart of the
matter. This is urgent, he says, because
the fighting is taking place in very fragile
and biologically diverse rural eco-
systems, such as Amazonia. He calls on
the combatants to save them since “ t h e r e
is enough room for everyone on land in
the agricultural regions.”
Implementation of the Colombia
P l a n , massive spraying and peasant
protests have spurred the
environmentalists to
i n t e r v e n e. After a lot of
p r e s s u r e, the U. S. S t a t e
Department recently
admitted for the first time that
“errors” were perhaps being
made in the spraying
operations and that a new
eradication strategy might be
considered if an effective one
could be found.
Court action
For the time being, t h e
figures used by the anti-
narcotics officials themselves
show that the more land is
s p r a y e d , the more new land
is planted with coca. Th e
plantations simply move from
one province to another
because the conditions for
growing it are still all there—
p o v e r t y, u n e m p l o y m e n t ,
absence of the state, s o c i a l
conflict and a growing
demand for cocaine from
foreign markets.
In these circumstances,o n e
non-repressive solution is the
l a w. Environmental lawyers
Claudia Sampedro and Héctor
Suárez have persuaded a Colombian
administrative court to allow a demand
from a grassroots group for the
government to take responsibility for the
damage the spraying has done to the
environment and to people.
“ For the first time,Colombian society
is using the law to check that the
government respects the environment,
not just by recognizing the damage
caused,but by suspending the spraying
and taking preventive measures,” s a y s
S a m p e d r o, an expert in international
environmental law.
How can the authorities have been
spraying for more than 15 years without
taking any steps to protect the
environment? Who will take
responsibility for that and for the
irreversible damage that has been done?
The court will try to answer that very
soon because the debate is moving onto

“The drug traffickers
are the ones who
damage the 
environment and
nobody protests 
against that.”
