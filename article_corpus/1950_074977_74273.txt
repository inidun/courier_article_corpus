PIOIJGHSDARES DAVE REPLACE
RIFLES ! N THE SAHARA
FORT ABADLA (Latitude 31"N.
lo"gitude 0'50"W) "I n law, we have freed the slaves. In
fact, there is too much left of the
- A-feudal p st, said Co !. Quenard,
administrator of a territory consi-
derably larger than France itself, when I saw him in Co ! omb Bechar.
And he explained. Land and water rights in the desert are in the h nds of very
few peopte. For them the landless work far their"keep". They are paid in food,
such as tit is, and shelter.
"Shelter"may be the labyrinth if the ksar, the enclosed village in which the
streets are pitch-dark tunnels, with the sleeping quarters overhead and the stables
and byres on the ground noor. Or huts of sunbaked clay, which would melt like
chocolate in a downpour.
Money wages are unknown, but ex-
cept in mutual catastrophe, dependants
would never be allowed to starve. But
they cannot escape their servitude
except by trekking north to even
greater squalor in the ports, already
overcrowded with migrants from the
desert.
'"Liberation can come onlv with the
provision of new water supplies and
the creation and settlement of new
lands", said Col. Quenard,"then we
can give a freer and fuller life to the
peoples of the Sahara."
On the wall was a great map of the
Sahara on which his predecessors pre-
viously disposed troops and on which
he now pointed out to me the develop-
ment areas already in progress. On
his suggestion, we came to Abadla and
visited Taghit en route.
Taghit is a picture-postcard version of
the desert. There is a red Legionary
fort guarding an oasis in a valley
between smoking sand dunes. These
mountains with their windswept plumes of
sand might pass for volcanoes. Looking
down from the fort battlements on the
palm-treed oasis, one would say"This is
a paradise". And judging from the number
of"marabouts"or little temples conse-
crated to the memory of moslem saints,
the Arabs must find it a particularly holy
place.
NEVER SEE BREAD
BUT the sole diet of the 3000 hu-man beings who live in the five
villages"paradise"is dates and water.
They never see bread because they
have nothing to exchange for flour.
The soil is inhospitable. The river
bed is encrusted with salt as thick as
snow. They are to try a tobacco crop
there to barter for Hour.
, \had la, (jO miles tn the west, is a very
different story. The a'approach to the yalley
of the Guir is forbiddmg, through grim de-
files and over a wilderness of slatey grey-
ness, aGoigotha. of desolation.
Then over a ridge, one is dazzled buy
glitter of surprising greenness."Surpris-
ing"because in tile Sahara. where the
tamarisks, the jujubiers, the scrub and the
plants are a dusty lavender grey. one for-
gets what greenery looks like.
This, in the middle of the desert, was a
field of wheat and beside it the prosperous
market garden of the military post.
\we drove for mites across the basin of
the Guir, over a surface as. hard as
concrete. But it was sand-baked stilt.
inches thick, deposited by the spate of the
Guir, scouring the eroded soil of the
Moroccan Atlas and leaving it here.
The agricultural engineers of the
Society of Rural Amelioration showed
how, with tractors, soil-breakers and
disc-ploughs, they break up the sur-
face and find rich damp soil under-
neath. The scheme is to create units
of 1000 acres, with a heavy tractor, a
light tractor and implements for each
unit, on a collective farming basis.
The Arabs witt have their farms and
will hand over a fifth of the produce
for supplying other parts of the
Sahara.
COTTON NEXT
O YEH 50. 000 acres of this valiev. whichis 50 miles long and three mile, ;
broad, are already scheduled as
valuable soil and the total may be as high
as 125. 000 acres. The"cl"Ues"or spates of
the Guir will the controlled by a traditional
Arab system of successive weirs instead of
a great dam. A dam would choke with
still. The shallow basins will collect the
silt and become rich acres themselves, with
the river being periodically diverted over
new weirs.
Colonel Quenard reckons that the
grain from the Guir and from a
second desert valley can supply not
only the entire bread needs of the
Sahara, but provide a surplus for
export. Apart from grain and other
local crops, it is proposed to try cotton
growing for the fibre and for animal
feed. Flocks and. herds are to be
increased and improved. And this
valley of the nomads will become an
area of settled cultivation in the
desert.
VANISHED FOREST
M ; e in this vallev I may have foundthe answer to the childish question I
!) ave asked everyone in the desert :
"Where did Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian,
get his elephants. !" Ma . be from the Guir
for Suetonius Polinius, in AD 4i, reported
that there still existed here a great forest
abounding with elephants and wild ani-
malt.
A thousand years laterSidTaveh. a
powerful marabout and the St. Patrick ot
Arab legend, when bitten by a snake ordered
all the wild animals to leave the region.
And the Arabs cut down the forest which
Ire lJequpatlred to them.
