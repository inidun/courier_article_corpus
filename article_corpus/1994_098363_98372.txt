Nomads are misfits in the modern world. The state likes to see
them settled in one place, to "integrate" them and keep tabs on
them. The sedentary population is suspicious of them because it does
not understand their way of life. They have no place in a narrowminded
conception of modern civilization which only accepts what can be
pinned down, predicted and programmed.
They live on the outer edge of the economic system, usu¬
ally on unproductive land, practising a frugal and uncertain way of
life. They are shy of frontiers and avoid controls and supervision.
Everything about them is a challenge to modern society. They take
what it rejects and esteem values and codes it has abandoned. They
melt away into vast landscapesdeserts, forests, lakes, steppes
which the sedentary may regard as hostile but which for them mean
life, beauty, poetry and freedom.
This issue of the Courier records some of the things that
nomads have to tell us. In a more general way it may also stimulate
reflection about difference and the difficulty of being different today,
about the spread of intolerance, about the fears and anxieties that
lead people to reject what is at variance with themselves.
In any case, what sort of world would it be if everyone con¬
formed to the same pattern? In such a world we should not only die
of boredom, but of inability to adapt, to change, to renew ourselves
to meet life's unending challenges. For societies, as for living organ¬
isms, diversity is a necessary condition of survival. As the nomads,
with their thousands of years of history, remind us.
This issue comprises 52 pages and a 4-page insert between
pages 10-11 and 42-43. BAHGAT ELNADI AND ADEL RIFAAT
