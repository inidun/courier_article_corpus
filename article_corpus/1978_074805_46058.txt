300 years ago, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia
became the world's first woman Ph.D.
A WOMAN
OF HIGH DEGREE
by Maria Remiddi
JUST three hundred years ago, on 25
June 1678, a young woman submit¬
ted a doctoral thesis at Padua in Italy
and was solemnly awarded the title of
"Master and Doctor of Philosophy" (Magis-
tra et Doctrix Philosophiae).
A large audience was expected, and so it
was decided not to hold the ceremony in a
lecture hall, as was the usual practice, but
in the cathedral itself. The decision was a
wise one, for thousands of people flocked
to witness the historic scene as 32-year-old
Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia (1646-1684),
the daughter of a Venetian dignitary, step¬
ped apprehensively into the cathedral.
Giovan Battista Cornaro, her father, was
of noble lineage. The Cornaros had prov¬
ided the Venetian Republic with four Doges
and had also produced a Queen of Cyprus.
Nothing if not proud of his family's glorious
achievements, Giovan Battista had done
everything in his power to overcome the
obstacles that then stood in the way of a
woman who sought academic honours.
Only one had proved insuperable : the
authorities had refused to allow his daugh¬
ter to be examined for a doctorate In theo¬
logy. When she resubmitted her application
specifying the discipline of philosophy
(then called "dialectics"), the college of
professors had relented.
On the day of the examination, Elena
Lucrezia would have been only too glad to
forego the doctorate and return to her life
of learned seclusion, but beside her stood a
priest who urged her to comply with her
father's wishes. Put on her mettle by the
examiners' questions, she soon began to
display her vast erudition with an authority
that impressed the jury. A laurel crown was
placed on her head, and a teacher's ermine

cape was draped on her shoulders as the
college of professors conferred on her a
title which until then no woman in the
world had earned.
But Elena Lucrezia could not wait for the
moment when the congratulatory speeches
would be over and she could return home.
There she would continue her studies until
her death six years later.
Three centuries after this historic event,
interest is being rekindled in this noble and
learned Venetian woman. Research has
shown that she has been widely quoted by
other writers and the enumeration of her
works takes up over a page of a guide,
published in Padua in 1832, which lists
writings by women throughout history. The
earliest of her works to be cited is a trans¬
lation, executed in 1665 when she was six¬
teen years old, of a Spanish book entitled
"Conversation between Christ our Redeem¬
er and the Devout Soul".
Elena Lucrezia was still in her teens when
she felt her religious vocation and showed
her desire to turn her back on the things of
the world and devote herself to eternal
things. But her religious vocation went
hand in hand with a thirst for knowledge.
According to her biographers, she spoke
and wrote French, Spanish and Hebrew, as
well as Latin and ancient and modern
Greek. She played and composed music
and was a student of mathematics and
astronomy. A precocious and highly-
developed intellect, a prodigious memory
and an unremitting contempt for frivolity
and worldliness enabled her to amass her
vast store of erudition.
She was in no way misanthropic, in spite
of her refusal to marry and her fondness for
the monastic life. Elena Lucrezia was glad
to receive visits from scholars from Italy
and other countries and was ready to take
part in debates or, as we would say today,
give lectures. Her reputation spread
quickly. She became a member of seven
cultural academies ; her poems were
widely read.
Many stories are told to illustrate her sen¬
sitivity and modesty. Her father, who was
not only a rich man but vaunted his wealth,
was once talking to a group of painters and
craftsmen about a project for decorating
his palace on the Grand Canal.
"Why not give all this money to the
poor ?" Elena Lucrezia is said to have
asked. "If you did, you would be building a
far more resplendent and enduring palace
in Paradise."
Faced with his daughter's determination
to live a scholarly, ascetic life, Giovan Bat¬
tista sadly abandoned any idea of arranging

Just three hundred years ago, Elena
Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, a young
Venetian, became the first woman in the
world to receive a university doctorate.
The historic award was made by the
College of Masters of the University of
Padua (Italy), renowned for its rigorous
standards of scholarship. In this work by
the 19th-century artist Michèle Fanoli she
wears the ermine cape symbolizing her
teacher's status.

designed in 1906 for the library of Vassar
College, Poughkeepsie, New York, then a
leading university for women (it became
coeducational in 1969). Elena Lucrezia
Cornaro first became widely known in the
United States through a biography
published in 1896 by Lady Mathilde
Pynsent, the abbess of the English order
of St. Benedict in Rome.

a marriage for her. He installed Elena Lucre¬
zia, along with four servants and a doctor,
in his palace at Padua, where for some
years she pursued her studies of theology
and philosophy at the ancient university.
In Padua she lived the simple life. The sil¬
ver plate was only brought out during her
father's visits. Usually she ate off the dishes
used by the poor. She served her servants
and ministered to them when they were
sick.
In earlier times, other Italian women had
distinguished themselves by their erudition.
In the 14th century Novella d'Andrea re¬
placed her father when he was ill and from
1355 to 1366 taught canon law at the Univer¬
sity of Bologna (founded 1088). But when
she lectured her face was modestly covered
with a veil.
Elena Lucrezia Cornaro's face, however,
is well known to us through a number of
portraits. The scene as she presented her
thesis is depicted on a stained glass
window in the library of Vassar College in
the United States, where the story of her
life and work is widely known. Reflecting
this interest, an Italian-American commit¬
tee has been formed in Pittsburgh to cele¬
brate the tercentenary and to support
research being carried out at Padua.
Founded in 1222, the University of Padua
enjoyed a high reputation as a centre for
scientific and medical studies. Above, the
