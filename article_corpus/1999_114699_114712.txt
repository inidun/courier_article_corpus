The elderly have a vitally import a n t

about my t h , they must transmit the history of the
group and its social ru l e s , of which they are the

especially during the initiation ceremonies which

image of the elderly is highly positive . An old man

Old age is as much a historical and cultural
c o n s t ruct as a natural phenomenon. It is
based on biologi c a l ,d e m o gr a p h i c, e c o n o m i c
and political fa c t o rs , but it is also built on the image
of old age—in some cases positive , in others less
so—that each society shapes in conformity with its
values and its conception of what constitutes an
ideal human being.
Some cultures have emphasized the positive
side of gr owing old by viewing human
d e velopment as a lifelong process in which the
a ging individual accumulates qualities and
e x p e ri e n c e s. One example of this can be found in
the traditional rural societies of A f ri c a , where social
d i f f e r e n t i ation is based on age, which establishes
the superi o rity of the older over the yo u n g e r
g e n e r at i o n . In these societies the elderly are few in
number but they play a big role.

an ongoing progression that continues after deat h
leads to a conception of old age as the last stage of
an ascension towards fullness of knowledge and
p owe r.
W h at We s t e rn societies call loss of fa c u l t i e s ,
disability and degeneration are symptoms of a
m e t a m o rphosis towards a higher stage. If an old
p e rson can’t keep to the point, perhaps he is talking
with the ancestor s. If he goes blind or deaf, he is
seeing and listening to the spirits. If he shrivels up
and finds it hard to get about, he has become a
s p i ri t . A c c o m p l i s h e d , close to God and the
a n c e s t o rs , he lives as one of the elect. In such a
society people enjoy aging and saying they are old—
e ven ve ry, ve ry old. The term has many positive
associations. Adding “wise”would be redundant.
The quest 
for eternal youth
We s t e rn societies, on the other hand, d i v i d e
the human life span into successive periods in
which phases of gr ow t h , m at u rity and climax are
f o l l owed by decline and fa l l , leading to the
i n e v i t a b l e , i rr e ve rsible end. Faced with the
unprecedented increase in life expectancy and the
e ve r - gr owing number of elderly pers o n s , t h e s e
societies have two wat c h wo r d s : i n d i v i d u a l
resistance to aging and the solidarity of all with
the poorest elderly people.
Since old age is neither desirable nor enviable,
people should try and delay its onset as long as
p o s s i b l e . They have no right to squander their
capital of yo u t h f u l n e s s ; they must resist the rava g e s

In Western societies
this time of life is dominated
by negative images
of time by leading healthy lives and taking
a d vantage of all the remedies science has to offer—
p i l l s , health creams or surgery. The purpose of
p r e ve n t i ve action against old age is not to develop a
p e rs o n ’s capacities for living but to reject this stage
of life because it is viewed as degrading.
This struggle is a matter of individual
responsibility and the “losers”—those who fail to
s t ay young in mind and body when they fall ill,
suffer bereavement or have an accident—feel guilty.
For them, life has taken a sudden,drastic turn .T h e y
have entered old age, the age of dependence.The
criterion upon which this transition is based is not
social or cultural but biological. It depends on an
i n d i v i d u a l ’s physical capacities rather than on his or
her chronological age. In We s t e rn societies this time
of life is dominated by negat i ve images—loneliness,
incapacity and social uselessness.
C a ring is the key wo r d . When old age is
synonymous with inadequacy and decline,certain
things have to be done.Social workers specializing
in geriatric care use special assessment methods to
decide what kind of assistance should be gi ven and
w h at resources should be used, from geri at ri c
medicine to long-term care facilities.This process
has a logic of its own and raises the question of the
cost of dependence, which strengthens the
overwhelming image of the elderly as an economic
bu r d e n .N e ve r ,p e r h a p s , has a society done so much
for its oldest members.They benefit from economic
and social protection, but the image society has of
them is deeply negative.
Segregation 
between age groups
H i s t o rians have shown that a society’s image of
individuals at a given stage of life has a significant
bearing on the way they are treated. Paradoxically,
Western societies,where there are more and more
elderly people, organize an unprecedented form of
s e gr e g ation between the age gr o u p s.Young and old
p u rsue different activities in different places at
different times. The harmonious mingling of the
ages in a shared setting no longer exists.
In A f ri c a , the transform ation of the traditional
context by such processes as urbanizat i o n ,
schooling and the development of a culture based
on the written wo r d , the intermingling of
p o p u l at i o n s , the spread of new religions and the
a rri val of new, more individualistic values are
diluting if not destroying the community system
and gerontocracy. K n owledge and power have
changed hands.Those societies may be witnessing
the “twilight of the old”. H owe ve r , no society
remains frozen.And even when the age pyramid is
t u rned upside down—when more people start
a p p e a ring at the top than at the bottom, as in the
West or in some Asian countries that have
implemented proactive birth control policies—
s o l i d a rity may still have a role to play — but only if
a process of gi ve-and-take between generations is
restored to human relat i o n s h i p s. ■
