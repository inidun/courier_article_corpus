                       Considered one of the best traditional weavers in the Philippines, 
       haja amina appi has been named a “living human treasure” in her country in 2004. 
                              by transmitting her art to future generations she guarantees 
                                       the preservation of this example of intangible heritage.

Into Culture
at weaver Haja Amina Appi walks 
with a strong stride that betrays her 
80 years. She is off to harvest leaves 
from the pandan trees that grow 
behind her home in Ungos Matata, 
in the province of Tawi Tawi, a small 
island in the southwestern tip of the 
Philippines. 
The bulky leaves are thorny-edged, 
but she prefers this variety because 
it produces strong and sturdy mat-
ting strips. She has become accus-
tomed to the prickly thorns after years 
of working with them to produce the 
raw materials of her art. 
Throughout her life she has been a 
mat weaver, teacher, artist, and most 
recently, a National Living Treasure 
or Gawad sa Manlilika ng Bayan 
Awardee. 
In line with UNESCO’s efforts to 
promote living human treasures, the 
Republic of the Philippines esta- 
blished this prestigious national title in 
1992 to identify individuals who play 
a special role in the preservation and 
revitalization of traditional arts threa- 
tened by extinction. 
Since then, eleven artists have 
been named in recognition of their 
dedication to their craft and use of 
indigenous methods and materials. 
Haja Appi received this designation 
in 2004 in recognition of her skills in 
the art of weaving mats from pandan 
leaves, or paghahablon.
An ancient 
technique
Tepo mat making is a very precise 
“counted thread” weaving tech-
nique practiced by women of the 
Sama community of Tawi-tawi for 
generations. 
The Sama mat is known for its bold 
colors, geometric designs, and du-
rability. A plain white mat is sewn 
against a colored one and serves 
as the design’s frame, contrasting 
with the rich palette and serving as 
a protection for the thin dried pan-
dan strips. A mat can take up to two 
months to weave, even longer for 
more intricate designs. Haja Appi 
has earned a reputation for creating 
the most intricate and finely woven 
mats. 
Her work begins with the harvest 
of the pandan leaves. She then re-
moves the thorns with a small knife 
and and strips them with a jangat 
deyum, a thin piece of wood with 
sharp tines. The resulting narrow rib-
bons are then sun-dried and colored 
in a boiling vat of anjibi, a commer-
cial powdered dye. 
To soften the strips and make 
them pliant enough for weaving, 
she crushes them repeatedly with a 
paggosa or heavy log, in a process 
called pagtabig. This arduous and 
repetitive chore is essential to prop-
erly dry the pandan strips without 
rendering them brittle and useless.
Bold designs
Haja Appi does not work from a writ-
ten pattern, nor does she use paper 
and pencil to keep track of each loop 
and fold. She relies on her innate

sense of mathematical progression 
to calculate when and how the col-
ored fibers will eventually join to 
create symmetrical geometric de-
signs. 
What sets Haja Appi apart from 
her fellow mat weavers is the ex-
ceptional evenness of her weave 
and the startling creativity of her 
patterns. Although she uses a tra-
ditional repertoire of weaving tech-
niques to create delicate, precise, 
and minutely detailed patterns, her 
simple geometric designs are dra-
matic bursts of colort that both defy 
and celebrate tradition. 
Historically, the Sama mat was 
plain white in color, but she began 
experimenting with dye to achieve 
her desired effect. As commercial 
dyes are often not bold or striking 
enough for her taste, she mixes 
them to obtain vibrant reds, purples 
and yellows, sometimes using up to 
eight colors at a time. 
In order to preserve this tradition 
for future generations, Haja Appi 
teaches young women in her 
community the art of Tepo, a skill 
traditionally passed from mother 
to daughter. 
Her deep knowledge of both the 
technique of paghahablon, as well 
as her lifelong efforts to preserve 
this important Filipino tradition, has 
earned her a special place as one 
of the nation’s culture bearers. Her 
work is available for public view 
in the collection of the National 
Museum of the Philippines.
