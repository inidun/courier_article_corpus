The efforts to safeguard Carthage and the
nearby village of Sidi Bou Said (see page
40) are particularly notewo rt hy because
ancient remains in two other Arab capitals have
not always enjoyed the same good fort u n e .
In Cairo, the pyramids have had a narr ow
e s c a p e .“I don’t think anything can harm them
n ow,” s ays Zahi Haw wa s , the energetic head
of the Giza archaeological zone.In 1995,h owe-
ve r , this UN E S C O World Heritage site, w h i c h
contains the last of the Seven Wo n d e rs of the
World that can still be seen, was nearly cut in
t wo by the gr e ater Cairo ring road being bu i l t
to decongest the city of 15 million or so inha-
b i t a n t s.After a campaign led by UN E S C O a n d
helped by the media,Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak came down on the side of heri t a g e .
As a result,the eight-lane ring road has not
been paved for the four kilometres that we r e
supposed to cross the Giza Plat e a u , but the
rubble is still there and the route has been
handy for truck dri ve rs who use it as a short
c u t .“I ordered this traffic to stop at the begi n-
ning of June,”s ays an annoyed Haw wa s ,w h o
wants the gove rnment to build a detour that
avoids the site.
“ We asked for the road foundations to be
d e s t r oyed but that wa s n ’t done, so I fear the
plan to use the route isn’t completely dead,”
s ays Said Zulfic a r , a former UN E S C O o f fic i a l
who fought against the ring road and is now

The defence of archaeological treasures in the Lebanese 
and Egyptian capitals has triggered epic battles and led 
to mixed results
moine sans Frontières (Heritage Without Bor-
d e rs ) .
He deplores the fact that another part of
C a i r o, the protected site of Fustat , the first city
founded by the Muslim conquerors in the 7th
c e n t u ry, is being harmed by “rampant urban
e x p a n s i o n ” .The authori t i e s , he say s ,“ h ave
built social housing and an amusement park
right in the middle of the town when it hasn’t
e ven been excavated by archaeologi s t s.
“In Egypt, there are laws and officials bu t
there are also people more powerful than the
l aw s , along with a lot of speculat o rs ,” s ays Zul-
fic a r , hinting at the weakness of the stat e ’s
Higher Council for Antiquities in the face of
big construction firms headed by people in the
inner circles of powe r.
This is something the inhabitants of Bei-
rut know all about.After the recent civil wa r ,
Lebanese archaeologists had an unexpected
chance to explore and display the precious
b owels of the city centre which had been expo-
sed by bombing. But the area “ was cleared by
bu l l d o z e rs and dynamite as part of a huge
urban renewal project,” s ays Lebanese archi-
tect and town planner Jade Ta b e t .The main
shareholder of Solidere, the company doing
the clearance wo r k ,was we a l t hy former pri m e
minister (1993-1998) Rafik Hari ri ,who is now
in disgr a c e .
This meant that a blueprint making the
city into a kind of Manhattan on the Mediter-
ranean was forced on the centre of the Leba-
nese capital “ e ven before archaeologists could
s t a rt diggi n g,”s ays Leila Badre, the respected
c u r ator of the Museum of the A m e rican Uni-
ve rsity of Beiru t .“From that point on, the die
was cast—badly—and we realized that the
i m p o rtance of the archaeological remains wa s
going to be played dow n .”
E x c avations sponsored by UN E S C O b e t-
ween 1993 and 1995 uncovered some ve ry
valuable remains,notably the ancient “ t e l l ”o r
mound which was evidence of the city’s Phoe-
nician ori gi n s. In 1996, the gove rnment eve n
ordered three sites to be preserve d , but the
order was never carried out.“If we don’t take
action quickly,the remains will be damaged,”
wa rns Badre.
Who can do this? Solidere or the Directo-
r ate General of Antiquities? Solidere is going
through a bad pat c h , and in A p ril 1999 the
head of the Directorate General and half of his
aides were thrown in prison for embezzlement.
“ I t ’s a mess,”s ays Ta b e t .“ We should have
based the plan for the new centre of the city
on sites that could have become centres of
at t r a c t i o n .But just try persuading someone
who only thinks in cash-flow terms that
archaeology can create added value! All the
d e ve l o p e rs see are square metres of space to
be built on as fast as possible.So some remains
h ave been dumped in the sea,o t h e rs are cru m-
bling into dust and Solidere’s ‘ d a z z l i n g ’p r o-
ject is 
in the doldru m s. I t ’s dreadful to see the 
3 , 0 0 0 - year history of a city sold down 
the ri ve r.” n
Greater Cairo’s tentacular growth reaches out to the pyramids.
Development and rebuilding in central Beirut
have given short shrift to archaeological remains.
