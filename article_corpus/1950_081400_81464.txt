FILMS IN INDIA SHOW THE ROAD AHEAD
WHEN the new road came to Kurvandi, an old village in rural India, it broughtmore than merely a physical change in the landscape. It brought also a thou-
sand changes in habits of social and personal life that had remained almost
the same in Kurvandi, as in countless other Indian villages, for many hundreds of
years. The people of Kurvandi soon came to understand the value of the road.
But those in other villages did not.
To teach the millions of men and women in rural India the benefits of change
is one of the major goals of the Government of India. Few problems are greater
and more urgent than the need to show the people the advantages of replacing old
habits, customs and superstitions with modern methods of living.. As an important
means of coping with this
problem, the Government
is using educational and
documentary films, simple
in content, personal in
approach, slower in tempo
than ordinary films, and
made to fit the special
needs and conditions of
people in rural areas.
One of these is <&lt; Kur-
vandi Road ;), made by the
Paul Zils'documentary unit
for the United Nations, and
acquired by the Govern-
ment of India for wide dis-
tribution by projectors on
mobile vans in villages
which lack electricity. The
technique both of the pre-
sentation of images and
narrative is intended to
influence and persuade
simple people of the value
and urgency of co-opera-
tion for community better-
ment. The story of the
benefits the road brought
to Kurvandi is made per-
sonal by the device of
an intimate commentary
spoken as if by the villagers
themselves.
The villagers did in fact havej. a. part in the m king of
the film. When Zils and
his unit came to Kurvandi, he
asked their co-operation, and
they suggested angles of
thought and approach which
were stronger and more effect-
ive than any he had planned
in advance.
'Kurvandi Road"attracted
considerable attention when it
was shown at the Third In-
ternational Festival of Docu-
mentary Films at Edinburgh,
Scotland.
Another film made by the
Zils unit, which is being dis-
tributed by the Government as
part of its programme of
intensive rural education by
films, is"A Tiny Thing Brings
Death". Instead of the charts
and drawings usual in scienti-
fic documentaries, this uses a
simple story of village life to
illustrate the cause and pre-
vention of malaria.
Most of the films for rural
use are being made for the
Government of India, by a
new organization called In-
dian Documentary Films, part
of the Films Division or the
Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting, under the di-
rection of M. Bhavnani, one of
the best known personalities
in the Indian cinema. Pre-
pared in four languages-Hin-
dustani, Gujerati, Bengali and
Tamil, the films tackle a va-
riety of present-day social and
economic problems.
Food storage, for example, is
treated in a film entitled"War
on Waste". The need for bet-
