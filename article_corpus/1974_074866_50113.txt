HARRY LUSTIG, a native of Vienna, is
Professor of Physics and Dean of the Col¬
lege of Liberal Arts and Science of the
City College of the City University of New
York. From 1970 to 1972 he was a member
of Unesco's Science Sector. He was
Unesco's consultant for the 1973 International
Congress, "The Sun in the Service of
Mankind" and contributed a major report,
"Solar Energy: The State of the Art", for
Unesco's working party on solar energy, in
lune 1973. His article is a condensed version
of a chapter from this study.

O what extent is the world
energy crisis upon us now and how
much time do we have before it will
reach disastrous proportions? What is
the lead time necessary for producing
needed technological innovations and
economic and social rearrangements?
How reliable are the estimates of
fossil fuel reserves? How long will
the world's stocks of natural nuclear
fuel last and how good are the pros¬
pects for controlled fusion? What is
the relative availability, exploitability
and cost (economic and environmental)
of the "natural" substitutes: solar,
wind, geothermal and tidal energy?
Is it realistic to expect people in
the industrialized countries to change
their way of life, so as to use less
energy in the future? And is it sensible
and moral to ask the developing
countries to give up their quest to
narrow the energy gap and to begin
to approach the standard of living now
enjoyed by the developed countries?
It is generally recognized that the
future of solar energy will in large
measure be determined by the answers
given to these questions. This is
because in order to utilize solar energy
on either a large or a small scale, no
fundamental scientific breakthroughs
are needed (unlike in the case of
nuclear fusion), but what is needed
are technological advances and invest¬
ment policies to bring down the cost.
The factors which will determine
whether and when sunlight becomes
a major source for satisfying man's
energy needs are thus largely eco¬
nomic, political, sociological.
Between now and the year 2000,
the United States will consume more
energy than it has in its entire history:
in that year the annual U.S. demand
for energy is expected to be double
what it is now.
Today the United States, with
6 per cent of the world's population,
uses 35 per cent of the world's energy.
Its per capita increase in energy con¬
sumption is now about 1 per cent per
year, while, starting from a much lower
base, the world's average is increasing
at a rate of 1.3 per cent.
Because of the much faster popu¬
lation growth in some parts of the
world, just to keep pace with that
growth (and the 1.3 per cent per capita
increase) the world-wide energy supply
will have to triple, rather than double

by the year 2000. With these trends,
by 2000 A.D. the gap between the U.S.
and the developing countries will still
be large and it could take 300 years
to close that gap.
The problem in many developing
areas is not only the very low and
nearly static per capita energy con¬
sumption (the population growth
largely negating the increased total
production of energy) but also the
"non-commercial" sources (mostly
firewood) from which much of the
energy is derived.
The use of wood as a fuel and the
ensuing deforestation has already had
the most deleterious consequences in
India and in large areas of Africa. It
is clear that there is little possibility
of Increasing the consumption of these
non-commercial fuels in many parts
of the world. The projected increases
in energy consumption would (in the
absence of new sources, such as solar
energy) therefore have to come dis¬
proportionately from the commercial
sector.
The world's consumption of energy
for Industrial purposes is already
doubling each decade. If the rate of
industrialization were to change fast
enough to permit the developing
countries to reach by the year 2000
the U.S. standard of living, the world¬
wide level of energy consumption
would be roughly 100 times the present
figure.
Our accumulated stocks of fossil
fuels were almost entirely laid down

during the Cambrian period, which
began about 600 million years ago.
The process is still continuing, but
probably at about the same rate as
in the past. Thus the natural accumu¬
lation during any part of the future
that is of interest will be entirely
insignificant; when we have used up
what there is now, there will be no
more.
The U.S. scientist, M. King Hubbert
predicts that the world's resources of
oil will be exhausted by 2100 and those
of coal by 2500. It does not appear,
however, that King Hubbert has taken
into account any limitations other than
those of discovery and extraction
such as a political decision by one
country not to export its resources to
another, or environmental restrictions
on the use of a fuel.
Nor is there, on the other hand,
any allowance made for an uncharac¬
teristic flowering of collective human
wisdom: should the peoples of the
world decide, for Instance, that oil and
coal should be preserved and used
for petrochemicals rather than burned
for fuel, the supplies could last very
much longer.
The peak in world oil production
will be passed sometime between
1985 and 2000. By the year 2000,
when the annual world-wide rate of
energy consumption will be only three
times the present rate, half or more
of the total world reserve of oil will
have been consumed. It is all but
certain that gas and oil will cease
being a major energy source for

humanity well before the middle of
the 21st century.
The situation for coal Is considerably
better both with respect to the re¬
liability of the estimates of reserves
and the amount of these reserves.
However, If the present rise In the
rate of coal production Is not checked
In the near future, the peaking will
occur before 2050 and the supply will
be exhausted before 2100.
It should also be noted that coal
mining has a particularly ugly effect on
the environment and that the burning
of coal produces serious pollution by
the emission of sulphur and other
products. Nevertheless, in the absence
of non-fossil substitutes, coal will
have to become the major source of
energy for the Indefinite future, and
even with the most optimistic estimates
as to the development of nuclear and
solar energy, coal will be a substantial
contributor to a growing energy con¬
sumption for at least the next 50 years.
Although the discussion of atomic
energy is usually carried on in terms
of the two alternatives, fission and
fusion, a prediction of what the future
holds in store really requires a sub¬
division of each of these methods Into
two categories.
If fission Is likely to be the only
available process as appears likely
for some time to come the prospects
for major and long time energy pro¬
duction from this source will depend
very much on whether reliance will
continue to have to be placed on the
presently developed reactors, which
use uranium 235, or whether breeder
reactors, which start with uranium 238
or thorium 232 as a fuel will be put
Into production.

fuels. But even if we include the
low grade ores as a source of supply,
it is clear that the era of U 235 nuclear
fission will be a short one probably
terminating before the end of the
century.
The situation will change drastically
if and when the breeder reactor comes
into use on an industrial scale. With
breeding, a large part of the supply
of natural uranium as well as of
thorium would thus become available

as fuel for fission reactors. This means
not only that low grade ores could then
be economically used, but that the
energy output from each ton of ore
would be very much greater. Under
these conditions the existing uranium
reserves could supply the world's
energy needs for perhaps a thousand
years to come.
There is every reason to expect
that breeder reactors will be oper¬
ational within perhaps 20 years. But
that development will not completely
solve the energy crisis and will, In
fact, bring new problems in Its wake.
For one thing, nuclear energy shares,
with solar energy, the characteristic
that it Is capital Intensive; the capital
cost, per kilowatt of generating
capacity, of a nuclear electric power
plant is about twice that of a fossil
fuel plant.
More Important, the environmental
consequences of large scale nuclear
power production are serious. Here
it Is not primarily a problem of air
pollution by effluent particles, .as in
the case of the burning of fossil fuels,
but of the safe disposal of the radio¬
active fission products, the (small)
risk of (highly disastrous) accidents
in the operation of reactors and the
thermal pollution caused by the
massive cooling of the nuclear power
plants.
Control of the thermonuclear fusion
process the process of the hydrogen
bomb so that it may be exploited as
a source of useful energy involves a
number of scientific phenomena that
are not yet completely understood and
of engineering advances that have
hardly been seriously studied. The
fusion process thus remains a possi¬
bility with a highly uncertain outcome.
It may therefore be premature to
be concerned about the reserves of
"raw material" required for the fusion
process, but It is useful, nevertheless,
since the successful realization of
fusion, by way of the deuterium-tri¬
tium reaction might see us through
about halfway Into the 21st century,
but no longer than that.
The picture would be changed
dramatically if fusion could be accom¬
plished with the deuterium-deuterium
reaction. One cubic metre of water
contains enough atoms of deuterium
to provide a potential fusion energy
equivalent to the heat of combustion
of 300 tons of coal or 1,500 barrels
of crude oil.
The total volume of the oceans is
about 1,500 million cubic kilometres.
If enough deuterium were withdrawn
to reduce the initial concentration by
1 per cent, the energy made available
by its fusion would amount to about
500,000 times the energy content of
tho world's supply of fossil fuels.
Many other disasters will befall the
world before that supply would be
exhausted.
There are three sources of conti¬
nuously incoming energy: intercept¬
ed solar radiation; geothermal
energy, which is conveyed to the sur¬
face of the earth from the interior by
the conduction of heat and by con¬
vection in hot springs and volcanoes;
and tidal energy derived from the
kinetic and gravitational potential
energy of the earth-moon-sun system.
It ¡s a reasonably simple matter to
estimate the approximate rate of Input
from each source, but the more diffi¬
cult and important task Is to determine
how much of this can be tapped as
useful heat or converted into work
in the light of the prevailing technology,
economic factors and environmental
constraints.
The earth intercepts more than
1,500 quadrillion (1,500 followed by
15 zeroes) kilowatt hours of power
each year, but not all of it reaches the
earth's surface. About 30 per cent of
the solar energy is immediately reflec¬
ted back into space, another 47 per
cent is absorbed by the atmosphere,
the land surface and the oceans and
converted into heat, and another 23 per
cent Is involved in the evaporation,
convection, precipitation and surface
runoff of water in the hydrological
cycle. A small fraction, about 0.2 per
cent, drives the atmospheric and
oceanic convections and circulations
Many countries now carry out
research on harnessing atomic
energy for peaceful tasks. India,
a pioneer in this field, decided
as early as 1954 to set up the
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
at Trombay, near Bombay (right).

centre near Marseilles.

and the ocean waves. Finally, an even
smaller fraction, about 0.02 per cent
is captured by the chlorophyll of green
plants and becomes, by photosynthe¬
sis, the essential source of energy for
the growth of all living matter (as well
as, in a minute fraction, the source
of fossil fuels).
Tidal energy represents a potential
source of power which, assuming it
could be exploited continuously, could
produce 567,000 million kilowatt hours
of energy per year. This is less than
1 per cent of the world's energy con¬
sumption in 1970.
The presently existing or seriously
researched ways of obtaining geo¬
thermal power all involve the extrac¬
tion of heat from volcanoes or from
the hot water filling the sands of deep
sedimentary basins. A geothermal
power operation has been under way
in the Larderello area of Italy since
1904 and now has a capacity of 370
megawatts. The three other main areas
of production are the geysers in north¬
ern California, Wairakei in New Zea¬
land, and Iceland.
It has been estimated that the stored
thermal energy in the world's major
geothermal areas would, if exploited,
provide energy equal to the amount
consumed In the U.S. in the year 1970.
Furthermore, this energy Is depletable;
if it were withdrawn over the next
50 years, the contribution to the
world's annual power consumption,
even during that limited time, would
be less than that from tidal power.
We see therefore that the total
power influx into the earth's surface
environment is almost entirely (99.98
per cent) due to solar radiation; the
sun's contribution to the earth's energy
income is 5,000 times more than
that of the other sources combin¬
ed. This does not by itself necessa¬
rily mean that solar energy is there¬
fore the only or even the major
candidate for becoming a source of
renewable energy but this conclusion
does, in fact, appear to be correct.
It should be noted that all the solar
components can, in principle, be tapped
for power. The classic approach is to
intercept a tiny fraction of the 47 per
cent which would otherwise go to
heat the land and water surface and
the atmosphere, and to use it either
directly as heat or to convert Into
mechanical or electrical energy.
With a collection and conversion
efficiency of 10 per cent, something
like 2 per cent of the land area of the
U.S. would suffice to meet that
country's total energy needs in the
year 2000.
The potential water power of the
world has been estimated at around
3,000 million kilowatts, about one third
of the present world rate of energy
consumption. However, only 8.5 per
cent of this water power is developed
(mainly by conventional hydroelectric
systems) and the three regions with
the greatest potential Africa, South

America and south-east Asia are the
least advanced industrially.
Wind power is the sun's contribution
by way of the atmospheric and oceanic
convection mode. While windmills
could be resurrected as a source of
small power in certain locations, wind
energy cannot be relied upon on a
large or global scale. On the other
hand, it may become feasible to
exploit thermal depth and streamflow
gradients In the oceans, especially in
multipurpose operations involving also
mariculture and fresh water production.
Turning to the last terrestrial solar
energy absorption mechanism, recom¬
mendations have recently been made
in several countries for increasing the
solar energy harnessed through photo¬
synthesis, by growing suitable trees
and plants in special solar plantations
and recovering the energy either
through burning or the creation of syn¬
thetic fuels.
Finally there is a proposal for satel¬
lite collection of solar radiation and
recovering the energy on a large scale
outside the earth's atmosphere.
It is not yet clear which of the
many schemes proposed for the
harnessing of solar energy will prove to
be the most efficient or how soon solar
energy will be exploited on a large
scale. But it is clear that among all
the renewable sources of energy, the
sun is the only serious contender for
massive and long-term exploitation and
that it is, in fact, the only real altern
ative or supplement to breeder reactors
or fusion for dealing with the energy
crisis.
In recent years the partisans of solar
energy have shown a commendable
realism in recognizing that the sun
will not become a major direct source
of power until the cost of its collec¬
tion and conversion becomes at least
comparable to that of conventional
fuels.
Solar energy, when used directly as
heat, in such applications as water and
house heating and water distillation Is,
in some regions of the world, already
competitive with fuel and electricity.
There is little doubt that further

technological developments and mass
production will lower the cost of solar
energy utilization and even less doubt
that there will be a sharp rise in the
price of conventional fuels.
But it would be foolhardy to sit back
and rely on this negative phenomenon
because the cross-over point might
then be reached at a time and at a
price which would have disastrous
consequences for the world's standard
of living.
Humanity is willing to pay quite
exorbitant prices for energy in special
circumstances and for special uses,
or when the sources employed have
special characteristics.
Much high-priced energy is used in
small quantities and for luxury uses
such as electric watches or the space
programme. However, the problem
becomes serious when applied to
underdeveloped or underpopulated
areas of the world. There are places
where there is at present no fossil
fuel or nuclear energy available and
where solar energy may be the best
or the only hope for relief from suffer¬
ing or a dreadfully low standard of
living.
In the drought-stricken zone of west
central Africa, for example, where
millions of cattle have died and humans
are starving to death for lack of water
lying underground, fuel and mainten¬
ance-free solar pumps might just pos¬
sibly be more effective and practical
than diesel powered ones, for which
the fuel has to be transported over
miles of desert, and which may be¬
come useless at the first breakdown.
The energy supply crisis discount¬
ing political and ecological considera¬
tions and a concern for improving the
lot of the poor nations and people is
a crisis of the future, a crisis of anti¬
cipated growth.
The reason for the sense of crisis
is, of course, that the world's consump¬
tion of energy is not constant, or even
increasing linearly, but that it is rising
exponentially.
It is clear that our present growth
rates in energy production, in raw
materials consumption, in population
and in pollution cannot be sustained.
This is a point which scientists and
other throughtful men have appreciated
for some time and which they are
trying to get the world and its leaders
to understand and to act upon.
In spite of the fact that the present
Impetus for solar energy development
in the industrialized countries appears
to be fed by concern with the exhaus¬
tion of the supply of other fuels, a halt
to the increase in the consumption of
energy will have to occur for other

compelling reasons, long before some
of these supplies are exhausted.
Much will, of course, depend on
when the equilibrium state is reached
and at what level of consumption. If It
occurs soon, before levels of con¬
sumption rise much more and before
coal supplies are severely depleted,
and, particularly, if breeder reactors
are by that time in operation, the
consumption of energy will not be seen
as supply limited but as carrying
capacity limited.
If that happens, it will not be the
renewable aspect of solar energy but
its non-polluting nature which will make
it an essential source. For it is not
only air and water pollution which
may call a halt to exponential growth
before anything else does, but It may
very well be thermal pollution the
