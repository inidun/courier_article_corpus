GOOD HEALTH CANNOT GROW IN A BAR
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SOIL

over and expanded by the govern-
ments. This is a source of qreat
satisfaction to us, since our aim is to
help countries to help themselves.
As in malaria control, so also qreat
progress is being made in many
countries, with assistance from WHO,
in combatting the venereal infections
and tuberculosis which for centuries
have claimed millions of victims each
year. In the field of public health
administration 27 countries have
asked for and received help through
WHO during 1951 alone. This year,
too, there are joint UNICEF/WHO
programmes under way in 16 count-
ries for improving the health of
mothers and children.
One of the most important func-
tions of WHO is to promote the
exchange of scientific information so
that knowledge and skills acquired
by any one country become avail-
able to all others. In this connection
I could cite the 12 major teaching
and training projects being carried
out at the present moment or the 498
fellowships which have been award-
ed this year by WHO to specialists
from more than seventy countries for
study abroad. I might also mention
the world-wide importance of the
International Pharmacopoeia which,
published, a few days ago, marks the
culmination of 14 years of work by
experts from many countries.
My list of examples could be
continued almost indefinitely : but I
prefer to bring it to an end by telling
you in slightly more detail the story
of just one of many activities, one
which aptly illustrates the fact that
the seeds of international co-
operation, once well planted, are
certain to grow and bring forth
fruit.
Early in its history WHO consider-
ed how it could help meet the need
for more widespread knowledge of
modern techniques in anaesthesio-
logy. Individual consultants were
sent, first to Austria, in 1947, and
then to Poland and Finland in 1948.
By 1950 interest had qrown so
strong in the Scandinavian countries
that a training centre to serve this
area as a whole was opened in Co-
penhagen, jointly operated by WHO
and the University of Copenhagen.
As the work of this training centre
in anaesthesiology became known,
other countries outside the Scandi-
navian group began to send students
there. Indeed, Yugoslavia, France,
Greece and Israel wished to have
similar training centres set up in
their own countries. The work of
the centre was therefore broadened
and, in addition to all the Scandi-
navian countries, included physicians
from Switzerland, Greece and France.
In the same year we sent individual
consultants in anaesthesiology to
Yugoslavia, Israel and Turkey. Dur-
ing 1951 this work has been con-
tinued in Israel and started in Iran.
The beginning of 1952 will see con-
sultants at work in Ceylon, in
Burma and in Thailand.
From a very small beginning
WHO's activity in this one field has
spread from country to country on
the common ground of need, so that
within just these few years since
1947 seventeen countries have gain-
ed tangibly in knowledge and skills
with which to protect and promote
the well-being of their peoples.
What. you are entitled to ask, is
likely to be the enduring significance
of the various kinds of work which
WHO has initiated around the globe ?
In at least two important respects we
can give. even now, very concrete
and very categorical answers to this
question. First, throuqh the existence
of a world health agency the suffer-
ing of millions of human beings in
scores of countries will be alleviated
and many, many thousands of lives
will be saved. Second, the move-
ment of doctors. nurses. sanitary
engineers, etc. from one country to
another under the auspices of WHO,
the actual teamwork of specialists
coming from different regions with
differing social and cultural back-
grounds. is resulting in a valuable
cross-fertilization of ideas and in
establishing strong emotional and
intellectual bonds across inter-
national boundaries.
All thi creates conditions which
are unquestionably favourable to
the development of harmonious re-
lations and mutual understanding
among the nations. But can we go
beyond this and say flatly that the
work being done now by WHO is. a
major contribution to the cause of
peace ? I think not-at least not
under present circumstances and not
unless we make certain reservations.
And this brings me to the second
lesson which I believe we have
learned from the brief experience of
our work in WHO. It is a lesson
which, like the first one, has impor-
tant implications for the whole of the
United Nations system.
In attempting to evaluate projects
we were carrying out, we quickly
discovered the fallacy of equatina
health work with health progress, let
