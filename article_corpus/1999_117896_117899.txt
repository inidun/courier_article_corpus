The once-green land of Ireland tur-

seals swimming among ice-floes off
the coast of France. Polar bears prowling
the streets of A m s t e r d a m . These are the
images conjured up by the latest research
into global warming.
Ye s , you read that corr e c t l y : global wa r-
ming—the rise in the world’s average tem-
p e r ature caused by the trapping of the sun’s
heat by pollution in the atmosphere.
If you are baffled by that, then prepare
to be shocked.For the same research is now
suggesting that such dramatic changes in
the climate of northern Europe could take
place in as few as 10 years.
Again, this figure is not a misprint: no
zero has gone missing. Scientists have
recently uncovered compelling evidence
t h at global wa rming can have a deva s t at i n g
impact on timescales far shorter than
a nyone believed possible. Not centuri e s ,
not even decades, but ye a rs , in what are
being called “ c l i m atic fli p s ” . One leading
e x p e rt has recently gone on record to wa rn
t h at some north Atlantic countries could
find themselves plunged into Arctic condi-
tions over the space of just 10 years.
Risk of
sudden upheaval
In geological term s ,t h at is as fast as the
blink of an eye.But even in human terms,
such a rate of climatic change is incredi-
bly—and quite probably intolerably—
rapid. It is far from clear whether any eco-
n o my or agricultural system could cope
with such sudden upheaval.
Yet evidence is now mounting that such
“ c l i m atic fli p s ” not only can happen, bu t
h ave happened in the past. It is evidence
that adds new urgency to the global war-
ming debat e , which has lost much of its
momentum in recent ye a rs. It also high-
lights the frightening complexity of the task
facing scientists trying to predict the eart h ’s
response to human activity.
Arguments about climatic change typi-
cally focus on how increasing levels of so-
called greenhouse gases—principally car-
bon dioxide from burning fossil fuels—in
the eart h ’s atmosphere trap ever more of
the sun’s heat.
Huge efforts have been put into predic-
ting the likely global temperature rise cau-
sed by the extra greenhouse gases, and cur-
rent best estimates point to a rise of 1.5
d e grees Celsius or so over the next century.
But while scientists wa rn that even so
apparently small a rise in temperature could
cause upheaval in eve rything from agri c u l-
tural practices to the spread of disease, t h e
rat e of change hardly seems terri f y i n g .S u r e l y
we can cope and have coped with events that
change over several generat i o n s ?
Such arguments are buttressed by ano-
t h e r , apparently compelling, a r g u m e n t
against rapid climate change. The eart h ’s
oceans have colossal thermal inert i a , a n d
would surely iron out any sudden upheava l :
weight for weight, it takes ten times more
energy to heat water than it does solid iron.
Small wo n d e r ,t h e n ,t h at scientists we r e
u n s u rp rised when they failed to find any
signs of rapid climatic changes when they
first studied ancient ocean sediments, the
isotope levels of which retain a record of
past temperatures.
The end of the Ice Age: 
a puzzling discovery
But this apparently comfort i n g
c o n fluence of theory and data is now
known to contain two huge loopholes.The
first reared its head in the early 1980s, w h e n
a joint U.S.-European team of scientists
working in Greenland made a puzzling dis-
c ove ry.They had extracted an ice-core from
a site in the southern part of the country,

Global warming’s impact on the environment is not necessarily a  drawn-out affair. Recent
evidence shows that dramatic changes or ‘climatic flips’ could happen virtually overnight.

Telegraph
By analysing icy sediments (ice-cores) extracted from deep beneath the earth’s surface scientists can plot the
course of climate change thousands of years ago. Below, a sample taken at Lake Annecy (France) in winter.

and had measured isotope levels in the gas
trapped at different depths in an at t e m p t
to gauge the temperature in the region ove r
thousands of years.
Because the ice builds up relat i ve l y
r a p i d l y, the ice-core was expected to gi ve
the researchers the most fine-detailed pic-
ture yet of temperature changes in the
r e gi o n . Plotting out the corresponding tem-
p e r at u r e s , the researchers discovered some-
thing puzzling—and disturbing.
As expected, the core showed the rise in
t e m p e r ature corresponding to the end of
the last Ice Age around 11,000 years ago.
But it also showed that the bulk of that
wa rm-up had taken place in the space of
just 40 years.
At the time, no one knew what to make
of the result, which flew in the face of eve-
rything scientists then knew about climate
change—or thought they knew. In the ye a rs
t h at followe d , h owe ve r , f u rther ice-cores
were extracted, and they revealed an even
more dramatic story : a 5- to 10-degr e e
increase in temperature and doubling of
p r e c i p i t ation over Greenland in the space of
just 20 years.
Nothing in the earlier ocean sediment
core data had prepared scientists for such a
finding—nor could it. For this was the first
loophole in the argument against sudden
c l i m atic fli p s : the absence of evidence from
the ori ginal ocean sediment cores simply
r e flected the ve ry broad-brush picture they
g ave of temperature change. They lacked
the detail offered by ice-cores.
Prompted by the Greenland fin d i n g s ,
scientists have since tracked down locat i o n s
where ocean sediment builds up fa s t
enough to gi ve a record of temperat u r e
comparable in detail to that from the ice-
c o r e s. A n d , sure enough, they reveal the
same story of rapid climatic change in loca-
tions as far apart as California and India.
The history of science shows that fin-
ding evidence for some astonishing pheno-
menon is often only part of the story. To
c o nvince the scientific community at large,
the evidence has to be backed up by a more
comprehensive explanation.And for many
years the standard explanation for why Ice
Ages begin and end provided yet more rea-
sons for thinking all climatic change must
be slow and graceful.
T h at explanation rests on work by a Ser-
bian scientist named Milutin Milankov i t c h ,
who in 1920 linked Ice Ages to changes in the
shape of the eart h ’s orbit.Caused by the push
and pull of the other planets, these orbital
changes altered the concentration of sunlight
reaching the planet. Such changes would
n aturally take place ve ry gr a d u a l l y, on times-
cales of many thousands of ye a rs—a recipe
for climatic change that is anything but
a b ru p t .
A global heat
transporter
Yet, once again, there is a loophole in
this comforting argument—as Wa l l a c e
Broecker of Columbia University, New
York Stat e , realized around the time
climate experts were puzzling over the
ice-core data.
This loophole centres on a ve ry specific
feature of the earth’s oceans:their circula-
tion pat t e rn s. Ocean currents transport
heat around the globe like a vast conveyor
b e l t . In the A t l a n t i c, for example, wa rm
water travels northwards from the Gulf of
Mexico, passing its heat to the air by eva-
poration as it goes.This makes the current
p r o gr e s s i vely cooler, saltier and denser until
e ve n t u a l l y, near Iceland, the water is so
heavy that it sinks, and begins a long jour-
ney southward,along the ocean floor.
Broecker realized that this complex,
subtle process—which he called “ T h e
Conveyor”—could be the Achilles heel of
the eart h ’s climat e ,a l l owing subtle changes
to be turned into dramatic upheava l . Fo r
instead of having to alter the whole body
of the oceans, just a small change in tem-
p e r ature might be enough to alter the beha-
The history of science shows

often only part of the story.

viour of the Conve yor—and trigger radical
and rapid climatic change over a large area.
For example,gradually melting ice from
the Arctic could dilute the saltiness of the
Conveyor to a critical density where it no
longer sinks and begins its journey south-
ward to pick up more heat.The Conveyor
would, in effect, be switched off, isolating
the north Atlantic from the wa rming wat e rs
of the tropics.The result would then be dis-
tinctly paradox i c a l , with a slight wa rming of
the Arctic causing temperatures of nort h
Atlantic countries to plunge.
B r o e c k e r ’s explanation is now widely
believed to lie at the heart of rapid climate
change in the past. Wo rry i n g l y, h owe ve r ,
global warming is predicted to have preci-
sely the type of warming effect on the Arc-
tic ice that threatens the existence of the
C o nve yo r. Computer projections of the
effect of pollution on global temperatures
predict an inflow of cold, fresh water into
the nort h e rn A t l a n t i c — water that could
dilute the Conve yor enough to switch it off.
The Achilles heel 
of the earth’s climate
If that happened, s ays Broecker, w i n t e r
temperatures in the north Atlantic region
would fall by 10 or more degrees Celsius
within 10 years, giving places like Dublin
the climate of Spitsbergen, 400 km north of
the Arctic Circle.“The consequences could
be devastating,” he says.
It is a scenario that gains credibility from
ice-core dat a , according to climate expert
K e n d rick Taylor of the Desert Research Ins-
titute in Reno, N e va d a . He says that many
cores suggest that around 8,000 ye a rs ago
there was a sudden plunge back to a “mini Ice
A g e ” which lasted around 400 ye a rs. T h e
most likely cause, s ays Tay l o r ,was the release
of melted ice-water from lakes in Canada into
the A t l a n t i c, which switched off the heat -
t r a n s p o rting Conve yo r.
“The change in freshwater flux to the
oceans was large, but not that much diffe-
rent from what gr e e n h o u s e - i n d u c e d
changes may produce in the future,” he said
in a recent paper in A m e rican Scientist. “It is
ironic that greenhouse warming may lead
to rapid cooling in eastern NorthernAme-
rica,Europe and Scandinavia.”
So just how close is the Conve yor to
switching off once again? The short answe r
is: no one knows. Computer models have
still to identify the critical density of sea-
water at which the Conve yor will switch off,
or the greenhouse gas concentrations nee-
ded to release the requisite amount of melt-
water.
Cutting pollution 
buys time
W h at computer models have show n ,
s ays Tay l o r , is that reducing pollution emis-
sions buys time—both by slowing the rate
of global warming, and also by driving the
c l i m ate more gently, which seems to
increase its stability against rapid change.
But while scientists struggle to capture
the full complexity of the climate on their
s u p e r c o m p u t e rs , evidence of other causes
of dramatic climate change is beginning to
e m e r g e .
Last July, Professor Martin Claussen and
his colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for
C l i m ate Science, G e rm a ny, r e p o rted evi-
dence that today ’s Sahara desert was creat e d
Photographed through a polarized light microscope, a cross-section of a 100,000-year-old ice-core 
from the Antarctic.

in a sudden climatic “ fli p ” t h at took place
just 5,500 ye a rs ago, t u rning vast areas of
lush grassland into an arid wilderness and
d e va s t ating ancient civilizat i o n s.
Using a sophisticated computer model
of the land, sea and atmosphere, the team
has discovered just how subtle are some of
the effects that can turn Milankov i t c h - s t y l e
changes in the earth’s orbit into major cli-
mate upheaval.
The Sahara’s quick-change act
They found that over the last 9,000
ye a rs the gr av i t ational pull of the planets
has altered the tilt of the eart h ’s axis by
about half a degr e e , and changed the timing
of eart h ’s closest approach to the sun by
around five months.
By themselves, such subtle changes
should not cause major climatic effects.
But when Claussen and his colleagues
included the effect of vegetation in their
computer model, they found that it cau-
sed rainfall levels to plummet over the
Sahara region.
They traced the cause to “ f e e d b a c k ”
effects,in which a slight drop in vegetation
l e vel makes the eart h ’s surface slightly bet-
ter at reflecting sunlight, which causes rain-
fall levels to drop—prompting more vege-
tation loss,and so on.
According to Claussen, these feedback
effects turned the va s t , o n c e - green Sahara
into a brown wasteland within just 300 ye a rs.
“It was the largest change in land cove r
d u ring the last 6,000 ye a rs ,” he say s.“It wa s
ve ry seve r e , ruining ancient civilizat i o n s.”
The discove ry is likely to force histo-
rians to rethink their explanations of eve n t s
in the regi o n . For according to Claussen, i t
contradicts the long-held belief that the col-
lapse of agriculture in the region was cau-
sed by ancient farmers exhausting the soil:
“Although humans lived in the Sahara and
used the land to some extent, we think that
ancient land use played only a negligi b l y
small role.”
The findings are also being seen as ano-
ther wa rning of just how unstable eve n
t o d ay ’s climate may be. “It is capable of
c h a n ging ve ry abru p t l y,” s ays climat e
expert Andrew Goudie of Oxford Univer-
s i t y. “ We ’ ve known that the extent of the
Sahara has yo-yoed back and forwards for
millions of ye a rs , and that about 8,000
ye a rs ago it was much wetter than today,
with big rivers feeding into the Nile. But I
h a d n ’t realized just how rapid the chan-
geover had been.It is salutary.”
Temperature 
nose-dives
Also in July, a team of researchers from
the unive rsities of Illinois and Minnesota
reported the discovery of another climatic
“flip” in the northern hemisphere around
9,000 ye a rs ago, which temporarily plunged
the region back into an Ice Age.
Using lake sediments from Minnesota,
the team confirmed the existence of the

evidence for another dive in temperatures
around 8,300 to 8,900 ye a rs ago.The team
thinks this older cold snap was linked to
the release of melted ice from lakes into the
Atlantic—which may have switched off the
C o nve yo r. But the researchers now think
t h at the more recent flip most likely had
another—and as yet unknown—origin.
W h at is clear is that until we know
much more about the complexity of climat e
change, all bets about how much time we
have to take action are definitely off.What
evidence we do have increasingly points to
the stark possibility that we may have fa r
less time than we thought.
“I used to believe that change in climat e
happened slowly and would never affect
me,” admits Taylor. “Now I know that our
c l i m ate could change significantly in my
lifetime.” n
