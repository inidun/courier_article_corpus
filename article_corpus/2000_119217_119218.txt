P OTOSI’S 
SILV ER TEARS

The city that once made Europe rich is dying. 
The impoverished miners who live there are struggling 
to survive amid the ruins of its bygone splendour
Deep within Potosi’s Cerro Rico (“Rich Mountain”), silver miners sometimes work more than 10 hours a day.

“ I t ’s so poor, it makes you want to
we e p,” s ays Bolivian historian Va l e n-
tin A b e c i a . H e ’s not exaggerat i n g . A
visit to Po t o s i , which helped to maintain the
splendour of Europe from the 16th to the
18th centuri e s , is today a spine-chilling
experience.
Around two billion ounces of silver we r e
extracted from the city’s Cerro Rico (Rich
Mountain) during the Spanish colonial era.
C e rro Rico silver paved Po t o s i ’s streets, f u e l-
led the European Renaissance and helped
fund the “ I nvincible A rm a d a ” , the Spanish
fleet that sailed against Elizabethan England
in 1588.
But today Potosi is dying. “When a mine
c l o s e s , all that ’s left is a ghost tow n ,” s ay s
the city’s mayo r , René Jo a q u i n o. S o m e t h i n g
of Potosi ebbs away whenever a seam of
metal is exhausted or world mineral prices
d r o p. Most of the mines closed down after a
c risis in 1985 and many people left for good.
Two ye a rs lat e r , when the Bolivian gove rn-
ment introduced new incentives to mining,
u n e m p l oyed miners began to trickle back
and set up 50 co-operatives.
Streets paved with silver
Most of the city’s population of around
120,000 are Quechua Indians,who live by
scratching at what is left in the old mines.
They have no access to modern techno-
logy and no social security protection.T h e r e
is practically no middle class in Potosi. “I
d o n ’t know any rich people who live in this
c i t y,” s ays A b e c i a .“Some have made money
here but then they left to live elsewhere.T h e
old houses are falling into ruins, and their
furniture and fittings have been removed.
The few things that have been preserved are
in the Casa de la Moneda (the Roya l

P O V ERTY ON A SILV ER THRONE
M ining has always been Potosi’s lifeblood.
Modern prospecting technology has disco-
vered that the mountain still contains at least as
much silver as the Spaniards extracted from it. The
Bolivian government has invited foreign firms to
bid for the contract to mine it.
In recent months, argument has focused on
what form the new mining operations should take.
Should the top of the mountain be cut off—this
would be the cheapest method but it would disfi-
gure the mountain—or should a horizontal tunnel
be bored through to the heart of the ore-bearing
r o c k s ?
Geologist Jaime Villalobos, a former Bolivian
minister of mines, says “most of the ore is concen-
trated inside the peak. El Cerro’s rock has lots of
m i n e ral seams of different sizes suitable for
modern methods of extraction. It’s economica l l y
feasible to remove all the rock, crush it and process
it. The cheapest way to extract it would be the
open-cast method.”
This means cutting into the top of a mountain
that is a national emblem. The people of Potosi are
against that: 97 per cent of them said in a poll they
would rather starve than see the silhouette of El
Cerro disappear and, with it, the World Heritage title.
They would prefer to see a horizontal shaft
bored, as UNES CO has advised. However, this
option is more expensive. It means digging the shaft
and extracting the ore while preserving the shape of
the mountain. When he was minister, Villalobos says
his investigations showed the Cerro contained
“more than half a million tons of silver-bearing ore.
But that doesn’t mean it’s economica l l y feasible to
e x t ract because a lot of it is low - g rade ore.” The
company that wins the contract to mine the moun-
tain will have to study this.
People in Potosi show discontent when they talk
about mining. Villalobos understands. Mining, he
says, “whether in colonial times, or whether by the
private sector or by the state-owned Bolivian Mining
C o r p o ration, has taken non-renewable resources
from the area and left behind only contamination
and poverty. This project should have a built-in gua-
rantee to create wealth for Potosi,” he says. ■

b e t ween 18 and 50 were ordered to work in
the mines. They were paid a pittance and
rarely saw the light of day.Eighty per cent of
the male population of the 16 provinces of
the viceroyalty of Pe ru died in these condi-
t i o n s.“ E ve ry peso coin minted in Potosi has
cost the life of 10 Indians who have died in
the depths of the mines,”wrote Fray A n t o n i o
de la Calancha in 1638.
Mining methods have changed little ove r
the ye a rs.The miners still toil from dawn till
d u s k .G e n e r at o rs pump air into the tunnels
so they can breat h e .Children still wriggle into
t i ny places where adults cannot go.Wo r k i n g
sometimes for 10 hours or more a day in
extreme temperat u r e s , the miners keep going
by chewing coca leave s. Two-thirds of the
p o p u l ation have respirat o ry ailments.
“Barely 20 per cent of the mine-wo r k e rs
are actually members of the co-operat i ve s ,”
says Joaquino. “The other 80 per cent are
casual labourers who earn next to nothing.
They are peasant migrants from the nort h ,
the poorest part of the department of which
Potosi is the capital.”
The historic centre of Po t o s i , w h e r e
the Spanish settlers once live d , is today
home to a small middle class. It is ringed by
a pove rty belt inhabited by miners who
work in the co-operat i ve s. Both these areas
are surrounded by a wider pove rty belt
filled with those who have fled the hunger
of the countryside to hire themselves out as
unskilled labourers in the mines.
Peasant women from the north come to
the city to beg. They sleep on the gr o u n d
in the markets, numb with cold, cradling in
their arms the babies they have brought
with them. B e rnardina Soles has had 10
c h i l d r e n . F i ve of them have died—a gri m
reminder of an infant mortality rate of 135
per 1,000. Her dream is to take some of her
children away from her home village, w h e r e
they could only have two ye a rs of pri m a ry
s c h o o l i n g .The illiteracy rate in the depart-
ment of Potosi is 30.8 per cent.
Lost splendour
“ Potosi society is rotten with ostentat i o n
and extrava g a n c e ,” s ays Uru g u ayan wri t e r
Eduardo Galeano, “ but the memory of its
past splendours still lingers and it still has
the ruins of its churches and palaces.”UN E S C O
is backing restoration projects for about 2,000
colonial buildings and is monitoring the
c o n s e rvation of the Cerro Rico, where the
mining installations dating from colonial
times are historic monuments.They include
t u n n e l s , e q u i p m e n t , m i l l s , f u rnaces and a
n e t work of 22 art i ficial pools built by V i c e r oy
Toledo to help power the equipment.
“I remember that when I was a boy the
Cerro was a perfect cone, a beautiful red
mountain just south of the city,” s ays A b e c i a .
“But over the past 50 ye a rs , it has aged, b e e n
hacked about and fallen apart .The co-ope-
r at i ves have extracted so much rock from it
that it doesn’t look the same any more.”
UN E S C O’s main goal is to convince the Boli-
vian authorities to take steps to preserve as
World Heritage a site which Spanish chro-
n i c l e rs regarded as a “perfect and endu-
ring wonder of the world”. ■
