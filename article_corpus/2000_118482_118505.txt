“I wo u l d n ’t think of trading n ow, in spite
of the constant shortage of money and
the incessant struggle to find it, for the
seemingly carefree t h e n with its guaranteed
100 per cent budget allocat i o n ,” s ays Mikhail
P i o t r ov s k y,director of St. Pe t e rs bu r g ’s Stat e
H e rmitage Museum.
P i o t r ovsky knows what he is talking
a b o u t , because he has seen, and has been to,
both wo r l d s.The son of the Herm i t a g e ’s pre-
vious long-time director, P i o t r ovsky was vir-
tually born in the museum, which is housed
in the magnificent imperial Winter Pa l a c e
and is home to one of the wo r l d ’s richest art
c o l l e c t i o n s. He trod all 350 rooms of the
palace as a toddler,and inherited his fat h e r ’s
d e d i c ation to the ancient art of the Ori e n t .
From early childhood he was also expo-
sed to museum administration as a kind of
family bu s i n e s s. “My father did not have to
think of all the countless financial problems
we are facing now,” he say s.“But eve ry step
he took had to be approved by Ministry of
Culture bu r e a u c r ats in Moscow.The cur-
rent lack or shortage of funding is the pri c e
we pay for freedom to make our own deci-
s i o n s.We must preserve this freedom.”
Although this idea sounds like simple
common sense, it is revo l u t i o n a ry for the
H e rmitage even now. For nearly two and a
half centuri e s , since its beginning as a
modest domestic collection of Russia’s impe-
rial Romanov dynasty, the Hermitage wa s
an ivo ry tower of art , far removed from the
mundane and ignoble need to earn its daily
b r e a d . It was cheri s h e d , both by the T s a r ’s
g ove rnment and later by the Po l i t buro of the
ruling communist part y, as a symbol of the
s t at e ’s wealth and might, and promptly and
regularly received generous budget alloca-
t i o n s.
The break-up of the Soviet Union at the
end of 1991 brought freedom from we a ri-
some bu r e a u c r ats but also brought the digni-
fied museum up against an entirely new pro-
b l e m : chronic failure by the gove rnment to
f u l fil its budget obligat i o n s. E ven in relat i-
vely stable 1996, the gove rnment approve d
$40 million instead of the $60 million the
museum requested.W h at the museum recei-
ved in fact totalled no more than $18 mil-
l i o n . In 1997, n ow looked back upon as the
most successful year in Russia’s post-com-
munist history, the Hermitage requested $90
m i l l i o n , $30 million were approved and a
m e a gre $12 million actually allocat e d . I n
1 9 9 8 , $7.4 million were requested and $ 5 . 4
million were approve d , but the Museum
actually received only $2.7 million.
H owe ve r ,P i o t r ovsky remembers 1992,
when he was appointed director, as the most
d i f ficult ye a r.This was not only because he,
a distinguished scholar in Arabic history,
was suddenly faced with tedious routine
a d m i n i s t r at i o n , but also because the Her-
m i t a g e , like the rest of Russia’s cultural ins-
t i t u t i o n s , had to learn how to swim in the
t u r bulent wat e rs of the ruthless initial stage
of the market economy. Subsidies were dras-
tically cut; there was ru n away
i n flat i o n ; and there was not even enough
money for basic maintenance of the bu i l-
d i n g, let alone expanding and deve l o p i n g
the collection.
An influx of advisers and part n e rs did
not make decision-making any easier.T h e y
often made contradictory recommenda-
t i o n s , and their business reputations we r e
d i f ficult to ve ri f y.T h e n , along with the Bol-
shoi T h e atre and Moscow ’s Lenin Library,
the Hermitage was selected as a UN E S C O
flagship project in Russia.An intern at i o n a l

Museum of A rt in Fo rt Wo rt h ,Te x a s ,c a m e

loped into the Intern ational A d v i s o ry Board,

in the intern ational museum world inclu-

ton and London, the Philadelphia A rt

on a vo l u n t a ry basis, meets in St. Pe t e rs bu r g
once a year.

UNESCO used a massive development plan
worked out by the team as a foundation for
grant proposals, and in 1994 the first major
gift of $1.2 million came from the govern-

T HE HERMI TAGE COMES OU T
OF ITS SHEL L
w Alexander Kan
Long swathed in bureaucratic red tape and cushioned by hefty state funding, the great
St. Petersburg museum is adapting as best it can to the rigours of the global marketplace
w Russian journalist and editor 
with the BBC World Service

including such boring but essential things
as accounting software and feasibility stu-
dies on hy d r o - i s o l ation of flooding in the
basement.”
The same grant made it possible for a
group of Hermitage restorers to take
the famous Rovinski collection—640 Rem-
brandt etchings and prints—for restorat i o n
at the Rijksmuseum in A m s t e r d a m , at the
same time making valuable contacts with
their Dutch colleagues. N ow a foundat i o n
in the Netherlands has decided that it wo u l d
be a good idea to raise money for a Herm i-
tage room or rooms in Amsterdam.A per-
manently rotating exhibition,called “Her-
mitage on the Amstel”,is in the works.
In October 1999 it was announced that
the Hermitage would take the same “ s at e l-
lite museum” idea to London, where it plans
to open a permanent exhibition space at
S o m e rset House, an 18th-century mansion
which is the home of the Courtauld Insti-
t u t e ,B ri t a i n ’s leading college of art history,
and a gallery with an outstanding collection
of Impressionist and neo-Impressionist
paintings.
F u n d r a i s i n g, a concept so new for Rus-
sia that a proper Russian term does not eve n
exist to describe it, is suddenly becoming
an increasingly important source of the Her-
m i t a g e ’s reve n u e s.While the federal contri-
bution to the annual budget keeps fa l l i n g
(from 70 per cent in 1997 to 61 per cent
in 1998),takings from the gate have fallen
e ven more drastically. In 1989 the Herm i-
tage had 3.5 million visitors ; in 1998 the
figure had plunged to 1.8 million.
Since most visitors are Russians, w h o
p ay a ve ry lenient 15 roubles (less than a
dollar) per ticket, takings cannot really pro-
vide a substantial slice of the budget.True,
foreign visitors have to pay considerably
more—250 roubles ($10), but Piotrov s k y
has no qualms about justifying this double
pricing policy.
“Russian citizens have already paid their
dues to the museum via taxe s ,” he say s ,“ s o
t h e y ’re fully entitled to a discount, and so
are children and students of any nationali-
t y.C riticism of double pricing usually comes
from tourist operat o rs who once used to bu y
our cheap tickets and resell them to forei-
gn tourists at a 1,000 per cent margin.”
Russians simply cannot afford more
In Catherine the Great’s winter Palace, above, there is only room to display 5 per cent of the Hermitage’s collections. Plans are now underway to provide additional space.
e x p e n s i ve tickets.The average monthly sala-
ry of a Hermitage curat o r , at 1,000-1,500
roubles ($40-$60) far from the lowest in the
country, proves the point.
Another potential source of reve n u e -
museum shops—has not been a pri o rity for
the same reason.While the Russian public’s
buying capacity remains ve ry low, m a j o r
i nvestment to develop proper merchandi-
sing would not be worthwhile.
This brings us back to fundraising, a n d
the extreme importance eve rybody I talked
t o — P i o t r ov s k y, G i b s o n ,P i l l s bu ry— at t a-
ched to the fact that the Herm i t a g e , firs t
among Russian cultural institutions, m a k e s
its annual budget,calculated with the help
of software purchased with the Dutch
g ove rn m e n t ’s gi f t , publicly available and
transparent.
“This is a revo l u t i o n a ry change,” s ay s
Nicholas Hoffman, an A m e rican fundrai-
sing specialist who helped the Herm i t a g e ’s
newly created Development Depart m e n t
to work out fundraising strat e gies and learn
the complex techniques of putting them into
practice.“There has been a dramatic lear-
ning curve . People at the museum have fig u-
red out that donors really have to see the
results of their money and feel confident it
i s n ’t being wa s t e d ,h i d d e n , mismanaged or
e ven stolen. So far the Hermitage has done
better than any other institution in Russia
The break-up
of the Soviet Union at
the end of 19 91 brought
the museum up against
an entirely new problem

at that . I t ’s not perfect, and it’s not nearly
as easy as it would be for a foundation to
gi ve money to, s ay, the Metropolitan
Museum of A rt in New Yo r k , if only becau-
se the Met has had 30 or 40 more ye a rs of
practice doing this.”
P i o t r ovsky likes to point out that 10
ye a rs ago, the overall budget of the Herm i-
tage was one per cent of that of the Metro-
politan.Now it’s 10 per cent—still in a dif-
ferent league, but he is justifiably proud of
the tenfold growth.
Among the more recent successful
m atches between the Hermitage and major
corporations is the elaborate bilingual web
site developed with the help of a two - m i l-
lion-dollar grant from IBM. And eve n
though the digital library represents so fa r
only a small share of the museum’s enor-
mous 2.5-million-exhibit collection, it is “ s o
advanced that it puts the Hermitage at the
forefront of the wo r l d ’s museums in the use
of computer technology,”c o n fidently claims
Dr. Pillsbury.
I couldn’t help asking Piotrovsky whe-
ther among the gr owing number of We s t e rn
d o n o rs and sponsors there are any mem-
bers of Russia’s burgeoning business com-
munity.“It takes generations for new busi-
ness people to become genuine art donors ,”
he says,“and it would be wrong to say that
Russian businesses are lining up to give us
their money. On the other hand, we recent-
ly had a major breakthrough— a seri o u s
donation from Vladimir Potanin,the foun-
der and owner of the United Export Import
Bank (UN E X I M) and one of Russia’s we a l-
thiest men.”
M r. Po t a n i n ’s office explained that his
d o n ation “will be used for creating the new
H e rmitage exhibition to be opened later this
year in the General Staff building.” Half of
this crescent-shaped neoclassical bu i l d i n g,
which along with the baroque Winter Pa l a-
ce forms St. Pe t e rs bu r g ’s Palace Square, h a s
been gi ven to the Hermitage and is sche-
duled to be developed in a project called the
G r e ater Herm i t a g e .The additional space
will increase the proportion of the collec-
tion on public display from the current five
per cent to 10-15 per cent.
The ori ginal idea was to create a new
Museum of Applied and Decorat i ve A rt to
ri val London’s V i c t o ria and A l b e rt Museum
and the Pa ris Musée des A rts Décorat i f s.
H owe ve r , museums of decorat i ve arts tend
to attract less visitors than collections of pain-
tings and sculpture.
Then the Intern ational A d v i s o ry Board
proposed a radical solution—to move the
famous Impressionist collection from the
Winter Palace to the new bu i l d i n g .The firs t
step has already been taken. Huge canva s e s

by French painters Maurice Denis and Pier-
re Bonnard, n e ver previously exhibited, a r e
on display in a few newly renovated rooms
of the General Staff bu i l d i n g .
“ R e l o c ating the Impressionists is abso-
lutely the right move ,”muses Russian art cri-
tic Kira Dolinina. “They have been tradi-
tionally exhibited on the second floor of the
Winter Palace with its low ceilings, c r a m m e d
into small rooms where in summer it is so
unbearably hot that the wardens have to
open the window s ,which damages the pain-
t i n g s.The collection is extremely popular
and in the new building it will be considered
in a new way. It is definitely wo rth a sepa-
r ate museum. But is it conceptually compa-
tible with the applied and decorat i ve arts? In
fact we are talking of two different museums.
The big museums that have recently exten-
ded their premises—the Rijksmuseum, t h e
L o u v r e , the National Gallery in London—
all found conceptual solutions before they
actually set out for the major move . For the
time being the artistic idea of the Great e r
H e rmitage looks ve ry va g u e .”
An ambitious project
M e a n w h i l e , the tireless Piotrovsky is set
on a more ambitious project. He has plans
for turning the entire Greater Hermitage into
a cultural and commercial centre with a
c o n c e rt hall, c i n e m a ,r e s t a u r a n t s ,h o t e l ,g a l-
l e ries and shops.The overall cost of the pro-
ject is estimated at $150 million, and Pio-
t r ovsky in his frequent visits to London and
New York is actively seeking inve s t o rs and
a deve l o p e r. This is a long-term project,
aimed rather at the museum’s 250th anni-
ve rs a ry in 2014 than the city’s tercentena-
ry in 2003.
So is the Hermitage an exceptional suc-
cess story in an otherwise dim Russian land-
scape? On the one hand it definitely is. A n
undisputed leader among Russian museums,
headed by a confid e n t ,i n t e rn ationally res-
pected director, it is slowly claiming its place
amongst the wo r l d ’s best, not only by the
scope and grandeur of its collection but by
the scale of its development plans. On the
o t h e r , it remains ove r burdened by an under-
d e veloped infrastructure and excess staff,
some of whom have trouble unders t a n d i n g
and accepting the ever accelerating pace of
c h a n g e .
So far the Hermitage has been able to
keep its yo u n g e r , competent and dedicat e d
staff who are prepared to moonlight as cab
d ri ve rs so that during the day they can return
to the world of art . In short , the museum is
a rather optimistic microcosm of the coun-
t ry it lives in. If the entire country can thru s t
itself into the third millennium as confid e n t l y
as the Hermitage seems to be doing, t h e
museum itself will have much less reason for
c o n c e rn . n
Fu n d raising is a concept so
n ew for Russia that a proper
Russian term does not
exist to describe it
