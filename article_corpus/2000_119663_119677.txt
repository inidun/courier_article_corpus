For thousands of ye a rs , fa rm e rs have used the
genetic va ri ation in wild and cultivated plants to
d e velop their crops and raise new breeds of live-
s t o c k . Genetic dive rsity gi ves species the ability to
adapt to changing env i r o n m e n t s , including new pests
and diseases and new climatic conditions. P l a n t
genetic resources—that component of genetic dive r-
sity of actual or potential use to humanity—prov i d e
the raw mat e rial for breeding new va rieties of crops.

Genetic diversity 
and food s e c u r i t y
◗ Geoffrey C. H a w t i n
Maintaining a diversity of crops and varieties is a key to survival for millions 
of farmers living on impoverished land

improving the world’s ability to feed itself over the
past three decades, we cannot afford to rest idle.
Nearly 800 million people in the developing wo r l d
do not have enough to eat.1 In these regions, the
rural poor represent about 73 per cent of the people
living in pove rt y. They often live in marginal or
unsuitable fa rming areas, such as zones with saline
soils, arid conditions, or degraded or hilly areas.
Often isolated from other fa rms and far from urban
a r e a s , m a ny poor fa rm e rs have barely benefit e d
from agricultural developments elsewhere. In many
cases they do not have access to commercially bred
high yielding crop va ri e t i e s. D i ve rsity flo u ri s h e s
and remains important under such conditions.
Selections and breeding
Poor fa rm e rs are well aware of the relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween the stability and sustainability of their pro-
duction systems and the dive rsity of crops and crop
va rieties on their lands.Their management and use
of a dive rse range of plants has often helped them to
s u rv i ve under the most difficult conditions. By gr o-
wing a range of different crops, fa rm e rs have a better
chance of meeting their needs.These might be crops
t h at mature at different times or that can be easily
stored to help to ensure a stable food supply throu-
ghout the ye a r.They may also help fa rm e rs prov i d e
a nutritionally balanced diet for their fa m i l i e s ,e x p l o i t
different environmental niches that exist on their
l a n d , or dive rsify their income sources.
I m p o rt a n t l y, the genetic dive rsity contained in dif-
ferent va rieties provides fa rm e rs with options to deve-
l o p, through selection and breeding, new and more
p r o d u c t i ve crops that are resistant to pests and diseases.
The result may be a vast range of local va rieties of crops
gr own by fa rm e rs in any one area. In the A n d e s ,f o r
e x a m p l e , fa rming communities use about 3,000 dif-
ferent va rieties of potat o e s , and in Java fa rm e rs may
plant more than 600 species in a single home garden.
Not respecting dive rsity can incur high costs: i n
1 8 t h - c e n t u ry Ireland, where potatoes were the only
s i g n i ficant source of food for about one third of the
p o p u l at i o n , fa rm e rs came to rely almost entirely on
one ve ry fertile and productive va ri e t y, which prove d
susceptible to the deva s t ating potato blight fungus.
The resulting famine caused the death or emigra-
tion of more than 20 per cent of the population.
The value of diversity goes well beyond its abi-
lity to support stable production systems in margi n a l
e nv i r o n m e n t s. As the wo r l d ’s human populat i o n
ri s e s ,e nvironmental problems (desert i fic at i o n, d e f o-
r e s t at i o n , e r o s i o n , e t c.) are intensifying. C l i m at e
c h a n g e , p a rticularly global wa rm i n g, could bri n g
about drastic changes in the location of the wo r l d ’s
a gr o - e c o l o gical zones. Fa rm e rs will require new crop
va rieties capable of producing under dive rse condi-
t i o n s , without adding ever-increasing amounts of fer-
t i l i z e rs and other agr o - c h e m i c a l s. Because of the
limited scope for gr owth in the wo r l d ’s cultivat e d
a r e a s , each new generation of va rieties will have to be
more productive than its predecessors.
Much has been written about the use of genetic
e n gi n e e ring in plant breeding. M o d e rn molecular
techniques can be used to transfer genes from one
living organism to another or to change the genetic
m at e rial within to produce more desirable traits.
Genetic engi n e e ring has enormous potential to help
s o l ve problems that have proved intractable using
c o nventional breeding approaches, such as deve l o p i n g

crop va rieties with in-built resistance to key pests and
diseases and tolerance to stresses such as drought.
H owe ve r , the possible impact of these techniques,p a r-
ticularly on human health and the env i r o n m e n t , i s
giving rise to fierce worldwide debat e .
Take the case of banana and its close relative
p l a n t a i n ,t wo of the developing wo r l d ’s most impor-
tant crops.Their improvement is hindered by the
sterility of most cultivars, a problem that can be
addressed through genetic engineering. It is now
possible to transfer gene constructs, such as those
a s s o c i ated with disease resistance, directly into
varieties with other desirable characteristics, dras-
tically reducing the need for pesticides. Currently,
many crops are sprayed more than 40 times with
fungicides to control the devastating banana and
plantain disease,Black Sigat o k a .The first transgenic
banana and plantain plants have been produced
and are now undergoing testing.
To d ay, research on genetic engi n e e ring is focused
on the development of commercial va rieties of the
wo r l d ’s major crops of interest to industrialized fa r-
m e rs. M a ny of the staple crops of importance to poor
fa rm e rs in developing countri e s , such as cassava ,b a n a-
n a s , beans and ya m s ,h ave received relat i vely little
at t e n t i o n .This situation is likely to continue as plant
breeding is increasingly pri vatized and biotechnology
becomes the fa s t - gr owing province of pri vate indus-
t ry. M e a n w h i l e , the high costs of the new technolo-
gies are quickly exceeding the capacity of many, if not
m o s t , public research institutions—both in deve l o-
ping and developed countries—to support them.T h u s ,
for the time being, increasing agri c u l t u r e ’s role in the
d e velopment of the wo r l d ’s poor is likely to continue to
depend on the identific at i o n , maintenance and use of
genetic dive rs i t y. ■
