THE BIRTH OF A LANGUAGE

LATIN American writers have de¬
veloped a complex about the lan¬
guage in which they write because
they have always felt that it was not their
own. Many writers of metropolitan
Spain, especially purists, have encouraged
this feeling by assuming proprietary
rights over the Spanish language and
relegating Latin American literature to
the status of a mere offshoot of Spanish
literature. This attitude was summed up
by the Spanish essayist and novelist
Azorin (1874-1967), who frankly declared
at the beginning of the century that "we
are the souls of the language".
Philologists and linguists have tried
to explain this phenomenon which simul¬
taneously united and separated writers on
each side of the Atlantic. There is a lin¬
guistic "system" which for obvious
historical and political reasons is called
Castilian or Spanish. This system has
variants within Spain and, with much
greater justification, in Latin America.
The substrata of Amerindian languages,
the influence, in regions such as the
Caribbean, of African languages and of
contributions by immigrants, as well as
the language of creative writers, have
profoundly marked the phonetic modu¬
lations, word-structures, syntax and
vocabulary of Latin American Spanish.
They have strongly influenced and
impregnated this language which has been
used for centuries, but they have not
destroyed the unity of the system. It is
the same Spanish language, variegated and
enrichedwhy not?by contributions
which reflect the cultural and historical
context of Latin America.
This situation is the result of a long,
hard struggle, often waged in obscurity,
to achieve and assert a cultural identity.
The struggle finally bore fruit in the
twentieth century. The theory of the
Spanish linguistic system and its variants
is the expression of a linguistic situation
that clearly appeared at a specific moment
in the history of Latin American
literaturethe moment when Latin
American writers lost their inferiority
complex vis-à-vis their Iberian colleagues
and dared to assume their language. This
turning point marked the emergence of
a literature, initially poetic but later
predominantly narrative, which asserted
the continent's cultural identity through
works of exceptional quality which
testified to an original presence on the
contemporary literary scene.
Language is not the only determin¬
ing factor in the flowering of Latin
American literature in recent decades. But
in my opinion it is a decisive factor, if not
the principal one, because the full as¬
sumption of one's own language shapes
the balance of expression and the prac¬
tice, without complexes or culpability, of
letters.
The Archives Collection (see article
page 18) is revealing this decisive stage in
the evolution of twentieth-century Latin
American literature, through its mission
to represent the entire continent, and
through its methodology which en¬
courages the study of the original text and
its variants. "Readings" by specialists
representing a variety of trends in con¬
temporary literary criticism highlight
different aspects of each work. A mul-
tidisciplinary approach is used in the

preparation of critical editions in which
the study of details is combined with an
analysis of the wider significance of the
work in question.
Since the Archives Collection com¬
prises works produced since the begin¬
ning of the century, it enables the reader
to follow the development of Latin
American writing from its last stage of in¬
security to its affirmation as a literature
which has discovered its mode of expres¬
sion. Since all Latin American countries
are represented, the reader has a com¬
plete, comparative view of the variants
which exist within the linguistic system
outlined above. The Collection also illus¬
trates a basic fact about the linguistic sit¬
uation in Latin America. What, by
reference to a narrow, repressive critical
tradition, was once regarded as a form of
inadequacy, a blameworthy fault, a vice
that contaminated the "purity" of the
Castilian tongue, is actually a source of
enrichment to a changing language. Few
languages, in fact, are nourished from so
many sources as Spanish. This fact is now
accepted by the writers and even by the
academics of Spain, and is helping the
members of both communities to under¬
stand each other more fully and to feel
that they belong to the same cultural
community.
The Archives Collection is contribut¬
ing to the search for, or rather to the
affirmation of, the Latin American iden¬
tity. One area unexplored in this search,
although it concerns the roots of Latin
American identity, is that of the Amer¬
indian literatures. At the first plenary
session of ALLCA, the Latin American,
Caribbean and African 20th-century
Literary Archives Association, a proposal
was approved for the publication of texts
from this deep-rooted, predominantly
oral form of expression before it disap-
