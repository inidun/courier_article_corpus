a bridge 
spanning tWo Worlds
           at the end of the 19th century, Martín alberto de palacio y elissague 
                   was given the task of building a bridge over the Nervión, 
    in the Basque country (spain), with one prerequisite: uninterrupted river traffic. 
to meet the challenge, the engineer dreamed up the first metallic bridge with a gondola.
«O  n Bilbao’s ria is the first trans-
porter bridge ever built in the 
world. It is gigantic, splendid and 
made of metal beams like the Eiffel 
tower.” These were the induce-
ments for taking us to Las Arenas 
when we were children, to see the 
Biscay Transporter Bridge, an ar-
chitectural masterpiece combining 
functionality and esthetics. 
As for my grandfather, he would 
explain that when he was a child, 
the place looked like a rubbish 
dump, and the only attraction was 
the bridge. He would also say that 
the bridge united two worlds - the 
right bank, attractive and mani-
cured, country retreat for rich peo-
ple, and the left bank, ugly and ill-
kempt, where the factory workers 
lived. 
The transporter bridge joins the 
two banks of the Nervión at its 
mouth, it is made entirely of iron 
and it is 160 metres long. Resting 
“On Bilbao’s ria is 
the first transporter bridge 
ever built in the world. 
It is gigantic, splendid 
and made of metal beams like 
the Eiffel tower.” 
on four towers 43 metres high, it 
boasts the singularity of incorpo-
rating a suspended “gondola” to 
transport passengers, vehicles 
and merchandise. 
The bridge was thought up more 
than a century ago by the Biscayan 
engineer Martín Alberto de Palacio 
y Elissague. The local authorities 
had assigned him the project of in-
venting a bridge that would make 
it possible to transport people and 
goods while still allowing naviga-
tion on the Nervión, essential for 
the region’s steel industry.
A visionary 
design
Having studied the different op-
tions that existed at the time, both 
in transport mechanisms (rails, 
barges, platforms) and types of 
bridge (lifting, swinging, high-level, 
underground), the engineer came 
up with the design, which he him-
self named the “Palacio Transporter 
Bridge”. He thus succeeded in 
meeting the double challenge put 
to him. 
The work began on 10 April 1890 
and lasted just over two years. The 
main structure was built first, then 
the transport “gondola”, compris-
ing a covered section for first-class 
passengers and an uncovered area

for second-class travelers, mer-
chandise and livestock. 
Inaugurated in 1893, the bridge 
was the first in history with such 
characteristics. It gained interna-
tional fame and was soon com-
pared to other iron monuments, 
such as the Eiffel Tower. The en-
gineer Gustave Eiffel was in fact a 
personal friend of Palacio. 
When the Spanish civil war be-
gan in 1936, the Biscay bridge 
became a focal point for General 
Franco’s troops, intent on occu-
pying the Basque country. On 26 
April 1937, the Condor legion, a 
squadron of German planes Hitler 
had sent to Franco’s aid, bombed 
Guernica. Barely two months lat-
er, on 17 June 1937, the Northern 
Army Engineers, a Republican 
battalion defending Biscay, blew 
up the bridge to prevent Franco’s 
troops from crossing over.
Reconstruction
Its reconstruction was completed 
two years later and featured some 
technical improvements, such as 
a suspension system and cross-
bars. The bridge was back in 
working order by 1941. 
It now stands in the midst of a 
natural setting. The blue water, the 
slope of the western bank and the 
groves of trees along the shores 
seem protected by a benevolent 
colossus. 
We have grown – the contrasts be-
tween the two banks and the deca-
dent atmosphere described by my 
grandfather have gradually faded. 
The creation of the Guggenheim 
museum in 1997 modernized 
Bilbao, but the childish glee in-
spired by crossing from one side of 
the river to the other in this urban 
cable-car remains intact. My grand-
father would certainly have been 
touched to see this bridge inscribed 
on the World Heritage List.
