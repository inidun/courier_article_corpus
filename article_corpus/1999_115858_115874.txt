Until now, more than 80 per cent of Latin
American science has been funded by the
public sector. But until now, s t ates have
actually done little more to encourage the growth
of the scientific community than handing out
occasional scholarships or backing unive rs i t y
courses on the grounds that this is “good” for the
country. But there is no sign of real national
science policies.
So the development of science has been anar-
chic, shaped by the intellectual interests and incli-
nations of a scientific community whose members
are more interested in working in advanced fields
than in those directly related to society’s basic
needs.
The regi o n ’s economic capacity is a major obs-
tacle to investment in science.Scientific and tech-
nological infrastructure is poorly developed, with
R&D budgets less than 0.5 per cent of GDP. It is
s i g n i ficant that no Latin A m e rican countries feat u r e
among the wo r l d ’s top 20 nations in terms of indus-
t rial and technological pat e n t s. H owe ver a few
c o u n t ri e s , including A r g e n t i n a , Brazil and Mexico,
have excellent records in research and innovation.
For the past 15 years, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank have played a
big part in encouraging gove rnments to push applied
research and build bridges between research and
i n d u s t ry. But links with national centres of pro-
duction are still in their infancy, mainly because
industrial sectors are weak and small and generate
little demand for local research.The result is that the
s c i e n t i fic community hesitates to change its pri o ri-
ties or set more practical goals attuned to the market.
W h at ’s more, the most advanced sectors of
n ational production are subsidiaries of foreign firm s.
These have access to the parent company ’s labora-
t o ries and to exchange agreements with foreign
u n i ve rs i t i e s. In recent ye a rs , such firms have realized
that Latin America has excellent human resources
and labs and are starting to use them.This could gi ve
a new boost to scientific research.
Science and technology in Latin A m e rica are in
a transitional phase, in which the scientific com-
munity is having to rethink its role and learn how to
co-operate with other sectors. At the same time,
governments will have to adapt their policies on
science and technology to local conditions and
m e d i ate between unive rs i t i e s , labs and industry.
Governments are less and less likely to be able to
subsidize academic research and ambitious tech-
n o l o gical programmes which cannot be put to edu-
cational,economic or social use. n
