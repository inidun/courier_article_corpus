The build-up for an international sporting
event can create a tremendous sense 
of national unity. But there’s always a danger
of such powerful emotions turning sour

A sudden roar surged from the throats of the
thousands of spectat o rs packed in the stadium
and from hundreds of millions more all around
the globe.French soccer star Emmanuel Petit had
just sent the ball into the back of the Brazilian net
a few minutes before the end of the 1998 Wo r l d
Cup final.
As the great roar erupted, so did the bodies
from which it came. Arms were stretched trium-
phantly aloft and then reached out exultantly to
embrace other bodies. In the midst of the din,
people hugged each other—on the pitch, in the
stands, before giant screens set up in Paris, Saint
Étienne and thousands of other French towns
and villages, and in front of TV sets in bars, cafés
and homes.
The rejoicing went on late into the night, a s
c r owds all over the country took part in the biggest
e ruption of popular joy in France since the Libera-
tion at the end of the Second World War.

As the goal was scored, other equally violent
c ries were uttered. But they were shorter and ended
in sobs. Cries of pain, rage, frustration and humi-
liation, they soon gave way to silence.Amazement
and disbelief were written on grim, tortured faces.
The shouting, the tears and the body language
were triggered by a whirlwind of emotions. On one
s i d e , the ecstasy of the French; on the other the
grief of the Brazilians, whose team had been beat e n
3 - 0 . The final was watched around the world by
t wo billion passionate fans of all ages and eve ry
imaginable social,cultural,ethnic, national,politi-
c a l ,i d e o l o gical and religious affil i at i o n .All the sym-
bolic might of sport was on display—the ability to
transcend divisive issues and generate intense,
spontaneous and widely-shared emotion. H ow is
it possible that a mere football match can creat e
such high drama?
Passion of this kind no longer surp rises anyo n e .
Yet huge intern ational sports gat h e rings are only
recent eve n t s. The first modern Olympic Games
were held in 1896 and the first football World Cup
in 1930.At the end of the 19th century, sport was
a pastime reserved for the upper classes of ri c h
c o u n t ri e s ,but between 1920 and 1940 the situat i o n
changed drastically. S p o rt was gi ven more and more
press and radio cove r a g e , became ve ry popular and
was skilfully exploited by the authorities for politi-
cal purposes.
Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany were the
first to make use of it. Exploited by the Nazis for
propaganda purp o s e s , the 1936 Olympic Games
in Berlin marked the start of the modern era of
sport as a spectacle.The Berlin games are still stu-
died as an example of the way in which crowds can
be lured and fa s c i n ated by spectacular eve n t s.T h e y
launched the tradition of grandiose and finely
o r c h e s t r ated sporting events which bring prestige to
the organizing country.
Hyping up
the supporters
But dictat o rships have not been the only
r e gimes to use sport to promote nat i o n a l i s m .S i n c e
the end of the Second World War, sporting events
h ave helped countries win intern ational promi-
nence and build up national identity. E ve ry new
state creates its own national sports teams. During
the annual sporting calendar,patriotic feelings are

regularly called on to support a team or a cham-
p i o n . Political and economic interests and the
media can use the powerful symbol of sport to rally
c i t i z e n s ,c u s t o m e rs and spectat o rs around a sense of
national belonging.
Sporting events help people that they belong
to a community.To take part, you join one of the
groups of spectators behind each of the two com-
peting teams, and share the emotions of your fel-
low supporter s. During the match, your sense of
identity is mobilized on behalf of your national,
village or neighbourhood team, whichever the
case may be.This passionate feeling of together-
ness and partisan commitment is the core of
spectator sports.
These big events bring together (tele)viewe rs
who sometimes have only one thing in common—
the desire to see a clash between two sides which will
produce a single winner. Such is the hierarchical
n ature of sport . Getting together to see a sport i n g
e vent always brings with it the hope that we w i l l
b e at t h e m. The sense of community is based on
rivalry and opposition to others.The main thing is
that everyone is united against the other side.
The us-against-them attitude is built up in all
the talk and media hype that precede the event and
at t ri bute meanings to it.This build-up is the cru c i a l
element in the process of bri n ging people together.
I t ’s also the most unconscious one.The meaning of
the event is defined by what is said before it takes
place.A feeling of solidarity mounts as the big day
approaches.
The World Cup in France was built up in this
way over two ye a rs. O f t - r e p e ated slogans conv i n c e d
people that this was “a chance for France”, w i t h o u t
explaining why. E x h o rt ations to back the nat i o n a l
team found their way into all kinds of fields—in

An us-against-them attitude is
built up in all the talk and media
hype that precede the event and
attribute meanings to it. This
build-up is the crucial element in
the process of bringing people
together. It’s also the most
unconscious one.
The success

p o l i t i c s ,s p o rt , the media, a d ve rtising and even lite-
r at u r e . The foundations of victory were laid as a
sense of national awareness was creat e d , gr a d u a l l y
uniting in support of this particular cause French
people who were in other respects divided.“ S p o n-
t a n e o u s ”o u t bu rsts of collective joy were prepared
months before the competition began. The end-
less hype created the event just as much as the
e vent had created the hy p e .
We are
the champions!
The scenes of popular jubilation showed how
people identified themselves with the winners. By
defeating Brazil, the French players beat the team
considered the best in the world. By a mysterious
alchemy, all the French and their supporters also
became “the best”. “We are the champions . . . of
the world,” they chanted.They had proved them-
selves better than the best,i.e.the losers,who were
only mentioned during the long night of celebrat i o n
in terms of the humiliation inflicted on them.A g a i n
and again people raised one, t wo and then three
fingers as they savoured the 3-0 score.The delight
of one side was a counterpoint to the other’s grief.
“ We ” were triumphant and all-powe r f u l . “ T h e y ”
no longer existed,except as a foil.
By pulling off such an historic feat,the French
football team were able to rally behind them an all-
inclusive France of “Blacks,Whites and Beurs”1.
But this was a transient phenomenon which faded
as the excitement died away. Other  sporting eve n t s
would bring people together in the same way.
W h at ’s more, this kind of seemingly inoffensive
j u b i l ation actually harbours tensions which become
more acute when competition in sport provides a
pretext for them. S p o rting events can spark vio-
lence which homes in on the “enemy”of a threate-
ned or humiliated “us”.“They”become the focus
of collective hatred because of their commitment to
the opposing side.
The competition invo l ved in sport generat e s
and channels passions on the basis of winners and
l o s e rs. For their own support e rs , the playe rs are the
personification of all kinds of talents and qualities,
including viri l i t y.The opposing team and their sup-
p o rt e rs are characterized as practitioners of all kinds
of vices and taunted as “the weaker sex”.
So the result of a sporting encounter goes hand
in hand with a fantasy of male dominat i o n , a n d
s p e c t ator sport symbolizes the endless struggle bet-
ween groups of human beings, r ather than their
alleged fraternal instincts. It doesn’t take much for
jubilation to degenerate into violence where “any-
thing goes”. n
