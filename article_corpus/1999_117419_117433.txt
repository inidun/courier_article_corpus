U g a n d a : a j i h a d against A i d s
w Maggie Keenan W h e e l e r
In informal schools tied to mosques, Muslim religious leaders have taken on a pivotal role in
teaching youth the basics of pre v e n t i o n
Mohammed Mubiru admits that Aids is a
topic he has never discussed with his
p a r e n t s.“They would think I was being dis-
r e s p e c t f u l ,” he say s. So where did Mubiru , a teena-
ger, learn about the disease? 
In an innovat i ve project launched by the Isla-
mic Medical A s s o c i ation of Uganda (IMAU ) , yo u t h
in Mpigi (50 km southwest of Kampala) and Kamuli
D i s t ricts (140 km northeast of the capital) are lear-
ning about Aids at Madarasa schools associated with
the mosques in their villages.These schools are open
on weekends to teach Muslim children the A r a b i c
language and principles of Islamic culture and beha-
v i o u r. Muslims account for about 16 per cent of
U g a n d a ’s 20 million people. In 1989, the country ’s
highest Muslim authority declared a jihad (holy
war) on A i d s ,p aving the way for the Madarasa A i d s
Education and Prevention project.
In a 36-lesson curriculum developed by the
Ugandan Ministry of Health and the United
N ations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), youth in the
Madarasa schools learn about HIV/Aids transmis-
s i o n ,p r e vention and control during 40-minute ses-
s i o n s.The curriculum was recently enriched with a
life skills component to equip youth with some of
the tools they need for building self-esteem and
coping with va rious challenges of gr owing up.To p i c s
include resisting peer pressure,c o m m u n i c ation skills
and being assert i ve : “If a girl is asked by a man to
h ave sex, she needs to know how to say no and mean
n o,” insists Neema Nakya n j o, I M AU ’s project offi-
c e r. He helps to train county sheikhs, imams and
their assistants to use the curri c u l u m .These trai-
n e e s , i n - t u rn , s u p e rvise the training of vo l u n t e e r
Madarasa teachers at mosques in their area. Since its
launch in 1995, the programme has reached more
than 36,000 children in 350 schools.
“It is challenging to introduce the topic of A i d s ,
but children need to know,” s ays Imam Hassan
Magola from Bukulube Mosque.The project under-
lines that certain traditional Muslim practices 
can increase the risk of exposure to the HIV 
v i ru s , namely male circumcision with unsteri l e
i n s t ruments and ablution of the dead without pro-
t e c t i ve glove s. Introducing the topic of condoms
h owe ver proved to be the single gr e atest hurdle. I n
the first ye a r , the issue was removed from the cur-
riculum after some religious leaders argued that
recommending use of condoms would promote sex
outside marri a g e . O ver a ye a r , I M AU held a dia-
logue with Islamic leaders to work through their
c o n c e rn s , stressing that the condom was only being
promoted as protection after the failure of the first
t wo lines of defence: abstaining from sex and hav i n g
sex only within marri a g e . As IMAU argued, gi r l s
do become pregnant before marriage and there are
m a ny cases of sexually transmitted disease among
the unmarri e d . Islamic leaders eventually agr e e d
t h at education on the responsible use of condoms
was acceptable and the topic was reinserted in the
curriculum in the second year.
N ow, the project’s main struggle is with funding.
UNICEF has contri buted $35,000 to the project
since its launch while parents are encouraged to gi ve
the Madarasa teacher 100 Ugandan shillings per
session (less than 10 cents) and have repeat e d l y
expressed their support for the project. G r ow i n g
n u m b e rs of non-Muslim parents are seeking to enrol
their children in the Madarasa Aids classes.W h at ’s
clear is that students feel able to talk more openly
about the subject.“When I see someone with A i d s ,
I know what they are going through and I sympa-
t h i z e ,” s ays one student. “I have learned that A i d s
is a reality and I live in fear of it.” n
