La Estancia and Chuipachaj 
are both K’iche’ communities in 
Guatemala. In La Estancia, however 
Spanish is the dominant language, 
while in Chuipachaj, everyone 
speaks K’iche’ including the 
children. The UNESCO-supported 
Mobilising Project in Support of 
Mayan Education (PROMEM) has 
been at work. “PROMEM has had 
a positive effect on the children’s 
self-esteem, because they have 
discovered that our culture is as 
valuable as others. This is essential 
so that they don’t feel inferior,” 
says teacher Eladio Jose Menchu 
Barreno, Director of the Community 
Self-Management School of 
Chuipachaj.
The project, launched in 1995 
to support democratization in 
Guatemala, puts Mayan language, 
values, traditions and cosmology 
at the heart of the learning process. 
It covers 48 educational innovation 
centres located in the K’iche’, 
Mam, Kaqchikel and Tz’utujil Maya 
communities. But resistance to 
bilingual multicultural education still 
persists, often from the Ministry of 
Education itself and from teachers 
who are not bilingual, according to 
Virginia Tam, head of the provincial 
Intercultural Bilingual Education 
Unit. Certain parents are also 
hard to convince, regrets teacher 
Silvia Luisa Menchu: “Yet the 
mother language strengthens their 
children’s identity and the Spanish 
language opens the doors to the 
outside world.”
Juan Carlos Chojolan, 12, goes to 
Nuevo Amanecer (New Dawn) Maya 
School in the District of Cantel.  He 
speaks only Spanish, but says, 
“I want to learn learn K’iche’ so 
that my grandparents can tell me 
stories about our Mayan culture. 
My mother tells me stories about 
our people, but I imagine that my 
grandparents’ version in K’iche’ 
would be even better.”
