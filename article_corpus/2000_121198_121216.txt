Beyond e c o n o m i c s
Unless policymakers take a more all-round view of education,
they risk sending their countries down the wrong path
Over the past decade,educational change
in most countries has been driven by
one imperative:survival in the global
economy.This process has been parti-
cularly salient in the A s i a - P a c i fic region
following the drastic shock of the 1997 economic
d o w n t u r n . But in the current reform process,
marked by speeding commercialization and eco-
nomic preoccupations, other educational missions
are being ignored,and countries risk paying a high
price for their shortsightedness.
There’s no denying that economic considera-
tions are critical in today’s world.Students have to
acquire the knowledge and skills to survive and
compete in the global economy, especially one
which more than ever before prizes human capital.
A high-quality labour force gives nations a cutting
edge in global competition.Understandably, stres-
sing economic returns in the current educational
debate attracts private resources. But education
has other functions that are the indispensable corol-
lary of more balanced,equitable development.Th e y
deserve to be briefly explained.
The first is a social function: education has a
role to play in facilitating social mobility and brin-
ging about integration in often very diverse consti-
tuencies. It is at school that children learn how to
form a broader set of relationships, to live toge-
ther and become aware of belonging to a commu-
n i t y. Linked to this is education’s  political function:
schools are there to teach us civic attitudes, to make
us aware of our rights and responsibilities —in
e s s e n c e, to become responsible citizens.The task is
fundamental in light of democracy’s advance in so
many countries over the past decade or so. Then
there is education’s cultural function.Developing
creativity and aesthetic awareness, accepting other
traditions and belief systems while valuing our own
are all part of the path towards fulfillment. Finally,
education is a goal in and of itself. Schools help
children learn how to learn and play a pivotal role
in transferring knowledge from one generation to

the next. I believe that all these facets of learning are
critical for the long-term prosperity of our societies.
In our globalized, interdependent world, these func-
tions take on a more international character. Eve-
r y w h e r e, education has a role to play in eliminating
racial and gender biases, promoting global common
interests, movements for peace, and greater inter-
national understanding.
Rising above short-term pressures
to strike a harmonious balance
While education is widely recognized as the
spine of the learning society, the complexity lies in
striking a balance between these various functions.
The commercialization of education that we are
witnessing the world over inevitably pushes schools,
e d u c a t o r s,parents and policymakers to pursue short-
t e r m , market-driven outcomes. L a w y e r s, b a n k e r s
and businessmen have an increasingly high profile in
educational debates. Following Southeast A s i a ’s
downturn in 1997, they were influential in changing
the academic mindset. In little time, emphasis has
shifted from academic achievement to developing
communication skills, c r e a t i v i t y, a d a p t a b i l i t y. In and
of itself, this is not necessarily regrettable.The pro-
blem is that these skills are all perceived to be at the
service of a supreme economic value.
Sounder research will be required to analyze
and assess where the current trends are leading us.
It is increasingly recognized, h o w e v e r, that unless
economic growth is accompanied by good gover-
n a n c e, a fair sharing of benefit s, better social and
environmental protection and attention to culture,
it will, sooner or later, lead to unrest. It is through
education that this broad spectrum of concerns can
be nurtured. Po l i cymakers who have taken stock
of this holistic mission unfortunately represent a
minority in today’s educational debates and reforms.
Their foremost challenge is to manage commercia-
l i z a t i o n , to rise above short-term pressures and  to
take a more ethical stance towards education, a
long-term strategic view. ■
