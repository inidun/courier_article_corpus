Business follows gr a d u at e s. For the coun-
t ries that host them, t o d ay ’s high-flying
foreign students hold the keys to tomor-
r ow ’s successful deals, because when they return
home they will probably become influential deci-
sion makers in politics and bu s i n e s s.
M e a n w h i l e , they provide the countries where
they study with hefty tuition and lodging fees.
According to the non-gove rnmental organizat i o n
E d u c ation Intern ational (EI), each year foreign
students bring in $7 billion to the US economy,
b e t ween $1.7 and $2 billion to the United King-
d o m , $750 million to Australia and $730 million
to Canada. “In A u s t r a l i a , the Royal Melbourn e
Institute of Technology and Monash Unive rs i t y
are considered among the top 500 service expor-
t e rs.”
1.5 million 
students abro a d
I n t e rn ational student flows have increased at the
same pace as worldwide demand for higher edu-
c ation in the past few ye a rs. In 1980, a p p r ox i-
m ately 900,000 young people left home to study
a b r o a d . To d ay the figure is 1.5 million, a n d ,
e x p e rts say, the upward trend is likely to conti-
n u e . N i n e t y - f i ve per cent of students studying
outside their home countries head for the indus-
t rially developed nat i o n s.T h r e e - q u a rt e rs of them
go to eight countri e s , and the trend is mov i n g
t owards still gr e ater concentrat i o n . By far the
most popular destination is the United Stat e s ,
where the number of foreign students has increa-
sed almost six-fold in thirty ye a rs , rising from
82,000 in 1964-65 to 458,000 in 1996-97. “ I t ’s
n e ver been so high,” although the number has
flattened out in the past five ye a rs , s ays Todd M.
D av i s , director of research at the Institute of
I n t e rn ational Education (IIE) in New Yo r k .T h e
figures may be impressive , but foreign students
account for only 3.2 per cent of the total in the
United States–three times less than in Germ a ny,
France and the United Kingdom.
The second most frequented host country is
F r a n c e , with 140,000 foreign students in 1996.
Although France has a strong, long-standing tradi-
tion of welcoming foreigners , its market share is
dropping, according to a 1996 study by SFERE, a
French organization which monitors the export of
e d u c ational resources. In Germ a ny,A u s t r a l i a , Ja p a n
and the United Kingdom,on the other hand, f o r e i g n
student enrolment has increased.
A f rica south of the Sahara and a number of A s i a n
countries send the highest proportion of their stu-
dent populations abroad: over 10 per cent. In term s
of numbers,however, China is the biggest “expor-
t e r ” , with 130,000 expat ri ate students, twice as
m a ny as Japan and the Republic of Korea, w h i c h
come next.Young people from Asia account for
nearly half of all students abroad.
Why do more and more young people, usually
acting on advice from their fa m i l i e s , decide to study
outside their home countries? First of all,because
rightly (the usual case) or wrongly (sometimes for
snobbish reasons), they believe that the quality of
higher education is better abroad. O t h e r , more spe-
c i fic fa c t o rs may also come into play. F l ows bet-
ween European countries account for a quarter of
worldwide student flow s. They are part of a gr o-
wing trend and a political movement towards regi o-
nal integr ation which are reflected in unive rsity stu-
dent exchange programmes such as the European
U n i o n ’s Erasmus scheme. In other parts of the
world, restrictive measures encourage some com-
munities to look elsewhere.For example,“the Malay-
sian government has quotas on the number of eth-

R o b e rt Law r e n c e , director of LD & A , an A u s t r a l i a n
company which carried out a survey on Asian stu-
dent movements in 1997. In poor countri e s ,c a n d i-
d ates for emigr ation regard the unive rsity as an open
door to an Eldorado in the West.Everywhere, the
brightest hopefuls apply to elite institutions which
h ave fiercely competitive selection procedures, s u c h
as Yale,Harvard and Columbia on the east coast of
the United States, Stanford and Berkeley in Cali-
f o rn i a ,Oxford and Cambridge in England, the Ecole
Polytechnique and the School of Advanced Com-
mercial Studies (HEC) in France,and McGill Uni-
versity in Canada.
A m e rican unive rsities are a powerful magnet
for several reasons, including the use of English
as a world language, the persistence of the A m e-
rican dream and, a b ove all, quality of educat i o n .
“ T h at ’s where you find the most four-star pro-
gr a m m e s ,” s ays Denis Lévy, h o n o r a ry president
of the Intern ational A s s o c i ation of Unive rs i t y
P r o f e s s o rs and Lecturers. “ For example, S t a n-
ford is the best place to study European law.
Schools like that have unlimited mat e ri a l
r e s o u r c e s. They subscribe to eve ry t h i n g, use the
l atest inform ation technology to the full and offer
outstanding working conditions.” U n i ve rsities in
the developing countries cannot measure up.
Often ill-equipped or transformed into bat t l e-
grounds during political confli c t s , they are deser-
ted by the best teachers.
Young people believe that studying abroad is
almost always a passport to employ m e n t .“ T h at ’s
especially true when the recruiter has also stu-
died outside his or her country. When he or she
p e r c e i ves the intern ational student as equal to
the domestic one, the ove rseas degree still makes
the applicant stand out,” s ays Law r e n c e . Fa m i-
l i e s , which usually foot the bill for their children’s
e d u c at i o n , do not hesitate to make the inve s t-
m e n t . In the English-speaking wo r l d , tuition fees
can run as high as $27,000 in the United Stat e s
and $15,000 in the United Kingdom. Unlike the
s i t u ation in European countries such as France,
where access to most institutions of higher lear-
ning is inexpensive , the poorest applicants are
a u t o m atically screened out on financial gr o u n d s.
They have access only if they are outstanding, i n
which case they obtain grants and scholars h i p s
from their gove rn m e n t s , from intern ational orga-
n i z ations and pri vate foundat i o n s.
A valuable export
The outflow of students is a serious loss for the
“ e x p o rt i n g ” c o u n t ri e s. According to UNESCO,
30,000 A f rican gr a d u at e s , as well as many A s i a n
and Latin A m e rican ones, m ay have settled outside
their home continents. Among the reasons which
make them hesitate to return home are their fears of
s aying goodbye to a high standard of living in the host
c o u n t ry (including access to health care, q u a l i t y
education for their children and high salaries) and
of running into a professional dead-end at home.
“The conditions of scientific work are difficult in
d e veloping countri e s ,” s ay Jacques and A n n e - M a ri e
Gaillard of France’s ORSTOM research centre.
“The research is not ori gi n a l , bu r e a u c r atic controls
put a brake on initiat i ve ,equipment is hard to acquire
and maintain,access to information is limited. . . .”
There may also be political obstacles. In the lat e
1980s, China began to realize that expatriate stu-
dents were not return i n g . Despite measures to lure
young graduates back home,such as the allocation
of housing and research budgets and the freedom to
travel, between 1978 and 1994 only 70,000 out of
A s i a n s in demand
Most expatriate students are from
Asian countries. In spite of the crisis,
they are also the most sought-after.
Europe and North America are vying to
attract them but Canada and, e s p e c i a l l y,
the United States win the competition
hands down. A 1997 study by A u s t r a l i a ’s
LD & A company shows that 88% of A s i a n
students believe the US offers the best
educational services, followed by the UK.
In non-English-speaking Europe, t h e y
regard the quality of the German system
as higher than that of the Fr e n c h . A c c o r-
ding to the Institute of International Edu-
cation (USA), Asia provides 57% of all
foreign students in the US, ahead of
Europe (15%) and Latin America (11%).
Most are from Japan (45,531), followed by
China (42,503), the Republic of Ko r e a
( 3 7 , 1 3 0 ) , India (30,641) and Ta i wa n
( 3 0 , 4 8 7 ) . Business is the Asians’ favourite
m a j o r, followed by engineering and the
s c i e n c e s. ■

230,000 students who had left China to study abroad
returned,according to official figures.
The example of the Republic of Korea show s
t h at an authori t a rian regime is no obstacle if the
e c o n o my is thri v i n g . In the early 1960s, m a ny
Koreans remained abroad after graduation,80 per
cent of them in the United Stat e s.But in the 1980s,
t wo-thirds of those who had earned doctorates from
A m e rican unive rsities went back home within three
ye a rs of receiving their degr e e s.Generally speaking,
the “little dragons” of southeast Asia boast the
highest percentages of returning students–at least
until the recent economic crisis blew up.
Whether they return home or not,foreign stu -
dents are a profitable investment for the host coun-
t ry. When they become decision makers in their
home countries,they control access to markets. If
they settle down where they studied, they often pro-
vide energy and fresh ideas.
T h at lesson has not been lost on the United
States,where the Immigration and Nationality Act
A m e n d m e n t ,which entered into force in 1968, fa c i-
litates the immigration of qualified personnel and
where several foundations offer grants to the most
promising students.To d ay, p ri vate companies eve n
pay some foreign students’tuition fees to make up
for the shortage of skilled pers o n n e l , especially in the
field of information technology. Most of the scien-
tists living in the United States were born abroad and
over one-third of Silicon Va l l e y ’s engi n e e rs and
r e s e a r c h e rs are immigrants from Ta i wa n ,s ay Ja c q u e s
and Anne-Marie Gaillard.
But Australia probably has the most aggr e s-
s i ve policy for attracting foreign students, e s p e-
cially A s i a n s. It has opened inform ation offices in
some forty countries and makes it easy for
foreign students to obtain a visa. According to
E I , Canada and the United Kingdom have done
the same. Ja p a n ’s ministry of education has deci-
ded to accept 100,000 foreign students by 2000,
but in 1996 such students only numbered
52,000 and numbers may fa l l , according to A k i r a
N i n o m i ya , a professor at the unive rsity of Hiro-
s h i m a . Reasons include the high cost of living in
Ja p a n , the language barri e r , the rigorous admis-
sions process and the near-impossibility for forei-
g n e rs of finding work on the local market.
For host countries,
a profitable import
France has a ve ry ambiguous policy.According to a
recent study,“the current paradox consists of a drop
in the percentage of foreign students and gr owing dif-
ficulties in hosting them and, at the same time, a
desire to be more present on the intern ational edu-
c ation market.”The French are uneasy about the
structure of the foreign student population,which
r e flects their country ’s history. O ver half come from
former colonies in Africa, countries with “limited
economic potential,” according to SFERE.But the
French are also aware that they cannot afford to
give up too much ground on the international stu-
dent market, especially in a world where, a c c o r d i n g
to EI, “ e m p l oye rs seek qualified employees who
t h ri ve in foreign environments and understand mul-
ticultural contexts.” ■
