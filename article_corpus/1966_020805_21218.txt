HURDLES IN SPACE
BROADCASTING
by Nicolai I. Tchistiakov
J ust nine years have elaps¬
ed since the launching of
Sputnik 1. In these few years, with
much intensive work, the foundations
for the use of satellites for communi¬
cation, and particularly for radio and
television, have been firmly laid.
Broadcasting was part of the earliest
probes into space. Conversations
with Yuri Gagarin during man's first
orbital flight were transmitted through
the broadcasting system of the
U.S.S.R. in April 1961. In August of
the same year the Soviet television au¬
dience had its first view of a cosmo¬
naut in space flight. By 1964 television
viewers were shown not only the
inside of the cabin, but also the view
of Earth from space. In 1965 they
watched cosmonaut Alexei Leonov take
the first walk in space.
With improvements in technology
came the satellites Telstar and Relay,
launched by the United States in 1962
and 1963, which made possible for the
first time short, experimental television
transmissions over very long distances.
In 1964, Syncom and Early Bird, in
synchronous orbit, realized television
transmission for long periods, includ¬
ing the broadcast of the Olympic
Games from Japan.
In April 1965, the Soviet satellite
Molniya 1 ("lightning") was launched
on an elliptical orbit with its apogee
in the northern hemisphere at a height
of 40,000 km (25,000 miles). The
period of orbiting is 12 hours, and
Molniya 1 makes one circuit over the
U.S.S.R. and a following one over
North America. A 40-watt active
relaying apparatus on board, with two
spares, made possible the first regular
television transmissions between the
western U.S.S.R. and its far eastern
lands for periods of from eight to
nine hours.
In October 1965, the launching of
Molniya II further increased the possi¬
bilities of television transmission
throughout the eastern part of the
U.S.S.R. On October 17, for instance,

Radio Techniques at the Institute of Tele¬
communications in Moscow. He took part
in the Unesco meeting on the use of space
communication by the mass media, in
December 1965.
Soviet television viewers on the Pacific
coast were able to see the Denmark-
U.S.S.R. football match being played
in Copenhagen.
In November 1965 the first success¬
ful experimental transmissions of col¬
our television from the U.S.S.R. to
France were carried out via Molniya I.
The successful experiments with
communication satellites by the U.S.A.
and the U.S.S.R. show that they have
an Important role to play in the devel¬
opment of broadcasting. Comparisons
are now possible between various
types of orbits. In the use of satellites,
the main emphasis is on the transmis¬
sion of television programmes.
Without using satellites, the long
distance transmission of radio broad¬
casts has not been difficult or expen¬
sive, and improvements in shortwave,
radio relay and cables offer continual¬
ly the possibility of further progress.
Sound broadcasts are recorded and
transmitted swiftly, and possibly will
be sent by supersonic rocket in the
near future.
Copying television programmes and
transmitting significant news events
present greater problems. This calls
for broad band channels such as
coaxial cables, wave guides, micro¬
wave relay lines and communications
satellites. We are aware of limitations
of the present stage of development.
Experience suggests two types of
communications satellites as best for
broadcasting systems: Satellites on
synchronous equatorial orbits (see
drawing page 29), such as Syncom 2,
and satellites on stretched inclined
elliptical orbits, providing long conti¬
nuous transmission periods, such as
Molniya 1. The problem now is to
improve the power sources, stability,
reliability and life of the equipment on
board the satellite. The launching by
the U.S.S.R. of a satellite equipped
with an electrical battery with radio¬
isotopes suggests one possible solu¬
tion.
These are some of the advantages
of the synchronous satellite :
no time limit for transmission,
a minimum number of satellites in
orbit for global communication,
comparatively simple construction
of ground antenna, driving servo-
mechanisms for the antenna and com¬
puter control devices,
remoteness of satellites from the
effects of belts of intensive cosmic
radiation,
M stability of received signals,
absence of distortion from Doppler
effect,
the "earth satellite" permits relative
localization of the radiated wave,
reducing interference between space
and ground equipment.
Among the advantages of the high
elliptical orbit are:
an orbit which provides optimum
receiving conditions for the ground
stations of a given country or territory,
use of the same satellite for pro¬
gramme exchange between territories
in the eastern and western hemisphere
with one-hop propagation,
high signal to noise reception in the
high latitudes where synchronous
satellites do not provide good recep¬
tion,
simpler and more economic launch¬
ing of satellites.
It is possible that, for global com¬
munication, a system combining both
types of satellites will prove most
satisfactory.
Direct broadcasting, which would
provide a direct signal from the satel¬
lite transmitter to the ordinary home
receiver, offers some apparent ad¬
vantages. But the shortcomings are
so numerous and important that It may
have limited scope. However, on the
positive side, it would not be neces¬
sary to load national and local broad¬
casting stations with transmissions
from satellites, and the listeners and
viewers would have a more varied
choice of international programmes.
But there is an impressive list of
obstacles to direct broadcasting. A
high power supply would be neces¬
sary on the satellite, of an order not
now technically available. Even if the
power were available, it might not be
practical to radiate it, since it would
create interference with services such
as fixed and mobile communication,
and radar, which share frequency
bands allocated for satellite commu¬
nication.

The optimal bands for transmission
from satellites are centimetre waves,
but ordinary receivers cannot be
readily adapted to this band. The
installation of a complicated and
expensive receiving antenna by the
ordinary set owner for proper reception
from satellites is also not practical.
Direct broadcasting faces further dif¬
ficulties. With synchronous satellites
of the "stationary" variety, the recep¬
tion becomes worse at the boundaries
of the region served, mainly in the
high latitudes. Signals from the satel¬
lite cannot be kept out of countries for
which they are not intended. Transmis¬
sions cannot be shifted to more con¬
venient times for the populations of
given territories. The sound on a tele¬
vision transmission cannot be proces¬
sed or changed if translation into the
language of a given country or territory
is desired. In areas where the tele¬
vision standards differ from those of
the transmission, reception would be
impossible.
Much further study of direct broad¬
casting will be required, in the event
that countries reach agreements for
its use.
Broadcasting with retranslation is
the system in which television and
sound broadcasts are received from
the satellite by the national ground
station and then retransmitted to the
individual home receiver via national
broadcasting stations. The advantages
of this system are numerous. Pro¬
grammes can be received on portable
transistor radio and television receiv¬
ers. Optimal frequencies in the "sat¬
ellite-Earth" channel can be used,
Independent of the bands of ordinary
receivers.
For television, standards can be co¬
ordinated with the standards in each
country. The schedule for international
broadcasts can be co-ordinated with
national broadcast schedules and for
the convenience of the people. Pro¬
grammes can be recorded or taped at
the receiving stations for broadcast at
a more convenient time. Stable types
of modulation and of signal processing
can be used in the "Earth-satellite-
Earth" channel for noise resisting
reception and for narrowing of the
occupied frequency band.
For broadcasting by retranslation by
synchronous satellite, the ground sta¬
tion can be located at a comparatively
low latitude where, for the given
country, optimal reception conditions
exist. In the use of satellites with
elongated elliptical orbits, it is pos¬
sible to switch from one satellite to
another without programme interrup¬
tion. Also, it is possible to reduce
interference from satellite radiation to
ground services by decreasing the
power of the transmitter aboard the
satellite, by using sharply directional
receiving antennae, or low noise am¬
plifiers. The power plant aboard the
transmitter can be lighter and more
compact, with a corresponding in¬
crease in reliability, in power conser¬
vation, and in the life of the satellite.
For the new art of international
broadcasting, each country should
first develop its national radio and
television broadcasting system. Only
then can it adapt its national network
for the reception of international pro¬
grammes. Broadcasting by retransla¬
tion best fits this principle.
There is no reason to believe that
satellites will in the future be the prin¬
cipal means for the international ex¬
change of programmes. Other means
such as cables and micro-wave are
available and are being developed
further. Micro-wave links from con¬
tinent to continent could join together
the various national communication
networks to provide global networks
of large capacity.
here are certain services
which require the open
propagation of radio waves. The lo¬
calization of radiation on the surface
or in space is impossible, in some
cases, or could create great difficul¬
ties. This is true of terrestial radio¬
location and navigational systems,
meteorological, geophysical and navi¬
gational satellites, communication sys¬
tems for the flight safety of cosmo¬
nauts, planet radiolocation, radio-
astronomy and communication with
observatories in open space, and the
important mobile communication ser¬
vice on the ground, in the air and on
oceans .
Development and improvement of
mobile communication systems are
important now and must go on in the
future. Today there are systems for
control of maritime, air, and other
transport, and communications services
for the passengers. More individual
services will be required in the future.
Satellites especially launched for
the purpose may have a great role
in mobile maritime communication ser¬
vice.
And so we see that satellites in
point-to-point communication systems
may solve the problem of a global
communication network. However,
they do not give us the only solution,
nor the most realistic one.
Satellite communication systems
must be designed with limitations on
their range and the duration of their
use, with relation to the availability of
other systems, and to economic ad¬
vantage. This is my personal opinion,
but I firmly believe that only by adher¬
ing to the principle can we exclude
the crisis in the use of frequencies
which arose in the high frequency
(short wave) band.
This point of view must also be
considered in planning the develop¬
ment of broadcasting. The satellite
communication channels should be
used only when actually necessary;
there must be economy of frequency
channels.
Immediate transmission is necessary
only for actual important events, and
that does not take much time nor
many channels on a global scale.
There is usually a delay in transmis¬
sions of the principal parts of many
broadcasting programmes, and the
delay is often desirable because
of zonal time differences. The
processing of broadcast programmes
for language differences requires a
delay. The transcription of program¬
mes may serve satisfactorily, as in
the case of the 1964 Olympic Games,
when television programmes were
transported to Europe from the U.S.A.
after being received from Tokyo
through the satellite Synchron III and
recorded on magnetic tape. They
could have been transported directly
from Tokyo to European central tele¬
vision stations.
However, such considerations do
not mean that satellite communication
channels will not play a great role in
the transmission of broadcasting pro-
grammes. Television programme
transmission by satellite may be very
useful for areas where the ground
nets of multi-channel communication
are not adequate, and for towns situat¬
ed far from other towns across under¬
populated and inaccessible territories.
A global system combining the use
of all modern means and methods
must be designed, providing for ap¬
proximate scheduling of the use of
satellite channels, and it must secure
for all parts of the world and all coun¬
tries an equal right of participation.
However, that enterprise would have
to be preceded by a broad interna¬
tional exchange of television broad¬
casting programmes via communica¬
tions satellites.
In a global exchange, there must
be an equal flow between developed
and developing countries. Each coun¬
try possesses invaluable treasures of
national culture.
Since October 5, 1957, when the
man-made Earth satellite became a
reality, it has been clear that all tech¬
nical difficulties in this field may be
overcome. But the regulation of major
legal problems always goes slowly.
Global broadcasting through commu¬
nications satellites must be regulated
by an international convention, based
on the relevant decisions of the United
Nations General Assembly.

A lofty tower is now
thrusting skyward above
Moscow (above right). It is
already as tall as the Eiffel
Tower in Paris, and when
completed in the autumn
of 1967, its 520 metres
(1,700 ft.) will make it the
highest edifice in the world.
Antenna on its summit will boost
direct television transmissions
from Moscow, providing good
quality reception, without
additional relay transmission,
for people living up to
150 kms. (90 miles) from the
capital. Above, artist's sketch
