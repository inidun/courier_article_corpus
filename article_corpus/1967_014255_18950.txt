UNESCO
and the search for peace
u
64
NESCO'S general con¬
cern with peace and disarmament is
based on its Constitution, whose
preamble affirms in its opening words:
"That since wars begin in the minds
of men, it is in the minds of men
that the defences of peace must be
constructed."
The preamble to the Constitution
emphasizes the importance of promot¬
ing equality in the access to educa¬
tional, scientific and cultural facilities
a task implying close links between
Unesco's efforts and those of the
United Nations In the cause of social
and economic development.
The Unesco Constitution, however,
defines the relationship between so¬
cial and economic development and
the promotion of peace by stating that
peace cannot be based exclusively
on political and economic arrange¬
ments between governments, but
must be founded upon the Intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind. This
means that Unesco's action for peace
has to reach individual men and
women.
Unesco does not itself undertake
professional research. Unesco's scien¬
tific departments and services seek to
promote and encourage research at
the national, regional and international
levels, and to facilitate scientific com¬
munication across political and cultu¬
ral borders.
In its very earliest programmes
Unesco devoted considerable atten¬
tion to a series of problems presented
under the heading of "Study of
International Tensions", which soon
expanded into research projects on
international and intra-national social
tensions. A large number of psycho¬
logical, sociological and economic
studies were carried out within this
framework from 1947 to 1956, of which
the following are a few examples:
How Nations see each other, by
William Buchanan and Hadley Can-
tril; Urbana, University of Illinois
Press, 1953. *
In the minds of men, by Gardner
Murphy; New York, Basic Book
Service, 1953.*
Democracy in a world of tensions,
by Richard McKeon; Stein Rokkan,
ed.: Chicago, University of Chi¬
cago Press, 1951. *
Tensions affecting international
understanding, by O. Klineberg;
New York, Social Science Research
Council, 1950. *
Tensions that cause wars, by
G. W. Allport, G. Freyre, G. Gur-
vitch et al.; Hadley Cantril, ed.;
Urbana, University of Illinois Press,
1950.*
The older studies carried out under
Unesco's programme are only partly
relevant to present-day peace res¬
earch. More recent ones which come
very close to peace research proper
and therefore lead up to present
preoccupations are:
International social science journal:
Peace research, Vol. XVII, no. 3,
1965. Compromise and the settle¬
ment of conflicts, Vol. XV, no. 2,
1963. The social Sciences and
peaceful co-operation, Vol. XII,
no. 2, 1960. * (see page 67.)
International social science bulletin:
Techniques of mediation and con¬
ciliation, Vol. X, no. 4, 1958.*
Unesco has launched a series
of studies which began with a survey
of the institutional framework within
which scientific research on peace
and disarmament at the international
level is currently pursued in Unesco's
member states.
It was this basic concern with
institutional organization and the
exchange of information on current
research among the various national
Institutions that led to the compilation
of an International Repertory of Insti¬
tutions specializing in research on
peace and disarmament and to the
establishment of a new non-govern¬
mental organization, the "International
Peace Research Association" (IPRA),
whose "Newsletter" on current peace
research Is published with Unesco's
assistance.
This Association has also recently

INSTITUTIONS FOR RESEARCH
ON PEACE AND DISARMAMENT
Seven international organizations are working exclusively on peace
research:
International Peace Research Association, Groningen, Netherlands.
Peace Research Society, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
European Co-ordination Centre for Research and Documentation in the
Social Sciences, Vienna, Austria.
International Centre for Inter-Group Relations, Paris, France.
International Institute for Peace, Vienna, Austria.
Pugwash Conference for Science and World Affairs, London, U.K.
World Federation for Mental Health, Geneva, Switzerland.
In December 1966, national institutions specializing in peace research or
partly engaged in peace research numbered 73. They were distributed as
follows:
32 in North America (U.S.A. and Canada).
39 in Europe (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Fed
eral Republic of Germany, Eastern Germany, Greece, Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, U.S.S.R., U.K. Yugoslavia).
1 in Asia (India).
1 in Latin America (Mexico).
The number of peace research institutions will undoubtedly increase as
new peace research centres and sections, founded by universities or other
institutions, expand and co-ordinate their resources and activities.

been commissioned to make an
exhaustive study and an analysis of
existing hypotheses on peace and
disarmament. From the latter phase
of this study it may be possible to
establish a typology of such hypo¬
theses. The results of this study will
be published.
Interest In the institutional frame¬
work of peace research has also
brought about further and closer co¬
operation between Unesco and the
Pugwash Conference on Science and
World Affairs. Two scientific studies
are being carried out in close colla¬
boration with the Continuing Com¬
mittee of the Pugwash Conference,
the first bearing on the legal and
political aspects of intervention, and
the second dealing with the problem
of guarantees.
Another study is a limited survey,
based on public opinion data, of the
image of a world in the process of
disarmament (see page 5).
Unesco activities relating to peace
research will be further expanded In
1967-1968. Among other studies, a
critical appraisal will be made of the
extent to which university courses in
international law and international
relations take into account the concept
of living peacefully together. This
study will be made by some ten
countries with different social and
political systems.
A major event during Unesco's
20th anniversary celebrations in Nov¬
ember 1966 was the round-table
meeting at which a score of distin¬
guished international figures, including
three Nobel Peace Prize winners
(Lord Boyd Orr, Linus Pauling and
Philip J. Noel-Baker) appraised
Unesco's contribution to peace.
Appreciating "the valuable contribu¬
tion Unesco has made to peace in
its first 20 years", and considering
present world problems (among
others, the arms race, inequality of
living standards, the population explo¬
sion...), the participants appealed to
all peoples and all governments "to
reject war once and for all as an
instrument of their international poli¬
cy".
Unesco is to produce in 1967-1968
a world anthology of writings desi¬
gned to strengthen peaceful relations
between peoples. The first anthology
will be devoted to the theme, "The
Horrors of War" and will comprise
passages from works by great writers,
from letters and from accounts of eye¬
witnesses of war. Unesco National
Commissions in member states have
been asked to submit texts for inclu¬
sion in the anthology.
The educational and scientific acti¬
vities of Unesco which, though not
dealing specifically with peace and
disarmament, nevertheless have a
relatively direct and constant bearing
on peace, are those connected with
the implementation of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
This applies particularly to Article 2

of the Universal Declaration, which
proclaims that everyone is entitled to
all the fundamental human rights
"without distinction of any kind such
as race, colour, sex, language, reli¬
gion, political or other opinion,
national or social origin, property,
birth or other status".
Almost since its inception, Unesco
has undertaken a wide range of edu¬
cational activities and scientific stud¬
ies whose aim has been to promote
the extension of human rights. Scien¬
tific studies, for example, have been
the basis for a number of basic decla¬
rations relating to problems of racial
discrimination:
The race concept. Results of an
inquiry; 2nd edition, Unesco, 1958.*
This book gives a report of the dis¬
cussions which led to the adoption,
by an international meeting of experts
in 1951, of a declaration on the
concept of race and racial differences.
The General Conference of Unesco in
1960 called for a revision of this
declaration in the light of the most
recent scientific knowledge. Two
international meetings were convened
in Moscow in 1964 and in Oxford in
1965 to re-examine respectively the
biological aspects of race and the
social and cultural aspects of human
rights. The conclusions of the first
meeting were published under the
heading Biological aspects of Race.

nal (Vol. XVII, no. 1, 1965).

Among studies dealing with educa¬
tional aspects of the race problem,
one of the most important was that
carried out, under the auspices of
Unesco, by Cyril Bibby, entitled:
Race, prejudice and education;
London, Heinemann, 1959. (9/6.)
Unesco has actively promoted inter¬
national understanding through edu¬
cation.
It has organized international semi¬
nars to study the most effective
methods of developing such education
in schools; it has been concerned with
the production of specially designed
teaching materials and aids; and It
has collaborated with governments
and professional associations for the
improvement of school textbooks from
the point of view -of international
understanding.
Among other examples are the
recent experimental project for the
international exchange of geography
textbooks for revision and comment
by experts, and a similar project for
history textbooks now being planned.
In addition experts are made available
to governments (on request) and to
Unesco-aided teacher training institu¬
tions.
A notable Instance of direct action
by Unesco for the Improvement of
curricula and methods In this field of
education is the programme known as
the Associated Schools Project, which
has now been in operation for more
than ten years.
It consists of a network of co-ordi-

nated pilot projects in schools In differ¬
ent countries (about 400 primary and
secondary schools and teacher-training
institutions in 50 countries).
Its purpose is to test ideas on edu¬
cation for international understanding
under differing circumstances and to
exert a direct influence on education
generally by developing knowledge of
world affairs, of international co-op¬
eration in problems of world signifi¬
cance, of other cultures and ways of
life, and of the principles of human
rights.
The project has influenced educa¬
tional practice outside its own area of
application and has demonstrated that
teaching for International understand¬
ing need not add to the load of school
programmes but In fact may enrich the
content and Increase the impact of
ordinary curricula.
It has contributed to the develop-
mept of methods and research and
techniques of evaluation for such
teaching and, by arousing the Interest
of educational authorities in the prob¬
lem, has paved the way for broad
national programmes in this field.
Unesco's continuing activities with
adult education and youth organiza¬
tions and movements include conside¬
rable emphasis on the promotion of
international understanding. The fol¬
lowing are a few examples:

cation; reprint of articles from

Some of the studies on socio-eco¬
nomic development and technological
change touch only incidentally upon
problems of International tensions,
conflict or danger of war, whereas
others specifically refer to these prob¬
lems. Examples of the more direct
approach are:
Social implications of the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy, by Otto
Klineberg, ed.; Unesco, 1964.
