“Th e y ’re down there on Loubet / T h e y ’ ve all
got big houses / They’ve got the cheek to
tell us / ‘We live in a ghetto’ / He smokes
foot-long joints / He’s pretty addicted / He looks
like a gangster / But he’s just scared / Of getting
thrown in the slammer.”
The four members of the group Perfect G’s
hammer the lines with “ at t i t u d e ” . B o r d e ring on
involuntary self-parody, this send-up takes aim at
the strew of other rappers who hang out in the same
neighbourhood of Oran as they do. None wo u l d
look out of place in the tough suburb of a French
city or a lower-class district of New Yo r k , with their
p ricey track-suits emblazoned with the logos of big
s p o rt swear firm s , the name of their group (Ol’ D i rt y
S h a m e , Killa Dox , Lord Squad, Black Eye s ,T h e
Commission) and their stage names (Oddman,
N.Fect, MC Ghosto, Flyman, Machine Gun,Vex,
Jigy, Baby, and so on).
The rappers of Oran,A l g e ri a ’s second largest city,
are to be found in a dow n t own area that has been the
haunt of  “ c o o l ” people for several decades. They sit
on the benches along the Avenue Larbi-Tébessi (for-
merly Avenue Loubet) or on the
steps of shuttered shops in
Mohamed-Khémisti (once
A l s a c e - L o rraine) Street,b e c a u s e
they can’t gather in the local
cafés and tea-houses. It is in this
200-metre radius area that they
g ather to shoot the breeze in the
l ate aftern o o n ,or whenever they
take time off from their studies,
their casual jobs or just from doing nothing.
This we s t e rn A l g e rian city is the birthplace of rai,
and of one of its leading stars , K h a l e d . But Oran’s
r a p p e rs and disc-jockeys aren’t too keen about each
o t h e r. “ T h e r e ’s just copycats left in rai these day s ,”
s ays H Rime,of the group MCLP. “ R a i ’s just for hav-
ing a laugh,”s ays Vex of the group Da Tox (Theory of
E x i s t e n c e ) . Je a l o u s y, almost hat r e d , is in the air.
The rappers see the many rai singers as the
main obstacle to their hitting the big time with their
provocative rants delivered at the speed of light to
music that doesn’t lose face to foreign rap:
“In the bat t l e ,A l g e ri a ’s there / With Oran guys rap-
ping / They’ll get revenge / They’ll settle their
scores /Their heads are hot / As boiling water.”
Electronic rai has been going for 20 ye a rs now
and its pioneers , all from ve ry poor fa m i l i e s ,are push-
ing on 40. Hip-hop became the rage about a decade
a g o, led by middle-class perform e rs. To d ay, it has
spread around the country (neighbouring Morocco
has only a small hip-hop scene), t u rning A l g e ria into
the rap leader of Arab nations and probably of the
entire Muslim world despite a meagre musical output
(each album only sells about 10,000 copies) consid-
e ring the dizzying number of gr o u p s.
Oran had about 40 hip-hop groups in 1990.
To d ay there are more than 60. A l gi e rs had 60 last
year and now has about 100.The capital has gi ve n
b i rth to a wave that has spared no city in the country.
Groups recite their rhyming ve rses in a weird frenzied
l a n g u a g e , switching from one tongue to another,
then to a third and a fourt h . In a single sentence,
F r e n c h ,English and the two forms of A r a b i c, l i t e r a ry
and spoken, are jumbled together.They invent a fle x-
i b l e , i r o n i c, language with bold descri p t i ve powe r:
“ T i g h t - fitting hijeb [the Islamic headscarf]/See-
through hijeb/Swimsuit hijeb/Flashy hijeb/Multi-
coloured hijeb/Crumpled hijeb/Frisky hijeb bought
on the Champs-Elysées/OK hijeb/Malay s i a n
h i j e b / R e m ovable hijeb/Air-
conditioned hijeb.”
E ve ry TV image fin d s
its way into their lyrics: wars,
the ozone layer, famine, fash-
ion models, films,contracep-
tives, soap operas,ads,hooli-
gans. Everything is evoked ,
compared and twisted to fit
the rhy m e . Then comes the
real problem of finding a proper recording studio.
Two famous groups in A l gi e rs , MBS (Micro-
phone Breaks the Silence) and Intik (“cool” in A l g e r-
ian slang) have already brought out their first CD in
F r a n c e , A l ge ra p on one of the big labels. Wa h ra p ( a n
a b b r e v i ation of Wa h r a n ,which is Oran in A r a b i c, p l u s
the word rap),a compilation by several Oran gr o u p s ,
came out in June 2000. The theme of the album is
summed up by MCLP’s refrain:“ We ’re microphone
fiends / We ’re telling you what we see / W h at e ve r ’s
going on / Some people steal / Others suffer.”
From a musical standpoint, the compilation is
well above the first A l g e rian rap albums that hit
F r a n c e . N o n e t h e l e s s , from the outset, A l g e rian rap
was well received in France. R a p p e rs met with sym-
p at hy for evoking the massacres and social ills affli c t-

ing their country. But the genre is still struggling to
establish itself: audiences in France are more drawn to
i m m i grant A l g e rian rappers such as Freeman and
I m h o t e p,of the Marseilles group IAM,Rimka of Col-
lectif 113, and non-Algerians like Joey Starr , of the
duo NTM, who worked on the albums of MBS and
I n t i k .
Last ye a r , A l g e rian rappers only produced a
dozen recordings on mediocre cassettes, but today
hip-hop products are springing up all over,reflect-
ing young people’s formidable need to speak out.
A l gi e rs is home to a constellation of rap gr o u p s
including the Hamma Boy s , Cause To u j o u rs , K -
Libre,Les Messagères,City 16,De-Men and Tout
Pa s s e . The flo u rishing resembles the explosive
growth of the written press during the democrati-
sation that followed the riots of October 1988.
Since those days howe ve r , disillusionment has
taken hold,as the A l gi e rs group Intik raps:“ M a n i p u-
l at i o n ,a g gr e s s i o n ,disappointment / T h at ’s what my lot
is today / My only crime is to hope and to dream.”
In A n n a b a , a town in eastern A l g e ri a ,L o t fi a n d
Wa h e b , of Double Kanon, who are considered the
best rappers of the day, openly denounce the coun-
t ry ’s ills:“They come and they come armed / Devils
or people / They come down from the Jewish ceme-
t e ry / To d ay it’s a crackdown / There ain’t no football
m atch / They come from the parade gr o u n d / Car-
rying the flag like in the Lebanon wa r / Up there peo-
ple are fleeing / The land’s become black.”
The war between the security forces and Islamic
fundamentalists (“terros” or terrorists in rap lan-
guage) is the focus of such hip-hop, along with
attacks on corru p t i o n ,o p p o rt u n i s t s , the “ t r a b e n d o ”
(black market),hatred,injustice and the blues.
“Zero morale”, the name of a song by the long-
standing Oran group V i x i t , sums it all up: “ T h e
Escobars / The Al Capones we have right here / We
have the mafia / What is left? / Engineers, doctors,
d i p l o m ats / Think about begging cigarettes / Jo b l e s s
people just hang around / The market economy / We
are condemned / Like animals in a zoo.”

But a new trend is emerging. In its early days,
rap was the privy of well-off middle class yo u t h s
who wrote their rhymes and worked out their tem-
pos in the comfort of fa n cy villas. N ow it is becom-
ing more democratic and inspiring young people
from underp rivileged backgr o u n d s. In short ,A l g e r-
ian rap has taken off across the social spectrum.

A i n - e l - Tu r k ,while those belonging to the group Cot-
t a g e s , from the small town of Boufa ri k , sell ve g e t a-
bles and cigarettes on the street. I t ’s common know l-
edge that Réda,of the group Intik,had to sell his shoes
in the A l gi e rs flea market to pay for the last recording
hour of his gr o u p ’s first cassette.But eve ryone believe s
in just trying to get by,as products of local educat i o n
without a future, of satellite dishes spewing unreality
and of inescapable  pove rt y.
In early May 2000, about 30 groups gathered in
the city of Mostaganem for a hotly-contested rap
competition. The first prize went to a group from
Algiers. Its name was SOS. ■
