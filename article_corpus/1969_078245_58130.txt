FOR MIGRANT WORKERS 
‘In 1967, well over five million migrant workers had left their home 
countries and found employment in Western European nations alone. 
~The rising number of these migrant workers now poses many problems 
~ which the host countries, with the help of the ILO, are trying to Ly 
solve. These problems are aggravated by language barriers 
unfamiliarity with local conditions. In 1962, an ILO convention vy 
specified that migrant workers should have the same rights to social 
security as citizens of host countries, thus reinforcing a 1949 
convention calling on governments to place immigrants on the 
same footing as their own nationals in respect of salaries, worki 

THE INTERNATIONAL
OF WORKERS
A smouldering issue of our time
by Pieter Kuin
IN recent years the inter¬
national migration of labour has swell¬
ed to enormous proportions. This is
particularly true of continental Europe,
where in 1964 alone over a million
workers legally crossed the various
frontiers. At the same time the vol¬
ume of illegal immigration is also tend¬
ing to increase as the authorities
endeavour to channel and limit the
flow of migrant workers.
This action on the part of the au¬
thorities is an indication of the growing
anxiety about massive migration; in
some countries aliens now constitute
a considerable slice of the labour force
in Switzerland the figure is already
as high as 30 per cent and every
year workers flock across the fron¬
tiers of France, Switzerland and the
Federal Republic of Germany in their
hundreds of thousands.
The prevalence in the press and
other mass communication media of
terms like Überfremdung, "inundation
by foreigners," also bears ample wit¬
ness to this anxiety. Although immi-
PIETER KUIN was formerly Professor of
Economics and Industrial Organization at
the Free University of Amsterdam, Nether¬
lands. Both he and Prof. Samuel Parmar
(see article page 32) discuss the problems
of the migratory worker, but approach the
subject from quite different viewpoints. Their
texts are based on studies they originally
wrote for "Migration Today" (No. 6, May
1966), a bulletin published by -the Secretariat
for Migration, Division of Inter-Church Aid,
Refugee and World Service, World Council
of Churches, Switzerland.
gration in countries like Holland and
Belgium has not yet reached alarming
proportions, people there are already
becoming disturbed about it; they are
all the more worried in view of the
difficulties foreigners have in becom¬
ing integrated and the desperate short¬
age of housing for their own nationals.
The list of problems created by the
mass movement of workers is long
and dismal. It includes hardships
endured by the workers themselves,
who have to spend a large proportion
of their wages on rent (often sharing
tiny rooms) and other personal ne¬
cessities; wives and fiancées left be¬
hind; engaged couples and newly-
weds unable to find a home while
employers provide foreign workers
with accommodation.
Are all these difficulties really un¬
avoidable? Can we find no better
synthesis of economic and social
needs? Are we not standing idly by
while some territories' economic
growth remains stunted and others
enjoy a growth rate far beyond their
real potential? Rather than uproot so
many people from their familiar
surroundings and resettle them in areas
with overcrowding problems of their
own, would it not be better to disperse
economic activity?
It is because of the economic dis¬
parity between different parts of the
world that countless people are having
to choose between unemployment or
a very low-paid job at home and fac¬
ing up to the drawbacks of migrating
to one of the larger centres of industry.
It would of course be preferable to
disperse economic activity, but is it
feasible?
The first questions that present
themselves are inevitably: What causes
this disparity? And how does it
manage to survive and even to in¬
crease? Is there no mechanism for
ensuring a balanced pattern? Were
not our school text-books on economics
full of explanations of equilibrium
showing how any disturbance produces
a pressure that counteracts it? Why
does this mechanism fail to operate?
Why does production not flow to
where there is plenty of space, labour
and once people start earning
demand, until economic activity is
spread more evenly? There are var¬
ious factors and forces that act against
such equilibrium . . .
Is there any hope at all for areas
where economic development has
lagged behind? Must the disparities
continue to grow? For the immediate
future this seems inevitable, but the
long-range prospects are not quite so
gloomy.
The continued accumulation of acti¬
vity in one area ultimately causes
congestion and releases dispersive
pressures. Typical examples are the
shortage of housing and office space,
labour shortages, traffic congestion, __
long distances between home and yO
work, failure of public services to keep ^*»
up with the rapid growth of demand,
lack of unspoiled countryside and rec-

MIGRANT WORKERS (Continued)
Real advantages, to be sure, but...
reational facilities, waiting lists and
overcrowding in schools and hospitals,
and a tendency for the individual to
lose his identity among the masses
and become frustrated.
All these factors will make for a
more even distribution of economic
activity and a drift towards areas now
at a low economic ebb, but they alone
will not be enough. If development
is to proceed along the right lines
before it is too late there must be
plenty of realistic planning, great
discernment in administration and will¬
ingness on the part of the authorities
and industry to co-operate at national
and international levels.
Some may feel that long-range
solutions are all very well, but do not
help people who are in great distress
now. They may perhaps wonder
whether appropriate redeployment of
industry might not bring more imme¬
diate relief, and whether it is not time
to start taking the work to the people
instead of attracting the people to the
work.
This can be achieved on a modest
scale if the projects chosen are kept
within the range of present possibili¬
ties. Over-ambitious projects for
which the necessary infrastructure and
other facilities are not available can
only result in loss and disappointment.
We must be content with small,
sensibly planned and well-executed
projects employing a fair-sized labour
force. A well-run local handicrafts
industry, for instance, might with good
marketing find a ready market in more
advanced countries, particularly if the
products were not too heavy or bulky...
I

HERE are some steps
which can be taken to bring about a
more even distribution of economic
activity, to raise prosperity and em¬
ployment levels in areas that are at
present lagging behind. But the
opportunities are only limited and we
should beware of growing too optimis¬
tic, particularly regarding short-term
improvements.
When migration is banned or restrict¬
ed, even with the aim of eradicating
the resulting evils, the effect is to
deprive people in the less developed
areas of potential employment and
income and to cut back production in
prosperous regions without any corres¬
ponding increase elsewhere. For
years to come, therefore, we shall
have to rely on workers migrating from
one district or country to another.
However evenly economic activity
is distributed throughout the world,
there could never be complete affinity
between the industries located in a
given place and the type and volume
of skills possessed by the local in¬
habitants. If we are to safeguard a
man's right to settle where his talents
will best benefit himself and society,
therefore, the opportunity for migra¬
tion must always remain open.
The less developed areas, in parti¬
cular, have much to gain from migra¬
tion. Their future depends to a consid¬
erable extent on the workers who
return home, bringing with them know¬
ledge of new processes and techni¬
ques, of social and political life and
how they are organized in more
advanced areas.
It is for reasons such as these that
recent economic and social thinking
and legislation has laid much stress
on the free movement of labour. The
Treaty of Rome, for instance, which
set up the European Economic Com¬
munity, institutes a common market
for labour as well as for capital and
commodities.
We must therefore conclude, despite
all the difficulties and hardships caus¬
ed by the mass movement of workers,
that we are right to remove barriers
to migration. In accepting migration,
however, we do not have to accept
its evils along with it.
Migration undeniably can bring di¬
rect economic rewards, not to mention
other advantages like the satisfaction
of working and the new experiences
that broaden the workers' outlook and
enable him to live a fuller life when
he returns to his homeland.
More often than not, however, he
has to contend with hardship and
suffering. However poor a man is,
however miserable his social position,
leaving his homeland means losing its
protection, its familiar surroundings,
the conditions he knows and under¬
stands. Separation from wife, child¬
ren, parents and other relatives is a
serious matter. In a foreign country
their absence will be deeply felt and
there is a risk of loneliness, loss of
human contacts or mixing with the
wrong people. Quite rightly the divid¬
ing of families is looked upon as the
greatest drawback to migration, but
if the family is allowed to join the
worker this causes him and the host
community additional difficulties.
In many cases migration brings with
it a loss of status. It is widely believed
in the host countries that all immigrants
come from the lowest strata of society,
people with no status or skills in their
own countries. This is by no means
always the case, for many indépendant
farmers and craftsmen are forced by
the poverty and backwardness of their
own region to go elsewhere and take
unskilled jobs that nobody else wants
to do.
Add to this the often unwelcoming
and even hostile attitude of people
in the host country, the lack of accom¬
modation, high prices and rents, exploi¬
tation of the newcomers' unfamiliarity
with local conditions and the barriers
of language and culture, and the dismal
picture is complete except for one
item: insecurity and the unlikelihood
of improvement. A man will put up
with a great deal if he is not constantly
threatened by some major disaster like
being sacked from his job or turned
out of his room at a moment's notice,
and if he can reasonably expect things
to improve. All too often, however,
the immigrant has much less security
than other workers. In factory and
boarding house he is the last to be
accepted and the first to be got rid
of. How long will he be allowed to
stay in the foreign country? If he
can bring his family over, what are
the chances of settling permanently?
What should he do after a period of
temporary residence? What will the
situation be in his homeland then?
Many questions and no answers.
Fear. Suspicion. Little hope for
the future. Sometimes it all becomes
too much for him and he suffers a
mental or moral breakdown. Who can
be surprised? Who can blame him?
But who is there to understand and
help? True, many kind and able
people do a tremendous amount of
good work in the sphere of social
welfare, but something more is ne¬
cessary if the existing problems are
to be solved and additional evils
prevented.
IF the migrant worker has
his problems, so have others: relatives
left behind, governments, local authori¬
ties, employers, trade union leaders
and the general public in the host
country. For solutions they are all
dependent on one another. How long
the worker will stay in the foreign
country, for instance, depends on:
his employer, who in turn must
know whether he can count on
foreign labour and for how long;
the government of the host coun¬
try, which is only likely to renew
work permits if there is still a
shortage of labour;
economic development back
home; planning for this calls for
some knowledge of the numbers
and skills of emigrant workers
who intend to return.
Any realistic solution requires co¬
operation and consultation between
the parties right from the outset. The
failure to realize this has led to the
social difficulties we are now facing.
When the labour force in the developed
countries was insufficient for the total
production plans, foreign labour was
called in to fill the gap. This was
often presented as a purely' temporary
measure and is still viewed in this
light by many people.
Far from disappearing as the years
went by, however, the foreign labour
force has mushroomed. It is hard now

to see how it can ever be superseded
by local labour. Where are the local
workers to take over the jobs? And
who would want the jobs anyway?
Things have now got to the stage
where many countries have a new
low-paid proletariat doing the jobs
nobody else wants.
This time the dividing line is not just
between social classes but between
ethnic groups as well, and this raises
grave social problems. They can only
be avoided by taking timely and appro¬
priate measures to bring about the
economic, social and cultural assimi¬
lation of workers who are staying
permanently or for a long period. Un¬
less they are encouraged to adopt
the language, way of life and mental
attitudes of their adopted land, and
to share In the rights and duties of
native citizens, they are in danger of
becoming displaced persons for the
rest of their lives.
Then there are the substantial num¬
bers of young people who go abroad
to work for a few years before settling
down back home with the money they
have saved and the experience they
have gained. They too need to be
looked after. If in the country where
they find work their fellow-countrymen
have already formed a new ethnic pro¬
letariat, the young newcomers are
liable to be drawn into it. Instead of
new skills they may acquire habits and
ways of life that make their return to
a better life at home difficult or even
impossible.
Another drawback confronting young
migrants is that they may receive
thorough training in some trade or
occupation which is unknown in their
own district. This can happen even
within the borders of one country.
The Calabrian who finds work in
northern Italy on the assembly line of
a car factory or at the control panel
of a chemical plant may on his return
home have difficulty in settling down
to making leather bags or canning fish.
In any case he will be used to the
better terms of employment and greater
spending power of the north.
In cross-frontier migration this can
be an even greater problem. We must
therefore think in social, economic and
technological terms and be prepared
for extensive study and consultation
at an international level. International
organizations might be able to make a
valuable contribution here. The Euro¬
pean Economic Community's plans
with regard to implementing Article 50
of the Rome Treaty ("Member States
shall under a common programme,
encourage the exchange of young
workers") may provide a useful frame¬
work...
There is a lot of talk these days
about the need for social planning as
a complement to economic planning.
If there is any field where this teaching
needs to be applied it is the field of
migration. Without a carefully devised
plan of campaign we shall inevitably
be swamped by a flood of social
problems, conflicts and all the suffer¬
ing they engender.
Is there still any prospect of chan¬
nelling the flow in the right direction?
Probably there is, but there is one
major obstacle, the same one which
started the whole process: the lack
of qualified people. It is all very well
to devise jobs, to plan what should
be done and how, but who is actually
going to do the jobs?
Here we come up against one of
the most urgent problems of our time,
which confronts industry, government
agencies, international organizations
and religious bodies: we are running
out of human resources. Perhaps this
problem lies at the root of many others,
including migration.
OVER FIVE MILLION
MIGRANT WORKERS
IN 8 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
Although the United Nations has prepared figures on the
migration of peoples across frontiers, no up-to-date statistics
exist giving a world picture of the migration of workers per se.
The table presented here is limited to migrant workers in
eight European countries in 1967 and is based on a fuller study
prepared by the Churches Committee on Migrant Workers in
Western Europe. Establishing statistics on migrant workers
is fraught with difficulties since the definition and classification
of what a migrant worker is differs widely from country to
country. This table is therefore an approximation and
publication here is not to be taken as official endorsement
by the U.N. or its Agencies.
