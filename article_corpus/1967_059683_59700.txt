AN UNPARALLELED INTERNATIONAL SURVEY
Thousands of
stained-glass windows
from medieval times
0,FNE of the great trea¬
sures of man's cultural heritage are
the stained-glass windows of medieval
Europe. Yet for a long time few fields
In the history of art showed so many
gaps. Paradoxically, it was the
Second World War which made pos¬
sible the comprehensive study of
thousands of masterpieces in stained
glass. In war-threatened areas these
works were taken to safety and, often
for the first time, indexed and photo¬
graphed.
In 1949, Professor Hans R. Harm¬
loser of Bern (Switzerland) proposed
a country-by-country inventory of all
stained-glass windows made in Europe
between the twelfth and sixteenth cen¬
turies. Work on this Corpus Vitrea-
rum Med/7 Aevi, which is being carried
out with the collaboration of leading
specialists, will take no less than 20 to
30 years to complete. The Corpus
will comprise 75 large-format volumes
richly illustrated with black and white
and coloured plates, a few of which
are reproduced on our colour pages.
Unesco is supporting the project with
aid in publishing and research.
Seven volumes dealing with works
in Switzerland, France, Belgium,
Austria, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many and Scandinavia have appeared
since 1956. Five (Belgium, France, Ger¬
many) are to appear shortly and a
further 23 are in preparation. Each
volume has a preface, an historical
introduction, a catalogue of stained-
glass windows for a particular monu¬
ment or period, as well as an incono-
graphic, historical, stylistic and technic¬
al study, and reproductions. Each
volume is prepared by a national com¬
mittee affiliated to a special group
created by the International Commitee
for the History of Art to co-ordinate
work on the Corpus. Professor Harm¬
loser is chairman of the editorial com¬
mittee.
The immense undertaking of the
18

Corpus Vitrearum is warranted by the
fact that, despite losses sustained
over the centuries, the surviving
stained-glass windows in Europe still
constitute an enormous wealth of
art treasures.
The development of the art of stain¬
ed glass was linked to the rise of
Gothic architecture and the construc¬
tion of more and more churches and
cathedrals from the 12th century
onwards. A mosaic of pieces of
glass, coloured and painted, then
mounted in a frame of lead, the stain¬
ed-glass window is a monumental form
of the painter's art. Its origin goes
back to antiquity and stained glass
work was already used in the early
Christian basilicas, but no important
composition older than the twelfth
century has come down to us.
Gothic architecture, with its many
bays and windows beneath vaults
soaring ever higher, made room in its
lightened structure for the medieval

SCOURGING THE MONEY CHANGERS.
A 14th-century Austrian stained glass window
depicting the New Testament story of Jesus
overturning the tables of the money changers
and scourging them from the temple. The
dramatic treatment of the scene places it as a
work by the Vienna school of glass painting.
The original site of the window is not known,
but the master glass painters of Lower Austria
may have executed it for a private chapel. The
work (47 cm. by 37 cm.; 18 in. by 14 in.) is now
in Austria's Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna.

COLLECTING THE MARKET TAX.
Superb stained glass adorns Tournai Cathedral
(Belgium) a building completed at the end of
the 13th-century. In the south apse of the
transept is an unusual group of secular scenes.
"The Privileges", as these five 15th-century
works are called, show the levying of tolls
on bridges and of taxes on weights and measures,
wine, beer and market stalls. In the window
shown, town officials collect taxes from the
market vendors. The realistic scenes were
composed by the master glass painter Arnoult
of Nimeguen, designer of many other windows
in the cathedral. But they were actually
painted by one of his colleagues who, since
his name has not come down to us, is
known as The Master of the Privileges.

STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS (Continued)
75 volumes, 30 years' work
glass window to expand. The Sainte
Chapelle In Paris, built by King
Louis IX between 1243 and 1248, is an
example par excellence of a building
that is no more than a masonry shell
supporting a huge area of stained
glass over 615 square metres (6,600
sq. ft.) set in windows reaching
15 metres (50ft.) in height.
These stained glass windows had
three functions: they admitted light to
the building; they provided a form of
decoration of incomparable richness
thanks to the play of natural light; they
set forth religious teaching in a way
that the people could readily under¬
stand, every window recounting one
or more stories from the Old or New
Testament, or from the Lives of the
Saints.
Little by little they also came to tell
of historical events and to depict epi¬
sodes of everyday life and work. This
religious and secular picture-teaching
constantly derived new vitality from
the style of the stained-glass artists,
while technical research led to the use
of more and more varied colours. The
art of stained glass steadily changed
and developed from the twelfth to the
fifteenth century.
The Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevl
will be the first complete study on
medieval European stained glass. The
opening volume of the "Germany"
series (15 volumes in all) was published
in 1958, and dealt with Swabian works
from 1200 to 1350. Two of the four
volumes planned for the "Switzer¬
land" series were published in 1956
and 1965. Volume I covers twelfth to
fourteenth-century windows and Vol¬
ume III those of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries (Volume II will
appear later).
The first volume of the "France"
series (which will number 25) appeared
in 1959; it deals exclusively with the
stained-glass windows of the Cathe¬
dral of Notre-Dame and the Sainte
Chapelle in Paris. The numerical im¬
portance of the French series is
explained by the wealth of stained
glass in France's cathedrals. At the
start of the Second World War,
50,000 square metres (540,000 sq.ft) of
stained-glass windows were removed
to safety and thus survived almost
unscathed; 150,000 panels were photo
graphed before being removed and
after restoration.
Volume I of the "Belgium" series
(three volumes) surveys the relatively
scanty survivals of the medieval
period proper (1200-1500), a result of
the wars and invasions that Belgium
has experienced. Stained glass was
very widely used in Belgium from the
twelfth century onwards, but most of
the surviving works date from the first
half of the sixteenth century. Two
volumes will be devoted to them.
The first volume of the "Austria"
series (four volumes) published in
1962 deals exclusively with stained
glass in the buildings of Vienna. In
the "Scandinavia" series (1964), one
volume covers the stained-glass win¬
dows of Denmark, Norway, Sweden
and Finland. Other series are plan¬
ned for Great Britain, Italy, Spain,
Poland, Czechoslovakia and the United
States (where many stained-glass win¬
dows are preserved in museums).
The Corpus makes a decisive con¬
tribution to the history of European art
and reveals the great currents of inter¬
national exchange that enriched the
art of stained glass.
Scenes and figures from
episodes in the New and Old
Testaments fill the five soaring
windows in the chancel of the
church of Saint Dionys at
Esslingen (Federal Republic
of Germany). Each window
has no less than 56 motifs.
Shown here is Judas
Maccabaeus, a well-preserved
example of late 13th or early
14th century stained glass.

COLOUR PAGE
Left, two early 12th-century medallions
from the Rose Window of Lausanne Cathedral.
(Switzerland). Bottom, the month of May ;
top, the sun. The numerous
motifs in the Rose Window compose a pictorial
encyclopedia in glowing colours, an outstanding
example of works of this kind that are often
found in the windows of Gothic churches.
Among the motifs are the months of the year,
the seasons, the heavenly bodies,
the elements, the signs of the Zodiac, terrestial
monsters and the rivers of Paradise.
