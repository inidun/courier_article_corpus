BACH
Johann Sebastian Bach, the father of German
music, died in 1750. As a child Mozart studied
the work of one of Bach's sons, Carl Philipp
Emmanuel, and later met his youngest son
Johann Christian in London.
SCHILLER
Born in 1759, Johann Christoph Friedrich
Schiller, one of the greatest figures of eighteenth-
century German literature, was Mozart's exact
contemporary. Both shared the same desire for
a renaissance of German theatre.
GOETHE
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a great
admirer of Mozart, whom he met when Mozart
was a child. "I was about fourteen years old, and
I have a perfect recollection of this little man with
his wig and his sword." Goethe even thought
of writing a sequel to The Magic Flute.
ROUSSEAU
Bastien und Bastienne, the short German opera
Mozart composed in 1768, would never have
existed if Jean-Jacques Rousseau had not com¬
posed his opera Le Devin du village, which had
enjoyed a huge success since 1752.
RAMEAU
The French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau died
on 12 September 1764, when the Mozart family
was en route from Paris to London. His name
does not appear in the letters Leopold Mozart
wrote from Paris. By that time Rameau's star
had set.
HANDEL
During his long stay in London in 1765 the
young Mozart became aware of the importance
of the work of Georg Friedrich Handel. There¬
after his admiration for Handel never waned.
LONGHI
The Venetian painter Pietro Longhi painted
scenes from Italian life of the kind Mozart would
have seen on his first visit to Italy in 1770.
HAYDN
On a visit to Vienna in 1773 Wolfgang discovered
Joseph Haydn's series of "Sun" quartets. He too
immediately began to compose a series of string
quartets, the six "Viennese" quartets.
DIDEROT
In 1778 Leopold Mozart advised his son to make
contact in Paris with the philosopher Denis
Diderot, the chief editor of the Encydopédie.
FRANKLIN
In 1778 Benjamin Franklin was in France to
negotiate a treaty of friendship between France
and the United States. An inventor as well as a
politician, he constructed a glass harmonica for
which Mozart composed several works.
FRAGONARD
In many of his works Jean-Honoré Fragonard
portrayed scenes from eighteenth-century high
life. His reputation was at its height when Mozart
was in Paris in 1778. His famous painting The
Music Lesson was executed some ten years before.
VOLTAIRE
Mozart made these harsh comments when he
heard of the death of Voltaire in 1778: "The
Unbeliever, the two-faced master Voltaire has
died like a dog, like a brute." (3 July). A few
months later, however, he was thinking of
writing an opera based on Voltaire's spectacle
Semiramis.
MARIA THERESA
In 1780 the death of the Empress Maria Theresa,
who had so warmly welcomed Mozart the child
prodigy and then advised one of her sons against
taking him into his service, took the composer
by surprise when he was at Munich preparing
his opera Idomeneo. The reign of Joseph II began.
Mozart had a real affection for this "enlightened"
sovereign.
GLUCK
Of all Mozart's works, the opera Idomeneo, re di
Creta, first performed in Munich on 29 January
1781, is the most clearly influenced by the great
German composer Christoph Willibald von
Gluck, a key figure in the history of eighteenth-
century opera.
LESSING
Mozart's opera Die Entführing aus dem Serail,
first performed in Vienna in July 1782, cannot
be understood without reference to the German
writer Ephraim Lessing's Nathan der Weise,
which had appeared not long before. In this work
Lessing, one of the most outstanding represen¬
tatives of the German Enlightenment, develops
the principles of tolerance and reconciliation
which are those of Enlightenment philosophy.
CATHERINE
Catherine the Great of Russia was a friend of Vol¬
taire and the Encyclopaedists. She was a model
sovereign of the age of enlightened despotism.
On 8 October 1782 Mozart himself directed a
performance of Die Entführung aus dem Serail
in honour of her son who was then visiting
Vienna.
MONTGOLFIER
In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers made their first
experiments with hot-air balloons, one of which
would later be used to observe the movements
of the enemy at the battle of Fleurus.
GOLDONI
Mozart often wrote arias to texts by the Italian
playwright Carlo Goldoni and in 1783 even
thought of composing a German opera based on
one of his plays, Il servitore di due Padroni.
PAESIELLO
The Italian composer Giovanni Paesiello was one
of Mozart's true friends. They met in Vienna in
1784 when Paesiello, who had left the service of
Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg, was en
route for Naples. "It was wonderful to see how
happy they were to meet one another; their
mutual esteem was well known", said someone
who was present at the meeting.
BEAUMARCHAIS
On 27 April 1784, a play entitled La FolleJournée
ou le Mariage de Figaro was performed in Paris.
It was acclaimed by the whole of Europe, and
two years later Mozart transformed it into his
opera The Marriage of Figaro.
KANT
In 1784 the German philosopher Immanuel Kant
defined the Aufklärung, the German Enlighten¬
ment, in these terms: "It is the age of the mind
which has attained its majority and its motto is:
dare to use your reason."
FREDERICK II
Frederick the Great of Prussia was an excellent
flautist. He died in 1786. As a result of his love
of literature and the arts he became a friend of
most of the leading European intellectuals.
GAINSBOROUGH
The favourite painter of English society for
almost half a century, Thomas Gainsborough
painted portraits of many musicians. The couple
in his painting The Morning Walk could well be
the heroes of The Marriage ofFigaro, Count and
Countess Almaviva.
BEETHOVEN
In April 1787 a young musician by the name of
Ludwig van Beethoven travelled from Bonn to
Vienna in order to study with Mozart. His visit
was cut short when, after only two months, he
received the news of his mother's death.
METASTASIO
The Italian poet Pietro Antonio Metastasio was
the most prolific and celebrated librettist of
Mozart's time. He had already been dead for ten
years when Mozart composed La demenza di
Tito. The libretto by Metastasio was a classic
which had already been set to music forty-odd
times by as many composers. For his opera,
Mozart used an adaptation by Mazzola. 35
