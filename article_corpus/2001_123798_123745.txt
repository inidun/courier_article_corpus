A new day begins in the Holy City.

Following André Chouraqui’s vision of Jerusalem in last month’s
Courier, Al-Quds university president Sari Nusseibeh, whose family
holds the keys to the Holy Sepulchre, spins a childhood tale that has
lost none of its profound resonance

Sometimes when I am asked how my family—a Muslim family
named after “Nussaibah,” a female warrior-companion of the
Prophet from Medina—ever came to hold the keys to one of
Christianity’s holiest sites in Jerusalem, the Holy Sepulchre, I
smile indulgently. Th e n , I begin by saying: “ We l l , there are a
f e w traditions in the family concerning this,but let me begin with
this tale…”.
The story I then spin out is an innocent mixture of fact and
fiction,a mosaic of the subjective and the objective, which has
been imprinted in my sub-conscious ever since my early
c h i l d h o o d .For me, this is the essence of the identity of Je r u s a l e m
—a beautiful mosaic of tales spun out from a misty past, r o o t e d
in events, whether real or presumed,and constituting the fibre
of the hearts and souls of its inhabitants.
One such tale of which I am particularly fond, e n c a p s u l a t i n g
as it does the magical relation between Man and the City, is that
of the Caliph Umar’s entry into Jerusalem in 638 A . D.It is a tale
that seeped deeply into my consciousness during my childhood,
resounding year after year in my ears and mind,but cumulatively
gathering with it and impressing upon me a particular moral; o n e

w h i c h , because of its association with Islam’s origin in the City,
is fundamental to my self-identity as a Muslim Jerusalemite.
The almighty Caliph of Islam, I have been led to believe,
being totally overawed by the prospect of entering this sanctifie d
C i t y,would only deign to arrive at its gates unarmed.Leaving his
fierce and victorious warriors behind,accompanied only by his
aide and one beast of burden,he approaches the City peacefully
and by foot,to be cordially received by its Christian Guardian,
Bishop Sephronious. On his journey towards the City, the story
goes (and I take this also to be a fundamental part of the tale),
the Caliph and his man-servant exchange places to ride their
single camel.
Much of history is made of what happens next.To me, the

During a course given by French photographer Luc Chéry*, s t u d e n t s
in literature, architecture and archaeology from A l-Quds University
experimented for the first time with another form of “ w r i t i n g ” —
p h o t o g r a p h y. Working on the theme “ J e r u s a l e m , my city,” t h e y
meandered down narrow lanes and into marke t s, equipped with
t h r o wa way cameras, in search of subjective, timeless shots.The result,
a collection of 35 photographs from which the present illustrations are

well as in several capitals of the region. ■

mystery of Jerusalem is already engraved in the above tale.L a i d
out before me, I immediately see the moral contours of a cosmic
d e s i g n ,mapping out and balancing the relation between the Man
and the City, between Earth and Heaven.At one end of the
design stands the Conqueror and First leader of Men.But his
size is diminutive. His submission is total. His humility and
self-denial are complete.At the other end stands the Golden but
“conquered” City. Its size is majestic. Its form is imperial. Its
heavenly walls totally impregnable,
impervious but to the pious, who enter it
submissively and with humility. It is not
another stone-habitation to be submitted
and conquered by force. It is the
penultimate earthly stepping stone in the
journey of the humble and pious towards
their Creator.
I look at this drawing in awe and
wonder. Not here do I find the signs of
pomp and glory of earthly warriors. Nor
here in the drawing do I see the details of
b l o o d , battle and plunder. There is a
peaceful absence of human force and
violence. There is only the City’s divine
s u p r e m a cy, illuminating the path to God.
A jewel box
of moral tales
I take a look back to reevaluate or
understand the approach of the Caliph
and his man-servant. It takes but a second
for me to realize the other signific a n t
m e s s a g e, the other universal value in this
childhood tale: the equality and
brotherhood between men. R e g a r d l e s s
of their respective earthly stations,C a l i p h
and man-servant are equal before God.
A n d , as equals, they naturally come to
share their earthly utilities.
This is certainly no Roman Emperor
riding golden chariots surrounded and
protected by soldiers and servants, nor a
Cleopatra or Pharaoh carried regally on
the shoulders of beautiful Nubians
belonging to a sub-race, in celebration of
M a n ’s mighty conquests: it is, r a t h e r, a
humble servant of God,piously seeking to
be received by Him. Je r u s a l e m — t h e
stones and the inhabitants—is a jewel-
box of such moral tales. The mosaic
intercrosses time and space, stone and
soul, reality and dreams. It is impossible
not to hear the throbs of your heart, not to
pierce through present sounds and smells
to the point of contact with the images and
sounds of the past,as you tread through
the ancient cobbled streets of history.
You may see soldiers and guns parading through the streets
of the present.You may see anguish or pain or suffering. You
may sense bigotry,or bias or misplaced self-righteousness. B u t
somehow, you manage to gaze right through these and other
images of human contortions, from this period or from other
grim periods of Je r u s a l e m ’s history, to see Jerusalem as its
r e a l ,heavenly self, as a City of unity and piety.And as you gaze
at this eternal Jerusalem with the eyes of faith, you manage

somehow to imbibe differences and imbalances,distilling into
your own identity other peoples’ pains, tales and histories.
For, what is a Jerusalemite if not a complete human being, a
human being stripped of earthly prejudices, of racism and
bigotry, a human being sufficiently purified to be received by
God?
I would like to believe, in spite of the contortions of the
present, that Jerusalem can still outshine human differences
and reign supreme; and that Je w s, Christians and Muslims
can still make Jerusalem fulfill its destiny of bringing peace unto
the nations. I believe the secret to this dream lies in a childhood
t a l e. It is the tale of Umar: that men who would venture
t o s t e p into the earthly Je r u s a l e m , in fulfillment of the
b e c k o n i n g of God, should behave towards each other as
equals, and be prepared to share their earthly means of entry
to the divine world. ■
