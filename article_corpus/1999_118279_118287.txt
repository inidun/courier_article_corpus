R
osalina Tuyuc has spent the past 17 ye a rs wa i t i n g.
One night in June 1982, the Guatemalan army
came and took her father away.“ F rancisco Tuyuc is
d e a d ,”she was later told by the military,who never return e d
his body.Another night,in May 1985,they took away her
h u s b a n d ,a peasant leader.
But Rosalina, a 43-year-old Kakchiquel Maya n
I n d i a n ,was not deterred and in 1988 she founded the
N ational A s s o c i ation of Guatemalan W i d ows (Conav i-
g u a ) ,whose 15,000 members are today fighting to ensure
the victims of the country ’s civil war are not fo r go t t e n .I n
1 9 9 5 ,Rosalina was elected to parliament as a deputy for the
coalition of left-wing part i e s.
Can time ease the pain for those who have lost
a loved one?
No, you never find peace from that. My children
still ask me what’s happened to their father and if
he’s coming home. We relatives of people who’ve
disappeared are looking for our loved ones, and
we don’t find them,either dead or alive.Now that
the state has admitted that abuses occurred,it has
a moral duty to tell us where our dead are buried.
Many of them were executed at military bases. In
the name of reconciliation, the army must say
where they are. Most people just want to give
their spouses or children a Christian burial.
Have the aims of Conavigua changed since the
peace agreement was signed in 1996 and the
Historical Clarification CommissionÕs report
was published in February 1999?
The report confirmed we ’d been right about the extent
of the repression.N ow we ’re fighting to get the peace
accords applied and for Indian rights to be recogni-
z e d . But we’ll continue to seek compensation for vic-
tims of the wa r , to be told where the mass gr aves are
and to bring impunity to an end.
What kind of compensation?
The gove rnment has launched a plan to compen-
s ate communities—by introducing electri fic at i o n
and building schools, roads and bri d g e s — but it’s
forgotten the widow s.We want direct individual
c o m p e n s ation for the women themselve s ,i n c l u d i n g
a psychological support progr a m m e , s c h o l a rs h i p s
for their children and help in recovering their rela-
tives’bodies from unmarked graves.
Can anything more be done to fight impunity? 
Keep on trying those responsible. We don’t want
revenge, we want justice.We’d like to take matters
to an international court because it’s very hard in
Guatemala to obtain justice.The trials are costly,
they drag on for years and the results are not very
credible. But we’re going to bring to court at least
a few of the 80,000 cases we’ve listed.
How do you balance the demands of the vic-
timsÕfamilies and political reality, which
involves making concessions to safeguard the
transition process?
Forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting. First we need
to know who to forgive. Many families don’t
know who killed their relatives. And if we don’t
manage to establish who was responsible, history
may repeat itself. There’s always the fear of a
backlash from certain sectors but we can’t forgive
until we have justice.
Do the peace accords take the victims into
account?
The agreements led to a “ r e c o n c i l i ation law ”w h i c h
we regard as an amnesty. It doesn’t apply to acts of
g e n o c i d e , kidnapping and tort u r e .We voted against
this law and we will oppose any other amnesty.T h e
a rmy and the guerrillas share responsibility for the
wa r , though in different measure. I t ’s normal that
their leaders have made peace with one another,
but in the villages, families are not even speaking to
each other. T h e r e , r e c o n c i l i ation will take a long
t i m e . ■
