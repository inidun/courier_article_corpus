TISTOU
of the green fingers
by Maurice Druon
of the Académie Française Drawings by Jacqueline Duhème
In "Tistou of the Green Fingers", the French author, Maurice Druon,
has written a story for children and grown-ups alike of enchanting origin¬
ality. Tistou discovers that he has green fingers. Seeds blown by the
wind, lying fallow in crannies and crevices blossom at his touch. Tistou
uses his green thumbs in mysterious and astonishing ways to abolish
slums, make the animals in the zoo happy and cure the sick. In the
passages we present below from this charming yet profound tale, Tistou
uses his remarkable gift to put an end to war.

|T sometimes happens that,
when grown-ups raise their voices,
little boys do not listen.
" Do you hear what I'm saying,
Tistou ? "
And Tistou would nod his head,
saying, " Yes, yes " in order to seem
obedient, though he had not heard a
single word.
But as soon as grown-ups lower
their voices and start talking secrets,
little boys at once listen as hard as
they can and try to understand what
was not meant for their ears. All little
boys are alike in this, and Tistou was
no exception.
For some days past, there had been
a good deal of whispering in Bright-
bourne. There were secrets in the air,
the very carpets of the Shining House
were redolent of them.
Mr. Father and Mrs. Mother sighed
deeply as they read the newspapers.
Carolus, the manservant, and
Mrs. Amelia, the cook, gossiped in
undertones at the washinq-machine.
Even Mr. Turnbull seemed to have lost
his trumpeting voice.
MAURICE DRUON, the French novelist,
was born in Paris in 1918. His numerous
works include plays, essays and novels.
His books have been translated into many
languages. Among the best known are:
"Les Grandes Families" ("The Curtain
Falls", Hart-Davis, London, and Scribner,
New York, 1959); "Les Rois Maudits"
("The Accursed Kings", a historical group
of several volumes; Hart-Davis, London and
Scribner, New York, 1956); "Les Mémoires
de Zeus" ("The Memoirs of Zeus", Hart-
Davis, London and Scribner, New York,
1964). "Tistou of the Green Fingers" has
been translated into 1 1 languages. Mau¬
rice Drouon was elected to the Académie
Française in 1966.
"As they read the newspapers,
Tistou caught words of ill omen:
'tension'... 'crisis'... The next day
another word was on everyone's
lips: 'war'."
Tistou caught words of ill-omen on
the wing.
"Tension..." said Mr. Father, his
voice grave.
"Crisis..." replied Mrs. Mother.
" Worsening... " added Mr. Turnbull.
Tistou thought they were talking of
illness ; he was very concerned and
went off, his fingers at the ready, to
find out which member of the house¬
hold could be ill.
A turn In the garden proved to him
that he was wrong: Whiskers was in
perfect health, the thorough-bred
roans were gambolling in the field,
Gymnast showed every sign of being
in perfect condition.
But the next day another word was
on everyone's lips.
" War... it was inevitable, " said
Mr. Father.
" War... poor people I " said
Mrs. Mother, sorrowfully shaking her
head.
"War... and there we arel Just
another one, " said Mr. Turnbull. " It
only remains to be seen who'll win. "
" War... how terrible I Shall we
never have done with them? " groaned
Mrs. Amelia, on the point of tears.
"War... war... always wars", repeat¬
ed Carolus, the manservant.
Tistou thought of war as something
improper since people spoke about it
with lowered voices, as something
ugly, a grown-up disease worse than
drunkenness, crueller than poverty,
more dangerous than crime. Mr.
Turnbull had already mentioned war
to him and shown him the Bright-
bourne War Memorial. But since
Mr. Turnbull had spoken rather loudly,
Tistou had not properly understood
him.
Tistou was not afraid. There was
nothing of the coward about the boy;
in certain respects he might indeed
have been thought rash. You have
already seen how he used to slide
down the banisters. When he went
to the river to bathe, he had to be
stopped diving off the champions' high
dive ten times in succession. He would
take a run and launch himself Into
the air, his arms widespread, in a
swallowdive.
But his Idea of war had nothing
to do with courage or fear. He
merely found the Idea intolerable, that
was all.
He wanted information. Was war
really as horrible as he imagined it
to be ? Obviously, the first person
to consult was Whiskers.
" I hope I'm not interrupting you,
Mr. Whiskers," he said to the gard¬
ener, who was clipping a box hedge.
Whiskers put down his shears.
" Not at all, not at all, my boy. "
" Mr. Whiskers, tell me, what do
you think about war?"
The gardener looked surprised.
."I'm against it," he replied, tugging
at his whiskers.

"Have you actually seen gardens annihilated by war?",
asked Tistou. "Yes", replied Mr. Whiskers, "I've seen
a garden full of flowers die in two minutes."
" Why are you against it ? "
" Because... because even a little,
unimportant war can annihilate a very
big garden. "
" Annihilate, what does that mean ? "
" It means destroy, abolish, reduce
to dust. "
" Really ? And have you actually
seen gardens... annihilated by war,
Mr. Whiskers ? " asked Tistou.
It seemed barely credible. But the
gardener was not joking. He stood
with bent head, his thick white eye¬
brows contracted in a frown, twisting
his whiskers in his fingers.
" Yes, yes, I've seen it happen, "
he replied. " I've seen a garden full
of flowers die in two minutes. I saw
the greenhouses smashed into a
thousand pieces. So many bombs
fell in that garden that It was no use
ever thinking of cultivating it again.
Even the earth was dead. "
Tistou felt his throat contract.
" And whose garden was it ? " he
asked.
" It was mine, " said Whiskers,
turning away to hide his grief, and
picking up his shears.
Tistou was silent for a moment. He
was thinking. He was trying to imagine
the garden about him destroyed as
Whiskers's garden had been, the
greenhouses broken and the earth
barren of flowers. Tears came to his
eyes.
"Well, I shall go and tell everyone
about it I " he cried. " Everyone
must know. I shall tell Amelia and I
shall tell Carolus... "
" Oh, Carolus is worse off than I
am. He lost his country. "
"His country? He lost his country
in a war? How Is that possible?"
" Well, it's what happened. His
country has completely disappeared.
He could never find it again. That's
why he's here. "
" I was quite right In thinking that
war is a horrible thing, if you can lose
your country in it like you lose a hand¬
kerchief, " Tistou thought.
" There's even worse than that, "
Whiskers added. " You mentioned
Amelia, the cook. Well, Amelia lost
her son. Others have lost arms or
legs, or their heads even. Everyone
loses something in a war. "
It occurred to Tistou that war was
the greatest and most horrible disor¬
der that could happen In the world,
since everyone lost in it what they
loved best.
" What can be done to prevent its
happening?..." he wondered.
Mr. Turnbull must be against war,
since he hates disorder so much. I
shall talk to him about it to-morrow. "
Mr. Turnbull was sitting behind his
desk. He had recovered his trumpet¬
like voice and was shouting Into three
telephones at the same time. It was
clear that Mr. Turnbull was a very
busy man.
" It's always the same when a war
breaks out somewhere in the world, "
he said to Tistou. " Our work at
Brightbourne is doubled at once. "
And, Indeed, Tistou had noticed that
morning that the factory siren had
blown for twice the usual length
of time and that twice the usual
number of workers had appeared. The
nine chimneys were making so much
smoke that the whole sky was
darkened.
" I'll come back when you're not so
busy, " said Tistou.
" What did you want to ask me ? "
" I wanted to know where this war
has broken out. "
Mr. Turnbull rose to his feet and
led Tistou to an enormous globe of the
world. He turned It round and placed
his finger on the centre of it.
" Do you see this desert ? " he
asked. " Well, it's there. "
Under Mr. Tumbull's finger Tistou
saw a pink, lozenge-shaped expanse.
" Why has the war happened there,
Mr. Turnbull?"
"It's not very difficult to under¬
stand."
When Mr Turnbull said something
was not very difficult to understand,

"Mr. Whiskers, what do you think
about war," asked Tistou. "I'm
against it," replied the gardener.

TISTOU (Continued)
54
Tistou's heart sank ; it was generally
very complicated indeed. But this
time Tistou was determined to listen
attentively.
" Not at all difficult, " repeated
Mr. Turnbull. " This desert belongs
to nobody... "
" To nobody, " Tistou repeated to
himself.
" ... But on the right is the country
of the Go-Its, and on the left the
country of the Get-outs. "
" Go-its... Get-outs..." Tistou repeat¬
ed to himself once more; he was
really being very attentive.
" ... Well, some time ago the Go-its
announced that they wanted this
desert ; the Get-outs replied that they
wanted it too. The Go-its sent a
telegram to the Get-outs telling them
to go away. The Get-outs replied by
radio that they forbade the Go-its to
remain in occupation; so now their
armies are on the march and when
they meet there'll be a battle. "
" What is there in that pink lozen¬
ge... I mean in that desert?"
" Nothing at all. Stones... "
" So they're just going to fight for
stones ? "
" They want to own what's under¬
neath. "
"What's under the desert?"
"Oil."
"What do they want oil for?"
" They want it so that the others
can't have it. They want oil, because
oil's an essential material for making
war. "
Tistou had known that Mr. Turnbull's
explanations would become very
difficult to understand.
He shut his eyes In order to think
better.
" If I've understood properly, the
Go-its and the Get-outs are going to
fight a war for oil because oil is an
essential material for fighting wars. "
He reopened his eyes.
Tistou has a lesson in geography,
followed by a lesson in business;
the conflict between the Go-its and the
Get-outs spreads in an unforseen manner
"Well, It's stupid," he said.
Mr. Turnbull's ears turned scarlet.
" Do you want to get O for your
lesson, Tistou ? "
" No, " replied Tistou, " but what I
do want is that the Go-its and the
Get-outs should not fight."
This proof of goodheartedness for
the moment ameliorated Mr. Turnbull's
anger.
" Of course, of course, " he said,
shrugging his shoulders. " No one
wants war, ever. But it has always
existed... "
" What can I do ? " wondered Tis¬
tou. " Put my fingers on the pink
lozenge ? "
" Is the desert far away ? " he
asked.
" Half-way between here and the
other side of the world. "
" So the war can't spread as far as
Brightbourne ? "
"It's not impossible. Once a war's
begun, one can never tell where it
will end. The Go-its may call a Great
Power to their assistance, the Get-outs
ask help of another. And the two
Great Powers will fight. It's what's
called an extension of the conflict. "
Tistou's head was positively buzzing.
" Yes ", he said to himself. " War's
really like some appalling sort of
couch-grass growing on the face of
the globe. What plants can I use to
fight it with?"
" We'll now go to the factory, "
said Mr. Turnbull. " You'll see it
working to capacity ; it'll be an Instruc¬
tive lesson for you. "
He shouted some orders into his
three telephones and then accompa¬
nied Tistou downstairs.
Tistou was at first deafened by the
noise. The steam-hammers were
banging away with all their might, the
machines were humming like a million
spinning-tops, chains were clanging ;
one had to shout to make oneself
heard, even with a voice like Mr. Turn-
bull's.
Tistou was blinded by the fountains
of sparks rising on all sides; molten
"The armaments
were being
packed up with
as much care as if
they had been
china."

steel gushing down to the floor like
huge burning brooks; the heat was
appalling, the workmen seemed small
and black against the huge back¬
ground of the factory.
After the foundry, Tistou visited the
burnishing, turning and fitting depart¬
ments, the departments where rifles,
machine-guns, tanks and trucks were
made, for Mr. Father's factory made
everything required for making war in
the way of arms and munitions.
The following day was the day for
despatching and the armaments were
being packed up with as much care
as if they been china.
Finally, Mr. Turnbull showed Tistou
two huge guns, as long as cathedral
spires. They were as bright and
gleaming as if they had been covered
with butter.
Suspended on chains, the guns
moved slowly through the air ; then
they were lowered gently, gently, on to
truck-trailers which were so long you
couldn't see the end of them.
"Those are the guns which have
brought wealth to Brightbourne, Tis¬
tou, " said Mr. Turnbull proudly. " With
every shell they fire they can destroy
four homes as big as yours "
This information did not appear to
impress Tistou with a similar pride.
" So, " he thought, " each time one
of these guns fires, there'll be four
Tistous without a home, four Caroluses
without a staircase, and four Amelias
without a kitchen... Those must be
the things by which people lose their
gardens, their countries, their legs or
members of their families... Well,
really I "
And the hammers were pounding
and the furnaces glowing white hot.
" Whose side are you on, Mr. Turn-
bull ? " Tistou asked, shouting at the
top of his voice because of the
appalling din.
"What's that?"
" I said: whose side are you on in
this war?"
" Oh, the Go-its, " Mr. Turnbull
shouted back.
"And my father?"
" He is, too. "
" Why ? "
" Because they've been our loyal
friends for a long while. "
" Of course, " thought Tistou, " if
one's friends are attacked it's quite
right to help them defend themselves. "
" So those guns are going to the
Go-its ? " he went on.
" Only the one on the right," shout
ed Mr. Turnbull. "The other's for
the Get-outs. "
" How do you mean, for the Get-
outs ? " cried Tistou Indignantly.
" Because they're good customers,
too. "
So one Brightbourne gun would be
firing against another Brightbourne
gun, and a garden would be destroyed
on each side I
" That's business, " Mr. Turnbull
added.
"Well, I think your business is
horrible I "
"What's that?" asked Mr. Turn-
bull, lowering his head because the
noise of the steam-hammers drowned
Tistou's voice.
" I said that your business is hor¬
rible, because... "
A terrific box on the ear stopped
him short. The conflict between the
Go-its and the Get-outs had been
suddenly extended to Tistou's ear.
" That's what war's like I You ask
for an explanation, you give your opi¬
nion and what happens ? You get
a box on the earl I Supposing I made
some holly grow In your trousers,
what would you say then ? " thought
Tistou, as he gazed at Mr. Turnbull
with his eyes full of tears. " That's
it, holly in his trousers, or perhaps
thistles... I "
He clasped his fingers together...
And it was then that the idea, the
great idea, came to him.
The business lesson, as you can
well imagine, tame to an end there.
Tistou got two Os, and Mr. Turnbull

TISTOU (Continued)
Surprising pieces of news
follow hard upon each other
reported him at once to Mr. Father.
The latter was extremely disappointed.
His Tistou, who was one day to suc¬
ceed him and become the master of
Brightbourne, was really showing very
little propensity for controlling so
splendid a business.
" I shall really have to talk to him
very seriously, " said Mr. Father.
"Where Is he?"
" He's gone to take refuge with the
gardener, as usual, " replied Mr. Turn-
bull.
" Very well, we'll see about that
later. At the moment we must finish
the packing. "
Because of the urgent orders, the
factory was working without stopping.
All night long, the nine chimneys wore
great, red, glowing crowns.
But, that night, Mr. Father, who had
not even taken time off to dine and
was watching the work of the depart¬
ments from a little glass tower, was
pleasantly surprised. Tistou had
returned to the factory and was walk¬
ing slowly along the line of packing-
cases containing rifles, then he
climbed into the trucks, leaned over
the engines and slipped In among the
big guns.
" Well done, Tistou, " Mr. Father
said to himself. " The boy's trying to
make up for his double 0. Splendid 1
There's still some hope for him I "
And, Indeed, Tistou had never
appeared so serious and so busy
before I His hair was standing straight
up on end. He was continually put¬
ting his hand in his pocket and
pulling out little pieces of paper.
" It even looks as If he were taking
notes, " thought Mr. Father. " I hope
he doesn't pinch his fingers among
those machine-guns. He's a good boy
when all's said and done, and quick
to see when he's at fault. "
There were surprises in store for
Mr. Father.
¿
"Ivy, briony, bindweed, ampélopsis, knot-grass and dodder
formed an Inextricable skein about the guns."
Everyone knows that newspapers
always talk of war in capital letters.
These letters are kept In a special
tray. And it was precisely before this
capital-letter-tray that the editor of
the Brightbourne Star, a well-known
daily newspaper, was standing in
some hesitation.
The editor kept turning about,
sighing and wiping his forehead, which
is always a sign of emotion and per¬
plexity. The man was most disturbed.
Sometimes he took out a big capi¬
tal letter, the kind that is kept for
important victories ; but immediately
put it back again. Sometimes he took
out a medium-sized capital letter, the
kind that is kept for wars which are
not going very well, for campaigns
which show no signs of coming to an
end, or for unexpected retreats. But
this size of capital letter would not
do either ; he put it back in the
cupboard.
At one moment he seemed to have
made up his mind to use very small
capital letters, the kind that are used
for announcements which put everyone
In a bad temper, like sugar shortage
or new tax on jam. But these would
not do either. And the editor of the
Brightbourne Star sighed all the more.
He was really very disturbed indeed.
He had to tell the inhabitants of
Brightbourne, his faithful readers, a
piece of news that was so unexpected,
and so serious in its consequences,
that he did not know how to set about
It. The war between the Go-its and
the Get-outs had miscarried. And how
was one to admit to the public that
a war could just stop like that, without
a winning or a losing side, without an
international conference, without
anything at all ?
The poor editor would have loved
to have been able to print right along
the top of his first page some sensa¬
tional headline such as LIGHTNING
GO-IT ADVANCE or HEAVY GET-
OUT OFFENSIVE.
But this was out of the question.
The reports from the pink patch on
the map were definite: the war had
not taken place and the reason for its
failure to do so cast doubts upon the
quality of the arms delivered by
the Brightbourne factory, upon Mr.
Father's technical competence and
that of this workshops and workers.
In fact, a disaster had occured.
Let us try, with the editor of the

Brightbourne Star, to reconstruct these
tragic events.
Climbing, romping, clinging plants
had taken root In the cases of arms I
How had they got there? Why? No
one could explain.
Ivy, briony, bindweed, ampélopsis,
knot-grass and dodder had formed
an inextricable skein, matted with the
glue of the black henbane about the
machine-guns, sub-machine-guns and
revolvers.
Neither the Go-its nor the Get-outs
had been able to unpack their cases.
The correspondents, in their des¬
patches, emphasized the particularly
harmful qualities of burdock, which
had fastened itself by means of the
little hooks upon its burs to the
bayonets. What could be done with
rifles that flowered, with bayonets that
you couldn't poke and whose effi¬
ciency was completely destroyed by
pretty bunches of flowers ? They had
to be thrown away.
Equally useless were the magnificent
trucks, which had been so conscien¬
tiously camouflaged with grey and
yellow lines I Brambles, goose-grass
and several varieties of nettles, the
stinging variety In particular, were
growing In abundance upon their seats.
The drivers all got nettle rash, and
were thus the only casualties in the
war. White-coated nurses made these
soldiers, whom cruel ¡tchings preven¬
ted from sitting down, lie still while
they applied warm compresses.
And here must be recorded a really
pitiful incident caused by balsam. That
a modest wild flower should be able
to create a panic among soldiers is
perfectly comprehensible if you know
that balsam has pods which explode
at the slightest touch.
The engines were all full of it. Bal¬
sam swarmed in the carburettors of
the armoured cars, in the tanks of the
motor-bicycles. At the first contact of
the selfstarter, at the first kick at the
starting-pedal, there was a growing,
spreading sound of dull explosions
which, If they did no harm, neverthe¬
less had a shattering effect on the
morale of the troops.
What of the tanks ? Their turrets
were blocked up. Eglantine mingled
with gorse and herbbennet enclosed
their mechanism in a mass of roots,
clusters, stalks and thorny branches.
The tanks were also, therefore,
useless.
A rain of foxgloves, bluebells and
cornflowers had fallen on the Go-its'
positions and they had replied, ¡nun-
dating the Get-outs with buttercups,
daisies and cowslips. A general had
had his cap knocked off by a bunch
of violets.
Countries are not taken with roses,
and battles of flowers have never
been looked on as very serious
engagements.
Peace between the Go-its and the
Get-outs was concluded on the spot.
The armies retired and the desert, a
pink-coloured lozenge, was left to the
sky, to solitude and to freedom.
