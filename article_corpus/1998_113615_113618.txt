Climate change:
Judging by the number of unresolved
disagreements, the next round of negotiations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions looks like it
will be poisonous. Despite the initial consensus
formalized by the Kyoto Protocol signed in Japan
last December, major divisions remain. The
United States wants to postpone any reductions
in domestic energy consumption. Europe,
although dragging its feet, has shown greater
willingness to respect commitments made under
the Protocol. And the developing countries refuse
to sacrifice economic growth to reduce a global
threat for which they do not feel responsible
The greenhouse gas t ra d e
The Kyoto Protocol to cut carbon
emissions in industrialized countri e s
is increasingly understood not as an
e nvironmental agreement but perhaps as
one of the most significant trade
a greements of the century. G i ven the
e n o rmous stakes invo l ve d , it is in the
interest of developing countri e s , like India
and China, to fully explore the implicat i o n s
of the Protocol instead of succumbing to
We s t e rn pressure to accept it.
It is important to recognize that the
P r o t o c o l , signed in December 1997, s t i l l
marks a step forward in the wo r l d ’s resolve to
a rrest the problem of human-induced climat e
c h a n g e . This is of particular concern for
d e veloping countri e s , which are twice as
vulnerable to the resulting damage as
i n d u s t rialized nat i o n s , according to the
I n t e r g ove rnmental Panel on Climate Change
( I P C C ) , set up by the United Nations in
1 9 8 8 . S e veral commentat o rs , especially in
the We s t , h ave pointed out the Protocol’s
possible ineffectiveness. But it also neglects
the long-term interests of the current and
future generations of developing countries.
Under the Protocol, i n d u s t ri a l i z e d
c o u n t ries are expected to cut their ove r a l l
emissions by at least five percent below 1990
l e vels between 2008 and 2012.The problem
is that compliance has been reduced to a
n u m b e rs game in which countries promising
a higher “percentage reduction”are seen as
good playe rs and those arguing for lowe r
percentages are the difficult ones. This is a
smokescreen drawing attention away from
the real issue at stake: the heaviest emitters of
greenhouse gases, namely industri a l i z e d
c o u n t ri e s , can continue polluting through
an accounting system which allows them to
meet their promised emissions reductions
targets without actually reducing emissions.
The key to this accounting lies in the
b a s e - year calculations which help to
d e t e rmine the “assigned amount ” o f
greenhouse gases each country can emit. If a
c o u n t ry does not fully use its assigned
a m o u n t , it can then sell the remaining port i o n
to another country. High calculations could
give countries a head start in meeting their
“percentage requirements” l ater because they
simply phase out industries which we r e
grinding to a halt regardless of the Protocol.
This system offers a perve rse incentive
for developing countries to actually increase
their emissions as fast as possible so that if and
when they do set their base-year calculat i o n s ,
they too will have a head start in meeting
their percentage reductions.This is perhaps
the worst aspect of the Protocol:developing
c o u n t ries which move towards energy
e f f i c i e n cy in a big way today will find it harder
and more expensive to meet high percentage

t he d e b a t e h e a t s u p
“Meaningful part i c i p at i o n ” has prove n
to be a vague and perhaps misleading
concept in the Protocol. For example,
A rticle 12 ostensibly promotes Nort h - S o u t h
c o o p e r ation by setting up a Clean
D e velopment Mechanism (CDM) to
encourage industrialized countries to inve s t
in carbon-efficient technology in the South.
H owe ve r , the purpose of the CDM is not to
help the South but to explicitly “ a s s i s t ”
i n d u s t rialized countries to meet their
commitments to reduce emissions. U n d e r
the plan,d e veloping countries sell “ c e rt i fie d
r e d u c t i o n ” units to industrialized countri e s
and pri vate corp o r ations in exchange for
i nvestment in carbon-efficient progr a m m e s.
The units can be used as credits in the
“balance sheets” of the Protocol’s carbon
accounting system.
The CDM is riddled with moral and
economic loopholes.One can begin by asking
reductions later when base year emissions
are set. On the other hand, those countries
which continue using high-emission
technologies and fuels will find it relatively
easy to accept high percentage reductions
and as a result will look good in front of the
world.
“Meaningful
participation”
Yet despite this fatal we a k n e s s , the North is
putting tremendous pressure on deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to take part in the Protocol.U n i t e d
S t ates Vice President Al Gore could not have
been more direct when speaking to a press
conference in Kyoto on 8 December 1997:
“In order to sign an agr e e m e n t , or in order to
send an agreement to the Senat e , we must
h ave meaningful part i c i p ation by key
d e veloping countri e s.”

An iceberg detaches from Antarctica. Will global warming melt the polar ice caps?
if there is no other role for developing countri e s
in combating climate change than just helping
i n d u s t rialized countries meet their
c o m m i t m e n t s. It is important to realize that
under the scheme, i n d u s t rialized countri e s
need not change anything domestically by
i nvesting in projects in the South.
At the same time, the CDM offers the
N o rth a way of buying the part i c i p ation of
the South.But at what price? It is clearly in
the interest of the North to keep the prices of
“emission reduction”units as low as possible.
The US administrat i o n , for example, plans on
buying as many emission units as possible at
the cheapest cost. So it is not altogether
s u rp rising to find A m e rican authori t i e s
offering as little as $14 to $23 per tonne for
emissions credits. In contrast, a domestic
emission reduction programme is estimat e d
to run $125 per tonne.
The CDM is designed to ensure that the
North has the cheapest array of projects to
choose from in the South. Under the CDM,
numerous cert i fic ation agencies will assess
i n t e rnal compliance and report i n g
mechanisms of countries selling emission
reduction units. This will force deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to compete with each other in
p r oviding the North with the cheapest,m o s t
efficient portfolios of projects to invest in.
One thing is clear. C l i m ate change has
been taken out of the world of the
e nvironmental lobby and placed in the wo r l d
of money. The goal is now to trade this
commodity (emissions) without limits and
without the interference of prickly issues like
the property rights of the poor.
The cheap deal
may be the most expensive
N ow let us assume that this brokering system
works in the short term and deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries do move towards more energy-
efficient technologi e s. A longer-term
perspective raises important questions.The
more efficient these countries become the
less economic incentive there is for the
industrialized countries to invest in them.It
will eventually be cheaper for the North to
i nvest in its own countri e s. And if global
wa rming is still a threat—as it would be
because industrialized countries had not

generations.
The principles of this emissions trade will
be further elaborated at Nove m b e r ’s
Conference of Pa rties in Buenos A i r e s.T h i s
is the occasion,h owe ve r , to go a step furt h e r
in recognizing and building upon the
p rinciple of “equal per capita entitlements”
in which all individuals have the right to emit
the same amount of greenhouse gases.T h i s
s t r ategy would be used to calculate emissions
entitlements based on each country ’s
p o p u l at i o n . Not only would such a step be
globally just, but it would offer the best way
to move towards the ultimate objective of the
F r a m e work Convention on Climate Change
(the ori gins of the Kyoto Protocol), n a m e l y
the stabilization of the at m o s p h e ri c
c o n c e n t r ations of greenhouse gases. T h i s
equitable approach is far more effective
than the creat i ve accounting strategy of the
P r o t o c o l .
Discussions in Buenos Aires must also
take into account the rapid rate at which
d e veloping countries are gr ow i n g . If they did
accept the Protocol, they would have “ a s s i g n e d
a m o u n t s ”of emissions.H owe ve r ,it is unlikely
they could make full use of these entitlements
in the near future. I n s t e a d , an equitable and
e nvironmental solution lies in letting them
trade this unused entitlement later as their
economies deve l o p. This provision wo u l d
i m m e d i ately gi ve them the incentive to trade—
not merely to help industrialized countri e s
meet their targets—as well as to move towa r d s
a low-emissions development path in which the
trading benefits and options stay open as long
as possible.
This economic environment would help
c r e ate a global market for We s t e rn solar
energy technologi e s — f i rst in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries and then in industrialized nat i o n s —
to help kick-start the global transition towa r d s
zero-emissions technologi e s.The faster these
t e c h n o l o gies invade the energy sector, t h e
quicker the world would be able to avert the
t h r e at of climate change. In this way,
developing countries would, to use the US
p h r a s e , enter the most meaningful form of
participation. n
