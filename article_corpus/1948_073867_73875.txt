Educational, Scientific and Cultural
RECONSTRUCTION
'"It is estimated that by the end of 1948 over S50. 000, 000 will have
been distributed in educational relief by various bodies, in most cases
in response to Unesco's campaign for educational reconstruction.
Furthrmore, nearly $400, 000 will have been expended out of Unesco
funds for emergency equipment"writes Dr. Huxley in his arnual
report on the activities of Unesco during the current year. This
report which has just been published has served as the basis for the
"Year Roundup"wbich we are presenting on this page.
IN order to advance educational,scientific and cultural recon-
struction in the war-devastated
countries, Unesco has been
working during 1948, with the
organs of the UN and other
Specialized Agencies and with
international non-governmental
bodies by providing the Secreta-
riat for TICER. Unesco has col-
lected and analyzed evid< : nce of
needs and s : imulated campaigns
for voluntary aid. It has provided
books, materials and equipment
to a limited extent through emer-
gency grants, and aided in etab-
lishing national book exchange
centres. It has worked with
organizations on the educational
problems of war-handicapped
children and on voluntary work
camps.
This year, for example. the
Director-General points out in
his annual report to the General
Conference that"members of the
Secretariat have undertaken field
surveys of educational, scientific
and cultural needs in Burma.
China, India. Malava. Sarawak.
North Borneo, the Philippines
and Malta".
'"The Governments of Austria,
Belgium, Burma, China. Czecho-
slovakia, France, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Netherlands. Pakistan and
the Philippines have submitted...

and other cultural institu"ons."
This information has been
analyzed, prepared In document
form and distributed to mter-
ested Member S : ates and nation-
al organizat : ons active in edu-
cational reconstruction.

Referring to the Importance
of collecting accurate inform-
tion on needs and sources of
supply of publication, Dr. Huxley
states :
"One of the main factors
enabling Unesco to carry ou'this
function successfully is the pub-
lication and distribution of the
Unesco Bulletin for Libraries. The
Bulletin is now a well-established
mternational library service. It
has been issued everv tor. month
since April, 1947, contains 40
pages, is bi-lingual and is discl'l-
buted... to about 6, 500 institu-
tions."
