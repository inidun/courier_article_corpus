After more than a decade of war and
i n t e rnal confli c t , peace officially retur-
ned to Nicaragua in May 1990.T h o u-
sands of members of the so-called “ C o n t r a
a rmy ” laid down their weapons and tens of
thousands of reservists and soldiers were reti-
r e d .M a ny of them automatically swelled the
a rmy of the unemploye d .
“When the war ended, we didn’t know
w h at to do, we felt exposed. I got a job in a
fa c t o ry at the Las Mercedes industrial free
trade zone, picking up garbage and cleaning
m a c h i n e ry,” s ays Eugenia. Her experience is
echoed by many women working in the
c o u n t ry ’s m a q u i l a1 assembly industri e s.E u g e-
nia never thinks of leaving her job. “ T h e r e
a r e n ’t any other fa c t o ri e s ” she say s ,“and I’m
40 ye a rs old, so I have to stay where I am and
put up with things without complaining.”
Violence
The Las Mercedes free zone curr e n t l y
has more than 20 textile assembly plants,
most of them A s i a n - owned and directly pro-
viding over 18,000 jobs, 80 per cent of them
held by wo m e n .These fa c t o ries export e d
more than $135 million wo rth of goods in
1 9 9 7 , compared with the slightly more than
$200 million earned by the country ’s main
e x p o rt , c o f f e e . For many ye a rs , the local
media attacked the violation of labour law s
by the fa c t o ri e s.Women in particular we r e
the victims of persistent phy s i c a l ,p s y c h o l o-
gical and verbal abu s e .They were also fir e d
simply because they became pregnant.
“There was a really violent aspect to life
in the free zone,” s ays Sandra Ramos, l e a d e r
of the María Elena Cuadra Movement of
Working and Unemployed Wo m e n .“ To try
to end the abu s e s , we forced a code of
conduct on the assembly plants.”
The 10-article code deals with mat t e rs
like mat e rnity leave , working hours , ove rt i m e
wa g e s , regular medical checkups and job secu-
ri t y. It is the first of its kind to be negotiat e d
and put into effect in Central A m e ri c a ,w h e r e
there are about 1,100 such fa c t o ri e s
e m p l oying more than 300,000 wo r k e rs.
Under the banner, “ Wo r k , ye s — but with
d i g n i t y ! ” (the slogan of a coalition of wo m e n ’s
labour groups lobbying for codes of conduct
across Central A m e ri c a ) , the Nicaraguan ini-
t i at i ve owes its success to wo r k e rs ’d e t e rm i-
n ation and strong public support which took
the shape of a 30,000-signature petition.
The ministry of labour made the code a
m i n i s t e rial edict on Ja n u a ry 23,1 9 9 8 .W i t h i n
about a we e k , all of the fa c t o ry ow n e rs of Las
Mercedes accepted the code in an open letter
to the labour minister:“ We have decided of
our own accord to comply with the ministe-
rial edict because we think it will improve and
h a rmonize relations between employe rs and
e m p l oye e s.”
Working conditions slowly began to get
b e t t e r.A survey carried out in Ja n u a ry 1999
by the María Elena Cuadro Movement sho-
wed that since the code was adopted most
wo r k e rs (95 per cent of the 2,562 wo m e n
polled) had not been victims of the kind of
m i s t r e atment common up until then.T h e
s u rvey also found that fa c t o ries began ope-
ning creches and food areas where wo r k e rs
could eat meals brought from home or
bought from ve n d o rs. But the wo r k e rs also
said there was a long way to go before they
had social securi t y, decent wages and good
fa c t o ry hy gi e n e .The average monthly wa g e
was less than $100, far below the estimat e d
cost of a fa m i l y ’s basic needs of around $150
a month.
“ R e g u l ation of foreign investment in
Nicaragua is inadequat e ,” s ays Ramos. B a c-
ked by women MPs, her movement is now
pushing for parliament to reform the law s
governing the free trade zone.“The code of
conduct was a first step,” she say s ,“ but it’s
only a means to an end.”
The whole matter is a tricky one, h owe-
ve r , and demands caution. Ramos says inter-
n ational consumer campaigns to press for
codes of ethics can be ri s k y. Pressure applied
the wrong way could lead to closure of the
factories and the loss of local jobs.
‘Clean’ clothes
“At intern ational leve l , some people are
campaigning with good will, but others are see-
king to advance their own national interests
through these campaigns.”The Nicaraguan acti-
vists are against,for example,b oycotting Central
A m e ri c a ’s free trade zones.They are also oppo-
sed to the idea that consumers in rich countri e s
should only buy locally-made goods.Tr a d e
unions in the United States in particular have
promoted this approach, which Ramos rejects
as nat i o n a l i s t i c. On the other hand,“ We think
the campaign in Europe for ‘ c l e a n ’ clothing pro-
d u c t s , which doesn’t talk about a boycott bu t
about improving working conditions, is more
e f f e c t i ve ,” she says of campaigns like that of
O x fam (see article page 37).
“ W h at we ask campaigners in rich coun-
t ries to do is negotiate directly with the big
textile firms there so they respect wo r k e rs ’
rights in their fa c t o ries in poor countries and
l ater to organize an independent inspection to
check whether the fa c t o ry ow n e rs are kee-
ping their word.
“ A ny way,” s ays Ramos, “the code of
conduct isn’t something invented in the Nort h .
It was thought up by women of the South.We
h ave n ’t copied any foreign model.” n
