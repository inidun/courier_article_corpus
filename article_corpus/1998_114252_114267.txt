A “high-rise”smart car
exhibition centre.
■
If you look at the adve rtisements of any car
m a n u fa c t u r e r , their most striking feature is
the vehicle the firm wants to sell you.Its qua-
lities are presented in all kinds of ways designed to
whet the customer’s appetite—its gleaming body-
work (for people who like an eye - c atching product),
its reliability (to attract careful dri ve rs ) , its size (for
the family motorist), its sobriety (to curry favour
with the environmentalists; the throaty roar of its
e n gine to excite roadhogs.The product dictates the
message.
A d ve rtisements for the so-called “ s m a rt ” c a r
( a lways deliberately written with a small “s”) are
doing exactly the opposite.There is nothing on the
c over of the smart car brochure except a tiny phrase
right in the middle of the page which says in ver y
simple letteri n g : “reduce to the max”. This is
understandable for a “car configurator”(the word
“ m a n u fa c t u r e r ” is shunned) which in recent we e k s
has been adve rtising a car only 2.5 metres long
including the bumpers.
The firm’s website is a bit more forthcoming.
The first page has two sentences each dominated by
a huge “P”—“A product with a philosophy ” a n d
“A philosophy with a product”. Hans Jürg Schär,
head of sales and marketing, calls it “ t wo - t h i r d s
product and one-third philosophy”.
What may turn out to be a revolution in a sec-
tor which symbolizes the industrial world began
with an observat i o n , an inventor and a colossus.
The observation was that on journeys through



A philosophy on four wheels
Even in a traditional sector like the automobile industry,
the idea of selling a service—mobility—rather than the car to provide it,
is gaining ground


t owns for work reasons, only one car in five had
someone in the front passenger seat and only one in
ten had anyone in the back.
So the developers of the “smart”came up with
a car which,they say, “generously”has two seats in
front and,“after studying the problem”, no seats in
the back. This mini-car also takes up only half a
parking space, thus easing an infuriating problem
for urban motorists.
The inventor is Nicolas G. H aye k , the Swiss
designer of the Swatch,which shook up the watch
i n d u s t ry. Without his “ideas and determ i n at i o n ” ,
s ays Schär, the project would have stayed on the
d r aw i n g - b o a r d . It is not surp rising that the little
car seems so much like a toy or a ball, coloured and
a d j u s t a b l e , whose ow n e rs can change its body
panels whenever they like.And it was Hayek who,
by putting his “dream world”on the table,persua-
ded the colossus—Mercedes—to help set up the
new firm Micro Compact Car (MCC).
The personal mobility concept
This alliance of inventiveness and established
k n ow - h ow might have simply produced something
which was ori ginal and technically sound. But MCC
s ays it is selling much more than that . It offers a “ p h i-
l o s o p hy ” in the form of a serv i c e : “ p e rsonal mobi-
l i t y ” .
The bu yer gets a car with four wheels at a pri c e
which includes a package of guarantees, m a i n t e-
n a n c e , r e p a i rs , insurance and easy payment term s ,
but all manufa c t u r e rs make similar offers these day s.
The difference is that the owner of a “ s m a rt ” a l s o
