It’s a modern phenomenon, which only deve-
loped at the end of the 1930s, when football,
hitherto the reserve of a select group, became
a mass sport . The game spread and grew in the
1960s and 1970s and its fans got yo u n g e r. T h e
average football supporter today is aged between 15
and 25.And for some time now, it hasn’t just been
a specifically British phenomenon. Fa n atical devo-
tion to a team, and sometimes to a sporting hero, h a s
steadily taken hold on all five continents. Suppor-
ters’mania is now universal,with pretty much the
same motives and forms eve ry w h e r e , but it still
springs from local roots.
Different styles of football derive from distinc-
tive body movements established in different cul-
t u r e s. The names gi ven to support e rs va ry from
place to place and sum up the way they behave .T h e
word “ s u p p o rt e r ” , used by the English and then the
F r e n c h , c o nveys the idea of force and backing
behind a team.The Brazilian t o r c e d o r screws up his
face in wo rry as a match proceeds.The Italian t i fo s i
s u f f e rs from t i fo, an illness marked by fever and
twitchiness.
Initiation into this brotherhood can come very
e a r l y, from the moment a fat h e r , an uncle, a brother
or a godfather gi ves a newborn child the jersey of a
favourite team.It can also happen later on,while a
child is growing up. With neighbours and school-
m at e s , he plays football in the street or with a team,
listens to or watches match reports, discusses the
game with friends and finally goes to the stadium
himself.
Once there, he—and more and more she—and
an older relative will go and join the group of sup-
p o rt e rs who back the same team as they do.The ri va l
fans face each other in the stands behind one  of the
g o a l m o u t h s. The energy they generat e , t h r o u g h
new collective emotions and forms of expression,
produces new identities of class, neighbourhood,
region,religion and country.
Until not so long ago, the layout of the stadiums
h e l ped all this along. S p e c t at o rs packed into big open
areas on the edge of the pitch, and terraces without
numbered seats. Modern stadiums have become
more comfortable, and security measures tend to
put a damper on collective emotions. But although
violence still persists,it is orchestrated,as the fans
sing, chant slogans and shout witticisms or insults
at the other side’s playe rs and the referee. A spot of
c r e at i ve stage management and choreogr a p hy turn s
it into a sort of carnival.
The spectacle of the match enables the sup-
p o rt e rs to experience a moment when a society
becomes aware of itself, when a coherent gr o u p
expresses its identity through non-religious ri t u a l s.
The fans are drawn to stadiums because both the
match and the spectacle that goes with it have the-
rapeutic and cathartic functions,which are vital in
modern urban industrial society, where people are
obliged to exercise great self-discipline and always
hide their feelings. A sporting event provides an
outlet because it teaches a person to develop a
controlled expression of emotions which have to be
curbed in other circumstances.
“A society which doesn’t gi ve its members ,
especially young people, sufficient opportunity to
e n j oy the excitement of a contest which can, but not
n e c e s s a ri l y, i nvo l ve physical strength and bodily
s k i l l s , is in danger of making their lives overly dull,”
wrote the German sociologist Norbert Elias. “ S u c h
a society will not provide the appropri ate sat i s f y i n g
c o m p e n s ation for the humdrum tensions generat e d
by normal daily life.” n

Being in a football stadium means you can
sing, shout, jeer, swear and leap around—
working off feelings you repress elsewhere.
Even better, you’re in a crowd
‘Such a society will not provide
the appropriate satisfying
compensation for the humdrum
tensions generated by normal
daily life’
