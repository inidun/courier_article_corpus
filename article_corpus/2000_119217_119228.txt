B a n g l a d e s h:
girls firs t

F rom modest beginnings, an NGO attracts over one million children from poverty-stricke n
b a c k g rounds into the classroom and gets them to stay there
Outside a one-room school in a village 40 kilo-
metres from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital,
a mother balks at the idea of marrying her 14-
year-old daughter Mukta if a proposal comes along,
e ven more at sending her to work in a fa c t o ry to
supplement the family income.“I’ll never do such a
t h i n g . I want my children to get an education firs t ,”
she assert s. “ E d u c ation will help them get a good
job later and become established in life.You can rob
a person of all their goods, but not of an educat i o n .”
I n s i d e , Mukta is one of twenty girls and five boy s
sitting on mats arranged in a “ U ” shape on the ear-
then flo o r. L e a rn e rs each have their own textbooks,
n o t e b o o k s , pencils and slat e s. D r aw i n g s , poems and
r hy m e s , a map of Bangladesh, a calendar and a
blackboard brighten up the bamboo walls of this
modest classroom run by the Bangladesh Rural
A d vancement Committee (BRAC ) . Fo rmed in 1972
to help thousands of refugees returning from the
previous ye a r ’s wa r ,1 this NGO has become one of
the most influential in the country for its work in
rural development,health  and education.
Were it not for BRAC , it is more than likely that
the children in this classroom—the sons and daugh-
t e rs of ri c k s h aw pullers , small traders or fa c t o ry wo r-
k e rs — would never learn to read and write in a coun-
t ry where almost half the population lives below the
p ove rty line. Despite progress in expanding pri m a ry
e d u c ation over the past decades, the poorest of the
poor are still likely not to make it to school or to
drop out in the early stages. B R AC launched its edu-
cation programme in 1985 after a question from a
mother enrolled in one of its adult literacy classes:
“But what about our children? Will they have to wa i t
until they are 18 to join your school?”
From modest beginnings with 22 experi m e n t a l
s c h o o l s ,B R AC ’s education programme now counts
34,500 schools cat e ring to 1.2 million students, o f
whom 70 per cent are gi r l s.Additional progr a m m e s
for children between 11 and 14 and for those living in
urban slums have also been launched in the past deca-
d e , and community-based libraries have been set up
across the country. B e t ween 1985 and 1999,a total of
1.5 million students gr a d u ated from BRAC schools.
The model is being replicated in several East and South
A f rican countries and is inspiring in-depth pri m a ry
e d u c ation reforms in South Asia and Central A m e-
ri c a .
The visitor to BRAC schools in villages on the
o u t s k i rts of Dhaka is immediately struck by the high
attendance rate and percentage of girls in the class-
r o o m . One major asset of BRAC schools is that they
are always located close to students’ h o m e s , d i s-
tance being one of the chief impediments to gi r l s ’
schooling in developing countri e s. Another plus is
class size: there are never more than 33 students per
c l a s s , compared with an average 73 in gove rn m e n t
s c h o o l s. In some cases, schools run morning and
a f t e rnoon shifts, with classes held three hours daily,
six days a we e k .These are agreed upon with parents
and can be changed during harvest time if neces-
s a ry. House ow n e rs often volunteer to rent out a
room to BRAC at minimal cost.
A confidence booster
Parents are met in groups by BRAC staff seve r a l
times before a school is opened and are required to
pledge to send their children to school each day and
to attend monthly parents’ m e e t i n g s.Three parents
(often mothers) also sit on the school management
committee alongside the community leader and tea-
c h e r.And when children don’t show up at school for a
few day s , the teacher or supervisor goes to check on
t h e m .The curriculum essentially cove rs the same
ground as in formal schools but is presented through
s i m p l i fied learning mat e rials that are relevant to the
life and environment of the children. According to 
Dr A riful Islam, c o o r d i n ator of the education pro-
gr a m m e ,“the school hours ,l o c at i o n , teacher and cur-
ricular activities like singi n g, dancing and draw i n g
capture the students’ interest and boost their confi-
d e n c e .Te a c h e rs and superv i s o rs monitor the progr e s s
of each individual learner with care.”
Te a c h e rs , the single most decisive influence on
the quality of schooling, are what BRAC calls “ p a r a-
p r o f e s s i o n a l s ” .N i n e t y - s e ven per cent of them are
women—a key factor in attracting girl pupils.T h e y
generally have nine ye a rs of educat i o n , making them
less qualified than their counterp a rts in gove rn-
ment schools who are required to have finished
s e c o n d a ry school. Most are married and live in the
village where the school is locat e d . Although their
wages are below those in gove rnment schools, t h e i r

of East Pakistan and West Pa k i s t a n , which were separated 
g e o gr a p h i c a l l y. In 1971 East Pakistan broke away, and achie-
ved independence as the Pe o p l e ’s Republic of Bangladesh after
a civil war which lasted from March to December.

s t atus as teachers carries intangible benefit s , such as reco-
gnition within the community.The recruitment procedure
is straightforward and the accent thereafter is put on bu i l-
ding skills and keeping motivation high: after being hired,
t e a c h e rs go on to take a two - week BRAC training cours e
t h at is complemented by refresher training one day a
m o n t h .
The results? BRAC schools boast a much lower dro-
pout rate than gove rnment pri m a ry schools 
(8 per cent compared with 32 per cent). Almost 
90 per cent of the students who gr a d u ate from them go on
to the formal schools, passing admission tests with little
d i f ficulty and proving that non-formal learning is not syno-
nymous with lower quality. Cost per student is a yearly $20,
compared with an estimated $52 in gove rnment schools.
S i g n i fic a n t l y, t e a c h e rs ’s a l a ries account for less than 40 per
cent of costs (close to 90 per cent in gove rnment schools),
l e aving more funds available for student books and sup-
p l i e s ,c u rriculum deve l o p m e n t , teacher training, m a n a g e-
ment and support at the local level.
O ver the ye a rs , B R AC has won the confidence of
p a r e n t s ,m a ny of whom now claim in chorus that “ t h e s e
schools are better run than gove rnment ones, t e a c h e rs come
on time and students learn in one week what those in
g ove rnment schools do in a month.” According to UNI-
C E F ’s Manzoor A h m e d ,“ B R AC ’s non-formal pri m a ry
e d u c ation programme has the same elements as all other
traditional or non-traditional educational progr a m m e s , bu t
it is the character and composition of these elements that
make it distinctive and are the key to its success.” He under-
lines that BRAC “has exploded several widely held myths
about pri m a ry educat i o n :t h at poor and illiterate rural fa m i-
lies are not concerned about their children’s educat i o n ,
t h at parents in traditional communities do not support
e d u c ation of girls and wo m e n ,t h at only teachers with for-
mal credentials and qualific ations and expensively bu i l t
school buildings provide the setting for quality pri-
m a ry educat i o n ; t h at NGOs can be relied on for
only small-scale pilot projects in pri m a ry educat i o n ;
and that serving hard-to-reach groups effective l y
makes schools more expensive.”
Although the gove rnment has acknowledged that
u n i ve rsal pri m a ry education can’t be achieved without
embracing non-formal avenues to learn i n g, it gi ve s
no support to BRAC ’s progr a m m e .C o s t - s h a ri n g
n e g o t i ations are underway, but so far the organiza-
tion remains highly dependent on a consortium of
b i l ateral and multilateral aid donors. B R AC ’s edu-
c ation budget for the 1999-2004 period totals $112
m i l l i o n , of which $109 million will be funded through
foreign donors. Since 1998, the organization has been
asking for a 5 takas (around US10 cents) monthly
c o n t ri bution eve ry month from each student, w i t h
an exception made for the most destitute families and
the second child enrolled.This income cove rs about
three per cent of total costs. B R AC ’s success howe-
ver has not left the gove rnment entirely indifferent.
It has turned over 67 poorly functioning communi-
ty schools to the organizat i o n , with the hope that
B R AC will get them running again. B R AC is also one
of several NGOs which has received gove rnment fun-
ding to run 225 schools cat e ring to children wo r k i n g
in fa c t o ries or as domestic serva n t s , an initiat i ve that
is not part of BRAC ’s own non-formal pri m a ry edu-
c ation progr a m m e .
Although it has no plans to open new schools,
B R AC is stretching its education programme to the
full five - year pri m a ry cycle (instead of the present
three)—to give the underprivileged an extra chan-
ce of getting an education. ■
