SOPHIE
and
BRUNO
in the
land of
the Atom
On the following pages, the "Unesco
Courier" is pleased to publish a
condensation from a comic book,
"Sophie and Bruno in the Land of
the Atom", published several years
ago by the French Commissariat of
Atomic Energy, in Paris, and illustrat¬
ed by Jacques Castan (1).
In simple everyday terms and
amusing drawings the book tells of
a visit to a nuclear power station by
Sophie and Bruno, and their initia¬
tion into the world within the atom
and of some of the peaceful uses
of atomic energy. We are sure our
young and older readers alike will
take pleasure in joining the two
youngsters on their journey.
(1) "Sophie and Bruno in the Land of
the Atom" was not produced for public sale,
and is now out of print. The book was
originally published in colour.

HERE'S AN ATOM AS WE CAN IMAGINE IT LOOKS. |
THERE IS AN INFINITELY TINY NUCLEUS MADE
UP OP PROTONS AND NEUTRONS. EVEN TINIER
ELECTRONS WHIRL AROUND THIS NUCLEUS LIKE
PLANETS AROUND THE SUN, THE SPACE BETWEEN
THE ELECTRONS AND THE NU¬
CLEUS MAY SEEM INSIGNIFICANTLY
SMALL TO US BUT ON THE ATOMIC
SCALE IT IS FANTASTICALLY LARGE,
THE ATOM'S DIAMETER BEING ABOUT
20,000 TIMES GREATER THAN THE
NUCLEUS . THE INSIDE
OF THE ATOM, THEN, IS
MOSTLY EMPTY SPACE !
zr
THE LIGHTEST ATOM IS THE HYDROGEN ATOM . IT IS
COMPOSEO OF JUST ONE PROTON AND ONE ELECTRON .
HERE IT IS ON THE LEFT. ONE OF THE HEAVIEST
ATOMS IS THE URANIUM ATOM WITH A NUCLEUS OF
92 PROTONS AND 143 NEUTRONS. 92 ELECTRONS MOVE
ROUND THE NUCLEUS-AS MANY ELECTRONS AS PROTONS...

IN AN ATOMIC REACTOR URANIUM IS PRESENT IN LARGE QUANTITIES. WHEN A URANIUM
ATOM EMITS NEUTRONS, THE NEUTRONS COLLIDE WITH OTHER URANIUM ATOMS AND
SPLIT THEM APART, RELEASING VAST SOURCES OF ENERGY. OTHER NEUTRONS DO
SAME STARTING
THAT'S HOW THE
ATOM BOMB WORKS1.

THAT CHIMNEY WITHOUT SMOKE

TO GET RID OF THE AIR THAT
COOLS THE REACTOR CORE

THE AIR HEATS 'UP
AS IT PASSES IN
THE REACT0R,ANDIS
CHANNELLED TO A RE¬
CUPERATOR WHERE
THE HEAT IS TRANS¬

WATER IS VAPOUR-

WHAT IS IT?

IT'S A PHOTOGRAPHIC
FILM. RADIATION
TURNS IT BLACK.
WHEN DEVELOPED, THE
FILM SHOWS HOW MUCH
RADIATION THE BEARER
HAS RECEIVED.
... HERE WE ARE BEFORE ONE OF
OUR REACTORS OR PILES.
THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES IT
COVERS A SURFACE OF
2,000 Sq. METRES AND IS
34 METRES HIGH .
THE CONCRETE SHIELD SURROUND
INO THE BLOCK PROTECTS US
FROM THE RADIATIONS, AND IS
20 METRES HIGH. THE ROUND
HOLES yOU SEE (1,337 IN ALL)
ARE TUBES GOING THROUGH
THE REACTOR. EACH TUBE CON¬
TAINS 2 URANIUM RODS 3.80
METRES LONG IN AN INSULATED
MAGNESIUM CASINO .THE TUBES
RUN THROUGH A GRAPHITE STACK
THE REACTOR CONTAINS 1,400
TONS OF GRAPHITE AND 100 TONS
OF URANIUM-..
NOTE THAT THE STAFF WEAR NO
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
TO CO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS .
LATER, IF THE
NEEDLE HAS MOVED
IT'LL MEAN YOU'VE
RECEIVED A DOSE
OF RADIATION !

BUT THE NEUTRONS ARE
EMITTED AT VERY HIGH
VELOCITY. AS ATOMS ARE
INFINITELY TINY,
THERE IS VERY LITTLE
CHANCE OF A NEUTRON
HITTING AN ATOM AND
SPLITTING IT.

WE CAN INCREASE THE
CHANCES IF WE TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE NA¬
TURAL ATTRACTION OF
ATOMS. YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT THE EARTH'S
GRAVITATION AT¬
TRACTION OR THATOF
THE MOON AND OTHER
PLANETS,!
NO! IT CAN'T !
THE INSIDE OF A

IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG-
SAY A MAGNESIUM CASING

THIS IS A REACTOR'S BRAIN
IT MEASURES THE TEMPERA

THE 4 CONTROL RODS AND THE

WELL , WHAT DID TH E p
TWO OF YOU THINK
OF THE PLACE?
60Y, I WAS GLAD THAT
GEIGER NEEDLE
DIDN'T BUDGE!
GOSH.THE CENTRES
BIG! BUT WHAT'S
IT USED FOR?
hee! HEE ¡WHAT A
LAUGH! ALL THAT
JUST TO MAKE
ELECTRICITY !
NOT BAD, NOT BAD
SOPHIE !
BUT SOPHIE'S OVERLOOKED ONE
THING. WATER'S GETTING SCAR¬
CER EVERYDAY. ANOTHER
THING, THE WORLD NOW NEEDS
SO MUCH ELECTRIC POWER THAT
SOON OUR WATER, OIL AND COAL
RESOURCES WILL BE EXHAUSTED.
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE
WORLD'S USED UP
MORE POWER IN
THE LAST 50
YEARS THAN |N
ALL ITS HISTORY !
PULL-TONY-IN??
WHAT'S THAT?

YOU ABOUTATOMIC REACTORS

ALMOST THE SAME '.

URANIUM DIS¬
INTEGRATES AND FEEDS

A THIRD PART OF
the uranium has
changed into . . .
plutonium!
FISSION PRODUCTS CLOG THE PIPE ...OOPS ! !
I MEAN. ..THE REACTOR ! ! JUSTAS SOOT AND
ASHES CLOG .^-»i UP A COAL STOVE ...
BUT PLUTONIUM IS DIFFERENT
YOU SEE, IT CAN BE USED AS A
FUEL BY ITSELF .
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE! SCIENTISTS ARE
PERFECTING NEW REACTORS
THAT WILI	
TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT GOES ON IN A REACTOR ,
LIT A FIRE OF TWIGS .
BUT OF COURSE THERE'S NO
FIRE AND NO ASHES IN A
REACTOR. EVERYTHING IS ON
THE ATOMIC SCALE.
THE URANIUM RODS IN THEIR
CASINGS SEEM TO BE
UNCHANGED, BUT IF YOU
EXAMINE THEM CAREFULLY
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE
THAT THEY HAVE UNDERGONE
DEFINITE TRANSFORMATION ...
... THE RODS NO LONGER CONTAIN
ONLY URANIUM. PLUTONIUM ANDOTHER
FISSION PRODUCTS ARE ALSO PRESENT .
PLUTONIUM IS PRECIOUS AND HAS
TO BE SEPARATED FROM THESE OTHER
PRODUCTS. THIS IS DONE IN THE
LARGE FACTORY YOU SEE OVER THER
