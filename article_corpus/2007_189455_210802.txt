in regard to the preparation of Ten-
tative Lists which are required for 
nomination to the World Heritage 
list. There was also considerable 
evidence of stronger links between 
Pacific Island delegates and tech-
nical experts who work in the Pa-
cific.
What role should communities 
play in the protection  
of heritage? 
Communities are integral to the 
protection of heritage, both tan-
gible and intangible. In the Pacific, 
this is particularly important given 
the intangible values, the unique 
Pacific culture and the fact that 
most land and resources are under 
customary ownership and control. 
During our workshop, last Febru-
ary, it was agreed to add what is 
known as the ‘fifth C’ to the stra-
tegic objectives identified in the 
Pacific 2009 Action Plan. This ‘C’ 
is for community. Without commu-
nity involvement and commitment 
heritage protection may not suc-
ceed. As well, it is believed that 
heritage protection should bring 
together the needs of communities 
because people need to be at the 
heart of conservation. 
In practice this means that rel-
evant communities are actively 
involved in the identification, man-
agement and conservation of all 
World Heritage sites. 
What is your main objective 
as Chairperson of the World 
Heritage Committee? 
As Chair of the World Heritage 
Committee I want to promote 
the protection of the world’s 
natural and cultural heritage 
(both tangible and intangible). 
In particular those parts of the 
world where there is under- 
representation on the List of ar-
eas needing protection. 
The Pacific has one of the highest 
proportions of indigenous peoples

Does the distinction 
between tangible and 
intangibleheritage apply 
to the Pacific cultures? 
Tangible and intangible heritage 
are often indivisible within the Pa-
cific where the land is usually in 
customary ownership. An example 
is East Rennell which is a unique 
World Heritage site in that it is un-
der customary ownership and man-
agement. 
In Pacific cultures, indigenity is 
not separate from heritage. Heri-
tage defines cultural identity and 
cannot be separated from social, 
economic and environmental well-
being. It can be viewed in a holistic 
way, that is to say that indigenity 
embraces all life that is both tan-
gible and intangible, and is under-
stood through cultural traditions. 
You just launched the World 
Heritage - Pacific 2009 
program. What does it entail? 
The Pacific 2009 Action Plan 
was developed at a World Heri-
tage workshop held at Tongariro in 
2004. It established the strategic 
objectives and priorities for Pacific 
Island nations and was structured 
around the four ‘C’s as outlined by 
the World Heritage Committee, 
namely: Credibility, Conservation, 
Capacity-Building and Communi-
cation. It also identified the need 
that necessary funds and resourc-
es be identified and made avail-
able through partnership efforts 
and related national implementa-
tion plans. 
During the Pacific Island World 
Heritage workshop, held at Ton-
gariro, in February 2007, it was 
most encouraging to note the sig-
nificant progress made in the Pa-
cific since the development of the 
Action Plan. This illustrates that 
important work is being done in 
Pacific Island countries especially

within national populations and

the world. It is under-represented 
in the World Heritage system and 
this role provides an opportunity 
to profile, promote and showcase 
the unique diversity of the natural

cific to the world. 
At the Christchurch meeting 
(Editor’s note: 31st session of 
the World Heritage Committee 
which was held in New Zealand, 
from 23 June to 2 July 2007) an 
appeal to establish a Pacific fund 
to which the international commu-
nity will contribute financially was 
launched. Among many things, this 
will help advance the implementa-
tion of the World Heritage Con-
vention in the Pacific. n
