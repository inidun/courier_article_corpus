The earliest work on these Buddhist
rock temples dates from the fourth
century A. D. The caves are located
on the edge of the Taklamakan
(Gobi) Desert in Gansu province, on
the Silk Route, and were the site of
intensive activity until the fourteenth
century. The most important
structures, including a 33-metre-
high Buddhist temple, date from the
Tang dynasty (seventh century).
Adorned with frescoes and
sculptures by artists of a variety of
origins, the caves are a record of ten
centuries of central Asian history.

1 Conquered around 1550 B. C., Nubia
(especially the area around Aswan)
became a strategic strongpoint of
Pharaonic Egypt. The open-air
museum of Nubia and Aswan
comprises the temples of Abu
Simbel, hewn from the rock by
order of Ramses II in the fourteenth
century B. C., the great temple of Isis
and a complex of several temples
built between the fifteenth century
B. C. and the second century A. D.
Placed on the World Heritage List
in 1979
Situated on the banks of the
Russenski Lorn River, the monastery
complex of Ivanovo consists of
churches, chapels and cells which
were hewn from the rock between
the restoration of the independence
of the Bulgarian church in q35 and
the annexation of Bulgaria by the
Ottoman empire in 1396. Frescoes,
which originally covered the walls of
almost all the churches and chapels,
illustrate the development of the
school of Tarnovo (capital of the
second Bulgarian kingdom) and,
more generally, of Bulgarian and
Byzantine art.

2. A natural cave modified by human hand.
3. Figures are portrayed in the Ivanovo frescoes with a sense of drama that
relates them more closely to Hellenistic than to Byzantine art.
4. After centuries of damage, the frescoes of Ivanovo now offer only a few
tantalizing glimpses of medieval Bulgarian art.

N Ajanta N Hewn from a cliff
overlooking a bend in the Waghora
River (Maharashtra State), the thirty
Ajanta caves include five Buddhist
sanctuaries and monastic annexes.
The first group of caves were made
in the second century B. C. on a
basilical pattern in which the main
nave is separated from the aisles. A
second group was hewn out
between the fifth and seventh
centuries A. D., during the Vakataka
and Gupta dynasties. Abundant
statues and wall paintings mark one
of the highest points of Indian art.
Placed on the World Heritage List
in 1983
N E)) ora N Unlike Ajanta, Ellora is
the product of three great religions
of ancient India. Thirty-four caves
hewn from a high basalt cliff on a
two-kilometre-long site in
Maharashtra state contain Buddhist,
Brahmanic andjalmst temples and
monasteries. The oldest date from
the seventh century and the most
recent were probably made between
800 and 1000 A. D.
Placed on the World Heritage List
in 1983
N Elephant. The Elephanta
Caves, on the little island of
Gharapuri, offshore from Bombay,
are divided into two groups. The
main site contains five Hindu rock-
hewn sanctuaries which embody
many features of traditional
architecture. The sculptures in the
main cave which surround the chapel
containing the lingam (phallic symbol
representing the fertilizing aspect of
Shiva) are among the most important
of their kind dedicated to the cult of
Shiva. They have been approximately
dated to some time between the sixth
and eighth centuries A. D.

The Bandiagara Escarpment ('Dogon Country') (Mali)
: :
1. A Dogon village built
on rock. Alongside the
rectangular houses
are grain stores with
conical thatched
roofs.
2. A natural cave once
modified for human
habitation.
3. The entrance to a
religious leader's
dwelling, protected by
a carved snake.
4. The houses are
built of dry stone or
unbaked clay bricks.
The walls are coated
with clay.
5. Traditional houses
clinging to the cliff
face.
Covering an area of some 400, 000
hectares, this site includes almost 250
traditional villages of the Dogon
people, most of which huddle against
the cliff. The Dogon, a people
formed about 800 years ago from the
intermingling of tribes which had
been chased from Mande with the
local Tellem people who lived in
caves and rock shelters, preserved a
number of their predecessors'rock
sanctuaries. They later developed a
form of social organization which
was reflected In their architecture.

As early as the fourth century A. D.
Christian anchorite communities
took shelter in the unusual conical
peaks sculpted by erosion in the
heart of Turkey's Anatolia region.
They began creating troglodytic
villages to protect themselves fro m
Arab invasions, and by the middle of
the ninth century stone churches
were being gouged from the soft
rock and richly decorated with
fi gurative painting.

The traditional habitat of the Anasazi
Indians appeared in the sixth century
A. D. in the form of partially buried
villages on the high table-land of
Mesa Verde (Colorado). From the
eighth century on it developed in the
form of villages that were partly
troglodytic and partly built above
ground. Buried structures known as
kivas were made and were used for
various cultural activities. The
civilization of the Anasazis, to which
the Pueblo Indians belong, reached
its zenith between the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. At the end of
this period the surface villages were
abandoned and the Indians settled in
more rudimentary defensive
buildings huddled against the sides of
the canyons.

Underground mining of rock salt
deposits began in the thirteenth
century, and in the course of time
galleries were opened up on nine
levels, to a maximum depth of 327
metres. Their total length, including
wells, corridors, labyrinths,
excavations and rooms is nearly
300 km. The old galleries strikingly
illustrate the evolution of mining
processes over the centuries.
Underground chapels are adorned
with altars, pulpits and statues carved
outofsatt.
