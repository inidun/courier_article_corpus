A S this issue of the Courier
went to press a special ses-
sion of Unesco's Executive
Board began an overall review of
Unesco's 1951 programme, prepared
by the Board at its session in Feb-
ruary for presentation to the
General Conference in Florence,
next month.
This programme follows a new
pattern, outlined by the Unesco
General Conference in Paris last
Autumn. A"basic programme"
defines the main lines of Unesco's
work for several years ; a state-
ment of methods describes the
means Unesco can use to imple-
ment its programme and a series
or resolutions defines in detail the
activities to be undertaken in 1951.
The extension of sections of the
programme to Germany and Japan
in 1951 is also outlined.
The 1951 programme was desi-
gned by the Board to be carried out
on a budget of $ 8, 000, 000-the
same figure as for 1950. Although
the Board approved the programme
for submission to the Florence
Conference at its February meeting,
it also decided to hold a special
session in March to make any final
adjustments. (A report of this
meeting will be given in the next
issue of the Courier).
During its earlier meeting, the
Board also completed arrangements
for the Florence Conference. It
decided to extend invitations to the
Conference to observers of the
occupying authorities in the Eas-
tern and Western Zones of Germa-
ny, accompanied, if they wish, by
experts of Germany nationality.
It also approved a credit of
$ 40, 000 to allow Unesco to main-
tain until the end of 1950, its
assistance to refugee children in
the Middle East. Other programme
activities discussed by the Board
included the sending of a mission
of experts to Ecuador to advise on
fundamental education experi-
ments in the areas recently devas-
t√£ted by an earthquake. Finally
it decided to recommend to the
General Conference the admission
to Unesco of three countries, the
United States of Indonesia, the
Republic of Korea and the Hashe-
mite Kingdom of the Jordan which
recently applied to join the orga-
nization...
