T first international labora-tory of the U ited Nations will
open in Italy this year.
Behind this news is a heartening
story of co-operation among coun-
tries of Europe, Asia, Africa and
South America who have pooled
their resources to make available
to all what none of them could
manage by itself. That first labo-
ratory is an International Compu-
tation Centre which will be
established in Rome to house the
enormous, intricate machines that
have become necessary in this
complicated world of today.
The convention providing for the
computation centre was drafted at
an international conference in
Paris last December. Eight coun-
tries have already signed this
convention : Belgium, Egypt, Iraq,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico and
Turkey.
The International Computation
Centre is the first of a series of
United Nations laboratories which
have been considered by scientists
from many countries since 1946.
Despite the international cha-
racter of science, there is still no
methodic organization of scientific
research on an international basis.
In the past century, it is true, a few
international scientific institutions
have been created, such as the
International Bureau of Weights
and Measures, and the Interna-
tional Time Bureau. The work of
these institutions, however, re-
mains rather limited in scope.
There are many fields of science
in which research work can only be
organized efficiently and rationally
on an international basis. This is
particularly true where research
requires complex and costly instal-
lations and highly specialized staff,
which are beyond the means of all
but the most wealthy countries.
Such is the case with modern cal-
culating machines whose work can
be of service to all branches of
science.
Again, where subjects of study
and research can only be dealt with
as a unified whole and outside the
framework of any given State, as,
for example, in the cases of
meteorology, oceanography and
astronomy, effective concentration
on an international level is essen-
tial.
Such concentration is also vital
when the importance of a problem,
or mankind's urgent need for its
solution, call for energetic and
effective action. This especially
applies to public health problems
whose solution, in the case of cer-
tain diseases, would save millions
of lives and relieve untold mental
and physical suffering.
It was for such reasons as these
and because of its interest in"the
furthering of the development, in
all sciences of research and dis-
covery which are the essential
source and stimulus of all economic
and social progress,"that the Uni-
ted Nations Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC), decided during
1946-1947 to investigate the possi-
3. The amount of resources avail-
able for proceeding with the pro-
ject (funds, staff, etc.).
4. The probable cost of the
project and the risk of its dupli-
cating the work of already-existing
research centres.
With the aid of these criteria, the
Committee recommended first
priority for three projects : Inter-
national Computation Centre,
International Institute of Research
on the Brain, International Insti-
tute of Social Sciences. It recom-
mended for second priority four
more, all of which, in its opinion,
had equal claims : International
Laboratory for Arid Zone Research,
International Astronomical Labo-

bility of establishing United Nations
Research Laboratories.
Following consultations with the
United Nations Specialized Agen-
cies, the International Council of
Scientific Unions and individual
scientists and scientific bodies in
many countries, ECOSOC decided
to form, in co-operation with
Unesco, a committee of experts to
examine and report on the ques-
tion.
This Committee, after considering
proposals that had been made for
the establishment of specific labo-
ratories, decided to establish the
four following categories of criteria
for the selection of priority pro-
jects :
1. The importance of the project
to humanity from (a) the practical
and (b) the scientific viewpoint ;
the appeal which the project would
be likely to have for the public and
for Governments ; whether results
could be expected within a reason-
able period of time.
2. The appropriateness of the
project for research on the interna-
tional level.
ratory, International Institute for
the Chemistry of Living Matter,
International Meteorological Insti-
tute.
The Economic and Social Council
considered that the project for an
International Computation Centre
deserved special consideration and
invited Unesco to prepare and
submit a detailed plan for its
creation, including recommenda-
tions as to its location, staffing,
equipping and financing.
The approval of plans for the
establishment of the Computation
Centre by the Sixth Session of
Unesco's General Conference in
July last year and by ECOSOC the
month after, enabled the Organi-
zation to call a Conference of
interested States at which the
Convention for the creation of the
Centre was signed by the repre-
sentatives of eight nations in
December.
The Conference accepted the
Italian Government's offer to house
the project in the Italian National
Research Council Building, all of
whose library and documentation
facilities will be at its disposal.
The Government has also agreed to
make the Centre a $75, 000 free-of-
interest loan for ten years.
The Centre's Member States will
contribute to its annual budget
which is expected to amount to
about 1 ; ; 100, 000, and for the first
year Unesco will make it a $15, 000
grant and a loan of $60, 000.
The three main functions of the
Centre can be summed up as
research, education and service.
First, eminent scientists and a
research staff working in mechan-
ical computation, will be able to
perfect, under laboratory conditions,
new methods of computation.
Secondly, the Centre will initiate a
training scheme by giving scholar-
ships to young research workers ;
mechanical computation is a fairly
new science, and all countries wish
to have more experts. Thirdly,
scientists, scientific institutions and
industrial firms in ratifying States
will be able to ask the Centre staff
to work out intricate calculations
needed to solve scientific and
technical problems.
The administration of the Centre
will be shared in by all those
countries wishing to participate,
through a Council on which their
representatives will serve.
While enjoying the moral and
financial support both of the United
Nations and Unesco, it will be a
self-governing institution dep-
endent only upon the States
adhering to its Convention.
The first international laboratory
should do much to meet the needs
of many countries in various fields
of science and technology. It is, in
the words of M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco.
"an achievement beyond the means
of any single nation, but not beyond
the resources of several nations
acting together-where enormous.
intricate machines will calculate, at
inconceivable speed, the measure-
ments of a dam, the proportions of
a nuclear energy station, or the
connexion between various kinds of
population statistics, and where
research workers will painstakingly
evolve other even cleverer and
quicker machines, to be the faithful
helpers of all who work for the
common welfare of mankind."
