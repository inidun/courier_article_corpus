ccording to the United
i Nations Industrial Develop¬
ment Organization (UNIDO),
world économie output is
expactad to double between now
and 2010. In developing countries
it is anticipated to nearly triple.
It is vital, therefore, to idantify
manufacturing technologies that
produca a minimum of waste and
encourage their widespread usa
internationally, as well as pre-
venting pollution at its source. As
wasta storage and treatment
become more and more costly,
"zéro waste" manufacturing is in
everybody's interest.
It was against this background
that the United Nations Univer¬
sity (UNU, see box page 44)
launched a long-term research
programme known as the Zéro
Emission Research Initiative
(ZERI). The aim of the pro¬
gramme, which is the brainchild
of Gunter Pauli, an advisor to tha
UNU's Rector, is to achieve tech-
nological braakthroughs that will
facilitate manufacturing without
any form of wasta.
RESEARCH
INTO ECOTECHNOLOGY
The ZERI programme is based on
the principle that tha idéal indus¬
trial System is one where total
input equals total output, i.e. tha
raw materials usad in the manu¬
facturing process are fully usad.
Tha programma has a four-step
approach. Firstly, it is compiling
lists of the types of waste prod-
ucts that can be returned to
industry for usa as raw materials.
Secondly, it is suggasting that car-
tain industries should co-operata
in "clusters", with wasta from one
industry being usad as raw mate¬
rials by othar members of tha
cluster. Thirdly, it is encouraging
the search for technological
braakthroughs that would
improve tha cost-affactivanass of
this kind of raorganization.
Lastly, the programme calls for

government backing which is nec¬
essary if its aims are to be real¬
ized on a large scale.
A number of companies agread
to take part in tha programme,
and five core projects were
selected for research into indus¬
trial clustering. The industries
concerned ware fish farming and
the brewing of bear and soya
sauce; sugar; forastry; the paper
and pulp industries; and plastics,
cament and construction mate¬
rials manufacturing. Two other
projects ara encouraging research
into "technologies from nature"
the non-wasta production of
colour pigments and waxes.
VERTICAL
CONCENTRATION
The brewing of béer and soya
sauce créâtes a number of envi¬
ronmental headachas. It produces
large amounts of solid waste that
is often simply dumped because
it is not financially worthwhila to
convert it to animal food even
though it has a high protein con¬
tent. ZERI suggests that thèse
two industries join forces with
fish farming. This calls for exten¬
sive rasaarch into the affluents
and solid wastas produced by
brewaries and the best way of
feeding them diractly to fish, the
fish varietias best suited to
absorb waste from brawerias, and
algae which could absorb waste
from fish ponds and, thanks to
sunlight and oxygen, convert it
back into feedstuff for the fish.
Another problem facad by tha
bear and soya sauce industries is
that of claaning returned bottles
and bottling machines. Harsh
chamicals such as caustic soda
and starilizing agents are widaly
usad, and as a rasult cleaning has
to ba donc twice, onca with chem¬
icals and once with watar to rinsa
out tha chemicals. If sugar-based
cleaners such as APG (alkyl
polyglucose currently used in cos-
metics and pharmaceuticals) wara
used, wasta watar could ba
directly channaled to fish-farming
ponds. As the ZERI programme
sacs it, vertical concentration of
thesa industries would bring
mutual benefit and would be an
idéal solution for recycling wasta.
Another example, albeit on a
smallar scale, concerns racycling
branchas and foliaga from felled
traas. Tha leaves of some tree
species can be used to produce

parfuma, essential oils, colour
pigments, and stabilizers (prasar-
vativas) used in food processing.
Unlike the synthetic products
that are currantly usad, ail thesa
natural products ara biodégrad¬
able. The distillation process
used to obtain them is often
highly enargy-intensiva, but small
wood débris could be used in
mobile distillation units that
would operata at the falling site.
At tha end of tha opération
rasiduas from distilling could be
used as a soil enrichar. In this way
tha trees would be fully usad,
and highly skilled jobs would be
created for foresters.
TECHNOLOGICAL
BREAKTHROUGHS
Everyone is in favour of racycling
paper, but not everyone knows that
it is an axpansive opération and ona
that causes pollution. De-inking is
inafficient (only 65 to 80 par cent
of ink is effectivaly removed). A lot
of water is needed and highly pol-
luting toxic sludge is produced. In
short, racycled paper is more
expansive to produce than new
paper. It will be necessary to
davalop da-inking technologies
using enzymatic, microbiological,
biochamical or magnetic mathods,
and produce a naw ink that will ba
casier to datach from paper. The

resulting waste sludge and short
fibres could ba used in tha
building industry as a substitute
for asbestos or for making sound-
proof panels and corrugated card-
board.
Meanwhile, fly ash from incin-
erated municipal wasta and slack
from the iron and steel industry
could be converted into high-
value-added raw materials for the
construction business, as is
alraady being donc with coal
dust. Limastone and gypsum ara
used in tha cament industry and
could partly be produced from
thèse wastes. To ba completely
efficient, however, the siza of the
cernant factory must correspond
to the size of tha town and tha
volume of wasta incinerated.
NOT STRICTLY
FOR THE BIRDS
Tha ZERI programme also
encourages rasaarch into tech¬
nologies based on procassas and
Systems that ara well known to
nature but not to humankind. To
date only tha pharmaceutical
industry has investigated thesa
possibilities.
Take the case of colours,
which are used in industries
ranging from textiles to cars and
from cosmatics to food. Industry
has devaloped some 4,500 colour
pigments, most of them based on
patrochamicals. In textiles, most
of the colour pigments ara wasted
in the watar and only a fraction
sticks to the fibres. In countries
whara there are strict environ-
mental protection laws, compa¬
nies are obliged to traat tha pol-
luted water at great expansé.
This partly explains why many
textile companies hava moved to
developing countries whara pro¬
duction costs are lower and envi¬
ronmental constraints not so
severe.
The painting process usad in
the automobile industry has
changed considerably ovar the
past twenty years, largely due to

the introduction of powder- and
water-based paints. Thèse newer
techniques do not produca the
sludge once made by car-paint
workshops, which is handlad as
spécial industrial waste and incin¬
erated with great care. However,
metallic paints remain a potential
health hazard.
To solve thèse problems the
UNU suggests studying birds.
The brilliant colours of the
feathers of several tropical birds
are not based on colour pigments
but on the refraction of light that
offers the variety of colours of the
rainbow. Research into tha
refraction of light in synthetic
fibres can build on optic fibre pro¬
duction technologies devaloped in
télécommunications, although a
lot of work still needs be donc
before this technology can ba
applied to automobiles.
Birds hâve another original gift
to offer us. They produce various
kinds of wax that are essential for
their survival. Oddly enough their
feathar wax is liquid and easy to
apply at -30° C, whereas it solidi¬
fies in the +40° Celsius beat of the
tropics. The ZERI study will con-
centrata on migrant birds such as
geese that fly at high altitudes
between the North Pôle and tha
Equator. Synthetic waxes that
protect the paint on cars, trains,
aircraft and satellites and reduce
their friction are both polluting to
produca and non-biodagradable.
Before applying this process in
industry, the molacular structure
of wild goose wax must be studied
in order to solve the mystery of
why it remains liquid at very low
températures and solidifies in
great haat.
