CHILDREN IN
WONDERLAND
by Andrea SALlE. R'
HAVE you ever heard a child's
excited voice echoing
through the halls of a
stately museum ? If you
haven't yet, you probably will one
of these days. For more school-
children are today visiting mu-
seums than ever before.
Grown-ups stilt seem to think
of museums as awe-inspiring
"shrines", or cold, dull mauso-
leums, with the result that many
adult persons are still frightened
to set foot inside one of them.
Children, however, react to
museums in a quite different
manner. To them the museum is
a land of wonder ; their eyes
wander all over the place, they
pick what they like, they walk
away, turn and come back. Some-
times it is only to touch a statue
that has caught their fancy ; other
times it is to draw an insect or a
piece of jewelry and really get to
know it. Even exhibits which
most adults would judge to be dull,
hold a fascination for young chil-
dren, and have life and a meaning
of their own.
Everywhere, museum curators are
gradually beginning to establish a
working partnership with the
school teacher. And although
only a short time ago such an idea
would have been a startling novelty
in many countries, museum di-
rectors now agree-many in fact
are loudly proclaiming-that
museums are meant for children
as much as for adults.
Today, in the United Kingdom,
in the Netherlands, in Sweden and
France, in Canada, Belgium, Switz-
erland, Poland and the U. S. S. R.,
museums are making a special
effort to get groups of schoolchil-
dren and young people to visit
their exhibits.
In the United States, such links
are already quite firmly estab-
lished, since schoolchildren there
regularly visit over 200 museums
of all types, quite apart from the 53
museums created specially for
children. The International
Council of Museums and Unesco,
incidentally, are encouraging and
co-ordinating many new depart-
ures in this field. Last year, for
example, Unesco organized an in-
ternational seminar at Brooklyn,
New York, whose object was to
speed the development in all coun-
tries of this type of co-operation.
From one discovery
to another
ADMITTEDLY, some schools seemto have an advantage over
others. Many a country
school-teacher must feel envious as
he reads reports of his colleagues
in the big towns, who have at their
very doors inexhaustible resources
for supplementing their classroom
teaching. Who but a teacher
working in a large city could, for
instance, write this account of how
his children improved their know-
ledge and skill as young potters ?
"The children in Grade 6 who
had been doing pottery work since
October had gone on from discos-
ery to discovery until they began
to feet dimly that they needed to
see iWhat others had done in the
same line. Up to that point, they
had learnt to use clay for them-
selves with no model before them.
I therefore suggested that we might
visit the Departments of Greek and
Egyptian ceramics in a museum to
study techniques... They split up
into twos and threes or went off
alone to stand before the show-
cases and start work... On the aver-
age, each child made about
castle. The big
tower isn't so
very old-only
the fourteenth
century. But
(Continued

twenty-five really good drawings
during the afternoon... The intel-
ligent appreciation they expressed
told me that they had grasped the
point straight away ; they could
"feel"the clay of works more than
a thousand years old taking shape
in their hand".
Many a rural school child, too,
must be envious of the city children
who at a science museum can learn
things which are always rather
hard to follow in textbooks. One
French girl of fourteen who studied
gravitation in this way wrote, when
she came back :"What a better
and clearer picture of the earth and
the heavens I got from my visit
to the museum... it has made me
want to learn more about mathe-
matics and science and helped me
see these subjects in a new light."
"Do you see that castle
over there ?"
AND yet there is no reason toponder regretfully over the
inevitable inequality between
town and country, between rich
and poor, or large and small
schools. Countless small schools
would spurn such sympathy. A
friend of mine who teaches in a
primary school in a small country
community certainly does not feel
deprived of resources."A mu-
seum ?" he says,"But I do have
one ! I've always had one. Don't
pity me because I cannot take my
pupils to a fine building full of
valuable collections. Just look
around you at this museum of
mine". And, with a sweep of his
arm he indicates the surrounding
countryside.
The average person would at
first see nothing but fields, a stream
fringed with poplars, a few roads
and two or three villages."Behind
that wood, over there", he says,
"we are digging clay, the
same red clay that potters have
been using for hundreds of years.
I have shards of Gallo-Roman pot-
tery at home that the children
found one day, and since then they
have been modelling the same clay
themselves. For art galleries we
have all the churches in the vici-
nity, a number of Renaissance
houses, not to mention an eight-
eenth-century mansion to which
my class pays a visit every year.
On the historical side, we have
plenty to study too, starting with
that castle over there."
The castle consists of two square
towers and the remains of walls
overlooking the valley. From the
main road you can see what looks
like an almost intact keep, arches
smothered in ivy and a sort of
apse built on the rock.
The conscientious sightseer leaves
his car and sets off up the hill,
through the vineyards, and up the
steep streets of the little town. We
can imagine the scene when he
arrives in the square and, standing
between the town-hall, the school
and the fountain, looks up at the
medieval battlements and turns to
question the first passer-by. Need-
less to say, he gets no useful infor-
mation. No one knows anything
except that"it's old", dating from
the"time of the feudal lords", and
that the children sometimes go and
play there with their teacher.
But when some children appear
on the scene, it is a very different
story. The visitor is immediately
surrounded by a band of eager
guies.-."Tf  know all about the

there was a fort here long be-
fore the castle was built and it may
even date back to prehistoric times
Therest of the castle was built in the
twelfth century, by a baron who
defended the country against pi-
rates. The land used to be part of
the Holy Roman Empire. And you
an see two beautifully carved
columns that are still standing."
They talk on and on proving that
their teacher has done a good job
with his"countryside museum."
My friend also talks of nature-
study rambles, explorations along
the stream, visits to local craftsmen
at work, or even of showing the
children something of modern in-
dustry a few miles away."I have
110 small-scale engine to show my
pupils, so 1 take them to the power
station."He says he uses in his
teaching"everything there is round
about, everything that is going on
in the district".
Sharpened observation
ONCE a teacher decides to appealto his pupils'powers of
observation rather than to
their verbal memory, to their curi-
osity rather than their obedience,
to their powers of thought and
judgment instead of to their
readiness to accept unquestioningly
what they are told, he cannot
be content to stay placidly in
the ciass-room. He feels com-
pelled to open the door and lead
the children out into the world,
where, after all,'the things he
teaches about mean something in
their own right. It is then clear
that it would be hard to keep teach-
ers and their pupils out of mu-
seums, whose real purpose is to
sharpen observation, to teach dis-
crimination and to satisfy curiosity,
without altogether exhausting it.
A young friend of mine who
visits the Metropolitan Museum in
New York regularly told me that
he was learning to open his eyes
and took. What he meant was that
he was becommg accustomed to
distinguishing and comparing. In
the Egyptian or Chinese Rooms he
has drawn up detailed lists, solved
minor archaeological problems,
made sketches and compiled tahu-
lar summaries,"just for the fun
of it", as he said. He was in fact
practising research. lIe was train-
ing himself in the art of seeing
things accurately, which is surely
of help to a man or woman ill
thinking accurately.
A little imagination
THE teacher from the-viHage-with-the-castle certainly
would have understood him.
For to this teacher, taking children
to a museum simply means"putting
them into touch with the true and
the beautiful". He admits, with a
shrug, that, if he lived in a ! arg {*
town he would probably be consi-
dered an extremist, for he would
be tempted to hold all his classes
in museums.
But he also adds that,"with a
little imagination"every school can
be the centre of an enormous,
living museum. In one place
there is a castle, in another a
mosque, in yet another a factory,
but in every place there are always
things that are true and beautiful,
to see, to touch and to understand.
He wilt'quote you Paul Va) ery's
words inscribed above the Palais
de ChaiIlot Museum in Paris :
"Friend, come not within these
walls where wonders are enshrined
unless desire bids you come".
"Children", he says,"are always
bidden by desire, and the world is
full of marvels ; all we have to do
is point to them."
