The mass media and society
AN AMERICAN
VIEWPOINT
by William G. Harley
COMMUNICATION in any so¬
ciety, together with the kinds
of systems through which it
will flow, will differ according not
only to that society's degree of natio¬
nal development but also according
to the entire range of its cultural,
social, economic, and political values
and traditions.
A major tradition of the Western
industrialized nations is the convic¬
tion that a free press is vital to demo¬
cratic government. Such protection is
accorded to the press because the
free flow of ideas and information
among individuals as well as States
is essential undergirding for the peo¬
ple's right to know and understand so
that they can govern themselves.
A free press (including electronic
journalism) serves three major func¬
tions in such a system of government.
First, it acts as a major information
source. It provides the raw material
from which free men and women form
opinions and make choices. The
media offer ever-present means for
every individual to keep abreast of
events at home and abroad, to be
aware of what is going on about him
and what may be expected, and to
select from a wide range of compet¬
ing opinions on matters of common
concern.
The media also arouse public inte¬
rest and increase public understand¬
ing by explaining complex issues in
such a way, as the BBC's Charles
Curran once put it, "as to reduce the
extent of incomprehension of the
basic facts of our society." The
media's information function is there-
WILLIAM G. HARLEY, President Emeritus
of the National Association of Educational
Broadcasters In the U.S.A., is a former Vice-
Chairman of the U.S. National Commission
for Unesco. He served as Senior Adviser to
the U.S. delegation at the 18th and 19th
sessions of Unesco's General Conference.
fore an essential element in a demo¬
cratic political process. This function
includes the dissemination not only of
ideas that have broad acceptance but
of minority views as well.
Such ; views have often through
time and discussion become those of
the majority; in any case, the right
of individuals or groups to dissent
from the ideas held at any particular
moment by the majority must be
protected and preserved.
Second, an unshackled press serves
as a monitor, observing and reporting
on the activities of government as
ombudsman for its citizens.
Operations of government are too
complex for individual citizens to
follow closely. A free and inde¬
pendent press serves this function
for them by constant scrutiny of how
authority is exercised, thus serving as
a vital check upon government and
against the abuse of powers by any
one group over any other group.
Thus, a free press is a safeguard of
all other freedoms.
Third, the press serves as liaison
between a State and its citizens.
It serves the latter as a sounding
board, permitting them openly to
voice criticism and complaints as
well as suggestions. Government
cannot function without constant two-
way communication with its citizens.
Not only do the media provide
channels for a constant flow of infor¬
mation to the people about the
services and plans of government,
but also through a variety of feedback
devices, they allow government to be
continually informed of the people's
opinion of its performance. A fully
informed public is the only reliable
basis for ensuring that a government
of any country is responsive to the
public will.
An important role played by the
electronic media in the political pro¬
cess consists in providing opportu-
\¿. >- \
nities for the electorate to see and
hear candidates and arranging for the
"live" transmission of sessions of
legislative and administrative bodies
where the people's business is being
transacted: broadcasts from legisla¬
tive bodies, city councils, school
boards, and public hearings.
Thus, a free press, protected by
democratic society, is in turn a bul¬
wark in maintaining the open and
effective working of that society.-
In addition to the functions of a
free press in relation to the political
system, the media play important
roles in social, cultural, and economic
areas. As instructional aids, they
supplement classroom teaching, help
people to make productive and reward¬
ing use of leisure, and provide a
variety of extra-mural learning oppor¬
tunities in areas where formal educa¬
tion systems have left a void.
The media are a major means of
cultural expression and provide a

of media in private hands, it is no¬
where so dangerous as leaving to a
concentration of government bureau¬
crats the power to decide what is to
be reported and what cannot.
Freedom of the press is an accoun¬
table freedom. In return for the as¬
surance of its freedom, the press
voluntarily accepts a social and ethi¬
cal responsibility to demonstrate a
commensurate competence and ma¬
turity of judgement. The founders
of the Government of the United
States trusted that such a reciprocal
arrangement would be honoured.
For 200 years this vital freedomeven
though sometimes carried to excess
been an essential force in keep¬
ing that Government stable.
Responsibility and freedom of the
press derive reciprocally from the
right of an individual in a democratic
society to know and understand.
The relationship of the individual
person and a free society is one not
of opposition, conflict, or fear but of
mutuality.
Thus, the more the individual is
fulfilled, the more society can achieve,
and the more society can achieve,
the more opportunity there is for
individual fulfilment. To make such
a cycle succeed, it is essential that
the people's right to know and under¬
stand be exercised to the fullest
extent through the independent ope¬
ration of the full range of communi¬
cation technology.
The functions of the media in
Western society are continually en¬
hanced and extended by advances in
communication technology: television
cartridge systems, multiplexing,
satellites, cable, lasers, facsimile,
and computers.
By constantly exploiting the capa¬
cities of new systems and techniques
for reproducing, storing, retrieving,
and disseminating information and
applying them to rapidly changing

circumstances. Western nations are
able to increase their citizens' capa¬
bility for rational decision and appro¬
priate responses to events.
New communications technolo¬
gies make more information available
more widely and more quickly; and,
because of their greater flexibility
and capacity, they also afford impro¬
ved means through which people can
communicate readily with one ano¬
ther and have a more direct involve¬
ment in decision-making.
The coming of such advanced tech¬
nologies as satellites and packet data
systems also multiplies the versatility
and reach of communications inter¬
nationally, including the potential of
sending audio and video signals
simultaneously to every part of the
earth. Increasing the amount of
communication and the distances it
can be sent does not, of coursé, have
anything to do with its quality or
social usefulness.
Hence, as the technological poten¬
tial of the global free flow of informa¬
tion is achieved, it will place great
responsibility upon those who pro¬
duce and distribute programmes and
require great wisdom on the part of
international bodies and their consti¬
tuents in establishing principles and
agreements that will permit the ful¬
lest use of a space communications
system for constructive international
purposes, used in such a way that its
benefits can be shared by both rich
and poorer countries.
Otherwise, the overwhelming flow
of media from the industralized na¬
tions to the developing nations will
continue; and the wondrous new
developments in communications
machinery will only widen and deepen
the division of our global village into
the haves and have-nots.
Just as domestically the open ex¬
change of ideas and information
must be a true exchange if it is to be
effective, so, at the international
level, sharing the benefits of such
advanced technology as satellites
should increasingly include opportu¬
nities for access to this technology
for the purpose of sending as well as
receiving.
Moreover, free flow of information
internationally can be truly free only
if it is two-way. The United States
has offered to join other countries
with advanced communication capa¬
cities in endeavouring to make avai¬
lable, through binational or multi¬
national channels, both governmental
and private, assistance to developing
countries to help, them meet their
basic communication needs and thus
provide a practical means for them
to have their voices heard and to
enlarge their participation in the free
flow process.
The United States, which has been
foremost in communication satellite
development, is sensitive to the
concern of nations which fear pos¬
sible abuses by broadcasting satel
lites, but is seeking a solution which A
does not abridge the freedom to *
transmit and receive information.
In this regard, it is championing a
principle of freedom that has been
internationally proclaimed. It exists
in the laws of many countries, in the
Declaration of Human Rights, and in
other United Nations recommenda¬
tions and resolutions.
It is the view of the United States,
shared by a number of nations, that
some sort of policy framework is
necessary for the co-ordinatibn of
international communications.
The goal of the international com¬
munity should be to elicit from com¬
munication satellite technologies the
greatest possible benefits for all and
not to risk discouraging their poten¬
tial for good by imposing strictures
that might seriously jeopardize the
full development of the most power¬
ful means for world-wide furtherance
of free flow, expansion of education,
and promotion of understanding.
The potential quantum jump in
communication capacity posited by
the advent of the synchronous satel¬
lite offers the best hope for sharing
the world's store of knowledge in
such a way as to reduce the widening
disparities among nations.
Misdirected, it can become a force
for trivialization and deception, ex¬
ploitation, and disruption. Properly
developed through international
co-operation that is based upon un¬
derstanding of both the potential
assets and potential liabilities implicit
in its application, this most advanced
technology of communication can be
transformed into a beneficent-servant
of mankind.
If this promise is to be fulfilled, the
prerequisite must be an increased
understanding of the concept of a
free press throughout the world.
