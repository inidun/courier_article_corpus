The longevity  
■
O ver the past hundred ye a rs a silent and
unprecedented revolution in longevity has
occurred: people living in the industrialized
world have on average gained 25 ye a rs of life, t h a n k s
largely to reduction of deaths at childbirth and
infancy, and to control of diseases associated with
old age. This is nearly equal to life expectancy
advances over the preceding 5,000 years. In many
c o u n t ri e s , the 85-plus age group is the most rapidly
growing.
The next century may bring even more
d r a m atic increases. P r e vention and elimination of
disease along with control over the aging process
itself could push our life spans from a wo r l d
average of 66 ye a rs today to closer to 110 or 120
ye a rs — w h at scientists believe to be our “ n at u r a l
life span” because many individuals have lived that
l o n g . Some scientists talk of pushing the
b o u n d a ries further by gaining control over the
genes that determine longevity.
But our enhanced life spans do not come
without a price. As the demographic balance
increasingly tips to the elderly, societies are seeing
their cultural, political and economic orders put
to the test.
Among the most basic questions facing us are:
At a time when the welfare state is coming under
at t a c k , who will be responsible for the fin a n c i a l
s u p p o rt of the aged, the state or the individual? W i l l
the aging of societies lead to economic stagnation?
Will the aged form a politically powerful minority
and if so, what demands will that group make? In

extending our time on this planet, will we also be
able to maintain quality of life, or are we doomed to
pass our later ye a rs in sickness, frailty and fin a n c i a l
incertitude? Culturally, will some of the attention
now concentrated on youth shift to the elderly? As
women outlive men in most of the industri a l i z e d
world, many of the challenges associated with old
age are particularly pertinent to them.
In extending our time on this
planet, will we also be able to
maintain quality of life?

  re v o l u t i o n Robert Butler*
Our gr e ater longevity has brought fundamental
changes to our lives in ways that we either take for
granted or of which we are hardly awa r e . Fo r
e x a m p l e , in 1920, a 10-year-old in the US only had
a 40 per cent chance of having two of his or her
possible four grandparents alive.Today, that figure
is 80 per cent.Thus, despite romantic images of a
tighter-knit family of former day s , in fa c t ,t o d ay we
h ave a much gr e ater proportion of multi-
generational families than ever before.
In many way s , life is improving for the aged.
For example, in the 1950s the average age of
admissions into nursing homes was 65. N ow the
age is closer to 81. To d ay, older people in
i n d u s t rialized countries also have more choices
about how they live: assisted living, home care or
community-based care, for example. M o r b i d i t y
r ates are falling as a result of progress against heart
disease and stroke.
‘Silver industries’ 
to cater for the over-50s
One of the most fundamental issues is how to
s u p p o rt the aged fin a n c i a l l y. Different societies have
come up with different approaches. Despite its
c u rrent economic difficulties, Japan adheres to a
system under which the state provides for
institutional and home care of the elderly. T h e
United States is leading the way in a profit - o ri e n t e d ,
managed care system, which emphasizes primary
c a r e , disease prevention and monitoring of
d i s t ri bu t i o n . H owe ve r , the US is not going fa r
enough nor moving rapidly enough gi ven the
t r a j e c t o ry of old age. M e a n w h i l e , the former Sov i e t
Union has made major cutbacks in health care
while slashing pension benefits as well.
So far much of our thinking about the aged has
focused on them as a financial bu r d e n . But that
attitude ignores fundamental facts that suggest to
some extent that the ve ry opposite is tru e .To d ay in
the US pension funds amount to $2.7 tri l l i o n .T h i s
is money that helps provide capital for investment
in production of goods and serv i c e s , e ve ry t h i n g
from roads to computer software start - u p s. O ve r a l l ,
in the US, pension funds account for a quarter of all
capital formation.
We must also remember that the aged represent
an important group of consumers with ve ry specific
n e e d s. T h u s , in  Ja p a n , for example, a range of
“ s i l ver industri e s ” has gr own up to cater to the
h o u s i n g, t r ave l ,r e c r e ation and other needs of those
over 50.Similarly, in the United States companies
talk increasingly about the senior or mature market.
In recognition of the potential of this market, a
number of publishers and electronic community
builders have set up Internet web sites targeted at
the aged, complete with advertisements aimed at

to add to their bottom lines, p h a rm a c e u t i c a l s
companies increasingly concentrate on needs of the
e l d e r l y : in industrialized countries those over 65
constitute roughly 15 per cent of the populat i o n
but account for some 30 per cent of
pharmaceuticals used.
Po l i t i c a l l y, the elderly will become a more
p owerful group with whom political parties in
democratic countries at least will have to reconcile
their policies. In the US, for example, the “ b a b y
b o o m e rs ,” b o rn between 1946 and 1964 will begi n
to retire in the year 2008.In the decade beginning
from 2020, they will constitute 20 per cent of the
US population and as much as 30 per cent of the
e l e c t o r at e .Political candidates will no doubt have to
pay increasing attention to their needs.
As societies struggle to address the challenges of
a ging populat i o n s , mere reorganization of the serv i c e s
to the elderly is no longer adequat e .We require a

redesign of the way we approach the needs of the
e l d e r l y. In order for redesign to take place, some of our
basic assumptions about the nature and character of
old age must be questioned. This is already
h a p p e n i n g . B e ginning in the 1950s, i n d u s t ri a l i z e d
society began to perceive old age not as a period of life
t h at is biologically fixe d , but as one that is mutable.
The feel-good 
factor
There are a number of reasons for these
c h a n ging views. For one, the self-image of the aged
has been changi n g . I n c r e a s i n g l y, they now see
t h e m s e l ves as vibrant and energetic and are not
willing to let life end at retirement. S e c o n d l y,
gerontologists now have a better understanding of
the underlying mechanism of aging itself. This is
leading to an appreciation of the possibility and
reality of interve n t i o n s , both preve n t at i ve and
therapeutic.
The gr owing demographic weight of the elderly
is forcing us to reevaluate many of our old views.
Since people are living longer, should they not wo r k
longer as well? To that question I would gi ve a
qualified yes. In the US, if we do not change our
at t i t u d e s , we may by around the year 2020 have
some 60 million idle people in retirement not
c o n t ri buting to society. We cannot afford to have
so many people idle. Passage of the A g e
D i s c ri m i n ation Act in 1988 was a step forward as it
no longer made retirement dependent on age itself.
The market place has already absorbed millions of
women and minorities, so there is no reason why
jobs should not be found for older people as well.
Yet there are still many challenges ahead of us.
The developing world has not generally enjoye d
the same increase in longevity and decreased birth
r ates that have been seen in industrialized countri e s.
Sixty per cent of persons over the age of 60
c u rrently live in the developing world and this is
expected to increase to 80 per cent by around the
year 2025. T h u s , there will be profound social,
