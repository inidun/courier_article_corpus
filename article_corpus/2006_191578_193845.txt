                              mediterranean island landscapes have experienced deforestation 
           and desertification since classical times. today, rising tourism and farming 
increasingly deplete groundwater resources and threaten to accelerate desertification.

The real MediTerranean landscape?
Agricultural land in Cyprus struggles against a combination 
of irregular rainfall and year-long sunshine.

so the hundreds of thousands of 
north European tourists who visit 
the Mediterranean every year, the 
carob groves and scrubland that 
surround many an ancient site are 
the region’s archetypal scenery. 
But a visit to a natural history 
museum will reveal that that this 
landscape is not the one that an-
cients saw. Until Classical times, 
the sea’s larger islands had thick-
ly forested mountainous interiors 
that once harboured elephants 
and rhinoceroses. 
The low-growth scrubs of myrtle 
and broom or aromatic herbs we 
today think of as typically Mediterra-
nean are largely the result of man’s 
activity in chopping down primeval 
forests for agriculture, fuel or build-
ing homes and ships. 
But the process does not stop 
there -- further erosion of the soil 
can create barren steppeland 
where only thistle and asphodel, 
symbol of the underworld to the an-
cients, survive. 
At the far eastern end of the 
Mediterranean, the resort island of 
Cyprus has retained one of the re-
gion’s most diverse fauna and flora, 
with its relative isolation giving it 
one of Europe’s highest numbers 
of endemic species. 
But each spring southerly winds 
from nearby Africa dump Saharan 
sand from Egypt and Libya in a re-
minder of the fragility of the island’s 
ecosystems.

In 2000, Cyprus ratified the UN 
Convention to Combat Desertifica-
tion. Two years later, it submitted 
its first report, which identified the 
principal threats as climate change, 
soil erosion, overuse of water and 
the impact of man. 
A changing 
environment
Analysis of weather data from the 
past century suggests the island 
is growing hotter by up to 0.01 
degrees centigrade per year and 
growing drier by about one millime-
tre per year in precipitation. And it 
is growing drier from a low base. 
Although the island as a whole ave- 
rages around 480 millimetres of 
rain or snow per year, large parts 
receive less than 200 millimetres. 
The southern foothills of the main 
Troodos mountain range and the 
Mesaoria plain between the capi-
tal Nicosia and the eastern city of 
Famagusta are the worst affected 
and among the most prone to de-
sertification. 
Existing water supply is also being 
used ever more plentifully as the 
island’s agriculture becomes more 
intensive. 
“Overexploitation of (groundwa-
ter) usually results in sea intrusion 
and destruction of the aquifers thus 
adding to the desertification prob-
lem,” the government report ac-
knowledges. 
The island’s small Green Party, 
which forms part of the governing 
coalition, has been particularly ac-
tive on the issue, pressing for more 
research into a problem that threat-
ens not only the island’s natural 
environment but also much of its 
tourism potential. 
“An affiliated scientific organiza-
tion is working on a scientific basis 
to document the level of desertifi-
cation in Cyprus,” said the party’s 
environment spokesman Costas 
Papastavros. 
“We need to understand more 
about the parameters of the 
problem. The landscape issue is 
a very hot issue for the tourism 
industry as well.”
Sustainable water 
management
The conservation group Birdlife 
Cyprus also conducts research. 
But for its director Martin Hellicar, 
the key is sustainable agriculture. 
“It boils down to water manage-
ment. Agriculture in Cyprus over 
the past 20 or 30 years has be-
come more and more water-hun-
gry,” Hellicar explains. “The ques-
tion is: Is this sustainable?” 
“What is happening is that the 
areas that are intensively farmed 
are becoming more intensively 
farmed,” he says. “More marginal 
farms in upland areas are being 
abandoned. This is not what you 
want.” 
Artemis Yiordanli heads envi-
ronmental group Terra Cypria, 
which has been active trying to re-
verse the exodus of young people 
from marginal rural communities 
through the introduction of sus-
tainable development concepts 
like agro-tourism. 
“Deforestation in the 20th or 
21st century is man-made,” she 
says. “More lands are being aban-
doned from agriculture. Some 
return to forest if they are high 
enough, some go to low-growth, 
especially when you have over-
grazing. The implication for biodi-
versity is obvious.” 
Since the 1980s the government 
has been engaged in afforesta-
tion of some land in extreme con-
dition. By 2001, 4,300 hectares 
had been afforested under the 
programme and another 10,000 
hectares are planned over the 
current decade. 
But the issue is a complex one, 
and the scheme is not without 
its critics. 
“Reforestation needs to be ap-
propriate,” says Hellicar. “It is not 
always necessarily a good thing to 
have trees. Bird species like the lark 
or stone curlew, which are of Euro-
pean importance, are dependent 
on drier, more open landscapes.”

Myrtle and broom are not 
“typically Mediterranean.” 
This landscape resulted when 
primeval forests were chopped 
down for agriculture, fuel and 
building homes and ships.
Sand encroaches on agricultural fields south 
of the Cyprus capital Nicosia, more than 30 
kilometres from the beach.

in the 20th or 21st century
