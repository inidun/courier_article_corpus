It looks the same. Tastes the same. It eve n
smells the same, with that familiar foul whiff
of chlori n e . But the seemingly ordinary glass
of water is becoming more and more precious for
the two million inhabitants of Budapest. B e t we e n
1991 and 1999, water prices increased threefold.
Across Hungary, people have seen their water bills
gr ow as much as five times as state budgets dry up,
l e aving public utilities to either cut services or
charge higher rat e s.
After 40 years of socialist mismanagement,
Hungarians have developed an allergy to anything
centrally-run.As a result, the water utilities, which
used to be run mostly by state bodies, were
t r a n s f o rmed into share-holding companies
belonging to the municipal governments between
1991 and 1994. H owe ve r , m a ny of the local
governments are finding the responsibilities of the
companies to be more than they bargained for.
To begin with, municipal authorities had to
raise the water bills of the people who elected
them. Second, the inherited infrastructure is in
need of major investment.While the supply system
ensures that almost everyone has water, very little
of the water used is treated. In Budapest, for
example, about 70 per cent of all waste water is
dumped into the Danube each year (about 193
million cubic metres in 1998), to the growing
chagrin of downstream neighbours. Under the
Sophia Convention of 1994, Hungary has agreed
to curb this pollution but the infrastru c t u r e
required will cost about three billion dollars.
In their search for reve n u e , m u n i c i p a l
g ove rnments are increasingly turning to
p ri vat i z at i o n . B e t ween 1994 and 1997, they sold
25 to 50 per cent of the shares of six of the more
than 200 municipal water companies. These six
companies supply water to about a quarter of the
p o p u l ation nat i o n - w i d e .
But judging by initial results, it will take some
time before that investment translates into
i m p r oved supply and treatment systems. I n
B u d a p e s t , for example, new revenues from the
p ri vatized system are supposed to cover not just
o p e r ating costs but also repairs , n o t a b l y,
r e c o n s t ruction of 10 per cent of the capital’s 4,400
kilometres of pipeline each ye a r. Yet only 30
kilometres of pipeline were fixed last ye a r.
However, there is still a popular conviction that
private managers are bound to do better than civil
s e rva n t s. I n d e e d , economic efficiency has
improved in the capital over the last couple of
years, since some of the water assets were bought
by a Franco-German consortium for $91 million.
The consortium manages the system, while the
municipality retains control over key issues like
water pricing.
Last year, the consortium managed to trim
about $12 million from operating costs, essentially
by restructuring and cutting jobs. The investors
r e c e i ved 75 per cent of these sav i n g s. T h e
remaining 25 per cent were used to keep prices as
low as possible. Even so, last year’s rates still rose
more than 20 per cent against a consumer price
index increase of 13 to 14 per cent. For this year,
private investors originally proposed a 25 per cent
increase which the local government rejected.Only
after protracted negotiations did the two sides
agree to a compromise of 13 per cent,slightly more
than the predicted inflation rate.
The bottom line is clear: no one is satisfied.
Private investors are faced with companies that
continue to lose money, while municipal
authorities fear the political costs from rising water
prices. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens hold their
noses over glasses of water that cost more each
year. n
