“The future for youths like me in Ciudad Bolívar is
g u n s ,” s ays 20-year-old Victor Manuel.“ F i rst yo u
h ave to surv i ve the gangs.Then you spend a ye a r
in the army, hoping not to be sent to a combat zone.
After that , if you want to raise a fa m i l y, you get a job as
a security guard for a firm or a block of flat s. Or else yo u
do dirty work for the militias or the drug lords.”
Victor is one of thousands of dead-end kids who
gr ow up on the dusty hillsides of Ciudad Boliva r , in the
slums around the Colombian capital of Bogotá. O ve r
the past 40 ye a rs , one and a half million people have
poured into the area—a fifth of the city’s population.
Victor decided to steer clear of guns. He didn’t wa n t
to be a security guard, a soldier,a smuggler or a gang-
s t e r. He didn’t want to get into drugs either. “ Ta k i n g
d rugs is a form of we a k n e s s ,” he say s. “It shows yo u
c a n ’t face up to life. I t ’s the same with violent cri m e .”
Instead,Victor wants to make videos.
His new home is Ciudad Bolíva r ’s Youth 
L e a d e rship School, a rather pompously named asso-
c i ation which was created by and for needy yo u n g
people and which operates from the basement of a four-
storey bu i l d i n g .Victor and his friends make big sacri-
fices to pay the $100 monthly rent for these premises.
With help from pri vate unive rsities and a foundat i o n
run by a Colombian bu s i n e s s m a n , they are trying to set
up a community radio station and meanwhile produce
videos about the lives of young people living in the
slums.
They believe communication is the only way to
change the lives of future gang members—the gr o u p s
of street youths who hang out in houses or on wa s t e
ground where they meet to compose rap songs and
sometimes plan petty crimes.
The themes of the videos, which reflect life in
Ciudad Bolíva r , are worked out together.V i c t o r ’s
first production, A Taste of Evil, tells the story of a
family that fled from the countryside when they
heard ru m o u rs of massacres. For the children of this
family violence was just that—a rumour of some-
thing that happened in the next village.T h e n ,w h e n
they got to Ciudad Bolíva r , they encountered vio-
lence on a daily basis, along with the lure of cri m e
and dru g s.
D u ring the making of the second video, D r e a m s
and Dreamers,a gang member from the slum stole the
equipment the team had painstakingly 
a s s e m b l e d .The boys at the Leadership School we r e
ready to reve rt to their old habits of gang fighting to
get the mat e rial back. But it wa s n ’t necessary.T h e
local people protested and the gang members retur-
ned the equipment. “They didn’t realize it was as if
they had stolen something of their ow n ,” s ays V i c t o r.
The Leadership School’s goal is to change the
attitudes of young delinquents.The fil m i n g, w h i c h
i nvo l ves about 50 yo u t h s , is a chance to establish
a dialogue with the street kids.The videos are show n
in churches, s c h o o l s , community centres and at local
festivals with the aim of trying to influence groups
of youths by using codes and symbols they are fa m i-
liar with.
But it isn’t easy to persuade teenagers to aban-
don violence when their cultural environment is full
of despair. “ L i ve hard and die young because the-
re’s no hope,” say rock,rap and heavy metal songs.
“It’s also hard to compete when a kid can make 50
or 100,000 pesos ($25 or $50) in a 15-minute rob-
bery,” says Victor.
The Leadership School offers no real job oppor-
tunities but it does provide one-year courses which
gi ve yo u n g s t e rs experience in community 
m a n a g e m e n t . It equips them to contri bute to the
hundreds of small organizations and informal gr o u p s
which spring up in the slums and constitute the only
c o l l e c t i ve response to pove rty and neglect.
Fo rty young people have already gr a d u ated from
this neighbourhood unive rsity where Victor took a
second shot at life. n
