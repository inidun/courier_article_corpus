The largest treaty ever negotiat e d , the United
N ations Convention on the Law of the Sea
is a fairly recent deve l o p m e n t ,e n t e ring into
force on 16 November 1994.Yet its roots stem
back to the early 1950s when the UN Intern at i o-
nal Law Commission was set up with the task of
codifying and developing intern ational law,a gr e at
deal of which is unwri t t e n ,a rising from the consis-
tent practice of stat e s. While this customary
approach is excellent for establishing pri n c i p l e s ,
t r e aties are needed to work out the essential details.
For more than 300 ye a rs , it was simply
accepted that coastal states are each entitled to
s overeignty over a body of water immediat e l y
beside the coast. This sovereignty was absolute
Over the last fifty years, international maritime law
has developed very rapidly. This is hardly surprising
given the unprecedented demands now put upon the
oceans, their resources and the marine environment.
Laws  
except for the right of innocent passage by
foreign merchant ve s s e l s. H owe ve r , i n t e rn at i o-
nal law did not, for example, d e fine the exact
extent of this “ t e rri t o rial sea” (which was three
and is now twe l ve nautical miles) or the condi-
tions of “innocent passage”. So in about 1951,
the Intern ational Law Commission began wo r-
king to resolve these old issues as well as some
new ones: namely the conservation of the
o c e a n ’s living resources and petroleum deve l o p-
ment on the continental shelf.
C o n c e rned by dwindling fish stocks, c o u n-

Iceland had been pressing for decades for zones
of fis h e ries conservation juri s d i c t i o n . H owe ve r ,
they were outnumbered by the majority of coas-
tal states who wanted to preserve more or less
unlimited and unrestricted access to the living
resources in what were still regarded as the high
s e a s.

demand led A m e rican experts to look closely at
the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico beyond the
three nautical mile limit. Yet there was a pro-
b l e m . While companies were not prohibited
from exploring beyond that limit, they enjoye d
no legal security in conducting operat i o n s
t h e r e . They also had no “ l e g a l ” rights to any
petroleum they might fin d . In order to prov i d e
a proper legal foundation for offshore petro-
leum activities (and the steep investment requi-
r e d ) , the A m e rican gove rnment proposed that
all coastal states should have the right to extend
their jurisdiction to the edge of the “ c o n t i n e n t a l
s h e l f” .
This proposal was accepted with gr e at
enthusiasm throughout the wo r l d . H owe ve r , t h e
m o t i ves for agreement were not all the same.
For some countri e s , the extension was a cloak
for control over the adjacent fis h e ry. This fun-
damental difference prompted the Intern at i o n a l
L aw Commission to step in and lead the way to
the First United Nations Conference on the
L aw of the Sea, c o nvened in Geneva in 1958.
Yet despite the fact that four Conve n t i o n s — o n
the Te rri t o rial Sea and Contiguous Zone, t h e
High Seas, the Living Resources of the High
S e a s , and the Continental Shelf—were accepted
and signed, there was an obvious dive r g e n c e
b e t ween countries in favour of fis h e ries juri s d i c-
tion and those opposed. As a result, there we r e
major gaps in some of the treat i e s.
A second conference convened in 1960 to
r e s o l ve the issue was an absolute fa i l u r e . F r o m
then on, s t ates which considered that they had
been victimized by the lack of jurisdiction felt
obliged to take the law into their own hands.
C o u n t ries like Iceland started enforcing exclu-
s i ve fis h e ries zones to 12, then 50, then 200
nautical miles. O t h e rs followed suit; s o m e
w i l l i n g l y, o t h e rs less so, but the former eve n-
tually prevailed over the latter while the
C o nvention was still being negotiat e d .
M e a n w h i l e , p r o gress was made in dealing
with mineral resources. C o u n t ries looked
favourably upon the Convention on the
Continental Shelf of 1958 which recognized
“ s overeign rights for the purposes of explora-
tion and exploitat i o n ” on the seabed and sub-
soil of the shelf. It is important to note that the
t e rms “ s ove r e i g n t y ” or “ ow n e rs h i p ” are careful-
ly avo i d e d . The Conve n t i o n ’s framers did not
want to suggest that countries exercised absolu-
te rights beyond the limits of the terri t o rial sea,
because this might ultimately endanger the free-
dom of the seas.
Rights and fre e d o m s
The problem lay in defining the extent of these
ri g h t s. A fixed limit was seen as art i fic i a l . On the
other hand, a reference to the geographical fea-
ture “continental shelf” would not please coas-
tal states like Chile which does not have a nat u-
ral shelf of significant extent. So the edge of the
“ l e g a l ” continental shelf was fixed at the 200-
metre isobath (the wo r l d ’s average shelf edge
d e p t h ) , or beyond “to the point where the depth
of the superjacent wat e rs admits of exploita-
t i o n ” . In other wo r d s , all countries were gua-
ranteed a minimum of control to a 200-metre
d e p t h , while those that had the technology to
exploit deeper could still do so. We must
remember that in 1958, 200 metres seemed to
be an extraordinary depth.The problem wa s , o f
c o u rs e , t h at science and technology deve l o p e d
faster than anyone had thought possible.
So by the early 1970s, it looked as if indus-
t rialized coastal states were about to carve up
the wo r l d ’s ocean space. This was unacceptable
for a number of reasons. F i rs t , it looked like a
bonanza for coastal states at the expense of their
land-locked cousins. S e c o n d , accidents of poli-
tical geogr a p hy sometimes resulted in curi o u s
b o u n d a ri e s. C o u n t ries with relat i vely long
coastlines were clearly going to do better than

o t h e rs. Po rt u g a l , or Chile with its 4,200 kilo-
metres of coast would have a relat i vely vast area
of ocean space compared, s ay, to Spain.
There was also a serious ethical problem. I f
n ational jurisdiction was allowed to spread
u n c h e c k e d , it would be virtually impossible to
fairly distri bute the oceans’ r e s o u r c e s. To coun-
ter this, attention turned to limiting this juri s-
diction and recognizing the areas beyond as the
“common heritage of mankind”.
G i ven the dimensions of the problems, t h e
time was clearly ripe for another intern at i o n a l
c o n f e r e n c e . For example, the archipelagic stat e s
wanted recognition of their ri g h t s
to the wat e rs between and around
their islands. Landlocked stat e s
wished to have their rights of
access to marine resources clearly
a rt i c u l at e d . And there was an
urgent need for detailed ru l e s
regarding the preservation of the
m a rine environment—a topic vir-
tually ignored in 1958. And who
was to gove rn and profit from the
area beyond national juri s d i c t i o n ?
There was also some feeling that
the Intern ational Court of Justice could not pro-
perly resolve these issues. A tri bunal was needed
to specialize in the Law of the Sea.
A third UN conference ended in December
1 9 8 2 . All the part i c i p ating countries voted for
the Convention except four—Israel, Tu r k e y, t h e
United Stat e s , and Venezuela—and seve n t e e n
t h at abstained. Until recently, the countri e s
becoming full parties to the Convention we r e
found in A s i a , A f ri c a , and South A m e ri c a .T h i s ,
and the continuing refusal of the United Stat e s
e ven to sign the Conve n t i o n , led some observe rs
to dismiss the conference results, but it is now
clear that such judgments were premat u r e .
The major difficulty lies with mining the
deep seabed, which is the area considered to be
the common heritage of mankind. US firm s
p r e vailed on the Reagan administration not to
s i g n , much less rat i f y, the Conve n t i o n .
H owe ve r , a compromise on the regime for such
mining was reached in 1994 which should
p r ove acceptable to all (and is to the industri a-
lized countri e s ) .
Yet as in 1958, not eve rything is perfect. Fo r
e x a m p l e , C a n a d a ’s east coast has one of the
wo r l d ’s most extensive continental shelve s.
According to the Conve n t i o n , petroleum activi-
ties in this area are firmly under Canadian juri s-
d i c t i o n . H owe ve r , control over living resources
extends only to 200 nautical miles through the
c r e ation in 1994 of the Exclusive Economic
Z o n e s.The problem is, C a n a d a ’s shelf goes we l l
b e yond this distance, with species swimming in
and out of the zone. S o, in theory, foreign ve s-
sels can remain just outside Canadian juri s d i c-
tion and catch as many fish as they please, to the
possible detriment of Canadian fis h e rs who are
obliged to follow Canadian rules in or out of the
z o n e . This has led to both a confrontation and
t r e aty between Canada and Spain; the problem
was resolved by an A greement on High Seas
F i s h e ries in 1995.
C o n s e rvation and control are the raisons
d’être of the law of the sea. The concept of the
“common heritage of mankind”
recognizes that a country should
not have the right to exploit a
resource (e.g. the deep sea-bed)
merely because it has the capacity
to do so.The common heritage is
held in trust for the peoples of all
c o u n t ri e s.The Convention forbids
e x p l o r ation or exploitation there
without a mandate from the
I n t e rn ational Seabed A u t h o ri t y
(established by the Conve n t i o n
and based in Jamaica) which must
ensure that the benefits accruing are distri bu t e d
e q u i t a b l y.The other expert bodies are emergi n g :
the Tri bunal on the Law of the Sea was establi-
shed in Hamburg in 1996, and the Continental
Shelf Commission now meets in New Yo r k . I n
s h o rt , the process is well underway.
No-one should underestimate the chal-
lenges invo l ved in implementing the
C o nve n t i o n , which has now been rat i fied by
125 stat e s. Yet in light of the fragility of our
ocean env i r o n m e n t , it is in the interest of both
the industrialized and less-industrialized stat e s
alike to overcome them. ■

International maritime tre a t i e s
While the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea deals in more general terms with the different uses of
the seas, there are a number of treaties and instruments on more specific aspects of marine affairs. Here are some
examples:
Maritime safety:
International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)
Adopted in 1974,entered into force in 1980, 137  Contracting States.
The most important of all treaties dealing with the safety of merchant ships, its first version was adopted in 1914,
after the Titanic disaster in 1912.It is updated by periodic amendments to keep pace with technical developments in
the shipping industry.
Marine pollution from vessels:
International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties.
Adopted in 1969,entered into force in 1975,72 Contracting States. It affirms the right of a coastal State to take such
measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate danger to its coastline following a
maritime casualty.
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. Adopted in
1972,entered into force in 1975,77 Contracting States.It prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials from
vessels, aircraft,platforms or other man-made structures, requires prior permits for the dumping of a number of other
identified materials and wastes.
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78)
Adopted in 1973. Due to the technical complexity and wide scope of the Convention, various parts of it have ente-
red into force at different dates. Although Annex IV concerning sewage has been accepted by 70 states, their mer-
chant fleets represent only 41.47% of world tonnage. Until countries with the largest fleets have accepted and the
required minimum percentage of 50% is achieved, this annex will not enter into force.
This is the most important and ambitious of all international treaties on marine pollution, covering all the tech-
nical aspects of accidental and operational pollution from ships, except the disposal of waste by dumping and pollu-
tion arising out of the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources.
International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation. Adopted in 1990,ente-
red into force in 1995,38 Contracting States. It combats major incidents or threats of marine pollution,requires ships
and operators of offshore units to have oil pollution emergency plans, calls for the establishment of stockpiles of oil
spill combating equipment and the holding of combating exercises.
Marine pollution from land-based activities:
No global agreement exists dealing specifically with the prevention and control of marine pollution from land-based
activities. However, the non-binding “Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from
Land-based Activities” was adopted in Washington on 3 November 1995 and is expected to enhance proper mana-
gement of land-based activities that could cause marine pollution.
Liability and compensation:
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. Adopted in 1969,entered into force 1975,
100  Contracting States. Brought about by the Torrey Canyon incident of 1967,the Convention ensures that adequa-
te financial compensation is available to persons who suffer oil-pollution damage from ships and places the liability
for such damage on the shipowner.
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage resulting from Exploration for and Exploitation of
Seabed Mineral Resources
Adopted in 1977, not yet in force. It is designed to ensure that adequate compensation is available to victims of pol-
lution damage from seabed activities by means of the adoption of uniform rules and procedures determining ques-
tions of liability.
International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of
Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea. Adopted in 1996,not yet in force. The Convention makes it possible
for the equivalent of $250 million to be paid out in compensation to victims of accidents involving chemicals;covers
not only pollution but also the risks of fire and explosion. ■
