The
unrewarded
housewife
by Kirsten Ording Haarr
KIRSTEN ORDING HAARR of Norway is a
leading figure in the Norwegian Housewives'
Association and was a member of its board in
1974-1975. She has published numerous
articles on social questions and is the author of
"Parents as Partners In Schools' a bookpublished
in Oslo in 1971. She has been particularly
active in promoting parent participation in
schools and from 1969 to 1971 served on a
committee set up by the Ministry of Education
to develop shared responsibilities in Norway's
state school system.
IN the eyes of the law, we
Norwegian women have equal
rights with men. But we have still not
answered two vital questions: What
part do we intend to play in our
country's economic, social and cultural
life? To what set of values should
we commit ourselves?
In Norway 579,000 women regard
work in the home and caring for their
children as their main occupation
(although many also do up to 20 hours
a week paid work outside the home).
But only 45,000 of them have joined the
Norwegian Housewives' Association.
Very few of these 579,000 women
are present when economic, social and
human questions are discussed and
when priorities are established and
resources are allocated. The few
women who are present seldom dare,
or even wish, to stand up against the
men who dominate these discussions.
Should we then conclude that
women have no influence on the
development of our modern society?
Not at all. As I see it, women live
according to a set of values which do
not figure on the politician's priority
list. On that list there are only things
that can be measured in quantity or in
terms of money.
And yet society as a whole and
each of its individual members are
dependent for their survival upon
women's values being maintained by
women themselves, of course, but
preferably by men and women working
together.
Mothers of small children have a
24-hour working day (a 168-hour
working week). They get no pay, have
no fixed working hours, no spare time
to call their own, and no holidays
with or without pay. They get no sick
pay and are not insured against
accidents while working at home.
Very few of them have their own
names on the front door or in the
telephone book.
These women are told over and
over again that they have no occu¬
pation and do no real work. For in
our modern society, to work is to do
things, no matter how harmful or
useless, which you are paid for.
A man said recently that a woman
working in the home today is as
obsolete as the horse that once
worked on the farm. In other words,
labour-saving devices have taken over
the housewife's jobs, just as tractors
have taken over from the horse.
His way of thinking seems to me
bereft of logic. As I see it, just as
tractors have made farm hands super¬
fluous, thus rendering the farmer
himself indispensable, instant food
products and modern household equip¬
ment have pushed all other human
hands out of the home, making the
housewife indispensable.
Payment is a poor criterion of
"work". What. happens every time
another woman steps into a house¬
wife's shoes to do part of her work
for parr of the day? The answer is
that everyone regards her as the most
important, hardworking, competent
and indispensable person in the
house, for the simple reason that she
receives money and social benefits
for her work.
A man once asked the Labour
Exchange to send him three home
helps. "Why three?" he was asked.
"My wife is ill and we have small
children so she has to be on duty
24 hours a day as I am away all week.
As each helper works only eight hours,
you must send us three."
From the moment a woman has a
child in our modern society, she is
condemned to a working day which
never ends, and she often finds herself
suddenly isolated with her child from
the rest of society. Our economic
experts and politicians have done ,.
precisely nothing to find out how herr

Mother's 24-hour
working day
in the land
of the Midnight Sun
Mothers of young children who also
do a job outside the home are on call
24 hours a day. They have to look
after their children (right), keep the
home clean and tidy, make and mend
clothes, cook, do the washing, etc.
As for the housewife with no outside
job, she gets no pay and nobody has
ever calculated the value of her ?
household work in monetary terms.
Almost 600,000 women in Norway
(population 4 million), like the young
mother seen here consider working
in the home as their main occupation
(although many also work part-time
outside the home). Opposite page,

working day can be shortened and
made easier.
Furthermore, the only remedy they
can offer for her isolation (which may
eventually lead to a mental break¬
down), is to put her child into a
nursery school for 9 or 10 hours a day,
under exclusively female supervision,
and to offer her an additional job a
poorly paid one at that.
Why is it that children are increas¬
ingly regarded as an expensive and
superfluous burden, as a nuisance and
a problem? Are we not forgetting
that the world's future will be decided
by the chances of growth and devel¬
opment which we give to our children,
and by the values which we foster
in them?
As her children grow up, the mother
working in the home can move around
more freely. But even then she may
still have her hands full, doing things
which are vital to her family and to
the community.
She has time to look after others,
healthy and sick, young and old,
members of her family and others.
(At the end of 1972, we had In Norway
456,712 children under seven years of
age and room for only 19,000 of them
in day nurseries. There were 194,910
Norwegians aged 75 or over, but only
32,000 places in various old-age
institutions.)
She keeps her home, clothes,
furniture and linen in good repair to
avoid having to buy new things before
it is really necessary.
She buys material and wool In order
to make clothes and knitwear.
She obtains or produces food and,
if she lives on a farm, sows and reaps.
She joins study groups to make
herself better qualified.
She does social work in the local
community and persuades the local
authorities to give priority aid to
activities for the benefit of children,
teenagers and old people.
She is in fact, without realizing it,
a practising ecologist.
Women in all parts of the world
have much in common. More than
men, in my view.
For biological reasons we are unable
to escape life's deeper realities. We
are all faced with pregnancy, birth,
nursing, the daily care of children,
parents, friends, the sick and the old.
Attending to primary needs is first
and foremost our business, wherever
we live.
So why do we not protest loudly
when we are told that we are econ¬
omic burdens on our husbands? Why
do we not rise up in anger when people
call us an encumbrance on society,
because what we do adds nothing to
the Gross National Product? And, by
the way, why is it that they do not
increase the GNP?
It is sheer insolence to tell us that
we are not helping to build society nor
taking an active part in the develop¬
ment of our country. On the other
hand, I think we should rejoice when
people say that we are not playing
our part in building today's "brave new
world" of -technology ruled by com¬
puters.
Men in our modern society have
made themselves a gigantic play¬
ground and filled it with machinery,
money and finance, technological
subtleties, weapons, and intellectual
exaggerations.
Some women want nothing better
than to go into the male playground
and work under their orders. Today
our men try to entice all Norwegian
women into the playground because
they need manual helpers. But their
thinking is schizophrenic. They want
the women in their playground, but
they find it impossible to envisage their
homes without the "little woman".
Women who pack chocolates for
eight hours every day are said to be"
finding fulfilment by taking part in the
"inspiring process of production". In
some mysterious fashion, the word
"production" has become synonymous
with "paid work".

It is quite true that many of these
women do find fulfilment but not
through packing chocolates. They do
it by producing vital goods and
services in their own homes after
working hours, at night, on Saturdays
and Sundays and during the summer
holidays.
I can see no valid reason why we
should not calculate this productive
work in the home in terms of money.
All we need is to work out special
rates for pregnancy, child-birth, and
nursing and let's not forget that
human milk is a valuable food and
rates a high price.
We also need special overtime rates
for work over and above an 8-hour
day, as well as holiday pay and decent
wages for inconvenient working hours,
night work and work on Sundays, etc.
The bill would be astronomical.
And at long last our economic experts
would have to admit the reason why
women's work in the home has never
been valued in monetary terms:
although it can be calculated, there is
simply not enough money in the world
to pay for it.
A woman with four children once
told me that she had just passed a
university exam, and in the next breath
she described how she had just
mended 12 pairs of trousers. Her
pride in her mending was obviously
no less intense than her joy in having
passed the exam. To my mind this
woman has a real sense of values.
On the same day that I talked to
her, I read in the paper that computers
worth billions of kroner are thrown on
the scrap heap every year because
new and more advanced models come
on the market.
We know that the "development"
instigated by highly educated men in
the world's industrialized countries
has brought us all to the brink of
disaster. And to our eternal disgrace
we, the women of the world, have done
very little to stop them.
Men squander raw materials which
can never be replaced. They waste
good soil and turn it into sand and
asphalt. They jeopardize the food
supplies in the sea without which the
world's people cannot survive.
They are like drivers who back their
cars towards a precipice while staring
ahead through the windscreen. The
cars have not yet gone over the edge
because women have acted as brakes.
The many vital goods and services
women provide in the home do not
involve a large consumption of natural
resources. It is only «when women
step into the male playground and
accept men's values that they help to
impoverish the earth.
Two different cultural patterns seem
to be developing throughout the world,
one made and used by men and the
other by women. There is a real
conflict between the two, a silent
struggle between one set of values
connected with money, technology
and everything measured in terms of
"living standards" and another based
on meeting the fundamental physical
and mental needs we call the "quality
of life".
We, the women of the world, must
begin to use our heads. Let us start
thinking. Let us talk to our menfolk.
Let us step outside our homes and
make our men step outside their play¬
ground; let us meet as partners and
equals, listen and talk and work
together.
Let us find out together how we can
harmonize the cultural patterns of men
and women and make a common effort
to save the world our children will
inherit.
