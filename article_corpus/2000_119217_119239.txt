C h ristopher Senono used to travel by
b i cycle 16 kilometres each way to
make a telephone call. A 30-ye a r - o l d
businessman from Nakaseke, U g a n d a ,h e
managed his small lumber and brick retail
trade by talking on the phone with suppliers
in Kampala.The trip seemed natural in a
country where the “teledensity” is roughly
three phone lines per 1,000 inhabitants. N o t
a ny more! Life in this village 60 km from
Kampala has changed since the opening of
a multipurpose community telecentre
(MCT) in 1999.
F i rst launched in 1985 in the fa rm i n g
community of Velmdalen (Swe d e n ) , t e l e-
centres aim to introduce new inform at i o n
and communication technologies to isola-
ted areas and provide people with the skills
to benefit from them.After spreading throu-
ghout rural areas of the Nort h , they are now
cropping up in A f ri c a , L atin A m e rica and
A s i a , often with support from intern at i o n a l
d e velopment agencies. It is likely that at least
s e veral hundred new centres are being star-
ted up each ye a r. In countries where indi-
vidual ow n e rship of inform ation and com-
munications is out of most people’s reach,
these telecentres may become the primary
way of allowing vast numbers to part i c i p at e
in the inform ation economy, p r ovided a few
basic conditions are met.
The first step is often to demonstrat e
h ow the equipment and facilities ava i l a b l e
in a telecentre can be made to work for the
communities where they are locat e d .
S e c o n d , time must be spent helping local
fa rm e rs ,t e a c h e rs or entrepreneurs unders-
tand the value of inform ation and the tools
t h at can be used to access it.T h i r d l y, s t a f f

Telecentres offer a promising route for rural communities of the developing world 
to break out of their isolation

first rural telecentres and has assisted with telecentre

must have the training and skills to keep
abreast of developments in softwa r e ,h a r d-
ware and networking technology.The most
e f ficient way to do this is to ensure that they
h ave a forum within which to meet, b o t h
v i rtually and humanly, so that links are crea-
ted among them. F i n a l l y, once the telecentre
is up and ru n n i n g, its staff must court the
community at large and introduce its mem-
b e rs to basic computer skills and identify
ways in which they might benefit from the
facilities and services.
Identifying and training local champions
who will nurture a telecentre project can
make or break the success of such a serv i c e .
It is especially important to have local sta-
k e h o l d e rs from health clinics, m u n i c i p a l i-
t i e s , e l e m e n t a ry schools and teacher trai-
ning colleges looking over your shoulder.
They are the people who are most likely to
become the core users who will diffuse the
t e c h n o l o gies widely. In Uganda, a candi-
d ate in a local election in the Nakaseke dis-
t rict turned the telecentre into a local cam-
paign issue, going as far as to promise people
who supported him a free trip to visit a
European or North A m e rican telecentre.
Without necessarily going to these ends,
g e n e r ating community interest in the ear-
liest stages of planning is a long-term asset.
O f t e n , in developing regi o n s ,c o m m u n i t i e s
are invo l ved by providing rent-free fa c i l i t i e s
to accommodate a telecentre or by bu i l d i n g
new ones.
It takes between $50,000 and $75,000 to
s t a rt a standard telecentre,although the early
p l a n n i n g, organizing and mobilization wo r k
can significantly increase the price tag (the
budgets of several current projects run from
$450,000 to $850,000). Annual operat i n g
costs are much less and generally include two
or three staff people.There are different pat h s
to sustainability: telecentres sometimes
become an integral part of a hospital serv i c e ,
a school or a municipality after three to five
ye a rs.A l t e rn at i ve l y, they can sustain them-
s e l ves by offering such profitable services as
t e l e p h o n e , fa x ,p h o t o c o p y i n g, résumé wri-
t i n g, training in desktop publishing and wo r d-
p r o c e s s i n g .And if they don’t manage all of
t h i s , telecentres at least have the benefit of lea-
ving behind a new corps of locally trained and
skilled people.
As intern ational development agencies
increasingly come to recognize the corr e l a-
tion between the adoption of inform at i o n
and communications technologies (ICTs)
and economic deve l o p m e n t , we need to
u n d e rstand that a social investment is requi-
red for the services available in a telecentre
to take root and offer benefits in the deve l o-
ping wo r l d .We should see telecentres as a
social investment which can help build a
future in the inform ation economy that is
i n t e r a c t i ve , not extractive . At the telecentre
in Nakaseke and in many other communi-
ties in the developing wo r l d , there are increa-
sing numbers of people who are committed
to making sure this happens. ■
