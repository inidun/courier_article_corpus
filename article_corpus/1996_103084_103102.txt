One-third of the world's popu¬
lation today lives less than ten
kilometres from a lake or ocean
shoreline. In the last fifty years the
movement of populations to coastal
regions has been growing, and sev¬
eral countries have already tried to
increase their land area by expanding
seawards.
Existing offshore installations and
artificial islands, together with the
marine cities of the future, were
studied by 237 scientists from 21
countries at a symposium called
"Ocean Cities '95" which was held
in Monaco in November 1995 by a
French association, Fondation 2100,
and France's Society of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, with the
honorary patronage of UNESCO and
the United Nations Centre for
Human Settlements (Habitat).
According to French engineer and
futurologist Thierry Gaudin, living
on or under the sea is now within our
reach as a result of recent progress
in technology. Engineers can claim
land from the sea by using rocks or
concrete caissons (as long as coastal
waters are not too deep) as fill, by
using floating caissons , or by building
under the sea. "We can harness solar,
wind and wave power," Gaudin says,
"desalinate sea water, feed ourselves
by means of aquaculture or hydro¬
ponic agriculture, and communicate
via dish antennae and satellites.
Meanwhile, new materials such as
polymers, elastomers, carbon fibres
and a new kind of unreinforced con¬
crete are fantastically successful in
the marine environment." Many
examples of marine installations
already exist; many more are at the
planning state. Some of them are
described below.
FONTVIEILLK (MONACO)
The Principality of Monaco, one of
the world's smallest states, provides
a striking example of seaward expan¬
sion. Located on a peninsula between
France and Italy, it has claimed land
from the Mediterranean on several
occasions.
Unlike most of the world's mar¬
itime extensions and artificial
islands except for oil-prospection
and -drilling platforms which are
found in depths up to 20 metres,
Monaco's Fontvieille project, which
was begun in 1966 and covers a 23-
hectare area, involved working at
depths of up to 35 metres.
Fontvieille is now a fully-equipped
urban settlement, with housing, com¬
mercial premises and offices, as well
as a sports complex including a
20,000-seat stadium. Plans for
extending the site even further are
being mooted, but building a plat¬
form over 40 metres deep poses a
number of problems, including that
of swell.

ARTIFICIAL LAKES AND
OFFSHORE TOURIST CENTRES
Another interesting scheme was pre¬
sented by French architect Michel
Pinseau, who would like to create a
tourist archipelago in the desert of
southernMorocco. Pinseau noted that
there are three large geological depres¬
sions 55 metres below sea level in the
Sahara north of Layoun, and thought
that they could be transformed into
artificial lakes via canals connecting
them to the Atlantic ten kilometres
away, thus providing tourists with a
hundred kilometres of sunny bea ches
all the year round. The biggest problem
would be supplying the resort with
drinking water, because there is not
enough groundwater in the area. One
possible solution would be to exploit the
difference between high and low tides
(3 metres) to operate small tidal power
stations producing enough energy to
desalinate the sea water.
Engineer Richard Dziewolski's
"Marinarium" projects are even more
futuristic. These "autonomous mar¬
itime tourist centres" are designed
to blend perfectly into the seascape
and respect the environment. Each
centre consists of a floating unit
equipped with breakwaters, houses,
two ports for ferries and pleasure
boats and a private beach. The Mari-
nariums are completely autonomous
thanks to facilities for filtering and
desalinating sea-water, treating
sewage and household waste and pro¬
ducing energy, and reservoirs for
stocking fresh water and fuel.
Each Marinarium is designed to
be assembled in a shipyard and then
towed to the site and attached by
cables to submersed dead weights.
Using this system, it would be pos¬
sible to anchor the floating city on a
site where the sea is up to 2,000
metres deep. The Marinarium pro¬
jects are based on tried and tested
offshore drilling technology.
A striking example of this tech¬
nology is a concrete oil-production
barge designed for deep-water use
(150 to 300 metres) in the Nkossa
oilfield, 60 kilometres off the Congo
coast. A floating island 220 metres
long and 46 metres wide (total
weight approximately 110,000
tonnes), the barge is unique. It is
being towed to its destination and
will house 30,000 tonnes of equip¬
ment and 160 people.
TOWN PLANNING AND
DEVELOPMENT
Japan has sought to claim land from
the sea for many years, and John Pina
Craven, a Hawaiian researcher, pre¬
sented to the Ocean Cities meeting a
report comparing filling operations in
Osaka Bay (Japan) and in Boston
(U.S.A.). In the nineteenth century
Boston wanted to expand its usable
land area by filling in Back Bay with
soil from nearby hills; a similar oper¬
ation has been carried out at Kobe
to make an artificial island, Port
Island. There is a big difference
between soil that has been compacted
for centuries and earth brought in
from outside, which behaves like
quicksand. The solution is to build
"floating" structures, like the library
of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), which rises and
sinks according to the weight of books
(and people) in it. However, this solu¬
tion was not adopted at Kansai air¬
port, which has been built at great
expense (some $20,000 million) in
Osaka Bay, and where fluidation of
the fill following the 1995 earthquake
has caused serious instability. Per¬
haps the Japanese should have chosen
one of the floating turnkey airports on
offer from Japanese firms.
Israel is thinking of building five
artificial islands to solve its over¬
population problems. As there is a
general shortage of fill material, engi¬
neers are thinking of using fly ash
from coal-fired power stations as bal¬
last for submersible caissons. A
model island with a base area of one
square kilometre has been designed
to support towers for an estimated
20,000 permanent residents and up
to 30,000 employees, visitors and
tourists. The distance from the
shoreline will be approximately one
kilometre. Non-polluting energy pro¬
duction and sewage treatment facil¬
ities are planned.
UNDERWATER VILLAGES
French architect Jacques Rougerie
suggests that we should build undcr-
water. Between 1977 and 1981 he
constructed underwater habitats
and villages, named Galathée,
Aquabulle and Hippocampe, which
46

have been tested in the course of
scientific and educational operations
in the Mediterranean. He has also
designed a 50- to 500-inhabitant
project called Sea Village for the
Virgin Islands (U.S.A.), which is
intended to provide a permanent
base for scientists and other
researchers, although much of it
would be reserved for accommoda¬
tion, leisure and sports facilities, as
well as an underwater oceanic cul¬
tural centre.
GAPS IN THE LAW
If ocean cities and artificial islands
develop, states will be faced with
new legal problems. In the nineteenth
century, the limits of territorial
waters were set at 3 miles from the
coast, i.e. the maximum distance
reached by cannon shot from sailing
ships. When firepower increased,
territorial waters were extended to
12 miles. But who, beyond that
limit, could now prevent the con¬
struction of a city, an airport, a pol¬
lution-producing factory, or even a
prison? As Thierry Gaudin points
out: "With law tailored for terres¬
trial nation-states, the status of the
high seas is extremely vague. . . .
The sea is like the Far West at the
time of the Gold Rush. It may well
become the Far West of the next
century."
Yet the Convention on the Law
of the Sea was adopted by the
United Nations in December 1982.
So far it has been ratified by 63
countries (including Bolivia, which
has no coastline), but remarkable
though it may seem by none of the
world's great maritime powers. Be
that as it may, the treaty has no pro¬
visions covering the construction of
floating or underwater cities.
