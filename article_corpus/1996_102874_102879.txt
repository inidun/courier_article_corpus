I There are some things I cannot talk
I about; they are too painful for me and
even remembering them overwhelms me. But
at the same time they are like a scream that is
locked in my throat and wants to come out;
by staying pent up inside me it wounds me
even more. Perhaps I shall be able to talk about
these things, in one way or another.
To talk under torture is "to collaborate with
the enemy". But how can you not talk, when
they put you through the mill?
The footsteps come closer, ever closer.
They touch me on the shoulder and whisper in
my ear: "Let's go!" They help me to get up.
Hell	 I take off all my clothes. They stretch
me out on a metal bedstead covered with a thin
foam mattress, fasten an electric wire to my
toes, another around my penis, another around
my fingers. At this moment, the torturers
seem big and you end up by thinking that they
know everything, that it is impossible to trick
them.
You let it happen, what does it matter now
whether torture, rape or killing is allowed or
not? The time for words is over. There's no
point in saying, "It's scandalous". It's not a
scandal. It's something that exists. It's happening.
What it means to be silent
under torture
I catch myself thinking that it would be
better if they were to kill me. Now I couldn't
care less when one of them pretends to exe¬
cute me. Why go on suffering?
This is the moment they are waiting for.
But it is a moment that belongs to the victim. It
is the victim who holds the key to the situa¬
tion and decides whether to talk or not to talk.
Why not talk?
Under torture, the idea of death seems to me
the most natural thing in the world. I have lost
the tragic sense that normally accompanies
death. The moment arrives when they come to
to kill us and when they find us prepared.
We can die under torture, without talking,
to cover up for our comrades and brothers
and also our political work which will survive
us, but all that has nothing to do with heroism.
We die because we have reached the point
where death has ceased to matter.
We refuse to talk, because that is the only
way of saving something of ourselves. Those
who believe in heroic speeches are wrong
with the best will in the world. It's something
much smaller, more mundane, more confused,
more human and ultimately more beautiful

giving a meaning to our life by giving a meaning
to our imminent death.
. . . Behind the window, near the inter¬
phone, he was looking at his woman friend. It
was visiting day at the prison. She recognized
him. Deep in his eyes she again saw light,
strength and love. Pedro had survived. He had
not talked under torture; he could talk to her.
The point of no return
There is a time when a man can decide to be
reduced to nothingness. He cracks up under
torture. "I've had enough. I'll say and do all
you want!" The point of no return is reached.
El Negro betrayed his own wife. He was
crazy about her. Brought face to face with her
in the torture chamber, he repeated his accu¬
sations against her. He wanted the torture to
stop.
A man "who has talked" feels crushed,
incredulous, a stranger to himself. Demolished.
How and why should he go on living? He is no
longer a man who could say to his wife: "I love
you." To love someone you have to be
someone yourself. By betraying others, he has
betrayed himself. In his own eyes he has ceased
to exist. By saving his life he has lost everything.

Roberto Juarroz (1925-1995), Argentine poet
I remember El Negro as a shadow haunting
the corridors of Resistencia prison. Trembling,
bowed head. ... A piece of flotsam. When he
spoke he merely groaned. We tried to give him
a little human warmth: he was not there, he
was at grips with unbearable anguish. We all
shared the chill that gripped El Negro.
