V
iolence against women during arm e d
c o n flict is nothing new. With other
innocent victims—children and the
elderly—they have always been on the front
lines of wa rs of all kinds—religious wa rs ,c i v i l
wa rs or world wa rs.H i s t o rians have descri b e d
h ow soldiers have raped women to intimi-
d ate civilian populat i o n s. But during this
c e n t u ry the character of war has changed
and this practice has become even more
w i d e s p r e a d .Where soldiers used to target
other soldiers , the goal now is often to kill or
t e rr o rize civilians.Va rious forms of sexual
assault may occur during fighting or in
conjunction with looting and other cri m e s
by armed forces ove rrunning an area. S o l-
d i e rs may publicly rape women and detain
them in special camps or brothels, w h e r e
they can be tort u r e d , raped and made pre-
g n a n t .
Overwhelming evidence
There have been many examples of this
kind of violence in the last decade. A f t e r
Iraq invaded Ku wait in 1990, it was esti-
m ated that at least 5,000 Ku waiti wo m e n
were raped by Iraqi soldiers during the
o c c u p at i o n . Two ye a rs lat e r , s h o c k i n g
r e p o rts were published around the wo r l d
about the use of rape and forced pregnan-
cy as tools of “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia.
In 1994 and 1995, s t o ries of sexual violen-
ce in war again appeared in the wo r l d
m e d i a , this time from Rwa n d a . O n e
United Nations report estimated that as
m a ny as 500,000 women and girls suffered
b rutal forms of sexual violence, i n c l u d i n g
gang-rape and sexual mutilat i o n , a f t e r
Long a taboo subject,
sexual violence is only now
coming to be recognized as
a crime against humanity.
Will the proposed new
International Criminal Court
be able to bring the guilty
to book?

When women are the 

which many of them were killed. I n
A l g e ri a , the women of entire villages have
been raped and killed. The gove rn m e n t
e s t i m ates that about 1,600 girls and yo u n g
women have been kidnapped to become
sexual slaves by roving bands from arm e d
Islamic gr o u p s.
While men may also be victims of rape
and sexual mutilation during arm e d
c o n fli c t , it is widely recognized that sexual
violence is usually targeted specifically at
wo m e n . But women are often reluctant to
r e p o rt rape, either because they fear the
social stigma or because they feel that it is
useless to report the crime in conditions of
chaos and societal breakdow n . The extent
of sexual violence often becomes evident
long after the world knows the extent of


other cri m e s. S t o ries of sexual violence in
R wanda emerged approx i m ately nine
months after the genocide had ended, a s
women began bearing babies conceived as
a result of rape. According to estimates of
the Rwandan National Po p u l ation Office,
women who surv i ved the genocide gave
b i rth to between 2,000 and 5,000 children,
who are often known as “e n fants des mau-
vais souve n i rs”(children of bad memori e s ) .
The same pat t e rn is true of the form e r
Yu g o s l av i a , where women were raped until
they were pregnant and then held until they
were close to term . In 1993, it was estima-
ted that between 1,000 and 2,000 wo m e n
became pregnant as a result of rape.

groups and then governments around the
world to condemn these acts and call for
an international tribunal to hold the per-
petrators accountable. Following several
Security Council resolutions condemning
the massive , organized and systemat i c
detention and rape of wo m e n , t h e
International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia was founded in 1993.
From the beginning, one of the purposes
of setting up this court was to prosecute
crimes of sexual violence. The tribunal
was the first to recognize crimes of sexual
violence as war crimes and as “grave
breaches” imposing on states the duty to
search for the allegedly guilty persons and
bring them to court or extradite them for
prosecution elsewhere.This is something
new. Sexual violence is not explicitly cal-
led a grave breach in the main law of war
documents—the 1949 Geneva
Conventions and their 1977 Additional
Protocols. However, it is generally accep-
ted that these crimes meet the criteria of
“willfully causing gr e at suffering or
serious injury to body or health” and
“torture or inhuman treatment”.
Sexual violence can also be regarded as
a crime against humanity, like murder,
e x t e rm i n at i o n , e n s l ave m e n t , d e p o rt at i o n ,
i m p ri s o n m e n t , t o rture or pers e c u t i o n ,
depending on the surrounding circum-
s t a n c e s. H i s t o rically howe ve r , c rimes of
sexual violence have rarely been prosecu-
ted under any of these headings. O n e
exception was the To k yo World War II tri a l ,
where several Japanese officers were char-
ged and held liable for the rape of 20,000
women during the occupation of Nanking
(China) in 1937.
D u ring the prosecutions of top-ranking
World War II criminals at Nuremberg, r a p e
was not listed as a crime against humanity.
H owe ve r , it was prosecuted in the nat i o n a l
t rials that followed Nuremberg, and it is
n ow accepted as belonging on the list.
Both the Yu g o s l av and Rwandan Tri bu n a l s
explicitly include it in the definition of
c rimes against humanity.
The experience of these two tri bu n a l s
has demonstrated both the progress that
has been made and the difficulties that have
a risen in prosecuting crimes of sexual vio-
l e n c e .To dat e , t wenty-six people have been
charged with committing sexual at r o c i t i e s ;
h owe ve r , m a ny of them are still at large. I n
June 1996, the first indictment dealing
solely with sexual violence and enslave m e n t
c rimes was issued. It alleges that , in 1992
when the city of Foca (south-east of
S a r a j e vo) was ove rrun by Serb forces,
Muslim and Croat women were detained
and repeatedly beaten and raped. Only one
of the eight men accused in this indictment
t u rned himself in to the tri bu n a l .
Few pro s e c u t i o n s
U n f o rt u n at e l y, the Rwanda Tri bunal has
publicly charged only two people with
c rimes of sexual violence, both in 1997—
three ye a rs after it was founded. The firs t
was Je a n - Paul A k aye s u , the mayor of Ta b a
c o m m u n e . E ven though there had been
r e p o rts of widespread sexual abuse in
Ta b a , he was not initially charged with
these cri m e s , and it was not until witnesses
t e s t i fied about rape, and a coalition of
human rights and wo m e n ’s organizat i o n s
submitted a bri e f, t h at the prosecutor
amended the indictment to add sexual vio-
lence to charges of genocide, c ri m e s
against humanity and war cri m e s. This is
the first case before the Rwandan Tri bu n a l
in which someone is specifically charged
with crimes of sexual violence, and the firs t
to address the issue of a leader’s responsi-
bility for encouraging or allowing others to
commit rape.
G ove rnments are now in the process of
finalizing the statute of a perm a n e n t
I n t e rn ational Criminal Court . This court
will be able to build on the advances of the
Yu g o s l av and Rwandan Tri bunals and will
hopefully reve rse the historical trend. ■
