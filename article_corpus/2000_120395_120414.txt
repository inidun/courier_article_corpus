You spent three weeks in Kosovo in October
1999 documenting damage to cultural
heritage. What were your main findings?
K o s ovo ’s 600-year-old Islamic heri t a g e
suffered large-scale deva s t ation during the
“ethnic cleansing”o p e r at i o n s.More than one
third of the regi o n ’s 600 mosques were des-
t r oyed or seriously damaged.A standard tech-
nique was to pack the base of the minaret with
e x p l o s i ves so that the stone spire would col-
lapse onto the building and smash the dome.
We found racist anti-Albanian and anti-Isla-
mic gr a fitti inside,Korans with pages ri p p e d
out and smeared with feces, and crosses car-
ved into the mosques’ m i h ra b s [ p r ayer niche].
Valuable collections of Islamic manuscri p t s
were bu rn e d .The 500-year-old mosque and
h i s t o ric centre of Vu c i t rn was set afire and
completely bulldozed by Serb paramilitari e s.
Of Kosovo ’s four we l l - p r e s e rved Ottoman-
era urban centres,only one, P ri z r e n ,e s c a p e d
such deva s t at i o n .
The other gr e at loss are the k u l l a s —s t o n e
mansions typical of Albanian residential archi-
t e c t u r e .They tended to belong to the more
prominent Albanian families and had been in
the same hands for 150-200 ye a rs. As such
they were filled with art i facts and documents
and were regarded as symbols of A l b a n i a n
culture in Kosovo. Barely ten per cent of the
r e gi o n ’s 500 k u l l a s s u rv i ved the wa r.All this
d e m o n s t r ates that the damage was clearly not
c o l l at e r a l . It was ve ry intentional.
There have been allegations that the Serbian
heritage also suffered damage.
As soon as the conflict broke out, B e l gr a-
d e ’s Inform ation Ministry and several conser-
vation institutes claimed that NATO was deli-
b e r ately targetting Serbian pat rimonial sites.
We visited each one of the sites for which
damage was claimed and found these allega-
tions to be unsubstantiat e d .At the end of the
wa r ,K F O R1 troops were stationed to guard
the most famous monasteries and churches.
H owe ve r ,m a ny village churches became easy
targets for revenge by returning Kosovar vil-
l a g e rs.A majority of the attacked bu i l d i n g s
were built in the 20th century, and quite a
large number during the 1990s.These we r e
seen as political monuments and were espe-
cially targetted. Since the end of the wa r ,a s
far as we can tell, about 40 churches have been
badly damaged and 40 vandalized to some
e x t e n t .While most were modern , about a
dozen were genuinely ancient stru c t u r e s.
Where do reconstruction efforts stand? 
The buildings being restored are those that
can be fixed quickly, which means concrete
frame modern bu i l d i n g s. U n f o rt u n at e l y, t h e
UN agencies in charge in Kosovo don’t have
much of a budget for reconstruction projects
and the fate of cultural heritage has not ranked
ve ry high among the intern ational commu-
n i t y ’s concern s. Our Kosovo Cultural Heri-
tage Project recently obtained funding for the
r e c o n s t ruction of three damaged histori c a l
monuments in Kosovo2. Another initiat i ve
enabled the Institute for the Protection of
Monuments of Kosovo to clear the ru b b l e ,
stabilize and cover with plastic sheeting close
to 100 of the most endangered histori c
bu i l d i n g s. In the case of the mosques, S a u d i -
based Islamic aid agencies are bri n ging their
own sectarian agenda to reconstru c t i o n , as it
happened in Bosnia.They notably frown on
all decorations and consider some practices
common elsewhere in the Muslim world to
be ve r ging on the idolat r o u s.
Are the Albanians intent on rebuilding their
heritage at this point? 
There is a tremendous desire to rebu i l d
their own heri t a g e . People are immensely
d e voted to it and that ’s why it was targetted.
But there is a lack of funding, and above all,
a lack of expert i s e .Through our project, we
hope to establish methodologies adapted to
the local context and foster links between local
and foreign professionals. ■

Kosovo’s cultural heritage was deliberately targetted during the 1998-1999 conflict says

The ruins of the kulla of Jashar Pasha, burned in May 1999 by Serbs.
1. KFOR is a NATO-lead international force
responsible for establishing a security presence in
Kosovo under a UN mandate.
2. The restoration and training project will be
carried out in association with a Boston-based
NGO, Friends of Bosnia, and local authorities
involved in cultural heritage in Kosovo.
