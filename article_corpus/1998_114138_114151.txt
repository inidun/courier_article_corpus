It is time to debunk the myths surrounding
California’s large and growing Latino immigrant
population
¡Buenos días California!

C a l i f o rn i a : land of Hollywo o d , Silicon Va l l e y,
Disneyland and movie stars—this has been the
popular conception of the names and symbols
a s s o c i ated with the US’s largest state for the better
p a rt of this century.Yet there is another Californ i a
which co-exists alongside this glamorous and
popular image. Cities like Monterey Pa r k ,
Huntington Park and areas like East Los Angeles are
the new ports of entry for immigrants from Mexico,
Central A m e ri c a ,Asia and the rest of the wo r l d .T h i s
less glamorous aspect of California is not as we l l
k n ow n . N o n e t h e l e s s , the ways in which Californ i a
adapts and adjusts to being the first home of new
i m m i grants will be critical in the twe n t y - first century
for the stat e ’s future,and perhaps for the future of the
United Stat e s. Most notably,C a l i f o rnia will gi ve the
c o u n t ry a glimpse of the future as it moves from a bi-
racial (black/white) understanding of minority issues
to a multi-cultural pers p e c t i ve that encompasses
predominantly Latinos as well as Asian A m e ri c a n s
and A f rican A m e ri c a n s.
H i s t o ri c a l l y, the United States has defin e d
m i n o rity group concerns in terms of a black and
white dynamic. Yet in California the black
community is actually the smallest of the minority
populations. Latinos and Asians,both native-born
and immigr a n t , are the largest minorities in the
s t at e . And this trend will continue. The Lat i n o
p o p u l at i o n1 in California is gr owing ten times as
fast as the A f rican A m e rican community and twice
as fast as the Asian American community.
Consider these additional fa c t s. C a l i f o rn i a ,w i t h
27 million inhabitants, is the USA’s most populous
s t ate and has the wo r l d ’s seventh largest economy.I t
is also a state with incredible ethnic dive rs i t y : in 1990
there were over six million foreign-born immigr a n t s
living there. The number of Mexican immigr a n t s
living in Los Angeles County could make it the third
largest Mexican metropolitan area outside of
M e x i c o. M o r e ove r , there are over half a million
S a l va d o rians and Guatemalans also living in
s o u t h e rn Californ i a . According to the US Census,
there are also over two million immigrants from
Asian countries living in the stat e , the largest of them,
the Chinese and Korean, n u m b e ring over 200,000
e a c h .

These immigrants and nat i ve - b o rn A m e ri c a n s
p r ovide a richness of cultures that are blending and
coalescing in ways that are not yet fully clear. Fo r

e n t r e p r e n e u rial vitality of California is constantly
e n riched thanks to a blend of Asian capital and the
large Latin A m e rican labour force.
Yet the presence and magnitude of such a large
i m m i grant population has created a backlash
among native California voters,most of whom are
neither of Latin A m e rican nor Asian descent. I n
the 1990s, C a l i f o rnia has had statewide votes on
i n i t i at i ves that would deny schooling and other
social services to children of undocumented
i m m i gr a n t s. Most recently, the state passed an
initiative that would eliminate bilingual education
for immigrant children.
The basis for these initiat i ves has been largely
d ri ven by the negat i ve stereotypes surr o u n d i n g
i m m i grants from Mexico and Central A m e ri c a .
According to these stereotypes,Mexican and Central
A m e rican immigrants are predominantly illegal, d o
not fully part i c i p ate in the labour force and are not
adapting to A m e rican culture by not learning English.
The facts present a different picture. A c c o r d i n g
to the US Immigr ation and Nat u r a l i z ation Serv i c e ,
immigrants from Latin America have constituted
over 30 per cent of the entire number of immigr a n t s
to the United States in the past three decades.The
p ri m a ry destination of these legal immigrants from
Mexico and Central A m e rica  has been Californ i a .
For example, close to 50 per cent of all Mexican
i m m i grants list California as their destinat i o n .
When one looks at the percentage of immigrants
p a rt i c i p ating in the labour force, the facts also
contradict the stereotypes. Mexican and Central
A m e rican immigrants have labour force
p a rt i c i p ation (62 per cent) that equals, if not

e x c e e d s ,t h at of the white non-Hispanic labour force
and far exceeds that of native African Americans. A
number of other facts help explain the Lat i n o
immigrant community in California.
Firstly, it is a complex community. The city of
Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spain. Some
L at i n o s , albeit a small minority in Californ i a , c a n
trace their ancestry in the United States back over
many generations. Most of California’s Latinos are
recent immigrants,however. Over half of the state’s
Latino adult population is foreign-born.
S e c o n d l y, L atino communities are composed of
both nat i ve - b o rn and immigr a n t s , but outside
o b s e rve rs tend to confuse the two gr o u p s.
S p e c i fic a l l y, outside observe rs look at an ethnic
e n c l ave like East Los Angeles and see a profusion
of both written and spoken Spanish. Some conclude
from their observations that Latino immigr a n t s
don’t want to learn English.Again,the facts show a
different picture.The English language acquisition
r ate among Hispanic immigrants is roughly the same
as those of other US immigrant gr o u p s. A m o n g
Mexican Americans born in the United States, 94
per cent are English profic i e n t ; amongst the foreign-
b o rn only 51 per cent are English profic i e n t . In fa c t ,
one out of eve ry three Latino immigrants is
monolingual in English.
Putting down
roots
The explanation for this is simple. M a ny legal
i m m i grants come to the US as children, a n d
although they speak Spanish in the home, they speak
English in school and at wo r k .As time goes on, t h e y
gradually lose profic i e n cy in their nat i ve language
and come to rely on their acquired language. T h e
other two-thirds of the immigrants list their language
proficiencies in the following ways: one-third were
monolingual in Spanish and one-third we r e
b i l i n g u a l . By the third generat i o n , H i s p a n i c
immigrants are overwhelmingly fluent in English.
Outsiders often tend to think that Mexican and
Central A m e rican immigrants are only interested in
s aving enough money to go back home. Once again,
the facts dispute this popular perception.When legal
immigrants were asked in a national survey if they
planned to stay in the US, an overwhelming nine
out of ten said ye s ; 98 per cent of Latino immigr a n t s
feel life is better in the US than it is back in their
home country.4 Of cours e , some do return home;
some also send back money orders to their relat i ve s.
But as time goes by, the roots become deeper,their
attachments more firm . In short , they follow the
same patterns as earlier European immigrants.
The future of Mexican, Central American and
other Latin Americans in California is clear. Given
their numbers, and the larger family sizes of Latin
i m m i gr a n t s , this population will continue to increase
dramatically. One generation from now, in the year
2020, there will be as many Californians of Latino
descent (25 million) as there are Latinos living in
the entire US at present. C a l i f o rn i a ’s future is
i n e x t ricably linked with that of its large Lat i n o
