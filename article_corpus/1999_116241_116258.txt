Cracking the code
o f a r t’s allure

‘If a Martian ethologist were to land on
earth and watch us humans,he would
be puzzled by many aspects of human
nature, but surely art—our propensity to
c r e ate and enjoy paintings and sculpture—
would be among the most puzzling.What
biological function could this mysterious
behaviour possibly serve?
“Cultural fa c t o rs undoubtedly influ e n c e
what kind of art a person enjoys. But,even
if beauty is largely in the eye of the beholder,
might there be some sort of universal rule
or ‘deep structure’, underlying all artistic
experience?”
V i l ayanur S. R a m a c h a n d r a n ,Director of
the Center for Brain and Cognition at the
U n i ve rsity of California at San Diego, h a s
made a bold and controve rsial attempt to
a n swer these intriguing questions by
proposing a new scientific theory of art .T h e
t h e o ry explains many familiar experi e n c e s ,
such as why a cartoon squiggle can evoke a
we l l - k n own face more quickly than a full
colour photogr a p h , and why many men fin d
the hour-glass figure of Marilyn Monroe sexy.
Professor Ramachandran’s theory
addresses three questions: (a) W h at are the
“ rules of art ”t h at make something pretty? (b)
W hy did these rules evo l ve and have the form
t h at they do? (c) W h at is the brain circuitry
i nvo l ved? Previous theories of art have looked
at one or two of these questions,but this is the
first time all three have been tackled together.
With his colleague William Hirs t e i n ,
Ramachandran proposes a list of “Eight law s
of artistic experience . . . t h at artists either
consciously or unconsciously deploy to opti-
mally titillate the visual areas of the brain,” i n
p a rticular that part of the brain known as the
limbic system. Of the eight (see box page
4 2 ) , three seem to be especially signific a n t : a
p s y c h o l o gical phenomenon called the “ p e a k
shift effect”; the principle of “ gr o u p i n g ” ;a n d
the benefit of focusing on a single visual cue.1
The ‘peak shift effect’
The “peak shift effect” is a we l l - k n ow n
p rinciple in animal discri m i n ation learn i n g .
For example, if a rat is taught to discri m i n at e
a square from a rectangle and rewarded for the
r e c t a n g l e , it will soon learn to respond more
frequently to the rectangle. M o r e ove r , if the
r at is trained with a prototype rectangle of, s ay,
aspect ratio 3:2, it will respond even more
p o s i t i vely to a longer and skinnier fig u r e — s ay,
of aspect ratio 4:1.This curious result implies
t h at what the rat is learning to value is not a
p a rticular rectangle but a ru l e : rectangles are
better than squares. So the gr e ater the rat i o
b e t ween the long and the short sides, i . e .t h e
less square-like it is, the “ b e t t e r ” the rectangle
is in the rat ’s eye s. This is the “peak shift
e f f e c t ” .Ramachandran argues that this pri n-
ciple holds the key for understanding the
e vo c at i veness of much of visual art .
H ow does the peak shift effect relate to
human pat t e rn recognition and aesthetic pre-
ference? Consider the way in which a skilled
c a rtoonist produces a cari c ature of a fa m o u s
fa c e , s ay the late U. S . President Richard
N i x o n ’s. W h at a cartoonist does (uncons-
ciously) is to take the ave ra ge of all fa c e s ,s u b-
tract it from Nixon’s face (to get the difference
b e t ween Nixon’s face and all others) and
then a m p l i f y the differences to produce a cari-
c at u r e .The final result, of cours e , is a draw i n g
t h at is even more Nixon-like than the ori-
gi n a l .The artist has amplified the differences
t h at characterize Nixon’s face in the same
way that an even skinnier rectangle is an
a m p l i fied ve rsion of the ori ginal prototype
t h at the rat is exposed to.Hence Ramachan-
d r a n ’s aphorism that “All art is cari c at u r e ” .
(This is not literally tru e , as he admits, but it
applies surp risingly often.) In other wo r d s ,
w h at the artist tries to do is not only capture
the essence of something but amplify it in
order to activate neural mechanisms more
p owerfully than the ori ginal object.
Look at the Chola bronze—the accen-
t u ated hips and bust of the Goddess Pa rvat i
( F i g . 1) and you will see at once that this is
essentially a caricature of the female form.
Here the artist has chosen to amplify the
“very essence” (called the rasa by Hindu
artists) of being feminine, by moving the
image abnormally far toward the feminine
end of the female/male spectru m . T h e
a rtistic amplific ation produces a “super sti-
mulus” to which, Ramachandran conjec-
t u r e s ,c e rtain brain circuits respond.A rt i s t s
may also try to evoke a strong direct emo-
tional response by exploiting the peak shift
effect along dimensions other than form.
For instance,a Boucher, aVan Gogh, or a
Monet may be thought of as a cari c ature in
“colour space”.
Perceptual grouping
and binding
A second basic principle suggested by
Ramachandran is “ gr o u p i n g ” (or binding).
The way this works can be illustrated by the
D a l m atian dog picture shown in Fig. 2 .T h i s
is seen initially as a random jumble of
s p l o t c h e s. The number of potential gr o u-
pings of these splotches is infin i t e , but once
the dog is seen,your visual system links only
a subset of these splotches together and it is
impossible n o t to “hold on” to this group of
linked splotches. I n d e e d , the discove ry of

the dog and the linking of the dog-releva n t
splotches generates a pleasant “ a h a ”s e n s a-
t i o n . In “colour space” the equivalent of this
would be we a ring a blue scarf with red flo-
we rs if you are we a ring a red skirt ; the per-
ceptual grouping of the red flowe rs and yo u r
red skirt is aesthetically pleasing. A rt i s t s
u n d e rstand the pleasure gi ven by such effects.
The evo l u t i o n a ry value of such gr o u p i n g
of stimuli to pick out objects is obvious: it
makes the detection of both prey and pre-
dators much easier. But how is such grou-
ping achieved? The key idea is as follows.
G i ven the brain’s limited at t e n t i o n a l
resources and shortage of neural space for
competing representat i o n s , e ve ry stage in the
processing of visual information offers an
opportunity to generate a signal that says,
“Look, here is a clue to something poten-
tially object-like!” Pa rtial solutions or
conjectures to perceptual problems are fed
back from every level in the hierarchy to
e ve ry earlier module to impose a small bias
in processing, allowing the final percept to
emerge from such progressive “bootstrap-
ping”.
C o n s i s t e n cy between partial high-leve l
“ hy p o t h e s e s ” and earlier low - l e vel ensembles
g e n e r ates a pleasant sensat i o n — e . g . t h e
D a l m atian dog “ hy p o t h e s i s ” encourages the
binding of corresponding splotches which,
in turn ,f u rther consolidate the “ d o g - l i k e ”
n ature of the final percept and we feel good
when it all finally clicks in place.And what
the artist tries to do is to tease the system with
as many of these “potential object” clues as
possible—an idea that would help explain
w hy grouping and “perceptual problem-
s o l v i n g ” are both frequently exploited by
a rtists and fashion designers.
Isolating a visual signal
The third principle (in addition to peak
shift and binding) emphasized by
Ramachandran is the need to i s o l at e a single
visual modality before you amplify the signal
in that modality.The brain’s ability to do this
explains why an outline drawing or sketch is
more effective as “ a rt ” than a full colour
p h o t o gr a p h .Consider a full-colour illustrat i o n
of Nixon, with depth, s h a d i n g, skin tones and
b l e m i s h e s ,e t c.W h at is unique about Nixon
is the form of his face (as amplified by the
c a ri c at u r e ) , but the skin tone—even though
it makes the picture more human-like—
d o e s n ’t contri bute to making him “ N i x o n -
l i k e ” and therefore actually detracts from the
e f fic a cy of the form cues.This explains why
one not only “gets away ” with just using
outlines—they are actually more effective than
a full-colour half-tone photo, despite its hav i n g
more inform at i o n . Hence the aphori s m
“more is less” in A rt .
Additional evidence for this view comes
from the “ s avant syndrome”—autistic chil-
dren who are “ r e t a r d e d ” and yet produce
beautiful draw i n g s.The animal drawings of the
e i g h t - year-old artist Nadia, for instance, a r e
almost as aesthetically pleasing as those of
Leonardo da Vinci (Fig. 4 ) . R a m a c h a n d r a n
argues that this is because the fundamental
disorder in autism is a distortion of the
“salience landscape”; s avants shut out many
i m p o rtant sensory channels, thereby allo-
wing them to deploy all their at t e n t i o n a l
resources on a single channel.
‘Lie detector’ testing
Ramachandran believes that the “peak
shift principle” can be tested directly. The
method would employ skin conductance
response (SCR), the technology used in
“lie detectors”. The size of the SCR is a
direct measure of the amount of limbic
(emotional) activation produced by an
i m a g e . It is a better measure, as it turn s
o u t , than simply asking someone how much
emotion they feel about what they are loo-

of the term “ p r e t t y ” . If used at all by seri o u s
a rt cri t i c s , the word damns with faint praise.
Prettiness is not seen as a synonym for
b e a u t y, but as a shallow impostor.Yet Rama-
chandran uses it without irony as a positive
at t ri bu t e .This one piece of unfort u n ate ter-
minology might be forgi ve n , but other ele-
ments in his work are all of a piece with it.
First, there is the heavy reliance on the
female form and upon the erotic in his
e x a m p l e s. Then he seems to equat e
“ a r o u s a l ” (as measured by SCR) with a
p o s i t i ve aesthetic response—an assump-
tion felt by critics to presuppose the reduc-
tionist case he is trying to prove . Ta k e n
together,these points seem to some critics
to confuse pornography with high art.
The “science of art ” has also been
attacked from the scientific side, on the
grounds that its proponents have not ye t
conducted any serious empirical tests of their
i d e a s. At best they have offered a manifesto
for a research programme and made some
suggestions for possible lines of inve s t i g at i o n .
E ven then, it has been pointed out that the
n a rr ow range of examples used hardly justifie s
the lofty claims to be dealing with the whole of
a rt , let alone to have uncovered the “ l aws of
aesthetic experi e n c e ” . Nor has hitching his
b a n d wagon to the Buddhist train, b y

B u d d h a ’s eightfold noble path wo n
Ramachandran any fri e n d s , though to be fa i r ,
he admits himself that this is a slightly
whimsical associat i o n .
C riticism has centred on the lack of
p r o p o rtion between the narr ow approach to
art taken by Ramachandran and the gran-
diloquent claims he makes for his theory —
a l t h o u g h , as he admits, he initially pro-
posed it “in a playful spirit”. But the very
audacity with which its author propounds

more of it in the coming months. n
king at , because the verbal response is
fil t e r e d , e d i t e d , and sometimes censored
by the conscious mind. M e a s u ring SCR
a l l ows direct access to “ u n c o n s c i o u s ”
mental processes.
The experiment would compare a sub-
j e c t ’s SCR to a c a ri c at u r e o f, s ay, Einstein or
N i x o n , to his SCR to a p h o t o of the same indi-
v i d u a l s. I n t u i t i ve l y, one would expect the
photo to produce a large SCR because it is
rich in cues and therefore excites more
m o d u l e s. If one found, p a r a d ox i c a l l y, t h at the
c a ri c ature actually elicited a larger SCR, t h i s
would provide evidence for the operation of
the peak shift effect—the artist would have
unconsciously produced a super stimulus.
Critical responses
Ramachandran says that one could also
compare the magnitude of an SCR to cari-
catures of women (or indeed, to a Chola
bronze nude or a Picasso nude) with the
SCR to a photo of a nude wo m a n . It is
c o n c e i vable that the subject might claim
to find the photo more at t r a c t i ve at a
conscious leve l , while regi s t e ring a large
“unconscious aesthetic response”—in the
f o rm of a larger SCR—to the artistic repre-
sentation.That art taps into the “subcons-
c i o u s ” is not a new idea, but our SCR mea-
surements may be the first attempt to test
such a notion experimentally.
Not surp ri s i n g l y, R a m a c h a n d r a n ’s
attempt to reduce aesthetic experience to a
set of physical or neurobiological laws has
already met with stout cri t i c i s m .A symptom
of trouble to come has been seen in his use
