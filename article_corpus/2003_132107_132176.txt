Academic freedom cannot be 
taken for granted. Students 
and teaching staff in several 
countries are still being gagged.

0, 2003. As students turn up for 
lectures, they find the gates of 
their university locked. Following the arrest of 
Aung San Suu Kyi on May 30 the government had 
simply closed the University of Myanmar, in order 
to prevent any show of support for the Nobel 
Peace Prize winner. 
A few days later, in Iran, students from 
Tehran University were woken up with a start 
and beaten up by government supporters. 
This surprise attack left 50 students injured, 
many of whom had taken part in anti-government 
demonstrations that shook the country for 
several weeks. 
And students are not the only ones to pay the 
price for this form of government censorship.

Professors are also targeted. In March this year, 
an Egyptian court finally acquitted Dr. Saad Eddin 
Ibrahim, a human rights activist and professor 
of sociology at the American University in Cairo. 
In May 2001 he had been sentenced to seven 
years in prison on charges of illegal financing and 
divulging false information abroad. 
All these cases, and many others like it, have 
been recorded by NEAR (Network for Education 
and Academic Rights) and can be found on 
their website (www.nearinternational.org). 
This monitoring network, set up in 2001 with 
assistance from UNESCO, brings together over 
40 NGOs involved in the fight for academic 
freedom. Using information that appears in the 
press or which is collected on the ground by 
the member organizations, it sounds the alarm 
when necessary. The aim is to draw attention 
to countries that abuse academic freedoms 
affecting both teachers and students and ranging 
from interference with freedom of speech to 
imprisonment and disappearances. 
DEFENDING THE RIGHTS 
OF TEACHERS 
While there are no specific texts on the rights 
of students, professors can refer to the UNESCO 
Recommendations of 1997 on the status of 
teachers in higher education (see box p. 28). This 
text stresses that teachers must be able to enjoy 
the freedom to teach and to discuss, to carry out 
research and to publish the results. And they must 
also be allowed to freely express their opinions 
about the institution for which they work. 
“These are very important points because a 
teacher or a university must be able to question 
what is accepted and known about a certain era. 
The progress of knowledge answers to a higher 
calling than the interests of the State,” says 
Andris Barblan, special advisor to the European 
University of Geneva.

Academic freedom 
was high on the agenda 
of the World Conference 
on Higher Education + 
b, which took place at 
UNESCO headquarters 
last June 23-25. More than 
400 participants from 120 
countries attended the 
conference, which took 
stock of progress made 
towards the goals set at the 
World Conference on Higher 
Education held in Paris in 
1998. 
All agreed that at no 
time in human history 
has the welfare of nations 
depended so directly on the 
quality and outreach of their 
higher education systems 
and institutions, and that, 
to a large extent, the quality 
and outreach required 
could only be achieved if 
academic freedom - of both 
staff and students - was 
respected. 
“The changes sweeping 
through higher education 
may, in some circumstances, 
threaten the very practice 
of academic freedom, 
university autonomy, 
and the independence of 
research,” warned UNESCO 
Director-General Koichiro 
Matsuura in his opening 
speech. “And please note 
that, while these principles 
and values are important in 
their own right, there may 
be other considerations 
to bear in mind too. For 
example, curtailments of 
academic freedom may 
induce brain drain or cause 
an exodus from certain 
fields of inquiry.”

However, many countries pay these freedoms 
lip service only. Since the start of the year, NEAR 
has recorded 37 cases of violations. The figures 
show a slight increase on previous years. “But 
that is probably because the network is better 
established and more cases are being reported,” 
says John Akker, NEAR’s Executive Director. 
“All these examples show that many regimes 
still consider universities as potential centres of 
unrest,” he adds. 
This is especially the case in Africa, where 
controls over the content of the syllabus.” 
There are also less direct methods of repressing 
lecturers whose opinions are considered too 
‘independent’. Lectures can be cancelled 
arbitrarily, promotions can be systematically 
refused and staff excluded from decision-making

pressure is often put on teachers and students. 
“Most countries do this,” says Adebayo Olukoshi, 
the Executive Secretary of the Council for the 
Development of Social Science Research in Africa 
(CODESRIA). “It is easier to gag the press than 
teachers and students. Universities therefore 
often seem to be the last bastion of freedom of 
expression, which is why they are so closely 
observed. In extreme cases, this can even go as 
far as teachers being detained or extremely strict

. ) “Higher-education teaching personnel 
should not be forced to instruct against their 
own best knowledge and conscience,” states 
the UNESCO Recommendation Concerning 
the Status of Higher-Education Teaching 
Personnel, adopted in 1997". In its articles 
25 to 32, the Recommendation gives a fairly 
broad definition of academic freedom. Higher- 
education personnel, it says, “should enjoy those 
internationally recognized civil, political, social 
and cultural rights applicable to all citizens.” 
D But it also recognizes rights specific 
to the profession. These include the freedom 
to teach “without any interference,” to carry 
out research and to publish the results, 
freedom from institutional censorship and 
the “freedom to participate in professional or 
representative academic bodies.” The UNESCO 
Recommendation also recognizes the freedom 
“to express freely their opinion about the 
institution or system in which they work.” All 
higher-education teaching personnel, it says, 
“should have the right to fulfil their functions 
without discrimination of any kind and without 
fear of repression by the state or any other 
source.” In cases “of gross violation of their 
rights,” the text goes on, “higher-education 
teaching personnel should have the right to 
appeal to the relevant national, regional or 
international bodies such as the agencies of the 
United Nations, and organizations representing 
higher-education teaching personnel should 
extend full support in such cases.”

Cairo, January 2001 - Egyptian -US 
human rights activist Saad Eddin 
Ibrahim (left) speaks to one of his 
lawyers at Cairo’s High Court 
bodies. On a continent where universities 
are financed mainly from public funds, 
money is another effective way of applying 
pressure. “Reducing a university’s funding 
by 25 percent is enough to prevent it from 
functioning normally,” explains Olukoshi. 
This is all the more true when the position of 
teachers, whose salaries — when they are paid 
at all - rarely exceed $500 a month, is already 
precarious enough. 
MONEY TALKS 
Universities in industralized countries can 
face a completely different kind of pressure. 
Private companies increasingly play a role on 
campus, financing at least part of the applied 
research. In November 1998, for example, the 
University of California at Berkeley (USA), 
struck a $25m deal with the Swiss company 
Novartis. Under the alliance, the university’s 
department of Plant and Microbial Biology 
receives grants of $5m annually for five years. 
In exchange, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant 
obtained the rights to patent discoveries 
made by the department’s researchers. Such 
agreements contribute to financing research 
and, according to the University, Novartis 
was selected as a partner “because of the 
company’s interest in safeguarding academic 
freedom”. But the aims of the companies are 
not always compatible with a university’s 
mission. “Some big companies understand 
that free research must be supported,” says 
Barblan. “But that is certainly not true in 
every case.” Students working within the 
university, but financed by private companies 
can face conflicts of loyalty. Former French 
education minister Claude Allegre! observed 
this during a visit to the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology in Boston (USA): 
“In the same research laboratory a student 
financed by a company, a pharmaceuticals 
group for example, can be working alongside a 
student financed by a rival company,” he said. 
“And they are not allowed to discuss their 
work even if (and especially if) their research 
touches on the same subjects.” Says Andris 
Barblan, “In situations like this, academic 
freedom is undeniably affected.”
