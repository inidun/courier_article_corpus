HAVOC WROUGHT
BY VANDALS
The Corcoran Gallery in Washington,
thwarted the thief who tried
to make off with this painting,
Rembrandt's
"Man with Hat Holding Scroll".
The painting, however,
was damaged slightly.
Museum restorer here works on cut
at bottom and right borders.
This Buddha at Pagan, Burma,
was the victim of man's greed.
It was completely disemboweled
by vandals in search of gold
they believed to be hidden inside.
Most of the statues
at Pagan are similarly mutilated.

In January 1962,
the famed Uffizi Gallery in »Florence
suffered its worst case
of vandalism since the war.
One morning,
twenty-five masterpieces worth
almost 82 million were discovered
slashed and damaged,
all apparently by the same
deranged individual.
Finger in photo points
to long slash mark on 15th Century
masterpiece of "Madonna Enthroned"
by Hans Memling.
Museums are now redoubling
their efforts to safeguard
their art treasures.
TO protect their works of art mus¬
eums have to be constantly on
the alert. Museums know this,
but are often short of the material
means to provide proper protection.
A lack of surveillance, an excessive
dispersion of guards and the result
may be disastrous. Works of art may
not only be left as relatively easy and
tempting targets for the thief; they
can also become the victims of van¬
dalism of all kinds. In 1914 the
splendid "Venus" of Velazquez in
the National Gallery, London, was
slashed through and through by a
suffragette who chose this way to
alert the public to the urgency of
granting women's rights. In 1959 a
mentally unstable person tried to
slash a work by Rubens, "The Fall of
the Damned", in a Munich museum.
Two years later it was the turn of
a Montreal museum to suffer at the
hands of a visitor who, in a fit of
destructive fury, damaged valuable
works by Renoir, Daumier, Fantin-La-
tour, Monticelli and Coburn. Grapho-
maniacs are not satisfied with defac¬
ing public buildings and monuments.
To protect the painting, "La Source",
by Ingres from being defaced by
these scribblers, the' Louvre in Paris
has been obliged to cover it with
glass. Even true art lovers are some¬
times guilty of minor misdemeanours.
Delicate electronic devices attached
to paintings in one museum reveal
that they are touched anything up
to 100 times a day. To add to all
these problems, there is the omni¬
present one of finance, for as yet
there are no alarm systems which
combine high efficiency with low cost.
