b oys get up and sit on makeshift stools,
which are in fact big stones that stop their
abode from blowing away on days when
the wind is strong. With his feet on the
waterlogged ground and head dow n ,e i g h t -
year-old Toky tells his story.
“This reminds me of my first night in
Ta n a . We ’d just arri ve d — my father and
mother, my three brothers and sisters and
me—when it started pouring.We slept on
the gr o u n d , under a shopfront awning with
other poor people.The next morning, my
little sister complained that people had
been groping her all night. Since then, my
family has preferred to live in a cabin like
ours, near the route-taxi station where my
father sells maize pancakes.
“But I stay here because it’s close to the
m a r k e t . Before we came to Ta n a , we live d
near A n j o z o r o b e , in the nort h , where my
father worked in the paddy fie l d s. He gave
half of the harvest to the ow n e r ,e ven though
he was the one who paid for the seedlings,f e r-
tilizer and pesticides. One day, the ow n e r
asked for two-thirds instead of half. T h at ’s
when my father decided to leave for Ta n a .”
The other boy,R a d o,has never lived in the
Hygiene goes by the board when scraps are the
only form of sustenance. Top, children rummage
through fishmongers’ waste.
Above and left, in Antanarivo’s Analakely market,
street children set up stands for traders or carry
shopping for the well-to-do.

c o u n t ry s i d e .“When I was little,we lived in one
room with electri c i t y,”he said.“But my fat h e r
drank and didn’t pay the rent. One day, we
were thrown out onto the street.”
When dawn breaks, the two boys craw l
out of the now-shapeless box .They will have
to find somewhere else to sleep before night
falls again. But this isn’t the time to be loo-
k i n g .The market is starting up and the firs t
t rucks are arriving with goods to sell. T h e
b oys have to rush off and set up stalls for five
t r a d e rs who employ them.With the pittance
they earn doing that , they can buy a meagr e
b r e a k fast at a corner stand—some tea (in
fa c t , hot water with sugar in it) and two ri c e
p a n c a k e s.When business is good, they treat
t h e m s e l ves to a cup of coffee with milk.
After that , Rado and Toky make for the
main entrance of the market, where they
mingle with a crowd of other children, a l l
waiting for the arri val of well-off ladies in
c a rs whose purchases they will offer to carry
for a small fee. Rado knows the tricks of the
t r a d e .You have to avoid the talkat i ve ones,w h o
spend hours nat t e ring to the shopkeepers ,
and the tight-fisted ones, who are always hag-
gling about the price of what they bu y.
In waste dumps, children scavenge whatever
they can find,including chunks of unused coal.
Right, the dump adjoining Anosibé market in
Antananarivo. Below, a smoking garbage dump
on the city’s outskirts, where Raoulatsh and his
friends struggle to survive. Young scavengers are
looked down upon as unclean by those who have
managed to land a menial job.


A lost g e n e r a t i o n
If there is one country where the term “ l o s t
g e n e r a t i o n ” means something, i t ’s Madagascar.
The 45% of its 14 million inhabitants who are
under 15 will confirm that. Since the time they
were born, the economy of their island, in the
Indian Ocean off the coast of Mozambique, has
steadily deteriorated.
Between 1980 and 1995, per capita income
shrank by an average 3% every year,according to
UN fig u r e s. Daily calorie intake per person has
fallen by 22% since 1970 and 34% of children
under five are malnourished. A recent study by
the country’s national statistics institute, I n s t a t ,
showed that nearly half the infants below the age
of three suffer from retarded growth—the highest
proportion in Africa—and that one child in six
dies before reaching the age of fiv e.
Education figures for the island—which,at
592,000 sq km, is the fourth largest in the world—
are just as gloomy.School attendance between the
ages of 6 and 23 nearly halved, from 60% to
3 3 % , between 1970 and 1995, and nearly three-
quarters of all schoolchildren fail to complete
primary school.
To d a y, 72% of the Malagasy live on less than
a dollar a day, despite the fact that their land
has abundant agricultural and mineral resources.
The island also has tremendous tourist poten-
tial.In 1997,the country’s foreign debt reached
$4.4 billion—120% of gross domestic product
(GDP). This disastrous economic situation is the
result of several decades of political turmoil and
administrative disorder.

Rado used to look after cars parked near
the market, which was less tiring and better
p a i d . But older children have seized control
of that and chase off any younger ones who
t ry to edge their way in. Rado also know s
there are two things he will never do again—
ru m m a ging in garbage cans and beggi n g .
“The garbage boy s ” are looked down on as
idle and dirty by the other b o ay kely, a s
M a d a g a s c a r ’s street children are called. R a d o
is 12 ye a rs old and because he is in good
h e a l t h , no one takes pity on him any more.
Like all the capital’s boay kely—which
the NGO Médecins sans Frontières ( D o c-
t o rs Without Borders) estimated in 1997 to
number 3,500 out of the city’s one million
i n h a b i t a n t s — R a d o ’s wo rst fear is of crack-
downs by city officials. The last one dates
back to the summer of 1997, when there
was a clean-up before the Jeux de la Fran-
cophonie, an international sporting event
b ri n ging together countries that use French
as a common language. Shacks were torn
d own and the street children were taken
off and dumped in a reception centre 50 km
outside the city. But they all ran away
because the rules and the staff were too
s t ri c t . The children walked back to the
capital, living off petty thieving along the
way. After the Games ended, they we r e
back at the market again.
Disease is another threat to street chil-
d r e n . The oldest ones remember typhus.
But not Rado. He surv i ved the bu b o n i c
plague epidemic which occurred in 1997-
9 8 .The disease first broke out in a slum just
b e l ow the market and then gradually spread
among the street children. Some of them
watched as the fatal swellings twisted their
arms.The health authorities responded by
knocking down all the shacks and dousing
the area with clouds of chemicals. M a ny of
the children died. Rado was shocked by
w h at surv i vo rs told him when they return e d
from hospital—that the nurses and wo m e n
attendants had balked at treating the sick
c h i l d r e n , who were dirty and smelly and not
in a position to give them a tip.
Are the boay kely condemned to spend
all their lives on the streets? Probably.The
Things have been a shade better since 1997,
when the economic growth rate (3.7%) topped
population growth (2.8%) for the first time in many
y e a r s. The upturn was maintained last year. M a n y
credit the improvement to the rapid switch to a
m a r ket economy and a democratic system after a
long period of “true socialism”.But in Madagascar,
as elsewhere in sub-Saharan A f r i c a , the remedy of
liberalism may not be enough to roll back poverty.

with a handicap or carrying a baby are more
likely to get attention.
For the youngest children,left,begging is the
only means of survival.
Far left below, teenagers on the street have their
own children who are left to fend for themselves
during the day, when their parents go to work.

girls often end up as prostitutes and the
b oys doing odd jobs. The port e rs , c a r
wa s h e rs , illegal ve n d o rs , b a rr ow haulers ,
water carri e rs and pickpockets were all once
street children. D o - g o o d e rs like Lazari s t
priests or NGOs which campaign against
child labour try to change their lives by
sending them to school. But the children
often rebel. H ow can they do “ h o m e wo r k ”
when they have no home, no table, no light?
W h at ’s the point of “doing nothing” i n
school all day when there’s nothing to eat at
the end of it?
Rado knows he will never escape his
present condition. He envies the few boay
k e l y who have been adopted by foreign
fa m i l i e s. Sometimes photos get passed
around among the boys at the market—
pictures of well-fed yo u n g s t e rs posing with
a grin in front of some place like the Eiffel
Tower. Rado has no chance of that happe-
ning because he’s older than eight, t h e
maximum age for adoption.
But he can still laugh and have fun. Pa s-
sers-by are always surprised that the boay
k e l y are cheerful.They live from day to day
and don’t wo rry too much about the future.
For them, a good day is one when they eat .
And as this good fortune is often enjoyed
inside the likes of an empty refri g e r at o r
b ox , they laugh as much—if not more—
than in a fancy villa. n
Top, during the week,Dominique and Emma live
in the street. On Sundays, they visit Emma’s
parents, in a slum on Tana’s outskirts.

This institution finances itself by raising chickens,
which are tended by the detained teenagers.
