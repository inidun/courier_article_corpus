2❘ Uneven pro g re s s
T he unfortunate and sobering news at the end
of the second millennium is that the number
of illiterate people in many developing coun-
tries still represents more than half their youth and
adult populations, with girls and women compri-
sing two-thirds of this number. Although regional
i l l i t e r a cy rates have been declining in the last
d e c a d e s , there are still close to 900 million illite-
rates in developing countries, representing nearly
25 per cent of the wo r l d ’s youth and adults. A trou-
bling question must be asked:Why haven’t we era-
dicated illiteracy or fulfilled the promises made at
the Education For All Conference held in Jo m t i e n ,
Thailand,in 1990 (see box page 18)? 
All too often,“basic education”has been taken
to mean formal pri m a ry schooling, and gove rn-
ments in developing countries and intern at i o n a l
donor agencies have followed this policy perspec-
tive, putting the vast majority of educational fun-
ding into improving access to primary schooling.
But in spite of major investments in pri m a ry schoo-
ling the results are far from satisfactory.
B u d g e t a ry belt-tightening due to economic
restructuring, falling per-capita spending on basic
e d u c at i o n , high demographic gr owth rat e s , a n d
wars and endogenous conflicts have taken a heavy
toll on formal educational systems in many deve l o-
ping countries of sub-Saharan A f rica and South
Asia, leading to a serious decline in the quality of
school-based instruction and children’s educat i o n .
One consequence of this decline has been an
increase in illiteracy and low literacy rates among
out-of-school youth and young adults. In poor
c o u n t ri e s , especially those with significant popula-
tion gr ow t h , the literacy situation may have become
worse rather than better over the past decade.
It is almost unive rsally true that , in spite of
political rhetori c, l i t e r a cy work has remained at
the bottom of the bu d g e t a ry ladder for both nat i o-



World litera c y:
what went wro n g ?
◗ Mohamed Maamouri
Ten years ago the world community pledged to halve the world illiteracy rate 
by the year 2000. It failed to meet the targ e t . How can it get back on tra c k ?
nal agencies and multilateral donors. H owe ve r ,
bu d g e t a ry limitations alone cannot explain why it
has proved so difficult to make inroads on illite-
r a cy in poor developing countri e s.A review of past
policies and practices indicates that a number of
problems have been endemic.
Firstly, mass literacy campaigns presented lite-
racy as a panacea for a variety of social ills and a
p a s s p o rt to social and economic deve l o p m e n t .T h e y
were often more political than pedagogi c a l , a n d
made empty and unfulfilled claims that eventually
led to the systematic dow n grading and dismant-
ling of literacy education.
Secondly, literacy work has been hampered by
a general lack of motivation among teachers and
l e a rn e rs ,p a rtly because definitions of literacy have
been va riable and poorly unders t o o d , t e a c h i n g
m at e rials have been lacking, and career deve l o p-
ment possibilities for teachers have been non-exis-
t e n t . L i t e r a cy classes have not been perceived as
h aving something immediat e , r e l e vant and direct
to offer that would offset the opportunity costs of
participation.
T h i r d l y, in many developing countri e s ,r e a d i n g
and writing in adult literacy classes are often taught
in indigenous languages, whereas formal primary
schooling has used the official or cosmopolitan lan-
guage (often that of the former colonial powe r ) .
These conflicting language policies have establi-
shed a barrier between the formal and non-formal
systems of educat i o n , c r e ated problems for lear-
ners and their access to socio-economic opportu-
nities.They often sow confusion and lower learner
and teacher motivation.
Literacy statistics and the outcomes of literacy
p r o grammes are questionable.They are often mea-
sured only in terms of the numbers of those who
have participated in the programmes.The empha-
sis on learning achievement made at the Jo m t i e n

conference has not been a major part of literacy
work over the past decade,though some encoura-
ging trends are now being seen.
In many developing countries facing severe fis-
cal cri s e s , the fle x i b i l i t y, d i ve rs i t y, and low - c o s t
f r a m e work of non-formal education offer sub-
stantial opport u n i t i e s , especially since basic skills
are tools enabling the poor to enter economies
undergoing major and rapid changes. B e c a u s e
market economy principles require more decen-
t r a l i z ation and more cost-sharing in educat i o n ,
g ove rnments in developing countries are turning to
i n n ovat i ve part n e rships and collaboration with
N G O s. Their aim is to launch literacy and non-
f o rmal education programmes that can teach more
basic learning skills in less time and at less cost
than conventional schooling.
However more attention must be given to tea-
cher training and ways of assessing results that go
b e yond the simple question of “can you read”? New
assessment methodologies and low-cost multime-
dia teacher training tools are now being developed
by the Intern ational Literacy Institute and UN E S C O.
The growing “feminization”of poverty and its
p e rsistent burden on the status of women in the
d e veloping world are now recognized as cri t i c a l
areas of concern for literacy work,and several cur-
rent literacy programmes are focusing on learning
skills and strategies aimed at redressing the gender
i m b a l a n c e . These programmes offer a va riety of
practical solutions for the empowerment of needy
women and are built around income-generat i n g
activities and productive employ m e n t , credit mana-
gement skills, good parenting and child-reari n g
practices.
Many curriculum development innovations in
l i t e r a cy programmes invo l ve the use of gender-sen-
sitive materials in nutrition,primary health,home
economics and HIV-Aids education.Linkage bet-
ween adult learning and the education of youth and
children has also emerged as a promising approach.
The successes of several literacy programmes such
as the community-based intergenerational pro-
grammes in Ghana or Egypt and the Tostan Project
in Senegal* provide evidence that more progress is
likely in this domain.
These emerging trends show that real progress
can be achieved in the coming decade.Though lite-
racy has moved nearer to the top of the agenda in
m a ny developing countri e s , it still needs to be gi ve n
a more important place in the development plans of
g ove rn m e n t s ,n ational part n e rs ,N G O s , the pri vat e
s e c t o r , and intern ational agencies, along with gr e a-
ter investment and co-operation. ■
