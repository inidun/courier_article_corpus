DIMENSIONS
OF A DISASTER
The list which follows of artistic
and cultural casualties suffered
by the city of Florence alone is
necessarily incomplete. It will be
months, perhaps years, before a
detailedanddefinitive assessment
can be made of the losses.
Fifteen hundred paintings were damaged in Florence alone. An emergency
"hospital" has been opened for these flood-damaged masterpieces in the huge
building that normally houses the unique collection of lemon trees of the Palazzo Pitti.
The building, 120 metres long by 10 metres high (400 ft. by 30 ft.), has been
transformed into a vast insulated chamber equipped with furnaces and air blowers.
Paintings on wood which demand a long and delicate treatment are set on wooden
tables and sprayed with special disinfecting gas to kill mould. Above,
"Noli me tangere", a celebrated work by Pontecormo (1531) based on a sketch
by Michelangelo. It was preserved in the Casa Buonarroti (Michelangelo's home).
Except for a hand, the figure of Christ has been completely effaced (right
of photo). A city set on the hills in background has almost vanished. Left, works
in marble, bronze and ceramic from a museum storeroom after rescue from the mud.
MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES
MUSEO ARCHEOLOGICO. Thirty-four
ground-floor rooms, including Etruscan
topographical museum, invaded by floods.
Floors burst open, glass cases demolished
and exhibits buried in mud. Over 9,000
vases and other valuable relics, including
many objects in bronze and other metals,
await cleaning and restoration. In restora¬
tion studio, equipment and objects being
restored, including six painted Egyptian
sarcophagi, badly damaged. Photographic
studio equipment destroyed and records
damaged.
MUSEO BARDINI. Entire ground floor
flooded. Celebrated collection of musical
instruments (16th to 19th centuries) gravely
damaged. Large wooden model by Ghe-
rardo Silvani (project for church of St.
Firenze), "Madonna" by Cranach and a
"Hercules" painted by Domenico Becca-
fumi all severely damaged.

DIMENSIONS OF A DISASTER (Cont'd)
MUSEO BARGELLO. Four metres (13 ft.)
of water in exhibition room of Michelangelo
sculptures submerged and stained these
works. Three terracotta figures by Tribolo,
another by Vincenzo Danti and the bronze
"Samson and the Philistine" by Perino da
Vinci all broken. Courtyard sculptures by
Ammammati and Giovanni Bologna stained

100 statues covered with mud and oil.
Uninue collection of models for construction

volumes of ancient archives in basement
damaged plus 55 illuminated Renaissance
musical codices.
MUSEO DI STORIA DELLA SCIENZA.
Many collections of inestimable value
engulfed by mud. Collections of ancient
clocks, alembics, scales and scientific
instruments (16th to 20th centuries), inclu¬
ding Edison's phonograph, destroyed or
seriously damaged.
MUSEO HORNE. This museum, present¬
ed to Florence by an English scholar
and collector, Herbert Home, was seri¬
ously damaged. Over four metres (14 ft.)

MUSEO MEDICEO, PALAZZO RICCARDI.
Oily water in ground floor flooded glass
cases and damaged tapestries. Medici
family portrait collection untouched except
for "Duke Alessandro" by Vasari. The
"Madonna" by Filippo Lippi was just clear
of water.

Using vegetable strainers to sift carefully
through the mud, specialists search for tiny
fragments of pamt from the celebrated "Crucifix"
by Cimabue. In the museum of the church
of Santa Croce water submerged most
of the big wooden crucifix. When water withdrew,
blisters opened on the paintwork and 60%
of the painted surface flaked away.

The 'Crucifix'
by Cimabue
A SEVEN
CENTURIES-OLD
MASTERPIECE
RUINED
Cimabue's "Crucifix" (detail
right), the masterpiece which
launched a new era in Florentine
painting in the 13th century,
is now ruined (below).
The work had already survived
a series of disasters.
Placed high on the choir screen
in the church of Santa Croce,
it came through the great floods
of 1333 and 1466 unscathed.
About 1500 it was moved
to the left wall of the church,
otherwise it would have been
destroyed in 1512 when a storm
toppled the campanile, which hurled
down a mass of debris on top
of the choir screen.
After being moved in and out'
of various chapels, the "Crucifix"
ended up on the top floor
of the Uffizi Gallery, where it
would have been safe
in the recent floods. But less
than two years ago the work was
returned to Santa Croce and put
in the low-lying museum where
the waters reached
it on November 4.

Left, the "Gates
of Paradise",
one of three
doorways in the
Baptistery. Its ten
gilded bronze
panels fashioned
by Lorenzo
Ghiberti illustrate
stories from the
Old Testament.
Right, the panel
"Joseph and
his Brothers"
is taken to safety
after recovery from
the sea of mud.

I HREE torrents sweep¬
ing at over 60 kph. (40 mph.) into
the Piazza del Duomo, in Flo¬
rence, battered and shook the
immense bronze doors of the
Baptistery. The celebrated
"Gates of Paradise" so named
by Michelangelo were especial¬
ly badly hit. The sculptor and
goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti spent
27 years (1425-1452) fashioning
these doors. Five of their ten
massive gilded bronze panels
were torn away, but were later
recovered from the mud, their
exquisite reliefs stained with oil.

Creation", "Cain and Abel" and
"Jacob and Esau" suffered dam¬
age. Two of the five dislodg¬
ed panels "Joseph and his
Brothers" and "Cain and Abel"
were displayed at Unesco
H.Q. in Paris on December 3 and
4, 1966, following the launching
of the International Campaign
for Florence and Venice by the
Director-General of Unesco. Also
on view was a smaller panel,
"The Angel Appears to Zacha-
rias," wrenched from another
Baptistery door.
This doorway was wrought in
1336 by Andrea Pisano, who
related the life of John the Bap¬
tist, patron saint of Florence, in
twenty bas-reliefs to which were
added eight allegorical panels
representing the virtues.

Písanos doors
of bronze
Chips and splits in these heavy
bronze doors on the south side
of the Baptistery show the
devastating force of the floodwaters
and the debris they hurled forward
like projectiles. From the panels
in this doorway by the sculptor
Andrea Pisano, two have been torn
away. Above the empty frame,
a relief showing the entombment
of John the Baptist is intact. Left,
"The Angel Appears to Zacharias",
a panel from the same door
recovered after the waters subsided.

Oil-polluted floodwater
has left ugly smears
on part of the frescoes
by Andrea Bonaiuti
in the Spanish Chapel
of Santa Maria Novella
(right). Effects of
the floods may well
continue for years since
dampness in the walls
may in time affect
the entire surface
of the frescoes.
Nor does anyone know
the final effects of oil
an entirely new
hazard. Left, mutilated
wooden statue removed
from Sant'Ambrogio
church for restoration
in studios of the
Uffizi Museum. In box
are statue's hands
and hair tress, broken
off when wood fibres
swelled and split.
