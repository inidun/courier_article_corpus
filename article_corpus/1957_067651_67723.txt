ARTHUR RIMBAUD
Maps and atlases
were his canvas
STENDHAL DANCING, below, is also in Musset's "Italian
Sketchbook", though he did the drawing in France. This scene
was described by George Sand in The Story of my Life. She
shows Stendhal "... dancing around the table with his fur lined
boots... rather grotesque and not at all attractive." Below, left,
a drawing of Chopin by George Sand, of whom she said: "He
is the only man who has devoted himself entirely to me, with
no regret for the past, and no reservation about the future."
BY the age of 19 Arthur Rimbaud had written all his poetry
and washed his hands of literature. The rest of his life
(he died in Marseilles at 37 unaware that Verlaine's study of
him in Les poètes maudits (1881) had made him famous) he spent
wandering about the world described by him as "so big and full
of magnificent countries that the life of a thousand men would
not suffice to visit them." Even as a child Rimbaud was fas¬
cinated with foreign places and spent much time in his native
Charleville poring over maps and atlases. It is on these that
his earliest drawings are found. "Three Citizens of Charleville"
(above) was drawn on the back of a map of India when he
was 15; "Man in a Frock-Coat" (below) was done on the back
of a map of ancient Greece; another was drawn on a map of
Gaul. A large in-folio atlas belonging to his family was found,
after his death, to be covered with caricatures and sketches.
Drawing was Rimbaud's hobby all his life. He has left delicate
drawings, including one of Aden in 1880 and sketches of Abyssinia
where ha spent his last years as a trader.
