Development should be
the servant of mankind
and not its master. The
ultimate purpose of
economic growth must be
spiritual and moral
fulfilment, and not merely
material well-being.
Unesco's mission is to
view development in
human terms, and to
encourage men, women
and children alike to
express their cultural
identity. Right,
motherhood in Nepal.



MAN-THE CENTRE
OF DEVELOPMENT
IT is still unreservedly acknowl¬
edged that development can nei¬
ther begin nor continue without
economic growth.
Today, however, no one can deny
that this is not the whole story, that
economic growth is justified by the
social progress which it engenders
and that it is more than just a stage
on the way to such progress.
Economic development cannot be
dissociated from the development of
society as a whole. It depends on
the active participation of everyone,
and this can only be obtained through
smoothly running institutions and the
whole-hearted support of individuals
and groups.
The principles of humanism deter¬
mine the goals to which development
must be directed. Man must benefit
from it. Development must not
merely contain the promise of greater
social justice: it must, from beginning
to end, translate the principle of
equity into realities.
Furthermore, development must be
of benefit to man from every point of
view. The raising of living standards
is, of course, fundamental, but an
improvement in material conditions is
not enough, by itself, to allow people
to lead a life worth living.
Development must therefore be
aimed at the spiritual, moral and
material fulfilment of man in his
entirety, both as a member of society
and as an individual. It should lead
to, but it should also derive from,
greater and more informed particip¬
ation by the individual in the life of
the community.

The humanist principle also deter¬
mines the paths of development. If
man must clearly be the objective and
the beneficiary of development, he is
in the first place its agent.
If the humanist significance of deve¬
lopment is to be fully appreciated,
it is equally important to take account
of its international context which,
to a large extent, determines its
conditions.
The importance of the international
community's decision to work to¬
gether for the establishment of a
new economic order on a world
scale cannot be over-emphasized.
Apart from an indispensable in¬
crease in the resources available to
the developing nations, what this new
international economic order pro¬
mises and demands is that each
country should be able to make its
own decisions and control its own
destiny. This is independence in the
profound sense of the term. This is
dignity for the community and for its
members.
Consequently, each country will be
enabled and impelled to reorganize
and liberate its economic and social
life, and to assemble its resources
more coherently in an autonomous
development effort inspired by freely
accepted motives and aspirations.
In the task of explaining, illustra¬
ting and achieving this new order,
Unesco has an extremely important,
unique and in many respects central
role to play.
Unesco, as an organization respon¬
sible for the growth and enrichment
of all the sciences and as the only
body which provides opportunities for
participation in large-scale programmes
of intellectual co-operation, thereby
providing access to the world's store¬
house of scientific knowledge and
information, should logically serve as
the focal point and catalyst in the
creation of social science infrastruc¬
tures and in promoting the develop¬
ment of a social science with national
and international, disciplinary and in¬
terdisciplinary components.
In other words, it is Unesco's task,
on behalf of the United Nations sys¬
tem as a whole, to co-ordinate all
efforts in this field.
Unesco, with its general responsi¬
bility for the promotion of spiritual
values, is also empowered to act as
a centre for humanistic and ethical
reflection and to go beyond merely
technical considerations, viewing the
problems of development in terms of
their human significance.
Cultural action cannot be confined
to the mere diffusion of culture, and
access to culture means more than
merely making cultural works avai¬
lable. For even if the individual has
the means and opportunities to parti¬
cipate in cultural life, he must also
make an effort intellectual, ideologi¬
cal or psychologicalwhich in many
cases requires him to perform a lib¬
erating act: the assertion of his per¬
sonality in the search for cultural
identity.
The participation of large numbers
of people in cultural life reflects first
and foremost a sense of belonging to
a culture and to the society from
which it emanates.
Even when a culture is related to
others, it has certain unique features
which reflect its specific identity.
This is true of all countries, and is
more obvious still in cases where
cultural identity is asserting itself with .
particular force as the expression of
the dignity of peoples that until
recently were subject to foreign poli¬
tical and cultural domination. In this
way access becomes participation.
Where individuals are concerned,
access to and participation in cultural
life encourage creation and innova¬
tion, the exploration and free expres¬
sion of the self, thereby leading to
new and as yet unsuspected forms of
art.
If the public at large is to partici¬
pate effectively in cultural life, it is
vitally important that policies to
promote cultural activities should be
integrated with action in other fields
designed to achieve the same object.
These policies concern three sec¬
tors in which action by the authori¬
ties may provoke action in depth, the
effects of which will be felt particu¬
larly in the medium and long term:
education, communication and book
promotion.
Decisions taken by Member States
reveal their growing awareness of
the overall nature of development
and of the fact that culture is one
of its inherent factors.
The true cause of the disequilibrium
with which the world is confronted at
the present time is seen as much as
a crisis of values as an economic
crisis. There is a realization that
man aspires to new values more than
to comfort and enjoyment.
This quest for new values is a cul¬
tural process whereby man displays
his essential dignity and his equality
with his fellows, by communicating,
creating, fashioning himself, by giving
to life a meaning and a richness which
stem as much, if not more, from the
state of "being" as from the state of
"having".
