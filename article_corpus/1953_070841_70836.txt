ed himself free to think as
he pleased. His book,
however, is not a personal
complaint but an indict-
ment of all forms of arbi-
trary imprisonment. It is
on behalf of all prisoners

that he denounces inhuman
treatment, cruelty and tor-
ture. In the 19th century
his book profoundly shock-
ed society. Even in the
middle of the 20th century
his words have not lost
their significance :"Anyone
who has once experienced
this unlimited mastery of
the body, blood and soul
of a fellow man, the power
and full licence to inflict
the greatest humiliation
upon another creature made
in the image of God, will
unconsciously lose the mas-
tery of his own sensations.
The right of corporal
punishment given to one
man over another is one of
the sores of social life, one
of the strongest forces des-
tructive of every germ,
every effort in society
towards civic feeling, and a
sufficient cause for its ine-
vitable dissolution."
Phileas Fogg
THREE quarters of a century ago Jules Verne wrote hisRound the W orid in 80 Days, but ven to arly
twentieth century travellers this record seemed
extremely modest. Today the thought of the.'hasty"
world tour made by Phileas Fogg and the superhuman
efforts he made to complete the circuit of the globe in
time to win his bet may bring smiles to the faces of
those who live in the age of jet airliners and rocket
planes. But if today a new Phileas wagered that he

ON these pages the COURIER presents twelve
characters in. fictional literature who have
jought for the rights proclaimed in the
Universal Declaration or who have suffered
because they were deprived oj these rights. Many
other examples might have been chosen. World
literature, indeed, provides numerous novels and
plays in which one or several characters could be
used to symbolize man's struggle jor human
rights. The examples given here are inwndea
merely as suggestions jor the teacher and as an
idea which ojfers almost unlimited possibilities

The Martyrs
Lygia is a highly romanticized characterization of an
early Christian martyr who does not die. But the Chris-
tian martyrs who are burned alive, tortured and fed to the
lions in Quo Wadis are not characters of fiction and Hen-
ryk Sienkiewicz had no need to invent them.
If the Albigenses, for example, or Jan Huss have inspired
poets ; if Joan of Arc, the Quakers and Giordano Bruno
have appeared on the stage or screen, they were not area'
tions of the imagination but real victims in history who
suffered the tortures inflicted upon them by other men
because of their religious beliefs. Perhaps no book of
fiction can plead the cause of religious liberty or religious
tolerance with the same force as the straight, dry account
of a martyrology or with the persuasion of a simple
monument in certain concentration camps. But these
poems, these plays, these novels and films help to remind
us that the message of the victims still needs retelling and
that all human beliefs have had their martyrs.
Uncle Tom
SOME of the greatestwriters in istory have
attacked slavery, but
while their reasoned argu-
ments in favour of its abo-
lition convinced the few
who read them, they never
succeeded in rousing pub-
lic opinion. Just over a
century ago, however, a
book appeared which
stirred up a whirlwind of
anti-slavery agitation in the
United States. Uncle Tom's
Cabin more than confirmed
the prophecy of a French
literary critic of the time
who wrote :"'It will do

eighty days later, having
been around the world in
the meantime, he would
probably lose his bet. He
would need a passport, and
a whole series of visas. He
would have to make reser.
vations, apply for currency
allotments, be medically
examined, undergo innocni-
ations... and even then he
would probably still be
waiting for a visa. In other
words his trip would re-
quire weeks of prepar-
ations. The relative ease
with which Phileas Fogg
moved from country to
country serves to remind
us how many obstacles
have since been raised tv
prevent everyone from 1m-t----1

any country including his own... and to return..."
Nora
IN Ibsen's A Voll's House, Nora is not a womanoppressed by a cruel master or crushed by inhu an
treatment. On the contrary, her husband Torcald

cut ! KE many fond parents",wrote Charles Dickens,"I
have in my heart of hearts
a favourite child, and his name is
David Copperfield". Dickens'
book remains one of the most
loved and one of the most moving
pieces of fiction in the English
language. To young people, living
normal family lives and who are
not forced to go out to work at
the age of ten, David's experiences
are a reminder that they are for-
tunate to be warmly clothed, to
have a home, to be adequately fed,
and to go to a good school.
Though it is over a century since
Dickens told his story of David
Copperfield, he still speaks out on
behalf of the millions of children
who grow up as he himself did,
abandoned or at best merely tole-
rated, victims of unkindness, of
want or simply of the ignorance
of their elders. Dickens died over
80 years ago but his young hero
still speaks in the name of all
children who are today deprived
of the"right to education"and
"the right to special care and
assistance"affirmed in the Uni-
versal Declaration.

But to him she is no more than a
little girl-or an amusing doll.
"Only lean on me", he tells her,
"I will counsel you, and guide
you. I should be no true man
if this very womanly help-
lessness did not make you
doubly dear in my eyes."
When she revolts at the end of
the play it is to claim only one
right : that of being a person.
Nora reminds Torvald that no
marriage can be built on inequa-
lity. And as she slams the door'

with irrevocable. finality, she
declares that she is going to try
to become a reasonable human
being, to try to understand the
world-in short to become a
woman not a doll to flatter her
husband's selfish vanity. Al-
though Ibsen did not write A
Doll's House as a feminist play,
it still stands today as a classic
expression of the theme of
woman's rights. Nora delibera-
tely leaving her husband and
family shocked Ibsen's contempo-
raries, and though it roused towers
of argument in many countries,
it had the effect of a tremendous

have bestowed sn men ; with it the treasures locked in
the earth or hidden in the depths of the sea are not to
be compared ; for the sake of freedom, as for the sake of
honour, one may and should risk one's life, and captivity,
on the other hand, is the greatest evil that can befall a
human being. You have seen, Sancho, the abundance
and luxury in that castle we have just left ; yet I assure
you that in the midst of those delicious banquets and
snow-cooled beverages it seemed to me as though I were
in the straits of hunger, since I did not enjoy them with
the same freedom as if they had been my own. The
obligation to return benefits and favors received is a
shackle on the liberty-loving spirit of man. Happy he to
whom Heaven gives a slice of bread without his being
obliged to thank any other person but only Heaven

The Joad Family
THE Joad family wantedto work their lan
and wanted a decent
home to live in. But they
had neither. Their farm
was barren sand, parched
by drought and swept by
dust storms and rolling
tumbleweeds. Like thou-
sands of farmers in Oklaho-
ma and other southwestern
states, the loads were
reaping the Grapes of
Wrath sown by their grand-
fathers who had recklessly
misused the land,.'skimmed
off the cream"and left
them with a Dust Bowl.
Unable to make a living
they took to the roads, and

beck's powerful novel of
the depression period in

the hardships of Tom, Ma

John Steinbeck's novel is
a stirring account of the or-

struggle for a decent stand-

devoted as the aged servant of
Ulysses, as dignified as a Roman
senator and as inspired as a pro-
phet of Israel. He and his people
commanded not only affection but
admiration, not only pity, but
respect. The contrast between the
great-hearted slave and his cruel
master brought home the igno-
miny of the slave system as well
as the absurdity of the dogma of
racial inequality. Uncle Tom's
Cabin did not by itself bring
slavery in the United States to an
end, but it achieved its author's
purpose :"to make this whole
nation feel what an accursed thing

Chandalika
Chandalika is a play by Rabin-
dranath Tagore, based on a Budd-
hist legend. Recently translated
into English from the original
Bengali, it deals with the Budd-
hist tenets of equality of all
human beings, and brings out the
evils of the caste system. A
young girl-Chandalika, or un-
touchable-is suddenly awaken-
ed to a consciousness of her full
rights as a person by the humanity

of a follower of the Buddha who accepts water from her
hands and teaches her to judge herself, not by the artifi-
cial values that society attaches to the accidents of birth,
but by her capacity for love and service. Tagore was
not only a great Indian poet but a great social thinker.
Perhaps nowhere is the essence, of hist social philosophy
enshrined better than in the ringing lines of his poem
on Freedom :"Where Ithe mind is without fear and the
head is held high ; Where knowledge is free ; Where the
world has not been broken iup into fragments by narrow
domestic walls ;"Where words come out from the depths
of truth... Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let
my. country awake."

mands ten litres a day, and
the lash is a usurer that

if my neighbour dies of

latex he gathered. They'll
do the same with me when
I die..."Such were the
life and the conditions of
work of Arturo Covas por-
trayed by José E. Rivera in
his moving novel The For-
tex. The book painted the
plight of rubber workers
shipped into the Amazon
jungles of Colombia by the
thousands to toil, remain in
perpetual debt... and die.
Sometimes the workers
tried to flee and perished
in the forest ; sometimes
they committed suicide by
drinking the thick liquid
of the rubber trees. Rive-
ra's novel is a terrible
expose of inhuman working
conditions and of the thru-
tal exploitation of men by
other men. It aroused
Latin American and other
countries to the abuses
suffered by the caucheros
and was instrumental in
helping to end many of
such practices. The same
social problem has also
been evoked by the Portu-
guese writer Ferreira de
Castro in his novels The
Jungle and Emigrants.

Stephen KUlDslo

an unforgettable figure. The
old Zulu pastor's personal su'-
ferings when he goes to Johan-
nesburg in search for his own
children who have left the belo-
- 13-
ved country, his grief at the widespread demoralization
he finds among his own people, epitomize the sufferings
of his race. Cry, the Beloved Country is a novel of love
not hate, of hope and courage springing from the daunt-
less spirit of man. It ilacks entirely the bitterness, dogma-
tism and exaggerated melodrama which disfigures most
fictional treatments of race relations. It is a book steep-
ed in sadness over man's inhumanity to man but it is
illuminated by a compassion and a generosity of spirit
which is as rare as it is beautiful and moving. The book
suggests that there are men of good intentions every.
where but still not enough of them to rebuild society in
terms of equality, justice and generosity.
WnliolD Tell
CUT'HE will of the people shall be the basis of theauthority of government"states the. Universal
Declaration. This is essential"if man is not to
be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebel-
lion against tyranny and oppression."The struggle
against tyranny throughout history has been illustrated in
all languages and in the most ancient tales and legends.
Perhaps the most famous tale is that of William Tell, the
Swiss hero, now a universal hero. Many versions of the
Tell legend exist. In Friedrich Schiller's pla, the tyrant
Gessler continues to crush the people with his intolerable
injustice until Willim, the skilled crossbowman, rises
"to defend and avenge all men"and rids the land of the
oppressor. A similar story is told of Egil, in Scandi-
navian legend ; of Toki, the Danish hero ; of Eindridi,
in Norse legends, and of Adam Bell in English ballads.
