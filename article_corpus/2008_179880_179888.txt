On hand were the characters Max and 
Lara from the children’s stories cre-
ated by RaW.
Launched in January 2007, the 
RaW programme provides, among 
other material, story books that 
parents can read to their children 
while at the same time improving 
their own literacy skills with puzzles 
and quizzes.
During the summer in 2007 and 2008, 
RaW went on tour to areas in the 
United Kingdom where literacy is 
low. A circus-like environment was 
set up to incite families to partici-
pate in story-telling festivals. 
reADing AnD fun
More than 12 million people have 
difficulty with reading and writing in 
the United Kingdom. The BBC decided 
to come to their aid by launching the 
programme RaW (Reading and Writing), 
which has just received an Honourable 
Mention in this year’s UNESCO King 
Sejong Literacy Prize awards.

One of the festival’s high points was 
a storytelling performance from 
Sidney Sloane (above, left), children’s 
television presenter for the BBC. 
Telling stories to children is an art, 
on which the BBC has published some 
handy “Tips” (above, right). 
Besides the events it organizes - 
reading clubs, quiz groups in pubs, 
travelling circus with readings and 
shows - RaW also makes available 
free programmes for mobile phones 
and even free half-hour telephone 
consultations with a teacher.   
