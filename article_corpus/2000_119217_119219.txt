ENERGY’S WIND 
OF CH A NGE
◗ Birger T. Madsen
Wind energy is rapidly developing as an environmentally sound and cost-effective option 
for power generation. Here, one of its champions describes an industry with wind in its sales

It takes a stiff upper lip not to smile
when Don Quixote almost falls off
his horse in fright after mistaking a
windmill for a giant.But perhaps the unli-
kely hero of Cervantes’literary masterpie-
ce can be credited with foresight. Today’s
windmills, dubbed wind turbines, dwarf
their predecessors, as their steely arms
slice through the air at heights of up to
100 metres. More and more of these
giants sprout on land and at sea, and they
are gaining new ground in the marketpla-
ce. And while at present wind power pro-
vides just 0.15 per cent of the world’s
total electricity, it has become the fastest
growing form of energy production.
The basic principles of wind energy
have been known for many centuries.The
earliest references to windmills date back to
7thcentury Persia, but for many the image
most closely associated with wind power is
t h at which gave Don Quixote such a fri g h t :
a picturesque timber tower supporting four
long cloth-covered sails rotating in the
w i n d . To d ay ’s wind turbine consists of a
giant propeller fixed on top of a tall metal
p o l e .When it rotat e s , the propeller dri ves a
g e n e r ator which churns out electricity that
can either supply nearby users,possibly in
an isolated rural community, or alternati-
vely be sent down a cable hooked up to a
central energy gri d . One problem is that no
way has yet been found of storing electri c i t y
to enable the wind’s “ups and dow n s ” t o
be evened out.The trend is for wind farms
to move offshore, where their appearance
and the sound of whirring propellers wo n ’t
bother local communities, and strong and
steady sea winds will keep the turbines tur-
ning at full force.
For the past 25 ye a rs , m a n u fa c t u r e rs
h ave been streamlining components and
installing on-board computers to tilt the
propeller blades, for example, to suit part i-
cular wind conditions. In the early 1980s,
◗ Managing Director of BTM Consult Aps (Denmark), 
a leading consultancy group specializing in wind power
the average turbine was 20 metres high with
a 26-kilowatt (kW) generator and a rotor
diameter of 10.5 metres. A typical turbine
t o d ay may be perched 55 metres high, h ave
r o t o rs with a diameter of around 50-60
metres and a capacity of up to 1,650 kW.
The amount of energy it can produce is
equivalent to that consumed by about 350
European households.
Since 1992, more commercial wind
fa rms have been installed in more coun-
t ries than ever before. There are now
40,000 turbines in 40 countri e s , and the
world’s wind energy capacity is growing at
nearly 27 per cent annually. In 1998, it top-
ped 10,000 megawatts (MW), about the
total energy producing capacity of a coun-
t ry like Denmark.The 1999 figures are not
all in, but we know that 1998 was a boom
year for the wind power industry. E q u i p-
ment sales topped $2 billion and there we r e
35,000 jobs in the sector wo r l d w i d e .
G r owth is expected to continue at about
25 per cent a year.
The prime motors of expansion are
increasing environmental awareness and
political commitments to reduce gr e e n-
house gas emissions made under the Kyo t o
Protocol of 1997.Wind is free and supplies
of it are inexhaustible, and when it pro-
duces energy it doesn’t release heat or
greenhouse gases.
The European Union has taken the
lead in rolling out the “green carpet” by
introducing tax breaks and investment
plans aimed at developing renewa b l e
energy sources such as wind power.There
are plans to install 40,000 megawatts by
the year 2010. Denmark, the wind energy
pioneer, covers 10 per cent of its electrici-
ty consumption from wind power, delive-
red from an installed capacity of some
1,700 MW. Germany is quickly catching
up, and is now the wind sector’s fastest
gr owing market (see article page 1 1 ) .
Spain, with its ample grazing lands and
steady winds, is also soon likely to be
attracting investment.
Rolling out a green carpet
The climate in the U.S. has been more
vo l at i l e . E ve ry two ye a rs , a congr e s s i o n a l
b attle erupts around the renewal of an
important tax credit to spur the industry.
The same tumult rattles state legislatures
that have their own credit schemes.Accor-
ding to U.S.energy secretary Bill Richard-
s o n , wind power should provide five per
cent of the nation’s electricity demands by
the year 2020, compared to the current 0.1
per cent.
For the up and coming energy gi a n t s ,
notably India and China, interest in wind
p ower has less to do with env i r o n m e n t a l
awareness than with economics. T h e s e
countries where broad swathes of the rural
population are without electricity are keen
to take advantage of wind investment plans
offered by Denmark, G e rm a ny and the
N e t h e r l a n d s.With nearly 850 MW installed
c a p a c i t y, India ranks first among deve l o-
ping countries and fourth in the world after
Germany in the wind power league table.
About 600 turbines are churning out 260
MW in China.
Asia and the Pa c i fic used to be conside-
red the coming hot spot for wind powe r.
The prime motors 
of expansion are increasing
e n v i r o n m e n tal awareness 
and political commitments 
to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions made under 
the Kyoto Protocol of 19 97.
Wind is free and supplies 
of it are inexhaustible, 
and when it produces energy 
it doesn’t release heat 
or greenhouse gases.

H owe ve r , the regi o n ’s financial crisis of
1998 knocked many energy inve s t m e n t
plans off cours e , with the notable excep-
tion of New Zealand’s Ta r a rua W i n d
Farm—the largest in the southern hemis-
phere with a capacity of 12 MW.
Turbines are few and far between in
South America, aside from a few installa-
tions in Costa Rica,Argentina and Brazil.
Danish manufa c t u r e rs are making some
inroads into North A f ri c a : M o r o c c o
recently installed 50 MW and Egypt 30
M W.The rest of the continent is in the dol-
d ru m s , an unfort u n ate state of affa i rs gi ve n
the tremendous need for renewable energy,
especially in rural areas.
While the wo r l d ’s richest wind resources
are found in North A m e ri c a , China and the
former Soviet states, particularly those in
Central A s i a , we believe that wind powe r
could provide at least 20 per cent of every
continent’s energy needs.There is enough
wind to provide twice the expected global
e l e c t ricity demand for 2020. E ven if only 10
per cent of energy needs were met by wind
p owe r , the world would be spared about 10
billion tons of carbon emissions (out of a
total of 60-70 billion tons).To achieve this
goal, 120 times more wind capacity would
h ave to be installed than there is today.T h e
initial investment required would be ve ry
h i g h , but operation and maintenance costs
would be marginal.
M a n u fa c t u r e rs today are building bigger
and better turbines, and as a result wind-
p ower prices have been falling at about 20
per cent over the past four ye a rs. In Den-
m a r k , for example, e l e c t ricity generated by
wind power cost almost 17 cents per kilo-
watt hour (kWh) in the early 1980s. T h e
fig u r e , which cove rs all costs (equipment,
l a b o u r , interest on loans, o p e r ation and
maintenance) fell to 6.15 cents by 1995 and
has since dropped to about 4.6 cents.
M e a n w h i l e ,e l e c t ricity produced by the ins-
t a l l ation of a new coal-fired power plant
would cost 5 to 6.4 cents kWh, 4 and 5.7
cents kWh in the case of a gas-fired plant,
and 4.6 to 6.5 cents kWh in a nuclear fa c i l i t y,
according to calculations by UNIPEDE, the 
European Utility A s s o c i at i o n .
But while the cost of wind-powered elec-
t ricity will continue to fall in the future,
c o m p e t i t i ve prices are not enough—there
must be a political will to develop the 
market.Developing countries often find it
d i f ficult to raise the capital to cover the steep
s t a rt-up costs of installing wind turbines.
This is the downside of wind powe r.T h e
initial costs of installing coal-fired plants,
for example, are relat i vely cheap but fuel
then has to be imported and in the long ru n
this carbon-based energy will cost more
than wind energy. If these countries are to
d e velop an environmentally sound energy
sector using wind powe r , they will need help
in finding the initial investment.
The situation is radically different in
N o rth A m e rica and We s t e rn Europe, b o t h
of which have enough installed energy capa-
city to meet demand. In these countries the
market for wind energy is dri ven by env i-
ronmental  considerations rather than eco-
n o m i c s. If gove rnments do not adopt “ gr e e n
p o l i c i e s ”r e q u i ring utility companies to close
d own classical power plants and switch ove r
to renewable energy sources, the market for
wind power will not be very dynamic.
Green parties are stepping up the
pressure on gove rnments to promote
clean energies by helping to fund R&D
c o s t s , for example. Other measures that
could be taken include subsidizing
e l e c t ricity payments or offering tax
credits and low-interest loans for
m a n u fa c t u r e rs. The “polluter pay s ”
p rinciple might also be applied, with a
special tax being levied on carbon-
emitting energy producers , as opposed
to a clean energy source such as wind.
A ‘doped’ market
Some argue that a truly promising
energy source should not require gove rn-
ment support . O t h e rs maintain that sub-
sidies will do more harm than good by
d i s t o rting the energy market and art i fi-
cially boosting what remains an unpro-
mising altern at i ve . I would argue the
c o n t r a ry — t h at gas, c o a l , oil and nuclear
energy have been “ d o p e d ” on state subsi-
dies from the start .
M a ny power companies using these fuels
There is enough wind 
to provide twice the expected
global electricity demand 
for 20 20

began as state monopolies protected by
n ational legi s l at i o n .They control the powe r
gri d s. Often they bar new energy producers
from the grids or impose rules which oblige
n e w c o m e rs to sell their energy at unfa i r
p ri c e s.The development of wind power has
also been hurt by the absence of legi s l at i o n .
For example, the UK has the best wind
resources in Europe, but commercial
attempts to set up wind fa rms in the last
three ye a rs were stymied when local autho-
rities failed to issue permits for turbine
c o n s t ru c t i o n . Had the national gove rn m e n t
set up guidelines and policies inciting local
a u t h o rities to co-operat e , there might be
more wind fa rms in Britain today.
The two notable champions of wind
p ower are Denmark and Germ a ny. Fe r o-
ciously anti-nuclear, the public in both
these countries studied their energy options
before giving wind a “ green light”. T h e i r
diligence is now paying off at home and
a b r o a d , as their turbines blow a fresh breeze
into global energy production. ■
