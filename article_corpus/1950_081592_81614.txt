EXPERTS PLAN ACTION TO RESOLVE INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT TANGLE
O : \ Ocluùn' : ? : 3, a gl'oup of intel'l ! ational cOPllright.,-pel'ls 1//et in',"ashington at the incitation of
Unesco to considCl'the drafting of a Unirersal
Conccntion on Copyright. The lIleetiny mar/ied an im-
pol'lant step in Unesco's efforts to protect creatire 1corker
and to help l'emo'e intellectual and cultuml ùa1Tiel'S
between peoples. A majority of the 37 countries 1which
hare thus fal'replicd to a Unesco questionnail'e al'e in
farour of the establishment of a Unicel'sal Convention. As
the expel'is met, they had before them a proposal that
Unesco convene an intel'-govel'mnental conference to
prepare the lfmft. In the article below arç desC1'ibed
some of the problems caused by the maze of legal dif-
fel' ('nees in the field of copyright,
THE writer, the musician
- any creative worker-
has two important rights
in the product of his labour :
the right to a proper share in
the profits of its sale and the
right to have its original form
and meaning preserved. These
things taken together form
what is known as"Copyright,.
or"literary and artistic owner-
ship."The Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights gives it
special mention in Article 27 :
"Everyone has the right to
the protection of the moral
and material interests result-
ing from any scientific, literary
or artistic production of which
he is the author."
But, in the same afticle, the
Declaration mentions another
right no less important :
"Everyone has the right free-
ly to participate in the cul-
tural life of the community, to
enjoy the arts and to share in
scientific advancement and its
benefits."In other words,
literary and artistic works
must be as easily accessible to
the public as achievements in
the scientific field.
At first sight, these two
prerogatives may seem to
conflict : the right of the
author to protect his work ;
and the right of the public to
have access to it. One of the
most serious problems to be
faced in any definition of
copyright is the need to main-
tain a delicate balance bet-
ween interests equally deserv-
ing of consideration. Accord-
ing to the importance which
legislation places on author's
rights or those of the public,

the definition varies of lite-
rary and artistic copyright.
Many other factors play their
part in the promulgation of
copyright laws, not the least
of which are the interests of
distributing agencies.
When Cl'eatiye works
Cross Border
EACH country has to
contend with internal
difficulties according 
its own legislation. But the
problems of copyright go
beyond national frontiers :
books are translated, pictures
reproduced, plays adapted and
performed outside the country
where they originated. As
soon as we examine copyright
from the point of view of its
international application, the
problem becomes even more
complex. For instance, how
can a French musician exer-
cise his rights when one of his
symphonies is performed in
another country ? Clearly, due
consideration for the artist's
rights must be safeguarded in
foreign countries as well as in
his own. If not, what would
happen ?
The creative work, lacking
adequate protection, could be
freely reproduced, its author
receiving no profit at all ;
there is even the possibility of
distortion or wrongful use.
The author is in no position to
take defensive measures.
To widen the sphere of pro-
tection over literary and artis-
tic works in different coun-
tries, international agreements
on copyright have been estab-
lished. But since there are
several of these agreements,
the international protection
of the artist's ownership is not
uniformly assured throughout
the world. In some regions,
there is no protection at all.
A book published in English
by a British citizen in Great
Britain is automatically pro-
tected in the whole of the Bri-
tish Commonwealth, in 22 Eu-
ropean countries, two South
American countries, Israel and
five Arabic-speaking coun-
tries. The same book is also
protected, with reservations, in
seven other countries.
Towards A UniyersaI
Convention
TAKE the case of a book
published in Chile, writ-
ten in Spanish by a
Chilean. If the author has
fulfilled the formalities re-
quired by Chilean legislation,
which include the deposit of
extra copies for each of the
signatory countries to the
Convention of Rio-de-Janeiru,
his rights will be safeguarded
only in ten Latin American
countries, in four European
countries and in three Arabic-
speaking countries.
Foreign works come under
different regulation in almost
every country. Some laws give
equal protection to national
and foreign works Others only
protect works created or pub-
lished on national territory.
Others again give varying
treatment to foreign authors
according to whether or not
they belong to a country with
which an agreement has been
signed.
Such cases give only a par-
tial idea of the confusion that
exists regarding copyright, and
of the need for the work un-
dertaken by Unesco.
This work is not so much
intended to achieve a stan-
dardization of national legisla-
tions, but to unite internatio-
nal conventions now in force
into a single-convention that
will include not only countries
which adhere to existing
agreements but also those
which have so far remained
outside any form of conven-
tion.
