ALMERÍA, with 80,000 inhabitants,
is the capital of the most
southerly - province of eastern
Andalusia. It has been described as
one of the forgotten provinces of Spain.
Its poor communications and the fact
that it lies off ' the beaten track of
trade and tourism have always kept it
somewhat apart from the main
currents of culture in Spain.
' The city has some historic buildings,
such as the magnificent Alcazaba. The
climate is dry (rain is almost unknown)
and the light brilliant. Save in two
fertile valleys watered from the Sierra
Nevada and producing grapes that are
exported all over the world, not a blade .
of grass or a bush is to be found
growing naturally anywhere in the
province. The surplus population re¬
gularly emigrates to other richer and
more prosperous provinces along the
eastern seaboard.
Such was the setting in which, as
part of a general scheme which started
hundreds of libraries in all the pro¬
vinces of Spain, a library was opened
in Almería in 1947.
The new library was named after
one of the province's poets, Francisco
Villaespesa, the poet of the Tierra
Arabe and the last troubadour of
Al'Andalus. Today it contains more
than 30,000 volumes. Even so, it would
not be particularly noteworthy, were it
not for the undoubted influence it has
had on the artistic and cultural life of
the province.
Books began it all
IT began like all libraries : as a
depository for books, with a read¬
ing-room. The reading room was
soon crowded out, for everyone went
there every day. Books were issued on
loan; subscriptions' to reviews were
taken out; and exhibitions were begun.
Thus the library was popular, function¬
al and dynamic; but, as well as that, it
soon became the most effective adult
education centre in the province.
In addition to books, the best media
for the spread of culture were brought
into play films, pictures, concerts,
radio, plays, puppet shows and strip
recordings. There is an auditorium,
separate from the library proper, with
a seating capacity of 250, and here
numerous concerts have been presented
with the best known/ performers of
Spain. These activities have had a
profound effect on the town.
The library has likewise started a
music section which includes some 200
works for quintets and quartets.
Today the whole undertaking has
overflowed from the purely local orbit
and numerous concerts have been given
in the towns of the province where-
ever possible, in their own libraries.

A forgotten Spanish province 'wakes up'
by Tena Artigas
Director Unesco Relations,
Painting in the province has un¬
dergone a profound change since the
founding of the library. Encouraged
by the lectures and discussions on. art
provided, a group of young painters
began to meet at the library. These
young men,' the majority of whom were
poor, constituted a nucleus of pioneer¬
ing artists and writers who have given
a new impetus to artistic life in the
province and have achieved a renown
which in some cases for example
Percival, Capuleto and Alcaraz has
gone beyond the national frontiers.
There is a stylized totem in Almeria
of great antiquity, which looks rather
like a silhouette of a man with a
skipping-rope but is in fact the figure

. of a man or god holding in his hands
the rainbow which foretells fan-
weather. This symbol the group re¬
vived and called "Indalo", a gipsy
corruption of "Indalecio", the com¬
monest name in Almeria. Saint In¬
dalecio, one of the six "apostles" of
Spain, landed a few kilometres away
at Urci, the modern Pechina; and the
Christianization of the peninsula began
from there.
The "Indalics" believe that they too
have an evangel to proclaim, a new
aesthetic to preach, and it was in the
Francisco Villaespesa library that the
new movement came to life. Later
they were called to Madrid by the
philosopher Eugenio D'Ors who
arranged an exhi¬
bition of their
works in the Na¬
tional Museum of
Modern Art. To¬
day several of
them have achiev¬
ed success and
their works, which
always bear as well
as their signatu¬
res, the dancing
silhouette of the
genie of the south,
can be found in
Madrid, Paris,
Rome or Buenos
Aires. Many others
of the group have
remained in Alme¬
ria and the Fran¬
cisco Villaespesa
library is still their
meeting place.
Of the 31 lectu¬
res given in the
library during the
present academic
year, a . number
have been on topi¬
cal subjects the

always very well

public. Some of

known contemporary authors and
composers.
Within three years of its foundation,
the library had 17 branch libraries in
full operation, and 12 travelling libra¬
ries through which it has been possible
to get books to the most distant corners
of the province.
The work of the library has won the
interest of the provincial population at
every level, from the governor (who
initiated the idea and provided the
money for - the building) to those to
whom any form of cultural activity is
normally most alien.
A Society of Friends of the Library
was founded and now has 500 mem¬
bers. This was the first association in
the city with a' purely cultural objec¬
tive. The public have a decisive say
in the library's administration.
Each year new services are set up,
drawing all citizens more closely into
the library's activities and reflecting
their desires.
Cultural 'irrigation'
OTHER departments are a biblio¬
graphical information service from
which data can be secured by
letter, by telephone or by personal visit,
a periodicals library and micro-film
service, the provincial copyright re¬
gister and the legal deposit of printed
matter.
The press and the two broadcasting
stations of the locality are constantly
used to arouse the interest of the
population and draw . attention to
. the library's various services.
Thirty thousand volumes have been
distributed over the 20 branch libraries.
They receive about 200 reviews; and
the number of readers rose from 4,224
in 1947, to 149,235 by 1952.
Those of us who, from outside, have
followed the surprising growth of this
model library, believe that many
factors contributed to it and made it
possible the perfect interlocking of
effort, the help and interest of the
authorities, the enthusiasm of those in
charge, and perhaps the fact of having
hit on the method which best suited the
special outlook of the populace. What
is certain is that its cultural work was
as readily absorbed in the district, and
has had as beneficial an effect, as would
be water coming to irrigate its dry
fields. Some of the fruits of the
library's efforts for instance the work
of the "Indalic" painters can, like the
district's splendid grapes, be exported,
and the library is as much a symbol of
hope as the rainbow skipping-rope
which the prehistoric totem "holds in
its hands.
