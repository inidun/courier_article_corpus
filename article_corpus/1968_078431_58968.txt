SAVING OUR HERITAGE
A World-wide Challenge

These colossal stone figures (above, on
Easter Island in the central Pacific; right,
at Tula, Mexico) are impressive monuments
to two ancient civilizations, unknown or
unappreciated for centuries but now
treasured as part of the rich cultural
heritage of both countries. On Easter
Island the Chilean Government is launching
a vast programme, in co-operation with
Unesco, of archaeological research,
monument restoration and tourist
development (see map page 8). The island
has about 150 ancient stone platforms on
which there are from one to 15 statues.
Until 1960, the seven shown here, each
over four metres high and weighing 15 tons,
were half burled in the earth. The Island
will be systematically explored by
archaeologists for further remains that will
throw light on its early history. Ninth-century
basalt figures (right) from Tula, ancient
capital of the Toltecs, central Mexico, once
supported the roof of a temple dedicated to
the planet Venus. Exploration of Toltec
remains began only 30 years ago.

HIROSHI DAIFUKU, a member of the Unesco
Secretariat since 1954, is head of the Section
for the Development of the Cultural Heritage.
He formerly taught in the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology at the University
of Wisconsin (U.S.A.) and was curator of
anthropological exhibitions at the State His¬
torical Society Museum of Wisconsin. He
is the author of many studies on anthro¬
pology, conservation and museography. One
of his most recent, "The Significance of
Cultural Property", appeared in "The Conser¬

elsewhere in thousands of others of
equal or lesser importance, has been
a matter of chance, but today threats
to the existence of all sites and monu¬
ments are steadily increasing.
Even in the past, for varied reasons,
efforts were made to preserve histor¬
ically and artistically important sites
and monuments. Their continued
existence served to inspire and contri¬
bute to the development of later civil¬
izations.
During the 14th Century, for exam¬
ple, the Italian Renaissance derived
much of its inspiration from Classic
Greece and Rome. The rise of human¬
ism which resulted eventually contri¬
buted to the climate leading towards
the voyages of discovery and an inter¬
est in science, thus changing the
history of the world. Subsequent
discoveries of the past, Pompeii and
Herculaneum, Ancient Egypt, Mycenae,
Babylon and Nineveh, and of the
"lost" cities in tropical forests in
Yucatan, Cambodia, and elsewhere
stimulated imagination.

Early archaeologists were partially
motivated by curiosity and were par¬
tially treasure hunters. The measure
of their success was the amount of
material they could find which could
be sold to collectors, or accumulated
for museums.
Many objects were, of course, in
fragmentary condition and brought
less on the market. The restorer, part
craftsman, part forger, then carried
out his trade. Parts of different statues
were assembled together and breaks
skilfully concealed. Pottery fragments
were sawn apart and reassembled
to make wholes, fakes were made and
sold to the credulous and some were
so skilful that even experts were
taken in.
At the same time, even when legiti¬
mately found, many objects which had
lain undisturbed for centuries began
to disintegrate upon exposure to air
and the restorer also applied his skills
to arrest such changes.
Interest also developed in the
conservation of sites and monuments.
In France, Vio!let-le-Duc (1814-1879)
initiated programmes for the conser¬
vation of national monuments, particu¬
larly of the medieval period, and was
responsible for the restoration and
reconstruction of the Cathedral of
Notre-Dame and other Gothic master¬
pieces as well as of assemblages of
historic buildings, and towns such as
Carcassonne.
However, at this early date archi¬
tects frequently replaced missing ele¬
ments some of which had not even
existed in the historic building and
the amount of rebuilding frequently
resulted In a monument "as good as
new" if not "better" than the old.
A counter movement developed,
partially based on romanticism, to
preserve the appearance if not to
enhance the look of age of objects
of art and of monuments. Again a
reaction occurred against such decep¬
tive practices, and during the early
20th century, restorers instead of
renewing the old or faking the
appearance of age separated the old
from the new by restored areas so
that pottery, statuary or buildings all
had a patched look.
Today, a compromise is usually
sought where the restored sections
blend in with the old, but close inspec¬
tion reveals the restored areas. Care¬
ful records of restoration are also the
rule, amply documented with photo¬
graphs for the use of the scholar and
the specialist.
The manner of presentation is,
however, only one aspect of restora¬
tion. Sites and monuments, as with
all material things, are subject to
change and degradation. Objects
which are recovered from archaeolog¬
ical excavation may have rested for
centuries in a very stable environment.
Upon exposure and perhaps transport
to a new environment, the object or
the monument is once more subject
to diurnal and seasonal changes of
temperature, humidity and, in tempe¬
rate zones, the action of frost.

SAVING OUR HERITAGE (Continued)
The bulldozer in the path of history
As a result, exfoliation, or flaking
of stone and brick surfaces takes
place. Wood and other organic mater¬
ials are even more friable, and what
may appear to the inexperienced eye
to be solid when first found, rapidly
shrinks, warps or crumbles after
recovery.
Natural processes of the conversion
of stone to soil, such as the action
of moulds and bacteria, the growth
of roots of woody plants, also contri¬
bute to the destruction of sites and
monuments. Added to this are the
effects of the atmosphere. Free
oxygen and naturally occurring gases
such as carbon dioxide (which forms
carbonic acid with rain water) all
contribute to the process of weather¬
ing.
A new dimension has been added
with industrialization however. The
combustion of fossil fuels has added
a host of other compounds which
are not only deleterious to human
health, but also attack stones, wood,
glass and other building materials.
Solutions of nitrous and nitric acids,
of sulphurous and sulphuric acids,
diluted though they are, react with
the compounds making up the mate¬
rials used in construction. Limestone
and marble, sandstone and other soft
stones, wood and other organic mater¬
ial used for building purposes reveal
the results of atmospheric contamina¬
tion. With time even the more resis¬
tant materials are subject to attack.
s<

JOCIAL and economic
forces also affect the scene. Warfare
is a conspicuous cause for destruction,
but more insidious and equally if not
more dangerous to our cultural
heritage are all of the many elements
which contribute to material progress.
The roar of bulldozers, the crash
of wreckers at work, mark the dis¬
appearance of many historically or
artistically important buildings, as they
remove old neighbourhoods, to be
replaced by the still waters of an
impounded lake, a broad highway, or
the impersonal frontage of a glass-
sheathed multi-storied office building
or apartment house.
Monuments and sites, officially pro¬
tected by the State, may survive as
lonely archaisms within a complex of
modern buildings with all sense of
their scale and importance lost.
Squares which were once designed
to set off public buildings or served to
enhance the prestige of important
families and trading houses are now
filled with motor cars and serve as
car parks. The rumble of lorries, the
passage of trams or large buses
provoke vibrations which also contri¬
bute towards the deterioration of old
buildings not designed to meet such
stresses.
Since the end of World War II there
has been a tremendous rise in indus¬
trialization and in population. Changes
have been 'taking place oh an
unprecedented scale and never as
before has our cultural heritage been
so menaced. Inevitably Unesco's
programme for the conservation of
cultural property has been influenced
by this threat, and over the coq'rse
of years a coherent programme has
been developed.
Perhaps the firsj: Unesco interna¬
tional project of importance in this
field was the sponsorship of the "In¬
ternational Convention on the Protec¬
tion of Cultural Property in the Event
of Armed Conflict", adopted at the
Hague in 1954 and now ratified by
57 Member States.
Other international instruments
include Recommendations of the
General Conference to Member States
on: international principles applicable
to archaeological excavations, adopted
in 1956; safeguarding the beauty and
character of landscapes and sites,
adopted in 1962. A Recommendation
on "the preservation of cultural
property endangered by public and
private works" is to be submitted to
the General Conference in November
of this year for adoption.
In 1950 an earthquake destroyed
much of the ancient Inca and Spanish
Colonial capital of Cuzco in Peru and
a team oT experts was sent to advise
on a programme of reconstruction
the first Unesco project to aid a mem¬
ber state in conservation. Subse¬
quently the despatch of experts,
awards of fellowships and equipment
became part of the regular programme
of Unesco.
<
Missions were undertaken to exam¬
ine and recommend treatment on the
stones of Persepolis, on the preser¬
vation of the mural paintings at Bon-
ampak in Mexico, on the problems
of the desalinization of Mohenjo-Daro
in Pakistan, on the preservation of the
tesserae making up the mosaics found
in Morocco, on restoring statuary in
Libya, on the restoration of monuments
in Afghanistan, on factors contributing
to the deterioration of the stones in
the Borobudur monument (see p. 23),
on the restoration of frescoes in
Yugoslavia, on problems of the pre¬
servation of the wall paintings of the
Thracian tomb at Kazanluk in Bul¬
garia (see page 35), etc.
Since January 1965, Unesco conser¬
vation and restoration missions have
been sent to 33 countries (see world
map pages 8-9).
These missions have underlined the
Palace guards advance in
serried rank in this striking
te!ephoto picture of one
of the famed stone friezes
at Persepolis, 2,500 years
ago the capital of the
Achaemenian rulers of the
Persian Empire. Over
the years each successive
king added some new
edifice to the splendid
ensemble of palaces and
adjacent royal tombs (see
"Unesco Courier",
December 1966). Modern
Iran sees in Persepolis the
continuity of its national
heritage, and conservation
of its monuments (and
in some cases their
restoration) has a high
priority in Iran's
programme to "safeguard
historic and cultural
treasures, now being
carried out in co-operation
witch Unesco. Under this
programme, at Persepolis
itself," excavations and
conservation work are now
being carried out by an
Italian mission led by
Professor Giuseppe Tucci
of Rome.

fact that today conservation and
restoration are vastly different from
the type of work carried out during
the 19th and early 20th century.
Major scientific laboratories exist de¬
voted to the analysis of factors lead¬
ing to the deterioration of building
materials, paints used, identification
and the best type of treatment against
attacks of moulds and fungi, and a
whole host of synthetics now exist for
the consolidation and repair of cultural
property.
The data is so great in quantity
that one of the most important func¬
tions of the International Centre for
the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property in
Rome (established by Unesco in co¬
operation with the Government of Italy
with 34 Member States), is to act as

a clearing house for this sort of infor¬
mation as otherwise even the spe¬
cialist cannot keep up with the flood
of information and new products.
The results of the missions under¬
lined the need for improved training
facilities since the number of trained
personnel is far below the required
level and new projects are now under
way to meet this need (1).
The reports of the experts served
as a basis for "first-aid" action. In
(1) The Rome Centre, in co-operation with
the University of Rome, now has a course
to train architect-restorers. A training labor¬
atory is being planned for 1969-1970. Two
non-governmental organizations have worked
closely With Unesco in the programme for
the enhancement of sites 'and monuments,
including the recruitment of experts. They
are the International Council of Monuments
and Sites and the International Union of
Official Tourist Organizations.
some instances national services were
started, whose staff were trained as
a result of Unesco missions and the
co-operative effort of bilateral aid.
Nevertheless, the effect was piece¬
meal, for whenever a meaningful pro¬
gramme was discussed the sums
involved were so important running
into millions of dollars that most
countries could not afford to carry
out the work required. Besides, there
were many other priorities, such
as increasing food production, improv¬
ing educational facilities, introducing
industrialization, all of which would
contribute to the material benefit of
the peoples concerned.
Meanwhile, public works of vast
importance, the building of dams for
irrigation and the development of
power, the demolition of old buildings
to make place for new structures, the
replacement of old historic bridges by
new bridges capable of carrying
several lanes of automobiles continued
apace.
The decision of the United Arab
Republic to construct the High Dam
near Aswan was one of hundreds of
similar decisions. However, the Nu¬
bian-area of the Nile was marked by
many sites and monuments including
the rock-cut temple built by Rameses
II at Abu Simbel.
In 1959 the United Arab Republic,
followed by the Republic of the Sudan,
requested the aid of Unesco in under¬
taking an extensive programme of
salvage archaeology, and the transfer
of several monuments, including the
possibility of saving the temples of
Abu Simbel.
Unesco agreed and, in answer to

a world appeal in 1960, twenty-four
countries sent teams of archaeologists
which methodically excavated the area
to be submerged. Twenty temples
were transferred and sufficient contri¬
butions received to pay for the cost
of cutting up and re-assembling Abu
Simbel. Unesco is now planning the
salvage of the Temples of Philae,
located between the High Dam and
the. Aswan Dam.
A second dramatic incident happen¬
ed. On November 4, 1966, while
Unesco's General Conference was
meeting in Paris, floods occurred in
Italy, devastating large areas of
Tuscany and Venetia, and submerging
much of the older sections of Florence,
and also the city of Venice. The
dramatic- danger to the works of art in
Florence and to the architectural
treasure of Venice aroused the im¬
agination of the world. On behalf of
Unesco's General Conference the
Director-General launched an inter¬
national campaign for the two cities
and the surrounding areas.
The success of the Nubian Cam¬
paign, the world-wide interest in Flor¬
ence and Venice, strongly affected
Unesco's programme. It demonstrat¬
ed that the peoples of the world are
alive to, and are prepared to respond
to, programmes for the conservation
of our material cultural heritage. The
experience gained also showed that
Unesco, with the support of such
interest, was capable of enlarging its
role and responsibility.
0 NE of the unlooked for
results in the Nubian Campaign was
the rise in tourism in Nubia. Formerly,
only the most adventurous visitor and
the scientist went there. Today fast
hydrofoils, new hotels, and other
services enable thousands to go to
Nubia and as a result there has been
a considerable improvement in the
overall economy of the region.
Coincidentally, constant improve¬
ment in means of travel, increased
leisure, and the ability of people to
afford visits to distant places they had
read of and which, had excited their
imagination, has resulted in a tremen¬
dous growth in tourism. In the so-
called "developed" countries where
tourism is a well established industry
it is by no means a negligible factor.
In the United Kingdom it has been
rated as the fourth most important
industry in the "export" trade and the
biggest dollar earner for several
consecutive years. In other countries
tourism has become the first industry.

megalopolis can teach us
This has meant that those countries
which have important sites and monu¬
ments, or have communities preserv¬
ing traditional styles of architecture
illustrating a way of life which may
have disappeared or is undergoing
rapid change, now can consider them
to be economic assets instead of
costly encumbrances slowing down
progress.
While tourism tends to be seasonal
but patterns are changing so that
all-year tourism is gradually becoming
a reality a number of secondary
effects or fall-out results from invest¬
ments made for tourism. Highways
and airports, besides making sites and
monuments accessible, open new mar¬
kets for local farmers and industry.
New sources of employment result
from the different service industries
such as hotels and restaurants. The
introduction of electricity and mo¬
dern communication also offer
employment for skilled labour and
trained technicians.
I N countries including Iran,
Peru, Indonesia, and many others, this
has meant that the Department of
Antiquities, formerly understaffed,
poorly equipped and lacking a meaning¬
ful budget, is now sustained by the
Ministry in charge of Planning or of
overall Economic Development Pro¬
grammes. Instead of being a "luxu¬
ry", conservation is now becoming, as
it should be (for moral and ethical as
well as economic reasons) a necessi¬
ty. Three patterns are beginning to
develop:
1. Among countries able to finance
such programmes independently, as
one of several other programmes for
the development of their economy,
Unesco's contribution would be either
through its Programme of Participa¬
tion or through the use of funds from
the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme in the form of experts and
fellowships.
2. In some countries, in addition to
missions of experts and fellowships,
Unesco has helped to negotiate inter¬
national financing loans from banks.
3. In some instances there is also
a possibility to develop a project
involving the United Nations Deve¬
lopment Programme and other Specia¬
lized Agencies of the United Nations
such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization, International Labour
Organization, World Health Organi¬
zation and the International Civil Avia¬
tion Organization In which all of the
different elements contributing to
tourism such as the construction of
highways, airports, changing agricul¬
ture pattern, the training of staff, etc.,
can be carried out co-operatively.
The difference between the present
Unesco programme and that of the
past is one of scale. In the case of
Iran, the Government has recently
decided upon a budget of $80 million
for a programme to develop the
infrastructure required (hotels, high¬
ways, etc.) of which over $4 million
will be for the conservation and
monuments including:
in northern Iran: the famous funer¬
ary mosque of the Mongol sultan
Oljaitu Khodabendeh at Soltanieh and
the 11th-century Oara Kilissieh church
at Maku;
in Isfahan: the Jumai mosque and
the Maidan e Shah (Royal Square);
in the province of Fars; the palaces
of Firouzabad and Sarvestan and the
Oala-ye-Dokhtar, or "Castle of the
Daughter".
In turn Unesco will contribute,
through the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme, experts required for
planning and consultations and will
be responsible for the co-ordination
of the different elements involved.
The possibility of the conservation of
sites and monuments as part of an
overall tourism development pro¬
gramme to be financed under the Uni¬
ted Nations Development Programme
and possibly the Banks, is under con¬
sideration in Peru and several other
member states of Unesco. In these
countries the overall budget will also
be substantial and emphasize that the
preservation and the development of
sites and monuments as tourist attrac¬
tions is being considered as central to
programmes which will stimulate the
overall economy.
In countries where tourism is just
beginning to have an effect or where
there is a real potential for its develop¬
ment, a government may be prepared
to invest in the conservation of monu¬
ments and to establish the legislation
and services required to ensure the
investments made. The problem,
paradoxically, may be more serious in
countries from which the experts have
been recruited and where national
legislation and services have existed
for a number of years.
The size of the staff and the budget
at the disposal of the different ser-
. vices are, all too frequently, still
based on requirements of the first
half of the 20th century. Demo¬
graphic, social and economic changes
are taking place on such a scale and
so rapidly that unless the governments
concerned are prepared to adapt to
the requirements of this and the
following decades, ¡rremedia! losses
will occur.
This has been the lesson in mega¬
lopolises such as New York and
Tokyo, and similar losses are taking
place in hundreds of other major
urban centres. Land costs, traffic
requirements, the pattern of real es¬
tate taxes may outweigh tourism as an
economic factor in such large cities.
As a result modern sectors of growing
major cities throughout the world
resemble each other more than they
do the historic quarters within their
boundaries.
B UT is the multi-storied
structure, utilizing standardized ele¬
ments for look-alike buildings, the
most suitable environment for modern
man? Isn't the scale, the variety and
the uniqueness of historically or
artistically important groups of buildings
a more fitting environment for man?
These are part of the problems
involved for the future well being of
man. Too little is known about the
totality which makes up our environ¬
ment. Specialists in air pollution and
land management, biologists working
on the continental shelf, urban plan¬
ners, are all convinced that changes
are taking place very rapidly and that
measures must be taken before it is
too late. Within this totality, the
problem of the conservation of our
heritage also has its part and will be
one of the new Unesco projects pro¬
posed for 1969-1970.
