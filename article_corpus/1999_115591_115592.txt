Ay a c u c h o:
an uneasy calm
n
Aya c u c h o, capital of the Pe ru v i a n
d e p a rtment of the same name, s t i l l
lives on edge nearly 20 years after the
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guer-
rillas first went into action there. Relief ove r
the guerri l l a s ’d e f e at is matched by the ten-
sion of an “ a rmed peace” maintained by the
continued presence of underground ele-
ments of this terr o rist organization in nearby
districts and provinces.
Also known as Huamanga, the name
gi ven to the city by the Spaniards when they
founded it on 29 Ja n u a ry 1539, Aya c u c h o
sits 2,752 metres up in a lush valley in the
we s t e rn cordillera of the A n d e s. Its 100,000
inhabitants share a double heri t a g e ,s p e a k i n g
the Quechua language and living in accor-
dance with Indian traditions, i rr e s p e c t i ve
of social class.The local elite has managed
to preserve this tradition of cultural duality,
avoiding the social discri m i n ation which
has marred it elsewhere in Pe ru .

tage with a rich musical tradition blending
the sounds of Andean h u ay n o dance music
with a distinct romantic element of Spanish
origin.At no time is the city more vibrant
than during Holy We e k , when Chri s t i a n
and Indian religious devotion reaches its
apogee in Aya c u c h o ’s 37 churches, ( o f fic i a l l y
there are 33, to match the age of Christ at
his death).
The festival was cancelled for seve r a l
years for fear of bombs and ambushes and
because the curfew ruled out after-dark
processions, but it bounced back in 1993,
after the capture of the Shining Pat h ’s
leader, Carlos Abimaël Guzmán, on Sep-
tember 12, 1992.
Major historical landmarks are dotted
around the city, and include the Pampa de
Q u i n u a , site of the Battle of Ayacucho which
clinched Latin A m e ri c a ’s independence
from Spain.The battlefield is now shaking
off its military associations to stress cul-
tural activities, including the Encuentro de
Teatro, which hosts theatre groups from all
over the world.

But the restored festive spirit and the
r e t u rn to an almost normal daily life cannot
hide the wounds left by years of terror and
v i o l e n c e . New social problems have cropped
up as some of the city’s youth have joined
the dozen of gangs which at t a c k , rob 
and kill.They’re mostly made up of young
men who have had close brushes with the
g u e rri l l a s , to whom in many cases they have
lost a family member.
There is also the problem of the desti-
tute refugees from guerrilla violence who
h ave invaded the city, where they now prefer
to stay rather than risk returning to the
u n c e rtainty of their rural homes. T h e
d e p a rtment of Ayacucho was by far the

3,000 more disappeared and 170,000 we r e

the total population.
The cradle of many cultures and a city of

still a state of emergency in Huamanga pro-

some constitutional rights are suspended
and the army has free rein to search public
buildings and private houses.
Strolling through the quiet streets of Aya-
cucho under a cloudless sky, you would think
nothing could prevent the return of peace.B u t
until the inhabitants can once again exe r c i s e
their basic rights and steps are taken to reduce
