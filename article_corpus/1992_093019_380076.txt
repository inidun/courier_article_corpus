HOLLOWED out of tree-trunks, the
pirogues lie at rest on the
silvery-grey sand beneath
the whispering, shiny-leafed
coconut palms. Children play
around huts made of banco, a
mixture of clay and bamboo, and
roofed with leaves. This is Houakpé,
a village on the Atlantic coast of
Benin, some sixty kilometres west
of Cotonou, near Ouidah, and not
far from the Togolese border. In
lanuary 1988, Alain Courtel spent
his holiday in Benin, but it was not
mere chance that brought him to
Houakpé. Back home in Guérande,
a small French town in the depart-

ment ofLoire-Atlantique, Alain had
spent fifteen years working in the
salt-marshes and he knew the
Atlantic ocean had two "salt peoples"
specializing in ocean-salt extrac¬
tion his fellow citizens ofGuérande
and the people in the Ouidah area.
He was also extremely interested in
the environment and development.
Alain Courtel brought with him
addresses, postcards of the Gué¬
rande marshes and a densimeter.
He toured the villages, collected
information and met Matthias Toffi,
a geographer who had left univer¬
sity to work in the field. He learned
that the region was very poor, that
fishing was in decline, that the
women ofthe village were worn out
by the exhausting labour of salt
extraction, and that supplies of the
fuelwood used in the salt-extraction
process were running out.
Courtel was surprised to learn that
salt extraction should need anywood
at all. Apparently, the methods used
locally were very different from those
he knew. In Guérande, sea-water
brought in by high tides is chan¬
nelled into shallow reservoirs
through a system ofsmall conduits.
The water then heats up and some of
it evaporates. The remaining solu¬
tion, which has a higher salt concen¬
tration, is fed bygravity into a second
basin and finally ends up in "crys¬
tallizing pans". The salt is gathered
daily from Tune to October. Each pan
yields an average of one tonne of
salt. In Guérande, about 200 salt-
marsh workers produce 10,000
tonnes of salt per year, sometimes
twice that amount in good years, like
1989. This is achieved using hardly
any tools and without harming the
environment in any way.
In Benin, the centuries-old salt-
production tradition seemed per¬
fectly satisfactory, but it turned out to
have a devastating impact on the
environment. In the dry season, the
Ouéoué lagoon recedes completely.
During that period, while the men go
fishing, the women scrape up the
salt-permeated soil, put it into large
baskets and then rinse the earth-
and-salt mixture several times with
water. An orange-coloured brine col¬
lects in bowls or calabashes placed
under the baskets. This is then
poured into a large pot built into an
"improved stove", that is, one that
needs much less fuel because it has
only one opening for the introduc¬
tion ofwood.
There may be as many as three
stoves under the roofofa single, dark
hut. Outside the heat is intense,
inside it is unbearable. Yet the
women and the children stand over
the boiling liquid, stirring it with
sticks, so that the water evaporates
more quickly. "It takes three hours of
boiling to get four kilos of salt,"
explained Toffi. To produce 135 kilo¬
grams of salt means burning one
cubic metre ofwood.
The best wood, the kind thatburns
slowly and generates practically no
ashes, comes from mangroves.
These strange-looking swamp-trees
with their exposed, stilt-like roots
reaching down into the muddy
swamp water form a forest fringe
along the shoreline and provide a
spawning ground for the fish that
dart in and out of the tangle of their
roots. By the time Courtel visited the
region, however, the mangroves
were so depleted that the women
had either to walk six to ten kilo¬
metres to fetch wood, or to buy
bundles of firewood for a small for¬
tune compared to the price that
could be obtained for the salt. About
2,000 people, mostly women, were
producing from one to one and a
half tonnes per family annually.
Courtel told Toffi about Gué¬
rande. "Where I live, in Brittany," he
explained, "they say salt is born of
the sun and the wind	 Here, it is
bom offire". Realizing all the advan¬
tages of eliminating the use of
wood the mangrove swamp would
be renewed and the fish would
return Toffi agreed to carry out an
experiment.
In the summer of 1988, the
PIRATTES project was launched.

techniques traditionnelles d'extrac¬
tion de sel, which is French for "inte¬
grated research project on the im¬
provement of traditional salt-
extraction techniques". The project
was financed by the French Co-ope¬
ration Mission, the French Ministry
of Co-operation, the French Anti-
Hunger Committee, the Fondation
de France and the region ofLa Baule,
in Brittany, France. In charge of the
project were the Guérande salt pro¬
ducers' group, the Benin scientific
and technical research centre and
the Association of Volunteers for
Progress a splendid example of
North-South co-operation founded
in friendship and seeking simple
solutions adapted both to the envi¬
ronment and to the conditions of
local daily life. Alain Courtel went
home to Brittany to tend to his crop
of salt, and came back to Benin in
October for a five-month stay, bring¬
ing a fellow salt-marsh worker with
him.
The first step was to meet the
Dagbo Hou-non, high priest of the
sea and chiefofthe voodoo medicine
men. Escorted by Toffi, Courtel
introduced himself as a "servant of
salt", and received a favourable wel¬
come. The next step was to get down
to work. He began by digging two
small basins in the village ofLanhou,
located at Boca del Rio, the mouth of
the river. This was no simple task.
The clay content of the soil, which
was different from the soil in
Guérande, was not homogeneous.
There were other problems: the air
humidity, the lightness of the wind,
the irregular flow ofthe tides, varia¬
tion in the salinity of the lagoon
water, and the tunnels made by little
sea-crabs known as toklins.
These difficulties were com¬
pounded by those inherent in any
yovo (White) project in Africa.
Geneviève Delbos, ethnologist at the
French National Scientific Research
Centre, who followed the experi¬
ment, explains: "The work pro¬
gressed in fits and starts due to the
fact that the salt-marsh workers had
to learn to adapt to both the phy¬
sical and the human environment
in which this collaborative effortwas
taking place. This was exacerbated
by the complexity of human rela¬
tionships in a culturewhere personal
joys and sorrows and social and
natural upheavals are always given a
traditional interpretation in terms
of the occult forces at play that are
manipulated by those who have the
fearsome and feared power of
'commanding' them."
Benin is the cradle of voodoo, a
magical country where, probably
more than anywhere else in Africa,
conciliation with the supernatural
is indispensable. One night, the
lagoon was suddenly breached, leav¬
ing a gap through which the ocean
rushed in, flooding the salt basins.
The first month's work was ruined.
There was only one solution left to
fill the salt basins with the brine the
women had collected from under
their large baskets full ofsalty earth.
The two technologies combined
beautifully.
Not everybody was totally
convinced, however. Marguerite, a
midwife who gathers salt when she is
not delivering babies, was sceptical.
We met her on a small island in the
lagoon, with two shallow basins near
the hut containing the furnace that
Marguerite's son fired with dried
palm leaves. One of the basins was
lined with a sheet of bright blue
plastic, the other with a thick layer of
clay. She picked up a fistful ofcrystals
that had formed in two months: "The
white man comes, he tells you what
to do, then he goes away. We don't
like this salt, it's too coarse. It has to
be ground." All the same, she had
agreed to try the system. But she was
too tired to attend the big party
PIRATTES threw in March to cele¬
brate the first bag ofsalt produced as
a result of the co-operative effort.
The following week, the Dagbo
Hou-non himself came to visit. He
was given an offering of djè, which is
"salt" in Fon, one of the most widely
spoken languages in Benin. He took
the opportunity to remind every¬
body that the lagoon forests were
holy and called on the voodoo spirits
to be kindly disposed to PIRATTES.
In 1992, the association was
honoured with the Technologiesans
frontières award, the highest prize
offered in the Enterprise and
Environment competition organized
by the Commission of the European
Communities.
