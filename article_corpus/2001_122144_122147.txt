ooking down on the islands and straits of
I n d o n e s i a ’s Komodo National Park from
a rickety turboprop plane, the scenery
seems timeless. From the air, the coral-
studded seas and palm-tree-dotted grass-
lands look much as they have for centu-
r i e s. If not for a few wooden fishing boats,
the primordial scene of stark landscapes
ruled by giant reptiles could almost be
something out of Jurassic Park.
But landing just east of the park, t h e r e
can be no doubt that we are in 21st-cen-
tury Indonesia.Outside the tiny Labuan-
bajo airport, protesters are exercising
their newly-won political freedoms to
demand that the regent in charge of this
part of the province hear their call for
greater local autonomy before he steps on
the twice-weekly flight out of town. I n s i d e,
a glossy display from the U. S. - b a s e d
Nature Conservancy (TNC) alerts new
arrivals to the tremendous diversity of
Komodo’s reefs and the many threats to
t h e m , from anchors to bombs to cy a n i d e.
With their bewildering array of
c o l o u r s, s h a p e s, textures and behaviours,
I n d o n e s i a ’s psychedelic reefs leave fir s t -
time visitors, even experienced scuba
d i v e r s, s l a c k - j a w e d . Komodo National
Park alone is home to 250 species of reef-
building corals and 1,000 fish species—
more than the entire Caribbean. Coral
reefs are tremendously important for the
people of Indonesia, providing half of
the animal protein in the national diet.
With more underwater species and more
people living near reefs than in any other
n a t i o n , the stakes are high in the struggle

CORALS UNDER SIEGE

to stop the destructive fishing practices
that constitute the biggest threat to the
country’s coral reefs.
Most Indonesian fishers use simple,
low-impact techniques like hand-held
lines or small nets suspended from
bagan, the graceful, square-platformed
crafts whose lonely kerosene lanterns
dot the horizon at night throughout eas-
tern Indonesia.But a minority of  fis h e r s
make big money—often four times a
government official’s salary—by squir-
ting cyanide or throw-
ing home-made bottle bombs, b o t h
brutally effective means to catch fis h
and kill reefs. Blast fishing has already
affected four- fif t h s
of the nation’s
r e e f s.Though these
practices are ill-
e g a l , laws against
them are seldom
enforced by Indo-
n e s i a ’s underfund-
ed and often cor-
rupt authorities.
Yet a few large national parks and
small community-based reserves are suc-
ceeding in slowing down destruction of
these habitats. Routine boat patrols,
begun by authorities in 1996 with assis-
tance from T N C ’s Indonesia Programme,
have reduced fish bombing in Komodo by
roughly 80 percent.In 2000,a new “floa-
ting ranger station,” funded by the area’s
scuba diving operators and TNC, made
two mass arrests in its first weeks of ope-
r a t i o n .The patrols have been controver-
s i a l , dividing local communities between
those who welcome the protection of eco-
nomically important reefs and those who
resent the intrusion of a wealthy Ame-
rican NGO.
Reef-protection efforts have been
more of a hit with local communities
around Bunaken National Park in North
Sulawesi province.Members of the North
Sulawesi Watersports Association charge
a US$5 tax per scuba diver to fund reef
patrols and have started scholarship and
handicraft marketing programmes for
communities in the
park.“We pay the
police approxima-
tely $250 for a two-
day patrol and
have gotten two
big busts for bomb
fis h i n g,possibly the
first in Indonesia.
And the local com-
munity actually supports it,” explains bio-
logist Mark Erdmann, who works as an
adviser to the park and with the water
sports association.
Some North Sulawesi villages have
taken matters into their own hands, s e i z i n g
the opportunity for community involve-
ment in resource management presented
by Indonesia’s ongoing r e f o r m a s i, o r
d e c e n t r a l i z a t i o n ,p r o c e s s. In late 1998, t h e
villagers of Blongko set aside six hectares
of degraded coral reefs and mangroves
as the first community-run marine sanc-
tuary in Indonesia. Less than a year later,
local fisheries have already made a noti-
ceable recovery.
“ We started the sanctuary to bring
the fishing back to how it was in the past,”
explains Blongko’s village head, D o l v i
Ja n i s.“ N o w, for the first time in years, w e
can even cast a line from the beach near
the sanctuary and catch a pelagic [open-
ocean] fish.”
Two other Sulawesi villages have since
established their own marine sanctua-
ries, and all 13 coastal villages in Blong-
ko’s district want to establish their own
reserves. No-fishing reserves, even small
o n e s, let fish recover so dramatically that
they spill over to adjacent areas,a c t u a l l y
allowing more fishing to occur than
before the reserve was established.
The community-run reserves to date
are quite small compared with national
parks like Ko m o d o,but they can be repli-
cated widely at low cost.If the reformasi
and international conservation forces on
display in Labuanbajo airport combine to
support them,even these small reserves
have big potential to help Indonesia’s
r e e f s,fis h e r i e s, and coastal villages flo u r i s h
into the future. ■
Komodo National Park is seeking to attract more ecotourists to its underwater treasures.
“For the first time in
years, we can cast 
a line from the beach
and catch a pelagic
fish.”
