UNESCO CREATES KALINGA FILM PRIZE
32
I InESCO has instituted an award of £2,000 sterling for
" a feature-length film contributing "most effectively to
public appreciation of an outstanding achievement in
education, science and culture, resulting from international
co-operation." To be known henceforth as the Kalinga
Film Prize, the first award, for 1961-62, went to "In the
Bay of the White Bears", a Polish film by Jaroslav
Brzozowski about polar research during the International
Geophysical Year. A French film, "Le Grand Secret" by
Gerald Calderón received special mention.
Like the Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science
created in 1951, the new award is a donation from
Mr. Bijoyanand Patnaik, Chief Minister of the State of
Orissa in India, and one of the directors of the Kalinga
Foundation, set up to give full support to economic
development and social and cultural progress in Orissa.
Films were submitted by Australia, Belgium, Finland,
France, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, the United
Kingdom and the U.S.S.R., and were viewed by an inter¬
national jury appointed by Unesco, comprising Mr. F. L.
Ammannati, President of the Centro Sperimentale di
Cinematographia, Mr. Boris Milev, Permanent Delegate of
Bulgaria to Unesco, Mr. Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, film
director in Argentina and H.R.H. Prince Prem. Purachatra,
President of the Mass Communication Committee of the
National Commission of Thailand for Unesco.
