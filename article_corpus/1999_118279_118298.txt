At midnight on December 31, t h e
world will enter the year 2000. Fo r
months, sometimes years, plans have
been made to celebrate this special New
Ye a r ’s Eve , especially in the Chri s t i a n
world.But what,if anything, does the date
mean to non-Christians?
“December 31 may herald a new year,
a new century and a new millennium, but
for me it’ll just be a normal day,” says an
amused P. B a l a s u b r a m a n i a n , the chief
accountant of a large firm in the Indian city
of Madras.
For a large part of humanity, the arri va l
of the year 2000 will pass completely unno-
t i c e d . But because globalization means fol-
l owing trends or simply because there is
money to be made, m a ny people have yielded
to the temptation to join the festivities.
Marketing 
the millennium
In India,a d ve rtising razzmatazz orches-
trated by millennium marketeers has rea-
ched most of the populat i o n , thanks to
satellite television. New Delhi is staging a
“Millennium Night Celebration”.Railway
s t at i o n m a s t e rs will blow their whistles to
send trains off on prestigious trips around
the sub-continent. In most of India’s major
tourist centres,from Agra, Khajuraho and
Jaipur,all the hotels are booked up.Yet for
m a ny Indians, mostly Hindus, there is
really little to get worked up about.
According to the V i k ram Samvat, t h e
calendar of the Hindus and Sikhs of nor-
thern and western India, we are already in
the year 2055, while the Shaka, the coun-
t ry ’s most widely used Hindu calendar,
only clocks up 1920. As Indian Catholics
mark the end of 1999, Buddhists will be
e n j oying the year 2542 and Muslims the
year 1420 of the Hegira.A hundred years
a g o, according to another ancient Hindu
c a l e n d a r , the sixth millennium of the
K a l i y u ga era began, supposedly the wo r l-
d’s last (see box).
When all’s said and done, only the we a l-
thiest and most westernized Indians really
feel concerned by the millennium celebra-
tions. “It’s a legacy of colonial times and a
product of marketing,” s ays Bhupinder
S i n g h , a practising Sikh who has retired
from the higher civil service and become a
bu s i n e s s m a n . But he admits he has gone
along with it all. He is promoting Pa k i s t a n ’s
most famous classical singer, S h a f q at A l i
K h a n , in India with the slogan “The Star of
the Millennium”.
Another “ s t a r ” is the island of Kat c h a l l ,
one of the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of
B e n g a l , which will be the first place in India
to see the sunrise on New Ye a r ’s Day 2000.
The ministry of culture is cashing in on the
event (as well as making up for India’s lack
of infrastructure) by inviting seven luxury
ships from all over the world to anchor off
the Nicobar Islands for the big moment.
Other ships are being encouraged to
go to Tonga, in the middle of the Pacific
near the international dateline. To attract
them, Tongan King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV
has decreed a switch to summer daylight
saving time on October 3, thereby gaining
14 hours over Greenwich Mean Time
(GMT) and making the archipelago the
first place on earth to enter the “third mil-
lennium”. This kind of thing has been
done in the past. When Pope Gregory
XIII shortened the year 1582 by 10 days
as part of his reform of the Julian calen-
dar, it meant that St Teresa of Avila died
during the night of the 4th to the . . . 15th
of October.
Weddings and marathons
The U. S . M a rine Observat o ry in T h a i-
land has put forward the controve rsial theory
t h at the sun will rise at 7 a.m. on Ja n u a ry 1
a b ove the frontier between Mya n m a r
( B u rma) and Thailand and that this will be
“the best place in the world to see in the mil-
l e n n i u m .” But while the Thais have a front
s e at for the big show, they may be giving it a
m i s s. Like Laos, C a m b o d i a , M yanmar and
S ri Lanka,Thailand is a country where T h e-
r avada Buddhism is practised; it celebrat e d
its third millennium 543 ye a rs ago. W h at ’s
m o r e ,Thailand marks the new year in mid-
A p ri l ,d u ring S o n g k ra n, the water festiva l .
All the same, some attempts are being
made to stir up enthusiasm for the ye a r
2000.The Tourism Authority of Thailand
( TAT) is organizing events with a “new mil-
l e n n i u m ” tag—millennium weddings for
2,000 couples, a millennium marathon and
a big seaside concert . But in Southeast
Asia, which is struggling to recover from a
t wo - year economic cri s i s , the “new millen-
nium”is on the whole generating little real
interest or extravagant projects. TAT says
there has been a 30 per cent increase in

hotel reservations for December compared
with December 1998, but nearly all of them
have been by foreigners.
Japan has followed the We s t e rn calendar
since 1873, as part of the modern i z at i o n
process it embarked on during the Meiji
Era. Until then, the country had used the
lunar-solar Ta i i n t a i yo r e k i calendar dat i n g
from the Nara Era (645-794), Ja p a n e s e
civilization’s golden age. For nearly a cen-
t u ry, t h o u g h , the Ja p a n e s e , especially those
living in the countryside, went on celebra-
ting the “old”New Year as well as the new
o n e .And since tradition demands that time
is measured again from zero whenever a
new emperor comes to the throne, the Ja p a-
nese followed three different calendars at
the same time.
These days the Ta i i n t a i yo r e k i is only
o b s e rved by a few sentimental folk and
New Year is celebrated on December 31.
But though calendars come and go, tradi-
tions remain. And so the Japanese will be
marking the New Year as their ancestors
d i d , with ancient games and decorat i o n s ,
f o rmal clothes and special “ l u c k y ” f o o d
dishes.
One we l l - k n own restaurateur has
announced grandly he will make a Tale of
G e n j i m e a l , r e f e rring to a famous 1,000-
year-old classic nove l . On the menu will be
35 dishes for four gourmets. All for a mere
$8,000. More accessible will be the wildly
popular television programme Kohaku Uta
G a s s e n, a contest between the ye a r ’s best
male and female singers,which most Japa-
nese watch eve ry December 31—especially
this year when the Y2K computer bug will
encourage people to stay at home.

with typical panache in China.Beijing city

by generous donors in Hong Kong, to bu i l d

bition halls,has cost some $24 million and
mobilized some 200 architects and art his-
t o ri a n s.The rotating altar, 47 metres across,
has a huge stage which can accommodate
more than a thousand singers and dancers.
You enter it through a 300-metre-long
“ Tunnel of T i m e ” , d e c o r ated inside with
bronze reliefs showing scenes from the
country’s 5,000-year history.
But the older generation prefer to wait
until February to celebrate the start of the
Year of the Dragon, and remote provinces
will mostly ignore the fuss about the third
m i l l e n n i u m .Young people howe ver can’t
wait for New Ye a r ’s Eve , and brush aside
the rebukes of the ardent defenders of the
Chinese calendar who publicly oppose this
“biblical” anniversary, as well as the insis-
tence of astronomers, who have taken the
matter seriously and are trying to explain
t h at the new millennium will not in fa c t
arrive until a year later.
I n d e e d , in a calendar beginning with

the year 1, a new century does not strictly
b e gin until the year 101, and so on until
2 0 0 1 . The Gregorian calendar in its pre-
sent form has only existed for 418 ye a rs ,
and it is really 2,044 ye a rs old when seen as
a direct descendant of the Julian calendar.
W h at ’s more, C h rist was actually born a
few years before the official Christian date
of his birth. So perhaps it’s not surprising
t h at young Confucians,B u d d h i s t s ,Ta o i s t s ,
M u s l i m s , C h ristians and atheists have
concluded that the year 2000 just repre-
sents a worldwide desire to enter the new
millennium as quickly as possible—cele-
b r ating and making money at the same
time—and are keen to take part.
The same enthusiasm can be found in
the Jordan va l l e y. On the Israeli side there is
“Nazareth 2000”and on the Palestinian side
“Bethlehem 2000”.Luckily the share-out of
the holy places is fair to the two peoples
w h i c h , despite the small number of Chri s-
tians among them, are doing up these sites,
which date back to the dawn of Chri s t i a n i t y.
In a region with so many celebrat i o n s ,
there are countless welcoming banners.A f t e r
c e l e b r ations to mark the 3,000th annive r-
s a ry of Je rusalem and 50 ye a rs of Israeli his-
t o ry have been played down because of the
stalled peace process, I s r a e l ’s Lod intern a-
tional airp o rt is building an extension cal-

first prime minister) to welcome the pilgri m s

symbolizes the life of Chri s t .
Will there be six million of them,as the
Vatican predicts, or three to four million as
Israel has provided for, or the 2.5 million
foreseen by the pessimists,who are prepa-
ring for only a 20 per cent increase in tou-
rist numbers?
Storm in a wine-glass?
For Bethlehem, the year 2000 is an eco-
nomically important one.Experts forecast
t h at the influx of tourists will boost the
income of the Palestinian population by
$100 per capita during the ye a r.The Wo r l d
Bank has asked donor countries to beat the
Three Wise Men to it in Bethlehem, by pro-
viding $85 million to do up the town.The
private sector has also come up with funds
to build 6,000 extra hotel rooms.
But the millennium has also produced
some inappropriate tidings. A world away
from the rosari e s , the merchants of the
Temple have had the ultimate bad taste to
offer a “ Je rusalem 2000” C a b e rnet wine.
Its label shows the Dome of the Rock,
Islam’s third most holy place (after Mecca
and Medina) despite the fact that Islam
prohibits consumption of alcohol.A storm

up with the Arab League.

to be the champion celebrant of the mil-
l e n n i u m , and is avoiding any religious ove r-
t o n e s.The occasion coincides with the start
of ancient Egypt’s seventh millennium, so
the celebrations will naturally take place at
the foot of the Giza pyramids. More than a
thousand perform e rs will gather on a
20,000-square-metre stage and join Jean-
Michel Jarre,a French composer who spe-
cializes in mega-events, to present The 12
Dreams of the Sun.
The producers are happy, as the $9.5
million spent on the project will be recove-
red from some 50,000 people expected to
attend with tickets ranging from $150 to
$400 apiece. Such sums are beyond the
reach of most young Egyptians, who will
be able to have a “place in the sun” for a
more modest amount.
The concert will begin at dusk on the
last day of 1999 and continue until dawn on
the first day of 2000.When the first ray of
the sun appears in the Egyptian sky, a nine-
metre-high golden pyramid will be placed
on the Cheops pyramid to mark the birth of
the “new millennium”.
Happy New Year! ■
