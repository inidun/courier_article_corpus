M i r ro r,
mirror up above
Could we be living deep in a cosmic mirage, where rays of light multiply
and distort our perceptions of space? Instead of being flat and infinite,
might space not in fact be folded up—and our sense of the universe’s
vastness just an illusion?
I
t is extremely difficult for most of us to give a
shape to something as intangible as space. Fo r
the physicist, the question only has meaning if
couched in the language of geometry. So then
the question becomes: how can geometry best
represent physical space—the space we inhabit?
The problem is much more complex than it
first appears. There is no doubt that the space we
live in and which we are
familiar with is
correctly described by
what is known as
Euclidean geometry, a
set of laws devised by
the Greek geometer
Euclid in the third
century BC.1 But space
at the tiny microscopic
l e v e l , according to
quantum mechanics, is
a chaotic, f l u c t u a t i n g
domain somewhat like
the foam on the surface
of an ocean, while at
the very large
cosmological level we
learn that space is in
truth “ c u r v e d .” Wh e n
we ask what shape or
form space has,
t h e r e f o r e, modern physics actually gives us a
variety of answers depending on the level at which
we are looking.
Yet what exactly do we mean when we say
that space is “curved”? The modern science of
cosmology stems largely from the equations of
general relativity formulated by Albert Einstein in
the first two decades of the 20th century.A c c o r d i n g
to these equations, all space is deformed, or rather
c u r v e d , by the distribution of matter such as
galaxies inside it.This curvature manifests itself as
one of the universe’s most fundamental forces:
gravity.
Now if we turn to the universe as a whole—by
which we mean huge scales of over 102 5 m e t r e s — i t
appears that the virtually uniform distribution of
galaxies throughout the cosmos must curve space in
a likewise uniform fashion.Aside from this constant
c u r v a t u r e, the universe should also have an
underlying dynamic: in other words, it can either be
expanding or contracting.
On the basis of Einstein’s equations,A l e x a n d e r
Friedmann and Georges
Lemaître discovered in
the 1920s a set of
models for such curved
space.The most simple
version points to so-
called positive
c u r v a t u r e, resembling a
simple sphere that
dilates from the big
bang onwards to reach
a maximum size before
contracting back into a
final “big crunch.”
Space could also have
no curvature or a
negative curvature
(forming a
“ h y p e r b o l i c ” shape that
resembles a saddle).In
both of these cases, the
universe expands
forever, though the rate of expansion slows over
time.
Recent observations have suggested that cosmic
space is in fact close to the “no curvature” m o d e l —
in other words it is flat and almost Euclidean,like
our normal understanding of space. But the data also
indicates that the universe is expanding at an
increasing rate, suggesting that some kind of
“cosmological constant” is accelerating the
expansion rate.This constant may be understood as
the energy of empty space.
But important questions remain. Can general
relativity really give us a satisfactory description of
the shape of space at the largest scales? It is, after all,
1 . SCIENCE AT THE LIMITS
Four images of the same quasar, bent around
a central galaxy:a common astronomical mirage.
1. Based on five axioms
(including his most
famous one, n a m e l y
t h a t parallel lines do
n o t m e e t ) , E u c l i d ’s 13-
volume text E l e m e n t s
includes commonsense
geometric theorems such
as that the angles in a
triangle add to 180º.N o n -
Euclidean geometry was
created in the 19th
century.

still unclear whether space is finite or infin i t e : a
spherical universe would certainly be finite, but a
Euclidean or negatively curved universe could be
either finite or infinite.
At this stage we need a new approach: that of
t o p o l o g y,a branch of geometry devoted to exploring
the properties that define particular spatial objects.
Where the science of curvature falls shorts, t o p o l o g y
can step in to tell us about the overall structure of
space.
Euclidean space can certainly be a lot more
complicated than imagined. A surface with no
c u r v a t u r e, for example, is not necessarily fla t .All one
has to do to prove this is take a rectangular piece of
paper and stick it together at the edges to make a
cy l i n d e r. Just as with the original flat piece of paper,
the surface of the cylinder is still Euclidean. The
cy l i n d e r ’s surface thus still has no curvature, b u t
unlike the flat paper, it is finite in one direction.
This is the sort of property that topology, n o t
curvature, can reveal.Cutting and sticking the flat
piece of paper into various new shapes does not alter
the curvature of the paper itself, but radically
changes it overall shape—its topology.
The dawn of
ruffled space
In space which is fla t , any two points can be
joined only by a single line, or geodesic—meaning
simply a line in curved space. In what we call multi-
connected space, on the other hand, an infin i t e
number of geodesics join two points together,as can
be seen in the diagram.It is this very property which
gives such spaces extraordinary cosmological
relevance.
When we look at a faraway galaxy, we normally
think that we are seeing just one unique object,in
one particular direction and at one distance. But if
cosmic space is multi-connected,rays of lights will
replicate to produce multiple images of the observed
galaxy. Since our entire perception of space comes
from analysis of the trajectories of light rays, such a
multi-connected space would mean we are plunged
in a massive optical illusion that makes the universe
appear much larger than it really is. Distant galaxies
that we believe to be “original” would in fact be
repeated images of a single galaxy.
A “ruffled”space would be just such a cosmos:
a multi-connected domain of finite volume, whose
size would be smaller than the observed universe
(whose radius is around 15 billion light-years).Th i s
space would create a topological mirage t h a t
constantly repeated the images from shining
sources—akin to standing in a hall of mirrors.
Similar optical illusions are already well known
by astronomers,and go under the name g r a v i t a t i o n a l
m i r a g e s. These occur when light from a distant
object such as a quasar is bent by the effect of a
massive body situated on its sightline. As a result,
light rays from the star follow the curvature of
space and are scattered (see photo). What the
observer sees is a group of phantom images
surrounding the intervening heavy object (known by
astronomers as a “ l e n t i l ” ) .This sort of mirage can be
directly ascribed to the l o c a l curvature of space
around the lentil.
In the event of a topological mirage, however,
there is no single heavy body like a galaxy deforming
s p a c e. I n s t e a d ,space itself plays the role of a lentil:
phantom images are distributed in all directions
and for all their points in history across the entirety
of space.Such a global mirage allows us to examine
objects not only from every possible angle,but also
from every possible phase in their evolution.
For space to have this ruffled shape, it would
have to be highly subtle and constructed over very
large scales. If not,we would have already identifie d
phantom images of our own galaxy and other well-
known structures—a feat we have not yet achieved.
So how can we then establish the true topology
of the universe? One method, c o s m i c
c r y s t a l l o g r a p h y, attempts to pinpoint repetitions in
the distribution of distant objects. Studies of
fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation—
a fossil from the big bang—might also indicate that
space is ruffled by uncovering specific recurrences.
Experimental projects in both fields are under-
w a y, though neither the depth nor the resolution of
observations are yet good enough to draw
conclusions about space’s overall topology. Th e
next few years, h o w e v e r,promise great things: d e e p
surveys of distant galaxies and quasars, along with
new satellites probing background radiation.
Perhaps we will soon be able to give a form to
space. ■
A very simple two-
dimensional universe
illustrates how an observer
in galaxy A (red) can see
multiple images of galaxy B
(yellow).This model of the
universe, called a tore (a
doughnut shape),is
constructed from a square
stuck together on two sides.
Instead of one line linking
the galaxies, light from
galaxy B can now reach
galaxy A by various routes;
as a result, the observer in
galaxy A sees images of
galaxy B from various
directions.Though the tore is
finite, the observer is under
the illusion that space is
much larger than it really
it—his or her image of
space is similar to a grid of
repeated cells.
