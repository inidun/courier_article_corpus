Thanks to progress in medicine and
hygiene, life expectancy luis increased
considerably in the past century.
Ecologically speaking, is there a
critical tolerance threshold for the
human species on ourplanet?
World population has grown to
over five billion inhabitants. In the
next twenty or thirty years, it might
grow to around double that figure,
that is, eight to nine billion or eleven
to twelve billion, according to
various estimates that have been
made. The demographic problem is
a crucial and thorny one; in fact,
many countries prefer to avoid dis¬
cussing it. It will not be solved by a
mere expansion of financial
resources; a range of cultural fac¬
tors and development policies will
also have to be taken into account.
Education and widespread birth
control are clearly essential ingredients
oftlie solution. But is there notadanger
that many peoples might find this
offensive to their sensitivities and
convictions?
It would be simplistic to main¬
tain that all countries ought to adopt
the same demographic policy. A
demographic policy needs to res¬
pect the individual, as well as differ¬
ences in the cultural context. In
Europe, for instance, the popula¬
tion is aging too much. If the
countryside loses its farmlands, the
environment in this continent will
deteriorate further. On the other
hand, in some countries of the Third
World, population is growing at a
spectacularly fast pace. If the coun¬
tries there do not act quickly and
vigorously to bring it under strict
control, whilst respecting their
peoples' culture, religion and life¬
style, we shall be heading for
disaster, with successive waves of
migration occurring both in the
South and in the North.
Imposing a demographic-control
handbook on the entire world is out
of the question. Nor do we want to
see the government of a country
applying draconian policies that
might arouse violent reactions from
its population as has already hap¬
pened with certain male steriliza¬
tion programmes. However, one
way or another, we will have to stem
the tide ofpopulation growth.
How can this be achieved? Birth
control will certainly be necessary,
but it will have to be subtly adjusted
to take account of cultural differ¬
ences. We cannot advocate a single
growth model, a single environ¬
mental conservation model and a
single demographic model. The
vision must be global, but it must
also take the specific realities of
each country into account.
Nevertheless, education and devel¬
opment must form the basis of any
solution to the population problem.
Can you put a figure on the demo¬
graphic threshold that should not be
crossed?
It all depends on your point of
view. From a strictly functional

standpoint ofhow many people we
can feed, the answer is that with all
the progress that has been accom¬
plished in farming and biotechno¬
logy, we might have the technical
means to feed up to fifteen billion
people. But this would entail chan¬
ging the world into a huge, monoto¬
nous, industrialized, urban expanse,
standardizing all food and becoming
more vulnerable than ever to social
and geopolitical upheavals.
But ifwe care about the quality of
life, if we consider that a human
being should have a minimum
amount of time and space available
to him or her in order to enjoy an
existence worthy ofthe name, then
it can be said that we have already
almost reached the critical
threshold. To put a figure on it, let us
say that ten billion is the limit it
would be better not to exceed.
Is mastery ofbiotechnology, and its
properapplication, the key to the pre¬
servation ofa livable environment?
Biotechnologies have given
rise to great, sometimes excessive

hope, but also to a lot of fears. As I
see it, both attitudes are well
founded. We may know how a par¬
ticular organism reacts in a labora¬
tory experiment, but we don't know
how it will behave once it is let loose
in nature and begins to interact with
other existing organisms. Whilst not
neglecting the benefits, we have to
guard against possible harm. To
avoid the risk of potential devia¬
tion, all kinds of precautions must
be taken. Accordingly, ad hoclegis-
lation seems indispensable to me.
Take tomatoes, for instance. How
was a remedy found for the parasitic
infestation that affected them?
Instead ofbeing treated with pesti¬
cides, they were cross-bred with
some wild tomato stocks from
South America. This resulted in
some productive, resistant varie¬
ties that lost nothing in taste and
quality. On the other hand, you can
also get stocks that deteriorate the
environment by becoming invasive.
We have to be careful not to play
the role of sorcerer's apprentice.
Tlteenvironment isan internationaland
interdisciplinary area par excellence.
Has itfinallybeen recognizedas such ?
Let's be frank: the environment
and development crisis is above all
a crisis of institutions, both national
and international. For over a cen¬
tury, culture, the educational
system, trades as a whole, have all
been based on a sectoral approach,
on the compartmentalization of
knowledge and activities. How can
we go from this specific interest in
one field to a systematic interac¬
tion among the various disciplines?
It is of course indispensable to know
each field of activity in depth, but
problems of the environment and of
development will never be solved
by a single discipline.
That's easy to say, I know, and
infinitely hard to put into practice.
Why? Because most institutions are
still behaving as they did fifty years
ago. Competition is still rife bet¬
ween ministries, as well as between
different sectors of international
institutions. Every time an attempt
is made to break down institutional
or disciplinary barriers whether
national or international, govern¬
mental or non-governmental in¬
stitutions are involved it runs into
outdated forms ofobstruction. This
seems to be particularly true in
areas where only political synergy
could make progress possible. The
United Nations institutions, des¬
pite the efforts accomplished in this
area, are not exempt from the slug
gishness that is due to a sectoral
approach, divergence of interests
and the barriers of tradition.
Whatsolution doyou suggest?
Unfortunately, there is no
simple answer. First, the university
system, based as it is on sectoral
separation, would have to be modi¬
fied, so as to inculcate in every
researcher the desire to work with
researchers in other disciplines.
Given that it is impossible to have
generalists capable ofsolving all the
problems, why not have specialists
who, besides having one main dis¬
ciplinary root, would also have
lateral roots, just as plants have cen¬
tral tap-roots and lateral roots that
intertwine with the roots of other
plants for mutual cross-fertilization?
In this way, competition would be
replaced by tolerance and reciprocal
exchange, both ofwhich at present
are practically non-existent.
On close examination it becomes
clear that environmental deterio¬
ration is setting in because more
and more knowledge is being
acquired in isolation rather than
being integrated into a compre¬
hensive approach. We are walking
backwards. There will be no pro¬
gress without mutual interdiscipli¬
nary exchange.
