million Ecus, and the deal cannot be revised
until it expires—a concession insisted on by
Brussels to ensure the stability of the agree-
ment, which calls for, among other things, the
creation of a Moroccan-European commission
that will meet once a year to make sure the
accord is being followed and to settle disputes,
if any. But the only time the commission has
met was in 1996. A second meeting, i n
December 1997, was suspended after it had
barely begun.
Stressing the alarming drop in its fis h i n g
r e s o u r c e s , which experts put at 27 per cent in
1 9 9 7 , Morocco decided to unilaterally increase
the replenishment period to four months instead
of the two provided for in the agr e e m e n t . On 27

A z n a r ’s visit to Rabat , his Moroccan counter-

on fishing must take new forms in the future.
And in May, M o r o c c o ’s fis h e ries minister ru l e d
out any possibility of renewing the present
a greement as it now stands. In the same breat h ,
he decided to close the area along the Saharan
coast between Boujdour and Dakhla to fis h i n g
for a one-year peri o d , r e n e wable if need be, i n
order to preserve sardine

Both parties have
c o n flicting and comple-

fishing industry employ s
150,000 people in
Morocco and accounts
for 15 per cent of the

stocks must clearly be

more precisely targeted
accords are being sought,
such as the one Morocco
has concluded with some
