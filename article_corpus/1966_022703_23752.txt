H,ow can money be raised for the restoration and protection of the world's
heritage of monuments ? A new Unesco plan offers an answer turn the
monuments into paying affairs. Unesco's plan, which is expected to have far-
reaching results, suggests that countries should turn their cultural assets into
economic ones by giving priority to monuments in programmes of tourist devel¬
opment, increased revenues from cultural tourism would stimulate economic
development and would provide the means to restore monuments and other
cultural treasures. Unesco has been studying the problem since 1964 and last
year, in answer to requests from Peru, Turkey and Iran, Unesco specialists went
to help these countries in drawing up co-ordinated projects for monument pro¬
tection and tourist development. Unesco is studying how funds for such
projects can be obtained from regional and international organizations and through
the UN. Development Programme, since the tourist industry is seen as a key
factor in economic development.

The best preserved
theatre of ancient
Greece Is at
Epidaurus in the.
Peloponnesus.
It was built
in the 4th century
B.C. by the
architect and
sculptor Polycletus.
Each summer a
Greek classic-
theatre festival is
held at Epidaurus.
HE cultural importance of
monuments has been acknowledged by
everyone. But until recently monu¬
ments were classed as a sort of luxury
and it was felt that the large sums
needed for their preservation should
be used for more urgent and essential
tasks. In an exceptional case the
international campaign to save the
monuments of Nubia Unesco was
able to call on international generosity
to help save a rich ensemble of artistic
and archaeological wealth in a region
about to be engulfed by the waters of
the Aswan High Dam.
The success of the Unesco-sponsor-
ed Nubian campaign stimulated world¬
wide interest in the protection of mon¬
uments.
Now, Unesco has been led to
reconsider the whole problem and to
examine whether some economic value
can be attached to historic monuments,
irrespective of their immense cultural
significance. These studies have
shown that the preservation of mon¬
uments can contribute to economic
development since monuments are a
tourist attraction and thus a potential
economic asset, which should be
developed.
Increased leisure time is giving a
strong impetus to tourism and to the
tourist earnings of many countries. In
the developing countries particularly
tourism can stimulate economic growth
and earn much-needed foreign curren¬
cy. Thus investments in the preserva¬
tion of monuments can be made in
conjunction with investments for tour¬
ist development and thus form an inte¬
gral part of national plans for economic
development.
Unesco seeks to promote the pre¬
servation of cultural property and to
make it play its full role in the life
of the community. If it is recognized
that monuments can do much to pro¬
mote tourism, their preservation will
become easier and knowledge and
appreciation of them will be vastly
enhanced.
Unesco encourages the development
of tourism because tourism contri¬
butes in innumerable ways to education,
culture and international understanding.
When projects for the preservation of
monuments are included in program¬
mes of economic development, nation¬
al and even world-wide attention is
focussed on these monuments, and
every section of the community is
encouraged to give a greater place
in daily life to the values symbolized
by the world's cultural heritage.

Higher standards of living and the
modernization of transport are giving
a continual impetus to the tourist
industry. Under the impact of the
spread and improvement of education
tourism is also taking new forms. It
is no longer motivated solely by the
urge "to get away from it all"; increas¬
ingly it reflects a desire to use loisure
for cultural enrichment. The restora¬
tion and display of historic monuments
would seem to be the ideal way of
satisfying and encouraging these
aspirations.

I y making it easier for
people to travel abroad, tourism helps
to foster greater knowledge and
understanding of the world. Today,
monuments are an increasingly popu¬
lar tourist attraction, offering people a
new incentive to visit other countries
for cultural reasons. They give the
visitor from abroad a broader and
clearer image of a country and he may
be able to judge its people better if
he has a more discerning grasp of
their history. Monuments thus help to
eliminate prejudices which are so
often the cause of ideological and
racial conflicts.
Monuments also play a key role in
developing "long distance" tourism,
drawing people from the leading "tour¬
ist exporting countries" of Europe and
North America to far away places. The
flow of tourists to countries like India,
Iran, Peru and Turkey is ¡argely due
to the attraction of their national monu¬
ments. Nowadays, too, people in¬
creasingly take advantage of business
trips to visit outstanding monuments
and sites.
A growing number of tourist resorts
are being created close to monuments,
in areas far from the beaten track
which have nothing else to offer the
tourist. In 1958, nearly 5,500 tourists
were drawn to Cambodia, just to visit
the magnificent temples of Angkor.
Assuming an average stay of two days
and an average expenditure of $100
by each visitor, it can be seen that
the temples brought Cambodia almost
$550,000, and this was achieved when
Cambodia had no special tourist deve¬
lopment projects, only limited means
of transport, no access road and a
single hotel.
Art and history also display a simi¬
lar drawing power in highly developed
tourist areas. In 1962, hotels in
and around Florence registered over
560,000 guests ; the same year, the
city's famous Uffizzi Gallery was visit¬
ed by 513,000 people who paid a total
of $240,000 to admire its treasures.
There can be no doubt that the pri¬
mary tourist attraction in Florence is
the city's rich artistic heritage.
The advantages to be gained from
displaying historic monuments and
sites are so considerable that inter¬
national programmes are now being
arranged. Mexico, Honduras and Gua¬
temala are jointly planning tours whose
main attractions are visits to each
country's historic remains and parti¬
cularly those of the extraordinary pre-
Columbian civilizations.
T he exploitation of historical
remains for tourist development pro¬
grammes that provide means of access
and accommodation, coupled with ade¬
quate publicity, will automatically
attract more tourists, regardless of the
distance they have to travel. Distance,
which used to be a major obstacle to
international travel, is much less so
nowadays thanks to the modernization
of transport, a reduction in air fares,
and facilities for group travel and the
chartering of aircraft, which bring air
travel within the reach of an ever
larger number of people.
In 1958, 60,000 tourists visited Thai¬
land whose chief attraction is its innu¬
merable monuments and temples.
Thailand expects to receive 230,000
tourists in 1968, at the end of its ten-
year tourist development programme,
and it calculates that they will spend
about $35 million an increase of 300
per cent over the $8 million spent by
tourists in Thailand in 1958. In the light
of a general growth in world tourism,
Thailand's expectations are realistic,
and one indication that its plan is go
ing to schedule is that already in 1963
it received 134,000 tourists.
Historic remains can be used to
create entirely new tourist trends and
also to bring new life to economically
depressed areas. In the Soviet Union
this has led to the launching of a new
tourist industry in Armenia by restor¬
ing many early Christian churches.
The majority of tourists choose to
visit seaside and mountain resorts. As
new attractions, monuments not only
draw more visitors, but also help to

CULTURAL TOURISM (Continued)
Monumental success stories
in Europe, America and the Middle East
relieve pressure on already popular
resorts.
Most countries where tourism is
highly developed now encourage peo¬
ple to visit their new tourist areas. An
increase in visits to Spain's great
centres of art and monuments such
as Granada, Seville, Pamplona and
Madrid, has helped to relieve pressure
on coastal resorts in places like the
Costa Brava, which has an exception¬
ally heavy tourist influx in the summer
season. Mexico too is encouraging
people to visit not only its seaside
resorts, but also its outstanding mon¬
uments, thereby increasing the length
of visits and spreading tourist spend¬
ing over more of the country. Bulgaria
is using monuments to create "inter¬
nal tourist industries", thus drawing
off some of the pressure on the Black
Sea resorts, in particular the town of
Plovdiv.
T,
16
he staggering of holidays
is another problem that preoccupies
the tourist countries. Unlike holidays
spent in seaside and mountain resorts,
tourism based on monuments and his¬
toric sites is relatively unaffected by
the weather. Tourist organizations
are now taking advantage of the
opportunities thus offered to launch a
big drive for out-of-season tourism. In
Europe, where people used to visit
the Mediterranean only during the
summer season, many take advantage
of special facilities (longer holidays,
out-of-season rates for hotels and
transport, cheap cruises) now offered
at other times of the year, particularly
at Christmas and Easter, solely to see
the rich monumental heritage of this
part of the world.
The tourist industry can play an im¬
portant, sometimes vital, role in a
nation's economy (see article page 5).
In 1965, world revenue from interna¬
tional tourism totalled well over
$11,000 million, while world expendi¬
ture on national tourism was about
$46,000 million. These figures com¬
bined, which represent about five per
cent of private consumer spending
throughout the world, show the
economic impact of tourism today.
International tourism is often one
of the major exports of the economical¬
ly developing countries, and one of
their chief sources of foreign currency
earnings, with a capacity for develop¬
ment well above that of most other
economic activities.
The impact of tourist spending on
different sectors of the economy varies
considerably according to whether
visits last for less than 24 hours or for
longer. Revenue from the day excur¬
sionist is by no means negligible. The
University of Colorado (U.S.A.) has
calculated that 100,000 visitors who
stay an average of two hours in a
town spend as much as $350,000.
Longer visits are naturally more pro¬
fitable to monuments and sites and
to the local economy because of
greater spending on hotels, restau¬
rants, shops and local travel.
Tourist resorts therefore try to
induce visitors to prolong their stay
by offering all kinds of attractions
museums, theatres, historical, cultural
and art exhibitions, folklore program¬
mes and visits to natural beauty spots.
Ri evenue from both kinds of
tourism is in any case considerable and
a large proportion comes from visits to
monuments and art centres. In Italy,
for instance, receipts from visits to
monuments and museums rose from
$3,770,000 in 1956, to over $5 million
in 1964. In the same period, Italian
spending on domestic tourism increas¬
ed from $84 million to $140 million.
Domestic tourism in the U.S.A., which
represented 5.8 per cent of consumer
spending in 1950, rose to over 6 per
cent in 1963. Visits to U.S. national
parks increased more than threefold
between 1950 and 1963 from 33
million to over 102 million annually.
These figures show that people
are spending more and more on
leisure time pursuits, and that increas¬
ingly these activities are inspired by
an interest in history and art.
Spending on cultural tourism, how
ever, still represents only a small
proportion of global tourist expend¬
iture, which benefits the wide range
of industries and activities that are
needed to satisfy the multiple needs
of the modern tourist.
The expansion of tourism leads to
development and modernization of the
hotel, restaurant and retail trades.
Farm produce finds new markets,
local traditions and folklore are pre¬
served and crafts and industries stimu¬
lated. Local production and activities
are given a new impetus, either rapidly
from the direct effects of tourism or
indirectly over a longer period. As a
result traditional economic structures
are radically transformed.
u ps and downs in the an¬
nual cycle followed by tourism are
well known, and ways can be found to
adapt to these seasonal fluctuations,
particularly by giving greater import¬
ance to monuments in tourist develop¬
ment programmes. Studies show that
the tourist industry is actually in a
stronger and more stable position than
some consumer goods which also are
subject to seasonal variations.
Stimulation of the tourist industry
by making more use of monuments
to attract visitors helps to create new
jobs and a greater demand for man¬
power. This can be met by the local
population and, if need be, by perma¬
nent or seasonal immigration from
overcrowded or economically-depress¬
ed areas.
The University of Tennessee and
the First National Bank of Hawaii
have calculated that for every thou¬
sand visitors staying in hotels in a
given region of the U.S.A., 279 jobs
are created in the tourist trade itself
and 107 in activities indirectly related
to tourism. For every thousand cam¬
pers, however, only 57 jobs are
created in the tourist trade and only
32 in auxiliary activities.
Rapid industrialization in developing
countries often disrupts traditional
social and economic structures and
sets off an exodus of workers to the

About one-quarter of Jordan's foreign
currency earnings come from the foreign
tourists who visit its historic sites.
One of the most famous is the city of
Petra, built In the 3rd century B.C. as
the capital of the Nabathean Empire.
Here, glimpsed between the walls
of a narrow gorge leading to the
city, is one of Petra's noble buildings.
towns, particularly farm hands from
economically-depressed areas. This
in turn leads to overcrowding, under¬
employment and often to pitifully low
living conditions. Promotion of the
tourist trade through the restoration
and display of monuments may be the
means, and in some countries the only
means, of counteracting this drift to
the cities.
The protection of plants, animals,
beauty spots and monuments is often
covered by a single set of laws. As
part of the preservation, restoration
and display of monuments, specific
laws should be passed to protect them
against damage from natural causes
or by man.
A long with the restoration of
monuments, efforts are needed to
create a harmony between monuments
and their surroundings, and protective
zones should be established. In
France all construction is controlled
within a radius of 500 metres (one-
third of a mile) of any building classed
as an artistic or historic monument.
Great care is now taken by town
planners to protect and enhance
monuments and sites. The layout of
the site and its approaches, and the
design of garages, information offices
and houses for caretakers and guides
should not only blend harmoniously
with a monument, but also accentuate
its attractions.
When large sums are invested in
programmes of preservation and re¬
storation the prospects of their amor¬
tization need to be carefully calculated.
Charges on loans from national and
international financial bodies are fairly
heavy. The usual rate of interest is
5 per cent, and repayment has to be
made within seven years. Estimates
made before a programme is launched
should confirm that income from tourist
development will permit the State to
repay its debt, plus interest, within
prescribed time limits. Unesco esti¬
mates of profits on tourist investment
relating to a project in Peru (see
page 27) have shown that the exploit¬
ation of monuments under tourist
development programmes can produce
big returns.
Examples abound of development
programmes which, after being quickly
amortized, have earned handsome pro¬
fits. A classic instance is the resto
ration of Williamsburg, Virginia
(U.S.A.). In 1926 a project was laun¬
ched to restore this famous site of
American Revolutionary times and to
stimulate a revival of the town and
its neighbourhood.
Large-scale restoration and exten¬
sive excavations have since been
carried out. Nearly 600 modern build¬
ings have been demolished, nearly
200 old ones rebuilt on their original
foundations and nearly 100 restored.
Today in the heart of the modern
city of Williamsburg in an area about
a mile long and half a mile wide the
image of an American city of 200 years
ago has been recaptured.
In 1960 nearly 450,000 people visited
the monuments of Williamsburg and
several hundred thousand the town
itself. In 1964 there were almost a
million visitors.
Tourism in Williamsburg employs
1,800 persons, excluding the teams of
archaeologists who sometimes work
there, and other persons employed
in related activities directly or indirectly
connected with the Williamsburg site.
Ri estoration work is carried
out by two organizations: Colonial
Williamsburg Inc., and its subsidiary,
Williamsburg Restoration Inc.
The income of Colonial Williamsburg
Inc. increased from $2,068,000 in 1960
to $2,776,000 in 1964. The gross
income of Williamsburg Restoration
Inc., which pays the same taxes
as a private undertaking, rose from
$7,493,000 in 1960 to $10,059,000 in
1964. Local taxes paid by these organ¬
izations in 1960 totalled $254,000.
In 1964 the property taxes they paid
(as owners of nearly 16 per cent of
land in the town) represented nearly
30 per cent of municipal revenue from
this source. The income of both
organizations finances the educational
programme of Colonial Williamsburg
Inc.
Williamsburg Restoration Inc. owns
and runs numerous lodging houses,
inns and other tourist enterprises. Its
total reserve fund rose from over
$47 million in 1960 to over $51 million
in 1964.

In Jordan a seven-year plan for
developing tourism (1963-1970) is
restoring and preserving the holy
places and archaeological sites which
are the country's chief tourist attrac¬
tion. Over 900,000 Jordanian dinars
($327,000) is being spent on mon¬
uments at Petra, Jarash, Karak, Cho-
bak, Ajilun, Godara, Sebastye, Iraq and
Amir, and on the Omayah Palace and
the citadel of Amman.
18
ITALY, Greece and Egypt
have used restoration programmes
and publicity campaigns to increase
the well established tourist appeal of
their historical and artistic treasures.
Across the Atlantic, Miami's large
tourist centre now offers as a major
attraction the restored cloisters of the
Sacremenia monastery.
Some regions and cities owe their
fame as tourist centres to a single
outstanding monument. The Alhambra
in Granada (Spain) was seen by half
a million tourists in 1963, but far fewer
(350,000) visited the town itself.
Among other celebrated monuments
which draw a constant stream of tour¬
ists are the Taj Mahal and the Ajanta
Caves in India and the temples of
Kyoto and Nara in Japan.
In all parts of the world, from Mexi¬
co, Peru and Guatemala to Thailand,
Cambodia and Iran, monuments contri¬
bute enormously to the promotion of
tourism. If these cultural resources
were exploited more vigorously, they
could become a key factor in the
future development of the tourist
industry.
