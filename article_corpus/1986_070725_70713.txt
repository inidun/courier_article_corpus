The Caribbean
community

THE quest for economic integration in
the English-speaking Caribbean
started in the 1960s after the collapse
of the ill-fated Federation of the British
West Indies in 1962. After a vain attempt to
revive the federalist idea of political unity,
leaders turned increasingly to the concept
of economic integration as a means of pre¬
serving ties between the islands and the
mainland territories of British Honduras
(Belize) and British Guiana (Guyana). The
federalist venture, which was singularly en¬
couraged by the colonial power, foundered
on the rock of personality clashes, conflict¬
ing notions of weak federalism versus
strong central federalism, freedom of
movement between territories and insular
notions of nationalism.
According to Dr. Eric Williams, noted
historian and late Prime Minister of Trini¬
dad and Tobago, writing in 1970, "the
Federal experience as well as the post-inde¬
pendence situation in the Commonwealth
Caribbean showed that the quest for identi¬
ty and solidarity among the ex-British pos¬
sessions in the Caribbean had to be pursued
by other means namely, the method of
regional economic collaboration and the
working out of complementary rather than
competitive strategies of economic
development. "(,)

It was self-evident in the early 1960s that
Caribbean countries were linked economi¬
cally more closely to the metropolitan coun¬
tries (in particular the former colonial
power) than to each other. This factor in
itself produced and perpetuated vertical,
bi-lateral trading relations between each
country on the one hand and countries out¬
side the region on the other hand. As a
result, intra-regional, horizontal economic
relations, the development of multilateral
commerce and the rationalization of fiscal
and excise policies were non-existent,
thereby contributing to the continued eco¬
nomic isolation of individual countries.
In 1965, then, the leaders of Antigua,
Barbados and British Guiana concluded an
agreement to establish a Free Trade Area.
By 1967, other territories had accepted the
principle of such an association and at the
Heads of Government Conference in Bar¬
bados in October 1967 adopted a number of
resolutions aimed at establishing a Carib¬
bean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA);
creating a Caribbean regional development
bank; and furthering the integration pro¬
cess. The CARIFTA Agreement, ratified
by the three founding members at St.
John's, Antigua, entered into force on 1
May 1968. At the same time, other territor¬
ies signed a Protocol of Interest and pledged
to become members.
It may be useful at this point to place this
initial integration effort in perspective. One
cannot underestimate the economic legacy
of three centuries of colonialism which
24

assigned to the Caribbean territories the
role of producers of primary commodities
and suppliers of cheap labour for metropo¬
litan consumption. The pattern of single-
crop industries led to the neglect of diversi¬
fication and accentuated dependence on
favoured treatment by the colonial power.
Agricultural production for the domestic
market and the gradual expansion of the
industrial base received scant attention, re¬
sulting in the increased vulnerability of
national economies of the Caribbean.
Nor can one underestimate the consider¬
able prestige and influence of Sir Arthur
Lewis on West Indian economic thinking in
the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s the future
Nobel Prize-winner in Economics, a citizen
of Saint Lucia, produced two seminal works
which left their impact on economic policy
in the region for some time. In an article
published in 1950, Sir Arthur argued that:
"A poor people spends a very high propor¬
tion of its income on food and shelter, and
only a small proportion on manufactures.
At their present low standard of living, the
number of persons for whom West Indians
can provide employment in manufacturing
by their own purchases is extremely
small."(2)
The apparent anti-industrialization slant
was later to be echoed in a classic article in
which Lewis shows that in a dualistic eco¬
nomy the sector offering higher wages will
attract labour without necessarily depress¬
ing those of the rival sector when the labour
supply is precisely "unlimited". (3) Lewis'
theory therefore seemed to lay the justifica¬
tion for attracting foreign capital and tech¬
nology which would avail themselves of in¬
expensive labour on the local market.
The relatively cheap and abundant
labour supply in Caribbean countries
prompted political leaders to open their
economies to the North American multi¬
nationals which installed light manufactur¬
ing plants and benefited from highly attrac¬
tive fiscal incentives. However, their pre¬
sence resulted in investment in capital in¬
tensive activities which hardly addressed
the root cause of high unemployment: the
absence of a wide spectrum of agricultural
and industrial activity supplying both the
domestic and export markets. Secondly, a
significant percentage of multinational pro-

fits was repatriated to the North and could
not be re-invested locally so as to contribute
to the growth of national investment . Third¬
ly, the increasingly high cost of the required
technology proved frequently beyond the
means of such small countries. It must also
be noted that the severely limited tax base
did not generate the funds necessary for
major public capital investment in infra¬
structure.
The foregoing elements demonstrate that
as these territories moved towards inde¬
pendence in the 1960s and 1970s, they were
characterized by very small, mono-crop,
technically and financially weak economies
producing for limited markets. The prob¬
lem, then, was how best to unite more than
a dozen territories into a credible economic
zone in the face of ever rising international
competition and inflationary pressures,
compounded by falling prices of non-pet¬
roleum primary commodities. The absence
of economies of scale and a critical level of
economic activity underscored the need for
an institution affording stronger integration
links than those offered by a Free Trade
Association. Thus in July 1973 was signed
the Treaty of Chaguaramas, instituting the
Caribbean Community and Common Mar¬
ket (CARICOM) providing for increased
co-operation under three headings: Com¬
mon Market, Functional Co-operation and
the Co-ordination of Foreign Policy.
The Treaty of Chaguaramas provides
for two classifications of Member States.
Firstly, the More Developed Countries
(MDCs), comprising Barbados, Guyana,
Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
Secondly, there are the Less Developed
Countries (LDCs), including Antigua and
Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grena¬
dines. The latter were able, during negotia¬
tions leading up to the Treaty, to persuade
the MDCs that given their more fragile
economies they were entitled to special con¬
sideration. The integration movement had
to take into account the reality of the highly
uneven economic development of Member
States and devise mechanisms tending to
protect the economies of the LDCs. One
may note, for example, that with a popula¬
tion of 260,000, Barbados has a Gross
Domestic Product double that of all the
LDCs combined, which have a population
of approximately 600,000.
However intense and sincere might have
been the underlying intentions and efforts,
the integration movement clearly could not
exist in a Caribbean vacuum. Caribbean
solidarity inevitably had to cope with reali¬
ties external to the region and adapt to the
shifting tempo of the international econo¬
mic and financial context which dramatical¬
ly changed in 1973, the year of the Cha¬
guaramas Treaty, with the first oil shock.
Whereas Trinidad and Tobago, with its oil
resources, was able to profit from the price
spiral, the other countries, in particular the
LDCs, were hard pressed by a constantly
rising energy bill which compromised in¬
vestment capabilities.
The subsequent conservative political
reaction, with its inevitable monetarist eco¬
nomic policies and austerity measures, ^

^ further undermined the thrust towards eco¬
nomic integration. The world recessions of
1974-1975 and 1981-1983 were to leave their
mark on struggling Caribbean economies.
Jamaica and Guyana, both heavily depen¬
dent on their bauxite industry, were the
hardest hit in the 1970s by the downturn of
the world economy. In turn, intra-regional
trade suffered from the slowdown of these
two important markets, along with that of
Barbados, which witnessed the tapering off
of the tourist trade. In 1984 alone, intra-
regional trade fell by approximately 13 per
cent. The drop in trade was largely re¬
sponsible for the difficulties of the CARI-
COM Multilateral Clearing Facility
(CMCF), which was established in 1977 to
create an efficient payments system and
provide short-term credits while ameliorat¬
ing the foreign exchange situation. The
CMCF encountered difficulties and lapsed
into virtual neglect as early as 1982, when
Guyana defaulted on its payment.
Any decline in intra-regional trade neces¬
sarily has adverse consequences for all re¬
gional economies and in particular those of
the LDCs with a weaker base. Certain pro¬
tectionist measures adopted by the MDCs
could almost be interpreted as punitive ac¬
tions against the free flow of exports from
the LDCs, for there is little doubt that the
wider CARICOM market has assumed
major significance for LDC countries. Be¬
tween 1973 and 1981 , exports from LDCs to
CARICOM increased by over 600 per cent,
more especially in the area of light manufac¬
tures. However, the problem of market size
arises whenever a MDC decides to apply
import restrictions, as decided by Trinidad
and Tobago, where imports from CARI¬
COM fell by 30 per cent in 1985.
A further development tending to re¬
inforce the capability of the smaller Eastern
Caribbean States was the establishment in
July 1981 of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) regrouping Anti¬
gua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada,
Montserrat, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Gre¬
nadines. In addition to co-operation at the
political, judicial and cultural levels, the
OECS Treaty provides for the promotion of
economic integration. The creation of an
Economic Affairs Committee and the East
Caribbean Common Market attests to the
importance attached by Member States to
the problem of economic development.
Yet it must be recognized that the econo¬
mic situation of the early 1980s has acted as
a severe constraint on these efforts. Despite
the overall rise in protectionist attitudes,
the general thrust towards economic in¬
tegration seems to be firmly established in
the political consciousness of the region.
New perspectives will need to be explored
and fully exploited. Among these one may
cite the possibilities offered under the Lomé
III Agreement. In the final analysis, it is
perhaps useful to reflect on whether in¬
tegration does not constitute a function of
economic growth and therefore suffers
when growth decreases. If the corollary
holds true, i.e., that integration promotes
growth, then Caribbean countries have
established the necessary institutional fab¬
ric to propel such growth inspired by integ¬
ration. But only time will determine which
of these two possibilities bears the greater
historical validity.
