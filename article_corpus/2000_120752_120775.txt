he wobble of Neil A r m s t r o n g ’s legen-
dary leaps on the moon are engraved in
the memory of at least a generation.Yet
30 years later, much of the actual data
from that mission has been lost. Appa-
rently, NASA lacked the foresight to save
the equipment and software required to
read it. If the scourge of technological
obsolescence can cause such a loss for
the world’s leading space agency, i m a-
gine the challenge awaiting national libra-
ries in their task to preserve the world’s
digital heritage.
Just a few years ago, digital technolo-
gies emerged as a godsend for archivists.
As e-mail and the Internet spread, p u n d i t s
began taking bets on how long it would
take for paper to disappear. L i b r a r i e s
with the financial means began digitizing
their collections. Instead of submitting
their precious collections to page-fraying,
spine-breaking habits of scholars in a
merciless search for key passages, libra-
rians handed them a slim pair of C D-RO Ms,
digital copies of the great works, which
could be scanned in minutes.With a flip of
a switch, libraries could signficantly
expand access to their collections.
Yet in the frenzy to digitize, precious
resources may have been wasted.Wi t h o u t
a co-ordinated strategy, some sister orga-
nizations have made digital copies of
similar sections of their collections.Wi t h
a bit more foresight, they might have
worked together to offer a more diverse
s e l e c t i o n . Converted to the cult of the
new technologies, others have been a bit
too zealous in cleaning up—throwing
out—their ageing documents like old
n e w s p a p e r s.And fin a l l y, some of the more
prestigious institutions have fallen upon
a double-edged sword after proudly dis-
playing the gems of their collections on
the Internet.The digital versions whetted
the general public’s appetite to see the
“real thing”which means that crowning
documents like the Magna Carta risk
becoming veritable attractions.
I r o n i c a l l y, the supposed saviour, d i g i-
t i z a t i o n , may be an enemy in the battle to
build and preserve perpetual archives.
To begin with, t h e
technology is so new
that we cannot be cer-
tain of the longevity
o f, for example, C D-
ROMs. A more imme-
diate threat lies in the
extraordinary speed
of technological pro-
g r e s s. “ The great
creator becomes the
great eraser,” warns an American futurist,
Stewart Brand.We can read a thousand-
y e a r-old manuscript,yet archivists cannot
decipher some materials that are less than
20 years old.
Remember the old floppy discs of the
not-so-distant past? If by some miracle a
library finds some of those clunky
m a c h i n e s, the chances of acquiring spare
parts, the right software required and a
trained technician are just about nil.
To d a y, “backward compatible” s o f t-
ware—that designed to read old ver-
sions—generally only covers one or two
generations of changes,which offers little
relief when the average life cycle of hard-
ware and software is a mere 18 months.
I n d e e d , the U. S.based Research Libraries
Group found in a 1998 survey that nearly
half (15 of 36) of its member institutions
reported losing access to part of their
digital holdings because of obsolescence.
Awaiting a long-term solution, a r c h i-
vists continue to rely on a veritable relic:
m i c r o film for crumbling paper collec-
tions. But the old stand-by does little to
resolve the latest thorn in their side:the
new wave of “ b o r n - d i g i t a l s,” w o r k s
created on computer-like websites and
electronic journals.
Consider the case of continually up-
dated documents on the We b. Should we
preserve all the various drafts of the docu-
ment or only the final version? The drafts
of great works of literature are treasure
troves for scholars. For instance, Victor
H u g o ’s splendid
handwriting and the
powerful drawings he
used to fill in the mar-
gins of the pale blue
paper he favoured are
rich in historical signi-
f i c a n c e. In the near
f u t u r e, those who
study literary history
will be at a loss if all
they have is a diskette containing the
final “ c l e a n ” version with no draft, n o
h e s i t a t i o n , no notes, no drawings nor
doodles.
The same is true of e-mail.A century
a g o, famous writers may have recorded
their movements, discoveries and emo-
tions to friends or family in letters which
have often been preserved as part of our
cultural heritage, helping to set literary
works in the context of the writer’s life and
t h o u g h t . E-mail storage is increasingly
seen as a burden on a computer system.
Will the memory of today’s literary giants
lose out to that of the computer? 
And what about all the links an elec-
tronic publication might have to other
websites? The exhilaration that grips us
when we surf the Net quickly turns to
vertigo with the thought of preserving
that sea of information.
In the near future, those 
who study literary 
history will be at a loss 
if all they have is 
a diskette containing the 
final “clean” version

National libraries are testing two dif-
ferent approaches. Given the extraordi-
nary volume of web-based materials,
Australian archivists are becoming “ g a t e-
k e e p e r s,” sifting through and selecting
the most important materials for a
national electronic repository.To be part
of the depot, an item must either be
about the country or particularly rele-
vant to its interests. A l t e r n a t i v e l y, it can
be the work of an Au s t r a l i a n ,r e c o g n i z e d
as an authority on an issue of interna-
tional signific a n c e. While this approach
appears to be the most practical, there is
a danger in becoming overly selective.
After Napoleon ransacked the Va t i c a n
archives and sent them back to Paris in
1 8 1 0 , the French only saved the docu-
ments of immediate and apparent
i n t e r e s t .
Alternatively, archivists might try to
save the entire electronic domain of a
country. Sweden has embarked on such
an ambitious project, in collaboration
with other Nordic states.Thanks in large
part to a robot that takes regular “snap-
shots” of the Internet, the Swedes have
already amassed more than 58,000
items—from online publications to confe-
rence proceedings—in building a central
electronic repository.
Both of these routes lead to two major
o b s t a c l e s : copyright conflicts and costs.
In some countries, publishers must
deposit copies of every new publication in
national libraries.These laws, h o w e v e r,d o
not always apply in the electronic domain.
While some publishers voluntarily deposit
copies of “ h a n d h e l d ”w o r k s, like C D-RO Ms,
ephemeral works like electronic journals
are practically untouchable for legal rea-
s o n s. By subscribing to those journals,
libraries or individuals aren’t actually
buying a “ c o p y,” just a license to access the
material.
Taking a digital
refresher
Do they have the right to offer that
access to the public? And what if a library
stops a subscription? Then they don’t
necessarily have the right to display or
offer public access to back issues for
which they paid.
Enormous financial pressure is buil-
ding on national libraries and publishers
alike to iron out new business arrange-
ments and partnerships. Publishers are
leery of the responsibility for preserva-
t i o n , yet at the same time cannot afford to
see their collections become obsolete.
M e a n w h i l e, the archivists are finding it far
more expensive to acquire an electronic
publication than a traditional one. Th e
National Library of Au s t r a l i a , for example,
estimates that it takes one person a full
working day to acquire the first version of
an online publication—a task five times
more labour intensive than adding a print
i t e m . A study by the British Library sug-
gested that the cost of managing and pre-
serving a digital publication over a 25-year-
period is about 20 times greater than it is for
p r i n t .
A hefty chunk of the costs go to “ r e f r e-
s h i n g ” digital documents. Every five or
ten years, electronic collections are sup-
posed to embark on a “ m i g r a t i o n ,” i n
archival lingo, to an updated computer
c o n fig u r a t i o n .U n f o r t u n a t e l y, the journey
is not without its casualties. Formats and
presentations may change and some sec-
tions risk disappearing altogether.Does it
matter if the look and “ f e e l ” of a website
c h a n g e s, so long as the contents remain? 
For some archivists, migration is just a
standby for “ e m u l a t i o n ,” which would
involve a combination of software and
hardware capable of mimicking the beha-
viour of obsolete platforms and operating
s y s t e m s. In short, the aim is to develop a
kind of mini-archive to “ r e m i n d ”c o m p u-
ters of their past. But the technological
wizards can only forge part of the key to
preserving our digital documents. U l t i-
m a t e l y, we must reconfigure relations bet-
ween libraries and publishers. ■
National libraries with the financial means have been steadily digitizing their collections.
