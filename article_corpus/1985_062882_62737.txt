Contested records
The legal status of national archives
by Charles Kecskemeti
ARCHIVES are tools of government,
indispensable for the management
.of a country's affairs. In Europe
this circumstance led as early as the seven¬
teenth century to the widespread adoption
of a juridico-diplomatie practice whereby
agreements made when there was a change
of sovereignty over a given piece of territory
(and such changes were frequent after wars
or settlements between ruling houses)
regularly made provision for the exchange
or remittance of archives. Research in 1977
produced a list, not claimed to be ex¬
haustive, of 157 agreements of this kind
concluded since 1601. But this practice,
however deeply entrenched it may have
been, did not lead to the establishment of
international standards for the cession and
sharing of archives, and as a result the pro¬
visions of different agreements vary to a
startling extent. The only generally observ¬
ed practice was that the originals or copies
of documents necessary for the conduct of
routine affairs were handed over to the suc¬
cessor State.
The absence of established doctrine had
very serious consequences when the col¬
onial system was wound up. With few ex¬
ceptions, the achievement of independence
by the former colonies did not give rise to
agreements regarding the devolution of ar¬
chives. The measures taken by the colonial
powers did not obey any single logic and
ranged from the return of all documents to
return on a selective, albeit massive, basis.
Apart from certain countries such as
Algeria or India which made known their
claims immediately after independence, this
de facto situation seemed to be implicitly
accepted everywhere. Clearly this was an il¬
lusion, and it was inevitable that the ques¬
tion would be raised sooner or later at the
international level since an essential part of
the historical evidence relating to over a
hundred countries was (and still is) outside
their national frontiers.
The matter was put before Unesco's
General Conference in 1974, and since at¬
titudes were firmly entrenched a prolonged
controversy might have been feared. This
was avoided thanks to. Unesco's insistence
on drawing up, as rapidly as the complexity
of the problem allowed, a document accep¬
table to all its Member States. Work carried
out over a four-year period in collaboration
with the International Council on Archives
The first page of the law of 7 messidor
year II (25 June 1 794) promulgated by the
National Convention, the revolutionary
assembly which founded the first French
Republic In 1792. The law broke new
ground in placing all the archives of a
country under the control of a "central
depository" and established free access
to public archives for all citizens.
led to the development of an entirely new
intellectual approach.
A general typology was proposed, for ap¬
plication to the vast range of situations in
which disputes involving archives could
arise :
A change in sovereignty over a ter¬
ritory without the creation of a new State
(territorial claims, although increasingly
rare, still exist);
The transfer of archives during wars
or as a consequence of military occupation;
The creation of new States as a result
of the disintegration of existing political en¬
tities (Bangladesh is a recent example);
Situations created by decolonization,
each calling for a specific approach: the
return of archives to the metropolitan coun¬
try; the existence of archives of regional col¬
onial administrative services relating to

The last page of the will of William Shakespeare,
dated 25 March 1616 (the poet died on 23 April).
The signatures at the foot of each of the docu¬
ment's three pages are the only specimens of
Shakespeare's own hand. This one, tremulously
written, reads: "By me William Shakpeare".

(n August 1941, Winston Churchill and
Franklin D. Roosevelt met at sea and pro¬
claimed the Atlantic Charter, the prin¬
ciples of which foreshadowed those of
the United Nations Charter of 1945.
Above, draft of the Atlantic Charter dated
12 August 1941. Corrections and amend¬
ments are in Churchill's own hand.

During the Second World War, Warsaw,
the capital of Poland, was 90 per cent
destroyed by the Nazi occupation forces.
When the city was rebuilt, archive
documents provided essential informa¬
tion, especially for the reconstruction of
the old quarter. Right, 16th-century
engraving of the city is taken from The
Capitals of Europe, a guide to the sources
for the history of their architecture and
construction (1980), an international
publication (bilingual: French and
English) produced on the initiative of the
International Council on Archives with
the financial assistance of Unesco.
I» several independent States; the existence of
archives created and preserved in the
metropolitan countries, etc.
With the same purpose of obtaining a
consensus, certain concepts were for¬
mulated to enable the parties concerned in
bilateral negotiations to "speak the same
language". Principles which were invalid
because of their imprecision also had to be
brushed aside. One of these was the notion
of "territorial relevance" which lent itself
. to widely divergent interpretations and in
the past gave rise to veritable "massacres"
of archives. The classic case of this was the
dismemberment of documents, with dif¬
ferent pages going to different places
depending on the information in them, car¬
ried out in accordance wjth the Treaty of
Turin concluded in 1 8 1 6 between Savoy and
Geneva.
It was also necessary to define a special
status for holdings of archives which are of
equal interest to countries with a shared
history and which if dismembered would
lose all value as sources of information. The
formula adopted here was that of common
heritage, with the physical conservation of
archives being entrusted to one of the part¬
ners and the same rights of access and copy¬
ing being recognized for the others.
Finally, Unesco rallied the international
community in support of a key idea, of
the need to undertake a task of historic im¬
portance: the reconstitution of archive
heritages through the transfer of
microfilms.
This is a formidable challenge. Counting
only the most fully stocked archives in eight
former metropolitan countries (Belgium,
The National Archives building of
Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. It was built In
1982 with Unesco aid, In accordance with
the latest standards. In order to provide
the best possible conditions for the
preservation of documents, a system of
air conditioning maintains a constant
temperature and humidity level, and the
emission of ultra-violet rays by the
lighting system has been reduced to a
minimum.
Spain, the United States, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Portugal and the United
Kingdom), the total number of photos to be
taken probably amounts to somewhere in
the region of 250 million, representing
almost a century of uninterrupted work for
twenty-five technicians. This does not of
course include preliminary filing and inven¬
tory work which it would be pointless to try
to calculate in terms of time and money.
Without special resources, the systematic
microfilming of archives for countries
wishing to reconstitute their heritage is out
of the question. At the rate at which routine
operations are currently taking place, and
the production capacities of archive
laboratories rule out any acceleration, this
task would take a thousand or two thou¬
sand years, perhaps more. This is not to be
wondered at, for after all these documents
are the result of work done by thousands of
officials, officers, magistrates, lawyers and
sailors during one, two or three centuries.
Nevertheless, these figures and specula¬
tions about cost should neither cause alarm
nor obscure the practical aspects of the
problem. A vast microfilming programme
à A
for the developing countries can be under¬
taken on three conditions:
that financial resources should be
available over a long period to enable the
archives involved to increase the productive
capacity of their studios and workshops;
that action should be planned at the
international level in order to use such pro¬
ductive capacity to the full;
that conditions for the reception of
the microfilms should be the responsibility
of the public record offices of the countries
wishing to reconstitute their heritage by this
means.
The third millennium is at hand. It would
be neither reasonable nor fitting to
postpone to the twenty-first century a task
which is perfectly feasible today.
CHARLES KECSKEMETI, of France, has
been executive secretary of the International
Council on Archives since 1969. He is the
author ofmany articles, including two studies,
published by Unesco, on the settlement of
disputes involving archives.
