Everyone agrees that the 1948 Universal
D e c l a ration of Human Rights is a sacred cow and
no one would dream—officially,at least—of replacing
it with a new version that is more in step with the
t i m e s.But the semblance of agreement on a founding
text does not by any stretch of the imagination mean
it meets with unanimous acceptance. On the contra r y,
the Declaration has come under fierce attack, a n d
the criticisms have become more pointed in the past
few years. As if to relativize the document’s va l u e,
several regions of the world have drawn up human
rights charters based on their own principles, which
do not appear in the United Nations text.The A f r i c a n
Charter on Human and Pe o p l e ’s Rights and the Islamic
Charter of Human Rights reflect a conception of
human rights espoused by leaders of countries in
those regions and by at least some of the people who
live in them.
Between the United Nations human rights
conferences in Teheran in 1968 and Vienna in 1993,
as well as in other international fora , the organization’s
D e c l a ration came under fierce criticism.At times some
have even publicly asked whether the 1948 document
could be “touched up”,since it cannot be replaced
a l t o g e t h e r. They argue in favour of including the
concerns of cultures overlooked by the text’s original
a u t h o r s, blinded as they were by a Western world
v i e w. It would be the height of irony if the 1948
D e c l a ration were made universal at last by taking
into account specific cutural features of individual
countries.
Two sides soon confronted each other. Th e
advocates of universality,who consider it dangerous
to renegotiate the Declara t i o n , have clashed with
those who would introduce clauses relating to their
specific cultures, some of which have only a distant
kinship with respect for rights of the individual.The
stand-off came to a head in the first half of the
n i n e t i e s. In Vienna and elsewhere, s e v e ral A s i a n
countries that challenged the Declara t i o n ’s universal
character in the name of Asian values joined forces
with the most conservative Muslim states to oppose
the We s t ’s efforts to have the document accepted as
universal.
Each side actually used human rights to justify its own
political tra n s g r e s s i o n s.The West has invoked them to
officially carry out international police operations since
the end of the Cold Wa r, while the opposing camp
casually violated them for the sake of “ va l u e s ”t h a t
are often their negation. Such instrumentalization has
hardly served the cause of human rights. But it has
driven home the point that a discussion on updating the
D e c l a ration would open up a Pa n d o ra ’s box of unknown
d e m o n s. The most recent international texts
acknowledge the legitmacy of “ c u l t u ral and religious
s p e c i fic i t y ” , often to the great displeasure of many
human rights groups.H o w e v e r, the universal chara c t e r
of individual rights has been solemnly upheld.
The relative lull in the confrontation between
advocates of universality and partisans of cultura l
relativism is cause for celebration but, r e g r e t t a b l y,
political exploitation of the human rights issue has
overshadowed the real debate. Many activists, in the
North and the South, believe it would be useful to
consolidate human rights by involving all the world’s
cultures in legitimizing them. By exploring all the
various facets of human rights, a common vision
might emerge of the human condition and the
necessary respect it is due that would bring peoples
together instead of drive them apart. That is the
f o u n d a t i o n , those advocates argue, on which to build
the universal human rights of tomorrow. n
