Enrolling a child at the local public school is
a painless exercise for most European
parents—unless of course, their child
happens to be “ d i f f e r e n t .” In that case,
where they live is still likely to determine
whether the child is welcomed into a
regular classroom or guided towards a
special school.
“Having a child with Down’s
s y n d r o m e, I realized that the school was
not against the principle but was
apprehensive because it lacked the means
to welcome her,” recalls Sophie Cluzel, a
mother of four living in a Paris suburb.
What ensued was a battle, via an
a s s o c i a t i o n , with the Education Ministry
to win the right to a special assistant, 8 0
percent financed by the state and reserved
for the 18-to-26 age bracket as part of a
pro-youth employment policy. H a v i n g
been granted her request, Cluzel went

knocking on company doors to come up
with the remaining 20 percent. N o w, a s
part of a collective of parents representing
both physically and mentally handicapped
c h i l d r e n , funds for 20 more such assistants
have been granted. “If it weren’t for the
drive by families, you wouldn’t get
a n y w h e r e. Even if school is compulsory,
too much rests on the goodwill of teachers
or inspectors.”
A shift from a medical model 
to an inclusive approach
Since a government-commissioned
report lamented Fr a n c e ’s slow progress
on the integration front, a set of widely
applauded measures have been introduced
to speed up the process,notably by getting
different groups—parents, education and
social workers—talking with each other.
They are not alone in this quest:along with
Fi n l a n d ,Greece and the Netherlands,m o r e
than half of the country’s disabled students
are in special schools.At the other end of
the spectrum, I t a l y, a country deeply
i n fluenced by the anti-psychiatry
movement of the late 1960s, presents the
most extreme example of an all-out
integration policy, with less than two
percent of handicapped children in special
s c h o o l s, followed by Spain and Po r t u g a l ,
with roughly 18 percent. But does this
necessarily mean that integration is the
only politically acceptable route?
First of all, it is not always an either- o r
s c e n a r i o, since many countries have
“multi-track systems” offering a wider
choice, notably special classes in regular
schools with certain shared hours. B u t
considerable efforts over the past 10 to 15
years to make schools more inclusive—
open to all children—has changed the
way of looking at handicaps.“There has
been a shift from a medical model
towards a more pedagogical approach,
starting from the principle that children
have different capacities and needs,” s a y s
Victoriana Soriano from the European
A g e n cy for Development in Special
Needs Education, which has conducted
in-depth studies on the issue.
In the current climate, c o u n t r i e s

B reaking down the divide
Europe is all for giving its “different” children a place in regular schools, but the debate
over integration is far from sealed

would be hard put to take an anti-
inclusion line.What prevails is a system of
“guided choice.” The UN community,
notably via UN E S C O, has been
instrumental in advocating inclusion.Th e
European Commission makes integration
a guiding principle of its education
programmes. “From there on,it is up to
member states to apply these principles
according to their systems,” says the
C o m m i s s i o n ’s Georgia Henningsen.“A l l
our activities aim to stimulate action and
raise awareness,” she says, referring to
p r o j e c t s, networks and research
conducted on furthering integration.“ Th e
advantage of an integrated approach,”
she says,“is that when you make a special
effort for those with special needs on the
teaching front, everyone profit s,b e c a u s e
there are always students at the back of
the class.”
But for everyone to profit , that extra
little effort has to be made.“Inclusion can
work perfectly well under certain
c i r c u m s t a n c e s, but those are not
commonly met,” says the OE C D’s Peter
E v a n s, a special education expert. Fo r
o n e, “teacher training is not a very
inclusive exercise.” In some countries,
student teachers spend no more than
twelve hours of their whole training on
disabled students, in others half a year,
while in yet others it is part of the weekly
s c h e d u l e.The result is a fear of losing face
before the unknown.“ Teachers don’t have
the tools and they’re aware of it,” s a y s
S o r i a n o. Not surprisingly, teacher unions
tend to be in favour of maintaining the
status quo, and represent a “ s u b s t a n t i a l
f o r c e,”according to Evans,when it comes
to making decisions on integration.E v e n
when they do fully endorse the integration
p r i n c i p l e, many teachers and school
principals complain about the
disproportionate work load involved
through extra report writing, m e e t i n g s
with expert committees, e t c.
Transforming special schools
into resource centres
The other camp that governments
have to contend with are the special
education structures themselves.The task
underway—as in Norway, Denmark and
the Netherlands—is to transform them
into “resource centres” for mainstream
s c h o o l s, tapping the expertise of their
teachers and staff without cutting jobs.
Then there is the question of how teachers
skilled at working with disabled children
are treated. In Fr a n c e, for example, t h e r e
is a dearth of candidates applying to
become specialized teachers. In a Parisian
primary school with two classes for
children with Down’s syndrome, n o
specialized teachers applied for the post
when it was advertised.A regular teacher
was hired,who is learning on the job while
waiting for an answer to an application for
further training. According to the school
p r i n c i p a l , “specialized teachers have had
enough of not being recognized.”
For Cor Meijer, a researcher with the
European A g e n cy, financial mechanisms
largely explain the continued discrepancy
between policy and practice. Take the
N e t h e r l a n d s : an integration policy was set
up in the 1960s and 70s but no incentive
was given to encourage the shift.“In fact,
the structure rewards segregation,in spite
of what the government proclaims,” s a y s
M e i j e r,who is Dutch.This is set to change.
Parliament just approved a bill to allocate
funds to regions based on their total
number of children, rather than
distinguishing between those with special
needs and those without, a system that
tends to favour vested interests.
Staging cultural events to
change our perceptions
N u m b e r s, h o w e v e r, tend to say little
about quality, about which there is scant
i n f o r m a t i o n .Some parents strongly believe
that it’s better in special schools,notably in
countries operating a fairly large system.
A recent study in England found that
bullying was “the main factor” d r i v i n g
disabled children out of regular schools.
“ I t ’s not because children are integrated
that the problem is solved,” says Soriano.
“I’m all for the most comprehensive
legislation possible, but we won’t be able
to speak about equal opportunity until
we give top priority to more in-depth work
on pedagogy.”The problem is particularly
acute at the secondary level.“ S p e c i a l i z e d
schools are in a delicate situation, t h e y
see teenagers arriving who cannot go any
further in the mainstream,”says Catherine
C o u s e r g u e,a French doctor specialized in
integration matters.“So they think that at
the end of the day regular schools are a
failure and that kids would have been
better off there from the outset.”
Meijer foresees another paradox on
the horizon: schools are increasingly held
accountable for quality—namely turning
out good crops of students—while being
asked to cater for lower-achieving groups.
A r e n ’t the most vulnerable children likely
to be pushed out? 
Beyond this is the issue of mentality.
For Francis Degryse, the parent of a
handicapped seven-year old daughter,
the key is to “change our perception of
the disabled.” He notched up an
improbable success by getting a blind
director to stage a show featuring only
disabled actors to a full house in a
prestigious Paris venue. Such cultural
events have now become a yearly affair,
and aim to become European. Through
his association “ Without Drums Nor
Tr u m p e t s,” he organizes puppet shows
in regular schools to “take some of the
d r a m a ” out of mental and physical
h a n d i c a p s, has produced a CD and is
looking for backers to set up a web T Vo n
the disabled.“You have to know how to
impose yourself and be tenacious. For we
can all live together.”
This is probably the most convincing
argument for inclusion. “Parents in
general are very supportive, they believe
it is a good lesson in tolerance for their
children,” says a French principal whose
school includes two special classes for
the handicapped.“ You can always give all
the civic education courses you want,”
says Cousergue “but when you have a
handicapped mate next to you in class
e v e r y d a y, i t ’s a different story. It influ e n c e s
you for adult life: the day you have a
handicapped colleague, y o u ’ll look at
things in an altogether different way.” ■
