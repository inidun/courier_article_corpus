THE HEART OF THE MATTER
Five years ago, on April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin whirled
into orbit around the earth and became the first man in
space. We open this issue devoted to international
co-operation in space research and exploration with
statements addressed to the Unesco Courier by
two famous astronauts: Yuri Gagarin and Walter
Schirra. In 1962, Walter Schirra accomplished a solo
spaceflight and in 1965 he was one of four astronauts
who made the first manned rendezvous in space.
Yuri Gagarin:
On the occasion of the 5th anniver¬
sary of the first manned space flight,
I greet all who work in the field of
space research, and especially my
colleagues, the American and Soviet
astronauts. The age of cosmic flight
and bold research ventures in the
far reaches of space has begun. I am
firmly convinced that greater inter¬
national co-operation is needed for
the mastery and utilization of outer
space so that each manned flight
and each launching of a space
station or laboratory for cosmic
research can serve man in positive
and peaceful ways.

Walter M. Schirra:
It is perhaps an obvious fact, but
nonetheless an important one, that
there are no boundaries a hundred
miles up, and there are none visible
on earth when it is viewed from a
space capsule.
That the exploration of space goes
beyond political boundaries was no
doubt in the minds of the framers of
the Space Act of 1958. The act
which established the National Aero¬
nautics and Space Administration
and dedicated our nation to the
exploration of space included as one
of its objectives co-operation with
other nations and groups of nations
in the peaceful applications of our
space efforts.
