THE SCHOOL BEYOND EBOLI
by Jean Marabini

CRACO is a village in southern Italy.
It lies on a hilltop, somewhere
on the borders of Lucania and
Calabria, in a region rich in folk
traditions, which is still little known
even to most Italians.
Describing this part of Italy
beyond Eboli the novelist Carlo Levi
has said that it is like a series of
each with its own folklore
and ancient traditions. The description
is apt since in these mountain valleys
thunder, heavy rain began to fall and
we burst a tyre.
But the next day the "evil eye"
seemed to have been exorcised. The
sun was shining brightly and I set
off to visit the 234 children who are
attending school in the converted
barn of a former monastery. The
headmistress, a stout and friendly
woman, was anxious about the lack of
space in her school. "We get a sub¬
sidy from the Government and from

take many paths, often

Greek and Albanian are spoken- as
as Italian. Byzantine churches
adjoin cave dwellings, and Protestant
sects still subsist together with Jewish
communities and so-called "Tolstoy-
an" hermits.
Craco is a typical village of these
parts. I arrived there late one after¬
noon over a rough, winding road
fringed with olive trees which seemed
to be clinging to the bare hillsides.
A storm was threatening and my
driver remarked: "You have to beware
of the evil eye in this part of the
country/' As we drove into the village
we met a group of women dressed in
black; there was a sudden clap of
the Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion, to serve a hot meal at midday",
she explained. "But our improvised
dining hall is so cramped that the
children have to eat standing up."
It was quite a task, the headmis¬
tress told me, to persuade parents to
send their children to school instead
of putting them to work in the fields.
Of course, the 3,000 sheep, 60 cows
and 300 mules owned by the villagers
all need looking after. But thanks to
the skill and diplomacy of her eight
assistant-teachers, the headmistress
has gradually succeeded in winning
over the parents.
In one of the classrooms, I met
The Unesco Courier
eight-year-old Maria who comes to
school with her goat because there Is
no one to look after it at home. The
goat bleated pitifully during the
arithmetic class but at lunchtime it
provided a large bowl of fnilk for its
young mistress. There seemed to be
more boys than girls in the school,
probably because you must be able
to read to obtain a driver's licence for
a motor-bike or car. Unfortunately,
this obligation does not reduce the
number of accidents
on the roads. How¬
ever, it is not so much
because of motor-bikes
as through the Go¬
vernment's efforts that
illiteracy is practically
wiped out in Craco.
But in spite of the
changes wrought by
modern techniques, the
peasants of Calabria
and especially of Luca¬
nia remain very much
attached to their an¬
cient traditions. Side
by side with religious
ceremonies, they still
practise ancient rites
which seem to be the
heritage of a distant,
pre-Christian past. It
is a hard struggle to
eke out an existence on
these barren hillsides,
and their belief in the
power of magic is a
kind of defence against
the uncertainties o f
life. In the end they
almost confuse these
practices with religion.
They believe that on
occasions such as births
and weddings it is par¬
ticularly important to
protect their families
from evil influences.
Many of the school¬
children in Craco still
wear a tiny bag sus¬
pended on a chain round their necks
which contains the ashes of their
umbilical cord. And a nine-year-old
schoolboy, Giorgio, told me how, when
his little brother was born, his
parents made a show of putting the
baby into the oven so as to protect
him all his life from the dangers
of fire.
Similarly it is not unusual for young
people to ask their relations to stand
watch over their house on their wed¬
ding night in order to keep out the
monacello (little monk) a
mischievous goblin whom (Cont'd on

married life. To keep the "little
monk" from doing any harm, a
scythe is placed by the door with its
tip pointing upwards, or newspapers
are laid on the ground. Since the
monacello considers himself obliged to
count every single letter or symbol in
the paper, he will be kept busy for a
long time at least till morning.
Such practices, however, are fast
disappearing. Since the opening of
the school and the introduction of
books and newspapers in the village,
young people view these ancient super¬
stitions with increasing scepticism.
But they still retain their gift of
poetic expression. Tales are told on
winter evenings when the family
gathers round the hearth, and at
funerals long poetic laments are
improvised by the deceased's next-of-
kin and recited by all the mourners.
Schools can play an important part
in helping to improve living condi¬
tions in isolated villages such as
Craco. They are headquarters in the
figi.t against illiteracy and help to
banish out-dated ideas. They can
also help to build up a written record
of the tales and legends composed by
local poets and which form the basis
of a cultural heritage of colourful
and varied folklore and traditions.
NEW PATHS TO THE EAGLE'S NEST
Village of Craco looms against sky like mountain eagle's nest, its houses huddled together in
serried clump. Once practically cut off from new ideas from the outside world, Craco, like
hundreds of other small villages in Calabria and Lucania, has been waging campaign against illite¬
racy since I 947 with support of Italian Government and voluntary organizations. Unesco experts
have also aided these campaigns. Local doctors, engineers, veterinarians and parish priests have
come forward as volunteer teachers of reading and writing for adults. Since opening of new
schools illiteracy has been practically wiped out in many places. Parents now send children to
school (below) instead of putting them to work in the fields or to look after animals.
