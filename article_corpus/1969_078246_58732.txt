PEKING MAN
IN THE APOTHECARY'S SHOP
by G. H. R. von Koenigswald
N,lEANDERTHAL MAN is the
only fossil man of whom we have a
complete skeleton. In the case of all
older discoveries we have only iso¬
lated remains mostly of the victims
of accidents. Thus we find human
bones in limestones, and buried in
sandstones, gravels and rock fissures.
We also find them in medicine
shops and these "paleontological trea¬
sure houses" are certainly the most
remarkable of all. I am, of course,
not talking about just any apothecary
shops, but about Chinese ones where
almost anything which the vegetable,
animal and mineral kingdoms of China
have to offer can be bought.
Such remains are used as ingred¬
ients for medicine and, among various
other medicaments, "dragons' teeth"
are highly prized. These are not,
as their name might suggest, the
teeth of saurians and other large
reptiles, but the fossilized remains of
extinct mammals. It is already over
a century since specimens of this kind
gave us our first insight into the fossil
mammals of China and they have
since proved to be important links in
the research chain leading us back
to fossilized man.
G.H.R. VON KOENIGSWALD, of the Federal
Republic of Germany, has done extensive
research in Indonesia and South China,
where he made important finds concerning
Peking Man. He is professor of paleontology
at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands.
When I was working as a geologist
in Java, we became very interested in
"dragons' teeth". Did they, we won¬
dered, come from Java or from China?
We soon found that they all came
from China, but when we went into
the question more closely we found
that in ancient China there were once
animals which are still living in Indo¬
nesia. The most surprising example
was the orang-outang, the large
anthropoid ape, which still inhabits
Borneo and northern Sumatra.
To be absolutely sure that these
remains came from China, a visit was
made to Hong Kong in 1935, and
the large apothecary shops in the
"Western Market" were thoroughly
combed. The result was astounding.
The harvest included teeth of orang¬
outangs, tapirs, the Malayan bear,
Panda (the friendly Bamboo bears), of
deers, pigs, tigers and many other
animals. But not one single jaw
could we find. Large porcupines had
gnawed away all the bones and teeth
roots and only the crowns of teeth
remained. It was clear that all this
material must actually have come from
southern China.
The largest of all the ape teeth
found had a smooth surface instead
of the fine wrinkles found on an
orang-outang's teeth. I immediately
felt sure that we had come across a
new type of ape of enormous size.
Subsequently, in 1935, on the basis
of this single find I described Gigan-
topithecus, the giant ape of the Chi¬
nese apothecary shops.
Some of my colleagues disagreed,
declaring that the tooth was much too
large for an ape, and one of them,
Professor Weidenreich, at first main¬
tained that it was simply that of a very
large orang-outang. I made further
journeys to China, and in Canton I
found a magnificent upper molar, and
in another apothecary shop in Hong
Kong an unworn lower molar. In
certain respects both these teeth
show much resemblance to the teeth
of man, and Weidenreich, who had
been so sceptical at first, completely
changed his opinion, saying that he
now considered my Gigantopithecus
to have been a huge man. One
German anthropologist even wanted
to change the name to Giganthropus
(anthropus man; pithecus ape), and
even made a fantastic reconstruction
of the jaw bone.
Finally, 22 years after the discovery
of the original tooth, we were able
to reach a more positive conclusion.
On February 17, 1957, my old friend
and colleague, Dr. Pei Wen Chung,
exhibited in Peking an enormous jaw
which had been found in a cave in
Kwangsi, in southern China. It was
a lower jaw with a somewhat less
specialized anterior dentition than that
of the living anthropoid apes. But it
was an ape: the tooth found in the
Hong Kong chemist's shop had not
lied.


Peking Man, a reconstruc¬
tion based on remains
found in the Choukoutien
caves near Peking. He
was capable of chipping
rough tools and maintain¬
ing fires for warmth and
protection, and his brain
was as large as that of
modern man. (See the
Unesco-sponsored "History
of Mankind, Cultural and
Scientific Development";
Volume I: Part 1. "Pre¬
history and the Beginnings
of Civilization" by Jac-
quetta Hawkes; G. Allen
and Unwin Ltd., London).
After Le Gros Clark
The Kwangsi jaw is larger than that
of a gorilla, which means that Gigan-
topithecus itself was larger than this
ape, the largest and most powerful
of anthropoid apes living today. My
Chinese colleagues estimated that it
must have been at least three metres
tall. I am still getting letters from
people asking whether Gigantopithe-
cus might not have been the "abomin¬
able snowman" from the Himalayas,
and people are very disappointed
when I have to tell them that I do
not think so.
Another discovery was made which,
although perhaps not so dramatic,
was no less fruitful. In 1900 a German
engineer named Haberer brought back
a large collection of "dragons' teeth"
to Germany and our first extensive
knowledge of the fossil mammals of
China is based on the description of
these specimens. The most remark¬
able item was a human tooth, extrem¬
ely worn and apparently very old.
It too had come from an apothecary
shop in Peking, and the search for
the fossilized remains of human
beings was therefore concentrated on
this area.
IJ HIS led to a now celebrated
event: the discovery of the Peking Man
(Sinanthropus) of which, in the first
place, a single tooth had been
unearthed. This was claimed by Pro¬
fessor Davidson Black to be a hitherto
unknown fossil man. A skull found
in 1929 by Dr. Pei, proved that Black
was right. Successful excavations
are still being made on the same site.
The teeth of the Peking Man are
very large and similar to some of
those found among our apothecary
shop specimens from Hong Kong.
There were also smaller teeth . and
because of the red clay which was
found on one part of the jaw, Father
Teilhard de Chardin (whose name is
also linked with the discovery of the
Peking Man) identified it as coming
from a Late Stone Age horizon which
is often to be found in caves. This
was the jaw of a "modern" man, only
a few thousand years old. One of the
teeth is so similar to the first tooth
found in the Peking apothecary shop
that both must have come from the
same strata. It was, therefore, a
modern tooth which put us on the
track of Peking Man I
The discovery of the Peking Man
brought the solution to an earlier
problem: whether the remarkable flat
skull cap dug up In Java by E. Dubois
in 1890 was that of a man or an ape.
In 1891 an indisputably human thigh
bone was added to the earlier find
though there was no direct proof that
both discoveries belonged to the
same subject. Dubois combined the
two and h;s "erect walking Java Ape-
Man", the Pithecanthropus erectus,
remained the most controversial fossil
for nearly 40 years.
The main reason for this was that
the ear region of the Java skull was
missing and it is precisely this part
of the skull which makes it possible
to reach a clear decision. In the case
of the Peking Man a complete skull
was available and in spite of his pri¬
mitive characteristics he was, anato¬
mically speaking, indisputably human.
This is also shown by the simple stone
implements and the layer of ashes
found at the place of discovery, which
makes it clear that he already knew
about tools and fire.
The shape of the Peking skull was
so similar to that of the controversial
Java find that Black concluded that
the Peking Man and the Java Man
must have been close relatives. The
remarkable thing was that Dubois, the
discoverer of Pithecanthropus, dis¬
agreed with this theory. Although he
had always previously defended the
human characteristics of his find, he
now denied that it was related in any
way to Peking Man and even went
so far as to declare that his Pithecan¬
thropus was an ape.
The only way to resolve such a
confused situation was to redouble
our efforts in searching for the Java
Man. We found a promising site in
central Java with exposed strata in
which there were many remains of
the same extinct deer, antelopes and
elephants as those discovered by
Dubois in association with his Pitne-
canthropus.
FcOR years we worked in this
area. During the rainy season the
downpour of water scattered . the
loosened fossils over the hillsides and
we eagerly went to work, soon assem¬
bling a large collection of teeth and
bones of extinct animals. This includ¬
ed the remains of hippopotamuses no
longer found in Asia various ele¬
phants, deer, pigs, tigers, rhinoceros
and other animals.
Then, one day in September 1937,
we made an important find. One of
my enthusiastic Indonesian collectors
came across a piece of skull. The
next day I hastened to the spot and
promised the workers ten cents for
every piece of skull they brought me.
I myself soon found a large piece of
the frontal bone, but my collectors
only brought me small fragments.
Too late I discovered what had
happened; the workers, had broken up
all the larger pieces in order to make
more moneyl I was eventually given
more than 40 pieces, but fortunately
there was very little difficulty about
joining them together since the skull
was over one centimetre thick.
It soon became clear that we had
actually found a second Pithecanthro¬
pus skull. It would be difficult to
find two skulls in a modern anthropo¬
logical collection which are so com¬
pletely alike as Pithecanthropus I and II,
although the places of discovery were
30 miles apart. The new find was
finally complete enough to include the
ear regions on both sides of the skull.
One glance was enough: Pithecan¬
thropus had undoubtedly been a
human being. After 46 years the
puzzle had finally been solved.
