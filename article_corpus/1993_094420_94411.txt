THE UNESCO COURIER - JUNE 1993
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
The Courier's "Greenwatch"
section is now a year old. In
the course of looking into
programmes in progress
around the world and listing
available environmental edu¬
cation documents, we have come
across many initiatives that we
wanted to share with our readers.
The time has now come to take
stock of the most significant exper¬
iments carried out in the South and
the North alike, of the obstacles they
have encountered and the solutions
that have been proposed.
Unesco and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP)
define environmental education as
"a permanent process in which indi¬
viduals gain awareness of their
environment and acquire the knowl¬
edge, values, skills, experiences, and
also the determination which will
enable them to actindividually and
collectivelyto solve present and
future environmental problems".
Experience shows that there is an
enormous gap between theory and
practice. The object is not just to
increase knowledge, but also to
change ways of thinking and the
behaviour patterns arising from
them. It is relatively easy to com¬
municate information, to explain,
for instance, why glass bottles
should be sent back for recycling

\ People will be unwilling to put
recommendations into practice
unless they clearly see the justifica¬
tion for them. A farmer will take
some persuading that by cutting
down the timber he badly needs he
may be causing erosion and
flooding downstream. It is pointless
to recommend expensive environ¬
mental solutions where there is no
money. Itwill be hard to convince a
manufacturer to stop pouring toxic
wastes into a rivereven though he
knows it is dangerousas long as it
is common practice and the author¬
ities have nothing to offer in the way

or why chemical substances should
not be thrown out with household
waste. It is harder, and takes longer,
to alter the mindsets that underlie
certain types ofbehaviourthe atti¬
tude of some African women, for
instance, who paradoxically prefer
murky riverwater to the clean water
from a standpipe because "it has
some taste", the attitude of people
who pour used motor oil into the
sewage system, or that ofpeople who
have always burned down forests to
make clearings for grazing land.
UNEP and Unesco have put great
efforts into the establishment ofan
International Environmental Edu¬
cation Programme (IEEP). Some
excellent documents have been
produced, but they need to be made
more widely available, in more lan¬
guage versions and at lower cost,
and in any case a document, no
matter how good it is or how well
translated, is all but useless unless it
is adapted to the specific needs of its
intended readers. It is essential,
especially in the developing coun¬
tries, for local concerns and realities
to be understood, then explained
by respected community members.

of collection, disposal or recycling
facilities.
There may also be serious con¬
flicts of interest between govern¬
ment departments. While one sells
large, sometimes excessive, quanti¬
ties ofwood in order to meet foreign
debt repayments, another builds
roads, and a third is looking for new
energy sources, the department
with responsibility for the environ¬
ment may not have an easy time
putting across its point ofview.
Effective environmental educa¬
tion may, however, trigger vast
movements of public opinion that
can sway government policy. When,
for example, it was planned to con¬
struct a hydroelectric dam at Nam
Choan in the Thung Yai Naresuan
Wildlife Sanctuary, the largest forest
in Thailand, a nationwide campaign
was immediately undertaken to
mentin the form of demonstra¬
tions, media campaigns or civil dis¬
obedience has subversive
overtones, as in the case of certain
confrontations staged by anti-
nuclear activists inWestern Europe,
or Greenpeace actions against
French underground nuclear tests
in the Pacific, while the seringueiro
(Brazilian rubber tapper) Chico
Mendes was murdered for wanting
to protect his forest.
To be credible, environmental
information must be objective and
must include and explain contra¬
dictoryviews. The nature ofthe polit¬
ical context is also of considerable
importance: those involved in envi¬
ronmental education must enjoy
civil rights and be legally protected.
Despite Unesco's efforts to
encourage press freedom, journalists
in many countries are all too often
Despite all the statements of
intent produced by international
conferences, development and the
protection of the environment still
do not live in harmony together.
"Powerful economic interests,"
explains an expert, "tend to threaten
both the livelihood of the local pop¬
ulation and the natural environ¬
ment." Environmental education
must adapt to this situation and
invent new strategies.

(English-French) document published by

operation and Development (OECD),

and dangers of the project, which
included the flooding of a unique
ecosystem and the extermination

of public opinion, the project was
cancelled and the sanctuary was

WORLD
FORESTS-ADVANCE
AND RETREAT
The Forests Committee of the
United Nations Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization (FAO), meeting
in March 1993 in Rome, noted that
during the 1980s 154 million
hectares of tropical forest disap¬
peared, whereas forest resources in
the industrial countries grew.
According to an FAO study, forests
cover 56 per cent of the land sur¬
face area in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 24 per cent in Africa,
and 35 per cent in Asia where,
though this is the region where
deforestation has been most
intense, 26 million hectares were
reforested in the same period of
time. Forest cover in developed
countries is constantly increasing,
but the forest is under threat from
air pollution, fires, and certain wild
animals.

A SOLAR SUMMIT
The potential of solar power will be
discussed at a "World Solar Summit"
to be held at Unesco Headquarters
in Paris from 5 to 9 July 1993. The
meeting will take place exactly 20
years after a similar international
congress, "The Sun in the Service of
Mankind", helped to arouse interest
in solar energy. According to the
organizers, this year's event should
provide "an opportunity to take a
substantial step forward in formu¬
lating a World Plan of Action to
develop and use renewable energy
resources effectively". The term
"solar" is being used symbolically to
designate all renewable energy
resources and technologies, from
solar electricity to biomass, wind
and ocean power. But until oil
becomes more expensive or scarcer,
who will be prepared to invest
in projects that remain on the
drawing board forwant of real polit¬
ical support?
FUELLING A
CONTROVERSY
The Proalcool programme launched
in Brazil in 1975 appears to have
some drawbacks. Methanol, used
as a petrol substitute, is made from
sugar cane. In order to produce
more cane, the Atlantic forest in the
Nordeste province continues to be
cleared and has dwindled from one
million to 135,000 square kilome¬
tres. The Secretaries of the Envi¬
ronment of the states in this part of
the country are aware of the threat
and have joined in a forest conser¬
vation programme run by the orga¬
nization Mata Atlántica which is
alreadybeing put into effect in eight
southern and southeastern
Brazilian states. The $200-million
programme is supported by the
United Nations through Unesco.
Which is preferable: green fuel or a
green forest?
BLEACH VERSUS
BACTERIA
Research conducted in 1989 by Pro¬
fessor Dodin of the Institut Pasteur
in Paris confirmed that Javel water,
a common bleach containing
sodium hypochlorite, salt and
water, is one of the most powerful
and cheapest disinfectants avail¬
able. Two or three drops of 12°
bleach are enough to kill the bac¬
teria in a litre ofwater in thirty sec¬
onds, or to disinfect raw vegetables.
The advantage of this for the coun¬
tries of the South is that it obviates
the need to boil water, thereby
saving wood, while providing effec¬
tive protection against cholera.
What is more, this humble sub¬
stance is environment-friendly: it
self-destructs in the course of its
action, releasing oxygen and leaving
just a little salt behind.

RETURN OF THE GRAY WOLF
American environmentalists and the National Wildlife
Federation are campaigning to reintroduce the gray
wolf into Yellowstone National Park in the northwestern
United States. More than 80,000 wolves were killed in the
state of Montana between 1883 and 1918, and the
species completely disappeared from the area in the
1930s. Local farmers are not happy about a project
likely to expose their livestock to this ill-famed predator.
They argue that there are still plenty of gray wolves in
Alaska and Canada and that there is no real threat to the
survival of the species. The reintroduction of the lynx in
the French Vosges and Jura mountains poses a similar
problem: even though the move is theoretically
favourable to the balance of the ecosystem, it creates
hostility on the part of local people. Is it better to over¬
ride such objections or to accept a "simplification" of
nature? : ¿ù.. 3Ci
GULF MARINE LIFE IN JEOPARDY
A research vessel chartered by the U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) returned
from a six-month mission in the Gulfwith dismal news.
Marine life on the Saudi Arabian coasts has virtually dis¬
appeared and 90 per cent of the coral reefs off the coast
of Kuwait have been destroyed. The destruction of
Kuwaiti oil wells by the retreating Iraqi army sent some
1.3 billion litres of oil into the waters of the Gulf, 25
times as much as the wrecked tanker Exxon Valdez
spilled onto the coast ofAlaska in 1989. Whoever said
theGulfWarwasa"cleanwar"?
WHAT TO DO WITH WASTE?
According to the American nongovernmental organi¬
zation INFORM, the 180 million tonnes of waste gen¬
erated in the United States each year would form a
tower 42 kilometres high if packed tightly onto a foot¬
ball field. This evocative image is all the more dis¬
turbing because per capita garbage output is increasing,
while existing disposal sites are saturated and com¬
munities are opposed to new ones being established in
their neighbourhood. INFORM, which is backed by
foundation and government subsidies and by indi¬
vidual and corporate donations, aims to mobilize all the
interested parties. Among other activities, it publishes
simple waste-prevention advice for schools and a series
of intelligent, practical manuals. The contact address is:

1993, YEAR OF INDIGENOUS
PEOPLES
"We are just one more acting element in the biosphere,
no more and no less important than the others, and we
haven't the right to submit the other elements to our
excessive needs and our domination," writes Rémy
Kurtness, chiefof the Montagnais Council ofLac-Saint-
Jean in Quebec, Canada. The Montagnais people live on
a vast area located in Quebec and Labrador. "Our fore¬
fathers always rotated their hunting grounds, just like
farmers who periodically leave their lands fallow to let
the soil rest. Land can be productive as long as it is
respected. It cannot overproduce, and it certainly
cannot be bled to death." The United Nations has pro¬
claimed 1993 the Year of Indigenous Peoples, providing
an opportunity for everyone to share the wisdom of
those who love their land and are devoted to harmo¬
nizing development with nature and wildlife. 27

INITIATIVES
On this poge we
launch a feature
entitled
"Initiatives",
which will
highlight
examples of
environmental
action in
different parts of
the world. We
invite readers to
send us details of
their own
experiences in
this field for
possible
publication in
this new column.
About 400 kilometres northwest
of Yaounde, the capital of
Cameroon, a small kingdom of
some 7,500 square kilometres,
perched 1,000 metres up on a
plateau, enjoys the good life.
From his residence in Foumban,
Sultan Ibrahim Mbombo Njoya
reigns over 350,000 Bamoun.
When he succeeded his father in
July 1992, he became the nine¬
teenth ruler of a dynasty founded,
so he claims, in the fourteenth
century. His grandfather built a
splendid three-storeyed ochre and
pink palace in 1920, its 60-metre-
long façade decorated with carved
wooden balconies. Unesco took
part in its renovation eight years
ago.
Blessed with very fertile land
and generous rainfall, the popula¬
tion is self-sufficient in food. Not
only are the trees all heavily laden
with fruit, but Foumban is also a
model of environmental manage¬
ment. Waste ground is weeded to
prevent poisonous snakes from
breeding there, and every available
square metre is cultivated. Beans,
corn and cassava grow in plots
alongside the footpaths, rows of
banana trees line the roadsides,
and the huge spear-like leaves of
the macabo sprout up above the
ditches. Foumban is a fine
example of the kind of urban gar¬
dens whose establishment is
encouraged by the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO).
