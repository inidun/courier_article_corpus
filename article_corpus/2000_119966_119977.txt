The continent that has adopted a
single curr e n cy is a long way from
unity on home educat i o n . A l t h o u g h
d ata remains scarce, s u p p o rt groups in seve-
ral countries claim that they are receiving
increasing numbers of requests from parents
looking for altern at i ves to formal school sys-
t e m s , a movement being matched by legi s-
l at i ve attempts to curtail its practice.
According to Amanda Petrie, one of a
handful of European researchers on the
subject,there is an underlying thread run-
ning through recent legi s l at i ve changes sug-
gesting that “if you are not in school, you
are not learn i n g .” In Ireland, an Educat i o n
( We l fare) Bill put forward for discussion in
1999 treats home education as a school
attendance problem,rather than as a right
guaranteed by the Constitution, w h i c h
declares that the pri m a ry educator of the
child is the fa m i l y. With the expressed
intention of cracking down on sects, t h e
French parliament voted a new law in
December 1998 obliging parents to follow
the national curriculum more closely and
i n s p e c t o rs to visit their children once a ye a r
in the home.The law was passed by a hand-
ful of deputies without consulting with
r e p r e s e n t at i ves of the home education com-
m u n i t y. For Elyane Delmarès of the French
support group Les Enfants d’Abord, “it’s a
bogus argument. The state already has a
whole arsenal of weapons to fight sects.
This is really about the state having a stron-
ger hold on education.”
S u p p o rt groups say these controls cast
home education in a negat i ve light and
r e flect misconceptions about how learn i n g
takes place outside school. For Pe t ri e ,i m p o-
sing a national curriculum and allowing ins-
p e c t o rs into the home are two examples.T h e
first assumes that “the state knows what edu-
c ation is, takes a certain form u l a , and if yo u
apply this form u l a , your child is going to be
fin e .” The second discri m i n ates against
people who are “not upper middle classes
with reams of bookcases in the home.”
The value of
informal learning
But even in countries where the prac-
tice is tightly restri c t e d , ambiguity often
p r e va i l s. In Spain, where schooling is com-
puslory up to 16 years of age—special cir-
cumstances aside—a court ruled in 1999
in favour of parents from Almeria who are
e d u c ating their seve n - year-old child. I n
G e rm a ny, where home education is illegal,
s e veral families have gone to court and paid
fines but they have been allowed to conti-
nue the practice. After returning from a
posting in Micronesia, Dorothee Becker
and her husband found that their two chil-
dren were unable to adapt to the German
school system. “It didn’t offer the va ri e t y
we had hoped for, especially in languages
and science,” s ays Becker, who has been to
c o u rt once. In the Netherlands, a u t h o ri t i e s
h ave refused 90 per cent of homeschooling
r e q u e s t s , acccording to Syne Fo n k , head of
the support group Syntax. In response, a
growing number of parents are starting up
their own private schools.
Increasing research on home educat i o n
would be a first step to breaking through
some of the misconceptions surrounding the
fie l d , still widely shunned by the academic
c o m m u n i t y. Studies are most advanced in
the UK,which has Europe’s strongest home
education community, with an estimated
10,000 children.There can be one hundred
different reasons for making the commit-
m e n t ,r a n ging from a simple question of phi-
l o s o p hy, to concern about bullying and beha-
vioural problems at school to religious
c o nv i c t i o n s. Alan T h o m a s , a visiting fellow
at the Unive rsity of London Institute of Edu-
c at i o n ,c a rried out in depth-research on 100
families in Britain and Australia to prov i d e
one of the first detailed accounts of how
parents go about the task of teaching their
children at home.Besides shorter lessons and
extra individual at t e n t i o n ,Thomas noted the
far-reaching impact of informal and shared
l e a rning and the importance of conve rs at i o n
that is all too often lacking in school. He
found that children had “high confidence in
their ability to learn ,high self-esteem and are
socially mature in a way many who have been
to school are not. T h e y ’ ve not experi e n c e d
fa i l u r e . If you don’t understand something,
you deal with it there and then.”
Pe t rie takes the debate one step furt h e r ,
emphasizing that the right to home educa-
tion should be a principle of democracy. “ I
think it comes down to a question of how
much confidence the state has in the parent’s
ability to know what is right for their ow n
c h i l d r e n .The debate hinges on that .” ■
