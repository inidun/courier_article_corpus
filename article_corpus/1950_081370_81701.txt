THE RtCHT TO WRITE
AND THE RICHT TO READ
of Unesco's Member States,
newly independent. Like many
under-developed countries, this
young nation suffers from a
scarcity of national literature.
Unlike the peoples of Europe,
whose national cultures have
been inspired and enriched
by centuries of each other's
work, its people have seen few
translations from other lan-
guages. To-day, badly in need
of the creative work of other
nations, they are being han-
dicapped through the com-
plications of international
copyright law.
Rights of Three Groups
SIMPLE to state, the problemis difficult to resolve.
The rights of three groups
must be balanced. The author
must be protected, the publish-
er who produces and dis-
tributes his work, and the
public. The public deserves
the unimpeded circulation of
by William Gaddis
original work. The publisher
must be paid for his work in
bringing it to the public.. And
the author, besides being paid
for his work, must have the
right to approve its distribution
in the form in which his
creative genius led him to
make it. When the French
Copyright Law of 1793 was
passed, the author's right was
called"the most sacred, the
most unassailable, and the
most personal of all forms of
property.
In Europe the right of the
author has always been regard-
ed as a natural right, while in
America it is acquired some-
what like a patent on an
invention. A book in France
is automatically copyrighted
when it is published, but in
the United States for instance
the author must go through
legal formalities, or lose his
copyright. In many counfries
motion pictures, radio and
television programmes which
publicize. original work are not
yet subject to copyright law.
Some countries, where the
benefits of science and culture
are most needed, have no
pecial copyright laws at all.
Equal Protection For All
EFFORTS have been madeat internat√≠onal co-oper-
ation in this maze of legal
differences. The Berne Con-
vention of 1886 is an active
agency in promoting copyright
agreements among most Eur-
cpean countries, members of
the British Commonwealth
and Brazil. Seven inter-Amer-
ican conferences have been
held, but the conventions that
came out of them have not
been far-reaching. Most of
Africa is outside international
agreements.
Experts, called together by
Unesco from all parts of the
world, have recommended
drafting a new convention
which as many nations as
po ; siMe wiU be able to ratify
without infringement upon
their own laws. The main
point would be that each
nation agree to give to any
author, regardless of his
nationality, the same protec-
tion that they give their own
authors.
The Copyright Division of
Unesco's Department of Cul-
tural Activities has analyzed
the copyright laws of more
than sixty countries, and
classified them according to
countries, subjects and dates.
The subjects have been cata-
logued and exhaustive reports
have been prepared, to give
legal experts a world copyright
picture easily and quickly. In
October, Unesco hopes to
convene a new Committee of
Experts in Washington to
recommend further action on
international copyright law. It
will be an important part in
Unesco's over-all effort to
break down more of the
barriers in men's minds which
make impossible the under-
standing necessary for peace
"BOOKS", wrote HenryDavid Thoreau,"are
the treasured wealth
of the world, the fit inheri-
tance of generations and na-
tions". To-day almost a cen-
turn after Thoreau wrote these
words, most members of the
world's family of nations have
still been unable to claim their
rightful share of this inter-
national heritage. Many
countries, old in civilization
but young in independence,
are cut off from the books
which are as vital to their
social and economic develop-
ment as technological advice
and equipment.
What stands between these
people and the books which
will help them catch up with
the scientific, social and cul-
tural progress of other coun-
tries ? Apart from the barrier
of different languages, most
of the reasons stem from
economic causes. Among these
are copyright laws.
Just how copyright laws can
create barriers between people
and knowledge was shown
recently in a report from one
