compensate damage from oil spills has already
d i s t ri buted some $267 million—a pittance
considering that in Germany cleaning up an
oil-fouled beach costs between $2,800 and
$5,500 per tonne of sludge. What’s more, the
fund does not cover damage caused by routine
discharges at sea.
IMO policy towards the offshore industry
has also been criticized.The suggestion in 1996
that operational discharges of wastes from off-
shore installations should be regulated like ope-
rational discharge from ships had the oil indus-
try up in arms. To this day, the offshore indus-
try’s discharges are still excluded from the
London Convention, which regulates the dum-
ping of wastes at sea.
Similarly, when in 1995 Denmark’s govern-
ment proposed a moratorium on the submer-
sion of offshore oil rigs, countries with very
strong ties to the oil industry closed ranks and
protested against the measure to protect their
short-term interests, opposing a policy that
could have given the steel recycling industry a
major boost. ■
