                                      guy Debonnet, a programme specialist 
                  in charge of natural heritage at unesco’s world heritage centre, 
                             speaks about the danger facing wildlife.
Post-confLIct sItuatIons 
can be worse than 
the confLIcts themseLves 
What is the impact of conflict 
situations on wild life? 
Wild life is particularly exposed in 
developing countries during a pe-
riod of conflict because that’s when 
the usual protective structures dis-
integrate. Furthermore, the armed 
forces present are often poorly re-
munerated, or not at all. So they have 
to find their own means of subsis-
tence. That was the case in Ethiopia, 
Sudan and also in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC). 
In this context, poaching is a means 
of earning money. In addition, ani-
mals provide natural game that’s 
available. Thus, during the conflict 
that raged in DRC from 1996 on, 
the elephant population living in 
the heritage sites was decimated. 
This is an animal that is particu-
larly exposed because it provides 
not only meat but also tusks with 
a high market value. 
The white rhinoceros also suf-
fered the consequences of this 
conflict. According to the most re-
cent estimates, there are only four 
individuals left. If these figures are 
accurate, the species could die out 
definitively in the very near future. 
The paradox is that post-conflict 
situations can turn out to be even 
worse because armed groups 
are idle, often. That’s when they 
become uncontrollable because 
they still have their weapons and 
no one has any power over them 
any more.

Interview by Agnès Bardon of UNESCO’s Bureau of Public Information 

When a country is completely 
disorganized by war, are there 
measures that can be taken 
to protect certain species?
Animal protection operations can 
be supported, as we did in heri-
tage sites in the DRC, by making it 
possible for monitoring activities to 
continue. In that country, UNESCO 
took charge of paying the salaries of 
park rangers in the five World Heri-
tage sites from 2000 to 2004. 
This work paid off, because
the population of mountain 
gorillas not only didn’t drop, 
it grew slightly during 
the conflict. 
We also had good trans-border 
cooperation with some of the 
neighbouring states, even those 
who were involved in the con-
flict, like Uganda. The experience 
showed that if we limit the dam-
age, it’s possible for populations 
to reconstitute themselves. It takes 
time, but it is possible and it also 
benefits the human populations in 
the area. It’s a fact that if the park 
rangers are able to keep armed 
groups away from protected spe-
cies, it also guarantees the villag-
ers a certain security. Don’t forget 
that the poachers are also those 
who loot villages. 
In the RDC, the World Heritage 
Convention allowed us to play 
a key role in inciting warlords to 
respect the conservation areas. 
Once peace is restored, the spe-
cies can start multiplying again. 
On the other hand, when the 
populations are weakened and re-
duced, as was the case with the 
rhinoceros in Garamba National 
Park, poaching can endanger 
species and it’s very difficult after 
to reconstitute them. 
That’s why we should think about 
finding an equivalent for natural 
heritage to the Hague Convention 
for the protection of cultural pro- 
perty in the event of armed conflict.
Can biodiversity really 
be a priority during in a conflict 
or immediate post-conflict 
situation?
The problem is that the harm done 
to biodiversity is not very visible. 
The rhinoceros becoming increas-
ingly rare is much less dramatic 
than the destruction of a monu-
ment like the Bamian Buddhas. 
And too often fatalism prevails 
when it comes to biodiversity, as if 
any action would be in vain. 
On the contrary, it’s crucial to 
bring up the subject during and af-
ter the conflict because we’re talk-
ing about a common good for hu-
manity. The work we accomplished 
in the DRC proves that action is 
possible. 
We must also understand that 
it’s in the interest of local popula-
tions – first, because it represents 
a factor of food supply security. 
And second, because it can mean 
a source of income for the country 
once the war is over. 
In Rwanda, for instance, green 
tourism – motivated mainly by the 
presence of gorillas in the coun-
try – is today the second largest 
source of foreign currency after 
coffee and tea.
The elephant population living in the heritage sites was decimated.

The white rhinoceros could die out definitively in the very 
near future.
