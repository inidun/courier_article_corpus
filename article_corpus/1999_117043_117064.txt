The most cunning criminals have alway s
sought to outsmart police, and cy b e rs-
pace is no exception.The virt u a l ,b o r-
derless unive rse frequented by some 130 mil-
lion netizens provides the detective wri t e r
with eve ry ingredient for a labyrinthine thri l-
l e r: an anonymous interfa c e ,c h a r a c t e rs miles
a p a rt adopting nicknames and fake addresses,
sometimes disguising their identities to enti-
ce a victim into a real-life meeting, or sen-
ding encrypted mat e rials that are just about
impossible for outsiders to decode.
It could be a thri l l e r , except when the
m at e rial being traded is child porn o gr a p hy
and the people enticed are under-age.
Images range from innocent photogr a p h s
of young children with neutral or smiling
expressions to extreme cases: in 1996, m e m-
b e rs of the Orchid Club chat room (see glos-
sary) used a digital camera connected to a
computer to photograph a 10-year-old child
posing in a sexually explicit manner.T h e
pictures were transmitted to other online
ring members who made requests for the
girl to pose in other positions.The ring wa s
an intern ational one,and its members we r e
arrested in several countries.
Innocence in danger
As the online population gr ow s , c o u n-
t ries and organizations are stepping up
efforts to curtail child pornography on the
Internet.By the medium’s very nature,the
venture is intern at i o n a l . In A p ril 1999 UN E S-
CO launched its Innocence in Danger move-
ment that aims to sensitize public opinion
to child porn o gr a p hy on the Internet and
mobilize resources to make the Net safer for
c h i l d r e n . In May, a victory was scored when
Ja p a n , one of the largest producers of child
p o rn mat e ri a l , passed a law banning its pro-
duction and distri bu t i o n . In September, t o p
European and American judicial and poli-
ce offic i a l s , along with industry representa-
tives and NGOs, are meeting in Austria to
discuss strat e gies for reinforcing co-opera-
tion in the field.

T HE DA RK ER SIDE 
OF THE NET
w Cynthia Guttman
To combat child pornography on the Net, there is a strong consensus that governments, 
law enforcement, industry and users each have a role to play
Just how perva s i ve is child porn o gr a p hy
on the Net? In researching her fort h c o m i n g
b o o k , A Pa r e n t s ’Guide to Protecting Children
in Cybers p a c e, Pa rry A f t a b , an A m e ri c a n
cy b e rspace law yer and former director of
Cyberangels, the largest U.S.online safety
and education programme,compiled a list
of 30,000 sites relating to child abuse or pae-
d o p h i l i a , out of an estimated total of 4.3
million sites. Looking more closely at news-
groups (see glossary ) , Rachel O’Connell, a
p s y c h o l o gist from the Unive rsity of Cork
(Ireland) who is co-ordinating a European
research project (COPINE) on the issue,
found that child porn o gr a p hy amounted to
0.07 per cent of around 40,000 newsgr o u p s
wo r l d w i d e . According to Ruth Dixon,
manager of a British hotline run by the
I n t e rnet Watch Fo u n d at i o n , the wo rst mat e-
rial is concentrated in some 20 newsgr o u p s.
Trading child porn o gr a p hy, h owe ve r , is just
one face of the coin, the other is the danger
of children entering online chat groups with
the intention of making friends or shari n g
i n t e r e s t s , and ending up fa c e - t o - face with
a person who turns out to be much older
than claimed and seeking a sexual encoun-
ter.
One of the greatest concerns is that the
I n t e rnet has made child porn o gr a p hy more
visible and accessible, giving paedophiles
the sense of being connected to a commu-
nity of like-minded individuals. According
to O’Connell, “one of the most signific a n t
fa c t o rs influencing the gr owth of child por-
nography on the Internet is the ease of dis-
s e m i n ation and collection.A n o nymity and
c o nvenience have revealed an extraordi-
n a ry level of sexual interest in children. P r e-
s u m a b l y, this interest was either dorm a n t
or latent on this scale in the past.”As Mar-
tine Brousse,head of the French NGO Vo i x
de l’Enfa n t , puts it, “the person who might
not have gone through the process of bu y i n g

a particular magazine to nurture his fa n-
tasies can now just go on the Net, i t ’s not
d i f f i c u l t .” In newsgroups devoted to child
p o rn ,u s e rs typically recount claimed expe-
riences and fantasies to each other and
exchange pictures, sometimes by the hun-
dreds. O’Connell has found that they tend
to be a fairly cohesive and we l l - s t ru c t u r e d
c o m m u n i t y, and provide advice to each
other on how to avoid detection. M o n e y
rarely comes into the equation.
Legal loopholes
There is nothing illegal about exchan-
ging fa n t a s i e s.W h at is illegal in most coun-
t ri e s — but not in all—is the production and
d i s t ri bution of child porn o gr a p hy.This can
make it difficult for authorities to take action
at the source, where mat e rials are being
u p l o a d e d . Nor is the possession of child por-
n o gr a p hy a criminal offence eve ry w h e r e .T h e
d e finition of a child’s legal age va ries from
one country to another,and so does the defi-
nition of indecency. And while the majori t y
of users are based in developed countri e s ,
NGOs such as Casa Alianza and ECPAT
(End Child Prostitution,Child Po rn o gr a p hy
and Tr a f ficking of Children for Sexual Pur-
p o s e s ) , express concern that child sex tou-
rism is being promoted via Intern e t ,p u t t i n g
children at further risk of not only being abu-
sed but having their photographs taken and
transmitted online from countries where ru l e s
r e l ating to child porn o gr a p hy are lax or non-
e x i s t e n t .Faced with these loopholes,p o l i c e ,
N G O s , judicial authorities and law enforce-
ment are pressing for national legi s l ations to
be better harm o n i z e d .
Since the mid-1990s,police forces in a
number of countries have set up units spe-
cialized in tracking down online child por-
n o gr a p hy. In Bri t a i n , Scotland Ya r d ’s pae-
dophilia unit started to take the Net
s e riously when inve s t i g ations led to the sei-
zure of computer hard dri ves containing
child pornography images.The U.S. Fede-
ral Bureau of Inve s t i g ation (FBI) launched
an undercover operation dubbed I n n o c e n t
I m a ge s in 1994 to target people trading in
child porn or expressing an interest in tra-
velling inter-state with the intention of
h aving sex with minors. “ We pretty much
h ave this down to a fine tuned science,”
explains veteran FBI agent Peter Gulotta.
“ Ty p i c a l l y, most of our work invo l ves going
into chat rooms that we have reason to belie-
ve are invo l ved in child porn o gr a p hy.We
pose as adults willing to trade in child porn
or as a young boy or a young girl.In a very
s h o rt period of time, a predator will enga-
ge us in a conve rs ation about our sexual acti-
v i t y. Some will ve ry quickly express a willin-
gness to actually travel to meet us.”T h i s
technique has led, since 1995, to 357 arr e s t s ,
with a 99 per cent conviction rate.
Not all countries have the resources,
skills and legal right to intervene in this way.
An intern ational convention on cy b e rs p a-
ce crime is currently in the wo r k s , with a
p a rticular focus on procedural problems
such as collecting evidence in a crossborder
electronic env i r o n m e n t .“ I n t e rn e t , i n s o fa r
as crimes against children go, calls into ques-
tion the entire way in which police forces
wo r k ,” s ays Agnès Fo u rnier de Saint Maur,
chief of specialized crime at Interp o l .“ We
h ave to envisage legi s l at i ve changes that take
this into account, because without law s ,p o l i-
ce can do absolutely nothing.We also need
additional resources to equip police forces
with the right tools.” Jim Reynolds,former
chief inspector of Scotland Ya r d ’s paedo-
philia unit, r e grets that not all countries have
specialized units or identified points of
contact to whom intelligence on paedophiles
can be passed on.There are complaints of
r e p o rts being sent from one country to ano-
ther and not being acted upon for months.
W h at is far from clear is the relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween viewing child porn o gr a p hy and
sexually abusing a child, e ven though an
image is already the reflection of an abu s e .
“Child porn o gr a p hy is a far more seri o u s
issue that merely talking about photogr a p h s ,
it is the actual visual depiction of the sexual
assault of a child,” stresses Reynolds. “ T h e
c i r c u l ation of these photographs revictimizes
the child.”According to French psychiat ri s t
B e rnard Cordier, the Internet can reinfor-
ce a paedophile’s tendencies and increase the
risks of committing an offence should a par-
ticular set of circumstances allow it.W h at
c o n c e rns Gulotta is that most people arr e s-
ted have no prior records,but inve s t i g at i o n s ,
which include examining mat e rials on com-
puter software and disks,h ave on some occa-
sions revealed previous sexual encounters
with children.When pictures are seized, t h e
first pri o rity of law enforcement is to deter-
mine how recent they are in order to reach
children who might be at risk now. I n
conjunction with police forces in seve r a l
c o u n t ri e s , the COPINE project has constru c-
ted a database of seized child porn o gr a p h i c
videos and pictures traded via the Intern e t .
These images lend themselves to crime scene
a n a l y s i s ,p r oviding clues as to the picture’s
o ri gins and fa c i l i t ating co-operat i o n ,s i n c e
the same pictures may be reported to poli-
ce in different countri e s.
Partly in response to demand from the
police and the public, industry has started
to come forwa r d . “Pressure on them has
been extremely strong,” s ays Saint Maur.
“From the ve ry begi n n i n g, e ve ryo n e ,i n c l u-
ding the police, put the blame on them. B u t
just as you can’t blame the postal service for
shipping porn videos, i t ’s rather difficult to
really point the finger at Internet Serv i c e
P r ov i d e rs (ISPs, see glossary ) .N o n e t h e l e s s ,
this pressure has led ISPs to co-operate with
p o l i c e . For them, i t ’s out of the question that
they should do the policing.”The bottom
line is that without the technical expert i s e
of industry and its willingess to pass on
information to the police,the fight against
illegal content will be ineffective . Police raids
on ISPs in Germany have led to an uneasy
r e l ationship between industry and law
enforcement bodies. “Law enforcement in
and of itself is not a solution, it has to be
p a rt of a broader framework that includes
the taking of responsibility by the industry
i t s e l f,” s ays Jens Wa l t e rmann of the Ber-
telsmann Fo u n d at i o n , which designs and
s u p p o rts projects in a wide number of fie l d s.
At its Internet Content Summit being held
On October 20, 1996, more than 300,000 people
took part in a “white march” in Brussels (Belgium)
to demonstrate solidarity with the victims of
paedophiles.

against children go,

on September 9-11, the foundation will pre-
sent “practical recommendations for gove rn-
m e n t ,i n d u s t ry and users to work together
in developing a new culture of responsibi-
lity on the Internet.”These involve impro-
ving mechanisms to deal with harmful and
illegal content, namely hotlines as a feed-
back mechanism for users , vo l u n t a ry codes
of conduct among ISPs and software for
rating and filtering purposes.
Rising public awareness
For now, hotlines are the main mecha-
nism through which potentially illegal
content is report e d . Such hotlines exist in
less than ten countries and are funded by
g ove rn m e n t , i n d u s t ry, NGOs or a combi-
n at i o n . Links with law enforcement are not
a lways strong enough.The question of a pri-
vately funded line informing police about
activities regarding a third party can, in some
c o u n t ri e s ,be viewed as a breach of pri va cy.
Saint Maur and French cyberspace lawyer
Daniel Kahn both stress that governments
should be the ones setting up hotlines, w i t h
direct transmission of the information to a
c e n t r a l , specialized police unit.The Bri t i-
sh-based NGO ChildNet Intern ational is
heading an initiat i ve that aims to harm o n i-
ze and improve co-operation among hot-
lines while encouraging new ones. T h e
European Parliament is expected to adopt
a policy by the end of the year that wo u l d
encourage member states to set up specia-
lized round-the-clock units to liaise with
ISPs and law enforcement when alleged ille-
gal material is reported.
The fact that reports to all hotlines are
increasing points to rising public awa r e n e s s
of the issue.While industry is working on a
number of rating and fil t e ring initiat i ve s ,t h e s e
are not deemed sophisticated enough to deal
with child porn o gr a p hy. Aftab recently tes-
ted all the fil t e ring mat e rials on the market
and found that none blocked out the list of
illegal child porn o gr a p hy sites that she had
c o m p i l e d .Cyberangels now licences this list
out to fil t e ring software companies, but so
far only one, Net Nanny,has acquired it. B u t
fil t e ri n g, e ven if it wo r k s ,might protect chil-
dren online but certainly not those whose
images are being traded.
N G O s ,i n d u s t ry and police stress the role
of educat i o n ,both for parents and children,
in raising awareness and reporting illegal
m at e ri a l .Aftab believes that children under
13 should not be taking part in unmonito-
red chat rooms, which software can block

o u t . Awareness programmes also emphasi-
ze that schools should not be building we b
sites feat u ring pictures of children and divul-
ging personal inform ation about them. A s
head of the U. S .N ational Action Commitee
for the Innocence in Dange r i n i t i at i ve ,A f t a b
has eve ry intention of multiplying awa r e n e s s
i n i t i at i ve s , and already has giants like Micro-
soft and AOL on her side. Only a public
gr o u n d swell can prompt gove rnments to allo-
c ate more resources towards what is funda-
mentally a child protection issue.“Right now,
i t ’s possible to have a finger on the pulse,”
s ays O’Connell, cautioning against sensa-
tionalizing the problem. “If the threat
becomes too large, these individuals will go
f u rther undergr o u n d , to laye rs of the Inter-
net where you wo n ’t be able to find them.I t ’s
only a matter of time before that actually hap-
p e n s.” n
