Navajo paintings in sand
The sand paintings of the Navajo Indians
of the southwestern United States play an
important part in traditional healing
ceremonies. The paintings are executed
on the floor of the hogan, the Navajo
earth-covered wooden dwelling, by the
singer or hatááli. The singing of the
hatááli and the figures he draws attract
the Holy People. During the ceremony,
the patient sits on the sand painting.
The singer then takes sand from figures
in the painting and applies them to the
patient, to whom the healing and pro¬
tective power of the Holy People is
thereby transferred. After the ceremony,
the sand painting is erased.

faces are smoothed by hand, using a brew
of dung and urine, in itself creating a
subtle pattern. Organic materials are
used for both the paintsin the form of
indigenous pigmentsand the tools,
made from plants or feathers. Flat colours
or relief work, or a combination of the
two, are applied to the wall in a variety
of patterns and motifs.
The most common practice is to use
earth pigments painted onto a freshly
plastered surface, often layer upon layer.
This layering slows the drying process of
the paints, as well as cracking, thus cre¬
ating a smudged effect, an "indistinct¬
ness" between pattern and surface.
The lifespan of painted wallssub¬
ject to disintegrationis not intended
to be permanent. Rather, the walls are
recreated each year to celebrate or
announce new events and to permit
women to partake in a communal or social
activity.
