THE TRANSLATING MACHINE
helping to solve some of the language problems of science
ONE major obstacle to the inter-
nationality of science is the
diversity of languages, as a result
of which half or more of what is
published is useless to half or more of
thé world's scientists, technologists and
medical men.
The actual proportions so lost are very
difficult to estimate statistically, but a
rough idea, for science as a whole, can be
gained from the unshaded areas in the
diagram published with this article.
The proportion varies, however, from
one branch of science to another and
changes in the course of time. In
chemistry, for instance, German was the
leading language until shortly after the
First World War, when English took its
place. French at one time came second,
but after 1914 it ranked only fourth and
now Japanese competes with it for fifth
place. Nearly seventy years ago Russian
reached fifth place among forty lan¬
guages, but it is now competing with
German for second place.
All that part of scientific literature
which is represented by the < areas left
unblackened in the diagram is un-
exploitable, unless either, it is translated,
or the ability of scientists to read the
appropriate foreign languages is in-
by Edwin Holmstrom
creased above the level here assumed, or
scientific authors and publishers can be
persuaded to make use of languages more
widely understood than their own. Let
us briefly consider each of these alter¬
natives in turn.
Technical translating is slow, difficult
and uncertain. Since nobody can trans¬
late what he does not understand, it
follows that the translator must be
himself a scientist as well as acquainted
with the language he is translating from,
and competent as an author in the
language he is translating into. Especially
where the less common languages and
the more recondite specialities of science
are concerned these qualities are rarely
found in perfect combination.
But, from the consumer's point of view,
translating is necessarily expensive.
Where an original journal can be bought
for the equivalent of perhaps 50 U.S.
cents, a translation of a scientific article
in it, made by a specialist, will cost
perhaps $50. In other words it is not
worth paying to have done unless there
are grounds for supposing it will be worth
a hundred times as much to the scientist
who wants it as something on the same
topic in his own language. In some
countries, to spread the cost of trans¬
lating, bureaux exist in which manu¬
scripts of unpublished translations are
filed and from which copies are supplied
on payment.
The more technical a translation, the
less the part that the linguist as such
and the greater the part that the subject
specialist can play in making it a good
one. This being so, quite promising
experiments have been made in replacing
the linguist by electronic machines, built
on the lines of mathematical computers.
Such machines are able permanently
. to register sequences of code patterns of
electrical impulses corresponding to the
different letters of the alphabet, fed into
them by operating a typewriter keyboard. .
If two equivalent words in different
- languages have been so registered at the
same time, the "typing" of one of these
at any future time will cause the
machine automatically and instantane¬
ously to type out the other.
If that were all, we should have a
mechanical dictionary. It is possible,
however, to go considerably further. The
machine can be made to type, out code
letters which indicate how the words fed

interpreted at the top) in standard IBM puncned-card code. It is
then accepted by the 701, converted into its own binary language and _
translated by means of stored dicticrnary and operational syntactical
programs into the English language equivalent which is then printed.

THE JUAL1TY
CALORY CONTINT
CF COhL lb DETERMINED BY
FROM RUSSIAN INTO ENGLISH IN TEN SECONDS
On January 7 the International Business Machine Corporation,
producers of the world's largest electronic calculators, gave the
first public demonstration of a new type of translating machine
at work (Photo left). At the demonstration, held in New York,
the machine was given various sentences in Russian for translation
into English One of the sentences was: "Myezhdunarodnoye
ponyimanyiye yavlyayetsya vazhnim faktorom v ryeshyenyiyi polyi-
tyichyeskyix voprosov. " Ten seconds later the machine translated
in English "International understanding constitutes an important
factor in the decision of political questions. Above, the punch card
which translated "The quality of coal is determined by calory con¬
tent " from the Russian. Below left, card showing Russian sentence
"Obrabotka poyishayet kachyestvo Nyeftyi. ". Machine trans¬
lated this as "Processing improves the quality of crude oil."
The translating arrangement is mostly the work of Dr. Leon
Dostert, chairman of Georgetown University's Institute of. Lan¬
guages and Linguistics, and Dr. Cuthbert Hurd, Director of IBM's
Applied Science Division. Dr. Dostert, an American of French
origin first achieved prominence in the field of language translation
at the time of the Nuremberg trials. He was one of the experts
particularly responsible for setting up the simultaneous translation
system now currently used by international organizations. The
language-teaching methods used under his direction at the School
of Foreign Service of Georgetown University are among the most
modern to be found anywhere in the world. (Photos A. P.)

of publication for mo¬

ture, but as the dia¬
gram shows can be
read directly by less
than half the world's
scientists.
Current scientific literature is published mainly in six languages and is distrib¬
uted between them very roughly in proportion to the widths of these columns-

into it in the language of origin are
grammatically modified or inflected.- It
need not be limited to single words but
may be "taught to recognize" a whole
unit phrase in one language and type out
the corresponding, syntactically quite
different, phrase in the other language.
Though the machine cannot produce -
by itself an intelligible translation let
alone one in good literary style when a
text in one language is "fed" into it, it
types out a string of words, alternative
meanings of homonyms, symbolic letters
and odd looking phrases which a
specialist in the subject of the text will
have no difficulty in editing and turning
into an acceptable rendering, even
though he may know nothing at all of
the original language. .
Though it is more likely to be in hand¬
ling very out-of-the-way languages that
such machines might find a possible use,
the following example so rendered from
French into English may be of interest.
Here A is the original text.'B is what the
machine typed out, and C is what the
subject specialist, not knowing French,
turned it into, (v means "'vacuous" or
meaningless; m means multiple, plural or
dual; z means "unspecific"; the sign
/ denotes the point of separation of
semantic elements.)
A. Il n'est pas étonn/ant de constat/er
que les hormone/ s de croissance ag/is-
sent sur certain/es espèce/s, alors qu'elles
sont in/opér/antes sur d'autre/s, si l'on
song/e à la grand/e spécificité de ces
substance/s.
B. v not is not/step astonish v of estab¬
lish ^v_ that/which? _v hormone ni of
growth act m on certain m species m,
then that/which ? v not operate m on
of other m if v one~äream/consider z to
v great v specificity of those substance m.
C. It is not surprising to learn that
growth hormones may act on certain
species while having no effect on others,
when one remembers the narrow speci¬
ficity of these substances.
Clearly it is better, if possible, for a
scientist to be able to read foreign arti
cles himself than to have to depend on
translations. In the Scandinavian coun¬
tries, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
some others, almost everyone has had to
learn to do this, but even in these
countries few know Russian or Japanese,
and elsewhere ability to read English,
German or French is far from universal.
In theory at least, proposals to encou¬
rage the use of one particular language,
whether natural or artificial, as the
medium of scientific communication in
all countries have much to commend
them. Science, however, is a branch of
culture and it is natural for each coun¬
try to feel that an efflorescence of its
own culture may best be encouraged
through the use of its own language.
The problem is a difficult one and too
large to be discussejd here.
All these questions, and many others,
are being studied in the Report on Scien¬
tific and Technical Translating and
Related Problems which Unesco is pre¬
paring for publication in 1955, utilizing
the valuable comments, suggestions and
information which are now being receiv¬
ed from some 250 experts in 29 countries
to whom a draft of the Report was sent.
Its final chapter, "Terminology and dic¬
tionaries", deals with a problem to which
the Department of Natural Sciences has
for some years past been devoting much
attention, a problem whose importance
deserves to be stressed here.
It is ideas, not individual concepts,
that have to be translated, and it is the
phrase, not the individual word, that is
the unit of language. In point of fact it
very seldom happens that an expression
in one language has its exact equivalent
in another. Their central meanings may
or may not be the same, but nearly
always the penumbra of meaning is dif¬
ferent. In English usage "welding" is
differentiated from "soldering", whereas
the French word "soudage" covers both.
"Concrete" in English and "béton" in
French, both mean a mixture of large
and small stones and sand stuck together
with cement or "ciment". But in French
the word "ciment", is also commonly
used as a synonym for "béton".
These are rather superficial examples,
but others like them which may have
serious consequences, even financially
occur in every branch of technicality.
Ideally, to eliminate such misunderstand¬
ings, the translator should be so accus¬
tomed not only to reading but to himself
reasoning about the technical subject-
matter in both languages, that the nuan¬
ces of the special terms are second
nature to him. In very specialized fields,
and for the less common languages, that,
however, is a counsel of perfection.
This means that dictionaries, although
dangerous, are a necessity. To make
them safe it is essential that they should
indicate not only the nearest equivalents
of the technical terms, but just how
inexact the equivalences are, enabling
the translator to introduce some quali¬
fying word or turn of phrase to correct
the inexactitude of meaning that would
otherwise be conveyed.
The ultimate remedy is standardization
of the meanings of technical terms on
the basis of definitions agreed upon by
the specialists concerned in each lan¬
guage. Unesco is about to publish a clas¬
sified bibliography of existing authorita¬
tive glossaries of this kind in single lan¬
guages complementary to its Bibliogra¬
phy of Interlingual Scientific and Tech¬
nical Dictionaries, a .third edition of
which is now being printed. The latter
contains references to about 1,630 such
works under nearly 400 subject heads,
interconnecting 72 languages.
Standardization in the full sense men¬
tioned above must inevitably be a slow
process. Meanwhile the production of
more and better special dictionaries is a
matter of urgent international impor¬
tance. This being so, the policy which
Unesco is pursuing is that of helping and
encouraging the international organiza¬
tions concerned with each field of science
and technology to produce dictionaries
which shall contain a mixture, typogra¬
phically distinguished, of terms and defi¬
nitions which are fully standardized,
terms which are recommended by those
organizations, and terms including
regional variations which fall into
neither of these categories but are liable
to occur in the technical literature.
