SCULPTURE BY
THE BLIND
by Bertha Gaster
Seven years ago eleven people sat
down in a San Francisco art
class to do the impossible.
Plunging their hands into masses of
wet clay for the first time in their
lives, they set out to make sculptured
portrait busts of themselves. And
they were blind.
It was Jeanne Kewell, a young and
gifted art-teacher from the California
School of Fine Arts who first con¬
ceived of sculpture as a method of
helping the sightless to use their
hands and find a valuable emotional
outlet. Her original group of stu¬
dents, chosen from the San Francisco
Centre for the Blind with no regard
to talent or manual dexterity, caught
fire from her enthusiasm. They
learnt and carried out all the ne¬
cessary technical processes for them¬
selves, from the initial mixing of the
clay to the hollowing out of the mo¬
dels before firing. For nine months
they worked, patting, pressing, mould¬
ing the clay, and at the end of the
year the doors of the California
School of Fine Arts opened on an
exhibition of eleven completed clay
and terra cotta self-portraits made
by eleven sightless men and women.
Three of the eleven were blind from
birth; others went blind later.
Others again could still distinguish
light from darkness, but these latter
removed their glasses so that "all of
the students might be on a more
equal footing". There could be no
mirror for them, no gauging of dis-
16
tance and relationship with pencil or
thumb. They built their figures
slowly in wet clay, feeling their own
bone structure, shape of feature,
details of hair and expression, finger¬
ing the fold of flesh and curve of lips,
forcing out of the clay, it seems, not
only the likeness of their features but
also some visible expression of an
emotional attitude; for the astonished
public could not only clearly reco¬
gnize the extraordinary physical
resemblances, but also the suggestion
of profound feeling built into the
terra cotta and clay. What the artists
said about their own work is very
revealing. "I lived in a world of ideas
and sounds", said Leonid Malarevsky,
a former accountant who lost his sight
during the war, "and sculpture
brought me back to the world of di¬
mensions". Said Elsie Northern: "I
get at the open window in the morn¬
ing and look up and wish that I could
do something worth while". Even
more moving were the words of Louise
Bixler: "T wanted to portray the
sagging feeling in a person when they
can scarcely bear any more... I didn't
think of the head as just a chunk of
clay, but I thought here, under here,
is my heart... I was thinking of what
life had made of me."
After the West Coast exhibition the
busts were shown at the Brooklyn
Museum in New York, and later at a
private art gallery, arousing enorm¬
ous interest and a great deal of dis¬
cussion. Some critics pointed out the
high degree of manual dexterity and
tactile awareness in these works;
others related a certain monumental-
ity and austerity in the portraits to
the art of other periods, such as early
Egyptian art, when expressive quali¬
ties were counted of greater impor¬
tance than visual ones. Others again
claimed that memory played the
predominant role, and insisted that
strict representationalism had been
the aim, and Che lack of pictorial
detail was more a limitation of sight
than a deliberate choice of form.
Since that time the experiment has
expanded and the particular value
of sculpture for the blind become
more widely recognized.
In Amsterdam, for instance, at an
exhibition of the work of the English
sculptor Henry Moore in the Stedelijk
Museum, the director invited several
blind people to visit it and tell him
what they thought of the different
works. Patting, stroking, passing
their hands over the curves and
angles, over the forms of this sculptor,
their first reactions were much the
same as the sighted public. The
shapes did not feel like bodies and
heads, they thought. But some of
them, returning again and again,
liked them more and more. As one
of them said, "It is better when you
come to understand that Mr. Moore
isn't imitating life but telling you
about it. It is the same with music."
Jeanne Kewell, in the meantime,
had been extending her work to the

I LIKE TO RIDE ON THINGS... "...especially on
boy's shoulders... I like horses... I got six at horre," said
the author of this "Horse and Rider." Aged 1 I when he
modelled this work, he became blind at seven.

education of blind children. A class
of eighteen ranging roughly in age
from nine to thirteen, with one girl
of seventeen among them, was cho¬
sen, again without regard for artistic
leanings. "The sighted child", says
Jeanne Kewell, "learns through visual
exploration and initiation. The blind
child does not. Through sculpture"
she claims, "he can come to know the
intimacy of objects, formulations,
concepts, and ideas". The eighteen
children, therefore, were given the
clay to play with and handle, chose
their subjects and began to model,
no one child working for more than
a total of thirty-two hours over a
four-month period.
What subjects did they choose ?
The little girl whose family group had
been separated through illness and
death modelled families the dog
family, the bird family, in smooth
rounded shapes. Others chose single
animals, birds, cats, dogs, horses all,
be it observed, domestic animals they
may once have seen. The child
with no visual memory, blind from
birth, made a rough unrecognizable
heap representing a bird, in a nest
curiously suggestive of the walls of a
room; children who had been studying
King Arthur in English class modelled
knights in the clay. «They were hor¬
rible men, I think", said one, "you
can hear the blood".
Extraordinarily powerful in its
sense of opposing forces is the horse
and rider modelled by an eleven-year-
old boy, blind since seven. "I like to
ride on things" he said, adding "I
like horses especially". Unbearably
poignant is "The Solitary child"
three figures at the playground
bench, two together at one end, one
small immobile form seated alone at
the other. The blind nine-year-old
who made it gave a name to the child
sitting spart. It was his own. And
there are the two solid featureless
figures modelled by a thirteen-year-
old girl. Her brief explanation of them
may well stand for all these children
struggling in blackness "She says
take me out of the dark, dark dun¬
geon. He is signalling to go".
Whether the theories of aesthetic
values propounded by some of the cri¬
tics are valid, time alone will tell.
But of the healing and releasing pro¬
perties of this form of activity for the
blind, in this new method of expres¬
sion and appreciation, there can be
little doubt. The faceless
figure with bound hands
cries "Take me out of the
dark, dark, dungeon"
Jeanne Kewell has opened
a door.

SCULPTURE BY THE BLIND (Continued)
Blind youngsters often choose as subjects for their sculpture the domestic
animals which are familiar companions and which they may have seen
sometime in the past. Two animal forms (above) were made by a boy
aged I I who had been blind for four years. Below, cat studies. Left,

THREE-LEGGED RACE was depicted In clay by a
totally blind I 2-years-old girl who had run in this race
at school Field Day. About this event another child
said: "Do you know how blind people run ? There Is a
big old wire at the end of the rope. You take hold ofthat
. rope and start running real fast, and he counts the sec¬
onds; once I did it In nine point eight on the 50 yard dash."
