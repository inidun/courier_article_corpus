Movie-makers in English-speaking Africa who cannot afford
to produce classic celluloid films are winning popular acclaim
with low-cost video productions

In the Third World and among urban
ghetto dwe l l e rs in advanced countri e s ,
some technological inventions are used
in ways that were never imagined or
intended by their ori gi n at o rs. They open
up new areas of endeavour that can be
independently pursued by the
underprivileged.To take one example,the
availability of low-cost samplers and four-
track sound recording equipment has
t riggered a formidable explosion of ghetto-
based rap music in the United States by
making it possible for relat i ve l y
u n s o p h i s t i c ated young people with ve ry
little money to record high-quality music
tracks in their own homes.
In the same ve i n , the emergence and
p r o l i f e r ation of inexpensive VHS video tape
r e c o r d e rs have led to the gr owth of video-
based movie production in several A f ri c a n
c o u n t ri e s , especially Nigeria and Ghana.To
u n d e rstand the importance of this
p h e n o m e n o n , it must be borne in mind that
film production in most A f rican countri e s
o ri gi n ated pri m a rily as a result of extern a l
a s s i s t a n c e , r ather than truly indigenous
e f f o rt s. It was essentially because of the
availability of technical and fin a n c i a l
assistance from the French Co-operat i o n
M i n i s t ry that countries of francophone
A f rica such as Senegal and Burkina Fa s o
made considerable progress in fil m
p r o d u c t i o n .
Prohibitive
production costs
In the English-speaking countri e s ,on the
other hand,where assistance of this kind wa s
not readily ava i l a b l e , film production
generally lagged behind in the absence of
meaningful cultural policies designed to
s u p p o rt indigenous fil m - m a k e rs. N o n -
subsidized film production was possible for
a time in the 1970s and 1980s because the
e c o n o my was bu oyant enough to recoup the
high costs of using rented equipment from
ove rseas and paying for processing and
p rinting in European laborat o ri e s.
In the late 1980s, the local economy
v i rtually collapsed, robbing the middle
classes and the population at large of the
means to pay consistently for leisure
e n t e rt a i n m e n t .The cost of film production
became prohibitive .E ven a low - budget fil m
costing only $50,000 could not pay for itself
on the local market. As a result no one
ventured into film production. Hence the
drought of Nigerian-made fil m s , a
seemingly incomprehensible paradox in
view of the growing number of films made
in relat i vely small and economically less
well endowed countries of francophone
Africa.
Another major obstacle to fil m
production in most African countries has
been that there are no true television

s t at i o n s. In most cases, A f rican television
s t ations are shells which serve as relay posts
for films produced elsewhere. They have
little or no production capability, and have
no funds with which to purchase or co-
produce feature films or television series.
Story-telling
with panache
H owe ve r , the proliferation of V H S
video tape recorders in pri vate homes in
c o u n t ries like Nigeria and Ghana has
c r e ated a radically new situation which has
led to the emergence of a legion of
independent indigenous movie directors
and television producers. They have
emerged because of their ability to solve
t wo key problems: firs t , p e g ging mov i e
production costs at a level that can be easily
r e c overed on the local market, and second,
c r e ating distri bution mechanisms that
bypass the lack of indigenous television
s t ations and the limitations of a feeble
network of cinema houses.
Most of these productions are low -
budget films which are shot principally in
U - m atic or even VHS form at , although a few
are shot on Betacam or on the new
g e n e r ation of consumer-level digi t a l
c a m e r a s.The technical quality is often below
p a r , because most of the production staff,
especially the directors of photogr a p hy,
generally lack formal training. H owe ve r ,
w h at these productions lack in technical
quality and finesse they make up for in
astonishingly colourful story-telling and
popular appeal.As a result of successful mass
marketing techniques reminiscent of the
early days of Hollywo o d , N i g e ria has been
i n u n d ated with these productions.
According to the Nigerian Film Censors h i p
B o a r d , no fewer than 858 full-length video
films were released between December 1994
and May 1998.
Because this production is entirely
m a r k e t - d ri ve n , the films are closer to the
tastes of A f rican audiences than the va s t
m a j o rity of foreign-assisted films made in
francophone A f rican countri e s.The reasons
for this are clear: Who pays the piper calls

the tune.
The content and style of foreign-assisted
films are often dictated by We s t e rn mov i e
c ritics or civil servants in the French Co-
o p e r ation Ministry.The success of the fil m s
depends on the reception they receive in
f e s t i vals and art house circuits in Europe,
r ather than on their popularity with A f ri c a n
a u d i e n c e s.The contents and style of video
m ov i e s , on the other hand, are necessari l y
dependent on mass audience tastes in A f ri c a
and are totally unsuitable for film festiva l s
and art house audiences. H o p e f u l l y,
h owe ve r , there will be a meeting point some
d ay between the need for quality and depth
and the quest for mass market appeal.
With the gr owing development of
d i gital television technology and the
concomitant fall in costs, it will soon be
possible for A f rican video products to be
remastered on 16 mm or 35 mm without
gr e at loss of quality and so become
available for cinema distribution. Meanwhile,
the availability of video projectors is begi n n i n g
to make possible a new type of distribution in
relatively small viewing centres.These movies
are also remarkably popular with Nigeri a n s
and Ghanaians in Europe and the United
S t at e s , suggesting that in the not-too-distant
future a market might emerge for distribution
by cable or satellite to these expat ri at e
communities.
There can be no doubt that video mov i e
production in countries like Nigeria and
Ghana represents an A f rican response 
to today ’s inform ation jungle. It is the response
of people who have chosen to car ve out their
own path,rather than wait for the ambiguous
b e n e fits of travelling along glistening
information highways in a manner scripted by
the powerful forces that currently dominat e
the world political and economic scene. n
