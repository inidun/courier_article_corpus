J
ames To is convinced his telephones are
t a p p e d . A policeman tipped him off but To
feels neither paranoid nor outraged, s i m p l y
r e s i g n e d .For the past ten years,he has relent-
lessly monitored the surveillance tactics of
Hong Ko n g ’s
rulers—British and Chinese—and phone-
tapping has been on top of his list.
“My interest is very simple:it’s about Big Bro-
t h e r. The government should have the minimum
amount of information about citizens,” says the
Democrat Party legislator.“I don’t want the govern-
ment to be my friend.It should leave us alone and
then we will have the potential to develop our-
selves into what we want to be.”
To ’s strong views were forged by experience. H e
was first elected at the age of 28 in 1990—a pivotal
moment in Hong Ko n g ’s history when British admi-
nistrators sought to reassure a population panicked
by the 1989 violence at Tiananmen Square and the
return to Chinese rule in 1997.The colonial powers
sought to calm public fears by introducing a Bill of
Rights to locally enshrine the International Cove-
nant on Civil and Political Rights.
After examining the much-touted law, t h e
young To found little in the way of privacy pro-
t e c t i o n , which was not surprising. “Even in the
mother country, Britain,there is no Bill of Rights
or mechanism to ensure privacy,” says To, aside
from jurisprudence. I r o n i c a l l y, it was a British lec-
t u r e r, Raymond Wa c k s, who first introduced him to
the concept as a law student at the University of
Hong Kong in the 1980s. Since then, a c a d e m i c
curiosity has become a personal commitment.
The colonial authorities paid little heed to To’s
warnings. But they could not ignore the European
U n i o n ’s threats in 1994 to prohibit its member
countries’ banks from dealing with their counter-
parts in Hong Kong without legal data protection.
A year later, the legislature passed the Personal
Data Ordinance.Once again,To uncovered a major
loophole:the law did not apply to the Telecommu-
nications Ordinance that gave the government
extensive wiretapping powers. He introduced his
own bill requiring a judge to oversee the process,b u t
the British authorities rejected it.
Today his battle against phone-tapping covers
wider ground. New laws permit the police to create
an extensive DNA database by collecting samples
from anyone suspected or convicted of a serious
crime. Immigration officials are also spearheading
efforts to install a national system of “ s m a r t ”c a r d s,
embedded with microchips, to replace the paper
identity cards. Residents must now carry these paper
documents at all times and apply for identification
numbers for the most banal tasks, like getting a
phone line installed, visiting a residential building
after hours or even booking a tennis court.
The omnipresent
“smart” card
The smart cards are supposed to offer more
efficient services, but privacy advocates fear they
could do far more. By centralizing the most personal
and minute details—from the title of a book bor-
rowed from a library to medical data—any “card-
r e a d i n g ” authority could use these profiles to exert
leverage over the individual by, for example, p a s s i n g
sensitive information to an employer.
Yet as To pushes for legal protection, his fellow
citizens seem uninterested. The entrenched habit of
carrying identification papers, he says, has made sur-
veillance seem normal in Hong Ko n g. People are
willing to tolerate intrusion so long as it doesn’t
hinder their attempts to make money, according to the
l e g i s l a t o r.And if the situation becomes diffic u l t ,t h e y
are prepared to emigrate overseas.“ P r i v a cy is viewed
as a luxury,” he says.“ I t ’s not part of Chinese culture,”
which privileges the collective over the rights of the
i n d i v i d u a l . But for To, the opposite is true: the well-
being of the group depends on the security of each
and every one of its members. ■
