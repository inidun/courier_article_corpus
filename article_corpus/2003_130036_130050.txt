The 
language 
barrier

Dramatic inroads can be made 
on illiteracy by offering bilingual support 
to minority language children


Secondary pupils at North 
Westminster community 
school in inner London face a barrier to learning 
literacy that is familiar to hundreds of millions of 
minority children the world over – the language they 
are learning to read in is not their mother tongue.
“Seventy percent of our intake speak English as an 
additional language (EAL), and 60 percent of these 
are at the very early stages of English acquisition,” 
said literacy coordinator Frank Monaghan. 
This means that they do not have enough English 
to follow lessons and must be helped by a bilingual 
classroom assistant.
Research has found that pupils learn more 
English if they attend normal classes with special 
EAL assistants – of which there is a severe shortage 
– rather than removing them for special language 
lessons as was common in the 1980s.
Even now some of North Westminster’s 2,000 
pupils – often new arrivals from troubled regions 
such as Iraq, Afghanistan Somalia and the Balkans 
– need special support outside the classroom. Large 
numbers arrive at secondary school illiterate even 
in their mother tongue and another 12-15 percent

teacher’s assistants 
help children who 
don’t have enough 
English to follow 
lessons.

rehearsals at the

have suffered a disrupted education that puts them 
many years behind what they would normally be 
achieving even in their own countries.
“Withdrawal” for non-English speakers “was 
a slippery slope,” said Dr Monaghan. Pupils lost 
the vital link with their peer communities and 
many, particularly the younger ones, began to lose 
their own language while not properly mastering 
the new one, sending them into a spiral of 
underachievement.
But with 40 languages spoken at the school, 
some of them by only one or two pupils, bilingual 
assistants are only a partial solution. Instead 
North Westminster makes as much use as it can 
of “partnership teaching” where a mainstream 
subject teacher and a qualified teacher specializing 
in English as an additional language jointly plan 
and deliver lessons. Partnership teaching, pioneered 
in London 15 years ago is being copied in other 
countries with diverse minority groups with some 
success.
An estimated 476 million of the world’s illiterates 
are speakers of minority languages – many of them 
with no written form – in countries where schooling 
takes place in another (often colonial) language.
However, in many such countries bilingual 
programmes with initial teaching in the mother 
tongue have helped children become literate in both 
languages. 
Research has shown that learners can generalize 
the skill of reading and writing in the mother tongue 
to any other language the learner speaks.
In one project run by Save the Children in 
Mali, children start to acquire skills in their own 
language (Dogoso) and switch to French after a 
year or two. “Quite a few children who attend these 
schools are doing much better than children who 
attend ordinary state schools where French is the 
medium of instruction from the outset,” says Marie-
Madeleine Savitzky of the London Language and 
Literacy Unit at South Bank University.
In Peruvian Amazonia, where illiteracy was 
once the norm, 15,000 pupils speaking 28 different 
indigenous languages have benefited from the 
region’s 600 bilingual schools. Pupils whose mother-
tongue is an indigenous language and who attended 
bilingual programmes, all finished with a mastery 
of Spanish beyond that of mother-tongue speakers 
of a similar ability and social background who 
had attended a school where Spanish was the only 
medium of instruction, a 1987 study found.
Bilingual programmes particularly make sense 
in countries where speakers of diverse indigenous 
languages far outnumber speakers of the majority 
language. 
But raising literacy skills worldwide means 
tackling the problems of minority language groups 
wherever they occur.
