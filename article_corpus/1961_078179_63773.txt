Obstacle Course To Leadership
SIX MEN WITH A PROBLEM
All the young nations of Africa are today on the lookout for suitable candidates
to fill key administrative jobs. In Ghana, the Institute for Education at the Uni¬
versity of Accra has drawn up a series of group tests to assess the leadership
qualities of students and persons from private and official bodies. Photos show
six candidates undergoing two of these tests. Each test poses a problem which
can only be solved by collective action, careful thought and preparation. To
find the right solution and carry it out demands intelligence, initiative, clear¬
sightedness and organizing ability as well as energyand physical skill. It is left to
one man to assert leadership over others. A jury notes individual performances.
PROBLEM
Leadership problem posed to six
young Africans is shown in diagram
(above). Men must cross from A
to B over an imaginary precipice C
taking with them a heavy iron pipe
and a large metal drum. They are
allowed to use three tyres as sup¬
ports hanging over the "preci¬
pice." The men put their heads
together and one of them, Amissah,
comes up with an idea for the solu¬
tion which he explains to the others.

FIRST TRY
Amissah's idea is to use a rope to
pull two tyres to point A, then use
these to "launch" one man to the
third tyre and thus to point B.
But the attempt fails (photo left)
for this was not the correct solution,
and the man who tried to get across
could easily have fallen into the
"precipice." Amissah has shown
rashness in risking the lives of the
others, and the jury notes down:
"Not enough sense of responsiblity."

SUCCESS
Another member of the group,
Dunyoh, comes forward with a
new idea: "If we push the pipe
through the tyres it will act as a
bridge along which we can take the
drum. When we have all crossed
to the other side, all we need do is
pull the pipe after us and the
problem is solved." Above and
below, Dunyoh's idea workedhe
scores highly for the initiative and
organizing ability he has displayed.

SIX MEN WITH A PROBLEM
(NUMBER 2)
A NEW TEST, far more difficult than the first, now
faces the six candidates. This time the iron pipe has
to be transported from one high wooden barrier to
another over an imaginary precipice. The team is
given a rope with indications as to the limits of what
they can do with it. Unlike in the first test, there
are no helpful supports hanging over the "precipice".

FIRST TRY
Everyone agrees that the rope,
tied with a running knot, must be
thrown over and hooked to the
post on the far side and this is
eventually done. Three men then
try to snake their way over the
rope, but one falls into the "preci¬
pice" and is eliminated from the test.

SECOND TRY
One of the men now comes up with
a new idea. Stretching himself
full-length along the rope, he takes
the iron pipe on his shoulder for
support and slowly inches across.
This feat calls for considerable skill,
determination and physical stamina.

VICTORY
This is the only correct approach to
the problem. In the final scene we
see the pipe and the last men
successfully reaching the far bar¬
rier. The pipe, it should be noted,
is heavy and awkward to handle.
