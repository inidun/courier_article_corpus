The current International Year of Vol-
unteers has one overarching aim: to bring
about widespread recognition of the mil-
lions of people around the globe who,
through voluntary acts, play a signific a n t
role in fostering social cohesion within com-
m u n i t i e s.They are bringing light into a trou-
bled world.The problem is that this light has
been hidden under a bushel for far too long.
Governments are encouraged to endorse
pro-volunteer policies and see volunteerism
for what it is worth—an important chunk of
what we now refer to as “social capital.”
There are strong arguments for taking
a closer look at the impact of volunteer
w o r k . In recent decades, we have witnessed
how war and civil strife in scores of coun-
tries have driven families from their homes.
Displaced people and refugees have lost
their bearings and must start anew with
neighbours who may or may not share their
cultural tradition and values. Vo l u n t a r y
efforts by the victims of confli c t , often sup-
ported by volunteers outside the affected
c o m m u n i t i e s, are a critical factor in helping
to reinvent social cohesion in new settle-
ments. Conflict is not the only cause for a
breakdown in social cohesion. M i g r a n t
groups flooding urban areas in many
developing countries have a similar effect.
In every case, we need to tap into the vol-
unteer potential and extend our effective-
ness in fostering social cohesion.
Over the years, we have shifted from
seeing volunteerism uniquely as a one-way,
North-South street.We are learning to com-
bine the strengths of domestic and interna-
tional volunteers of all nationalities, s h a r i n g
skills for the betterment of communities.
Volunteers work in service functions within
o r g a n i z a t i o n s,but also informally and spon-
t a n e o u s l y. For far too long, we have
neglected the contributions of mutual aid
groups looking out for the interests of neigh-
b o u r s. Their efforts are recorded in invis-
ible ink. Through survey research at the
national level, we can gain a better appreci-
ation of their achievements and suggest how
g o v e r n m e n t s, the UN system and other
external actors can promote a positive envi-
ronment for volunteerism to flourish at the
local level.
Another broadening avenue is corporate
v o l u n t e e r i n g. Employees are given time off
to volunteer in their communities,or to take
off a few weeks to assist people in another
part of the world and, at the same time,
broaden their own experience. Although it
is starting to pick up speed, the private sector
can take corporate volunteering much fur-
ther. It is more than good PR—it builds a
s t r o n g e r, more enlightened and cohesive
work force. We are also encouraged to see
the new waves of volunteers—working from
home or office computers—who donate time
to organizations worldwide through the
U N V-powered online volunteer service
( h t t p : / / a p p. n e t a i d . o r g / OV ) . These gifted
h o m e m a k e r s, s t u d e n t s, professors and
employees make the most of their time, for
the benefit of others.
A word of caution: as volunteers of
good will, we must counter negative
impulses in our societies and shed light on
the activities of racists and extremists,w h o,
in the name of cohesion,wage violent hate
campaigns.
Now is our time to build networks globally
to facilitate and promote volunteer action.Th i s
is what IYV 2001 is all about, and close to
15,000 individual volunteers and organizations
have already registered their support for this
o c c a s i o n .We are talking about an expanding
c o n s t i t u e n cy of volunteers. They want to be
h e a r d ,to be understood for what they accom-
p l i s h ,and taken seriously for the tremendous
contributions they make to society. ■
