Education for all: schools reach out
A Copernican

Ten ye a rs ago, the World Conference on
Education for All held in Jomtien (Thailand)
pledged to guarantee five years of primary
education for every child in the world and to
halve the adult illiteracy rate by the year 2000.
These were ambitious objectives.
The World Education Forum to be held at
Dakar in April will take stock of what has been
done to achieve these goals during the last 10
years. In absolute terms the number of children
not enrolled in primary schools and the number
of adult illiterates have slightly declined. Because
of demographic growth, the decline is more pro-
nounced expressed in relative terms.
But figures are only part of the balance-sheet.
The Jomtien Conference maintained that educa-
tion is not only a right but also the key to all deve-
l o p m e n t .This conviction is now unive rsally accep-
t e d , and so is the urgent need for schools to reach
o u t , especially to all those still excluded by tradi-
tional forms of educat i o n . New part n e rs (commu-
n i t i e s , N G O s , local civil and religious authori t i e s
and the pri vate sector) are proving to be inva-
l u a b l e . A b ove all, o b j e c t i ve analysis of the state of
basic education which emerges from the country
r e p o rts prepared for the Dakar Fo rum will allow a
ve ry precise diagnosis of the situation to be made
for the first time.
A radical change of course
Pa r a d ox i c a l l y, the failures that have been
recorded during this decade of action have taught
a key lesson:more of the same will not be enough;
different approaches will have to be adopted.
Unless there is a radical change of course, educa-
tion for all will remain a vain objective both in
quantitative and qualitative terms. Basic educa-
tion will only become accessible and relevant for
all if there is a “Copernican revolution”in schools
and schooling.
It is a truism that the capital on which every
society draws to shape its future consists of the
knowledge at its disposal and its capacity to
extend and transmit that knowledge. In the age of
the Internet and globalization, however, it is
important to emphasize the growing contradic-
tion between the new demands made by “know-
ledge societies” and the immobility of the major
systems whereby knowledge is acquired.
These systems are chiefly based on a single per-
iod of time (whereas education should be a lifelong
process) a fixed place (one to which many poten-
tial learn e rs lack access), a specific group of actors
(thereby neglecting the contri bution that other seg-
ments of society can make), u n i f o rm content (whe-
reas education should affirm cultural dive rs i t y ) ,
and a single source of funding (whereas public
spending on education is not keeping pace with the
inevitable increase in the cost of basic educat i o n
and lifelong education for all). These stru c t u r e s ,
p r o grammes and methods are increasingly being
ove rtaken by the radical developments that are
c h a n ging the face of all societies.
The contours of the revolution we shall be
required to carry out are starting to take shape.T h e
purpose of education can no longer be reduced to
the transmission of learning or the mastery of job-
related skills.We must not forget that “Education”
literally means “ d r awing out”, enabling learn e rs to
a c h i e ve their full potential. To lose sight of this
a p p r o a c h , to stress the “ a l l ” in “ e d u c ation for all” t o
the detriment of “ e d u c at i o n ” would lead to the
gr owth of a new kind of illiteracy and an increase in
the disparities and inequalities against which edu-
cation should be the most powerful weapon. ■
