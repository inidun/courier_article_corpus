The aging world
Facts and figures
The number of people aged 60 and over
is the fastest growing section of the popula¬
tion in the world.
While total world population is expected
to treble in the 75 years from 1950 to 2025,
the United Nations predicts that the
population of the over-60s will show a five¬
fold increase and the over-80s will increase
to seven times their present number.
This means that one person in every seven will be over 60
years of age in 2025 compared with just one in every 12 in
1950.
In 1950 there were only an estimated 214 million people
over the age of 60 in the world. By 2025 that number is ex¬
pected to reach 1,121 million.
The aging of populations will be most dramatic in the
developing world where the over-60s are expected to in¬
crease nearly seven times between 1950 and 2025, when they
will number 800 million.
In 1950 the developing world held only 56 per cent of the
over-60s. By 2025, 72 per cent of the over-60s will live there.
The number of over-60s in the developing world will in¬
crease fastest between 2000 and 2025, when countries like
Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria will see their
over-60s increase by nearly 15 times.
HEALTH
The large number of old people in 2025 will be the sur¬
vivors of the population aged between 15 and 35 today.
They will owe their survival largely to improvements in
health, hygiene and nutrition. The World Health Organiza¬
tion (WHO) has estimated that two-thirds of the rise in life
expectancy is due to such improvements.
The natural process of aging need not be disabling.
Healthy people can remain active and vigorous until they
die. Modern research has shown that it is the cumulative ef¬
fects of actual disease that cause older people to become
disabled.
In more developed regions the WHO has estimated that
75 per cent of over-60s are active and able to care for
themselves. Less than five per cent are severely disabled by
irreversible brain atrophy.
But the proportion of disabled old is likely to be much
larger in the developing world where many people have suf¬
fered a lifetime of poor nutrition and disease. One study of
over-60s in Costa Rica revealed that 85 per cent had dif¬
ficulties with their vision and 66 per cent suffered from
arthritis.
Throughout the world most disabled old people are cared
for at home. Even in more developed regions, estimates
reveal that fewer than five per cent of the over-60s are
receiving institutional care.
WOMEN
In almost every country women live longer than men.
Most researchers believe this is because of genetic
differences.
Because they live longer, older women outnumber older
men. The difference is especially pronounced in more
developed regions where women in their 60s outnumbered
men in their 60s by 100 to 74 in 1975. The ratio becomes
even more uneven in older age groupswith only 48 men
for every 100 women over 80.
In developing countries the number of men and women
in their 60s is almost equal. But, as development advances,
the gap in life expectancy will widen and women over 60 will
become a majority.
URBANIZATION
Migration of younger family members to urban areas in
search of employment leaves older people in the
countryside.
In the expanding cities a higher standard of living will of¬
fer the young job-seekers a longer life so that, by 2025, the
UN predicts that the majority of aging people in the
developing world will be living in urban areas.
In more developed regions this process of urbanization
has already occurred and the majority of people now live in
cities. In 1975 two-thirds of the over-60s lived in cities. By
2000 this number is expected to increase by 60 per cent until
over three-quarters of the developed world's aged are living
in cities.
EMPLOYMENT
The International Labour Office (ILO) estimates that
only 39 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women over 65
were in employment in 1975. This level of employment is ex¬
pected to drop so that, by 2000, only 27 per cent of men and
ten per cent of women over 65 will be in employment. (Here
"employment" excludes those tasks involved in housework
and growing food for domestic consumption.)
PENSIONS
Most industrialized countries have a fixed retirement age
at which people in formal employment stop work and
receive a pension from the government. Retirement age
typically ranges from 60 to 65 years for men and 55 to 60
years for women.
For these retired people, the main problem is the size of
pension they receive. ILO economists recommend that the
state pension should be equivalent to at least 65 per cent of
a person's earnings. Even in more developed regions few
countries provide the recommended minimum pension.
Nearly all developing countries also have some kind of
government pension scheme. But coverage is usually limited
to the relatively few people in formal wage employment.
The ILO estimates that only 23 per cent of working men
and 6 per cent of working women will be receiving a pension
by the year 2000.
DEPENDENCE
People are growing old faster than children are being
born to support them in their old age. In 1950 there were 19
people over 60 and 45 children under the age of 15 for every
100 adults aged 15-59. By 2025 there are expected to be 40
over-60s and only 35 children for every 100 active adults.
The ILO predicts that there will be 270 million
"economically inactive" over 55-year olds in industrialized
countries by 2020. That will mean 38 older dependents for
every 100 workers twice as many as in 1950.
In Austria there is already one pensioner for every two
workers.
The "dependency ratio" in East Asia is expected to dou¬
ble by 2025, when China will have one person over 60 for
every three active adults.
