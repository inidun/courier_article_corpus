In both rich and poor countri e s —
especially the latter—people are flo c k i n g
from rural areas to the cities.The United
N ations Development Programme (UN D P)
s ays the population of the wo r l d ’s cities will
nearly double between 1990 and 2025, ri s i n g
from 2.4 billion to 5.5 billion.
Urban gardens, long neglected and eve n
disdained because they were carelessly
cultivated or insalubrious, are becoming a
source of food and income for newcomers
from the countryside.The UNDP sees them
as a resource that should be exploited. I t
began looking into urban agriculture in 1991
and presented a report on it to the United
N ations Conference on Human Settlements
(Habitat II) in 1996.
The UN D P uses the term “ a gri c u l t u r e ”i n
a broad sense—it ranges from raising animals
to recycling wa s t e , while the term “ u r b a n ”i s
used to cover “the area of a city’s sphere of
s o c i a l ,e c o l o gical and economic influ e n c e ” .
It describes urban agriculture as “ a n
i n d u s t ry that produces, processes and
markets food and fuel, largely in response to
the daily demand of consumers within a
town,city or metropolis,on land and water
dispersed throughout the urban and peri-
urban area, applying intensive production
m e t h o d s , using and re-using nat u r a l
resources and urban wa s t e s , to yield a
diversity of crops and livestock.”
Green-fingered
urban gardeners
C i t y - d we l l e rs eve rywhere display enorm o u s
ingenuity when it comes to growing things.
They make use of small gardens (apart from
f o rmal allotments), gaps between bu i l d i n g s ,
waste gr o u n d , r o a d s i d e s , r a i lway
e m b a n k m e n t s ,t e rr a c e s , balconies and eve n
s t a i r we l l s. On spaces just a few metres
s q u a r e , you can find vegetable plots,
hydroponic crops (grown with nutrients in
sand or water but without soil), fruit trees,
fis h t a n k s , flowe rs and small animals such
as rabbits, h a m s t e rs and poultry in cages
hanging on walls.
These urban “ fa rm e rs ” are mostly
wo m e n , who produce vegetables and animals
for their own consumption and to make a
little pocket money. For example, a young
mother in Nairobi noticed at the roadside
near her house a spot where for ye a rs people
had dumped and bu rned garbage. S h e
realized how fertile it would be and planted
beans and maize there. Since then, she has
been able to feed her fa m i l y, d rying the
beans to eat during the off-season and
selling roasted corn cobs to passers - b y.
Another woman gr ows manioc and spinach
near a leaky pipe.Access to water is a seri o u s
p r o b l e m — i t ’s either too far away or too
expensive.
You don’t have to own land to gr ow
ve g e t a b l e s. A nything will do—boxe s ,
g u t t e ri n g, old tyres, plastic bags. In Mexico
C i t y, people gr ow potatoes in discarded
t ruck tyres. In the Chilean capital, S a n t i a g o,
the Centre for Education and Technology
has a model 20 m 2 urban garden to show
h ow things can be done. To save space,
c o n t a i n e rs are stacked up in a pyramid
shaded from the sun by a vine. C u c u m b e rs ,

marrows and melons grow vertically along
the walls.
In Po rt - a u - P ri n c e , H a i t i , an A m e ri c a n
food aid organization is encouraging people
to gr ow crops on the flat roofs of houses.To
make sure that the garden isn’t too heavy for
the roof to support , it advises using not eart h ,
but a 5- to 10-cm thick layer of either compost
made from garbage,or else cut gr a s s ,b a g a s s e
(sugar-cane wa s t e ) , rice husks or maize leave s.
In St. Pe t e rs bu r g, in Russia, people use sacks
of peat to gr ow things in, with the sack serv i n g
as a container. Analyses made in New Yo r k
s h ow that such intensive l y - gr own crops
contain a tenth the amount of pollution found
in fie l d - gr own crops.
But if not practised properly, u r b a n
a griculture can cause pollution and disease.
Fe rtilizing plants with untreated sewa g e ,
for example,can cause cholera epidemics.
Lead and cadmium from petrol gets
c o n c e n t r ated in leaf ve g e t a b l e s. To avo i d
these ri s k s , communities must be educat e d
about them,urban agriculture included in
local gove rnment policy and health
regulations enforced. Community groups
must also be encouraged so as to boost the
gr owth of a food source which has become
vital in overcrowded cities. n
