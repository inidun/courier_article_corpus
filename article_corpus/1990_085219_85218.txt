I N the Landes département of south¬
western France, a group of school¬
children visit a rock shelter used by
hunter-gatherers of the Old Stone
Age. The shelter is located on a cone-
shaped mass of debris overlooking a
river at a ford. From this vantage
point early man kept watch as the
animals crossed at different seasons.
The skeleton of a dismembered rein¬
deer unearthed on the site is a tan¬
gible piece of evidence which can
help the children to imagine how the
hunter-gatherers lived in those re¬
mote times.
In the neighbouring départe¬
ment of Lot-et-Garonne, the children
visit Stone Age rock shelters located
at the riverside, suggesting that fish¬
ing was practised there. Nearby
megaliths and objects preserved in
local museums help teachers explain
how man the predator became a
stock-raiser, then abandoned a no¬
madic life and turned to agriculture,
how his growing mastery of fire ena¬
bled him to improve the quality of the
earthenware he made and to develop
metalwork techniques, first with
bronze and then iron.
By on-the-spot study of these
and other sites the children can form
a picture of the changing human im¬
pact on the landscape, as well as
changes in activities and habitat
which took place down the ages in
response to different needs.
The children are taking part in
special "heritage classes",, which
were launched as an experiment in
1982 in the Aquitaine region to
which the Landes and Lot-et-Garonne
départements belong. The purpose of
48 the classes is to introduce young peo-

OF THE YEAR 2000

pie to the riches of the past and at
the same time encourage them to
contribute in their own way to the
safeguard of the cultural heritage.
As part of the heritage classes,
primary school children up to age
eleven spend a week with their
teachers in places rich in historical
monuments and archaeological re¬
mains. They usually stay in châteaux,
abbeys or other historic buildings,
thus learning at first hand about their
local heritage, which, hopefully, they
will safeguard when they grow up.
After visiting prehistoric sites the
children go on a trip to a flint work¬
shop where researchers show them
the techniques of our distant ances¬
tors. Then they make stone tools, the
efficiency of which they test by using
them to scrape skins or wood.
The vestiges of a forum or the
ruins of a well-preserved fourth-
century villa where the mosaic pav¬
ing of the baths has survived provide
an excellent introduction to the Gallo-
Roman period. From there the chil¬
dren move on to another workshop
where they make a small mosaic
using the methods described by
writers of Antiquity.
Twelfth-century abbeys and
churches, and strongholds of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
provide material to introduce the chil¬
dren to medieval religious, civil and
military architecture, to the ways in
which people thought in the Middle
Ages, their social and political rela¬
tionships and their economic
problems.
The week ends with an evening
get-together at which local musicians
play medieval and Renaissance music
on old ¡nstruments.The music and
dancing bring this initiation into the
local heritage to a festive conclusion.
At the request of both teachers
and pupils, a second, complementary
type of heritage class has been created
to introduce ten- to fifteen -year-olds
to the techniques of archaeology.
It was clearly impossible to allow
the children to excavate real archaeo¬
logical sites which might in any case
turn out to yield few finds and would
be educationally disappointing. In¬
stead a site has been purpose-built
for the budding archaeologists. It
consists of a succession of layers or
levels, each of which corresponds to
a period when the site was occupied.
In particular there are a "prehistor¬
ic" level and a "historical" level, giv¬
ing scope for a wide coverage of the
science and methods of archaeology.
The reconstitution of the "pre¬
historic" level was straightforward.
Knowledge of vestiges left by Euro¬
pean hunter-gatherers and the tech¬
niques of making stone tools is today
sufficiently advanced to enable ar¬
chaeologists to recreate with preci¬
sion the floor of a shelter, a hearth,
a rock-cutting area and other remains
of a prehistoric camp.
The major difficulty arose with
the reconstitution of the "historical"
level, surprisingly perhaps since our
knowledge of later history is more
complete. It would of course have
been possible to reconstitute a piece
of wall in brick or stone, but the or¬
ganizers would in this case have had
to make reproductions of old ear¬
thenware and metal objects, unless
material unearthed during excava¬
tions was usedand this was out of
the question because of the concern
to preserve the heritage.
To solve this problem, it was
decided to create a "contemporary"
level using objects dating from the
1960s picked up on a garbage dump.

Before they start to excavate, the
children are told that they are ar¬
chaeologists in the year 2000 and
that surface inspection has yielded
evidence that the site on which they
are to work had once been occupied.
For confirmation they will have to
carry out a limited excavation of a
4-metre-square area, using archaeo¬
logical tools such as trowels, dental
instruments and paintbrushes. The
levels can easily be identified because
they consist of sand stained with
different colours. During the excava¬
tion, the objects are left in situ.
When each level has been entire¬
ly excavated, a drawing is made of
its structure and the objects it con¬
tains, using decametre sticks, plumb
lines and spirit levels, so that the site
can be reconstituted to scale the next
day in class, when the results are ana¬
lysed and commented on.
There were grounds for thinking
that this "contemporary" level would
hold little interest for pupils, but it has
turned out to be richer from an
educational point of view than any
other. The children recognize most of
the objects and describe their func¬
tions without difficulty. Next they
have to find out the uses of different
parts of the site, such as a kitchen,
part of a bedroom, and a section of
street.
The remains of the entrance to
a house make it possible to distin¬
guish "inside" from "outside". Traces
of garbage outside the house suggest
that this was where the dustbin was
kept. Bed springs and parts of a
television encourage the children to
think that here was an area for rest
and relaxation, while a water tap and
the remains of a washbasin suggest
that they might be in a bathroom

rather than a living room. Kitchen
utensils, gas burners and a refrigera¬
tor grid are unequivocal evidence of
the functions of the area where they
are found. Lastly, information on
empty cans or on fragmented objects
later glued together indicate their ori¬
gins and illustrate the notion of ex¬
change between different regions.
Some idea of culinary practices can
be deduced from the type of uten¬
sils and the food products discovered
on the site.
The children thus learn from eas¬
ily recognizable "archaeological" ob¬
jects how archaeologists excavate
and record their findings and how
they reason when trying to reconsti¬
tute former ways of life.
The excavation then carries on
down to the "prehistoric" layer which
is pitted with holes for stakes and
contains the remains of hearths (char¬
coal, burned pebbles), pieces of flint,
and tools. Building on the experience
they have gained from excavating the
"contemporary" level, the children's
methods have greatly improved. They
now confidently use techniques and
reasoning which were formerly be¬
yond their grasp.
