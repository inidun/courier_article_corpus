AYUTYA
VENICE OF SOUTH ASIA
by Sumet Jumsai na Ayutya
OME eighty miles north of
the Gulf of Siam, up the
river Chao Phya, past and beyond
Bangkok, we come to the heart of the
Indochinese Peninsula. Here amid
the fertile expanse of the, delta lands
and rice fields is situated a ruined city,
its derelict pagodas and' its clusters
of jungle foliage outlined against the
skyline. As one approaches this
green mass of vegetation, more
pagodas and other structures such as
brick arches of former bridges, walls
and ramparts can be seen. Hidden
under all this, under the trees and the
reeds, one of the world's most
fascinating cities lies buried.
This is Ayutya (variously written as
Ayudhya, Ayuthia, Ayutthaya, and
Ayut'ia) the biggest and most cosmo¬
politan city of the seventeenth century
south of China. Originally the city
dates back to the eighth century when
the Thais were still predominently in

jungle vege'tation. Standing out above the trees (above), are the slender pinnacles of
the three stupas of Wat Phra Sri-sanphet, the greatest and most beautiful of the city's temples.

today lies amid the
ruins of Ayutya, Siam's
ancient capital which was
destroyed in 1767.

to date from the
16th century, and is
named after the temple,
which once housed it the
Wat Lokaya-sudha
(Temple of Water of
Immortality on Earth).

of Ayutya drawn by a Dutch
cartographer. It reveals the
astonishing originality of this city
built amid the waters. A
network of canals criss-crossed
the city, constructed on a
natural peninsular formed by
the meandering Menam river.
A by-pass canal made the peninsular
into an Island. A bustling
activity reigned in this Venice
of the East, whose ruined
buildings today reveal
architecture of exceptional
richness and variety. Right, the

what is now the southern Chinese pro¬
vince of Yunnan, and when Angkor,
built on a monumental scale, was the
most thriving urban centre with its
empire ruling over most of the Indo-
chinese subcontinent.
Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty
conquered the Thais of Yunnan in 1250
and made that province part of China
once and for all. This led to an
emigration of the Thais southwards
where several independent Thai
kingdoms or city states were already
being formed at the expense of the
Kmer Empire, and on the decline of its
capital city, Angkor.
Ayutya was the last to emerge
towards the end of the fourteenth
century as the capital of Siam which
was to become the most powerful of
the Thai kingdoms and the only one
to remain independent throughout its
history. Ayutya continued to be the
Siamese capital until 1767 when a
Burmese army destroyed it completely.
Since then the seat of government has
been Bangkok.
Most of the Thais remained a
mountain or valley people, like those
who stayed in Yunnan or those who
settled immediately south of China,
from Assam and the Shan States to
Laos and most of what is now North
Viet-Nam. But those who penetrated
further south into the rich delta lands
very quickly developed into an
"aquatic" society, with paddy rice
cultivation and waterways as the
source of their wealth and power.
The first immigrants, then, came into
the powerful Kmer ' Empire. They
came into contact with a highly
advanced "hydraulic" society whose
power was founded upon rice agri¬
culture which was served by the most
gigantic hydraulic installation ever
devised. In the centre of this system,
and controlling it, stood the city of
Angkor.
The world at that time had many
water towns and cities with varying
degrees of hydraulic sophistication.
Before Angkor, there had been
Shantan in China which was conceived
and built as a gigantic urban machine
operated and serviced by water.
Soochow, in the Kiangsu Province,
which is probably the most beautiful
and completely planned canal city,
dates at least one thousand years
before Venice and its contemporary,
Angkor, and therefore well before the
Dutch water towns, before AyutyaJ
Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), which
incidentally has become a completely
"dry" city, and still later cities like
Batavia (Jakarta) and Bangkok (both
now becoming more or less "dry"),
and St. Petersburg (Leningrad) still
invariably known as the "Venice of
the North".
But Angkor was different in
that it came into being through
the coincidence of three factors:
geography, technology, and urban
symbolism. The particular geography
with its floods and draining direction
dictated a particular form of water
"sculpture" which was relèvent to both
hydraulic engineering and cosmo-
magic orientation. The Kmer city was
the microcosm of Hindu cosmology
with its formal disposition of the water
and the solid elements.
The Thais of the emerging Siam
were pragmatists and flexible in their
outlook. Although extensive canal¬
ization was embarked upon, the
precise and somewhat vulnerable
hydraulic planning of the Kmers made
no impression on them. There was
no real attempt to control water ;
instead, the whole society was part of
water, living on it and flowing with it.
Monumental structures and rigid urban
symbolism gave way to what was the
most practical and easiest solution of
building a city. Therefore they chose
first of all an existing settlement
complete with the essential urban
organization which was well placed in

the middle of the rich delta lands.
This was the eighth century city of
Ayutya.
Aerial photographs and a preliminary
analysis show that Ayutya was a city
of canals, with building compounds
defined by and integrated into a
network of waterways. In 1350,
soon after the arrival of the Thais, the
old site lost its importance when a
newer urban centre was built
immediately to the west, in a natural
peninsula formed by a big meandering
river. A by-pass canal was constructed
to make the peninsula into an island.
Here was the Siamese solution of
doing the least work in exchange for
a maximum result.
The city was given a wide moat and
a "ring road" which was always made
navigable and flushed by the action
of nature. Gradually two more big
rivers nearby were linked to the new
urban centre by the numerous by-pass
canals. The newer city, now known
as Ayutya, became the junction of
three very important rivers. To the
north, it gained access to and control
over the northern Thai kingdoms; to
the south the river led to the open sea
and the control of the Malay Peninsula
as well as the international trade
between India and Japan.
Agricultural products and trade
converged upon Ayutya on boats.
The canals were the all-weather
highways. From the "ring road" or
moat, they were led through water-
gates into the innumerable canals
within the confines of the city wall, and
eventually to the palaces, market¬
places, temples, schools, and private
house compounds: There were up to
19 water gates, 15 main land gates
with water landings, and numerous
other smaller gates, giving a total of
about 100 city gates. The city wall
with some 17 forts for cannons, each
guarding the main approaches of
water traffic, enclosed' an area of
about seven square kms (3 square
miles).
As far as present research reveals,
the number of canals within this area
is staggering. The canals were
straight and gridiron in plan. Many had
brick-paved streets alongside, and all
were lined with big trees, giving both
pedestrians and water traffic ample
protection from the tropical sun.
With so many canals and streets,
there must have been many bridges,
but only 29 are named and identified
by an old record. Half of this number
were very high brick arches to allow
for water traffic. One was constructed
of laterite to accomodate elephants.
There were three palaces. The
main Royal Palace was a complete
walled-in city in itself and was
subdivided into the king's private
residence, and an outer walled
compound containing various offices of
the civil service. Private houses were
simple constructions of wood, for all
the effort was concentrated on the
350 or more monasteries, many of
which had their own schools and
libraries.
The Chinese who had the special
privilege of living within the city walls,
had their Chinatown. This was the
most opulent secular quarter, with
shops and warehouses of brick and
stucco. Here a European of Greek
origin took up residence in an elegant
building, then entered the Siamese
civil service and became the First
Minister of the Crown in 1686.
Further along, behind the main forts
overlooking the dock for sea vessels,
he founded a college named after
himself, Constantin (Phaulkon) College.
The king had his own private dock
next to the Royal Palace where the
royal barges were kept. The city was
subdivided into administrative units
and quarters according to the different
activities and types of industry. The
centre was marked by a simple tower,
housing a drum from which the hours
were struck.

Thailand has been called the land of Buddhist ¡mages. One
of the most familiar sights in the ruins of Ayutya are the
¡mages of Buddha, though many, like the one shown here, are now
disfigured. This statue stands near the Wat Chao Phya-thai
(The Temple of the Supreme Patriarch), a former monastery for
monks of a sect devoted to meditation.
The population seems to have varied
a great deal. The success of a
military campaign could mean tens of
thousands of people being brought to
settle at Ayutya. The city and its
environs would then exceed the half
million mark. But when the Burmese
besieged the city in 1569 with an army
of over a million men and eventually
took it, only some 10,000 people were
left behind among the ruins. (Accord¬
ing to Europeans observers, in this
particular war the Burmese army was
over two million men strong, and after
its capture, Ayutya had a mere
4,000 inhabitants!)
Whatever the actual population in
normal times, there appears to have
been a great number of boats and a
huge "floating" population. For a
royal procession on water up to
30,000 attendants might be gathered
on some 3,000 barges, all fantastically
sculptured and gilded, and flanked
by 600,000 people on 20.000 boats
along both banks of the processional
waterway.
It was truly a water city, rightly
known to the Europeans of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as
the "Venice of the East". But it was
more than this, for people were
integrated into the water pattern.
The whole society seemed to float
and flow along the innumerable canals
and rivers without calculation and
struggle. This aquatic phenomenon
may be equated with the sense of
flexibility of the Siamese which
accounts for their political survival.
Certainly Siam had dealt astutely
with the various European powers
from the beginning of the seventeenth
century when its first embassy to
Europe was dispatched to Holland in
1609 as the result of the growing
Dutch trade and influence. Then
there were the famous exchanges of
embassies with Versailles in the 1680's,
,when an embassy was also sent to
the Vatican. According to a member
of the French embassy in Ayutya at
that time, there were 40 different
nationalities represented at the
Siamese court.
Foreigners were allowed to build
their own towns and religious estab¬
lishments around the city proper.
The Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese
towns occupied the best commercial

After its capture and
destruction, Ayutya fell
prey to plunderers and
vandals who despoiled
2nd defaced pagodas and
shrines in their search for
treasure. Traffic in works
of art led to further
ravages. Innumerable
heads, like this one
abandoned In the ruins,
were removed from
statues of the Buddha.

AYUTYA (Continued)
A unique contribution to world civilization
positions, these being on the southern
approach of all sea shipping. The
king participated directly in the inter¬
national trade, maintained his own
bank for money loans, and kept a
private commercial fleet for shipping
between India and Japan.
Where now there is nothing but
dense undergrowth and rice fields,
there once flowed a rich life, full of
bustling activities and colour, all based
on water. The comings and goings
of embassies and merchants, the
ceremonial processions, the floating
markets, music, court dancing were the
essence of this remarkable aquatic
society. When the city was sacked
in 1767, its treasures were removed
and its archives burnt. Robbers
began a systematic uprooting of
pagodas to find buried treasures.
Then the jungle also moved in.
The Thai Government has recently
drawn up an ambitious scheme to
make Ayutya a national historical park.
The project was initiated by the Thai
Department of Town and Country
Planning which prepared a detailed
plan in conjunction with the Fine Arts

Department. Apart from its other
cultural activities, this department is
responsible for looking after all
historical monuments throughout the
country.
The Department of Town and
Country Planning is a newly-
established office which, in drawing
up development plans for towns and
cities, not only considers the modern
environment but also envisages the
incorporation of existing historical
landmarks into the overall design. It
so happens that most of the towns
throughout the kingdom are of an
historical nature, and until recently
still retained such historical landmarks
as city walls and fortifications. There¬
fore in drawing up development plans
for existing historical towns, the two
departments work closely together.
It was through the initiative of these
authorities that the Thai cabinet met
two years ago to discuss the problems
of preserving what was left of the
various city walls and fortifications,
and decided to impose a strict order
for the conservation of such national
monuments.
Ayutya, however, is different from
other old towns because of its special
significance to the country, having
been the capital city of Siam for four
centuries before the setting up of
Bangkok as capital in 1782. In
addition to the chaotic state of the
ruins as the result of past vandalism,
there are other problems such as
modern encroachment, and the future
expansion of a small town on the
eastern rim of the old city. Some
modern buildings have recently been
built scattered among the ruins,
often at the expense of the latter.
The project aims to make a clear
separation between the new town and
the historical area. An old canal
running north-south from the Palace
of the Front to the old Chinatown acts
as the demarcation between the
modern town on the east, and the
historical park on the west. A small
part of the former island city will thus
be given over to the development of
the modern town.
There are two reasons for this.
First, the area in question is already
partially urbanized, and mass eviction
would be undesirable. Secondly, it is
felt that the projected historical park
immediately to the west should not
be completely emptied of local people
because their services may be needed
to support the future tourist industry.
In its final form, the project involves
a rational allocation of urban and
industrial centres away from the
historical park, and a complete
restoration scheme for the various
ruins and canals.
The project is a 20-year programme
divided into three stages. The First
Five Year Plan gives priority to the
development of the modern town and
to the prevention of any further
modern encroachment into the his¬
torical area. It is assumed that at
this stage there will be only a limited
budget available for restoration work,
all priority being given to Thailand's
economic development. Even, so, a
definite move has been made towards
long term planning in this field.
The Second Five Year Plan involves
projects for both the modern town
and the historical park. As the jungle
is cleared away, some of the old
canals, brick-paved streets and bridges
will be brought to light, and various
palaces and temples uncovered and
restored. Re-allocation to the modern
zone of some of the modern
buildings among the ruins will also
begin.
The last stage, a ten-year pro¬
gramme, involves clearing away the
rest of the jungle and complete
restoration work. At this stage many
old canals will have been redug,
serving not only as tourist attractions,
but also as an essential part of a
storm drainage system. The older
eighth century city of Ayutya further
to the south-east awaits a future
research and restoration scheme. It
should be mentioned that scattered
throughout the country lie many walled
cities and archaeological sites still
covered by the jungle, and all awaiting
researchers and funds for restoration.
The Ayutya project will see many old
waterways revived and buildings and
fortifications properly restored. It
will soon be possible for a visitor to
meander once more along the
innumerable canals of the old city
among the palaces and pagodas of
the past. Thus, it is hoped, the
aquatic culture of Ayutya will make a
unique contribution to the civilizations
of the world.
