If there is one notion that a 
European seeking to unders-
tand the problem of south Asia 
must banish from his mind, it is 
that of the “exotic”. Contrary to 
what so many suggestions in lite-
rature and travellers’ experiences 
may imply, the civilizations of the 
East are in essence no different 
from those of the West. 
Let us take a look at the bare 
remains that the passage of the 
centuries, sand, floods, saltpetre, 
rot and the Aryan invasion have 
left of the oldest culture of the 
East – the sites in the Indus 
valley, Mohenjodajo, Harappa, 
4,000 to 5,000 years old. What a 
disconcerting experience! Streets 
straight as a bowstring, intersec-
ting each other at right angles; 
workers’ quarters with houses of 
dreary, unvarying design; indus-
trial workshops for the milling of 
flour, the casting and chasing of 
metals, or the “mass production” 
of those cheap goblets whose 
remains still litter the ground; 
municipal granary occupying (to 
use a modern term) several 
“blocks”; public baths, drains and 
sewers; residential quarters provi-
ding comfortable yet graceless 
homes designed more for a whole 
society that lived in comfort than 
for a minority of the well-to-do 
and powerful – all this can hardly 
fail to suggest to the visitor the 
glamour and blemishes of a great 
modern city, even in their most 
advanced form as Western civili-
sation knows it, and as presented 
to Europe today, as a model, by 
the United States of America. 
One would imagine that, over 
four or five thousand years of 
history, the wheel had come full 
circle – that the urban, industrial, 
lower middle-class civilization of 
the towns of the Indus valley was 
not so basically different (except 
of course as regards size) from 
that which was destined, after its 
long European incubation, to 
reach full development only on 
the other side of the Atlantic. 
Thus even in their earliest 
days, the most ancient civilisa-
tions of the Old World were giving 
the New World its lineaments. 
Admittedly, the twilight of an 
ancient history of uniform design 
marked the dawn of other, hetero-
geneous histories. But the diver-
gence was never more than 
occasional. 
From the days of pre-history 
down to those of modern times, 
East and West have constantly 
striven to re-establish that unity 
which diverging lines of develop-
ment have undermined. But even 
when they seemed to diverge the 
systematic nature of their opposi-
tion – the place seen at each 
extreme, geographically and one 
might even say morally, of the 
most ancient and the more recent 
scene, India on one hand, America 
on the other – would supply addi-
tional proof, if such proof were 
necessary of the solidarity of the 
whole.
Amazonia and Asia – 
so similar,  
so different
Between these two extremes, 
Europe occupies an intermediate 
position, a modest position no 
doubt, but one she strives to 
make worthy by criticizing what 
she regards as excesses    …

the weSt haS muCh to learn from aSia
Europe, by forcibly incorporating the still primitive Asia in a world economic system that 
was solely concerned to exploit raw materials and manpower, brought about a crisis, which 
today it is its to duty to remedy, declares Lévi-Strauss in 
this June 1952 Courier article.
Claude Lévi-Strauss
This is an abbreviated version of the article published in the International Social Science 
Bulletin, Vol. III, No. 4, trimestrial journal published by UNESCO.

… in the two extremes: the 
paramount attachment, in Ame-
rica, to things material and the 
exaggerated concentration, in the 
east, of things spiritual. Wealth on 
one hand, poverty onthe other, 
situations with which it is attemp-
ted to deal by two conflicting eco-
nomic theories involving, as an 
article of faith, “spending” in one 
case and “saving” in the other. 
When having spent long years 
in both of the Americas, the writer 
last year received, from a Keeper 
of Bengali manuscripts, his first 
lesson in Asiatic philosophy, he 
might have been enticed into an 
over simplified thesis. The picture 
was this : against the Amazon 
region of America, a poor and tro-
pical but under-populated area 
(the latter factor partly compen-
sating for the former), 
was set South Asia, 
again a poor and tropi-
cal, but this time over-
populated area (the 
second factor aggrava-
ting the first), in the 
same way that, of the 
regions with temperate 
climates, North America, 
with vast resources and 
relatively small popula-
tions, was a counterpart 
of Europe, with compa-
ratively small resources 
but a large population. 
When, however, the 
picture was shifted from 
the economic to the 
moral and psychological 
plane, these contrasts 
became more complex. 
For nothing seemed fur-
ther from the American 
pattern than the style 
Asia adopt as their final conclu-
sion an only slightly rationalized 
form of these traditional solu-
tions. It is because the latter are 
a rather logical result of the diffe-
rence in situation between Europe 
and Asia in face of a series of his-
torical upheavals that are funda-
mentally the same for both, but 
with an impact they endured in 
opposite ways.
The reverse side
When one flies over vast territo-
ries of South Asia, from Karachi 
to Saigon, and once the desert of 
Thar has been crossed, this land 
divided up into the smallest plots 
and cultivated up to the last acre, 
at first sight seems somewhat 
familiar to the European. When it 
is looked at more closely, howe-
ver, a difference emerges. 
These faded, washed out 
shades of pink and green, 
this irregular formation of 
f ields and r ice-paddies 
constantly appear ing in 
 dif ferent designs, these 
boundaries blurred as if in a 
patchwork – the whole 
carpet, so to speak, is the 
same; but because form and 
colour are less clear, less 
well-defined than in the 
landscapes of Europe, one 
has the impression of 
 looking at it “wrong side 
up”. This is, of course, 
merely an image. But it 
reflects rather well the dif-
ferent positions of Europe 
and Asia in regard to their 
common civilization. From 
the material point of view, 
at least one seems to be the 
“reverse side” of the other; … 
of life of this sage, whose pride 
lay in walking barefoot and 
having, as his sole earthly posses-
sions, three cotton tunics which 
he washed and mended himself, 
and who thought he has solved 
the social problem by cooking his 
food on a fire of dead leaves, col-
lected and ground up with his own 
hands. 
This doctrine of systematic 
reduction of needs, this effort to 
minimise contact and exchange 
between people and things, this 
withdrawal into oneself to cease 
encroaching on others and at the 
same time ensure better commu-
nication with  Being, do not grow 
out of a form of thought that 
opposes Western thought. In fact, 
certain Western scholars who have 
studied the problems of Southeast

had arrived in the “land of milk 
and honey”. 
It can never be stated often 
enough that it was Europe, which 
by forcibly incorporating the still 
primitive Asia in a world econo-
mic system that was solely concer-
ned to exploit raw  materials, 
manpower, and the possibility of 
new markets, brought about (invo-
luntarily no doubt, and no less 
through the benefits than through 
the abuses of the pro-
cess) a crisis, which 
today it is its to duty 
to remedy. 
Compar ing itself 
with America, Europe 
acknowledges its own 
less favourable posi-
tion as regards natural 
wealth, population 
pressure, individual 
output and the ave-
rage level of consump-
t ion;  r ight ly  or 
wrongly, on the other 
hand, it takes pride in 
the greater attention it pays to 
spiritual values. It must be admit-
ted, mutatis mutandis, that Asia 
could reason similarly in regard to 
Europe, whose modest prosperity 
represents, for her, the most 
unwarranted luxury. In a sense, 
Europe is Asia’s “America”. And 
this “Asia” with less riches and 
more population, lacking the 
necessary capital and technicians 
for its industrialization, and 
seeing it soil and its livestock 
deteriorating daily while its popu-
lation increases at an unpreceden-
ted rate, is constantly inclined to 
remind Europe of the two conti-
nents’ common origin and of their 
unequal situation  … 
sical and moral corruption resul-
ting from over-concentrated, 
collective existence. Everything 
that, in the West, seems merely 
to be a pathological accident 
attending, for the time being, a 
normal process of growth is, one 
might say, a normal state of 
things in the East, which plays 
the same game but is condemned 
to hold all the worst cards. 
Yet, without going back four 
or five thousand years, this stri-
king misfortune seems to have 
been neither inescapable nor of 
very ancient standing. As recently 
as the 17th and 18th centuries – 
thanks no doubt, very largely, to 
the Mogul emperors, who were 
admirable administrators – the 
population of south Asia was not 
over-numerous, and there was an 
abundance of agricultural and 
manufactured products. European 
travellers who saw bazaars exten-
ding from 15 to 20 miles into the 
country (as, for instance, from 
Agra to Fatipur Sikhri) and sel-
ling goods at what seemed to 
them ridiculously cheap prices, 
were not sure whether or not they 
… one has always been  the 
winner, the other the loser, as if 
in a given enterprise (begun, as 
we have said, jointly) one had 
secured all the advantages and 
the other all the embarrassments. 
In one case (though will it 
always be so?) an expansion of 
population has paved the way for 
agricultural and industrial pro-
gress, so that resources have 
increased more quickly than the 
number of people 
consuming them; in 
the other, the same 
phenomenon has, 
since the beginning 
of the 18th century, 
assumed the form 
of a constant lowe-
ring of the amount 
taken by each indi-
v idua l  f rom a 
common pool that 
has remained more 
or less stationary. 
It is to the 
birth and develop-
ment of urban life that Europe 
has come to attach its highest 
material and spiritual values? But 
the incredibly rapid rate of urban 
development in the East (e.g. in 
Calcutta, where the population 
has increased from 2 to 5 million 
in the space of a few years), has 
merely had the effect of concen-
trating, in the poverty-stricken 
areas, such misery and tragedy as 
have never made their  appearance 
in Europe except as a counterpart 
to advances in other directions. 
For urban life in the East means 
nothing but promiscuity, the 
most elementary lack of hygiene 
and comfort, epidemics, under 
nourishment, insecurity and phy-

All Western civilization has 
tended to separate corporeal from 
spiritual activities as completely 
as possible, or rather to treat 
them as two uncommunicating 
worlds. This is reflected in its phi-
losophical, moral and religious 
ideas, and in the forms taken by 
its techniques and everyday life. 
Only recently, with the develop-
ment of psychiatry, analysis and 
psycho-somatic medicine, has the 
West really begun to grasp the 
inseparability of the two worlds. 
This key, which is new to it and 
which it handles so clumsily, Asia 
has long known how to use – for 
purposes, it is true, which are not 
exactly the same. For the West, 
which for three centuries has 
concentrated mainly on deve-
loping mechanical processes, has 
forgotten (or rather has never 
tried to develop) those processes 
of the body which can produce in 
that instrument – the only natural 
and also the most universal one at 
man’s disposal – effects whose 
diversity and accuracy are gene-
rally unknown. 
… in regard of their exploi-
tation of a common heritage.
Europe must reconcile herself to 
the fact that Asia has the same 
material and moral claims upon 
her that Europe often asserts she 
herself has upon the United 
States. If Europe considers she 
has rights vis-à-vis the New World 
whose civilization comes from 
hers, she should never forget that 
those rights can only be based on 
historical and moral foundations 
which create for her, in return, 
very heavy duties towards a world 
from which she herself 
was born. 
The West, however 
need not fear that, in 
this settling of accounts 
with the East, the latter 
alone will be the recei-
ver. Preoccupied as it 
has been, and for too 
long, with the econo-
mic aspect of the rela-
tions between the two 
worlds, the West has 
possibly overlooked a 
number of lessons it 
can learn from Asia, 
and which it is not too 
late to ask now.
Body and Spirit
Despite the interest evinced by 
scholars and the remarkable work 
accomplished by Orientalists in 
the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, the mind of the West 
has not, as a whole, been very 
open to the messages of Asiatic 
thought; it seemed difficult to 
comprehend when attempts were 
made to introduce it to groups of 
peoples who lacked the basic 
experience underlying it.

This rediscovery of man’s body, 
in which Asia could be a guide to 
humanity, would also be a redis-
covery of his mind, since it would 
(as in Yoga and other similar sys-
tems) bring to light a network of 
actions and symbols, mental 
experiments and physical process 
which unless they were known, 
would probably prevent the psy-
chological and philosophical thou-
ght of the East from being, for the 
West, anything more than a series 
of empty formulae. 
This keen feeling, found in 
Asia, of the interdependence 
of aspects of life which 
elsewhere one tried to isolate 
and close off from each other, 
of the compatibility of values 
sometimes considered to be 
incompatible, is also found in 
the sphere of political and 
social thought. The first illus-
tration of this is in the field 
of religion. From Buddhism to 
Islam, proceeding by way of 
the various forms of Hinduism, 
the religions of South Asia 
have shown that they were 
supreme in the art of living 
together, comprehendingly, 
with other very dif ferent 
forms of belief. 
When Moslems 
controlled pork 
markets...
In East Bengal, not far from the 
frontier of Burma, we have seen 
side by side, mosques bereft of 
images, Hindu temples with fami-
lies of idols each of which enshri-
ned a god, and Buddhist pagodas 
filled with images (simple objects 
for contemplat ion)  … 

phere. From the time of Asoka 
– of whom the Director 
General of UNESCO, in his 
speech to the Indian National 
Commission, said that he 
“attained to the concept of a 
universal committee seeking 
the good of all created 
things”- to that of Gandhi, 
the ideal always sought was 
that of peaceful brotherhood. 
This ideal is particularly evi-
dent in the political and aes-
thetic achievements of the 
Emperor Akbar, whose ruined 
palaces – a combination of 
Persian, Hindu and even 
European styles side by side 
– affirm the will, and the pos-
sibility that dif ferent races, 
beliefs and civilizations should 
live together in harmony. 

… of a single sage supe-
rior to gods and men. These 
irreconcilable yet at the same 
time definitely complemen-
tary forms of human faith 
could co-exist peaceably, to 
such an extent that Moslem 
authorities supervised mar-
kets where the only meat dis-
played was pork (the staple 
food of the Mongol peasants 
in the hinterland of Chitta-
gong), and young Buddhists, 
under the amused eyes of 
their bonzes, helped enthu-
siastically to drag the god-
dess Kali’s chariot to the 
river, on the occasion of the 
Hindu festival. 
It would be easy to set against 
this idyllic picture the burnings 
and massacres that marked the 
separation of Pakistan from India. 
But in the case of these universal 
after-effects of nationalist poison, 
is it not the West that bears the 
primary responsibility? The only 
attempts South Asia made in the 
way of political unification – 
before Europe compelled it to 
think in European terms – develo-
ped in quite a different atmos-
 “Europe must reconcile herself 
to the fact that Asia has the same 
material and moral claims upon her 
that Europe often asserts she herself 
has upon the United States. If Europe 
considers she has rights vis-à-vis the 
New World whose civilization comes 
from hers, she should never forget 
that those rights can only be based 
on historical and moral foundations 
which create for her, in return, very 
heavy duties towards a world from 
which she herself was born.”
