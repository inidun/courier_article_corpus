Ta m i n g
the Nile’s serp e n t s
Guzzled by Egypt but generated in Ethiopia, the waters of the Blue Nile
have long been a source of sabre-rattling. A new plan might finally put
an end to the spectre of a river war
L
egend has it that at the time of the pharaohs,
the people of Egypt sent gifts up the Nile to
the kingdom of Ethiopia to placate the Gods
that fed the river’s source. Egypt had, a n d
remains to have, good reason to be grateful:
some 86 percent of the water that flows down the Blue
Nile to irrigate the arid North African country emanates
from floodplains on Ethiopian territory.
Yet the one-way river flow between Egypt and
Ethiopia—as might be expected between a country that
craves water and a country that supplies it for free—has
not always resulted in such harmonious exchanges of
g i f t s. In 1979, E g y p t ’s then president Anwar Sadat made
the Nile’s fate into an urgent issue of national security.
“The only matter that could take Egypt to war again is
w a t e r,” he said in reference to Ethiopia’s plans to tap into
its one precious natural asset.
The potential for conflict over the water is
u n d e n i a b l e. Some 95 percent of the Egyptian
population is packed onto the fertile ribbon of land
along the banks of the Nile and its delta, the country’s
only water sources of note. Desperately poor and
underdeveloped Ethiopia, in contrast, has suffered
periodic droughts since the 1970s, causing the loss of
millions of lives.The Blue Nile1, emerging largely from
Lake Tana in the Ethiopian highlands, has long been
eyed as a possible source for irrigation,h y d r o e l e c t r i c i t y
and general economic growth in a country whose
population is set to boom. At present, E t h i o p i a
consumes a mere two percent of the water available to
it.
Water distribution between the two A f r i c a n
neighbours has always had a political edge, but by the
time of Sadat’s sabre-rattling remarks, a different
rivalry was poisoning relations. After flirting for a
decade with the United States, Ethiopia found itself
ruled in the 1970s by Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam’s
Marxist regime. Soviet experts invited by the colonel
began studying the feasibility of damming the Nile’s
tributaries and exploiting its water, provoking Egypt
into threatening that any dams built would be
destroyed by military force.
“Although such threats gave rise to the commonly
held notion that future African wars would be over
w a t e r, the fact is that these tensions were a spin-off of
the Cold War,” argues Rushdie Saeed,one of Egypt’s
most prominent experts on water issues.
Since the end of the Cold War, however, the Nile
waters have continued to prompt regular diplomatic
s p a t s. The early 1990s, for example, saw Sudan and
Egypt at loggerheads following alleged efforts by the
Sudanese government to overthrow Egypt’s president,
Hosni Mubarak.Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint
Blue Nile Valley Organization and pledged to study
several major infrastructure projects with or without
Egypt’s approval. Once again, Mubarak resorted to
threats of military intervention.
Though a marked improvement in relations
between Cairo and Khartoum has since calmed nerves,
diplomats and experts are convinced that only a lasting
settlement will bring peace to the Nile’s coveted waters.
Until now, only one agreement has been signed by
Egypt and its neighbours—the Nile Waters A g r e e m e n t
of 1959 between Sudan and Egypt, itself based on a
deal made by the region’s colonial powers in 1929.
Ethiopia was not even mentioned in the accord.
Yet the case for some more equitable distribution
of the river waters is mounting by the day. B e s i d e s
Lining up for water in Ethiopia,a nation

E t h i o p i a ’s traumatic droughts and destitution,s t u d i e s
point to a staggering rise in the country’s population:
current data suggest that the population will increase
from 61.4 million at present to 186 million in 2050.
Given that only 1.7 percent of the country’s arable
land is irrigated (compared to 100 percent of Egypt’s ) ,
an exponential rise in demand for water is only to be
expected.
A durable solution might not be too far off. I n
July of this year, and after five years of preliminary
t a l k s, the 10 states of the Nile basin—including Egypt,
the Sudan and Ethiopia—announced that they had
secured World Bank money for a series of programmes
to explore how the river’s waters can best be shared.
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) has launched several
such studies, due to be followed by loans worth at
least three billion dollars.
Thrashing out
differences
“ The River Nile still has a great potential which is
not yet exploited and which can be a great benefit to
the people of the Nile basin,” said Egypt’s minister of
public works, Mahmoud Abu Zied, in a recent
interview. “Each country is entitled to an equitable
share from the river without causing appreciable harm
to the other riparian states.”
Underpinning the initiative is the experience of
states surrounding the Mekong River in Southeast
A s i a . Since 1957, Vi e t n a m , L a o s, Cambodia and
Thailand have been members of a commission charged
with economic development of the river basin. D e s p i t e
political differences between the
nations and an absence of formal
t r e a t i e s, the body has helped
convert the Mekong into a source
of regional integration instead of
r i v a l r y : the Nam Ngum
hydropower plant,completed in
Laos in 1971, provided electricity
to the home country and covered
80 percent of Th a i l a n d ’s needs,
even during the violent conflicts
that followed inauguration.
With this precedent in mind,
the World Bank hopes the Nile’s
waters might usher in a similar
spirit of co-operation. Which is
not to say that members of the
programme have been pulling
their punches. “ There are
questions such as how to
calculate future quotas. S h o u l d
it be according to the size of the
territory or the size of the
p o p u l a t i o n , or possibly the
availability of other water
r e s o u r c e s ? ,” wondered one
Egyptian official who took part in
a recent NBI meeting in Geneva.
“We all have different ideas for
answers and this remains to be
resolved.”
Ethiopia has already started
building a series of small dams
to tap the Blue Nile water.
According to officials involved in the projects, these
dams will benefit nations downstream by protecting
Sudan from over-flooding and reducing the silt
accumulation suffered by Lake Nasser dam in Egypt.
But Egypt’s Saeed is unconvinced by their arguments.
He insists that it is in fact more dangerous for the silt
to be stopped than for it to flow with the water: s h o u l d
the former occur,he says, the river might gain in energy
and cause havoc in the northern reaches of the Nile.
Saeed also takes issue with Ethiopia’s claims that
the new dams will enable the government to sell
electricity to neighbouring countries.“ Which countries
Ethiopian officials have had in mind is difficult to
d e t e r m i n e, h o w e v e r,as none of Ethiopia’s neighbours
are industrialized nations or great consumers of
electricity,” he observes.
All parties now admit, h o w e v e r, that their
differences of opinion are better thrashed out at the
negotiating table than left to the generals. Wh a t
promised to be A f r i c a ’s next war might just have
become Africa’s latest remedy. ■
