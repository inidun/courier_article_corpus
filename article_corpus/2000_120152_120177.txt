the party is picking up. So far only English numbers

even Pink Floyd,and a host of other stuff I neither
recognise nor am keen to.Then,someone decides
i t ’s time to party in earn e s t . The music stops. A
fresh cassette is inserted and when the first strains
of the new number are heard, the room explodes in
a collective roar. I t ’s Daler Mehndi, the dancing
Sikh,the undisputed king of bhangra pop. Finally,
the adrenalin is flowing and there’s not a soul who’s
not on the dance floor. For a few hours, it’s a long
list of Indipop singers,mostly bhangra.

This is new. Through the 1980s, and even in
the early 90s, it was infra-dig [beneath your dig-
nity] to admit in public that one listened to even
Hindi stuff, let alone Punjabi. Gurdas Mann, the
original bhangra star of the 80s, who is currently
e n j oying a minor reviva l , was only heard by Punjabi
kids at the working-class Khalsa College, b o r e d
shopkeepers and truck drivers. If you went to the
elite St. Stephens College, you played the likes of
Michael Jackson.

urban India has been transformed beyond belief.
Large tracts of rural India also show signs of change,
especially in the agri c u l t u r e - rich Punjab.

p a r a d ox of bhangr a : its emer-

t e n e rs have become more integr ated into the wo r l d

of Indian musical success in W h i t e m a n s l a n d , U K —
Apache Indian,Bally Sagoo, e t c.—is real.“ We are no
longer only consumers of other people’s cultures—now
we produce the music that the world wants to listen
t o.” But wa s n ’t the bhangra boom born in the We s t ,
and hasn’t it too been imported to India? “ Ye s ,but it’s
I n d i a n,d o n ’t you understand? It’s o u r guys there who
are making the music.”
But why bhangr a , I ask.“ B h a n gr a ’s got the beat .I t ’s
ve ry danceable,” I am inform e d .I s n ’t all folk music, I
a s k .“I guess.”S i l e n c e .“Remember dandiya ? ” asks an
older listener, r e f e rring to the form of folk music and
dance from the we s t e rn Indian state of Gujarat which
was all the rage in the 80s. “ T h at was danceable.” S o
w hy has it been deposed by bhangr a , I ask him.
“ S i m p l e ,” he say s. “ E a r l i e r , the Gujjus [Gujarat i s ]
were the single largest expat [ ri ate] populat i o n .N ow, t h e
Punjus [Punjabis] have taken ove r. And so has their

d o n ’t we hear gidda? It’s from Punjab and as danceable
as bhangr a . “ S i m p l e ,” I am told again. “Gidda is
wo m e n ’s song.H ow can men sing or dance to it?”B u t
i s n ’t bhangra too masculine? It’s sung by men.“ Ye a h ,”
he say s. “ T h at ’s the point. B h a n gra is m e n ’s s o n g .S o
e ve rybody can dance to it.”Ye a h , simple again, I guess.
A Punjabi friend passionate about his music pro-
vides a different explanat i o n .“ I t ’s all a question of iden-
t i fic at i o n ,” he say s. “ B h a n gra has become associat e d
in the popular mind with the culture of Punjab.T h i s
has happened because of Hindi fil m s , which have
used bhangra more than any other Punjabi folk form .
People now think that bhangra is all there is to Pun-
jabi music. Much of what we hear today is now h e r e
near bhangr a , but it all gets called that because of the
use of the d h o l [a percussion instrument slung on the
shoulder and played on both sides with sticks]. A ny-
thing on the d h o l and with some balle balle [a generi c
c ry expressing happiness] or k u d i ye [Punjabi for gi r l ]
is just assumed to be bhangr a .”So what is it? “Most of
it is kitsch.You know, just taken from here and there
and mixed together.W h at e ver wo r k s ,wo r k s.Then we
get to hear a million va ri ations of that .Till something
else clicks.” In the meanwhile, of cours e , music com-
panies have made millions.
Would you believe it, t h e n —
much of what we think is
b h a n gra is not bhangra at all!
“Who cares?”, s ays an 18-ye a r
o l d .“ I t ’s Indian, and we u n d e r-

Daler Mehndi, I ask. H ow

d o n ’t listen carefully,” she say s.
“Some of his songs are beau-
t i f u l . They are really p h i l o s o p h i c a l.” P h i l o s o p h i c a l ?
“Ye e e e s.You know, t h e r e ’s one where he talks about love

Punjabi lines.Ye s , I admit, the lines are beautiful.B u t
the language is far from simple to unders t a n d .“ Ye a h .

c o n fides my young fri e n d . N ow that ’s interesting.
And what did grannie think about it? “ O h , she is just

songs could be played in discos and part i e s.” I s n ’t she
offended? “Not really. She says we live in times when

make some money.”But is she happy with the fact? “ I

So bhangra has come full circle. C r e ated by the
hardy Punjabi peasant to celebrate harve s t s , m a r-
riages and other joyous occasions, it was exported by
his expat ri ate grandson to the we s t . There it wa s
r e m i xed with techno, rap and reggae of black neigh-
b o u r h o o d s , and with Hindi film music as we l l .R e i n-
vented thus, it gets exported back to India by large
music corp o r ations who make enormous profits in the
p r o c e s s. And here in India, it helps rich kids of an
increasingly anglicized elite rediscover their own ru r a l
h e ri t a g e . In completing this loop, of cours e ,b h a n gr a
loses all links with the mat e rial life of the peasants who
c r e ated it. But who cares? It’s p a a a a rt i e e e e t i m e . ■
