For those who are unacquainted
with Argentina, or with Hernan¬
dez's poem Martin Fierro (1),
which has been published in French
by Unesco, the mark of the gaucho is
his lasso. But this is a mistake. The
inseparable companion of the Pampas
horseman is his guitar.
When Martin Fierro took his guitar
to sing of his misfortunes, everyone in
the campo understood him. In fact,
his forceful protests were so close to
life that, in seven years, 30,000 copies
of the book were bought by the hum¬
ble folk of Argentina. Yet forty years
went by before the educated élite of
the country decided to recognize Her¬
nandez as one of its greatest poets.
José Hernandez, born in 1834 at the
family estancia some miles from
Buenos Aires, led a gaucho's life from
his earliest youth. He learnt to ride,
to herd cattle, to drive back the raid¬
ing Indians. He rwore the broad-
brimmed hat, the fringed trousers and

the poncho, which is used as a blank¬
et at night. He was an expert with
the lasso, the bolas and the fighting
knife, as well as in the art of drawing
music from the guitar; he also became
a journalist whose pen was to be
reckoned with in the political
struggles that followed the fall of the
dictator, Juan Manuel Rosas in 1852.
During his period of exile resulting
from the defeat
of his party, he
decided to make
a public protest
against the hard
life that was then
the gauchos' lot.
And so he pub¬
lished the first
part of Martin
Fierro in 1872,
followed seven
years later by The
Return of Martin
Fierro.
For the first
time in the his¬
tory of Spanish-
speaking Ameri¬
ca, a poet was
taking up the de¬
fence of a class
which, already exploited, was threat¬
ened with extermination by the im¬
migration policy of the successors of
Rosas. Yet the gaucho had not
always been a social pariah. Before
and even during the Rosas dictator¬
ship, he was a free man, who spent
his life alone with his horse, in the
midst of his herds, and whose code
was a simple one: each man his own
defender.
When the enemies of the Dictator
came to power and put into effect
their programme of modernization,
including the development of agri¬
culture through immigration, at the
expense of stock-raising, this produced
a radical change in the status of the
gaucho. Too poor to buy land for
himself, he wandered from village to
village, and a law against vagrants
made him a perpetual delinquent.
The gaucho soon became the victim
of despotism: sheriffs, judges, officers
of the militia, all went out of their
way to persecute, rob and imprison
this incorrigible lover of freedom, or
else send him to the frontier.
Hernandez was the first writer to
denounce the scandal of these so-
called "frontier contingents". The
system was to
send all suspect
persons or those
whose affairs
were not proper¬
ly in order to
fight against the
Indians. These
wretched crea¬
tures went into
battle armed with
sticks and if they
ran away, they
naturally became
"deserters" and
were treated as
such.
José Hernandez
was determined
that the whole
question should at
least be brought
to light. He created the character of
Martin Fierro one of the payadores
who go from village to village, like
mediaeval troubadours, telling the
stories dear to the heart of the gau¬
cho. Martin Fierro tells the story of
his life simply and straight-forward-
ly. He begins by introducing himself
and goes on to evoke the happy life
that once was the gaucho's:
"Twas long ago that with wife and
[sons,
And cattle a goodly batch,
I rode my horse among the best;"
and then what followed:
"But into the army I
.[was pressed,
And when I came back,
[of all I owned,
There was only walls and
[thatch."

THE PAMPAS

Life at the frontier meant blows,
hard labour, privation:
"...the Colonel sent us to work on
[his farms,"
"And the filthy state we soon were
[in,
Was horrible to see;
For pity's sake one's heart might
[break,"
Martin Fierro escaped and made his
way home, to find that his wife had
gone off with another man:
"And my wife alas! What good
[are tears;
She Is lost to me forever.
They said with some hawk she flew
[away,
That had hung round there for
[many a day;
No doubt she did it to get the bread
That I wasn't there to give her."
His children had had to take work
as peons:
"But how could they work? the
[featherless chicks,
Thrown out too soon from the nest,"
And as for his home:
"Only a few bare poles were left,
And the thatch and nothing more;"
Martin Fierro, who had "started
soft", then decided to be "as mad as
a mountain cat". Roving from village
to village, he drank too much one
evening and, at a dance, he killed a
Negro (this is what the gaucho calls
having an accident). A little later, a
gaucho provoked him with allusions
about his wife, and Martin Fierro had
a second "accident". That time he
was pursued by the police, who attack¬
ed him by night. There were ten of
them against him, and he put up such
a splendid fight that Sergeant Cruz,
one of the police, went over to his
side and helped him to get rid of his
attackers.
It is now the turn of Cruz to take
the guitar and tell the story of his
life an equally unhappy one. From
now on Cruz and Fierro are friends.
They decide to flee and join the
Indians as there is no longer a place
for them in their own country.
At this point the first book of
Martin Fierro comes to an end. The
second part, which Hernandez wrote
seven years later, shows the hero
returning from the desert and telling
of the Indians whom he now knows so
well. Here too, Hernandez is the
first Latin American author to describe
the Indians without false exoticism or
emotional bias.
After great suffering, the death of
Cruz from smallpox, and finally a ter¬
rific struggle to wrest a Christian
captive from the clutches of the
Indian who is torturing her, Martin
Fierro escapes with the unfortunate
woman and returns home where he

finds his own two sons and Cruz's son.
This time it is the three young men
who take up the guitar one after the
other and tell their story, whose
successive stages may be briefly sum¬
med up: poverty, injustice, oppression,
unhappy love, imprisonment and
finally the frontier contingent.
But in the café where they are thus
telling in song the story of their lives,
there is a Negro, who, in the tradition
of the country, challenges Martin
Fierro to a payada de contrapunto.
This is a kind of singing match in
which the adversaries seek to outwit
one another with riddles. At the end
of this match Martin Fierro gives in
to the superior skill of his opponent,
who then makes himself known as the
brother of the Negro killed many
years before at the dance. Martin
Fierro, with the wisdom of age and
bitter experience, refuses to fight him
and leaves with the three young men,
to whom he gives the following good
advice:
"If your friend's in need, be his
[friend in deed,
Never leave him in the lurch;
But don't ask him for what you lack,
Or load your troubles on his back."
"Even infidels will treat you well
If you give every man his due."
Filial affection, modesty, respect for
age, brotherly help, the forgiveness of
injuries, the abhorrence of crime and
of strong drink, and true love between
man and wife, are all dealt with in a
series of judicious statements, deliver¬
ed in simple sentences that have the
force of proverbs.
Then Martin Fierro concludes with
a plea for the gaucho, followed by
these moving lines:
"And if life fails me, this I know,
When the news of my death is
[spread,
The roaming gaucho, far away
In the desert lands, will be sad that
[day,
And a sudden ache in his heart will
[wake,
When he knows that I am dead.
For I've told in these songs of my
[brothers' wrongs,
Their pains and their misery."
He had spoken true; his "brother
gauchos" adopted Martin Fierro im¬
mediately and the book became their
Bible. The following list of goods
ordered by a village store-keeper is
typical: "12 gross matches, 1 barrel
beer, 12 copies Martin Fierro".
Epic, lyric, dramatic and satiric
elements, steeped in an atmosphere of
noble sadness, are constantly mingled
in Martin Fierro, and for the reader
of this poem, the gaucho, unconscious
victim of a civilization which, having
no use for him, drove him to despera¬
tion, is an unforgettable figure.

MASTER OF THE HORSE,
THE HERD, THE GUITAR
v.*
After the gaucho of yesterday, so stirringly described in Martin Fierro, here is the
gaucho of today, the paisano. An intrepid horseman, he continues to display his
mastery in taming wild horses and matching his strength against the young cattle
he herds. One of his favourite distractions is to sing the cielitos, the traditional
gaucho songs, accompanying himself on the guitar. Today the gaucho is not to the
same extent the "King of the Pampas" he was a century ago, but the part he has played
in putting Argentina to the forefront of Latin American nations has been recognized.
