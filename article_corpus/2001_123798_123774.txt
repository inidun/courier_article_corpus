When the media
meet as one
Now the Internet’s star has faded, a new buzzword is circulating in the corridors
of the world’s media. But will “digital convergence” really be able to keep its promise
of communication and information anytime, anywhere, in any shape or form?
he past 40 years have witnessed an
extraordinary evolution. From slow
expensive machines controlled by punched
c a r d s, computers have become low-cost,
powerful units taking up no more space
than a briefcase. S i m u l t a n e o u s l y,our world
has become interlaced with telephone wires,
optic fib r e s, undersea cables, m i c r o w a v e
l i n k s, television channels and satellite
communications.
At the crossing of these two
developments stands the Internet—a direct
result of computer technology intersecting
with communication technology. But for
many in the world of today’s media,this is
merely a first landmark in what promises to
be a giant upheaval in the way people
communicate, relax and work. This is the
era of digital convergence.
According to a recent article in
Scientific A m e r i c a n, convergence is in
principle “the union of audio, video and
data communications into a single source,
received on a single device, delivered by a
single connection.” Digital technology has
already provided a medium for integrating
media that until now required distinct
channels of communication: we can now
send emails using our televisions or text
messages over mobile phones. Real-time
video can be transmitted over radio
c h a n n e l s, while television and radio can be
received on Personal Computers (PCs).
Hyped-up precedents
Full digital convergence promises real-
time access to information anywhere in the
world,and global communication through
t e x t ,g r a p h i c s,video and audio. In fact, t h e r e
seems to be no technological limit to what
might be possible.“ The reality of ‘ a n y w h e r e,
anytime’ access to broadband digital
networks is going to make our lives freer and
f u l l e r,”Gerald Levin,chief executive offic e r
of AOL Time Wa r n e r, has promised. B u t
technology alone cannot bring about such a
w o r l d :as long as consumers and companies
do not embrace it,convergence is likely to go
the way of several hyped-up predecessors.
Over a decade ago, for example, v i r t u a l
reality was the technology of the future,
and many people anticipated a day where
we would be wearing head-mounted
displays and interacting with all manner
of virtual environments. At the time there
was real concern about changes in industrial
practices and social behaviour brought
about by this technology. So what happened
to this vision? We l l , we got it wrong.
Currently, the home computer is the main
interface to the Internet. But relatively few
people in the world have access to PCs, a n d
few would argue that they are ideal for the
purpose—they crash and freeze because

Internet use.
In promising to fuse media as diverse as
t e l e v i s i o n , telephone communication,v i d e o
g a m e s, music and data transmission, t h e
era of digital convergence goes one better
than yesterday’s celebrated “information
s u p e r h i g h w a y.”Yet in doing so, it also raises
critical questions: what services are needed,
what is the ideal platform, will it be fully
interactive? Can the old be so easily
combined with the new?
At the root of any digital application
stands a binary coding system: d e s i g n e r s
of early computers found that only when
using such a system could their computers
be relied upon to give consistent results.Th e
binary code enables numbers, letters and
characters to be assigned unique digital
patterns that can be stored on magnetic
t a p e, compact discs, DVD and computer
fil e s.These digital codes can then be readily
transmitted via copper cable, fibre optics or
as radio waves. Once in a digital format,
t e x t ,a u d i o,graphics and video can therefore
all be processed by one common
technology with great accuracy.
Skeptical consumers
Yet achieving this single technology is
far from straightforward. There are
currently three major television broadcast
s t a n d a r d s, and they are all incompatible
with each another. But this is nothing
compared to the many technologies
supporting the Internet, each with a
different bandwidth and physical media.
The problems faced in designing platforms
and communication systems that will be
accepted across the world can appear
insuperable.
One body, the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), i s
at the heart of efforts to devise world
standards for coding audio-visual
i n f o r m a t i o n . Its Motion Picture Experts’
Group has already notched up several
important benchmarks via standards for
storage media and broadcast, while the
MPEG-4 (now under development) will
establish the means for storage, t r a n s m i s s i o n
and interactive manipulation of video
data—the essence of
what digital
convergence promises
to deliver.
Even once global
standards are assured,
h o w e v e r, a further
obstacle lies in wait.
The Internet is
plagued by long,
erratic response times
because it is a pull-technology, driven by
patterns of user demands. P u s h - t e ch n o l o gy,
on the other hand, reverses the
r e l a t i o n s h i p : servers simply send
information to passive users, as in
television and radio. But if some form of
combination between one-way television
flow and interactive Internet is to be the
basis of our future media,it is hard to see
how it could be operated.Current network
technology could not support a pull-based
approach towards television, while a push-
based approach would simply duplicate
what we have already: n o r m a l ,
uninteractive television or radio.
Yet the problem of fusing Internet with
television is also one of defining the services
o f f e r e d . As Steve Jo b s, chief executive
o f ficer of A p p l e,has observed:“TV is where
you go to turn your brain off; the computer
is where you go to turn it on.” I n f o r m a t i o n ,
entertainment and relaxation appear at
first to be quite different needs. S e r i o u s
doubts remain over whether consumers
will be interested in having to make the
sort of mental effort associated with
computing while also settling down in front
of a sitcom.
“There is a large group of people who
have no interest in the new media and,
contrary to many predictions, that segment
is shrinking slower that the icebergs in
Antarctica,” recently warned Horst Stipp,
director of research at NBC television
network in the United States.
Besides the issue of consumer habits,
infrastructure costs are set to be immense,
and will have to be met by national states or
the private sector before being passed on to
u s e r s. Platforms do not necessarily have to
be expensive. The mobile phone is a good
example of how something that is
technologically sophisticated can almost
be given away, with its cost recovered
through service charges. Users are then
coerced through clever marketing to
upgrade to newer phones with more
features to reinforce their dependence.
The creation and copyright protection
of digital content are other vital issues.We
have already seen that satellite television
provides us with so
many extra channels
that television
programmes have to be
repeated indefinitely to
fill the available space.
But perhaps digital
convergence will solve
this by making it easier
to create totally
synthetic television
programs employing virtual sets and actors.
One might even suggest this has already
started to happen.
Whatever the outcome, it is obvious
that technology will play an increasing part
in our everyday lives. Beyond technology,
digital convergence embraces the services,
industrial practices and social behaviour
that form modern society. We have in our
hands the technology to construct the most
sophisticated machines ever built, but if
they are unusable, simply because of their
operating instructions, then recent lessons
have taught us they will not survive.
Whatever we design must be simple,
reliable and useful. Perhaps this is where
a r t i ficial intelligence will play an important
role. ■
