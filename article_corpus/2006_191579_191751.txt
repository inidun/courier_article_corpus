                       thousands of adolescents dream of becoming sports stars. 
          more and more are deciding to use anabolic steroids to improve their chances. 
                   for 17-year-old taylor hooton, this decision eventually cost him his life.

to be Perfect
aylor Hooton of Texas (USA) was 
a popular boy who played on his 
school baseball team and did well 
in classes. But Taylor felt pressure 
to be even better. 
“When Taylor was 16, his base-
ball coach told him he needed to 
get bigger to move up in the team 
ranks,” his father, Don Hooton, re-
counts. The 6’ 2”, 180-pound young 
man saw only one option. “ 
Taylor started using anabolic ste-
roids in early 2003. His father im-
mediately noticed wild mood swings 
and took him to a psychiatrist. Soon, 
Taylor admitted to steroid use and 
promised to stop. Hooton and his 
wife thought they’d dodged a bullet, 
yet that summer Taylor stole a lap-
top computer. His parents decided 
to not allow him to drive his truck or 
hang out with friends for two weeks 
as a punishment. 
The following morning, Taylor 
begged his mother not to punish 
him. “Taylor came in and had a cou-
ple tears in his eyes,” says Houton. 
“But his mother didn’t budge.” 
“So he reached over and 
squeezed her hand, went upstairs 
and hanged himself.”
Pressure to be the best
Taylor is just one of hundreds of 
thousands of teens who abuse 
steroids. 
Steroids suppress the body’s 
ability to produce testosterone. 
When a user cycles off, it takes 
the body a few months to return to 
normal and severe depression can 
occur. 
There are no exact numbers on 
adolescent suicides related to ste-
roid withdrawal, but Hooton says 
it is not uncommon. “I’ve probably 
talked to two, three dozen par-
ents… the same exact thing that 
happened in our home happened 
to them, it’s usually violent.” 
“We live in a world… [where] it’s 
better to be a winner and to be at-
tractive. These drugs can help you 
in both,” says Dr. Charles Yesalis, 
an authority on teen steroid use at 
Penn State. 
According to , 500,000 to 
600,000 American high schoolers 
have used steroids. “Nobody takes 
500,000 to 600,000 
American high schoolers 
have used steroids, 
says Charles Yesali.

just one shot of steroids, so when I 
say a half a million kids, that means 
those kids have cycled on these 
drugs,” he says. 
The use of drugs to improve per-
formance or body image is a serious 
problem for teens around the 
globe. Frédéric Donzé of the World 
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 
notes that while there are no com-
prehensive international statistics, 
it is a serious problem. “No sport 
and no country are immune.” 
The accessibility of the drugs 
is also alarming. Dr. Lyle Micheli 
of Boston’s Children’s Hospital, 
found that teens obtain steroids at 
gyms. He says there is an under-
ground black market. and finding 
steroids over the internet is even 
easier. 
Many teens know that steroids 
are dangerous. But teens are of-
ten motivated to use them by the 
pressure to excel in sports or to 
look good. “Parents and coaches 
are putting too much pressure on 
young kids -- it’s overwhelming,” 
Yesalis says.
The marathon 
continues
According to a 2003 National 
Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, 
6.1% of young people in grades 
9-12 throughout the United States 
had tried steroids without a doc-
tor’s prescription. Hooton believes 
that education will lead to preven-
tion. “It goes from educating kids 
to know that this is a dangerous 
drug to educating parents like us.” 
But it is not so easy. Profes-
sional baseball players like Jose 
Canseco, Jason Giambi and 
Raphael Plameiro have used ste-
roids. Hooton reflects, “It’s back 
to role models. I don’t care what a 
professional baseball player is do-
ing… unless my 16 year old kid is 
looking up to him. …. [Kids think] 
‘if its ok for them, why isn’t it ok for 
me?’” 
Another pressure source: Ameri-
can universities offer scholar-
ships for sports excellence. Steve 
Abudato, an Emmy award-winning 
anchor in New York, writes 
“bigger, stronger and faster - (it’s) 
a perceived edge that may help 
them secure athletic scholarships 
to college, at the risk of destroying 
their bodies.” 
American schools are starting 
to catch on. New Jersey recently 
implemented high school steroids 
testing program. Proposals for 
such programs are cropping up 
across the United States.
Don Hooton says this is a good 
sign. “It wound up that you had 
this secret stuff going on amongst 
the kids. We know for a fact now, 
five out of the 15 boys on the team 
were doing steroids - it may have 
been as many as nine. As a soci-
ety, nobody seemed to be aware 
that this was going, and that it’s as 
dangerous as it is.”
