The American continent was
inhabited by several thousand
groups of Indians speaking
between 1,500 and 2,000
different languages. These
peoples were dispersed over vast
cultural regions in which there
was a wide variety of ecosystems
and types of social organization.
The situation could scarcely have
been otherwise in this enormous
landmass in the two
hemispheres, stretching 16,000
kilometres from its northern to its
southern extremity, a distance
almost double that which
separates the furthest reaches of
eastern Asia from the Atlantic
seaboard of Europe.
There was no direct contact
between the hunting, fishing and
gathering peoples living in the
frozen wastes of Alaska and the
great plains at one end of the
continent, or between their
counterparts living in Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine pampa at
the other end. However, this
multitude of scattered independent
groups were constantly on the
move. They had spiritual resources
that compensated to a great
extent for the seeming simplicity of
their material culture, and
displayed considerable
technological ingenuity that was
extraordinarily effective in enabling
them to make the most of the
fragile ecosystems in which they
lived.
Clearly, these peoples could
not dominate the vast expanse of
America. Even so, some of them
seem to have been capable of
covering great distances. Some
migrant groups of the Tupi-
Guarani tribes crossed the
thousands of kilometres
separating the Paraná-Paraguay
basin from that of the Amazon.
Migrations and trade were made
easier by the continent's network
of rivers and lakes, which formed
natural highways to which the
road system built by the great
empires was only an adjunct.
However, mastery of space
depended primarily on the
numbers of people and the
dynamism of their societies. At its
peak, the Inca empire extended
between the Pacific and the
Andes for a distance of 4,000
kilometres from north to south.
Some 20 to 25 million people
lived on the central plateau of
Mexico. Between 10 and 12
million people were subjects of
the Inca empire. Perhaps as many
as 6 to 8 million people lived on
the large Caribbean island which
was to become Hispaniola (Haiti
and the Dominican Republic) and
1.5 million Guarani may have
lived in Greater Paraguay. All
told, Indo-America had some 60
to 80 million inhabitants.

at the height of its power

the Dead and the

(300-700 AD).
The cultural fabric of the valley of
Mexico was the product of the
successive peoples which had
settled there from the beginning
of the early Pre-Classical period
around 1800 BC until the time of
the Aztecs.
The first significant sign of
development was the .
construction, in the north-east of
the valley, of the city of
Teotihuacán, which in the early
centuries of the Christian era saw
the emergence of one of the most
remarkable civilizations of Meso-
America. Between 200 and
100 BC, the inhabitants of
Teotihuacán raised the imposing
pyramids of the Sun and the
Moon along the Avenue of the
Dead. Around these austere,
geometric edifices, a great
ceremonial centre and the biggest
Meso-American city of the age
were built.
The people of Teotihuacán
had a calendar and a system of
numbers, and practised a form of
hieroglyphic writing. They made
astronomical observations which
they applied to the orientation of
their monuments and their
system of divination. They
possessed notions of planning,
the organization of urban
settlements, and civil engineering.
They knew the properties and
medicinal uses of many plants.
Their arts, especially architecture,
low-relief sculpture, fresco
painting and ceramics, were
distinguished by a style that was
sober but also highly expressive
and rich in symbolism. They
worshipped Quetzalcóatl, the
plumed serpent, and their
cosmogony had an important
influence on later cultures.
Then came decline. Between
650 and 700, the city seems to
have been looted and
demolished. Around 726, groups
of people from a mysterious place
called Tamoanchán arrived in the
valley, and ceremonies to
celebrate the coming of the Fifth
Sun were held in the sacred city
in 751. This date marked the
beginning of a new historical era,
that of the Toltecs. The Toltec
period, which reached its apogee
between 752 and 1200, was
regarded in later centuries as a
legendary period of peace,
abundance and development of
the arts, crafts and sciences.
After long wanderings from a
region called Aztlan or "place of
herons", the Mexicas (or Aztecs
as they are generally known)
settled on an island on a lake in
the central valley of Mexico. In
1325, on the order of their tribal
divinity, Huitzilopochtli, they
founded what was to become the
powerful city of Tenochtitlán,
whose splendour captivated all
who set eyes on it.
This nomadic tribe mercilessly
extended Its control over the
neighbouring peoples. Its
dominion covered the central and
eastern region of present-day
Mexico, and it established
enclaves on the Gulf of Mexico
and the Pacific Coast. But there
were still pockets of resistance
within this territory, and the
hostility of the peoples who lived
in them, above all those of what
is today the state of Tlaxcala,
would play a decisive role in the
Spanish conquest.
The Aztec empire, or Culhua-
Mexica, was based on a triple
alliance between Tenochtitlán,
Texcoco and Tacuba. At the end
of the fifteenth century it
26

controlled some thirty-eight
provinces extending over almost
half a million square kilometres, a
quarter of the area of modern
Mexico. Nahua was the lingua
franca and the people shared
common religious practices.
Estimates of the population of
central Mexico when the Spanish
arrived have ranged from 4.5
million to 25.2 million. For
Tenochtitlán the figures vary
between 72,000 and 300,000.
The vast empire the Aztecs
governed from their little island
was highly organized. Tribute in
food, clothing and precious
objects from the subject peoples
reached the capital by water
across the lake or over
causeways. Thousands of people
thronged the city's great markets,
where a huge variety of products
could be found. The right to own
property was guaranteed, and
priests and warriors occupied
privileged positions within the
castes. Everything that had been
created by the people of
Teotihuacán and the Toltecs was
taken to a high degree of
development by the Aztecs:
calendar systems and
astronomical calculations,
techniques of civil engineering
and urban planning, education,
the preparation and interpretation
of historical books and rituals,
cosmology and religion, methods
of divination, arts and crafts.
However, Aztec society at every
level was permeated by a
messianic religion which provided
a pretext for imperial conquest
and a justification for human
sacrifices, which were deemed
necessary to nourish the life of
the Sun through blood.

The Mayan Empire: city-states in decline
The Mayan world was at the
height of its power during the
Classic period, between 250 and
900 AD, when cities such as
Yaxchilán, Bonampak and
Palenque were built in Chiapas,
Quiriguá and Copan in Honduras,
and Piedras Negras in Guatemala.
These cities were remarkable for
their architecture, low-relief
sculptures, frescoes, ceramics,
steles and altars. During the
same period, astronomy,
mathematics, calendrical
calculations and a system of
hieroglyphic writing also
developed. Political power was
exercised by a priestly caste.
Around the middle of the ninth
century, for reasons still not fully
understood, perhaps connected
with the exhaustion of the land
and the outbreak of armed
conflict, these centres of
habitation and ceremony were
abandoned. During the same
period, Toltec influence began to
be felt, the cult of Quetzalcóatl
appeared and, at the beginning of
the eleventh century, the new
cities of Chichén Itzá, Uxmal and
Kabah were built. The Mayapán
League was created and brought
together the forces of the city of
that name and those of Chichén
Itzá and Uxmal.
Mayan culture declined
between 1200 and 1517. Once
the League was dissolved, around
1450, the major population
centres were transformed into
minor states, and human sacrifice
became a very common practice.
The arrival of the Spaniards
marked the end of a brief period
of cultural splendour.
In the classical and post-
classical periods, the big cities
were a model of sumptuous and
harmonious design, with palaces,
temples, courts for ball games,
observatories, baths, archways
and tombs.
The most outstanding
expression of Mayan sculpture
was in low-relief, notably on steles
where it was used to depict
divinities, human beings and
minutely rendered columns of
glyphs. The most successful
example of the art of fresco from
the point of view of composition
and design is at Bonampak,
where battles, processions and
prisoners are depicted.

The Inca realm of the four parts
In 1492 Túpac Inca Yupanqui
(1471-1493), the tenth emperor
of the dynasty, had ruled for
twenty years the "realm of the
four parts", Tahuantinsuyo, which
covered almost 900,000 square
kilometres.
Strictly speaking the Inca
state was not so much an empire
as an assemblage of highly
diverse regions and peoples, in
many cases jealous of their
autonomy yet united by strong

political and economic links
maintained by a state apparatus
whose seat was at Cuzco in the
south of present-day Peru.
Yupanqui had succeeded to the
throne on the abdication of his
father Pachacútec. He wore the
mascapaicha (a scarlet headband
which was the insignia of his
supreme power) and his authority
was virtually absolute.
However, Inca absolutism was
more apparent than real. The Inca
was at the head of a complex
centralized administration. A large
corps of officials travelled
endlessly through the subject
territories, keeping an eye on
affairs, carrying out censuses,
making sure that work exacted as
tribute was carried out, and
maintaining social order. All the
threads of this vast web led back
to the political and symbolic
centre of the state at Cuzco, a
splendid city with vast squares
and imposing buildings, palaces
and temples. The dozens of
settlements and fortresses
scattered through the realm were
remarkable for the purity of their
architecture and rigorous ground-
plan and for the quality of their
masonry.
However, the power of the
Incas was very recent. In less
than two centuries it had been
imposed on over eight million
people.
To maintain the cohesion of
this immense conglomeration, the
emperor had four main
resources. The subject peoples
were obliged to use a common
language, Quechua. Some of the
inhabitants of potentially
troublesome regions were
deported to areas where Inca
influence was strong, and
replaced by more docile people,
who helped to promote integration
in this mosaic of cultures and
peoples. A gigantic network of
roads, estimated at almost
20,000 kilometres, covered the
entire country. These carefully
maintained Inca ñan (Inca roads),
which ran in a straight line,
crossed mountains and canyons
by means of liana bridges or
staircases (the wheel was
unknown). Travelled by chasqui
(relay runners) who could spend
the night at the tampos (shelters
and storehouses), located at
intervals along them, they were
the ubiquitous symbol of Inca
authority. The cult of the Sun Inti,
the tribal god of the Incas,
became the state religion.
In 1492, the reign of Tupac
Yupanqui was drawing to a close.
He was assassinated in the
following year and one of his
sons, Huayna Cápac, succeeded
him and began a troubled reign
(1493-1527). His rule was
marked by new conquests and by
the struggle of his sons Huáscar
and Atahualpa, between whom he
unwisely divided the empire,
which collapsed in 1532, five
years after his death. The
Spanish were the main architects
of this collapse, but the empire
bore within it the seeds of its own
destruction.
