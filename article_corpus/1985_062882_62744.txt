A letter of credit drawn
on the past
by Piero Baruca
POLITICAL and cultural institu¬
tions, as well as industrial enter¬
prises and banks often feel the need
to look back to their origins, perhaps in
order to find in their past history the
dynamism they need to overcome the dif¬
ficulties of the present. This may account
for the current widespread interest in
business archives, which contain documen¬
tary evidence of the activities of a business
enterprise since its foundation. Such ar¬
chives can help a business to become aware
of roots which although ancient are still im¬
portant to it.
The Monte dei Paschi bank of Siena is an
example of this phenomenon. One of Italy's
leading credit establishments and the head
of a major financial group of five banks,
the Monte dei Paschi has had an eventful
history that stretches back for five cen¬
turies, and is scrupulously recorded in its ar¬
chives which cover the period from 1568 to
1872.
Today preserved in the Palazzo della
Roca Salimbeni in Siena, right next door to
the headquarters of the bank, this major
deposit occupies over 330 metres of shelf
space. Also exhibited in the great salon of
the Palazzo are precious objects connected
with the life of the bank, ranging from seals
(the oldest dating back to the 16th century),
letters of credit some of which were drawn
up in the 17th century, and old letters of ex¬
change. Most of the post-1872 documents
are preserved in other premises of the bank.
Strangely enough, any account of the
Monte dei Paschi archives must begin with
documents which are preserved elsewhere,
not because they have been scattered or
destroyed, but because of the special cir¬
cumstances attending the bank's creation.
Founded in 1472 on the initiative of the Free
Republic of Siena, it was considered initial¬
ly as an institution of the State, and its ac¬
tivities were strictly regulated. Consequent¬
ly bank documents dating from the period
of Siena's political autonomy until 1555
were treated on a par with official
municipal documents and later deposited
with them in the local public record office.
The public nature of the bank when it was
founded and during the early years of its ac¬
tivity was confirmed when Siena lost its in¬
dependence, and the Medicis of Florence
recognized the bank's special status. Since
then the bank has been closely involved in
the country's social and economic life.
The activities of the period following the
reform in status of 1568, whereby the bank
obtained administrative autonomy, are ful¬
ly recorded in the documents preserved in
its archives which run without a break from
1568 to the present and were enriched with
the addition to the bank of a savings bank,
founded in 1833, and a building finance
house.
With the unification of Italy, one result
of which was to extend the bank's field of
activity, a process of internal and external
reorganization began. After the deposit of
its statutes in 1872, its structure was
modified and it was divided into several
autonomous enterprises.
Today the historic archives of the Monte
dei Paschi have become an important in¬
stitution devoted to organizing a mass of
documentary material which is of in¬
estimable value as a source of information
for scholarly research into Italian economic
history and whose quantity and diversity
are constantly growing.
PIERO BARUCCI, of Italy, has been presi¬
dent of the Monte dei Paschi bank and finance
house, Siena, since 1983. He formerly taught
economics at the universities of Siena and
Florence. A member of the American
Economic Association and the Royal
Economic Association of the UK, he is the
author of many published works on economic
questions.
