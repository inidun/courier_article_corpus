The growth
of the Hispanic
book market
SOME 145 million people live in
the Spanish-speaking cultural
area of the world, where pros¬
pects of an expanding book market
are today limited by problems of
economic development which vary
from country to country.
Spain was the chief book supplier
to Latin America until 1936, the year
of the Spanish Civil War. The
interruption of its book printing pro¬
duced an overnight growth of publish¬
ing houses in the New World, mainly
in Mexico and Argentina. After the
Second World War this became a
book production boom. More recently,
inflation has become widespread on
the Latin American continent and
foreign currency restrictions have
been introduced, thus limiting the pur¬
chase of paper, ink, machinery and
other supplies and restricting pay¬
ments for copyright in the case of
translations. With the situation thus
reversed, the sales of books produced
in Spain are regaining their former
importance in Latin America.
Book exports from Spain to this
vast region totalled five million, pese¬
tas in 1940; in 1963 they reached an
all-time high of 1,348 million pesetas.
Over the past three years, Spanish
book exports to Latin America have
doubled. Spain's book production has
increased 30% in the past five years
and Latin America has taken 40% of
these books.
In 1963, Spain's 743 publishing
houses put on sale 8,694 original
titles. These can be classed, with
approximate figures, as follows: Liter¬
ature, 2,800; social sciences, 1,800;
applied sciences, 1,100; theology and
religion, 1,000; history and geography,
700; fine arts, 500; pure sciences,
350; philology, 200; philosophy, 180;
general subjects, 160.
About 14% of all books printed
in Spain were translations of foreign
works. In 1963, 694 titles were trans¬
lated from English, 593 from French,
320 from German, 1 1 1 from Italian
and 180 from other languages.
In Argentina, the really striking
development in book publishing has
come during the past thirty years. In
1936 its entire production consisted
of 451 scientific and 372 literary
works; by 1963, production had risen
to 3,390 titles, and of these, 2,196
were chiefly made up of novels and
short stories, geography books, school
textbooks and dictionaries. In 1963
Argentina printed over 29 million
books.
Argentina's book production (in
terms of wholesale prices) has been
estimated at 4 000 million pesos a year
between 1960-1962. In 1963, Argentina
exported nearly seven million copies
of books and other publications. This
figure excludes orders despatched by
air.
Argentina and Mexico are Spain's
two chief competitors in the Latin
American market. In Mexico, book
production and sales have gone
through a similar kind of process to
that in Argentina. Mexico's annual
production was less than 1,000 books
between 1948 and 1955, but in 1962
it produced 3,760. Eustasio Garcia,
the Argentinian publisher, has estimat¬
ed that there are some 10,000 book¬
shops in Latin America, 900 of which
are located in Mexico.
The official production and free dis¬
tribution of primary school textbooks
in Mexico in recent years deserves
special mention. Since 1959, when
the national plan of Mexico's Educa¬
tion Minister, Jaime Torres Bodet (a
former Director-General of Unesco)
went into operation, over 100 million
textbooks have been distributed free
of charge to schoolchildren. This
year 21 million will be distributed.
Brazil occupies a unique place in
Latin America since, for linguistic
reasons, it does not export its books
to the rest of the continent, yet
appears to have top place among book
producers. Latest official statistics
relate to 1959 when a total of 5,337
titles was published. After Argentina
and Mexico in second and third pla¬
ces comes Chile which published 1,040
works in 1962. It is followed by Peru
and Cuba with 791 and 736 titles
respectively in 1963.
In Cuba, efforts to provide books
for all sections of the population are
made by different organizations. The
"Editorial Nacional de Cuba'', set up
by the government in May 1962 and
directed by the Cuban novelist, Alejo
Carpentier, prints national and foreign
works, on an average basis of 20,000
copies per title, but in some cases
reaching the 50,000 and 100,000 mark.
This national enterprise published
16,500,000 copies in 1963 and plans
to reach 22 million this year.
