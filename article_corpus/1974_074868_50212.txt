It was in such ships that
the Vikings sailed the

Mediterranean and cross¬

America. It was the
custom to bury a Viking
chieftain in his drakkar,

mound in Norway.
HE discovery and settle¬

great expansion of the Nordic peoples
during the age that takes its name from
the Scandinavian Vikings. In their
swift and sturdy ships the Vikings
sailed across the sea, sweeping like

wildfire over islands and coasts, and
founding independent Viking states in
Scotland, Ireland and England in the
west, in France in the south, in Russia
in the east.
Though some of their states, such
as Normandy in France and Holmgard,
the old Norse name for the city-state
of Novgorod in Russia, became power¬
ful, the small ruling element was gra¬
dually absorbed by the native mass,
losing both language and national iden¬
tity. The only places where this did
not happen were previously uninhabit¬
ed lands occupied by the Vikings. Ice¬
land was the only permanent state
founded by the Vikings during this
period.
Ari Thorgilsson the Learned (1067-
1148) the first Icelandic author, who
wrote a brief history of Iceland
Islendingabók (The Book of the Ice¬
landers) says that the first settler
made his home there "a few years"
after 870 while another ancient source
tells us that this happened in 874.
Thousands of settlers crossed the
stormy seas in open vessels; men
with their wives and children and other
kinsfolk, housecarls (bodyguards of
kings and nobles) and thralls (serfs).
With them they took clothes and pro¬
visions, utensils and domestic equip¬
ment as well as animals.
During the Age of Settlement (9th
to 10th century) the climate of Ice-

land must have been relatively mild.
There was an abundance of fish in
the rivers and lakes and coastal waters
of the island. The lowlands were
covered with rich pasture and birch-
woods that reached high up the slopes
of the mountains.
Some of the newcomers described
the new country as a fishing-station,
while one declared that every blade
of grass dripped butter. However, it
was soon found that there were two
sides to the picture and the Icelandic
weather could be unaccountable.
One of the earliest would-be settlers
lost all his livestock in the rigours of
the first winter, and went back to his
homeland. Before leaving he climbed
a high mountain and saw a fjord filled
with drift-ice, whereupon he gave the
country Its chilly name.
From the start the people. that settled
the new land had a distinctive culture
and customs of their own. This may
be due to the particular sample of
Norwegians that migrated there, and
especially to the slight admixture of
Celtic stock among the settlers from
the Celtic parts of the British Isles,
including the islands of the Hebrides,
Orkneys and Shetlands. Many of the
thralls who later mixed with the free-
born immigrants were also of Celtic
origin.
Towards the close of the Age of
Settlement, about the year 930, the
Icelanders combined to establish a
common state and general assembly
the Althing for their land. The coun¬
try was divided Into four Ouarters, and
each of these into nine godord, or
chieftaincies, except the Northern
Quarter, In which there were twelve.
The chieftains in charge of the
heathen sacrifical rites were called
godar, and these were also the leaders
of this miniature state. In early spring
a district assembly would be held in
the territory of every three chief¬
taincies.
Though the Icelandic laws were
based on the Norwegian ones of the
settlers' native districts, these were
considerably supplemented and amend¬
ed. They are preserved complete in
two vellum books dating from about
the time when the Icelandic national
state came to an end in the latter part
of the 13th century.
At the Althing, as might be sup¬
posed, the godar were supreme. They
were self-appointed members of the
legislature (logrétta), the court that
amended old laws, drafted new ones
and gave judgement on points of law.
To ensure its efficient and impartial
operation, however, every godi had
two advisers, one sitting behind him
and one before.
The judicial courts of the Althing
were four in number, one for each
Quarter. The godar nominated a man
each in every Quarter Court, thus
giving them effective control, though
the interests of parties to a dispute
were safeguarded by their right to
object to any member of the court on
grounds of unsuitability for his office.
Many features of the Icelandic Con¬
stitution were unique, beside being
more democratic than in neighbouring
lands. There was no king to oppress
his subjects with tyrannical commands.
The power was equally divided
between thirty-nine farmer-chieftains,
among whose tasks was the duty of
protecting the interests of their own
people, each In his own district.
The legislative and judicial powers
were completely separate and allotted
to Independent bodies. In criminal
cases juries were very much used as
evidence of character, the members
giving their verdict according to con¬
science. At a fairly early date a Fifth
Court was introduced as a kind of
supreme court of appeal for the whole
country.
In the early centuries after the
settlement the inhabitants possessed
a large and effective fleet of ships,
and the wanderlust that had driven
their forefathers to Iceland was still
in their blood. From here they voyaged
further westwards in search of new
lands. Eirik the Red, a man from the
west of Iceland, discovered a large
country which he named Greenland
"and said that it would urge men to
go there, that the land had a good
name", observes Ari the Learned.
During the next few years many
emigrated from Iceland to Greenland,
establishing there a settlement that
flourished at the start. From Green¬
land It was not far to the North Am¬
erican continent, and the sea-dogs of
Greenland soon had a glimpse of yet
other lands to the southwest.

Leif the Lucky, son of Eirik the
Red, set out to find these lands
about the year 1000, discovering
three, to which he gave the names
Helluland ("flagstone-land"), Markland
("forest-land") and Vinland ("wine-
land"). Helluland and Markland were
probably Baffinland and the Labrador
peninsula. Vinland could have been
Newfoundland, on whose northern¬
most promontory very ancient Norse
remains have recently been dis¬
covered.
