l e u m .S w i m m e rs complain about the proli-
feration of jellyfish that float around in the deep
blue sea. Scientists observe and measure pollution,
and explain that they do not know how long the
ocean can stand such stress. D e f e n d e rs of the
environment shout themselves hoarse:“The sea
is not a garbage can! Stop the damage.”
Each ye a r , three to four million tonnes of
petroleum end up in the sea. The “black tides”

the gr e ater danger comes from the thousands of
tonnes discharged into the wakes of ships.
“Accidents such as those of the To rrey Canyo n
(1967) or the Amoco Cadiz (1978) are impressi-
ve ,” recalls Ray Gri f f i t h s , f o rmerly in charge of
the Marine Pollution Programme of UNESCO’s
I n t e r g ove rnmental Oceanographic Commission
( I O C ) , “ but the marine environment is the vic-
tim of silent abu s e , with heavier consequences in
the long ru n , from the tanker degassing and
waste oils from tank washing at sea.”
The shipowners’ lack of scruples is, howe-
ver, responsible for only 25 per cent of marine
pollution by hydrocarbons. According to Tony
Knap of the Bermuda Biological Station for
Research, this proportion is even declining. Tar
concentrations in the open ocean are decrea-
sing as the techniques for transporting and
handling petroleum products improve. On the
other hand, 60 per cent of this type of pollution
is of land-based origin, essentially due to the
discharge of used motor oil through urban
sewer systems. The remaining 15 per cent
comes from offshore oil-plat f o rms for the
extraction of natural gas and petroleum.
F r a n c e ’s Research Institute for the
Exploitation of the Sea, Ifremer, has drawn
attention to another danger: the ever increasing
shipment of toxic products, explosives and
industrial and nuclear wastes by sea. The sea
continues to wash ashore barrels and contai-
ners from cargo vessels.
Stowaway bacteria
Worse still, all kinds of “clandestine passen-
gers” are shipped, in spite of themselves, from
one end of the planet to the other: these are the
bacteria, viruses and other organisms in sea
water taken on board with ballast water. On
arrival, this water is discharged without treat-
ment or filtration. Consequently more than
3,000 species of animals and plants are trans-
ported each day. According to James Baker, the
Administrator of the United States National
Oceanic and A t m o s p h e ric A d m i n i s t r at i o n
(NOAA), 80 million tonnes of “foreign” water
are thus discharged into A m e ri c a ’s coastal
waters each year. In the San Francisco area, he
says, 212 exoteric species have been identified.
The Mediterranean has also received a hun-

dred or so new wild species in the last few
years, of which the most famous is the “killer
alga” (Caulerpa taxifolia), said to have been
released from the aquaria of the
Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. These
intruder species may be responsible for the
disappearance of some native fauna or flora
and for the disturbance of local ecosystems.
The consequences of increasing mari t i m e
shipping are thus ve ry va ried and sometimes
u n e x p e c t e d .Ye t , just as for hydrocarbon pollu-
t i o n , shipping is not the only factor responsible.
In fa c t , it accounts for only 10 per cent of all
m a rine pollution. More than three-quart e rs of
m a rine pollutants ori gi n ate on land. They get
into the sea by run-off directly from the land or
via ri ve rs. They can also get there by direct
discharge or via the at m o s p h e r e , G riffiths adds.
The main reasons are the lack of sewerage infra-
s t ru c t u r e , i n t e n s i ve agriculture and industry.
About 70 per cent of wastes discharged into the
Pa c i fic receive no form of prior treat m e n t ,
according to the UN Env i r o n m e n t
P r o gr a m m e ’s (UNEP) 1997 report on The Stat e
of the Env i r o n m e n t. And according to a UNEP
r e p o rt on the Mediterr a n e a n , 1.7 billion cubic
metres of municipal waste water are discharged
d i r e c t l y, of which three-quart e rs is untreat e d .
The North and the South are in the same
boat, the developing countries being increasin-
gly handicapped by the strong populat i o n
increase, lack of financial means and expertise,
all of which prevent them from putting a stop
to the problem. In France, for example, the
water consumed by one third of the population
is still not purified. In Egypt, Alexandria Bay is
being asphyxiated, essentially by the discharge
of sewage, to the extent that some places, such
as the roadstead of Aboukir, are considered to
be biologically dead.
The application of pesticides, herbicides and
other poisons in intensive agriculture allows one
p a rt of the planet’s inhabitants to have affor-
dable food, but depri ves eve rybody of cert a i n
m a rine delicacies. The excess of these chemical
products is washed off the land into ri ve rs and
hence into the sea and “ m ay affect the gr ow t h
and development of marine organisms, n o t a b l y

e x p l a i n s. “They may also modify the stru c t u r e
of phytoplankton communities and disturb
p h o t o s y n t h e s i s ” .Wo rse still, the phosphates and
n i t r ates in chemical fert i l i z e rs , which also indi-
rectly enter the sea, p r ovoke “red tides”, m a s s i-
ve outbreaks of unicellular algae. “The tox i n s
they contain progress up the food chain into the
bodies of the top predat o rs , such as the big
fishes in the same area” which is not without
danger to those who eat them. “These  red tides
can also use up the oxygen dissolved in the
wat e r ” to the point of asphy x i ating local fa u n a .
The winds transport many agricultural pollu-
tants over thousands of kilometres, e ven as fa r
as the Antarctic and the A r c t i c. A b n o rm a l l y
high amounts of these chemicals have been
found in the bodies of Inuits, who are major
c o n s u m e rs of marine animal fat s , in the A r c t i c,
and also in the A n t a r c t i c ’s Adélie penguins.
Choked waters
The Baltic Sea is asphyxiated by industrial pol-
lution, with paper-pulp producers discharging
annually 200,000 tonnes of chlorinated pro-
ducts and mercury. E ve ry w h e r e , i n d u s t ri e s
dump their effluents into bodies of water and
their gases into the atmosphere. For example,
66 billion cubic metres of industrial wastes are
discharged annually into the Mediterranean.
The ocean absorbs enormous quantities of
mineral oils, detergents, phosphates, and heavy
metals, including cadmium, lead, copper, zinc
from metallurgical processes, and mercury,
also in connexion with mining.
O ve r a l l , about a third of at m o s p h e ric pollu-
tants directly fall into the sea or with rainfa l l .O f
the seven billion tonnes of carbon dioxide pro-
duced annually by human activity, the ocean
r e c e i ves at least two billion. We know that the
ocean is a formidable recycling machine for
gases naturally present in the at m o s p h e r e , bu t
h ow far will it be able to stand the extra load
t h at we are expecting it to bear? Scientists wo n-
der whether it will be able to adapt to the global
wa rming induced by the greenhouse gases pro-
duced by human activities, without disturbing
its equilibrium and its circulat i o n .
In eve ry corner of the planet, e x p e rt s ,
United Nations agencies and non-governmen-
tal organizations are waving the red flag. The
Mediterranean is in danger of “undergoing the
same evolution as that of the Black Sea, whose
water contains no dissolved oxygen below a
depth of 150 to 200 metres, which limits the
available living space for marine organisms,
and especially of slow-growing demersal fish
species,” UNEP warns. Phytoplankton stocks
have fallen by 80 per cent since 1951 along the
coast of California, probably due to global war-
ming, according to the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography. Biodiversity is declining, but it
seems we do not know enough to act. ■
