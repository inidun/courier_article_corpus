here are many diseases that cannot spread unless
m . carried by insects. They are among the most
ancient afflictions of mankind, and have played their part
in shaping his history. Malaria has influenced the rise
and fall of civilizations, epidemics of plague and of yellow
fever have again and again decimated populations in the
old and the new worlds, while outbreaks of louse-borne
typhus have often determined the outcome of military
campaigns. Sleeping sickness and a less well-known
.disease, onchocerciasis, have held back progress in Africa.
These and a score of other diseases carried by flying
and crawling insects have enfeebled whole sections of the
human race, depopulated fertile food-producing tracts,
and held down man's levels of living particularly in the
tropics but also in temperate climates. Despite the strides
that have been made in our own day towards the control
of many of these scourges, there is scarcely one which
does not still represent an actual or potential danger to
large numbers of human beings.
Most of these diseases have been known and feared
for centuries, but it was not until about 60 years ago that
scientists began to suspect the part played by insects as
carriers. It was only in the early years of the present
century that painstaking research established with certainty
the action of many different species of insects such as
mosquitoes, tsetse flies, sandflies, fleas, lice, as well as
of ticks and mites in transmitting many pestilences.
In the first flush of enthusiasm following these discoveries
it was thought that, once the carrier was known, any disease
would be virtually conquered. Indeed, in a relatively short
time yellow fever was banished from most of the cities
of the Americas, the incidence of malaria was reduced
particularly in the towns and in the more temperate zones,
and certain other diseases were successfully attacked.
Rapid progress, however, became possible only after
the discovery during the last war of the "residual"
insecticides, of which the best known is (Cont'd on
probably DDT. The special character of these .
chemicals is that they remain deadly for periods

(Continued from previous page)
ranging up to several months after application One
of their first triumphs was to strangle the threat of
typhus epidemics during and after the war. Next,
they proved amazingly effective when correctly used
to control malaria, even in the sparsely-settled rural
districts. There is scarcely an insect-borne disease
against which these new chemicals are not being
used today with greater or less effect.
But again disappointment has followed too opti¬
mistic hopes. First the common housefly, and now
some mosquitoes as well as lice, cockroaches and
bed-bugs in certain areas, have shown that, after a
few years of exposure to the action of these killers,
they can develop resistance which protects them from
fatal effects. In the case of the housefly this hap¬
pens rather quickly, and these chemicals have there¬
fore become of little value. With the mosquito,
however, the insecticide can be used effectively for
several years, during which period an all-out cam¬
paign is able to eradicate diseases like malaria so that,
if the mosquitoes should, in time, develop resistance,
there is no malaria left for them to carry.
Another and very serious difficulty is that many
insect-borne diseases appear to exist more or less
permanently among wild animals which thus provide
a reservoir of infection that may suddenly spread to
start epidemics among domestic animals and humans.
Yellow fever is known to be firmly entrenched in
the jungles among monkeys and other animals ;
plague smoulders in many places among wild rodents
whence it can easily spread to the rats that live with
men ; the trypanosome that causes sleeping sickness
exists permanently in wild game in Africa and is
carried to men and cattle by the tsetse fly. There
are many other examples among diseases caused by
viruses and "rickettsiae".
It would be a serious mistake to underestimate
these ancient enemies of mankind. It is already
clear that the residual insecticides, powerful weapons
though they be, do not provide the final answer
to the disease-carrying insect. Nor is there at present
any prospect of eradicating those diseases that have
become permanently established among the domestic
and wild animals. There they remain, a constant
threat calling for constant watchfulness.
World Health Day on April 7, this year will,
I hope, serve to make people everywhere realize that,
although the insect-borne diseases are being increas¬
ingly held in check, they are not yet conquered. To
achieve that final victory man will need all his intel¬
ligence and resourcefulness. Above all, he will need
to act in concert, for this group of diseases is one of
the greatest challenges to international health action.

WORLD NOW HAS
1,200,000 DOCTORS
There are now 1,200,000 physicians in the world according
to a recent survey of the World Health Organization;
which also reveals that between 50,000 and 60,000 new
doctors graduate each year from some b00 medical schools in
85 countries. The WHO report points out that this is not enough
in view of the world's health needs and the inequality of dis¬
tribution of doctors in different countries.
There are only 14 countries, it states, fortunate enough to
have one doctor to serve every thousand inhabitants or less.
But there are 22 countries where only one doctor is available
for 20,000 people or even more. Between these two extremes,
the figures vary greatly for the rest of the 124 countries and
territories which make up today's world. In addition, the
report adds, many doctors are engaged in teaching, research,
administration and other duties which are not directly concern¬
ed with the care of patients, and this must be taken into
account when looking at the statistics. The report also
confirms previous findings that rural areas are under-manned
while cities often have too many medical practitioners.
The WHO study underlines the "definite, immediate need for
planning the construction of medical schools" in many parts
of the world. It shows that while nine countries have one
medical school for less than one million of population, there
are 13 countries with only one medical school for 9 to 17 million
people. Distribution of doctors and medical schools by continent
is shown below.
