Japan: v o y e u r i s t i c g a m e s
Gadgets and “electronic leashes” are the rage in Tokyo where people
don’t just spy on their neighbours but on the latest star in vogue

A
k i h a b a r a ,To k y o ’s electronics retail dis-
t r i c t ,has been bustling since 1998,w h e n
the new economy really took off in
Ja p a n .“New computers and cell phones
with Internet access are the best-sel-
ling products,” says Toshihiro Miyazaki, a salesman
at Laox, a huge mass-consumer temple devoted to
e l e c t r o n i c s.
But another section of the store is also packed:
the one selling gadgets for spying on spouses,n e i g h-
bours and co-workers—miniature digital cameras
with pictures that can be viewed from a distance,
m i c r o - c h i p s, miniature recorders and electronic
“ l e a s h e s ” so small they are almost invisible.R e s e a r-
chers and engineers in the laboratories of Sony,
Sharp, Panasonic and others are busy developing

more and more miniaturized devices. Prices range
from 30,000 yen ($255) to
200,000 yen ($1,700), and sales
at Laox have been rising since
1999.These items are especially
popular with 15 to 25 year-olds
(the s e d a i video-game genera-
tion) and with o t a k u (children of
the virtual empire). O t h e r s,
known as the camera kozô , get
their share of fun from snapping
embarrassing pictures with
remote-controlled miniature
cameras.
In Ja p a n , a society influ e n c e d
by Confuciansim, control over
the self and others has always
been the norm. The neighbou-
rhood police station (k o b a n) and
foot patrolmen still frequently
draw up detailed lists of local
residents and inquire about the
identity of newcomers as soon
as they move in.N e i g h b o u r h o o d
committees (t o n a r i g u m i) , an ins-
titution dating back to the 16th
c e n t u r y, were used during the
Second World War to punish acti-
vities deemed anti-Ja p a n e s e.
Although the committees are on
the wane, they still exist.
To d a y, these traditional ways of watching people
seem harmless compared to the spying being done
with new electronic products. There are regular
reports on television about acts of voyeurism. S o m e
people specialize in spying on public toilets, while
others hide cameras and microphones in the homes
of friends or young, single women. Others have
turned into Internet paparazzi, broadcasting their
s t e a l t h y pictures on the We b. R e c e n t l y, the marathon
runner Naoko Takahashi, who has become a star
since bringing home a gold medal from the Sydney
O l y m p i c s, found that her fame had stretched beyond
acceptable limits. Thousands of copies of a video
featuring her naked in her bathroom have been ille-
gally sold.A miniature camera filmed the pictures
without her knowledge.
The Japanese are increasingly concerned about
the rising number of abuses. In Ja n u a r y, a high school
teacher was arrested for filming his students changing
in the locker room, and a cameraman from the
national NHK television network filmed people at
home without their knowing it.Debate is stepping
up over an inexpensive service called Imadoko
(“where are you?”),which allows parents to track
their children’s every move. A microchip built into
a cell phone tells the company where the user is at
all times.At the parents’ request, the company sends
them a map showing their child’s exact wherea-
bouts.
The Japanese feel even more anxious because
the government has recently passed a law streng-
thening the powers of the central police authorities
( N PA) and the justice ministry to use spying tools
such as phone taps and email screening.“ This law
is designed to help criminal investigations, not to
interfere in people’s daily lives,” the NPA says.
But some specialists, such as Shin Mizukoshi, a
media expert at Tokyo University, are asking
uneasy questions:“Has Big Brother broken into
our homes? Isn’t police interception of commu-
nications a new invasion of privacy?”
These methods are mainly used to combat com-
puter piracy. A law “forbidding illegal access”has
just come into force — it punishes computer crimes
with a year’s imprisonment and a 500,000-yen fine
($5,000).Eighty engineer-police officers stalk cri-
minals at the NPA’s High-Tech Crime Te c h n i c a l
Expert Center, a cyber-surveillance centre with an
annual budget of 190 million yen ($1.85 million).
But trouble-makers are also honing their elec-
tronics skills. Recently, a pair of kidnappers used
prepaid phones to announce their ransom
demands and conditions. “The omnipresence of
advanced mobile communication systems creates
new challenges,” says an NPA official.“Compro-
mises are necessary in the interest of the public
and its security.” As legal expert Yoichi Higuchi
o b s e r v e s, the right to privacy may remain “ v i r t u a l ”
in Japan. ■
