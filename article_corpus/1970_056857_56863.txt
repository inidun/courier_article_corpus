THE EAGLE
'spacecraft' of the
pre-scientific age
by José
Patrocinio de Souza
JOSE PATROCINIO DE SOUZA, Indian
historian and writer, is head of the Depart¬
ment of History at Elphinstone College,
Bombay, the oldest university college in
western India. Professor de Souza has made
a special study of the origins, migration
and meaning of symbols, particularly the uni¬
versal symbols of the eagle and the serpent.
He is preparing two books in this field: "The
Symbol of the Double-Headed Eagle: Its
Origin, Diffusion and Significance" and "The
Eagle and the Serpent: A Study in Sym¬
bolism. "
w
HOEVER conceived the
idea of naming the Lunar Module which
landed the first men on the moon, the
"Eagle", displayed, consciously or un¬
consciously, a remarkable sense of
history. For, man being carried into
outer space by an eagle, or man
ascending to the astral regions in the
form of an eagle, was a widespread
human fancy in the pre-scientific age.
It is true that the Athenian comic
dramatist, Aristophanes, caricatured
the belief in his play Peace, by send¬
ing his hero up on the back of a dung-
beetle. Aristophanes notwithstanding,
the eagle fancy persisted, giving
rise to a succession of myths and to
works of art illustrating them.
This flight of early man into space
was, of course, a flight of his imagina¬
tion. But the spacecraft "Eagle" has
transformed myth into reality and made
the ancient dream come true, thus
linking two principal epochs in the
history of man the Age of Faith and
the Age of Science. And, whether
real or imaginary, the object of man's
flight into space has been funda¬
mentally the same throughout history.
"Man was voyaging to the planets,"
says Norman Mailer in his forthcoming
book A Fire on the Moon, "in order to
look for God. Or was it to destroy
Him?"
But why did the ancients imagine
that the eagle would be able to carry
man into outer space? To the people,
who lived, worked and had their being
in and through symbols, the eagle was
the sky-bird par excellence. Dwelling
at inaccessible heights and soaring
higher, perhaps, than any other bird,
the eagle was flying, so it seemed
to their lively imagination, towards the
sun and merging itself with the sky.
It thus became to them a fit attribute
and vehicle of their sky and solar

deities, such as Zeus of the Greeks,
Jupiter of the Romans and Vishnu of
the Hindus.
The eagle as the symbol of the sky
is graphically represented on a Sas¬
sanian carved silver plate now pre¬
served In the Hermitage Museum,
Leningrad. A spread eagle is depicted
as holding by the hips a nude woman
with pomegranate breasts. In her
right hand she holds aloft a plate
of fruit, apparently pomegranates.
Scholars have identified this figure
with the old Iranian fertility goddess,
Anahit.
But Anahit also had a specific astral
significance: she was the personi¬
fication of the planet Venus, the
morning star. The motif may thus be
taken to represent the sky in the form
of an eagle "presenting its loveliest
planet." Although the design belongs
to Sassanian times, the conception of
the sky-bird synthetized with an
anthropomorphic astral deity dates
back to the second, or more probably,
the third millennium B.C.
Moving, as it seemed to the ancients,
between earth and heaven, the most
majestic of birds was conceived by
them as carrying kings and heroes
from earth to heaven, or as being sent
down to earth by the gods to take up
their favourites thither. The mytholo¬
gies of many nations are rich in
stories of high-ranking personages
being transported to the astral regions
by the eagle.
The oldest, perhaps, of these myths
is the ' much-travelled tale of the
Mesopotamian hero, Etana who was
the first man to go "where eagles
dare." According to the early
Sumerian chronology, this prototype
of the modern astronauts was the
thirteenth king of the First Dynasty of
Kish after the Great Flood.
Etana's flight into outer space,
clinging to the pinions of an eagle, is
the theme of the Legend of Etana, a
fascinating poem in cuneiform, which
has survived in a later copy, fragments
of which were recovered on some clay
tablets from the library of the Assyrian
monarch, Assurbanipal. They were
first published by George Smith in
his remarkable book, The Chaldean
Genesis, and added to later by other
scholars.
The occasion for Etana's flight into
space was his quest for "the plant of
childbirth," which would cure his wife
of her barrenness. Etana had been
looking high and low for this
miraculous herb, but in vain, so he
appealed to Shamash, the Sun-god, to
help him find It.
The god directed him to a certain
eagle, which Etana found lying in a pit
badly bruised in a fight with a serpent,
its traditional cosmic antagonist.
Etana tended the wounded bird with
all the care he could bestow on it.
Thanks to his ministrations, the bird's
wounds were healed and it regained
its strength. Out of gratitude to the
king, the eagle undertook to carry him
to the courts of Ishtar (Venus), the
goddess of childbirth, and thus
addressed him:
My friend, lift up thy countenance,
Come and let me carry thee to the
heaven of Anu.
On my breast place thy breast,
On my pinions place thy palms.

At the eagle's bidding, Etana, old
though he was, taking courage into
his hands, "set his breast against the
breast of the eagle, and laid his hands
on the feathers of its wings." Then
the eagle took off without making
much noise unlike Apollo-11 with
the old man clinging to it for dear life,
and soared higher and higher, pointing
out on the way "the vast dwindling
panorama of earth and sea."
At last they reached heaven, and
passed through the courts of Anu,
Enlil and Ea, but the throne of Ishtar
was still higher up. It was now six
hours that they had been going up
without a stop, and Etana, either
because his courage failed him or
because he felt giddy, ordered the
eagle to halt and take him back to
earth. Unfortunately, the text is badly
defaced here, and the poem ends with
the sad account of the "spacecraft's"
crash landing.
On numerous cylinder seals dating
back to the Dynasty of Akkad, third
millennium B.C., Is depicted a strange
scene which many scholars have
interpreted as illustrating the flight of
Etana Into space, though on these
seals a bearded man is seen riding
on the back of a bird, whereas
according to the Legend of Etana, the
patriarch was carried up clinging to
the pinions of an eagle.
The bird on these seals is probably
an eagle, taking off with a bearded
man, possibly Etana, on its back.
Immediately below the eagle is a dog,
or, more commonly, two dogs seated
or standing face-to-face on either side
of a bag or vessel, evidently belonging
to the patriarch. They are frequently
depicted looking up in surprise at their
master. Another interesting feature
of these representations is the flock
of sheep.

This ancient Mesopotamian tale and
its illustrations in Sumerian art tra
velled widely, for Mesopotamia lay at
the cross-roads of the ancient cultural
world. The motif first migrated to
Iran. On an Iranian shell cylinder,
contemporaneous with the Akkadian
seals, a mythological scene is depicted.
Above a seated female figure, with
snakes emanating from her shoulders,
appears an eagle over one of whose
wings a human head is seen. This
design has been taken by some
scholars to be a rendering of the myth
of Etana in an abbreviated form.
There Is yet another, and better,
Illustration of the legend in Iranian art.
It is carved on a magnificent gold bowl
dating back to the second millennium
B.C. This rare object was discovered
by Robert Dyson in 1958 at Hasanlu,
in Iranian Azerbaijan in the course of an
archaeological expedition led by John
Dyson. In the elaborate scene de¬
picted on the bowl we see an eagle
in full flight carrying off a human
being, recalling the Mesopotamian
myth.
The tradition of Etana's flight sur¬
vived in later tales, notably in the
story of Alexander's flight into space.
Among the many wonderful exploits
attributed to Alexander the Great is
the one of his making himself small
and flying through the air perched on
the back of an eagle till he reached
the "heights of the heavens," which he
explored. From that altitude Alexander
was able to acquire a knowledge of
the dimensions of the earth, and of
the seas and mountains that he would
have to cross in his march of worid
conquest.
The Koran relates that a Babylonian
king held a disputation with the
Hebrew patriarch Abraham concerning
"Abraham's Lord". Commentators on
the Koranic text have identified the
monarch with Nimrod, who afterwards
caused Abraham to be cast into
a fire, from which, however, he was
miraculously delivered. Thereupon,
Nimrod built a tower so as to ascend
to heaven to see "Abraham's Lord"
and make war on him, but the tower
was mysteriously overthrown.
But Nimrod did not give up his
attempt and had himself carried up in
a chest drawn by four monstrous,
eagle-like birds, then after wandering
for some time in space, he fell down
on a mountain with such great force
that he made it shake.
A similar story is told in the great
Iranian epic, the Shah-nama, about
King Kay Kaus who was lifted up into
space in a car to which were harnessed
four eagles, one at each corner, which
flew upwards in their efforts to reach
the lumps of flesh attached to the
upper parts of the car. There are
several examples of the illustration of
this legend which may be referred to
a Sassanian original, the best known
of which is the marble slab inserted
in the northern wall of San Marco in
Venice.
Echoes of the Etana myth are also
to be heard in the Arabian Nights

Entertainments. During his Second
Voyage, Sinbad the Sailor tied himself
with his turban to the legs of the
fabulous Rukh or Roc, an eagle-like
bird, which flew up into the air carrying
Sinbad with it. It soared so high into
space that poor Sinbad lost sight of
the earth and it seemed to him as if
he had reached the very limit of the
sky. The bird, however, descended,
till it alighted on the top of a hill.
Great adventurer that he was,
Sinbad had yet another opportunity to
fly into space. In the course of his
Seventh Voyage, he found that in a
certain town at the beginning of each
month the townsmen were transformed
into birds and flew. Sinbad induced
one of them to carry him on his back,
but the man, or rather the bird, flew
so high that Sinbad could hear "the
angels glorifying God in the heavenly
dome."
In Tibet there is the story of a
Griffin a fabulous animal with lion's
body and eagle's beak and wings,
which rewarded the hero by taking him
upon its back and flying straight
through the "Great Golden Gate",
where it deposited the youth in the
centre of a vast courtyard round which
sat numerous gods, fairies and "other
denizens of the sky." Similarly, in
Swedish folklore the Phoenix, the
fabulous eagle-like Sun-bird, once
carried a youth on its back to "the
beautiful Palace East of the Sun and
North of the Earth."
The Etana myth found a spiritual ex¬
pression at Rome in the apotheosis
of the Emperor. We get a detailed
account of the ceremonies connected
with the deification of the Roman
Emperor from Herodian's description
of the obsequies of Severus, which
Herodian apparently witnessed. The
most significant of the funerary rites
was "the liberation, at the moment of
kindling the funeral pyre, of an eagle
which was supposed to bear the
Emperor's soul to heaven."
Apotheoses of emperors and mem
bers of the Imperial family were
recurring motifs in Roman art. The
eagle is an indispensable part of these
representations. Among the better
known examples are the apotheosis of
Titus sculpted on the Arch of Titus and
that of Augustus on a grand cameo
in the Louvre. Bronze medallions of
Antoninus Pius have "Consecratio"
inscribed on their reverse, and the
emperor with a himation (draped gar¬
ment) wrapped about his legs and a
sceptre in his right hand is shown
being carried aloft on the back of an
eagle. On some Roman coins the apo¬
theosis of Faustina is represented.
T
here is a story in the
Mahabharata which is reminiscent of
the apotheosis of the Roman Emperor.
After a brave warrior named Bhu-
rishtrava died on the field of battle
his soul was carried to heaven, on the
order of Krishna, by Garuda, the giant
eagle of Hindu mythology and the
mount of Vishnu, as of Krishna, his
incarnation. Similarly, the soul of the
Celtic hero Lugh-Llew Llaw in the
Mabinogion, flew up to heaven as an
eagle when Lugh-Llew was killed by
the tanist (his heir), at midsummer.
The archetypal myth of the eagle
carrying kings and heroes up to heaven
has its reverse version in Iranian
mythology. Rustam, a sky hero, was
brought by the Simurgh, a fabulous
bird of the eagle species, in the
opposite direction from heaven to
earth to be one of the first monarchs
of Iran.
In Greek mythology also there is
the story of the Sky-god Zeus coming
down from heaven in the form of an
eagle and abducting Thaleia, a nymph
of Mount Aitne in Sicily. This legend
is illustrated on a red-figured vase-
painting from Nola, Italy, which shows
Zeus as a mighty eagle in a blaze of
celestial splendour carrying Thaleia
from earth to heaven.
But the myth of the eagle of Zeus
coming down to earth and carrying off
a mortal, which gained immense popu¬
larity in Greece and later in Rome,
is that of Ganymede the son of Tros,
who gave his name to Troy. Because
of his dazzling beauty, this youth was
carried off from earth to heaven to
replace Hebe as cup-bearer to Zeus.
There, are several versions of this
myth, variously describing the manner
in which Ganymede was kidnapped.
But the most popular version has it
that he was carried off by the eagle
of Zeus.
The rape of Ganymede was a favou¬
rite motif in Greek art. The most cele¬
brated and, by all accounts, the most
typical representation of the myth is
the Ganymede group in bronze by
Leochares, an accomplished Attic

(86-161 A.D.) while the people

sculptor of the fourth century B.C.
Although the original, praised by Pliny,
has been lost, several copies of this
work have survived the ravages of
time. The best of them is the marble
copy in the Museo Pio Clementino at
the Vatican.
The presence of the dog in the Leo-
chares sculpture reminds us of the
Etana scenes on the Sumerian cylinder
seals. So does Virgil's description in
the Aeneid, Book V, of the design
embroidered on the robe awarded to
Cloanthus, the winning captain in the
boat race. In Dryden's translation the
passage reads:
There Ganymede Is wrought with
living art,
Chasing through Ida's groves the
trembling hart,
Breathless he seems, yet eager to
pursue,
When from aloft descends, in open
view,
The bird of Jove, and sousing on his
prey,
With crooked talons bears the boy
away.
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing
eyes,
His guards behold him soaring
through the skies,
And dogs pursue his flight with
imitated cries.
There are several adaptations of the
Ganymede group by Leochares in the
Graeco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. In
these specimens, Garuda is shown
seizing a Nagini after the manner of
the eagle in the Vatican copy of the
Leochares masterpiece.
I
N the Iranian art of the early
Islamic Period, representations of a
youth being carried up by an eagle
seem to have been influenced, by the
Ganymede sculpture of Leochares. But
they are also in line with the primitive
Iranian tradition of the sky-eagle being
synthetized with the sky-deity.
Two examples deserve particular
notice. One is on a tenth-century
bowl in the Keleklan Collection at the
Victoria and Albert Museum, London.
A spread eagle is depicted on the
inside of the bowl, carrying off a hero
who is extended over the body of
the bird and is clinging to it. A strik¬
ing feature of this design is the dog
shown within the double border round
the eagle.
The other example is even more
remarkable. It occurs as a decoration
on a twelfth-century white silk com¬
pound cloth in the A.D. Bliss Collec¬
tion. Here the eagle is double-headed
and carries off a prince, who clasps
with both his hands a circlet passing
round the neck of the bird.
Indian mythology Is not lacking in
stories of the eagle being sent down
from on high to carry mortals to hea¬
ven. There is, for instance, the story
related in the Mahabharata of a king
called Vasu Uparichara, who was
deeply devoted to Narayana (Vishnu).
When his time was up, "renouncing
his body", Uparichara ascended to
heaven. After having had a taste of
heavenly bliss, however, the poor man
tumbled down from paradise and
"went down a hole in the earth."
This came about through the curse
of the Brahamanas, whose wrath Upa¬
richara had aroused when he acted as
an arbitrator in a dispute between
them and the gods regarding the pro¬
per method of offering religious sacri¬
fices, and had the temerity to give his
award in favour of the gods.
Although, like Lucifer, Vasu had fal¬
len so low, he did not, unlike Lucifer,
give up his faith in God (Vishnu) but
continued to worship him as fer¬
vently as before. Being highly pleas¬
ed with Uparichara who thus showed
himself to be entirely devoted to him
and dependent on him as his sole
refuge in distress, Vishnu ordered
his mount, the swift Garuda, to rescue
the fallen king.
In an unparalleled diving operation,
Garuda swooped down into the pit in
which Vasu was lying and, lifting him
up, it soared into the sky and there
released him from its beak. In this
way, thanks to the eagle of Vishnu,
Vasu Uparichara re-entered heaven
and regained his divine form.
By a strange coincidence, there is
also an intimate connexion between
the eagle and the moon in Indian
mythology. According to the Rigveda,
it was Suparna, "the fair-wing'd one",
which is but another name for Garuda,
that brought Soma to man. Now, in
the Veda, Soma means the exhilarat¬
ing celestial drink. But it also means
the moon, which was supposed to
hold the life-giving, wisdom-imparting
nectar.
Sad to relate, the moon which the
"Eagle", unlike the bird of legend,
has brought within human reach is a
dry and dusty planet without so much
as a drop of water, let alone nectar, in
its so-called "seas". And to think that
there was a time when man imagined
the moon to be a bowl of liquid, so
that Shakespeare could fancy "young
Cupid's fiery shaft" being "quench'd
in the chaste beams of the wat'ry
moon I"
Verily, the "Eagle", while it has
enabled man to realize one dream,
has shattered another. It has com¬
pleted the process of stripping the
moon of all the romance with which,
from times immemorial, man had
draped it, and has exposed it for
what it really is an ugly, pock¬
marked planet, devoid of vegeta¬
tion, unfit for normal human habita¬
tion, without the faintest resem¬
blance to its personification as the
beautiful Selene by the ancient Greeks.
Aptly did Thomas Campbell versify:
"Tis distance lends enchantment to
the view,
And robes the mountain in its azure
hue."
Garuda, a fabulous bird, carrier of
the Hindu god Vishnu and mortal
enemy of the genii of land and sea,
carries of a Nagini, a female
sprite. This Gandhara bas-relief
probably dates from the 4th
century A.D.
