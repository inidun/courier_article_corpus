LEWIS CARROLL'S
own wonderland
of drawings
In 1865 the
world was as¬
tonished and de¬
lighted with a
book called Ali¬
ce's Adventures
in Wonderland
by one Lewis
Carroll. The
world was fur¬
ther astonished
to discover that
Lewis Carroll
was none other
than Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson, an Oxford don
and mathematician who had step¬
ped out of his academic role to
write what has since become the
greatest of all English books for
children. When the Alice stories
were published in book form they
owed much of the immediate fame
they won to the illustrations of an
English cartoonist and artist, Sir
John Tenniel, of Punch. What few
people knew at the time and few
persons, realize even today is that
the original manuscript, entitled
Alice's Adventures Under Ground,
had been illustrated by another
artist Lewis Carroll himself.
Carroll had always been interest¬
ed in drawing. As a boy he had a
little book specially set aside for
humorous sketches in which he
took great pleasure. Throughout
his life he continued to draw with
remarkable zest and perseverance
despite John Ruskin's later com¬
ment "that he had not enough
talent to make it worth his while
to devote much time to sketching."
Dodgson preferred figures to land¬
scapes, and at one time seriously
toyed with the idea of becoming a
free-lance cartoonist. After the
Comic Times returned his humor¬
ous sketches in 1855 he seems to
have accepted the decision that his
work was not good enough, though
in fact many of his early attempts
"were hardly inferior," as one
modern critic has said, "to Lear's
famous nonsense drawings and
exhibit a wild brilliance and unin¬
hibited draughtsmanship."
Dodgson thus dropped the idea
of becoming a professional artist.
He turned to an art form which
had just been born photography.
Between 1856 to 1880 it was his
chief hobby, his favourite subjects
being his child-friends. The re¬
cent re-discovery of his. fine photo¬
graphic work shows him to have
been the best photographer of
children in the 19th century.
The real Alice in Alice in Won¬
derland was one of the three
daughters of his. friend Dean
Liddell. Dodgson has called her
"my ideal child-friend," and has
recorded in his diary the origins of
the whimsical stories. Under July
4, 1862 is the entry: "I made an
expedition up the river to Dostow
with the three Liddells; we had tea
on the bank there." On the oppo¬
site page of the diary he added, on
February 10, 1863: "On which
occasion I told them the fairy tale
of Alice's Adventures Under

The drawings on these two pages
are examples of the original illus¬
trations done by Lewis Carroll for
his manuscript copy of Alice in
Wonderland which he first called
Alice Under Ground. Photograph on
opposite page shows the real-life

terpiece, Alice Liddell, photo¬
graphed by Carroll himself in the
studio which he had installed
above his apartment at Oxford.
Ground, which I undertook to
write out for Alice."
Long afterwards, Alice herself
(then Mrs. Alice Pleasance Har-
greaves) gave this account of how
the stories were first told to her and
her two sisters: "Most of Mr. Dodg-
son's stories were told to us on
river expeditions near Oxford. I
believe the beginning of Alice
was told one summer afternoon
when the sun was so burning that
we had landed in the meadows
down the river, deserting the boat
to take refuge in the shade of a
new-made hayrick. Here from all
three came the petition of 'Tell us a
story', and so began the ever-de¬
lightful tale."
Dodgson then embarked on the
slow process of illustrating his
original manuscript as a gift for
"a dear child in memory of a sum¬
mer day". This took him such a
long time that he did not get it
done until the autumn of 1864.
The story was exquisitely written
in a clear script as legible as print
(see photo). It contained 92 pages
with 18,000 words, but for the
published book Carroll later enlarg¬
ed it to nearly 35,000 words.
In 1928, the manuscript volume
was sold to a private American
collection for £15,400 (then $77,000)
"the highest price which any book
has ever brought in an English
auction room," but 20 years later
it reached the British Museum
through American generosity. The
manuscripts from which Alice in
Wonderland and Through the
Looking Glass were set up by the
printer, however, have never been
discovered.
Although Carroll's contempora¬
ries and Carroll himself seem to
have had little regard for his
ability as an artist, his illustrations
deserve a better fate than the
oblivion to which they have been
relegated up to a few years ago.
Of these illustrations, a recent
biographer of Lewis Carroll, Derek
Hudson, has remarked: "As. the
earnestness of the amateur draugh¬
tsman occasionally rises in them
to a weird frenzy that is almost
Blake-like in its intensity, this is
an exciting rather than a disappoint¬
ing experience. Carroll's draw¬
ings, lacking Tenniel's professional
accomplishment, could never have
assisted Alice to a popular success,
but unlike Tenniel's, they are the
work of a poet and have a private
anguish which is more moving than
it is amusing. They represent a
genuine artistic achievement which
has never been properly appreciat¬
ed." (Derek Hudson: Lewis Car¬
roll. 1954. Constable, London.)
A French critic, Henri Parisot,
has gone even further. "Car¬
roll's drawings," he has writ¬
ten, "were too stylized, too modern
to seem anything but the work of
an amateur during his time. Since
our aesthetic notions differ from
those of the Victorian Era, and
since our contemporary artists
have accustomed us to modes of
expression which are increasingly
divorced from the realistic acade¬
mism so dear to the 19th century,
we today find Carroll's drawings
illustrating the manuscript of Alice
strangely expressive indeed far
superior to the drawings of Tenniel
which were substituted for his."
(Henri Parisot: Lewis Carroll. 1952.
Pierre Seghers, Editeur, Paris.)
Irrespective of whether Carroll's
drawings are or are not superior
to those of Tenniel, it is indeed
regrettable that no edition of Alice
containing Lewis Carroll's own
illustrations is available to the
public today.
Drawings on these pages are
examples of those done by Carroll
for Alice Under Ground.
