The
United Nations
Water
Conference
THE United Nations Water Conference, held at Mar del Plata (Argentina) from 14
to 25 March 1977, was attended by 1,500 participants from 116 countries. Its aim
was to find ways and means of satisfying the world's need for water. The dele¬
gates faced a daunting task: some $100 billion must be invested by 1990*to provide the
world's urban and rural areas with adequate water supplies, while a further $100 billion
of investment will be needed by T990 for irrigation.
The Conference endorsed a Plan of Action comprising a series of important recom¬
mendations and resolutions. These cover the major problem areas, including: the
assessment of water resources, notably drinking water; the rational use of water in
agriculture; the control of waste and pollution; fisheries; hydroelectric power; inland
navigation; natural hazards (flood and drought management); public information, edu¬
cation, training and research; international co-operation (including financing for water
development); and technical co-operation among developing countries.
Specialized bodies of the U.N. system Unesco, the Food and Agriculture Organi¬
zation (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Children's Fund (UNI¬
CEF), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the U.N. Development Pro¬
gramme contributing to a concerted effort to devise programmes for the develop¬
ment and management of world water resources.
The Conference recommended that 1980-1990 should be proclaimed "International
Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade" by the U.N. and devoted to the deve¬
lopment and implementation of national water supply plans tailored to the social, eco¬
nomic and sanitary needs of each country.
