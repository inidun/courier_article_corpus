THE ODYSSEY
OF THE HUMAN
CONSCIENCE
The demand for human rights is so long-standing and so profound,
' the violation of human rights has been so ruthless and so wide¬
spread in recent times and is still so prevalent today, that we are not entitled
to rest on our laurels. The battle is raging on several fronts, in many parts
of the world, and the news reaching us is far from being only news of
victory.
I sometimes wonder whether the main thing was not and is
not, now more than ever to probe deeper for a better understanding ;
and, to that end, to awaken or accustom the mind to the very thought
of human rights, which is by no means as instinctive and familiar as
people think, or often pretend to think.
I t is, in any case, a fact that we have seen precious words impov-
erished over the years through being uttered mechanically,
without reference to their spiritual roots. And now, today, we find that
human rights are in danger of losing their prestige and their power of
inspiration, even before they have been completely assimilated and made
a reality.
In certain countries and some circles, there are people who say
that human rights have become meaningless, lifeless, in a revolutionary
age where it seems normal to sacrifice the justice and happiness of today
to the virtue and prosperity of tomorrow. Others aver that human rights
are devoid of substance in a technological civilization, where produc¬
tivity is the supreme value and where the two crucial problems are increas¬
ed production and distribution of goods. Others, again the apocalyptic
or the indifferent simply proclaim the end of the human race, even its
non-existence, and in any case the end of humanism. Let us take heed;
man is no longer much in fashion among the leaders of the nations, the
technocrats and the know-it-alls of our planet.
