July 2893. A fleet of boats car¬
rying participants to a climate
conference unloads its pas¬
sengers directly onto the
twenty-sixth floor of the
United Nations building in
New York. The meeting is being held
too late. As a result of global
warming the polar ice caps have
melted and the sea level has risen to
the point that the twenty-sixth floor
windows are now on the water level.
This scene was described some
years ago in a United Nations peri¬
odical in an attempt to sound the
alarm about global warming.
Although wildly exaggerated, it is
part of a scenario linked to the
greenhouse effect which has
alarmed not only the inhabitants
of low-lying islands such as the Mal¬
dives in the Indian Ocean, but also
those of the Netherlands, where
land reclaimed from the sea is pro¬
tected by dunes and dikes. The
effects of such a scenario would also
threaten Bangladesh, the Nile Delta,
the east coast of the United States
and all flat coastal regions a par¬
ticularly serious prospect since 70
per cent of the world's population
lives less than 60 km from the sea.
What exactly is the greenhouse
effect which has been so much
written about in the last few years
and has caused such widespread
dismay? This is how the problem
has been described so far. Radia¬
tion from the Sun penetrates the
atmosphere and warms the Earth's
surface, which then radiates some
of the heat it receives back towards
space. Some of this heat, which is
vital for life on Earth and keeps
water from freezing, escapes, but
some is trapped as if by the glass
panes of a greenhouse by gases of
which there is an increasing build¬
up in the atmosphere such as
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
and tropospheric (low-altitude)
ozone. Edward Goldsmith, who
founded the British magazine The
Ecologist twenty years ago, believes
that atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration has increased by 25
per cent since the beginning of the
industrial era, that the methane

concentration has doubled, and
that nitrous oxide and tropospheric
ozone concentrations are increasing
by 0.5 per cent each year.
In their book The Earth Report,
Edward Goldsmith and Nicholas
Hildyard describe the greenhouse
effect as "the most serious environ¬
mental problem facing the planet.
There is some disagreement whether
or not the rise in global temperature
of0.5° Centigrade in the last century
is due to global warming caused by
human activities or is a natural cli¬
matic fluctuation. However, it is
almost unanimously agreed among
climatologists that immediate action
to curb global warming is needed".
Goldsmith and Hildyard also quote
former British Prime Minister Mar¬
garet Thatcher as saying in March
1989 that "major changes in the
chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere
are taking place, with potentially
calamitous effects for mankind."
The alarmist remarks of environ¬
mentalists have thus been echoed
by politicians who in some cases
have gone so far as to compare the
greenhouse effect with a world
nuclear war.
FROM CERTAINTIES
TO DOUBTS
But is it possible that the certain¬
ties of 1989 have become improb¬
able hypotheses in 1993? Palaeocli-
matologists who study ice,
sediments, rocks, coral and the
trunks of ancient trees, admit that
they cannot calculate the tempera¬
ture of the Earth as it was 2,000 years
ago. The planet experiences climatic
cycles that are alternately hot and
humid and cold and dry. But
although a rise of 0.5°C has been
recorded in the second half of this
century (i.e., since precise temper
ature measurements began to be
made), peaking in the 1980s, no-one
today is prepared to state categori¬
cally that this provides incontro¬
vertible proofofglobal warming, or
that global warming is due to human
activities, since no-one knows what
happened before humankind
appeared on the scene. Gérard Lam¬
bert, a member of the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) set up by the United Nations,
says, "We know that the factors
encouraging the greenhouse effect
are increasing. We can measure the
atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide, methane and CFCs.
We model the rest, but however
powerful our computers are, no
model is capable ofcopying nature."

The greenhouse
effect.
The Intergovernmental Confer¬
ence on the World Climate Pro¬
gramme, which was held in Geneva
(Switzerland) from 14 to 16 April
1993, also yielded some surprises.
The meeting was co-sponsored by
the World Meteorological Organi¬
zation (WMO), the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP),
the Food and Agriculture Organi¬
zation of the United Nations (FAO),
Unesco, the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU), the United
Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and the International
Océanographie Commission (IOC).
Entitled "The Climate Agenda", the
meeting reviewed, a year after the
Rio Conference, the current situa¬
tion with regard to the socio-eco¬
nomic impact of climate change
resulting from the greenhouse
effect. The 400 participants from
some 140 countries took note of
one obvious point. "Climate pre¬
diction," says one of the Conference
documents, "is a complex under¬
taking which is hindered by the gaps
in our knowledge. . . . Knowledge
of climatic processes must be deep¬
ened and we must improve obser¬
vation of the atmosphere, the
oceans, ice and the land areas of
the planet." All the speakers insisted
on the need to intensify research in
these fields.
COULD THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
BE BENEFICIAL?
While the industrialized coun¬
tries already have satellite, rocket
and land-based observation facili¬
ties, as well as computerized cli¬
mate modelling systems, the devel¬
oping countries generally do not
have adequate facilities for
observing the local climate and its
variations, or for collecting and
analysing meteorological data. Con¬
sequently an appeal has been
launched for the rich countries to
participate in the creation ofobser¬
vation centres in the poor coun¬
tries. A budget has even been
drafted, although nothing has been
said about where the money would
come from. Gunnar Kullenberg,
secretary of the IOC at Unesco, told
us he was sorry that no state or indi
vidual has really taken a lead on this
issue. It seems as if governments
are waiting for the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change to be ratified. This Con¬
vention, signed by 154 countries in
June 1992 at the United Nations
Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED), must be
ratified before it can come into
force. Its ultimate goal is to "stabilize
greenhouse gas concentrations in
the atmosphere at a level that would
prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate
system".
Observers at the Rio and Geneva
conferences were very surprised
that nothing was said about the
need to reduce the production of
greenhouse gases by reducing pol¬
lution. On the contrary, at a press
conference at which FAO was rep¬
resented by Wim Sombroek,
Director of FAO 's" Land and Water
Development Division, and by René
Gommes, Secretary of FAO's Inter¬
departmental Sub-group on Cli¬
mate Change, we heard that "cli¬
mate change could also lead to
useful modifications from which
we should be ready to draw profit:
the increase in carbon dioxide con¬
centrations could have a beneficial
effect on world food production
when world population has dou¬
bled". Carbon provides plants with
food. Several other beneficial effects
of climate change have been iden¬
tified, including increased poten¬
tial for bio-fuels and higher tem¬
peratures in temperate zones. This
revolutionary assertion must have
surprised Edward Goldsmith.
Should we conclude from it that to
have bumper harvests we should
step on the accelerator?
