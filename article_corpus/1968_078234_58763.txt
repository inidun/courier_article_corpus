THE UBIQUITOUS
SHADOW
OF RACISM
22 by John Rex
D
ESPITE the defeat of the
Nazis and their allies and the setting
up of the United Nations Organization
in 1945, racism continues to haunt
the world today. Men are denied em¬
ployment, housing and educational
opportunities because of their skin
colour; some rich countries still have
racial immigration laws to keep out
JOHN REX, professor of Social Theory and
Institutions at the University of Durham,
England, has been concerned with racial
questions for many years, and in particular
the problems of racial prejudice and the
integration of minorities in large metropo¬
lises. He has written widely on these
matters and is the author, with R.S. Moore,
of "Race, Community and Conflict", just
published for the Institute of Race Relations
by Oxford University Press, London, 1967.

immigrants from poorer and hungrier
lands; political leaders are imprisoned
for life for demanding that all races
should have the same political rights;
and even in the cities of the affluent
Western world the Negro ghettoes
burn, signalling to the world the blank
despair of their inhabitants.
The most striking instance of racism
in the world today is that of the sys¬
tem of Apartheid in South Africa.
Apartheid is not as some people may
still imagine a serious attempt to pro¬
vide equal though separate facilities
for all races. It is segregation carried
through by men with white skins to
their own advantage and to the disad¬
vantage of the black and coloured
populations.
Its viciousness lies not solely in the
fact that different "races" must live in
different areas, but far more in the fact
that the areas assigned -to the non-
White groups are the overcrowded
and eroded parts of the countryside.
Inevitably those assigned to living
there would face starvation unless
they went as migrants and transients
to seek work in the White areas. So
what the theory of Apartheid means
is this: that black men will work for
white so long as political power lies
where it does.
Such a system as this is the product
of conquest and of the monopoly of
political power by a conquering group.
The conquerors seize upon the fact of
skin colour in order to imply that the
inequality which they have created is
given by Nature, that it is the inevit¬
able consequence oí biological differ
ences,
God.
or even that it Is the will of
Such a political system could have
been established in many parts of the
colonial world, but the process of
decolonization set in train by the vic¬
tory of 1945 and assisted by United
Nations action succeeded in many
countries in opening equal opportun¬
ities to all. Hence today we see many
cases where those who govern a newly
independent country are the children
of peasants or of political prisoners.
But where White supremacy and
Apartheid prevail, coloured people
must either accept their inferior lot or
be condemned for life to an island pri¬
son. A similar future is inevitable in
other countries if their present politi¬
cal leaders establish governments

THE SHADOW OF RACISM (Continued)
Wiping out discrimination-
first step to exploding racist theories
24
based upon inequality of political rights
between races.
But racism and its social consequen¬
ces are evident not only in the former
colonial territories. They are an ever
present feature of the life of advanced
industrial countries. Increasingly in
some at least of these countries the
traditional political issues pale into
insignificance beside the problem of
racial inequality and men's attempt
to fight against it.
Inevitably in the post 1945 world,
with the advanced countries of Europe
and North America undergoing a
period of unparalleled economic pros¬
perity, immigrants have come to their
cities from the poorer countries, from
the rural areas and from the areas
where the old slave plantations were.
There is much evidence to suggest
that this migration has not represent¬
ed an uncontrolled and uncontrolla¬
ble flood, for the immigrants have
exercised their own immigration con¬
trol by going where the jobs are.
Nevertheless this is precisely how
this immigration has been perceived in
the countries concerned and they have
reacted by throwing up barriers either
to immigration itself or to full equality
of opportunity for the immigrant in
fields such as housing or employment.
Such barriers may not have an expli¬
citly racial form. They may affect all
newcomers. But there can be little
doubt that coloured people are most
affected by them and that the discrimi¬
nation involved is widely thought to be
based upon colour and race.
Hence what we see is the segre¬
gation of coloured people in squalid
lodging houses if not by themselves,
together with the down and outs and
outcasts of the host society, as well
as a denial of equal employment op¬
portunities so that the coloured unem¬
ployment rate is often several times
as high as that for the society as a
whole. Such trends as these are only
amplified as increasing technological
progress ensures that those who do
have good jobs are better housed and
better paid than they have ever been
before.
A majority in these circumstances
can fight for justice and equality
through the ballot box. For a minor¬
ity the problem is more difficult.
They may appeal to the courts, and
this they have sometimes done with
success. But where law is inade¬
quate in scope or too tardy in redres¬
sing grievances there seems to have
been no alternative open but riot, law¬
lessness, and civil disobedience.
In Europe's history the main themes
of political change have centred on
the struggle of classes, and Euro¬
peans, interpreting the politics of the
colonial world, have tended to see
there a retelling of their own story.
The most striking fact of the world
today is that colonial people and
coloured people reject these inter¬
pretations. They note that discrimina¬
tion and inequality are not the lot of
the employed classes as such, but spe-

cifically of the colonial and coloured
workers.
Less and less are they willing to
accept advice which tells them that
their problems are not racial ones or
that they should throw in their lot with
the international working class. In¬
stead they set alongside Europe's theo¬
ries of political change, of increasing
equality and welfare being achieved
through working class action, their own
theories of Black Power or the Colo¬
nial Revolution.
A number of recent writers have
seen the divisions which are arising
in the world in these terms. New divi¬
sions are opening up and new allian¬
ces are being formed. On a world
scale we have the sense of what Marx
saw within the nation state in the nine¬
teenth century: the division of men
into "two great warring camps". But
the camps are no longer the camps of
social and economic class. The "war"
which we face threatens to be a race
war.
In this headlong rush to disaster
those who oppose racism must
oppose it at its roots. They have, of
course, to expose its untruth and its
fallacy, but this of itself is not enough.
It is necessary to find ways of protect¬
ing people against discrimination and
it is necessary to understand the
social and psychological causes which
lead to false racial beliefs having the
wide acceptance which they do.
These are problems to which social
scientists as well as the United Nations
specialized agencies should be addres¬
sing themselves.
The declaration by biologists meet¬
ing under the auspices of Unesco
in Moscow in 1964 did much to ensure
that racist theories were denied any
kind of scientific support. The con¬
sensus amongst biologists is now per¬
fectly clear and it amounts to this:
the inequalities which we observe in
the world today do not arise from the
different genetic inheritance of men.
Men are not unequal because they
were born unequal. And this being
so, the justice or injustice of existing
inequalities is not a closed question.
It is a legitimate subject of political
debate.
In the fight against racism the Mos¬
cow declaration of the biologists
should be used to maximum effect.
Schools and the mass media can be
used to ensure that the facts about
the biology of race are known. Unfor¬
tunately they can also be used to
opposite effect as well and the prob¬
lem here is the one which always
faces those who hope for reform
through education. Who Is to edu¬
cate the educators? Clearly Unesco
must do whatever it can to see to it
that those who teach, either through
the schools or through the media, are
thoroughly educated.
Those who wish to secure justice
and the elimination of racist practice
cannot wait however until the whole
population is educated. Nor can they
await a universal "change of heart ".
It is precisely this notion, namely that
the ending of racism requires a univer¬
sal change of heart, which is used to
justify its continuance. So long as
there are people being deprived of a
fair opportunity in life, it should be the
duty of any government which truly
opposes racism, to use its power to
make law to prevent and to punish
all acts of a racist kind.
N
O ONE with any experien¬
ce of legislation against racial discri¬
mination imagines that it can be le¬
gislated out of existence. Most
usually the racist finds loopholes in
the law, or he proceeds to discriminate
on grounds which are not overtly racist
(e.g. he argues that the deprived group
is uneducated or has unacceptable cul¬
tural standards). Nonetheless law it¬
self has an educative role and the
effect of only a few court cases on
public opinion, especially among those
who have no strong racist views, can
be considerable.
It is precisely where law fails that
the deprived and underprivileged are
likely to take the law into their own
hands. Urban riots and theories like
that of Black Power are, more than
anything else, assertions that the law
has failed in its responsibilities. The
end to violence and lawlessness can
lie only in the law doing what violence
claimed to do, namely to guarantee
the rights of the individual.
Finally, however, racism must be
fought not merely by protecting people
from the consequences of racist acts,
but by eliminating those social sit¬
uations which cause racism. For if
we fail to do this the likelihood is that
it will only re-emerge in a disguised
form. The real hope in the fight
against racism lies precisely in the
fact that something can be done to
deal with the problem at its roots.
There Is no evidence that racist
behaviour itself has any k'ind of here¬
ditary roots. It Is true that it is asso¬
ciated in its extreme form with patho¬
logical personality characteristics and
there is scope here for action by psy¬
chiatrists in eliminating it. But the
fact is that the majority of those who
are susceptible to racist propaganda
are not sick or disturbed people in
this sense. The main problem which
we have to face is how racism arises
in this group and how it can be stop¬
ped.
What sociologists have shown from
the time of Gunnar Myrdal's great
study of the American Negro onwards
is that once discrimination starts, the
man who is discriminated against is
in fact in an inferior position and that
this inferiority is used as proof of
racist theory.
The problem then is to nip racism
in the bud by eliminating discrimina¬
tion itself. Thus discrimination in
housing leads to the coloured man
living in inferior conditions. These
conditions are then used as a reason
for not allowing him to move into
better houses. The only answer to
this problem is to stop the discrimi¬
nation and by ensuring that all men
have adequate housing remove from
the public mind the ¡mage of the
coloured man as a natural slum
dweller.
If the social roots of racism are un¬
derstood in this way there will be less
chance of the development of new in¬
stances of political regimes based upon
theories of racial supremacy. This is
the task to which most of us must now
address ourselves, a defensive task
to prevent racism from winning new
victories. It is a task of mobilizing
understanding and goodwill wherever
we can find it, in unofficial as well as
in governmental quarters.
This is the least we can do. Not to
do it means that the world will drift
more and more towards the situation
of two great warring racial camps. But
if we can do it and, as it were, hold
the line where it Is, it may yet be pos¬
sible to go on to deal with the most
serious problems of all, to find the
means of dealing with those cases
where governments themselves are
racist beyond redemption and where
international sanctions have to be em- äi-
ployed to bring them into line with the ¿J)
moral standards of the twentieth cen¬
tury.
