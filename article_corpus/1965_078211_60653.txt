WARNINGS
ALERT POLICE
IN
95 COUNTRIES
UNESCO and the International Council of Museums (ICOM)
have launched a campaign to make the museums of the
world more security-conscious. In this work, they are
being helped by Interpol, the International Criminal Police Orga¬
nization. Interpol, neither a super police force nor an inter¬
national detective agency, was founded in 1923 as a public service
to prevent and check crime. At the request of ICOM, Interpol
carried out the first world survey of alarm systems and other
devices used to protect museums against theft. When a theft
does occur, Interpol's own alarm system moves into action.
From Interpol headquarters in Paris, full details of the stolen
painting, sculpture or work of art are immediately circulated to
the police services of some 95 countries. No fewer than
fourteen different nations have notified thefts from museums,
galleries or public monuments during the last five years. Map
shows only thefts of publicly-owned works of art. It does not
list losses from private collections or galleries. There are
about 12,000 museums in the world today and they attract, be¬
tween them, some 220 million visitors every year. This is why
the problem of adequately protecting art treasures worries
museum authorities as never before.
