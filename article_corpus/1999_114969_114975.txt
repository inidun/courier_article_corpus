“We can’t go to the police,or borrow
money from the bank or anything.All
I ’ ve got is my name. . .” This stat e m e n t
by a character in My Name is Jo e, a new fil m
by British director Ken Loach, d e s c ribes in
a nutshell the plight of those who find
themselves on the margin of society.
It is no easy matter to bring yo u n g
people in this situation back into society, t o
break the vicious circle of marginalization
and give them the chance to find a steady
job and,more importantly, to learn a skill.
Semilla is one of many organizations in
Spain that are trying to do just this.
“ We try to prepare them for long-term
j o b s , but even if they find work for only a
few months, it enables them to build up
their CV,” s ays Luis Oscar Reye s , who ru n s
S e m i l l a ’s youth inform ation centre and jobs
c l u b. “They often have a range of skills
which unfort u n ately don’t come across ve ry
well in an official document.” S e m i l l a ,
which was founded nearly 25 ye a rs ago, i s
based in the Madrid dorm i t o ry suburb of
V i l l ave r d e , which has a high school dropout
r ate (60 per cent), and is plagued by
a l c o h o l i s m , u n e m p l oy m e n t , d ru g
a d d i c t i o n , broken families and youth gangs.
Breaking
the vicious circle
“I think I’ll be able to get a job after this,”
s ays 19-year-old Cri s t i n a , who heard about
Semilla when she was at school.After studying
cutting and dressmaking in a design and
fashion house for two ye a rs , she now works in
M e t a s , a boutique which also belongs to
S e m i l l a .There she has learned all about selling
d e c o r ated fa b rics and household linen,
r a n ging from accounting to customer
r e l at i o n s , and making window blinds and
q u i l t s.
“They take turns doing different jobs,
l e a rning how a business works and above all
h ow to accept responsibilities,” s ays Pa l o m a ,
who runs the shop and supervises its staff of
five (three teachers and two professional
couturiers) as well as the students.

Over a thousand Spanish organizations,
many based in tough neighbourhoods,
are running schemes to bring young
outsiders back into society

Hundreds of young people like Cri s t i n a
h ave been prepared by Semilla,which is funded
by public and pri vate Spanish and European
bodies and currently has 270 students.
The young people go to Semilla on their
own initiat i ve , or on the advice of relat i ve s ,
f riends or social wo r k e rs. Those under 16
(the legal school-leaving age) start by going to
a day centre and the ones who have not been
to school for at least four months receive
special instru c t i o n .E vening classes also help
the youths overcome their educat i o n a l
p r o b l e m s.
Three workshops gi ve the oldest among
them a two- or three-year training in
c o m p u t e rs , fashion and design, or the hotel
business. The last stage of the course is a
spell in the world of work, at first within
Semilla itself, which apart from its shop
and workshop has a catering service.
“We also have agreements with firms
like Campofrio (one of Spain’s leading food
companies) and Auchan (a French
s u p e rmarket chain) so young people can do
unpaid work training for up to three
months,” says Reyes. “We’ve also have 40
people in a supervised professional back-to-
work progr a m m e , which invo l ve s
subsidizing firms to the tune of 30,000
pesetas ($215) a month for eve ry yo u n g
p e rson they take on for at least six months.”
Semilla also acts as a labour exchange,
serving as a clearing house for job offers,
helping people compile CVs and prepari n g
them for courses run by the Spanish state
e m p l oyment agency, I N E M . It reckons that
80 per cent of those who have received the
training it provides manage to find jobs,
mostly in small neighbourhood shops.
S e m i l l a ’s experience is not unique.
There are thought to be more than a
thousand similar organizations in Spain.
The biggest cat e g o ry among them includes
w h at are known as social co-operat i ve s ,
back-to-work firms which exist mainly in
C atalonia (more than 200), A n d a l u s i a
( 1 5 0 ) ,M a d rid (100), the two Castiles (60),
the Basque Country (50), Valencia (50)
and Galicia (50). Their methods and
o r g a n i z ation systems differ, but they are all
guided by one basic pri n c i p l e — t h at
prevention is the first step in the struggle
against exclusion. n
