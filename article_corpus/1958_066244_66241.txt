BILINGUALISM
How Wales solved this great educational problem
by Sir Ben Bowen Thomas
We hear so much today
about Bilingualism in
Education. We cannot
escape from it in Wales, and
in this experience we are not
unique. On the continent of
Europe you have only to think
of Belgium, Holland, Switzer¬
land, Yugoslavia and the states
of the U.S.S.R. to realize how
many countries are involved.
Nor is this a matter that ex¬
clusively concerns the smaller
countries. The so-called Great
Powers, whose language may
be English, Russian, Spanish or
French are increasingly realiz¬
ing that . monolingualism no
longer meets the needs of the
present situation and that every
intelligent citizen of the future
should have a working know¬
ledge of at least one other
modern language besides his
own. In. Wales it is a case of
"Escape Me Never". Something
has been done about it for
three generations or more; it is
still a live educational issue.
What do we mean by Biling¬
ualism? It is the acceptance
of the educational aim that, if
possible, the average pupil in
our schools should attain a
mastery of his mother tongue
and a working knowledge of the
second language current within
his society by the time he
reaches his twelfth year, and in
any case by the time he reaches
the end of his period of com¬
pulsory education.
There is the general aim. In
Wales, Welsh is the historic
language. It has an honour¬
able literary history of a thous¬
and years; it was a well-estab¬
lished and standardized lan¬
guage before English was,
though today English is the
first language of two-thirds of
the people.
In this matter of bilingualism
in Wales the Education Acts
impose three duties upon the
administrators in the Ministry.
The first requires the promo-

tion and development of the
education of the people of
Wales and the development of
their institutions, pre-eminent
amongst which is the Welsh
language. In the last fifty years
there has been no slackening
of vigilance in this matter.
Language surveys have been
made so as to devise suitable
ways and means of dealing
with the children of every area
in terms of their own condi¬
tions. Hundreds of summer
schools, conferences and local
courses have been arranged to
help teachers to cope With prob¬
lems of school organization
and curricula. Publishers have
been stimulated to provide
school readers, the School
Broadcasting Council for Wales
has been helped in the prepara¬
tion of its Welsh programmes,
and, as a result of these efforts,
there has been a great impro¬
vement in the development of
clear language policies by local
education authorities, in in¬
creasing the number of com¬
petent, teachers of Welsh, in
improving school organization
and in applying better class¬
room techniques.
The second duty is concerned
with the training of teachers.
There is no problem of numbers
in Wales, but there has been a
problem of getting the right
kind of teachers and of using
them in Wales. Training col¬
leges have met both these
needs increasingly. In addition,
courses of training through the
medium of Welsh have now
been established at two of our
colleges, and the Minister has
asked the Welsh Joint Educa¬
tion Committee to encourage
Welsh local education authori¬
ties to see that these qualified
bilingual teachers should toe
employed in due course.
The third duty derives from
the section of the Act that says
that pupils are to be educated
in accordance with the wishes
of their parents. This is often
referred to in connection with
bilingualism.
In recent years the Ministry
has approved the establishment,
in mixed linguistic areas, of
Welsh schools for Welsh-speak¬
ing children on educational
grounds.
The local education authori¬
ties have also made consider¬
able progress, both singly and
collectively. Some have ap¬
pointed language organizers; a
few have stimulated the pro¬
duction of suitable school text¬
books and very good they are.
Several have reorganized their
schools in the interest of better
bilingual teaching. Where com¬
munities are overwhelmingly
Welsh-speaking or English-
speaking, arrangements can be
simple and little change may be
required. Welsh language pri¬
mary schools or English lan¬
guage primary schools can be
established and the second lan¬
guage English or Welsh can
be gradually introduced when
the child enters Junior School.
But where the communities
are very mixed in a linguistic
sense, other solutions become
necessary. Sometimes all the
children will enter the same
school and then they will be
classified on a language basis,
the unity of the school being
maintained through its acts of
worship, social functions and
games. In such schools the
dominating language of the
playground will be the ascen¬
dant one. The second solution
in linguistically mixed areas
may also involve the assembling
of children of the minority lan¬
guage group from a wider area
than is usual and concentrating
them in one school. In this
way Welsh language schools
have appeared in recent years
in city, town and urban areas.
The Welsh Joint Education
Committee has stimulated the
production of Welsh books by
levying sums of money from the
local education authorities so as
to guarantee something like
£16,000 a year for these books.
And so we have both central
and local government playing
their part to establish as fair a
bilingual policy in the schools
of Wales as is possible.
The result can be far-reach¬
ing. Only recently the maga¬
zine "Education" declared:
"The Welsh crucible can yield
results that might radically in¬
fluence not only other bilingual
countries, but the teaching of
language everywhere."
