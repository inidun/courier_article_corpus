The
anatomy
of
the
flood
by Dino Tonini
A N atmospheric distur¬
bance of exceptional violence on
November 3, 4 and 5, 1966 poured
torrential rain over vast areas of Italy
for more than 48 hours. Snow already
accumulated in the mountains thawed
rapidly. Abnormally high tides and
gales lashed the Gulf of Venice.
These are the cause of the rampaging
floods that have devastated large parts
of Central Italy.
Almost one-third of the country,
about 100,000 sq. km. (nearly 40,000

has suffered grievous loss of life as
well as serious damage and destruc¬
tion, not only to public works, technical
installations and industrial plants, but
also to some of the finest treasures in
an artistic heritage that belongs to all
mankind.
In the last fifty years, Italy has been
the victim of 130 serious floods and
innumerable lesser Inundations. In
the Po delta alone (the Province of
Rovigo between the lower reaches of
the Po and Adige), 20 floods occurred
between 1945 and 1965 alone.
For centuries Italy has been fight¬
ing floods. But the immense techni¬
cal and financial efforts employed have
inevitably had to be dispersed over
large areas and many years with the

result that they have succeeded only
in the case of the most recurrent
floods.
Take the work of afforestation and
the stabilization of mountain regions.
This is the very basis of any struggle
against floods, but its results are not
seen for at least a generation. Storms
nearly always occur when the soil is
just beginning to become firm and in
a matter of hours a cloudburst destroys
the work and hopes of many years.
Embankments are built, destroyed
and then rebuilt higher and higher in
a continuous battle against the enor¬
mous quantities of solid matter brought
down by rivers in spate because there
are no natural or artificial lakes to halt
them. These alluvial deposits even¬
tually raise the level of river-beds
above that of the surrounding country¬
side.
Finally, man's hunger for land has
meant that the unfarmed areas bet¬
ween one embankment and the next,
or in the vicinity of deltas where floods
were once able to spread and lose
some of their force, have shrunk more
and more. People settle in areas
which should have continued to play
a protective role, and where meas¬
ures taken against the most recurrent
and therefore less important floods
may well have created a false feeling
of security.
I N Italy there are few large
rivers but tens of thousands of tor¬
rents, due to the morphology and
hydrographie structure of the Italian
soil: 10.4 million hectares (26 million
acres) of mountains; 11 million hec¬
tares of hilly ground, and less than
6 million hectares (15 million acres)
of plains. So the waters rush down
steep, bare slopes, no longer impeded
by the forest which once covered a
great part of the peninsula.
Since the Middle Ages entire forests
have been destroyed, either to provide
timber for Europe's fleets, or to obtain
land for farming or pasture. Three and
a half million hectares (8.6 million
acres) need replanting with trees;
meanwhile the erosion of the land
continues unchecked and the waters
continue to carry away rich humus to
the sea and to cause landslides and
avalanches.
All this was demonstrated more
violently than ever during the recent
floods. The waters tearing down the
mountain sides brought with them
stones and rocks and earth. An
already precarious situation was ag¬
gravated by temporary obstructions
backwaters, diversion of river beds,
silting the disastrous effects of which
persist long after the waters have
retreated, as though the waters them¬
selves had become petrified in a new
world of apocalyptic appearance.
0 N the plains the muddy
waters have left a malodorous deposit
of mud and oil as well as the putrefying
remains of animals and plants to sully
alike fertile fields and. famous monu¬
ments, the patient work of small crafts¬
men and vast installations of modern
industry, irreplaceable manuscripts and
yellowing papers in some humble
office.
To this must be added the on¬
slaught of the raging sea on the barely
reclaimed lands of the Po delta lying
just beyond the battered and broken
defences of Venice.
The discharge of flood waters
depends on various meteorological,
geological and hydraulic factors : in¬
tensity, distribution and duration of
the rains (sometimes accompanied by
the rapid melting of accumulated
snow); general climatic conditions;
greater or lesser permeability of the
basic geological formations and of the
layer of detritus covering them ; types
and extent of cultivation; shape of the
major and minor hydrographie basins;
gradient of the slopes and drainage
channels; natural and artificial lakes;
areas for the spreading of flood waters;
stabilization of the river-beds or along
the river-beds ; river defences ; public
or industrial works ; human habitations.
Every flood is the result of a special
combination of some of these factors,
each of which has a specific im¬
portance. Those in which an almost
equal number of predominant factors
of average magnitude are combined
cause the normal floods which occur
with some regularity (on an average
once a year or once every two, three,
five or ten years). Combinations of the
maximum number of factors of extreme
magnitude cause exceptional floods
which may occur only- once every
50, 100, 200 or 1,000 years, or even
longer.
The chief stumbling block to fore¬
casting the recurrence of exceptional
floods is the lack of precise inform¬
ation about the number and importance
of the factors involved, and parti¬
cularly the maximum figures for rains,
snow, temperatures etc. Available
statistics, which rarely date back more
than a century, at best indicate a
tendency and certainly not maximum
figures, which we are still unable to
calculate even by theoretical studies.
Observations of present-day floods
give some indication of the extent of
floods in past times, but they do not
tell us how many of the factors in¬
volved had attained their maximum
intensity.
Such figures, in any case, usually
apply to water levels and not to the
corresponding discharges. Water levels
fluctuate even with the same discharge
because they depend to a great extent
on local conditions in the river-bed,
the existence of breaches and whether
or not there is room for the water to
spread.
T O speak of a maximum
flood, as people often do, is absurd.
Instead, we should talk of floods with
a probability of one-in-a-hundred, or
one-in-a-thousand; floods, in fact, that
occur on an average once every
hundred years (centennial floods), or
once every thousand years (millennial
floods) etc. "On an average" in this
context stresses the aspect of prob¬
ability; centennial floods may occur
twice in a century, in consecutive
years even, and there may be no
floods at all in the next century.
Hence, forecasts can do no more
than assess approximately the prob¬
able scale of flooding. The larger the
flood, the less often it is likely to
occur because of the reduced pos¬
sibility that all the factors involved in
a large flood will reach their maximum
levels simultaneously.

Over 100 persons
died» in the Italian
floods of November
1966. Many
industrial
installations were
damaged or

a million acres of
fertile lands were
inundated, 50,000
cattle drowned
and enormous
reserves of fodder
submerged. In the

12,000 buildings

It is impossible to predict when
exceptional floods are likely to occur,
except in general terms that they are
much more likely to happen in certain
seasons (autumn and spring, for
example) or just before the floods
actually begin, on the basis of rain¬
fall observations, the state of the
ground, the capacity for water storage
and so on.
This also requires a careful analysis
of previous floods, their seriousness
in relation to presumed orders of
magnitude and the time taken by the
floodwaters to reach the primary and
secondary basins. The analysis itself
presupposes that an efficient hydro-
meteorological network and communi¬
cations system has already existed for
some time and, above all, that the
phenomena will develop according to
a certain pattern.
The system for protection against
floods is based, in short, on an em¬
pirical knowledge of the past which
becomes increasingly uncertain the
further we go back. It can never be
foolproof since it cannot cover certain
factors the maximum value of which is
not known.
Furthermore a system designed for
protection against very infrequent
events is so little used that the floods
of the past are forgotten and the
system comes to be regarded as a
perfect guarantee of safety for all
time.
I
HE result is that its upkeep
is neglected and its efficiency impaired
by failure to apply safety measures
to a wide enough area. But the play
of forces keeps on shifting until one
day an exceptional combination of
circumstances brings disaster in its
wake. Paradoxically, the stronger the
defence system, the more catastrophic
the results of its collapse.
The Italian floods of November 1966
fit into this pattern. To find examples
of similar floods in the past we have,
in some instances, to go back several
centuries to descriptions contained in
old, forgotten chronicles; in other
cases, these floods are a repetition of
recent events, considered so excep¬
tional that their recurrence was believ¬
ed impossible.
In the Venetia region, the rains of
3-4 November 1966 came when the
draining lands of the hydrographie
basins were already saturated by the
heavy rainfall of the previous months,
which had already produced consider¬
able flooding at a very unusual season
(August 1966).
A
point to note is that other
floods, likewise fairly serious, had
occurred in 1965. In November 1966 the
downpour continued for about 38 hours
without a break, and increased steadily
in intensity from about 10 mm (4 in.) per
hour at the beginning to 20 mm. per
hour in the last three hours. This
accounts for the formation of a single
flood wave which attained, and in
many cases exceeded, the maximum
levels previously recorded in a number
of streams.
The actual rain which fell in 24
hours amounted, in many cases, to
15-20% of the mean annual rainfall,
and the amount which fell in the
38-hour period totalled as much as
30% or even 37% of the annual mean.
This exceptionally heavy rainfall
caused flood waves which rose almost
everywhere to levels higher than thé
maximum previously recorded, even
during the disastrous flooding of the
Adige ¡n 1882. The recent flooding of
the Adige downstream from Trento
was considerably lessened by dis¬
charging 70 million cubic metres of
water into Lake Garda through the
recently completed run-off canal.
The situation in the terminal sections
of the rivers in Venetia was aggravated
by a high tide which reached a level
never before recorded . in Venice :
1.90 metres (6 ft.) above sea level,
against 1.53 metres (5 ft.) recorded
in November 1951. Statistics indica¬
ted that on the average the level
would probably rise to 1.60 metres
only once in a century, and to 1.93
metres (just over 6 ft.) only once in a
thousand years. What happened to
Venice can thus be regarded as a
once-in-a-thousand-years event.
The normal tides at Venice cause a
maximum rise of 0.60 metres (2 ft.)
above the mean, but this level can be

THE ANATOMY OF THE FLOOD (Continued)
A third of a years rain
in 38 hours
raised considerably by, among other
factors, an exceptionally high velocity
sirocco and atmospheric pressures
that are low over the Upper Adriatic
and high over the Southern Adriatic
and Central Mediterranean.
The exceptionally high tides over¬
came the centuries-old defences built
at the time of the Republic of Venice
to protect the lagoon and the city;
further south they flooded a large part
of the lands in the Po delta. For¬
tunately the great river did not join
forces with the sea, but remained
threatening, a few inches below the
level of the ground already flooded.
In the Arno basin rain was also quite

annual rainfall in 24 hours and 25% to
30% in 48 hours. The level of the Arno
reached 11 metres (36 ft.) in Florence
as against 7.08 metres (24 ft.) in 1942.
In the Ombrone basin and the neigh¬
bouring Grosseto area, rainfall of 268
millimetres (over 10 inches) was
recorded at Baetignano as against a
previous maximum of 114 millimetres
(over 4 inches), and 232 mm at Gros¬
seto as against 103 mm.
The floods of November 1966 render¬
ed more catastrophic by the heavy
seas and by landslides due to the rapid
melting of snow, caused over a
hundred deaths, including those of
nine of the rescuers. The damage to
works of art and to state and private
archives is incalculable; material dam¬
age is estimated at $2,000 million.
As for agriculture, 310,000 hectares
(990,000 acres) of fertile land were
inundated, 5,000 kilometres (3,000
miles) of country roads were destroyed
or deteriorated, 50,000 cattle were
drowned, 12,000 buildings and 16,000
agricultural machines were damaged,
112 agro-industrial plants and over
three million quintals (170,000 tons)
of fodder were ruined.
Industry counts over 200 damaged
factories; thousands of small enter¬
prises had to close down, putting
60,000 out of work. At least 20,000
artisans' workshops and 40,000 shops
were damaged.
The damage to public works, the
tourist industry, private houses and
cars is enormous.
But reconstruction is already in full
swing.
