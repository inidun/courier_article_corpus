A moment of fulfilment
by Claude Louis-Combet
w ?*
In a celebrated lecture, the German poet Rainer
Maria Rilke spoke of "the great silence that reigns
around things". This close silence exists to calm the
passions and to increase the acuity of our perception of
other creatures. It is a silence of plenitude and grace
that even bursts of speech and laughter cannot spoil.
It is part and parcel of the words we need to hear in
order to fully exist, and of an appearance and a counte¬
nance that encourage communication. Without silence,
there would be no speech.
There is always a moment when time's tensions
slacken and when space retires. We seize this moment
from the intensity of a beloved face or in the profound
harmony that unites us with the contours and rhythm
of a landscape. It is an instant of silence and an instant of
presence in the tumult of life solitude, perhaps, but
without isolation or dislocation.
The contemplative side of our being, which the tur¬
moil of the day has not destroyed, then holds sway and
lets us feel the continuity of our being with the elec¬
tive realities that people our inner lives. All the mystics
have lived with this experience in the background. But
the man whose only faith is in man and whose only
love is in the world, is not necessarily deprived of the
certainty of such a bonding. It is possible in the silence
of stilled passions.
