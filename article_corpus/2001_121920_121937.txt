Beating global warming
with nuclear power?
The nuclear power industry claims it holds the keys to reducing the greenhouse gases
responsible for global warming. Opponents are striking back with their own arsenal of
facts and figures
or several years, the nuclear energy
industry has attempted to cloak itself in
different ecological robes. Its credo:
nuclear energy is a formidable asset in
the battle against global warming
because it emits very small amounts of
greenhouse gases. This stance, f i r s t
presented in the late 1980s when the
extent of the phenomenon was still the
subject of controversy, is now at the heart
of policy debates over how to avoid
droughts, downpours and floods.
To d a y, few would deny the existence
of global warming and the fact that we
have to do something about it.The latest
report by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC),released in
November 2000, revised its own
predictions upwards, forecasting that
temperatures will rise between 1.5 and
4.5°C by the end of the century.
Human activity obviously shares part
of the blame for global warming,s t a r t i n g
in wealthy countries where industrial
development began in the mid-19t h
c e n t u r y. It is estimated that in these
c o u n t r i e s, carbon dioxide (CO2) and
methane emissions increased by 70
percent and 145 percent respectively in
150 years. Gathered in Kyoto (Japan) in
1 9 9 7 , representatives of 38 industrialized
countries signed a protocol under which
they agreed to cut their overall CO2
emissions by 5.2 percent of the 1990 level
by 2012. The European Union is to
account for 8 percent of the cuts, t h e
United States 7 percent, Japan and
Canada 6 p e r c e n t . Russia was let off the
hook because its economy collapsed
after 1990. The effort should not be
scorned.Studies show that if the trends
of the past decade continue, t h e s e
countries will emit 20 percent more CO2
instead of 5.2 percent less by 2012.
But what’s the best way of reaching
these goals? The solutions range from
using more nuclear power, d e v e l o p i n g
renewable energy sources, encouraging
m a s s - t r a n s i t , implementing stricter
energy-saving measures and planting
f o r e s t s. “ There are all kinds of ways to cut
C O2 e m i s s i o n s,” says Antoine Bonduelle,
founder of the Climate Action Network,
which includes 320 non-governmental
organizations worldwide. “ Th e
negotiations become extremely complex
if all of these options are discussed at
o n c e.” So much so that during a

conference in The Hague in November
2000,the 180 countries failed to reach a
consensus on how to apply the Ky o t o
protocol.
Improve living standards
without suffocating the planet
The main focus in the battle to cut
greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce
energy consumption, which accounts for
approximately 80 percent of the
d i s c h a r g e s.The primary culprits are coal
and oil burned by electrical power plants,
heating installations and cars.The battle
is all the fiercer because in the
developing countries—which emit an
average of 0.4 tonnes of carbon per
inhabitant per year compared with three
tonnes in the OECD—growth
requirements will lead to a rapid increase
in emissions.A recent report by Georges
C h a r p a k , winner of the 1992 Nobel prize
for physics,warns that “if China pursues
its current rate of industrial growth, by
2050  it will emit eight times more carbon
dioxide than the entire industrialized
world does today.”
Seeking to avoid a situation where
badly needed improvements in living
standards go hand-in-hand with rising
greenhouse gas emissions, rich countries
agreed at the Kyoto summit  to transfer
more environmentally friendly and
efficient technology (see box).
In this context,nuclear power seems
like a simple, e f ficient solution that is
all the more attractive because it does
not call into question our societies’
energy intensive development patterns.
The world’s seven richest countries,
which include the nations with the
highest number of nuclear power plants,
advocated this solution way back in 1989
at a G7 summit. “ We recognize that
nuclear energy plays an important role
in cutting greenhouse gases,” t h e y
proclaimed.
After the Kyoto summit, t h e
European Union published in 1999 a
study called “ D i l e m m a ” , a title that
speaks for itself. European experts
sketched three different scenarios on
C O2 r e d u c t i o n , with nuclear power
accounting for varying shares of total
energy output.They concluded that the
EU has no chance of delivering on its
promise unless Europe boosts its nuclear
power capacity by the equivalent of 80
percent of its current capacity. Th e
European Atomic Fo r u m , a nuclear
industry trade group, claims that “in a
single year, nuclear power has helped to
avoid emitting 1.8 billion tonnes of CO2
in the world, w h i c h , for Europe, i s
equivalent to the emissions of 200
million cars.” Meanwhile, the OECD’s
Nuclear Energy A g e n cy published a
report in 1999 based on the hypothesis
of tripling nuclear capacity by 2050. If
that were to happen, C O2 e m i s s i o n s
would drop by6.3 billion tonnes a year
according to its calculations.
At first sight, the figure sounds
convincing enough to sweep aside any
protest from the anti-nuclear camp.

But emissions from human sources are
increasing by 22 billion tonnes a year
and despite planned restrictions in
developed countries, they are projected
to rise by 60 percent globally between
now and 2020! This would bring them
to 35 billion tonnes. While an annual
reduction of 6.3 billion tonnes 30 years
down the road should not be shunned,
i t ’s not enough to convince anti-
nuclear advocates that this source of
energy is the miracle solution to global
w a r m i n g.
Beyond expert circles, s c e n a r i o s
giving nuclear energy a new lease on
life are running into mounting
opposition from society at large, s h a k e n
by the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe and
growing concern over how to manage
nuclear waste. Almost all developed
countries have put their nuclear
programmes on hold. In 2000, not a
single reactor was under construction,
on order or planned in North America
or Western Europe. To d a y, t h e
staunchest advocates of nuclear power
are in A s i a — Ja p a n , Korea and, to a
lesser extent,China and India—and in
Eastern Europe. At the end of 1999,
the Vienna-based International A t o m i c
Energy Agency counted 38 reactors in
the planning or construction stages in 14
c o u n t r i e s. Many of them are unlikely
to be commissioned because of the
economic slump in the countries that
have ordered them.
Anti-nuclear advocates also argue
that the abundance of energy allowed
by nuclear power plants discourages
energy-saving measures. F u r t h e r m o r e,
investing important sums in nuclear
energy means earmarking less for
exploring alternative energy sources.

Foundation notes that nuclear energy

reduction in CO2 e m i s s i o n s. “ Th e
United States accounts for 5 percent of
the world’s population, over 25 percent
of CO2 emissions and 29.4 percent of
n u c l e a r-generated electricity.
C o n v e r s e l y, China accounts for 21.5,
13.5 and 0.6 percent, r e s p e c t i v e l y. A
closer look at the trends between 1980
and 1997 reveals that the penetration
of non-fossil power sources [especially
hydraulic] in China during this p e r i o d
allowed that country to cut back on
only 10 million tonnes of carbon,
compared with 430 million tonnes had
Beijing adopted energy-efficiency
m e a s u r e s.”
The World Energy Council also
argues that the best way to reduce
consumption is to improve energy
e f fic i e n cy.The potential is tremendous.
Estimates suggest that savings could
reach 30 to 50 percent in Europe, and 30
to 70 percent in the United States.This
t h i n k i n g, advocated by non-
governmental organizations for a long
t i m e, is gradually winning support from
political leaders, including in Fr a n c e
(which obtains 75 percent of its
electricity from nuclear plants),where
the government has just adopted a
national plan to improve energy
efficiency.
“ For three years,w e ’ve been working
on translating the political commitments
made at Kyoto into specific measures,”
said French Environment Minister
Dominique Voynet after The Hague
c o n f e r e n c e,where she led the European
d e l e g a t i o n . “ To achieve that goal,
consumer patterns in the rich countries
will have to change and more efficient
power sources will have to be offered to
developing countries. But it will be
difficult.”

to produce heat and electricity at the
same time,recuperating up to 90 percent
of the energy produced instead of an
average 45 percent with conventional
p l a n t s. C o m b i n e d - cycle technology (a
gas turbine combined with a steam
turbine) has made tremendous strides
and offers an energy efficiency rate of
6 0p e r c e n t , while remaining cheaper than
a classic fuel-burning plant.
Individual consumers can also make
a difference. Lighting manufacturers
have calculated that the use of low-
consumption bulbs each year saves
electricity equivalent to the output of
several nuclear reactors. In the same
v e i n , household appliance and
electronics manufacturers are designing
products that guzzle less energy. A few
tenths of a kilowatt-hour of savings on a
refrigerator represents, on a worldwide
s c a l e, the output of several dozen nuclear
power plants.
L a s t l y, in addition to energy-saving
a p p l i a n c e s, research suggests that
renewable energy sources such as
h y d r o g e n , solar and wind power are
bound to acquire a new dimension in
the 21st century. To d a y, G e r m a n y ’s
windmills generate as much electricity as
four nuclear power plants. A c c o r d i n g
to the Danish  BTM-Consult, w i n d m i l l s
could soon supply over 10 percent of
the world’s electricity—half the current
nuclear output. The debate is far from
c o o l i n g.
Fi n a l l y, the anti-nuclear camp has
taken another feather out of its cap.
Mycle Schneider, head of the Wo r l d
Information Service on Energy (WISE),
points out that the nuclear sector’s CO2
emissions are far from negligible when
the whole production chain is looked
a t , not just the plants themselves. Th i s
includes  construction, e x t r a c t i o n ,
t r e a t m e n t ,c o n v e r s i o n , transport and the
stocking of waste. Taking this into
a c c o u n t , WISE calculates that for
Fr a n c e, the nuclear chain’s share of total
emissions ranges from 1.6 to 9.1 percent.
More importantly, Schneider stresses
that nuclear plants only produce
e l e c t r i c i t y, whereas our societies also
have significant heating needs.
Emissions by plants that produce both
electricity and heat would be higher
than those obtained with more effic i e n t
gas plants… The nuclear industry’s
response is being anxiously awaited. ■
