Daycare 
in colombia
             Two years ago, Luz marina mahecha started a new job at home: 
                   she looks after children while their mothers are at work. 
                       in Colombia, more than 80,000 community mothers like Luz 
               provide this kind of children’s daycare service.
Dawn, just breaking over the moun-
tains south of Bogota, illuminates 
the Ciudad Bolivar community. Luz 
Marina is already up. She has to 
take care of 13 children, but they are 
not her own. They are the children 
of her neighbours in the Caracoli 
district, left with her so their moth-
ers can go to work. In Caracoli, only 
one out of three adults has a legal 
job and the number of inhabitants 
is growing daily, due to the influx of 
displaced populations fleeing the 
rural areas, their paramilitary groups 
and guerrilla warfare. 
Luz Marina hasn’t turned forty 
yet. She decided two years ago to 
give up her dressmaker and shop 
assistant activities and devote her-
self entirely to the role of “commu-
nity mother”. When she did, she 
became part of a project initiated 
20 years ago by the Colombian 
Institute of Family Welfare, which 
organizes daycare for more than a 
million children. It keeps them off 
the streets and offers them an al-
ternative to staying at home alone 
while their parents are out. 
Some 5000 community mothers, 
like Luz Marina, provide this kind of 
daycare in the Colombian capital; 
throughout the country they num-
ber nearly 82,000. A study of ado-
lescents between the ages of 13 
and 17, conducted in Colombia by 
the 2007 Education for All Global 
Monitoring Report, revealed that 
children who benefit from such day-
care are more likely to be in school 
and less likely to repeat a year.
A new job, 
a new way of life
“When I got an offer to work with 
the Institute of Family Welfare, I 
immediately accepted. But I had 
to adapt my life and my house to 
the new situation,” says the young 
woman, her round cheeks ruddy 
from Bogota’s chilly mountain air. 
At the time, Luz Marina and her hus-
band, a construction worker, lived 
in a house built of brick and corru-
gated metal. They had to transform 
the living and dining rooms into a 
kindergarten. They painted the 
walls of the two rooms, the only co-
loured ones in the house. They also 
added red colouring to cement, to 
make surfaces look like terracotta. 
A sign hangs outside, on which is 
written the name of the daycare 
centre: “My little friends”. 
Taking care of children has given 
Luz Marina steady employment, and 
in her own home. She is spared a 
daily commute of two hours on the 
bus to get to work. Furthermore, 
she receives a stipend of 185,000 
pesos ($77) per month, on top of 
the parents’ fees, ranging from 
$3 to $5. The Institute also gives 
her a certain sum to buy food and 
supplies.

“At the end of the day, I’m exhaust-
ed. It’s not easy looking after chil-
dren of different ages. The smallest 
one, Sharon, walks, goes to the toi-
let by herself, and talks…a lot,” ex-
plains Luz Marina with a smile. 
More 
than babysitting
“By the grace of God, I’ve become 
another person from being in con-
tact with these children. I’m not 
simply babysitting for a neighbour’s 
child - they’re like my children now. 
I play with them, they make me 
laugh, they tell me what’s going on 
at home, with their families….They 
teach us so much if we make the ef-
fort to listen to them.” 
A typical day: the children arrive, 
wash their hands and eat some “bien-
estarina”, a powder the government 
distributes to prevent malnutrition, 
containing milk and other nourish-
ing ingredients. At about 9.30 a.m., 
activities begin. “We sing, we play 
and we do exercises. At about 11, 
we go have lunch.” Then, after a little 
nap, more activities, either outside 
in the garden if the weather is nice 
or inside if it’s raining. “Occasionally 
we watch some television, usually 
educational programmes for kids.” 
And every so often a priest comes 
to visit the children and teach them 
catechism. 
Even getting up at dawn does not 
faze Luz Marina: “I would like these 
little ones to learn professional skills. 
One day, later, I would like them to 
remember me as someone who did 
something for them - as some kind 
of teacher.”
