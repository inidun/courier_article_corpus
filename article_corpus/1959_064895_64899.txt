DESCENT INTO
THE FIRE-PIT
OF NIRAGONGO
In September 1958 a Belgian expedition, one of the
scientific research groups set up during the Interna¬
tional Geophysical Year, set out to explore the
volcanic crater of Niragongo which stands in the
3,000 square mile Albert National Park of the Belgian
Congo. Rising to nearly I 1,000 feet and flanked by
two extinct volcanoes, Shaheru and Baouta, it has
boulder and lava-strewn crater walls which drop down
vertically in a series of gigantic steps to a vast lake of
lava hundreds of feet below. Until recent years
it had been regarded as inaccessible because of its
beetling cliffs and the poisonous fumes which rise out
of the pit. In 1958, one of the members of the
expedition was the French volcanologist and geologist,
Haroun Tazieff who in 1948 and again in I 953. had
attempted to reach the lake. The most recent
attempt was successful. Members of the expedition
were lowered by cable to the first terrace 600 feet
below. A second descent of 500 feet brought them
to a ledge from where they were able to observe the
lake of lava at very close range, bubbling and seething
at temperatures varying between 1,000 and 1,200
degrees C. Photos, taken during the 1958 expedi¬
tion, show, above, one of the party about to descend
