Carved out of the
living rock eight
centuries ago, the
churches of Lalibela
are still a magnet for
worshippers and
pilgrims

Ethiopia's new Jerusalem
by Kassaye Begashaw
The rock churches of Lalibela, whichar hewn out of the mass of red vol-
canic tufa that makes up the high plateau of
Lasta, are a remarkable offshoot of the flow-
ering of Christian civilization in Ethiopia in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
Christianity was introduced into the
Aksumite kingdom of Ethiopia around 330
A. D. At the end of the fifth century it spread as
a result of the efforts of monks who had come
from Antioch, but the allegiance of Ethiopian
Christians went to the Coptic church.
In the ninth century, the Aksumite
kingdom disintegrated under the pressure of
Islam and the Beja invasions. Following the
gradual contraction of the Byzantine empire,
Christian Ethiopia became increasingly iso-
lated. The upheavals that followed the collapse
of the kingdom of Aksum and the shift of its
political and religious'centre southwards led to
the emergence in the twelfth century of the
Zaghawa dynasty, which reinforced ties with
the Coptic church and encouraged missionary
activity.
The new capital of the kingdom was set up
on a mountainside in the region of Lasta. Now
a small town perched at an altitude of 2, 600
metres, the monastic centre of Lalibela, named
after the Zaghawa king who excavated the
churches there, was intended to be a new
"Holy City".
A unique architectural complex
The eleven medieval churches and chapels of
Lalibela, which form two distinct groups on
either side of a mostly dried-up stream, the
Yordanos (Jordan), scarcely rise above ground
level. Four of them are monolithic. The others
are smaller and are either semi-monolithic or
underground their sites indicated to the
faithful by a façade sculpted in the rock. Each
of the two groups constitutes an organic
ensemble enclosed in a kind of surrounding
wall within which visitors are able to move
around via a network of alleys and tunnels hol-
lowed out of the tufa.
The monolithic churches, which stand in
the centre of shafts seven to twelve metres
deep, were carved straight out of blocks of
rock separated from the rest of the plateau by

trenches. Carving started at the top (the vaults,
ceilings, arches and upper windows) and con-
tinued down to the bottom (the floor, doors
and base). To allow the torrential summer rains
that affect this region to run off, the floor of the
spaces created in this way are on a slight incline.
Protruding features of the architecture, such as
roofs, gutters, cornices, lintels and window sills,
project to a varying degree depending on the
prevailing direction of the rain.
The excavation work apparently took place
in several stages, so that architects, workers and
craftsmen could work at eye level without
having to erect scaffolding. Some hewed the
monolith out of its surrounding rock, others
fashioned it. Rubble was removed via openings
such as windows and doors. Simple tools were
used-picks and levers for excavation, and
hatchets and chisels for finer details.
Rare paintings and sculpture
Probably the most impressive of Lalibela's
churches is Bete Medhane Alem (the House of
the World's Redeemer), which is 33 metres
long, 23 metres wide and 11 metres high, with a
sculpted cornice supported by 34 square pil-
lars. It is the only church in Ethiopia which has
five naves, as did the former cathedral of
Aksum, according to Father Francisco
Alvarez, the chaplain of a Portuguese embassy
to the Solomonic court in the sixteenth century.
The interior is reached by three doors
giving onto the west, north and south respec-
tively, in accordance with Christian custom.
It is built according to the basilica pattern,
with an east-west orientation, and divided
into eight bays lined with 28 pillars rising to
the semicircular arches of the ceiling.
The neighbouring church, the House of St.
Mary (Bete Maryam), which occupies a smaller
area than Medhane Alem, is nine metres high.
Its walls, which have windows in the Aksumite
style, house three naves whose special feature is
that they are covered from top to bottom with
decorative paintings representing geometrical
motifs (Greek crosses, swastikas, stars and
rosettes) and animals (doves, phoenixes, pea-
cocks, zebus, elephants and camels) and with
frescoes-mostly now destroyed-illustrating
scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary as
described in the gospels. Some specialists

believe that these paintings date from the reign
of King Zar'a Ya'kub (1434-1465). Above the
main door is a bas-relief representing two
horsemen slaying a dragon, an exceptional piece
of sculpture given the scarcity of animated
carvings in Ethiopian sanctuaries, as indeed
throughout the Christian Middle East.
Quddus Mikael (St. Michael), Bete Gol-
gotha (the House of Golgotha) and Bete
Selassie (the House of the Trinity) form an
ensemble of churches. The largest of the
three, Quddus Mikael, is harmoniously
divided up into three naves by cruciform pil-
lars. The most notable feature of Bete Gol-
gotha, a church dedicated to Christ's Passion,
is its series of seven lifesize ecclesiastics
carved out of the walls of the two naves. It
also houses, in a niche, a Christ in his tomb.
The small chapel dedicated to the Holy
Trinity (Bete Selassie) is reached through Bete
Golgotha. It is trapezoid in layout and houses
three monolithic altars. Arranged in a semi-
circle and adorned with crosses, these altars
contain cavities in their centre in which the
priest placed the Tobot (Ark of the Covenant
in Geez, the Ethiopian liturgical language)
during mass. At the back of the crypt, two
mysterious figures with their hands clasped in
prayer stand on either side of an empty niche
topped by a cross within a circle-perhaps a
representation of the Trinity.

House of the Archangels Gabriel and Raphael)

Once they were probably royal residences. A
little further on, Bete Abba Libanos contains
features which are characteristic of both the
monolithic churches and underground
churches : its four sides are separated from the
mountain by a high hollowed-out gallery that
runs round the construction, while its roof is
integral with the upper rock mass. Bete
Amanouel (the House of Emanuel) is a three-
naved basilica which displays all the features of
the classical Aksumite style.
Set apart from the other churches at the
bottom of an almost square shaft (22 x 23
metres), Bete Gyorgis (the House of St.
George) has the shape of a Greek cross. Set
on a very high base, the church contains nei-
ther paintings nor sculptures which might
distract attention from the harmony and sim-
plicity of its lines. On the ceiling, each arm of

the cross is intersected by a semicircular arch
carved out of the continuation of the pilasters
that rise from the four corners of the central
space. While the construction's lower win-
dows are in the Aksumite style, the higher
ones consist of pointed arches with fleurons
similar to those found in Bete Golgotha.
The new Holy City
In addition to its eleven churches, which are
on the World Heritage List, Lalibela contains
other, less architecturally distinguished mon-
uments whose presence helps us to under-
stand the more general significance of the
ensemble and its unity. That unity is the result
of King Lalibela's sense of organization-even
if it is unlikely that all the excavation work was
carried out solely during his reign (1190-
1225). The significance of this exceptional site
is abundantly clear from its topography and
toponymy : the stream that bisects the former
capital is called the Jordan, and a stone cross
marks the spot where John the Baptist bap-
tised Jesus.
Christ's tomb in Bete Golgotha, the House
of the Cross (Bete Masqual), the House of the
Consecrated Bread (Bete Lehem), Adam's
Tomb, and the platform in front of the House
of the Archangels Gabriel and Raphael which
local people call"Pilate's Pretorium"-all these
monuments concentrated in a single spot sug-
gest that Lalibela was intended to be a replica of
the Holy City of Jerusalem, which was taken
by Saladin in 1187, and which could not at the
time be visited by pilgrims because of the
Third Crusade, t
