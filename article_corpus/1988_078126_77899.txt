Towards the scientific
re-awakening
ofAfrica

Dependence that is detrimental to progress
Africa is going through a development crisis "influenced by the
emergence of new problems of exceptional gravity	 It is
becoming increasingly difficult to maintain broad sectors of the
population above subsistence level	 The food and health
»situation is becoming more and more precarious. Infant
mortality is rising. In ecological terms, Africa's environment is
deteriorating." This is the alarming opening statement of "The
Kilimanjaro Declaration", adopted on 15 July 1987 by the
Second Conference of Ministers Responsible for the
Application ofScience and Technology to Development in
Africa (CASTAFRICA II), organized by Unesco in Arusha,
United Republic ofTanzania. How can this situation be
rectified? "The only way to improve the standards of living of
the peoples ofAfrica", the Declaration goes on, "is to take
practical action to develop their scientific and technological
capabilities in a spirit ofunity and solidarity." In June 1987 a
First Congress of African Scientists, convened by the
Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in Brazzaville (Congo),
was attended by eminent scientists from Africa and from other
regions of the world. These initiatives underline the fact that
Africa's prime strategic objective is to reduce its dependence in
the field of science and technology, and to develop its immense
economic, social and cultural potential. Published on the
following pages are extracts from two documents submitted to
CASTAFRICA II: the first, from the OAU, outlines the science
and technology situation in Africa today; and the second, from
Unesco, is concerned with the development problems of the
African continent.
AFTER two decades of in¬
dependence enjoyed by
the majority of African
States, it is apparent that, despite
the efforts of governments and
populations, they "are not yet in
control of the phenomena associ¬
ated with the development of the
contemporary world, the concep¬
tual systems and the general con¬
ditions governing life on earth
that will most strongly affect their
future", in the words of Alioune
Diop, Senegalese founder of the
Présence Africaine publishing
company in Paris. None of the
States has acquired the basic
minimum of scientific and tech¬
nological know-how needed to
bring about the required econo¬
mic breakthrough.
It is clear that by dint of having
looked to the outside and having
organized itself in terms of and for
the benefit of the outside world,
Africa is now in a situation of
economic and technical depen¬
dence. Admittedly, the concept
of technical dependence has
many meanings which range from
mutual trust to subordination.
Where there is mutual trust we
can only be glad: such a situation
engenders prosperity and de¬
velops scientific co-operation. In
the latter case, however, depend-

and technological deficit, in certain
sectors the most advanced techni¬
ques are in use. Pharmaceuticals are
being manufactured as a result of
research carried out on the medicin¬
al properties of the brazzeana plant

ence is based on a unilateral and
asymmetrical relationship, in
which one party, Africa, is unfor¬
tunately in a markedly inferior
position.
In the meantime, new disci¬
plines are developing in the indus¬
trialized countries, such as gene¬
tic engineering, robotics, micro¬
computing, remote-sensing,
photo-electric and aerospace
technology and microbiology.
The developed countries con¬
tinue to lead the world in all these
fields. Ninety-five per cent of all
research and development takes
place in these countries. The con¬
sequences of this state of affairs
are unimaginably far-reaching.
What is Africa's place in this
changing situation? Admittedly,
some progress has been made in
the past few years. The reports
National Science Policies in Africa
and Survey on the Scientific and
Technical Potential of the Coun¬
tries of Africa, submitted by Un¬
esco in 1974 to the First Confer¬
ence of Ministers Responsible for
the Application of Science and
Technology to Development in
Africa (CASTAFRICA I), reveal
that at the time Africa had nearly
700 research institutions em¬
ploying more than 6,000 full-time
researchers, 5,000 part-time re¬
searchers and some 20,000 tech¬
nicians. In all, approximately
30,000 people were engaged in
research and experimental de¬
velopment.
Discoveries made in the field of
biology in Africa are already in¬
fluencing medicine and food pro¬
duction to a considerable extent.
In Cameroon, the establishment
of an industrial unit for manufac¬
turing medicines was one of the
results of the research carried out
on the medicinal properties of the
Pentadiplandra brazzeana plant
family. Dr. Thomas Wandji, au¬
thor of this research, acknow¬
ledges that "given the efficacy and
considerable originality of the
brazzeana, medicines based on
these substances might well cre¬
ate a considerable stir all over the
world". Our geneticists are en¬
deavouring to improve our natur¬
al, animal and vegetable re¬
sources and are studying ecosy¬
stems and pollution problems.
Our governments have allocated
substantial funds to cover running
costs and investments, despite the
difficult economic climate.
I Funding research
Nevertheless, Africa is still a
consumer of science and technol¬
ogy and its lack of progress in
several areas is a cause of con¬
cern. Fewer than ten African
States are close to the target set by
the United Nations with regard to
the training of researchers, name-'
ly 230 research workers to every
million inhabitants. In 1980,
Egypt had 500, Ghana 474, Tuni¬
sia 560, Senegal 240, Kenya 160,
Côte d'Ivoire 155 and the Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya 103. In some
cases, up to 60 per cent of them
were foreigners. In 1974, out of a
total of 2,978,204 scientists and
engineers worldwide, 94.1 per
cent were working in the indus¬
trialized countries, 5.8 per cent in
the developing countries and 0.1
per cent in the least developed
countries. Of the 12,000 resear¬
chers in Africa, only 9 per cent
work in research, and 55 per cent
in higher education.
The financing of research also
calls for a number of comments.
In 1978, the average per capita
expenditure on research and de¬
velopment was 2.75 dollars in the
developing countries (0.38 per
cent of GNP), as against 147 dol¬
lars in the Organization for Eco¬
nomic Co-operation and De¬
velopment (OECD) countries (2
per cent of GNP) and 186 dollars
(2.8 per cent of GNP) in the East
European countries.
Many African States do not
have a separate item for research
in their budget. However, the in¬
ternational conference held in
Lagos (Nigeria) in 1964 recom¬
mended that approximately 0.5
per cent of GNP be allocated to
research and development and
that this amount be periodically

reassessed. At present, Côte
d'Ivoire allocates to R&D 0.6 per
cent of its GNP. In 1978, Senegal
spent 33 per cent of its budget on
education, training and culture
and 1.2 per cent of its GNP on
scientific and technical research.
In Tunisia, the funds spent on
research are already equivalent to
more than 3 per cent of the gov¬
ernment's revenue. Elsewhere,
the rate varies between 0.1 per
cent and 0.3 per cent.
With regard to scientific in¬
formation and documentation
and extension work, there is no
lack of impediments. In Science
and the Factors of Inequality, a
collective work published by Un¬
esco in 1979, Ahmad Y. al-Has-
san, Rector of the University of
Aleppo (Syrian Arab Republic),
asserts that in the Arab and Mus¬
lim countries only six university
libraries have more than 200,000
volumes each. Researchers are
obliged to travel around " ... to
those distant lands where know¬
ledge is developed", according to
the Beninese philosopher Paulin
Hountondji. At a symposium
organized in Yaounde
(Cameroon) in 1980 by the Afri¬
can Intellectual Property Orga¬
nization (OAPI), it was pointed
out that a great many exploitable
patents covering African pro¬
ducts were gathering dust in files:
technical information does not
circulate properly, nor, alas, is it
used to good effect.
i Shortage of equipment and
' personnel
The field of computer technol¬
ogy makes an interesting case
study. In Africa the supply of
equipment was initially unco¬
ordinated. Subsequently the
situation improved considerably,
especially in Algeria and Tunisia.
However, the proportion of GNP
devoted to computer technology
in these two countries is still
small.
In 1979, according to a survey
by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) in
144 African institutions, the num¬
ber of computers was as follows:
99 in North Africa, 29 in West
Africa, 25 in Central Africa, and
104 in East Africaa total of 257.
The implementation of Africa's
Priority Programme for Econo¬
mic Recovery (1986-1990) calls
for the effective and widespread
use of computer technology.
The "brain drain" of trained
scientists and technicians is
another serious problem. The
reasons for this are well known:
unsatisfactory working conditions
and research facilities, low salar¬
ies, lack of career prospects, and
the low esteem in which research¬
ers are held. Many qualified can
didates, facing the prospect of un¬
employment, no access to facili¬
ties and information or personal
fulfilment, either move to the in¬
dustrialized countries, or accept
administrative posts in which
their university training and their
skills are put to very little use.
Between 1962 and 1967, 70,000
trained professionals from de¬
veloping countries settled in the
United States. Each year, 10,000
intellectuals leave the Arab coun¬
tries for countries with high tech¬
nological and industrial potential.
This phenomenon has been refer¬
red to as "transfer of technology
in reverse". It is estimated that
between 1960 and 1972 the under¬
developed countries trained some
227,000 specialists for three in¬
dustrialized countries: the United
States, the United Kingdom and
Canada.
Science is becoming increasing¬
ly costly, with the result that the

Medical science is highly developed
in Africa, particularly some of its
most advanced techniques. Left,

^ (Central African Republic).
African States are finding it very
difficult to finance research and
the requisite facilities. For exam¬
ple, in order to develop computer
technology in the Congo, the
seventy-five projects adopted will
require approximately 2,600
months of planning and nearly
29,000 hours of tests over five
years, and will cost approximately
1,400 million CFA francs.
Moreover, there is a shortage of
computer personnel.
The technology gap
The problems of development
have sparked off a great debate in
Africa. If this debate is confined
to Africa's slow technological
progress, the following points
emerge:
the lack of "political will" to
organize and promote scientific
development; this is often appa¬
rent in the absence of science
policy;
society's low regard for resear¬
chers; the absence in most cases
of a statute defining their status in
the national public service; the
intolerance shown towards them,
which must be seen as one of the
causes of the brain drain; the lack
of dialogue between scientists and
government, which creates block¬
ages detrimental to the develop¬
ment of science in Africa; .
the fact that the content of, and
present trends in, science and
technology in Africa still depend
very largely on external needs and
interests, particularly those of
multinational companies.
History repeatedly shows that
no country has developed signifi¬
cantly without a basic minimum
of research, science and tech¬
nology. In the changing socio¬
economic pattern of the modern
world, scientific advances and
technological inventions have
made an immense contribution to
the development of the produc¬
tive forces, which have brought
improvements to people's work¬
ing and living conditions.
Tremendous progress was made
throughout Europe, North
America, Japan, Australia, New
Zealand and even in some coun¬
tries that were in the process of
industrialization, so that many
Africans are now amazed at the
scientific progress and technolo¬
gical achievements of those coun-
21

Although "enrolment in higher
education has increased eightfold
since 1960", seven African countries
still have no university. Moreover,
too few students are graduating in
scientific and technical subjects, and
there is a shortage of suitable equip¬
ment and qualified teachers. Right,

tries, forgetting that these great
innovations, far from being for¬
tuitous, are simply the result of
human beings' determination to
master the environment in which
they live by giving full rein to
their natural curiosity and
creativeness.
In its present state, Africa must
develop or perish. It can no lon¬
ger allow millions of its children
to languish and vegetate in in¬
sanitary hovels, threatened by
every affliction, while it possesses
vast potential waiting to be de¬
veloped.
Despite the problems which
assail it from every side, Africa
cannot sacrifice its future to short-
term requirements. The prime
strategic objective in the field of
science and technology must be to
reduce its absolute dependence.
There are several reasons for
doing so: firstly, economic
reasons. African States are sink¬
ing deeper into debt every day
and are constantly increasing the
deficit of their balance of
payments. The lack of skilled
manpower and servicing possibili¬
ties add greatly to the cost of
maintaining imported equip¬
ment, and foreign technical assist¬
ance is not cheap.
One consequence of this de¬
pendence is, of course, the power
that it gives to countries exporting
science and technology to deter¬
mine the policy of under¬
developed countries. For exam¬
ple, they can erect strong protec¬
tionist barriers against those
countries, which may also be
forced to purchase machines and
other goods exclusively from one
specific supplier. Many African
governments lack the institution¬
al and technical resources which
would enable them to make an
informed choice between the
different technologies available
to them. They are often subjected
to commercial and political press¬
ure so that immediate concerns
take precedence over long-term
provisions.
Towards self-reliance
Will Africans have a place in
the world of the year 2000?
Whether we take the year 2000 or
the year 2050, we can achieve a
better future only if we create the
components from which it will be
built, and create them now. A
number of major changes is
essential.
In July 1979, the Heads of State
and Government of the Organiza¬
tion of African Unity (OAU)
meeting in Monrovia made a
commitment to "put science and
technology in the service of de¬
velopment by reinforcing the
autonomous capacity of our coun¬
tries in this field". Science and
technology are among the sectors
which are given a prime position
in Africa's Priority Programme
for Economic Recovery (1986-
1990). The Lagos Plan of Action
(1980-2000) called on African
States to invest sufficient re¬
sources in the promotion of
science and technology.
How can this be achieved? Two
approaches are possible. One
would be to induce Africans to
create at all costs, to reinstate,
develop, promote and make sys¬
tematic use of their own endoge¬
nous scientific and technological
knowledge. The other approach
would seek to master the use of
scientific and technological know¬
ledge from outside Africa and to
assimilate it.
The first approach in isolation
would lead to autarchy, which
would be fatal, for in order to
progress, science needs inputs
from home and abroad. The
second approach would lead to
mimicry, the harmful consequ¬
ences of which are well known,
The ideal middle course would
take account of the need to re¬
main rooted in one's home
ground while becoming receptive
to the outside world. According
to the Lagos Plan of Action "Afri¬
ca must cultivate the virtue of self-
reliance. This is not to say that the
continent should totally cut itself
off from outside contributions.
However, these outside contribu¬
tions should only supplement our
own efforts".
Science and technology func¬
tion most effectively when fed by
contributions from home and
abroad. For that reason, Recom¬
mendation 4 of CASTAFRICA I
(1974) emphasized the need for
each country to establish
appropriate machinery to be re¬
sponsible for the elaboration of a
national science policy and cap¬
able of promoting genuine re¬
search for development and en¬
couraging a spirit of creativity and
innovation.
A strategy for success
Success comparable to that en¬
joyed by Japan since the Meiji
period is possible in Africa, but it
is held in check or even thwarted
by a number of obstacles. The
internal consolidation of nations
which are often disparate, as a
result of frontiers imposed by the
colonial powers, seems to have
led to overdue emphasis being
given to the political aspects of
every problem, in the sense that
winning and keeping power take
precedence over technical effi¬
ciency. This is compounded by
the almost universal indifference
shown towards scientists and
cultural figures. These negative
factors have all been responsible
for poor results: the insignificance
of research centres and the abs¬
ence or inconsistency of policies
for culture and science.
The fact must be recognized
that modern research requires a
developed productive base which
we Africans do not yet possess.
Research in our States, at pre¬
sent, is essentially colonial in
character and outward-oriented,
an inheritance from the past. It is
not directed towards satisfying
the essential needs of the peoples
of Africa. The products of our
research centres are not for our
own consumption; these centres
are still concerned with improving
the quality and the profitability of
products for export. Research
topics, funding, staff, almost
everything comes from abroad,
and in some cases returns there.
In order to remedy this situa¬
tion our States must decisively re¬
direct research towards satisfying
not only material but also cultural
objectives. Pure and applied re¬
search must seek to increase self-
sufficiency in all areas, and to
mobilize all material and human
resources for development.
All such goals are conceivable
if the political will exists at the
highest level to develop a science
and technology policy worthy of
the name and to establish planned
objectives and a strategy for
achieving them.
