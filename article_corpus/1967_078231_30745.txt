Twinkling lights in the fading glow of sunset give a fairy-like air to this remarkable photograph
of Red Square, Moscow. The square and the wall and towers of the Kremlin (on left) are symbols
of Moscow familiar even to those who have never been there. With its churches, palaces and
nearly one and a half miles of encircling walls, the Kremlin is the ancient historical, cultural and
architectural centre of Moscow as well as the seat of government in the U.S.S.R. Silhouetted in
background is Moscow's historical museum. In 1947, Moscow celebrated its 800th anniversary.

REFLECTIONS ON SOVIET CULTURE
by Sergei Gerasimov
E.
ACH of us who lives in the
twentieth century, even if endowed
with a very ordinary memory, preser¬
ves an infinite number of images and
ideas that are contradictory, involved,
SERGEI GERASIMOV has had a dis¬
tinguished career as a film director and
as an actor. Many of his films have
gained awards at Soviet and international
film festivals. A recent production, "The
Journalist," for which he also wrote the
script, was awarded first prize at the 1967
Moscow Film Festival. Sergei Gerasimov,
who ¡s a People's Artist of the U.S.S.R.,
directed "The Silent Don", a film based
on the famous novel by Mikhail Sholokhov.
tragic and splendid, for the twentieth
century has compressed events
upheavals and discoveries with an
energy hitherto unknown in history.
The term "culture" if we leave aside
the dictionary definition, includes a
great number of concepts and ideas
and is interpreted in many different
ways by different people. Still, man
Is inclined to see in this word his
supreme possession, that which
remains to him as a reward for all his
work, sufferings and searchings, that
which is handed down from generation
to generation with the spontaneous
and lofty purpose of improving the
human race.
The materialist view on life does
not, however, claim this process must
be naively straight-forward, each
successive advance making progress
easier. The advance, grim and com¬
plicated, brings mankind up against
bitterly brutal conflicts and contra¬
dictions, including tragedies such as
the two world wars, especially the
second, which took a toll of tens of
millions of lives.
Nevertheless, the advance continues,
gaining more and more momentum.
To us who are trying to build a
socialist society it is an enormous help n-j
to realize that we are doing it for all / I
men.
It so happens that I have devoted

more than 40 years of my life to film¬
making, that phenomenal art born of
the twentieth century, inseparable from
scientific and technical achievements
and part and parcel of the mainstream
of modern life.
Perhaps the best way to get a true
picture of our age might be to view
one after another, all the great films
of the 20th century, from Griffith's
"Intolerance" and Eisenstein's, "Battle¬
ship Potemkln" to the pictures of 1967.
Naturally, the cinema could not have
performed this historic feat if It did
not rely on the complex nature of the
other arts that produced the synthetic
essence of the cinema and gave It
life. Consequently, film-makers, giving
the truth its due, never forget that
literature is the father of all the arts,
and music their mother.
When I go back in thought to the
sources of Soviet culture, I see, along
with men who were close to me
professionally, besides 25-year-old
Eisenstein, the gigantic figure of Maya-
kovsky, his contemporary, and 18-year-
old Shostakovich.
Their generation started life along
with the many millions who had just
crossed the threshold into our great
era.
Here it would be well to recall what
Czarist Russia was like in the opening
years of the 20th century, an empire
sprawled across two continents, from
the Baltic and Black Seas to the
Pacific.
When I close my eyes on a sleep¬
less night, the memory that recorded
childish impressions for my whole life
brings back a picture of the fat police¬
man who stood on the corner of
Malakhovskaya Street in Ekaterinburg,
where I was born, and the street itself,
knee-deep in mud in spring and
autumn. I recall the houses of the
merchants as they stood jutting up
in the midst of wretched hovels.
Those houses resembled chests of
drawers, filled with bed-bugs and fetid
stupidity, with the arrogance and
quivering flesh of somnolent gluttons.
I recall the village where I spent the
years of my childhood, with its com¬
pletely natural economy, where each
fed and clothed himself and his family
from what his pitiful farm could pro¬
duce.
So it went all over the country,
with the exception of a few cities
where living conditions came up to
the modern standards of amenities in
the age of steam and electricity.
Towering over all this were ancient
Moscow and St. Petersburg, the re¬
splendent capital of the Russian
empire and the home of Russia's
wealthiest landowners where, side by
side with the glitter of court society,
there arose a great national culture
that gave mankind such men of genius
as Dostoyevsky, Pushkin, Tolstoy,
Chekhov, Gogol and Shevchenko.

known to the Czar's officials and quite
unknown to the city dwellers, were
tens of millions of men and women in
tree-bark shoes and homespun cloth¬
ing. And still farther away were the
alien folk, whom even the Czarist
governors who ruled them could not
make out. To the man in the street
these distant people were no more
than geographic elements and not
human beings of different races with
their own soul or mind or heart. They
viewed them as objects without feel¬
ings, without language or alphabet.
All this is what Russia inherited
when Czarism collapsed. The Octo¬
ber Revolution decided the history of
our country. It set out on a new road.
Here is where the sacramental
question arose, the question Romain
Rolland later formulated as "On whose
side are you, masters of culture?" To
the Russian intelligentsia's honour, it
had the insight, spiritual force and
common sense to make its choice.
Our people will» never forget that side
by side with them were such giants
as Pavlov and Timiryazev, Blok and
Mayakovsky, Meyerhold and Stanislav¬
sky, Petrov-Vodkin and Nesterov.
In all justice, it should be noted that
many of Russia's prominent intellec¬
tuals were unable immediately to
understand and accept in their hearts
the immense changes taking place in
their native land. They were frighten
ed by the austere and inexorable early
years of the Revolution and left. Later,
many of them returned home. Others
remained abroad to the end of their

besides Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev,
the Central Asian republics, once the
most remote border regions of the
Russian empire. Whether writers,
artists or businessmen, they often
return from Central Asia deeply
impressed by what they saw even in
the shortest of visits. It may be that
the phenomenal flowering of these
Central Asian republics is the most
striking testimony to the moral as well
as economic victory of our country.
We ourselves regard this achievement
as our greatest. To us it is all the
more revealing because we know what
those places were like before.
Any list of the most respected,
world-famous Soviet artists, writers
and musicians would be extremely
long, but the very first names would
certainly include the brilliant Kirghiz
novelist Chingiz Aitmatov, son of a
shepherd; the poet and war hero
Musa Jalil; the truly amazing poet and
philosopher Rasul Gamzatov; the inex
haustibly gifted Armenian painter Mar-
tiros Saryan and his fellow countryman
Aram Khachaturyan, and Kara Karaev
of Azerbaijan.
Having mentioned a few names,
without which what I want to say might
seem abstract, I think it would be well
to consider how it came about that an
illiterate country, condemned to spend
its long winter nights by the light of
rush candles, was able to make such
a colossal leap forward. Naturally,
when the country embarked on its
active post-revolutionary development
it progressed along with the rest of
the twentieth century in spite of the
inevitable isolation it was forced into.
The tremendous thirst for knowledge
awakened by the cultural revolution in
the twenties made the Soviet citizen
perhaps the most avid reader in the
world. With books having remained
silent friends and companions of each
individual reader, a special Soviet way
of living with literature has come into
being. The readers' conferences held
regularly at hundreds of thousands of
libraries and factory and rural recrea¬
tion centres, and poetry readings
before audiences of many thousands
are but two of the new features char¬
acteristic of our culture.
On several occasions I have accom¬
panied visitors from abroad to such
gatherings. I could not help feeling
proud of the impression our readers"
conferences made on them: The
heated arguments, keen observations,
ability to understand the literary impli¬
cations below the surface, and the
appreciation of style.
This brings to the forefront an
important feature of modern social
man, in the best meaning of the word,
and that is his unselfish interest in
matters of common concern, and his
sense of responsibility for the moral
achievements, in which each sees a

SOVIET CULTURE (Continued)
Controversies on the borders of realism in art
major fruit of his labours. It is not
only houses, factories, shops and
handsome streets and cities that
reveal the level of a civilization. The
most important yardstick is man him¬
self, his code, of ethics, his attitude
to the world, to good and evil, to
strength and weakness, to the goal
of life. That is what the reader looks
for in the books he reads, the plays
he attends, the new paintings and films
he sees.
At this point the eternal debate
arises: what is art, what is its purpose?
The debate arises with greater and
greater force at every new dividing
line in history. Many are inclined to
accuse us of utilitarianism, of being
didactic, even of distorting the sacred
predestination of art by applying it to
the practical needs of society, to the
organization of government itself.
That is both true and not true.
It would be hypocritical and false to
dismiss that view I would not call
it an accusation out of hand. We
have no intention of either cancelling,
or evasively skirting, the specific fea¬
tures of our way of life.
Yes, all of us writers, artists, musi¬
cians and film-makers are co-operat¬
ing in a gigantic programme on which
we have embarked at the call of our
hearts and in the interests of our own -
people and other peoples who conti¬
nue to be threatened by a great num¬
ber of dangers derived from brutality
and despotism.
The programme is so important to
us and is so much a part of the
substance and content of our life
that most of us are unable to draw
a strict dividing line between our per¬
sonal concerns and the concerns of
society. Speaking without any of the

propagandiste accentuation which the
modern man so abhors, and within the
framework of discovering the truth, a
man's work, if he is completely
engrossed in it, is an integral part of
his private life, sometimes much more
so than purely family matters.
It is this heightened personal atti¬
tude on the part of everyone working
in the extensive sphere of culture, a
sphere encompassing all the meridians
and parallels of our vast country, that
makes up the essence of our attitude
to the importance and significance of
one or another artistic phenomenon.
In our professional environment it
is natural that there should be contro¬
versies concerning form, the borders
of realism, and the breadth of its
shores. I see no harm at all in the
fact that the debate often reaches a
high pitch of intensity.
It Is because they are seemingly so
innocent and bloodless that literary
and artistic battles often grow aggra¬
vated with remarkable ease. Here
the youth naturally play a special part.
Doing their duty in the succession of
generations, they logically act accord¬
ing to the dialectical law of "negation
of the negation."
We would be poor dialecticians if
this circumstance were to fill us with
undue fears.' We know definitely that
in the development of that law any
negation must be followed by an affir¬
mation, which will be followed by ano¬
ther negation-affirmation, since in our
concept of the world everything is
continuously developing.
That is why, while we are aiming
at the future, we cannot discard the
past with curious arrogance or infan¬
tile naivete. To us, the historical pro-
Young artists visit

these art forms
are based on

elements of light.
In the past few
years there has been

cess is continuous. This was clearly
formulated by Lenin in his argument
with Bogdanov concerning the attitude
to a cultural legacy.
To us, modern art draws on the
greatness of ancient and medieval art,
the Renaissance, and the art of the
recent past, in which before our eyes
there arose the brilliant figures of such
artists as Picasso, Diego Rivera and
Siqueiros, men who have never for a
moment separated their art from the
interests of humanity and who have
waged violent battles, sometimes with
themselves, for artistic truth.
Hence, to us the names of the young
poets who now tour many countries
and have become widely known in
Europe and America, the names of
Evtushenko, Rozhdestvensky and
Akhmadulina, are all signs of the
times, contemporary features of our
many-levelled culture, inseparables
connected with the interests of all
men.
Behind these poets stand the people,
who have the right both to love
them and to make demands on them
in keeping with the laws of spiritual
unity that have become the foundation
of our community. Again, this is a
special feature that may appear awk¬
ward, even unbearable, to the solipsist
artist, whose only life companion is
himself. This is a principled difference
we have no intention of either erasing
or evading. The difference lies in
the very depths of our society and
our national traditions, the traditions
of the Russian intelligentsia, which
from Pushkin and the Decembrist
poets, throughout the brilliant writings
of the nineteenth century by Gogol,
Shevchenko, Hertzen, Tolstoy and
Dostoyevsky, showed that it had insep¬
arable spiritual ties with the people.
Now the people, too, have changed.
They produce from their depths much
new talent that is shaped gradually,
in amateur groups, in factory literary
clubs, at public lecture courses on
the arts. Before you know it, you
have world-famous groups like Igor
Moiseyev's folk dance company, which
has scored a truly unprecedented suc¬
cess all over the world.
As a film-maker, it would be only
fitting if I were to pay some tribute to
cinema art in this brief survey. With¬
out beating about the bush I could
simply list the dozens of first prizes
won at international film festivals. But
what is the use of self-praise and
self-glorification? History judges us.
We are only 50 years old, a mature
age for human beings but youthful for
a country.
As I look backward, and then into
the future, I think: each of us can say
he is growing older, and that we are
all mortal, but the advantage of our
life has been that we have devoted
it to mankind's youngest cause.
