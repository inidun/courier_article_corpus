WAR ON IGNORANCE is declared in Liberia as a low-flying plane "bombards" a village with leaflets to announce the opening of a nation-wide
campaign against illiteracy. In the front ranks of this campaign are teachers of the rural schools which are now being opened throughout the
country by the Liberian Government and staffed with graduates of a teacher training centre operated near Monrovia by the Government and Unesco.

T
he World Census of Population
which is to be taken around 1960
should help to answer one of the
vitally important questions of our
time : Is the world's illiterate
population increasing, in spite of the remarkable progress
made in many countries- towards the goal of universal
primary education ?
The number of adult illiterates (people over 15 years
of age who cannot both read and write in any language)
in the world around 1950 has been estimated at about
700 million slightly over two-fifths of the world's popu¬
lation at that age level. This figure is based on an
analysis of recent census results from 75 countries,
supplemented by estimates for the other countries, using
outdated or incomplete census data, school enrolment
figures and other relevant information obtained by Unesco.
Detailed results of this study, including methods of
defining and counting illiterates and analyses of data
for some 65 individual countries, are presented in a new
Unesco publication : World Illiteracy at Mid-Century
(Monographs on fundamental education, XI, Paris, 1957).
The only previous study on this subject, comparable in
scope though not in methods, is contained in a bulletin
of the U.S. Bureau of Education published in 1929. The
authors of that study gave an estimate of 850 million
illiterates in the world 10 years of age and over. If we
Were to use the same age level of population for our 1950
estimate, we would probably arrive at a world estimate
of 800 to 840 million illiterates, thus showing apparently
very little reduction in the absolute size of the world's
illiterate population in the last 25 years or so, even though
the total illiteracy rate was estimated at 62 per cent in the
earlier study, as compared with our estimate of 43-45 per
cent for 1950.

In Turkey the number and percentage of illiterate
persons 15 years old and over at the three censuses in
1935, 1945 and 1950 were as follows : 1935 census 7.7 million
illiterates (81.3%); 1945 census 8.1 million illiterates
(71.5 %) ; 1950 census 8.8 million illiterates (68.1 %).
According to Ceylon's 1946 census, there were nearly
2.5 million illiterate persons, 5 years old and over more
than at any of the previous censuses, though the illiteracy
rate had been steadily declining, as follows : 1901 census
2.2 million illiterates (73.6%); 1911 census 2.4 million
illiterates (69.0%); 1921 census 2.3 million illiterates
(60.1 %) ; 1946 census 2.4 million illiterates (42.2 %).
In Mexico the number of illiterate persons 6 years old
and over was found to be nearly 9 million in 1950, or
about the same number as in 1930. The illiterate
population aged 10 years and over in 1940 was 7.5 million,
as compared with 7.6 million in 1900.
In Portugal, there were 2.6 million illiterate persons
15 years old and over in 1950 almost exactly the same
number as in 1900, yet the illiteracy rate had gone down
from 73.1 to 44.1 per cent.
The number and percentage of illiterates 15 years old
and over in Venezuela were, between 1936 and 1950, as
follows: 1936 census 1.2 million (61.0%); 1941 census
1.3 million (58.5%); 1950 census 1.4 million (47.8%).
The magnitude of the Illiteracy problem and its
seriousness are brought home when it is looked at on a
world scale. A measure of the problem is given by
statistics relating to the 1950 census period which show
that 90 per cent of the world's illiterates are concentrated
in 43 large countries and 54 smaller ones, all with medium
to high illiteracy rates. These countries (shown in
Table 1, as groups A and B) are mostly situated in Asia,
Africa, Central and South America, and include some of
the territories in Oceania. Another 9 per cent of the
illiterate population are found in 20 countries (Table 1,
The phenomenon of an illiterate population increasing
¿n numbers or unchanged while the illiteracy rate
goes down is by no means as uncommon as one
would think. Here are a few examples from the figures
analysed in the Unesco study. There are probably many
other cases of this kind for which we do not have the
necessary statistics. The original sources of the data
which follows are usually the official census publications
of the respective countries, the latest issues only being
cited by title in the recent Unesco monograph on
illiteracy. The latest (1950) census in Brazil shows an
illiterate population of 15.3 million persons 15 years old
and over 50.6 per cent of the total population at that
age level. In comparison, the number and percentage
of illiterates at each of three previous censuses were as
follows : 1900 census 6.3 million illiterates (65.3 % ) ;
1920 census 11.4 million illiterates (64.9%) ; 1940 census
13.3 million illiterates (56.1 %).
Thus, while the illiteracy rate for Brazil has been
steadily going down, the number of illiterates has been
steadily increasing since the beginning of the century,
undoubtedly due to the rapid growth of population not
matched by the increased provisions for the rudimentary
education of children and adults.
Much the same situation is found in Egypt, as shown
by the census figures for 1907-1947. While the illiteracy
rate went down during those 40 years from 92.8 to 80.1 per
cent, the number of illiterate persons 15 years old and
over increased steadily from 6.2 million to 9.1 million (or
possibly 9.5 million) in the same period.
Illiteracy among the population 15 years old and over
at the 1951 census in India was 80.7 per cent according to
a 10 per cent sample tabulation of the census returns.
In pre-partition India, the illiteracy rate had declined
from 93.5 per cent in 1901 to 90.4 per cent in 1931, but
the number of illiterate persons had increased from
162 million to 182 million during those 30 years.

THE GEOGRAPHY OF IGNORANCE
The world-wide scope of the problem is further seen
from figures showing the estimated size of population and
extent of illiteracy for each continent and geographical
region. In Table 2, these regions are defined as in the
United Nations Demographic Yearbook, with the excep¬
tion that the U.S.S.R. is included here with Europe and
not shown as a separate region.
The estimated extent of adult illiteracy in different
parts of the world as of 1950, is shown on the map
published on pages 18-19. It should be remembered that,
in certain countries at least, great progress has been made
in the last few years in reducing adult illiteracy, and in
such cases the map indications are not up to date.

Within the same countries, there are often striking
differences in the extent of illiteracy between the urban
and rural areas, the male and female populations, the
younger and older generations, and among various popu¬
lation groups distinguished by ethnic origin. These
differences usually point to uneven development of educa¬
tional opportunities within a country, and the need for
special attention to the education of the under-privileged
groups.
Almost invariably, higher illiteracy rates are found,
among the rural populations as compared with the urban
populations of the same country. For example, in Brazil
(1950), with a total illiteracy rate of 51 per cent, the rural
population was 67 per cent illiterate as compared with
22 per cent for the urban population and 39 per cent for
the suburban. In El Salvador (1950), with a total illit¬
eracy rate of 61 per cent, the rates for the urban and rural
populations were 35 and 77 per cent respectively. In
Venezuela (1950), the urban population had an illiteracy
rate of 30 per cent while the rural population was 72 per
cent illiterate ; and in Panama (1950), the rural popula
tion had an illiteracy rate of 43 per cent as compared
with 7 per cent in the urban areas. Even in the U.S.A.
(1952), the illiteracy rate for the rural farm population
was 5.7 per cent, while the urban and rural non-farm
populations had only about 2 per cent illiteracy.
The female population generally has a higher illiteracy
rate than the male population, particularly in those
countries with medium to high illiteracy rates. The
following are some examples of large (more than 20 per
cent) differences between the male and female illiteracy
rates.
Male, female illiteracy compared
Male Female
Malaya (1947) 	 43 per cent 84 per cent
Thailand (1947) 31 per cent 64 per cent
Turkey (1950) 	 52 per cent 83 per cent
Greece (1951) 12 per cent 39 per cent
Yugoslavia (1953) 	 15 per cent 38 per cent
Ceylon (1953) 	 24 per cent 46 per cent
Egypt (1947) 69 per cent 91 per cent
India (1951) 71 per cent 92 per cent
There are, however, a few examples of countries where
the female population has a lower illiteracy rate than the
male. For instance, in Cuba (1953), the male illiteracy rate
was 24 per cent as compared with 20 per cent for the
female population. In Western Samoa (1951), there were
only 6 per cent illiterates among the women but 23 per
cent among the men. Other examples of this kind are
found in Bermuda (1950), with 4 per cent male illiteracy
and only 2 per cent female illiteracy; and in the U.S.A.
(1952) where the illiteracy rate among men in the rural
farm areas was 7.1 per cent as compared with a rate of 4.1
per cent among women in the same areas.
Obviously the older age groups of the population in
any country are apt to have higher illiteracy rates than
the younger groups, especially where universal primary
education has been introduced only recently. The follow¬
ing figures from the Philippines census of 1948 are fairly
typical :

It is quite common to find differential illiteracy rates
among the various ethnic groups of a population. Apart
from such examples as the U.S.A. (1952), where the illit¬
eracy rates for the white and non-white populations were
1.8 and 10.2 per cent respectively, and the Union of South
Africa (1946), where the African population was 72 per
cent illiterate whereas the white population
had less than 2 per cent illiteracy, marked
ethnic differences are reported in the cen¬
suses of other countries. These include
Barbados (1946), Bermuda (1950), British
Guiana (1946), British Honduras (1946),

WALL OF ILLITERACY is gradually being pushed back in Africa by devoted men and women such as this teacher instructing an open-air class in
Southern Nigeria. Grown-ups and children come here to learn to read and write in Ibo, the local language, during a mass education campaign.

GATEWAY TO LITERACY VILLAGE, a non-governmental educational institution, at Lucknow in India, spells new hope for all who enter it.
Operated by the India Literacy Board, it trains workers who take classes around flickering oil lamps in village homes. India's drive for literacy was
recently encouraged by Indian statesman Krishna Menon, who declared: "Every citizen who cannot read or write is a blot on the other man who can."

There is naturally a direct relationship between the
growth of primary school enrolment and the reduction
of adult illiteracy in a given country over a period of time.
If all children of school age in a country attended school
for a sufficient length of time, there would of course
eventually be few adult illiterates in that country. On
the other hand, as long as a substantial proportion of the
school-age children are left out of school, the problem of
illiteracy can never be successfully resolved by recourse
only to emergency measures such as the organization of
literacy classes for adults.

HANDWRITING ON THE WALL in this Bolivian country school¬
room spells the eventual defeat of the army of illiteracy... for its recruits
are adults who never* had a chance to go to school. In Bolivia, the
Government is concentrating on improving education offered by rural
schools in order to give the country's new generation a head start
in the march to literacy. Because of the urgency of the illiteracy problem
in Latin America, Unesco has launched a ten-year major project to
extend primary education on the continent. Bolivia is a member of
the committee which will supervise the application of the project.

For example, in France, where primary education
became free in 1881 and compulsory in 1882, the illiteracy
rate rapidly declined from 16.5 per cent in 1901 to 3.3 per
cent in 1946. In the U.S.A., compulsory education laws
had been introduced in all the states by 1918; the illiteracy
rate is now down to 2.5 per cent for the country as a whole.
In Italy, compulsory education began in 1859 but did not
come into full operation until after 1904; the illiteracy
rate was nearly 50 per cent in 1901 but had dropped to
14 per cent in 1951. However, in Brazil where there is
not yet universal compulsory education, the illiteracy rate
had declined only from 65 per cent to 51 per cent between
1900 and 1950.

Historical evidence and current comparisons lead to
the conclusion that low levels of illiteracy in the
population are most often associated with an ad¬
vanced stage of industrialization. In England and Wales,
the decline of agriculturalism and of illiteracy both began
prior to the nineteenth century. By the beginning of this
century, only 12 per cent of the economically active male
population were engaged in agriculture, and only about
3 per cent of brides and grooms were signing the mar¬
riage register by mark. In Belgium, between 1866 and 1947,
the proportion of male active population engaged in
agriculture fell from 40 to 14 per cent, and the illiteracy
rate dropped from 40 to 3 per cent. In France, since
1872, the decline of agriculture has proceeded less rapidly
than in England or Belgium, yet the illiteracy rate has
been reduced from 33 per cent to about 3 per cent.
While the picture emerging from the Unesco study on
world illiteracy is on the whole encouraging showing
trends of progress in all parts of the world it gives no
grounds for complacency on the part of the world's
educational workers. Unless concerted efforts are made
continuously to bring still more of the world's children
into the schools to receive the rudiments of education
and to giving illiterate persons a chance to learn the
basic skills of reading and writing, the inevitable pressure
of population growth already experienced in many
countries may offset all the educational progress achieved
and leave just as many illiterate adults in the world of
tomorrow, if it does not actually increase their numbers.
At any rate, no one can be indifferent to the plight of
700 million people more than two-fifths of the world's
adult population who are forever handicapped in modern
society because they are unable to communicate with
their fellows by the written word.
Having assessed the magnitude of the task which
remains one of the principal objectives of Unesco's
educational programme we can only hope that the edu¬
cators, administrators and policy-makers of all countries
will rally to the effort in assuring for every man, woman
and child the right to education promised to him in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose Article 26,
states in part :
"Everyone has the right to education. Education shall
be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental
stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory..."

WOMEN'S LITERACY CLASS organized by "The Daughters of
the Nile", an Egyptian feminist movement, at Boulak, Cairo, is typical
of efforts now being made to give women a more active role in the
life of Arab countries. Illiteracy is high in Egypt (about ten million
adults or nearly eight out of ten, according to I 950 figures) and much
higher for women than for men. A I 947 census showed that the
overall figure was 80. 1 per cent and that the male and female illiteracy
percentages were respectively 68.5 and 91.3. Since 1950, follow¬
ing government campaigns, the proportion of illiterates has
dropped and educational opportunities for women have increased.
WHAT IS AN
'ILLITERATE'?
Amy efforts to find out how much illiteracy exists
in the world and where it is to be found
immediately come up against the problem of
terminology. Who is "'literate"? The concept of
literacy is very flexible. It can be stretched to cover
all levels of ability, from the absolute minimum to
write one's own name, for example to an unde¬
termined maximum.
So far there has been no general agreement on a
definition of "literacy" or "'illiteracy" applicable to all
countries and territories. In fact the United Nations
and Unesco have repeatedly pointed out in their
studies on the question the differences that exist in
national criteria of illiteracy.
The difficulty of arriving at a satisfactory common
definition is due only partly to the divergence of
national practices and traditions. A more basic cause
is the difficulty of reconciling the various concepts of
literacy. These range from the mere ability to
recognize and to write down certain words (or letters
of the alphabet hence "'analphabetism") to being able
to communicate adequately in writing with other
people and from here to the much higher level of
competence necessary to understand, to appreciate and
even to produce, literary works.
Most of the national statistics on literacy and
illiteracy are derived from population censuses.
Armed with a census schedule which includes such
questions as "Can you read and write?" or "Can you
read?" and "Can you write?", the census investigator
gets an answer from the person he is enumerating (or
from someone else answering for that person) and
enters it on his record. It is hardly possible for him
to test the validity of the answer by a detailed
examination. In most census operations, therefore,
the criterion of literacy adopted has to be more or less
a minimum one.
On the other hand, a special survey (probably using
a sampling method) on the literacy of a population
could be based on an objective test, which would
involve not only word recognition, but also compre¬
hension of a sentence or passage, and the ability, not
only to write from dictation, but also to compose a
statement in answer to a question or to some verbal
instructions. In such cases, the criterion of literacy
could be related to a so-called "functional" level, or
to a range of abilities from the minimum to a highly
functional level.
In 1948 the United Nations recommended that
literacy should be defined (for purposes of inter¬
national comparisons) as "ability both to read and to
write a simple message in any one language."
While this definition is undoubtedly suitable for
census purposes, it does not fully meet the needs of
educational surveys. It was therefore expanded
by a Committee of Experts on Standardization of
Educational Statistics, convened by Unesco in 1951.
This committee recommended the following definitions
of "literacy" and "semi-literacy":
A person is considered literate, who can both read
with understanding and write a short, simple statement
on his everyday life.
A person is considered semi-literate, who can read
with understanding, but not write, a short simple
statement on his everyday life.
Until international recommendations on the
measurement of illiteracy are generally adopted by
governments, statistical data collected and published
by them will continue to be based on different criteria
a fact which limits the international comparability
of such statistics.
