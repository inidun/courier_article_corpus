The Kyoto Protocol was endorsed at
the eleventh hour on 10 December
1998 by representat i ves of some 150
g ove rnments after adding a final point.
Since they failed to reach a consensus on
s e veral key issues, they would negotiat e
them lat e r , in particular at the fourt h
conference of the signat o ries to the United
N ations Framework Convention on Climat e
Change in Buenos Aires from 2 to 13
N ove m b e r , 1 9 9 8 . But as the conference
n e a rs , those countries are still far from
a gr e e m e n t , j u d g ing by the heat e d
discussions during a preparat o ry meeting in
Bonn last June.
Under the Kyoto Protocol, t h e
i n d u s t rialized countries (called the A p p e n d i x
One states) will have to cut their ove r a l l
greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent,
generally  below 1990 leve l s , b e t ween now
and the period 2008-2012. H owe ve r , t h i s
o b j e c t i ve masks a wide range of different
commitments.The United States has agreed
to cut its emissions by eight per cent, t h e
European Union (with different targets for
different member stat e s ) , Switzerland and
most central and eastern European countri e s
by eight per cent and Japan and Canada by
six per cent.R u s s i a ,Ukraine and New Zealand
will be allowed to maintain  their curr e n t

emissions leve l s. Some countries will be
p e rmitted to increase them, including Norway
by one per cent,Australia  by eight per cent and
Iceland by as much as ten per cent.
But the United Stat e s , which accounts for
a p p r ox i m ately one-fifth of the wo r l d ’s
greenhouse gas emissions, has repeatedly said
it will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol unless
c e rtain conditions are met.Washington insists
on the “meaningful part i c i p at i o n ” o f
d e veloping countries (see preceding art i c l e )
as well as on the swift establishment of an
i n t e rn ational market to trade “ e m i s s i o n s
permits”.
This system, the details of which have not
yet been ironed out,is intended to encourage
some countries to cut their emissions below the
assigned levels so that they can then “ s e l l ”t h e
d i f f e r e n c e .T h at would entitle major energy
c o n s u m e rs such as the United States and
countries which would find it very expensive
to cut emissions, like Ja p a n , to “ bu y ” the ri g h t
to continue polluting at home from other
countries.
Their aim is to safeguard industri a l
competitiveness by avoiding costly outlays to
reduce emissions and, in some cases, t o
preserve an energy-guzzling lifestyle.
Sources close to the White House say the
Clinton administration is hoping to meet
taken any action at home—then there wo u l d
be pressure on developing countries to cut
back yet again on carbon dioxide emissions,
this time on their own and at a higher price.
So what form of institutional co-operat i o n
will be available then?
The CDM does not answer this question.
It leaves the future of North-South co-
o p e r ation on climate change up in the air.
Even worse,it allows current generations in
d e veloping countries to sell off cheaper
emissions-control options today, leaving an

on the cheap
at least three-quart e rs of its Kyo t o
commitment by buying permits from other
c o u n t ri e s , especially Russia, which under
the Protocol is only required to stabilize its
emissions ten ye a rs from now at the 1990
l e ve l . In fa c t , emissions there have already
fallen due in large part to the country ’s
economic recession. S o
Russia has a surplus of
pollution credits that
does not result from a
real effort to cut
e m i s s i o n s.
When this “hot air,”
as the negotiat o rs call it,
goes on the market, it is
likely to push down the
p rice of perm i t s.T h at will
ease the pressure on the rich countries to inve s t
in more energy-efficient technologi e s. T h e
Europeans are quick to point this out in raising
doubts on the system’s long-term effective n e s s.
They cite A rticle 17 of the Kyoto Protocol,
which basically says that trade in perm i t s
should only supplement countries’efforts to
reduce their emissions but must not replace
them.
W h at will happen, they ask,when the “ h o t
a i r ” runs out and the price of permits rises on
the intern ational market, if by then in d i v i d u a l
c o u n t ries have not taken steps to reorganize
hard sectors such as transport? Europe wa n t s
to see the “ s u p p l e m e n t a ri t y ” issue at the centre
of the Buenos Aires negotiat i o n s.
S e veral observe rs say the European
c o u n t ries also fear a threat to industri a l
c o m p e t i t i veness and to the durability of their
economic model. E u r o p e
is wo rried that market
forces will eat away at their
a rsenal of energy taxe s ,j u s t
when some countries are
looking to raise them to
make up for lower labour
t a xe s , which were cut to
boost employ m e n t .
J. W. A n d e rs o n ,
an A m e rican expert on
the Protocol, s ay s ,“The Kyoto process invo l ve s
nearly eve ry gove rnment in the world and the
means by which their people power their
i n d u s t ri e s , t r a n s p o rt their goods and
themselves, heat their homes and cook their
suppers.”
G i ven the stakes and their complexity, t h e
n e g o t i ations are likely to crawl ahead at a snail’s
p a c e . But the most important thing is that they
continue. n
