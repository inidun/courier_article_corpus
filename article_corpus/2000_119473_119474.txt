Each year the people of the Malian town of Djenné put a new coating of adobe on their great
earthen mosque. A festival held to celebrate the occasion starts at dawn, at the end of Ramadan.
■
It was a feast day. The end of
Ramadan.The people of Djenné
gathered on the great square 
in front of the mosque for nine o’clock
prayers on this holy day.
The ritual drew to a close.The men
were sitting on the ground listening 
to the Imam’s sermon, spoken 
by the greatest griot (storyteller)1
a slim, alert man with a silver tongue.
His metallic voice roamed through 
the audience, seeming to probe their
reactions.
With his hands and his gaze, he took
the pulse of the crowd.
At the end of the sermon, his eagle
eye caught sight of the upraised staff of
the patriarch, who sharply struck the
ground with it three times. Everyone
listened to the sound in complete
silence.Then the storyteller prepared to
pass on the old chief’s words.
The storyteller listened to the words,
the sentences and the sounds, gathering
them for a moment in his ears, his heart
and his head.Then his tongue caressed
them, cleansed them, drew them out,
spun them, rinsed them and delivered
them to the gathering , purged of all
anguish and poison. For the spoken
word can be a pain that kills and a
dagger that scars for life.
He said:
That the north wind rises with every
dawn
And murmurs each day
And drains everything of water
That the waters of the two rivers
Flow eastward each day
He said:
That the walls have stopped weeping
That it’s time to heal
The wounds left by winter
They understood:
They turned towards the West
1. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Imam,like 
all important figures, often does not speak 
directly to the crowd but through an
intermediary, the griot.

Towards the temple of Tapama2
They called on the great fishermen
On the Karanyara3
On the Famenta
On the Kasaminta
Lords of the waves of night
On the Niomenta
On the Sininta
On the Tienda
Lords of the manatees and the 
crocodiles
They went straight through the southern
gate and on to the one opposite, the
Sory gate, and then turned east to “the
Pond of Fresh Milk”.
There were the masons
The men who mark in the sand
With wooden hands
The magic formulas
That turn into lizards
And cling to the walls
Or doves amid
The pillars.
They went to talk
To those who slap the walls
With slabs of clay
Then they went to the place where 
the two rivers meet.
The little river, the Bani,
Pretty as a little sister.

The site of Djenné has been inhabited since 250
B.C. It has always been a commercial cross-
roads between the desert and the savannah, on
the tra n s - S a h a ran ca ravan routes which vehi-
cled the gold trade. From the 15th century on,
Djenné also became a centre for the spread of
Islam. Almost 2,000 traditional adobe houses
with Arab decoration have survived. They are
built on hillocks to escape flooding by the Bani
and Niger rivers during the rainy season. Djenné
was placed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in
1988. ■

4. The Bambara name for the river Niger.
5. Hoes.
And the great river, the Djoliba4
Strong as a bull.
They went off to look for all the 
Soninke, all the Songai, all the other 
peoples
To re-plaster the sanctuary
People bent with age
Who sleep in the bosom of the earth.
The chiefs used their staffs
To decree to everyone
Whatever their age or clan
That Djenné shall be and shall remain
forever.
The clay was already
Mixed with powdery rice straw
Kneaded out of millet husks and bran
Bare feet trampled it.
Bare hands worked it.
They filled all the containers
with it
Using shovels and big dabas5
And hundreds of women and men
Formed a crowd that flowed
Towards the giant walls
Of the mosque of Djenné 
the Great. ■



They took the pillars by storm
As if to climb up to heaven
Carrying buckets and baskets
As if filled with milk and honey.
They splay out their feet
On boxwood sticks stuck in the wall
Their heads between the legs of their
neighbour
Willing hands 
Take the slabs of clay
Perched on the scaffolding
Like horsemen in the sky.
But often on this heady day
People have no time
To eat or drink
Without stopping, they make do
With sachets of milk
Meatballs
and boiled rice.
Clay is everywhere
Mud is everywhere
You are 
Coated with it
From head to foot.
With his soft hands
He caressed the minaret
With slabs of clay hurled up
from below.
His body moved gracefully back and
forth
Like the wings of the Mandé pelican
Accompanied by the sobbing of the
drums
Kara will not fall.

Eyes are raised
To question
Columns and minaret
Have you been well coated?
With the finest earth?
You say in your heart of hearts
Once again
An idea greater
Than the head and the body
T h at endures and reaches up into the clouds.
A heavy silence descended on the town, in fits and starts, in
torrents, in sobs. The drums, the tall drums, the balafons and
the flutes fell silent.
Only the voice of the town crier echoed over the roofs and
the minarets, announcing mealtime.The meal is holy and is
for everyone.
