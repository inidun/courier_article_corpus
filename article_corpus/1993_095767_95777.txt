F the inhabitants of the Nicobar
Islands in the Bay of Bengal
south of Myanmar had not
remained faithful to traditional
ways ofmanaging the resources
of their ecosystem, the environment
in which they live would not have
survived for long. Some ofthe archi¬
pelago's twenty-two unequally-sized
islands are sparsely-wooded, while
others are covered with dense
forests that are home to rare tree
species. A few of them, such as Car
Nicobar and Chowra, are overpop-
ulated, but no one goes hungry and
everyone can get hold of enough
wood to build a house and a fishing
boat. According to a study carried
out by G. Prakash Reddy, professor
of social anthropology at the uni¬
versity of Tirupati (India), the bal¬
ance between forests, grasslands
and farmland is respected. When¬
ever a villager needs grass to roof
his house or wood to repair it, he
asks the island Council. Anyone
who cuts down a tree must replant
one of the same species in the same
spot. The Council recommends
burning dried coconut shells and
waste vegetable matter for cooking,
except for great feasts, when dead
wood is used. During one of the tra¬
ditional ceremonies that punctuate
the year, pigs are sacrificed so that
there are not too many of them
when food for people and livestock
becomes scarce.
The example of the Nicobar
Islands shows that, contrary to
widespread belief, some of the
planet's inhabitants did not wait
until the 1970s before starting to
take care of their environment.

Social and religious traditions on
every continent have helped to
manage nature without destroying it.
Travellers in the west African
savanna, for example, can see dense
forests or copses that have been
respected because they are sacred.
These areas, including some in
Casamance (Senegal), are currently
being studied for Unesco. Eugène
Faty, who lives in Casamance,
observed the sacred Oussouye
forest south ofDakar, which no one
is allowed to enter, on Unesco's
behalf. The fruits that grow on its
trees are untouchable. They fall to
the ground, where their seeds give
rise to dense undergrowth. Trees
and animals are strictly protected,
and may be removed only during
initiation ceremonies which take
place every twenty or twenty-five
years. If a tree must be cut down or
an animal killed, its forgiveness
must be asked first. The same tra¬
dition used to be found among the
hunters of Parakou and Save, in
northern Benin. The hunters were
also healers who maintained a close
relationship with plants and ani¬
mals, from which they made med¬
icines. Not everyone had the right to
kill a lion or buffalo. Before and after
the hunt, the privileged hunters had
to offer sacrifices which cost them
very dear, thus naturally limiting
the quantity of quarry they could
take.
READING NATURE'S OPEN BOOK
Although European settlement has
profoundly altered the quality oflife
of Australia's Aborigines, nature is
still an open book to them. With nei¬
ther watches nor calendars, they tell
the times and seasons by the blos¬
soming ofplants and trees. When the
milky-white "oyster flowers" are in
bloom, real oysters are plump, white
and ready for gathering, and when
the pinkheather in Darwin, Northern
Territory, blossoms, it means honey
is plentiful. Food is closely related to
religion. People, the earth, animals
and plants all belong within a vast
system of laws created by the ances¬
tral spirits during the "dream-time".
The honey ants of Papunya, in the
centre ofthe country, are a beneficent
reincarnation of these spirits because
they provide the Aborigines with the
sweetmeats they relish. Some foods
become totems and may sometimes
be eaten during ceremonies, which
helps regulate both hunting and
gathering. Custom requires the Tiwis
of Bathurst Island, not far from
Darwin, always to rebury a piece ofa
yam to make sure the tuber grows
back right away.
Shark fishing offthe Tonga Islands
is a ritual activity, remote from any
concern for catch size or profit, and
does not deplete the sea's abundant
resources. "Throughout the Pacific,"
writes Marie -Claire Bataille-Ben-
guigui of the French National
Museum of Natural History, "the
shark is a revered or even sacred
creature. It is, depending on the
place, the incarnation ofeither gods
or ancestors". In the Tonga Islands,
the shark is considered to be a love-
token from the deity Hina, a female
figure observed on the moon, to the
world ofhuman beings. Harpooned
or caught with fish nets or slip-knots,
the sharks are shared out, but they

cannot be sold and the pieces cannot
leave the village. Traditional fishing
methods are, however, being
replaced by more efficient, environ¬
mentally threatening techniques.
The small kingdom of Bhutan,
northeast of India, is another place
where religious beliefs help protect
the environment. A specialist who
lived there for ten years says the
people of Bhutan, steeped in Bud¬
dhist philosophy, have a profound
respect for rivers and for mountains,
some of which it is forbidden to
climb. Species that have become
extremely rare, such as the snow
leopard and the Himalayan black
bear, live in peace in Bhutan because
animals there are never killed for
sport. When black-necked cranes
migrate from Siberia or northern
Tibet to spend the winter, landing
in the fields in large flocks, the local
people, who respect the birds, con¬
sider it an excellent omen.
On the other hand, the forest has
not been spared. The cutting ofwood
for fuel and the clearing of forests
for agriculture have seriously jeop¬
ardized the ecological balance. The
government has launched an $8.9
million programme to set up exten¬
sive forest reserves and encourage
farmers to plant trees around their
property because wood supplies 98
per cent of their energy needs. A
World Bank report indicates that
overexploitation of the forest does
not seem to have alerted the local
population, which, moreover, is
increasing at a rapid rate.
It is hard to believe that the bare,
eroded, arid lands of Cochabamba
in central Bolivia supported a lush
tropical forest as recently as the
nineteenth century, who was
responsible for this act of destruc¬
tion? Trees played a major part in
Inca mythology. Michel Schlaifer, a
specialist in forestry who has been
working in Cochabamba for three
years, has written that the Incas
regarded the roots of trees as a link
with the ancestors in the world
"below", the trunk as representing
the "present" world, and the
branches as symbolizing the rela¬
tionship with the gods in the world
"above". In his History of the New
World, published in 1653, the
Spanish historian Bernabé Cobo
observed that a Spanish household
burned more wood in a day than
an Indian household burned in a
month. The Spanish cooked several
times a day whereas the Indians
prepared all their food for the day in
one go. The Indians built their
dwellings of rammed earth, while
the Spanish settlers used wood for
house frames, furniture and doors.

In addition, wooden pit-props and
other structural supports were
needed for the many mines. Later,
when the railways came, wood was
indispensable as fuel. No-one made
any attempt to plant new trees.
THE ROLE OF THE SACRED
Colonization brought with it the
system of cash crops and quick
profits, but it was not the only factor
that upset the balance between man
and nature. Some specialists argue
that the New Zealand moa (or
dinorcis), a giant bird that was
unable to flyand was an easy prey for
Polynesian hunters, became extinct
because it was not protected by a
taboo. Research in this field is con¬
tinuing in New Caledonia, where
similar reasons may explain the dis¬
appearance of the macrofauna.
According to the Zairian sociolo¬
gist Simon Mukuna, many activities
by indigenous peoples are wrongly
attributed to a desire to protect the
environment. The Baoulé of Côte
d'Ivoire, for instance, respect the trees
on their sacred mountain because
the spirits of the dead live there and
harmonymust be preserved between
them and the spirits of the forest. Is it
possible that the sacralization of
nature is the bestway to protect it? In
the summer 1992 issue oí Diogenes,
the quarterly journal of the Interna¬
tional Council of Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies (no. 159, pp. 58-
60), the Mexican philosopher Luis
Villoro writes ofAztec civilization as
follows: "Time and space were deter
mined in terms of the sacred; the
sacred pervaded their institutions,
their daily lives, their artistic cre¬
ations, and formed the basis of all
their beliefs	 The gods are a tan¬
gible presence in all things: in trees,
rivers, mountains, time and space,
and in the daily activities ofmen	
The desacralization ofnature and of
society began with transcendental
monotheism. The alienation of the
sacred was accentuated in the
Renaissance. Nature began to be seen
not as the impression and sign of
divinity, but as a manipulable object,
destined to be dominated and
moulded by man".
In Ghana forests have been pre¬
served because they are regarded
as sacred. Unesco has launched a
three-year project entitled the "Co
operative Integrated Project on
Savanna Ecosystems in Ghana",
which will study carefully preserved
sacred forests with the help of
fetishists, village communities,
farmers, women and local authori¬
ties. The aim is to reconstitute in
the surrounding area the flora that
is best-adapted to the climate and
soil. This is a good example of how
the knowledge and practices of
indigenous peoples are being pos¬
itively reassessed during the Inter¬
national Year devoted to them.
