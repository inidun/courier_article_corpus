Large international financial
agents are not necessarily
philanthropists. The less
developed countries who
turn to them for loans in an
effort to survive, have to pay
back these loans plus the interest
on them. In 1990, Third World
debt was estimated to be
US$1,355 billion. How do these
countries manage to meet debt-
repayment instalments? By get¬
ting the most out of their natural
resources through logging, min¬
ing, oil extraction and ranching,
because only massive exports can
provide them with the hard cur¬
rency they need. The trouble is,
the resources are not exploited
rationally. Furthermore, what little
capital is available for investment
tends to be put into projects yield¬
ing short-term returns, which

exchanges are a way ofalleviating
their external debt burden and pro¬
tecting their "natural capital". But
this complex mechanism is still in its
initial stages.

means that there is little opportu¬
nity for studying their possible
environmental impact. It is easy
enough to maintain that things
will be "put right" later. Ideally,
these projects should be jointly
discussed by environmental spe¬
cialists, economists and bankers.
However, it is difficult to bridge
the gap between the ideal situa¬
tion and the need to meet daily
survival requirements.
There are many reasons why
these countries have to borrow.
There may be a decline in the
price of their raw materials (cof¬
fee, for instance). Their exports
may be hampered by protectio¬
nist policies among the importing
nations. They may lack adequate
scientific and technological sup¬
port. In addition, funds are some¬
times diverted from their original
purpose. Fresh money can be
used to buy weapons or even for
personal enrichment. In order to
speed up debt repayment, the
World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund advise govern¬
ments to implement reforms,
including austerity measures, cut¬
backs in civil service staff and
action to eradicate corruption.
But however well-grounded the
reforms may be economically,
they are often resented by the
population. However, these two
agencies do not have exclusive
responsibility for Third World
debt management. Altogether
some 500 banks are involved.
Moreover, a flourishing, unpubli-
cized secondary market in Third
World debt has emerged.
The process is something like
this: Bank X lends US$1 million to
Country Y on the basis of its
potential wealth or its expected
economic recovery. For various
reasons, Bank X may later decide
to sell the debt to Bank Z for
US$600,000. If Country Y finally
pulls through and meets its obli¬
gations, Bank Z will have made a
profit of US$400,000, because the
debt has kept its initial nominal
value. When a bank decides to
invest in a particular country, this
is part of a strategy and purcha¬
sing a debt gives it the power to
influence entire sectors of the
local economy.
In 1987, a new form of debt
appeared the debt-for-nature
exchange. In the first issue of
Environment Brief published by
Unesco in 1992 (1), debt-for-nature
exchange is defined as follows:
"... the foreign-currency debt holder
negotiates a deal whereby the
debtor redeems the debt through
a commitment either to invest
local currency in conservation and
natural resource management
projects or to encourage sustain¬
able development through
changes in policy and regulation."
The following example, as repor¬
ted by Peter Dogsé and Bernd
von Droste in MAB Digest (2),
published by Unesco in 1990,
clearly shows the practical pro¬
blems involved in implementing
such an agreement.
In July 1987, an American envi¬
ronmental Non-Governmental
Organization, Conservation Inter¬
national, decided to purchase
US$650,000 worth of Bolivia's
external debt, for which it paid
US$100,000. In exchange, the
Bolivian government agreed to
classify as a "biosphere reserve",
1.5 million hectares of tropical
rain forest located in the Bolivian
region of Beni, the capital of
which is Trinidad. It also decided

to set up three buffer zones
around the reserve.
The project has had to face a
number of problems. Bolivia has no
Non-Governmental Organization
specializing in environmental
matters and this has slowed down
implementation of the project
considerably. Furthermore, three
indigenous groups have asserted
their claims on the reserve in
which about 25,000 of them live.
In 1990, they marched on La Paz
in a forty-day protest. In view of
all this, the Bolivian government
postponed its financial contribu¬
tion for two years. Since the United
States Agency for International
Development (USAID) waits for
local official funding before it
makes its own donation, this
meant that the Bolivian
Government immediately lost
US$60,000 in interest. In the
meantime, the government
authorized loggers to exploit the
mahogany trees in Chimane, one
of the buffer forests, on condition
that they carried out a reafforesta¬
tion programme a requirement
they were not always able to fulfil.
Other problems include the fact
that the only road to Trinidad is
impassable during the greater
part of the year, and that the
waterways in this huge, under¬
populated area are not always
practicable.
Of course, there are benefits.
Staff have been recruited and
trained in forestry, inventories
have been initiated, an environ¬
mental education programme has
been launched, and Conservation
International has decided to
invest in research programmes on
soils, primates and freshwater
turtles. This demonstrates the
multiplier effect that debt-for-
nature exchanges can have. For
every dollar a Non-Governmental
Organization invests, it will gen¬
erally add two more to carry out
complementary projects and, of
course, to enhance its own image.
Some tentative conclusions can
be drawn at this stage. Regardless
of the generous motives behind
such nature conservation under¬
takings, they are often subject to
criticism. Is this not just a new
form of domination? Are the ter¬
ritorial restrictions imposed on
the indigenous populations justi¬
fied, when in fact the debt is none
of their making? Will the benefi¬
ciary nation honour its commit¬
ments, when it has not complied
with its previous external debt
payments to banks? Finally, some
experts argue that in most cases
this arrangement does not result
in much more than a few conser¬
vation measures that preserve
appearances, and that no in-
depth, concrete action actually
takes place.
Nevertheless, since the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) was
set up by the World Bank and the
United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), with initial
funding of US$1.4 billion, the
most heavily indebted countries
appear to see this initiative as
opening up' new prospects both
for alleviating their burden of
debt and for safeguarding their
"natural capital".
