MIDDLE EAS T :
MEDIA PLURA L ISM
VIA SAT EL L I T E

Satellite TV channels are making inroads on state-run monopolies and widening programme
choice, but the number of households equipped with dish receivers is still generally low

1997,a report on a reception given in Lat-
takieh by Rifa at in honour of Saudi A r a b i a ’s
C r own Prince Abdullah had provoked the
S y rian gove rn m e n t ’s wrath because it had
v i o l ated protocol and, e ven wo rs e , had been
broadcast on ANN.
Crumbling censorship
W h at e ver its real aim—inform ation or
p r o p a g a n d a — s atellite broadcasting has hel-
ped turn TV into a major factor in the poli-
tical life of a region which has never been
noted for audiovisual pluralism. ANN is
only one of the players in this process.
On the 50th anniversary of what Arabs
call the n a q s a (disaster)—the founding of
the Israeli state in 1948 after the A r a b
d e f e at—Arab viewe rs of the Middle East
Broadcasting Corp o r ation (MBC, see box )
were able to see the same documentary fil m ,
made by Bri t a i n ’s BBC, t h at the Israelis saw
on their national channel.
“The Jordanian gove rnment angri l y
denied the accuracy of a sequence in which
King Hussein was said to have wa rned Israel
of the imminence of a war in October 1973,”
s ays Jon A l t e rm a n , a programme officer in
the Research and Studies programme at the
U. S . Institute of Peace (USIP).
Satellite dishes have sprouted on the rooftops of Aleppo, in Syria.

“The main thing was that they couldn’t
censor it,” s ays A l t e rm a n .“In the long ru n ,
the obstacles to the freedom to inform and
be informed are gradually going to cru m b l e .
The ability of gove rnments to act as censors
is weakening year by ye a r ,e ven if countri e s
like Egypt and Jordan have recently passed
repressive press laws.”
G ove rn m e n t s , he feels, will at least have
to take account of public opinion in their
c o u n t ri e s , e ven if they do not set up real
d e m o c r a c i e s.“And those that hesitate most
about this will be left behind by the rest of
the world.”
The success of the Qatar satellite T V
channel A l - Jezeera is significant in this res-
p e c t . “It introduced discussions which sho-
wed a clash of contradictory opinions,” s ay s
Alterman.Since it was started in 1997,Al-
Jezeera has become a beacon of free expres-
sion in the Arab wo r l d , thanks to the pro-
fessionalism of its journ a l i s t s , who once
worked in the BBC’s former Arab Service.
And because Qatar is a small country, w h i c h
is ve ry rich but has no major geopolitical
interests to defend, it can afford to rub its
p owerful neighbours up the wrong way and
s e rve as a meeting-point for the Arab wo r l-
d ’s opposition politicians.The station has
even brought Qatar regional prestige.
Is this an exception which proves the
rule? Jo u rnalist Daud Kuttab does not share
this very “liberal”vision of steady progress
t owards democracy made possible through
free competition in the inform ation market.
Ku t t a b , who is highly respected in the A r a b
wo r l d , was the first chairman of Pa l e s t i n i a n
Television but was soon dismissed for his
independent approach. He was successive-
ly jailed by the Israeli army and the Pa l e s t i-
nian A u t h o rity and now runs the Je ru s a l e m
Film Institute.
A two-speed information society
He points out that many Arab sat e l l i t e
channels are simply offshoots of stat e - ru n
TV. “Most were set up just so that govern-
ments could extend their influence beyo n d
n ational borders.T h at ’s why they often only
broadcast classical music and a screen sho-
wing pink flamingos,with a small emblem
or a flag in the top left corner of the screen.
I t ’s also why they spend more money on the
technical side of broadcasting than on pro-
gramming.”
Such channels are also the last place an
independent Arab film-maker would go to
look for funding, he say s. For cost or poli-
tical reasons, p r o grammes (animal fil m s ,
u n c o n t r ove rsial feat u r e s , soap operas) are
mostly bought in Europe and the United
S t at e s.This has a schizophrenic effect on
v i e we rs : the gap between their own env i-
ronment and the pictures they see on the
screen is just as big whether they are loo-
king at a stat e - run national channel or sat e l-
lite channels.
Kuttab is just as sceptical about the role
of satellite channels in the emergence of
independent news report i n g . He has seen
no sign of this. Not long ago, a minister of
i n f o rm ation told him “I can change and
modernize as much as I want, but the first
item on the television news will always be
the daily report on the president’s activi-
t i e s.”This news programme will usually be
broadcast on the satellite channels of this
particular state.
Kuttab also thinks that satellite chan-
nels are first and foremost powerful we a-
pons that some states and politicians can
use against their neighbours or ri va l s. I n
fa c t , he say s ,“ e ven when the news they carry
is better and more va ried than on local chan-
n e l s , the aim is more to harm their enemies
than to inform the public.”Saudi channels,
for example, talk a lot about pluralism when
n e i g h b o u ring countries such as Yemen are
c o n c e rn e d , but say ve ry little about Saudi
internal politics.
The other danger, s ays Ku t t a b , is that
“these channels create a two-speed 
i n f o rm ation society where you have people

with access to inform ation from abroad and
the vast majority who have to make do with
o f ficial propaganda.” A l t e rman notes that
the numbers of households equipped to
r e c e i ve satellite TV are bound to increase
but they are still generally low.“In the Gulf,
t wo-thirds of the population have sat e l l i t e
d i s h e s , but only 20 per cent in Pa l e s t i n e ,
Lebanon and Jo r d a n , and only between 7
per cent and 10 per cent of Egyptians.”
So in Egypt, the Arab wo r l d ’s most
populous country but also one of the poo-
r e s t , access to a choice of inform ation is just
one more privilege for the ruling class. I n
a less  serious ve i n , Egyptian TV viewe rs last
summer could not see the matches of the
C o n f e d e r ations Cup, in which the Egyptian
football team was playing, because ART, a
group of subscription-only satellite chan-
nels (see box),had bought exclusive rights
to screen the matches.
The rare attempts to ban satellite recep-
tion have not amounted to much.In 1994,
the Saudi authorities tried to do this, f o r
commercial rather than political and moral
reasons (some satellite-transmitted fil m s
are seen as offensive to Islamic morality).
They were actually trying to promote the
interests of cable operators who were close
to the royal fa m i l y. L ater the gove rn m e n t
took a more tolerant view of satellite 
d i s h e s.To d ay, Iraq is the only Arab country
which has not entered the era of sat e l l i t e
television.
It cannot be denied that satellite chan-
nels are having profound effects on A r a b
s o c i e t i e s. For example, they help to creat e
w h at A l t e rman calls “a real basic identity”,
based on a common mental landscape and
references that are transmitted by the new
channels all over the Arab world and thus
transcend national frontiers.This identity
is much more sturdy than the one gove rn-
ments have hitherto tried to create by
“ b r a i n wa s h i n g ” .S atellite channels are also
a link between Arabs living in the region and
the Arab diaspora in the West.
Competition prises
open state-run channels
The appearance of a new kind of audio-
visual operat o r , albeit few and far betwe e n ,
has helped to transform the media scene.
“The competition has to keep up,” s ay s
A l t e rm a n . One example is MBC, w h i c h
“has clear links with the Saudi gove rn m e n t
but can no longer afford to appear as
the Voice of Riyadh if it wants to keep
its viewers.”
The new satellite channels are more
attractive and modern and have an impact
on the state monopolies. Douglas Boy d ,
who teaches in the Unive rsity of Kentuc-
k y ’s Communication Depart m e n t ,s ays the
lack of credibility of local media is the chief
reason for the popularity of satellite TV.
The competition from the sky has for-
ced the state-run channels to open up and
i n n ovat e .The official Egyptian TV channel
n ow screens a lot of talk shows which,
though uncontrove rs i a l , at least gi ve an
impression of public debate. Jordanian TV
has also gi ven air time to the monarchy ’s
fiercest opponent,Laith Shbelat ,r ather than
see him appear yet again on Al-Jezeera.
“ E ven Syria has seen remarkable pro-
gress in its television services over the past
15 ye a rs ,” s ays Nabil Dajani, a sociology
professor at the A m e rican Unive rsity of Bei-
ru t . In Qat a r , the ministry of inform at i o n
has simply been abolished.
“ Pa r a d ox i c a l l y, i t ’s the interaction of
c o n flicting interests, d e f e n s i ve gove rn m e n t
policies and competition between va ri o u s
channels which has increased pluralism,”
s ays Boy d .“A biased and narr ow pluralism
but an embryonic pluralism all the same.”
