INTERVIEW BY IVAN BRISCOE
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST



All power to the baro n s ?
Digital technologies may promise a host of new channels and activities,
but the stranglehold of big business is set to tighten, says leading media commentator Robert
McChesney*
o you see digital convergence as a
technological process or as a wider change
in the media?
The notion that there is technological
convergence is undeniable.The transition
to digital format of virtually all media
and forms of communication is on its way
to being completed in the near future.
But the convergence of media ownership
is even more striking, and in many
respects anticipates technological
c o n v e r g e n c e. For most consumers, i t ’s the
convergence of ownership that has
probably had the most direct effect on
their media experience to date. And I
think these changes in ownership will go
a long way towards shaping how the
digital world will eventually look.
How exactly is ownership changing?
The crucial trend is vertical
i n t e g r a t i o n , or more broadly,
conglomeration of media ownership. In
the United States for example—and this
is a pattern that could have been found in
most countries with market economies—
the media industries such as music or
cinema in the 1950s each tended to be
dominated by three or four different
c o m p a n i e s. What has happened in the
U.S. and globally over the last 50 years is
that the largest media companies have
become conglomerates,meaning that the
largest film studio also owns a television
network or a music company, r a d i o
s t a t i o n s, m a g a z i n e s, cable systems, s a t e l l i t e
systems, video rental chains.1 What you
have is a tremendous web of power built
up by the largest firms, which have
become dominant players in several
media sectors. All this predates digital
c o n v e r g e n c e.Digital convergence is really
the cherry on top of the sundae.
But will the new digital technology not
offer greater choice and allow new
companies to enter the market?
There is a paradox with the rise of
the Internet specifically and digital
communications more broadly. Th e
standard belief has been that all of a
sudden,the traditional market power of
these media giants is going to fall because
the barriers to entering media markets
are being radically lowered, if not
e l i m i n a t e d . But the problem with this
theory is that it’s technology driven. I t
makes perfect sense technologically, but
what it misses—and this is the perceived
wisdom on Wall Street—is that new
technologies are not going to spawn a
wave of commercially viable media
entrepreneurs or businesses due to the
market power of existing companies.
Technologies are developed in the market
for the most part, and the ones that are
aggressively pursued and promoted are
the ones most likely to offer a profitable
return for the dominant companies.
What effects does concentration have on
the media we consume?
Firstly, you see the incessant rise of
what I call hyper- c o m m e r c i a l i s m ,
meaning that these companies are quite
rationally trying to make a profit from
every aspect of their media services—
something they can do much more easily
in a non-competitive market. If you don’t
like the fact that in the U.S. the average
commercial radio station has 18 to
20 minutes of advertisements per hour,
you don’t really have any alternative,
they all do the same. The flipside of this
prevalence of commercial values
throughout our media culture is a decline
in public service content. Journalism that
does hard investigation or raises serious
social issues doesn’t make economic sense
for these companies—it costs a lot of
money and the pay-off isn’t high.
F u r t h e r m o r e, the largest media
companies now rank among the largest
firms in the entire economy. Th e s e
companies are not neutral bystanders on
the sidelines of society. Th e y ’re main
players right in the heart of it,with distinct
self-interests on the crucial issues of the
day.
What do you believe should be done?
Our traditional notions of what
proper media ownership is must be re-
e v a l u a t e d . But the sort of public and
political debate on the issues, at least in
the U.S., is the last thing on earth large
media companies want to encourage.As
long as this issue is kept in the smoke-
filled back rooms and lobbyists talk to
p o l i t i c i a n s, the position we have now will
continue. ■
