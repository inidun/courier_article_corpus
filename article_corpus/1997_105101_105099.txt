efferson's dream house
by Francis Leary
Monti ce Lio, the mansion buUtin Virginia by Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United
States and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, is a jewel of American neo¬
classical architecture. In 1987 it was placed on Unesco's World Heritage List.
Thomas Jefferson
(1805) by the
American painter
Rembrandt Peale.
On the first day of 1772,
twenty-eight-year-old Tom
Jefferson brought his bride,
Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow
of twenty-three, to Montieello,
"Little Mountain" in Italian, their
new home. As a carriage could not
traverse the route in a snowstorm
at night, they had ridden on horse¬
back over the mountain.
Though only the one-room
South Pavilion was completed,
Tom was eager to welcome Martha
to the house he was building for
them. While outside the storm
raged, Tom build a fire in the
hearth and produced a bottle of
wine; a black servant prepared a
meal for the honeymoon couple.
The romantic aura of this firelit
snowbound first dinner at Monti-
cello reflects Thomas Jefferson
throughout his life.
A correspondent, to whom he
had written about his bride,
remarked that his description of
Martha was "the most Romantic
and Poetical that I ever did read."
A comment that might also apply to
Jefferson's feelings about Monti-
cello. This tall lanky youth with red
hair, freckles and grey eyes was a
complete man in the Romantic tra¬
dition. He towered over other men
in height as he would tower over
them in intellect and inspiration.
Most planters built their homes
on their plantations, on the low-lying
Tidewater land where tobacco was
the chief cash crop. Jefferson chose
a mountain-top in the Blue Ridge,
two leagues or six miles (10 km.)
from the town of Charlottesville.
His classical studies at the College
of William and Mary had revealed to
him a new architecture for the
house he was already planning
before his marriage.
In a 4-volume edition of the
Renaissance architect, Andreas
Palladio, Jefferson found what he
wanted. The designs of the Italian
master were inspired by the tem¬
ples and villas of Ancient Rome.
Palladio projected one-story
structures with double-columned
porticoes on each front and a hall
that extended the length of the

building, while living and dining
rooms opened off the central hall.
Local materials were employed
in the construction of Monticeilo.
Jefferson burnt bricks in a kiln in
the deer park on the southeast
side of the mountain, where the
deep-red clay was ideal for mak¬
ing bricks. He sawed the planks
for the flooring and had limestone
quarried for porticoes. lie relied
on cabinet-makers in Williams¬
burg for interior furnishings and
embellished the estate with
orchards and vegetable gardens.
Plantation slaves performed the
hard labour of construction as well
as working in the tobacco fields.
Jefferson had inherited 5,000
acres (2,900 hectares) from his
father, Peter Jefferson, and had
150 field hands to cultivate this
acreage. The extensive Ilemings
family acted as maids and house-
boys. They were never called
slaves, though in fact they were.
The first black slaves were
brought to Virginia in 1619.
Tobacco soon proved to be the
small colony's leading export, and
slave labour and tobacco farming
became intertwined. By 1790,
Virginia's population of 750,000
would be almost equally divided
between whites and blacks.
For Jefferson, the slave system
was "a iirebell in the night". Newly
elected to the Virginia legislature
at Williamsburg, he proposed a
bill to phase out slavery in the
colony, but he failed. The planters
felt that they could not manage
without slaves. Indeed, for Jeffer¬
son to try to build his dream house
without slave labour would have
been almost impossible.
'AFIREBELLINTHENIGHT'
During the War of Independence,
two English deserters, skilled
craftsmen, boarded at Monticeilo.
Billy and Davy made furnishings
for the house and built an elegant
phaeton to Jefferson's design.
Soon after independence was
achieved, Jefferson received a visit
from the Marquis de Chastcllux,
who had served with the French
army during the war. Most
impressed by his host, Chastel-
lux commented: "Mr. Jefferson is
the first American who has con¬
sulted the Fine Arts to know how
to shelter himself from the
weather."
The marquis also visited the
deer park on the southeast side
of the mountain. There he saw a
score of white-tailed deer, very
different from the European
chevreuil and so tame that Jef¬
ferson fed them Indian corn out
of his hand.
Jefferson's happy life at Mon¬
ticeilo was abruptly ended by
Martha's death. Torn apart by the
tragedy, he needed to get away
and accepted an appointment as
Minister to France in 1781. With
his elder daughter Martha and his
body-servant, James Ilemings, Jef¬
ferson came at last to the coun¬
try whose history and culture had
long fascinated him. On his return
to America, Jefferson's French
furnishings filled eighty-six crates
for shipment. Nothing like it had
ever been seen in the new nation.
Inspired by the classical archi¬
tecture of Paris, Jefferson decided
to remodel Monticeilo. He was cap¬
tivated by the Hôtel de Salm,
newly-built on Palladian lines, on
the rue de Lille, across the Seine
from the Tuileries. This princely
residence gave the effect of a soar¬
ing single storey under a shallow
dome, an impression produced by
rooms of oval and octagonal shajte,
great skylights and tall windows
extending from the top and open¬
ing at the ground level. It was a

design ideally suited to Virginia's
scorching summers.
Jefferson preferred the nat¬
ural beauty and wonder of Eng¬
lish gardens to the geometrical
perfection of the French. At
Painshill Park in Warwick, he
found the roundabaout walks,
mazes and serpentine walls that
he wanted for Monticeilo. He was
enchanted by the temple of Bac¬
chus at Painshill , built by Charles
Hamilton, a genius of eighteenth-
century landscape gardening, who
had created the park.
THETRANSFORMATIONOF
MONTICELLO
The entire east front and central
staircase of Monticeilo were torn
down to make way for a grande
entrée, a lofty portico of single
columns topped by Doric capitals,
which led into a great hall that was
connected by double doors with
the salon beyond. These automatic
glass doors were worked by a chain
in the floor wound around two
cylinders, so that when you opened
one door, the other also opened, a
contrivance of Jefferson, who
delighted in such tricks.
North and south wings were
lowered to conform to the height
of the lofty salon on which the
dome rested. On the east and west
fronts, the windows of the second
floor were elongations of the first-
floor windows, which opened at
ground level. Thus did Jefferson
preserve the illusion of a one-
storey mansion under an elegant
dome, as in the Hôtel de Salm.
In reality, the new Monticeilo
comprised four storeys. The base¬
ment was connected by a series of
tunnels to outlying "dependen¬
cies", a large kitchen with char¬
coal-burning ovens of 8 burners, a
wine cellar, ice house, dairy and
smoke house. These additions Jef¬
ferson had buried under terraces
on the hillside to preserve bis
panoramic vistas.
Jefferson's bed at
Monticeilo. Located
in an open alcove
between his bedroom
and his study, it
could be raised using
a pulley system
Jefferson invented. It
was on this bed that
Jefferson died on
4 July 1826.
To make Monticeilo completely
self-sufficient, Mulberry Row, an
avenue 300 metres long near the
house, was lined with seventeen
small structures of logs or stone.
Here were more slave quarters and
workshops for both white and
black artisans, joiners, weavers,
blacksmiths.
From Mulberry Row, a gate
through a ten-foot fence led into a
400-tree orchard and vegetable gar¬
den on the south slope, where Jef¬
ferson experimented with seventy
different kinds of vegetables. In
the large Fruitery, which included
the North Orchard of cider apples
and peaches for distilling brandy,
grew not only all the American vari¬
eties but such exotic delights as
figs, Spanish almonds and the
prized Breast of Venus peach.
A romantic grove of shade trees
and glades crowned the mountain
top. Twenty oval flower beds blos¬
somed around the house, while on
the West Lawn a Roundabout Walk
evoked an English garden, as at
Painshill Park.
All this beauty and practical
functions took seventeen years to
achieve. As Monticeilo was slowly
taking form, the master himself
was creating a new nation. As Pres¬
ident of the United States (1801-
1809), he grasped the opportunity
to purchase the vast Louisiana ter¬
ritory from the Emperor Napoleon
in 1803. The size of the infant
Republic was increased by 140
per cent and now stretched from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
A 7,000-BOOK LIBRARY IN
'HONEYMOON COTTAGE'
When he was at home, Jefferson
often retreated to a sanctum sanc¬
torum in the south wing, the orig¬
inal "honeymoon cottage", where
he had his library of 7,000 books,
his study and bedroom, with alcove
bed. In the study, he kept his tele¬
scope, polygraph machine, revolv¬
ing table, reading stand and a
swivel chair with holes in the arms
for brass candlesticks all conve¬
niences invented by Jefferson.
In the north wing was the din¬
ing room, with an octagonal tea
room leading off it. The rooms
opposite were guest bedrooms,
each with its alcove bed. Addi¬
tional bedrooms on the second
floor were reached by steep nar¬
row staircases enclosed within the
north and south passages.
Another flight of ladder-like
stairs gave access to the dome
room, "a noble and beautiful apart -
ment with eight circular windows
and skylight". It was usually occu¬
pied by one of Martha's twelve chil¬
dren. The yellow walls contrasted
vividly with the floor, painted
"grass-green", as was the parquet
of the entrée, on the advice of
Gilbert Stuart, famed portrait
painter of Revolutionary heroes.
Jefferson died on 4 July 1826,
the same day as his friend and
political rival, John Adams. It was
exactly fifty years after the adop¬
tion of the Declaration that had
resounded around the world. Death
had come as he had desired, at
Monticeilo.

The Academical
Village
Jefferson devised a plan for what he
called an "Academical Village", a Uni¬
versity that would serve as a model
for the education of American youth.
He believed in a liberal non-sectar¬
ian formation and he devised a cur¬
riculum comprising all the intellec¬
tual currents of his time.
According to Jefferson's plan, the
university was to have eight schools,
including both classical and modern
languages, mathematics, natural his¬
tory, anatomy and medicine, moral
philosophy and law. A flexible elec¬
tive system, the first of its kind, pre¬
vailed; a student who had completed
six schools would graduate from the
university.
The "Academical Village", as it
was built in Charlottesville, was
grouped around a complex often pavil¬
ions, five on a side, before a grassy
quadrangle, the Lawn. Pavilions on
either side were connected by colon¬
naded walkways.
At the Lawn's north end, a majes¬
tic Rotunda dominated the scene, its
dome crowning three storeys, with
marble steps ascending to a columned
portico. To the south, the Lawn offered
students the lofty vistas of the Blue
Ridge Mountains.
His classical inspiration prevail¬
ing, Jefferson designed the pavilions
with no two alike, "to serve as speci¬
mens for the architectural lectures."
Each façade would exhibit details
derived from Antiquity. One Pavilion
would display Ionic columns with Doric
capitals, anotherthe Corinthian order
of Diocletian's Baths, the august
Rotunda would be a smaller scale copy
of the Roman Pantheon.
When the University opened in
1825, 109 rooms were available for the
40 students admitted. Soon, however,
a double occupancy became the rule.
Today, the original "Jefferson rooms"
are eagerly sought.
As the University outgrew the first
design, new buildings sprang up to
house the Faculties of Law and Medi¬
ane. The classrooms, student and fac¬
ulty quarters of the Pavilions were con¬
verted to other uses: public meetings
and social events. While the façades
were unchanged, rear extensions sup¬
plied amenities such as bathrooms,
toilets, modern kitchens.
The "Hotels" or dining halls now
harbourfaculty and student rooms and
the editorial offices of the Virginia
Quarterly Review. The Rotunda, once a
library, burned down in 1895. It was
restored to its pristine splendour in
1976 and is now an administrative cen¬
tre. The Dome Room is used for large
public gatherings and formal dinners.
The original concept of the Academical
Village is preserved. With a library of 4
million volumes, a faculty of 1,700 fine
scholars, this great University annually
gives diplomas to over 5,000 students.

Top, the University of Virginia (1814-1825) or "academical village" in Charlottesville,
designed by Thomas Jefferson, embodies the Enlightenment ideal in architecture
applied to a large educational institution. In background is the Rotunda with its neo¬
classical portico. Students' and teachers' quarters stand on each side of the grassy
quadrangle.
