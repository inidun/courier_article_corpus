John Leslie*: Inside the divine mind
“Cosmology can give us speculative stories that are very much worth
taking seriously. But at the moment science cannot give us any confidence
that these stories are correct. The stories are all about how this universe
came into existence against the background of the laws of physics, and
there’s a question of why there are any laws of physics, and why they
should apply to anything.
Let’s suppose you had a completely empty situation.What would there be
in that situation which could create a universe? Well, first note that the
situation couldn’t be entirely empty because it would be full of all sorts of
facts—for example, the fact that 2+2=4. I don’t think you can get rid of
facts like that just by banishing the universe from existence, because these
are facts about possibilities and hold no matter what. There would also be
ethical facts:for example, it would be a fact that the emptiness was in one
respect bad because you could have a really good situation instead, a
wonderful cosmos.
If Plato was right in thinking that Value itself acts creatively, then the
cosmos must be the very best possible cosmos. It then consists of an
infinite number of minds, each knowing everything worth knowing:minds
we might want to call divine. The structure of the universe is just one of
the things worth knowing, and all of us exist inside one of those divine
minds. This is a pantheistic view—that the structure of the cosmos is
simply the structure of divine thinking.”
