How we handle globalization will determine whether our cities and our
civilization will be divided and violent or user-friendly and peaceful
Urbanization and g l o b a l i z a t i o n
Jorge W i l h e i m
Architect and town planner in São Paulo, author of plans for a number of towns and
cities, including Curitiba,in Brazil.He was also deputy secretary-general of the UN
Habitat II conference (Istanbul, 1996).
We cannot get a clear picture of urban life in
the 21st century, especially in the poor
c o u n t ries of the South, unless we take into
account the phenomenon of globalizat i o n , w h i c h
has already brought dramatic changes. C i t i e s ,a n d
especially mega-cities, are where those changes make
their first appearance. So it is there too that the gr e at
upheavals of the next century will take place.
G l o b a l i z ation gi ves shape to the “global village”
predicted by the Canadian Marshall McLuhan.T h e
“ i n f o rm ation era” t h at it ushers in compresses time
and we are now living in a world speeded up as neve r
b e f o r e .World-wide urbanization is proceeding at a
similar rate and its pace in the poor countries of the
South seems terri f y i n g . By 2025, t wo-thirds of
humanity will be living in cities and tow n s , w h e r e
the best opportunities in life tend to be.
G l o b a l i z ation also accentuates a “new urban
g e o gr a p hy ” in both North and South. Islands of ri c h
c o n s u m e rs are spri n ging up in cities amid an ocean
of depri ved people. More and more unemploye d
p e o p l e , i m m i gr a n t s , m i n o rities and the homeless,
are pushed into cities by pressure from “ m a r k e t
e c o n o m i e s ” . As a result, all urban areas—not just
those in the poor countries of the South—will have
to deal with gr owing internal tensions. In New Yo r k ,
for example, the poorest 20 per cent of the
p o p u l ation earns 15 times less than the richest 20
per cent.
Cities have always had their smart
neighbourhoods and their dangerous areas—the
old cities of Europe even more so than those of the
A m e ri c a s , where there is more geographical and
social mobility. But such social and geogr a p h i c a l
s e gr e g ation has changed in pace and scale because
of the gr owth in the urban populat i o n , the increase
in “illegal”migrants and rising uncertainty.
In fa c t , we have entered a period of histori c a l
t r a n s i t i o n , where discontinuities prevail ove r
a d j u s t m e n t . Radical changes in the nature of
production and jobs and the incredible
c o n c e n t r ation of capital in the hands of the fin a n c i a l
sector and speculat o rs weigh much heavier in our
l i ves these days than the stat e ’s efforts to adjust and
i m p r ove the market economy. S e gr e g ation in cities
has been gi ven a new lease of life whose
consequences we do not know. It has reached
unprecedented dimensions because of the explosive
growth of urban areas.
A c c o rding to one scenario, things will go badly.
The gr owing pace of globalization will increase
u n c e rtainty about the future. Fear and defence
mechanisms will gr ow among people and institutions,
fuelling intolerance, xenophobia and mistrust of
e ve rything new or foreign. Urban tensions will manifest
t h e m s e l ves with increasing violence, and segr e g at i o n
will sharp e n . Public areas will be abandoned and
become dangerous no-man’s - l a n d s , the wretched abode
of society’s rejects. Cities will lose their ori ginal function
of being a crossroads for meeting and exchange.
If globalization also continues to go hand in hand
with deregulation of financial markets and an
unchanged level of indebtedness of poor countri e s ,t h e
l atter will not be able to maintain their urban
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e s.And if on top of this there is corru p t i o n
and lack of political will,challenges to the system will
increase and violence will gr ow. C a s h - s t r a p p e d
a u t h o rities will respond with undemocratic measures
and will even ally themselves with financial mafias which
provide them with funds.
A c c o rding to a second scenario, everything will be all
r i g h t. In line with the principle that “ e ve rything the stat e
does is public, but the state doesn’t control eve ry t h i n g
t h at is public,” a new social contract will be drawn up
b e t ween the stat e , the market, the working populat i o n
and civil society, including NGOs. Cities will develop a
new quality of life by providing citizens with a foru m
for exchange. Jobs will be created in the social sector,
in the fields of the env i r o n m e n t , e d u c at i o n ,r e s e a r c h ,
culture and leisure, opening up possibilities for yo u n g
p e o p l e .
In the countries of the South, l o n g - t e rm deve l o p m e n t
s t r at e gies will be drafted and urban planning practised,
taking advantage of the opportunities provided by
g l o b a l i z ation but without falling into its traps.Tow n
planning will become part of the political process, a n d
the state will work with the pri vate sector, monitored by
institutions of civil society.A d e q u ate housing will be bu i l t
with the help of micro-credit and controls on the pri c e
of building mat e ri a l s. I m p r oved infrastructures will enable
m a r ginal areas to become part of the civilized part of the
c i t y. D e m o c r a cy will come up with new ways of gove rn i n g
with the help of networks of invo l ved citizens.
In a transitional scenario, action strat e gies should
fall somewhere between these two extremes.T h e y
should include social goals so that in big urban areas a
society emerges which is founded on part i c i p at o ry
democracy and on “capitalism with a human face”or
“market socialism”.
But the outlook is less clear than ever. Let us hope
the present transition will lead rapidly to a new reviva l
of humanism, whose first signs we are already seeing.
This would open up the road to a development which
is fair,humane and peaceful. n
