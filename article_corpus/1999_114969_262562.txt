A water crisis looms closer, it seems, every day. In just a couple of
g e n e ra t i o n s, the earth’s population will reach an estimated
nine billion people, as against some six billion today. How will this
g rowing population be fed? Tw o - t h i rds of water consumption
a l ready goes to irrigation, and agricultural needs are incre a s i n g.
M e a w h i l e, industrialization is also taking a heavy toll on our fra g i l e
water supplies, c reating both new demands and risks of pollution.
H y d rologists and civil engineers used to have a standard
response to water scarc i t y : build more dams, desalinization plants
and even pipelines to bring water from humid to dry are a s. Not only
have these technological options failed to keep up with rising
d e m a n d , but they are also too expensive, in ecological as well as
economic terms.
To d a y, our hydrological landscape is being re-designed as
conservationists and economists form an unusual alliance. Instead of
a s k i n g, “how can we provide new supplies?”, they now insist the
main question is, “how can we cut demand?” Their concerns point
to a major para d o x : we waste a re s o u rce without which we cannot
l i v e. The key to more rational management appears to be simple:
c h a rge consumers for the water they use. At the same time, o t h e r
m a r ket mechanisms are seen as a solution to allocating water
re s o u rces effic i e n t l y. For example, laws in the US state of California
e n c o u rage farmers to sell their water rights to cities instead of
g rowing crops during a dro u g h t .T h e re is even talk of setting up an
international water market so that water-poor countries can buy
supplies from the water- r i c h . But what are the political and social
costs of this approach? Can we afford to treat this vital re s o u rc e
l i ke any ordinary commodity? In short, what price water? n
