New Year, or what corresponds to it among the Penihing Dayaks
(or Dyaks) of the Upper Mahakam, in Borneo, is called the Monghosan.
But as the sense of the passage of time is not particularly strong among
these people several years may elapse between each "New Year".
The date is decided by the head priest of the tribe who consults the
aso-do, a wooden pole serving as an agrarian and magical calendar (I).
Though the length of shadow cast by the aso-do helps to determine
the arrival of the Monghosan, the real decision comes when the
tribal chief notices a certain lassitude among his people, and thus the
need for a "renewal", and sends out his warriors on a head-hunting
expedition, for* which a veteran head-hunter (2) is collecting a handful
of branches with' magic powers. All fires are' put out until the head
is brought back in triumph to the village and is attached to a beam
on the communal hut (4). Huts are spread with new earth brought
back in cane baskets (6) by virgin girls, and fires are made by rubbing
a piece of cane in a dry tree trunk. The Dayaks then go out into the
forest to uproot the Mahang, (3) a sacred tree and bring it back to
the village. In this tree lives the good spirit which should now take
up its dwelling in the newly-cut head and bring good luck to the tribe.
For four days and five nights there is no sleep in the village. Everyone
joins in the slow turning circles (5). Each taking part wears the same
number of bird plumes as he has heads to his credit. At dawn on the
fifth day the entire tribe goes in procession to the river and plunges
in for a refreshing bathe. A gargantuan feast ends the festival
