TOKYO
A TALE
OF TWO CITIES
by William A. Robson
IOKYO epitomizes the
achievements of the century which
has passed since the Meiji Res¬
toration. It also reveals a city which
confronts some of the most severe
problems facing any great metropolis.
Prior to 1868 the city was called
Edo, possibly after a local warrior who
built a fort there. A small settlement
existed in the 12th century, but 1457
is generally regarded as the year in
which Edo's history begins because
it was then that Ota Dokan completed
the first castle on the site now
occupied by the Imperial Palace.
The castle had a position which
commanded the land and sea routes
from the Kanto plain to the west.
It was this strategic reason which led
leyasu Tokugawa to make the castle
his principal seat when he took it over
in 1590. When leyasu became Shogun
in 1603 Edo became the administrative
centre of his military government. The
Emperor remained at Kyoto with his
Court, but power had shifted to Edo.
Edo was a small fishing village until
the end of the 16th century. Then it
began to grow. The Shogun summon¬
ed some 80,000 Samurai warriors to
live in the city as his praetorian guard.
The feudal lords were required to
reside in the city every alternate year,
and when they went to their fiefs they
had to leave their wives and children
behind as hostages. This led to the
building of great houses, temples and
shrines in Edo, and craftsmen, trades¬
men, retainers and labourers crowded
into the city.
WILLIAM A. ROBSON is a leading authority
on urban planning. In 1967 he went to
Tokyo on the Invitation of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government and the Tokyo
Institute for Municipal Research to advise on
the organization, planning and administration
of the city. Professor Robson, who has
been a consultant to the governments of
several countries, is Professor Emeritus of
Public Administration at the London School
of Economics and Political Science, and
former president of the International Political
Science Association. He is the author of
"The Government and Misgovernment of
London" (1948); "Great Cities of the World:
Their Government, Politics and Planning"
(1957); "Local Government in Crisis" (1966)
and "Politics and Government at Home and
Abroad" (1967), all published by George
Allen and Unwin, Ltd., London.
By 1613 the population had grown
to 150,000. In 1721 it was 1,300,000
and by the end of the 18th century it
had reached 1.5 million. This made
Edo larger than any other city in the
world except Peking. Since then fluc¬
tuations in the number of inhabitants
have been exceptionally great, partly
owing to natural disasters, and partly
owing to political, military and econo¬
mic events.
In 1868 a vital change of status was
brought about when Edo became the
capital of Japan in place of Kyoto.
The Emperor took up residence in
the castle, which became the Imperial
Palace, and the name of the city was
changed to Tokyo (Eastern Capital).
Modernization began with extra¬
ordinary rapidity: the telegraph was
introduced in 1869, the telephone in
1871, the steam train the following
year, gas street lights in 1874. Tokyo
University was founded in 1877. The
electric lamp made its appearance in
1878, and motorcars in 1903. The first
electric railway started in 1910.
Yet the immediate effect of the
Meiji Restoration on the size of the
city was a sharp fall in the population.
This was due to the exodus of the
dispossessed Samurai and the feudal
lords (daimyo) and their families; who
owned more than half of the city. In
1872 the population had fallen to a
little over half a million and it did not
reach a million again until about 1880.
The seeds of rapid growth were,
however, germinating, for Tokyo soon
became an industrial, commercial,
financial and cultural centre as well
as the political and administrative
capital. The population rose to
3,358,000 in 1920 and 7,358,000 in
1943. These figures are not all
strictly comparable because the admin¬
istrative boundaries were enlarged in
1932 from 85 square kilometres to
554 square kilometres. Today the area
is 2,029 square kilometres.
Tokyo contains the seat of the
Emperor, the national legislature, the
central government and the highest
courts of justice. It is the greatest
manufacturing, commercial, and finan¬
cial centre. It has the headquarters
of the national newspapers and peri¬
odicals, and the publishing, broadcast-

Population 11 million, increasing yearly by 300,000
ing and television organs. The lead¬
ing theatres, both traditional and
modern, are situated there. The rail¬
way system radiates from Tokyo. It
is the centre for sport and athletics.
Tokyo University occupies a position
of special primacy in higher education,
and more than a third of all the col¬
leges and universities in Japan are
located there. Tokyo is above all the
centre of management for all branches
of Japanese life. It is, of course, not
supreme in every respect. Yokohama
is far superior as an ocean port.
Osaka and Nagoya excel in some
branches of industry.
Tokyo has undergone frequent and
severe vicissitudes from fires and
earthquakes. Two great disasters
occurred in the present century. One
was the earthquake of 1923 which
caused the death of 74,000 persons
and destroyed the homes of two-thirds
of the survivors. The other was the
destruction caused by air raids during
the Second World War. About
770,000 houses (roughly half of the
total) were destroyed, the devastated
area exceeded 39,000 acres, and the
sufferers numbered three million, in¬
cluding 100,000 killed and 130,000
wounded. The population dropped
from over seven million to three and
a half million in 1945.
Since then it has risen by more than
300,000 a year and has now reached
a total in excess of 11 million. This
makes Tokyo the world's largest city.
The influx was for some years com¬
posed of returning soldiers, evacuees
and expatriates; but in the last decade
more and more people have flocked
to the capital in search of employment.
Natural increase has also added a
substantial element.
No other great city has grown so
fast. Moreover, the full extent of Its
growth is not revealed by the figures
set out above because these relate
only to the area of the Tokyo Metro¬
politan Government. The present
administrative boundaries were deter¬
mined in 1947, and as in the case of
most great cities the population has
flooded over them.
I
HE modern history of the
government of Tokyo dates from 1889
when 15 wards were incorporated in
the City of Tokyo. For nearly a decade
the city was administered by a
Governor of Tokyo Prefecture who
was appointed by the central govern¬
ment. In 1898 the city council was
given the right to elect a mayor but
the capital remained under the super¬
vision of the Prefectural Governor and
the Minister of Home Affairs.
In 1943 the Prefecture was merged
with the City, which then became the
Metropolis of Tokyo, combining the
powers of a prefecture with those of
a city. Numerous wards were added
to the original 15 and the number is
at present 23. Apart from the special
wards the metropolis includes 17 cities,
13 towns and two villages, together
with three islands in Tokyo Bay.
Within the special ward areas, which
contain nearly nine million people,
Tokyo Metropolitan Government exer¬
cises the major powers of a metro¬
politan authority. There is a lower tier
of elected councils in each of the
special wards performing minor func¬
tions, but they are subordinate to the
Tokyo Metropolitan government. Out¬
side the special wards this authority
exercises only the powers of a pre¬
fecture.
The people of Tokyo have had a
long struggle for self-government
against the central government. Their
greatest victory was in 1947 when the
office of governor was made elective
by the direct vote of the people. Even
today there remains a certain danger
of central domination.
Tokyo is the wealthiest city in Japan.
The average income per head in the
capital is twice the national average
and three times as high as in the poor
farming districts. "The capital contains
about 11 per cent of the nation and it
produces 20 per cent of the national
income. The Japanese economy has
been growing in recent years at a
faster rate than that achieved by any

Living image
of Japan's dual culture
other nation at any time, and much of
this has been generated in Tokyo, the
hub of the economic machine.
The tremendous vitality of the capi¬
tal is visible on every side. There are
new luxury hotels, new theatres, new
railway stations, new office blocks,
new department stores, the vast stad¬
ium and swimming pool built for the
Olympic games, new metropolitan
freeways, a fast monorail to the airport,
the first skyscraper ever permitted in
Japan, the new super-express railway
to Osaka running at 200-250 kilometres
an hour, and the impressive new
managerial sub-centre at Shinjuku with
vast underground roads, shopping ar¬
cades and parking facilities. Motor
cars pour off the assembly line at a
rate which has placed Japan second
among the automobile producing coun¬
tries of the world.
Yet below the surface there are
serious deficiencies which have not
been overcome. The housing situation
in Tokyo is bad for the low income
groups and ¡twill remain unsatisfactory
unless much stronger measures are
introduced to restrict profiteering in
land. There is a need also for public
authorities to provide many more
dwellings for the poorer families.
Only 30 per cent of the special ward
area has sewerage, and flush toilets
are in use in only 27.6 per cent of the
buildings. A piped water supply is
available in 90 per, cent of the houses
in the special ward area but in three
wards the proportion is much lower.
Outside the special wards the overall
figure is only 64 per cent. Moreover,
a piped water supply does not imply
a regular supply day and night
throughout the year.
P
UBLIC nuisances, such as
air pollution, flooding, river pollution,
fumes from motor cars, etc. are not
effectively controlled. The torrent of
motor cars pouring off the assembly
lines has produced a traffic problem of
immense difficulty, which is exacerbat¬
ed by an absence of parking meters
and an exceptionally low ratio of road
space to the metropolitan territory (1).
The public transport system is
grossly overloaded and is divided
among public authorities and commer¬
cial companies. Its capacity is far
below that required1 to cope with the
exceptionally heavy commuter traffic.
In several respects the social devel¬
opment and the basic infrastructure of
Tokyo have not kept pace with the
increase of population and the growth
of the economy.
There are several reasons for this
imbalance. The excessively heavy
influx of population would have over¬
strained the resources of any great
city. But the huge industrial, com¬
mercial and cultural development of
Tokyo demanded a much larger in¬
vestment in public services than has
been forthcoming, especially for health,
housing, education, public utilities,
transport and green spaces.
T
(1) 10 per cent compared with 26 per cent
in Paris and Berlin, 30 per cent in New York,
and 23 per cent in London.
HE central government has
failed to provide Tokyo Metropolitan
Government with the financial resour¬
ces and the powers needed to enable
it to cope with the pressing problems
of the postwar years. Vital matters
such as the rocketing price of land,
the planning of the Tokyo region, the
expansion of the city boundaries, the
development of counter-magnets in
other parts of the country, a more
generous system of subsidies and
loans for municipal purposes, have
either been neglected or dealt with
ineffectively.
Despite its problems, Tokyo repre¬
sents a massive achievement by any
standard. It is a modern city embody¬
ing many feats of design, technology
and construction which are highly
esteemed in the modern world.- It
must be compared, not with the squalid
and poverty stricken cities of Asia but
with the centres of wealth, fashion and
luxury of Western Europe and North
America.
And it contains within itself that
fascinating and unique feature of Jap¬
anese society: the dual culture. One
sees, the technical perfection of the
Tokaido express railway, the marvels
of modern radio and television fac¬
tories, the ingenious design of the
latest department store building, the
Festival Concert Hall, a highly accom¬
plished national press, the stainless
steel station at Shinjuku, a splendid
exhibition of Utrillo's paintings, and
many other manifestations of Western
science and art.
One also sees the Nô theatre and
the Kabuki, the ancient Shinto shrines
and Buddhist temples, the kimonos
and the traditional wedding costumes,
the lovely gardens, the incense burning
ceremonies, the tea ceremony, the
flower arranging art, the Japanese-style
houses, rooms and customs which
have persisted through long centuries.
Nowhere else can one see ancient
and modern cultures co-existing in this
way without merging. The result is
a triumph for what has been achieved
since the Meiji Restoration. It is also
a tribute to what was achieved before
that important event.
The changing
face
of Tokyo

The transformation of Tokyo began in the Meiji era, when a rash of
new buildings spread outwards from the city centre. An outstanding
landmark was Japan's first "skyscraper" (right). Its 12 stories, including
three observation towers, were crowned by a cupola 225 feet above
the ground. With its restaurants, theatres and the first elevator to be
seen in Japan, it immediately became the country's, most popular
amusement centre, as shown in this humorous print of the time. Japan's
first authentic skyscraper (36 stories) was built in Tokyo in 1967.
Above left, a view of the still-changing face of Tokyo today.
