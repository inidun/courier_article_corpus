In search of
a new African
theatre
by Demas Nwoko
AN accident of history has made
us Africans a curious people.
Our formal education began
with the learning of things foreign to
our culture in every branch of pro¬
fessional training medicine, agricul¬
ture, language, history, geography,
and even in crafts like pottery, smith-
ery and weaving. The result for the
young African artist ¡s a confusion
that breeds in him an inferiority
complex.
Modern African schools of drama
teach theatre history, dramatic liter¬
ature, speech and movement, dance,
design and play production. Drama
students are confronted with plays
written by authors ranging from the
Greeks to modern writers like Ionesco,
Pinter or Kafka.
Dance, design and production work¬
shops offer practical courses which
are important in the training of a
theatre artist, but these aspects of the
theatre are mostly taught through
books, which tend to deal with them
in academic rather than practical
terms.
The whole atmosphere is charged
with books and much emphasis is
placed on written examinations, so
that the students lose interest in the
practical aspects. They work so hard
to understand these text books that
frustration and exhaustion take away
any incentive to create spontaneous¬
ly. This is to be expected since cre¬
ativity is more a matter of intuition
than knowledge.
African artists of today seek free¬
dom to create their own art and cul¬
ture, to borrow from wherever they
wish and to do anything they like
with what they borrow; above all
they seek freedom to be the sole
judge of the validity of their living
culture.
DEMAS NWOKO, Nigerian artist and author,
has written a number of studies on the place
of modern theatre in African life and culture.
The training of the young African
artist should be based on teaching in
the classical art forms of Africa.
Once they have matured in their own
culture, all artists will pick up what¬
ever influences they choose from any
corner of the globe. I see this as the
only sane beginning for any African
art.
To achieve this, our schools of art
and theatre should be practical pro¬
fessional workshops and studio
schools, outside the universities.
I would advocate the re-establish¬
ment of the old apprenticeship system.
Actors as well as all other theatre
artists should learn their craft in thea¬
tre studios run by theatre directors.
Many spirited attempts have been
made in the past and are still being
made today to evolve an African
theatre idiom. Though no formal
philosophy has been propounded we
all agree that a truly African identity
in art is imperative. It is also com¬
monly held that this new art should
neither ape European art nor be a
mere copy of traditional African art.
When we talk of a modern African
theatre, I should like us to think of a
culture that belongs to the new
African society, concentrated mostly
in the cities and towns.
Artistically speaking, traditional Afri¬
can society worked almost always in
tribal enclaves and this was obviously
due to the poor communications that
existed in former times. Over a long
period, tribes developed theatrical
expressions unique to them, to such
an extent that scholars subsequently
tended to accept these differences as
cultural distinctions between African
tribes. Even Africans themselves are
generally surprised to see a person of
a different tribe perform a dance of
their tribe fairly well.
There is almost a belief that tribal
artistic expressions have their origins
in the customs and philosophy of the
tribe and often acquire a religious
colouring in the process. Once this
process is completed, the art is seen
as theirs alone and any outsider, i.e.
anyone immediately outside the clan,
is not expected to understand it easily.
Today, -however, the new African
society is detribalized. It is nationalis¬
tic now and will eventually become
Pan-Africanistic, as political unity is
achieved.
The artistic expression of one tribe
cannot fulfil the aesthetic needs of
this multi-tribal society. There has to
be a marriage of artistic habits, and
this is accomplished naturally as the
society comes to share the same reli¬
gions, work and play. The duty of
the artists of this new society will be
to create an art that will express the
life and aspirations of this new
"supertribe".
By virtue of its structure, the new
African society, which is characteriz¬
ed by basically classless social habits,
holds great promise for the growth of
a people's theatre. To achieve this
most desirable end, dramatists should
work with the people in mind at all
times.
Any attitude that tends to empha¬
size distinction in status, or which
creates exclusive tastes in theatrical
entertainment, should be avoided. In
the framework of our present-day
society, any expression of the peo¬
ple's soul will be successfully African
and can become very popular.
It is always wrongly generalized that
an art that is popular is vulgar and
that fine art is always exclusive.
Traditional African arts have shown
that every human being is capable of
appreciating and enjoying the fine
arts, be he king or slave, master or
servant.
To preserve this heritage, any artist
who purposely confines his talent to
a single section of our society should
not be encouraged with public pa¬
tronage, as there is a possible trace of
class patronage in him. Everybody
might not be able to buy the most
highly-priced seats in a theatre, but
all should be able to enjoy a play,
deriving a common aesthetic satisfac¬
tion based on a common philosophy
of life.
The most important thing on the
stage should be man, and not the
events he is enacting; neither should
the objects around nor the tech¬
nological trappings of the modern
stage distract attention from him. We
should not seek to achieve mathema¬
tical precision and speed to the detri¬
ment of the full development and
exposition of the art of the living
artist on stage.
Realism as it is known in Western
theatre appears vulgar to African
audiences, which react to it with
laughter that is not the laughter of an
amused person, but the chuckle of an
adult at the ineffectiveness of a child¬
ish prank.

They might well be asking "Why
cry on stage when we know you are
not grieved or hurt? Why stab some¬
one to death when we know his life
is in no danger of death? Why kiss
and caress on stage when you are not
lovers?" They cannot help laughing
when a "dead" man rises at curtain
call to take a bow.
While the European is prepared to
suspend his disbelief, and to consider
that what is happening on stage is
"reality", the African prefers to see a
performance as an artistic display.
In order to achieve the desired purity
in art, aesthetically ugly manifesta¬
tions like quarrels, which create
abusive language and physical con¬
frontations in fights, cruelty which
results in killing, and other types of
death, are enacted in a highly stylized
manner.
What is true of the acting holds
also for design. The African does not
expect to see a house on stage, nor
does he expect to see a real car, a
king's crown or even a real police¬
man's uniform. A theatrical represen¬
tation of these things is all he expects,
and this is how it should be in the
theatre.
The theatre is first and foremost a
visual expression using sound in mu¬
sic, song or speech; movement, walk¬
ed or danced; designs, colour, shapes
in two or three dimensions, static or
in motion; and a text to build up
associations with the world of nature.
Valid theatre can exist without a text,
while a text without visual expression
can only become literature and never
theatre.
In the new African theatre, there¬
fore, the director should be a good
dancer and choreographer and, along
with these accomplishments, he
should have developed an ear for
music. He should have become so
conversant with shape and the use
of space that he can decide the shapes
of costumes and props that will
ensure their practicality.
While he should not necessarily
write the text of his scripts, he
should choose only poems or writings
that fit into his style of production
since, in this theatre, the visual form
comes before the text in importance.
The true African dramatist will grow
with the African theatre, working
directly for a director or a style when
one has been successfully established.
As regards the ever-present question
of the synthesis of African and West¬
ern cultures as they are found in our
lives, we must accept that a lot of
Western values have come to stay.
We will always have much more of
the European in us (especially with
the mass education programme in
hand) than the European will ever
have of our culture.
A few of us might appear quite at
ease in both cultures; but do not be
deceivedwe are merely very good
actors and mimics, and it works well
for surface fun. Under this apparent
easy adaptability lies only one person¬
ality, that of the African who must be
saved from his cultural ordeal.
Whereas the African religion failed
in the face of the Christian Church
and Islam, art is more fortunate and
has become Africa's pride in the
world today. So it seems that it is
the artist whose duty it is to restore
the new African into a wholesome
personality, by making his culture
dominate his material life.
African culture is not incompatible
with the material, purely technical and
economic aspects of Western civiliza¬
tion. African culture can effectively
make use of modern technology for
its realization and dissemination on
the scale demanded by the world to¬
day, without dehumanizing its values.
Western art today is not only com¬
pletely dehumanized, but it is fashion¬
ed for the glorification of man-made
things, indicating man's sell-out to his
machines. We have as yet no ma¬
chines to sell our souls to and I think
it would a little undignified of the
African to enslave himself to another
man's machines. Let us build our
own modern, human civilization first,
and then decay in our own good
time.
