INTERNATIONAL TROPHIES FOR SPORTSMANSHIP
Fair Play?
Simply a question of honesty'
An athlete, a team of women gymnasts, a football referee and two football teams have
been awarded the second annual International Fair Play Trophies (for 1965). These
Unesco-sponsored awards are designed to honour men and women who place the
highest values on a spirit of sportsmanship, even at the cost of losing a contest Eugenio
Monti, the Italian bobsleigh champion, who received the first of these awards last
year, affirmed that the International Fair Play Trophy would become "the world's most
coveted award." The committee which designates the winners is composed of represen¬
tatives of Unesco, of the International Sporting Press Association, of the International
Council of Physical Education and Sport and of leading international sports federations.
On March 17, 1966, the latest winners of the Fair Play trophies were present at a cere¬
mony in Unesco House (right) to receive their awards from Mr. J.E. Forbes, Unesco's
Assistant Director-General, in the presence of M. François Misoffe, French Minister of
Youth and Sports and of M. Jean Borotra (standing), France's veteran tennis champion,
who heads the Fair Play Committee of the International Council for Education and Sport.
In November 1965,
the British Ladies Gymnastic team,
about to meet
a team in Hungary,
heard that one of the Hungarians
had been injured
while training.
Unanimously the British girls
chose to withdraw
one of their own members to even
the chances and the Hungarians
won by a narrow margin.
A Fair Play Trophy was
presented to Mrs. Pauline Prestidge,
coach of the British team.

16-year-oid Mary Prestidge,

Some 80,000 fans
packed the stands
at Wembly Stadium, London,
on May 19, 1965 to watch
the finals of the
European Cup Winners' Cup
tournament (right) between
the British team,
West Ham United, and
the German champions,
the Munich 1960 club.
The referee and the
two captains,
West Ham's Bobby Moore
and Munich's Peter Radenkovic,
all sensed that the
enthusiasm and excitement
of the crowd might
easily turn into
noisy demonstrations.
But the match was played
so cleanly and with
such skill that
the referee, Istvan Zsolt,
of Hungary, was not obliged
to award a single penalty.
West Ham won, 2-0, but
the newspapers of both countries
were unanimous in
praising the spirit
of fair play shown by both
teams. Captains and
referee were presented
with Fair Play trophies.

U.S. woman athlete, Willye White
(right), silver medalist in the Olympic
long jumps at Melbourne and Tokyo,
has just beaten Mary Rand (above),
British Olympic gold medal winner,
her rival in the U.S. Amateur
Athletic Union games in New York.
To everyone's surprise,
Mary Rand failed even
to qualify for the finals.
Discovering that the British
athlete had mistaken some track
markers unfamiliar to her,
Willye White pursuaded officials
to give Mary Rand
another chance whereupon
the British girl went
on to win the event.
"Fair play", said Willye White,
on receiving her Fair Play trophy,
"is simply a question of honesty.
Everybody wants to win,
but nothing is won
if an error made it possible."
