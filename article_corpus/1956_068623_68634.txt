Malaria was given its name directly from the Italian
"mala" and "aria" literally "bad air". It is a
stubborn disease: slow to kill, quick to incapacitate
and hard to cure.
It exists widely in populated areas where average tem¬
peratures reach 60° F. Since 1920, malaria has been found
as far north as Archangel, and as far south as Cordoba in
the Argentine. It occurs at mountain altitudes as high as
8,000 feet, and around the Dead Sea, some 1,300 feet below
sea level.
Of the 300,000,000 estimated malaria sufferers in the
world, before present control methods were used, 3 million
died each year. Malaria raises mortality, reduces ferti¬
lity, increases stillbirths. Malaria kills only 1% of those
who contract it, but reduces the productive capacity of the
other 99 %, and causes heavy financial and economic loss.
Malaria is spread by certain types of mosquito. The
mosquito absorbs the parasite when it bites and draws
blood from a malarial subject. After developing inside
the stomach of the mosquito, the
parasite is re-injected by the
insect into the blood stream of
another human being.
The world's oldest recorded
disease, malaria is referred to in
ancient Chinese, Chaldean and
Hindu texts. Hippocrates men¬
tions it, and Chinese mythology
tells of the fever "of the three
demons: one armed with a ham¬
mer, the second with a pail of
water, the third with a stove"
forceful symbols of the bouts of
headache, chills and fever that
characterize the disease.
The Romans offered prayers
and sacrifices to "Dea Fibris"
The Goddess of Fevers in the
hope of escaping infection. They
associated swampy areas and
even mosquitoes with the disease
and built drainage canals as an
early form of malariology. By
100 A.D., Columella in "De Re
Rustica", advised against build-

ing near marshes "that breed animals armed with
mischievous stings whereby diseases are often contracted."
Fifteen centuries later, in 1632, Spanish explorers and
colonists brought back from Peru the bark of the "quina¬
quina" tree. The quinine it provided was called "cinch¬
ona" in honour of the Spanish Countess of Chinchón
celebrated as the first known case of malaria cure. For
centuries after, the value of the medicine was obscured
because of the confusion between the quina-quina bark
and that of similar trees, and by quacks hawking bogus
"cinchona" throughout Europe.
One of the earliest malaria control projects based on
the discoveries of Sir Ronald Ross, of Great Britain, was
the clearing of the disease from Staten Island in New
York harbour, during 1901.
Throughout the first World War and since, the repres¬
sion of malaria was widely practised by eradication of the
mosquito in the larva stage usually by drainage works
and with oil sprayed on ponds and breeding places.
Spray killing of the adult mos¬
quitoes rather than of the lar¬
vae began in South Africa In
1935, with oil extracts of pyre-
thum. This same prophylaxis
was used during World War II.
In 1940, the potentialities of
DDT as a fly and insect killer
were realized by a Swiss chemist,
Dr. Paul Müller. Since then,
DDT, together with other insecti¬
cides such as dieldrin, has
become the supreme anti-malaria
weapon of man it does not kill
mosquitoes more efficiently than
pyrethum, but it does continue
to kill them months after it has
been applied to a given surface
on which they alight. Therefore,
repeated sprayings of the in¬
teriors of homes and buildings,
where mosquitoes prey on hu¬
mans, result in killing the insect
vector before he can re-infect
another person, thus interrupting
the transmission cycle.

work that
exposed the
mosquito as the
culprit respon¬
sible for malaria
is one of the
great chapters in
the history of
science. Scien¬
tists of many nations have participated
in the search. A possible connexion
between mosquitoes and malaria was
actually made by the ancient Hindu,
Susruta. In 1880, Charles Laveran, a
French army surgeon stationed in Al¬
geria, discovered the malaria parasite in
human blood (he won the Nobel Prize
in 1907). A year earlier, Sir Patrick
Manson, the great Scottish microbiolo¬
gist then working as a young doctor in
China, had discovered the role of mos¬
quitoes in the transmission of another

T
tropical disease called filariasis which
led him to propound the theory that
mosquitoes transmit malaria. It is said
that Manson proved it was the Ano¬
pheles mosquito, by allowing his son to
be bitten by an
infected mosqui¬
to and to come
down with the
disease. The con¬
clusive incrimi¬
nation of the
mosquito, how¬
ever, came as a
result of five
years of pains¬
taking work in
India by Sir Ron¬
ald Ross, one
of the most emi¬
nent and versatile of modern patholo¬
gists, who received the Nobel Prize for
his investigations in 1902. On Aug¬
ust 20, 1897 (later called "Mosquito
SIR RONALD ROSS
Day") he identified the malaria parasite
inside the Anopheles stomach. A year
later Ross had established the entire life
cycle of the parasite. His work opened
the way to malaria control through the
eradication of mosquitoes in the larva
stage. Ross recognized that it was
"Manson's theory, and no other, which
actually solved the problem" of the
mosquito transmission of malaria.

'We don't count
the deadwe
just bury them'
UNICEF
Malaria as every self-respecting
Dahomey fetichist knows is
simply a stone planted in the
heart by an angry god. All the same,
ramer than risk a contest with the
white magic of DDT supplied by the
U.N. Children's Fund (Unicef), the
black magic priest-professors of the
fetichist school, in the fisherman's
village oí Houedome, on the Porto-
Novo lagoon, marshalled their female
pupilsaged two to fifteento greet
the visiting anti-malaria team with
drums and dances (Photos 2 and 4).
To reach this picturesque island
settlement, built on stilts in the
delta area of the Oueme river, the
health team, together with their
equipment and supplies, were ferried
across in hollowed-out log canoes (1).
The team's itinerary from the
mainland to Houedome and other
island villages in the Aguegues
district, took them through blue
lagoons edged by tall waving reeds
and across emerald-green flood p^ain
pastures. Here local tribes live by
spearing fish and breeding hardy
brown cattle penned inside man-
made enbankments. Such slow-
moving delta waters offer ideal con¬
ditions for mosquitoes and almost
half of Dahomey's 1,500,000 popu¬
lation living along the coastral strip,
is exposed to the constant threat of
malana. In the words of Houedome's
headman, when questioned on the
malaria mortality rates among
children: "We don't count them we
just bury them."
Protection of these people by anti-
mosquito spraying with DDT or
dieldrin, is part of a general drive
against malaria launched by the
French Health authorities in French
West Africa and in Togoland, and
towards which the Unicef has con¬
tributed $ 1,268,000 since April 1952.
The people of Houedome and other
settlements of the Aguegues area, will
be among the 400,000 people due to be
protected against malaria in Da¬
homey, this year.
According to the fetichists, the
explanation will be that fewer stones
have been planted in the hearts of
those that offend the godsHebipsso
the Thunder, Sakpate the Smallpox,
Dan the Rainbow and Ogoun the
Almighty.
But just to make sure they too will
benefit by this reprieve, the prancing
cotton-draped bead-covered trainee
witches o'f Houedome, politely invited
the team of "white magic" practi¬
tioners to spray DDT over the
matting walls of their own academy
of black magic (3).
