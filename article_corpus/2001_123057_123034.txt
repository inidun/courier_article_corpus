The s i re n s of To k y o
The outrageously eccentric young women of Tokyo’s trendy
neighbourhoods use their bodies as a provocation, simply to attain
the illusion of being loved
2 . PASSING RITES
I
t all started in 1996 with Amuro Namie, a
s u p e r b, 1 7 - y e a r-old siren and graduate of
O k i n a w a ’s A c t o r ’s School.An excellent dancer,
she performed on stage in a strapless bra and
then in a pant suit with long jackets.Her look—
golden skin, m o t h e r-of-pearl hair and carefully
tweezed eyebrows—immediately became all the
r a g e, launching the “ t r o p i c a l ”s t y l e.Amuro Namie
also introduced the vogue of “platform boots,”w h i c h
she even wore in the middle of summer to make up
for her short stature.
Her clones have multiplied like mushrooms
after a rainstorm in To k y o ’s trendy neighbourhoods,
like Shibuya. H i y a k e tanning salons have cropped
up just about everywhere, and young women who
have overdone it—or fallen asleep under the UV
rays—are called ganguro, “black faces.” They find
a mischievous pleasure in
accentuating the contrasts by
highlighting their eyes and lips
in white.
“I went through my
kogyaru [literally, ‘little girl’1]
phase,” says Sanae, a 21-year-
old student,“my teachers just
about pushed me into it.Wh e n
they let me know that they
couldn’t stand me anymore—
that I would never make it in
their eyes—I realized it was no longer worth
wearing myself out trying to please them.To get out
of my teenage crisis, I hung out with a group of girls,
between 15 and 18,who were as lost as me. Some
of them were ‘occasionals’ who turned tricks to
buy clothes or name-brand handbags without the
least bit of remorse.They clung to the illusion that
they were envied.”
Writer Murakami Ryu2 thinks that high school
prostitution is the sign of a much wider malaise in
Japan.To him,young “occasionals”are just trying
to act like adults by sacrificing themselves to the
ritual of consumption.After all,a r e n ’t the Ja p a n e s e
the world’s leading consumers of designer Louis
Vuitton bags? “These young people cling to their
mobile phones like a life raft to give themselves the
illusion of being loved,” he says.“In reality, t h e y ’r e
terribly lonely.Each girl is in her bubble, i n c a p a b l e
of communicating.”
The k o g y a r u of the late 1990s vanished as
quickly as they appeared. Men now find them
v u l g a r,and nobody seems to miss them.In Shibuya,
they have been replaced by superb creatures on
s t i l t s, their pants held up by garters that offer a
glimpse of legs molded by red fishnet stockings.
Clothes are just an excuse. Hanging out in Shibuya
mostly means wandering around in search of an
identity, or at least a visual one. What began as a
very affected anti-conformism has ended up
becoming a new way of fitting into the standard
m o u l d . You cannot tell one Shibuya girl from
a n o t h e r.Their password remains m u r e r u,“ m e e t i n g
in groups to share,” if not the same philosophy of
l i f e, at least the same
eccentricity or the courage to
exhibit part of their bodies.
Until the 1970s and 80s,n o
self-respecting woman ever
went out with bare arms, m u c h
less uncovered legs or feet.
Sleeves were mandatory and
going bare-legged was out of
the question, even during the
hottest months of the year.Th e
measure of how much a
woman in a kimono cared about her appearance
was the cleanliness of her tabi (linen socks worn
with sandals or wooden clogs),which she discreetly
changed during the course of the day to always
look impeccable.
To d a y ’s young women are just as conscious
and strict about their appearance but display it in
other ways. They walk around bare-legged,bare-
backed and barefoot in spangled mules and
plunging necklines. They wear carefully polished
fingernails (real or false, they are incredibly long)
and false eyelashes, their bodies burned to a crisp
by UV rays and their hair dyed blond or bleached.
The Shibuya generation, the heir to the
“bamboo shoots”generation (takenoko zoku) of
the 1970s and 80s, is so eccentric they would make
Until the 1970s or 1980s,
no self-respecting
woman ever went
out with bare arms,
much less uncovered
legs or feet.

London’s former punks blush. “The plasticity of
Japanese women’s bodies lets them change their
look whenever they feel like it,” says Erika,a 17-
y e a r-old Fr e n c h - Japanese high school student.
“They can be black or white. For an African look,
they overdo it in the tanning salons, wear clothes
with leopard designs, have their hair kinked and
permed and use make-up with an emphasis on
brown pastels and white refle c t i o n s. If they want to
look white, like the singer Hamazaki Ayumi,they
cultivate a pale look, bleach their hair, put on false
eyelashes and sometimes even wear blue contact
lenses or sunglasses.”
At twenty,
the fun stops
To obtain a kogao, or “little face,” there is an
endless range of products, from sauna masks to
c r e a m s. The hard part is maintaining the iron
discipline necessary to stay slim as a reed, with a
narrow waist and spaghetti legs. “Anorexia has
been taking a heavy toll since the 1980s,” s a y s
psychiatrist Saitô Satoru, who is the author of a
book entitled Onnarashisa no yamai (The Pain of
Fe m i n i n i t y) . “Over 60 percent of young women
today are underweight.”
Th a t ’s because being beautiful in
Japan means being young, very young.
The singers in Morning Musume, a real
h i t , are between 12 and 20 years old.
The senior member (called “the old
lady”!) just quit the band at the age of
28.Amuro Namie was a star when she
was 18. To d a y, she has practically
disappeared.
Why then do these girls go through
so much trouble for their look? They do
it more for themselves than to attract
attention from boys. To have fun and
show off. But showing off implies the
presence of an audience likely to admire
t h e m , or at least appreciate all their
e f f o r t s. The blond sirens in Shibuya
know that their daring outfits are less
shocking when they walk around in
g r o u p s, as if to give themselves the
courage to face disapproving stares. In
any case, they don’t stand a chance of
getting through the high school door
with their look.Education is a serious
b u s i n e s s, and all the more so when
university begins.
A rich man
is hard to find
“ The student style has nothing to
do with the kogyaru s t y l e,” s a y s
C h i k a k o, a third-year student who
works for the magazine Can Can.“Our readers, w h o
are between 18 and 23, are looking for smart,
resourceful men who make a good living and spend
their money like water.The guys these girls want to
meet most graduated from the top universities.
They work in business,advertising or for a famous
foreign company, unless they’re future doctors.
Since the speculative bubble burst and economic
growth came to a screeching halt in the early 1990s,
the student style has become much more toned
d o w n . Girls used to own several name-brand bags,
now they settle for just one. They spend more on
their hair than on their clothes. All of them want
dirty blond hair. I t ’s gotten to the point where girls
with black hair are a minority in university lecture
halls!”
After graduation, they reappear in preppy suits,
white blouses buttoned up to the neck and fla t -
heeled shoes, like perfect office ladies. At 30,they
drop their boyfriends for somebody more serious
and hard-working who will help them fulfill their
role as mother and do all they can to put their
children on the path to a bright future.
So much conformism is almost enough to make
one yearn for the days when the k o g y a r u gave free
rein to their fantasies. ■
