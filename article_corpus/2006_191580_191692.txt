P
                       time seems to stand still in the town of Harar (ethiopia), 
                                entrenched behind its encircling wall. 
                                     Yet the market and mosques are pulsing with life.
Harar
the past Behind closed doors
erched at an altitude of more than 
1800 metres, the town is surrounded 
by a fortified wall four metres high, 
cut through by five gates. Inside is a 
maze of 362 alleys bordered by small 
traditional houses, with broken-down 
old cars circulating wearily in their 
midst. Welcome to Harar, located 
more than 500 kilometres east of Ad-
dis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. 
Less known that other towns in 
the country like Aksum, Lalibela or 
Gondar, it is nonetheless “one of 
the rare examples of a still intact 
pre-industrial town,” notes Jara Hailé 
Mariam of the Ethiopian Authority 
for Research and Conservation of 
Cultural Heritage. The proof is in the 
incessant click-clack of old sewing 
machines heard during the day in the 
tailors’ district, and the blazing red of 
the forges gathered together in the 
district alongside the Buda gate.
Ivory and coffee 
trading
At dawn, the call of the muezzins re-
sounds in the town with 82 mosques. 
Not for nothing is Harar considered 
the fourth holiest city of Islam. In the 
16th century, it became the capital 
of an independent Muslim kingdom, 
at the price of merciless struggle 
against the Christian emperors then 
ruling the country. A significant ves-
tige of this period of rebellion is the 
encircling wall or Jugol that still sur-
rounds the city. 
As in the past, the gates are shut at 
nightfall. Each has a name: Choa ber, 
Buda ber, Erer ber, Fellana ber.
A gateway to Ethiopia
Several commodities made Harar 
famous: ivory, leather and particu-
larly coffee.
Traders would come in and out 
of the gates in the days when 
Harar was the point of access to 
Ethiopia, arriving from the Gulf of 
Aden coast. Several commodities 
made Harar famous: ivory, leath-
er and particularly coffee. Trade 
in the precious bean was in fact 
what brought an unusual travel-
ling salesman to the town at the 
end of the 19th century. His name: 
Arthur Rimbaud. The French poet 
began his stay in 1880. It was a 
time when the caravans brought 
merchandise from the Abyssinian

mountains in the west and the 
trading posts of the Gulf of Aden. 
When the Addis-Ababa-Djibouti 
railway line was opened at the be-
ginning of the 20th century, it her-
alded the town’s decline. 
Commerce is nonetheless alive 
and well in Harar. At the big Gidir 
Magala market, a bustling crowd 
of Somalian, Amhara and Oromo 
women draped in brightly-coloured 
garb shop for spices, vegetables, 
cotton cloth, grains and medici-
nal herbs. They are also after the 
famous khât leaves, which can 
be ingested as tea or chewed to 
produce a mildly euphoric state. 
Enough to forget that between now 
and nightfall, when the shadows 
of the minarets lengthen in the twi-
light and the gates are closed, hy-
enas will descend from the moun-
tains and encircle the town.
