631 million dollars – this is the minimum 
amount UNESCO needs to operate 
for the next two years. 
The budget will be set 
at the 34th session of UNESCO’s 
General Conference, which brings 
together - in Paris, from 16 October 
to 3 November - 
the representatives 
of the Organization’s 
193 Member States who will also 
determine the 2008-2009 programme. 
a preview of the Organization’s future 
priorities is presented in this issue 
of the UNESCO Courier. 
In an interview, the Director-General 
of UNESCO, Koïchiro Matsuura, 
shares his thoughts about the Or-
ganization’s role in the reform of the 
United Nations, and underlines Af-
rica and gender equality as priorities 
 that concern all sectors of UNESCO. 
The culture sector, illustrated by the 
article “Cultures travel with human-
ity”, emphasizes particularly the im-
portance of cultural diversity and dia-
logue between cultures; the natural 
sciences sector, focus of the article 
“Water, an obvious priority”, stresses 
education and furthering knowledge 
about this crucial resource. 
The new Assistant Director-General 
for Education, Nicholas Burnett, puts 
forward in an interview his vision 
 of the Organization’s mission to pro-
mote education. In spite of extremely 
strict budgetary restrictions, he does 
not believe that financial resources 
represent a real problem. 

The article “Towards inclusive knowl-
edge societies”, describing the 
communication and information 
sector, highlights freedom of ex-
pression and the ways in which 
the new technologies contribute to 
safeguarding knowledge and shar-
ing information. “Making room for 
dialogue”, about the social and 
human sciences sector, defines ca-
pacity building as the sector’s num-
ber-one goal. 
The features in this latest UNESCO 
Courier include a chronological pre-
sentation of past sessions of the 
General Conference since 1946; 
excerpts from the international sym-
posium “60 Years of UNESCO” 
(2005); clips of early Courier ar-
ticles about the General Confer-
ence; and a closer look at the 
Organization’s budget.
