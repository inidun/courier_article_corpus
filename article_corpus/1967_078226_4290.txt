AFRICAN ARCHITECTURE
OLD AND NEW
Town planning and architecture are two
fields in which the transformation ofAfri¬
can ways of life is now being unmistakably
revealed. Many countries a/ready have the
services of young African architect-plan¬
ners whose work associates the most
modern building techniques with work¬
ing methods, resources and social needs
of their regions. Until now home building
in Africa was a " family affair " and pro¬
duced a building which corresponded to
the crafts and skills, needs and tastes of
those who would occupy it. Village homes,
in fact, are often models of architectural
and aesthetic excellence. Today, as new
forms of society develop, Africa's archi¬
tects are called upon to evolve a style
and an approach to housing and urban
development that not only reflects tra¬
dition but has a functional modern utility.

Northern Cameroon village. The
harmony of its lines and proportions
reflects an architectural skill refined
over many years and exploiting to the
full the simple local materials.
Right, a clay-built arcade at a house in
Lahinde (Cameroon). Here the
traditional builder is revealed as an
artist whose manipulation of light and
shade creates harmonious compositions
that change throughout the day.

mosque at Djenna
(Mali). It is built in
the Sudanese style
which characterizes
the architecture of
a vast area bordering
the south of the
Sahara and crossing
the breadth of Africa.

building in Lagos
(Nigeria) designed by
a young Nigerian
architect, Oluwole
Olusegun Olumuyiwa.
After studying in
Europe and several
African countries, he
set up his own
agency in Lagos, and
has since become
co-director of Africa's
first architectural
review "The West
African Builder and
Architect". He has
designed many of
Nigeria's new
buildings, particularly
schools.

A typical example of the
ultra-simple architectural
techniques of the past, it
is preserved as part of
Africa's cultural
heritage.

MORE SCHOOLS
BETTER HOUSING
An African architect, H. Ekwuene of
Nigeria (above) inspects final work
on a new school for Lagos. Top,
modern lines and traditional designs

It has been estimated that to put
every child in Tropical Africa into
primary school by 1980, at least
450,000 new classrooms will be
needed. With this immense task in
mind, Unesco in 1961 set up a
regional educational building centre
in Khartoum (Sudan) to advise Afri¬
can countries on school construction
suited to their different climates, top¬
ography and population patterns.
