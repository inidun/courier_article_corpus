A
vast complex of megalithic
monuments, stone sarcophagi and
nearly 400 statues, some over 4 metres
high, mark the birthplace in Colombia
of a prehistoric culture which remained
virtually unknown until the beginning
of this century.
The "San Agustín culture", as it is
called, takes its name from a nearby
village that nestles on the eastern
flanks of the central Andean Cordillera,
1,700 metres (5,600 ft.) above sea level,
in a countryside of rolling hills inter¬
spersed with higher peaks and forest
ranges. . It is here that the great Mag¬
dalena river rises, the region being
watered also by the Muíales, Quin-
chana, Bordones and other rivers.
In the immediate neighbourhood
of San Agustín and farther "afield,
scattered over hills and valleys, are
temples, mounds, tombs, statues and
other remains, the remarkable heritage
in stone of a civilization older than
that of the Peruvian Inca civilization
which lasted from 1200 A.D. until the
Spanish conquest in 1532.
Even today, after years of research,
many questions concerning the origins,
chronology and relationships of the
San Agustín culture with other civiliza¬
tions are largely a matter of conjecture.
Extending over several hundred square
kilometres, the San Agustín area is
today a national "Archaeological Park"
in which many ancient ruins are
probably still buried or overgrown with
forest vegetation.
Although the Spanish Conquistadores
explored and occupied the region in
the mid-1 6th century, no mention of
the remains is made in the chronicles
of historians of the time such as Fray
Pedro Simón, Pedro Cieza de León, or
Don Juan de Castellanos.

Like some strange creatures sheltering from the elements under
a canopy of stone and branches, the statues, left and above, are two of
a whole group that has recently been found in the thick Jungles and
mountains of the Andean Cordillera In southern Colombia. This "San Agustín
culture", as it is now called, took shape 2,500 years ago and
flourished for 15 centuries. The stylized form and gigantic size of the statues
bear a certain resemblance to those of the Aztecs and Zapotees In ancient Mexico.

Many statues in the
San Agustín region of Colombia
have a second figure
perched on their shoulders.
The meaning of this is not
known, but certainly must
have been some form
of religious symbolism.
The strange double figure,
left, measures nearly 2 metres
(over 6 ft) In height.

SAN AGUSTÍN (Continued)
The manuscript
on the Island of
treasures of the area appeared in the
chronicles of the Spanish friar Juan de
Santa Gertrudis, who visited the region
in 1757. He recounts his meeting with
a Catholic priest from the city of
Popayán who was eagerly excavating
the tombs and mounds in search of
hidden treasure. It was probably due
to this man and other treasure hunters
that most of the monuments now known
were unearthed. Unfortunately, Fray
Juan de Santa Gertrudis' manuscript
lay neglected" in the friary of Palma de
Mallorca for 200 years and was not
published until 1956.
Some forty years after Friar Juan,
in 1797, the Colombian scholar Fran¬
cisco José de Caldas visited the site
and published a short description of it
in a treatise on the geography of this
region.
Colombian, French, English, Italian
and German travellers who visited San
Agustín during the 19th century
mention its mysterious and spectacular
stone monuments in their reports.
However, the full importance and
richness of its culture was not
revealed to the world until the German
archaeologist Konrad Theodor Preuss,
who worked in the area from 1913 to
1914, published an account of his
discoveries in his book "Prehistoric
Monumental Art".
In 1935, the Colombian Ministry of
Education acquired a large tract of
land and established the "Archaeolo¬
gical Park", thus bringing the principal
ruins under government protection.
In 1936-1937, the Colombian archae¬
ologist, José Pérez de Barradas,
carried out the first official excavations
for his country and, in 1943, produced
the most detailed study of the site
published thus far. Another Colom¬
bian expert, Luis Duque Gómez, has
since conducted further excavations
and research.
Some thirty major archaeological
sites have been discovered in the
general area of San Agustín. Some
have rather extraordinary names: Alto
de Lavapatas (footbath mountain),
Alto' de Lavaderas (washerwoman
mountain), Las Mesitas (the small
plateaux), Alto de Los ídolos (mountain
of the idols).
The San Agustín civilization probably
extended over a period of more than
1,500 years and is described by Pérez
de Barradas as a "northern Andean
megallthic culture".

On the evidence of excavations and
the results of radiocarbon dating tests,
Luis Duque Gómez has suggested a
sequence of three periods: the first,
lasting roughly from 555 B.C. to
425 A.D., is characterized by shaft
graves with side chambers, wooden
coffins, wooden sculpture, early gold-
work, pottery bowls and vessels with
painted and incised decoration, bark
cloth, maize and root agriculture.
According to Duque, the middle
period lasted from 425 to 1180 A.D.
and is characterized by burial urns and
mounds, monolithic sarcophagi, crema¬
tion and statuary. Metallurgical tech¬
niques such as hollow casting in the
cire perdue technique and wire-work
are' added.
The third and last period, lasting
from the 12th century to an unknown
later date, is distinguished by its
realistic stone sculpture, circular
houses and loom weaving.
Some authorities believe that the
San Agustín civilization in the northern
Andes is related to the Chavin
civilization in Peru and even to that
of Tiahuanaco further south in Bolivia.
It is possible, and some authorities
believe, even probable, that Central
America, including Mexico, played a
role in the development of the civiliza¬
tions of the Andes. In recent years
evidence has been accumulating that
the roots of the Chavin culture of Peru
are derived from a Mesoamerican
source located in the Olmec country
(the area now covered by the Mexican
states of Veracruz, Tabasco and
Oaxaca).
Ancient navigators from Central
America coasting along the northern
shores of South America apparently
introduced into Peru the jaguar cult
and many elements of the associated
art style, along with maize farming.
These contacts probably date from the
9th century B.C., and it seems likely
that the idea of the jaguar cult also
spread into what is now Colombia,
thus reaching San Agustín about
500 B.C. But this cultural influx was
not a one-way process from Central
America southwards, it was also a
northward movement from Peruvian
cultures into Colombia.
The basic characteristics of the San
Agustín culture can be classified into
three categories. According to the
archeologist Konrad Preuss they are:
(1) its massive stone monuments,

Above, this massive
statue, measuring over
2 metres (over 6 ft)
high and 14 metres
(almost 5 ft) wide,
portrays a sun god
holding a sceptre in
each hand. It belongs
to the so-called classical
period of the Colombian
culture of San Agustín,
which lasted from the
4th to the 12th century
A.D. The diadem

innumerable statues, and stone coffins
weighing tons, sometimes found in
huge stone-built tombs; (2) the
recurring forms of stone carving such
as large mouths with long pointed
fangs and statues with a second figure
crouching on the head or back;
(3) stone streamers emerging from the
mouths of statues, the tip of each
streamer terminating in a tiny head.
San Agustin's architectural monu¬
ments are its temples and tombs built
of massive slabs of stone. Embedded
vertically ¡n the ground, the stone walls
of the temples strangely recall the
dolmens, or prehistoric standing
stones, of Europe and elsewhere.
The outstanding art form of San
Agustín culture is its monumental
sculpture, principally its statues which
display an extraordinary variety and
wealth of detail. They range in height
from 40 cm. to over 4 metres (15 in.
to 13 ft.) and their forms and styles
suggest that their development was
spread over a long period of time.
According to Pérez de Barradas,
religion and magic directly inspired the
sculpture of San Agustín, although the
treatment of certain images is
extremely realistic. Like the Zapote-
cas figures ¡n Mexico, "some of the
San Agustín statues, for all their
stylization and contorted forms, reflect
a rare knowledge of anatomy."
But as in the case of the Aztec art
of Mexico, the San Agustín artists
worked according to a set of strict
rules so that the disproportion of head
and body and the often grotesque
forms and attitudes of their statues are
no accident. The effect is impressive,

particularly in the case of monumental
statuary such as the famous triangular
head nearly two and a half metres
(8 ft.) high.
As a rule, the heads are dispro¬
portionately large, the body squat and
thick-set, the limbs short and rigid.
The most elaborately worked part is
the face, which often shows a very
large mouth with long pointed fangs.
Half man, half feline, the statues are
adorned with necklaces and bracelets;
some hold maces or sceptres, others
bear trophies or clubs.
Many have protruding tongues, a
detail also found on statues in many
Pacific island cultures, in China and
south-east Asia and on Indian sculp¬
tures in north-eastern Canada.
The meaning of the religious sym¬
bolism of the San Agustín figures is
still obscure since many important
details are missing in the general
picture of San Agustín culture. Awe¬
some representations of anthropo¬
morphic gods abound as well as lesser
deities in the shapes of snakes, lizards,
monkeys and eagles.
"The man of San Agustín," writes
Pérez de Barradas, "was content to
spend his life in a straw hut, but for
his gods he built temples of massive
stones which by titantic effort he cut
and carried from his quarry. For his
own use he made rudimentary imple¬
ments of stone, which he never
improved; but inspired by his adora¬
tion for the gods, he used these rough
tools to carve, with infinite patience
and devotion, the statues of his deities
which today astound us by their
immense size and consummate art."

IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL PARK
The photos on these two pages show a representative
sample of the different types of statues belonging
to the San Agustin culture. They were photographed
in a jungle area of southern Colombia which
has now been set aside as an "archaeological park".
Photo No. 2 shows a god apparently wearing a hat,
which is most unusual. Photo No. 4 has been
described as a flutist. Below, half-human,
