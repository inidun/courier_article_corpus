B e n i n : j u s t i c e on the horizon
w René Lefort
The law is paramount in Benin, but the courts and the police are still not 
e n f o rcing it effectively
‘Twe n t y - five thieves bu rned alive in Benin by
v i gilante gr o u p s ,” read the headline on a
recent news agency story. After a spate of
r o b b e ries and rapes, the thieve s , mostly immigr a n t s ,
were publicly burned to death in the southeastern
p r ovince of Couffo in A u g u s t . The gove rn m e n t
sent troops to beef up the local police, but lynch law
is spreading and replacing police work and the judi-
cial process.
Yet the U. S . S t ate Department and human
rights organizations both within and outside Benin
s ay the country has become “a constitutional demo-
cracy” and “is now living under the rule of law”.
Benin is held up as an example in sub-Saharan
A f ri c a , where “the wind of democracy ”t h at blew in
the early 1990s is otherwise dying down.
Benin is ahead of the pack,says Maurice Glele
Ahanhanzo, a member of the country’s constitu-
tional court, because legal principles are now so
deeply rooted in the population that “they have
become the main instrument for regulating life in
s o c i e t y ” .H owe ve r , the Beninese can see that these
principles are still very far from being effectively
applied, even by the courts. They draw their own
c o n c l u s i o n s , all too often by taking the law into
their own hands.
Benin’s “democratic revival”is home-grown—
it hasn’t been copied from elsewhere. Unlike the
situation in many other French-speaking African
states,it does not stem from the loss of a powerful
ally after the Berlin Wall came down. Nor is it the
result of pressure following France’s decision,
announced by President François Mitterrand in a
speech to francophone A f rican leaders in June
1 9 9 0 , to make aid to A f rican countries conditional
upon their progress towards democracy. If there has
been any outside influence, it has come from the
foreign aid agencies whose intervention became
indispensable because of Benin’s ru n d own eco-
nomy.
The “democratic revival”is above all the result
of a dynamic process within Beninese society that
was triggered by the rejection of 17 ye a rs of
“Marxist-Leninist” dictatorship.The old regime’s
death knell was sounded in February 1990 by a
c o n f e r e n c e , the first of its kind in A f ri c a ,t h at brought
together the “dynamic forces of the nat i o n ” . A
constitution adopted a few months later was “in its
entirety devised, sought for and drafted by the
people of Benin,” s ays A h a n h a n z o. It started by
“ a f firming the deep-rooted opposition” of the Beni-
nese people to the previous regi m e ’s legal viola-
tions and other failings.
A counterweight
to the authorities
Another factor lies in the prestigious history of
B e n i n , previously known as Dahomey, and the nos-
t a l gia it gi ves rise to. The educational system wa s
much better than elsewhere.The country was a seed-
plot of intellectuals and earned the nickname “ t h e
L atin Quarter of A f ri c a ” after the famous Pa ris stu-
dent distri c t . Its “ gr a d u at e s ” staffed colonial admi-
n i s t r at i ve services all over West A f ri c a .The remarkable
“ d e m o c r atic reviva l ” fits into a long history that
Beninese are ve ry proud of. The preamble to the
constitution states that Beninese want to “once more
be the pioneers of democracy and the defenders of
human rights that we were until quite recently.”
The constitution devotes 33 articles to a detailed
exposition of all basic rights, as if its authors had
wanted to cover all the authoritarian practices the
c o u n t ry had experi e n c e d . The articles set fort h
p o l i t i c a l ,c i v i l , economic and social ri g h t s ,i n c l u d i n g
a “ right to deve l o p m e n t ” in all its form s. A b ove
a l l , the document makes the constitutional court the
keystone of the new rule of law.The court is empo-
wered to gi ve an opinion, when requested to do so,
on any prospective laws or regulations which might
i n f ringe human ri g h t s. E ven more import a n t , i t
can also, on its own initiat i ve , pass judgment on such
laws or regulations after they have been adopted.
What’s more, any citizen can bring a suit of thisw Director of the UN E S C O C o u r i e r
Mathieu Kérékou,democratically elected president of Benin in 1996.He was required 
by the country’s constitutional court to retake the oath of office after leaving out several
words during the first ceremony.

nature before the court without paying a fee.
This fa c i l i t y, which does not exist in the wo r l d ’s
old,most entrenched democracies,is widely used.
Around a third of the court ’s 468 decisions up to the
end of 1998 concerned human rights violations.
Some other decisions have been widely tru m p e t e d .
The court ’s seven judges annulled the election of the
wife of the country ’s first democrat i c a l l y - e l e c t e d
p r e s i d e n t , Nicéphore Soglo, as a parliamentary
d e p u t y.They also forced his successor, f o rmer dic-
tator Mathieu Kérékou, who was democratically
elected in March 1996, to re-take his oath of offic e
because he had “omitted” several words the first
time round.
The court has become the main counterwe i g h t
to the authorities because of its wide powe rs and the
extremely independent way it has used them. Its
i n t e grity is unquestioned. According to a recent
survey1 it is the country’s best-known institution
and, for 94 per cent of those polled, the one they
trust most.
Totally different opinions were expressed about
the police and the other courts,however. All those
polled felt that “a policeman can wield complete
p ower over you at the drop of a hat ” . A r b i t r a ry
a rr e s t s ,u n a u t h o rized searches, b rutal detention in
custody for longer than the maximum legal period
are common, and prison conditions are inhuman.
Ninety-two per cent of those who took part in the
s u rvey said they had no confidence in the legal
system because it was corrupt and too slow.
“ T h e r e ’s a two-speed approach to civil libert i e s ,”
s ays Julien To g b a d j a , head of Benin’s Human Rights
L e a g u e . “At the top yo u ’ ve got tremendous freedom;
at the bottom, m a s s i ve violat i o n s.” Ninety-four per
cent of those polled said “powerful people often
intervene to halt or pervert the course of justice.”
The judges have some solid arguments on their
side,starting with their extremely inadequate faci-
lities and pay. The first computers , for example,
h ave only just arri ved—as a gi f t . Justice gets a
n o rmal share of the national budget (1.6 per cent in
1999) but the country has only 144 judges (one for
every 8,000 citizens),a fifth of the figure in indus-
t rialized countri e s. G i ven their meagre salaries ran-
ging from $200 to $600 a month gr o s s , h e r o i c
efforts are needed to resist bribery.
For ordinary citizens, justice is remote. T h e
only court of appeal sits in the capital and 90 per
cent of the population neither speak nor read French,
the only language used in law books and tri a l s. In pri n-
c i p l e , legal fees don’t exist, but the courts are increa-
singly asking those involved to contribute to their
c o s t s.A l s o, for cultural reasons, l awsuits create hat r e d
and bitterness which endure for generations. As a
r e s u l t , Beninese go in for extra-legal “ a rr a n g e m e n t s ”
and at worst resort to lynching.
Democratic revival
But they still want the law to be more widely
a p p l i e d . “Civil society is ve ry active in the face of the
authorities’ many attempts to curb freedoms,” says
Togbadja.The impetus for this mobilization comes
from the independent media (about 10 newspapers ,
a dozen radio stations and four television channels),
human rights NGOs (no less than 100 of them), t h e
churches and, says Togbadja, “a handful” of politi-
c i a n s. This is because “the political class grew up
under the old totalitarian regi m e ,” s ays V i r gile A k p ovo
of the Human Rights Institute.
The democratic revival is going strong, chorus
Benin’s human rights campaigners.They are parti-
cularly happy about the start of a programme to
m o d e rnize the legal system and improve pri s o n
c o n d i t i o n s , as well as to apply a constitutional clause
t h at says human rights must be taught in schools and
even in the armed forces.
But the activists also firmly agree that the move-
ment is fragile and that the main threat comes not
from people’s attitudes or from laws or institutions,
but from underdevelopment. Social and economic
rights are virtually a dead letter because of widespread
corruption and impoverishment.
In addition, s ays A h a n h a n z o,“there can be no ru l e
of law without a stat e .” He criticizes liberalization and
structural adjustment policies, and asks “how can
anyone think of downsizing a state which is already
in poor shape?” As Senegalese President A b d o u
Diouf likes to point out, “hunger is incompat i b l e
with democracy,” because it means people “ c a n ’t
play their part as citizens.” n
