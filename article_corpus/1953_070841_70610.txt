THE RIGHT TO DIFFER
UNESCO
"The happiness of the
times was e : tlraordinary.
because it icas lawful to
think tL'hat you wished,
and to say tL'hat you
thought".
so wrote the Roman historianTacitus in the first century 01
the Christian era when he set
down his account of life under one
of the nine Roman emperors
through whose reigns he lived.
Tacitus was fortunate to be able to
record such a state of affairs, for
in the eighteen centuries which
have passed since he wrote h ; s
Histories, freedom of thought and
expression has been the exceptio II
rather than the rule.
Even today there are few places
in the world where the diffusion of
ideas is not restricted in one way
or another. In the 1948 Declaration
of Human Rights the Article
regarded as the most daring-some
people refer to it as Utopian-is
Article 19 which states that the
right to freedom of opinion and
expression includes"freedom to
seek, receive and impart in-
formation and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers".
Now the right to impart an idea
is quite different from mere
freedom of thought. Although the
theocratic and absolutist regimes
have been the only ones to pursue
heresy and insubordination into the
very conscience of men, most
authorities, even liberal and de-
mocratic ones, have appointed
limits to the right to propagate
ideas that every man can hold as
his private view. These limits
have often been somewhat strict in
the case of political and social
ideas that are considered sub-
versive either by governments or
by majority opinion.
At what point does an individual
ceasP to have the right to say
everything, to spread his opinions,
hroadcast and to criticize every-
thing ? At what point do the
authorities begin to have the right
of defending themselves against
attack or of protecting existing
societies from destruction ?
We can only note that in the
course of history, and particularly
for the last two hundred years,
constant progress has made the
propagation of ever more daring
ideas possible ; that cruel, corrupt
and unhealthy regimes are vul-
nerable to such freedom of ex-
pression ; but that regimes founded
on the free consent of individuals
draw strength from it. At all
periods, the progress of civilization
has been retarded by lack of
freedom in the dissemination of
ideas and opinions. An idea
cannot be killed by censorship or
prohibition, but its advance can
long be delayed.
The invention of printing in the
fifteenth century placed a formi-
dable'weapon in the hands of
innovators and reformers, whose
resources increased with the spread
of pamphlets and, later, perio-
dicals. Little brochures like those
printed in the United Provinces of
Holland were the best, and the most
feared by absolute monarchs.
The propaganda"war"waged
between Louis XIV and the Dutch
gazetteers is an amusing instance
of this. The Dutch, feeling that
their independence vas threatened,
encouraged these gazettes. Louis
XIV, powerless to stop their
circulation, remonstrated with the
Dutch authorities. The latter pro-
mised to take severe measures
against the gazettes, but did
nothing'whatever. Louis XIV then
paid gazetteers to attack and abuse
the Government of the United
Provinces, and thus a sort of
compromise was effected. But it
remained the custom to stamp
"Printed in Amsterdam"on most
of the clandestine books in France,
especially those written by philo-
sophers.
At the time of the American War
of Independence, the vritings of
Tom Paine, The Crisis and Common
Sense, recruited many a soldier for
George Washington's armies. In
Paris, from 1789 to the time of the
Directoire, people devoured po-
litical newspapers, but freedom of
opinion was under a cloud during
the Consulate and Empire, owing
to the severity of Napoleon's police.
The struggle was renewed under
the Restoration, and'public feeling
was so strong on the side of
freedom of opinion that the seizing
and destroying of the Temps and
the National newspapers'printing
presses was the signal for the 1830
revolution, which put an end to the
Bourbon dynasty. Under Napo-
leon III, newspapers expressing
political opinions kept alive the
republican faith and since 1R71,
freedom of opinion has remained
a tradition in the French press.
On the other hand, French
tradition is less tolerant than that
of England and America as regards
open-air meetings in streets and
parks, and the right of every man
to give vent to his viewvs in
public places. In this matter, each
country has its own customs and
characteristics. But there are few
nations, if any, where the diffusion
of all ideas by every available
means is permitted withrmt re-
striction.
There is no doubt that, in certain
parts of the world, freedom of in-
formation is in retrogression. On
the other hand it is noteworthy that.
the new Republic of India has,
through its Constituent Assembly,
proclaimed the right to freedom of
speech and expression for all its
citizens.
When it comes to be generally
admitted that if. is I1 sign of
strength in authorities to grant all
citizens a wide measure of freedom
of discussion, and that to suppress
that freedom is a sign of fear and
therefore of weakness, Article 19
of the 1948 Declaration will readily
find its place in national legal
systems.
At present, however, the various
authorities, and even certain sec-
tions of public opinion, are not
ready to give this sign of strength.
They still believe in suppressing
opposition, which means that they
fear ! bait free discussion would be
fatal to their own ideas. They sin
from a great lack of faith, perhaps
because they have never seriously
taken stock of their own ideas.
He who holds strong opinions
and feels he can make them
prevail seeks free discussion and
does not retreat from it. He who
needs freedom in order to impart
ideas which he feels to be right
does not fear the freedom of others.
These principles are equally
applicable to freedom of religion.
From time immemorial, men con-
vinced that they possess the truth
have thought it their duty to im-
pose it, by law or force, on other
men whose idea of the truth was
different, and those who serve one
god have called those who serve
another god,"infidels".
It was often easy, in days gone
by, to convert a whole nation to the
religion of its ruler ; but it has
always been difficult to make men
of one belief live peacefully side
by side with men of another.
Nevertheless, tolerance was
widely practised in ancient times
especially in the Far East. An-
cient Chinese philosophy, for ins-
tance, was based on a doctrine
known as"non-injury'., or"non-
interference". that is, non-inter-
ference'. vith the rights and lives of
others. In seventh century Japan,
Prince Shotoku promulgated il
system of laws that were dis-
llCnguished by their humanity and

tolerance. Buddhism teaches re-
spect for the beliefs of others.
Hinduism, as llahatma Gandhi
explained, is not an exclusive
religion. It tells everyone to
worship God according to his own
faith or dharma, and so it lives in
peace with all the religions.
Jewish doctrine, taken from the
laws of Israel, forbids hatred :
"Thou shalt not hate thv brother in
thy heart"'""thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself"..."thou shalt
love a stranger as thyself..."
Similarly, we have the example of
Christian doctrines :"Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself"and,
In the first epistle of St. John :"He
that loveth not his brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath not seen ?"
Like the Old and New Tes-
taments, the Koran exhorts Mos-
lems to respect Christian beliefs.
A striking example of this to-
lerance was the scrupulous respect
for freedom of worship practised
by the Moors when they conquered
Spain at the beginning of the
present millenary, at a time when
culturally and politically the power
of the Arab world was greatest.
Furthermore, this tolerance of-
fered an example to the Christian
world which had not always paid
attention to the exhortation of
Tertullian, a Doctor of the Church
who lived from 160 to 240 A. n.
allow one man to adore the true
God", he said,"another man to
adore Jupiter ; allow one man to
raise his arms to heaven, and
another to stretch his toward the
altar of faith... Beware that it be
not a kind of irreligion to take
away freedom of religion and the
option of God, and not to allow me
to adore the God I wish to adore..."
Examples of tolerance, however,
are not lacking in the Western
world despite the persecutions and
massacres that sometimes took
place in the very name, and for the
greater glory, of the God who
preached love and forgiveness.
In France, after the Wars of
Religion, Henry IV pacified his
country by the celebrated Edict of
Nantes, of 1598 ; it \vas later
revoked by the narrow despotism
of Louis XIV. King Sigismund of
Transylvania allowed four re-
ligions to be freely practised in his
kingdom. Poland at first conceded
religious freedom both to Pro-
testants and to the Greek Orthodox
Church. The United Provinces
(the Netherlands) recognized free-
dom of conscience as early as the
seventeenth century.
In contrast to these examples is
that of the Inquisition which dealt
sewre[y with'the Bog-ami ! : : ; in
Bosnia and with the \YaldensE'S in
Piedmont ; and which, in Bohemia,
sentenced John Buss to the stake.
In France, the Inquisition was
suppressed in 1 :") 00, but in Spain
it came to an end only in 18U (i.
It was to the eighteenth century
that fell the honour of fighting
religious intolerance unremittingly
and defeating it almost every-
where, at least legally.
The writings of : \IontesquiE'u and
of YoItaiJ'e, and those of the
Encyclopedists, influenced the
spirit of the times and the minds
of liberal European monarchs.
The Emperor Joseph II, Fre-
derick II of Prussia and Catherine
the Great of Russia recognized or
extended freedom of worship. In
England, the right to teach was
conceded to Catholics in 1Ã¬ ! H. The
United States was the first country
to make freedom of conscience a
fundamental law. According to
the Constitution of 1789, public
o1Iices could be filled by persons of
all creeds. An amendment in-
troduced in 1791 prescribed that
Congress coup not establish a
State religion, or forbid the free
exercise of any religion.
In France, freedom of worship
was instituted in 1795. Bonaparte

settled the relations between the
Catholic Church and the State hv
the Concol'dat of 1801, which
remained in force until the
complete separation of Church and
State in if)') 2. The Protestant and
Jewish religions benefited from
the terms of the Concordat, which
tstablished unrestricted ff (pdom or
conscience throughout alt French
territories.
Other concordats were conclude
between Pope Pius IX and Austria
Spain, and the main States Of
Germanv and South America. Re-
ligious persecution, property so
called, had disappeared from the
Western world. It reappeared, in
an aggravated form, under to-
talilarian regimes, that nightmal'e
of modern times.
We should not forget, how-eve)',
that if the spirit of persecution is
declining in the matter of religious
beliefs it has never been more
aggressive in the political and the
social sphere. The old intolerance
characteristic of religious fanatics
has reappeared in disturbing
fashion in regard to persons who
do not conform to prevailing po-
litical doctrines. In various plar'ps'"
in this respect the final conquest of
the rights of the human person in
our world of today is far from
having been achieved.
