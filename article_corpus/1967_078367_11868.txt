CORDOBA (ARGENTINA)
TAKES NOISE ABATEMENT
BY THE HORNS

IHE city of Cordoba in
Argentina, where I live, has over
600,000 inhabitantsand some 50,000
motorcycles and motorscooters.
Cordoba's municipal regulations on
noise were introduced many years ago
and had long been ineffective. Yet
nothing was being done to bring them
up to date. This fact, coupled with
an explosive growth and the wave of
industrialization which began in the
1940s, had given Cordoba one of the
highest noise levels of any city in
Argentina. This applied not only .to
downtown Cordoba, with its constant
roar of traffic, but also to residential
areas among which industrial plants
and shops of all kinds had been ins¬
talled.
In 1960 we started our first noise
abatement campaign, sponsored joint¬
ly by the municipal authorities, the Uni¬
versity of Cordoba and a number of
private organizations. A noise sympo¬
sium was held and it was decided
to ask the International Association
Against Noise to assist Argentina in
setting up a National League Against
Noise.
An official "Silence Week" followed
the symposium and did much to arouse
public interest in the need for noise
control. It also brought some relief

national Association Against Noise, in- 1966,
at Baden-Baden (Federal Republic of Ger¬
many).
As a rapidly
developing centre
of commerce and
industry, Cordoba
won the unenviable
reputation of being
one of the noisiest
cities in Argentina.
In the past seven
years, however, the
city authorities and
the University of
Cordoba have been
campaigning against
the noise nuisance,
launching educational
programmes and
tightening up local
anti-noise regulations.

through the temporary suppression of
automobile horns and loudspeaker
advertising. But the improvement was
short lived because of the lack of
inspectors and the inadequacy of
Cordoba's noise regulations.
In 1964 we set up Argentina's first
Noise Abatement Council (Consejo
Permanente de Lucho contra el Ruido)
following which Argentina was admitted
to the International Association Against
Noise the same year.
I would like now to outline our case
history that might assist other towns
and countries in a similar situation.
Firstly, our new anti-noise municipal
regulation distinguishes between "un¬
necessary" and "excessive" noise. It
classifies over 15 unnecessary noises
which can be penalized without re¬
course to noise level measurement or
analysis.

Since the application of the anti-
noise law we have classified as un¬
necessary noises all public address
systems that can be heard outside
enclosed premises, including music,
publicity and speeches.
The second category (excessive
noise) covers those that even when
justified may exceed limits that affect
the well being and tranquility of our
citizens. For the first time in our
legislation, we have established noise
levels based on European criteria: av¬
erage levels for day-time (6 a.m. to
10 p.m.) and night-time (10 p.m. to
6 a.m.), as well as infrequent peak
levels (up to six hours) and frequent
peaks (more than six hours) which are
allowed in each case.
Since we have not been able to
make a noise survey of the city nor to
delineate appropriate zones, we have

had to ciassify environments in the
following categories: hospitals and
similar Institutions; residential sections,
schools and small shops; downtown
business areas and multi-storied build¬
ings; industrial areas and main roads
or freeways.
It has been something of a prob¬
lem1 to classify the appropriate environ¬
ment in each case. But some difficul¬
ties notwithstanding, the system works
well and has led to few controversies.
"Critical" areas for hospitals and con¬
valescent homes have been established
and circles of 200 metres diameter
drawn around these institutions. The
law has been modified to exclude all
noisy industries such as metal works
and factories from these areas. Exist¬
ing industries of this type have been
invited to find new locations.
We realize that to obtain more pre¬
cise data we shall have to carry out a
noise survey of Cordoba City. But so
far we have found that our noise level
readings correspond closely to sub¬
jective complaints on noise, and that
the public is satisfied in places where
the established levels are not
exceeded.
Vehicle noise limits have been based
on the results of experiments in other
countries, chiefly Switzerland.
A team of five men trained in our
laboratory checks noisy vehicles on
main thoroughfares. These inspectors
are not yet equipped to measure noise
levels but their estimates of abusive
noises have been highly accurate (an
error of one per cent or less was
noted in the first year, when 3,000
noise offenders were fined). When
offenders contest noise estimates,
they must report immediately to the
noise laboratory for an official test.
OTORCYCLES are our
greatest problem. There is one mo¬
torcycle or motorscooter for every
12 persons in our city and these vehi¬
cles are usually driven at high speeds.
Some motorcycles have silencers of
poor quality, and our laboratory is
studying how to improve the efficiency
of silencers on models manufactured in
Argentina. In our view, the ¡deal sys¬
tem of control would be an obligatory
test of motorcycle silencers once a
year when driving licences are
renewed.
Horns and silencers fitted on cars
and motorcycles do not come under
municipal jurisdiction and so we need
a national law to exercise a control on
their manufacture. The same applies
to noise checks on Argentina's inter-
provincial highways. And for a more
effective restraint of noise offenders,
co-ordination between municipal autho¬
rities is needed within each province.
An important feature of Cordoba's
Noise Abatement Council is that its
function is not only to advise on noise
reduction, but also to decide on the
application of penalties for noise
offences.
L
IABILITY for an infringe¬
ment of noise regulations covers not
only those directly responsible, but
anyone associated with the offence.
Penalties include fines, temporary or
permanent cancellation of driving li¬
cences and the closing (temporarily or
permanently) of shops, clubs and other
businesses.
In Cordoba, we have studied some
of the psychological aspects of noise
offences. Why, for example, do
drivers, and especially motorcyclists,
remove or modify the mufflers on their
vehicles? Is it because a personality
defect makes them enjoy excessive
noise? Or does the noisy urban envi¬
ronment give them a kind of "thirst
for noise?"
In our survey of this problem we
have questioned offenders, but it is
still too early to venture an expla¬
nation on the basis of solid statistical
data. In the case of motorcyclists
the most common one in our exper¬
ience we have reason to believe
that one motivation for having a noisy
machine is the fear of being run into
by automobiles. It has been noticed
for instance that drivers of well-
muffled motorcycles and scooters tend
to "toot" excessively, whereas riders
of noisy machines seldom use their
horns.
Another of our findings is that well
educated people (scientists, scholars,
artists and members of the liberal
professions) are far more susceptible
to the noise of traffic than relatively
uneducated people.
Noise is a social problem and its
solution calls for intensive campaigns
to alert the public to the need for
action. Rapid industrial development
has made it an especially urgent prob¬
lem in Argentina. That is why we
are endeavouring to set up a League
Against Noise to deal with the ques¬
tion on a national scale and with
greater resources.
