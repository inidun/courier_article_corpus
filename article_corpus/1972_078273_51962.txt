Iron-Age Man Preserved
THE BOG PEOPLE OF DENMARK

by P.V. Glob
\^NE spring morning in 1950,
two Danish farmworkers cutting peat
at Tollund Fen in central Jutland dis¬
covered a body in the peat layer they
had just uncovered. Looking down at
the well-preserved features, they could
only suppose that they had come
across the victim of a recent murder.
The police were soon on the scene,
and with them they brought represent¬
atives of the local museum, since
PETER V. GLOB is Director-General of Danish
Museums and Antiquities and Director of the
Danish National Museum in Copenhagen. An
internationally known archaeologist and a
leading authority on Danish prehistory, he
has directed numerous excavations in Den¬
mark, Greenland and the Persian Gulf. For

books on archaeology are 'Ard and the
Plough' (1951), "Rock Carvings in Denmark"
(1969), and "The Mound People" (1970). His
latest book, 'Danish Prehistoric Monuments"
(Faber and Faber, 1971) is an exceptionally
attractive account of the rich heritage of
archaeological remains in Denmark, from the
Stone Age to the Vikings.
well-preserved remains of Iron Age
men were not unknown in the region.
I was hastily summoned from Aarhus
University and, that same evening,
bent over the discovery, I found my¬
self face to face with an Iron Age man
who had been deposited in the peat¬
bog some two thousand years earlier.
The dead man lay on his right side
in a natural attitude of sleep. The
head was to the west, with the face
turned to the south; the legs were to
the east. He lay fifty yards out from
firm ground and had been covered by
eight or nine feet of peat.
On his head he wore a pointed skin
cap fastened securely under the chin
by a hide thong, and round his waist
was a smooth hide belt. Otherwise
he was naked. His hair was cropped
short and he was clean-shaven,
although his chin and upper lip were
covered with very short stubble.
Round his neck was a rope made
of two leather thongs twisted together
and drawn tight into his throat in a
noose and then coiled like a snake
over his shoulder and down across
the back.
The Tollund man's head was remark¬
ably well preserved, the best pre¬
served human head, in fact, to have
survived from antiquity in any part of
the world. The dead man's lightly-
closed eyes and half-closed lips give
the face a distinctive expression,
calling to mind the words of the
world's oldest heroic epic, the Gil-
gamesh, "the dead and the sleeping,
how they resemble one another."
A wooden crate was assembled on
the site of the discovery so that the
Tollund man could be removed to the
National Museum in Copenhagen in
exactly the position in which he was
found.
The doctors and medico-legal
experts who examined him in Copen¬
hagen concluded that he had probably
been hanged rather than strangled by
the rope found round his neck.
X-Rays showed that the skull was
undamaged and the brain intact but
shrunken. The wisdom teeth had
developed indicating that the man
must have been appreciably over
twenty years old at the time of death.
An autopsy showed that the inner
organs, such as the heart, lungs, and
liver were well preserved as were the
stomach and the large and small
intestines which contained traces of
the dead man's last meal, eaten
between 12 and 24 hours before death.
Apparently this had consisted of a
gruel prepared from barley, linseed,
"gold of pleasure" and various other
weeds, but there was no trace of any
meat or fish.
After these exhaustive examinations,
the head underwent conservation
treatment, and was sent to the Silke-
borg Museum, not far from Tollund,
where it can be seen to this day.
Dark in hue, the majestic, 2,000 year
old head is still full of life; it astonishes
the beholder and rivets his attention.
Barely two years after the discovery
of the Tollund man, in April 1952,
another body was discovered in a
Jutland fen. This time it was in the
Nebelgard Fen at Grauballe, about
eleven miles east of Tollund. When

The head shown here is
2,000 years, and the
hand 1,500 years old. They
belong -to two of the many
well preserved bodies of men
and women discovered
in the peat-bogs of Denmark.
The age of these two bodies has
been confirmed by carbon 14
tests. Tollund Man (left)
has the best preserved head of
any Iron-Age man yet unearthed
from the bogs. The skin
patterns on Grauballe Man's
hand (right) are so clear that
perfect fingerprints some of the
oldest fingerprint patterns in
the worldwere obtained
from them.

I was called to the scene, the man's
head and shoulders were sticking up
out of the dark brown peat. I immedi¬
ately arranged for the body to be
transported to the Museum of Pre¬
history at Aarhus, still in the block of
peat in which it lay.
The Grauballe man had been placed
in his peat grave completely naked
and no objects of any kind were found
in the vicinity. Carbon 14 dating of
the liver and muscle tissue and dating
by pollen analysis placed the date of
death between 210 A.D. and 410 A.D.
X-Rays and examination of various
bone tissues and the teeth established
the Grauballe man's age at around
thirty years.
There could be no doubt about the
cause of death. A long cut ran round
the throat practically from ear to ear.
so deep that the gullet was complet¬
ely severed.
The Grauballe man was perfectly
preserved, though somewhat flattened
by the over-lying peat. His hair was
about six inches in length and short
stubble on his chin and upper lip
showed that he had been clean¬
shaven.
Radiography of the head showed
that the brain was remarkably well
preserved though a little shrunken.
The two halves of the brain and its
convolutions could be clearly seen in
the X-Rays.
His last meal was similar to that of
Tollund man consisting of a gruel of
grain and seed, but containing no
trace of summer or autumn berries or
other fruit or greenstuffs. There are
thus grounds for thinking that both
men met their deaths in winter or
early spring, before everything had
come into leaf. It may be deduced
that they were both sacrificed and
placed in the peat-bog as offerings at
the mid-winter celebrations or the fes¬
tivals of spring.
Examination of the beautifully pre¬
served feet and hands revealed such
clear line patterns that it was possible
to take prints of several of his fingers,
the oldest known fingerprints of any
human being.
When investigation of the Grauballe
man was completed, and before he
was given conservation treatment, a
plaster cast was made of him lying in
exactly the position in which he was
found in the peat-bog.
During the 1,500 years he had lain
in the peat-bog a tanning process had

Top left, this is the famous silver
cauldron recovered in 1891 from
a peat-bog at Gundestrup,
Denmark. The cauldron had been
placed there as a sacrificial
offering. It is splendidly decorated
inside and out with male and
female divinities, religious
processions and sacrificial scenes.
Where this 2,000-year-old
masterpiece of the metalworker's
art originated is not known, but
it may have come to Scandinavia
as booty of war. The "Bog
People" of N.W. Europe, as they
are now called, worshipped
Nerthus, the Earth Mother and
goddess of fertility, to whom they
prayed for good harvests. Detail

been taking place which had pre¬
served him up to our day. This
process begun by nature was success¬
fully completed in a laboratory by the
"pit-tanning" technique, using oak
bark, to which the body was subjected
for just over a year and a half. Since
then the Grauballe man has been
exhibited in the Museum of Prehistory
at Aarhus, where he lies just as he
was found in the peat-bog.
The peat-bogs of north-west Europe
have yielded up nearly 700 bodies of
men, women and children preserved
by nature for twenty centuries. Most
of the bodies of these people, who
lived during the early centuries of the
Christian era, were found in Denmark,
and more than half of them in the
Jutland peninsula and the adjoining
regions of north-west Germany.
Other bog people have been found
in England, Wales, Scotland and Ire¬
land and, in smaller numbers, in Nor¬
way, Sweden and central Europe.
It is the acid in these peat-bogs, as
well as the low oxygen content of bog
water, which has tanned the skin and
hair of the bodies and preserved them
as though they had only recently been
placed there.
But only very few of these bog
people are still in a good state of
preservation. Most of the bodies
crumbled away as soon as they were
exposed to the oxygen in the air,
since no one seemed to know how to
preserve them. A few have been
saved by a careful drying process, in
particular the body of a woman found
at Haraldskjaer in Denmark, in 1837.
The experts of the day thought that
this might have been the body of the
Norwegian Queen" Gunhild who was
murdered by being drowned in a peat¬
bog 900 years earlier.
But the body was later identified as
that of an Iron Age woman dating
back a further thousand years. Her
body is still preserved and lies in the
crypt of the church of St. Nicholas at
Vejle, in Jutland, in an oak coffin
personally presented by King Frede¬
rick VI.
Another early discovery, dating back
to 1780, is that of a woman of rank
unearthed from a peat-bog near Drum-
keragh Mountain in Ireland. She was
dressed in a finely-woven red and
green garment and a stole embroider¬
ed with figures, and she lay on three
woollen blankets.
Other well-preserved bodies of bog
people found in Denmark include
those of a man and a woman, un-

covered in Borre Fen at Himmerland,
in the north of Jutland, near the site
of an early Iron Age village in which
they had probably lived.
The man had been placed in the
peat-bog in a sitting position. The
back of his head was crushed in and
round his neck was à hemp rope
fastened with a slip-knot. Both ends
of the rope were skilfully bound and
stitched with hide thongs to prevent
them from unravelling. He had prob¬
ably been hanged or strangled with
this rope.
The dead man had been brought to
the peat-bog naked except for the
rope around his neck. Rolled up at
his feet, however, were two capes,
sewn together from pieces of light and
dark sheepskin.
The woman lay face downwards on
a sheet of birch bark. The upper part
of her body was uncovered while the
remainder was covered by a woollen
blanket.

^^N an island in the same
Fen, an iron Age village consisting of
some twenty houses has been exca¬
vated. Like most Jutland peasant
houses of two thousand years ago
those of the village of Borre Fen were
dwellings for both men and animals.
The houses varied in size and were
clustered round the village street.
The biggest house is eighty-eight feet
long by twenty-three feet wide and the
smallest is half this length and some¬
what narrower. The walls were made
of turf and the roofs of straw or
heather thatch. The Inhabitants lived
in one half of the house round a
central hearth while the animals
occupied the other half.
Other bog people have been dis¬
covered in Schleswig Holstein close
to Jutland's southern border; they are
now exhibited in the local museum of
Gottorp castle in Schleswig. Among
them are an elderly man and a young
girl found in a peat-bog at Windeby
farm in 1952.
Also to be seen at Gottorp castle
is the head of a man wearing a
curious hair style, described by the
Roman historian Tacitus in his treatise
on the German tribes, written at the
time of the bog people, in the first
century A.D. The reddish hair, origin¬
ally blond, was eleven inches long.
It was gathered at the right side into
a skilfully contrived knot which,
Tacitus tells us, was a style typical of
the Swabian tribe. Similar knots are
to be seen in Roman sculptures
depicting the Germanic tribes.
Writing on human sacrifice among
the Germani, Tacitus states that this
was connected both with the punish¬
ment of crime and the ritual of spring
worship of the gods. Concerning
Germanic law, he writes that accusa
tions and demands for the death
penalty could be brought before the
tribal assembly. Traitors and desert¬
ers were hung from a tree and
cowards and evil-doers were plunged
into the mud of the marshes.
Each year a dramatic ritual of wor¬
ship was enacted to awaken the
forces of nature and to ensure the
germination of corn and the fertility
of man and domestic animals.
Tacitus tells us that on an island in
the ocean there was a holy grove
where no man could set foot. In the
grove was hidden a chariot in which
none but a priest could ride in
company with the goddess.
In this chariot, drawn by oxen,
they drove through the countryside
awakening life and fertility in all things.
The goddess then retired to her divine
abode. The chariot and the goddess
were washed in a secret lake by
slaves and ministrants who were then
drowned in the lake.
The many people found in the peat¬
bogs may, therefore, have been placed
there as punishment for crime or as
sacrifices to the great goddess, whom
Tacitus calls Nerthus, or Mother Earth.
During the centuries preceding and
following the birth of Christ, such a
goddess was worshipped in northern
lands. She is depicted in several
small bronzes wearing only two rings
around her neck and sometimes in
her ears and with her hands under
her life-giving breasts.
The Mother goddess had already
been worshipped in neolithic times.
Her eyes look out at us from the clay
pots of this period and her symbol is
to be seen on slate pendants worn
as amulets.
During the period of the bog people,
in the late iron age, this goddess
reigned supreme over all other gods
and she is represented in highly
stylized form on bronze jewel-pins.
Many bracelets and necklaces have
been discovered in the peat-bogs
where they were placed as offerings.
A magnificent silver cauldron was
found in a peat-bog near Gundestrup
in Jutland. It is decorated with em¬
bossed figures representing, on the
outside, gods and goddesses with
their attendants and, on the inside,
scenes showing the goddess sur¬
rounded by legendary beasts and
human sacrifices.
The Gundestrup cauldron was made
in south-east Europe where it was
captured as war booty, brought back
to Denmark and placed as an offering
in a peat-bog near Borre Fen. But
several of the deities worshipped by
the bog people of Denmark are
represented on the cauldron.
The Tollund man and many of the
other bog men, after their brief time
as the companion and lover of the
goddess, may have been sacrificed
and placed in the peat-bogs in which
they have been so remarkably pre¬
served.
