URING the first anxious
days, those in my country stricken by
the sudden violence of the floods had
to stifle their distress and devote all
their efforts to the immense task of
rescue and protection. At that time,
the sympathy shown by the whole
world stirred feelings of deep gratitude,
encouragement and hope in Italy.
In Tuscany and Venetia, two regions
which are among the richest in monu¬
ments and works of art, the toll of
BRUNO MOLAJOLI is Director-General of
Antiquities and Fine Arts at the Italian
Ministry of Education, Rome. He is an art
historian and a lecturer at the Faculty of
Architecture of the University of Naples,
and has written some 30 books of art
criticism and on the history of art.

damage and destruction is immense,
particularly in Florence and Venice,
though other important historical
centres have also been hit in vary¬
ing degrees.
In Venice it has been found that
the most precious works of art (sculp¬
tures and paintings) in the museums
and churches have escaped injury.
But very serious damage much of
it irreparable has been caused to the
libraries (including the historically im¬
portant Biblioteca Marciana), the Gior¬
gio Cini Foundation, archives and art
collections, art and antique shops.
The chief cause for alarm in Venice
is the state of monuments, churches
and palazzi in the picturesque old parts
of the city. Water polluted with fuel
oil from tanks replenished for the win¬
ter has risen several metres and
seriously defaced and fouled these
buildings. Their restoration will be
long and difficult.
Great anxiety is also felt about the
stability of many important historic
buildings already in a precarious
state and in fact of the entire city.
The surge of the floodwaters placed
abnormal stresses on old walls already
weakened by constant dampness and
on their foundations which, as is well
known, rest on piles. (See Unesco
Courier, January 1965).
The most immediate problems are
those of inspection and of carrying
out the necessary reinforcement and
restoration operations. We fear that
there are unpleasant surprises in store
for us here.
Venice's old ills have become more
acute, thus making us better aware of
the price which has to be paid for its
beauty.
The situation calls
measures:
for radical
the movement of water in the
lagoon must be controlled by making
it independent of the tides in the Adria¬
tic: this is an enormous undertaking
but absolutely essential;
sufficient financial and technical
resources must be made available for
the restoration and maintenance of the
monuments and the historic setting;
a new use as public and cultural
buildings must be found for the main
private palazzi, in order to save them
from the threat and hence from the
risk of being left derelict.
As for Florence, it is a city disfigur¬
ed, an artistic heritage built up over
long centuries of artistic fervour gra¬
vely damaged and in part lost forever
because of the violence of the natural

Dual threat to Venice
Venice has never been in greater peril. Last November, storm tides
breached its protective walls, flooding the city to a depth of several feet
(right) and exposing it to a powerful additional impact from the Adriatic.
The Italian Government has earmarked nearly 40,000 million lire
($63 million) to help save the city. Venice is built on a foundation of
old wooden piles (below) driven into the soft ground of several hundred
tiny islands. The stability of its buildings is increasingly threatened by
subsidence of the lagoon bed (see the "Unesco Courier", January 1965).
Erosion from the surge of waters is also attacking the foundations and
causing increasing damage to monuments, churches, palaces and other
old buildings. An enormous programme of reinforcement and restoration
throughout the city is needed, and also protection from the Adriatic tides.

forces unleashed in the space of a
few hours.
In the centre of Florence, 18 chur¬
ches, with a wealth of works of art,
were flooded with water and mud,
their altars and ornaments overturned,
their paving stones uprooted, the fres¬
coes and paintings on wood adorn¬
ments which made them living mu¬
seums seriously damaged.
Many palazzi of historic interest as
well as museums and libraries have
been damaged. The picturesque
shops of the Ponte Vecchio have
been destroyed. The embankments of
the Arno have been damaged and
parts of them have collapsed.
The list of treasures affected by the
flood is still incomplete. But it is
known already that the following works
of art, to take account of "only the
most famous, have been rescued from
the water:
313 paintings on wood,
431 paintings on canvas,
11 series of frescoes,
39 individual frescoes,
31 frescoes which had been remov¬
ed from their original settings,
14 groups of sculpture,
144 individual sculptures, including
22 wood carvings,
23 illuminated codices.
In all, more than 1,000 works of art
of outstanding importance.
Considered by their respective
periods, the damaged paintings in¬
clude:
over 30 paintings of the 13th and
14th centuries, including works by Ci-
mabue, Lorenzo Monaco, Lorenzetti,
Bernardo Daddi, Giovanni del Biondo;
over 40 paintings of the 15th century,
including works by Fra Angélico, Co-
simo Rosselli, Lorenzo di Credi, Paolo
Schiave, Domenico Veneziano, Neri di
Bicci, Alessio Baldovinetti;
nearly 150 paintings of the 16th cen¬
tury, including works by the greatest
artists of the age, from Bronzino to
Vasari and from Cristoforo Allori to
Poppi and Naldini.
To these must be added the loss
of a quantity, yet to be established
but certainly very great, of lesser
works of art, church ornaments and
vestments, and documents, which,
together with the major works of art,
created in Florence an incomparable
atmosphere of artistic civilization.
Faced by this disaster, we have
tried to provide for the most urgent

needs and to deal with the grave situa¬
tion by every means possible.
We have been greatly touched by
the offers of assistance, the personal
contributions and the supplies of
equipment which began to come in
from all sides as soon as the first
news of the disaster became known.
Foreign museums, international insti¬
tutions, Unesco's International Centre
for the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property in
Rome, and scholars and scientists in
all countries have offered their sup¬
port.
The emergency and the absolutely
exceptional situation in the city of Flo¬
rence made it impossible for us at the
start to call on anyone except the peo¬
ple already on the spot. There is no
doubt, however, that we shall need
to take advantage of these exceptional
offers in the future programme of work
and we shall indeed be glad to count
on them.
For the most pressing needs, the
Italian Government has already allo¬
cated 4 thousand million lire (over
$6.4 million) to save cultural property,
as well as 1,300 million lire (over
$2 million) for the University of Flo¬
rence alone. But it can already be
seen that these costs will have to be
multiplied five-fold for the work of res¬
toration to be undertaken over the
next few years. For Venice, the
government has added 9,000 million
lire ($14.4 million) to the 30 thousand
million lire ($48 million) already allo¬
cated to the preservation of the city.
Over sixty priority operations are at
present in progress in the chief histo¬
ric buildings of Florence and the sur¬
rounding area: they are being cleared
out, the mud is being removed, shaken
structures are being strengthened and
technical studies in view of subsequent
integral restoration work- are being
carried out.
As regards works of art (paintings,
sculptures, tapestries, ancient wea¬
pons, miniatures), priority has been
given to their recovery and then to
a preliminary clean-up; the main
effort is being concentrated on fixing
painted surfaces, which, where they
have not already been lost, are all
in great danger. This is an extremely
delicate operation.
Fifty technicians sent from the main
specialized laboratories in Italy (the
Central Institute of Restoration at
Rome, and the restoration workshops
of Bologna, Milan and Naples) are
now working in the Florence labora¬
tories under the direction of the

Years
to repair
the damage
(Continued)
Superintendent of the Galleries of Flo¬
rence, Professor Ugo Procacci and
his immediate colleagues. Thanks to
their courageous efforts in this diffi¬
cult work, carried out with self-sacri¬
fice and devotion, it has been possible
to rescue a great part of this artistic
heritage and return it to a state in
which it can be saved.
Shifting one crate may be work for a
handyman, but shifting a thousand
crates becomes work for an engineer.
The restoration of a picture is
always a delicate and complex opera¬
tion; but we have to restore several
hundred works of art simultaneously.
This raises problems of unprecedented
scope and complexity: co-ordination of
research in each individual case; mobi¬
lization of technical resources; assess¬
ment of restoration costs, which will
certainly be very high.
Even under the most favourable
conditions, this immense artistic heri¬
tage cannot be quickly and fully res¬
tored. There are technical reasons
why short cuts cannot be taken in
certain operations. It is expected that
several years will be required, certainly
more than five.
Never before have we been faced
with the need to operate on such an
enormous scale, for so many works
of art.
We have a long-term programme
before us, involving much work and
responsibility. We are ready to face
it. We pledge ourselves to this task,
for which we shall be responsible to
the world of culture, convinced that it
will continue to support us with its
understanding, sympathy and co-op¬
eration as it has so admirably done
up to the present.
