Animal organ transplantation into humans may save many lives or cause untold harm from
diseases crossing the species barrier. How should society decide whether or not to go ahead?
■
Just over 15 ye a rs ago, Baby Fa e
became a household name when
American doctors replaced her ailing
h e a rt with the heart of a baboon. F r o m
Australia to Brazil, millions were ri veted by
the news reports and followed her progr e s s
with baited breat h . If they were half-expec-
ting a Frankenstein’s monster, they we r e
d i s a p p o i n t e d . Baby Fae looked like any
other wee newborn child. But the sci-fi l u l-
laby turned grim 20 days after the trans-
p l a n t . On November 15, 1984 Baby Fa e
died.Later her mother angrily maintained
t h at she hadn’t been informed about the
possible dangers invo l ve d . U n b e k n ow n s t
to the doctors at the time, h owe ve r , t h e
stakes concerned far more than a single
infant’s life.We now know there is a possi-
bility that the transplantation of animal
organs into humans might unleash infec-
tious diseases similar to Aids.
The scientific community is only begi n-
ning to understand the possible risks of
xe n o t r a n s p l a n t ation—the use of animal
organs and tissue in “ s p a r e - p a rt ” s u r g e ry
for humans. O ver the past century, t h e r e
have been about 25 documented cases of
such organ transplants, the most recent
case being reported in 1993. K i d n e y s ,
hearts and livers from baboons and mon-
keys were the organs of choice. S u rv i va l
r ates were dismal—most patients died
within we e k s. To d ay, h owe ve r , thanks to
progress in biotechnology and drug treat-
m e n t s , there is renewed interest in opening
another round of human experi m e n t s.
Scientists in the United States have already
begun implanting pig cells to treat pat i e n t s
with Pa r k i n s o n ’s disease and diabetes.
O t h e rs await the green light to begin trans-
planting organs from pigs into people.
This gr owing interest is matched by
rising fear, h owe ve r , t h at an animal viru s
could jump from the pig to the human
p at i e n t , spread to others and unleash a pan-
d e m i c. When viruses cross the species

barrier, the results can be catastrophic. At
least one strain of HIV is believed to have
jumped from monkeys to people after a
single infectious event 60 ye a rs ago. T h e
i n fluenza epidemic of 1918-19, w h i c h
killed tens of millions, may have been trig-
gered by a pig infecting one person.
X e n o t r a n s p l a n t ation thus confronts
the whole of society—not just individual
p atients—with the promise of sav i n g
thousands of lives and the possible risk of
causing tremendous harm . The lack of
scientific data transforms the safety issues
into an ethical dilemma which scientists
alone cannot answer.
Human transplantation has been a vic-
tim of its own success. Surgeons can now
transplant about 25 different kinds of
human organs and tissue, and surv i val rat e s
are constantly improving (60 per cent of
p atients live more than five ye a rs ) . M o r e
than one million people worldwide have
benefited since 1954,when the first trans-
plant was made. But supply cannot meet
d e m a n d . In the United Stat e s , for 
example, 3,900 people died while waiting
for an organ transplant in 1996,compared
to around 1,500 in 1988.
There are also strong economic argu-
ments in favour of xe n o t r a n s p l a n t at i o n .
About 700,000 patients suffering from kid-
ney disease world-wide are strapped to dia-
lysis machines at an annual cost of about
$19 billion, according to the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD). It costs about 60 per cent
less to transplant a kidney than to keep the
p atient on life-long dialysis. Success in
xe n o t r a n s p l a n t ation could open up an
international market worth $6 billion plus
another $5 billion in related drug treat-
ments (to prevent the immune system from
rejecting the organs). One of the biggest
c o n t e n d e rs is the pharmaceutical gi a n t
N ova rtis—which not only produced cy c l o-
sporin A, the leading drug used in human
transplants, but also owns Imutran,a UK-
based biotech company famous for geneti-
cally engi n e e ring pigs for xe n o-
transplantation.

focused on three strains of PERV, w h i c h
h ave been described as “second cousins”
to HIV or human immunodeficiency virus
which causes Aids.Two of them can infect
human cells.
We i s s ’s findings sent shockwave s
through public health organizations and the
industry. Researchers immediately set out
to survey as many patients as they could
find who had been exposed to porcine tis-
s u e . Out of about 175 patients screened,
none were infected by PERV.
“ I t ’s a relief,” s ays We i s s , but it’s not
c o n c l u s i ve . “This particular virus is not
going to be highly contagious but this
d o e s n ’t necessarily mean that xe n o t r a n s-
p l a n t ation is safe.”The patients in question
Pigs are the xeno-prize-winners. Non-
human primates, like baboons, have been
ruled out because their biological similari-
ties to human beings could increase the ri s k
of disease transmission, so brutally high-
lighted by the Aids and Ebola viru s e s.
M a ny people also have ethical qualms
about using our “cousins” for spare parts,
whereas we have been slaughtering and
e ating pigs for many centuri e s. F i n a l l y, p i g s
are easier to breed and genetically engi n e e r.
Duping the human 
immune system 
The human body would norm a l l y
consider a pig organ to be a dangerous
“foreign agent” and kill it within minutes
by cutting off its blood supply. I m u t r a n
and other laborat o ries are trying to get
past this defence (immune) system by
lining the pigs’ organs with human pro-
teins through genetic engi n e e ri n g .T h e s e
proteins endow the pig organ with a kind
of human disguise. After a time, h owe ve r ,
the human body would gradually realize
t h at the pig organ isn’t acceptable and
would launch an attack on it. Imutran is
n ow trying to develop new drugs and may
add more human genes to the pigs, s ay s
D r C o rinne Sav i l l , the company ’s chief
o p e r ating offic e r.
These “designer pigs” m ay, h owe ve r ,
make it easier for the animals’ g e rms to
infect people, says Dr Robin Weiss of Uni-
ve rsity College London. About two ye a rs
a g o, Weiss began publishing articles sho-
wing how pig viruses could hide behind the
human proteins (added to the pigs) and slip
past a pat i e n t ’s immune system. T h e
human proteins might also invite the
v i ruses into human cells. For example, o n e
of the human proteins used by Imutran and
other biotech companies is CD55. T h i s
protein makes the human body vulnerable
to several polio-related viru s e s. S u p p o s e ,
s ays We i s s , t h at pigs have similar viru s e s.
O r d i n a ri l y, they wo u l d n ’t affect humans
because of genetic differences. But imagi n e
that the pig viruses learn (through genetic
modification) to use CD55 and infect the
patient who receives the pig organ.Once a
pig disease has crossed over into a single
human being, it could mutate further and
spread to others.
None of these questions would matter if
the pigs could be issued with a “clean bill of
h e a l t h ” ,s ays We i s s. I m u t r a n , for example, i s
t rying to breed germ-free pigs in tightly
controlled fa c i l i t i e s. But even in a herm e t i-
cally sealed tank all the risks would not be
eliminated,particularly those arising from
v i ruses known as PERV retrov i ruses which
are found in the animal’s genes. Weiss has
r e c e i ved porcine tissue not organs, w h o s e
sheer volume may increase the risk of infec-
t i o n . S e c o n d , they were screened for the
three known retrov i ru s e s.W h at about unk-
n own germs? Weiss also wo n d e rs whether
the retrov i ruses might be hiding somewhere
in the body and become more powerful ove r
t i m e .
François Meslin of the World Health
O r g a n i z ation describes a wo rst-case scenari o :
a xe n o - p atient harbours an undetected viru s
which is passed to others by sexual inter-
c o u rs e , a likely means of transmission.As the
virus moves from one host to another, it
becomes increasingly dangerous.

risks down to an acceptable leve l ,” s ay s
M e s l i n , who points to the case of bov i n e
s p o n gi f o rm encephalopat hy—“mad cow
disease”—as the closest example of this
kind of dilemma. Since Weiss sounded the
alert, public health authorities around the
world have observed a de facto morat o ri u m
on human experiments with xe n o t r a n s-
p l a n t at i o n , which doctors describe as cli-
nical tri a l s.This doesn’t mean that they are
giving up on the research, h owe ve r.W h at is
happening is that most We s t e rn gove rn-
ments are setting up special advisory or
regulatory bodies to review any future cli-
nical trials and prepare strict guidelines for
monitoring them.
The U.S.and Britain, who are the lea-
ders in xeno-research,are currently finali-
zing guidelines to monitor not just the
p at i e n t s , but their fa m i l y - m e m b e rs and
h e a l t h - wo r k e rs.While the authorities refuse
to release the details, it has been said that
xe n o - p atients should refrain from hav i n g
c h i l d r e n ,m a rrying or even travelling inter-
nationally.This sounds like a replay of dis-
cussions concerning people infected with
HIV, says Prof Bartha Maria Knoppers, a
Canadian bioethicist regularly called on by
OECD to examine the ethics of xe n o -
r e s e a r c h . Close monitoring of pat i e n t s
should not mean trampling on their human
ri g h t s , K n o p p e rs believe s. “ B e s i d e s ,” s h e
s ay s , “are we really going to be able to
enforce these conditions?”Would it be pos-
s i b l e , for example, to take legal steps to pre-
vent a patient from deciding to have a child
two years after a clinical trial? 
Assessing the risk
of viral infections
The sponsors of these tri a l s — m o s t l y
biotech companies—will also come under
the microscope. O r d i n a ri l y, proposals to
test new medical procedures or treat m e n t s
on humans are considered commercial
secrets which are restricted to the company
i nvo l ved and the relevant gove rn m e n t a l
r e g u l at o ry body, e . g . the U. S . Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) which is res-
ponsible for approving tests on humans for
new medical drugs or procedures. This is
not so with xe n o t r a n s p l a n t at i o n , h owe ve r.
In the United Stat e s , a special advisory
committee composed of some 15 scientific
e x p e rts will openly review all requests to
test animal organs in people before the FDA
r e n d e rs a decision.
“Absence of evidence is not absence of
ri s k ,” s ays Phil Noguchi, director of the
FDA’s division of cellular and gene thera-
pies. For example, two years ago bio-tech
companies proudly insisted that their pigs
were germ - f r e e . But when news of the
P E RV retrov i ruses came out, Noguchi say s ,
the companies suddenly “ worked a lot har-
d e r ” to examine the ri s k s. Noguchi also
maintains that viral infections are difficult
to evaluate. “They may not happen often
enough to be a publishable event,” he says.
“But in a clinical experiment one tenth of a
sixth of a chance of infection is a whole lot.”
This is why the FDA is counting on help
from the advisory committee to look in all
the “nooks and crannies” where a viru s
might hide. “ We ’re still in a ve ry diffic u l t
position because to a large extent we rely on
i n d u s t ry to provide the proof that a clinical
e x p e riment is safe,” Noguchi notes. “ B u t
we also depend on our own scientists.”
For Noguchi, the advisory body also
scores extra points by offering a “ p u b l i c
f o ru m ” to discuss the ethical issues—from
animal we l fare concerns to deciding who
should receive an animal organ. F i rs t ,c o m-
panies might focus on patients with the
gr e atest chances of surviving instead of
those most in need of a transplant. S e c o n d ,
it will take ye a rs—if ever—before pig
organs are effective . For a patient on the
verge of death a pig organ could buy a few
extra weeks until a human organ becomes
ava i l a b l e . Should such patients receive
p ri o rity on the waiting list? There is a third
major concern , s ays John Davies of the
U. S . N ational Kidney Fo u n d at i o n , t h e
wo r l d ’s largest non-profit charity for kid-
ney pat i e n t s. “ We don’t want people to
stop donating the organs of their love d
ones [for human transplants] after the firs t
animal transplant tri a l s ,” s ays Dav i e s ,
“because they think the problem has been
r e s o l ve d .” While Davies supports xe n o -
r e s e a r c h , he is not convinced that it will
p r ove successful.
The problem is that these discussions
take place between people with ve s t e d
interests of one kind or another.They fail to
include the largest group affected, t h e
public.“It can be argued that there should
be some sort of ‘community consent’,” s ay s
Dr A . S . Daar of Oman, who chaired the
World Health Organization’s consultation
on xe n o t r a n s p l a n t at i o n . “Is the FDA man-
d ate to protect the public enough of a prox y
for community consent?” asks Daar. “ U n t i l
the public is informed about the issues and
is discussing them, I don’t think you wo u l d
want to go ahead with clinical trials.”
Daar is looking for ways of stimulat i n g
public debate and consent by working with
an intern ational committee of “ c o n c e rn e d ”
citizens—mostly scientists and bioethicists
brought together by the prestigious Has-
tings Center, a bioethics think-tank in New
Yo r k .The aim is to help countries to deve l o p
n ational but non-gove rnmental committees
of individuals from va rious walks of life—
e c o n o m i c s , l aw, r e l i gi o n , the media, e t c. —
who will take time to become inform e d
about xe n o t r a n s p l a n t ation but don’t them-
s e l ves have any vested interests in the mat-
t e r.These committees would hold “ c o n s e n-
sus conferences”—what A m e ricans call
“ t ownhall meetings”—to spread inform a-
tion about xe n o t r a n s p l a n t ation and gauge
the public’s response to it.
This idea is the brainchild of Fritz Bach,
a scientist at Harvard Medical School who
first called for a legal morat o rium on clini-
cal trials in the U. S . Bach is often port r aye d
as a virulent opponent of xe n o t r a n s p l a n t a-
tion and yet he is a leading scientist in the
field as well as a paid consultant for Nova r-
t i s. His corp o r ate sponsor isn’t thrilled by
his idea of townhall meetings. “ You cannot
go forward by publicly discussing such com-
p l i c ated subjects,” s ays Imutran/Nova rt i s ’s
Dr Sav i l l .“ N ow, whether gove rnments have
set up the right agencies is another ques-
t i o n . Like anything else in society, are the
right people in the right place making the
decisions? And does the public have confi-
dence in them?”
Bach isn’t convinced. “Some insiders
think this [moratorium and public consul-
t ation] would be a good thing for Nova rt i s ,”
he say s. “Just look at the tremendous 
hullabaloo over genetically modified orga-
n i s m s. If a blue ribbon committee—without
a ny connections to Monsanto—had
informed the public that they thought the
[GM] food was safe on the shelve s , we
wo u l d n ’t have had this reaction.The scari e s t
thing is always the unknown.” ■
The problem is that discussions
ta ke place between people
with vested interests of 
one kind or another. They fail
to include the largest group
affected, the public.
