From work camps
to virtual aid
Once closely tied in with community traditions, volunteering’s expansion has
been driven by an internationalist spirit. Today, it attracts a wide array of
enthusiasts, including those on the sidelines

S
orin Hurdubae, 3 8 , lives in Paris and works
several hours a week at Echanges-Solidarités-
Te r r i t o i r e s. Known by its French play-on-
words acronym EST (“East”), this NGO
focuses on cooperation with the countries in
transition of Eastern Europe—including Sorin’s native
R o m a n i a .
Sorin is but one of several part-time volunteers
of different nationalities without whom EST could
not survive, much less prosper. His desire to “lend a
helping hand” is echoed by millions of people around
the world, making volunteering a centrepiece of
today’s social landscape.
Historically, not “to lend a helping hand”would
have been an aberration.Virtually all pre-industrial
societies had more or less formal communal mutual
assistance institutions. Some survived well into the
20th century, others still exist, chiefly in the coun-
t r y s i d e. In Mali for example, a practice known as
t o n obligated youth to take part in community tasks
as part of their rite of passage into adolescence. In
Ecuador, the Quichua people continue to organize
mingas, whereby each household in a com-
munity donates labour for a specific local
p r o j e c t . In India, the notion of s h r a m d a n—
offering voluntary labour—continues to
mobilize people for rural projects, f r o m
road building to literacy training. More gen-
e r a l l y, almost all the world’s religions include
a dimension of social responsibility towards
those in need, a responsibility often intri-
cately linked to salvation or other forms of
spiritual advancement.
Friendship after war
In European societies however, g o o d
will lost some of its pre-eminence with the
industrial revolution, the rise of modern
states and the onslaught of money as the
main medium of exchange. At the same
t i m e, international movements began to
e m e r g e, notably the World Alliance of
Y M CA s, the first international youth NGO,
formed in the 1860s. In the U.S.,its volun-
teers proved instrumental in helping immi-
grant populations from Europe to settle.
After the devastation caused by World
War I,coming to the aid of the less fortunate found
renewed expression. Volunteering became a more
structured endeavour, often seen as a means of
building friendship among young people from dif-
ferent European countries. In 1920, the first inter-
national voluntary work camp was organized in
Esnes, a village near Verdun (France),an area rav-
aged by the horrible battle that took some one mil-
lion lives during the war. An initiative of the Inter-
national Fellowship of Reconciliation, the camp
helped rebuild farms and other physical infrastruc-
t u r e, a n d ,s i g n i fic a n t l y, included volunteers who had
been enemy soldiers in the Great War. It also led to
the launching of a still active and creative NGO,
Service Civil International (SCI—International Vo l-
untary Service).

sent the first recorded team of long-term volunteers
from what were not yet called “ i n d u s t r i a l i z e d ” t o
“ d e v e l o p i n g ” countries—Europe to India—in 1934.
M e a n w h i l e,as economic depression spread,s t a t e - r u n
work camp organizations often sprung up in countries
as far apart as the U.S. and Bulgaria to give the job-
less a chance to learn a skill by volunteering for con-
servation and physical infrastructure projects.
In the immediate aftermath of World War II,
national and international teams of volunteers once
again contributed much to rebuilding Europe. To
cite just one example, many of the stones and bricks
that create the charm of today’s Old Warsaw were
lovingly laid by volunteers from several countries.
But a new world was also in the making, in which
volunteering was to play its part.The United Nations
was born, with its commitment to promote peace,
social progress and understanding between peoples
—ideals close in spirit to much volunteering in the
inter-war years. In 1948, UNESCO took the lead in
involving itself with volunteering by convening the
First Conference of Organisers
of International Vo l u n t a r y
Wo r k c a m p s.The gathering cre-
ated the NGO now known as
the Coordinating Committee
for International Voluntary Ser-
v i c e, which helped to consoli-
date and expand volunteering
worldwide.
The emancipation from
colonial rule of many countries
in Africa and Asia led to the birth of a myriad of local
voluntary service organizations.From Togo to Ke n y a ,
from Nigeria to India, countries set up volunteeer
work camps chiefly devoted to such tasks as b u i l d i n g
s c h o o l s, d i s p e n s a r i e s, r o a d s, e t c.The emerging nations
of the Third World also began to host qualified long-
term volunteers from industrialized countries.Th e s e
schemes were mostly bilateral at the outset, but their
success led to the creation three decades ago of the
UN Volunteer Programme. UNV is now a multi-
lateral effort with a high proportion of South-South
v o l u n t e e r i n g. Soon after it gained independence
from Portugal in the late 1970s, for example, G u i n e a -
Bissau hosted a number of Latin American UNV
teachers.
Rusting the Iron Curtain
Some observers are quick to note that volun-
teering can be kidnapped or abused to serve political
agendas—the Hitlerjugend Arbeitsdienst labour
brigades in Germany and similar schemes in other
totalitarian countries provide some unfortunate
illustrations. There have been many other instances,
however, when the opposite has been the case. The
East-West work camps set up during the Cold War
are perhaps the most telling example. These camps
(organized by NGOs in the West and party-approved
“social organizations” in the East) aimed to promote
c o n t a c t , concrete cooperation and mutual understanding
between youth from both sides, with Third World vol-
unteers often present as neutral leavening. Even though
small in scale, these initial efforts to rust the Iron Curtain
did not,to put it mildly, please all authorities of the con-
flicting superpowers and their allies, hence their lasting
symbolic importance.
Help online
With the advance of globalization, volunteering is
entering another age.While work camps set up for spe-
c i fic conservation or physical infrastructure projects still
mobilize people, social volunteering (e.g. philanthropic
assistance to the homeless) and its cousins, h u m a n i-
tarian volunteering (for example to assist refugees) and
a d v o c a cy volunteering (for such causes as human rights
and fair trade) have come into the spotlight.
A growing trend is that, within and between soci-
e t i e s, volunteering is empowering the excluded: d i s a b l e d
p e o p l e, i m m i g r a n t s, and more generally, those on the
margins of society are helping their
own.In some instances, it is paving
the path to recreating a sense of cit-
i z e n s h i p : in the U. S.state of Georgia,
for example, some 2,000 prison
inmates willingly served as volun-
teer firemen during the year 2000,
following training. Online volun-
t e e r i n g, sometimes criticized as
dehumanizing, offers the potential
to involve people who might other-
wise be considered unfit to help others.And many recent
initiatives show that there is almost no age limit to
becoming a volunteer: in Israel, 10 to 13 y e a r-old students
are training retired people in computer literacy, while
retiree volunteering is also an encouraging trend. The
Association of Senior European Counsellors reports,
for instance, a network of 15 member bodies in 11 Euro-
pean Union countries, totalling over 9,000 volunteer
consultants.
Such retiree volunteering is a personal concern. I
ended my UN E S C O career in April 1998.S i n c e, I ’ve under-
taken a number of volunteer assignments for the UNV
and various NGOs, notably in A z e r b a i j a n , H u n g a r y,
Palestine and Romania. With due modesty, I hope I
have contributed to a variety of projects there, f r o m
r e cycling of household trash in Greater Budapest to
job creation for the young unemployed in Brasov. All
have brought me invigorating experiences, unexpected
l e a r n i n g, even delight.Although unpaid, volunteering can
offer unique non-material remuneration. That is one
reason why I expect that, when he retires in about
another quarter century, Sorin Hurdubae will continue
to “lend a helping hand.” ■
