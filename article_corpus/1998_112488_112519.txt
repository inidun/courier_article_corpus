Sea tribunal
m a kes a slow start
Marine pollution has been punishable by a fine imposed by an international court since
the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea was set up under United Nations aus-
pices in October 1996. The tribunal is also in charge of settling disputes over the demar-
cation of territorial waters, fishing areas and navigation zones. Its decisions are binding
on the 125 countries that have ratified the International Convention on the Law of the
Sea.
The court is made up of 21 elected members, including five from the group of African
states, five from the Asian group, four from Latin America and the Caribbean,three from
eastern Europe and four from the Western world and countries not associated with any
group, based on the geographical classification used in the United Nations. Judges, diplo-
mats, researchers and professors, the members are all experts in maritime disputes.
After election,lots are drawn to determine which judges will serve terms of three, six
or nine years.The Tribunal’s statutes also provide for a rotation system leaving seven seats
empty so that a partial election may be held every three years. Even after their terms of
office have ended, the judges finish work on cases they have begun.
So far, the only case that has come before the Tribunal, which sits in Hamburg,
Germany, is a dispute between Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Republic of
Guinea. In November 1997 the Caribbean island nation went to the court to ask for the
restitution of a freighter Guinea had confiscated for smuggling inside its territorial waters.
