The threat of fresh water scarcity is a major ri s k . On the one hand, resources are not
u n l i m i t e d ; they are finite and fragi l e .On the other, total world demand for water has ri s e n
s e venfold in the course of this century, while world population has increased threefold
over the same peri o d . Increased demand goes hand in hand with rising living standards
resulting from socio-economic deve l o p m e n t . This is bad news insofar as demand will
continue to escalate as living standards hopefully improve .But it is good news insofar as this
l e vel of development increases our capacity to make more economical use of wat e r.
This collective resource is becoming rarer because it is being overexploited by a
c o n s u m e rist and pollution-generating humanity. The wa rning signs are clear: fa l l i n g
water tables, s h rinking ri ve rs and lakes, widespread pollution, creeping desert i fic at i o n .Wat e r
s h o rtage is exacting a gr owing human toll in terms of malnutri t i o n ,d i s e a s e ,a b a n d o n m e n t
of rural areas, and swollen urban settlements. Prophets of doom predict that water,even
more than oil or land, may soon foment bitter conflicts.
But if the outlook is gloomy, crisis is not yet inevitable,on condition that we do three
t h i n g s : put technology back in its place; recognize both the possibilities and the limitat i o n s
of the market; and above all give priority to a new “water ethic”.
Technology can only provide part of the answer. The water crisis is not an isolated
p h e n o m e n o n . It is an important but specific aspect of the general crisis of a deve l o p m e n t
model based on a concept of gr owth which is obsessed with macro-economics and
technology and neglects social, human and environmental fa c t o rs. We should firm l y
oppose so-called miracle solutions. In any case, where in today ’s economic climate are we
going to find the means to build dams, pipe systems, channels and reservo i rs , or to
finance the “ e c o j o b s ” needed for scientific management of agriculture and the env i r o n m e n t ?
There is also growing pressure to recognize that water should become a commodity
like any other. In this pers p e c t i ve the market could be used to regulate water demand, b o t h
to reduce overall consumption and to arbitrate between users , within countries and
internationally. This approach certainly has a role to play in enhancing the value of an
increasingly precious resource and thereby reducing wa s t e . But if market mechanisms we r e
to rule unchecked, what would happen to the role of the public authorities? How could
they exercise their responsibility for social justice, especially towards all those who still have
no access to drinking water?
Technology and the market can be precious allies in getting to grips with the looming
water cri s i s , but ultimately the response to it must rest on ethical and cultural foundat i o n s.
There should be three imperat i ve s :d a ri n g, c a ring and shari n g .D a ri n g, because postponing
urgent decisions on the grounds that all the data are not available would be tantamount
to letting demand gr ow until it reaches its natural and economic limit. C a ri n g,because ove r
a billion people still have no access to drinking wat e r. S h a ring because the only altern at i ve
to wo rsening conflict rests on determ i n ation to show a sense of equity and community.T h i s
is not a utopian ideal: in human history, water has been a greater force for unity than for
division. n

This collective resource is
becoming rarer because it is
being overexploited by a
consumerist and pollution-
generating humanity. The
warning signs are clear:
falling water tables,
shrinking rivers and lakes,
widespread pollution,
creeping desertification.
