At La Niña school, the teacher doesn’t
stand in front of the class dishing out
k n ow l e d g e . Instead he sits amid a
group of pupils having a discussion with
t h e m .The children, of different ages, wo r k
not at individual desks but around hexa-
gonal tables.The teacher doesn’t deliver a
lecture or give orders. Each child goes and
fetches a self-instructional guide and then
settles down to study.The teacher doesn’t
demand silence in class, because the school
not only allows but strongly encourages
discussion and group-work.
La Niña, in Colombia’s coffee-gr ow i n g
Andean province of Caldas, is a rural school
run according to the principles of the New
School (Escuela Nueva) move m e n t ,w h i c h
was devised by Colombian education expert s
who have managed to turn the disadva n t a g e s
of rural schools—lack of equipment, o n e -
room establishments and one or at most two
t e a c h e rs for children of different ages and
abilities—into assets, p r oviding a positive
e x p e rience which instils self-reliance,
responsibility and teamwo r k .
“The thing you notice most when you
visit a ‘new school’ is how hard the pupils are
concentrating,” says Ernesto Schiefelbein,
a former Chilean education minister and
n ow rector of Santiago de Chile’s Santo
Tomás Unive rs i t y, who visited the first “ n e w
s c h o o l ” in Colombia in 1985. “ S o m e t i m e s
when the bell rings for play t i m e ,m a ny chil-
dren are so absorbed they just continue
wo r k i n g . So learning comes easily.You also
notice that they’re always asking questions,
which is a ve ry good way to judge how
effectively they’re learning.”
Self-instruction
The wat c h word of the “new school”
method is self-instruction based on spe-
c i a l l y - w ritten guides (g u i a s) cove ring mat h s ,
natural and social sciences and languages.
These guides are something more than text-
b o o k s ; they suggest activities and exe r c i s e s
t h at can be done both in and out of school,
along with detailed instructions that enable
the child to go at his or her own speed.
So pupils make progress according to
their ability and the time they have ava i-
l a b l e , focusing on the subjects that interest
them most or which they find most diffi-
c u l t . At harvest time, they are allowed to
go off and help their fa m i l i e s , a f t e r wa r d s
resuming their lessons where they left off.
This has helped to reduce the amount of
special coaching needed and also dropout
n u m b e rs , which are considerable in
C o l o m b i a ’s small rural communities,
where between half and three-quart e rs of
all children do not go to school or else
drop out after a couple of ye a rs.
The guides have been criticized for being
too structured and for curbing teachers ’
c r e at i v i t y, but they are ve ry useful, i n e x p e n-
s i ve teaching mat e rials that can enable a
single teacher to run a one-class school.
They gi ve the teacher time to both help the
youngest children to read and attend to those
who have problems learn i n g .
The critics also forget that teachers in
developing countries are usually not very
well trained.In Latin America,says Schie-
felbein, there is “the myth of the dynamic
teacher who can work wonders with kids”
when the evidence is that “after six ye a rs of
p ri m a ry school, half the continent’s children
c a n ’t understand a simple article on the
front page of a newspaper.”The big adva n-
tage of the guides is that they can be easily
f o l l owed by poorly-trained teachers and
also give pupils a lot of independence.
Teacher training is a key element of the
system. Teachers have to learn to use new
educational tools which encourage both the
pupils and the community to get involved.
They also have to drop the teacher’s tradi-
tional authoritarian role as a transmitter of
knowledge. Each year teachers attend three
o n e - week wo r k s h o p s , and visit a demons-
t r ation school to “ l e a rn by doing” and see the
a d vantages of the new method with their
own eyes.
As well as using guides, the teacher and
pupils organize “learning areas”where they
collect inform ation and objects related to
c l a s swork and other aspects of daily life. Fo r
e x a m p l e , a natural science topic may invo l ve
having an area with sand where local plants
and insects are kept.
Another novelty of the New School move-
ment is the “school council”, p r oviding prac-
tical introduction to civic and democrat i c
life.It is made up of committees which look
after the school garden, health matters, the
l i b r a ry, discipline and sport s , and encou-
rages co-operation and leadership based on
the interests and daily lives of the children.
The La Niña school has a farming com-
mittee which organizes crop gr owing and
animal breeding. “What we want is to feel

way,” s ays 13-year-old committee chairm a n
David Cabal.
Other principles of the New School
m ovement are that teaching must be
adapted to local conditions and lifestyles.
Parents and other members of the com-
munity regularly take part in school activi-
ties, improving buildings and equipment,
d o n ating teaching mat e rials and helping
teachers during lessons. In addition, they
encourage the children to be interested in
their own history and traditions.The guides
suggest collecting prove r b s , my t h s ,l e g e n d s
and accounts of how people used to live .I n
this way, the school becomes a living source
of knowledge about the community.
“The New School movement is perhaps
the most successful educational reform that
I ’ ve seen in more than 30 ye a rs ’e x p e ri e n c e
in almost 20 countri e s ,” wrote Richard J.
K r a f t , of the Unive rsity of Colorado, in a
1997 report for the World Bank and the U. S .
A g e n cy for Intern ational Deve l o p m e n t
( U S A I D ) . “The boosting of teachers ’s k i l l s
has brought radical changes in the
c u rri c u l u m , in community deve l o p m e n t ,i n
d e m o c r atic behaviour and in improve d
s c h o o l i n g .”
In 1989, the World Bank singled out
the Escuela Nueva movement as one of the
three pri m a ry school experiments in the
world which had succeeded in making edu-
c ational innovat i o n s , and recommended
t h at “the lessons of this experience be widely
d i s s e m i n ated among policy - m a k e rs in deve-
loping countri e s.” Since then, the model
has been successfully used in Guatemala,
where it has been adopted in its entirety (see
box page 16). Other countries, including
Chile, Argentina and recently Nicaragua,
have borrowed parts of it.
The Philippines is the first country out-
side Latin A m e rica to use the model to
improve teaching at all levels in its multi-
grade rural schools, which have a poor repu-
t at i o n . The Multigrade Demonstrat i o n
Schools Project (MGDSP) has set up 24
schools in 12 provinces. It all began with a
visit by Filipino officials to “new schools” i n
Colombia in 1993. Persy So, a UNICEF
staffer in Manila, recalls that the visitors
were impressed by the pupils, who we r e
self-reliant and responsible, and freely
expressed their thoughts and opinions
without fear of their elders.
The children in the Filipino country s i d e
who have been part of the programme have
gained self-confidence and show gr e at e r
interest in their lessons. Some parents now
prefer their children to attend these schools
r ather than traditional schools where there
is one teacher for each age group.“It’s like
being in a pri vate school,” s ays 13-ye a r - o l d
Adonis Corasay, who likes the fact that the

be able to complete his pri m a ry schooling
there.
In Colombia, the New School move-
ment has survived difficulties at local and
n ational leve l .A study produced in 1998 by

in rural schools got better marks than city
children in language and maths,in spite of

blems of ill-educated parents, g e o gr a p h i c a l
distance and isolation.
Teacher training
Rural schools in Chile and Argentina,
which were also surve yed and have adopted
some of the ideas of the “new schools”, d i d
not show such good results as the Colom-
bian ones. Schiefelbein thinks this is because
they have n ’t systematically adopted the new
p r o gr a m m e .“Chile has only taken on board
a few suggestions made on five pages of a
m a n u a l , and Argentina is still trying out
the programme in just a handful of schools,”
he says.
The programme in Colombia has its
c ri t i c s , h owe ve r. Noel F. M c G i n n , P r o-
fessor of Education at Harvard Unive rs i t y,
notes that in its early stages, the Escuela
N u e va programme “ was closely monitored
and nurtured by persons who were highly
committed and highly talented”. But as
the programme expanded, it “became the
responsibility of people who had only
r e c e i ved brief training [and] may not have
been fully convinced about the concept.”
Some teachers may have needed trai-
n i n g, while others , e ven though they
grasp the new methods, are not willing to
include them in their daily teaching acti-
vity. An Ecuadorian teacher, Rosa M.
Torres, observed during a visit to several
“new schools” in Colombia in 1992 that

many teachers were still attached to old
ways. “The ideal of progressive education
coexists with conservative and outdated
practices,” she said.
It is hard to say how many genuine “ n e w
s c h o o l s ” there are in Colombia. Twenty ye a rs
after they first appeared, m a ny of them are
“ n e w ” only in name. The “ Vo l vamos a la
G e n t e ” Fo u n d at i o n , in Bogota, reckons there
are about 12,500 schools operating accor-
ding to the ori ginal pri n c i p l e s.The number of
t e a c h e rs who have had some training and
still apply what they learned is thought to be
around 10,000, a big jump when you think
there were only 150 at the end of the 1960s
and just 500 in 1975.
The programme survives, despite the
ups and downs of Colombian government
funding, because of the tactics of the New
School move m e n t ’s organizers. O ver the
last couple of decades, e ve ry new educat i o n
minister has been taken to see a “ n e w ”
rural school and a traditional one.Official
support for the new model has usually fol-
l owed (even though it costs 10 per cent
more than the traditional one) because it has
the clear merits of improving the quality of
teaching and reducing the numbers of tea-
chers needed.
But to introduce a new way of educat i n g
c h i l d r e n , “which aims not to mirror society
but to change it,” according to Schiefelbein,
means top officials and individual teachers all
h ave to be persuaded of its va l u e .This is an
e n o rmous task, but a ve ry vital one. n
In rural regions of the Philippines, 24 pilot
m u l t i g rade schools have started putting Escuela
Nueva methods into pra c t i c e. In some cases, t h e
schools were built by the communities themselves.
