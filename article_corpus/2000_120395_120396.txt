A l varo Restrepo, a Colombian dancer
and choreogr a p h e r , could have pur-
sued his career anywhere in the
world—in New Yo r k , where he was trained,
or in Europe, where he first made his mark.
But in 1993, he decided to sacri fice all this to
introduce modern dance to Colombia—
where the discipline was barely know n — a n d
to teach it to disadvantaged children bet-
ween 10 and 15 ye a rs old. He teamed up
with Marie-France Delieuvin, p r o gr a m m e
director at the National Centre for Modern
Dance in A n g e rs , F r a n c e , and their joint
e n d e avour has produced astonishing results.
In 1997, four ye a rs after sowing the
seeds of the new art form in Bogotá and

centre featured on UNESCO’s World Heri-
tage List, but it cannot hide a darker side:
t wo-thirds of its 700,000 inhabitants live
below the poverty line.
Restrepo and Delieuvin’s bridge is two -
way. It has led a pair of dedicated perfor-
mers to the outskirts of one of Cartagena’s
most wretched slums, while also linking the
project to professionals in Europe and
L atin A m e rica through festivals and
exchanges.

Cartagena. He eventually ended up with a
smaller group of 90 young dancers stri v i n g
to hone their skills in a discipline that tou-
ched the ve ry roots of their cultural and
p e rsonal identity. After a few months,
through a kind of natural selection that left
only those determined to take part in a
c r e at i ve project, 22 of the children quali-
fied for membership in the Experi m e n t a l
Troupe of the Academy of the Body.They
were crossing the bri d g e , t r avelling from
one side of the river to the other.
From outcasts
to performers
D ri ven on by their pove rty sticken
b a c k gr o u n d s , the chosen boys and gi r l s —
n ow more mat u r e ,with deeper voices and
changed bodies—are often tempted to
shirk off school to rehearse their new
dance projects eve ry d ay in the beautiful
colonial-era cloisters of the 16th-century
San Francisco conve n t , leant especially to
the troupe by a religious foundat i o n . I t s
w i d e , empty court yard is flanked by the
Centennial Park and the city’s modern
c o nvention centre, while the old neigh-
bourhood of Getsemaní lies just behind.
Without the free classes at the A c a d e my,
these children—most of whom come from
the city’s Nelson Mandela neighbourhood,
home to families forcibly displaced by
C o l o m b i a ’s civil wa r — would continue
living like outcasts, scraping through life.
But in the three short years the Academy
has been around,they have become teena-
g e rs and gr own from average pupils in out-
lying schools to performers of an art form,
m o d e rn dance, which once seemed remote
and inaccessible. The children have also
come to understand that they could lead
c r e at i ve live s , e ver since Restrepo, w i t h
unshakeable faith and endurance, arrived
in their midst and began mounting shows
with them that have started to attract public
acclaim.

Besides training its members , the El
Puente troupe has also attained high
professional standards, while some for-
mer members have become dance tea-
c h e rs in their own ri g h t . The nat u r a l ,
almost inborn Caribbean sense of rhy t h m
has produced dancers imbued with a pos-
sibly more abstract and certainly more
symbolic way of expression, yet one which
u l t i m ately springs from the gr e at tradi-
tions of modern dance.
Tours
and troubles
With meagres resources and a make-
shift organization patched up by the
u n fla g ging enthusiasm of teachers and stu-
dents alike, the A c a d e my of the Body has
staged two arts festivals in Cart a g e n a , i n
1998 and 1999, and presented three of its
own show s.The troupe has also at t e n d e d
f e s t i vals in Colombia and Europe.
After their performances abroad, i n-
cluding one that took them to Pa ris in
A p ril 2000 and gave them a chance to
m a rvel at wealth they could not dream of,
the children returned to the pove rty of
their tiny homes to grapple once more
with life in the slums. But this time they
came back with the confidence of
h av i n g s t a rted to do something special in
t h e i r l i ve s.
It hasn’t all been a bed of roses. D e s p i t e
the support of public bodies and pri vat e
firm s , money problems still loom over the
A c a d e my. But the iron will of Restrepo
and Delieuvin is rooted in a dream, o n e
t h at often ove rrides the reality that sha-
ped it. The dream lives on because tea-
c h e rs and students in Cartagena seem to
u n d e rstand that the rewards of pers i s t e n c e
are mightier than the pull of despair. ■
