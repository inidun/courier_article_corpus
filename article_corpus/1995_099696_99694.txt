UNITED NATIONS YEAR FOR TOLERANCE
Lieh-tzu
The world turned upside down
Mr P'ang of Ch'in had a son who was clever as a child but suffered
from an abnormality when he grew up. When he heard singing he
thought it was weeping, when he saw white he thought it was black;
fragrant smells he thought noisome, sweet tastes he thought bitter,
wrong actions he thought right. Whatever came into his mind,
heaven and earth, the four cardinal points, water and fire, heat and
cold, he always turned upside down. A certain Mr Yang told his
father:
"The gentlemen of Lu* have many arts and skills, perhaps they
can cure him. Why not inquire among them?"
The father set out for Lu, but passing through Ch'en he came
across Lao-tzu, and took the opportunity to tell him about his son's
symptoms.
"How do you know that your son is abnormal?" said Lao-tzu.
"Nowadays everyone in the world is deluded about right and
wrong, and confused about benefit and harm; because so many
people share this sickness, no one perceives that it is a sickness.
Besides, one man's abnormality is not enough to overturn his
family, one family's to overturn the state, one state's to overturn the
world. If the whole world were abnormal, how could abnormality
overturn it? Supposing the minds of everyone in the world were like
your son's, then on the contrary it is you who would be abnormal.
Joy and sorrow, music and beauty, smells and tastes, right and
wrong, who can straighten them out? I am not even sure that these
words of mine are not abnormal, let alone those of the gentlemen
of Lu, who are the most abnormal of all; who are they to cure other
people's abnormality? You had better go straight home instead of
wasting your money."
