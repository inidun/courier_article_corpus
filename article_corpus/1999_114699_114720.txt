Of all the at t r a c t i o n s , possibilities and
u n c e rtainties of the Intern e t , one of
those raising the most speculat i o n
centres on its impact on the production,
d i s t ri bution and consumption of inform at i o n
and news. In a recent report on the future of
the printed press in a digital wo r l d , D u t c h
media analyst Monique van Dusseldorp notes
t h at “ N e w s p a p e rs as carri e rs of content have
had to yield va rious functions in the past
c e n t u ry to radio and television serv i c e s ,a n d
n ow there are other cat e g o ries of inform at i o n
t h at might migr at e , this time to the net. . . .
Unexpected competitors such as search
e n gines and free homepage serv i c e s , as well as
the online services of television stat i o n s ,n ow
fight in the same arena for the user’s at t e n t i o n
and the limited adve rtising money ava i l a b l e .”
The fact is that the media cannot ignore
the fast and furious pace with which use of
the Internet is gr ow i n g . At a conference on
the electronic press held in Lyo n ,F r a n c e ,i n
October 1998, Randy Bennet, of the
Newspaper A s s o c i ation of A m e rica (NAA),
said that “The Internet market is expected
to increase from around 150 million users
worldwide today to almost 300 million by
the year 2001.” Surveys conducted by the
A m e rican company Fo rrester Research
forecast that worldwide online expenditure
on adve rtising will rise from almost $2
billion today to about $15 billion in 2003.
“The numbers tell us that the Internet will
continue to develop as a mass medium,
t h at adve rt i s e rs will increasingly shift dollars
to this medium and that traditional media
will have to figure out their role in this new
s p a c e ,” Bennet said. Miguel A n g e l
B a s t a n i e r , director of intern ational relat i o n s
with the Spanish daily El País, pointed out
t h at “ e ve ry newspaper will have to be on the
Internet as a service to its public and as a
means of self-promotion. It cannot run the
risk of seeing its readers obtain this serv i c e
from its competitors.”
In fa c t , the written press has turned to the
I n t e rnet in order to stay competitive with the
other online media. A m e rican Jo u rn a l i s m
magazine stated recently that there are 3,622
d i gital newspapers wo r l d w i d e . A year ago,
there were only some 900 outside the United
S t at e s , as against 1,563 in 1998, largely as a
result of the increasing number in Canada, t h e
United Kingdom, N o r way, Brazil and
G e rm a ny. Ye t , in spite of all the effort and
i nve s t m e n t , not a single online newspaper
can be considered profit a b l e .
The Wall Street Journal:
an eloquent exception
One of the main dilemmas editors are
t rying to resolve lies in switching from
n e w s p rint to the computer screen and in
making money without replacing the ori gi n a l
m e d i u m , in other words without readers
giving up the traditional form at and changi n g
over permanently to the electronic ve rs i o n .
“The important thing is not so much
going on the Internet as staying on it
without losing money on the pri n t e d
version,” says André Jaunin, founder and
manager of Edicom, the Internet site of
the Swiss group Edipresse, which publishes
a number of newspapers and magazines
including Le Mat i n, Tri bune de Genève, B i l a n
and Optima. “The idea is not to display all
the contents of the printed ve rs i o n ,” h e
says. “We consider that it is absurd to offer
the newspaper we are selling on the streets
free of charge on the Web. Our electronic
p u b l i c ation is different from the pri n t e d
ve rs i o n .The news items it contains are bri e f
and are updated eve ry ten minutes.They are
designed to be expanded in the following
d ay ’s printed edition.” H owe ve r , h a r d
i n f o rm ation is not enough. The new
t e c h n o l o gies have to be used to keep
I n t e rnet readers interested. Some of the
approaches which the electronic press can
offer to please the public and advertisers
include personalized services, free e-mail,
i n t e r a c t i ve articles and opportunities to
swap ideas via chat forums.
In Bennet’s view, “the key to success
with any new medium is a commonsense
approach to serving the needs of consumers
and advertisers, aided by technology, but
not driven by it.”
Simon Wa l d m a n , the Internet editor of the
English daily newspaper The Guardian,
d e s c ribed his efforts to create new products
of interest to its readers.“ We have designed a
space on our  Web page which presents cri c k e t
m atches in real time, for example,” he said,
“and this has been extremely successful.” E l
País Digi t a l, the leading light of the Spanish
electronic press with 50,000 hits a day in
October 1998, had a similar success with its
direct transmission of chess mat c h e s ,w h i c h
are particularly popular with Spaniards.
In terms of profit a b i l i t y, although there is
no unive rsal model or magic form u l a , t h e
n e w s p a p e rs which have gone onto the Net try
to surv i ve pri m a rily through subscri p t i o n s ,



More and more newspapers and periodicals 
are going online. How is electronic technology affecting the production 
and consumption of the printed word?
Can papers
n e t a profit ?

financial pressure to succeed in this hard-
fought market may, out of the desire to be
firs t , fall into the temptation of transmitting
unchecked inform at i o n , neglecting the
a c c u r a cy they have traditionally attached to
information-gathering.
The virtually limitless amassing of
i n f o rm ation from a wide range of sources on
the Internet may also gi ve rise to a welter of
c o n f u s i o n . This makes the traditional
n e w s p a p e rs ’ task of rigorous selection and
objectivity even more va l u a b l e .Randy Bennet
b e l i e ves that consumer behaviour may change
as new choices and capabilities emerge, bu t
t h at the need to ensure that inform ation is
a c c u r at e , to gi ve an ove rview of events and to
p r ovide ready access will remain unaffected.
It is for this reason that newspapers will focus
on the individual and translate online the
t rust they have acquired over the ye a rs.
Will newsprint sink in the digital sea?
Some of the predictions made are out of
touch with reality. Bastenier forecasts that
most newspapers will eventually disappear
and that “the only surv i vo rs will be
heavyweights with a sense of perspective,
such as Le Monde or El País, or very small
provincial papers which are close to their
r e a d e rship and largely provide inform at i o n
about and for a particular community.
H owe ve r , I would not let the computer
screen be a substitute for the pleasure I get
from reading news on paper, where I can go
through the pages as I please, leaving part
of the paper for later on.”Although the last
word has not yet been written on the
s u b j e c t , it is quite clear that nothing will eve r
be the same in the world of inform at i o n
since the coming of the Internet. ■

a d ve rtising and electronic trading.H owe ve r ,
most of them agree that surfers , who are
nomadic by nature and are constantly
s e a r c h i n g, are not prepared to pay a prov i d e r
to obtain their inform at i o n , unless it is vital
and can only be found on the Intern e t ,w h i c h
is seldom the case. Perhaps one of the most
eloquent exceptions is the authori t at i ve
financial newspaper T h e Wall Street Jo u rn a l,
which has more than 250,000 subscri b e rs ,
t wo-thirds of whom pay to receive only the
d i gital ve rsion of the publication which
n e ve rtheless does not turn a profit . A large
number of the electronic newspapers and
news bulletins in the United States which
had adopted the subscription method know
all about this.They are backtracking and are
t rying to attract as many visitors as possible in
order to sell adve rtising space.The free digi t a l
ve rsion of El Pa í s obtains its income basically
from adve rt i s i n g, from which it hopes to
make some $700,000 in 1998.M a riló Ruiz de
E l v i r a , who is in charge of the electronic
e d i t i o n , explains that plans are being made for
new strat e gies involving electronic trading,
c o n s u l t ation of archives and other paid
products and serv i c e s.André Jaunin points out
t h at , in addition to adve rt i s i n g, the main
sources of income from Edipresse’s Intern e t
site are electronic sales of travel bookings,
w i n e , books and music.
Although the Internet clearly offers
n e w s p a p e rs the opportunity to achieve
i m m e d i ate global reach and to compete
with a wide range of sources, it also obliges
them to keep on updating their content,
thus leaving very little time for checking.
This poses another dilemma: should they be
the first or the most reliable purve yor of the
news? Digital newspapers exposed to
