Alio! Hallo!... Communicati
The drawings on these pages, made especially for The Unesco
Courier by Ion Popesco-Gopo, a leading Rumanian artist-
producer of animated cartoons, offer readers a brief preview of
Gopo's humorous little film, "Allol-Hallo! : Communications in a
Nutshell." "Allol-Hallo!" is a history in miniature of man learning
to communicate with man. Homo sapiens, the little character
shown in these drawings, progresses sometimes by accident,
but always by using his brain from smoke signals, graffiti and
hieroglyphics to telephones, radio and international TV by satellite
relay. Gopo ends his story with a forward-looking peep at the
interplanetary communication of tomorrow. "Allol-Hallo!" was
made for Unesco by Bucarest Studios and was produced in col¬
laboration with the Rumanian National Commission for Unesco.

ION POPESCO-GOPO.seen
here at work on "Allol-
Hallol" in the film studios
at Buftea, near Bucarest,
is a former newspaper car¬
toonist who found his real
vocation in animated car¬
toons. Since 1950 his
films have won numerous
Festival awards (Edinburgh,
Cannes, Tours, Karlovy-
Vary, San Francisco). Last
year he decided to try his
hand at a feature-length
cartoon and took as his
theme the need to use
atomic energy exclusively
for peaceful purposes. He
is now working on another
full-length cartoon, enti¬
tled "Steps on the Moon."
