' Geysir ' : the grandfather
of all geysers
_*N the northern edge of
Vatnajökull there is "a huge mountain
area, Kverkfjöll, cut across by a great
chasm with a narrow outlet glacier
which separates it into eastern and
western parts. Kverkfjöll has 1,800
metre high mountain ridges, and its
tallest peak rises to 1,920 metres.
The Kverkfjöll group of mountains
is volcanic and doubtless the western
Kverkfjöll is still an active volcano.
Here is one of the largest thermal
areas in Iceland with big steam and
hot water springs and boiling mud
pots, mainly in or close to a cleft
valley called the Hveradalur.
This hot spring valley is in itself
one of the most remarkable natural
phenomena in Iceland. It is com¬
pletely covered with hot springs of
different types and sizes, steam
springs and mud pots, and the slopes
on both sides are also boiling to some
extent.
At the south-west end of the valley
there is a glacier-dammed lake some¬
times covered by ice, but also some¬
times studded with icebergs that have
broken off the glacier above. There
seem to be hot water outlets at the
bottom of the lake, but hot water also
runs from the springs on the slopes.
The hot springs even extend south¬
wards and eastwards underneath the
glacier ice where high columns of
steam ascend through melted holes
in the firn (granular ice).
To the east of the lake, there are
tuff (porous volcanic stone) hills with
countless boiling springs, while at the

north-east end of the lake there are
some blue boiling mud pots, sulphu¬
rous hot springs, most of them seeth¬
ing with a mass of bubbles. From
the end of the lake the valley slopes
gently up towards a thin ridge across
the valley, almost closing it, with small
peaks on both sides.
North-east of this ridge the valley
is completely different in character,
now getting V-shaped and much deep¬
er like a cleft, but opening out further
north. The west side of the valley is
very steep here, and the colours are
extremely rich and varied, even for
colourful Iceland. The hot springs
are close to each other, covering the
whole slope down to the bottom of
the valley. The whole area, thick-set
with steam jets, seems to be on the
boil.
Few places in Iceland convey the
feeling of contrast between ice and
fire as powerfully as this area,
although several others have frost
and fire locked in constant combat,
and the colours here are beyond
description.
There are not many places more
remote than Kverkfjöll. From the
north one has to travel a long way
over lava, sandur-plains and glacial
rivers, and from the south the biggest
ice cap in the country has to be
crossed to reach it. But that is the
easiest way if one travels by snow¬
mobile.
Most famous of the Icelandic spout¬
ing hot springs is Geysir (in Hauka-
dalur), which has given its name to
all similar hot springs in the world.
Geysir spouts very seldom now, but
nearby there are several boiling hot
water springs, some of which erupt
regularly such as the one called
Strokkur.
The bowl of Geysir is 18 m. wide
and 1.3 m. deep, and it is situated
in the top of a low mound, built up
of layers of siliceous deposits from
the spring water. From the bottom
of the bowl there is a vertical tube
which is about 20 m. deep and 3 m.
wide at the top, but it narrows as it
goes down. It is believed that Geysir
and Strokkur were both formed in a
great earthquake in 1294.
We are told in the Oddaverja Annual
that "...at Haukadalur two big hot
water springs came into existence,
whereas others which had been there
before disappeared." Research based
on the time needed to build up the
siliceous sinter mound, and dated vol¬
canic ash layers in the soil below it
supports this dating.
After 1800 Geysir is often mention¬
ed in foreign books on travel in Ice¬
land, but around 1900 Geysir eruptions
decreased in number, and in 1916
they stopped completely. In 1935 the
eruptions started again after the

POMPEI OF THE NORTH.
The cemetery of the town
of Heimaey as it looked a
short time afterthe volcanic
eruption hit it in January
1973. About 250 million
cubic metres of lava and
ash were ejected on the
island. Two months after
it began, walls of lava
were still advancing in
some places at speeds of
50 to 100 metres an hour
and in others had reached
a height of 30 metres. Bot¬

town is now being rebuilt.

ISLAND BORN IN FIRE.
Surtur, the Norse god, is
said to have come from
the south with fire and
thunder. He did so again
on November 14, 1963
when the island of Surtsey
was formed by a submarine
eruption in the coastal
waters of southern Iceland.
Four months later Surtsey
was more than 1 sq. km. in
area, but its survival as
an island was only ensured
the day this photo was
taken, on April 4, 1964.
On that date sea water no
longer found its way to
the molten magma in the
crater, and flows of lava
began to form an island.
Today the surface is cold
enough for snow to stay
on the ground.

LAND OF ICE AND FIRE
(Continued from page 16)
water level in the bowl had been
lowered, thus reducing the cooling
effect of the water surface.
The Geysir eruptions were then and
later studied by Dr. Trausti Einarsson,
who explains them as follows: "Into
the vertical channel of Geysir the
water enters at a temperature of
125° C., through smaller passages
coming from greater depths.
"At the bottom of the main tube
the boiling point is about 132° C.
when the water is standing high in
the bowl, and therefore the water
does not boil at the bottom. At a
depth of 10 m. in the pipe the boiling
point is about 120° C., and there the
temperature sometimes reaches that
level and even higher, and boiling of
the water there generates an eruption."
It is not sufficient, however, for the
water to reach a boiling point to start
an eruption. The water has to be
overheated by 4 to 5 °C. above the boil¬
ing point. The boiling then generates
a sudden explosion, and the water
above is thrown into the air.
The explosive boiling produces the
well known rumbling noise just before
the starting of an eruption, which is
really the result of a long chain of
explosions in the water. In powerful
Geysir eruptions the water column
can reach a height of 40 to 60 m. and
it may continue for about 10 minutes.
Towards the end a. steam column
emerges from the nearly empty tube.
Strokkur is of a similar type and is
situated on the same fissure as Geysir,
but it is much smaller.
The highest temperature recorded in
Iceland is 280 °C. at a depth of about
1,200 m. in a drill-hole at Námaskard,
but the deepest hole drilled so far is
in Reykjavik, 2,200 m. deep with a
temperature of 146°C.

Top, although virtually devoid of
vegetation, the landscape of
Landmannalaugar, in the central
highlands of southern Iceland is
famous for the natural interplay
of colours on its craggy slopes.
The minerals and chemical com¬
position of the rocks produce a
variety of hues ranging from
beige and rose to dark green.
Bottom, snow-covered Hekla, a
1500-metre high volcano was
already famed in medieval Europe
as"the gateway to Hell". Situated
in Iceland's eastern volcanic belt,
it is surrounded by a family of
smaller craters. One of these,
the Oldugigar crater (foreground)
is seen here during its eruption
in 1970.
