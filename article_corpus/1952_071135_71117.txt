x the United States an absolute 
1 “line” is drawn between white 
and Negro. A person who is not 
white is Negro, whatever his small 
percentage of Negro blood may be. In 
Vila Reconcavo, a pseudonym given 
in a Unesco study to a town situated 
in the zone known as the Reconeavo 
which surrounds Salvador, the capital 
-of the State of Bahia, this “line” 
is recognized rather than drawn. A 
distinction between Negro and white 
is always kept in mind when classi- 
fying an individual. Everyone knows 
who is “pure” white and who is not. 
Classification by race is one of the 
most important aspects of local cul- 
ture, and one of the most difficult 
aspects for the outsider to grasp. 
Bahians of the RecOncavo feel that 
one may instantly recognize the dif- 
ference hetween a “pure” white and 
a mixed white-Indian, white-Negro 
or Negro-Indian, but they do not let 
it go at that. They classify or des- 
cribe minutely each person; they 
classify according to skin colour, 
‘according to hair form and according 
to facial features. Their classifica 
tions of racial types are used in 
everyday conversation. Just as it 
would be said that someone is short 
and - fat in the United States, the 
people of Vila Reconcavo will 
describe a person's colour and hair. 
In the Reconcavo three race stocks 
are recognized: the white, the Negro 
and the Indian. A white is called a 
branco. The Portuguese term negro 
is rarely used to denote a person of 
African descent. Rather such a per- 
son is called homem de cér (man of 
colour). Negro is used abstractly to 
denote the Negro race, but it is almost 
never used to single out an indivi- 
dual. Nego (a softened variation of 
the word negro) may frequently be 
used as a term of endearment, even 
among whites, and it is sometimes 
“used as a nickname. When a Bahian 
of the Reconcavo speaks of indio, he 
usually thinks of the Indian of the 
interior of Mato Grosso or of the 
Amazon, When he wishes to indicate 
people of American Indian physical 
type, lie generally savs caboelo. 
Yet even the whites are sub-classi- 
fied, being divided into two cate- 
gories, the louro (blond) and more- 
no (dark). There is still a third 
term for people with Caucasoid phy- 
sical characteristics, but one which 
is used only by those who are consi- 
dered “pure” white — namely, bran- 
co da terra. He is someone who has 
the physical characteristics of a 
Caucasold: fair skin, fine features 
and “good” (meaning straight) hair 
— but whose ancestry has Negro 
blood. He or she is generally moreno, 
and is frequently “characterized by 
a slightly yellowish tinge to the skin. 
The white branco da terra sometimes 
also shows traces of caboclo blood as 
well as Negro and white blood. To 
the majority of the population, the 
brarco da terra is always called 
white, and no-one would ever call 
anyone a branco da terra to his face. 
He is accorded the same treatment as 
is any white by both whites and non- 
whites, and there is no constraint on 
anyone's part. 
In classifying people, skin colour is 
an important factor but hair form is 
equally important. If there is any 
question as to what to call a person, 
generally the hair is the deciding cri- 
ferion. After skin and hair, facial 
features (prognathism, nose shape 
and thickness of lips) are considered. 
The many designations used in Vila 
Reconcavo for the people of Negroid 
or mixed ancestry can be broken 
down roughly into the following types 
in terms of these various criterion: 
1. The preio (black) has black 
shiny skin, kinky. woolly hair, thick 
lips and a flat broad nose. The pre- 
tos distinguish among themselves, 
having what they call “qualidade, or

AND OF MEANING

quality, and they rank themselves 
according to minute differences in 
(quality of skin colour or nose form. 
The prcto with the most gquali- 
dade 1s the farthest from the usual 
concept of a Negro, but is a “prettier” 
black. 
2. The cabra (feminine, cabrocha) 
1s generally slightly lighter than the 
preto, with hair growing somewhat 
longer, but still kinky and unmanage- 
able, and with facial features less 
Negroid, although often with fairly 
thick lips and flat nose. He @eneral- 
lv lacks the definite features and 
shine of the preto.

3. The cabs verde is slightly light- 
er than the prefo, but still very dark. 
But he has long straight hair, and 
his facial features are apt to be very 
fine, with thin lips and a narrow 
straight nose. ‘He 1s almost a “black 
white man”. . 
- 4. The escuro, - or simply “dark 
man”, is darker than the usual run 
of mesti¢os, but the therm is gene- 
rally applied to a person who does 
not fit into one of the three types 
mentioned above. The “dark man” 
is not a Negro with Caucasoid fea- 
tures, but he almost is. He gene- 
rally has qualidade. Escuro is a very 
useful term for the outsider in the 
Reconeavo. 
5. The mulato is a category always 
divided into two types, the mulato 
escuro and mulato claro (dark and 
light mulattoes). The mulato has 
hair which grows perhaps to should- 
er length, but which has a decided 
curl and even kink. It can, however, 
be straightened. The mulato’s facial 
features vary widely; thick lips with 
a narrow nose, or vice-versa. As a 
rule, the features are thicker than 
the 'white's, and thinner than the 
negro’s, The mulato is - -generally 
distinguishable by a yellowish tinge 
{o his skin colour, varying from very 
light to very dark. A mulato claro, 
with straightened hair, thin lips and 
a “good” nose is very much like the 
branco da terra. 
6. Pardo is a term not often used 
in speech. It is one of the official 
classifications used in the census and 
on identification papers. However, 
it is used occasionally to describe an 
individual who is closer to the white 
than a light mulatto. Occasionally 
mestico children are described as 
pardo during the early vears of their 
life, before their features become 
distinctive enough to fit them defi- 
nitely into one of the other groups. 
In one case, a little girl of three was 
called parda by her mother. The girl 
lives with her godfather, who is a 
branco da terra. He lists the girl as 
white, since her skin is very light 
and her hair is growing long and 
only slightly wavy. But ‘her mother 
says she 1s a parda because she 
knows that “her hair may curl up 
any day, which would make her a 
mulata clara.” 
7. The sarara is not difficult to dis- 
tinguish. He has very light skin, and 
hair which is reddish or blondish 
but kinky or curled. His hair is des- 
cribed as duro, or hard. His facial 
features are extremely varied, even 
few 
more so than the mulato’s. “There 
are sararas who would “pass” for 
white in the United States, but more 
often they have a curious appear- 
ance; skin which is neither dark nor 
light, frequently freckled, eyes with 
a greenish-blue cast and hair which 
bleaches easily in the sun. 
8. The moreno has excellent skin, 
fine-textured and smooth. He is 
light-skinned but not white. 
dark hair, which is. long and either 
wavy or curly. It is manageable and 
does not need’ straightening. His fea- 
tures are much more Caucasoid than 
Negroid. Here again we can distin- 
guish between the dark and light 
morenos. Also we must distinguish 
between the moreno mulato and the 
moreno of the white families — the 
moreno branco. Morerdo, as. used 
regarding the “white”, distinguishes 
the brown from the blond of the 
sane group. 
Few people fit any of these 
“racial” types one hundred percent. 
When some one comes very close to 
being a perfect prefo—that is, has 
all the characteristics of the preto— 
people call him bem precto or bem 
pretinho (really black). The same 
1s true of the sarard — bem sarard, 
or of the moreno, who will be called 
bem moreninho or moreno fino. It is 
just as difficult to find the perfect 
type for the other classifications, 
because there are so many variations. 
Many times one must point out that 
an individual is of one physical type, 
but has one or more characteristics 
of another type. For instance, one 
young man in Vila Reconcavo has the 
characteristics of an escuro, but 
since most people like him they like 
to think of him as moreno. He has 
fine skin and thin facial features, but 
has tight kinky hair. People gene- 
rally refer to him as moreno, adding 
“but he has poor hair.” One fre-

person in question. In Vila Recon- 
cavo, it is not simply a matter of 
black and white, but of all the 
shades in between. 
A term of classification not listed 
above, caboclo, presents something 
of a special case. As mentioned 
earlier, most people with Indian 
physical traits have come into the 
Reconcavo region from the dry 
hinterland during the dry spells of 
the North. Considering the length 
of time that people of the North 
have been periodically coming into 
the Reconcavo region, comparatively 
have remained. Nevertheless, 
the population of Vila Reconcavo 
shows a considerable caboclo ele- 
ment—that is, of people with a 
reddish or bronze tinge of their skin 
colour, more prominent cheek bones 
than the African or white elements. 
and a tendency toward an almond- 
shaped eve. However, few people 
in Vila Reconcavo bearing these 
marks are called caboclos. They 
are classified instead in the loca! 
terms listed above, 
can Indian traits. “In Vila Recon- 
cavo, there is a cerlain dispraise of 
He has- 
ignoring Ameri- . 
the caboclo. He is considered less 
civilized than the resident of the 
Reconcavo. He iz often known as a 
better worker, more ambitious, 
trustworthy, more frugal and less 
genial than the easygoing person of 
the Reconcavo. In the rural area of 
Vila Reconcavo, each year many 
caboeclo men come to the plantations 
to work during harvest time. For 
the most part they stay together, 
away from the resident worker of 
the ‘plantation. 
There is a mutual desire to keep 
apart, for while the resident worker 
looks down on the caboclo, the 
caboclo feels very much the same 
about the local people. He feels 
that they are lazy, ignorant, and 
“above all superstitious. The cabo- 
clo vaqueiro (north eastern cowboy) 
of one -.planiation says that the 
workers of the plantation are always 
talking about black magic, that they 
are lazy and spendthrifts, and at the 
same time deride his frugality. He 
says he is not afraid of their black 
magic, since le knows there is 
nothing to it, but he does not 
understand it, and distrusts those 
who speak of it. People in Vila 
Reconcavo will not admit they have 
caboclo or Indian blood ancestors. 
One voung girl who is almost a per- 
fect ‘American Indian type says she 
is a mulatinha or little mulata. 
(Using the diminutive form seems to 
be a softer and more agreeable way 
of saying mulato.) She vehemently 
denied there was any Indian blood in 
her family, but finally reluctantly 
admitted that a great-grandparent 
of hers had been partly Indian. This 
girl's niece would make a perfect 
double for the popular conception of 
Pocaliontas, given a feather in her 
hair and a sarong, but she is con- 
sidered a “mulata, almost morena.” 
However, among the “pure” whites 
there is a different feeling about ‘the 
caboclo. White families say that 
they would feel proud to know that 
they have “Indian blood” for it 
would indicate the length of time 
their family has been in Brazil. 
Frequently a white child is extreme- 
Iv “Indian looking”, that is, a 
moreno with jet black, straight hair. 
The nickname of tapuya 1s often 
given to this type which is generally 
admired by the whites. “And ail 
plantation owners agree that, for 
work, no-one can top the caboclo. 
The north eastern worker of Ameri- 
can Indian physical type will go into 
the fields at six in the morning and 
not return until six at night. He 
takes his lunch with him and eats it 
there. On the other hand, the 
resident worker will go to the fields 
at six and return at noon. However, 
as permanent resident workers, 
plantation owners will prefer the 
Negroes of the Reconcavo. Little if 
any effort is made to “fix” the 
caboclo on the plantations. When 
the harvest is finished, he takes his 
money and departs. Next year he 
may come again to the same plan- 
tation, or he may not. It seems to 
make little difference to either party.
