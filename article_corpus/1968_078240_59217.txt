NINE WRITERS
OF MODERN JAPAN
We present below brief notes on nine authors of modern Japan.
Many have had novels and short stories translated into English.
See "Bookshelf," page 74, for a short bibliography of works from
Japan published in English under Unesco's Literature Translations
Programme.
YASUNARI
KAWABATA
Born in 1899, Yasunari Kawabata
revealed his literary talent in the
essays and stories he contributed
to magazines and newspapers
while he was still in college.
After graduating from Tokyo Im¬
perial University, he launched a
literary magazine and quickly
established his reputation as a
novelist with "The Izu Dancer".
Certain of his later novels, such
as "The Flower Waltz", evoke
the ephemeral beauty of world¬
ly things, and "Snow Coun¬
try", one of his major novels,
recounts a love story in the
setting of a mountain village. A
distinguished literary critic, he
has discovered many promising
young Japanese writers.

YUKIO MISHIMA
Born in 1925, Yukio Mishima had
already published an immense
volume of work by the time he
was 37 years old a dozen novels,
more than 50 volumes of short
stories, six modern plays and a
number of Kabuki and modern-
version Nô plays. Although best
known for his portrayal of post¬
war youth in Japan, he has often
turned to classical Japanese liter¬
ature for his material, an inter¬
est reflected in his dramas.
Among his works published in
English are: "Confessions of a
Mask", "Death in Midsummer",
"Twilight Sunflower", "Five Mod¬
ern Nô Plays" and "The Temple
of the Golden Pavilion".

ern playwrights, Junji Kinoshita

based on Japan's old folk stories.

ing Crane", he was awarded the

YASUSHI INOUE
Yasushi Inoué, who was born in
1907, began his writing career as
a journalist, after winning a liter¬
ary prize awarded by a Japanese
newspaper group. In 1946 he
published "Bullfight", a novel
later awarded the Akutagawa Pri¬
ze, and in 1947 wrote "The Hunt
ing Gun", another highly praised
novel, which has been translated
several times into English, one
version of which, under the title
"Shotgun", is found in "Modern
Japanese Stories" (see Book¬
shelf, page 74). Yasushi Inoué's
work is characterized by a poetic
quality, and in fact he published
many poems early in his career.

OGAI MORI
Ogai Mori, who was born in
1862 and died in 1922, played a
major role in the development of
modern literature in Japan. His
linguistic ability combined with
high literary gifts enabled him to
produce outstanding translations
of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen and
other great European writers,
translations which influenced not
only modern literature and
modern theatre in Japan, but
which also gave an impetus to
modern Japanese poetry. The son
of a doctor, he went to Germany
in 1884 to pursue his own study
of medicine and remained abroad
for four years. He was thus the
first Japanese writer to become
well-acquainted with Europe.
Ogai Mori introduced the West¬
ern type short story to Japan
and wrote plays in the Western
style. The historical stories, nov¬
els and biographies he wrote in
his later years are often con¬
sidered to be his finest works.

JUNICHIRO
TANIZAKI

Tokyo in 1886 and studied Japan¬
ese literature at Tokyo Imperial
University. After publishing a
one-act play and numerous stor¬
ies, Tanizaki became known as
a leader of the so-called neo-
romantic school in Japanese mod¬
ern literature. His most import¬
ant novels were written after
1923, and the first to be published
in English was "Some Prefer
Nettles" (about the conflict bet¬
ween the lure of Western inno¬
vations and nostalgia for tradi¬
tional Japanese ways), followed
by "The Makioka Sisters" (1957),
"The Key" 1961, "Seven Japan
ese Tales" (1963) and "The
Diary of a Mad Old Man" (1965).
For "The Makioka Sisters", he
received the Imperial Prize in
Literature in 1949. Among Tani-
zaki's major literary works is his
masterly translation into modern
Japanese of the great 11th century
classic. "The Tale of Genji".

new group of Japanese novelists
who have turned their attention
to universal themes. Born in
1924, he studied medicine, but

KAFU NAGAI
Kafu Nagai was born in Tokyo in
1879 and died there in 1959. The
people of Tokyo and the chang¬
ing face and moods of the great
city were his favourite subjects
and he wrote about them with
nostalgia and affection. Early in
the century, after spending sever¬
al years abroad in the U.S.A.
and France, he wrote two vol¬
umes of short stories and sket¬
ches which strongly reveal the
influence of French literature.
Among his novels which have
been translated into English are
"The Fox", "The River Sumida"
and "The Two Wives". "A Strange
Tale from East of the River",
often considered to be the mas¬
terpiece of his later years, was
recently published in English,
together with fragments of his
other works and a long bio¬
graphical essay under the title
"Kafu the Scribbler" (See Book¬
shelf, page 74).
