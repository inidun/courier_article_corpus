Seventh grader Shusmita Bishwa-
karma already knows she wants 
to become a doctor. Not so long ago, 
she thought it was too good a dream 
to be true. But now she gets a scho-
larship, she can go to school... a 
good start to fulfilling her dream. 
Shusmita is poor. Her parents moved 
to the Kathmandu valley 10 years 
ago, to escape the hardship of rural 
life and rising insurgency. Both work 
in a carpet factory 18 hours a day 
while she stays home to help with 
the cooking and the household 
chores. But Shusmita also goes to 
school. “I feel lucky because not all 
girls get the same opportunity as 
me,” she says. 
Shusmita is one of 847,412 Dalit chil-
dren who receive financial help to 
get an education. The Nepalese gov-
ernment started the Dalit scholarship 
programme in 2001 to improve the 
literacy rate in the Dalit community, 
a low-caste group to which 13 per-
cent of the Nepalese population 
belong. 
Shusmita and the other Dalit children 
of the neighbourhood attend Kanti 
Bhairab Secondary School in Dachi, 
on the outskirts of Kathmandu. 
Thanks to the scholarship programme, 
the school has had a significant 
increase in girls’ and minority stu-
dents’ enrolment: today, 60 percent 
of the students are girls, and 65 per-
cent are from the Dalit and the 
Janajati communities. 
Although fewer scholarships are 
available to older students- only 10 
percent of secondary school students 
get financial help- the programme 
has been a success. Bal Krishna 
Shrestha, the assistant headmaster 
at Kanti Bhairab, says the enrolment 
rate has jumped by 10% this year. 
“Some parents even pulled out their 
children from boarding schools and 
put them in our school,” he says. 
Shrestha adds that the scholarship 
initiative has driven down the drop-
out rate, which is usually high among 
poor girls who often have to look 
after their siblings or work in the 
fields with their parents.
Expanding primary 
education with 
scholarships
In the past few years, Nepal has 
made education a priority. The gov-
ernment, in close partnership with 
the school districts, sponsors several 
scholarships programme that make 
school more affordable to low-caste 
groups, low-income families and 
orphans. In the remote, mountainous 
zone of Karnali for instance, almost 
all girls from grade 1 to 10 receive a 
scholarship. 
The scholarship programmes also 
seek to reduce gender disparity at 
school. “The government is working 
with local organizations to campaign 
for girls’ education.   …

Nepal’s innovative programme to expand primary education has proven successful. 
More than 1.7 million children get government support in the form of a scholarship 
so they can go to school... and get an education that improves their daily life.

Another problem is that the scholar-
ship money is disbursed only at the 
end of the session. “How can they 
buy their uniform and stationeries if 
they get the money at the end of 
academic year?” Shrestha says. 
“Those who do not visit the district 
education office and wrangle over 
the money get nothing.” 
A most valuable aid to students is 
free textbooks. All girls in primary 
school can get their textbooks for 
free, but the government has not 
been able to deliver them to all the 
districts. This year, only 14 districts 
out of 75 received at least 80 percent 
of their load. 
“It is not possible with the govern-
ment programme alone, we are also 
getting help from local trusts and 
organizations,” Shrestha says. 
Those difficulties don’t make it easy 
for all to attend school on a regular 
basis. At Beg Lal Primary School in 
the Morang district, where the major-
ity of students are Dalits, the drop-
out rate is on the rise. “The amount 
of scholarship offered was too little 
to attract them,” says school teacher 
Krishna Hari Ghimire.   
1400 rupees per year, 
and are intended to 
cover uniform and 
stationary expenses, 
and possibly tuition 
fees. However, the 
children seldom get 
the amount they are 
entitled to.
A system  
yet to be 
perfected
The major problem of 
the scholarship pro-
gramme is that 
schools do not gather 
the students’ infor-
mation on time. By 
the time they receive 
t he  s cho l a r sh ip 
money, the number of 
registered students 
may have changed. In Masta 
Baidhyanath Primary School in 
Dadheldhura, for example, the 
number of registered students sud-
denly increased from 25 to 31. “We 
decided to divide the amount among 
all 31 students,” says the school 
headmaster Durga Upreti. 
… The campaigners visit door to 
door to explain to families why girls 
should go to school,” says Surendra 
Acharya, the section officer at the 
Department of Education. 
So far, the initiative has been very 
successful. According to UNESCO’s 
Global Monitor ing Report on 
Education (2009), primary school 
enrolment increased by 15 percent 
between 1999 and 2004, and school 
dropout went down by 42 percent. 
Overall, 75 percent of all primary 
school girls get some financial aid. 
In addition, the government provides 
hostel accommodation for 400 girls 
who would otherwise live too far 
from school. 
The scholarship amounts vary, 
depending on the grade and loca-
tion. They range between 450 and
