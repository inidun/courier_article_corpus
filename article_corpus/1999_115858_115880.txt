In the early 17th century, a Po rt u g u e s e
Catholic missionary, Father Mariano,
made strenuous efforts to convert the
people of the small kingdom of Sahadia, o n
the west coast of Madagascar, n o rth of
modern-day Morondava. Despite lengthy
expeditions to the area, h owe ve r , he did
not succeed.
One of the main reasons for his fa i l u r e ,
he noted in a letter, was the kingdom’s poli-
tical system.“If the king at least had some
a u t h o ri t y,” he wrote,“ we could have hoped
for some success. But the king only controls
the area around his home town,he is poor
and not feared,and his subjects do as they
please without his daring to complain. In
fa c t , the people form a kind of republic.
Whenever a big local issue comes up, eve-
ryone gathers to discuss it in a council.”
Father Mariano was talking about the
fo k o n o l o n a, an ancient tradition which has to
some extent surv i ved in Madagascar to this
d ay (see the UN E S C O C o u ri e r, March 1999).
But it is also found elsewhere in A f ri c a ,
where it is known as the palaver.
A key socio-political institution of pre-
colonial Africa, the palaver is an assembly
where a variety of issues are freely debated
and important decisions concerning the
community are taken. Its purpose is to
r e s o l ve latent and ove rt conflicts in cert a i n
highly specific situations.The participants
usually gather under a “ p a l aver tree” w h e r e
e ve ryone has the right to speak and air their
gri e vances or those of their gr o u p. A
complainant may opt to be represented by

c o n s e n s u s , va ries from region to regi o n .
Among some peoples, women actively take
p a rt in the decision-making.Among others ,
they settle for advising their menfolk outside
the assemblies.
One form of the palaver is the
Ethiopian d e b o, a mutual aid system
where the men of the community get
together to help a neighbour (the aba
debo, “father of the debo”) carry out a
major task. The group chooses a leader,
who in turn designates a walle to do the
talking. He has to be eloquent and have a
good voice because his job is to lead the
singing while the work is being done and
provide words of encouragement in parti-
cularly arduous moments. He also
defends the interests of the workers befo-
re the aba debo and reports back to them.
Wider participation
by women
Pa l ave rs operate in va rious way s ,e . g .t o
d e l i b e r ate about a marriage or a sale, s e t t l e
a dispute, look at the circumstances of a
c rime and then decide how to find and
punish the culpri t . But the underlying pri n-
ciple does not change. This is one of the
d e m o c r atic institutions of traditional A f ri c a n
societies which many African intellectuals
feel could be used in the transition to a
m o d e rn political system, as long as it opens
itself up more to women.
In his autobiogr a p hy, Long Walk to
Freedom, South African President Nelson
Mandela stresses the part these assemblies
p l ayed in his political career. “My lat e r
notions of leaders h i p,” he wri t e s , “ we r e
profoundly influenced by observing the
regent and his court . I watched and learn e d
from the tribal meetings that were regularly
held at the Great Place.. . . Everyone who
wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in
its purest form .There may have been a hie-
rarchy of importance among the speakers,
but everyone was heard. . . . As a leader, I
have always followed the principles I first
s aw demonstrated by the regent at the Great
Place.”
However, such institutions are usually
dismissed by A f rican politicians as old-
fa s h i o n e d .A f rican leaders “tend to distru s t
the palaver and prefer a superficial legal
s t ructure imported directly from the We s t ,”
s ays Cameroonian philosopher Je a n - G o d e-
froy Bidima.
Since political independence in the
1 9 6 0 s , young A f rican elites trained in
“ w h i t e ”We s t e rn ways have encouraged the
adoption of We s t e rn models, including legal
codes which are largely unsuited to A f ri c a n
conditions. Even today, rural Africans find
it ve ry hard to accept that a “ c u s t o m ”f r o m
outside can override sacred customs inhe-
rited from their ancestors.
“This is why bush people don’t bring
their grievances to the courts (which only
exist in the capital) and prefer to settle their
differences using traditional stru c t u r e s ,”
s ays Ethiopian scholar Béseat Kiflé
S é l a s s i é1. “So-called modern institutions
in Africa are like make-up on an old lady’s
face: it only beautifies the surface.It’s like
t rying to modernize a building by cleaning
up the façade and doing nothing to renovat e
the inside.”
And so in Africa where, as the Malian
scholar Hampaté Bâ once said,“different
worlds, different mentalities and different
eras are superimposed on each other,” the
p a l aver is “a kind of parallel authori t y.”
Mali is the only A f rican country where it has
been integrated into the modern political
system. n
