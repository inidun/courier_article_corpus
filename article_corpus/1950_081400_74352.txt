SCATTERED ARAB MANUSCRIPTS
Collected and Mierofilllled I
THE valuable and difficult task of making ancient Arabic docu-
ments available to Middle Eastern and other cultures has already
been far advanced by the Institute for the Restoration of Arab
Manuscripts. Under auspices of the Institute, created by the Arab
League in 19. 46, more than a million pages of manuscripts have
already been traced and microfilmed in libraries in Damascus, Aleppo,
Cairo and Alexandria.
The pages thus far photo-
graphed represent more than
2. 500 entire manuscripts, of
which there are about a million
in various parts Qf the world,
and of which only a small pro-
portion has been listed. Many
of them are preserved on frag-
ments of papyrus or vellum,
and cover a wide range of sub-
jects. In addition to the reli-
gious writings, including parts
of the Koran, law studies, lite-
rature, music, philosophy, his-
tory, education and science,
there Is a group under the
heading.'Cooking and Perfu-
mes".
World-Wide Research
T IDRAIMES everywhere havebeen ask d by th Insti-
tute for lists of Arab
works in their possession, in
order to catalogue them, and
experts In count. ries all over
the world have been asked to
co-operate in research on docu-
ments which have not been
properly listed. In countries
where it is impossible to find
anyone with sufficient know-
ledge for this task, the Institute
is sending experts out to study
the documents and make a
choice. Libraries with the ne-
cessary apparatus will be asked
to contribute microfilm copies
of the Arab manuscripts of
value in their possession.
Reliable lists already in exis-
tence have been consulted by
the Institute, and a selection
made from them.
For All lands
I x particular the Institute call-ed upon sev ral exp rts to
make selections from man)'
of the works which Brockel-
mann considered outstanding
in his historic treatise on Arab
literature,"Geschichte der Ara-
bischen Literature.
When complete, this collec-
tion of microfllmed manuscripts
will be available not only to
students In the Middle East.
but may be acquired by any
library on request.
Unesco is at the moment col-
lecting information on similar
microfilm libraries all over the
world which will be published
in a catalogue In the near
future.
