Eve rywhere we turn there is good economic
n e w s. The massive gr owth of the global
e c o n o my, fed by revo l u t i o n a ry changes in
c o m m u n i c at i o n , promises unending prospe-
rity that will, it is said, b e n e fit even the poorest
people on eart h .
P r o t e s t o rs in Seattle who questioned the
role of the World Trade Organization in sup-
p o rting the present contours of globaliza-
tion were widely port r ayed in the media as
new activists focusing on small issues such as
the fate of the sea turt l e . Yet the “ B attle in
S e at t l e ” was but one tip of a mountain range
of non-gove rnmental challenges to politics as
u s u a l .
This worldwide explosion of NGOs (non-
g ove rnmental organizations) actually began
about thirty ye a rs ago, in response to the inter-
twined crises posed by pove rt y, p o p u l at i o n ,
and environmental degr a d at i o n . Po p u l at i o n
gr owth can lead to deforestation or soil exhaus-
t i o n , and thus increased pove rt y. The lat t e r
fuels migr ation to giant urban centres, or to
more remote areas where the cycle begins anew.
M o r e ove r ,e nvironmental destruction by mul-
t i n ational corp o r ations can further pove rty by
d i s rupting the traditional co-existence betwe e n
people and the land.
N G O s , including the grassroots move m e n t s
f e atured in this issue,h ave focused on these pri o-
rities for some time and have pushed gove rn-
ments to do so as we l l . The recent surge of
activism testifies not to a change in purp o s e , but a
gr owing realization that certain shared problems are
p a rtly caused by the common root of globalizat i o n .Ta r-
gets like the agencies of intern ational trade and fin a n c e
are hardly new, though their current prominence
r e flects an era of much gr e ater NGO co-ordination in
the face of rapid economic change and unresponsive
n ational gove rn m e n t s.
The real question, h owe ve r , is whether a gr ow i n g
global civil society, e ven in concert with willing gove rn-
m e n t s , could begin to match the magnitude of the
global challenge. No one alive today can answer this
q u e s t i o n , but an ove rview of what is happening may
p r ovide some clues.
I n t e rn ational NGOs (INGOs) generally focus

Non-governmental organizations took centre stage in Seattle, but many have been
spinning their web for several decades around the globe
Protesting against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle,
November 1999.

d e m o c r at i z at i o n .As of 1995 there were an estimat e d
20,000 INGOs with branches in at least three countri e s ,
plus 5,000 or more nort h e rn NGOs working intern a-
tionally that are based in only one developed country.
Although INGOs have quadrupled in number
since 1970, their contri bution to relief and deve l o p m e n t
pales beside the demands posed by increasing numbers
of complex human emergencies. In 1995 only about
$10 billion of $60 billion in ove rseas deve l o p m e n t
assistance flowed through NGOs.
Yet these organizations have become prominent
global playe rs.They lobby official intern ational orga-
n i z ations with increasing frequency and success, a n d
h ave become important actors in agenda-setting mee-
t i n g s. From the Montreal Protocol regulating ozone
emissions in 1987 to the 1994 Cairo Po p u l ation Confe-
rence and the 1995 Beijing Wo m e n ’s Conference, t h e y
h ave accompanied their partner organizations in kee-
ping such issues as human ri g h t s , women and env i-
ronmental deteri o r ation on the front bu rn e r.
The most dramatic chapter in the NGO story has
been their proliferation in the global “ S o u t h .”B e gi n n i n g
about thirty ye a rs ago, increasing numbers of we l l - e d u-
c ated young people took advantage of foreign fin a n c i a l
assistance to create NGOs. Although a few organizers
c r e ated local “ c o u n t e rp a rt s ” to INGOs, most others used
funds from several donors to
d e fine their own progr a m m e s.
S e veral of these organizat i o n s
p r ovided protection from poli-
tical repression.
Almost eve ry w h e r e , t h i s
process depended on part-
n e rships between two types of NGOs: grassroots orga-
n i z ations (GROs) and grassroots support organizat i o n s
( G R S O s ) . Grassroots organizations have local mem-
b e rs and help develop their own communities.A l t h o u g h
s o m e , such as wo m e n ’s gr o u p s , are new,o t h e rs evo l ve d
from traditional community organizations such as
r o t ating credit societies that have existed for thou-
sands of ye a rs.There are now probably several hundred
thousand GROs in A s i a ,A f rica and Latin A m e ri c a .
Faced with the deteri o r ation of their env i r o n m e n t
and the increasing impove rishment of the 1980s,G RO s
and local individuals began organizing networks and
m ovements among themselve s.A network of lane com-
mittees in Oranji, Pa k i s t a n , for example, has prov i d e d
clean water and sewage for 100,000 people. An esti-
m ated 50,000 largely professional GRSOs, m e a n w-
h i l e ,help channel intern ational support to these lowe r
l e ve l s. In Bolivia, for example, a set of GRSOs focuses
on propagating solar greenhouse technologi e s.
Other organizations work on corruption or human
ri g h t s.An anti-corruption centre in Maharashtra,s u p-
p o rted by a GRO netwo r k , succeeded in getting fort y
local revenue offic e rs dismissed and has receive d
requests for help from other localities intent on purs u i n g
complaints through the court s.This type of political
activism sometimes reaches the global leve l , as the
Philippine indigenous leader V i c t o ria Ta u l i - C o rp u z
explains  (p. 2 4 - 2 5 ) .
The retreat of authori t a rian ru l e , m e a n w h i l e ,h a s
led to the creation of new types of NGOs concentrat i n g

on broader democratic processes such as public deli-
b e r at i o n , voter regi s t r ation and election monitori n g,a n d
e ven to the election of some grassroots leaders to local
o f fic e . M a ny NGOs also advo c ate major political
c h a n g e s , though protests are not always at the street-
l e ve l .A Brazilian NGO, for instance,p r ovides citizens
with a toll-free “ green phone” to report env i r o n m e n t a l
c ri s e s.Nor is there a clear distinction between advo c a cy
and collaborat i o n . One network in India, the Inte-
gr ated Child Development Serv i c e , campaigns for
political change through both NGOs and “ c h a p t e rs ”
in federal and state gove rn m e n t s.
Stronger civil societies are also emerging in Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe,and the former Soviet Union.
Only a minority of the estimated 75,000  “ E a s t e rn ”
NGOs were previously tied to Communist regi m e s ,
with the rest created or resurrected by an inflow of
foreign assistance after 1989. Because these NGOs
emerged with the collapse of gove rnmental social ser-
v i c e s , they are more likely to be service prov i d e rs than
tied to members at the local leve l .I n d e e d , some form s
of local organization such as co-operat i ves acquired a
bad name under Communism.
Among the more innovat i ve NGOs in this regi o n
are those organized in response to the emerging env i-
ronmental crises of the 1980s. O ri gi n ating as quasi-
opposition move m e n t s ,t h e y
h ave continued to challenge
g ove rn m e n t s. M i c r o c r e d i t ,
i n i t i ated in the deve l o p i n g
wo r l d ,has also gained at least
a toehold in the transitional
c o u n t ri e s.
The non-profit sector has also gr own in the deve-
loped countri e s. In the United Stat e s , for example, 7 0
per cent of non-profit organizations are less than thirt y
ye a rs old. E ven more recent are the protest and other
social change movements fuelled by the gr owth of the
I n t e rn e t , such as those described by student activist
Andrea del Moral (p. 2 2 - 2 3 ) .
If nothing else, this ove rview highlights the diffi-
culties in mapping a complex, vast and dynamic global
civil society still in its infa n cy. On a global leve l ,s o m e
business networks focus on sustainable deve l o p m e n t ,
and national NGOs as dive rse as the Grameen Bank
in Bangladesh and Working Capital in New Hampshire
( U.S.) promote bu s i n e s s e s. T h u s , the non-gove rn-
mental challenge to mindless globalization is not oppo-
sition to profit s , but rather support for broader ow n e r-
ship and competition. Most import a n t l y, t rue civil
society is more than a collection of NGOs, but rat h e r
a measure of how citizens associat e , talk and act toge-
ther in public life.
Much has been made of the Internet and how it
m ay contri bute to a stronger civil society.Yet though the
I n t e rnet has helped create global coalitions on hundreds
of issues,billions of people still have no access to a tele-
p h o n e , much less to a computer. E ven if people gain
a c c e s s , they may be more likely to see an adve rt for a
soft drink than learn how to purify wat e r. U l t i m at e l y,
the contri bution of the Internet to the gove rnance of
g l o b a l i z ation will depend on the human ties that are
established off-line. ■
