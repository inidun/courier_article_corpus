‘All I know is that I know nothing”. A s
they take stock of current know l e d g e
of our “small blue planet”, m a ny
m o d e rn oceanogr a p h e rs could well echo this
humble admission at t ri buted to Socrat e s.
Although we are starting to become aware of the
o c e a n s ’ e x t r a o r d i n a ry influence on the eart h ’s
ecosystem,research is still in its early stages and
so much remains to be discovered that it will take
time to fully unlock the mysteries of the sea.
Two decades ago the ocean was thought of
as a cornucopia of mineral wealth. But while
considerable efforts are still being deployed to
explore these riches in order to offset the inevi-
table depletion of terrestrial mineral resources,
many disappointments have combined with the
high cost of tapping these marine resources to
dampen the high hopes that once prevailed.
H owe ve r , the threats looming over the clima-
te have spurred scientists to study the oceans’
role as a climatic regulat o r. Since the early
1 9 9 0 s , research has focused on the still poorly
u n d e rstood field of oceanic circulat i o n ,e s p e c i a l-
ly in the ocean depths, and the ways in which the
va rious levels of the oceans intercommunicat e .
The havoc wreaked by El Niño has something to
do with these concern s , but the broader aim is to
extend the current horizon of climate prediction
to some thirty ye a rs , which might help to pre-
vent certain widely predicted cat a s t r o p h e s.
Scientists say that oceanic circulation is
i m p o rtant on several counts, not least of which is
to help us understand how fish—and pollution—
t r ave l . Awareness of future threats has also gi ve n
fresh impetus to the study of coastal ecosystems.
R e s e a r c h e rs are trying to find out more about
h ow they function, and to develop resource
extraction and management methods which are
less destru c t i ve to these resource-rich areas.
G e o l o gical research over the past 30 ye a rs has
r e volutionized our understanding of continental
d rift and plate tectonics and opened up a whole
new realm of study with the discove ry of new bio-
l o gical and biochemical systems along the planet’s
a c t i ve faults (see page 29). The scope of mari n e
research is enorm o u s , r a n ging from the impact of
iron on biochemical reactions in the marine env i-
ronment to ways of influencing the oceans’ c a p a-
city to absorb CO
2
, and is set to expand.
But oceanographic research is ve ry expensi-
ve , and only the richest countries can afford it.
The United Stat e s , Ja p a n , F r a n c e , the United
K i n g d o m , G e rm a ny, Canada and Russia lead
the fie l d , although a number of major southern
n at i o n s , such as India, China and Brazil, are on
the verge of joining them. To take one example,
F r a n c e ’s Research Institute for the Exploitat i o n
of the Sea (Ifremer) employs 1,200 people on
some thirty sites and has a $160-million annual
bu d g e t . Research in general is mainly funded by
g ove rn m e n t s , especially since the military
a u t h o rities are interested in using the ocean
depths as a testing ground for naval wa r fa r e .T h e
p ri vate sector usually focuses on areas of econo-
mic interest, such as geology in the case of oil
companies and research on fish stocks in the
case of the fishing industry. But the small coun-
t ries are still not playe rs , e ven if they have a sea-
board of their ow n . ■

Oceanographic research is unlocking the sea’s mysteries.
But only the wealthy can afford it.
