'ONLY
THE EDUCATED
ARE FREE'
EPICTETUS
by Louis François
I
HE road from the procla¬
mation of the right to education to its
achievement is long, arduous and beset
with obstacles of all kinds. Progress
has been slower and more difficult
than was foreseen. After 20 years of
effort, many nations are still striving to
attain" the goal of education for all
And it still seems remote, even to
those which have made the greatest
headway. Indeed, it is constantly
receding in the changing world in
which we live.
Let us look at some of the prob¬
lems created by the population explo¬
sion the Demographic Revolution as
it is often called. World population
reached 3,000 million in 1960; it may
exceed 4,000 million by 1980 and will
be close to 6,000 million by the year
2000. In the forefront of this surging
population increase are the develop¬
ing countries. Latin America and
Africa have the highest percentage of
population increase and are slightly
ahead of Asia, for which complete sta¬
tistics are not always available.
North America and the U.S.S.R. have
a rate of increase double that of
Europe, which puts them close behind
Latin America and Africa. But the
truly significant fact is that the deve¬
loping countries, which have the great-

THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION
Everyone has the right to education. Education
shall be free, at least in the elementary and
fundamental stages. Elementary education
shall be compulsory. Technical and professional
education shall be made generally available
and higher education shall be equally accessible
to all on the basis of merit...
Article 26 of the Universal Declaration

'ONLY THE EDUCATED ARE FREE' (Continued)
A global target:
every child in school by 1980
est needs in education, now comprise
two-thirds of the world's population,
and according to present estimates
will account for 70 per cent in 1980 and
nearly 75 per cent by the year 2000.
Moreover, as world population in¬
creases, its average age decreases.
Thus the first obstacle that education
must overcome is one of quantity. The
first task of any Minister of Education
Is to provide enough schools and
teachers for the rapidly-increasing
mass of young people.
The developing
countries
Needless to say, the countries of
Latin America, Africa and Asia did
not wait for the adoption of the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights
before dealing with their educational
problems. All of them, whether in¬
dependent states or colonial territories,
have long had educational policies and
programmes.
But only a certain number of the
children in each age group was being
enrolled in school each year so that
despite efforts to extend educa¬
tion, the educated section of the popu¬
lation actually diminished in proportion
to the far larger mass of uneducated
citizens. The situation was comparable
to that of a ship moving at a speed of
eight knots against a current flowing
at twelve knots and thus being push¬
ed back.
During the last ten years this move¬
ment has been reversed. The ship
now seems to be equipped with a
motor powerful enough to overcome
the current. The rate of school enrol¬
ment is increasing more rapidly than
that of corresponding age groups.
The number of teachers is also rising
though at a slightly lower rate, which
poses the question, "Can teaching
standards be maintained?"
At regional conferences organized
by Unesco, developing countries have
set the goals they wish to attain by
1980. The conference at Addis Ababa
in 1961, concerned with Africa's edu¬
cational problems, fixed the enrolment
target for primary education at 100
per cent, for secondary education at
23 per cent, and for higher education
at 2 per cent (1).
The Latin American countries have
been independent for 150 years. They
have absorbed a large number of
Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking im¬
migrants from Europe. And for ten
years they have been helped by
Unesco's Major Project, designed to
extend and improve primary educa¬
tion in Latin America. Greater edu¬
cational progress has thus been made
in this continent than in the other deve¬
loping regions.
But progress in primary education
has been far from uniform. Bolivia
with an enrolment of 40 per cent and
Brazil with 50 per cent obviously still
have far to go. Other countries
Colombia, where enrolment increased
from 42 per cent in 1950 to 80 per cent
in 1965; Panama with 85 per cent,
Uruguay and Argentina with 95 per
cent and Trinidad and Tobago with
97 per cent have fewer difficulties
to overcome.
While enrolment in primary schools
manages more or less to keep pace
with the general growth of population,
far more rapid progress has been made
in secondary and higher education, be¬
cause of efforts being made to train
supervisors and highly skilled workers
and to create a more balanced society.
An admirable feature of education in
Latin America is the absence of any
discrimination based on sex, race or
religion. On the other hand economic
and social conditions, favourable to a
small minority, but a crushing burden
to the rest, have far-reaching effects
on the spread of education.
These conditions are responsible for
many of the obstacles limiting access
to education: the low level of econo¬
mic development, the limited means of
many families, the lack of national re¬
sources, a widely-dispersed population
and a disdain for. technical and voca¬
tional education.
(1) Primary education is considered here
as elementary education for children between
6-7 and 11-12 years of age, secondary edu¬
cation as general or technical education for
the 11-12 to 18-19 age group; and higher
education as that given in universities and
technical institutes to students between
19 and 25 years of age.

South and South-East Asia, stretch¬
ing from Iran to Indonesia and the
Philippines, comprise vast sparsely-
populated territories and some of the
world's most densely populated areas.
Here live 25 per cent of the world's
inhabitants, 565 million of them in India
and Pakistan, interlocked in the Indian
sub-continent. In India alone 12 mil¬
lion children are born each year, and
schools and teachers for them will have
to be provided in the near future.
In this part of the world, 54 million
children were going to school in 1950;
by 1960, 92 million. Yet this enormous
figure represents less than half of
the school-age population of the re¬
gion. School enrolments had then
reached 90 per cent in Malaysia, 75 per
cent in Ceylon and the Philippines,
50 per cent in Viet Nam, 45 per cent in
Indonesia, 40 per cent in India, 35 per
cent in Iran, 25 per cent in Pakistan,
15 per cent in Nepal and 7 per cent in
Afghanistan. In the schools of India
and Pakistan boys outnumbered girls
three to one.
Meeting under Unesco's auspices at
Karachi (Pakistan) in 1960 (2), all these
countries adopted the Karachi Plan, as
it came to be called, whose aim is
to provide at least seven years of free
and compulsory education for all chil¬
dren before 1980. The number of
teachers will increase threefold and the
average cost of education per child
will rise from $8.00 to $20.00 a year
(it will still be only one quarter of
today's per capita cost of primary
education in some developed coun¬
tries).
Secondary and higher education will
also need to be vastly expanded to
provide more teachers, and also to
train skilled personnel for the economic
development programmes that are vital
to the success of the Karachi Plan.
A radical change of emphasis in edu¬
cation is also called for. Today, ten
million students in South and South-
East Asia receive a general education
while only one million take technical
and vocational training courses. In¬
dian universities each year turn out
116,000 arts graduates and 25,000 in
law, but only 8,000 in the sciences,
5,000 in engineering and 4,000 in agri¬
culture.
The Karachi Plan is imaginative and
far-reaching. But educational expan-

(2) That year, the General Conference of
Unesco unanimously adopted a Convention
and an International Recommendation con¬
cerning discrimination in education. These
aim to promote equality of opportunity and
treatment for all in education, and to abolish
discrimination based on race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political or other opinion,
national or social origin, economic condition
or birth. As of December 1967, 39 states
were parties to the Unesco Convention.

sion will have difficulty in keeping up
with the runaway growth of population
in these regions.
There was no delay in putting the
plan into operation. Between 1960
and 1965 school enrolment rose
rapidly to over 30 million. The rates
are still rising everywhere: they have
reached 80 per cent In India, 67 per
cent in Viet Nam, in spite of the
war, 42 per cent in Iran, and 14 per
cent in Afghanistan, although this
country fears that by 1980 it may be
only half way to attaining the targets
set at Karachi.
A special effort is being made in
rural areas to render education more
accessible to girls and to provide tech-
20
nical education. But funds are still
too limited to make good the lack of
buildings, textbooks and audio-visual
teaching equipment.
Between 1965 and 1970 places will
have to be found for a further 40 mil¬
lion children in primary schools, 12 mil¬
lion more in secondary schools and
one million more students in universi¬
ties and institutes of higher education.
Over 1,154,000 more primary teachers
and 250,000 more secondary teachers
will be needed. These figures speak
for themselves.
In the Arab countries, great progress
has been made. Between 1960 and
1966 the population rose from 92 mil¬
lion to 105 million while the school and

university population increased from
8 million to 12 million. Against an
annual rate of population growth of 2.5
per cent, that of school enrolments is
neanng 10 per cent.
However, it is estimated that 8 mil¬
lion children are not yet in school. The
Arab countries have a very high pro¬
portion of young people: those under
20 account for 50 per cent of the popu¬
lation and those between 5 and 11
years of age for 17 per cent. In Euro¬
pean countries the corresponding pro¬
portions are 30 per cent and 11 per
cent.
Educational development throughout
the region is still uneven. Country
children are less well provided for than
those in cities. Girls are still in the
minority in the classroom (1 in 3 in
primary schools, 1 in 4 in secondary
schools and 1 in 5 in institutes of
higher education). There are no
special arrangements for handicapped
children. Either they attend ordinary
classes (with scant benefit) or they
remain illiterate. Too few technical
and vocational courses are provided in
secondary schools (only enough for
1 pupil out of 8 today). And education
in general is badly handicapped by a

lack of buildings, equipment and
teachers, although the teacher shortage
is now being offset to some extent by
the recruitment of teachers from other
countries.
The Arab countries' main sources of
income are agriculture and oil. Land
reform and the improvement of agri¬
cultural methods, the development of
new resources and, in particular, the
expansion and modernization of
industry will depend to a large extent
on the education received by young
people at all levels. Increasingly, the
educated woman becomes the most
effective factor in the promotion of
children's education. Here, as else¬
where, the worth of the individual as
the means and the end in all things, is
the core and driving force in economic
development.
Africa, or almost all of Africa, is now
independent, after entering the inter¬
national scene in 1960. The year 1960
was indeed a crucial one. The newly
independent states faced immense
tasks In education. The average rate
of school enrolment in the African
countries as a whole was only 16 per
cent, varying between 2 per cent and
60 per cent from one country to an¬
other. In most countries, 4 out of
5 children were not in school; girls
accounted for less than 30 per cent of
primary school enrolments and less
than 22 per cent in the case of secon¬
dary schools. In some countries not
even one girl out of 10 was in school.
A MONG the states which
had emerged from the French
Community, Cameroon, in 1960, led in
terms of primary school enrolment.
The coastal states of the Gulf of
Guinea, which were the most
prosperous, had more firmly-estab¬
lished educational systems than
the less populated states to the north.
Mali for instance had only one techni¬
cal college with 600 places and a single
lycée. The few pupils who obtained
their baccalauréat (secondary leaving
certificate) from this school were the
only likely candidates for positions
of responsibility in a state with a popu¬
lation of 4,500,000 and covering an
area of 1,200,000 square kilometres
(480,000 square miles).
At the 1961 Unesco-sponsored Con¬
ference of Ministers of Education of
the African States in Addis-Ababa, the
whole of Africa, from the countries of
tropical Africa south of the Sahara to
those of North Africa, met and took
decisions similar to those made at
Karachi States undertook to achieve
the following targets over the next
twenty years:
six years of free and compulsory
primary education, given by qualified
teachers;
secondary education comprising two
cycles of three years, from which 30
per cent of primary school pupils would
benefit;
higher education for 20 per cent of
secondary school pupils, which would
9 African students out of 10 to
study in Africa instead of abroad;
complete equality of access to edu¬
cation between boys and girls.
Since then, progress has been rapid
and impressive. Between 1960 and
1965, primary school enrolment in¬
creased from 7 per cent to 20 per cent
in Mali, from 14 per cent to 21 per cent
in Chad, from 24 per cent to 52 per
cent in Senegal, and from 29 per cent
to 60 per cent in Togo.
Nigeria has extended primary edu¬
cation in its southern provinces. In
Algerian schools there are now almost
as many girls as boys; and in those of
Somalia, there is one girl for every
three boys.
An even greater effort has been
made in secondary education. In Se¬
negal, for example, where primary
school enrolments have doubled, those
In secondary schools have risen nearly
threefold from 9,000 to 24,000
(though so far only 2,500 in technical
schools).
As we have seen, all the developing
countries from Latin America to South
Asia face the same problems, are
fired by identical aspirations and have
launched similar projects. They are
developing compulsory primary edu¬
cation and extending it from 4 years
to 7 or 8; they are reinforcing secon¬
dary education and creating institu¬
tions of higher education to train spe¬
cialists and technicians for future pro¬
grammes of development.
To achieve all this they will have
to enrol, between 1965 and 1970, a
further 52 million children in primary
schools, 15 million in secondary
schools and 1,500,000 students in the
universities. They will also need to
tram a further 2,500,000 primary
teachers and nearly 1,000,000 seconda¬
ry teachers.
Everywhere, education is struggling
to keep ahead of the steeply rising
population. Two major obstacles are
slowing down the rate of progress:
shortage of funds and shortage of
teachers. Even if some countries were
to devote the whole of their national
budgets to education, they would still
be unable to provide universal school¬
ing for their children.
ANY countries are obliged
to recruit foreign teachers. Mali
employs teachers from France, the
USS.R., the U.K., the U.S A., Canada,
the United Arab Republic, Israel and
Viet Nam. Some 1,700 of Morocco's
27,000 primary teachers, 4,340 of its
7,120 secondary teachers and 279 of
its 450 teachers in higher education
have come from other countries. In
Senegal, only 9 per cent of the
teachers are Senegalese. In Uganda,
Kenya, Somalia and Cambodia, the
great majority of secondary school¬
teachers have come from abroad.
In their efforts to deal with the rise
in school enrolment, the developing
countries clearly need international
assistance and technical co-operation,
especially during the difficult initial
period of newly-launched educational
programmes.
Through their own efforts and with
the help of the international commu¬
nity, the developing countries hope to
build up a complete, sound and effi¬
cient educational system by the end
of the 20th century, thereby making
the Right to Education a reality for
their citizens.
The economically
developed countries
Requests by the developing coun¬
tries for funds and specialists have
become more pressing at the very time
when the economically-developed
countries themselves are at grips with
the problem of rising school popula¬
tions.
These countries have of course long
possessed well organized educational
systems and their resources in teaching
staff are, relatively speaking, very
great. However, the astounding in¬
crease in the number of school-age
children the "education explosion" as
it has been called has shaken the
existing educational systems, threaten¬
ing the soundest and giving rise to
demands for a reappraisal even of
those which have long proved their
worth.
An educational revolution is taking
place in these apparently stable coun¬
tries. Among other developments:
Primary school enrolments have in¬
creased at a normal rate, following
an increase in the birth rate and the
raising of the school-leaving age;
Secondary school enrolments have
everywhere expanded considerably,
owing to the combined effects of three
factors: the birth-rate increase; the
raising of the school-leaving age to 15
and even 16 years; and, above all, the
voluntary extension of schooling (see
tables on primary and secondary
school enrolment, page 31).
It has now become almost routine
for all children to go on from the
primary school to the first stage of
secondary education. Increasingly par¬
ents have the means and the desire
to keep their children at school for a
secondary education, since school-
leaving and technical training certifi- **
cates will give them a better start in /|
life. L
Higher education too is in the pro-

cess of changing. The flood from the
secondary schools is spreading to the
universities, a particularly alarming
development, since higher education is
just beginning to be reached by the
first wave of the increased birth rate
which began in 1945.
In our modern society dominated by
science and technology, an under¬
standing of science and a knowledge
of technology are keys to many im¬
portant posts. More and more young
women especially are entering univer¬
sities. In the faculties of arts and
pharmacology there are even more
women students than men, though men
are still in the majority in the faculties
of science, law and medicine. Finally,
students from abroad are swelling
university enrolment In many countries.
In 1964, for example, the U.K. had
15,000 students from overseas, France
had 35,600, the U S.S.R. 21,000 and the
U.S A. 82,000.
How do the students manage to pay
for bed, board and studies? Some live
on allowances from their families; but
more and more receive state grants
or take part-time jobs to support them¬
selves.
An encouraging fact is that educa¬
tion has benefited from the largest
increases in the world's expanding na¬
tional budgets. Everywhere the per-

centage accorded education, whether
in terms of the total budget or in
relation to a country's gross national
product, is steadily Increasing.
Education and quality
Progress in making the Right to
Education an everyday reality has
everywhere been hampered by the
multitude of children for whom there
are no schools and teachers.
But in education, more than in any
other field, quantity is often the
totality of quality. Once a school has
been built and the children have
crowded into the classroom, the real
task begins not only to find a capable
teacher, but also to ensure that each
child is able to use his intelligence,
receptivity and determination to the
best advantage.
Article 26 of the Universal Declara¬
tion of Human Rights declares: "Edu¬
cation shall be directed to the fulj
development of the human personality."
By making education available to
the largest number of children, the
possibilities of creating a large and
active élite are immeasurably increas¬
ed. Providing, of course, that children
are given competent teachers, pleasant
classrooms, suitable textbooks and
equipment and are able to work
an atmosphere that is strict yet
laxed, serious yet cheerful.
in
re-
Each child must also be given the
opportunity to develop his capacity
for understanding, his curiosity, ¡magi-
nation and memory and his desire to
do well, with the patient help, friendly
encouragement and active guidance of
a good teacher. Whether one con¬
siders children in thousands or in mil¬
lions, the basic unit after all is the
group of 30 to 35 children under the
charge of a capable teacher.
Reality often falls short of this ideal.
Quantity too often leads to children
being handed over to unqualified
teachers. In Norway, 14 per cent of
primary teachers are unqualified and
the percentage In secondary schools
is even higher; in the Netherlands,
24 per cent of secondary school
teachers are without diplomas; half of
Israel's secondary teachers are un¬
qualified and only 300 to 350 teachers
graduate from university each year
instead of the 700 to 800 that are
needed; 15 per cent of the posts in
Bulgaria's schools are vacant, and
22 per cent of those in the technical
schools; Denmark has 20 per cent
fewer primary teachers than it needs
and is short of teachers in literature,
mathematics and physics; in Finland
only 6 per cent of primary teachers
are without diplomas, but 45 per cent
of secondary teachers are under-
qualified; in Spain many posts in
technical schools are vacant.
These are facts acknowledged by
governments themselves in their yearly
reports to the International Bureau of
Education in Geneva. The situation is
far worse in the developing countries.
It might well be said that only too
often helpless teachers are handed
over to the children.
The consequences are overcrowded
classes (40 children and upwards);
"production-line teaching" (one group
in the morning, another in the
afternoon); teaching methods which
condemn children to listen, assimilate
imitate, learn by rote and repeat.
Unless he has the makings of a genius
the individual child is submerged and
lost in this anonymous mass.
Nearly half the pupils in the primary
schools of the developing countries
drop out in the first or second years.
Scarcely one quarter of those who
start school complete the course.
What they learn is thus likely to be
quickly lost.
In the economically developed coun¬
tries the most harmful effects are a
lowering of the general level of educa¬
tion, too much repetition, classes
swollen by the children who stay an
extra year in the same grade, the over¬
burdening of children with work and,
far worse, the turning out of mal¬
adjusted children, mentally maladjusted
because their minds have been badly
trained and socially maladjusted be
cause they have become "rebels"
against their environment, and have
learned nothing that can be of use to
them in their adult life.
These evils extend to the top levels.
In the United States only one-quarter
of university students complete their
courses; in French universities only
one student in five obtains a degree.
Such are the results of sacrificing
quality to quantity unless energetic
measures are taken to find a remedy.
Quality and quantity can well go hand
in hand providing educators are vigil¬
ant and prepared to act in time.
And such action must be directed both
to the structure and content of
education.
Confronted with all these problems,
Unesco acts as a catalyst of creative
ideas. Open to the whole world,
understanding the needs of different
countries, Unesco is well placed to
note the genesis of such ideas, to
follow their evolution and at the appro¬
priate time to make them widely
known. It has already done so in
many ways, particularly with regard
to functional (^ literacy, educational
planning, continuing education for
adults, education for international
understanding and the status of
teachers.

'Report An international inquiry into the extent to which slavery, the slave trade or practices
similar to slavery still persist in the world today is the subject of a special report
recently published by the United Nations. Produced by Mohamed Awad of the United
Arab Republic, the "Report on Slavery" is based on information from 78 countries
(39 countries did not reply). After studying the Report, the U.N. Economic and
Social Council adopted a "Slavery" resolution calling for action "to put an end to
slavery and the slave trade in all their practices and manifestations".
