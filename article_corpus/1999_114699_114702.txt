i n d i r e c t l y,” s ays A u s t rian pedologi s t
(soil expert) W i n f ried Blum, s e c r e t a ry -
general of the International Union of Soil
Science (IUSS). S o i l s , he say s , are the
forgotten part of the env i r o n m e n t . L i k e
most of his colleagues, he thinks it’s high
time the situation changed. “ We have to
make people realize we ’re destroying the
basis of all our lives,” he says.
There are no regularly updat e d
statistics, and the rate and extent at which
soils are deteri o r ating are a matter of
d e b at e . The French Scientific Research
Institute for Development in Co-operat i o n
( O R S TOM) notes that estimates in any
one region can va ry as much as 100 per
cent.
Damaging 
human activity
In A f ri c a , soil deteri o r ation statistics are
p a rticularly exaggerated because they are
linked to desertification. But in countries
south of the Sahara, the soil is not
necessarily degraded. Desertification may
be the result of a series of ye a rs of drought,
s ays Alain Ruellan, f o rmer president of the
I U S S . “Sometimes all it needs is some rain
and some farmers to bring it back to life.”
But scientists are virtually unanimous
about one thing: human activity is
increasingly damaging soils all over the
wo r l d . Soils constitute a fragile living
e nvironment which teems with biologi c a l
and physiochemical processes. T h e y
become degraded when erosion carri e s
them towards ri ve rs and the sea faster than
they can regenerate themselves nat u r a l l y.
Soils also become exhausted when they
cannot renew themselves, either naturally
or as a result of external inputs such as
manure.

erosion is not the main problem,” s ay s
R u e l l a n , who stresses the importance of
c o m p a c t i o n , which modifies soils’
b i o l o gical activity and the circulation of
water. Data gathered by the Netherlands-
based Intern ational Soil Reference and
I n f o rm ation Centre (ISRIC) are
d i s t u r b i n g . The Centre says erosion now
affects more than 20 million sq. k m .
According to the UN Food and A gri c u l t u r e
Organization (FAO), at least 12 million of
them (an area bigger than China) have been
damaged by human activity in the past half
c e n t u ry. O ve r grazing by animals is
reckoned to have damaged 6.8 million sq.
km. (including 2.4 million in Africa and 2
million in Asia) and deforestation almost 6
million sq.km.
O ve r grazing and deforestat i o n
i m p ove rish the soil by destroying barri e rs to
erosion and depriving it of the organic
m atter which it normally gets through
ve g e t ation cove r. In addition, poor fa rm i n g
methods have damaged 5.5 million sq. k m .
and collecting fir e wood 1.4 million.
Expanding cities and industries have

b e t ween 1967 and 1975.
Water and 
wind erosion
Things seem likely to get worse. FAO
estimates that at the present rate of decay,
2.5 million sq. k m . of fa rmland could
become barren by the year 2050. I S R I C
s ays water erosion is by far the most
common cause of soil degr a d at i o n ,
affecting about 11 million sq.k m . After that
comes wind erosion (5.5 million sq. km.)
and the action of chemical products (2.4
million sq. k m ) . Only 220,000 sq. k m . o f
soil are thought to be damaged by
p o l l u t i o n , almost 90 per cent of it in
Europe.
In the last few decades, d e ve l o p i n g
countries have followed the industrialized
world by adopting more intensive farming
m e t h o d s. Brazil is a good example. S o i l
d e gr a d ation began there four centuries ago,

spread, and since the 1970s the growth of
e x p o rt agr o - i n d u s t ry has ravaged the

1975 and 1980, Brazil rose to be the wo r l d ’s
third biggest producer of soybeans after the
United States and China. It also became
one of the countries with the highest
amounts of agro-toxins per hectare going
into the soil.

s o i l ’s biological structure and processes into
confusion and increased soil erosion four or
five f o l d . To d ay, b e t ween 200 and 250
million tonnes of soil are lost each year in
the state of São Paulo alone”. Multiply that
by 30 and you get a rough nat i o n w i d e
figure.
A reservoir
of greenhouse gases
Up to now, soils have been mainly
r e g a r d e d ,quite wrongly, as a basis for other

F r a n c e ’s National Centre for A gr o n o m i c

is a limited resource. “It’s a resource that
must be protected and managed, like wat e r ,
forests and the air. Its role in the
e nvironment should be valued more
h i g h l y.” And that role is not a small one.
The eart h ’s surface is an enormous and
f r a gile biological reactor which prov i d e s
food for plants. It is also the home of most
land animal species and ensures the quality
of wat e r , which is filtered as it passes
through it.And it helps to create an overall
climatic equilibrium.
Soils have recently entered into the
s c i e n t i fic debate about global wa rm i n g .
“They are both a source and a sink for
What is soil?
■ Soil is the skin that coats the earth’s
s u r fa c e . It may be only a few millimetres
thick or several dozen metres. It cove rs two -
thirds of the total land area but only 22 per
cent of this (or 5.5 per cent of the eart h ’s total
s u r face) is suitable for fa rm i n g .
Soil is formed from rocks which are
broken down by the combined action of
wat e r ,a i r , and animal and plant life.
“In the begi n n i n g,”s ays French nat u r a l i s t
Y ves Coineau, “there was just rock. T h e n
lichens attached themselves to it, animals
came and ate the lichens and dust
accumulated. Then grass appeared and
attacked part of the rock’s surface with its
roots. The plant created organic matter,
which then decomposed and mixed in with
the debris from the rock. Gradually, very
s l ow l y, a small layer of earth form e d .”
A centimetre of earth may take betwe e n
50 and 2,000 ye a rs to form , depending on
the locat i o n . In other words it is not a rapidly
r e n e wable resource.
Soil is the least understood of the eart h ’s
major env i r o n m e n t s.“99 per cent of people,
whether they’re teachers or decision-makers ,
c a n ’t tell you what soil is,” s ays Alain Ruellan,
f o rmer president of the Intern ational Union
of Soil Science (IUSS). It is hard to see soil.
You have to make an effort to look at it, b y
bending down or digging holes. A b ove all,
says Ruellan, “soil, the source of life, is
identified with death, because bodies are
bu ried in it.” ■

fa rmed regions where large quantities of
nitrous fertilizers are used.
Soils are also a fa bulous reservoir of
greenhouse gases.They contain two and a
half times more carbon, in organic matter
(humus and biomass), than all the
ve g e t ation on the planet, s ays Blum. T h e
amount of carbon in the soil varies widely.
D e s e rt soil, which has between 0.1 per cent

greenhouse gases,” s ays Blum. Soil gi ve s
off large amounts of carbon dioxide.When
human activity causes erosion or soil loss,
the soil is no longer deep or rich enough to
store carbon, and carbon dioxide is either
released into the atmosphere or carri e d
directly to the sea. Soil is also responsible
for a third of all methane emissions,
especially in ri c e - gr owing areas in the
t r o p i c s. In addition, it produces 70 per cent

and 0.2 per cent of organic mat t e r , t r a p s
much less of it than forest soil (2-8 per cent
organic matter) or peat bog, which is up to
90 per cent organic matter.
The still-unanswered question is
whether soils absorb more greenhouse gas
than they produce. In other wo r d s , can they
fix and store the amount of excess carbon
d i oxide which is produced by human
activity and is causing global warming? “It
depends a lot on local conditions,” s ay s
B l u m . “The best soils for this are deep ones
b e n e ath forests in temperate parts of
Europe and in some tropical regi o n s.”
Stocks of carbon can also be renewed by
m a s s i ve reforestat i o n , with pri o rity going
to regions which have been damaged and
made unfit for agriculture.
The effect of global wa rming on soils is
also ve ry hard to figure out. The Sahara
D e s e rt is undoubtedly going to spread,
scientists say. But at the same time, h u g e
land areas near the poles will thaw as ice
melts. In a few decades time, we might be
able to gr ow wheat in nort h e rn Canada and
Siberia. ■
