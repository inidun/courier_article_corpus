He never dreamt he would return to a free country.
But nearly fifty ye a rs after fleeing his nat i ve
H u n g a ry, Lazlo Karolyi is now occupying one
wing of the 140-room castle where he lived until the
age of 12 before fleeing the advancing Red A rmy with
his fa m i l y. After the 1956 Hungarian upri s i n g, t h e
c a s t l e , a 19th-century neoclassical jewel located outside
B u d a p e s t , was turned into a centre for abandoned
c h i l d r e n .“There was absolutely nothing left in it,” s ay s
Karolyi in a polished British accent. In a pat t e rn found
to different degrees throughout Central Europe,
collections were dispersed or simply destroye d .“ We
had a library of 30,000 French and Latin manuscri p t s
t h at were bu rnt in the court yard in 1949.My parents
bu ried some silver and china in the grounds when they
left that we have found again.”Two ye a rs ago,K a r o l y i
accompanied his 88-year-old mother over from the
United States to attend a charged reinstat e m e n t
c e r e m o ny :the Red Star adorning the front of the castle
was removed and proudly replaced with the restored
family crest.
Feasibility studies
Now, in his wish to give the neoclassical palace
a fresh lease on life,Karolyi is taking part in a pro-
ject that will eventually transform some 30 to 40
a ri s t o c r atic residences into a chain of top-notch
châteaux-hotels spanning four countri e s — H u n-
g a ry, S l ova k i a , Czech Republic and Poland—a route
running from the Danube to the Baltic.
Launched in the early 1990s, the initiat i ve is the
brainchild of Christian Dromard, a Frenchman
specialized in the field of heritage and tourism. In
a context of restructuring in dire economic condi-
t i o n s ,t o u rism from the West was viewed as a poten-
tial source of revenue for Central European coun-
t ri e s , but restoring the regi o n ’s considerable we a l t h
of castles could hardly be deemed a pri o rity for
financially strapped governments.
As part of a Council of Europe working group
on cultural heritage and tourism in Eastern Europe,
Dromard put forward a few basic deve l o p m e n t
principles to partners from the region.“The basic
premise is that the upgrading of the castles had to
be seen as part of an investment and tourist deve-
lopment programme that would help to fin a n c e
r e s t o r ation and gi ve historic monuments an income-
generating activity while playing up their cultural
value.This was readily accepted.”
As such,with cultural and tourist authorities in each
c o u n t ry,Dromard has spent the past six ye a rs dru m-
ming up financial support for his cause while trave l i n g
across Central Europe with experts on restorat i o n
and hotel development to select ideal settings.“ H e ri-
tage is not a business like any other.The bottom line
is that the historical and cultural potential of the bu i l-
dings must be safeguarded,”s ays Karel Nejdl, head of
the Czech To u rist Board. Feasibility studies we r e
conducted for a number of locat i o n s.While the firs t
châteaux-hotels will be near capital cities, the project
a i m s , in the long ru n , to bring tourists to regions that
are still largely unexplored by we s t e rn trave l l e rs.

“The idea we have been trying to get across is that
monuments are part of a country ’s tourist offeri n g .A s
s u c h , they should be regarded as an infrastru c t u r e
i nve s t m e n t , just like the building of an airp o rt or a road.
This was the only way that external funding could be
obtained for the project,” said Dromard. E x p e ri e n c e
s h ows that revenue from tourism alone can rarely
p ay off the cost of restoring castles—Dromard set
the average cost at around 30 million French francs ($5
million)—hence the need for state funding and long-
t e rm development loans. G r a d u a l l y, over the past
d e c a d e , perceiving restoration in the context of eco-
nomic development has made its way in intern at i o n a l
financial circles.
Catering with a local flavour
In the past two ye a rs , the World Bank and the
Council of Europe have made historic monuments eli-
gible for financial aid progr a m m e s. As a result, t h e
H u n g a rian end of the project recently obtained a
green light from the Council of Europe’s Fund for
Social Development while the gove rnment has
a p p r oved the granting of low-interest loans under
s t ate guarantee, also for restoration purp o s e s. In the
Czech Republic, if a contract is finalized this fa l l , it will
be the first case of intern ational financing for Czech
t o u ri s m . Although sites have been selected in Slo-
vakia and Po l a n d ,financing has been slower in getting
off the gr o u n d ,c h i e fly due to political and adminis-
t r at i ve setbacks.
At his end,Dromard and other pri vate part n e rs will
finance the cost of outfitting the castles with modern
fa c i l i t i e s ,h i ring British or French decorat o rs and local
a rt experts for refurbishing the interi o rs , and fin d i n g
m a n a g e rs ,chefs and staff who will understand the art
of cat e ring with a personal and local touch. T h e
interest for the stat e ,s ays Dromard, is that the operat o r
is responsible for the upkeep of the site for a gi ve n
p e riod of time and eventually sells the business back
to the ow n e rs—whether pri vate or public.
Finding new vo c ations for Central Europe’s ri c h
h e ritage of castles might be the only way of saving many
of them from decay. M o s t , over the past half century,
were stripped of their glamour after being confis-
c ated and declared state propert y. A select few
remained open to the public and were furnished to
r e flect a particular theme. Po rtraits and religious art
were kept sealed in reserve s. But for the most part ,
palaces were transformed into orp h a n a g e s ,b o a r d i n g
s c h o o l s , centres for the disabled, retirement homes,
summer camps,hospitals or state fa rm s.Some serve d
as hunting lodges for the nomenklat u r a . Until the
early 1990s, the Red A rmy installed its headquart e rs
and barracks in Gödöllö, the Hungarian summer
residence of Emperor Franz Josef and Queen Elisa-
beth—Empress Sissi.
After the fall of the Iron Curt a i n , new gove rn m e n t s
were faced with restitution claims,but only the Czech
Republic passed a law by which families or their des-
cendants could reclaim their propert i e s , on condition
they had kept their nationality and could prove they
had not collaborated with Nazi Germ a ny. In the end,
only 10 to 20 per cent of the country ’s castles were res-
tituted to their former ow n e rs. But while going back
to one’s roots after long ye a rs of exile may bring a sense
of justice restored, the responsibility is not a light
o n e .Dr Radslav Kinsky,a medical researcher who fle d
C z e c h o s l ovakia in 1958, is now spending his retirement
d ays managing Zdar, f o l l owing the restitution  of the
1 7 t h - c e n t u ry castle to him. S l ated to be on the châ-
teaux-hotel circuit, p a rt of Zdar will be transform e d
for this purp o s e , while the family also envisages ope-
ning a cultural centre there,gi ven the locat i o n ’s prox i-
mity to the chapel of St John of Nepomuk, a Wo r l d
H e ritage site. With forestry revenue earned on his
6,000-hectare estat e , Kinsky has financed the resto-
r ation of the fa ç a d e ,the roof as well as some of the cast-
l e ’s frescoes.
Although in Hungary castles are still officially the
p r o p e rty of the stat e , the Karolyi family has created a
f o u n d ation for the restoration of their expropri ated pro-
p e rt i e s , and more generally, to promote cultural
exchange with we s t e rn Europe. When the stat e
launches a public tender this fa l l , Karolyi hopes to win
it and lease the castle for a 99-year peri o d .“ G r a n t e d ,
in Hungary there’s a type of nostalgi c, romantic fa s-
c i n ation with castles, with associations cropping up to
s ave them,” s ays Tamas Fe j e r d y, a historic monu-
ments expert and country representat i ve for the châ-
teaux-hotels project since its begi n n i n g . More impor-
tantly he notes, the country approved its first law on
h i s t o ric monuments last ye a r ,which clearly delineat e s
the role of the state in mat t e rs of safeguarding.H i s t o ri c
monuments have beeen placed under the juri s d i c t i o n
of the cultural ministry instead of the env i r o n m e n t .
Funding has also been boosted.“The new gove rn m e n t
clearly considers that Europe’s dive rsity can be
enhanced through the promotion of our heri t a g e ,” s ay s
Fe j e r d y.
This is also one of the goals of the Karolyi fa m i l y.
Without any descendants, they are intent on trans-
mitting their heritage to future generat i o n s. “ E ven if
we had developed along the same lines as the We s t , we
c e rtainly wo u l d n ’t be living in the castle. It would be
a place where national treasures would be on show for
the benefit of all.” n
