Interview by Donatienne de San
We generally associate 
the idea of deserts 
with that of desertification. 
What’s the difference 
between these two concepts? 
Deserts are a natural feature of the 
Earth’s climate. The great subtropi-
cal deserts include: the Sahara, 
the Gobi in central Asia and the 
Takla Makan in western China. 
Some argue that desertification 
is not possible in deserts, outside 
of oases, because they are largely 

devoid of plant and animal life. 
Instead, they say that desertifica-
tion is found more commonly in 
adjacent semiarid and sub-humid 
areas, and is largely caused by hu-
man activity.
Droughts aren’t the only cause 
of desertification. 
What are some others? 
Semi-arid areas are relatively 
dry, but their main feature is their 
extreme variability in rainfall from 
year to year and also from place 
to place. It is variability, a pe-
riod of good years followed by 
a bad stretch that often leads to 
problems such as desertification 
or a decline in land productivity. 
In good rainfall years, pastora- 
lists or ranchers may add animals 
to their herds. Similarly, farmers 
who rely on rainfall may begin to 
cultivate areas that were marginal 
farmlands. When droughts return 
larger herds will exert damaging 
pressure on rangeland vegeta-
tion. Farmers’ crops in marginal 
fields will fail. Both situations will 
deplete the soil and expose it to 
erosion. 
Climate variability is one cause, 
but so is population pressure to 
bring new lands into production, 
or government policies that en-
courage the development of mar-
ginal lands. 
Also, certain governments try 
to raise exports by encouraging 
farmers to cultivate commercial 
goods such as peanuts or cot-
ton, which are less adapted to the 
climate than the indigenous prod-
ucts they replace. 
How are desertification 
and poverty linked? 
Poverty generally occurs when 
rural populations have no alter-
natives to making a living. How-
ever, people are resilient, and 
they are able to find alterna-
tives, often outside of their im-
mediate area. 
It has been suggested that the 
increasing movement from rural 
to urban areas -at least by some 
family members- has provided 
new sources of income to local 
households and reduced some 
of the pressure on rural lands in 
many parts of the world. However, 
these migrations also affect 
household and community struc-
tures because immigrants are 
usually young males who are the 
main part of local labor forces.
Is desertification  
a phenomenon specific 
to developing countries? 
There are, or have been, prob-
lems of declining productivity in 
most of the world’s drylands, even 
in developed countries. However, 
the factors that make some areas 
more “drought proof” than others, 
such as strong governance, vital 
integrated economies, mature ser-
vice infrastructure, access to water 
and other resources are often lack-
ing in developing countries. 
Is desertification
a reversible process? 
At one point in time, the answer 
was, “yes.... if you have enough 
money.” Now, it might still be a 
tentative yes, but one highly de-
pendent on local conditions -- cli-
matic, ecological, economic and 
social. There are reports of im-
proving conditions without mas-
sive infusions of money, particu-
larly in the Sahel region. Here, 
local communities have come 
together to construct low-tech-
nology water control structures 
from local materials (i.e., earth 
and rocks) to minimize runoff and 
promote rainfall infiltration. 
These are hopeful and, again, 
point to the resilience of many 
rural economies and communi-
ties. However, as things improve 
there is often a tendency to be-
come complacent and to assume 
that the problems have been 
solved for good. During this re-
cent period, climate has been 
relatively favorable. But, as we 
know, drought will definitely re-
turn. Whether the reported gains 
can withstand another round of 
bad years is unclear.
