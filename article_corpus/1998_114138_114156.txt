An inventive response 

n Attempts to describe today ’s global
c o m m u n i c ations landscape often
include glib references to inform at i o n
h i g h ways along which all humanity is
supposed to trave l , f o l l owing in the
footprints of the technologically advanced
n at i o n s. Time and again we are told that
the future lies in advanced technology per
s e , and not in the content of the products of
communication.
According to this viewpoint, everyone
should hook up to the Internet without
d e l ay and be inundated with messages
e m a n ating from web sites in the wo r l d ’s
major nations. It is also thought unseemly
for a country to try to protect its airspace
from being bombarded by sat e l l i t e
television broadcasts from powe r f u l
t r a n s n ational commercial conglomerat e s
and state-funded television concerns in
p a rts of the world that share the same basic
cultural,political and economic outlook.
Some A f rican gove rnments have been
unwise enough to sign agreements allow i n g
foreign state-funded radios to broadcast on
FM in their countri e s , thus unwittingly
c r e ating unfair competition for their ow n
local radio stat i o n s. S i m i l a r l y, most T h i r d
World television stations believe they are making
good use of the inform ation highway by accepting
v i rtually free satellite news coverage transmitted
worldwide by powerful ove rseas broadcasters.
Since they do not own satellites themselves and
often lack the financial means to send television
crews to cover events even in neighbouri n g
c o u n t ri e s , the exe c u t i ves of these television
s t ations are often only too willing to overlook the
political and cultural implications of continuously
relying on ove rseas sources. It may well be that
by agreeing to travel along the inform at i o n
h i g h way in a manner scripted in advance by
o t h e rs ,Third World decision-makers are exposing
the citizens of their countries to a new and
insidious form of colonizat i o n . From this
p e rs p e c t i ve , gifts of free television progr a m m e s
h ave a heavy cost.
The key to Third World participation in the
so-called inform ation highway lies in making
i m a gi n at i ve use of new forms of technology that
fall within their reach for the express goal of
s e rving their interests and needs. Against this
b a c k gr o u n d , the rapid gr owth of indigenous
m ovie production on video tape over the past
few years in a number of African countries may
be a step in the right direction. O. B.n
