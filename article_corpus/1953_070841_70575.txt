Regulations regarding work in danger-
ous industries are of comparatively
recent origin, most of them having
been enacted between 1905 and 1911.
THE recognition of the person-
al rights of the worker is
the result of a recent deve-
lopment in our civilization.
Until a very short time ago, no
matter how much suffering or in-
equality was caused by unemploy-
ment, differences in wealth, the
misuse of power, or other circum-
stances, it was generally considered
that each man had to"shift for
himself"to find work, and protect
his interests as best he could.
It was only when faced with the
new economic and social condi-
tions of the nineteenth century that
legislators were forced to acknow-
ledge that, where labour was con-
cerned, the absence of regulations
led to new privileges, fresh oppres-
sion, and an increasing risk of dis-
turbances and violence. The task
of freeing the human person re-
mained unfinished so long as the
fundamental principles formulated
for citizens in general had not been
legally applied to the protection of
the worker as such.
A little over a century ago, the
industrial revolution bore its first
fruits. In the factories of England,
France, Belgium and Germany, in
the mines, and in the workrooms
of the textile industry, working
men, women and children laboured
in ever increasing numbers. And
under what conditions ?
The exploiting of man by man
was at its height, with nothing to
curb or counterbalance it. A few
generous souls were tormented or
revolted by these conditions, but the
rest of the public was scarcely
aware that anything war. wrong. *
From time to time, a novel by
Charles Dickens or a pamphlet
from the pen of some sociologist,
reminded people of the existence
of a proletarian universe. Then
the matter was dropped and for-
gotten.
In French silk factories, workers
laboured as long as 18 hours a day.
In Germany, the Silesian weavers,
oppressed and over-burdened with
taxes by the King of Prussia, tried
to move their master by telling
him of their woes. The king had
them shot down by soldiers.
In the United States in the pri-
vately-owned factories of Massa-
chusetts, men worked 12 to 14
hours a day for ;) dollars a week ;
women and children were paid
less.
Nowhere did the workers have
the slightest remedy against abuses
of power. In Europe, the prole-
tariat had no vote, for lack of the
minimum qualifying income. A
worker was forbidden to form an
association with other workers, on
pain of instant dismissal as well
as severe legal penalties.
Women and children worked
under worse conditions than men,
in dark, unhealthy, airless rooms,
and without any legal redress.
This was in effect a new form of

slavery, introduced at the very time
when the Negroes were being set
free.
The French revolution of 1848
was accompanied by a great wave
of reforms. But the Second
Republic was speedily followed by
the Second Empire, and the
proletarian returned to the inferior
status which, in other countries,
had never ceased to be his.
Both in Europe and America,
however, ideas of reform were
making headway, particularly in
political and intellectual circles.
But the worker's personal condi-
tion changed little, and in some
cases grew worse.
In the small factories of earlier
days, a man could still hope to
count for something and, if only
on a personal score, to make him-
self heard ; in the vast industrial
organizations of the second half
of the nineteenth century, in enor-
mous conglomerations of imported
manpower, in a world of machi-
nery and trusts, what could an'iso-
lated worker do ? Submit to his
fate, emigrate, or die.. There were
no other solutions open to him.
gress was made in almost all coun-
tries. As a result :
A law prescribing a weekly day
of rest was voted in 1904 in Spain,
in 1903 in Belgium and Switzer-
land, in 1906 in France and Cana-
da, and in 1907 in Italy ;
Regulations regarding labour
underground and work in danger-
ous industries were enacted bet-
ween 1905 and 1911 almost every-
where ;
The eight-hour day, long consid-
ered an infringement of the li-
berty of both employers and em-
ployees, was legally imposed in
the United States in 1912 under a
Federal law, and in France, Swit-
zerland, Austria, etc., in 1919 ;
Insurance against accidents
while at work became obligatory
in France in 18J8, in Germany in
won, and in Belgium and Italy in
1903. Sickness and disablement in-
surance was adopted in various
countries between 190D and 1012.
Even in the absence of any inter-
national agreement, the reforms
were more or less simultaneous
throughout the Western world.
fore were made during this period
of twenty years.
Many persons had difficulty in
following this evolutionary pro-
cess ; and there were always in
opposition to it, those inconvenien-
ced or dispossessed by the reforms.
As in the previous case of the civil
emancipation of the individual,
certain people were seized with
panic when confronted with the
worker's economic emancipation,
and made a great outcry, pronounc-
ing it a sacrilege, a disaster and
the end of all things.
The history of contemporary
progress as regards the rights of
the worker is too closely involved
with nations'internal political con-
troversies to allow an entirely
detached presentation of it. But it
can truly be said that the period
19 : 32-W48 has everywhere seen a
new wave of social reforms, based
on the official acceptance of
collective contracts, social insur-
ance, the minimum wage, and
holidays with pay. Such measures
could hardly have been dreamt of
in won.
It was the coincidence of these

At the beginning of the twentieth century labour organizations were exerting a growing pressure on legislators for improved
working conditions. Major reforms appeared in rapid succession and ideas that had once seemed vain hopes were now
accepted as reasonable. But though social reforms have been introduced and the right to just and favourable conditions
of work has been recognized in many countries there are still many millicns of workers to whom this right is denied today.
. It shollld be recalled that, as early as the
eighlh centllry, the Chinese intellectl/als 1'011/0'01/alld Li Tai PI'warmty defended the
interest of the Icorliej's, especially the
lJeasants.
By 1900, appreciable progress
had been made and the more scan-
dalous abuses remedied. In all
countries, more or less, there were
laws designed to curb the exploit-
ing of women and children, and
to introduce safety measures into
mines and certain dangerous in-
dustries.
That was about all ; but the way
had been paned, and major reforms
appeared in rapid succession at the
beginning of the twentieth century.
Moreover, labour organizations and
political parties expressing their
demands had become powerful and
efficient, and'were exerting a
growing pressure on the legisla-
tors.
Popularized by sociologists, no-
velists and political parties, ideas
that had once seemed Utopian were
now accepted as reasonable ; and
between 1900 and 1920, before and
after the first world war, rapid pro-
The explanation is not far to seek :
the main argument used by the
opponents of a reform was the
forecasting of the dangerous conse-
quences it might have ; once the
experiment had been made in
some country without any disas-
trous results, the advocates of the
reform used this as a fresh argu-
ment in its favour, and their adver-
saries became disarmed.
International organizations were
not slow to make their appearance.
A non-political association for the
protection of workers was founded
in Berne in ! fIOj. The Internation-
al Office at Basle was instituted
in 1913. Lastly, the Labour Char-
ter was inserted into the We !) peace
treaties ; and the Washington
Conference, attended by 30 States,
created the International Labour
Urganization and its functional
body, the International Labour
Office. Enormous stridps there-
tries that enabled the General As-
sembly of the United Nations in
D48, to reach agreement on the
terms of Articles 23, 24 and 25 of
the Universal Declaration. They
were voted by 48 nations, many of
whom are already putting them
into practice. Recent history has
shown us that, given the impetus,
social evolution of this kind
spread rapidly throughout the
whole world.
The progress achieved, or still to
be achieved, follows logically upon.
the civil and political progress
made during the last 130 years. It
has been made possible only by
the establishment of unrestricted
universal suffrage, which is an
application of the basic democratic
principle of equality. This con-
quest of universal suffrage has
been largely due to the constant
and strenuous efforts of labour or-
ganizations themselves.
