n What came out of the Rome conference?
William Pa c e :The ICC Tr e aty represents one of the
most monumental advances in the rule of law in
i n t e rn ational affa i rs since the adoption of the Chart e r
founding the United Nat i o n s. In addition, the Rome
ICC treaty will be seen as a wat e rshed moment in
the post-Cold-War wo r l d , for it is a gr e at step forwa r d
for international democracy.
The 800 organizations of the NGO Coalition for an
I n t e rn ational Criminal Court will begin campaigning
i m m e d i ately for 60 state rat i fic ations of the ICC Tr e at y
by 31 October 2001, thus permitting the statute to
c r e ate the court to enter into force by the start of the
t we n t y - first century, on 31 December 2001.
n Who will bring cases to the ICC and how will the
prosecutor initiate investigations?
W. P. :I nve s t i g ations can be initiated by state part y
complaints,by referrals from the Security Council,
and by the ICC prosecutor, who would be able to
i n i t i ate a criminal inve s t i g ation subject to appropri at e
judicial scru t i ny.Testaments from victims could be the
source of inform ation from non-state sources for the
p r o s e c u t o r.H i s t o ric precedents in the rights of victims
to part i c i p at e , be protected, and seek reparat i o n s
have been achieved in the ICC statute.
n Who will appoint the ICC judges and under what
criteria will they be selected? 
W.P. :The ICC statute provides that the conference
of states parties to the ICC treaty will be responsible for
the appointment of the judges.High standards of legal
q u a l i fic at i o n s ,r e p r e s e n t ation of the wo r l d ’s major legal
s y s t e m s , and equitable geographical representat i o n
are all mandated in the treat y.
n There is a possibility that countries which have
signed the treaty can refuse to accept the war crimes
clause for seven years. Do you think this is a serious
limitation to the treaty?
W. P.: I believe very few countries will opt out for
the seven ye a rs. In the long run—no—this is not a
s e rious limitation to the treaty—presuming this
exception is not changed or extended by the
Conference of States Parties to the statute.
n What role can NGOs and pro-ICC human rights
groups play in their own countries and in nations
which have not signed the treaty?
W. P. : Our roles will be to continue to fight for
peace and intern ational justice. Our focus at the
n ational level will be to work more closely with
p a r l i a m e n t a ri a n s ,n ational bar associations and others
to advance the ratification process. Over time as the
ICC comes into being our efforts will be to support
the court and to monitor violations of international
h u m a n i t a rian law wherever they occur, to prov i d e



A decisive victory
In July, 120 countries voted
to establish the International Criminal Court
(ICC), which will judge crimes against
humanity, genocide and war crimes.

non-governmental organizations that
campaigned for its creation

information,research and assistance to victims,and
to demand that national courts and the ICC
investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes
against humanity.
n During the negotiations,some countries expre s s e d
a p p rehensions that the ICC may undermine national
s o v e re i g n t y.What do you think about this?
W. P.: A fundamental principle enshrined in the
ICC statute is complementarity.The new court will
not replace, but will complement national courts and
legal systems which will remain pri m a rily responsible.
A l s o, e x t r a o r d i n a ry judicial and procedural
safeguards—more than NGOs would have liked—
h ave been built into the stat u t e .They protect nat i o n a l
s overeignty and guarantee against any kind of fri vo l o u s
prosecution.
n Do you think the United States, which voted
against the treaty, will try to sabotage it?
W. P.: It is a great danger and it would be a great
tragedy if the United States were to adopt policies
and laws to sabotage the ICC. Most experts and
d i p l o m ats hope that the US will support the ICC
once US leaders better understand the adopted
s t at u t e , see what a gr e at new instrument of
international justice the ICC will be for the Security
Council and the world community, and realize how
n ations with functioning civil and military legal
systems which inve s t i g ate alleged crimes against
humanity committed by their nationals have nothing
to fear from the ICC.
n Is there any possibility of countries which voted
against the establishment of the ICC, signing the
treaty in future?
W. P.: Of course there is. South Africa played an
indispensable leadership role in this historic treat y
and five ye a rs ago South A f rica was still a pari a h
n at i o n . Scores of nations from Eastern Europe,A f ri c a
and Latin A m e rica which were ruled by brutal political
and military regimes in the recent past prov i d e d
essential support and leadership in Rome. T h e
i n t e grity and determ i n ation of these nat i o n s , i n
particular those of sub-Saharan Africa, in rejecting
great pressures from France, and the US and other
c o u n t ries to sell out the ICC, is a remarkable story of
political courage.
n During the negotiations, India said the use of
nuclear weapons should be considered a war crime.
What do you think about this?
W. P. : The list of tantalizing proposals made by
India and some other countries was irresistible,and
it seemed impossible that nations would reject them.
But governments knew that India’s goal was not to
o u t l aw nuclear weapons but to wreck the ICC treat y.
The nuclear powe rs heard the shot across their
b ows in Rome, and this issue will come up at eve ry
review conference of the ICC.But it may be even more
i m p o rtant to understand that , as the Intern at i o n a l
C o u rt of Justice stated in 1996 in its advisory opinion
on the use or threat of use of nuclear we a p o n s , it is
nearly impossible for nations to use nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction without committing
c rimes against humanity as they are defin e d .
n How would you react to the apprehensions of
certain countries that excesses by their military
forces during peacekeeping missions could also be
subjected to prosecution by the ICC?
W. P. :The overwhelming majority of nations which
c o n t ri bute peacekeeping troops did not share the
c o n c e rns about this issue expressed by France and the
U S . F i rs t , most of us expressed outrage that any
government would argue that peacekeeping troops
should be allowed to commit war crimes or crimes
against humanity with impunity or else they might not
a gree to part i c i p ate in these operat i o n s. S e c o n d ,a g a i n ,
n ational military tri bunals would have pri m a ry
jurisdiction.Thus,apprehension about the problem
of “excesses’’ is not that serious.
n When ICC becomes fully operational,do you
think it will become a supranational body and
interfere with the Security Council’s work?
W. P. : The danger is that the Security Council will
interfere with the ICC,not the other way around.W h at
has been done is to adopt a statute creating a court to
enforce violations of the Geneva Conventions on the

L aws of  War and the Genocide Convention of 1948.
One can only say that the new world court will be
s u p r a n ational to the extent that these laws and the ICC
s t atute are unive rsally rat i fied and are customary
i n t e rn ational law, and that the ICC’s unive rs a l
j u risdiction is supported by the Security Council. I n
fa c t , the ICC complements national jurisdiction so the
a n swer is that it will be a mixture—sometimes
i n t e rn at i o n a l ,s o m e t i m e s ,when activated by the Securi t y
C o u n c i l ,s u p r a n at i o n a l .
It certainly will not interfere with, but assist the
S e c u rity Council. One of the controve rsial prov i s i o n s
a l l ows the Council to delay or suspend a matter before
the court for twe l ve months if the pursuit of
i n t e rn ational justice and the maintenance of
international peace and security come into conflict.
n If the Security Council blocks a case against a
country or a group for one year and keeps renewing it
every year, will this affect the credibility of the ICC?
W. P. : Ye s , but it will undermine the credibility
and authority of the Security Council even more.
I know it is heresy amongst NGOs for me to say so,
but I believe the Singapore-Canada formulation* is
one of the most important achievements of the ICC
t r e at y. I believe there may be times when a seri o u s
legal and political conflict could arise between the
ICC and the Security Council wa rranting a temporary
s u s p e n s i o n . I believe that the human rights NGOs
greatly underestimate the difficulty in getting all the
five permanent members and two-thirds of the elected
m e m b e rs of the Security Council to adopt such a
resolution,much less renew it.
n Any closing thoughts?
W. P. : We have much work before us. With the
a c h i e vement of the ICC statute we have demonstrat e d
another example of the extraordinary development of
the “new diplomacy ”c h a r a c t e ristic of the post-Cold-
War period which offers the hope of better global
g ove rnance in the next century.Too much of history is
the story of wa rs won and peace lost.This summer in
Rome peace won and war lost. n
