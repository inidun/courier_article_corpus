The world produces 2.1 billion
tonnes of industrial waste per
year, 338 million tonnes of
which are hazardous. A highly
industrialized country like the
United States contributes 275
million tonnes to the total, com¬
pared with only 22,000 tonnes from
Thailand. Before the international
community became aware of the
danger, the least expensive solu¬
tion had been to dispose of waste
anywhere on land or at sea. When
the warning signal rang out, an¬
other solution appeared, and that
was to dump the waste, often under
a false identity, in acquiescent host
countries. UNEP estimates that 23
tonnes ofwaste cross the border of
an OECD member country every
five minutes. The international
30 M
hazardous-waste trade reached a
peak in the 1980s, with the media
reporting on the trials and tribula¬
tions ofships such as the Khian Sea
and the Zanoobia as they criss¬
crossed the oceans for months,
sometimes for years at a time, seek¬
ing a developing country that
could be persuaded to accept their
cargoes ofwaste.
The international organization
Greenpeace, whose members
condemn these immoral if not
illegal practices, has conducted a
wide-ranging inquiry, as thorough
as a police investigation, and pub¬
lished the findings in 1990 in a 400-
page volume. A very poor country
like Guinea Bissau would have had
to be heroic to turn down four times
its Gross National Product and
twice its foreign debt in return for
accepting 15 million tonnes of
industrial waste that could easily
be stored on a plain near the
Senegalese border. In fact, geolo¬
gical studies revealed that the
groundwater in that area is just
below the surface, and the Health
Minister called for the deal to be
suspended.
Another waste-traffic incident
took place in 1988 when household
waste ash from the city of
Philadelphia on the eastern sea¬
board of the United States was
"sold" to Guinea, which was then
in the midst of national recon¬
struction, to manufacture bricks. A
15,000-tonne shipment was
unloaded directly onto the ground
on the island ofKassa, offConakry.
The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) ana¬
lysed the content of the ash and
published a report which was
intended to be reassuring but which
recommended that the public and
unprotected workers should not
have access to the area where it was
stored. Perhaps because the
imported ash was ultimately consid¬
ered to be a health hazard, or
because it was unsuitable for brick-
manufacturing, or because of a
campaign launched by Guiñean
television, it was finally shipped
back to Philadelphia.
Waste is moved mainly for eco¬
nomic reasons. The "commodity" is
handled by mysterious brokers and
can yield almost as much profit as
gunrunning or drug trafficking
without the attendant risks. It is also
good business for industrialists to
transport their waste to a country
with much cheaper storage rates
($40 a tonne inAfrica, 25 times more
in Europe, and 36 times more in the
United States), or where recycling
costs less ($20 a tonne in France, as
opposed to $100 in Germany).
There may be an incentive to avoid
the particularly strict regulations
applied in so-called "green" coun¬
tries. The temptation then is to ship
waste to the East or the South,
because regulations still do not exist
in many Third World countries.
And yet, as far back as 1981, a
group ofexperts met in Montevideo,
Uruguay, to examine the transport,
handling and storage of hazardous
waste. In 1984 and 1985, UNEP drew
up a series of Guidelines and
Principles for Environmentally
Sound Management of Hazardous

Wastes. These efforts crystallized in
the 1989 Basel Convention on the
control of transboundary move¬
ments ofhazardous wastes and their
disposal. Although the Convention
was adopted by 116 countries and
the European Community, it has not
yet been ratified by the main waste
producing countries in otherwords
it has not been incorporated into
their national law.
The Convention was given an
added regional dimension in 1989
by the Lomé IV Convention be¬
tween African, Caribbean and
Pacific nations and the European
Community, and by the Bamako
Convention in 1991. The Basel
Convention, which came into force
in 1992, has been criticized as luke¬
warm, notably by Greenpeace.
Waste import and export are still
permitted. They are authorized be¬
tween states that have signed the
treaty provided they are preceded
by an exchange of detailed inform¬
ation on the intended export and
the written consent of the importing
country. Bilateral agreements may
also be reached by signatory coun¬
tries with each other and with a
non-signatory country, as long as
they are "environmentally sound".
Even if the Convention is a step in
the right direction, there is not a
single clause in it, as Greenpeace
points out, that bans any transfer
of waste (except to the Antarctic),
even to a developing country or a
country that has more flexible envi¬
ronmental laws than the exporting
country. Only time will tell whether
the Basel Convention will discour¬
age the sinister trade in hazardous
waste once and for all.
