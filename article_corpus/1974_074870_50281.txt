THE WORLD'S
OLDEST PAINTING
ON SILK
Visions of Heaven, Earth
and the Underworld
in a 2,000-year-old Chinese tomb
by Wen Pien
18
I|N April 1972 an early Han-
dynasty tomb dating from the second
century B.C. was discovered at Ma-
Wang-T'ui in the eastern suburb of
Ch'ang-sha, In Hunan Province. Ma-
Wang-T'ui is a mound more than fifty
metres across and more than twenty
metres in height. In the tomb beneath
the mound was discovered a woman's
body in an astonishingly good state of
preservation. The body, swathed with
twenty layers of silk and gauze, was
half immersed in a reddish fluid.
The layout of the tomb is fairly
elaborate. Its burial chamber lay
20 metres below the top of the mound.
Inside, at the centre of a triple
enclosure of wooden planks was a
triple coffin. Funerary objects were
found between the wooden enclosures.
Outside this was a covering of charcoal
more than 30 cm. thick, weighing over
10,000 chin (5 tons). This in turn was
sealed with white clay 60 to 130 cm.
thick. The charcoal and clay pro¬
tecting the coffin from damp and the
means of embalmment used no doubt
account for the extraordinary state of
preservation of the body and burial
accessories.
When the body was removed from
the coffin, the skin and flesh were
found to be so firm and supple that one
could have believed the woman had
only recently died.
All three coffins are remarkable
works of art. The outer casket, lac¬
quered black, has paintings in white,
red and yellow of clouds or mist and
strange beasts and birds wrestling,
chasing each other and playing music
or dancing. The middle casket, lac¬
quered red, is decorated with vigorous
paintings of two dragons and two
tigers fighting together. The innermost
casket is- covered with silk having
a "satin-stitch" embroidered border
and ornamented with lozenge-shaped
designs of golden, black and emerald
feathers. This is the first discovery of
a silk coffin-covering of this kind.
Between the wooden enclosures
were found over a thousand funerary
objects, including silken fabrics, lac-
querware, wooden, bamboo and pot¬
tery utensils, grain and other foodstuffs.
Among the silk objects were more
than forty garments, slippers and
stockings, all in good condition, as well
as more than twenty embroidered pil¬
lows, aromatic pouches and wrappers.
There were also lengths of fabric
38.5 cm. to 50 cm. wide which represent
most of the varieties of Han-dynasty
silk known to us: satin, silk, gauze,
embroideries, brocade and damask.
The designs, woven, painted or
embroidered, depict animals, clouds,
plants, flowers and variously shaped
geometric designs. The gauze is so
light that one white inner garment,'
128 cm. in length with sleeves measur¬
ing 190 cm. from cuff to cuff, weighs
only 49 grammes. No thicker than
the wings of a cicada, its texture is as
fine as modern nylon. A brocade with
a thick short pile on one side is another
example of the high quality of Han-
dynasty weaving.
The colours of these fabrics, derived
for the most part from vegetable dyes,
include brown, crimson, grey, red,
fawn, buff, yellow, green, blue and
white. Discovered for the first time
are some lengths of silk dyed with
cinnabar or painted in gold and silver
with printed designs. There are also
linen fabrics of different textures, the
finest having 36 cross-threads to each
square centimetre. This has a smooth
glossy surface and is as strong as new
linen today.
The most precious find, however, is
the painting on silk draping the in¬
nermost coffin. Before the invention
of paper it was usual for artists to
paint on silk. This silk painting is
T-shaped, 205 cm. long, 92 cm. wide
at the top and just over half as wide
at the bottom, with silk tassels attached
to the corners.
The objects depicted cover a wide
range including human figures, the sun
and moon, birds, beasts, reptiles and

OLDEST PAINTING ON SILK (Continued irom page 18)
legendary monsters, as well as sacri¬
ficial vessels and musical instruments.
The whole painting is divided into three
sections, representing the Heavens,
the Earth, and the Nether Regions.
The upper section depicts a scene
in heaven. In the upper right-hand
corner is a round sun, inside it a crow
and under it eight smaller suns with
spreading foliage between them.
According to an ancient Chinese myth
there were once ten suns and ten
golden crows on a huge tree known as
fusang in a place called T'ang-Ku.
These ten suns circled the sky in turn.
When one sun came out, carried on
the back of its crow, the other nine
would rest under the boughs of the
tree. A sun being carried by a crow
may have symbolized the cycle of day
and night.
Once all ten suns came out at the
same time, so that plants and crops
b.egan to shrivel. Then the sage king
Yao ordered a famous archer, Yi, to
shoot them down, and Yi shot down
nine suns and nine crows. This
painting shows eight small suns only.
Perhaps the artist deliberately con¬
cealed the ninth behind the leaves.
II N the upper left-hand
corner is a crescent moon with a toad
and a white hare in it, while a woman
on a winged dragon is ascending
towards it. This is a scene from
another ancient myth which relates how
the woman, Ch'ang Ngo, wife of the
archer Yi, stole the elixir of immortality
which her husband had obtained from
the Queen Mother of the West and
fled to the moon.
Between the sun and the moon
hovers Ch'u lung, a deity with a man's
head and a serpent's body, who has
authority over heaven and earth. Five
stork-like birds are flying towards him.
Further down in the middle hangs a
bell. The two capped and robed figu¬
res with folded hands below it are
either the musicians who sound the
bell or guardians of the gate of heaven.
Flanking them are two horizontal
beams each supporting a vertical
board, and on these boards are two
leopards spotted red. The wooden
structures probably represent the gate
of heaven which the leopards are
guarding. On either side of the bell
are monsters riding on horses towards
the sun and the moon, beneath which
winged dragons with claws and fangs
are breathing out red flames.
In the middle section, the main part

of the painting, is a dignified and
elegant old lady with elaborately
dressed hair who is walking slowly
with the help of a stick. Two kneeling
figures in front are welcoming her with
trays of food in their hands, while
behind are three maidservants.
This old lady, the central figure in
the painting, is a noblewoman. The
curtain above her may represent some
hangings in the sacrificial hall, while
the horizontal line with coloured
lozenge designs below the figures
presumably stands for the ground.
The lower section of the painting
appears to represent the earth and the
ocean. Under the horizontal earth-line
is a jade pendant, a symbol of nobility,
from which two dragons are issuing
and rearing upwards. Strings of beads
suspended from the pendant fan out
on either side above a jade chime, and
on them perch winged birds with
human heads.
Below these are two short tables
beside which, facing each other, sit
two rows of seven neatly dressed
figures with folded hands. The tripods,
boxes, pots, bowls and other utensils
on the tables may be the sacrifice for
the dead lady.
Underneath, supporting the tables
with both hands, a mighty monster, half
man and half bear, stands astride two
fish-like monsters. Beside it are two
tortoises with two owls on their backs.
Since owls come out only at night,
shunning the light of day, they are
usually depicted as creatures of the
Nether Regions.
At the very bottom are the two sea
monsters with protruding mouths, fish
tails and spotted intertwined bodies.
These may be the creature called Ao
which, according to early Chinese
mythology, could support the heaviest
weights. That would explain why they
form the base of the whole compo¬
sition.
Thus the striking scenes painted on
the silk were inspired by myths and
legends or represented the life of that
period. Whether imaginary or based
on life, they have been arranged by
this unknown artist into one perfect
whole, a gem of ancient pictorial art
reflecting the high level reached by the
Chinese painters of old.
The composition, though so rich in
content, is no mere jumble of objects
but pleasingly presented. The chief
subject, the dead lady, has the central
position to give prominence to the
main theme, while the sun and moon
and other accessories form an integral
part of the whole.
The lines are fluid and vigorous and
the objects depicted are remarkably
lifelike. The garments of the dead
lady, for example, are painted with
exquisite delicacy of touch which
conveys the texture of silk, while we
can see that the monster supporting
the earth is flexing its powerful
muscles. The sun and moon, the
dragons, leopards, tortoises, birds and
sea monsters appear thoroughly vivid
and lifelike.
The use of such mineral dyes as
cinnabar, azurite and malachite has
produced glowing and resplendent
colours, while the perfect symmetry of
the composition induces a sense of
order and harmony.
The tomb has also yielded more than
180 pieces of lacquerware retaining
their original lustre. Some of the lines
on the surface designs are as fine as
silken threads. Most of these wares
are inscribed inside or outside with the
name of the owner or with the purpose
and capacity of the utensils. When
first unearthed some of them contained
lotus-root, or food made of rice and
flour. On some lacquer plates were
ox-bones, chicken-bones and fish.
HE objects made of
bamboo and wood include 162 wooden
figurines, 312 bamboo slips and 48
bamboo vessels. The wooden fi¬
gurines are dressed in coloured gar¬
ments or have clothing painted on
them. Twenty-three of them are giving
a performance of music and dancing;
opposite them are lacquer stands,
screens, a walking-stick, a scented
pouch, a powder-box and lacquer trays
heaped with food. This evidently
represents a feast during the dead
lady's lifetime.
Slips of bamboo were used for
writing on before the invention of
paper. Those found in the tomb were
inscribed in elegant calligraphy with
the number, size and name of different
objects in the tomb. These ink in¬
scriptions are still clear and unblurred.
The woven bamboo vessels with covers
contained silk, pendants, meat, veg¬
etables, eggs, fruit and medicinal herbs.
Among the musical instruments are
a 25-stringed zither 1.16 metres long
with four pegs; a pipe-organ 90 cm.
long with 22 pipes in two rows; and
twelve bamboo pitch-pipes. These
well-preserved musical instruments
provide valuable material for the study
of ancient Chinese music.
There were 50 pottery objects in the
tomb including tripods, food containers
with lids and wine-pots, some with
a yellow glaze or painted surface.
These contained cereals, pickles and
fruit.
Inscriptions in ink or clay seals on
the funerary ware indicate that these
objects belonged to the family of the
Marquis of T'ai. According to Han-
dynasty histories, the hereditary title
of Marquis of Tai was created in
193 B.C. and the title remained in the
family for four generations. The
woman in the tomb was probably the
wife of the first marquis. This
nobleman, who was chancellor of the
Prince of Ch'ang-sha, ranked relatively
low in the Han aristocracy.
The unearthing of the Ma-Wang-T'ui




tomb is a significant discovery in ft|»
contemporary Chinese archaeology, a yX
find of considerable value for the study ^^
of the culture and history of the early
Han Dynasty.
