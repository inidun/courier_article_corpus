reas food production is gr owing at a rate of
1.5 per cent per year. Investment in irriga-
tion has virtually ceased and good land is
being lost to industri a l i z at i o n . If present
trends continue, it will not be possible to
meet future demand for food.
To what extent can new technologies help
to boost yields? Where is rice research
heading?
We now have rice va rieties which have a
yield potential of about 10 tonnes per hec-
tare.However,the present average yield of
i rri g ated rice in Asia is around 5 tonnes
per hectare under best management. To
increase the average output to 8 tonnes,
we have to fine-tune the production system
and invest more in irri g ation and in educa-
ting fa rm e rs about new technologi e s.We are
c o n fident that by early in the next century,
new seed varieties with a yield potential of
12 to 12.5 tonnes per hectare will be avai-
lable.
The future of rice research will be
o riented more towards eco-friendly agri-
culture. Rice breeders worldwide are now
d e veloping new rice plants which are
drought-resistant and pest-resistant, a n d
h ave the inbuilt capacity to outgr ow we e d s.
In the next 30 to 50 ye a rs ,t e m p e r at u r e - s e n-
sitive rice plants will also be needed with
tolerance to higher temperatures because of
global warming.
What is the next step for the International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI)?
At the IRRI, our next aim is to bring

Experts have warned of a possible food
crisis in Asia in the coming decades due to
population growth combined with lowered
rates of food production. Is there a
possibility of famine surfacing again in
some Asian countries?
The Asian region will definitely fa c e
food shortage some time in the future if
present trends continue. In most A s i a n
c o u n t ri e s , where the staple food is ri c e ,
p o p u l ation gr owth has not yet stabilized
and the demand for food is increasing.
According to UN estimates, by 2020 the
world population will have swollen to
around 8 billion people, 5 billion of whom
will be rice consumers. We estimate that
the wo r l d ’s rice harvest must increase from
the present 560 million tonnes to 840 mil-
lion tonnes per year to meet the demand.A l l
this has to come from existing agricultural
land, as no more cropland is available in
m a ny countri e s.While increasing food pro-
d u c t i o n , the Asian countries should also
think about active population control pro-
grammes.
How fast is food growth increasing to meet
the demand?
Unfortunately food production is not
keeping pace with population gr ow t h .B e t-
ween 1960 and 1990,global food produc-
tion was increasing at a rate of 2.8 per cent
per year while population grew at a rate of
b e t ween 2.1 and 2.2 per cent. So there wa s
not much of a problem. H owe ve r , the situa-
tion changed in the 1990s. N ow populat i o n
is increasing at the rate of 1.8 per cent whe-
about a “Green Green Revo l u t i o n ” to pro-
duce more rice from less land and water,
and without chemical pesticides or herbi-
c i d e s. For this we have developed a new
plant type, called “Super Rice”, which is in
the experimental stages.This new plant, a
product of conventional breeding methods,
will have an entirely different architecture
from that of our earlier seed varieties.
In IR8, the first high-yielding ri c e
va ri e t y, half of the plant’s weight is grain and
half is straw, whereas the new Super Rice
plant is 60 per cent grain and 40 per cent
straw.This new variety will have increased
photosynthetic capacity, directing more
energy into grain production and less into
f o l i a g e .An early prototype of this new plant
was developed a few ye a rs ago and now we
are working to improve the grain quality and
to incorp o r ate genes that will gi ve the seed
variety disease and pest resistance so that
fa rm e rs wo n ’t have to use pesticides. For the
f i rst time, we have “ b o rr owe d ” the gene
t h at gi ves maize its stem strength and intro-
duced it into the new plant.This will enable
the plant to carry more gr a i n s , increasing the
yield by at least 25 per cent compared to
existing varieties. We hope to release it to
Asian farmers by early next century.

high-yielding rice varieties to prevent a
food crisis. That led 
to the Green Revolution.Then came eco-
friendly agriculture and now efforts are
being made to develop genetically
modified seeds. How would you describe
this transition?
Asia witnessed acute food shortages in
the 1960s and it was urgent to step up food
production.This was achieved by develo-
ping high-yielding rice varieties like IR-8,
IR-36 and IR-64 at the IRRI which mat u r e d
in 110 days compared to the 180 day s
required for traditional va ri e t i e s.This trans-
f o rm at i o n , better known as the Green Revo-
l u t i o n , helped to double rice production in
Asia between 1967 and 1992, ave rt i n g
famine in many countri e s. In some countri e s
like Indonesia, rice production trebled.
H owe ve r , it was realized during the process
t h at indiscri m i n ate use of pesticides and
f e rt i l i z e rs caused environmental damage. S o
the emphasis shifted towards sustainable
agriculture. Farmers were encouraged to
use organic manure, compost and bio-fer-
t i l i z e rs. Subsequently new seed va ri e t i e s ,
genetically resistant to certain insect pests,
were also deve l o p e d , minimizing the use
of hazardous pesticides.
On the social side, we realized that the
new seed varieties were more successful in
irrigated areas with good water resources.
The impact of new technology was minimal
in uplands and rain-fed areas, where most
of the poor farmers lived. Our next chal-
lenge is to develop drought-resistant rice
va rieties to help those fa rm e rs living in
unfavourable environments.

As a prominent actor in the Green
Revolution how would you react to
criticism that excessive use of fertilizers
and pesticides resulted in soil degradation?
I think most of this criticism is unjusti-
fied. We were about to witness famine in
Asia in the 1960s and the priority was to
increase food production. So mineral fert i-
l i z e rs and pesticides were used to boost
p r o d u c t i v i t y. But there is no evidence or
d ata to show that soil degr a d ation occurr e d
because of the Green Revolution process. I t
could have happened because of improper
use of agricultural lands. Excessive use of
f e rt i l i z e rs and pesticides and no proper
drainage systems in fields during heav y
rains or floods also contri buted to soil degr a-
d at i o n .N ow we actively promote Integr at e d

rationalize pesticide use.
There are a lot of misconceptions about
the use of mineral fert i l i z e rs. Our research
findings have proved that rice plants defin i t e l y
need balanced nutrients to produce more
gr a i n .Whether these nutrients come from
mineral fert i l i z e rs or organic manure does not
m at t e r. Look at the fa rm e rs in the U. S .a n d
other developed countries who continue to
use fert i l i z e rs and harvest higher yields.If there
were problems in using mineral fert i l i z e rs ,
they would be the first ones to raise the alarm .
If fertilizers are not harmful why are some
farmers opting for organic farming?
Some farmers go for organic farming,
without using mineral fertilizers or pesti-
cides, because it is lucrative and there is a
demand for organic food in Western coun-
tries. But their production level is half of
what they used to harvest before by using
f e rt i l i z e rs. I am sure that if all fa rm e rs sw i t-
ched over to organic fa rm i n g, c u rrent food
production would be reduced by half, t ri g-
g e ring a food cri s i s. In my view, o r g a n i c
fa rming is not a viable altern at i ve but a
recipe for disaster.
Some say that many traditional rice
varieties have disappeared as a result of
48 The UNESCO Courier - June 1999
T A L K I N G  T O …
The man b e h i n d the miracle
the introduction of IRRI’s new varieties,
resulting in loss of genetic diversity. What
is your response to this view?
It is natural for fa rm e rs to switch over to
new varieties providing higher yields. As a
c o n s e q u e n c e , the number of va rieties in
farmers’ fields goes down. In the U.S., for
e x a m p l e , fa rm e rs were gr owing over 50
va rieties of soya bean 30 ye a rs ago but now
they cultivate only five or six new high-yiel-
ding varieties. How can you stop farmers
from using a new variety which gives them
higher yields? It is not true that traditional
seed va rieties have been lost foreve r. We
collect those va rieties and save them in our
g e rmplasm bank at the IRRI. So fa r ,a b o u t
85,000 traditional rice varieties have been
collected from many parts of Asia, which
were grown before the Green Revolution.
Similarly countries like Indonesia, I n d i a
and China also have their own seed col-
lection centres.These will be used for gene-
rations to come when we want to develop
new seed varieties.
I disagree with the view that the genetic
potential of those traditional va rieties is
lost completely.When a new va riety is deve-
l o p e d , rice breeders incorp o r ate genes from
30 to 40 different traditional varieties and
incorporate them into the new seed.Take
the case of IR-64, a very popular variety
among Asian farmers. It has genes taken
from at least 44 different parents.We cannot
d e velop modern va rieties without tradi-
tional varieties.
According to a UN report, global fresh
water supplies are barely half of what 
they were 20 years ago and the shortage 
is likely to increase in the coming years.
How can farmers cope with the water
shortage?
This is going to be another major pro-
blem in future. Rice is a high wat e r - c o n s u-
ming crop but we find fa rm e rs using more
water than is actually required. On ave r a g e ,
fa rm e rs use 5,000 litres of water to produce
one kilogram of ri c e . It is not essential to use
so much wat e r. N ow there are technologi e s
available to produce one kilo of rice with as
little as 1,500 to 2,000 litres of wat e r.U n f o r-
t u n ately many fa rm e rs are not aware of these
new trends and do not have access to the new
t e c h n o l o gi e s. There is a misconception
among fa rm e rs that they need to maintain a
few inches of water above ground level in ri c e
fields throughout the gr owing peri o d . We
h ave shown that it is enough to keep the soil
s at u r ated with wat e r.A new initiat i ve needs
to be launched by rice-producing countri e s
to educate rice fa rm e rs about water mana-
g e m e n t .
There is a strong demand to produce more
rice to solve the food problem.However,
some environmental groups complain that
methane gas, which emerges out of rice
fields, contributes to the greenhouse effect.
How can this problem be solved?
It is true that methane emission occurs in
rice fields but the problem has been exag-
g e r at e d .S t atistics show that only 15 per cent
of global methane emission ori gi n ates from
paddy fields. The remaining 85 per cent
comes from industrial activities wo r l d w i d e .
So we should first try to reduce methane
emissions from industry by introducing alter-
n at i ve eco-friendly technologi e s. But yo u
cannot stop rice production. Rice will



Dr Gurdev Singh Khush may not be a house-
hold name. But his rice varieties are. In the
last 32 years, he and his team at the Interna-
tional Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila,
have introduced over 300 new grain va r i e t i e s,
including IR8, I R 3 6 , IR64 and IR72,which triggered
the Green Revolution in Asia in the 1960s. To d a y,
IRRI rice varieties and their progenies are planted
in over 70 per cent of the world’s rice-fields.
“Farmers were initially sceptical about our
new grain va r i e t i e s,which took less time to mature
than traditional varieties. But our perseverance
paid dividends,” recalls Dr Khush. During the fir s t
25 years of Dr Khush’s programme, world rice
production doubled from 256 million tonnes in
1966 to 518 million tonnes in 1990,enabling an
additional 700 million people to obtain adequate
nutrition.
In 1976,Dr Khush introduced IR36, called “ t h e
miracle rice” that has since become one of the
w o r l d ’s most widely grown food crop va r i e t i e s.
According to IRRI estimates, IR36 has added about
five million tonnes of rice annually to A s i a ’s food
supply and accounts for an additional $1 billion
yearly income to Asian farmers.
What prompted Khush to take up a career in
agricultural research? “I come from Punjab, in nor-
thern India. There was a lot of poverty and not
enough food. My father was a farmer, and he
strongly encouraged me to do something for the
agricultural community,” says the 64-year- o l d
scientist. His pioneering research has won him
many awards, the most notable being the World
Food Prize in 1996,which he won for his contri-
bution to “ a d vancing human development by
improving the quality, quantity or availability of
the world’s food supply.” The prize, w i d e l y
regarded as the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for
agriculture, is awarded by the World Food Prize
Foundation based at Des Moines (USA).
Khush is now working on new grain va r i e t i e s
designed to increase yields by another 25 per
c e n t .“ The mission of my life is to continue to work
towards the improvement of rice, and to be able
to feed more and more people,” says Dr Khush
who now lives in Los Banos, near Manila in the
Philippines, with his wife, Dr Harwant K.Khush.

I am sure that if all farmers switched over to organic farming,
c u r rent food production would be reduced by half, triggering a
food crisis. In my view, o rganic farming is not a viable
alternative but a recipe for disaster

The world’s top ten rice-producing countries (thousands of tonnes)
continue to be gr own because it is the food
of humanity.At the IRRI we are also wo r k i n g
on ways to minimize or eliminate methane
emissions from rice fie l d s.
Many Asian countries talk about land re f o r m
designed to even out the distribution of
farmland among farmers and laboure rs.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y, in many countries land re f o r m
has not become a reality for socio-political
re a s o n s. Do you believe that the pre s e n t
unequal distribution of land has any
relevance to food production? 
Equal land distri bution among fa rm e rs
is highly relevant because it not only refle c t s
on food production but also on socio-eco-
nomic conditions. Look at the Indian expe-
ri e n c e . In states like West Bengal and Punjab,
land reforms were carried out in the 1960s
and 1970s and food production in those
r e gions has increased as a result. On the
c o n t r a ry, in the eastern state of Bihar most of
the land is owned by a handful of landlords.
This unequal land distri bution is the main
reason for the clashes between landow n e rs
and labourers there for the last 50 ye a rs.
B i h a r ’s average food production is also ve ry
l ow compared to other stat e s. In the Philip-
p i n e s , land reforms were introduced in the
early 1970s and since then rice lands have
been owned by rice producers , not by land-
l o r d s. Japan also undertook land reform s
after the Second World War and food pro-
duction has increased steadily since then.
Reports have shown that cultivable areas in
Asia are decreasing gradually due to rapid
urbanization and industrialization. What
repercussions will this have in the next 25
years?
In many Asian countri e s , p r o d u c t i ve
agricultural land is situated close to cities
and towns. When the cities expand these
lands become the first victims. In China, f o r
example,agricultural land is disappearing
rapidly to meet the demands of industrial
and housing projects. In the 1970s, the area
under rice cultivation in China was ove r
35 million hectares. By 1990 the figure had
dropped to 31 million hectares. C h i n a
doesn’t have additional land which can be
c o nve rted to agricultural purp o s e s. T h e
Chinese government is aware of this pro-
blem and has introduced strict laws to pre-
vent agricultural land from being conve rt e d
to industrial and housing purposes.

because of increasing demand for houses
and fa c t o ri e s , and in the Philippines,they lose
around 10,000 hectares of rice fields for the
same reasons.We should remember that ri c e
fields being consumed by urban gr ow t h
cannot simply be replaced by clearing more
f o r e s t s. C o u n t ries such as the Philippines
d o n ’t have much forest left.To partly com-
p e n s at e ,Asian countries should try to bri n g
more areas under irri g at i o n . Again that
requires a lot of inve s t m e n t .
Scientists say that the arrival of monsoon
rains has been either delayed or advanced
due to global climate change, affecting
farming communities in many Asian
countries. What could the consequences be
if the pattern continues?
It will be ve ry destru c t i ve for agri c u l t u r e
if this change in the we ather pat t e rn ,k n ow n
as the La Niña effect, s t rikes again this ye a r.
In Southeast Asia last year, the monsoon
was delayed by four months whereas it
rained heavily during the harvest season so
that rice crops were destroyed.As a result,
rice fa rm e rs have suffered heavy losses in the
last two years. Rice production in the Phi-
lippines and Indonesia has gone into sharp
decline following the La Niña effect. I hope
this continues to be a rare phenomenon,
which occurs once eve ry 10 ye a rs or more.
If it happens every year then it will have a
devastating effect on rice cultivation.
Has the Asian financial crisis had an impact
on rice production?
The Asian financial crisis pri m a ri l y
affected South Korea,T h a i l a n d , I n d o n e s i a
and Malay s i a . In South Korea and Malay s i a ,
the agricultural sector was unaffected, a n d
rice production in those countries has been
n o rmal for the last two ye a rs. T h a i l a n d
managed to withstand the crisis mainly
because of its strength in rice cultivat i o n .
M a ny Thais who were working in fa c t o ri e s
m oved back to rice fields following the eco-
nomic cri s i s.As a result, the area under ri c e
c u l t i vation increased and Thailand was able
to produce more rice than in the previous
ye a rs.The Thai gove rnment has realized that
rice cultivation is the country ’s backbone, a n d
is paying more attention to agriculture now.
In Indonesia, the economic crisis has
had an adve rse impact. In the afterm ath of
the cri s i s , the cash-strapped Indonesian
g ove rnment stopped giving subsidies for fer-
t i l i z e rs and fertilizer prices shot up.M a ny ri c e
fa rm e rs had to abandon their crops because
they simply could not afford to buy fert i l i z e rs
at the new rat e s. Economic cri s i s , along with
La Niña, hit rice output in Indonesia last
ye a r , reducing rice stocks to their lowe s t
l e vel in the last decade. Indonesia was a ri c e
e x p o rter until a few ye a rs ago but now
i m p o rts three million tonnes a ye a r.
What about China?
M a ny experts have predicted that China
is likely to face a major food shortage in the
next century.The population is still increa-
sing at the rate of 1.1 per cent. It is estimat e d
t h at the population gr owth rate will stabilize
only after touching the 1.6 billion mark
compared to the present 1.2 billion.That
means another 400 million to 500 million
more people to feed. Only 11 per cent of the
total land area in China is suited to agri-
c u l t u r e .The rest consists of mountains and
deserts. So China will become the largest
i m p o rter of food grains 30 ye a rs from now.
