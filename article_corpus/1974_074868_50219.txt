AND THE SEA

on the bounties of the ocean
for their economic prosperity

i^hVER since the earliest
settlers came from Norway in the late
9th century, the history of Iceland and
the life of the Icelandic nation have
been closely linked to the sea, to its
bounty and to Its caprices.
The climate of Iceland is a cold
temperate one, but considering the
country's geographic position, very
mild, especially in winter. The country
lies on the boundary between warm
and cold currents, both in the air and
in the sea.
The chief characteristic of the cli¬
mate is a sudden alternation between
cold winds from the north and warm
air currents from the Atlantic. Warm
and moist air currents cause thaws
in the winter and wet and cool
weather in the summer, sometimes
for weeks on end. If winds blow from
Greenland, the result may be lengthy
periods of frost in the winter, especially
in the north.
Iceland lies at the confluence of
dissimilar ocean currents (warm Atlan¬
tic waves carried by a branch of the
Gulf Stream and cold water originating
in the so-called East Icelandic current)
and this, too, greatly affects the
climate.
For a succinct characterization of the
oceanography of Iceland, one can
hardly improve upon the Icelandic poet
who described the country as being:
On one side embraced by a warming
[flood,
By the sea-ice harshly grasped on the
[other.
As a result, there is a considerable
difference in the temperature of the
sea off different parts of the country.
In coastal waters in the north and east
the temperature of the sea ranges
from 1 to 2° C. during the coldest
winter months and from 8 to 9° C.
in the summer. Off the south coast it
is close to 11° C. In the summer and
rarely goes below 6° C. in the winter.
Considering the latitude, these
temperatures are very high, especially
the winter temperature. The ocean is
thus the great heat reservoir which
tempers the climate of the country
and makes it habitable in spite of
high latitude, gales and drift Ice.
Three factors determine the climate
of Iceland: the country's position on
the borderline between warm and cold
air currents, the influence of different
ocean currents, and the extent of the
drift ice.
Due to extensive vertical mixing of
sea waters, especially rapid in the
boundary zone between the warm and
the cold ocean currents, the sea
around Iceland is constantly replen
ished with nutrients creating highly
favourable conditions for the vegeta¬
tion that is the basis of life in the
ocean. As a result, biological condi¬
tions on the continental shelf off
Iceland make It one of the richest
spawning and nursery grounds for
commercially important species of fish
in the whole North Atlantic.
Considerable climatic changes have
taken place in the Northern Hemi¬
sphere in past centuries. It is believed
that in Iceland's early Settlement Age
the Far North enjoyed a relatively mild
climate, and at that time Iceland had
some forests, which have since mostly
disappeared. It seems probable that
the favourable climate of this period
facilitated the settlement of Greenland.
In more recent centuries we have
records of cold periods often lasting
for years or even decades. Thus there
were great ice years and exceptionally
cold weather in Iceland from 1686 to
1704. Severe frosts and drift ice made
it very difficult for the fishermen to go
out, and at the same time the fishing
was extremely poor in many places.
In the 20th century the Far North
has undergone the greatest climatic
changes in its recorded history, con¬
sisting chiefly in a rise in the tempera¬
ture of air and sea and a reduction
in the amount of drift ice. The effects

ICELANDERS AND THE SEA (Continued)
Fishing accounts for 80 per cent of exports

of these changes have been very
noticeable In Iceland. The rise in tem¬
perature was particularly rapid In the
1920s, but the peak seems to have
been reached between 1930 and 1940.
These changes in the climate were
accompanied by changes in the marine
fauna around Iceland, Including a wider
distribution of more southerly species
and an increase in the number of
spawning grounds for commercially
important species, especially cod.
But during the last decade the cli¬
mate began to grow colder again: in
particular 1968 and 1969 were cold
years. This most recent change in the
climate has again affected the distri¬
bution of fish species around Iceland,
especially herring, whose feeding
migrations have moved farther east
and finally, in the last few years, north
to the Spitzbergen region. As a result,
no herring has been caught off the
north coast of Iceland since 1968.
HE ships of the settlers
were too small to carry livestock in
large numbers along with people and
household goods, and the settlers'
herds of sheep and cattle were there¬
fore bound to be very small. So their
livelihood at first depended far less on
farming than on the hunting and fishing
provided by the sea.
The Icelanders soon began to build
boats, no doubt using driftwood which
presumably was plentiful. In a country
practically without forests, the drift¬
wood also came in handy for housing
men and beasts and as material for
various household articles.
There was also seal hunting and
sea-bird catching for the Icelanders to
take advantage of, as well as an occa¬
sional stranded whale. The sea thus
proved to the settlers a generous
bringer of varied gifts.
Although the Icelanders have
throughout most of their history, in
fact up until the end of the 19th cen¬
tury, been regarded as an agricultural
nation, marine products have always
been the nation's most sought after
export goods, besides forming in large
measure the basis of the national diet.
For some time after the settlement,
the Icelanders had a considerable num¬
ber of merchant ships of their own
in which they went on trading voyages
to various foreign lands. In addition
to voyages to Greenland and America,
we have reports of Icelandic traders
in the Baltic, in France, in the British
Isles, and, most commonly when they
sailed in their own ships, in Norway.
But gradually the seafaring of the
Icelanders declined, as the settlement
fleet wore out. From 1262 Iceland was
under foreign rule, and overseas trade
fell Into foreign hands to remain there
for centuries.
Many reasons have been adduced
for this unfortunate development In Ice¬
landic overseas shipping. But the prin¬
cipal one is believed to lie in the Ice¬
landic production and marketing condi¬
tions of those times. Icelandic pro¬
ducts were lacking in variety, consist¬
ing chiefly of homespun and hides, and
it is known that during the first cen¬
turies after the settlement the demand
for these goods fell off, so that the
trade was no longer profitable. To this
was added the unfavourable location of
the country, voyages to Iceland being
costly as well as risky for the ships
of those days.
Towards the end of the 13th century
the export market for Icelandic goods
began to improve somewhat. Luckily
for the Icelanders a change in European
dietary habits resulted in a greatly
increased demand for fish. They began
to export stockfish, and around the
middle of the 14th century dried fish
and fish oil were being sold on a
large scale in foreign markets. Fish
products thus became the principal
export commodity of the country and
have remained so ever since.
For most of the country's history,
fishing in Iceland has been carried on
In open boats. In all likelihood very
small craft, carrying two or four men,
were always most common, so the na¬
tion has indeed been fortunate in hav¬
ing rich fishing grounds close inshore.
Larger six-oar and eight-oar craft were,
however, to be found already during
the first centuries of settlement.
In 1770 the Icelanders owned 1,870
boats, of which two-oar and four-oar
boats made up about one third each,
while just under one third consisted of
six-oar and eight-oar craft. In propor¬
tion to the population this was quite a
respectable fleet, for it would have
taken twenty per cent of the nation to
man all of it at once.
The first decked fishing boat in Ice¬
land is thought to have been built
about the middle of the 17th century,
but such vessels are not much heard
of until the 19th century. In 1828 their
number had reached 16, by 1876 it had
risen to 38, and by the close of the
century it had passed 100. All of these
first decked boats were sailing vessels.
The first motor boat came to Iceland
just after the turn of the century and
the first trawler In 1905. Trawler fish¬
ing, however, did not begin in earnest
until a few years later, but it has since
played an ever more important role in
the Icelandic fishing industry.
At the beginning of 1973 registered
open motor boats numbered 1,054, with
a total tonnage of 3,313. The 32 traw¬
lers listed in 1973 use trawl fishing
as their principal method, but an addi¬
tional 605 vessels use it to a greater
or lesser extent.
In the 20th century the Icelanders
finally became a seafaring nation
again. At the beginning of 1973 the
Icelandic register listed 77 vessels,
with a total of 63,633 gross registered
tons, for passenger and cargo trans¬
port, oil transport, patrolling and fish¬
eries inspection, rescue work, etc.
Except for oil, virtually all transport of
goods to and from the country is now
in Icelandic hands, as well as all
domestic transport by sea.
As far as Icelandic marine products
are concerned, the most important
commercial species have for a long
time been cod and herring, but other
species of importance include red-fish,
haddock, ocean cat-fish, plaice and
halibut, Norway lobster, shrimp and
scallop.
In the last few years there has been
a large catch of capelin most of which
has been used for fish-meal. Until
about 1910, shark-fishing played a cer¬
tain role in the fishing industry, and
in 1948 whaling was taken up. The
record catch of the Icelandic fishing
fleet for all types of fish was 1,199,100
tons in 1965, compared to 732,800 tons
in 1970.
M OREIGN markets for Ice¬
landic stockfish and fish oil opened up
at the beginning of the 14th century,
and for a long time these products
were the principal export commodities
of the country. In the 18th century
shortlived attempts were made to
utilize natural hot water for salt pro¬
duction. But about the same time the
Icelanders began in increasing measure
to cure saltfish (principally cod) for
export.
After the middle of the 19th century
the sale of saltfish increased rapidly,
and for a long time saltfish was the
chief export of the country. At the
same time the production of stockfish

decreased, but In recent decades it
has again become an Important indus¬
try, due to the opening of a big market
in West Africa.
In 1910 the freezing of fish for
export was begun, but the quantity
produced remained very small for a
long time. In 1950 frozen fish account¬
ed already for about 20 per cent
of the total exports and in 1972 chiefly
cod-type fish amounted to over 70 per
cent of the combined export of frozen
and salted fish products: it has thus
become one of the most important
export products of the country.
With the coming of drift-nets and
purse-nets after the turn of the century,
herring fishing increased and a new
Industry may be said to have been
added to the Icelandic economy. Dur¬
ing the following decades the share
of salted herring in the total exports
of fish products continued to grow,
and in certain years herring has
accounted for more than half of the
total catch, but there have been consi¬
derable periodic fluctuations in the
herring catch.
Although Iceland is a barren coun¬
try, has no forests or mineral resour¬
ces, and is forced to import not only
machinery and other industrial products
but also cereals and most necessities
of life except fish, meat and dairy
products, the Iceland of today ¡s a
welfare state. The per capita national
product amounted to $2,480 during the
period 1966-1970.
30
The reason for this high standard
of living Is above all to be found in
the rich fishing grounds around the
country, and fishing is the Industry on
which the relative affluence of the
country is based. No single nation
. relies as heavily on the sea for its eco¬
nomic prosperity as do the Icelanders.
In the 1930s the share of fish pro¬
ducts in the total value of the national
export passed 90 per cent, and at that
level It was to remain until the last
few years, when the growth of other
export industries has brought it down
to just over 80 per cent'. And as the
share of fish products in the exports
has increased, the total catch has kept
rising, and with it the standard of liv¬
ing of the nation.
Fishing In Icelandic waters is both
difficult and dangerous during the long
and cold winter months on a rough
and stormy ocean. The Icelanders
therefore regard it as a vital necessity
to use only fishing vessels of the
best kind available, equipped with the
most modern fishing gear, navigational
aids, and safety equipment.
The high total catch per fisherman
In Iceland (in 1969 it amounted to
about 143 tons per man) is due not
only to the richness of the fishing
grounds and excellent equipment, but
also to the skill of the Icelandic fisher¬
men and their thorough familiarity with
local conditions in Icelandic waters.
Iceland has two research Institutions
working exclusively In the service of
the fishing industry: the Fisheries
Research Institute and the Marine Re¬
search Institute. The Icelanders began
systematic fisheries studies shortly
after 1930, and activities in this field
have expanded and developed to the
point where they now include most
branches of océanographie research.
Special emphasis has been placed
on studying the physical-chemical con¬
ditions and the systems of currents in
the sea around Iceland and in adjacent
waters. Extensive studies have also
been made of the plant and animal
plankton and the way it is affected by
the chemical and physical factors of
the environment.
The principal subject of these resear¬
ches, however, are the fish stocks
themselves, their nature, their size, and
the effect that fishing has on them.
Recently Icelandic scientists have
turned their attention to pollution and
its effect on the marine fauna, espe¬
cially heavy-metal pollution. The pro¬
tection of the marine environment is
a matter of deep concern to the Ice¬
landers.
For several decades Iceland has par¬
ticipated in International research in
the field of fisheries and oceanography.
Through international organizations,
particularly the U.N. Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization, Icelandic Ichthyolo¬
gists, fishing captains, and technicians
have shared their knowledge and ex¬
perience with other nations.
The rich fishing grounds around Ice¬
land have long been a favourite haunt
of the fishing fleets of various foreign
nations. The continuous intensification
of the fishing has resulted in a severe
reduction of the fish stocks. The death
rate of some species has reached dan¬
gerous levels. This Is particularly true
of cod, where the mortality is at least
70 per cent and the proportion of small
fish in the catch is rising rapidly.
Thus a point had been reached some
time ago where it was clear that the
stocks were seriously overfished and
the productivity of the seas around Ice¬
land gravely endangered. On Septem¬
ber 1, 1972 the Icelandic Government
and the Althing (Parliament) decided to
extend the Icelandic fisheries jurisdic¬
tion to 50 miles. This decision has not
been accepted by all nations and has
been the cause of some tensions and
disputes with certain European fishing
nations.
