BACKSTAGE AT NEW YORK'S
BIGGEST FREE SHOW
by Isabel Mount,
American Museum of Natural History
Some time ago, when a popular
American magazine announced
that it was soon to run a two-
part article called "The Biggest Free
Show in New York", guesses as to its
subject ranged all the way from the
view from one of the city's skyscrap¬
ers to Washington Market at dawn.
Actually the city's "biggest free
show" turned out to be a rambling
collection of Romanesque-style build¬
ings on Manhattan's busy upper
West Side. To the casual eye, accus¬
tomed to the more usual steel-and-
glass facaded attractions with which
New York City abounds, the quiet, ivy-
covered red granite
buildings may have
seemed an odd choice
for first place on the
tourist's itinerary. But
to the two million
people who visit the
American Museum of
Natural History each
year, the choice must
have been a natural one.
For within the
Museum's walls are hous¬
ed the results of more
than eighty-five years of
exploration and research
by leading American
scientists. Fifty - eight
exhibition halls, covering
thirteen and a half acres
of floor space, are filled
with some of the world's
finest collections of birds,
mammals, reptiles, fos¬
sils, minerals and gems,
fishes, insects and eth¬
nological objects. A visi¬
tor can view animals,
minerals or artifacts
from practically every
corner of the globe.
It soon becomes clear
to the discerning sightseer, however,
that there is more to a "show" like
the American Museum than is appa¬
rent on the surface. Attendants are
frequently asked, "'How does all this
come about?" "What goes on 'behind-
the-scenes'?"
There is a great deal more to the
Museum than the average visitor sees,
another twelve acres to be exact. It is
in this "behind-the-scenes" area,
peopled by more than 600 scientists,
technicians, administrators, artists,
craftsmen, attendants and office
workers, that all the American Mu¬
seum's exhibits are planned and
constructed.
The first steps in the development
of a Museum exhibit are sometimes
taken many years before actual
construction is begun. The idea may
originate in a busy laboratory, or it
may germinate thousands of miles
from New York City during one of
the institution's field trips. In either
case research by one of the Museum's
scientists is usually the starting point
for a display designed to share na¬
tural history secrets with the public.
The scientist who is planning an
exhibition must first decide how he
wants to tell the story of his research
and what he wants to include in that
story. Then a synopsis of his ideas is
cleared with the administration, and
a concerted effort is made to ensure
that the new display will make the
greatest possible impact on the many
different people who will see it.
Next in the line of progress of the
exhibit is the Museum's Planning

"behind the scenes" activities in large modern museums. Jobs for the photo¬

Department. Here the scientist dis¬
cusses the subject matter he wishes
to show with architects, artists and
designers. And here basic scientific
theory is translated into visual inter¬
pretations that will interest, amuse
and instruct those two million yearly
visitors. Blueprints are drawn up,
and if necessary, models are made.
More discussions are held. Colour and
lighting are studied and their most
advantageous use debated. Then,
final plans for a new exhibit, com¬
bining modern display techniques with
the most recent advances in scientific
knowledge, are put on paper and
construction of the exhibit is begun.
At this stage, the project is ready
for the hands of those special artists
and craftsmen usually found only in
a Museum of this kind : background
painters, leaf and flower makers,
model builders, sculptors, tanners and
taxidermists. Because many of the
materials shown in the Museum's
famous habitat groups (authentic
recreations of a scene at a particular
site at a specific time of the day)
cannot be preserved, artificial leaves,
flowers, trees, bushes, fruits, berries,
and at times even rocks, must be
made in the Exhibition Department.
Among the most highly specialized
and gifted artists to work on an exhi¬
bit of this sort is the background
painter. It is his job to lead the eye
to believe that the painted objects on
the background are as real as the
actual objects in the foreground. The
curved background on which he works
adds to the feeling of depth, and
perspective and reality,
but requires exceptional
talent for execution.
Using sketches and pho¬
tographs made at the
scene to be reproduced
he must have a natural¬
ist's eye and an artist's
talent with a brush.
When an animal is to
be used in a display
additional problems are
created. The familiar
"stuffed" animals still
found on mantels all
over the world have a
stiffness that destroys a
habitat group's illusion
of reality. So, a different
but far more complicat¬
ed method is used. In
this process, originated
by the late explorer-
sculptor Carl Akeley, and
developed by those who
followed him, a clay
figure reproducing the
animal even to the
detail of its muscle
structure is modeled by
a sculptor. From this
clay model a manikin
with a light, thin shell is made by
several intermediate stages and the
preserved skin is fitted over. The
result is amazingly realistic.
While the Department of Exhibi¬
tion is working on the contents of the
display, the construction personnel of
the Museum are busy building the
structure to house the exhibit. Metal
workers, masons, electricians, carpen¬
ters execute the plans drawn up by
the architects and designers.
Little by little, each man's work
reaches completion and the parts of
an exhibit finally blend into a whole.
Many people have shared in the deve¬
lopment of the idea since the scientist
originally set his thoughts to paper.
Many hands and talents have been
used in its completion. Now the
exhibit is ready for the millions who
will see and be entertained by it, and
who it is hoped will learn a great deal
from it. Now it is ready to teach man
more about the world he lives in.
