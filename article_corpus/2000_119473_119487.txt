The report will provide a new working tool to help pro-
tect the linguistic heritage of humanity. It will comprise rele-
vant and objective information about the status, use and
evolution of the world’s languages.As well as filling an infor-
mation gap, the report has the more ambitious goal of pro-
posing solutions and possible action to further the  rescue
and development of languages in danger of dying out.
The first International
Mother Language Day
http://webworld.unesco.org/imld
At the suggestion of UNESCO member states,the Organi-
zation’s General Conference in November 1999 proclaimed
an Intern ational Mother Language Day, which was marked for
the first time on 21 Fe b ru a ry 2000 by a ceremony at UN E S C O
Headquarters in Paris.
NGOs for 
linguistic pluralism
The defence of languages, their variety and pluralism is
winning increasingly wide international support,especially
through the work of non-governmental organizations. Below, a
sample of activities in this field.

Te rr a l i n g u a ,a nongove rnmental organization set up in 1996,
b e l i e ves that preservation of the physical and the intangible heri-
tage of humanity are two sides of the same coin, because their
fates are intertwined and they are threatened by the same socio-
economic fa c t o rs.E ve rything that is done to protect the lands,
languages and cultures of indigenous peoples is vital for safe-
guarding the planet’s dive rs i t y, because although these people
c o m p rise only five per cent of the wo r l d ’s population they speak
57 per cent of its languages and inhabit regions where biologi-
cal dive rsity is gr e at e s t .
The Terralingua website, which has a wealth of informa-
tion and links to other organizations with the same goals, is
open to all kinds of contributions, from proverbs and poems
in any language to money donations to the Endangered Lan-
guage Fund,whose watchword is “When a language is gone,
it is gone forever”.

UN E S C O’s work in the field of languages began to take off in
the mid-1980s. A key step was the launch of the Linguapax pro-
ject in 1986.This was designed “to associate the teaching of lan-
guages with the promotion of intern ational understanding and
p e a c e ,” s ays Félix Mart i , head of UN E S C O’s A d v i s o ry Committee
for Linguistic Pluralism and Multilingual Educat i o n , which wa s
set up in 1998.
In the last 15 years, Linguapax has provided technical
back-up for a number of national and regional projects, inclu-
ding the rebuilding of Cambodia’s educational system around
the Khmer language. This involved producing two million
school textbooks in Khmer and training a team of Cambodian
teachers and editors. Linguapax has also set up an inter-uni-
ve rsity network co-ordinated by the Unive rsity of Mons
(Belgium) to promote the project and its methods, and is wor-
king on a report on the world’s languages (see below).
Protecting linguistic diversity and encouraging multilingual
education are two closely-related goals. To promote the for-
mer, Linguapax has put together guides and manuals for tea-
chers and policy-makers in countries, especially in Africa, that
want to incorporate local languages into their education sys-
tem. A new project, called Pericles, will promote the learning
of neighbouring languages by encouraging young people from
adjacent countries to work together to preserve shared natural
and cultural heritage sites. A project currently at an experi-
mental stage in the border region where Luxemburg, France
and Germany meet is designed to be applied internationally
wherever there is a desire to boost regional co-operation or in
areas recovering from wars.
There is international awareness about the need to protect
the non-tangible heritage of humanity such as languages but
there is no legal instrument to back it up. “Unfortunately the-
re’s no international agreement referring specifically to linguis-
tic rights,” says Marti.“It’s a very sensitive subject, but it is up
to UNESCO to draft an international instrument to protect
them which could be adopted by most countries.”
Report on 
the Wo r l d ’s Languages
“ W h at is the name of your language? Is it used in written form ?
Where is it spoken? What are its geographical frontiers?”These
and many other questions feature in a UNESCO world language
s u rvey begun in 1997.The answe rs to them, along with input from
research institutes, specialists and bibliographical sources, will go
into the first edition of a UN E S C O R e p o rt on the Wo rl d ’s Language s,
to be published in 2001.

ration of linguistic rights,including the right to be
taught and to communicate with official bodies in
the language of one’s community.
Surfing on
a sea of languages 
A mass of information about languages can be
found on the Intern e t , which is increasingly used as
a working tool by students, t r a n s l at o rs and tea-
c h e rs. They can find sites from which they can
download for free the characters of currently used
alphabets, such as Cyrillic, Mandarin or Hebrew,
alphabets that have died out, such as Egyptian hie-
r o g l y p h i c s , and even invented languages such as
t h at created by J. R . R .To l k i e n , author of the epic tri-
logy The Lord of the Rings, not to mention sites offe-
ring exercises in English or Spanish.
S u r f e rs can also access the terminology dat a b a s e
of the European Union’s translation serv i c e .T i t l e d
Eurodicautom, it is a kind of super-dictionary with
more than 5.5 million entries in 12 European lan-
guages.
But in the battle for multilingualism, the Intern e t
is a double-edged swo r d , since most of its contents
are only in English. The 1999-2000 edition of
UN E S C O’s Wo rld Communication and Info rm at i o n
Report quotes from surveys done by the Internet
Society and by Euromarketing to the effect that
58% of Internet users are English-speakers. After
them, far behind, come those who speak Spanish
( 8 . 7 % ) , G e rman (8.6%), Japanese (7.9%) and
French (3.7%).
In terms of the number of web pages, the domi-
n ation of English is even gr e at e r — at 81%, f o l l owe d
by German (4%), Japanese,French and the Scan-
dinavian languages (2% each) and Spanish (1%).
The wo r l d ’s other languages account for barely 8%
of the Net’s web pages.
