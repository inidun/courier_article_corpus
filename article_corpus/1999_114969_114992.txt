nHeinz Bonni (above) is a bit of a
l o u d m o u t h . “I don’t suffer fools gladly,”
he declares,“and I always say what I think.”
Sometimes he goes even further and uses his
fis t s.A few months ago, he was up in court
for assault. He got a two-year suspended
p rison sentence and a $240 fine. T h at ’s
when he realized he could “count on B i s s” —
the paper paid his fine.
B i s s is short for “Burger in sozialen
S c h w i e ri g k e i t e n ”(“Citizens in Diffic u l t y ” ) .I t ’s
also the name of Munich’s monthly street
m a g a z i n e .The first publication of its kind in
G e rm a ny, B i s s was launched in 1993 by a
group of radical journalists and militant
e va n g e l i c a l s.To d ay, 460 homeless or once-
homeless people have permits to sell the
p a p e r , which cove rs the social crisis and the
problems of marginalized people. They can
sell up to 600 papers a month without losing
their social security pay m e n t s.
Bonni, aged 60, is one of 110 vendors
considered “ r e g u l a rs ” . After a string of
mishaps and occupational diffic u l t i e s , h e
lost his apartment, his job and finally his
emotional stability. He is not your ideal
homeless pers o n , carefully saving money
so as to get back into society. He smells of
d rink as he complains about the other
vendors. But he’s proud to be working for
an “established” magazine, as he calls it.
“Everyone’s heard of Biss,” he says.
It wa s n ’t easy for B i s s to get this fa r. A t
firs t , the team of vo l u n t e e rs was ove r w h e l m e d .
S ome people had their hand in the till,
which was pretty empty any way. T h e
magazine was sinking when 50-ye a r - o l d
Hildegard Denninger, an accountant by
t r a i n i n g, took over in May 1994,
reorganizing it and making better use of
the sales revenue. Now Biss prints 40,000
copies of each issue, has about $150,000 in
the kitty and gets subsidies from the city
council and donations from elsewhere.
Things are going well—a bit too we l l ,
according to some people, who think social
action should not get mixed up with
c o m m e r c e . The magazine, which is put
together by professional journ a l i s t s , is also
c riticized for not giving enough space to what
homeless people themselves think. If they
want to express their views, the homeless can
join a weekly “ w riting wo r k s h o p ”and publish
a rticles in a special section of the magazine.
“It would be naive to think that our
ve n d o rs can turn out we l l - w ritten and
researched articles when most of the
‘ n o rm a l ’p o p u l ation can’t ,” s ays Denninger,
who thinks there’s no altern at i ve to bri n gi n g
out a quality product.
Loyal readers
“I get blamed for being only interested in
m o n e y,” she say s. But how to surv i ve without
it? The homeless earn the equivalent of 80 US
cents for each copy they sell and B i s s h e l p s
t h e m , among other things, to pay off any
debts they have . It also gi ves them a bonus
when they manage to get an apartment and
s u p p o rts them when they tangle with the law.
The magazine has also been able to form a l l y
hire its six best ve n d o rs—those who sell more
than 1,200 copies a month.
Some readers and even some vendors
complain that the magazine devotes too
much space to foreigners in difficulty when
there are so many “ r e a l ”G e rman homeless.
But the readership is pretty loya l . T h e
magazine became well known partly thanks
to a big publicity campaign in 1996 donat e d
by a leading Munich advertising agency. It
i nvo l ved showing top footballer Jürgen
Klinsmann and the city’s mayo r ,C h ri s t i a n
Ude, both disguised as homeless vendors.
E ve ryone seems to get something out of it.
B u t , as Denninger admits, the magazine only
enables a tiny minority of the homeless to fin d
a job and really get a foothold in society. n
