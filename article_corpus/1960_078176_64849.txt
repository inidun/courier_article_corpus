An inquiry carried out among
71 countries by the Internation¬
al Bureau of Education leads
to the conservative estimate that at
least four per cent of the world's chil¬
dren are (mentally handicapped. In
the relatively few countries where
statistics exist the figures are stagger¬
ing almost a million in Japan, over
250,000 in France (or nearly five per
cent of the school age population),
six per cent in Uruguay, four per cent
in Peru, two per cent in Yugoslavia
and Poland.
Most of these millions of unfor¬
tunate children are potentially educ¬
able, but unless they receive special
education they will become a burden
on society, sometimes useless and
often dangerous tragic misfits who
constitute a problem for their families
and communities.
Yet today, in the middle of the 20th
century, special education for the
mentally handicapped is reserved for
a privileged minority and hundreds of
thousands of potentially useful citi¬
zens are lost to themselves and to the
world.
It was to focus attention on then-
plight that the International
Conference on Public Education,
organized by Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Bureau of Education, meeting
in Geneva last summer, chose as a
major discussion theme the organiza¬
tion of special education for mentally
deficient children. The basis for its
discussions was the world-wide in¬
quiry mentioned above. This com¬
parative study, however, was not
concerned with the whole problem of
mentally deficient children, but was
confined to those considered as "educ¬
able" or "recoverable."
"So long as a child can be taught
to read, he can be made into a useful
member of society," Mr. César San¬
telli, of France, told delegates from
77 countries at the Geneva Confer¬
ence. "But the problem of special
education for mentally deficient
22
children is one which is always being
put aside in favour of seemingly more
urgent ones," he added.
Obviously, said Mr. Santelli, coun¬
tries grappling with the problem of
stamping out illiteracy among their
"intelligent" population and putting
them all in school have little time for
dealing systematically with their
mentally handicapped. Even the ad¬
vanced countries where illiteracy is
no longer a problem lack sufficient
specialized institutions and qualified
teachers to deal with the difficult
cases.
In only a dozen countries of the
71 covered by the inquiry does educa¬
tional legislation stipulate that spe¬
cial education it to be organized and
that it is obligatory for mentally
deficient children to receive instruc¬
tion. In a further 12 countries, men¬
tally deficient children are 'liable for
compulsory schooling in the same way
as other children.
Where special institutions do not
exist, educable mentally deficient
children must usually attend the
ordinary school. But when classes
are already overcrowded, it is pratic-
ally impossible for the teacher to give
enough time to the mentally deficient,
who more than any other children,
need direct contact and individual
attention. They are inevitably neg¬
lected, waste their time, often disturb
their fellows, have to repeat the class
and when they reach school leaving
age, they depart without having
learned anything much.
If it is easy to pick out immediate¬
ly children who are seriously sub¬
normal cases of idiocy or imbecility
the educable mentally deficient
child is at first sight more difficult to
identify. Cases of slight deficiency
are often confused with slow learners,
whose intelligence may be developed,
whereas the mentally deficient suffer
from a lesion of the brain which may
be more or less serious, but which is
unfortunately incurable.
It is important therefore to detect
such children at an early age. Psy¬
chological and IQ tests combined with
medical examinations and enquiries
into family environment enable
mental deficiency to be diagnosed
and thus save the time of teacher
and class as well as giving the child
himself a chance to improve with
special education.
When once it has been established
that the child is mentally handi¬
capped rather than backward or
lazy, practical teaching based on
manual work, games and exercises
will help him to co-ordinate his
movements and to gain self con¬
fidence one of the prime require¬
ments for a normal life. Group acti¬
vities and teamwork help the child to
adjust to society and learn to live
with others; memory, suitably train¬
ed, will often help him to compensate
for lack of intelligence.
U I t has often been noted that
I there is a relationship between
delinquency and mental defi¬
ciency," 'Mr. Santelli told the Geneva
Conference. "This makes it all the
more important to give these children
a sound moral training, and also to
equip them with the means of earn¬
ing a living. They should be guided
towards jobs they can do and em¬
ployers should be discreetly convinced
that mental deficients can often carry
out certain work more conscientiously
than their more gifted brothers. A
list of specially suitable trades and
jobs in industry should be drawn up
on the basis of experiments and an
attempt made to keep these jobs open
for them."
Apart from the shortage of money,
qualified, teachers and special schools,
one of the main obstacles in the way
of the mentally deficient is their own
parents. They are often unwilling to
admit their children are unlike others
and they have to be taught to over¬
come their pride and to understand
that with proper education their chil¬
dren can be made useful members of
society.
