Too valuable 
for price-tags
◗ Sophie Boukhari
Why should biological diversity be protected? Scientists are putting 
forth many new answers : some to convince the public and decision-make rs 
and others they consider scientifically valid 
Eve ry week it seems, b i o l o gi s t s , a n t h r o p o l o gists or
e nvironmental scientists publish studies with a new
reason explaining why it is vital to slow down the
depletion of biodive rs i t y. For example, in early March
t wo A m e rican scholars , James Kirchner and Anne We l l ,
wrote in the British review N at u r e t h at , after an era of
mass extinction, it took nature much longer than anyo n e
had previously thought to reach its current level of ri c h-
ness and dive rs i t y.
If humans continue destroying wild habitats at the
c u rrent pace, not only will we cause a major new crisis in
the history of life, it will take nature at least 10 million
ye a rs to recove r.T h at stunning argument bemuses some
s c i e n t i s t s , who say that in just five million ye a rs , H o m o
s a p i e n s and the other large ve rt e b r ates will have gone the
way of the dinosaurs. So why care about what happens
after that? 
“The question is not what will happen to tigers 10
million ye a rs from now,” s ays Michel Bat i s s e ,who hel-
ped set up UNESCO’s biosphere reserves and is on the
board of directors of the non-governmental organiza-
tion Conservation Intern at i o n a l . “ T h e r e ’s no doubt
they will no longer exist. But what about 100 ye a rs
from now? W h at we need is to find good reasons to
protect biodiversity in the next few centuries.”
The tempestuous debate over the “ va l u e ” of biodi-
ve rsity is sometimes skewed by the need to convince at
any price. Genuinely alarmed about the scope of the
destruction,some experts have taken up “ideological”
positions, says Talal Younes, executive director of the
I n t e rn ational Union of Biological Sciences. “ T h e y
think any argument that can help put the message
across is good,whether or not it is scientifically valid.”
The values most commonly invoked to raise public
awareness are economic and aesthetic. “The Western
public pictures biodiversity like Noah’s ark, with the
giraffe and the sequoia,the parrot and the tulip,” says
Batisse. In the industrialized countries,where wilder-
ness has become a rare, h i g h l y - p rized commodity,
people are willing to take action so that their gr a n d-
children will have the chance to see elephants roa-
ming free.
But Peter Bri d g e wat e r , director of UN E S C O’s eco-
l o gical sciences division, thinks biodive rs i t y ’s aes-
thetic value is relat i ve .“ People living in cities in New
Z e a l a n d , for example, think that whales are in gr e at
danger and should be protected from hunters. B u t
Inuit in Alaska will tell you that whales are an impor-
tant part of their diet and that they should be allowe d
to sustainably hunt whales.Who is right? ”
A gene pool
for biotechnology
The aesthetic argument works with a cert a i n
segment of the general public, but it falls short of
c o nvincing decision-makers.“When ministers hold
a meeting, you have to demonstrate the economic
a d vantages of preserving biodive rs i t y,” s ays Bat i s s e .
T h at task is all the harder because gove rn m e n t s
sometimes deri ve tremendous economic benefit
from the destruction of ecosystems, e s p e c i a l l y
forests,and they are under pressure from powerful
lobbies (the timber and paper industri e s , f o r
example). Researchers reply that biodiversity is a
boon for the tourism industry (see pp. 3 1 - 3 2 ) ,h e l p s
to cure illnesses (pp.30-31) and to feed people at
little cost (pp.27-29) and constitutes an inestimable
gene pool for biotechnology.
In the past several ye a rs , scientists have also
come up with a battery of figures aimed at putting
a monetary value on the services ecosystems pro-
vide for human societies (see pp. 2 6 - 2 7 ) .A group of
A m e rican scholars estimates their wo rth at $319
billion a year in the United States (5 per cent of the
U.S.GDP),and nearly three trillion dollars a year
wo r l d w i d e . The leading ecological economist,
R o b e rt Costanza, has published other estimat e s
assessing the total value of services rendered by
biodiversity at $33 trillion a year—more than the
GDP of all the world’s countries combined.◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
2 S c i e n t i fic truths

While these figures might hit home, m a ny scien-
tists consider them to be totally off the mark. Peter
B ri d g e water goes even furt h e r , arguing that the
attempt to put price-tags is not only a “ waste of
time” but dangerous. “The economically-minded
people are setting up a system of discri m i n ation by
c o n s i d e ring some species and ecosystems to be
valuable (because they provide ‘ p r o fit a b l e ’s e rv i c e s )
and deeming others worthless. Ecological systems
are not built-up on the basis of discrimination but
c o - o p e r at i o n .They must be considered as a whole.”
B ri d g e water says biodive rsity is too valuable to be
e va l u at e d . It is priceless because it guarantees the secu-
rity of the human race. It would be idiotic,he say s ,t o
d e s t r oy ecosystems which make air breat h a b l e , the cli-
m ate tolerable,water drinkable and soil fertile (see pp.
2 6 - 2 7 ) .To those who argue that technological pro-
gress will offset environmental damage,he retorts that
the costs would be exorbitant.And technological solu-
t i o n s , he adds,will not hold up in the long run because,
unlike nat u r e , they will be incapable of adapting to
c h a n g e .W h at ’s more, adds Jeffrey McNeelly, of the
World Conservation Union, the most advanced tech-
n o l o gies are based on mechanisms observed in living
things—an additional reason to take care of them. I n s-
tead of pitting nature and technology against one ano-
t h e r ,b i o d i ve rsity specialists are counting on an alliance
b e t ween them to better manage the environment and
to develop ecological engi n e e ring (which would make
it possible, for example, to restore the functions of a
d e graded tropical forest).
Last but not least, they say, i n s t rumentalist argu-
ments pale in comparison to the only one that really
m at t e rs : b i o d i ve rsity is the essence of life. “ W h at is
l i f e ,when you get down to it?”asks Robert Barbault,
director of the French Institute of Basic and A p p l i e d
E c o l o g y. “It is what lasts. And it lasts because it
adapts to changes in the environment by dive rs i-
f y i n g . A host of species has continued demonstra-
ting this for over four billion ye a rs. Humans are no
d i f f e r e n t , e ven though they are more sophisticat e d .
They face the same problems: e at or be eat e n . P r e-
d at o rs try to kill as much prey as possible and prey
t ries to escape from predat o rs.T h at leads to co-evo-
lution based on genetic and behavioural va ri a b i l i t y.
I t ’s a race that never ends,” s ays Barbault.“ D i ve rs i t y
is the ve ry reason for the success of  living pheno-
m e n a , and therefore for our own existence.” But if
living things have always adapted, w hy wo rry now ?
Most specialists are cat e g o ri c a l : to regenerat e , l i f e
needs time and space, t wo things it no longer has
because of the pace and scope of the damage caused
by people.
Becoming aware
of our interdependence
Because of its biological and technological pro-
gr e s s , Homo sapiens are jeopardizing their own we l-
fa r e .The present environmental cri s i s ,s ays Robert
Barbault,has the advantage of helping to raise the
We s t e rn individual’s awareness of our connections
with nature,which has long been considered as an
e x t e rnal entity to be tamed. “ We ’re beginning to
understand that our planet must be managed and,
c o n s e q u e n t l y, to think about the new civilizat i o n
we want to build.The ability to conceive a project
is precisely what sets us apart from other species.We
will have to change our behaviour, especially diet
and technology, and our mentalities.We must have
a different, more ecological vision of the world and
be more aware of our interdependence with all
other living things.” And perhaps, a touch more
humble. ■
