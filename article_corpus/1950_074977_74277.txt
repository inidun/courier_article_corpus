UNESCO REPORTS ON ONE YEAR'S RECONSTRUCTION
"It takes great courage to-day merely to go onliving, for you and I are not the only ones who
have lost hope : all men to-day are lonely and
crushed by despair and no one is able to lend them
a helping hand. One of the consequences of the war
is that despair and loneliness have taken possession
of everyone, and none can look for support to
others..."
THIS was how an Italian,Giuseppe Berto, described
in a book the post-war
sufferings of his country's
children and adolescents. But
though there are many who
still view life as darkly as this,
there is evidence in the world
that man's solitude is not ab-
solute and that his despair is
not necessarily justified. For
to counteract loneliness and
despair there are men and
organizations willing to help.
The existence of Unesco
itself is an important proof of
this and the practical work it
has been able to do for relief
and reconstruction has already
encouraged efforts by men of
goodwill in all parts of the
world.
Since its inception, Unesco
has been setting an example
to other organizations by
putting aside from its own
limited budget sums of money
for its Emergency Aid Fund.
Last year it used 175, 000 dollars
to meet the most urgent needs
in educational reconstruction,
and this money was distribut-
ed as shown in the table
below.
An additional sum of 23. 000
dollars was allocated to the
refugees in the Middle East
from a special supplementary
fund.
Two Appeals to
world's Conscience
WHEN handing over 10, 850dollars to help the re-
construction of Greek
schools, Dr. Carneiro, Unesco's
representative, indicated that
the act was a symbolic one.
Though this money could do
little to slleviate the over-
whelming needs of Greece, his
gesture drew the attention of
the world to the appalling
conditions endured by 340, 000
Greek refugee children driven
from their homes by war. A
booklet,"A Child Named Ma-
rika", published by Unesco
and describing these children's
existence was part of the
campaign Unesco launched
with an appeal to all its mem-
bers at its General Conference
last September.
An appeal for refugee chil-
dren in the Middle East was
also made by the Conference.
Important practical results
have already been achieved by
Unesco's work in this area.
Of the 200, 000 refugee children
in the Middle East, 21, 000 are
now attending 39 schools or-
ganized with Unesco's assist-
ance in the Lebanon, Syria.
Transjordan and Palestine.
But it was not enough to esta-
blish schools, find teachers and
furnish essential school equip-
ment ; the schools had also to
be given a chance of survival
Most of them are housed in
tents, and some in the open
air.
Winters are severe in the
Lebanese mountains and.
unless funds can be raised tv
build proper schools, protect
and improve existing ones.
and generally carry on the
work initiated by Unesco, the
effort will have been in vain,
for the children will be forced
to abandon their schools.
To back up its appeal Unes-
co has just published a
pamphlet"Schoolbell In The
Wilderness", describing both
the initial results achieved
and calling for help to meet
the enormous needs that still
remain.
Where. The Money goes
As well as providing emer-gency relief from its own
budget, Unesco has dis-
tributed money received from
private organizations which
has gone to help the recon-
struction of educational sys-
tems in war devastated coun-
tries.
f70, 000 sent by the Lord Mayor
pf London's Fund has been dis-
tributed to the following coun-
tries : Austria (7%), Czechoslova-
kla (8%), Greece (16%), Hungary
(6%), Italy (12%), Poland (16%)
and the British, colonies and
Malta (25%). Ten per cent of
; his sum was used in transport
and transfer charges, [ea vlng
£10.000, of which £1.800 went to
t22. 900 which wUl be sent to
Italy, Greece. Finland and Middle
East countries for the purchase
in replacing scientific equipment
In raising and distributing
these funds. Unesco has been
greatly helped by TICER
(Temporary International
Committee for Educational
Reconstruction). This organi-
zation, which Unesco helped
to establish, comprises all the
principal private organizations
working for educational re-
construction.
International voluntary work
camps, where young people of
many nationalities work side
by side on urgent reconstruc-
tion jobs, constitute one of the
most effective means of de-
veloping international under-
standing.
In addition to supplying
camp libraries, Unesco last
year sent representatives to
see what was going on in the
39 camps organized in 12 Eu-
ropean countries.
How Youth Lends A Hund
FOURTEEN were helping tobuild houses, schools or
children's villages ; eleven

British colonies and £8.200 to
Middle East refugees.
All this money was spent either
In replacing scientific equipment
or to buy material such as gra-
mophones. records, maps and
books.
In addition M. 500 raised by the
New York Reconstruction Fund
was used to buy or reconstruct
film projection apparatus in Aus-
atria, Poland, Greece, Czechoslo-
vakia, Hungary. Italy, the Philip-
pines and Iran. Among other
gifts distributed by Unesco was
a sum of M10 raised by the Union
of South Africa.
Norway raised £10, 500, £10, 000 of
which has already been distribu-
ted to Middle East refugees for
the organization of their winter
schools, and Belgium provided
were preparing sports grounds
youth centres and youth
hostels ; nine were doing agri-
cultural work ; two were re-
pairing roads or des ; two
were carrying out archaeologi-
cal excavation and one was
doing social service work.
One important part of
Unesco's Reconstruction work
is aimed at helping children's
communities-through the
raising of funds, public appeals
on their behalf, and by organ-
izing such meetings as last
October's Conference at Char-
leroi in collaboration with the
International Federation of
Children's Communities.
