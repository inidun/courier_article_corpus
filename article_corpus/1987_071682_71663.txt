An open book
by Igor Petryanov-Sokolov
A Soviet recipe for promoting the reading habit
THE chief purpose of the Book-
lovers' Society of the USSR is to
encourage the greatest possible
number of people to become interested in
books, and particularly to develop a taste
for reading among children and
teenagers, whose attention tends to be
monopolized by television, the cinema
and video. For the book and the screen
are not interchangeable. The cinema dis¬
penses readymade impressions, whereas
reading demands an intensive effort of
thought and imagination which has con¬
siderable formative value.
Seventeen million booklovers of every
Soviet nationality, age and occupation
are members of the Society, which is
active in the fifteen federal republics, in
the autonomous republics, the territor¬
ies, the regions, and in over 4,000 cities,
towns and districts. It has 194,000 cells in
enterprises, factories, construction sites,
agricultural co-operatives and schools.
Its role is to become a genuine instru¬
ment of exchange and dialogue between
cultures through helping all kinds of
people to get to know the treasures of
Soviet and other literatures.
The Society engages in a wide range of
activities including the organization of
exhibitions, literary debates, book festi¬
vals, theatrical and musical perform¬
ances, and meetings with writers. By
these means it seeks to develop a taste for
reading and an interest in contemporary
literature.
Collaboration with libraries has always
been an essential part of the Society's
work. The specialists who serve on the
Society's management committees help
libraries to build up their collections and
inform young people in workers' hostels,
factories, schools and other institutions
about the existence of such library
facilities.
As a contribution to the United Na¬
tions International Youth Year (1985), a
children's art competition was held on the
theme of "pages from favourite books",
and book weeks were organized for chil¬
dren and teenagers.
A regular feature of the Society's acti-

vities are the annual festivals for young
readers organized by local branches in
each republic in collaboration with youth
libraries. Examples include a major chil¬
dren's book festival in Lithuania, a festi¬
val organized by the school sections of the
Booklovers' Society of Armenia, a
Young Booklover's Rally in Azerbaijan,
and the Schools Literary Festival in the
Russian SFSR. A Booklovers' Day and
Book Festival held in Moscow in 1985
were a great success.
It is not unusual for booklovers to give
practical expressions of solidarity with
readers in other republics. Ukrainian
readers organized a collection of books
for libraries in Gazli, a town in Uzbeki¬
stan which was destroyed in an earth¬
quake. Libraries in Tajikistan, which also
suffered in the earthquake, similarly re¬
ceived gifts of books.
The Society also acts as a link between
authors, publishers, distributors and
bookbuyers. Travelling libraries on boats
or in buses go all over the country, taking
collections of the latest books to isolated
communities. One specially equipped
"bibliobus" for readers in the town of
Neriungri in Yakutia caters for a nearby
coalmine, a prefabricated material fac¬
tory and building sites. In the Ashkabad
region (Turkmen SSR) booklovers have
set up small libraries on ships and air¬
liners. They also send books to day-
schools and boarding schools, hospitals,
village libraries and the sites of major
public works projects. The delivery of
parcels of books to construction workers
on the second Trans-Siberian railway was
given top priority.
Most booklovers' circles also try to
meet the ever greater demand from
young factory executives for scientific
and technical literature dealing with their
branch of activity. Young readers are also
interested in book preservation and res¬
toration in a single year, 500,000
volumes were restored in more than 400
bookbinding clubs in schools in the Cher¬
kassy region (Ukrainian SSR). Many
clubs draw on the teaching resources of
museums, and are introducing a growing
number of young workers, kolkhoz mem¬
bers, students and schoolchildren to liter¬
ature, art, history and the sciences. One
example of this trend is the literary and
musical circle accommodated in the for¬
mer home, now a museum, of the novelist

SFSR).
The Society publishes bibliographical
works, literary criticism, biographies of
famous bibliophiles and collectors, and
descriptions of great libraries. It pub¬
lishes more than 300 titles a year, mainly
literary works and art books, with a print
run of over a million copies.
The Society has contributed to the
erection of monuments to great writers
and to the creation of book museums and
book centres in localities which have no
public library. It has, for example, helped
to restore the monument to Nikolai
Gogol at Poltava in the Ukrainian SSR,
and to the opening of the Mikhail
Lermontov Museum at Taman, in the
Caucasus.
The Society's central directorate estab¬
lishes and maintains close contacts with
similar associations in the other Socialist
countries and in capitalist countries
which have cultural relations with the
USSR. International meetings and co¬
operation and exchange agreements in
the fields of books and publishing contri¬
bute to the enrichment of knowledge, the
spread of humanitarian ideals and the
strengthening of friendship between
peoples.
IGOR PETRYANOV-SOKOLOV is president of
