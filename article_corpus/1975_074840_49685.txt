Modern graphic artists of New Guinea
On this double page we present six
etchings executed by contemporary
artists of New Guinea taught and
guided by Rolf Italiaander, a Dutch
writer and ethnologist whose travels
throughout the world have inspired
him to study the relationship between
traditional folk culture and modern art.
In 1972 In New Guinea he repeated
an experiment he had carried out in
1953 in Poto Poto, near Brazzaville
(Congo), where he taught the tech¬
niques of dry point etching to
Congolese artists who produced 82
remarkable etchings, today In the
Museum of Modern Art, in Paris.
Rolf Italiaander's experiments in
New Guinea took place in Lae, a big
port on the island's east coast, In

Goroka in the highlands, and in
villages of the Sepik region, where he
encouraged local artists to acquire
the skills of copperplate engraving.
The artists quickly mastered this tech¬
nique, which was absolutely new to
them. "When I told them they could
first make a design in pencil If they
wished," says Italiaander, "most of
them refused, saying that they knew in
advance exactly what they were going
to do." The 41 etchings made by
these artists reveal their profound
awareness of their cultural identity;
they depict the world around them
animals, flowers, dwellings, their way
of life, customs using a distinctive
symbolism and a style which, while
retaining its links with tradition,

displays vitality and originality. The
subjects of the etchings show how the
artists have remained rooted in their
traditional world: "Wabag house of
the Enga people", "My forefather the
cannibal", "What a young man must
give to his bride", "Fabulous animals",
etc. Many of the artists gave written
explanations of their works, but the
etchings provide such a rich and vivid
picture of life that they speak for
themselves.
