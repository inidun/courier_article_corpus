In the heart of Ecuador’s rain forest, f o rt y - five
minutes by foot away from their own village, a
small group of Huaorani, an Amazon indigenous
p e o p l e , built a palm-thatched roof cabin for eight.
Fe a ring that too much tourism could disrupt their tra-
ditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle and bring in unwe l-
come consumer habits, the Huaorani only accept one
group of visitors per month, for two to six day s.
But during this time, they are gi ven full at t e n t i o n .
Community representat i ves greet visitors upon their
a rri val and discuss some of their people’s social and
e nvironmental concern s. D u ring this first meeting,
a per-night fee is paid to the head of the community
for each visitor and the money is distri buted eve n l y
among all the fa m i l i e s. S a l a ries for the va rious jobs
( g u i d e s , m a i n t e n a n c e , canoe paddlers etc) are cal-
c u l ated by doubling what a person would earn as a
labourer for an oil company, the main altern at i ve
source of income.Huaorani guides accompany visi-
t o rs on hikes and teach them about medicinal plants,
the rainforest’s ecology, their spiritual relationship with
the env i r o n m e n t , and local handicrafts.At the end of
their tri p,v i s i t o rs are invited to raise awareness in their
own countries about the Huaorani’s efforts to defend
their land and culture.This initiat i ve has led to dona-
tions that have financed training wo r k s h o p s , h i g h
f r e q u e n cy radios and solar panels.

F rom Ecuador to Namibia, indigenous communities are striking up innovative partners h i p s
with tour opera t o rs to promote ecotourism on their own terms—a strategy to bring in
revenue and protect their culture and enviro n m e n t
in a region prone to outside encroachment—from
unscrupulous jungle tour operators to petroleum
companies—managed to set up a project that won
a prize for the best ecotourism programme at the
1998 Berlin To u rism Expo is not a product of
c h a n c e . It took nine months of planning and ori e n-
t ation meetings for the Huaorani to finetune a tou-
rism strategy, a task carried out hand in hand with
TROPIC Ecological Adventures, a tour operator
with a long experience in working with indigenous
communities, notably on bringing the Huaorani’s
problems with the oil industry to intern at i o n a l
at t e n t i o n . Not only has this community defined its
own rules for tourism, but it has gained indispen-
sable exposure on the international travel market
through a fruitful business partnership.
A strong 
conservationist slant
Just as import a n t l y, the Huaorani have opted for
a self-managed community-based activity that repre-
sents a potential economic altern at i ve to oil and log-
gi n g .M a ny indigenous communities see ecotouri s m
as the most rational way of protecting the rainforest,
c r e ating jobs for the young and generating reve n u e
for educat i o n , community health and transport at i o n .
They also see it as a way of maintaining their cultural
i n t e gri t y. Ecuador is a ve ritable laborat o ry for com-
munity-based ecotouri s m , with some env i r o n m e n-
talists contending that revenues earned from touri s m
in the Amazon rainforest could eventually outstri p
oil earnings.
The Cofan indigenous people have developed a
fairly sophisticated management system in Zabalo,
under the guidance of Randy Borm a n , the son of an
A m e rican missionary who grew up with the Cofa n
and has played a leading role in resisting the effort s
of oil companies to prospect on their terri t o ry. I n
1 9 9 2 , B o rman established a community-run com-
p a ny in Zabalo with ten Cofan associates who
i nvested their labour in building guest cabins. O t h e r
community members are paid for doing va rious jobs
while a small co-operat i ve craft store also brings in
i n c o m e .These va rious initiat i ves provide the Cofa n
of Zabalo with an estimated $500 annually per
p e rs o n .The project also has a strong conservat i o n i s t
s l a n t : the community has defined separate zones for
hunting and ecotouri s m , with fines levied on

m e m b e rs for taking certain species such as toucans
and parrots (particularly coveted by touri s t s ) , or for
exceeding quotas in the hunting zones.
Besides the need for a close relationship with a
p a rtner who has a sound knowledge of the trave l
market and a sensitivity toward indigenous com-
m u n i t i e s , such projects need at least five ye a rs before
they can become commercially viable.Training is the
backbone of any succcessful enterp ri s e .E ven though
these trips are no-frills experi e n c e s , some basic
notions such as punctuality and hy giene in food pre-
p a r ation have to be understood by the community.
Just as import a n t , if a real exchange is to happen
d u ring the tri p, guides have to know how to speak to
v i s i t o rs about their lifestyle and natural surr o u n-
d i n g s , and realize that they may have to slow dow n
their pace when leading hikes along rainforest trails.
All this requires dialogue and a community that is
united around a respected leader. Although NGOs
h ave also assisted communities in developing touri s m
p r o j e c t s , e x p e rience shows that they often lack
contacts on the travel market to make these initiat i ve s
v i a b l e .
‘Unlike oil,
tourism is sustainable’
Other countries and continents are also boosting
their presence on this niche market which is at t r a c-
ting more and more North A m e rican and European
t r ave l l e rs. Take the case of Ve n e z u e l a . H e r e , o n e
indigenous group, the Pemons, does not flinch at
accepting 100 tourists a day who fly in from a beach
resort on Margarita Island to visit Salto Angel,the
wo r l d ’s highest wat e r fa l l , in the southeast of the
c o u n t ry. Besides accompanying visitors to the fa l l s
and serving them a meal, the Pemons have also
built a village (an hour by road away from their ow n )
of ten traditional cabins for ove rnight gr o u p s.To u-
rism revenue (the Pemons receive about $25 per day
per visitor, the total package costing $70) has serve d
to set up a school and a health dispensary and
make up for declining state subsidies. A n o t h e r
gr o u p, the Ye ’ Ku a n a s , won rights from the gove rn-
ment to manage land-use of a forest reserve . Pa rt of
it, beyond a natural barrier formed by a waterfall
over the Caura ri ve r , is off limits to visitors , while in
a n o t h e r , they have built guest cabins and deve-
loped itineraries for tourists in part n e rship with
Natura Raid,an operator based in Caracas.
As awareness of environmental issues has spread
over the past decade,a growing number of travel-
lers are looking into how the adventure/discovery-
style trips they choose benefit communities. In res-
ponse, the latter are joining forces in an effort to
better promote their projects and design common
s t a n d a r d s. In Ecuador, the CONFENIAE, a confe-
deration of indigenous groups from the Amazon
basin, has published guidelines for managing eco-
tourism.The Ecuadorian Ecotourism Association
has designed tools for eva l u ating the env i r o n m e n t a l
policies of tour operators, which are now used in
other Latin A m e rican countri e s. In A f ri c a ,N a m i b i a
f o rmed a national association for community-based
t o u rism (NAC O B TA) in 1995 which groups 41
communities from a range of ethnic gr o u p s. It pro-
vides advice and training to communities seeking to
start up projects, but also keeps a high profile in
i n t e rn ational travel fa i rs. M a ny experts see
N AC O B TA as one of the most rational ways for pro-
moting and defending this touri s m , which by nat u r e ,
is small in scale and highly personalized.
The challenge today lies in designing national
s t r at e gies that put the accent on training, access to
markets and capital, and safety norms—issues that
will be on the agenda of the Ecotourism Society’s
general assembly, to be held in December 1999 in
Q u i t o, upon the inv i t ation of the Ecuadorian gove rn-
m e n t .C l e a r l y, this gesture is another sign that indi-
genous groups have gained a voice at national leve l ,
and tourism is just one way in which they are being
h e a r d . As one Ecuadorian ecotourism operator put
it,“Unlike oil,tourism is sustainable.” n
In good hands: indigenous guides in Venezuela accompany visitors along the Caura river, a tributary of the Orinoco.
