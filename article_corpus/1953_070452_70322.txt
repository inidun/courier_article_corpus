SOC) OLOG) CAL ASPECTS
OF RACE RELATIONS
WHILE so much attention isbeing given these days to
the psychological and in-
terpersonal aspects of race rela-
tions, it is well not to lose sight of
t, he importance of what may be des-
cribed, broadly speaking, as the
sociological factors in the situa-
tion. For reasons which cannot be
discussed here, there is a tendency
on the part of professional students
as well as on the part of laymen to
regard psychological factors and
interpersonal relations in race re-
lations as more fundamental than
sociological factors.
After all, it is contended, the rela-
tions which exist between members
of different races are dependent
upon how individuals of different..-...races reel towards
each other, and what
ideas they have of
each other. More-
over, it is argued,
laws and practices
involving discrimi-
nation against cer-
tain racial and na-
tional groups are the
expression of the
ideas and feelings of
individuals. But
such reasoning fails
to take into account
the source and na-
ture of racial attitu-
des and the manner
in which they are
propagated in mo-
dern societies.
Let us consider
then the source and
nature of racial at-
titudes or attitudes
which people have
towards ethnic or
national groups
other than their
own. The attitudes
of members of one
racial or ethnic
group towards mem-
bers of another
group are not indi-
vidual but social at-.
titudes. They are
social attitudes in
the sense that they
represent the defini-
tions and concep-
tions which their
own group provides
of the members of a
different racial
group.
It is needless to
emnhasize what is
generally known, namely that chil-
dren do not have racial prejudices
or that racial attitudes are not
instinctive. But it is necessary to
point out another factor of great
importance. Although children
perceive differences in colour, for
example, these differences have no
racial significance until the group
of which the child is a member de-
fines them as racially significant.
This is vividly illustrated by the
case in which a white child simply
thought that her coloured playma-
te's colour was due to too much io-
dine until her own parents told. her
that she could not invite. her col-
oured playmate to her birthday
party because she was a Negro
child. It was then that colour ac-
quired significance as a racial mark
for this white child.
In regard to such racial marks as
skin colour, hair texture, and other
physical features, it should be poin-
ted out these only become signifi-
cant for race relations when they
become symbols of racial identifi-
cation. These racial marks do not
in themselves create racial pro-.
blems. In fact, in some countries
where there are people with diffe-
rent racial characteristics, race
problems and race relations do not
exist. People are categorized ra-
ther according to their class or oc-
cupations in the particular society.
This is not strange because the
manner in whic. h people are cate-
gorized is determined by a number
of historical and social factors.
When we consider the attitudes
of the members of one racial group
towards the individuals of another
racial group, we are really dealing
by Dr. E. Franklin FRAZ/fR
with the way in which members of
a race are categorized. When one is
prejudiced towards the members of
another racial group, one treats
members of that group according
to the manner in which they are
categorized rather than according
to their individual traits or quali-
ties. It is for this reason that the
study of racial stereotypes is so
important in race relations.
The prejudiced person, as it has
been said, is not prejudiced against
the individual of a different race
so much as against the categoric
picture or stereotype of the race.
This is why it is very unlikely
that prejudice against a racial
group is the result of an unpleasant
experience with a member of that
group. If cne becomes conscious
of prejudice against a group follow-
ing an unpleasant experience with
one of its members, it is most likely
that the experience has only arous-
ed a latent attitude or evoked a
latent emotional response to the
categoric picture of the racial
group.
An unpleasant experience with a
member of a different racial group
does not necessarily lead to prej u-
dice against the group. An un-
pleasant experience results in pre-
judice against another racial group
when certain social attitudes to-
wards the particular racial group
already exist in one's own group.
If these social attitudes do not exist
the unpleasant experience is reac-
ted to as an unpleasant experience
with an individual rather than
with the representative of a racial
group. Therefore, it is important
to study the nature and source of
these social attitudes.
The source of these social attitu-
des is to be found in the social heri-
tage of a group. They are as much
of the social heritage or culture of
a group as other conceptions and
values which are transmitted
through education and other means
of communication. Just as a mem-
ber of society or a particular group
assimilates unconsciously the ideals
and values of his group, he assimi-
lates the conceptions and attitudes
of his group in regard to certain
races.
A study of art and literature,
theatres, films and radio, cartoons
and comic and strips will reveal
the current racial concepts which
are part of the social heritage of a
between races so as
to give one a lower
status as, for exam-
ple, exclusion from
certain occupations,
no amount of indi-
vidual racial good-
will can overcome
the decisive influen-
ce of these institu-
tions in the forma-
tion of social attitu-
des in respect to
race.
Even if the indivi-
dual has managed
to emancipate him-
self from the current
racial attitudes, the
institutions of so-
ciety place definite
limitations upon the
extent to which he
can express his par-
t i c u 1 a r attitudes.
The restrictions
upon the expression
of his personal
feeling and attitu-
des are increased
when he is charged
with carrying out
institutional policies
in regard to race
which are opposed
to his own concep-
tions.
Something should
be added concerning
the legal institutions
and culture of a so-
ciety. T h e re is
m u c h confusion
concerning the role
of law in changing
race relations, In
the past some social
scientists have gone
so far as to state that laws have
no influence on race relations. Then
many laymen echoing this opinion
have said that laws cannot make
people friends or love each other.
All of this is not only beside the
point, but introduces confusion
into thinking on this question.
Participation in the collective
life of a political community is sel-
dom carried on on the basis of
friendship or love. The very basis
of civilized life is law. More spe-
cifically we know from experience
that laws have been responsible for
the extension of the rights and op-
portunities of racial groups.
The main purpose of this article
has been to call attention to the
obvious fact that the thinking and
feelings of individuals in regard to
members of a different racial group
are shaped and coloured, so to
speak, by the conceptions and atti-
tudes of their own group.
These conceptions and attitudes
are communicated to individuals
by the various channels of com-
munication in a society. Despite
the growing mobility of the peoples
of the world, the vast majority of
the people of the world will conti-
nue to depend upon these means
of communication for their ideas
and feelings towards other races.
On the other hand, their attitudes
and reactions to members of a dif-
ferent racial group dwelling within
their midst will depend largely
upon the institutions and laws
which regulate their relations and
determine the extent to which they
can co-operate on a basis of equal-
ity and develop mutual under-
standing and respect.
group as well as the means by
which these concepts and attitudes
are perpetuated. Studies of the at-
titudes of people have constantly
revealed these channels of commu-
nications as the source of their ra-
cial prejudices. In fact, a number
of studies have revealed that pre-
judice may be strongest against a
racial group with whom one has
never had direct contact.
The institutions of society also
play a decisive role in perpetuating
certain racial attitudes. Where
institutions prevent easy commu-
nication and association between
individuals with different racial
and cultural backgrounds as, for
example, separate schools and
churches, or define the relations
