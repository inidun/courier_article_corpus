1 BLACK DEATH '
LURKS
UNDERGROUND
A small brown, furry animal, too common in
India to attract much notice has suddenly
become the central figure in a research project
of international significance. The Tatera in¬
dica, as this wild rodent is known to zoologists,
has become important because of the role it
appears to play in spreading and perpetuating
a dread diseasebubonic plague, the "Black
Death", Evidence linking this seemingly
harmless rodent with plague has been collected
by scientists in Uttar Pradesh, India, where
in 1947, more than 50,000 people died of
plague. Latest research suggests that the
Tatera indica, harbours the disease between
outbreaks in its underground burrows.
Some of these wild rats have a higher
resistance to plague and survive outbreaks
which kill off most others, including house
rats. They then carry the plague bacilli in
their blood and spread infection through
their fleas. Laboratory tests, on 5,000 wild
rats and several hundred guinea pigs showed
researchers that Tatera indica was, in fact,
the plague reservoir in Uttar Pradesh. Photos
tell how research "convicted" this wild rat as
a dangerous harbourer of plague. ( 1-2) When
grass is burned away rodents' burrows and
"footpaths" are revealed. (3-4) As burrows
are dug out a frightened rat tries to escape.
(5) Before it can get away a pair of rat
forceps have it firmly by the ear and tail.
(6) Villagers lend a hand in baiting rat traps.
(7) Rat is numbered and released exactly where
it was caught. Later catches of marked rats
show extent of their movement in village. (8)
Guinea pig is injected with organic matter
from rats suspected as plague carriers. (9) If
rodents were infected a plague abscess appears
at the ¡nnoculated spot on guinea pig's back.
