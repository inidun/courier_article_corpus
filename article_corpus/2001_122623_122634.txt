I
s science on the verge of explaining the mystery
of existence,once and for all? Some prominent
scientists are suggesting as much. They claim
that unified theories of physics such as
superstring theory,when combined with refin e d
versions of the big bang model,will soon bequeath us
a so-called “theory of everything.” As described by
physicists such as Stephen Hawking, a theory of
everything will be a kind of mystical revelation,
which permanently transforms the “ H u h ? ”of wonder
evoked in us by our contemplation of nature into a
great “A h a ! ”
Those who find this vision of a wonderless world
chilling rather than exhilarating should be assured
that it will never be fulfil l e d . One of the great
paradoxes of modern science is that the more it
tells about about existence, the more
mysterious existence becomes.
The conundrum
of reality
Take the simplest question of
a l l :Why is there something rather
than nothing? The big bang
theory, for all its power, cannot
tell us why and how the big
bang happened in the first
p l a c e. Some physicists note
that according to quantum
m e c h a n i c s, empty space is
seething with so-called virtual
p a r t i c l e s, which spring into
existence for an instant before
v a n i s h i n g ; p e r h a p s, t h e s e
physicists speculate, the entire
universe began as a kind of virtual
p a r t i c l e. Honest physicists will
nevertheless admit that they have
absolutely no idea why there is
something rather than nothing. After all,
what produced the laws of quantum
mechanics, which supposedly allowed quantum
creation to occur?
The next question is: Why does the universe
look the way it does rather than some other way?
Why does it adhere to these laws of nature rather
than some other laws? Altering any of those laws
would have radically altered reality. If gravity had
been infinitesimally stronger, the universe would
have stopped expanding almost immediately after
the big bang and collapsed into a black hole;a bit
w e a k e r, and the universe would have flown apart so
rapidly that stars, galaxies and planets would never
have formed. The physicist Lawrence Krauss
compares the odds against gravity
having precisely the
value necessary
for the
L i f e against the o d d s
Cosmology has led us back to the very first second of the universe’s
existence, yet the more science reveals, the more it leaves unanswered

Then there is the enigma of life. The biologist
Richard Dawkins once declared that life “is a
mystery no longer”because it had been solved by
Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection.
A c t u a l l y, life is still a complete conundrum, in spite
of all the insights provided by evolutionary theory
and more modern biological paradigms, such as
genetics and molecular biology.None of these fie l d s
can tell us why life appeared on earth in the first
p l a c e, and whether it was a probable event or a
once-in-eternity fluke.
Dawkins and others proclaim that life is a robust
phenomenon that occurs throughout the universe,
but there is no scientific evidence to support this
b e l i e f.After decades of searching,we have found
no signs of life elsewhere in
the universe.As far
as we know, life emerged here on earth only once,
approximately 3.5 billion years ago. M o r e o v e r,
attempts to replicate the origin of life in the
laboratory have left researchers more baffled than
ever at how it occurred. The Nobel prize winner
Francis Crick once complained that “the origin of
life appears to be almost a miracle, so many are
the conditions which would have to be satisfied to
get it going.”C r i c k , it should be noted, is an agnostic
leaning toward atheism.
Scanning the heavens
for signals
Many scientists have contended that once life
started evolving on the earth, it was only a matter of
time before it produced a species as complex as we
a r e. But the history of life on earth does not support
such a view. For roughly 80 percent of life’s 3.5-
billion-year span, it consisted entirely of single-
celled organisms, such as bacteria and algae. Then
something happened—biologists will probably
never know exactly what—and the era of trilobites,
t r i c e r a t o p s, taxi-drivers and other multi-cellular
creatures commenced.
The palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould
has pointed out that contingency — j u s t
plain luck—has played an enormous
role in the emergence of H o m o
s a p i e n s. If life on earth started
from scratch a million times over,
Gould contends, chances are it
would never again produce
m a m m a l s, let alone anything
resembling Homo sapiens .
S i m i l a r l y, the biologist
Ernst Mayr suspects that
we may be the only life
forms in the galaxy and
possibly the entire
universe capable of
inventing radios and other
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s
t e c h n o l o g i e s.For that reason,
Mayr believes that SETI—the
search for extra-terrestrial
i n t e l l i g e n c e, which scans the
heavens for extra-terrestrial radio
transmissions—is doomed to fail.
The particle physicist Steven
Weinberg once wrote: “ The more the
universe seems comprehensible, the more it
seems pointless.”My analysis of science suggests
a corollary aphorism:the more the universe seems
c o m p r e h e n s i b l e, the more it seems improbable.Th e
most wildly improbable feature of the universe is the
