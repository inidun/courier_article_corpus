I t ’s like trying to get water out of a stone.
Across the Middle East, government officials
refuse to discuss the issue of virtual wat e r
publicly. Even academics are reluctant to express
their views on the topic.W hy such silence? After all,
p u b l i c l y - available statistics clearly indicate the
r e gi o n ’s wheat imports are ri s i n g, and there is
reason to believe that this trade will continue as
countries seek seemingly inexpensive and readily
available sources to compensate for dwindling wat e r
supplies.Technological solutions seem unlikely to
tackle the scarcity problem.With falling oil prices
d e va s t ating gove rnment reve n u e s , e ven we a l t hy
c o u n t ries like Saudi Arabia are finding desalinizat i o n
increasingly unaffordable.
In part , the silence stems from the political
climate.“There are a lot of negotiations going on
right now on va rious security issues, i n c l u d i n g
wat e r - s h a ring agr e e m e n t s. A ny inform ation linked
to water scarcity is sensitive,” explains Mamdouh
S h a h i n , a Netherlands-based Egyptian professor
of civil engi n e e ring widely respected in the Middle
East for his hy d r o l o gical assessments of the regi o n .
Virtual water also has a dirty name among the
r e gi o n ’s hy d r o l o gists and policy - m a k e rs who balk at
the notion that governments should import food
crops instead of growing them. Yes, the region is
faced with a water cri s i s.Ye s ,i m p o rting wheat is an
effective means for dealing with the problem. But
does this mean that countries should abandon their

agricultural sectors, or make their farmers pay prices
reflecting the real costs of irrigation?
“I disagree with the suggestion that we should totally
depend on virtual water to feed our people,” s ays Shahin.
“ V i rtual water is one solution. But we need a basket of
solutions—by conserving and developing conve n t i o n a l
and non-conventional water sources like harvesting fog
r e s i d u e or re-using drainage wat e rs from irri g ation and
urban uses.”
Don’t overcharge the farmers
Complete agricultural self-suffic i e n cy may well be
impossible in the regi o n .But for Shahin, this does not mean
t h at gove rnments should abandon the goal of improv i n g
h a rvest yields.“ Food imports are even more strat e gi c a l l y
s e n s i t i ve than energy import s.You can live without oil,bu t
not without food,” s ays Shahin. He notes that one danger
of virtual water is that importing nations would be
vulnerable in the event that grain producing countries cut
subsidies to their fa rm e rs ,potentially leading to signific a n t l y
higher pri c e s.
“ Water for irri g ation will remain a free commodity as
long as people remain so poor.This is in the interest of the
people and the administrat i o n ,” s ays Shahin.
C u rrently many irri g ation systems are wa s t e f u l ,
and gi ven the low price of wat e r , there is little incentive
to introduce technology that would improve effic i e n cy
and cut down waste. But, Shahin says, the solution
d o e s n ’t lie in pushing fa rm e rs from their livelihoods by
c h a r ging them for the water they use. I n s t e a d , h e
proposes investing in more efficient irri g ation systems,
like drip irrigation in which perforated pipes installed
just below the soil surface release small amounts of
water directly to the crops’ roots—a system which
reduces eva p o r ation and seepage.The challenge lies in
finding capital to finance technological improve m e n t s.
Shahin also points out that there are strong religi o u s
objections to charging for wat e r. “According to the
K o r a n , if you find someone who needs water but is
unable to reward or compensate you in any way, yo u
must gi ve them some for the sake of God’s blessing
and mercy,” he say s.“So in countries like Egypt and
S y ri a , ri ve rs are considered a gift of God.And since
the people are too poor to compensate the
government for the price of delivering that water,
there is no charge.”
Virtual imports vs. virtual exports
The concept of virtual water also comes under
attack from an economic pers p e c t i ve ,s ays Jad Isaac,
director-general of the Applied Research Institute of
Je ru s a l e m , a non-profit organization for sustainable
d e velopment in Palestinian terri t o ri e s.“If we are going
to talk about virtual import s ,”he say s ,“ we should also
consider our virtual exports (of fruits and ve g e t a b l e s )
to Europe and the United Stat e s.” For Isaac, t h e
question is not whether countries should abandon their
a gricultural sectors , but rat h e r , which types of
a griculture should be gi ven pri o ri t y : w h e at for food
s e c u ri t y, or high value cash crops like vegetables and
f ruits? “ I t ’s all about economics and following market
f o r c e s ,” Isaacs say s. “With globalizat i o n , there is not
a country in the world that can declare itself self-
s u f fic i e n t .”
“Whether we like it or not,” s ays Isaac,“ water is a
finite resource. It would be totally wrong to use it
u n e c o n o m i c a l l y.”According to Isaac,g ove rnment has
the responsibility to provide free water for domestic
n e e d s. But agriculture is an economic activity and so
fa rm e rs should pay for irri g at i o n .“It has to happen,bu t
s l owly because such a large part of the labour force
depends on agri c u l t u r e .You cannot suddenly transform
d e veloping countries into industrialized ones,”he say s.
E ven highly developed nations like Israel, w h i c h
receives tremendous financial and other forms of
assistance from the United States and other We s t e rn
g ove rn m e n t s ,h ave failed to adopt an economically
e f ficient agricultural policy.“ M a ny think there has
been a change in Israeli policy, but the gove rn m e n t
is still subsidizing water,” says Isaac. He notes that
Israel has one of the regi o n ’s highest percentages of
i rri g ated agriculture—about 50 per cent of its arable
l a n d — but that agriculture contri butes less than
two per cent to the economy. On the other hand,
Isaac notes that the Palestinian agricultural sector
represents about 20 per cent of the economy, even
though only six per cent of its arable land is irri g at e d .
“The Israeli policy doesn’t make sense,” s ay s
I s a a c.They should gi ve the water they took by force
back to the Palestinians who can do more in their
d e velopment with it.”With a gross national product
(GNP) of about $17,000 per capita, Isaac maintains
t h at Israel can afford to orient its economy towa r d s
high-technology sectors and depend less on fa rm i n g .
In contrast, Palestinian per capita GNP is about
$1,000 and dependent on agri c u l t u r e , s ays Isaac.
T h at is why Palestinians should continue to deve l o p
fa rming in the short term , while gradually building an
i n d u s t rial base. S ays Isaac: “ I t ’s like a baby. F i rst he
c r aw l s , then he walks and then he learns to ru n .” n
