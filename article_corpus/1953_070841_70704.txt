'EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF A TREE'
by Andréa Salieri
THE"Sauvage"was really
right after all. Even if
he did cause the two
scandals which created
such an uproar in the class on
human rights in our small school.
We had nicknamed him the
"Sauvage"because he let his hair
grow so long, because of the
acrobatic tricks he was always
performing, and the earsplitting
shrieks which filled the courtyard
as he raced gleefully from school
each day. But that didn't
prevent him from being an
excellent student. He was ex-
tremely well liked by our teacher
even though he once admitted
(privately of course) that the
"Sauvage"sometimes terrified
him.
Our school, located at the edge
of a small village in central
France, had only one teacher
and only one classroom-like so
many other schools in France
today. One day, the teacher
decided to organize a small ex-
hibition on human rights. He set
up a series of beautiful white
panels with the 30 Articles of the
Universal Declaration displayed
in large printed type. There
were simple explanations for
each Article, and many photo-
graphs and engravings to illus-
trate them.
And the nth e 'Sauvage"
stepped in with his scandal.
On the first night of the
inauguration of the exhibition, the
"Sauvage"got hold of a huge
sheet of paper and wrote out the
following inscription :"Article : 31 :
Everyone has the right to climb
up to the top of the tree". The next
morning he nailed his notice to
the trunk. of the chestnut tree
which rose majestically in the
middle of the courtyard. Its
lowest branches were some 30
feet above the ground.
The notice was a huge success
with all the students. We roared
with laughter. And yet we felt
there was something embarrass-
ing about the whole thing like
a poor joke, not in very good
taste ; and almost sacriligious.
"He's making fun of human
rights", one boy whispered.
What surprised us most, how-
ever, was that the teacher didn't
get at all angry. He merely
announced that he recognized the
handwriting. And after the
"Sauvage"admitted that he had
done it, the teacher turned to him
and asked simply :"What on
earth made you want to do that ?"
The"Sauvage"hung his head
and fidgeted, but made no reply.
"What did you want to do", asked
the teacher,"make fun of the
exhibition ?" This jerked the
"Sauvage"out of his silence.
"Oh no", he protested."It wasn't
that at all. It was just an idea I
had..."
It took him five full minutes to
explain his idea, simple though it
was."In other words", said the
teacher,"it's one thing to hare
rights and quite another to be able
to exercise them. Is that what
you were driving at ? If it is, I
agree with you."
The fact is that the."Sauvage"
knew the text of the Universal
Declaration quite well. site had
noted, for example, that"Every-
one has the right to property".
But his parents had no property
except their clothes and their
furniture. He had also read :
"Everyone has the right to rest
and leisure", and that reminded
him how tired his mother was
every evening-too tired to speak
and too tired even to eat hen the
family sat down to dinner. She,
of course, had the right to leisure
- in principle.
He had also read :"Everyone
has the right to education". But
in class he had learned that there
was a shortage of schools in most
countries and that in huge regions
of the world there were no schools
at all. In such places children
might well have the right to
education, but it didn't change
their situation.
"Well", said our teacher,"I see
you are beginning to understand.
The Articles of the Declaration
aren't a magic formula ; they are
rules. They point to the rights
that people have and imply that
everyone-that is every citizen in
any country anywhere-should
have the possibility of enjoying
them. And if a person doesn't
have the possibility then it's got
to be given to him. By whom ?
Well, the government, the state
or the communitv-in fact
everyone. When the Declaration
says'Everyone has the right to
education'it means'the commu-
nity is required to build enough
schools so that all children can
get a proper education'."
"Everyone would have the
right to climb up the chestnut
tree", said the"Sam'age"to
himself,"if it was'worth the
trouble, and if someone provided
a ladder."
But he said nothing since he
had grasped the teacher's point
and that was what mattered. In
fact the"Sauvage"said nothing
more about human rights until he
precipitated the second scandal.
This occurred on the day our
teacher discussed the great men
of history, the martyrs and refor-
mers to whom we owe many of
the rights and freedoms pro-
claimed today. At the end of the
lesson our teacher asked us a
question."Do you think these
great men succeeded" ?"Do you
think they won their fight for
freedom and justice ?"
Everyone of us in the class
replied with an enthusiastic
"yes"-the proof being the
Universal Declaration itself.
Everyone of us, that is, except
the"Sam'age". When his turn
came to reply he shook his head
firmly."It's nothing but lies,"
he said, and ignoring the horrified
"ohs"and"ahs"that went up
from, all of us, he went on :
"You can't tell me that all men
have become brothers. Or that
justice exists everywhere today
any more than equality. It's a
I."Iie/'
Once again the teacher said
that it was the"Sam'age"who
was might. lIe explained that the
fight for real freedom ; was not
won-far from it. He said that
the Universal Declaration was
not a communique of victory and
compared it rathcr to an order of
the day.
Then he turned to the"Sau-
Yage"."The Declaration seems
to make you boiling mad", he
said."That's fine. That's what
it's supposed to do. It doesn't
describe human rights as they
are but as they ought to be.
I've told you how other men and
women have fought in the past.
When you think of the Declara-
tion today, you can think of the
rights that still down 1 exist, and
you can get angry. But also try
to think of ways in which you can
live up to the Declaration and
make it a reality."
The"Sauvage"'was no longer
thinking about the chestnut tree
in the playground. He was some-
. what embarrassed that the tea-
cher seemed to be speaking just
to him. But when the teacher
suddenly asked :"Do you think
the world is civilized-the
people in our own country for
example ?", the boy's reply came
quickly."No, not entirely.
Otherwise we wouldn't have to be
taught about human rights."
"Well then", said our teacher
speaking now to the entire class,
"Let's learn to apply human
rights to everything in our daily
lives. If every class everywhere
did that, I think we'd end up in
time being really civilized. And
remembel"if lve don't act human
rights ourselves no-one else will
do it for us."
