Until the late 1980s Patis Tesoro was a
housewife and part-time fashion desi-
gner who enjoyed an upper-middle class
life in the exclusive neighbourhoods of San
J u a n , a town on the outskirts of Manila.
O c c a s i o n a l l y, she would tailor-make an out-
fit for people in her rich circle of fri e n d s ,a n d
it would bring enough money to buy the
e x p e n s i ve ornaments with which she deco-
r ates her spacious home.
But in the afterm ath of nat i o n - bu i l d i n g
t h at followed the 1986 ove rt h r ow of Presi-
dent Ferdinand Marcos, Tesoro found her
t rue calling as a social activist, e n t r e p r e n e u r ,
and leader in development economics. S e e i n g
t h at ethnic wear was a part of Philippine
identity that was dying out as the result of an
i nvasion of polyester and cotton goods based
on We s t e rn design, Tesoro set out to save
one humble piece of heri t a g e :p i ñ a , a hand-
woven fibre deri ved from the pineapple leaf,
the mainstay of the traditional ethnic dress
called the b a r o n g. (See box on facing page).
Turning over a new leaf
More than a decade lat e r , her designs are
de rigueur for Philippine high society.A l o n g
the way to success,Tesoro almost single-han-
dedly helped create thousands of jobs for
peasants and we ave rs throughout the Philip-
p i n e s. In a country whose per capita GDP is
roughly $880 a ye a r , piña we ave rs can now
e a rn as much as $200 or $300 a month.S u c h
an income makes it much more likely that
women will stay in the villages and we ave
piña rather than go abroad to be domestic
s e rva n t s ,who earn salaries ranging from $300
to $400 a month.Though Tesoro had a lot of
help from others , she used no capital except
her own pocket money and grants totalling no
more than a few million pesos1. Her story is
t h at of raw determ i n at i o n ,s t r at e gic lobbying
of the right gove rnment offic i a l s , and smart
marketing at home and abroad.It is also a tale
of how the developing world can transform
tradition into business that creates we a l t h
and shores up cultural identity.
For developing nat i o n s , the potential
economic rewards alone of building fa s h i o n
design and retailing capabilities are enor-
m o u s. C u rrently the South is the hub of tex-

A m e rica now emerging as a playe r.
But these are largely “low-end” opera-
tions where the gross profit margins are
fairly small—perhaps only 10 per cent.T h e
big margi n s , as much as 200 per cent, go to
d e s i g n e rs and retailers , predominantly We s-
t e rn . Ironically in recent ye a rs many We s t e rn
fashion houses have turned to ethnic themes
from A f ri c a , L atin A m e rica and Asia for
creative inspiration. In the middle of this
supply chain, trading houses that source
from manufa c t u r e rs and sell to retailers
enjoy margins of 20-30 per cent.
If the developing world has thus far been
r e l e g ated to a swe atshop role, things may be
c h a n ging in Asia as the regi o n ’s economies get
back on track following the 1997 fin a n c i a l
c ri s i s , and as indigenous designers discove r
their abilities.
“We (in Asia) have a wealth of talent
e m e r gi n g, as good as anywhere in the
wo r l d ,” s ays Professor Edward Newton,
c h a i rman of Hong Kong’s Institute of Te x-
tiles and Clothing, A s i a ’s biggest such
research centre and think tank.
But to realize potential a lot of art i s t i c
c r e ativity is needed, as well as a sense of
w h at sells,g u m p t i o n , risk-taking and a vision.
“I always felt that we Filipinos were loo-
king for an identity,” s ays Tesoro at a coffee
shop she’s built adjacent to her museum-like
s t u d i o,which is filled with rolls of traditional
fa b rics and tropical spices.“ W h at we needed
to do was to get back to our roots.We we r e
losing our identity. We were being ove r w-
helmed by We s t e rn civilizat i o n .”
Ethnic roots
Tesoro’s story begins in the late 1980s.
In the euphoria after the dow n fall of the
Marcos regi m e ,Tesoro and her close fri e n d s
began a process of soul searching. M a ny
wanted to do something to contri bute to
the new republic and decided to look at their
ethnic roots: a complex history of ethnic tri-
bal traditions, f l avoured by Spanish and
American colonialism.
Along with two other we l l - c o n n e c t e d

we a l t hy fri e n d s , Te s o r o, n ow 48 and a
mother of four, opened the Padrones de
Casa Manila, a museum that celebrat e s
more than 300 years of Philippine history.
It was then that Tesoro came to realize that
m a ny traditional industries were dead or
dying during ye a rs of neglect under Marcos.
Among them was what once was the pri d e
and joy of the Philippines: n atural fib r e s.
Tesoro was particularly intrigued by piña
c l o t h , which by that time was nearly impos-
sible to fin d .
When Tesoro went in 1986 to the
V i s aya s , a set of islands where piña still gr e w
w i l d , she found only a handful of part - t i m e
we ave rs—most of them women in their lat e
70s or 80s. Clearly piña was going to die
with these wo m e n ,s ays Te s o r o, who began
lobbying local officials to set up courses to
train the next generation of we ave rs. It took
Tesoro nearly two ye a rs of lobbying offic i a l s
before they took any action.
It was finally only by contacting V i c t o r
O r d o ñ e z ,Under Secretary of Educat i o n ,a n d
Carlos Dominguez,S e c r e t a ry of A gri c u l t u r e ,
t h at Tesoro was able to convince the gove rn-
ment to take action. In 1988, Tesoro and
the Aklan State College of A griculture in

the V i s ayas began a series of courses on piña
we av i n g . It took another year of lobbying
g ove rnment officials for Tesoro to conv i n c e
the gove rnment to put up more funding to
train local fa rm e rs to begin cultivating piña
a g a i n . “It was not easy,” s ays Te s o r o.
Re-establishing the piña trade was eve n
more diffic u l t .She recalls the first meeting she
held with former gr owe rs , we ave rs , leaf stri p-
p e rs and traders.She asked why they stopped
selling piña.“There was a shouting mat c h ,”
s ays Te s o r o. “ People blamed each other and
the middlemen.W h at it came down to was the
p rice of piña was just too low.There wa s n ’t
nearly enough a profit margin for the industry.
People would rather go ove rseas to be
domestic helpers than be we ave rs.”
Status symbol
By now, the gove rn m e n t ’s Fiber
I n d u s t ry and Development A s s o c i ation wa s
on her side.Together they began setting up
a distri bution channel for the piña. In turn ,
she promised the gr owe rs and we ave rs that
she would buy their supply and also help
promote their fa b rics nationally by inte-
grating them into her fashion designs. In
fa c t , it was Tesoro who continually wa s
willing to pay a higher price for piña at the
b e gi n n i n g . By marketing her piña b a r o n g s t o
her rich fri e n d s ,Tesoro was able to influ e n c e
how the elites of Manila dressed.
Tesoro’s clients list today reads like a
W h o ’s Who of the Philippines: C o ry A q u i n o
and her daughters,former President Fidel
Ramos and his wife, President Estrada and
his wife, and almost every major business
tycoon in the country. “It is now a status
symbol again,” claims Te s o r o, whose outfit s
sell for as much as $1,000 each.
In fa c t , it was by enlisting the help of
f o rmer first lady Amelita Ramos that Te s o r o

was not only able to get more funding gr a n t s
to train both gr owe rs and we ave rs but also
spread the gospel about the importance of
piña as a fa b ric among Philippine elites.To g e-
t h e r ,Te s o r o, the former first lady, and a few
o t h e rs , founded the Katutubong Pilipino
Fo u n d at i o n ,which is dedicated to the reviva l
of traditional Philippine art s ,crafts and culture.
To d ay, Tesoro is no longer the only
bu yer of piña. M a ny younger Filipino desi-
g n e rs are turning to it. In fa c t , the piña
industry today employs more than 2,500
people in the state of Aklan alone, which
produced 80,000 metres of piña fabric in
1998, up from a mere 3,000 metres a year
back in 1986. Aklan is the centre of the
piña industry in the Philippines. H e r e ,m o r e
than 80 per cent of the country’s piña pro-
ducts are produced.The industry’s annual
turnover is roughly US$1 million a year.
Much of the Philippine’s piña export s

began after the Pa ris Fair of May 1997,w h e n
Tesoro and then first lady Ramos put on a
major show to promote traditional Philip-
pine fibres to the wo r l d ’s top fashion houses.
T h at show was the re-introduction of piña to
the wo r l d . New York-based Filipino-Ame-
rican designer Josie Nat o ri is now experi-
menting with piña, for instance.More may be
on the way. The Japanese textile gr o u p,
K a n e b o, for instance, is experimenting for
the first time with the mass manufa c t u ring of
piña by mixing its fibres with others.
Newton shares the view that many deve-
loping nations will explode on to the wo r l d
fashion scene. He is particularly optimistic
about India and China,which have the market
gi rth to produce influential fashion culture
and may some day ri val the We s t . B e s i d e s
To k yo,he sees the emergence of Hong Kong
and Shanghai as possible ri vals to Milan,
Pa ris and London in the next decade or two.
Hong Kong already plays the pivo t a l
role as the sourcing centre for the entire gar-
ment industry and is also beginning to pro-
duce some top fashion design talent. S h a n-
ghai will ri s e , s u p p o rted by its gr ow i n g
middle class, which demands not just We s-
t e rn brands but Chinese ones as we l l .
I n d e e d , in China today Jeans West is already
a leading domestically-produced blue jean.
Unique products
“Some day, ‘Made in China or Hong
Kong’ will become a status symbol,” says
Newton.
Smaller countries such as the Philippines
will have fewer chances of producing name
brands because the home markets in most ins-
tances are just too small to gi ve them global
p r e s e n c e . T h e r e , s ays Newton, d e s i g n e rs
should focus on niche design and products.“ I f
you don’t have uniqueness, then you have to
be competitive in making cheap garm e n t s
like any other developing country in the
wo r l d ,” he say s.
Finding the right designs however is a
huge challenge. Newton believes talented
young designers would do well to study
fashion in the West, as did Japan’s Kenzo
(Paris) and Josie Natori (New York).
H owe ve r , Te s o r o ’s example suggests
breakthroughs are possible by looking inwa r d .
She now hopes to professionalize the Philip-
p i n e s ’ n atural fibre industry so that future
d e s i g n e rs will have more ingredients to use in
their ethnic designs. n
