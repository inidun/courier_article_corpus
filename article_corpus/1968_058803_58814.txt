The click of
computerized
medicine
by John Anderson
The human brain comprises 10,000 million cells as many as there are stars in our galaxy.
Impulses from the nervous system keep these cells in a state of constant chemical
and electrical activity. Sometimes the electrical discharges in the brain become excessive
and aberrant, as in the case of an attack of epilepsy, a nervous disorder about which we
have still much to learn. Use of a new technique, stereo electroencephalograph exploration
(shown in photo), now enables doctors to locate precisely which parts of a patient's
brain are linked with his attacks of epilepsy and to decide whether or not to operate.
Electrodes placed in skull detect electrical discharges and data is recorded by investigating
apparatus. Doctor observes patient's reactions on a TV screen.
R ABA awakes one morn¬
ing feeling but a sick shadow of his
usual self. His wife and children also
think he is ill. The television telephone
Is moved to his bedside and he talks
to his doctor.
The doctor works in a modern health
centre and talks directly with his pa¬
tient, seeing him at the same time on
his television telephone. He deter¬
mines the patient's symptoms, finds
out that he has a headache and feels
sick and feverish, and decides by look¬
ing at him and hearing what he has
to say that he Is fit enough to visit
the health centre if he comes by spe¬
cial air-conditioned electrical car.
Immediately the doctor switches on
the visual screen connecting him with
the computer. He speaks the patient's
name and address in a special tone
of voice, and asks the computer for
Mr ABA's medical record. This is
displayed for him on the television
screen of his computer link. He reads
it and then dictates further information
to the computer link. The computer
arranges the appointment for Mr ABA
and records the doctor's observations.
On arrival at the clinic at the
appointed time, having had his trans¬
portation from home organized by
the computer, Mr ABA goes straight
in to see the doctor in Room 82, direct-

KIDNEYS SEEN
VIA GEIGER
COUNTER
To study the general condition
of a patient's kidneys or
to confirm the presence of a
tumour, doctors sometimes
use a diagnostic technique
called scintography. After
injecting a radioactive
substance which concentrates
in the kidneys, they use
a Geiger counter to pick up
the radiation emitted.
The results are recorded
as dots which form a picture
or scintigram. Right,
scintigram of normal kidneys.

ed by the nurse in the vestibule who
has received her instructions from the
computer voice coming from a ter¬
minal located there. She records
Mr ABA's arrival by his name and
number which she speaks into a
special microphone.
Mr ABA is seen by Dr. X who talks
further with him about his symptoms,
examines him and suggests that further
tests on blood and urine are required.
While the specimens are being obtain¬
ed, the doctor dictates a medical sum¬
mary of Mr ABA's illness and his other
observations to the computer terminal.
The computer television screen
comes up with a possible list of diag¬
noses. The doctor indicates the likely
possibilities and the computer agrees,
but suggests another less familiar pos¬
sibility and further tests the doctor
might do. The doctor decides he
would like some more information
about this special aspect and after
requesting access to the computer
medical library is able to read on the
screen the special information he has
requested and the summary of the
past experience of many clinics obtain¬
ed by the computer system.
The doctor collects the required
blood and urine specimens in special
containers which are automatically
removed by a computer-controlled
tube communication system to the two
automated laboratories where the var¬
ious tests will be done. The com¬
puter estimates the time the tests
will take and informs the doctor when
the results will be ready. Mr ABA
goes to the waiting room and is soon
summoned to return by the computer
as it now has his results ready. The
doctor also is informed.
The doctor then prescribes the
appropriate treatment, advises Mr ABA
to stay at home for a few days, and to
get in touch with him again if all is
not well. Before Mr ABA's departure
the doctor dictates to the computer
terminal the treatment his patient re¬
quires. This is checked by the com
puter and the message passed to the
automated pharmacy department in
the Centre.
At the pharmacy the computer
arranges the various sorting devices to
locate and fill the boxes with the
appropriate tablets for Mr ABA, print
the instructions and label the boxes
automatically. The pills are then
transported by tube system to Room 82
and the doctor hands them to Mr ABA.
The doctor checks the patient's
instructions and tells the computer
that the patient has his treatment and
that no further arrangements are ne¬
cessary unless Mr ABA calls.
The computer then enters all the
data on Mr ABA; including the treat¬
ment prescribed, in the central file
while the next patient is seeing the
doctor. It has already taken over
much of the mechanical chores from
the doctor and nurse by communicat¬
ing, arranging and doing special tests.
It helps to perform and organize tests
automatically and records the result.
A. . UTOMATIC dispensing of
treatment through ancillary sorting and
labelling devices is done by the com¬
puter. It also checks the dosage and
updates the stocks of the dispensary,
so that it can make new orders when
required. Thus it frees the doctor and
nurse to take care of Mr ABA.
If Mr ABA had had to attend hospital
for further investigation and treatment,
the health centre computer would have
organized the appointment with the
hospital's computer and this would
have been conveyed to Mr ABA by
telephone using the computer's auto¬
matic voice mechanism. If he was
unable to come at that particular time,
Mr ABA would indicate this and the
computer would make a new appoint¬
ment. The computer can accept a few
commands, as well as responses like
"yes" and "no", in any language.
On arrival to see the hospital con¬
sultant, Mr ABA would be directed
from the reception desk to the doctor's
office by a nurse. There would be no
waiting, all arrangements having been
made by the computer. Again, after
talking with Mr ABA and examining
him, the hospital doctor would record
all his medical data on the computer,
which would take care of the investi¬
gation schedule and the treatment.
If Mr ABA needed to go into hospital,
the computer would arrange for his
bed and meals and for nursing staff
to be allocated to him. All the hospi¬
tal's communication would be done by
means of the computer, so that records
would be made as information was
received. Both hospital and health
centre would use the same medical
data bank for Mr ABA's medical rec¬
ord, much of it being available only
to his doctors with a much more res¬
tricted access than is at present allow¬
ed, thus giving Mr ABA complete confi¬
dence in the safety and reliability of
the system.
Patients in the year 2000 have found
that the computer cuts out the time
spent waiting to see the doctor and
organizes automatically the medical
procedures. As it does not tire or
get bad tempered and only rarely
breaks down, patients have come to
take it all for granted.
The doctor too has had to learn
about medical computing techniques
and during his training has become
used to working with a computer. In
some parts of his course, where he
has had to memorize a great deal of
information, he was taught by the com¬
puter which corrected his mistakes pa¬
tiently and with good humour no mat¬
ter what the time or the occasion. The
computer was used to teach him the
tone and emphasis to use in giving it
instructions. Speech and information
flashed on a screen now provide a
much quicker and rapid means of
communication between man and
computer.

by Joseph Handler,
The computer has greatly increased
the facilities available also to the fam¬
ily doctor who can order many
investigations and use the computer
to interpret the results, or get it to
search the literature relating to a spe¬
cific disease and give him a summary
of world medical knowledge on the
subject.
With such a system, the approach
to illness and health has altered. The
man-machine relationship has now
emphasized the importance of pre-
symptomatic disease which is present
before the patient feels there is
anything wrong. This has been one
of the major'developments in medicine
in the year 2000 when most of the
infectious diseases as well as cancer
have come under the control of new
and powerful drugs.
The key to the problem lies in the
body's reaction to disease where it
can compensate for many errors until
the control starts breaking down and
symptoms arise. A deeper under¬
standing of cybernetic mechanisms
as a result of new man-machine tech¬
niques has brought this to the fore.
It has been- found that drug influen¬
ces may be more potent and accurate
if given earlier. New techniques ex¬
ploiting the advances in knowledge in
physics, chemistry and bio-engineer¬
ing have all been used with great
effect for the patient's benefit.
What of computers themselves and
the operating staff? The expenditure
in effort to instruct the computers has
been great and so was the initial
expense, but once the task had been
done it was well worth it because of
its universal application.
The computers are still having
trouble in translating all the languages
but can aiready accept six or seven.
Many doctors all over the world speak
a universal medical language thanks
to computer training.
The computers are much smaller
now, work faster and are organized
into hierarchies of machines, looking
after themselves to a great extent.
Advances in electronics and engineer¬
ing have made them much more
reliable.
Many other automatic devices have
been developed which the computer
can control and which get rid of many
of the automatic chores connected
with a health service. On the econo¬
mic side the performance of the com¬
puter and of the many automatic
measuring devices and automated
dispensaries has freed the health ser¬
vice from its dependence on various
forms of human labour. Administra¬
tion has been largely taken over by
the computer; directors of hospitals
and health centres are merely required
to issue judgments on the data provid¬
ed by the computer.
D ISTRICT health services
are organized and controlled by a
series of computers. Health officers
can track down physical and emotio¬
nal problems to specific areas. Much
has been done to improve emotional
as well as physical health by altera¬
tion of the environment and support
of the patient by skilled medical
workers at the level of the home and
health centre rather than at the
hospital.
As the areas and health centres
have undertaken more personal care
of the patient, hospitals have decreas¬
ed in importance and are viewed as
centres of investigation and research.
Now many more doctors and nurses
are outside hospitals, and the preven¬
tive measures due to the detection of
pre-symptomatic disease have greatly
decreased the incidence of gross
disorders.
Man has much more leisure now
to devote to family group activities
and as a result human relationships
have become richer. Control of the
environment through man-machine
techniques has kept pace with the
progress in medicine. Everywhere the
computer is an essential work-horse,
much like the diesel engine and power
cable in the middle of the 20th cen¬
tury. The man-machine revolution . is
still continuing in the 21st century
and is creating many problems at na¬
tional level because of the speed of
advance.
Problems have arisen because of the
explosion of information in every di¬
rection in society and in particular in
the medical field. Economic manage¬
ment of hospitals and area health. ser¬
vices has proved difficult. On a natio¬
nal scale the same problem exists, for
ideas about making computers reduce
the flow of information by developing
techniques to sift and sort various
types of data are hard to prove. Thus
the unorganized randomness of infor¬
mation is still with us.
While Mr ABA's care by able ma¬
nagement is good at the local level,
serious difficulties in the direction of
the service at higher levels reduce
the efficiency of medical care. Overall
management services have resisted
the challenge of the man-machine age
longer than any other. There have
been delays in the implementation of
new ideas and progress has been
slow and difficult.
The doctors have already accepted
that the man-machine era has arrived
and have been working hard to force
administrative advances based on
computer techniques. Already they
have found that they have to be the
leaders in creating a new administra¬
tive system a revolution comparable
with that in public health many years
ago. The era of the non-professional
approach to management at higher
levels has been relegated to the past
and it is accepted that this task needs
special and exceptional talent.
On the international scene things
have proved to be just as difficult.
Man-man relations have proved to be

much more complex to master than
man-machine problems. But the ex¬
change of information between doc¬
tors of various countries has become
much easier. The world has grown
smaller because of the impact of the
computer on instantaneous translation
and because of Improved communica¬
tions. A universal medical language
and common vocabulary is nearly
established.
The computer industry has become
as important to life in the year 2000 as
the automobile used to be. Many Indi¬
viduals in society are engaged in
producing and servicing computers,
while others develop systems of com¬
munications and expand the range of
commands and controls.
As well as being used in the health
service, computers have had their
impact on leisure time, for personal
computer education in many subjects
has led to an overall advance in
human knowledge. This has had its
impact on the medical services, for
many patients have had the benefit of
health education using special com¬
puter programmes of instruction.
Also the general level of medical
knowledge has been considerably
improved by. better instruction at
school and in the health centres using
computer techniques. The increased
awareness and knowledge of the prob¬
lems of preventing disease have made
it possible to educate patients to alter
their habits so that they lead healthier
and fuller lives.
Preservation of mental and emo¬
tional well-being has become a major
objective in health services. Computer
techniques have enabled man to
explore mental mechanisms and emo¬
tional problems further, once a proper
vocabulary was accepted. Much more
information about the inheritance and
acquisition of emotional traits through¬
out life has been obtained using
computers to record and analyse the
large amount of data available.
Doctors and nurses still advise,
comfort and treat their patients. The
mysteries of disease have not all
vanished and many difficult problems
remain. Yet the computer has proved
an essential tool in dealing with the
many details which would otherwise
take a great deal of human labour,
reducing the economic problem of car¬
ing for the sick to measurable propor¬
tions. It is only the use of computer
techniques at an advanced level that
has made advances in health services
possible without increasing national
expenditure and ultimately the burden
on everyone's budget.
