1 The African epicentre
A slow march f o r w a rd
w Damien Rwegera
In the eye of the global Aids epidemic,Africa has no choice but to
o rganize a massive, m u l t i - p ronged prevention campaign which mobilizes
the broadest range of players
The Aids epidemic raging in sub-Saharan A f ri c a
is one of the wo rst plagues of recent centuri e s.
The region has only a tenth of the wo r l d ’s
p o p u l at i o n , but is home to two-thirds of the total
number of people with HIV/Aids.Two-thirds of
those infected in 1998 live in the region and the
s i t u ation is “out of control” in some countri e s ,a c c o r-
ding to UNAIDS.
Sub-Saharan A f rica is the poorest region of the
p l a n e t , a fact which deepens the cri s i s. In this
c o n t e x t ,p r e vention is the only way out and to dat e ,
it has been glaringly inadequat e .H owe ve r , the qua-
l i fied success of preve n t i ve measures in some A f ri c a n
c o u n t ries demonstrates that actions can be as effec-
tive in stemming the crisis there as anywhere else.
The main problem lies in cultural attitudes to
i l l n e s s , pain and deat h . A f ricans tend to regard
disease not as something phy s i o l o gical but as the
result of social or religious fa c t o rs , such as a curs e ,
poisoning or divine punishment.
More than any other disease, Aids is associa-
ted with death and sex. With sperm and vaginal
fluids. It is passed on by blood and a mother’s
milk. All this gives it powerful symbolism while
making it a veritable taboo leading people to go
so far as to deny its existence. Out of derision,
some young people in francophone countries say
that Sida, the French acronym for the disease,
stands for Syndrome Invented to Discourage
Lovers (in French). They are not convinced by
scientific explanations of the disease especially
after the bogus reasons trumpeted at the begin-
ning of the epidemic: namely that A f ricans we r e
responsible for spreading the disease because they
“had sex with green monkeys”. A f ricans responded
in kind, claiming that “Aids comes from white
p e o p l e , especially white women who kiss their dogs
and sleep in the same bed with them”.
The main goal of preventive education is to
fight such ignorance and fantasies. The second
goal—to explain how to protect against it—runs
up against a similar problem of perception:
condoms are a “white people’s thing”. Moreover,
they are so expensive that sometimes a person has
to choose between buying something to eat or
having safe sex. For an African earning about $50
a month,paying nearly 20 cents for four condoms
is out of the question.
The effectiveness of preve n t i ve education has
to take into account these cultural perceptions and
m i s u n d e rstandings and respect social stru c t u r e s. I n
A f ri c a , e ven in cities, adolescents just cannot talk
to their parents about sex. Such discussion is limited
to people of their own age and sex.So Aids educa-
tion must follow suit: wo m e n , men and teenagers
each have to be approached in different ways.
Adults have to drastically change acquired
h a b i t s.Te e n a g e rs have to be persuaded to adopt safe
sexual habits, a much easier task.Yet this is a long-
t e rm job operating on three leve l s — awa r e n e s s ,i n f o r-
mation and education.
Despite meagre resources, A f rican countri e s
h ave made gr e at efforts to raise awareness and
spread inform at i o n . Po s t e rs and radio are the favo u-
red methods. Pe r f o rming arts presentations and
advertising are also often used. Experience shows
t h at condom sales increase in the ten days follow i n g
an awareness campaign. But these campaigns must
happen more frequently to be effective because repe-
tition is the key.
Reaching young people
in hierarchical societies
E d u c ating young people is still the main chal-
lenge because they are the chief victims of A i d s.
Around half of the newly-infected people wo r l d w i d e
are between the ages of 15 and 24. In 1998, 90 per
cent of the wo r l d ’s infected people under 15 lived in
sub-Saharan A f rica where there is a tendency to
engage in sexual relations at a relat i vely young age.
These relations are often forced, with 12 and 13-
year-old girls often the victims of sexual abu s e .

B i o é t h i q u e : la tentation de l’enfant parfaitGetting youth hr ugh the Aids crisis
The world spends $1.5
billion each year on
Aids prevention.
Pa r a d o x i c a l l y, o n l y
$200 million a year are
spent in sub-Saharan
A f r i c a , which has the
highest concentration
of HIV carriers. A f r i c a n
states provide 10 per
cent of this amount.
This is a mark of their
p o v e r t y, but also a
mark of their
i n s u f fic i e n t
commitment to a
prevention policy

Schools would seem to be the ideal place to
reach youth and most countries have at last inclu-
ded preve n t i ve education in the school curri c u l u m
(see pp. 3 0 - 3 1 ) . But in sub-Saharan A f ri c a ,a b o u t
t wo-thirds of all pri m a ry school-age children and
80 per cent of secondary school-age children do not
go to school.So while schools must be part of pre-
ve n t i o n , it will take some time before they have a
real impact. In A f ri c a , more than any other regi o n ,
the only way to attack the epidemic is to mobilize
all the major actors in society at eve ry leve l — t h e
g ove rn m e n t , civil society, local communities and
foreign aid sources.The higher placed they are, t h e
gr e ater impact they will have gi ven the fact that A f ri-
can societies are so hierarchical.
At the top are those with political powe r.T h e y
bear considerable responsibility for the spread of
the pandemic.Their only excuse for inaction is that
the continent is beset with terrible problems. I n
c o u n t ries at wa r ,Aids is hardly a pri o ri t y.And when
t h e r e ’s no wa r ,p ove rty is people’s main concern —
not A i d s. After all, the disease has never come up
as an issue at election time.
The self-criticism of the continent’s heav y-
we i g h t , South A f ri c a , has had quite an impact. P r e-
sident Thabo Mbeki publicly admitted when he
launched the Partnership Against Aids project on
October 9, 1998,that “for too long we have closed
our eyes as a nation, hoping that it was not really
true”, while “every day another 1,500 South Afri-
cans were infected in South A f ri c a .” He appealed to
young people and to the population at large to use
condoms.
A campaign will obviously not work unless the
b attle against Aids is a top pri o rity for gove rn m e n t s
and gi ven ongoing at t e n t i o n .This has happened
in Uganda which has been the most successful A f ri-
can country in terms of Aids prevention.The ini-
t i at i ve for the all-out battle came from President
Yowe ri Musewe n i , who understood the extent of
the disease from the day he came to power in 1986:
out of about 60 army officers sent for military trai-
ning in Cuba,where Aids tests are compulsory, 20
were HIV- p o s i t i ve .Without further ado, he ear-
marked funds for a large-scale national prevention
c a m p a i g n . Uganda has since made considerable
g a i n s. For example, b e t ween 1989 and 1995, t h e
p r o p o rtion of teenage girls (between 15 and 19)
who remained virgins increased from 26 per cent
to 46 per cent.They had the courage to refuse sexual
relations.
In Senegal, p r e vention has also been boosted by
HIV/Aids in sub-Saharan A f r i c a

1998, the government of Côte d’Ivoire earmarked
$1.6 million for a prevention campaign and recently
the president set up a nationwide fund,containing
an equal sum for taking care of the ill.This repre-
sents a huge amount of money in Africa.
B i l ateral and multilateral aid agencies are more
likely to help countries which make their own fin a n-
cial commitments to preve n t i o n .B e yond that ,i n t e r-
n ational organizations like UNAIDS,WHO and
UNESCO can and must convince African leaders of
the extent of the problem. In 1996, the countries of
A f rica as a whole, except for Botswa n a , K e nya ,
M a l awi and Uganda, spent less than $1 million each
on Aids prevention.
S p i ritual leaders and traditional chiefs, w i d e l y
respected and obeyed across the continent, r e p r e-
sent another key set of actors. Since the epidemic
s t a rt e d , r e l i gion has hindered rather than helped
the fight against A i d s. A devout Catholic will not
use a condom if he is told it is a sin,any more than
a Muslim will if the imam does not even deign to
talk to him about Aids.
The lessons learned from a conference on
Aids held in Dakar (Senegal) in 1997 are revea-
ling. About 300 participants from Africa, Europe
and the Middle East, represented the two main
r e l i gions of those regions—Islam and
Christianity. Just getting people together to talk
about such a delicate topic was an achievement.
After some stormy discussions, everyone agreed
that Aids was a disease and had to be viewed in
strictly medical terms. If it did not remove all the
obstacles to prevention campaigns, the conferen-
ce at least managed to persuade participants to
stop opposing the mere idea of them. Across the
continent, religious leaders are now starting to
join the fight against Aids—for example, Caritas
International, one of the world’s biggest networks
of NGOs, as well as the group Christians and
Aids and Uganda’s Islamic Medical Association
(see p. 33) have become involved.
With doctors powerless to cure or effectively
treat the disease, people are turning to the sym-
bolic authority of the ancestors, embodied by tra-
ditional chiefs. They are directly concerned by
preventive education because some customs run
the risk of spreading Aids—such as marrying the
sister of one’s late wife or the brother of one’s
dead husband and taking part in certain ceremo-
nies which involve washing the dead.There is an
alternative to every custom, as long as the head of
the family accepts it. If the traditional chiefs were
to decide to do more to help prevention, they
could speed up the process of changing certain
practices.
Risky customs
Equally formidable are the traditional healers
and practitioners , who have a leading part to play
since most A f ricans consult them. N i g e ria has
700,000 such healers but only 20,000 doctors for
120 million inhabitants. I nvolving the healers in the
fight against Aids not only draws on their prestige
but also lessens the harm they can do: namely by
admitting the disease exists and claiming they can
heal it.Va rious projects have targeted healers by pro-
viding them with training and instilling them with
a gr e ater sense of responsibility. For example, i n
1995-96 the Aids Fo u n d ation of South A f rica was in
contact with about half a million healers and 650
a s s o c i at i o n s , all of which admitted that even if they
could sometimes treat the symptoms, they could
not cure the disease. Before that , 75 per cent of
them said the opposite.
The Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers
Association, with 50,000 members, has over the
past decade run about 500 workshops which deal
with all social groups (teenagers, polygamous
families, healers, traditional chiefs) as well as
members of parliament. The aim is to make
people aware of the dangers involved in traditio-
nal rites such as circumcision, female excision
and cures involving incision.
P r e ve n t i ve education in A f rica remains the
only way of combating A i d s , but prevention must
not exclude medical treat m e n t .A f ricans cannot be
told forever that “medicine is for others bu t
condoms are for yo u ” . There is no underestima-
ting the importance of a French initiat i ve in May
1 9 9 8 , which was favourably received by the G8
(Group of Eight Industrialized Nat i o n s ) , and led
to the creation of the Intern ational T h e r a p e u t i c
S o l i d a rity Fund. S u p p o rted by rich countri e s , t h e
fund aims to make anti-Aids drug treat m e n t s
more available in developing countri e s. B e t t e r
access to treatment will not only help save pat i e n t s
but reinforce prevention effort s. E x p e rience has
s h own that infected people with no hope of treat-
ment are more likely to have unprotected sex than
those with medical support . n
