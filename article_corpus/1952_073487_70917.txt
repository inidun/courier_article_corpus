PEACE CANNOT BE BUILT IN
A HUNGRY WORLD
THE General Assembly under-
) stands clearly that world peace
cannot be built upon a founda-
tion of hunger and misery,
for the Assembly has itself emphasis-
ed this in 1946 and upon other occa-
sions. The Economic and Social
Council, in its last two major ses-
sions, has placed the need to improve
the food situation in the very fore-
front of the world's economic and
social problems.
We need to continue measuring the
size and the growth of the job to be
done, but we need talk at no great
length about how important it is.
The overwhelming and immediate
need is to find and do the concrete
and effective things that will pro-
duce more food and bring it to the
world's hungry,
The size of the problem is enor-
mous, but not too vast to grasp. It
is growing larger, but not at a rate
which we cannot overtake, provided
only that we begin to act.
The League of Nations in 1935-37
found that half the world's popula-
tion suffered from malnutrition and
dnder-nutrition. The post-war situa-
tion was somewat worse. In 1946,
FAO's World Food Survey found
that if only reasonably adequate diets
were to be available, the world's food
production would need to be increas-
ed 90 per cent by 1960, and 120 per
cent by 1970. A further survey is
now being made.
Nineteen-sixty is only eight years
away. Since 1935-38, world popula-
tion has increased by 12 per cent,
world food production by only 9 per
cent. The greater increase in food
production occurred in parts of the
world already well fed. Upon a per
capita basis, the world has less food
available than before the war.
Furthermore, present trends in a
number of cuntries indicate that

tional trade a-' likely to decrease

not only for normal food-importing
countries, but also for countries
which usually have not had to im-
port food but which today find them-
selves urgently in need of imported
supplies.
The cruel famine which millions in
India are now suffering, in spite of
great efforts by their government, re-
veals how dangerously thin is the
margin between bare subsistence and
actual death. Nor do the famine
headlines reveal the millions of hu-
man beings who are today hungry,
weak, inefficient and doomed to
early death. To the world's shame,
this is so usual that it is not news.
What has to be done is known.
During the last six years, in FAO's
meetings, the ministers, administra-
tors and technicians of 65 countries
have reached substantial agreement.
Numerous studies by our secretariat
have contributed the factual bases.
These six years have brought pro-
gress, but not enough. Within the
limited means of FAO, now substan-
tially increased by the Expanded
Technical Assistance Programme, we
are now giving some degree of direct
assistance to more than 40 countries,
and in many fields..
In the people's hands
THE heart of the problem lies inwhat governm nts can and will
do. FAO can help them, but we
cannot do what governments cannot
or will not do. International advice
and assistance are of little good
unless governments themselves take
vigorous action, sometimes even
drastic action.
The technical steps that need to be
taken are known clearly enough for
all parts of the world, even though
often there are not yet enough train-
ed technicians But while trained
technicians are indispensable, they
cannot themselves add one mouthful
of food to the world's supply.
Food is not produced in government
ministries.
Only the people who farm the land
and fish the waters can produce
more food. It is in their hands that
the giant power of modern techno-
logy must be placed. And this can
be done only if the necessary eco-
nomic and social conditions are
created.
These conditions include, in many
countries, improvements in land
tenure and other rural institutions,
the provision of credit, the avail-
ability of tools and equipment,
improved seed, and fertilizers.
Above all, he must have the
incentive to produce, and must feel
that, if he improves his methods, he
can increase his crops and better his
condition. This knowledge must be
brought to the individual farmer on
his individual farm, in practical
ways that he will understand and
accept, even over the barriers of
ignorance and illiteracy.
To create these conditions and
services, which alone can unlock the
power of technology and give us
the hope of feeding the world better,
will require a great intensification
of effort by governments and by
their international agencies. All
experience shop s that large expendi-
tures by governments for these
purposes will be profitable invest-
ments. The greater amount of the
expenditures will need to be internal.
The international agencies can only
supply the little leavening. And the
effort must be all along the front,
for food production is locked to
health-and both to education.
At this point, we need simple,
practical, positive
action. How sim-
ple and practical
the steps to pro-
gress can be is
illustrated by one
of our projects
in Afghanistan, where the govern-
ment asked FAO's help in its pro-
gramme to improve the tools and
methods of farmers. In village
demonstrations, FAO's practical spe-
cialists in small farm tools have
shown farmers how one man with a
scythe can mow as much hay as 13
men with primitive sickles. Scythes
can be made by village blacksmiths.
No clearer voice
THE General Assembly has animportant part to play. There
is no assembly in the world
with a louder and clearer voice than
yours. Not only do ministers and
technicians listen when you speak,
but rulers and peoples. For this
reason, FAO has warmly welcomed
the initiative taken by the General
Assembly in 1950 regarding problems
of land tenure.
If the dreadful gap between the
hungry and the fed continues to
widen, it will, like the fatal crack
in the foundation of a building,
forever threaten the stability of the
structure of world peace which this
Assembly is trying to build for the
peoples of all the world.
I know that the General Assembly
is convinced of the extreme se-
riousness of the world food problems
and of the urgency of national and
international action. If you speak
for action, you will strongly reinforce
the efforts which, I am sure, the
FAO Conference will make to set
action in motion in each individual
country toward the conquest of
hunger, enemy of peace.
