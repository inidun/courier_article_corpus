ke Fertö: hallow
waters steeped in wildlife
by France Bequette
From each side of the grassy
causeway dominating the vast
expanse of water a gaggle of wading
hirds a white heron, several grey
herons, two purple herons slowly
took off, their long legs dangling
beneath their bodies. Ahead, the
horizon was blocked by a thick cur¬
tain of windswept reeds. A boat was
drawn up on a tiny beach beside a
canal. Surprisingly, it had a petrol
engine and belonged to a fisherman.
Surprisingly, because we were on the
shore of Lake Fertö, in Hungary, a
UNESCO biosphere reserve which is
also a National Park where fishing
and all motorboats except those with
electric, engines are banned. But this
particular fisherman was a very old
man who only fished in the summer
and used mercifully inefficient tra¬
ditional methods. lie would die if
suddenly ordered to give up his
hobby.
The lake was concealed by the
reeds. To get a good view of it we had

to clamber up a 16-metre-high
watchtower, a remnant of the iron
curtain that was dismantled in 1990.
This grim frontier between the com¬
munist world and the West, which
claimed the lives of thousands of vic¬
tims, here consisted of two electric
fences enclosing a tract of land from
3 to 5 km wide. But as Hungarian
forestry expert Attila Fersch told
me, "This no-man's-land was very
good for wildlife, which flourished."
Nowadays projects for airports, golf
courses and leisure centres abound
and are not always compatible with
nature conservation. The lake is a
major attraction for holiday-makers.
An ornithologist's paradise
It is an amazing lake. It has two
nationalities. The northern four-
fifths (the Neusiedler See) are Aus¬
trian, the southern fifth (Fertö To)
Hungarian. ] t is 35 km long and from
7 to 15 km wide with an average
depth of 60 em. Nowhere deeper
than 1.80 m, it is fed only by two
streams and rainwater. The water
has a high mineral salt content and is
opalescent, except at the edges
where it is dark brown because of
decomposing aquatic plants. Lake
Fertö was formed at the end of the
ice age. The Romans called it Lacus
peiso, and in the first century A.D.
Pliny the Elder already noted that it
periodically dried up an occur¬
rence which happened most recently
in 1865. The surrounding landscape
is a blend of eleared forest, pas-
tureland and a network of drainage
canals some 250 kilometres long.
The canals are used to flood the land
when necessary and to provide access
to the lake. Without them, at least
on the Hungarian side, it would be
impossible to get through the reeds,
which grow in a belt up to 5 or 6
kilometres wide.
The Park was declared a Ramsar
Convention1 zone in 1989. Its reeds,
muddy ponds and open water are a
paradise for birds; 260 species have
been recorded. Large numbers of
egrets, herons, geese and grebe nest
there, and it is a stopping off point
for thousands of migrating geese, as
well as storks and peregrine falcons.
Thirty-six species offish live in the
lake. Frogs, toads, reptiles and
insects abound. There are 1,513
recorded species of plants, some of
whieh grow only on alkaline soil, like
the dwarf aster (Aster tripolium),
which covers the ground with a
mauve carpet.
The Park has five functions: nature
conservation, land management,
research, environmental education and
eeotourism. However, its managers are
having a hard time coping with fund¬
ing problems. As a result of cuts in
public expenditure researchers can
no longer count on state funding and
have had to look for other sources. All
the same, the Ministry ofAgriculture
is providing the reserve with financial
aid in order to save three species of
domestic animal from extinction: the
water buffalo, the Hungarian grey
cow whose number has risen from
282 in 1960 to 2,500 todayand
the Racka sheep. To tend the mead-

ows the reserve employs men from
neighbouring villages to scythe the
grass, which is then closely cropped
by cattle. Short grass is essential for
the survival of small mammals like
the suslik (Citellus citellus), a ground
squirrel, without which the
extremely rare Saker falcon (Falco
cherrug) would have disappeared.
This is a good example of a conserva¬
tion chain at work. Permission to har¬
vest the reeds (Phragmites australis)
for roofing thatch is granted to pri¬
vate companies from December to
February. The reeds attract birds,
some of which prefer the young
shoots, others the older plants.
Surely poaching must be a prob¬
lem in this natural aviary? Apparently

not. "Hunting is not a tradition here,"
Attila told us. "We've got only two
rangers for a patchwork ofprotected
areas: a core zone of 3,300 hectares,
a buffer zone with the same area and
a 5,913-hectare transitional zone."
The reception centre for visitors
and researchers on the Fertö reserve
is an extraordinarily beautiful
thatched building of wood and con¬
crete with residential and study
facilities. Its design, by two Hun¬
garian architects, is inspired by the
feather of the great egret viewed
through a microscope. Photos of the
reserve's plant and animal life are
displayed in galleries. Schools and
groups of teachers come to the cen¬
tre for training courses.
A few kilometres away, the Aus-
trians have also recently built a
reception centre on the shore with a
tall observation tower. Here the bios¬
phere reserve is known as the
Neusiedler See-Seewinkel. In con¬
trast to what we saw on our visit to
the reserve on the Arizona (U.S.A. )-
Mexican border (see the UNESCO
Courier, September 1996), there is
hardly any sign of a frontier between
the two countries that share the
lake.
Joint management
Hungarian and Austrian representa¬
tives on the management committee
meet every month and work together.
Aloys Lang, who is responsible for
communications, explained that the
problems are different. "All the land
here is privately owned," he said.
"We have to rent it from 1,200 own¬
ers after assessing how much they
might earn from farming. It costs us
28 million schillings a year."
The Austrian side of the bios¬
phere reserve consists of three zones,
two along the Neusiedler See and
the third in Lange Lacke, a swampy

area to the south-west covering a
total of 7,600 hectares. There is no
industry around the lake, but farm¬
ing and grape-growing both prosper.
In summer the lakeside villages are
visited by thousands of holiday-
makers who love fishing and (non-
motorized!) aquatic sports. It is eas¬
ier to reach the lake on the Austrian
side because there are not so many
reeds, and the water is cleaner
because sewage pipes have been
widely installed. Because the sur¬
rounding land is fiat, no pesticide
run-off reaches the lake. There are
no rangers. Guides accompany visi¬
tors, who are only admitted to the
Park on weekdays for lengthy hikes
on asphalted roads built for that
purpose. People in the vicinity
receive a quarterly newsletter from
Aloys Lang entitled Geshnatter
("Cackle"), of which 6,000 copies
are printed. It is a mine of informa¬
tion on nature and local life.
On one of the roads we came
upon a strange sight. A man was sit¬
ting in his car pointing a shotgun sky¬
wards. "Here hunting is still legal
until 1999," Aloys Lang explained,
"when a contract made prior to the
creation of the reserve expires, but
only for local people with hunting
licences." When he heard this story,
Attila Fresch burst out laughing,
"The geese aren't crazy. They know
they've got nothing to worry about on
the Hungarian side!" A single logo
unites the two park reserves: two
red geese facing a green goose on a
white background symbolize the
Austrian and Hungarian flags and a
shared determination to preserve the
region's wildlife. I
