Monkey-hoots and banana peels fire down on the
black British footballer who commits the sin of
missing a goal.Reprehensibly racist behav i o u r ,s ay
the pundits,but these are the isolated occurrences of
a few rotten apples.A look past these extremists sup-
posedly reveals an arena in UK society—the world of
s p o rt—where eve ryone has an equal opportunity to
s u c c e e d .B a rri e rs of colour and class cannot possibly
be found on the track, it is argued, where the stop-
watch is the ultimate judge.According to UK A t h l e-
t i c s , the gove rnment body promoting track and fie l d
s p o rt s , 24 per cent of top at h l e t e s , meaning those
who receive grants on the basis of perform a n c e , are of
A f rican or Caribbean ori gi n ,e ven though they com-
pose just two per cent of the UK populat i o n .I n d e e d ,
blacks represent 48 per cent of these top at h l e t e s
who are focusing on their training and not simulta-
neously pursuing academics.
As Robin Phillips of UK Athletics say s , this high
r e p r e s e n t ation would  generally be seen as a sign of
social progr e s s.Yet the rosy picture darkens with the
q u e s t i o n : w hy are so many blacks running? Pe r h a p s
because they don’t have the same chances of succee-
ding in other areas, s ays Ben Carri n g t o n , a sociologi s t
at the Unive rsity of Bri g h t o n , widely respected in
B ritish academic circles for his research on racism in
s p o rt and who is now editing a book on the subject.
This is not to suggest that blacks are genetically gi f t e d
for sport—a proposition Carrington vehemently rejects

as being both racist and scientifically unfounded. I n s-
tead he points to the ways in which stereotypes seep
into the lives of young blacks and reinforce the socio-
economic reasons leading them to pursue at h l e t i c s.
At the age of 24, Julian Golding is one of Br i-
t a i n ’s hopefuls, becoming the Commonwealth 200-
metre champion last year. From an early age on,
Golding knew he was fast but didn’t dream of beco-
ming a champion. He was raised to focus on edu-
cation, not sport, as “the way out” of the working
class life of his parents, Jamaican immigrants who
arrived in the 1960s.
Missing idols
So Golding studied hard at school, filling his free
time with tennis, track and trampoline activities. B u t
at 16, his  school director took him aside for a chat .
“Why not pursue running as a career? You’ve got
talent.” The same encouragement came from his
p hysical education (PE) teacher. There was no
mention of his academic opportunities.
Golding began weighing his options. “I was a
better tennis player than a spri n t e r ,” he say s , “ bu t
there was no-one to look up to. No black tennis
i d o l s. So I thought about trying to be the firs t ”u n t i l
his first visit to the local tennis club.“The courts we r e
packed but there wa s n ’t one black pers o n . I didn’t feel
c o m f o rt a b l e . I started asking about the subscri p t i o n
and coaching fees,” s ays Golding, c a l c u l ating the
expense for his parents who had five kids to support .
“I thought, ‘No way ! ’ And walked out.”
He started training at a local track, focusing on
black idols, like Linford Chri s t i e , the 1992 Olympic



colour
100-metre champion.“You’ve got to have a vision
of success. Linford made it and he’s from the same
neck of the woods in west London as me.”
G o l d i n g ’s experience is typical, s ays Carri n g t o n .
Money, status and glamour “pull”kids into sport.
However,black kids,in particular,also experience
the “ p u s h ” of PE teachers , who may have good
intentions but inadve rtently reinforce  stereotypes.
“The (PE) teachers think that certain types of kids,
namely black kids, are going to be better off in an
athletics career,” s ays Carri n g t o n , “because they’r e
never going to make it in the world of finance or
medicine.”
Carrington points to a full body of research in
this area. One of the most recent surve y s ,c o n d u c t e d
by Sid Hayes and John Sugden of the Unive rsity of
B ri g h t o n ,i nvo l ved about 35 PE teachers in an eth-
nically mixed region of the Midlands. Over 80 per
cent of the teachers reported the “feeling that black
pupils tend to be advantaged in sport ” , which most
identified as at h l e t i c s. Almost 75 per cent at t ri-
buted their black students’ sport success to “phy-
siological reasons”.
Science and stereotypes
Golding is not shocked by the teachers ’r e s p o n s e .
On the contrary,he has learned to accept as truth the
same stereotypes of “black braw n ” . As a teenager,
Golding was falsely “taught that it is a ‘ s c i e n t i fic
fa c t ’t h at black people in general are able to move their
muscles faster than white people” because they have
special muscle fib r e s.“ S t atistics seem to prove it,” h e
s ay s.“When was the last time we saw a white spri n t e r
compete in the finals of an Olympic game? Back in
1980—almost 20 ye a rs ago.”
Yet Golding is not fully convinced by this “ m u s c l e
t h e o ry ” and welcomes Carri n g t o n ’s assertion that it
b e a rs no scientific gr o u n d i n g . When asked of any
other biological explanations for black athletic suc-
c e s s , Golding quietly mentions the “Black Body, a
t e rm that I hat e ”which refers to the stereotype of the
black muscular muscular torso of men like Linford
C h ri s t i e .The emotional edge to his voice suggests that
Golding is torn by a personal quandary. He has been
taught that blacks are gifted in athletics—a stereotype
reinforced by media images of black muscular men.
Yet he also knows that “black braw n ” is loaded with
racist ove rtones suggesting “white intelligence”.
So it is with visible relief that Golding listens as
C a rrington debunks these erroneous “b i o l o gi c a l
e x p l a n at i o n s.” The sociologist traces their roots to
the Eugenics movement of the 1920s and 30s,
which ori gi n ated in North A m e rica and later spread
throughout Europe. The aim was to produce a
genetically superior population,which is linked to
the notion of a hierarchy of separate races in which
blacks were placed on the bottom, s ays Carri n g t o n .
To reinforce this ranking, anthropologists tried to
define the model white and black male by measu-
ring and comparing their va rious body part s — e a r-
l o b e s ,n o s e s , limb lengths and so on.“These studies
were inherently racist and had very little scientific
validation behind them,” says Carrington.* UN E S C O C o u r i e r j o u r n a l i s t
Above, Britain’s Julian Golding

semi-final of the 200 metres,

(Hungary) in 1998.

The Eugenics movement disappeared after the
Holocaust in World War II. H owe ve r , C a rri n g t o n
finds some of the same “ b i o l o gical arguments” a n d
i d e o l o gical conceptions emerging today with genetic
r e s e a r c h .There is, for example, a misconception in
some sectors of the public that scientists will prove
racial differences. “ To d ay we know that there are
about 100,000 genes in the human body and yet less
than ten of them are related to skin colour,”s ays Car-
ri n g t o n . “Obviously there are va ri ations betwe e n
gr o u p s ,” but these differences are linked to geo-
gr a p hy. In short , as groups migr ated around the
wo r l d , people adapted to their physical surr o u n-
dings and passed those changes on to their descen-
d a n t s.
A gene for playing darts or snooker
Still the idea persists that scientists will one day
d i s c over a gene which makes blacks run fa s t .“ T h e n
there must be a gene among white working-class Bri-
tish males for throwing darts or playing snooker,”
jokes Carrington. “It’s comic. No one would ever
suggest that Canadians are somehow genetically
inclined to playing ice hockey...Yet whenever you
have black success, there is a genetic argument.”
These arguments often serve to deny or reduce
the dedication and intelligence of successful black
at h l e t e s ,s ays Carri n g t o n ,p a rticularly in the media.
He does not suggest that sport commentators are
inherently racist. But Carrington does see a ten-
dency to treat black and white athletes differently.
Commentators often focus on the black athlete’s
n atural ability, he say s , while white athletes are also
praised for their intelligent strat e gies and dedicat i o n .
Golding points to a related dimension: t h e
impact on young white at h l e t e s. “If I was a 16-
year-old white student,I wouldn’t dream of going
into athletics,” he says.With the media zooming in
on black powerhouses like Linford Christie, “I’d
think that I didn’t have a hope to win.”
“With blacks dominating the sport,” Golding
senses a public “yearning for a new Roger Black”,
the English (white) 400-metre runner who won a
s i l ver medal at the 1996 Olympics.This desire is not
manifested in any overt forms of racism,says Gol -
ding, but rather through “hidden agendas.”
The “ ye a rning for the Great White Hope”
cannot be proven.But for Carrington, it is impor-
tant to note the impact of the perception that it
e x i s t s. He refers to a scenario which, he say s , i s
taken ve ry seriously by many black at h l e t e s. I m a gi n e
the following: four athletes—three black and one
white—compete for three places on a team.The firs t
t wo clock ve ry fast times and take their places.T h e
other two are close, but the white athlete is slightly
slower.Who makes the team? 
“ You have to be above and beyond eve ryone else,
so that there isn’t any argument not to pick you,”
s ays Carri n g t o n . “But that kind of skews the picture
of black athletic success. People don’t see the ave-
rage black athletes because they don’t make the
teams.This in turn leads people to say, ‘See,there
must be something special about them.’” n
