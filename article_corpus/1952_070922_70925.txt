T N1850, the wifeof a Puritan
clergyman, Mrs.
Harriet Beecher
Stowe, was chal-
lenged by her
sister-in-law,
Mrs. Edward Bee-
cher, to"write
something that
would make this
whole nation feel
what an accursed
thing slavery is."
The answer to
that challenge
was Uncle Tom's
Cabin ; or Life
Among the Lowly
which appeared
serially in the
National Era, an
anti-slavery
newspaper of
Washington, D. C.
in 1851. It was
published in book form on March
20, 1852-one hundred years ago
- in two volumes, with a woodcut
of a Negro cabin as the frontispiece
(see photo at top of page).
Although no-one had expected
the work to be popular or success-
ful (the Boston publisher who had
contracted for the book rights pro-
tested that she was making the
story too long), ten thousand copies
were sold in less than a week and
within a year sales in the United
States amounted to some 300, 000
copies. In England, where the Brit-
ish slave trade had been abolished
in 1833, the book swept across the
country. Circulation reached a
million and a half by the end of the
first year in a triumph of pirated
edition.
Although hastily written, its
drama and emotional ardour gave
it wide appeal. It was soon trans-
lated into more than 20 languages,
and presented countless times on
the stage and in the cinema. As
late as 1890, sixteen separate com-
panies of actors were taking Uncle
Ton's Cabin from town to town in
the United States, presenting the
play in tents, and it was shown on
the American stage every year until
the 1930's.
Soon after the book reached Eur-
ope in 1852, a French critic, M.
John Lemoine, wrote in the Jour-
nal des Debates :"here is a little
book which in a few hundred pages
contains all the elements of a revo-
lution... It will do more for the
freeing of the Negroes than all the
speeches, all the sermons, or all the
treaties and crusades have done up
until now... It is perhaps the most
profound blow ever delivered
against a blasphemous institution-
slavery ; and this blow has been de-
livered by a wo-
man."
Few books, in-
deed, have had a
more direct and
powerful influ-
ence on America-
and on the rest
of the world-
than Uncle Tom's
6'abtH. By its vi-
vi d descriptions
of Negro suffering
and oppression, it
stirred up a
whirlwind of anti-
slavery agitation
in the North.
More and more
Ã¬\'ortherners came
to believe that
Southern masters
were generally
eruel to their
slaves. Although
slaves in general
were fairly well
treated, th. North
became convinced
that the opposite
was true. Pro-
bably no other
book in the his-
tory of the United
States ever arous-
ed such a storm
of anger. It serv-
ed as one of the
important forces
in bringing about
the Civil War.
Harriet Beecher
Stowe had not
foreseen the
storm of wrath
which Uncle tom
was to arouse. In
the South, slave-
holders condemned it as extremelv
unfair, and her very name was
hated. A cousin living in Georgia
wrote that she feared rev, riving
letters with her name on the outside
envelope. The Southern Literary
Dessert'gear declared the book a
"criminal prostitution of the high
functions of the imagination,"
adding that the author had"placed
herself without the pale of kindly
treatment at the hands of Southern
criticism."
Mrs. Stowe, however, apparently
had a fondness for the South.
While she hated it for upholding
slavery, she portrayed its atmo-
sphere with sympathy. For this
the Abolitionists criticized her,
affirming that the book showed too
many of the favourable aspects of
slavery. From all sides, therefore,
she was attacked and the accuracy
of her facts questioned. Her reply
to this criticism was A Key to uncle
Tom's Cabin, published in 1853.
From the popular point of view this
book was a total failure. In 1856,
she wrote a second anti-slavery
novel, Dred : A Tale of the Dismal
Swamp. This too failed to achieve
any popularity, except in England
where 100, 000 copies were sold in
less than a month. Today, the
book is practically unknown.
The slavery question which rent
the abolitionist North and slave-
holding South was, of course, no-
thing new when Mrs. Stowe's book
appeared in 1852. In the 18th
century, many Southerners had
condemned slavery in principle and
tolerated it only as a temporary
measure. Washington and Jefferson,
both slave-owners, were hostile to
slavery, while John Randolph had
freed his. Two events occurred,
however, which
were destined to
transform the in-
teT'Pt""r : 1. ! ti'1S
of the South : the
invention of the
cotton gin in 1793,
which revolution-
ized the cotton
industry and
brought with it
an enormous in-
ftux of slave
labour from
Africa ; and the
law of 1808 which
stopped further
importation
of slaves, thereby
placing a prem-
ium on existing
slave labour.
Thus the South
came to defend
slavery with heat-
ed passion as one
of the mainstays
of its existence.
Planters failed to
see anythina
odious about slav-
ery in the same
way as the in-
dustrialists of the
. North were later
unmoved by the
e v i I s of child
labour. Apologists
of slavery preach-
ed the doctrine of
"a natural and
divine order"as-
serting.'that men
should reduce one
another to slavery
is part of nature
in the same way
Harriet Beecher
Stowe was the
first American
write to take the
Negro seriously
and to conceive a
novel with the
black man as the
hero. Although
to some people
nowadays Uncle
Tom's Cabin may
, eem of little more
than historical
interest, it never-
theless remains
as one of the
world's most fam-
JUS novels. It
played a great
part in arousing
public opinion ; it
: ertainly hastened
the abolition of
slavery..
as it is the natural order of things
that animals eat one another."One
apologist, a Mr. Harper, even went
so far as to declare ;"It is true
that the slave has no hope of
improving his lot ; but as he owns
nothing, he has nothing to lose."
But it was the Fugitive Slave
Law of 1850 that really aroused
Northerners to the evils of slavery.
This law not only gave federal
authorities the right to arrest fugi-
tive slaves, but made it a crime to
help a Negro to escape. And no
proof was needed to make an arrest.
It was this new slave law that set
off the spark of intense abolitionist
feeling in Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Before that, her letters confirm her
son's statement that for many years
she"was anti-slavery in her sym-
pathies, but she was not a declared
abolitionist."Her father, a Calvin-
ist pastor, was one of the links in
the"Underground Railroad."His
. : iIJ. minary was a hotbed of anti-
"' ; ;,.. cry sentiment ; and one of the
most extreme advocates of Aboli-
tionism, Theodore D. Weld, was an-
early student there. For 18 years
she lived in Cincinnatti, Ohio. Just
across the Ohio River lay slave
territory and visits to plantations
quickened Harriet Beecher's hatred
of slavery. Her husband was also
strongly hostile to slavery. Together
they later helped many fugitive
slaves to escape to safety. Her
brother, Edward Beecher, fanned
her sentiments on slavery to white
heat. From his Boston pulpit he
thundered against the Fugitive
Slave Law, and it was his wife who
wrote to Mrs. Stowe to.'write
something that would make this
whole nation feel what an accursed
thing slavery is."
