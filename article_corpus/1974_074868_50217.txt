[ CELAND'S glaciers with
their snow-white caps against the
blue sky have always been acclaimed
for their majestic beauty and extolled
in many a poem. The Icelandic nation
has certainly got to know their many
different aspects during eleven cen¬
turies of cohabitation.
It even appears that the Icelanders
were in fact the first to understand the
development and nature of glaciers.
If the material written about glaciers
in Icelandic had been published in a
world language, some of the findings
based on the studies of local farmers
would have been considered a remark¬
able contribution to the glaciology of
the time.
There is no doubt that some of the
settlers from Norway were familiar
with the glaciers in their homeland;
and in Iceland some made their new
homes very close to glaciers. In
many places routes between farms
ran along the edges of glaciers or even
across them.
As is well known, a glacier is a
mass of ice, covering mountains or
valleys all the year round, the ice
being formed naturally from compact¬
ed snow. It is evident that a glacier
will be formed only if more snow falls
during winter than is melted away
during the summer.
It has been calculated that glaciers
cover 11,800 sq. km., or about 11.5 per
cent of the area of Iceland. Icelandic
glaciers vary in size from the biggest,
the Vatnajökull ice plateau which
covers about 8,400 sq. km., to minor
glaciers of less than 30 sq. km. In
area.
Why do glaciers not grow higher
each year since a 4 to 8 metre thick
snow layer may be added on to. the
ice cap in a single year? As Sveinn
Pálsson discovered and explained
quite correctly in the 18th century, the
reason is that although ice is hard and
fragile, it has considerable plasticity
like pitch.
Glaciers have their discharge like
most lakes. Glacier ice is softer
than a layer of sea ice, and therefore
glacier ice moves slowly under the
pressure of its own ice caps from the
mountains down valleys where the
temperature is higher and melting is
more rapid than in the highlands.
Air temperature falls by about 0.5 to
0.7 °C. on the average for every
100 metres we go up in altitude above
sea level. Hence, there is often a
snowfall in the mountains when it is
raining in the lowlands. Each area
has an equilibrium at a certain altitude
above sea level. Above that altitude
snow will accumulate year after year
forming a glacier, but below that same
altitude the winter snow will melt
away during summer.
An ice cap, therefore, does not
increase its height if the climate
remains constant, even though more
snow is accumulated there every year
than the warm season can melt away.
Further down the ice cap is drained by
broad lobe-shaped outlets or by valley
glaciers. Here more and more of the
ice is melted and at the glacier's front
the movement and the melting is
balanced.
This equilibrium, however, can be'
disturbed. If some years of unusually
heavy snowfall are followed by cold
summers, an outlet glacier may
advance further down the valley or on
to the lowlands before an equilibrium
is reached again. Conversely, the
snout of a glacier outlet will retreat if
several years of relatively light snow¬
fall are followed by warm summers,
and that has' been the case of Icelandic
outlet glaciers during the last few
decades.
When outlet glaciers retreat, as they
have been doing in Iceland for the
last 40 to 50 years, they considerably
transform the surrounding landscape.
Big pieces of ice may remain for some
time buried in clay and sand where the
glacier has withdrawn, and walking
may be difficult in knee-deep mud on
the top of a layer of dead ice, prevent¬
ing the water from getting away.
But vegetation reaches this new
area surprisingly quickly, even if there
is still ice underneath. In midsummer
the vegetation is often so soggy that
a man walking in it penetrates to the
ice layer.
