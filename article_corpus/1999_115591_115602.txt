Heading for stardom?

“They used to tell me sport was just for hooligans.
They deceived me.” Who did? “ E ve ryo n e .” Je a n -
Jacques Diodan, from Côte d’Ivo i r e , is bitter. A ny
little thing reopens the wo u n d , like the TV progr a m m e
a few months ago which showed the opening of a school
for street children sponsored by his compat riot Basile
B o l i . Boli was the defence pillar of Olympique Mar-
s e i l l e s , a team which, in its glory day s ,g ave France its firs t -
e ver European Champions Cup. His was a real success
s t o ry.
He and Je a n - Jacques started out in exactly the same
way. A few years apart, they played in the local teams
t h at were all the rage in Abidjan in the 1970s and
1980s. Boli was a great hulk,while Jean-Jacques was a
slight figure who became a magician when he had the
ball at his feet.
Je a n - Jacques became the darling of A b i d j a n ’s poor
s u burb of  Tr e i c h v i l l e , with his cunning dri b b l e s ,fierce vo l-
leys and brilliant opport u n i s m . All the neighbourhood
a s s o c i ations begged him to join their teams. To entice
h i m , they offered him sweets or cakes,a few hundred CFA
f r a n c s , an a b o k i (coffee with cream) or a ga r b a (a dish of
f ried fish and manioc flo u r ) .
The talent scouts of the big Abidjan clubs were also
s n i f fing around for future champions.T h at was how Boli
was discove r e d , along with others like Gadji Celi and
Youssouf Fo fa n a , the future star of Monaco.These lads
were not obsessed with turning professional.They playe d
because they liked to,because they loved being cheered by
the Sunday crowds and sometimes being carried aloft as
h e r o e s.
But it became so enjoyable in the end that they sacri-
ficed eve rything for it, s t a rting with their schoolwo r k .
Je a n - Ja c q u e s , a bright youth who had entered secondary
school when he was 11,s t a rted playing truant and skipping
c l a s s e s ,b e ginning with maths and English.His report
card summed it all up—playing hookey, bad marks and
lack of concentrat i o n .
His fat h e r , a customs officer so proud of his son
t h at he nicknamed him “the Pelé of Tr e i c h v i l l e ” , wa s
d u m b s t ru c k . He and the rest of the family knew that
only the best school leaving cert i fic at e , not a football
pitch, would ensure the boy’s future.
There were row s , punishments and beat i n g s ,
but to no avail. Jean-Jacques didn’t make a clear
choice and so ended up losing on both counts.
Sport is like a jealous woman who refuses to share
her man.If Jean-Jacques refused to devote himself
d ay and night to football, then he wo u l d n ’t become
a star and wo u l d n ’t go off to Europe to earn millions.
If he returned to school,he would just limp along.
In the end, to eve ryo n e ’s surp ri s e , he got his
leaving certificate but his marks were too poor for
him to continue in public high school.The altern a-
t i ve was pri vate schooling. But his angry fat h e r
refused to pay for that. “If you want to become a
Pelé,then go and be one,” he said sarcastically.
E ve n t u a l l y, a sympathetic elder sister who was a
journalist agreed to come up with the money. So
Je a n - Jacques continued his studies, managed to
pass his baccalaureate and even went on to earn a
degree in sociology.
But this meant nothing in a labour market ove r-
loaded with gr a d u at e s. Jo b l e s s , he lived off his fa m i l y.
His wife, with whom he had a baby, left him because
he wa s n ’t earning any money. He dreamed of emi-
gr ating to the United Stat e s — t h at he would be chosen
from thousands of others as an eligible immigr a n t
and then, in an immigr ation lottery, win the right to
actually go there. He turned once more to his sister, t o
p ay for him to learn a trade.
The fame of the Pelé of Treichville never we n t
b e yond his neighbourhood, though he is convinced he
had the talent to go furt h e r. He didn’t manage either
to get a literature doctorate which, he is equally sure,
would have opened the door to a fine career.
Meanwhile Basile Boli is a millionaire and, at 30,
Jean-Jacques Diodan is unemployed. n
