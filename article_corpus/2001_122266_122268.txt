Violence in schools: a worldw i d
In all countries, schools are magnets for strife in society. Dealing with these tensions
calls for extreme caution, for fear of making matters worse
iolence in schools is a worldwide pro-
blem:it exists in rich and poor countries
a l i k e. I t ’s chiefly a male phenomenon,
hitting a peak when boys turn 16 years
old in some countries and 13 in others.
Experts agree at least on one point:this
violence cannot be pinned to a single
c a u s e. I n s t e a d , they point to complex
patterns linked to family situations, s o c i o -
economic conditions and teaching
methods.
Tackling
segregation
But these are just indicators and do
not justify any deterministic explanations.
When researchers say that 10 to 20 per-
cent of risk factors are linked to single-
parent families, this suggests that 80 to 90
percent of such families are not the source
of any violence.A child from a black slum
area with a teenage mother or a father in
jail will not automatically be violent!
L i k e w i s e, experts say there is a “ h a r d
c o r e ”of violent children—about five per-
cent of the total.But in comparing several
schools in similar problem French neigh-
b o u r h o o d s, I ’ve found that this figure can
vary between one and 11 percent. Th e
school itself can be an aggravating factor,
through high staff turnover or “ g h e t t o
c l a s s e s ” to which poorly-performing stu-
dents are relegated. These “hard core”
groups, then,cannot be deemed “inalte-
r a b l e.” On the contrary, something can
be done about them.

Should they simply be expelled, a s
some advocate? Such a measure would
only make their segregation and sense of
exclusion worse.And they are, after all,
at the root of the whole problem. Th e
solution lies partly in developing custo-
mized projects, but most importantly, in
strengthening economic and social par-
ticipation.
To put an end to school violence, w e
need a well-established state with the
means to compensate for inequalities, a
state that tries to re-establish diversity in
neighbourhoods and schools, one that
does not give up on the notion of justice
for children,as some are demanding.
Passing the torch
We should also try to lift schools out
of their fortresses, so they do not become
the symbol of a society that excludes
p e o p l e.Projects in the Netherlands,B r a z i l
and the United States have shown that
schools can be vibrant places that provide
social,medical and cultural services to a
neighbourhood.
In the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais,
for example, there is a vocational school
where elderly craftsmen teach their skills
to teenagers. Such contact between gene-
rations can offer a very valuable social
e d u c a t i o n .“It takes a village to educate a
c h i l d ,” goes an African proverb. L e t ’s
make an effort to seek out these oppor-
t u n i t i e s, even in the most heartless cities.
