Water is a bond between human beings and
n at u r e . It is ever-present in our daily lives and in
our imagi n at i o n s. Since the beginning of time, i t
has shaped extraordinary social institutions, a n d
access to it has provoked many confli c t s.
But most of the wo r l d ’s people, who have neve r
gone short of wat e r , take its availability for gr a n t e d .
I n d u s t ri a l i s t s , fa rm e rs and ordinary consumers
blithely go on wasting it.These day s ,t h o u g h ,s u p p l i e s
are diminishing while demand is soari n g .E ve ryo n e
k n ows that the time has come for attitudes to change.
Few people are aware of the true extent of fresh
water scarcity. M a ny are fooled by the huge
expanses of blue that feature on maps of the wo r l d .
They do not know that 97.5 per cent of the planet’s
water is salty—and that most of the wo r l d ’s fresh
water—the remaining 2.5 per cent—is unusable: 7 0
per cent of it is frozen in the icecaps of A n t a r c t i c a
and Greenland and almost all the rest exists in the
f o rm of soil humidity or in water tables which are
too deep to be tapped. In all, barely one per cent of
fresh water—0.007 per cent of all the water in the
wo r l d , is easily accessible.
O ver the past century, p o p u l ation gr owth and
human activity have caused this precious resource to
d w i n d l e .B e t ween 1900 and 1995, world demand for
water increased more than sixfold—compared with
a threefold increase in world populat i o n .The rat i o
b e t ween the stock of fresh water and world populat i o n
seems to show that in overall terms there is enough
water to go round.But in the most vulnerable regi o n s ,
an estimated 460 million people (8 per cent of the
wo r l d ’s population) are short of wat e r , and another
q u a rter of the planet’s inhabitants are heading for the
same fat e . E x p e rts say that if nothing is done, t wo -
thirds of humanity will suffer from a moderate to
s e vere lack of water by the year 2025.
Inequalities in the availability of wat e r —
sometimes even within a single country — a r e
r e flected in huge differences in consumption leve l s.
A person living in rural Madagascar uses 10 litres
a day, the minimum for surv i va l , while a French
p e rson uses 150 litres and an A m e rican as many as
4 2 5 .
Scarcity is just one part of the problem. Wat e r
quality is also declining alarm i n g l y. In some areas,
c o n t a m i n ation levels are so high that water can
no longer be used even for industrial purp o s e s.
There are many reasons for this—untreated sewa g e ,
chemical wa s t e , fuel leakages, dumped garbage,
c o n t a m i n ation of soil by chemicals used by fa rm e rs.
The worldwide extent of such pollution is hard to
assess because data are lacking for several countri e s.
But some figures gi ve an idea of the problem. It is
thought for example that 90 per cent of wa s t e
water in developing countries is released without
Fresh water is a scarce commodity. Since it’s impossible to increase supply,
demand and waste must be reduced. But how?

Sharper vision
D esalinization,state of the art irrigation systems, techniques to harvest fog—technological
solutions like these are widely hailed as the answer to water scarcity. But in searching for the
“miracle”solution,hydrologists and policy-makers often lose sight of the question:how can we
use and safeguard this vital resource? UN E S C O’s International Hydrological Programme (IHP) take s
an interdisciplinary approach to this question. On the one hand, IHP brings together scientists from
150 countries to develop global and regional assessments of water supplies and,for example,
inventories of groundwater contamination. At the same time, the programme focuses on the
c u l t u ral and socio-economic factors involved in effective policy-making. For example, g r o u n d wa t e r
supplies in Gaza (Palestinian Authority) are coming under serious strain,partly because of new
business investment in the area. IHP has a two-pronged approach. F i r s t ,t rain and help local
hydrologists accurately assess the supplies. Second,work with government officials to set up a
licensing system for pumping groundwater.
By joining forces with the World Water Council,an international think-tank on hydrological
issues, IHP is now hosting one of the most ambitious projects in the field: World Water Vision.
Hundreds of thousands of hydrologists, policy-makers, farmers, business leaders and ordinary
citizens will take part in public consultations to develop regional scenarios as to how key issues
like contamination will evolve in the next 25 years. n

What price water?

a ny kind of treat m e n t .
Things are especially bad in cities, where wat e r
demand is exploding. For the first time in human
h i s t o ry, there will soon be more people living in cities
than in the countryside and so water consumption
will continue to increase. S o a ring urbanization will
sharpen the rivalry between the different kinds of
water users.
Curbing the explosion
in demand
Today, farming uses 69 per cent of the water
consumed in the world, industry 23 per cent and
households 8 per cent. In developing countri e s ,
a griculture uses as much as 80 per cent.The needs
of city-dwe l l e rs ,i n d u s t ry and tourists are expected
to increase rapidly, at least as much as the need to
produce more fa rm products to feed the planet.T h e
problem of increasing water supply has long been
seen as a technical one, calling for technical solutions
such as building more dams and desalination plants.
Wild ideas like towing chunks of icebergs from the
poles have even been mooted.
But today, technical solutions are reaching
their limits. Economic and socio-ecologi c a l
arguments are levelled against building new dams,
for example: dams are costing more and more
because the best sites have already been used, and
they take millions of people out of their env i r o n m e n t
and upset ecosystems. As a result, twice as many
dams were built on average between 1951 and 1977
than during the past decade, according to the US
e nvironmental research body Wo r l d watch Institute.
Hydrologists and engineers have less and less
room for manoeuvre, but a new consensus with
new actors is taking shape. Since supply can no
longer be expanded—or only at prohibitive cost
for many countries—the explosion in demand must
be curbed along with wasteful practices. A n

is lost through inefficient systems,for example.
Economists have plunged into the debate on
water and made quite a few wave s.To obtain “ r at i o n a l
u s e ” of wat e r , i . e . avoiding waste and maintaining
q u a l i t y, they say consumers must be made to pay for
i t . Out of the question, reply those in favour of free
wat e r , which some cultures regard as “a gift from
h e ave n ” .And what about the poor, ask the champions
of human rights and the right to water? Other
i m p o rtant and prickly questions being asked by
d e c i s i o n - m a k e rs are how to calculate the “real pri c e ”
of water and who should organize its sale.
The state
as mediator
The principle of free water is being challenged.
For many people,water has become a commodity
to be bought and sold. But management of this
shared resource cannot be left exclusively to market
f o r c e s. M a ny elements of civil society—NGOs,
r e s e a r c h e rs , community groups—are campaigning
for the cultural and social aspects of wat e r
management to be taken into account.
E ven the World Bank, the main advo c ate of
water pri vat i z at i o n , is cautious on this point. I t
recognizes the value of the part n e rships between the
public and pri vate sectors which have sprung up in
recent ye a rs. Only the state seems to be in a position
to ensure that practices are fair and to mediat e
between the parties involved—consumer groups,
private firms and public bodies. At any rate, water
r e g u l ation and management systems need to be
based on other than purely financial cri t e ri a . If they
aren’t,hundreds of millions of people will have no
access to it. n
