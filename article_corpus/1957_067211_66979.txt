WORLD
PRODUCTION:
5,000 MILLION
BOOKS A YEAR
Upwards of five thousand million copies of books are
produced annually throughout the world, but large
as this figure seems it represents only two books
per person per year. About three-quarters of all books
published come from ten countries, and half of all our
books are used in schools while a large part of the
remainder are housed in public or institutional libraries.
These striking facts come from a new Unesco publica¬
tion Books for All by R.E. Barker, deputy secretary of the
Publishers' Association of Great Britain, who was commis¬
sioned by Unesco to survey problems confronting the inter¬
national book trade.
A dearth of printing and publishing facilities In large
areas of the world, coupled with a maze of obstacles at
national frontiers impedes the full production and free
circulation of books. The difficulties range from tariff
and currency restrictions to inadequate copyright protec¬
tion, from a paucity of translation services to high trans¬
port costs.
The Unesco survey reveals that statistics normally
provided rarely show the actual output of books in any
given country, that is, the total number of copies printed,
as opposed to the total number of "titles" the statistical
unit of book production; Titles do however illustrate the
variety of books produced in individual countries through¬
out the world.
Mr. Barker's study is laced with many statistical tables
and pictographs which show some surprising situations:
Thus, as seen in table (right), very few countries publish
more than 10,000 titles a year and not many come into the
major producer group with more than 4,000 or 5,000.
Belgium, China, Czechoslovakia, German Federal Republic,
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland and Yugoslavia are to
be found in this high range mainly because of the large
number of translations they publish.
The Netherlands publishes the most titles in proportion
' to its population, with tiny Switzerland only slightly less.
In contrast, major producers such as the U.S.A., the
U.S.S.R. and India come low on the per capita list.
Many a first novel never sells more than 2,500 copies
even in countries of high literacy and extensive book
production. Rarely does it exceed 5,000 copies, and only a
foolhardy publisher incurs the expense of regularly bind¬
ing the entire printing of a first novel. Novels of establish¬
ed authors sometimes run into editions of hundreds of
thousands of copies but these are a small minority.
General works of non-fiction may occasionally reach
almost fabulous editions (Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki is an
example; for others see U.S. best sellers on page 34) but on
an average the number is small.
The Unesco survey reveals that nearly 22 per cent of the
world's books are in the English language, followed by
Russian (17%), German (15%), Japanese (12%), French
(10%), Spanish (7.5%), Italian (6.7%), Portuguese (5.4%),
and Chinese (4.8%).
The United Kingdom is the world's largest book exporter.

The U.S.A. is second, France third, Netherlands fourth,
German Federal Republic fifth, Spain sixth, and Switz¬
erland seventh. In only 12 cases does the value of Inter¬
national book exchange exceed $2 million. U.S. exports to
Canada are by far the largest in the world to a single
country, being three times greater than the nearest
"rival"the U.K.'s exports to Australia. Other Important
exports: U.K. to the United States, South Africa, Canada,
New Zealand and India, in that order; U.S. exports to the
Philippines and the U.K.; French exports to the Benelux
countries; Netherlands exports to Indonesia and Benelux;
German exports to Switzerland and Austria, and Swiss
exports to Germany. Spanish exports to Argentina are
not far behind.
One of the most striking postwar developments has been
the rapid expansion of the German book trade. It has
already gone far towards regaining its pre-war eminence.
The Swiss book trade, which gained international promin¬
ence after the rise of Nazism in Germany, seems not to
have suffered by this post-war German expansion. In
fact, the German-speaking countries import more of each
other's books each year just as the French and English-
speaking countries do.
In Spanish America, only Mexico, Argentina, Chile, are
considerable book producers. They export in quantity to
most other Latin-American countries as well as to Spain
and the U.S.A. Norway, Sweden and Denmark export
regularly to each other, publication in other Scandinavian
languages being a common feature of their book trade.
While the volume of the international book trade is
considerable, there is comparatively little movement
towards those economically underdeveloped countries
where books are most needed. Much of present world
trade in books follows traditional channels. With current
advances in book production, translation and transport
new channels could be developed which could bring the
heritage of the world's literature to vast new audiences.
The crux of the problem of providing reading material
for the underdeveloped nations was clearly stated by a
committee of educational specialists convened by Unesco

This table includes all countries which published more than 4,000 titles.
Exceptions are India and the People's Republic of China for which
Unesco has no precise figures for 1955. The 17 countries included in
this table published a total of 175,930 titles, or a large proportion
of world production, the 1955 production figures for 53 countries
being 2 1 4,360. Figures given cover both books and pamphlets with the

in 1951: "The difficulty is not so much in printing, since
there are various machines and techniques in existence
which are designed to produce books and other printed
matter in small quantity... The difficulty is to find or train
competent authors or translators; to obtain supplies of
materials (such as paper, type and macninery)... to dis¬
tribute the finished product under conditions of great
distances and poor communications; and above all to find
the money."
In India, for example, where the world's largest illiterate
population administered by a central government is found,
the basic need is to make the population literate in Hindi
and in the vernacular languages. The first five year
national development plan includes a mass education
programme for children and adults.
Among the reading materials needed: textbooks and
"follow-up" reading materials. Many literacy campaigns
have failed because such materials have been lacking.
The basic need is a link between the elementary primer and
advanced books, periodicals and other publications which
are normally read for pleasure and profit.
Unesco is helping to encourage writers and translators
in India by establishing "literary workshops" and offering
awards in literature. Prizes are also offered by the Indian
Government for original works in native languages, par¬
ticularly- Hindi. Unesco is now studying successful
projects in South-east Asia, the South Pacific and Latin
America, and is developing an advisory service to produc¬
ing agencies on such matters as low-cost printing of good
quality books and their distribution.
The world's fast reducing illiteracy rate is one of the
most promising aspects noted in Mr. Baker's report.
The development of photo-typesetting to allow rapid
composition of Asiatic "scripts together with increasing
use of modern high speed printing presses In the under¬
developed countries suggest that the next decade will
witness a substantial increase in books produced.
Among the many barriers to the free flow of books the
imposition of import duties is perhaps the most formid¬
able. Two-thirds of the countries of the world apply
import licensing to books, and there are many other

irksome formalities which representations made by
Unesco and other bodies have to some extent removed.
Twelve per cent of the world's countries levy import duties,
40 per cent charge internal taxes and 70 per cent impose
currency restrictions on books.
The U.S.A. charges a duty of five per cent ad valorem
on books in the English language, books in other languages
being duty-free. Largely because of this, Canada main¬
tains a 10 per cent levy on U.S. books though none is
imposed on British books. Austria charges importers a
51 per cent "equalization" tax; Spain and Denmark both
impose duties on books in their languages; Italy charges
13 per cent on books bound in leather.
"The revenue collected by these duties can hardly offset
the cost of collecting them," Mr. Barker comments. "For
example, the annual return from the U.S. Government's
import duties on books in the English language cannot
exceed $500,000less than 0.000002 per cent of the total
national income. France's 8 per cent tax on the invoice
value of imported books yields only about 200 million
francs, or 0.00002 per cent of the total national income.
Belgium's 4i per cent taxe de transmission can hardly
balance the cost of collecting it."
As Mr. Barker remarks, "The principle behind these
duties' is thus anachronistic and unreal...
What then is the excuse for these barriers?" (See also

"Violins taxed by the kilogram" in Unesco Courier. July-
Aug. 1956-U.S. edition Sept.)
Public libraries are at present the biggest buyers of
many general books and in some countries they purchase
one half of all works distributed. Since no library can
contain all books, a comprehensive. service for internation¬
al library loans has been built up. In addition to loans
there are many arrangements for exchanging publications.
Unesco's Clearing House for Libraries has working arran¬
gements with centres in almost 50 countries. At present
69 countries exchange 35,000 new titles annually in a
plethora of agreements. Unesco is now working on a
single, universal convention to cover all publication
exchanges.
