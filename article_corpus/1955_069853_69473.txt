Today there are only 15 countries where
women have no political rights: Afghani¬
stan, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran,
Iraq, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Liechten¬
stein, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia,
Switzerland and Yemen. In Saudi Arabia
and Yemen neither men nor women have
the right to vote. At present, the United
Nations gives no information on voting
rights for women in Spain. Information
on these pages is from U. N. sources. 

1955 : NO VOTE FOR WOMEN IN 15 COUNTRIES
This balance sheet of voting
rights for women in different
countries of the world accord¬
ing to the latest figures available
shows year-by-year progress
BEFORE the First World War, only four countries had
granted women the right to vote. During and immedi¬
ately following the First World War more countries
conceded political rights to women, and even greater progress
was made during the Second World War. The maps on these
pages and the details of yearly progress point out the road
along which women have travelled towards political equality
during the past 62 years.

GERMANY (1). German women received the right to
vote in 1919. Under the 1949 Fundamental Law of the
Federal Republic of Germany and under the Constitution
of the Democratic Republic of Germany, promulgated in
the same year, women vote and are elected on an equal
basis with men and have the same right as men to hold
public office.
AUSTRALIA (2). In 1894, South Australia granted
women the right to vote ; five years later West Australia
did the same and by 1908 all the states had given equal
voting rights. In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act
provided for a uniform federal franchise for the Common¬
wealth Parliament for all men and women over 21.
BELGIUM (3). Full voting rights were granted to Bel¬
gian women in 1948. Since 1921 they had only had the
right to vote in local elections, with the exception of cer¬
tain women wives, or failing them, mothers of men who
had lost their lives during the First World War, or women
who had been imprisoned by the enemy army who were
given the right to vote in national elections.
BRAZIL (4). In Brazil voting is compulsory for all
men and women with the exception of infirm people and
those aged over 70.
CEYLON (5). Women were enfranchised in Ceylon in
1931, but their qualifying age was 30 as compared with 21
for men. This inequality was removed in 1934, and by
1946, two years before Ceylon achieved independence, uni¬
versality of suffrage and eligibility to public office were
established on an equal basis for men and women.
CHILE (6). The right to vote in local elections was
granted to Chilean women in 1931, providing they were
literate, aged over 25, and had either property on which
they paid taxes or followed a business or industrial pro
fession. In 1934 they were allowed to vote on equal terms
with men in local elections, and in 1949 were granted
suffrage in national elections.
GUATEMALA (7). Illiterate women may not vote, and
voting for literate women is voluntary. Men, whether
literate or illiterate, may vote; for literate men, voting is
compulsory, for the illiterate, it is voluntary.
HAITI (8). Under the Constitution of 1950 women
were restricted to voting in municipal elections until 1954.
All disabilities will have been removed by 1957 and women
will then have complete political rights.
ICELAND (9). When Denmark enfranchised women in
1915, Iceland was under Danish rule and the right to vote
was extended to Icelandic women. In 1944 when Iceland
severed its ties with the Danish Crown, women retained
the right to vote under its new Republican Constitution.
But to qualify as voters both men and women must be
"of unblemished character and financially solvent".
LEBANON (10). To be eligible to vote a woman must
have a certificate of primary education or its equivalent.
MONACO (11). In Monaco, women have had the right
to vote for and be elected to the Communal Council on
the same conditions as men since 1945.
PORTUGAL (12). Women's voting rights are subject
to special educational or tax qualifications. Women who
are heads of families may vote if they pay not less than
100 escudos in taxes a year. Other women must either
have completed a course in general studies in a secondary
school, or taken a course in teaching or in an industrial or
commercial institute, or studied fine arts or music, before
they are eligible to vote.
SYRIA (13). Women over 18 years of age and possess¬
ing a certificate of at least primary education have had
the right to vote since September 1949.
