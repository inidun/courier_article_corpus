E x c e s s for all
◗ Micz Flor Young rebels are not only
attacking the music 
industry but also creating new
c i rcuits of solidarity via the
I n t e r n e t
The Internet has provided a playground for young
rebels to hit the music industry where it hurts:
stealing their intellectual property. Breaching
copyright laws has long been seen as good conduct.
Back in the 70s,punk record labels used slogans such
as “Home taping is killing the music industry, keep
up the good work.” However, the threat to estab-
lished publishing houses has always been limited, as
pirating on ordinary tapes made distribution techni-
cally complicated.Throughout the 70s and 80s some
independent mail ordering systems were set up, cre-
ating a network amongst pirate radio stations. But
they never hurt anyone.
To d ay, yo u n g, s u b ve rs i ve elements have the
Internet at their fingertips,and the cultural industries
on their knees. The audio format MP3 allows us to
compress audio CDs into small files which can be
made accessible on the Internet. Just click, download
and listen.All you need is a modem, a phone line and
a mediocre computer. Surely, having access to exact-
ly the same distribution channels as the multination-
als dissolves established power structures. And with-
out any financial pressure, no additional costs other
than the phone bill (mostly paid by parents), youth-
ful enthusiasm combined with a complete lack of
respect for legislative regulations opens the flood-
gates for piracy.
Of course,“young people on the Internet” are not
all about stealing intellectual property. In fact, the
real opportunity lies in becoming part of a global cul-
tural exchange—without depending on the old-fash-
ioned music industr y. Instead of producing and sell-
ing products, alternative models of work are taking
shape. For example, an originally anarcho-commu-
nist concept—the gift economy—is alive and well.
The philosophy is simple: trade what you have, and
who needs money anyway? Pilot FM, a Vienna-
based MP3 label, which has grown out of the
crossover between independent Internet Service
Providers and electronic sound artists, states on
its website: “Though we won’t charge you for the
downloads, we are thankful for donations of any
kind such as hardwa r e , s o f t wa r e , t r ave l l e r ’s
cheques, canned tomato soup, instant coffee or
any other device,which you think makes life more
pleasurable.”1
Sound artists have also learned from the
I n t e rn e t ’s Open Source deve l o p m e n t . In a nut-
s h e l l : the more beta-testers and deve l o p e rs wo r k i n g
on a product, the better it is.This has been prove n
time again with software deve l o p m e n t , which is fa r
too complicated for a single individual to manage.
Tu rning to the cultural fie l d , a rtists are rolling ove r
the old notion of copyri g h t . G i ve away your bu i l d-
ing blocks (ideas), see what others make of them
and this will help your own deve l o p m e n t . So we
find sample banks and archives for storing sound
and music files available all over the Intern e t . A n
avant-garde hip-hop musician with a taste for
squeaks may find the sound of her dreams in an
a r c h i ve . She may in turn transform that squeak
and so the bank gr ows richer… The archives also
enable net radios to enlarge their play l i s t s. One of
m a ny examples is the Budapest based DJ net.radio
s t ation Pa r a r a d i o2, running a tight schedule of DJs
and sound art i s t s. Daniel Molnar, one of the spir-
its behind the project, e x p l a i n s : “ We don’t eve n
need to rely on produced sample discs, we have on-
line sample stores and free archive s. (...) If you feel
r e a l , join the new folkat e e rs.”3
Liberating information
But the subversion goes beyond attacking the
music industry to the political sphere. With the
emergence of a digital equivalent to the public
s p h e r e , issues of civil disobedience and revo l u t i o n-
a ry spirit have shifted into the electronic netwo r k s.
Throughout the 1980s hackers took the symbolic
role of the militant opposition.“ I n f o rm ation wa n t s

to be free”, they claimed while pulling confid e n t i a l
files out in the open.4
To d ay the streets of Vienna offer a cogent example
of youth seizing the Internet to organise resistance.
Since the new right-wing gove rnment took powe r ,
youth groups like Volkstanz organised via the Intern e t
weekly street parades with live DJs throughout the
c a p i t a l , while toying with the gove rn m e n t ’s helpless
attempts to control them by proudly stating on their
we b s i t e : “All insults are we l c o m e : we are the hedo-
nistic Intern e t - g e n e r at i o n , t h e
dance floor wing of the resistance
m ove m e n t . (…) We want to fig h t
through the medium of political
street parties the terri t o ri a l i s at i o n
of youth culture.”5
B e l grade based Radio B 2-92
( f o rmerly B92) is another exam-
ple of subve rs i ve youth culture via
Internet. As they announce on
their virtual JukeBox :“By play i n g
music with a subtle but unmis-
takable political and social mes-
s a g e , Radio B92 confronted the
aesthetic that had been imposed
on the “silent majori t y ” , one that
failed to foster liberal attitudes in
the country during the disinte-
gration of former Yugoslavia.”6
With their on-air frequency under
constant threat of closure by the
g ove rn m e n t ,Free B92—the we b-
site—has become a meeting place,
d r awing audiences far beyond the
b o r d e rs of former Yu g o s l av i a .
From early on,radio aficionados were quick to
seize the cyberworld’s audio formats to link virtual
space with the streets. London based irational.org
is no exception.Besides the pirate radio handbook7,
they also feature the net.radio guide8 which has
been developed by va rious producers across
Europe. Here the clever youth can find technical
details on how to connect on-line broadcasting with
low-power FM transmitters.
But building bridges to the street via net radio
is just one line of attack. Media collectives across
Europe had spent the final ye a rs of the last century
l e a rning to transgress national borders via new
modes of shared broadcasting and artistic creat i o n .
The Berlin-based—and recently deceased—col-
lective convex tv. came to the conclusion: “There
are a few simple reasons for doing things collec-
tively: technologically and economically speaking
the collective is the only space where you can be
m a r ginally successful and successfully margi n a l .”9
The aim isn’t to reach a bigger or mass audi-
ence but rather to connect pockets of creat i v i t y
and resistance via new modes of shared broad-
c a s t i n g . In their avant-garde experi m e n t at i o n ,t e c h-
n o l o gical possibilities and artistic expression are
i n d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e . For example, in 1997 Riga’s
net.radio station Ozone1 0 set up a mailing list
( X c h a n g e1 1) to develop the concept of “ a c o u s t i c
s p a c e ”i nvolving techniques like co-streaming. A s
Raitis Smits, the stat i o n ’s director, has explained,
“Each broadcaster takes another’s live stream [of
s o u n d ] , re-encodes it and forwards it to the next
p a rt i c i p a n t .”1 2
Such transnational projects generate a new
mode of communication amongst young practi-
t i o n e rs. Not only is there a need to work collec-
t i vely within their own gr o u p, but they must also lat-
erally exchange know l e d g e , content and theory.
They share an acoustic space, ye t
they may never meet in “ r e a l
s p a c e .”And so they leave the old
artistic concepts of community-
based work behind and enter a
new digital env i r o n m e n t : the col-
lective is dead,long live the col-
lective.
H owe ve r , this digital netwo r k
cannot truly serve as a source for
d e m o c r atic part i c i p ation and free
speech without solid gr o u n d i n g
in the “access for all” p a r a d i g m .
O b v i o u s l y, access to the Intern e t
means more than a phone line, a
computer and technical know -
h ow. In terms of cultural produc-
t i o n ,“ a c c e s s ”g e n e r ates two prob-
lem zones. F i rs t , it is generally
assumed that the Internet allow s
m a r ginal groups to make their
voices heard, yet the question is
rarely raised as to who is speaking
on behalf of such gr o u p s.
S e c o n d , the idea of access for all is normally under-
stood as a one-way process, meaning eve ryone should
h ave access to all inform at i o n . But by reading this par-
adigm in reve rs e , all inform ation should be accessi-
ble to all. In the case of youth culture, danger ari s e s
as a more homogenised MTV youth style is increas-
ingly made available in standardised form ats on-line.
So despite the little islands of resistance to “ M c D o n-
a l d ’s - s t y l e ”culture nuggets,we might face yet another
p r o b l e m , not unknown in the We s t e rn wo r l d — c u l-
tural assimilat i o n . Is this the price to pay? Substitute
access with excess and you’ll hear that same old song
of homogenized culture. Re-wind or fa s t - f o r wa r d ?■
