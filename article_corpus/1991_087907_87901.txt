Ouro Prêto, city of black gold
by Augusto C. da Silva Telles

I he problems of reconciling the
traditional and the modern are raised
in particularly acute form at Ouro
Prêto, a historic city in Brazil's Minas
Gerais state which is today sur¬
rounded by an industrial zone and
lies on an important highway.
Ouro Prêto (Portuguese for "Black
Gold") grew out of a mining settle¬
ment which developed on the lower
slope of the Serra do Ouro Prêto in
the early eighteenth century when
miners flocked Into the region to
prospect for gold in the rivers and on
the mountain slopes. In 1711 it was
given the status of a city and the
name of Vila Rica. It is said that many
houses used the entrances to mine
shafts as their cellars.
In this rugged setting, narrow
crooked streets and alleys were built
along the mountain spur without any
overall plan. The central square,
today known as the Praça Tiradentes
after a hero of Brazil's independence
struggle, was not built until the mid-
eighteenth century. Around it stand
the old colonial governor's palace,
the town hall and the colonial
penitentiary.
The houses, of varying height, are
strung haphazardly along steep,
winding streets. Their picturesque
beauty charms visitors and leads
them from one surprise to another.
The diversity of the site and the out¬
standing views are accentuated by
the outlines of churches and chapels
silhouetted high on the slopes or
blending into the townscape. The
French specialist Michel Parent has
described how "This straggling
urban fabric reveals itself gradually
to the eye, which slowly comes to
dominate it, bringing together near
and far, narrow streets set deep in
the valley, a bell-tower atop a distant
hill.... It does not have the obvious
advantage of a magnificent site, its
beauty is at first hinted at, then
becomes elusive, before finally
yielding itself to the visitor."*
The mid-eighteenth century was
the period of Ouro Prêto's greatest
splendour, thanks to the abundance
of gold which brought it wealth. The
houses dating from that period were

aärtll

built In dressed stone. Decorated
with a profusion of friezes and scroll¬
work, their architecture is more
elaborate than the others. Many of
these buildings are in Conde-
Bobadela street and on the Praça
Tiradentes, where the Casa dos
Contos, the governor's palace, and
the town hall are notable for the
elegance and force of their late
baroque style.
The religious architecture of Ouro
Prêto is also remarkable for its origi¬
nality, diversity and quality. Some of
the buildings are among the most
beautiful examples of baroque art
not only in Brazil but in the world.
On either side of the spur of rock
topped by the Praça Tiradentes are
the Carmelite church of Our Lady and
the church of St. Francis of Assisi.
The architect and sculptor of these
two churches was Antonio Francisco
Lisboa, better known as "0
Aleijadinho" ("the little cripple"). The
church of St. Francis, which dates
from 1764, was Aleijadinho's first
project and his masterwork. It is
remarkable for an ingenious combi¬
nation of curves and ellipses, as well
as the composition, of an astonishing
expressive force, of the frontispiece
carved in "pedra-sabâo" (a kind of
alabaster).
Problems of growth
Ouro Prêto was the seat of the mili¬
tary government and then the cap¬
ital of Minas Gerais until the state
administration was transferred to the
new city of Belo Horizonte in 1897.
As a result of this change in status
and the exhaustion of its gold
deposits, the city went into decline.
If Ouro Prêto today still has a certain
vitality, it is because of its position
as a university city. When it was clas¬
sified as a historic monument in
1938, it was living in the past. The
city had virtually ceased to grow, and
conservation activity was limited to
religious and civic buildings.
In the 1950s, an aluminium plant
was built at nearby Saramenha, and
the highway between Saramenha
and Bela Horizonte was metalled.
Population growth and economic
activity suddenly picked up again.
Road traffic also sharply increased,
largely because of the heavy trucks
serving the Saramenha complex.

This development threatened one of
the finest jewels of Brazil's historical
and artistic heritage, and the institu¬
tion responsible for its safeguard
asked UNESCO to provide technical
support for Ouro Prêto.
In 1966 international specialists
carried out studies with a view to
defining possible zones of develop¬
ment, reducing demographic growth
and preserving the old city. Their
proposals were taken up and worked
out in greater detail by a team of
Brazilian technicians acting under
the auspices of the federal, provin¬
cial and municipal authorities. A
number of measures were adopted,
including the construction of a new
road around the site and a bus sta¬
tion outside the historic centre so
that buses and coaches do not need
to park on or near the Praça
Tiradentes. Trucks and other heavy-
duty vehicles are not allowed in the
city, where a new urbanization zone
is being created. Slopes subject to
landslides are being consolidated. In
1979 a geological map was made of
the whole urban area in order to indi¬
cate zones which can be built on
without risk.
In December 1980, Ouro Prêto
was included on UNESCO's World
Heritage List.
