m* OR many centuries, the
planets of the solar system
have been objects of study by astron¬
omers. Before the invention of the
telescope, these studies were restrict¬
ed to an attempt to understand and
predict their motion.
Very precise observations in the late
sixteenth century led to the conclusion
that the planets moved in orbits around
the sun, and from this, the modern
concept of the solar system was
established.
Telescopes and accurate clocks
allowed even more precise observa¬
tions, and outer planets, Neptune and
Pluto, were discovered.
Telescopes also provided astron¬
omers with their first evidence of the
sizes and surface appearances of the
planets, and of the existence of their
moons.
Then came the space programme,
and the possibility of performing exper¬
iments on, or at least near to, other
planets. Not only have active flight
programmes of planetary investigation
been established by the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
but also ground-based observations
have been greatly strengthened.
Scientists from many disciplines in¬
cluding biology, geology, physics and
chemistry, have found opportunities to
conduct research in this new field of
planetology.
Since World War II, many devices
other than rockets have extended
man's capability for planetary research.
For example, telescopic observations
have been improved by the use of bet¬
ter photographic film, including colour
film, and by various electronic instru-

EXPLORING THE PLANETS (Continued)
Venus turns slowly counterclockwise
22
ments. Sensitive infra-red detectors
have become available. Spectroscopy
has taken advantage of improved tech¬
nology. Radio telescopes have be¬
come sensitive enough to make plane¬
tary measurements.
Within the past few years still
greater steps have been taken. Tele¬
scopes have been lifted above the
atmosphere with balloons. Radar
signals have been reflected from the
planets. Spacecraft have been sent
to the vicinity of Venus and Mars.
Soon an astronomical observatory will
be orbiting the earth. Spacecraft will
be sent to orbit nearby planets, and
capsules from them will land on the
surface.
The first radar echo observed from
any heavenly body was in January
1946, when a group of U.S. Army
Signal Corps engineers succeeded in
detecting a signal reflected from the
moon. By 1961, echoes had been de¬
tected from the planet Venus. Consid¬
ering that the distance to Venus is
more than 100 times as great as that
to the moon, this is an indication of
the remarkable improvement in radar
technology during this period of 15
years.
But it is not sufficient merely to de¬
tect an echo from a planet. Useful
scientific information requires measure¬
ment of the properties of the echo.
The time at which the echo occurs
gives the range to the target. Echo
power provides information on the
scattering properties of the target. The
echo's radio frequency shift measures
the relative velocity of target and
receiver. Frequency dispersion meas¬
ures the rotation of the target, rela¬
tive to a line perpendicular to the di¬
rection of the receiver. Results
obtained by these methods have prov¬
ed that radar is an exceedingly
valuable new tool for planetary explor¬
ation.
The distance from earth to the planet
Venus has been measured to an accu¬
racy of about 25 kilometres (15 miles).
These data supplement astronomical
observations in a useful way. Astro¬
nomical data consist of angle measu¬
rements versus time. By adding pre¬
cise range to the astronomical data,
the geometry and motions of the plan¬
ets can be calculated to a very much
greater precision than formerly.
Venus is a particularly interesting
case because astronomical observa¬
tions had not been able to establish
any definite rotation rate since no vis
ible fixed surface features were
available. Spectroscopic observations
indicated a very slow rotation but the
data contained large uncertainties. The
radar data showed unequivocally that
Venus does indeed rotate slowly coun¬
terclockwise with a rotation period of
about 250 days.
Radar observations of Mercury and
Mars have also yielded useful infor¬
mation. Jupiter has been detected by
radar both at the U.S. Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and by a U.S.S.R. group.
Because of the great distance, and
the large frequency dispersion due to
rotation of the planet, Jupiter turns out
to be a very difficult target.
Planetary radar offers many oppor¬
tunities for extended research activi¬
ties. Systems are becoming more
sensitive as transmitter power and
antenna diameters increase while re¬
ceiver temperatures go lower. Other
than the moon, Venus will continue
to be the most attractive target. Con¬
tinuing study will provide a radar map
of the planet.
Within the past five years the possi¬
bility of sending instruments to the
planets has advanced from speculation
to reality. The United States has suc¬
cessfully sent two spacecraft to other
planets: Mariner II to Venus and Mar¬
iner IV to Mars. The Soviet Union
sent a number of probes towards
Venus, and after a three-month flight,
the Soviet Venera 3 probe reached
the surface of the planet on March I,
1966.
These flights clearly open up a whole
new era in planetology.
As a practical matter, the energy
available from a booster rocket is
limited and, therefore, on most mis¬
sions the spacecraft will fly to another
planet along an orbit which requires
minimum energy. To come near the
target planet, it will be necessary to
launch at a specified time when the
earth and the planet are In the correct
relative positions.
This means that launch, and arrival
at the planet, occur at times determin¬
ed by solar-system geometry. If, there¬
fore, an experiment requires observa¬
tions at some particular season on
Mars, a flight will be possible only at
certain launch periods.
Because the orbits of the planets
are on different planes, the energy re¬
quired to send a spacecraft to another
planet varies with the launch date. For
example, In the case of Mars the lowest
minimum energy orbit will occur in
1969 and the highest in 1973. The
cycle repeats in a 15-year period. The
1969 launch requires that the space¬
craft leave the earth's gravitational
field with a velocity of 2.8 kms.
(1.7 miles) per second. In 1973, this
will rise to 4.0 kms (2.5 miles) a sec¬
ond. The size of spacecraft which
can be launched with a given booster
will vary accordingly.
Data sent back to earth from space¬
craft in the vicinity of a planet must
travel vast distances. Hence, the com¬
munication system must be designed so
that the maximum data rate is kept as
low as possible. The instrumentation
selected for the spacecraft must there¬
fore be designed to satisfy the low data
requirement, or else must provide a
data storage system able to collect
data over a short period of time and
send it over the communication link
sufficiently slowly to meet the rate
specification.
Instruments designed to fly on a
spacecraft must, of course, operate
in the spacecraft environment. This
environment can be divided into three

CLOSE-UP
OF MARS
In the 350 years since
the telescope was in¬
vented, probably more
tune has been devoted
fo viewing and photo¬
graphing Mars than to
any other planet Its
varied colouring and
polar caps, which appear
to change with the
seasons, and its straight-
line markings suggestive
of a rectangular net¬
work of canals have
given rise to all lands
of theories. Top left, this
view of Mars is repre¬
sentative of the best
that can be made
with the aid of earth-
bound telescopes. Hence¬
forth, observations ob¬
tained through space
probes are likely to
clear up many of the
mysteries of Mars. On
July 14, 1965, the U.S.
spacecraft Mariner IV,
after a 228-day trip came
within some 9,650 kms.
(6,000 miles) of Mars and
took a series of photos
of the planet. Right, on
one of these photos a
series of giant craters
is visible. Bottom left

categories: launch, free-fall in the vacu¬
um of space, and landing on another
planet or re-entry and landing on the
earth. Each category has its prob¬
lems.
The launch is characterized primar¬
ily by severe vibration and accelera¬
tion. Coasting in space presents prob¬
lems due to the long exposure to a
vacuum. The landing or re-entry period
presents further vibration and accel¬
eration problems, possibly complicat¬
ed by the gaseous constituents of a
planetary atmosphere.
While instruments have been built
to operate properly in each of these
environments, it is not an easy task.
The worst environment is usually the
vibration at launch. But the effects of
a vacuum should not be minimized.
These may include evaporation of in¬
strument materials; problems of lubri¬
cation of bearing surfaces; and temp¬
erature problems caused by the dis¬
appearance of convective cooling.
Electrical problems may arise due
to the passage through the atmosphere
from sea level pressure to the vacuum
of space, or from leakage of sealed
compartments.
In addition to the environmental con¬
straints, the instrument designer must
live with weight, volume and power
consumption specifications. On most
spacecraft to date, these constraints
have been quite stringent. However,
looking into the future when larger
boost vehicles become available, they
should be relaxed.
A spacecraft designed to land in¬
struments on another planet introduces
still another constraint, namely the re¬
quirement for biological sterilization.
One of the very interesting experiments
which will be conducted on the surface
of Mars is the search for life. There¬
fore, all space flight apparatus which
has any probability of landing on Mars
must be sterile to insure that life forms
from earth will not be transported to
the planet.
The methods by which a large space¬
craft can be made completely sterile,
and maintained in that condition through
the launching, are currently being deve¬
loped. One possibility is a require¬
ment that the complete spacecraft be
Photo NASA
sterilized by heating above the boiling
point for an extended period of time.
In this case, of course, instruments
would have to be constructed out of
materials and components which could
stand such treatment.
Finally, there is the question of
reliability on the long journey through
space. Some instruments are required
to work continuously for many months.
Others are needed only in the vicinity
of the planet. These must turn on
reliably, with the correct calibrations,
after the long exposure to space vacu¬
um and radiations. All equipment
aboard the spacecraft must operate
perfectly the first and only time it is
given a completely realistic test. Once
the launch button has been pushed
there is no opportunity to make an
adjustment or to replace a component.
Mariner IV, which flew past Mars
on July 14, 1965, illustrates the scien¬
tific instruments aboard a planetary
spacecraft.
In Mariner IV, the television system,
mounted on a platform, was designed
to scan the sky near the planet until

the planet and pointed the camera in
the proper direction. The platform
remained fixed while the motion of
the spacecraft across the planet allow¬
ed the camera to take a series of
photographs of the surface. These
were stored on a magnetic tape and
later played back to earth. The tele¬
vision system weighed 5 kilogrammes
(11 pounds) and required 8 watts of
power.
Data from these instruments, and
from 90 others measuring spacecraft
performance, were collected in a data
automation system, processed into
"digital" form, and routed to the trans¬
mitter in the correct sequence. This
data automation system contained
about 11,000 components. It weighed
5.4 kilogrammes (12 pounds) and re¬
quired 6.5 watts of power.
The large amount of data received
from Mariner was processed at the
Space Flight Operation Facility in Pasa¬
dena, California. Within five minutes
of receipt of the telemetry signal, both
scientific and engineering data were
available for initial evaluation.
During the spacecraft's seven-month
journey to Mars, weekly summary re
ports and tapes were made available
to each experimenter at the laboratory.
The final data are being collected Into
a master data library. There, the Mar¬
iner-transmitted data, organized into
digital form, are available for computer
processing by the experimenters.
Mariner IV represents the most so¬
phisticated planetary spacecraft the
U.S. has yet launched. It performed
very well, but its capability was limited
by the 258-kilogramme (525-pound)
total weight constraint. The next gen¬
eration of spacecraft, the Voyager
series, will weigh more than ten times
as much and will be capable of mis¬
sions considerably more extensive.
Present plans call for both orbiting
and landing versions of Voyager, start¬
ing in 1971, for Mars exploration.
Later, Voyager will be used for a Venus
mission and possibly for others. The
detailed plans for the first Voyager are
not yet complete. Many experiments
have been proposed and are now under,
consideration. )
Exploration of the solar system has
indeed entered a new era. The two
foregoing examples planetary radar
experiments from the earth, and space*
craft experiments at other planets
offer spectacular opportunities for in¬
vestigating our neighbouring planets.
Radar experiments have shown that
solar system geometrical relationship
can be determined with extreme accur¬
acy, and that extensive new informa¬
tion on planetary surfaces can be ob¬
tained to supplement that from obser¬
vation with visible or infra-red light.
Unmanned spacecraft travelling to
the planets have demonstrated that
complex experiments can be operated
successfully at planetary distances,
and that these craft can obtain much
important information and permit close-
up observations of the planets with
television and other instruments.
Eventually such craft may convey
data from instruments landed on a
planet. Soft landings on the moon
have already been achieved by the
Soviet Union with Lunik 9 and by the
United States with Surveyor I.
Although a soft planetary landing
has not yet been demonstrated, the
results of Mariner and the work of
Surveyor I give us every confidence
that Voyager will indeed succeed in
making surface observations of Mars.
