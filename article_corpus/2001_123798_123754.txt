The tide turns
in Central A s i a
Geography, the Soviet legacy and population growth are forcing
the five countries of Central Asia to cooperate closely in a region where
water is still used as a weapon
L
ast winter, as usual, I found myself
without gas in my apartment in Bishkek,
the capital of Kyrgyzstan, and I cursed
neighbouring Uzbekistan for cutting it
off at the worst possible moment. Once
a g a i n , I was going to freeze for weeks on end.
What I didn’t know was that this time, Ky r g y z s t a n
was readying to hit back by using “the weapon of
water”as never before.
The Kirghiz simply opened the flood-gates of
their dam at To k h t o g u l , which supplies water to
both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan via the Syrdaria
r i v e r.Their excuse was that they had to feed their
hydro-electric power stations to make up for the
gas that had been cut off. But the Kirghiz meant
b u s i n e s s. The flood-waters swept away the
embankments in Uzbekistan’s Ferghana valley,
where people did not expect nearly so much water
in the winter. Further north the river was blocked
with ice, so the surge of water was diverted as it is
every winter towards the Aidarkul Basin.
This has been going on for three decades, w i t h
more water each year. Greater use of hydro-
electricity in winter means the power stations
discharge a lot of waste water downstream.As a
r e s u l t , the basin, which was once a desert, h a s
turned into a huge and useless lake that is
2 0 0 kilometres long and 30 km wide, and which
contains 16 k m3 of water that would otherwise
have flowed into the Aral Sea, where it is badly

Trading off
water and gas
This year’s “ r e v e n g e ” flooding was the biggest
e v e r. It lasted two weeks, yet drew only a few
complaints from the Uzbeks.The Kirghiz replied,
tongue in cheek, that after releasing so much
water they could no longer guarantee a supply in
the summer. The response from Ta s h k e n t , t h e
Uzbek capital, was swift. Five days later, the two
countries sat down to negotiate. Ten days after
t h a t , I had gas in my kitchen again.
The media was pessimistic about the talks.
But on July 12, it was announced that “the water
problem has been solved.” The deputy prime
ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Uzbekistan signed an agreement for the “ s e n s i b l e
use of water and energy resources.” Even though
this “ u n d e r s t a n d i n g ” was limited to a year’s
duration and was drawn up by purely technocratic
m i n i s t r i e s, it opened the door to multilateral
exchanges instead of the previously annual
bilateral accords. In exchange for electricity and
water from Ky r g y z s t a n , the Kazakhs will provide
400,000 tonnes of coal and the Uzbeks an
undisclosed quantity of gas.
But the big event came a few days later.A law
published in Bishkek on July 29 about “the inter-
governmental use of water resources, dams and
other water-related installations” took the region
into a whole new era. Modelled on the 1992 Dublin
D e c l a r a t i o n , the law stated that “water has an
economic value in all its competing uses and should

be recognized as an economic good.”
From now on, so long as the Kirghiz can get
their neighbours to respect the agreement, t h e
other countries will have to pay not just for the
water—making it a real commercial product—but
also for maintenance of installations and for the
hydraulic technology. If the region’s economic
powers react intelligently, there will be a
crackdown on wasting water—a major revolution
that could put an end to the sort of Soviet-era
vices that still taint the behaviour of ordinary
p e o p l e.
Absence of meters and
availability of free water for
irrigation has led to enormous
wastage in both town and
c o u n t r y. General inertia and
the abundance of water
produced by giant Soviet
installations have killed off
the art of irrigation learnt
over centuries.When water is
p r o v i d e d , it is done so only in
huge quantities that harm
both vegetation and people.
Parched soil becomes marshland.Thirsty people
are soon plagued by mosquitoes. But nobody
complains or criticizes.
The same apathy mixed with irresponsibility—
rooted in people’s attitudes for decades—has
produced utterly inadequate installations from
one end of the water supply chain to the other.
Water leaks from dams and canals. The much-
vaunted Turkmen canal has no concrete
f o u n d a t i o n , and so loses as much water in the
Karakum Desert it crosses as it provides for local
i r r i g a t i o n . Excess irrigation water is never drained,
so the landscape in Central Asia is dotted with
stretches of waste water or marshland, while at a
lower altitude, the starved Aral Sea is slowly
d y i n g. But the new law could put an end to this
scandalous history of waste.
A historic
w e a p o n
Will the people of Central Asia rally to
support it? Individually yes, collectively only
m a y b e. But their rulers must realize the danger
and take action, or else water will become a
powerful weapon in a region where cities were
once swept away because an enemy—Genghis
Khan—diverted rivers towards them, and oases
were destroyed because an invader—
Tamerlane—smashed irrigation canals.
After a centuries-long war between the
Uzbek emirates of Bukhara and Kokand for
control of the river Zeravshan, the Russians did
not manage to seize Bukhara until 1868, w h e n
they had cut off its water supply. The Soviets
made things worse first by creating small
mountainous states such as Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan that had copious amounts of water,
and states that were more powerful or wealthy—
K a z a k h s t a n , Uzbekistan and Tu r k m e n i s t a n —
but which had less water.A series of dams were
then built along the borders between the two
groups of states.
In 1911, about 15 million people lived in
Tu r k e s t a n , a region of central Asia that includes
Tu r k m e n i s t a n , U z b e k i s t a n ,
Ta j i k i s t a n , Ky r g y z s t a n , t h e
southern part of Kazakhstan
and Chinese Xinjiang. To d a y
there are 73 million
i n h a b i t a n t s, and the figure
could top 100 million by 2025,
imposing an even greater
burden on the water supply.
The Aral Sea is s t i l l
disappearing because of bad

hopes the same thing will not
happen to several endangered
o a s e s, such as the one at Bukhara.
The solution lies in closer cooperation
between the five Central Asian countries. O n l y
this can produce the mutual sacrifices needed if
the water is to be shared. ■
