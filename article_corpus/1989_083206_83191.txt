FRANCE'S BIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE
A LIBRARY IN ACTION BY FLORENCE CALLU
M*'-
FROM the time when Charles V,
king of France from 1364-1380, as¬
sembled a thousand manuscripts in
his library at the Louvre, French monarchs
dreamed of building up an encyclopaedic
library as witness to the culture of their
times. Collectors of books and patrons of
the arts have shared this concern and
amassed treasures which, whether or not
they ended up in the royal library, are part
of the heritage of France.
The descendant of the first royal
library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
has a prestigious collection of manuscripts
which it is dedicated to enrich and preserve.
Outstanding collections of
modern manuscripts
Through an active acquisitions policy,
the Bibliothèque Nationale seeks to com¬
plete its existing holdings when the occa¬
sion arises, and to build up new collections
through donations, purchases and gifts
received in lieu of payments to the state.
Gifts or bequests made by writers or
their families, or by collectors, are a very
important source of manuscript acquisi¬
tions. Exceptional bodies of work by
nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers
have been added to the collection in this
way, including manuscripts by Victor
Hugo, Flaubert, Zola, Apollinaire, Barres,
Anna de Noailles, Romain Rolland, Roger
Martin du Gard, Jules Romains and Miguel
Angel Asturias.

Page from Marcel Proust's notebook with drafts of Sodome et Gomorrhe (1922), part of his novel A
la recherche du temps perdu (Remembrance of Things Past). Proust rewrote passages on slips of
paper and pasted them over earlier drafts. The layers of paper have been separated and stored in
muslin envelopes at the Bibliothèque Nationale'; restoration workshop, so that the changing text
can be studied from the first draft to the ultimate version.
The main difficulty as far as purchases
are concerned is that forward planning is
rarely possible. In most cases documents
suddenly appear on the market at an auc¬
tion. If the pre-sale estimated price of a
manuscript is high, beyond the library's or¬
dinary budget, there is little time to obtain
extra funds. The Bibliothèque Nationale
was very fortunate in 1988, when special
funding from the Ministry of Culture and
Communication made possible the acqui¬
sition of the precious manuscript of Mon
coeur mis à nu by Baudelaire, Apollinaire's
poems Alcools, and a collection of poetry
by Verlaine.
The Bibliothèque Nationale has the
right to pre-empt a document offered at
public auction at the price paid for it by
the highest bidder (without itself taking
part in the bidding). Moreover, before a
manuscript can be taken out of the coun¬
try an export licence must be applied for
and submitted to the library for agreement.
If the library is interested, it can order the
work to be held by the customs and buy
it at its declared price. A microfilm copy
10

of the manuscript must be made in any
case before it leaves the country.
Among the great collections of con¬
temporary manuscripts bought since the
1960s are the papers of Proust, Valéry,
Claudel, Bernanos, Colette and Sartre.
In 1968 a law concerning donations to
the state in lieu of death duties provided
an additional safeguard to the French liter¬
ary heritage. Under this law, the heirs to
objets d'art may, after having them valued,
take them before a legal commission which
makes a ruling. Valuable additions to the
Proust and Martin du Gard collections
were acquired under this procedure.
In the strict sense, conservation of col¬
lections consists in keeping them in good
condition in surroundings where complete
security and freedom from pollution are
guaranteed.

todian of a valuable and fragile heritage,
brought together by the kings of France,
enriched with Church property confiscat¬
ed during the Revolution and by gifts and
purchases of quality made in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. Vigilant manage¬
ment is necessary in order to carry on a
tradition which has remained unbroken for
over five centuries.
FLORENCE CALLU, of France, is director of the
Department of Manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Na¬
tionale, Paris. She has published many articles and
essays on the preservation of manuscripts.
New techniques for
conservation and safeguard
Two basic problems arise in relation
to the manuscripts themselves their bind¬
ings and the surface on which they are
written or printed. Damaged bindings are
repaired by the Central Restoration Work¬
shop at the Bibliothèque Nationale. The
most valuable are placed in ventilated can¬
vas boxes, thus avoiding contact with the
shelves. Parchments, which are very resis¬
tant to wear, pose few problems, nor does
paper manufactured before the mid
nineteenth century. But paper made after
that date is at risk from a process of acidifi¬
cation and requires the use of recently de¬
veloped techniques to halt the damage (see
page 9).
These preservation techniques are
backed up by protective legislation passed
by the French government in 1977. Provid¬
ing access to information is one of the vo¬
cations of the Bibliothèque Nationale, but
a policy of accessibility to original
manuscripts, which would be seriously
damaged by too frequent handling, has to
be reconciled with conservation policy. A
special photographic workshop was opened
in 1983 in the Department of Manuscripts,
in which certain documents can be record¬
ed systematically on microfilm. These are
chosen on the basis of exceptional quality,
and the amount of use to which they are
subject. Microfilms, in monochrome for
text and in colour for illuminated
manuscripts, are gradually replacing the
originals for consultation purposes, and
readers are available in the microfilm
room opened in 1985.
