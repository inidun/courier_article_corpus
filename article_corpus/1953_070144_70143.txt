LETTER TO A SCHOOLBOY
on Unesco's General Conference
YOUR school club, you say, wantsyou to give a short talk on
"Unesco and its recent General
Conference"and you ask me to tell
you what you could say about this
Conference which ended a few weeks
ago.
Frankly, your question calls for
more than a brief answer and my
reply to you may be rather long. I
think there are a few basic facts you
might want to note down from the
start.
I ought to begin by explaining
that the General Conference is the
chief governing body of Unesco and
in the past has met once a year
either in Paris or some other capital
city. It is the General Conference
which decides on all matters con-
cerning the policy of Unesco, its
programme and its budget. Each
of the countries belonging to Unesco
can send official delegates to the
Conference, and each nation has
one vote.
As you know, the recent General
Conference was held in Paris and
lasted from November 12 to De-
cember 11. When it opened there
were 65 Member States in Unesco ;
of these, 60 sent a total of 400 offi-
cial delegates. In addition, various
other international organizations, as
well as important private and semi-
private groups, sent 80 observers
who could follow all meetings, but
not, of course, vote.
The delegates came to Paris from
all parts of the world to decide on
many questions concerning Unesco,
but principally they met to examine
its programme of work and to de-
termine exactly what activities
Unesco should undertake in the next
two years, and how much money was
required to pay for these activities.
The Conference elected as its
President, Professor Sarvepalli Rad-
hakrishnan, one of the leading
thinkers of modern Asia, who is to-
day Vice-President of the Republic
of India. But a few days later, he
received a message recalling him to
India for urgent matters of State.
The Conference then elected the
head of the Pakistan delegation, Mr.
S. M. Sharif, as Acting President.
After these introductory remarks,
I want to tell you something about
the new Unesco budget since you
specifically asked me to do so. The
money to pay for Unesco's activities
comes from its Member States, each
of which contributes a part of the
total, the percentage varying accord-
ing to countries. In addition, cer-
tain sums are also obtained from
outside sources, but since they do not
affect any member's percentage con-
tribution they are called"non-bud-
getary income."
For the two years 1953 and 1954,
the General Conference voted a
Unesco budget of 18 million dollars,
adding $ 712, 964 from non-budgetary
income. But there is a catch to the
figure of 18 million dollars. It is
the real budget of Unesco in name
only. For when they voted this
sum the delegates realized that
Unesco's working budget for the
next tVTo years would be really
$ 17, 056, 964. Let me explain why this
is so.
As you know, there are always
people who fall behind in paying the
money they owe. The same is true
of countries and governments. From
past experience, the General Con-
ference had worked out that 9. 2 per
cent of a given budget was not re-
ceived from Member States. It
therefore decided that in order to
avoid a financial crisis toward the
end of every year, only the amount
that could be counted on would be
spent by Unesco. This explains
why only 17 million dollars can be
spent instead of 18.
You say you have read in the
newspapers about the resignation
of Mr. Torres Bodet as Director-
General. You know then that his
departure followed the discussion by
the Conference of the budget for the
next two years, and that pending the
appointment of his successor next
April or May, the Deputy Director-
General, Dr. John W. Taylor of the
United States, was named Acting
Director-General. You also know
that the Conference accepted Mr.
Torres Bodet's resignation with the
sincerest regret and that all the
delegates praised his leadership of
Unesco during the past four years.
You may have seen that three
new members were admitted to
Unesco by the Conference-Spain,
Nepal and Libya-and that after
Poland decided to withdraw from
Unesco, the Conference asked the
Polish Government to reconsider its
decision and join once again in
Unesco's work.
You have probably also read that
the permanent headquarters of
Unesco are to be built not far from
the Eiffel Tower of Paris, and that
from now on, Unesco's General
Conferences will be held every two
years instead of every year, the next
one in 1954 to take place in Monte-
video, Uuruguay.
The information I have given you
so far will, I hope, help you in pre-
member governments to improve
their schooi systems through special
missions of educators, technical
experts and advisors, as well as by
conducting international seminars
so that teachers from different
countries can exchange their infor-
mation and techniques.
Half of the people of the earth live
in ignorance, poverty and disease.
Unesco will continue to help many
of its member countries to give
their people the"fundamental
ducation"that will enable them to
achieve a decent standard of living.
A Fundamental Education Centre
to train teachers is soon to be
opened near Cairo, Egypt, similar to
the one now operating at Patzcuaro,
Mexico. Graduates return to their
home countries to instruct more
Fundamental Education teachers,
so that the thousands of men
and women who are needed to carry
on the fight against poverty and
illiteracy can be provided.

paring part of your talk, but you
will still have to speak about the
essential point of the General Con-
ference.
*
What is this essential point ?
Simply this : the programme of
Unesco-the programme as it was
shaped with infinite precision and
exactitude by all the delegates dur-
ing weeks of careful study, in com-
mittee and small group meetings. If
you would study this programme it
would enable you to measure the
work of the Conference, and perhaps
more important, the future work of
Unesco in 1953 and 1954. For the
talk you are preparing for your club,
you cannot, of course, and I don't
think you will want to, go into any
great detail about Unesco's future
activities. Here though, are a few
things I believe you may be inter-
ested to report.
Education will continue to play a.
major role in the work of Unesco.
Unesco will continue to help its
Such expressions as"free and
compulsory education""equality of
education for women"and"adult
education"may make you and the
members of your club think of dry,
unending scholarly reports. In real-
ity they mean more schools for
young Arab refugee children in the
desert sands of Palestine, a mission
to help Korea rebuild its destroyed
school system, and the efforts of
ordinary men and women to give the
people of Latin America, Africa, the
Middle East, and South-East Asia
their right to education.
The members of your club, like
most people today, are probably in-
terested in science. In your talk
you might want to tell them of some
of the great scientific questions of
our modern world with which Unes-
co will be dealing in the coming
years. There is the work on the
Nuclear Research Centre in Europe,
which will try to harness atomic
energy for peaceful purposes so that
it can enrich our daily lives ; there
is the effort which will be made to
find ways of pushing back the front-
iers of the deserts and making the
semi-desert lands fertile ; and then
there is the less spectacular but
nonetheless important example of
the continuing work of the Unesco
Science Co-operation Offices which
form a network across all the conti-
nents to help scientists, industries
and universities.
One of the great problems of our
troubled times is to forge an instru-
ment capable of bringing nations
together, of fostering true collabora-
tion amongst them, and an aware-
ness of their interdependence.
This, Unesco has made it its duty to
work for in the past and will con-
tinue to do in the years ahead.
During 1953-54, Unesco will promote
a special programme of interna-
tional discussions dealing with the
cultural relations between peoples,
bringing together leading thinkers
and creative artists. It will pursue
its campaign against racial prejudice
and for the application of human
rights in the different regions of the
world, and will continue the social
studies it has undertaken on the
causes of national and international
tensions and on the prevention of
conflicts. It will continue to work
for the increase of international
fellowships and travel possibilities
abroad.
In this respect, I believe you will
be particularly interested to hear
that Unesco will soon launch a new
"Travel Coupon Scheme"to make it
easier for students, teachers and
research workers to study or carry
on their work abraad.

This letter has grown rather long,
but I hope I have been able to give
you at least a few indications con-
cerning Unesco and its recent Gene-
ral Conference which may help you
in preparing your talk.
I think, too, that you will be able.
to form your own opinion about the
'''crisis''which you read of in con-
nection with the Conference.
It is true that the discussions
during this Conference revealed a
great variety of opinions on a num-
ber of serious problems ; and there
were moments when it seemed dif-
ficult to reconcile the various view-
points touching the very principles
of the Organization. But as the
days went by the delegations suc-
ceeded in achieving a unity of pur-
pose and in harmonizing their di-
vergencies.
In his closing speech to the Confer-
ence, the Acting President, Mr.
Sharif spoke of"the great crisis that
was overcome, thanks to the faith
in Unesco of the representatives of
the Member States and thanks also
to their determination that Unesco
should pass bravely the temporary
hesitations and falterings that are
inevitable in the life of any vital,
growing and developing Organiza-
tion."
He went on :"I am happy that the
Conference has adopted the reso-
lution presented by the Indian Dele-
gation and supported by the Delega-
tions of the United States and
Pakistan. This resolution stresses
the immensity and urgency of the
task lying ahead and calls upon
Member States to increase their
efforts for the development of
Unesco's work. I sincerely hope
that the Member States will recog-
nize the vital importance of Unesco
and give it their support in an
increasingly greater measure.
"let us hope that the crisis we
underwent has strengthened our
inner convictions, for Unesco's vital-
ity will depend on the force of that
conviction even more than on any
outward action we may take."
I think you would find it fruitful
to ponder this address for it might
well suggest to you"what you could
say about the General Conference".
For does it not show that what
counts above all is the programme
of Unesco, the work that still re-
mains to be done by all of us, includ-
ing the members of your club and
you yourself ?
