acetylene ilares, in a long-drawn-out, speechless ceremony we
drank tea."
THEY HOPE TO
HARNES'S THE STUN
OMEN, camels and don-
keys are the beasts of
burden of the Sahara.
And one enduring me-
mory 1 shall have will be a
caravan of women, with
camel-loads of wood on their
shoulders, filing over the dunes
in the heat of noon.
Another will be an Arab in
his burnous on a nickel plated
bicycle cycling to work in a
coal mine in the Sahara.
These two impressions are
not unconnected and have an
important bearing on my in-
quiry into what can be done
to arrest the advance of the
aesert and restore cultivation.
As we know with shivering
certainty the Sahara can be
excruciatingly cold and, apart
from keeping warm at nights,
the nomads have to find fuel
for their cooking. Wood is
scarce.
These women, about twentyof them. were nearly forty
miles from their oases. In
search of fuel, they will trek
for a week across the desert.
When they find it, they hack
the trees and destroy them ;
and with their destruction the
desert wins another victory.
The patch of soil breaks up
into drifting sand which in
turn may bury another fertile
plot.
So fuel for the desert 15 a
necessity only less important
than water.
And here, west of Colomb
&char, is a coal mine in the
midst of the desert. It em-
ploys 4, 500 miners and pro-
duces 30, 000 tons of coal a
month. It is not a pit. The
coal is mined by galleries
driven iBJto the decline of the
seam from the outcrop on a
hillside. Absenteeism must be
quite a problem because the
Arab miners are still nomads
who, when the floods come in
the oueds (intermittent rivers),
trek back to their valleys and
plough and sow their patri-
monial lands.
The seam at Kanadsa is only
16 inches thick and the coal
is inferior, but it serves for the
power-station which heats and
lights Colomb Bechar, is used
in the cement works, and hauls
the desert train. There is
also an export trade to Spain,
a thousand miles away across
the Atlas.
But another much bigger
seam, both in extent and in
thickness and much better in
quality, has just been discover-
ed about 40 miles farther into
the desert to the south. These
are remind'ers of the vast pri-
meval forests which once co-
vered this area.
Wallace says that there is
oil in the desert. And Wallace
ought to know. He is one of the
modern"men against the de-
sert". This geologist from
Oklahoma, six-and a half feet
tall, with buffalo shoulders and
a plaid shirt, has spent two
and a half years roaming the
Sahara with an Italian, a
Swiss, an Englishman and a
Scotsman, in two trucks and a
jeep (12 broken springs a
month) looking for oil for an
American oil company.
Sotar atomic Fite"
H 18. pet subject is not oi)but solar energy. Har-
nessing the sun may
seem an eccentric idea under
the clouds of Britain, but out
here every scientist (including
Wallace, who is a very good
one) is obsessed by it.
If one suggests that maybe
one day atomic piles will pro-
vide the Sahara with its
energy, they point to the sun
and say :"That's our atomic
pile. If the physicists would
work on that instead of bombs,
give us a reasonably efficient
solar engine, and tell us how
plants store the sun's energy
so tbit we can have solar bat-
teries for the hours oj dark-
ness, we could harvest the Sa-
hara."
They could stop the destruc-
tion of soil-binding vegetation
as fuel and have power to bore
and to pump water for irrig-
ation. Because everywhere they
tell me"We are walking on
water". At Zelfana (Lat.
32° 20"N., Long. 4° 25"E.),
there is a new oasis supplied
from a well nearly 4, 000 feet
deep. But its importance is
much more local. It proves
the existence Of a vast under-
ground lake, which stretches
from the Atlas far into the
Sahara and elst to Gabes, on
the coast of Tunisia.
This"Albienne Layer"as a.
source of water has been the
speculation and dream of geo-
logists for over half a century.
Many attempts have been
made to tap it and to prove its
extent, but they all failed until
the water gushed from Zeal-
fana.
Boring to such depths needs
energy, and oil for the drillers
is expensive in the Sahara.
Maybe the sun could be used
to do the boring.

Science Editor of the London
News Chronicle
Ritchie Calder, Science Editor of the London News Chronicle,working in collaboration with the Natural Sciences Depart-
ment of Unesco, is making a personal survey of the work
going on to reclaim the deserts of North Africa and the Middle
East for human use. He is not only carrying out an important
investigation, but a unique educational and reportorial task of
explaining to the men and women of many countries what can be
done to make the deserts useful so that they will agree to support
and help carry out the necessary measures.
The series of articles Ritchie Calder is writing for his newspaper
is being distributed to newspapers throughout the world by Unesco
and the information he gathers is being used in the preparation
of textbooks and filmstrips for schools. The results of his studies
will be widely used in school courses in England dealing with
history, scripture, economics, geography and current affairs.
Last month, the Unesco Courier published three reports from
the Algerian Sahara where the survey began. On this page are
reprinted the next three stories in the"Men Against the Desert"
series, in which Ritchie Calder deals with other aspects of the
struggle against this classic desert of all deserts, and reports
on what is being done to reclaim the wastelands of Tunisia.
THE holy man of the
t marsh sent a turbaned
negro barefoot to inter-
cept our convoy and to sum-
mon us to his cave."Summon"does not convey
the sociable invitation to
drink ceremonial green tea,
but it had the weight of a
command for the engineers
who are planning to remove
the marsh from underneath
his feet. For the mvabout
(M u s 1 i m saint) of Ain
Skhouna has mystical sanc-
tions over the people of an
area as large as Belgium and
to offend him might be se-
rious. So we headed the
jeeps across the marsh to the
mound-near-the-hot-
spring (which is what"ain
skhouna"means) and were
received by the white-robed
marabout surrounded by his
brotherhood.
Then he led us to his Mara-
bout (which is the name for
the holy place as well as the
holy person). The hut of
sun-baked, whitened bricks
seemed too small to receive us,
but this was only the vesti-
bule of a network of caves.
We went down into the re-
ception cave, carpeted with
rich rugs, on which we sat
cross-legged. And by the light
of acetylene flares, in a long-
drawn out, speechless cere-
mony we drank tea.
All this took place in a
great Swamp--Chott ech Cher-
gui or Southern Marsh which
is cradled between the Tell-
Atlas and the Sahara-Atlas
and is the site of one of the
warid°a most imaginative and
ambitious projects. It will
cost at least t 120, 000. 000.
Into this basin, a fifth of
the size Of France, 2, 500 feet
above sea level, drains or
seeps the seasonal rains which
deluge the two mountain sys-
tems. During the few brief
spasms in the wet season (as
I have seen) the Chott is a
KASSERINE (Tunisia)
TT'ASSERINE was a battle-fields. It still is. During
the war, this was the
scene of disaster both for the
Allies and for the Germans.
Today, a new battle is be-
ing waged ; massive machines
trundle across the valley. Men
dig in and shots are fired.
Searchlights play in the Afri-
can darkness. But the only
adversary is the desert itself.
Kasserine stands strategic-
ally at the end of a pass which
is a junction in the mountains,
giving access north and south,
east and we : t, but it is also a
centre of the Lost Lands.
The Lost Lands are whnt I
have been investigating in Tu-
nisia. These lands are not true
desert. Tunisia is not arid. Its
coastal belt shares the Medi-
terranean I'njnfall and the hin-
terland is by and large semi-
arid, with limited and inter-
mittent rains.
It does not need M. Sauma-
gne, the Tunisian Inspector-
General, with his lifetime
study of past civilizations, nor
shallow sea. Within a few
days, the sea has vanished
and there remains a treache-
rous, salty crust. What hap-
pens to the 14, 000 million
cubic yards of water which
pours down on this catchment
area ?
It is a problem which has
intrigued geologists and hy-
drologists (water scientists)
for a long time, but it was
M. Gautier, chief of the Scien-
tific Bureau of the Algerian
Service of Colonisation and
Hydraulics, who suggested the
answer which may make Ciiott
ech Chergui one of the won-
ders of the world. This
"man against the desert"
made his observations by air.
He decided that the Chott was
a great evaporation pan
which not only"steamed of !"
the surface rain (which is
useless anyway because it is
salted by the soil) but sucked
up and evaporated water from
the deep artesian layers.
NATURE'S WATER TANK
THE sum began to make
sense. Allowing for the
immediate loss through
evaporation in the mountains
and for the tiny fraction of
water yielded up in the wide-
ly-scattered wells of the Chott
basin (like the Hot Spring
itself). there must be under-
ground a vast reservoir reple-
nished annually by over
1. 000 million cubic yards of
water. And most of that
must evaporate through the
Chott.
The water is there and the
first charge will be to spread
man-made wells over the
desolate steppe where
20. 000 nomads drive their
flocks and camel herds across
the sparse pastures of desert
weeds to natural wells over
days'marches apart. It will
mean better vegetation, trees
for shade and better animals.
It will mean new oases on the
High Plateau.
But that is not the most
ambitious scheme. It is pro-
posed to shift the water of the
Chott to the rich but thirsty
fertile coastal plains beyond
the Atlas. At first it will be by
pumping the water through
concrete channels and tunnels
through the mountains for
fifty miles to the River Taht,
on which a barrage is already
being erected to distribute
this constant water supply to
the coastal belt. But the
second phase to be attempted
later, is even more ambitious.
It will dispense with pump-
ing and, instead, will tunnel
under the mountains and
under the Chott itself and
will draw the water, before it
evaporates, from the under-
ground reservoir.
The drop from the level of
the Chott to the coastal plains
will mean a terrific head of
water which will supply as
much electricity as Algeria at
present uses. It will bring
into rich, constant cultiVl1. tion
250, 000 acres of good land and
in addition slake the thirst of
the barren piateau.
All by stopping the desert
from perspiring !
MODERN TROGLODYTES
IN THE"LOST LANDS"
M. Tixeront, the chief engineer
of the waterfinding service, to
tell me that this is a man-
created wilderness. The evid-
ence of its past productivity is
there in abundance.
But I saw some of the worst
erosion I have met on this trip.
Great gullies and collapsing
hillsides scarred a desolation
which had once carried the
trees and herbage to tame the
rains and knit the soil..
MAN-MADE WILDERNESS
WE came to Kasserine byway of Sbeitl  and Kai-
rouran. Sbeitla was the
ancient Sufetula. Gregory, the
viceroy at Carthage of the By-
zantine Emperor, declared him-
self Emperor of Africa and
discreetly retired to the hinter-
land to build his own capital.
Sbeitla includes in its vast
ruins, preserved by the sands
of centuries, pillars from Ro-
man Carthage.
These ruins tell eloquently
the tragedy of the Lost Lands.
The Byzantines, threatened by
the Berbers (who killed Gre-
gory) and they, beset in turn
by the Arabs, turned their
homes into fortified granaries
with blind outside walls and
entered only by a ladder. The
land became only furtively
cultivated and declined into
wilderness, ranged by foraging
nomads.
That is what schemes like
Kasserine are designed to re-
dress. It was begun after the
Spanish Civil War as relief
work for three thousand refu-
gee Republicans. They started
the work on a barrage to di-
vert the waters of the Dherb
into channels where they could
be best used to irrigate the
land.
As living quarters the Spa-
niards dug themselves spacious
caves and became modern tro-
glodytes. It is disconcerting to
look up at an engineering feat
like the suspension bridge
which carries the conduit
across the gorge and find
family of well-dressed cave-
dwellers peering at you out of
a hole in the cliff-face.
Only about 50 Spanish fami-
lies remain but the work the
refugees started is beginning
to blossom in the decent in
which they settled.
Looking down on Kasserine
in the moonlight, M. Sauma-
gne said to me :"tell me that
there are ten men in the world
who believe that the desert
can be made to bear trtl. 1. t and
redeem the stupidities ot man-
kind, and 1 shall die happy."
