Declaration
of the Rights of the Child
By the present Declaration of the Rights of the Child, commonly known as the
Declaration of Geneva, men and women of all nations, recognising that Mankind
owes to the Child the best that it has to give, declare and accept it as their duty to
meet this obligation in all respects:
I. THE CHILD must be protected beyond and above all considerations of race, nationality
or creed.
II. THE CHILD must be cared for with due respect for the family as an entity.
III. THE CHILD must be given the means requisite for its normal development, materially,
morally, and spiritually.
IV. THE CHILD that is hungry must be fed; the child that is sick must be nursed; the child
that is physically or mentally handicapped must be helped; the maladjusted child must
be re-educated; the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succoured.
V. THE CHILD must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
VI. THE CHILD must enjoy the full benefits provided by social welfare and social security
schemes; the child must receive a training which will enable it, at the right time, to
earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
VII. THE CHILD must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted
to the service of its fellowmen.
