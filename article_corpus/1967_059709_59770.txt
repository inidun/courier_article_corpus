Did Japanese fishermen 
bring the art of pottery making 
to Ecuador 3,000 years ago?

U P until relatively recent 
times, it was believed that two hearths 
of New World civilization, Mesoamerica 
and the Central Andes, had achieved 
their developments independently, or 
at best with a minimum of intercom- 
munication. However, better know- 
ledge of the cultural sequences in both 
areas has made it increasingly evident 
not only that a great deal of inter- 
change took place, but that it began 
at a relatively early time. 
During the early Formative period, 
traits of basic significance were passed 
from one region to the other, including 
pottery making and certain species of 
domesticated plants. Beginning shortly 
before the Christian era and continuing 
to the time of the Spanish Conquest, 
evidence of contact is more abundant, 
perhaps the result of planned trading 
expeditions. 
Flat and cylindrical stamps made of 
pottery, small pottery masks, numerous 
details of costume and headdress are 
among elements introduced onto the 
coast of Ecuador from Mexico, while 
the figurine mold, shaft and chamber 
tomb construction, and metallurgy are 
among traits that moved from south 
to north. 
The principal foci of contact appear 
to have been the coasts of Ecuador 
and southern Mexico, and many of the 
exchanged traits were adopted spor- 
adically or not at all outside of these 
regions. Others, however, were widely 
diffused. How significant this inter- 
change was in stimulating the process 
of cultural development in either region 
is a question still unanswered. 
Another long cherished belief that 
has recently been challenged is the 
independence of New World cultural 
development. Until the last decade, 
the majority of archeologists viewed 
New World prehistory as an isolated

Until the last few 
years it was 
believed that the 
civilizations of 
pre-Columbian 
America had evolved 
independently from 
cultures in other parts 
of the world. The 
latest archaeological 
findings however point 
to the fact that 
some 5,000 years ago 
fishermen from Japan 
must have crossed 
the Pacific and landed 
at or near Valdivia 
Bay on the coast 
of Ecuador, where 
they initiated the 
local fishermen into 
the art of pottery 
making. The photos,

amazing similarity 
of patterns between 
the Jomon pottery of 
Japan and the Valdivia 
pottery of Ecuador. 
Shown here are only 
five comparative 
illustrations from 
a host of other 
examples equally 
remarkable in their 
similarity and which 
leave little doubt as to 
their Japanese origin.

The coastal civilization of 
fishing people which developed 
in Japan nine thousand years 
ago founded what is now 
called the Jomon Culture.

phenomenon, and resemblances be- 
tween cultural traits or complexes in 
Asia and America were interpreted as 
due to parallelism or convergence. 
As the chronological, geographical 
and contextural circumstances have 
become better known, however, it is 
increasingly evident that this explana- 
tion can no longer be accepted un- 
critically. Nor can we be certain that 
transpacific introductions were insigni- 
ficant in their effect on developing 
New World culture. 
Investigations of the origin of pottery 
making on the coast of Ecuador have 
produced the suggestion of a trans- 
pacific introduction from western Japan 
around 3000 B.C. The appearance of 
a complex of ceremonial traits includ- 
ing head rests, small house models 
with Asiatic architectural treatment, 
and a special type of panpipe, in ap- 
proximately the same area several 
thousand years later seems best 
explained as the result of another 
Asiatic introduction, this time from the 
Malay peninsula. Many components of 
Maya art, architecture, astrology, cal- 
ender, mythology, symbolism and 
ritual have Asian counterparts, and it 
is becoming increasingly improbable 
that independent development can 
have produced them all. 
Although we are far from under- 
standing the nature and extent of 
transpacific contact, it is safe to affirm 
that the rise of civilization on the Old 
and New Worlds was not an inde- 
pendent phenomenon, and that theories 
concerning the inevitability of a cultural 
evolutionary process leading from 
savagery to civilization must take this 
factor into account. 
If the evidence has been correctly 
evaluated, it suggests that the Bering 
Strait was not the only route by which 
new cultural traits were introduced 
into the New World. 
Pottery appears on the coasts of 
Ecuador about 3200 BC. as a major 
component of the Valdivia culture. The 
earliest material is competently made 
and tastefully decorated, although 
thick walled. Vessels are large rounded 
T
R
 
bowls and small jars with slightly 
constricted or insloping upper walls. 
Surface treatment ranges from un- 
polished through incompletely polished 
to lustrous and a high proportion of 
vessels are red slipped on the exterior. 
A variety of decoration was produced 
by simple instruments such as a piece 
of shell, a sharpened stick or a finger 
drawn across or punched into the 
surface. Although Valdivia pottery 
incorporates no complicated vessel 
forms or techniques of decoration, it 
is clearly the product of a long tradi- 
tion of ceramic development. 
While our knowledge of New World 
prehistory is still far from complete, 
the outline now beginning to take 
shape leaves no gap into which such 
an evolution could fit. On the other 
hand, across the Pacific on the island 
of Kyushu, Japan pottery dated around 
3000 B.C. not only closely resembles 
that of the Valdivia culture, but can 
‘be traced back over several thousand 
years to increasingly primitive forms. 
I. makers of Early Middle 
Jomon pottery in Japan lived either 
along the coasts or in the mountain 
valleys. The inhabitants of the coast 
were shellfish gatherers and fishermen, 
like the contemporary coastal inhabi- 
tants of the New World, and their 
general level of social and cultural 
dévelopment was very similar. 
An important difference was that 
pottery making had been acquired by 
about 7000 B.C. From an original 
simple conical-based, vertical-walled 
all-purpose container, decorated with 
incised, rouletted or cord-marked 
designs, there developed a variety of 
more complicated bowl and jar forms 
and more elaborate techniques of 
decoration. This gradual evolution is 
clearly preserved in an archeological 
record composed of hundreds of 
Jomon sites. 
The contrast between this long 
record and a blank in the New World 
prior to the appearance of Valdivia

pottery, the striking comparability 
between the ceramic complexes on the 
two sides of the Pacific, and the 
coincidence of the initial Valdivia dates 
with the dates for pottery with the 
same characteristics in Japan, lead to 
the conclusion that the two occur- 
rences must be of common origin. 
An introduction via an overland 
route across the Bering Strait is un- 
supported by any evidence. On the 
other hand, the presence of bones 
of deep sea fish in Jomon sites, as 
well as the discovery of several dugout 
canoes of Jomon age, attest to the 
fact that these early fishermen 
ventured far from shore. 
The modern Polynesians possess 
the knowledge required to survive for 
weeks on the open sea, and the Jomon 
fishermen can be credited with similar 
skills and endurance. Such a craft, if 
blown far from land by a storm and 
left to the mercy of winds and currents, 
would have been propelled across the 
northern Pacific and down along the 
coast of the New World. The jutting 
coast of Ecuador marks the end of this 
route ; failing a landing here, a drifting 
craft would be borne again westward 
across the Pacific. 
Such a journey might have required 
close to a year, and all of the original 
occupants may not have survived. 
However, at least one survivor is 
required to account for the elements 
characterizing the original pottery of 
the Valdivia culture. Such a survivor 
would have found the coastal Ecua- 
dorians living very much as his own 
people had on the coast of Japan, with 
the principal exception that containers 
of perishable materials were the only 
type known. 
The newcomer knew how to make 
pottery, and in teaching the Ecua- 
dorians introduced the vessel shapes 
and decorative techniques and motifs 
with which he was familiar, So apt 
were the pupils that they soon equalled 
or even surpassed the products of 
their contemporaries in Japan.
