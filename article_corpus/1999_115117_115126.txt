It is not easy, in the glassy canyons of San Fran-
c i s c o ’s financial distri c t , to walk a block amid the
early morning commuters without passing a
huddled heap—a person without a home—stret-
ched out on a bed of cardboard. B e g g a rs sitting by
garbage cans hold out frying pans for change from
manicured ladies. In the subu r b s , a new underclass
of scave n g e rs wheel stolen shopping carts miles
through the streets, heaped with the bottles and cans
they trade in for a pittance at the recycling centre.
Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New Yo r k ,m ay
have chased the vagrants off the streets of Man-
h at t a n , but the reality of pove rty for most ordinary
Americans is all too plain to see.How is it that the
richest nation in the industrialized world main-
tains a pove rty level that has hovered around 13 per
cent for a good two decades (and 16.5 per cent in
1997)?
Welfare is for those
who fall by the wayside
Wealth in the United States accumulates at
wa rp speed, but it concentrat e s.The richest 20 per
cent of A m e ri c a n s , according to UN Deve l o p m e n t
P r o gramme fig u r e s ,e a rned 8.9 times more than the
poorest 20 per cent.Yet the majority of the A m e ri c a n
e l e c t o r at e , as far as one can ascert a i n , is not uncom-
f o rtable with this equat i o n .Witness President Clin-
ton’s last State of the Union address, in which he
boasted of cutting the welfare rolls in half, offered
little or nothing that might materially improve the
existence of the poor—and rapidly earned himself
approval ratings of 76 per cent in the polls.
One thing is clear.The United States does not
have a social contract.This “new” nation of hete-
rogeneous states has never acquired the respect for
an all-providing, munificent central authority that
the European nation states inherited from the
m o n a r c h i e s. A m e ricans are deeply suspicious of
g ove rn m e n t , and reluctant to pay for anything that
might expand its operat i o n s.Their rates of taxat i o n
remain the lowest of the industrialized nat i o n s.T h e
p rinciples of utilitari a n i s m ,s t riving for the gr e at e s t
b e n e fit for the gr e atest number, h ave never found a
s y m p athetic hearing in a society that prides itself on
its worship of the individual.
M e a n w h i l e , the Protestant work ethic perva d e s
political discours e .We l fare in A m e ri c a , in the shape
of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, was
o ri ginally intended to benefit widows or wo m e n
with children born out of wedlock—reserved for
those families that could not depend upon the ear-
nings of a male householder. S o m e h ow, there is an
indelible association in the American psyche that
makes it immoral to live off the state.Where Euro-
pean national insurance plans espouse unive rs a l
e n t i t l e m e n t , we l fare is for those who fall by the
wayside.To be poor in America carries in a certain
measure the stigma of sin—a failure to realize the full
potential of being A m e ri c a n , which means the
potential to better one’s condition.
The fact remains that the American working
class has only sporadically played a determinative
role in politics, under the influence of radicals
i m p o rted from Eastern Europe or south of the
border, or among the relatively settled workforces
o f, for example, the auto industry. Most A m e ri-
cans identify themselves as middle-class, whether
they own an ancient Ford or a yacht and, always
hopeful of improving their lot, prefer not to identify
with those on the lowest rungs of the social ladder.
One can trace the weakness of A m e rican labour
back to the influence of Southern slave-owners on
the A m e rican polity, pressing for the extension of sla-
very as new states joined the Union and militating
against the political organization of labour in the
i n d u s t rialized nort h .And while solidarity in Europe
was built upon the shared values of a cohesive com-
munity at the beginning of this century, in the
United States,the constant pressure of new immi-
grant groups eager to join the workforce in the land
of opportunity has kept wages down and workers
acquiescent.
The result has been to keep those in power res-



2. The state
Individualism, an ethic of self-improvement,
and suspicions of big government help explain a situation in which a rich
nation tolerates high poverty levels
USA: the self-help gospel
To be poor in America carries

to realize the full potential 
of being American
M o re than 100 million

ponsive first and foremost to the interests of those
who help pay for their campaigns.The first order of
business for any American president is to pave the
way for the proverbial “healthy business climate”,
with his Tr e a s u ry Secretary close by his side. C a p i t a l ,
a lways holding in reserve the threat of a capital
s t ri k e , in the form of a slow - d own in wa g e s , o r
r e t r e at and relocat i o n , has managed to limit its
contribution to social expenditure.
A healthy
business climate
The interests of the disenfranchised count for
ve ry little in this context except insofar as they sur-
face as unsightly symptoms of urban blight, sus-
ceptible to grand invocations of the great spirit of
A m e rican vo l u n t a ri s m , as in President George
Bush’s “thousand points of light”.
And, indeed, there is a powerful strain of civic
responsibility at work in A m e rican communities, firs t
commented on in the 19th century by the French
historian Alexis de Tocqueville, which has made it
possible for gove rnment to spin off many of the
functions it performs in Europe to nonprofit or
r e l i gious organizat i o n s , whether in the shape of
hospitals, soup kitchens or shelters—in a form of
m i xed part n e rs h i p.This safety net, h owe ve r ,s h ow s
e ve ry sign of being shredded under the recent we l-
fare reform, as the two-year limit on drawing wel-
fare benefits comes up and ever more children fa c e
the prospect of going hungry.
Few politicians of national stature have made a
career as advo c ates for the poor. One is Je rry Brow n ,
former governor of California and twice presiden-
tial candidat e , who has spent much of the past
decade deconstructing the unquestioned assump-
tions of the American political agenda,such as the
need to cut we l fare and provide jobs. “ We need
more we l fare and fewer jobs,” he argued relent-
lessly on his radio programme “We the People”,
making the point that automation is inexorably
e ating up jobs and that A m e rica needs an “ i n c o m e -
maintenance system” guaranteeing the basic ri g h t s
of food,lodging, education and medical care to all
its citizens.
B r own now finds himself back in office as newly
elected mayor of Oakland,a battered municipality
across the bay from San Francisco with a large
black population that the cy b e r - wealth pouring out
of Silicon Valley has somehow managed to pass by.
This is a town so depressed that the supermarkets
h ave fled and where many people, too poor to ow n
c a rs , are forced to make a two-hour bus trip simply
to buy the most basic household necessities.
But Brown, in the first days of his tenure, has
turned his attention not to social programmes but
to police patrols in the desolate downtown area,
hoping to attract new tenants to the offices in the
empty skyscrapers. His order of the day: making
Oakland safe—for business. n
