When you make films and are lucky
enough to get one shown at a festival, y o u
can then set off round the world taking
your movie from one festival to another.
I t ’s a big opportunity,not just for making
your name–vital for those of us outside
mainstream cinema–but also because you
discover other independent films and
come to realize you’re not alone.
I have followed this fil m m a k e r ’s pil-
g r i m a g e, and have met fellow directors
in Ta i w a n ,South Ko r e a , Japan and Iran. I n
B e r l i n , N a n t e s, Rotterdam and at Sun-
d a n c e, I have also witnessed a powerful
new wave of films coming from Asia that
has coincided with a revival of fil m m a-
king in Latin A m e r i c a .There is no single
theme or style. Each film is different, b u t
all are intent on depicting real life and all
are made with paltry resources.
I shot one of my fil m s,R a p a d o ( C l o s e
C u t ) , with a grant from the Rotterdam
festival to write a script outline.What pays
for a synopsis in Europe can fund a whole
feature film in A r g e n t i n a . Having no
money isn’t a virtue,but it does focus your
mind and forces you to look for narra-
tive solutions that fit your budget. Ja p a-
nese filmmakers agree with us South
Americans that film schools should be
used as a nursery for directors and tech-
n i c i a n s, and as a way into the profession.
Buenos Aires now has more than 15 fil m
s c h o o l s, a profusion that can only inspire
people to make fil m s.
Has Western cinema lost its way?
M a y b e,but there are still some great direc-
t o r s. Films made in developed countries
these days tend to suffocate you with the
same tired old plots and easy images
drawn from ubiquitous television. In Iran,
you can still tackle a subject in a fresh
and innocent way and film something with
the feeling that you are showing it on
screen for the first time. Iranian film is
rife with this “ fir s t - t i m e ”e l e m e n t , and it’s
what gives it special strength.Fi l m m a k e r s
in Taiwan work under different condi-
t i o n s, but they too have managed to get
down to basics by delving into their coun-
t r y ’s past and casting light on a society
that sometimes doubts its very existence.
You can’t say the same for the Ja p a-
nese film industry, which has a long history
and is now rivalled by a fast-growing
audio-visual world of TV channels and
video games. Th e r e ’s no room for inno-
cence here, only crafty, intelligent and
subversive use of current formats. D i r e c-
tors from Japan and Hong Kong borrow
a d v e r t i s i n g, video and other well-worn
techniques to tell other stories and spark
a different set of emotions.
This upsurge of “new waves” may be
related to the general decline or disap-
pearance of government subsidies for
fil m m a k i n g.Apart from the United States,
where such help isn’t needed because of
the captive domestic market,g o v e r n m e n t
aid to local film industries has dried up in
most countries.The subsidies that remain
have in any case stagnated, with money
nearly always going to the same places. I t
would be tremendous if governments
were to back something that has now
begun to flower naturally in so many parts
of the world.
A lack of state support has perhaps
given rise to another trend. This is the
rise of new producers, individuals and
institutions working without any national
anchoring. It’s another form of globali-
z a t i o n , aimed at specific film projects
satisfying particular desires and needs,
bringing together people who share a
love for a special kind of cinema and a
wish to see something different to the
deathless fare served up by giant distri-
bution chains. ■
