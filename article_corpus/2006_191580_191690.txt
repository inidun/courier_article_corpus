MeMories of Bisotun
ven though decades have passed 
since my first trips to Bisotun, I re-
member each of them most vividly. 
Any archaeologist with a concen-
tration on Achaemenid Iran, and es-
pecially one with an interest in the 
reign of Darius the Great, has as-
suredly paid close attention to the 
texts and relief sculpture that came 
to be carved on the cliff face at Bi-
sotun in commemoration of Darius’ 
rise to power in 522 BC. In my own 
case, I quickly came to regard Biso-
tun as a unique store of knowledge 
to which I would need to return 
again and again.

sonal recollection usually comes to 
mind before all others. My eyes are 
tight shut (they have just filled with 
swirling dust), my fingers are pressed 
into two small recesses in the rock 
face, my legs are dangling, and I am 
all too conscious of the long drop to 
the nearest ground below me. You 

might well ask how an individual, not 
necessarily known for totally reckless 
behavior, would manage to get him-
self into such a predicament. 
At the time I had managed to bor-
row an unusually long ladder and was 
making my first visit to the high ledge 
that runs along the base of Darius’ ex-
traordinary rock-cut monument. I tried 
to take in as many expected and unex-
pected things as I could. I found that 
Major (later Sir) Henry Rawlinson, the 
first recorded modern visitor to reach 
that narrow ledge, had in fact carved 
his name on its flat surface. 
A second visit to Bisotun, made in 
the company of Professor George 
G. Cameron, served to remind me 
still more vividly of that great site’s 
storied past. It is common knowl-
edge that Rawlinson, first in 1836 
and then again in 1847, made ex-
ceptional efforts to secure reliable 
copies of the various cuneiform 
texts.

However, Rawlinson himself was 
never able to reach the one “unap-
proachable” overhanging rock on 
which Darius’ Babylonian inscrip-
tion had been placed. Finally, as 
Rawlinson relates, “a wild Kurdish 
boy… volunteered to make the at-
tempt.” Space does not permit a full 
description of the way in which the 
boy drove in one wooden peg on 
one side of the inscription and then 
“used the slight inequalities on the 
bare face of the precipice” to cross 
the rock and drive in a second peg 
from which, with the aid of a rope and 
a short ladder, he created “a swing-
ing seat, like a painter’s cradle.” But 
it was upon this fragile device that 
needed – and, in the early 1950’s, he 
decided to do whatever was neces- 
sary to obtain a state-of-the-art la-
tex impression. By an odd chance I 
can bear witness to certain aspects 
of this “last cuneiform adventure” 
at Bisotun. Towards the end of his 
long life, and some ten years after he 
had succeeded in obtaining his latex 
copies, Professor Cameron decided 
to revisit the Bisotun cliff. He felt the 
need for a younger companion and, 
since he already knew me, he was 
kind enough to ask me to accom-
pany him. 
After we had borrowed a long lad-
der from the oil refinery at nearby 
Kermanshah (now Bakhtaran) and, 
as we took the road back towards 
Bisotun, George Cameron told me 
how, years ago, he, too, had been 
able to find a clever helper of his 
own in a young man from the local 
village who was called Hasan. He 
described how Hasan essentially 
repeated the actions of the Kurd-
ish boy and in this way managed to 
erect a new swinging seat; and then 
he related how he carefully eased 
himself into the seat and duly paint-
ed on the latex solution before he 
waited for it to dry and then, at the 
last, peeled off the precious record. 
Finally, as we pulled up at Bisotun, 
Professor Cameron asked someone 
who was standing at the roadside 
if he could find Hasan and let him 
know that he – Cameron -- had re-
turned. In no time Hasan came in 
view: now a slim, neatly dressed 
man in his forties. Fervent greetings 
were exchanged. Then I looked 
beyond our little group to see an 
unexpected sight. It seemed that 
half the population of the village 
had gathered on the slope below 
us. The word had clearly gone out: 
“Cameron was back!”

the boy, following Rawlinson’s direc-
tions, proceeded to make a paper 
squeeze of the Babylonian text. 
Notwithstanding the essential 
success of this perilous endea- 
vor, George Cameron, who had 
served as the epigraphist on Erich 
Schmidt’s expedition to Persepolis 
in the late 1930’s, was well aware 
that a new record of the hard-to-
reach Babylonian text was greatly

And then, out the corner of my eye, 
I spotted – on the opposite side of 
a fissure of a certain width – what 
looked like a hitherto undetected 
rock-cut fire bowl. I am interested 
in fire altars and fire bowls (two 
frequently encountered material re-
flections of Iran’s ancient Zoroastri-
an identity) and I can only think that 
thoughts of Rawlinson’s intrepid de-
termination to copy each of Darius’ 
trilingual inscriptions somehow 
made me unduly adventurous. At 
all events luck was ultimately with 
me. My eyes cleared. I pulled my-
self up. I confirmed that the putative 
fire bowl was indeed such a feature 
(even if I have no definite answer as 
to why it was placed where it was). 
And then I managed to make my 
way back, this time with a better-
judged jump, to the relative safety 
of the main ledge.
