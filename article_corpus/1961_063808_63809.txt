OF WARSAW
An 18th century painter
of unmatched fidelity

the beauty of its past

To the people of Poland the
name Canaletto evokes Warsaw
not Venice. In 1767 Bernardo
Bellotto, better known as Canaletto
the Younger (not to be confused
with his uncle, Antonio Canalthe
famous Canaletto of Venice scenes)
arrived in Warsaw. He immedia¬
tely fell in love with the city and
remained there until his death in
1780. When he died he left behind
him a series of paintings of Poland's
capital of unrivalled fidelity and
exactness. His keen eye recorded
an inexhaustible wealth of detail
in living street scenes, details of
Warsaw's houses, churches and
public buildings and grandiose
panoramic views. When Warsaw's
architects sought to rebuild the
old town after wartime destruction,
they turned to Cahaletto's paint-
ngs to help them reconstitute the
buildings of the past (see follow¬
ing pages). Skyline on the Vistula
(top of page) with its recently re¬
constructed buildings reveals same
forms which Canaletto painted
(below and left) some 200 years ago.

CANALETTO HIS PAINTINGS HELPED
TO RESTORE A CITY
Canaletto's pictures have been
called a fascinating full-colour
film of Warsaw's life in the 18th
century ". He never painted any
building apart from its own surround¬
ings, but always showed it with
adjoining buildings, its square or
street with people and teams of
horses and carriages, and all the
traffic and life of the city swarming
about it. Warsaw's architects made
enormous enlargements of Cana¬
letto's paintings when they were
rebuilding the old town, but they
were often as fascinated by the
people in his works as by his build¬
ings. Canaletto recorded the fea¬
tures of Warsaw at a time when it
was becoming one of the most
beautiful towns of northern Europe.
The collection of twenty-five of his
townscapes is now hanging in
the National Museum, Warsaw.

of Warsaw's busy thoroughfares
when Canaletto painted it nearly 200
years ago. Top, opposite page, re¬

Sisters Church. Architects used
Canaletto's painting (bottom, oppo¬
site page) to guide them in rebuild¬
ing the church and nearby houses.
