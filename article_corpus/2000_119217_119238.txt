Three-dimensional imaging is increasingly used to recapture the appearance of ancient sites 
and legendary figures. But not everybody is happy about seeing the past through 3-D specta c l e s
■
“Come back from the land of the
dead!” is the startling exhortation
made at the beginning of a new tele-
vision film about Ramses II using digital-
ly-engineered images. The film, not yet
c o m p l e t e , b rings history ’s best-know n
pharaoh back to life from among his fel-
low mummies.
In one sequence, Ramses is puzzled
when he finds that his temple of A bu Simbel
no longer stands on the site where he built it.
It was moved by UN E S C O in the 1960s to
s ave it from flooding caused by constru c-
tion of the A swan Dam. But he goes inside
it when asked to do so by the god A m o n .
To d ay, the images engr aved on the inner
walls of the temple have lost their ori gi n a l
c o l o u ri n g, but they appear in the film in all
their former splendour.Thanks to French
archaeologist Cécile Breton,their brilliant
colours have been digitally restored.
“I worked from traces of colouring left on
the wa l l s ,” she say s.“Egyptian art was highly
c o d i fie d .We know a certain god’s crown should
be red and his hat should be blue, and that
I s i s ’s robe is either red or gr e e n . In the lat t e r
case we solve the problem by looking at other
temples where the colours have n ’t disappea-
red and choosing the more likely colour.”
Portraits in the round
The fil m ,which is scheduled to be show n
in September 2000, continues with an
account by Michel Eve n o t , an official of the
Pa ris Court of Appeal who for ye a rs compiled
identikit portraits for legal use. E ve n o t ,w h o
died in July 1999, was pleased to be invo l ve d
in the first attempt to make a three-dimen-
sional reconstitution from a mummy.
“ We were used to producing full-fa c e
and profile pictures,” he say s , which in two
dimensions (2-D), cannot be 100 per cent
c o m p at i b l e .F u rther research had to be done
so that the two images were perfectly consis-
t e n t . In 3-D, no “ c h e at i n g ” is possible.T h e r e
is no room for approx i m ations in digi t a l
models constructed from real dat a .
The Ramses II fil m , which is expected to
cost around $1.5 million, is a spectacular
example of the extraordinary potential of
new imaging technology for presenting the
wo r l d ’s cultural and monumental heri t a g e .
Initially developed for use in industry,
d i gi t i z ation and animation techniques can
be used to recreate the appearance of fa m o u s
h i s t o rical figures and sites that have cru m-
bled away or disappeared beneath the wave s.
They also make for more effective restora-
tion of fragile or badly damaged art wo r k s
and provide useful tools for archaeologi s t s
and curat o rs of museums and sites.
“These technologies can be used in two
ways with heri t a g e ,” s ays Benoît Coignard,
a French “ i n f o - s c u l p t o r ” .“ You can recons-
titute and preserve the shape of something
and use it scientifically in va rious way s ,a n d
you can recreate a world and an env i r o n m e n t
for people to marvel at .”
E x p e ri m e n t ation in 3-D imaging has pro-
l i f e r ated since the late 1980s. M a ny places,
from Egyptian heritage sites to ancient Indian
villages in Ohio, p r e h i s t o ric grottoes and
j e wels of A n t i q u i t y, h ave been made into 3-
D models for use in fil m s , on the Internet or
on interactive CD-Roms.The user can move
around freely, whether just taking a casual
look or carefully scrutinizing the image from
e ve ry angle. Specialists note that the tech-
nique is only in its infa n cy.
“There are still only a few centres where
this kind of work is underway at a sophisti-
c ated leve l ,” s ays John Hancock,of the Cen-
ter for the Electronic Reconstruction of His-
t o rical and A r c h a e o l o gical Sites, at the
U n i ve rsity of Cincinnati (U. S . ) .“ H a r d l y
a nyone is pursuing the level of architectural
and visual detail that is really required to
b ring ancient worlds to life.”
The obstacles are financial as well as
t e c h n i c a l . Synthesis imagi n g, which has
made tremendous progress in the past
d e c a d e , still cannot produce total realism.
H e ritage experts and engi n e e rs also some-
times have trouble understanding each other
and working together.The equipment is still
ve ry expensive ,e ven though prices are stea-
dily fa l l i n g .A 3-D scanner costs more than
$ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and making a computer model
of a two-metre-high statue costs about
$ 3 0 , 0 0 0 .This is not counting the cost of
r e s e a r c h , which makes the bill even bigger.
“If you want to work scientific a l l y,” s ays Bre-
t o n , “it can take a week of research to pin
d own the exact position of a door or a detail
of a piece of clothing.”
U n i ve rsity projects are funded by
g ove rnments or philanthropists. M a ny firm s
h ave become invo l ved as a way of testing
their new technology and getting publicity
for themselve s. Television stations and
museums also invest in producing educa-
tional or entertainment programmes and
along the way pay for archaeologi c a l
r e s e a r c h . But ove r a l l ,s ays Richard Lapointe
of Quebec’s Laval Unive rs i t y, these tech-
n o l o gi e s , under-used because they are so
e x p e n s i ve , are far from being generally ava i-◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
“Archaeologists spend their
time dealing with uncertainty
and think that when you
don’t know something, you
have to leave dotted lines in
the drawings. But 3-D images
force you to come down off
the fence.”

tion of new know l e d g e . At a prehistoric site
in the Ohio Valley, “the surrounding land-
scape context was restored to its original
condition in order to test astronomical ali-
g n m e n t s ,” s ays Hancock. In Greece,
a d vanced equipment belonging to Fran-
c e ’s stat e - owned utility Electricité de France
and designed for testing nuclear power sta-
tions,produced a far clearer impression of
the tholos (circular temple) at Delphi.
With the increasing threats to world heri-
tage from wa rs , p o l l u t i o n , urban expansion
and theft, back-up digital images of monu-
ments and objects could be extremely useful.
In A f g h a n i s t a n , for example, where the sta-
tues of Buddha in the Bamyan Valley have
been looted by the Ta l i b a n , Coignard say s
such imaging would have enabled the shape
of these remarkable objects to be recorded so
they could be reproduced in the future. B u t
the cost of such work is currently so prohi-
b i t i ve that only a few projects are underway.
One of them, the ECHO project run by the
U n i ve rsity of California at Berkeley (U. S . )
and sponsored by a group of big compa-
n i e s , seeks to record the shape of about 100
endangered Egyptian monuments.
These virtual clones can be used in res-
t o r ation wo r k . H e r e , the German city of
Dresden has played a pioneering role.A f t e r
G e rman reunific at i o n , the gove rnment deci-
ded to rebuild this “Florence on the Elba”
which had been bombed by the Allies in the
Second World Wa r.The city began by orde-
ring a computer model of one of Dresden’s
architectural jewe l s , the Church of Our Lady
(the Frauenkirche), an 18th-century church
which had been reduced to ru b b l e .
“When I presented the synthesized images
for the first time in 1993, there was an extra-
o r d i n a ry silence,” r e m e m b e rs Luc Génévri e z ,
who made them. “ People were we e p i n g .”
The virtual reconstitution, which drew on a
mass of historical documents and photo-
gr a p h s , was used as a guide in the real-life

l a b l e . “The world powe rs in heri t a g e ,
archaeology and technology are Europe,
N o rth A m e ri c a , Japan and A u s t r a l i a ,” h e
says. In these rich parts of the wo r l d ,
the new imaging technologies are start i n g
to be added to the archaeologi s t ’s toolkit.
They make it possible to “ d o c u m e n t ”
objects without touching or spoiling them,
says Philippe Martinez,an Egyptologist at
the French National Centre for Scientific
Research (CNRS).
In 1993, for example, a “ v i rt u a l ”
archaeological investigation reconstituted
the cargo scattered around an inaccessible
wreck that has been lying in more than 660
metres of water since the first century AD.
Three sets of photos were taken from a
s u b m a rine that glided over the site. T h e
pictures were then processed by a com-
puter to make a digital 3-D model.
In T h a i l a n d , the ancient capital of the
kingdom of Siam,Ay u t t h aya , has been “ r e a s-
s e m b l e d ” on a CD-Rom from vestiges scat-
tered around the modern city.The church of
C l u ny in France was once the biggest edific e
of medieval Chri s t i a n i t y. Little is left of it
t o d ay, but its appearance has been reconsti-
tuted thanks to  synthesized images.
Using 3-D scanners and digital cameras,
a r c h a e o l o gists report they can build models
from drawings with unprecedented accu-
r a cy.These models can help them to refin e
their interpretation of historical evidence.
“Hypotheses can be inve s t i g ated and tested
in new ways,” says Hancock.
“ We wo n ’t be able to say what ’s tru e , bu t
we’ll be able to say what isn’t true,” says
Martinez.“In 2-D, if part of the structure
gets in the way, you pick a new angle where
it doesn’t show and you get round the pro-
b l e m . In 3-D, e ve ry part has to fit perfectly
with the others.”
C o m p u t e rized simulation of archaeo-
logical hypotheses has often led to the dis-
proval of theories and even to the acquisi-
r e c o n s t ruction of the church,which should be
complete in 2003.The computer model wa s
also used in a televised appeal to Germans that
raised money for the project.
The advantages of imaging in heritage
restoration have also been seen in Alexan-
d ri a , in Egypt. Coignard tells how he recons-
tituted the city’s colossus in 1998 using
huge blocks of stone fished out of the sea.
“ We carried out a virtual reconstru c t i o n
by digitizing bits of the sculpture with a 3-
D scanner, m oving them around the screen
to see if they fitted together and then simu-
lating the reassembly of the whole statue.”
Since the head of the statue weighs three
t o n n e s , the arms several hundred kg and
the entire colossus about 20 tonnes, n o t
h aving to bother about weight was a gr e at
a d va n t a g e . “The best thing,” s ays Coignard,
“ was being able to test the equilibrium of the
s t at u e .With the colossus, whose fragments
were ve ry wo rn , we managed to come up
with a stable structure and a base which
fitted perfectly and in theory enabled the
s t atue to resist even eart h q u a k e s.”
The new virtual images have “ e n o rm o u s
p o t e n t i a l ” for visitors to museums, s ays Cliff
O g l e b y, of Melbourne Unive rs i t y, in A u s-
t r a l i a . More and more museums are instal-
ling multimedia facilities and commissio-
ning interactive products which both educat e
and entertain visitors.They can also display
and sell them on their we b s i t e s.
The museum next to the site of the huge
Roman amphitheatre at El Djem, in Tu n i s i a ,
t o d ay echoes as of old to the sound of gla-
d i at o rial combat . In France, the inaccessible
u n d e r water prehistoric site of the Cosquer
Grotto has been turned into a film of digi t a l
images which will be presented at the Mar-
seilles Museum in A p ril 2000. In many
p l a c e s ,major exhibitions of world heritage are
e n riched by interactive features that help
fund the museums where they are held.
Like television and the film industry,
Computer imaging recreates the face of pharaoh Ramses II (right) from his mummified body (left).

“video games make wide use of 3-D model-
ling of heritage sites to flesh out their adve n-
t u r e s ,” s ays Lapointe. “This is the i n f o rm a-
tion age and archaeology is being populari z e d
w h e r e ver there’s money to be made.”
Some historians and archaeologists are
u n c o m f o rtable with this mingling of 
different wo r l d s. G é n é v riez recalls the fuss
the scientific community made in the early
1990s when he was asked, as part of IBM’s
c o m m u n i c ation policy, to make synthesis
images of the Cluny church and the
Roman baths in Pa ri s.
Beware of bogus images
“There were tremendous battles among
the experts over the site, to the point where I
had to work out my own ideas about it and
finish the job by my s e l f.The resulting fil m
s t i rred up a dreadful row. I was accused of
h aving distorted ‘the tru t h ’ e ven though
nobody knew what the truth wa s. S c i e n t i s t s
are scared of pictures.” O f t e n , he say s ,n e w
technology upsets them because it makes
them question their practices and fa m i l i a r
ideas and forces them to make choices.
“ A r c h a e o l o gists spend their time dealing with
u n c e rtainty and think that when you don’t
k n ow something, you have to leave dotted
lines in the draw i n g s ,” s ays Breton.“But 3-D
images force you to come down off the fence.”
A lot of “bogus images”made from unre-
liable mat e rial are in circulat i o n , s ays Mar-
t i n e z .A r c h a e o l o gists also resent the fact that
people make no distinction between images
based on a massive amount of scientific wo r k
and images in video games.”From this pers-
p e c t i ve , the dangers of the virtual world are
r e a l . The general public is presented with
reconstitutions of ancient sites but has neither
the means nor the desire to question their
s c i e n t i fic quality now that technology can
produce images almost as good as photo-
gr a p h s.
But despite these reservat i o n s , more and
more scientists, especially in the English-spea-
king countri e s , are moving into 3-D model-
l i n g .“ A ny means of representation invo l ve s
c o n j e c t u r e s ,d i s t o rtions and the possibility of
m i s r e a d i n g s ,” admits Hancock. But these
d r awbacks are outwe i g h e d ,he believe s ,by the
a d vantages of increasing public awareness of
world heritage and the importance of pro-
tecting it. ■
In 1945, the church of Our Lady in Dresden (Germany) was reduced to rubble by bombing (top). 
The edifice is now being rebuilt (middle photo). To help the builders, the city authorities commissioned 
a virtual reconstruction of the monument (above).
