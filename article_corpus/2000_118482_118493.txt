Peace”.
F rom time immemorial,peace—in the sense of
peace between nations and peace within socie-
ties—has been exclusively based on the inter-
p l ay between justice and force, a relationship which
is at once conflictual and consensual.
Over 300 years ago, this idea was expressed by
the French philosopher Blaise Pascal when he wrote:
“Since force cannot be made to submit to justice,
men have made it just to submit to force; and since
justice cannot be fort i fie d , we justify force so that
justice and force go together and we have peace,
which is the sovereign good.”
H i s t o ry shows that peace has been and conti-
nues to be primarily an affair of state and of states,
based on the use of force—in other words,ultima-
t e l y, on recourse to wa r.This force is legitimized by
highly dive rse and in some cases contradictory
concepts of justice.
In our time, h owe ve r , the nature of war has chan-
g e d . Most often it is no longer waged between stat e s
but within their borders. C o n flicts within states have
become so widespread that wa r fare has never been
so rife—and in many cases so unnoticed—as it is
t o d ay. F u rt h e rm o r e , violence exists in all our socie-
ties in one form or another, e ven if it does not neces-
s a rily erupt into armed confrontat i o n . It takes many
f o rm s , and may even be considered the norm . I t s
most glaring symptom is the gr owth of inequalities
and the social exclusion to which this gi ves ri s e .
Societies torn to the point of disintegr ation by civil
war or violence are societies whose regulat o ry
mechanisms—the bodies which exist to settle
conflicts—are warped or paralyzed.
Some might say that this gloomy analysis heralds
a future in which war and violence will inevitably
prevail.The fact is,however,that these three deve-
lopments—the changing nature of wa r , the prolife-
r ation of different forms of violence and the we a-
kening of mediat o ry mechanisms, a process
a c c e l e r ated by globalization and the inform at i o n
r e vo l u t i o n — c r e ate a new arena in which a culture
of peace can emerge. And the prime mover in this
culture of peace will no longer be the state but the
i n d i v i d u a l , in other words each and eve ry one of us.
For surely the road to peace must start within
o u rs e l ves—in va l u e s ,b e h aviour and attitudes which
can foster a sense of community that is today threa-
t e n e d .Where else can the foundations of peace be
built but in our daily live s , through willingness to
listen and talk things through with others on equal
terms within the framework of a caring society?
The only obstacles to this enterp rise are those
we create ours e l ve s , because of ignorance or fa n a-
ticism or because of the selfishness that today we
are all too often asked to regard as the hallmark of
human identity.This approach requires more than



The fabric of peace

good intentions or the occasional act of generosity.
The capacity to talk and listen to others and be
r e c e p t i ve to their needs can pave the way to peace
through an acceptance of a shared responsibility
t owards other people as well as towards ours e l ve s.
The mainspring of the culture of peace is making
common cause with others in peace-building pro-
jects in eve ry d ay life, in what e ver area of society we
may be involved.
A participatory process
This message is not new.The culture of peace
is a fa b ric that has been woven for generations in all
s o c i e t i e s , though its practices are not necessari l y
d e n o m i n ated by that specific title. In some places
it may be known as tolerance, non-violence or jus-
t i c e . In others , as harm o ny, s o l i d a rity or conv i v i a l i-
t y.All over the world it has its defenders , some wo r-
king in obscuri t y, o t h e rs in the spotlight of public
l i f e . But its scope would be much smaller today had
it not been gi ven expression in the disinterested acts
of thousands of anonymous men and wo m e n
capable of listening to others , talking to them and
acting with them and on their behalf.
The concept of “a culture of peace”has clearly
not appeared from now h e r e . But to have a single
expression to describe a multitude of ethical and
practical initiat i ves may help to highlight their com-
mon purpose,make them more widely known and
b ring them together. It may sharpen the impact and
focus of movements that are active in a vast range
of fields and settings.
The importance of the culture of peace has now
been recognized by the world community. O n
N ovember 20, 1 9 9 7 , the General Assembly of the
United Nations unanimously proclaimed the ye a r
2000 as the Intern ational Year for the Culture of
Pe a c e . In taking this step, UN Member States accept
their own limitations and their urgent need for a
concept of peace that will be a part i c i p at o ry process
to which all members of society can contri bu t e ,
no matter how humble their circumstances.
The culture of peace is intended to be a rallying
point that transcends the treaties and agr e e m e n t s
that have so often been given short shrift by histo-
ry. It will become a real and living culture if we take
its tenets to heart and shape a common future in
our words and deeds.
UN E S C O’s role as the seedbed of the culture of
peace is inscribed in the opening words of its Consti-
tution:“Since wars begin in the minds of men it is
in the minds of men that the defences of peace must
be constru c t e d .”The text goes on to say “ t h at a
peace based exclusively upon the political and 
economic arrangements of gove rnments would not
be a peace which could secure the unanimous,
lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the
wo r l d , and that the peace must therefore be foun-
d e d , if it is not to fa i l ,upon the intellectual and moral
solidarity of mankind.”
One of the chief architects of UN E S C O’s Consti-
t u t i o n , the A m e rican poet Archibald MacLeish, u s e d
the following eloquent words when he addressed
UNESCO’s first General Conference in 1946:“The
peace to which the Constitution refers… is a condi-
tion of mutual confidence,
h a rm o ny of purp o s e , and co-ordination of activi-
ties in which free men and women can live a 
satisfactory life.” n
