A s protest movements go,the mass gat h e rings that shou-
ted down trade representat i ves and finance offic i a l s
over the past year in Seat t l e ,Washington and Bang-
kok bore few of the hallmarks of traditional opposition.T h e r e
was no formal hierarchy to speak of, no single nat i o n a l i t y, n o
clear shared cause. In the eyes of one pro-business gr o u p,t h e
new genre of activism mimicked a political “ swa rm .”
Yet though the dive rsity of the groups—from nort h e rn
steel unions to disappearing tribes—seemed to many cri t i c s
like rank incoherence, the move m e n t ’s leaders stress that this
ve ry va riety stands at the heart of their political project. I n
place of the uniform spread of commercial va l u e s ,d e rided by
leading U. S . campaigner Lori Wallach as a “one size fits all
p h i l o s o p hy,” they plead for new distri bution of power that is
porous enough to allow room for other interests.
“ T h e r e ’s been an invasion in inappropri ate spaces by
u n a c c o u n t a b l e , unalterable trade ru l e s ,” declares Wa l l a c h ,
whose public profile has soared since helping to c o - o r d i n at e
the Seattle protests as director of
the Public Citizen’s Global Tr a d e
Wat c h . “A ve rsion of the rules has
been imposed that has much more
to do with corp o r ate input than
the input from public interest . . . T h at ’s the democracy
d e ficit in the global economy.”
In the eyes of campaigners , the rapid, g ove rn m e n t -
a p p r oved spread of the free market has stripped political
d e b ate of any interest in the virtues that found a good society
or legi t i m ate global order.But the questions remain: h ow can
the corp o r ate bottom line be eclipsed with the least economic
damage? W h at reforms are needed, and where?
According to Walden Bello, e xe c u t i ve director of the
Bangkok-based Focus on the Global South, g l o b a l i z at i o n
must be rescued from its current “ m o n o l i t h i c, u n i f o rm and
u n i ve rsalistic character” t h at has seen transnational corp o-
r ations account for a majority of the wo r l d ’s exports and global
inequality more than double since 1960.
A chief culpri t ,he argues, is “the free market biases of the
f r a m e work pushed by the trinity of the World Trade Orga-
n i z ation (WTO) , the World Bank and the Intern ational Mone-
t a ry Fund (IM F) , which are fundamentally antithetical to the
s o rt of dive rse world that is conducive to equity. It is vital to◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
cut them down to size—make them just ordinary
a c t o rs among a plural set of actors in the global eco-
n o my.”
But the problem, as many activists agr e e , is that
there are scanty fora for these demands to be heard and
acted upon. N ational gove rnments are seen as weak in
the face of global fin a n c e , or in the case of deve l o p i n g
n at i o n s ,h a m s t rung by the obligations of IM F- s p o n s o r e d
debt reduction programmes and foreign aid. B u s i n e s s
itself has no wish to see its wings clipped, while inter-
n ational bodies—from the United Nations to the
WTO ’s infamous “ green room” trade talks, a l l e g e d l y
d o m i n ated by rich nations—appear saddled with unde-
m o c r atic structures and practices.The only way out,
c a m p a i g n e rs argue, is a radical remake of gove rn a n c e .
In the short - t e rm , the pri o rities are clear. For Wa l-
l a c h , the punch-drunk WTO must be swiftly leve l l e d :“ i t ’s
s h rink or sink for the WTO,”she say s.“ M a ny of our cur-
rent env i r o n m e n t a l , l a b o u r
and human rights agr e e-
ments are illegal trade bar-
ri e rs under WTO ru l e s.”
Besides a shrunken trade
o r g a n i z at i o n , activists also call for the wo r l d ’s two
main lending bodies to be stripped of the power to pres-
c ribe standard austerity packages. In Bello’s opinion,
the IM F and World Bank need to be balanced by an
a rr ay of other bodies including regional trading blocs
like AS E A N,strong labour and environmental agencies,
and an official body to represent developing coun-
t ri e s.This would gi ve “more space to take independent
p aths to deve l o p m e n t ,” he argues.
O ver the longer term , the proposals become hazier.

Of all levels of gove rn a n c e ,the nat i o n - s t ate seems the
least favoured by NGOs. Either as a result of the flawe d

c o u n t ries such as Brazil and India since World War II, o r
as a result of current political fa i l u r e s , few groups favo u r
