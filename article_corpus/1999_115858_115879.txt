The 144 employees of the T i m buktu air-
p o rt wrote to complain about their wo r k
c o n d i t i o n s.They were not receiving their
s a l a ries on time, back pay was due and paid
va c ations were going uncompensat e d .T h e y
d i d n ’t have the funds necessary to travel along
d e s e rt and mountain roads down to the capital,
B a m a k o, in order to present their complaint in
the fle s h .N o n e t h e l e s s ,M a l i ’s minister of jus-
t i c e ,D i a b até Hamidou, duly read their letter.
Cheick Coulibaly,a former sergeant in the
Malian army, raised a gri e vance dating back
to 1968, 8 ye a rs after the West A f rican country
gained independence from France.M r.C o u-
libaly wanted financial restitution for the five
ye a rs he spent doing hard labour during the
p e riod when he was politically at loggerheads
with the gove rn m e n t .Dressed in a traditional
long gown called a bu bu , with a white hat ,h e
read his letter directly to the gove rn m e n t .
M r. Coulibaly and the airp o rt employe e s
were among the 40 individuals and groups to
avail themselves in December 1998 of the
annual EID, Espace d’Interp e l l ation Démo-
c r atique (Democratic Question T i m e ) , a five -
year old institution that forms a bridge bet-
ween tradition and modern - d ay need for
finding direct solutions to problems that stat e
institutions have n ’t resolved conclusive l y.
D u ring turbulent times, A f rican chiefs
would often gather tribe members to talk
about problems, and thus hopefully preve n t
u n r e s t . In practice though, these gat h e ri n g s
were often tense and could erupt into vio-
l e n c e .When President Alpha Oumar Konaré
assumed power in 1992, he picked up the
tradition of consulting with his subjects by
holding open house on Fri d ays when people
could come to set forth their problems to the
g ove rn m e n t . It is thought that EID was the
n atural offspring of these meetings, w h i c h ,i n
contrast with the tribal gat h e rings of ye s t e rye a r ,
were always peaceful and  sometimes helped
the new president shape his gove rn m e n t a l
p o l i cy.
To d ay, once a year all Malian citizens are
i nvited to present their complaints before
p rime minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and
his entire cabinet. For ordinary Malians, i t ’s
their one big chance to make sure their vo i c e s
are heard.
Because only one out of eve ry five adult
Malians can read, a d ve rtisements for the EID
are not only run in newspapers but also on
radio and T V.Ads are in all 13 of the country ’s
o f ficial languages and in 1998 269 people
sent letters with their complaints.The relat i-
vely low letter response may be due in part to
the fact that a trip to Bamako is too expensive
for any but the richest Malian to contem-
p l at e .Another factor hindering part i c i p at i o n
a p p e a rs to be that many ve ry poor, i l l i t e r at e
Malians have no access to letter-wri t e rs.
M o r e ove r , despite new roads,more electri c i t y
and other positive signs since the change in
g ove rnment early this decade, m a ny poorer
p a rts of the country have hardly been touched
by Konaré’s administration and thus may be
sceptical as to whether any contact at all with
the gove rnment might be of use.
A 15-hour session
The complaints at the most recent EID ran
a gamut of problems, from birth control to
rights for the elderly. A young man had
endured deplorable prison conditions;a fat h e r
of four couldn’t afford the U.S.$15 per child
required for school enrollment; a medical stu-
d e n t ,while on a scholarship in Prague,was for-
gotten by his country and left to fight for his
life with skinheads;victims of traffic accidents
wondered if the roads would ever be safe; a
man was fired due to a sexual harassment
charge filed by a visiting A m e ri c a n ; h a n d i-
capped persons hoped that bu i l d e rs wo u l d
one day take their needs into account; firs t
w i ves spoke about rights granted to others
(up to four wives are allowed in this mainly
Muslim country ) . Almost eve ry sector of
g ove rnment was addressed.
Although complaints are limited to five
minutes each,e ve ry year EID goes on long into
the night and is broadcast live on ORT M ,
the country ’s only television stat i o n .The 1998
EID lasted 15 hours.R i n ging mobile phones,
o u t bu rsts of cheers and jeers and interm i s s i o n s
with songs and skits help keep spectat o rs
awa k e . Most interventions are voiced in
F r e n c h ,but because the option to speak in any
of the 13 languages is offered,some of the most
emotional pleas are voiced in the country ’s
most widespread language, B a m b a r a .
After all complaints were heard,g ove rn-
ment officials filed to the front of the Chines e -
built Hall of Congress to present their res-
p o n s e s.Unlike the many citizens who came in
colourful bu bu s , and were often barefoot,

most male ministers stuck to European-style
u n i f o rms of grey suits and ties.The two female
m i n i s t e rs (in the domains of communicat i o n
and the family) turned up in traditional
colourful dresses. One by one the ministers
responded to the complaints addressed to
their sector of gove rn m e n t .The gove rn m e n t
promised former Sergeant Coulibaly that it
would look into the request for compensat i o n
for his period of forced labour.
Each minister had received a copy of the
l e t t e rs addressing their sector well before the
EID began, and their responses frequently
sounded perfunctory.Often laws were invo k e d
and details cited that only a legal expert could
f o l l ow.But responses were officially recorded
and it is possible to review them in the year fol-
l owing the EID.
After reviewing the promises made by
the ministers at the 1997 EID and at the pro-
gress made in handling them six months
l at e r , last ye a r ’s honorary jury felt sat i s fied that
o f ficials were paying more than lip service to
E I D. The 1997 jury had made 12 recom-
m e n d at i o n s , including changes to inheri t a n c e
l aws to benefit wo m e n .EID seems to have had
at least an indirect impact on effecting change
in several instances. For example, the gove rn-
ment has committed itself to legal and other
steps aimed at doing away with excision, o n
the heels of complaints at previous EIDs
about female genital mutilat i o n . At a more
p e rsonal leve l , m a ny individuals who com-
plained about lack of electricity have had
their demands met. At an even more basic
l e ve l , a man who complained earlier that his
radio had been stolen had the object return e d
to him.
An international jury
L e a d e rs of Mali’s opposition parties refuse
to attend the EID which they joke stands for
“Espace d’Intox i c ation Démagogi q u e ”
( Fo rum for Demagogic Intox i c at i o n ) .O p p o-
sition part i e s , r a n ging from prominent
Marxist-Leninist cells to ultra-conservat i ve
gr o u p s , claim that only answerable com-
plaints are invited to Bamako and that most
m i n i s t e rial promises are not kept.This often
happens because of lack of money—Mali is
one of the wo r l d ’s poorest countri e s. For the
o p p o s i t io n , the EID is an expensive public
r e l ations ploy used to hide alleged gove rn-
mental corruption and attract outside approva l
to the gove rnment (foreign assistance accounts
for 20 per cent of Mali’s national bu d g e t . )
The letter from the 144 T i m buktu airp o rt
e m p l oyees was the second they’ve sent to the
EID with the same complaint.

Many individual promises go ignored,
often due to the lack of money in this,one
of the poorest countries in the wo r l d .As one
minister put it:“We are a very poor but a

have patience with us—that they put the
good of the country before the good of the
individual.” n
