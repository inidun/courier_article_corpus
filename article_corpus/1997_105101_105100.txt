bus mysterious words that often
appear in news reports are the
names of artificial satellites.
The satellite era began on 4
October 1957, when the Soviet
Union successfully launched Sput¬
nik ("fellow traveller" in Russian)
into orbit around the earth. An
observation tool weighing almost
84 kg, Sputnik circled the earth
for three months at altitudes rang¬
ing from 228 to 947 km.
Roistered by progress in infor¬
mation technology, satellite tech¬
nology has come a long way since
then. Today we rely heavily on
these eyes in the sky to tell us
about the environment and help us
to manage the earth's resources.
Eyes in the sky
Artificial satellites today observe
the atmosphere, the oceans, and
the earth's land surface from
space. They provide information
using two different techniques,
data collection and remote sens¬
ing. With the first technique, they
receive data from various points on
the earth's surface and then beam
it back to earth. With the second,
they use their instruments to
analyse information contained in
electromagnetic radiation emitted
by the earth.
The choice of orbit is extremely
important. A satellite in geosta¬
tionary orbit some 36,000 kilo¬
metres above the earth appears
immobile since it moves at the
same speed as the revolving globe.
Geostationary satellites continu¬
ously observe a wide area but are
hampered by their distance from
the earth. A satellite in polar orbit,
on the other hand, covers the
entire planet without remaining
permanently above a single region.
Geostationary satellites and
satellites in polar orbit do not have
the same uses, and their capaci¬
ties complement each other. Roth
kinds are used in meteorology, for
example, a field where satellites
have proven to be of vital impor¬
tance. Five geostationary satellites

enable weather watchers to keep a
constant eye on the earth's weather
system in toto, while polar orbital
satellites provide more precise
measurements at different points
on the earth's surface.
Satellites, whose weight ranges
from a few kg to several tons, are
launched by extremely powerful
rockets. The United States, Rus¬
sia, France, Japan, China, India
and Rrazil are among the countries
that possess such launchers, and in
some cases launch satellites for
other countries. Canada and the
Arab states, for example, have had
satellites launched by the United
States and France respectively.
Once in orbit, satellites record
images by means of still photogra¬
phy, TV cameras, scanners or
radar. Film from manned satellites
is returned to earth for process¬
ing. Unmanned satellites either
process the images themselves or
transmit them to terrestrial receiv¬
ing stations in different parts of
the world. Each image is ordered
in advance from the satellite by
computer and identified in detail.
This battery of observational
technology has great potential for
environmental monitoring. In July
1991, the European Space Agency
launched ERS-1 (an acronym for
European Remote-Sensing Satel¬
lite), Europe's first environmental
satellite, whose work was later car¬
ried on by its sister craft ERS-2.

Remote Sensing
Satellite (ERS-1),
Europe's first

satellite.
Radar sensors enable the satellites
to "see" at night and through
cloud cover. One system generates
100-km x 100-km scenes of regions
over which the satellite flies and
measures wind speed and direc¬
tion and wave energy. Another mea¬
sures wave height to within 2 cm.
A third system is an infra-red
detector that measures sea sur¬
face temperature to an accuracy of
0.3°C.
High resolution images
"Our only way to obtain an overall
vision of the state of ocean biology
at any moment is satellite obser¬
vation of the ocean's colours,"
explains John Withrow, a member
of the Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission (IOC). "Data
on the colour of the ocean will
enable us to monitor such impor¬
tant fields as biogeochemical
cycles, the direct effects of biology
on the physics of oceans, coastal
resources and sustainable fishing."
It is only by observing colour that
we can also study carbon dioxide
absorption by the oceans, a phe¬
nomenon which has repercussions
on the abundance of marine algae.
Remote sensing is an efficient
tool for monitoring ice, especially
in the Raltic Sea. In the northern
reaches of the Raltic, the ice sea¬
son lasts on average more than six
months of the year and obstructs
shipping. Since 1989, ice-break
ers of the Finnish Shipping Office
have been equipped with a work¬
station for processing images sent
by the NOAA and ERS satellites.
If the image arrives quickly and
has a resolution of at least 100
metres, the captain of the ice¬
breaker can choose his optimum
route and transmit to other ships
information that will help them
through the ice without any need
for his ship to intervene.
In July 1991, fin; raged through
some 140,000 hectares on Spain's
east coast. Using their high-reso¬
lution imaging systems and trans¬
mitting four times a day, the Tiros
and Landsat polar orbiting satel¬
lites monitored the advance of the
fire, identified at-risk zones and
assessed the damage. Even at night
they were able to warn of new out¬
breaks of fire and smoke, enabling
the fire services to use their
resources to maximum effect.
A map-making tool
Satellites can also help us to take
stock of the natural environment.
They have, for example, been used
to map old growth forests in Ore¬
gon and Washington State in the
United States which have suffered
from over-logging. They identified
three levels the oldest trees (400
years old), 160-year-old trees, and
a lower level, and used three para¬
meters: rate of coverage, diameter,
and structure and nature of species.

The American yew (Taxus bre-
vifolia) lives in the lowest level of
these forests. When taxol, an anti¬
cancer drug, was extracted from
its bark, large numbers of the trees
were felled. Later, a synthetic mol¬
ecule for the drug was created,
and logging was halted. If it had
continued, however, satellite map¬
ping would have helped mobilize
the authorities and improve forest
management. Another unexpected
beneficiary of satellite mapping is
the northern spotted owl (Strix
occidentalis), which lives only in
these old growth forests and would
disappear if too many of their trees
were felled. Its survival has
become a priority target of nature
conservation in the United States.
Rrazil and Thailand have high-
powered data-receiving stations
and use ERS, Landsat and Spot
satellites to monitor their plant
resources. In Amazonia, defor¬
estation is assessed every three
years by satellite and its conse¬
quences are measured regional
warming and declining rainfall.
Agriculture is one of Egypt's
main resources, and satellite data
are extremely valuable tools for
agricultural resource management

and forecasting. The Agricultural
Land Information System (ALIS) is
designed to measure and follow the
evolution over time of areas where
the main crops are grown, to con¬
trol urban sprawl in these areas
and to develop new areas. This pro¬
ject, devised by Spot Image, which
distributes imagery provided by
Spot remote-sensing satellites,
began in France, where twelve
Egyptian specialists were trained.
As a result of outside funding, the
specialists are now continuing their

work in Egypt with the most
advanced equipment.
Using maps made by this process
it has been possible to study 4 mil¬
lion hectares, to identify 6,240 plots
of land and obtain accurate statis¬
tics on Egypt's ten main crops. This
inventory of land use has also helped
to map urban development with a
view to preserving the agricultural
potential which is vitally important
to Egypt.
A non-stop
observation system
Will it be possible to increase and
improve the use of environmental
satellites? Manned flights bring
back plenty of experimental
results, and virtually the whole
planet reaps the benefits of
progress made in weather and com¬
munication satellites and is ready
to help fund them. But natural dis¬
asters continue to happen without
being predicted, and it is no longer
enough simply to note increasing
desert encroachment, soil erosion
and deforestation. Is the fate of the
earth too general and too long-term
a problem to motivate governments,
groups of nations and private com¬
panies to act?
André Lebeau, a former offi¬
cial with French and European
space programmes, believes that
if we are to fully understand the
global environment, we must devise
and implement a permanent sys¬
tem for observing the earth in
which satellite observations would
be supplemented by other
notably aerial observation at a
much lower cost. "The need for a
system of this kind," he notes, "is
not directly perceived either at
the individual or institutional level,
or even by nations. It only becomes
really obvious when we consider
the future of humanity as a
whole and since that is every¬
body's business, it tends to be
nobody's business." M
