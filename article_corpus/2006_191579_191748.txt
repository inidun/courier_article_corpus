Millions of young people dream of 
one day emulating their sporting 
heroes. And then we are shattered 
when we discover that the achieve-
ments of our idols, such as base-
ball player Jason Giambi or sprinter 
Justin Gatlin, were the product of 
doping.
Winning 
at any cost?
Winning at any cost may mean sur-
mounting almost unbeatable odds 
like Maria Mutola. It is also exempli-
fied by the Argentinean Club Atlé-
tico Defensores del Chaco who 
rose from the slums of the Buenos 
Aires suburbs to compete in the 
first street soccer World Cup, held 
in Germany this summer in parallel 
to the FIFA World Cup. 
But the need to win at any cost 
can also lead to doping. Taylor Hou-
ton turned to anabolic steroids be-
cause he saw his high school class-
mates using them and thought that 
performance enhancing drugs were 
the key to victory. 
wo children living on opposite sides 
of the globe faced obstacles in their 
personal quests to excel at sport. 
Growing up poor in the outskirts of 
Maputo (Mozambique), Maria Mu-
tola was told that she could not con-
tinue to play soccer because of her 
gender; in Houston, Texas (United 
States), Taylor Houton’s baseball 
coach told him that he wasn’t strong 
enough to play on his high school’s 
team. The two children reacted differ-
ently in the face of these challenges. 
Maria changed codes and went on 
to become an Olympic Gold Medal-
ist runner; Taylor turned to anabolic 
steroids to increase his muscle mass 
and died violently at 17 years of age. 
UNESCO supports physical edu-
cation and sport in educational set-
tings and also promotes the Interna-
tional Convention against Doping in 
Sport. This issue of the UNESCO 
Courier takes a closer look at sport 
and what it means to work towards a 
better sport.
Sport mirrors 
society
“We should see sport is a microcosm 
of society,” says Paul Marriott-Lloyd 
of the Unit for Physical Education 
and Sport in UNESCO. “Like in so-
ciety, good things happen and bad 
things happen in sport. The only dif-
ference is that every move is played 
out on our television screens or 
on the back pages of newspapers 
around the world.” 
We are fascinated by profession-
al sports and successful athletes. 
Entire nations sit glued to their 
television sets during the Olympic 
Games or a World Cup tournament. 
                         sport touches all parts of society in every country around the world. 
             We are all physically active at some level and sport contributes to a broad range of social 
       and development goals. however, sport is not without its problems as the scandals 
                           surrounding the 2006 tour de france demonstrated.
Winning at any cost?
Taylor Houton died at 17 after using 
anabolic steroids.

much at stake 
in the tour de France
189 riders from 21 teams 
competed for a total prize 
package of 3,200,000 euros 
for the 2006 Tour de France. 
This is divided up amongst 
various categories 
with the overall winner 
receiving 450,000 euros.

Elite athletes in a variety of sports 
fall victim to the same temptation. 
In today’s headlines, we are reading 
about the scandal surrounding 2006 
Tour de France Champion Floyd 
Landis who has since tested posi-
tive for elevated testosterone levels 
and Marion Jones whose A sample 
has allegedly tested positive for the 
blood booster EPO (erythropoie-
tin). In the 1970’s and 1980’s, East 
Germany ran a state-sponsored do- 
ping programme that involved an 
estimated 10,000 athletes. 
There are a number of reasons why 
athletes use performance enhancing 
drugs and methods. It can be con-
sidered a product of the competitive 
sporting environment and an erosion 
of sporting ethics. “There is a lot of 
money, ‘fame and fortune’, in high-level 
sport,” Paul Marriott-Lloyd explains. 
“And that shapes how some people 
approach the game. Unfortunately 
there can be a perverse incentive for 
people to cheat.”
