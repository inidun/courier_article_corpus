C h i n a ’s timid coming out
Psychiatrists no longer view homosexuality as a mental illness, while the
media is broaching the topic. But authorities prefer to keep the lid on a
subject that could spiral into a human rights debate
2 . PASSING RITES
“I
think of my homosexuality as a source of
c r e a t i v i t y,” says Cui Zi’en,with a cheeky
look in his eye.Few militant homosexuals
in China, such as this scriptwriter and
t e a c h e r,dare to go public.H o m o s e x u a l i t y
is not illegal, even though the law against “ s o r d i d ”
offences that bars sexual relations in public was long
used against homosexuals who met in parks.
The law was rescinded several years ago,but the
attitude of Chinese doctors is still ambiguous. S o c i a l
stability is cited as a reason for not treating sexuality
as a private matter. Homosexuality, with its power
to break up families and transmit A i d s, is therefore
seen as an illness.A handful of doctors, s o c i o l o g i s t s
and campaigners,h o w e v e r, are managing to drag the
debate onto more scientific territory.
Last A p r i l , the Chinese Psychiatrists’ A s s o c i a t i o n
removed homosexuality from its list of mental
i l l n e s s e s. “But it’s still seen as a psychological
d i s o r d e r,” says Cui Zi’en. “Psychiatrists have
r e c l a s s i fied it,which isn’t enough.” Some doctors,h e
s a y s, probably still want to “ c u r e ” h o m o s e x u a l s,
which only prolongs the distress of those who
“consider themselves abnormal.”

Liu Dalin, a well-known sexologist, s a y s
homosexuality can be seen as criminal, an illness or
normal.“China is still at the illness stage,” he says.
“People still regard it as a problem.”
Rejecting the pleasure principle
Public opinion is an obstacle to any change.
Attitudes have been shaped for centuries by
Confucian morality and then communist puritanism.
For decades, individual pleasure—dismissed as
“bourgeois”— was beyond the pale. “ You just
couldn’t talk about sexuality,” says sociologist Li
Yinhe, who specializes in sexual behaviour.
Since the 1980s,h o w e v e r, individual freedom has
e x p a n d e d , especially in the big cities, and the
Chinese are once again learning how to listen to
their feelings. “But sexuality is still regarded as
simply procreation,” says Ye Guangwei,a volunteer
at an advice centre for homosexuals in Beijing.
“The idea of pleasure is poorly regarded.” All the
less so when it concerns homosexual pleasure, he
c o n t i n u e s :“A man who isn’t masculine is disdained.
And for him to take on a female role during a
sexual act is unthinkable and a disgrace in people’s
eyes.”
In Confucian tradition,a man’s job is to start a
family in order to produce male heirs who will
ensure the continued worship of the ancestors. N o t
s u r p r i s i n g l y,a large number of Chinese homosexuals
still marry to save appearances and lead clandestine
sex lives.
In cities, tradition does not hold such weight,
partly because of the government policy of the
one-child family, according to Li Yi n h e. When a
couple has a daughter, the family lineage is broken,
and it becomes impossible to respect tradition.
F u r t h e r m o r e, greater professional mobility also
allows young people to escape the pressure of their
parents.
The “comrades,” as Chinese homosexuals call
each other, think a change in media attitudes could
alter public opinion.After he appeared in a televised
debate broadcast by a provincial station, Cui Zi’en
received calls from mothers who said they had been
amazed he did not seem to be perverted or
unbalanced.
In recent years, local media have touched on the
s u b j e c t , but only timidly for fear of igniting the
s t a t e ’s wrath.“ We ’re not really a danger in the eyes
of the government,” says Ye Guangwei, “but it
prefers to stay in line with the moral convictions of
the majority.” To support a sexual minority would
risk extending debate to the slippery slope of human
rights in general.
Respect begins at home
The media prefer to ignore homosexuality so as
not to offend the authorities. They in turn avoid
disturbing public opinion,keeping prejudices well-
entrenched through lack of information. To break
this vicious circle,“we have our part to play too,” h e
says. “We have to teach people to like their own
bodies and to respect them before they can be liked
and respected by others.”
Many would simply like to be able to live openly
as homosexuals. “In the We s t , i t ’s frowned on to
criticize homosexuals and even more to make them
feel different,” says Cui Zi’en.“I can understand a
heterosexual being startled at seeing a very
effeminate man. Chinese society is changing, but
t h e r e ’ll always be people who’ll feel disgust, like they
might jump if they saw a snake.We’re not going to
tell them they have to start liking snakes, are we?”
