Decoding
the message
of African
sculpture
by Ola Balogun
OLA BALOGUN is a young Nigerian film
director and writer who has been a Unesco
consultant on the training of film-makers.
He has directed a number of noted feature
films and documentaries, including Vivre
(1975) and Muzik Man (1976), and has
served on the jury of the Pan-African Film
Festival at Carthage (Tunisia). The author of
two plays. Shango and Le Roi-Éléphant
(published by P.-J. Oswald, Paris, 1968), he
has written several studies for Unesco,
including a chapter on Africa in The Education
of the Film-maker, an International View (co-
published with the American Film Institute,
Washington, D. C, 1975).
ALL cultures are made up of a
multiplicity of currents which
may sometimes even appear
antagonistic. Africa is no exception
to this general rule.
But although there is no single art
form narrowly identifiable as African
to the exclusion of all others, there
is a certain broad ensemble of styles
and forms, which together constitute
African art.
African art forms are seldom prac¬
tised for their entertainment value
alone. In masquerade performances,
the essential feature is the ritual
function of the performance, although
dancing and sometimes the mock
pursuit of spectators by the masque-
rader provide entertaining features.
Dancing itself is practised on the
occasion of specific festivities and
rituals, and only rarely as pure enter¬
tainment.
Perhaps the only major exception
to this rule is the art of the story¬
teller or that of the wandering mins¬
trel, whose purpose is to entertain an
audience in exchange for remunera¬
tion. Even in this case, the stories
or epic recitals often aim primarily to
provide moral lessons or useful
knowledge of the past.
The art forms commonly encoun¬
tered in African societies include
sculpture (in wood, stone, iron,
bronze, terra-cotta, etc.) architecture.
African art, whether sacred or
secular, is always the product of
refined and meticulous skills.
Household utensils and furniture
display the same dignity and
gracefulness as works of religious
art. The elegant neck-rest (right)
is supported by a couple facing
each other and joined in a chaste
and tender embrace. It is the
work of a master-craftsman of the
Luba people of southern Zaire, like
the fertility statuette (opposite
page) in which a male and female
figure present each other with a
baby girl. This sculpture is an
invocation of the "life force"
which increases the family.

music, dance, rituals incorporating
dramatic elements, and oral litera¬
ture. The range of artistic activity
covers a wider spectrum among Afri¬
can peoples than is generally as¬
sumed, and is much more complex
and diversified than ethnological
studies have generally indicated. By
looking at two examplesmasks
and wood carvingit should be
possible to throw some light on the
nature and meaning of African art.
Carving is one of the mainstays of
African art, and is the medium
through which African art has best
come to be known outside Africa.
The most striking category of wood
carving is that of carved masks de¬
signed for masquerade displays.
There has been much confusion
about such carvings, principally be¬
cause of attempts to define them
according to Western European
aesthetic criteria. . '
Such confusion is typified in the
belief that African art is "primitive".
The corollary to this belief is the
equally baseless assumption that
mankind has evolved through the
stage of "clumsy" art before finally
achieving the formal perfection of
Graeco-Latin art.
The fallacy of this line of reasoning
is obvious. In the first place aesthe¬
tic criteria do not necessarily involve
a direct imitation of natural forms.
Secondly, there is no justification,
other than an ethnocentric view of
the world, for assuming that the lack
of an aesthetic approach similar to
that which has developed in Western
Europe signifies an absence of formal
perfection. Aesthetic appreciation
of African art forms such as mask
carvings should be fundamentally
linked to an understanding of their
purpose. It is therefore necessary
to analyse the general background
and nature of African masquerades.
Masquerade performances are
generally part of ritual ceremonies
designed to invoke the gods or to
establish the communion of a commu¬
nity with them, as well as to remind
members of the community of their
relationship with non-human forces
in the universe.
The masquerade is therefore consi¬
dered as a material manifestation of
an intangible force, as a temporary
incarnation of the non-human. Such
a manifestation, however, requires
human participation in order to
become possible.
A human agent (often the masque-
rader, the mask-wearer) serves as a
vehicle for the manifestation. A sign
or a set of signs must be found to
distinguish this human agent from
other human beings and establish the
fact that for the duration of the rites
he has ceased to be a human being
and has become the embodiment of
the divinity or ancestor whose pre¬
sence is being invoked.
The most important and easily
recognizable signs lie in the realm
of costume. The costume suggests
the presence of the god and points
to a reality beyond the physical pre¬
sence of the human being who has
donned it. It is, above all, a sign, in
the same way as a few branches may
be used in theatre scenery to suggest
a forest. One of the most important
elements in this transformation is the
mask.
Once the fundamental role of the
mask (and of costume In general) in
suggesting and establishing the pre¬
sence of the supernatural is properly
understood, it becomes possible to
grasp the conceptual framework wi¬
thin which the carver works.
The Western European artists who
have been influenced by African art
apparently saw in the techniques of
the mask carvers only an attempt to
represent natural shapes in the
abstract form, and Cubism and other
movements pursued this approach to
an extreme degree.
This was, however, a mistaken
interpretation, based on ignorance of
the conceptual framework which
dictated the styles employed by Afri¬
can mask carvers. Even where an
external model exists, it is the hidden
essence of its form rather than its ex- i
ternal appearance that the carver I
13

L seeks to capture. The style of the
' mask carver is an approach imposed
by the system of beliefs and the
conceptual framework within which
he lives and works.
This means that there has always
been great scope for artistic freedom
and improvisation within the larger
framework of communal beliefs and
conventions. If the divinity whose
presence the mask will help to invoke
is a frightening one, the artist is not
required to make a faithful copy of
previous masks, but to convey the
idea of what a frightening presence
should look like and to suggest that
presence in his work.
Thus, he is often free to execute his
own idea of what a frightening pre¬
sence should look like, within the
framework of local artistic canons
and conventions.
African mask carvings reflect a
careful and studied mastery of cre¬
ative techniques on many levels.
Perhaps one of the most remarkable
aspects of this creative skill is the
ability to achieve astonishing simpli¬
fication of visual ideas originally
derived from natural forms.
In most mask carvings, it is as if
the carvers had sought to go beyond
the mere outward appearance of na¬
tural forms to grasp their essence,
going on from there to new creative
structures.
The Bambara headpieces from
Mali known as Tyi-wara, to take one
example, are inspired by the form and
grace of the antelope. But what
remains of the antelope as a visual
form is reduced to a suggestion of the
essential attributes of the animal,
basically its sleek lines and grace, em¬
bellished by decorative flourishes.
To look at such carvings is to be
carried beyond external form into the
being of a mythical animal whose
essence has been symbolized by the
form of the antelope.
The simplification of natural motifs
often leads the carver to develop a
geometric conception of his source of
inspiration. Thus eyes become pure
circles or squares, or simple slanted
lines which are then spatially balanced
against other features similarly con¬
ceived. The famous Basonge masks
from the Congo basin constitute a
remarkable example of these geo¬
metric forms.
Not only are the features them¬
selves cast on a geometrical pattern
of squares (for the eyes), but a collec¬
tion of curved lines running across
How the sky reached its limit
On her family farm in the Ivory Coast, a girl of the Senufo people
pounds millet into flour using a mortar and a long hardwood pestle,
familiar tools in rural Africa. According to a famous myth, the
pestle once changed the face of the earth. The myth says that
at first the sky was low down, but people became too familiar
with it and one day a woman poked it in the eye with a pestle. As
a result, the sky retreated in anger to the distance where it has
been ever since.

the whole surface in relief serves to
accentuate the whole.
In many Congolese and Gabonese
masks, the repetition of regular
curves in the lines of facial features
such as eyebrows, eyes and lips
creates a pattern of rhythms remi¬
niscent of musical rhythm.
Even more striking is the develop¬
ment of architectural patterns in
many mask carvings. Even when
the mask is made to be worn vertically
over the face, its surface is rarely flat.
It is in carving head-masks (worn
horizontally on the head) that the
fullest possible use is made of three-
dimensional space. Examples in¬
clude the Tyi-wara masks of the
Bambara people and certain Baoulé,
Senufo (Ivory Coast) and Ijaw (sou¬
thern Nigeria) headmasks. The for¬
mer represent buffalo spirits, the
latter water spirits.
During the dance, the mask-wearer
shows the mask to spectators from
different angles, creating a different
visual impact in each case. In effect,
the mask's frontal aspect is entirely
different from its "profile", and when
the masquerade dancer lowers his
head it is seen that the top of the
mask is also different.
The muzzle and teeth of the mythi¬
cal creature may be seen as the most
important part of the mask when it
is viewed from the front, while the
ears and the horns are the most strik¬
ing features from the side view. In
the top view of the mask, the teeth
and open muzzle disappear entirely,
so that the spectator sees only a
geometrical pattern built around the
features of the face.
Generally, once the essential lines
of the mask have been carved, it is
embellished by various decorative
designs, ranging from simple and
subtle touches to highly ornate
motifs. Some recent versions even
comprise representations of cars and
aeroplanes !
For sheer plastic audacity, some
African masks are hardly to be sur¬
passed. In one Bacham mask from
Cameroon, which is based on a
highly stylized representation of the
human face, the cheek bones have
become protruding conical structures
with a gently rounded top on which
the eyes rest in a horizontal plane.
The sockets beneath the eyebrows
have become elongated vertical sur¬
faces towering above the eyes, rather
like the upper lid of an oyster shell
within which each eye reposes.
This remarkably audacious treat¬
ment of surfaces (it is styles of this
type that directly inspired the Cubist
movement) would be inconceivable in
the absence of very advanced plastic
concepts.
In a sense, the mask becomes a
frozen moment in eternity, yet the
movements of the masquerade lend
it a new life and plunge it into the
rhythms of human existence.
As the mask-wearer dances, that
frozen moment of eternity grasped by
the carver's art is set in motion to.
the rhythm of the music, stimulating
the emotions of the spectators both
by the plastic rhythm of the carving
and by the larger rhythm of the dance.
All this is added to the emotional
impact caused by the social and cultu¬
ral significance of the dance ritual.
By a strange paradox, it is precisely
because the purpose to be served by
the mask must take precedence over
his private vision that the artist
achieves total liberty in his treatment
of form. The aim of his work is
most often to suggest immaterial
forms, rather than to copy nature
directly.
Most African sculptures, like the
mask carvings, are executed in wood.
"Power objects" or symbolical substi¬
tutes for ancestors and gods, they
are primarily aimed at fulfilling a
function.
The sculptor is primarily concerned
with adapting the style of the object
to its function, while complying with
already existing plastic traditions.
He hardly ever attempts to reproduce
natural traits or to base his sculpture
on realism. It is therefore rare to
find life-sized statues or even small
statues based on real-life proportions.
It is precisely because the African
sculptor has not conceived his work
exclusively in terms of creation of
forms pleasing to the eye that such
sculptures achieve startling visual
effects.

mais are generally not conceived as
visual representations of the original
object but as substitutes, for it or a
magic evocation of it. Hence the
accent is laid on symbolization of
essential traits, rather than on factual
representation as such.
In anthropomorphic figures, the
head is often on a larger scale in
proportion to the rest of the body. A
frequent device where two figures of
unequal social importance feature
in a sculpture is to reflect the diffe¬
rence in social status through a sharp
variation in proportion.
There is also scarcely ever an
attempt to show a figure in movement
or involved in some form of physical
activity such as might distract from
the balance of the sculpture.
Among the best-known categories
of African sculptures are commemo¬
rative statuettes of ancestor-figures
and ritual statuettes of gods that are
placed in religious shrines to repre¬
sent divinities or devotees of the gods
to whom such shrines are dedicated.
Such sculptures are above all
"power objects", and their efficacity
in the religious sphere is as much
dependent on the sculptor's skill as on
the rites associated with them. A
clumsily executed work or one that
falls too far outside the traditional
canons of style peculiar to the tribal
or regional zone within which it is
created would not be acceptable.
The characteristics of African sculp¬
ture are therefore closely dependent
on the entire social and cultural
context in which it is created. For
this reason attempts to encourage
the production of such works of art on
a commercial basis, in an attempt to
preserve the mere external characte¬
ristics of their style, are inevitably
doomed to failure.
It is important to understand that
the sculptor does not merely copy
the details of traditional patterns of
sculpture but uses the accepted tra¬
ditional model as an inspirational
guide from which his own creative
skill blossoms.
Mechanical copies for the purely
commercial purpose of satisfying tou¬
rist demand remain lifeless and artis¬
tically sterile, while work that has its
roots in a respect for social and cul¬
tural continuity is as vigorous from
the point of view of artistic execution
as works of art of the past.
Such sculpture is the collective
work of a civilization, and the role
of the artist is that of a medium
charged with expressing collective
beliefs and vision in material terms.
The form of the man-made object
becomes a substitute for the super¬
natural or human because it captures
and imprisons a part of the original
through symbolical identity.
Ultimately, art is a prolongation of
life because it is imbued with a life
of its own.
