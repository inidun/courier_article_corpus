issue is still at the core of the questions raised
about genetic engi n e e ri n g, either by tradition,
culture or duty.”
Should a person have recourse to prenat a l
screening and consider having an abortion if a
s e rious genetic defect is discovered? Should
research on embryo s , gene therapy and cloning
be allowed?
All the “religions of the Book”(Christianity,
Judaism and Islam) believe that the answe rs to
these questions largely depend on the status of
the embryo.The frontier between “ g o o d ” a n d
“ b a d ” genetic engi n e e ring depends on whether
or not the embryo is considered to be “ a n i m at e ” .
An “opposition front”
“If the embryo has a soul,then it is endowed
with a human as well as a biological life and any
attack on its integrity is seen as a cri m e ,” s ay s
French geneticist René Frydman.“If it is inani-
m at e , the prohibition remains—God-gi ven life
should be respected—but the offence is less
serious.”
The Catholic Church is in many respects a
special case. For a start , it has a single “ m a gi s-
t e ri u m ”or teaching authori t y,whereas other reli-
gions have a more familiar approach, such as dis-
cussions with a rabbi (Je w s ) , p riest (Ort h o d ox
C h ristians) or master (Buddhists). Other reli-
gions also have various branches (reformed and
o rt h o d ox Je w s ,m a ny broad streams of Buddhism)
or schools of jurisprudence (Malikite,Hanafite,
Shafi’ite and Hanbalite among Sunni Muslims,
for example). Most important of all, while all the
major religions generally believe human life and
dignity should be respected, the Church of Rome
is the only religion that considers the embryo “ a s
a human being from the moment of conception”,
and it sticks firmly to this doctrine.
Pope John Paul II has repeated it several times,
notably in the encyclicals Ve ri t atis Splendor ( 1 9 9 3 )
and E va n gelium V i t a e ( 1 9 9 5 ) .These have resul-
ted in a number of prohibitions: “ n o ” to prena-
tal screening if it it is done with the thought of a
possible abortion and “ n o ” to most research and
therapy on embryo s.The Vatican is also against
both reproductive and therapeutic cloning on the
grounds that it violates the “unified totality” o f

they argue about the soul of the human
e m b ryo in a debate that concerns creatures of
flesh and blood and spills way beyond Chri s-
tianity.

to the bioethical questions posed by genetic technologies.

the human person and the sacred link betwe e n
sexuality and procreation.
The positions of Ort h o d ox Christians are ve ry
close to those of the Vat i c a n . But the “ o p p o s i t i o n
front”to genetic technologies is limited to these
t wo gr o u p s. For Islam and Judaism, the impor-
tant principles are the moment when the embryo
acquires a life of its own and respect for descen-
d a n c e .The Koran says in Surat 23: “And cer-
tainly We created man of an extract of clay,T h e n
We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place,
Then we made the seed a clot, then we made the
clot a lump of fle s h , then We made (in) the lump
of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with
fle s h , then We caused it to gr ow into another crea-
tion.”
But some Muslims believe it is 40 days befo-
re the soul (ru h) enters the embryo, while others
b e l i e ve it is 120. At the same time, while prena-
tal screening is accepted,there is argument over
a b o rt i o n . H’mida Ennaifer, of the Higher Insti-
tute of Theology in Tu n i s ,s ays “Islamic jurists all
condemn abortion after the foetus has receive d
the breath of life. Some Malekites condemn it
e ven when the child is less than 40 days old while
other schools of thought allow it during the first
four months of pregnancy.”
Islam also allows gene therapy on the human
b o d y, but in general it proscribes the modifica-
tion of germ-cells and bans anything which denies
the notion of divine creat i o n , s t a rting with clo-
n i n g . H owe ve r , a minority of jurists regard clo-
ning as sometimes preferable to “genetic adulte-
ry ” because it respects the line of descent by
avoiding a situation where a sterile couple uses
s p e rm or eggs from a donor in art i ficial insemi-
nation.
Jews cite the Bible and the Ta l m u d .When the
Talmud reports that during the miraculous cros-
sing of the Red Sea by the Israelites (Exodus,
chapter 15), e ven the unborn children in their
mothers’ wombs praised God,it comments that
“if they could praise the glory of God, it means
they have a soul and a conscience.”This comes
about after the 40th day, the Talmud says. Until
then,the embryo is “only water”.So to obey the
halakha ( Jewish Law ) , it is preferable to carry out
p r e n atal screening before the 40th day.After that ,
a b o rtion is not allowed unless the mother’s life is
in danger. In practice, it all depends on what the
rabbis say.Some hold that if the mother has a ner-
vous breakdown when she learns she is carrying
a child with an incurable condition, a b o rtion is
p e rm i s s i b l e , e ven after the 40-day limit. O t h e r
rabbis are a lot stricter.
Jews allow experiments with embryo s , e s p e-
cially if they have no chance of surv i v i n g .J u d a i s m
also does not rule out cloning, s ays French theo-

l o gian and jurist Raphaël Braï. “If cloning is done
for therapeutic reasons, the matter has to be dis-
cussed with other people. S e veral religious notions
clash at this point. For example, the oneness of
the human person and the duty to heal oneself.”
But cloning for reproductive reasons is not allo-
wed,with few exceptions.
Protestant Christians are generally even more
open to advances in genetics.They stress free will
and regard each case on its meri t s ,l e aving a deci-
sion to the couple involved.“Some allow prena-
tal screening followed by an abortion if the wo m a n
so decides,” s ays Carlos de Sola, head of the bioe-
thics unit of the Council of Europe, which has
a rranged discussions between religious autho-
ri t i e s. “Some people even endorse choosing the
sex of a future child through sperm selection,
so as to create a family containing both boys and
gi r l s.” Protestants approve of research using
embryos as long as it is strictly supervised.They
do not rule out cloning either, though they reject
cloning for profit or for eugenic reasons.
Buddhists are even less dogmatic because they
b e l i e ve all truth is relat i ve . A French expert in
B u d d h i s m , Raphaël Liogi e r , notes that “the only

ethical limit is sufferi n g, for Buddha is pri m a rily a
h e a l e r.”The Dalai Lama, leader of T i b e t ’s Buddhists,
s ays what mainly has to be taken into account are
“the good effects and bad effects of genetic engi-
neering.” He agrees that it can be used to “improve
the human body—the brain,for example.”
“The body is only a vehicle for karma [the ethi-
cal consequences of a pers o n ’s actions that deter-
mine their destiny in their next incarn at i o n ] ,” s ay s
Liogier. “If the body has been genetically altered or
c l o n e d ,i t ’s really not ve ry import a n t .A b o rtion howe-
ver is frowned on because it damages karma.”
But again, e ve rything is relat i ve and the main
c o n c e rn is to avoid pain.The Dalai Lama says “ a b o r-
tion is allowed when a pregnant woman might die
if she gave birth or bear a severely handicapped child.”
The range of answe rs religions gi ve to bioethi-
cal questions is ve ry va ried and constantly changi n g,
except for the ri gid doctrine of the Vatican and the
i n flexibility of fundamentalists in all religi o n s. Fa c e d
with problems which go to the ori gin and meaning
of life itself, s ays Fry d m a n ,“ r e l i gious opinions are
probably a big help because they recall humanity’s
root values without trying to impose them and are a
forum for discussion,not a body of dogma.” n
