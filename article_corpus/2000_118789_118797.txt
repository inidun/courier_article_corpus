‘It ’s only midday and I’ve already sent 10 e-mails

the country ’s most active group dealing with aban-
doned children.

t u rn out an astonishing range of written mat e rial for
the association’s 6,000 members scattered all over
the world. Magazines, annual reports, studies on
homeless children and gypsy children, h a n d b o o k s ,
l e a fle t s ,e ven stickers — a nything to get the message
across.
“There’s all this,” says a slightly out-of-breath
Suciu, carrying an impressive pile of documents.
“The circulation figures aren’t amazing—they’r e
usually between 500 and 4,000 copies—but we
print everything ourselves.”


In the year after the fall of President Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989,the number of periodicals published in Romania
increased tenfold. Romania also opened up to foreign publications.

Among the quarterly magazines the associat i o n
puts out, I n fo c e n t deals with helping homeless chil-
dren, “Info Save the Children” presents the asso-
ciation’s projects, and “SOS Street Children”car-
ries news about the 700 or so children who roam
the streets of Bucharest.They all contain features,
i n t e rv i e w s , in-depth reports and practical inform a-
tion—just like any self-respecting magazine.
“These publications have boosted the associa-
t i o n ’s standing,” s ays Suciu. “The doors of institu-
tions are opening more readily to us now and some
of our experimental programmes have been incor-
p o r ated in the policies of gove rnment bodies.”T h e
association’s database of very detailed statistics on
abandoned children is a real goldmine for institu-
tions involved in the field.This shows the impact
these energetic young people have had on Romania’s
political and social life.
Has new inform ation technology expanded
freedom of expression? “ I t ’s done more than that ,”
says Suciu.“It’s our guarantee of freedom.”
Romanians have learned to turn IT to their
best adva n t a g e . Largely due to new technology,
the fortunes of the written press soared after the fa l l
of President Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989.“When he
was in power, there were a total of 400 magazines
and newspapers in the country,” s ays sociologist A l i n
Te o d o r e s c u . “I was amazed to see that figure
increase tenfold in less than a year.”
In 1990,the unchecked expansion of the press
exceeded all expectations and became a honey-pot
for local inve s t o rs looking for quick profit s. T h e
daily paper A d e va ru l ( “ Truth”) was printing 1.8 mil-
lion copies, România Libera (“Free Romania”) 1.5
million,and the weeklies sometimes topped a mil-
lion copies.These were huge figures for a country
of 23 million people.
“The media has been the biggest laboratory of
private enterprise in Romania,” says Teodorescu.
“Including adve rtising reve n u e , it accounts today for
2.5 per cent of GDP. If the whole economy was like
t h at , our national income would be higher than
that of Greece.”
The figures speak for themselve s. In 1989, t h e r e
were only 2,500 people working in the media.To d ay
there are 12,500. About 3,000 modern pri n t i n g
works have replaced old ones, some of which dat e d
back to 1894.The local capital the media at t r a c t e d
has been reinvested in computerizing editori a l
offices.
At the start of the 1990s, paper and powe r
supply were still gove rn m e n t - s u b s i d i z e d , w h i c h
made production costs low and newspapers very
cheap for the public. But low prices were not the
only factor in boosting readership. After nearly 40
ye a rs of silence under the Ceausescu regi m e ,R o m a-
nians were hungry for inform ation and any pri n t e d
material interested them. Social and political life
became an endless source of hot news, and most
intellectuals abandoned their field and turned to the
p r e s s , which became a kind of mirage of demo-
cracy.
Aware that people also needed to be entert a i-
ned after being numbed by long ye a rs of bori n g
l a n g u a g e ,m a ny new papers—big and small, n at i o-
nal and local—were unashamedly lightwe i g h t .T h e

gar and sometimes violent and insulting, t u rn e d
the press into a bat t l e field between the reform e rs
and those who looked back nostalgically to the
p a s t .
Competition from TV
Things began to change in 1992. Production
costs went up, people’s incomes fell and political
c o n t r ove rsy lowered the tone.The audiovisual sector
was also rapidly taking off and making Romania into
the eastern European leader in the field with, t o d ay,
48 television channels (40 of them local) and 250
radio stations (all but five of them private). As a
result,circulation fell dramatically and the written
press had to rethink its strat e g y. It has since become
more professional, with improved content and pre-
s e n t at i o n . It has mainly opted for news and left the
job of entertainment to television.
“Competition from television was a shock for the
p r e s s ,” s ays Te o d o r e s c u , “especially when TV made
off with 61 per cent of advertising revenues.Today
they’re quits, each of them drawing 50 per cent.
Income from adve rtising has actually risen by about
a fifth every year and is a real powerhouse for the
media.
Freedom of expression, the market economy
and new technology are the mainsprings of this
extraordinary expansion of the press in Romania,

magazines and newspapers in the

which now has more than 800 publications.They
include about 100 dailies, 200 weeklies and 250
monthlies. Half of the total are local (two-thirds
in the case of the dailies). The media run by
voluntary organizations are also flourishing. The
success story of “Save the Children” is by no
means unique in post-communist Romania,
where thousands of active community groups are
the flesh and bones of the new civil society.
Despite the country’s current material shortages,
most of them have computers and print their own
material.This is an astonishing achievement in a
c o u n t ry where, a decade ago, most people’s
dream was to buy a typewriter.
This optimism has infected everyone,even the

budding journalists are already learning how to
express ideas and share opinions—to communi-
cate freely, in fact.This is something their parents’
generation had very little opportunity to do. ■
