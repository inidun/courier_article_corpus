HAVANA CONFERENCE RESOLUTIONS REFLECT
REGIONAL SUPPORT FOR UNESCO'S PROGRAMME
REPORTING on the work of the First Regional Conference of National
Commissions of the Western Hemisphere, to Unesco's Executive
Board, last m th, M. Jaim  Torres B det, the Director-General,
stated :
"The Conference might have been no more than a meeting for
information and study purposes ; even as such it was indispensable, as was
shown by the discussions. But, whether it was a question of fundamental educ-
ation... of teaching about the United Nations and the Declaration of Human
Tights, of the role of the university on the American continent, or of the develop-
ment of exchanges of persons, the Conference, both in its advice to the Secretariat
and in its recommendations to the governments concerned, showed its keen
desire for more regional co-operation within the Organization".
M. Torres Bodet added :.. The fact that, in the case of at least half
the delegations, those who voted for these resolutions were the persons directly
responsible for action, gives me considerable hope that these intentions will
be translated into fact in the near future".
The desire of National Commissions in the Western Hemisphere to
contribute actively to Unesco's programme is reflected in the texts of
conference resolutions relating to four important aspects of Unesco's
work, which are published on this page.
Assembly of the United Nations on
10 December 1948.
(b) That, to this end, the National
Commissions of every Member
State, in agreement with the
Secretariat of Unesco in Paris,
promote the establishment of
educational curricula on this
subject on the following basis :
(i) The systematic development
of theoretical and practical
teaching about human rights,
from elementary classes in
primary schools up to the
advanced (university and
technological) level, including
an examination of the meas-
ures designed to ensure those
rights and guarantees, and an
estimate of their effectiveness
in everyday life ;
(ii) The attaching of greater im-
portance to a knowledge of the
bases of each human right
studied than to the actual
means whereby the right is
given legal effect.
(iii) The carrying out of a national
and international campaign of
civic education, in which
teaching in the schools, among
the public as a whole, and
in non-scholastic institutions
shall be included, with a view
to preparing all people for the
exercise of the rights and the
fulfilment of the obligations
laid down in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
of 10 December 1948.
(iv) The special emphasizing of
the fact that the rights of the
individual imply and define
,'obligations on his part as
regards co-operation, living inSociety, responsibility and
maximum respect, for the
dignity of other men...
(c) That, in those countries which
have not yet inaugurated official
curricula for teaching about hu-
man rights, the curricula referred
to in paragraph (b) be placed at
the disposal of the governments
concerned by 1 April 1951 at the
latest.

private institutions, women's
organizations, labour and

educational, scientific or cul-

cultural organizations, so. that
the general public may be
more closely associated with
the implementation of Unes-

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION
The First Regional Conference of
National Commissions of the Western
Hemisphere considers that the train-
ing of teachers and the production of
teaching materials are of the greatest

recommendations concerning the
better and more effective co-operation
of the National Commissions, and
concerning the Regional Centre to be
established at Patzcuaro under the
auspices of Unesco :
(a) The greatest possible number of
fellowships should be obtained for
each country.
(b) The number of fellowships should
be established in accordance with
the cultural needs and the geogra-
phical situation of each country...
