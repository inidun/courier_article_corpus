The floods that ravaged the Chang
Jiang (Ya n g t z e - K i a n g, literally the
“Long River”) basin this year were the
most serious since 1954, and flooding in
n o rtheast China was the wo rst in recorded
h i s t o ry.
H owe ve r , compared to the situation in
1 9 5 4 , the volume of water in this ye a r ’s
Yangtze flooding “ was not ve ry gr e at ” ,
s ays Lu Qinkan, a former official in
C h i n a ’s Ministry of Water Resources who
has been monitoring the ri ver since the
1 9 4 0 s. And yet the damage is more
s e ri o u s. A t m o s p h e ric physicist Ta o
S h i ya n , a member of the Chinese
A c a d e my of Sciences, concludes that
u n favourable we ather conditions “ we r e
not fully responsible” for a disaster which,
according to official sources, c l a i m e d
more than 3,000 lives between June and
August this ye a r , affected 223 million
p e rsons and almost a quarter of the
c o u n t ry ’s arable land, d e s t r oyed nearly
five million dwe l l i n g s , and caused damage
costing 166 billion yuan (around $21
b i l l i o n ) .
A hefty price tag
for neglect
How could such catastrophic flooding
have occurred? Lu attributes the problem
to the ri ve r ’s inability to release its
flo o d water efficiently. “The key factor in
controlling the Ya n g t z e ’s floods is ove r a l l
planning for storage and above all for
discharge of flo o d wat e rs ,” he say s. “ L a i d
d own in the 1950s, it remains a good
p rinciple today. U n f o rt u n ately the balance
has always been skewed in favour of storage
behind dams.” Now many sections of the
dikes and embankments which total 3,570
km in length along the lower and middle
reaches of the Yangtze and “are essential to
enchance the river’s capacity to discharge
flo o d wat e r ” are badly in need of repair.T h i s
s u m m e r , s e e p a g e , c r a c k s , and collapses
occurred at thousands of points, showing
that the dikes were weak.
G i ven the length and width of the
Ya n g t z e , Lu explains, if the height of the
dikes was raised by an average of one metre,



The river’s
Heavy rainfall led to this year’s flooding in
China, but years of human error turned it into
a national catastrophe
an additional 7,500 cubic metres of water
could be discharged per second (20 billion
cubic metres per month). However, a ten-
year plan drawn up in 1980 to heighten and
reinforce the Ya n g t z e ’s dikes has never been
fully carried out, Lu adds. If it had, “ t h i s
ye a r ’s disaster would have been
considerably alleviated.”
The water authorities explain that the
delay is due to shortage of funds.Whereas
4.8 billion yuan ($1.6 billion at the then
rate) were needed to finance 34 projects in
1 9 8 0 , only 399 million yuan had been
i nvested by 1987, and only 12 projects had
been launched. One exception is Jiangxi
p r ov i n c e , the final stage of the ri ve r ’s cours e
before it enters the East China Sea.
A u t h o rities there have spent around 7
billion yuan on flood defence work since
the early 1990s,about one seventh of it on
dikes along the Yangtze.
But the price of neglect elsewhere has
been high. Damage caused by Ya n g t z e
flooding in 1995, 1996 and this year has
cost at least 200 billion yuan ($25 billion).
This sum represents nearly 40 times the
budget for the 1980 plan and amounts to
two-thirds of the total investment needed
for the controve rsial Three Gorges Dam
p r o j e c t . M a ny engi n e e rs believe that this
d a m , when completed, could help tame the
Yangtze flo o d s , but others , including Lu,
are sceptical. As an adviser to the expert
panel on flood control during the feasibility
study carried out in the 1980s, he maintains
that the dam’s flood control capacity “will
only be limited”.
L o c ated near Y i c h a n g, where the
Yangtze emerges from narr ow gorges
before entering its flatter middle reaches,
the dam may help to control upstream
flo o d s. But this ye a r ’s deadly floods we r e
d ow n s t r e a m ,p a rticularly in Jiangxi, H u n a n
and Hubei provinces.
With a total storage capacity of 39.3
billion cubic metres, the Three Gorges
R e s e rvoir will have a flood control capacity
of 22.2 billion cubic metres, Lu say s , a
figure “ t h at is far exceeded by the ri ve r ’s
gross flood vo l u m e .” He maintains that the
Three Gorges Dam attracts massive 
i nvestment at the expense of basic local
flood defence wo r k . Lu Ya o ru , a

Hundreds of
lost lakes
In fa c t , s ays Yu Xiaogan, a senior
geographer with the Chinese Academy of
S c i e n c e s , the ri ver bed in a number of
stretches has already risen by 5 to 14 metres
a b ove surrounding field levels as a result of
s e d i m e n t at i o n . “In those sections the
Yangtze has already become a hangi n g
ri ve r ,” he say s. “And that is ve ry
dangerous.”
He believes that misuse of ri ve rside land
and adjoining lakes have also aggr avat e d
the problem. As a result of populat i o n
p r e s s u r e , the surface areas of Dongting and
Boyang lakes, two of the major detention
basins for Yangtze flo o d s , h ave shrunk by
46 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in
the past forty years.Their storage capacity
has decreased from more than 30 billion to
around 17 billion cubic metres. H u b e i ,
once known as “the province of a thousand
lakes”, had 1,066 lakes in the late 1950s.
N ow there are only 182. C o n s e q u e n t l y,
floodwaters that might have been stored in
lakes are now inundating cities,towns and
fields that occupy dried out land.Whereas
the region had 100,000 inhabitants in
More than 200 million Chinese were affected by this year’s floods.
1 9 5 4 , 20,000 of whom had to move out
when danger threat e n e d , t o d ay there are
half a million, 330,000 of whom have to be
removed when the waters rise.
D e f o r e s t ation and land erosion in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze have also
a g gr avated the flo o d s. B e t ween 1977 and
1 9 9 7 , according to the Nat i o n a l
E nvironmental Protection A g e n cy, 1 4
million cubic metres of wood we r e
d e s t r oyed annually in southwest China.
B e t ween 1957 and 1997, the area scarr e d
by soil erosion in the Yangtze basin
expanded from 363,800 to 569,700 square
k i l o m e t r e s , or from 20.2 per cent to 31.5
per cent of the basin’s area. “ Falling on
thick forest, 50 mm of rainfall wo n ’t have
a ny bad effect because all of it is absorbed,”
s ays Jin Jianming, an adviser to the
N ational Environmental Protection
A g e n cy. “But on exposed gr o u n d , just 30
mm of rainfall will run off and cause
flo o d s.”
“ N at u r e ’s revenge on China’s neglect
of ecology over the years”, is Yu Xiaogan’s
verdict on this ye a r ’s flo o d s. “ We used to
consider ourselves ‘masters of nature’and
t ried to conquer it,” s ays Liu Shukun, a
hy d r o l o gist with the Ministry of Wat e r
Resources.“Now we must learn to respect
nature like a good host.” n
