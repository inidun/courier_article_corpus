r
in southern France
by François Bordry
In October 1666 King Louis
XIV of France authorized
Pierre Paul de Riquet (1604-1 680) to I
start work on what was to become I
one of the seventeenth century's I
most ambitious civil engineering I
projects, the Canal du Midi.
Built only a few decades after I
the Briare Canal (1642), on which I
the technology of locks and the use I
of reaches of water at high altitude I
had been perfected, the Canal du I
Midi was intended to join the I
Atlantic Ocean with the Méditer- I
ranean, to "improve the prosperity I
of trade by avoiding the Straits of I
Gibraltar, pirates and the Spanish I
king's fleet", and to give "more con- I
siderable advantages to the provinces I
of Languedoc and Guyenne". The I
canal is sometimes called the I
Languedoc Canal or the Canal of I
the Two Seas.
The canal, which stretches 240 I
kilometres between Toulouse and I
the Etang de Thau, took 12,000 I
labourers, including 600 women, I
fifteen years to build and incorpo- I
rates feats of engineering that were I
technologically ahead of their time. I
Among the most remarkable of I
them are:
The Saint-Ferréol Dam in the I
Montagne Noire (Black Mountain) I
massif. This dam, the biggest of its I
time (780 metres long at the top and I
140 at the base), provides all the I
canal's water.
The number of locks, 63 in all. At I
Fonserannes an eight-lock staircase I
takes a stretch of the canal less than
Malpas tunnel. 173 metres long, it is the
-4 world's first navigable canal tunnel.

280 metres long over a difference in
level of 21.5 metres. Riquet dedi¬
cated this extraordinary staircase of
water to his birthplace, the city of
Béziers.
The Repudre Aqueduct was the



first canal bridge built in France and
is now the world's oldest. It was
greatly admired by Vauban, Louis
XIV's great engineer, who used it as
the basis for other aqueducts on the
canal, most of which are still stand¬
ing today.

T
world's first navigable underground
stretch of canal. The 173-metre-long
tunnel was built on a site at the foot
of the hill where the Roman
oppidum of Ensérune once stood.
Riquet's genius lay in finding
water resources for the canal. Work¬
ing with a team of hydraulic spe¬
cialists, he explored the Montagne
Noire massif, a region he knew well,
and dug a 70-kilometre network of
channels to drain the waters of small
tributaries and bring the waters of
the Montagne Noire from the
Narouze Pass, the canal's highest
point (altitude 194 metres), to the
watershed between the Atlantic and
the Mediterranean.
Pierre Paul de Riquet died on
1 October 1680, before the work
was completed. His son Mathias
ordered the first navigation trials
on 15 May 1681. For more than
two centuries the canal fulfilled
expectations and brought prosper¬
ity to the regions through which
it passed. Both goods and passen¬
gers were transported along it.
Horse-drawn barges, small boats
and lighters carrying wine plied
between banks that bustled with
the non-stop activity of lock-
keepers, drivers, grooms, bargees,
travelling salesmen and merchants.
Today the Canal du Midi no
longer carries goods, but it has
taken a new lease on life with the
development of waterway tourism.
It is used by thousands of amateur
sailors who discover a marvel of
technological ingenuity and archi¬
tectural elegance which blends har¬
moniously with the countryside as
they drift down its winding, shady
course. It was added to the World
Heritage List on 7 December 1996.
