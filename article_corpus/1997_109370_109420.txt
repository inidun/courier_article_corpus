BY GEORGES ZOUAIN The criteria written into the World Heritage
Convention contain some ambiguities
The implementation of the World Her¬
itage Convention is based on the def¬
inition of the cultural and natural her¬
itage enshrined in Article 1 of the
Convention. This definition is amplified by
the criteria set forth in a booklet entitled
"Operational Guidelines for the Implemen¬
tation of the World Heritage Convention".
To some extent the indivisibility of nature
makes it easy to choose "natural" sites. "Cul¬
tural" sites are another matter. The Convention
is open to all the world's cultures and civi¬
lizations, and this allows for considerable lat¬
itude in the interpretation of the definition
and the criteria.
According to the Convention, "the follow¬
ing shall be considered as 'cultural heritage':
<*" monuments: architectural works, works
of monumental sculpture and painting, ele¬
ments or structures of an archaeological nature,
inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations
of features, which are of outstanding univer¬
sal value from the point of view of history, art
or science;
«" groups of buildings: groups of separate or
connected buildings which, because of their
architecture, their homogeneity or their place
in the landscape, are of outstanding universal
value from the point of view of history, art or
science;
*" sites: works of man or the combined
works of nature and of man, and areas includ¬
ing archaeological sites which are of out¬
standing universal value from the historical,
aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological
points of view."
The Convention thus takes into consider¬
ation a wide range of possible cases, monu¬
mental and otherwise, but when it comes
down to it, "monumentalism" and "aesthet¬
ics " often take precedence over the significance
of a given site. As one ethnologist has written,
28

"What justification is there for allowing aes¬
thetic and museological criteria, which are
always extraneous, to take precedence over the
obvious fact, which can furthermore be veri¬
fied by looking at the way local societies func¬
tion on an everyday basis, that a 'nasty' pile of
mud coated with dried blood, sticky feathers
and broken eggshells often constitutes a
'fetish' more powerful and doubtless no less
rich in spiritual significance than a superb
statue which we regard as 'artistic'?" For
whom do we make listings and what criteria
do we use?

The ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani
(left) and Songo Mnara
(United Republic of Tanzania)
were added to the World
Heritage List as a cultural site
in 1981. The merchants of
Kilwa controlled much Indian
Ocean trade from the 13th to
the 16th centuries.
The Maya ceremonial centre of
Bonampak (600-950 A.D.) in
Mexico's Chiapas State, is
famed for its murals (detail,
right), which vividly depict the
life of a small Maya
community in the 8th century.
An answer to these questions emerges from
a statistical reading of requests for inscription
on the World Heritage List, and subsequent
acceptances and rejections. Rather than
strengthening the universality and unity of
the world, the current trend tends to mag¬
nify a certain division between countries. There
are those which can claim to contribute to
universality and the number of their sites
included on the List proves it (see Table 1).

The old walled city of Shibam
(Yemen), largely built in the
16th century, was added to the
World Heritage List in 1982. Its
tower-like buildings have
earned it the nickname of "the
Manhattan of the desert".
Others have only a single site on the List, or
none at all. There are also countries which are
not Parties to the Convention.
Is this breakdown accidental or does it arise
from subtle forms of discrimination? Since
1978, the first year when listings were made,
there has been a striking preponderance of sites
from countries of the so-called "North". This
The church of St. Basil the
Blessed, below, is one of the
fi nest examples of Russian
Orthodox architecture. It was
built between 1555 and 1560
at the foot of the Kremlin in
Moscow (Russian Federation)
by the Russian architects
Barma and Postnik. The
Kremlin and Red Square,
Moscow, were added to the
World Heritage List as a
cultural site in 1990.
preponderance, which diminished in relative
terms between 1984 and 1989, has again been
increasing since 1990. Since 1992, the increase in
listed European sites has continued, and has'
actually become more noticeable because of a
slowdown in listing for the other regions.
Between 1992 and 1996, 54 per cent of all
sites nominated and not added to the List
were European, as were 59 per cent of the sites
listed during the same period. European coun¬
tries thus submit more nominations than all
the other regions put together and also garner
more listings than they do. Table 2 clearly
illustrates this trend.
There are several reasons for this growing
imbalance. Firstly, the criteria for inclusion on
the list are interpreted in a special wayfmonu-
mentality or visible representativity are regarded
as self-evident criteria. These qualities are less
easily perceived in a cultural site in the Pacific
region than in a Greek or Roman site.
But other reasons are to be found
upstream. Thirty-seven UNESCO Member
States have still not adhered to the Conven¬
tion including fifteen from Africa south of
the Sahara, nine from Asia and the Pacific (eight
Pacific islands), six from Latin America and
the Caribbean, four from the Arab States and
three only from the European region.
Before a site can be nominated for inscrip¬
tion on the World Heritage List, it must
already feature on its country's national inven¬
tory of heritage properties, which is itself
deposited with the Convention Secretariat
according to a set formula. Nomination
dossiers, which have been improved since the
early years of the Convention, are becoming
increasingly complex and call for information
which is increasingly difficult to provide. Their
preparation calls for technical skills and admin¬
istrative capacities that are not everywhere avail¬
able. This penalizes the developing countries.
For several years, efforts have been made
by the Committee and the Secretariat to help

H m m a . i«aaVaL-3-*- r * _
these countries to make their national inven¬
tories, but the impact of these efforts is lim¬
ited, on the one hand by the conditions nec¬
essary for protection and conservation, on the
other by the difficulty of applying criteria of
authenticity, representativity and universal¬
ity to physical representations produced by
minority civilizations and cultures.
The big gap between the amounts allocated
by the Committee and the amounts of
approved requests (see Table 3) is bewilder¬
ing. At the beginning ofJune almost $220,000
(over 70 per cent of the available amount) were
left for preparatory assistance, and the rate of
use of the total approved by the Committee
is 37.1 per cent. While the Convention should
be rigorously implemented, it should not
become an instrument of exclusion or divi¬
sion. New, increased resources should be
deployed to obviate this risk.
Between the mid-10th and the early 14th centuries a
magnificent series of temples were built at Khajuraho
(Madhya Pradesh state, central India), a capital of the
Chandella Rajput dynasty. Around 20 have survived. This
group of monuments, a cultural site added to the World
Heritage List in 1986, constitutes an outstanding synthesis
of the architecture and ornamental carving of its period.
Right, the temple of Visvanatha.
