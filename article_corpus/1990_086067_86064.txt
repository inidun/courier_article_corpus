E,LECTRiciTY ¡s the power source
that drives the modem world. It pro¬
vides heat and light, it powers
machines and appliances and makes
global communications possible. In
the same way that friction limits the
efficiency of mechanical machines,
resistance to the flow of electrons
through the conducting material is
the limiting factor in any electrical
device.
In 1911, however, a type of
material was discovered which has no
electrical resistance. Known as super¬
conductors, such materials are effec¬
tively "frictionless" conductors if
you start an electric current moving
in a loop of superconductor it will
literally go on moving forever. They
are the electrical equivalent of a per¬
petual motion machine.
The one big drawback of the ear¬
ly superconductors was that they only
functioned at very low temperatures,
within a few degrees of absolute
zero, -273° Celsius, which is known
as 0 Kelvin or 0 K. Until a few years
ago, the highest recorded tempera¬
ture at which a superconductor
would work was 23 K. This meant
that liquid helium, an expensive liquid
to produce and store, had to be used
as a coolant.
This has not prevented supercon¬
ductors from being used. Magnets
can be made from coils of supercon¬
ducting wire which produce intense
magnetic fields. These have been put
44 to use in medical body scanners and

in magnetically levitated trains which
can reach speeds of 500 kilometres
an hour floating just centimetres
above the track. Japan has a work¬
ing prototype of just such a train.
Electronic devices made from super¬
conducting materials can be used as
extremely sensitive sensors or as com¬
ponents in super fast computers.
New superconducting
ceramics
In April 1986, however, everything
changed. Two researchers who
worked for IBM in Zurich, Georg
Bednorz and Alex Müller, stumbled
upon a ceramic made from the ele¬
ments lanthanum, copper, barium
and oxygen which became supercon¬
ducting at 35 K. Scientists in the
United States soon discovered similar
ceramics which worked at tempera¬
tures up to 98 K. This was very
significant since these new supercon¬
ducting ceramics could be cooled
with liquid nitrogen, which is much
cheaper than helium and a much
easier liquid to handle.
Suddenly the scientific world was
in turmoil and scientists all over the
world were racing to see who could
find the ceramic that showed super¬
conducting qualities at the highest
temperature. At a hastily convened
meeting of the American Physical
Society early in 1987, thousands of
physicists crammed into a ballroom in
New York's Hilton hotel and fiercely
debated the new discoveries until 6
a.m. The press quickly latched on and
hailed the meeting as the "Wood¬
stock for physicists". Magazines were
full of photographs of little blocks of
the new ceramics levitating over mag¬
nets. This phenomenon is an exam¬
ple of the Meissner effect, in which
a superconductor repels any magnet¬
ic field from penetrating its surface,
causing it to float above a magnet.
The potential of these new
materials was quickly seen and indus¬
trial companies as well as academic
researchers joined in the race.
Governments poured money into
research, not wanting other countries
to get a lead in exploiting the new
phenomenon. Reports flooded in of
higher and higher temperatures,
some even approaching room tem¬
perature, around 295 K. If this were
achieved it would literally transform
electrical technology. People spoke
optimistically of a world of super-
efficient machines, effortlessly fast
levitating trains and new high-speed
computers.
Many of the early reports were,
however, overly optimistic. Most of
the new ceramics which showed
superconducting behaviour at tem¬
peratures higher than 100 K were
unstable, and soon lost their super¬
conducting qualities, or were not
showing true superconductivity. To
date the highest confirmed temper¬
ature for a superconducting ceramic
is 125 K.
How the new superconductors
actually work is still confounding the
theorists. Electrical conduction occurs
when electrons free themselves from
their atoms and can move about in

the crystal structure of a conductor.
Resistance is created by the electrons
bumping into atoms in their path as
they move through the conductor.
The theory which explains traditional
low-temperature superconductors
predicts that electrons can avoid any
collisions by moving through the con¬
ductor on a vibration in the lattice just
as a surfer rides a wave on the ocean.
But in order to do this the electrons
have to move around in pairs, one
electron following the other like a
slipstreaming racing car.
The theory also predicts that
superconductivity cannot occur
above 35 K, so theorists have had to
start from scratch to explain the new
materials. There is no definitive theory
yet, but one strong contender
predicts that conduction occurs not
through the movement of electrons
but the movement of electron vacan¬
cies, or "holes", which jump from
atom to atom in the conductor.
Practical applications
The hype that surrounded the discov¬
ery of these new materials neglected
to mention the many problems that
must be overcome before useful ap¬
plications can be achieved. Supercon¬
ducting ceramics are produced as a
powder which can be compressed
into a rather brittle solid substance.
This brittleness makes it very difficult
to produce useful shapes such as
wires. Some success has been
achieved by using techniques taken
from the microelectronics industry.
The ceramics can be laid down as a
thin layer on top of another material
by gently spraying the constituent
parts of the ceramic at the underly¬
ing base. As they land, the molecules
arrange themselves into the crystal
structure of the ceramic.
Any useful application must
make use of one of the three special
properties of superconducting
materials. The first of these is the fact
that they will conduct electricity with
no resistance. The most obvious ap¬
plication would be in the transmission
of power from power stations to elec¬
tricity users. At the moment 1 0 to 20
per cent of all power produced is lost
during transmission, and so signifi¬
cant savings could be made. An effi¬
cient method of drawing the
ceramics into wires must be found
before these savings can be achieved.
Also, the new materials cannot carry
a large amount of current without
losing their superconducting quali¬
ties. The best they can manage at the
moment is one thousandth of the
current needed.
The second special property of
superconductors is their ability to
generate very strong magnetic fields.
Low-temperature superconductors
can generate fields 200,000 times
stronger than the earth's magnetic
field. Any electrical conductor can
generate a field. If formed into a
loop, a current round the loop will
generate a magnetic field through its
centre. It is a superconductor's ability
to conduct current effortlessly around
the loop which leads to such strong
fields.
Medical scanners and levitating
trains could both be made more sim¬
ply and cheaply using new high-
temperature superconducting mag¬
nets. So too could the Supercon¬
ducting Supercollider, a particle ac¬
celerator which the US government
plans to build in an 88-kilometre tun¬
nel under the state of Texas to study
the elementary particles of matter.
Accelerators use powerful magnets
to bend beams of particles into a cir¬
cular path so that they collide and the
fragments of their collisions can be
analysed.
The Meissner effect, described
above, prevents a magnetic field from
penetrating into a superconductor.
However, strong fields can break
through this repulsion, and if they do
this they destroy the superconduct¬
ing properties of the material. The
new superconducting ceramics have
so far proved susceptible to the ef¬
fects of strong fields, so their useful¬
ness for this sort of application may
be limited.
The Josephson junction
The third property of superconduct¬
ing materials is the one that looks the
most promising for the new ceramics.
If two superconductors are brought
very close together but not allowed
to touch, electrons can jump across
and current can flow as if the two
conductors were touching. The cur¬
rent across the gap is, however, very
sensitive to external electric and mag¬
netic fields, so this so-called Joseph-
son junction can be used as a very
accurate sensor of electric and mag¬
netic fields or as an electronic switch
like a transistor.
Devices based on Josephson
junctions can be used by biophysicists
to study the minute electrical fields
created by activity in the brain. On
board satellites they can be used in
detectors to look at the stars and
planets or down at the earth's sur¬
face. Computer chips based on
Josephson junctions, with intercon¬
necting wires also of superconduct¬
ing material, would be much faster
than conventional machines. The
technology for manufacturing these
tiny devices from the brittle ceramics
already exists, but many reliability
problems remain to be solved. It is in
these high-technology fields of sen¬
sors and electronics that we are most
likely to see the new superconductors
in use.
The likelihood of superconduc¬
tors that operate at room tempera¬
ture now seems remote, unless there
is another dramatic breakthrough or
a theory of superconductors which
can point the way to use at higher
temperatures. Very exciting possibil¬
ities for superconducting ceramics lie
ahead, but perhaps not those which
people originally imagined.
