AFRICA is certainly a continent
full of surprises. One of
them is to find that in cer-
tain places dikes, bridges,
roads, wells, conduits and
even rice paddies are being built
under the auspices of a ministry of
education.
What is even more astonishing to
anyone with a slight knowledge of
Africa is that the work has been
carried out enthusiastically and
voluntarily by Negroes from the most
isolated areas, who have not even
waited for the authorities to tell
them to start using their picks and
shovels for these public works !
I found this fact all the more
striking because I could remember
quite different attitudes among Afri-
cans. Not so long ago, for example,
I heard the health service director
in one of the continent's equatorial
territories complain that he could
not get men to accept jobs building
dispensaries intended exclusively for
the local population.
The Negroes of African countries,
regardless of the flag which flies
over them, still tend to shy away
from any collective activity, because
thev have so often been forced to
contribute to undertakings whose
value to them personally was far
from apparent. In some extreme
cases they still try to avoid work.
even when it is essential for their
own subsistence.
But men will work willingly as
soon as they see clearly that they are
contributing to improvements in
their own standards of living ; and
perhaps the best way to induce
Africans to work for themselves is to
apply Fundamental Education me-
thods as I have seen them in practice
in the British Gold Coast-methods
whose aim is simply to help people
to help themselve8.
The first problem in a colonial
territory is how to use such methods
without seeming to apply constraint,
and without arousing the suspicion
of hidden"imperialistic"motives.
The best way, unjust as it may seem,
is to make sure that the initiative
does not come from the officials who
exercise authority. Then it will not
take long for the villagers, the direct
beneficiaries of the scheme, to recog-
nize its advantages and co-operate
spontaneously with it.
But the distrust of some irrespons-
ible nationalists cannot be removed
so easily. In Nigeria, for example, I
listened to the protest of one of them
for whom Fundamental Education
was just another trick to ensure that,
as political power is turned over to
the Africans, the Europeans would
once again get the credit for being
the true benefactors of the popula-
tion.
For me, it was a strange objection.
I had just come from Liberia, where
the leaders of the only independent
country in this part of Africa were
eager for foreign co-operation in this
field. I had also been in the Gold
Coast, where Fundamental Education
is under the jurisdiction of an Afri-
can minister, and is carried out by
200 Africans and only six Europeans.
As a matter of fact, the Gold Coast
leaders welcome Fundamental Educa-
tion in this, the African colony
most advanced on the road to inde-
pendence. There is an African and
a nationalist majority in the Accra
legislative assembly and in Mr.
Nkrumah's Government. Both are
generous in their encouragement and
in the credits voted to the Depart-
ment of Social Welfare, the branch of
the Ministry of Education which is
responsible four Fundamental Educa-
tion in the colony. 
Last year this Department was
allowed H20, 000 for mass educa-
tion, in addition to £100, 000 in the
form of grants.. These relatively
large sums could be provided thanks
to the richness of the colony (it is
the world's largest producer of
cocoa).
Few countries in \Vest Africa
would be able to finance so great an
undertaking. The campaign here
is on a national scale, whereas
I'lséwhere it tends to be confined to
local or other limited experiments.
But even in the Gold Coast the
way in which the campaign is car-
ried out differs according to the
degree of development of the various
regions. The needs of the rich
Ashanti province in the south are
unlike those of the northern
territories.
The northern area has a quarter of
tlie population of the (, old Coast, and
roves a third of its total land sur-
face. But it has fewer than ten
doctors for 1, 000. 000 inhabitants, and

THE REMARKABLE STORY OF'MALIGU-NAA',
A MISSIONARY CHO BECAME A TRIBAL CHIEF
Maligu-Naa (Chief of the Preparations) is the title given to Mr. W. Lloyd Shirer, district mass
education and social welfare officer, by the Dagumba, a tribe numbering some 175, 000 people,
who are found in both the Gold Coast and Togoland. Mr. Shirer, a former missionary, is
seen here greeting a native chief, Mionlana, who uses a comfortable barber's chair as a throne.

an even smaller ratio of schools,
partly because the people were for
long unwilling to use them. The
villages lack water, food, roads, medi-
cal care-and how, with their own
small resources and revenues, would
the people be able to obtain such
things ?
The answer can be seen in the picks
and shovels at work at Janga, a
bulldozer which is kept busy at
Tampiong, cement and metal plates
that have arrived at Wungu---,. to
mention only a few villages in the
savarw between Tamale, the northern
'capital, and the frontier of Upper
Volta.
One village is to build a road over
which lorries will travel to collect
consignments of fish which pre-
viously could not be sent to market.
Another village plans to have its
half-ruined well cemented. A third
village knows that soon there will be
water on the spot for its people and
animals, instead of their having to go
and fetch it from several miles away ;
a dike near completion already holds
more reserves than ever existed
before in the region.
Better still, the water will permit
the irrigation of newly-made rice
paddies. This is particularly impor-
tant, for rice has not been grown
here before. The innovation would
certainly delight those agricultural
experts who believe that rice-grow-
ing in the tropics will not only im-
prove the health of the people, but
also the ravaged soil.
It remains to be seen whether the
people of Tampiong will eat the rice
they grow, instead of the yams to
which they are accustomed. But,
whether or not rice becomes part of
their diet, they will profit by it.
1.-This unusual looking
structure is one of the public
loudspeakers installed in the
villages of the colony by the
Gold Coast Department of In-
formation. 2.- The verna-
cular literature bureau for the
Gold Coast Northern Territories
at Tamalé supplies all the
publicatións and materials
needed for the mass education
campaign in this area. 3. - A
first step to fundamental educa-
tion in Tampiong was to im-
prove food and water supplies.
Here, a bulldozer provided by
the Department of Public
Works helps to construct a
dam. This will provide drink-
ing water for village people and
livestock and will also be used
to irrigate a new rice field.
With what they earn by its sale,
- some S200, a fortune for them-
they will be able to buy cloth and
other things they badly need.
Thousands of hours of work have
been put into undertakings of this
kind by local people. They contri-
buted their labour willingly, because
they could clearly see the practical
value to themselves of achievements
such as the several artificial lakes
t hat now shine in the sunlight near
Tamale, of the simple but strong
bridges, of the clean weUs, of the
latrines now used by everyone.
In some cases the villagers them-
!"elves conceived and undertook the
projects, and asked for technical
help. An example is the road from
Janga to Nassia. For 90 miles
: n'ound Tamale, this aid was given
bv an American named W. L. Shirer,
who was first known in the region as
a Protestant missionary. He has
since become at the same time a
British official and a native chief-
with a Catholic missionary, Brother
Aidan, as his principal helper.
The title, Maligu-Naa, which
means"Chief of the Preparations",
has appropriately been given to Mr.
Shirer, who stimulates the material
progress of the rural communities,
and helps the people get some
elements of rudimentary education.
'"Maligu-Naa"never stays long in
any single spot within the huge area
where he works. He travels, gives
advice, lends tools, which in many
cases he has borrowed from official
source, such as the hydraulic, rural,
agricultural, health and public works
services. Before he moves on, he
leaves people able to carry on the
good work.
The social welfare and mass educa-
tion service is a permanent insti-
tution in the Gold Coast. It has its

COURIER FEBRUARY 1953. Page 7
own staff, which is increasing
rapidly. It starts with probationers,
who must be local people, makes
them monitors, and assigns them to
travelling teams. To make this
possible, a rural training centre was
established in the northern region of
the Gold Coast, and another in the
Ashanti province. They are.'semin-
aries"for the new type of.'mis-
sionary".
Mr. Shirer is in charge of the
centre at Tamale, where he also
receives volunteers from villages in
the brush country. The enthusiasm
of these unpaid rural volunteers is
extraordinary. They find the days
too short for all they want to learn.
One group pleaded to be allowed to
stay at the centre not for two weeks,
but for two years !
Each workshop in the brush coun-
try has a Fundamental Education
team of from four to eleven members,
who stay for at least two months.
Their activities alone are enough to
change the whole life of a village by
improving such things as farm
methods and hygiene.
But the struggle against illiteracy
always remains the basis of the
team's work, and achievements of a
more spectacular nature should not
lead the visitor to forget it. The
certificates delivered to people who
have become literate are as impor-
tant in their way as the material
accomplishments of the villagers.
In the Gold Coast, as in every Brit-
ish colony, it has always been a
principle to teach in the local
dialect. The problem of"raw mater-
ials"this set in the campaign to
teach reading was solved by printing
textbooks not only in each of the
principal local languages, but also in
those never before written.
This explains the existence in the
small town of Tamalé of what is
probably the only real printing press
in this latitude between the Mediter-
ranean and the Gulf of Guinea.
Material in three different languages
is produced on its small but modern
machines, some of them of the kind
used by the American army in the
field.
In the few months during which
the press has operated, tens of
thousands of booklets have been
published and sold at half the cost
price : they include spelling books,
reading texts and collections of
sketches. Some reach a circulation
of over 5, 000. Except for Mrs. Shi-
rer, an American, who directs the
establishment, the staff is made up
entirely of Africans.
In the Ashanti province, Mr. Shi-
rer's opposite number is a New
Zealander, Mr. Owen Barton. The
local press mentions one or other of
his many activities almost every day.
Judging by the programme which
Mr. Shirer and Mr. Barton have ready
for the visitor the moment he gets
out of an aeroplane, and the distances
they expect him to travel, it is pjain
that they take little leisure from
their quite different tasks.
From the Ashanti province and its
magnificent forests, the Gold Coast
gets most of its wealth, thanks to
cocoa and wood. The people are
strong and active. Kumasi, the
capital, presents a spectacle of great
activity and animation, notably in its
market, one of the largest in the
world. Few African regions enjoy
such well-being, which shows itself
even in the villages by the size and
the architecture of the houses, by
the excellence of the shops and the
presence of many taxicabs.
The problem here, therefore, was
not so much to create the means by
which the communities might
develop ; rather it was to provide
technical advice and a framework
for the development. For each
village has all the facilities for
providing adult courses-but it
needs help in the setting up of a
committee for the struggle against
illiteracy.
The eagerness of the Ashantis to
team becomes quite plain when one
sees Mr. Barton, at each stop made by
his motor-car, being besieged by a
score of people eagerly offering their
3d. for a spelling book. In some
places, as many as 200 people attend
the courses.
If there is any African region in
which it is a sound and justified
policy to give aid in return for local
co-operation, that region is Ashanti.
Every year the government allocates
special funds for distribution as
grants to the communities, but they
are given only when the communities
themselves make contributions of
money or labour.
For example, a village which
wanted a post office provided half
the necessary cost. Another village
needed to level its main street and
flank it with gutters ; the womenfolk
took it in turns to come from the
different neighbourhoods to carry
away in pots and pans on their heads
the earth dug up by their men. A
third village which also decided to
make gutters for its streets was
provided with cement-and the
children helped their elders by ex-
terminating swarms of mosquitoes,
under the direction of a health
service agent.
Still another village decided to
move itself bodily to the side of the
Accra-Kumasi road, a mile away.
Mr. Barton took the opportunity to
tell its leaders about housing prin-
ciples, which may lead to the birth
of a model village.
The headquarters of all these activi-
ties is the rural training centre at
Kwaso, where Mr. Barton's 60 Afri-
can helpers learned how to carry out
their new tasks. They are now
scattered all over the region, and are
hard at work. Women have come to
the centre for five-day courses in
child care and nutrition. Unesco
has sent a student from Liberia.
I was able to observe all the activi-
ties on my tour through the forest,
from the making of new roads to
sewing lessons, from orchestra
rehearsals to adult education classes.
They confirmed eloquently the broad
scope and great value of the centre.
The undeniable benefits are ap-
propriately symbolized by the tribal
chief of Kwaso, who received me on
a throne framed on one side by a
portrait of Queen Elizabeth and the
Duke of Edinburgh, on the other by
a propaganda poster on the raising of
cocoa-and also by his own and his
grandson's literacy certificates.
Another indication is the fact that
village life has become so worth
while that this year far fewer people
left during the 'dead"season.
The task of freeing the African
peoples from ignorance and poverty
might sometimes seem insoluble. It
would be if the authorities tried to
cope with it by their own means
alone, hence taking the risk of finding
themselves unequal to the difficulties.
On the other hand, however, it can
be hoped that the"national cam-
paign"being conducted throughout
the Gold Coast, and especially its good
progress in the Ashanti region, will
show the possibility of working more
quickly and winning a whole people
through the co-operation of local
populations in an undertaking whose
meaning and benefits they understand.
