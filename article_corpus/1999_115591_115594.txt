“ I t ’s hard to explain what ’s happened to
u s. All we have left is our name:
A m u n g m e .The mountains, the ri ve rs ,
the forests—everything—belongs to Free-
p o rt and the gove rnment now. We have
nothing left.”
These words of an old man in Irian Jaya
( I n d o n e s i a n - ruled West Pa p u a ) ,r e p o rted by
members of Survival International,a non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n , sum up the loss
and injustice felt by millions of indigenous
peoples around the wo r l d . For more than 30
ye a rs , according to many NGOs, the United
N at i o n s , European Members of Pa r l i a m e n t
and U. S .S e n at o rs , these “ o ri gi n a l ”i n h a b i-
tants of our planet have watched their land
being polluted,their holy places destroyed
and their families wasting away or dying in
the name of a “development” they are the
last to benefit from.
In Indonesia, the U.S. firm Freeport-
McMoRan, in association with the British
company Rio Tinto and local authorities
including ex-President Suhart o, a c c o r d i n g
to Survival, has rights to an area as big as
B e l gium in the wo r l d ’s largest gold reserve ,
which is also ve ry rich in copper. Mining has
polluted the ri ve rs , d e s t r oyed one of the
wo r l d ’s best-preserved virgin forests and
d e s e c r ated religious sites. M a ny NGOs have
denounced the army for using violence
against people protesting this damage.
In Colombia,5,000 Uwa A m e rindians are
resisting the use of their sacred lands by Occi-
dental Pe t r o l e u m . After threatening mass
s u i c i d e , they have attracted so many suppor-
t e rs that Shell has said it will pull out of its
p a rt n e rship with Occidental in the area.
With Shell, it’s a case of once bitten,
twice shy. In Nigeri a , the company is fa c i n g
stiff opposition from the Ogoni and Ijaw
people, who are demanding that it should
l e ave unless they obtain rights to the rich oil
deposits on their lands. In conjunction with
the gove rn m e n t , Shell began drilling in
Ogoniland in 1958 and has since extracted
an estimated $30 billion worth of oil.
In 1995, aWorld Council of Churches
fa c t - finding mission reported that the local
people had no electri c i t y, telephones or
basic health facilities and that the environ-
ment was seriously damaged.The Ogonis
s ay Shell had close links to the army, w h i c h
crushed any protests. The crisis came to a
head in November 1995, when nine Ogoni
l e a d e rs , including the writer Ken Saro-
Wiwa, were executed by hanging.
Activism
has paid dividends

activities of transnational companies wo r-

p e o p l e , who number around 300 million
wo r l d w i d e .D u ring the 1980s, they began to
organize themselves and in 1982 a special
UN working group helped strengthen their
n e t works and brought them to intern at i o n a l
at t e n t i o n .
Their position was summed up in the
1992 Declaration of Kari-Oca, in Brazil,
whose preamble states that “We, the Indi-
genous Pe o p l e s , maintain our inherent
rights to self-determ i n ation and to our lands
and terri t o ri e s.”Their aim is to win decision-
making power over company projects, the
right to oppose them and, if they approve
them, the right to share the profits. Their
well-publicized battle has been highlighted
by many human rights and pro-env i r o n-
ment organizat i o n s , including A m n e s t y
I n t e rn at i o n a l , Human Rights Wat c h ,M i n e-
Watch,Survival International and Friends
of the Earth.
A foreign company can no longer start
operations on indigenous lands without a
mass of websites reporting on its eve ry
m ove m e n t . The public in rich countri e s
takes other action as well,often occupying
a company’s headquarters and boycotting
its products.
Such widespread activism has brought
results. Indigenous people have long been
considered by their states as obstacles to
d e ve l o p m e n t , as groups which have to be at
best assimilated and at worst eliminated.
They are now recognized in several coun-
t ri e s , including Denmark, the United Stat e s ,
Canada and Australia, as full citizens with
rights to their lands. In the Philippines,
they are negotiating to monitor mining pro-
jects. In Latin America, several countries
have amended their national constitutions
to give them some protection.
In the hope of further progr e s s , t h e y
are waiting with great anticipation for the
UN declaration on their rights which is
due to be adopted before the end of the
United Nations Decade for Indigenous
Peoples (1995-2004).
They can boast of some small victories
over the transnationals. They have forced
s e veral big firm s , such as Mobil Oil in Pe ru ,
to drop projects. They have managed to
get others to negotiate and to help restore
the environment.They have also called for
compensation for past injustices. But only
rarely do they win a real share of profit s ,a s
some Inuits or North A m e rican Indians
have managed to do.
Windfalls that revive
ethnic tensions
“The transnationals can’t have it all
their own way any more,” s ays Julian Burger,
of the UN High Commission for Human
Rights.The companies are losing an enor-
mous amount of money because of sabotage
and local resistance (Shell was forced to
suspend operations in the Niger Delta in
1993) and perhaps even more by discredi-
ting themselves in the eyes of consumers in
rich countries.
On its we b s i t e ,S h e l l - N i g e ria admits its
“responsibility” to indigenous peoples. It
s ays it spent $32 million in Nigeria in 1997,
mainly to build schools and hospitals,and
pledges that “until the end of the century,
at least a fifth of its budget”will go to res-
toring the environment. In the same year,
F r e e p o rt invested one per cent of its profit s
in Indonesia in development projects in
Irian Jaya.
After adding environmental preservat i o n
to their codes of conduct and investing in
“cleaner” infrastructures, more and more
t r a n s n ational firms are saying they will push
human rights issues. But on the spot, t h i n g s
are ve ry tough, they point out.They are up
against local tribal and military leaders
more interested in making money for them-
selves than helping the local community.
F r e e p o rt says the first big payments it
doled out in Indonesia to set up a deve l o p-
ment fund were stolen by a local gove rn-
ment offic i a l .The sharing out of this wind-
fall has revived old ethnic tensions and wa s
a factor in setting off tribal wa r fa r e . A n d
sometimes the anger of local people whose
l i ves have been ravaged over several decades
is too strong to be placated by a foreign
c o m p a ny ’s change of policy.
When attacked by human rights cam-
p a i g n e rs who accuse them of not opposing
repression, and even taking part in it, the
t r a n s n ationals take refuge behind the pri n-
ciple of national sove r e i g n t y, s aying only
governments have the right to make deci -
sions about their people. It is also ve ry hard
for them to refuse deals on grounds of pri n-
ciple or give up a large part of their profits
in a competitive world where shareholders
want maximum profits.
Ineffectual monitoring systems
As a result, m a ny people wants to see a
body of laws and intern ational rules to regu-
l ate the operations of transnational firm s.B u t
attempts to do this have so far failed or had
little effect.The UN centre set up in 1974 to
draft a list of rights and responsibilities of
transnationals was disbanded in 1993 and
guidelines on the subject worked out by
the Organization for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development (OECD) and the
International Labour Organisation (ILO)
are not mandatory.
The most recent attempt in this direc-
tion was a European parliament resolution
in January this year calling for monitoring
of the operations of European transnatio-
n a l s , notably by holding we l l - a d ve rt i s e d
public hearings starting this June, w h e r e
N G O s , trade unions and firms will be able
to voice their grievances.
“ M a ny existing codes of conduct aren’t
wo rth the paper they’re written on because
they aren’t implemented,” says Euro-MP
Richard How i t t , who drafted the resolu-
tion.“We want European companies to be
monitored to see how far they comply with
i n t e rn ational law in the field of env i r o n-
ment, human rights and labour rights, in
particular as far as indigenous peoples are
concerned. Many indigenous groups face
extinction and tragically European com-
panies have been part of the threat to these
communities.” n
