               a state-sponsored doping programme that involved an estimated 10,000 athletes. 
doping for glory 
in east germany
East Germany’s sporting system was 
dubbed the “Miracle Machine” as 
the communist nation of 16 million 
people became an Olympic power 
to rival the Soviet Union and the 
United States of America which 
had populations 18 times bigger. 
But the country’s sports stars 
paid a high price for their remark-
able success. 
“They stole our souls and turned 
our bodies into mere objects,” says 
Ines Geipel, a former sprinter and 
long jumper. 
Geipel, and an estimated 10,000 
sportsmen and women like her, 
were victims of a comprehen-
sive state-sponsored doping pro-
gramme, forced to take steroids 
to allow them to train harder but 
which had dramatic side-effects. 
In the second half of its 35-year 
history, the German Democratic 
Republic consistently finished 
among the top three nations 
at summer and winter Olympic 
Games. 
There were suspicions about its 
medal haul for years, but it was 
only after the Berlin Wall fell in 
1989 and Germany was reunited 
a year later that athletes and swim-
mers came forward to admit that 
their achievements were fuelled by 
drugs. 
Many say they had no idea they 
were being given anabolic steroids 
by doctors; they were usually told 
the pills were vitamins. Secret 
files released after reunification 
showed that children as young as 
10 were given them.
Amazing physical 
transformations
The drugs, especially the infamous 
Oral-Turinabol steroid, altered muscle 
structure, caused voices to deepen 
and promoted male pattern hair 
growth and changes to genitalia. 
The most infamous case is Heidi 
Krieger, who won the European shot 
putt title in 1986. She was given so 
much male hormone to develop the 
muscles to excel in her discipline that 
by 1997 Heidi looked and felt like a 
man, and underwent an operation to 

complete the sex change. Today she 
is known as Andreas Krieger. 
Other female athletes were ren-
dered infertile, while those who 
gave birth often had children with 
defects. 
Now some former sportswomen 
want their tainted records to be 
erased. 
Ines Geipel was part of the 4x100 
metres relay team of her club SC 
Motor Jena which set a national 
record time of 42.20 seconds in 
1984. It has never been beaten, 
but Geipel had her name removed 
from the record books and says 
the time should be wiped too. 
“That record is poisoned by dop-
ing,” she says. 
Petra Schneider, a swimmer who 
won a gold and a silver medal at 
the 1980 Moscow Olympics, has 
made a similar call because her 
performances were influenced by 
steroids. 
She describes her national record 
for the 400 metres individual med-
ley, which has stood for 24 years, 
as “a relic of the past”. “I want the 
record books to be wiped clean,” 
she says.
Results, 
but at what cost?
The goal of the doping programme 
was to show the supposed superior-
ity of the communist system through 
sporting glory. 
Until 1968, West German athletes 
outperformed their East German 
counterparts. The turnaround was 
dramatic. The East German regime 
began planning years in advance 
to spoil West Germany’s so-called 
coming-out party, the 1972 Munich 
Olympics. 
East Germany won 20 gold med-
als at those games, finishing third 
behind the Soviet Union and the 
USA and a significant seven golds 
ahead of West Germany.
East Germany was placed second 
in the medals’ table at the 1976 
Montreal Olympics with 40 gold 
medals, bettered only by the Soviet 
Union. Eleven of the golds came 
from athletics and 11 from swim-
ming and all but two of those win-
ners were women. 
It was also the second biggest 
medal winner at the 1980 Moscow 
Olympics, which was blighted by 
the US-led boycott. At the 1988 
Seoul Olympics, the East Germans 
finished second behind the Soviet 
Union, winning 37 golds. 
Some officials from the former East 
Germany claim that doping was not 
a major factor in its success and 
point to the fact that athletes from 
the country continued to win medals 
even when part of the united Ger-
man team. 
But criminal trials and research, es-
pecially that done by Professor Wer-
ner Franke and Brigitte Berendonk, 
have shown that organized doping 
was a crucial element of the system. 
In 2000, Manfred Ewald, East Ger-
many’s most senior sports official, 
and Manfred Höppner, the head of 
its sports medicine service, were 
given suspended jail sentences of 
22 months and 18 months respec-
tively for their part in the doping pro-
gramme. 
And in September last year, 193 
former East German sportsmen and 
women were each awarded com-
pensation of 10,400 euros by the 
German state for being forced to 
take drugs. 
The Interior Minister of Germany at 
the time, Otto Schily, said: “It is al-
most impossible to compensate for 
the physical and mental suffering 
they endured.”
