[…] The author of the present 
article hopes he is not abusing 
his freedom in confessing to the 
embarrassment, not to say uneasi-
ness, he felt at the announcement 
of the survey decided upon by the 
UNESCO General Conference’s 
resolution. In his view, the inte-
rest shown in the “main trends of 
research in the social and human 
sciences” is in sharp contrast to 
the way in which these sciences 
have been ignored and neglected 
in the very quarters where the 
greatest enthusiasm has been 
shown for the project. […] 
We should not 
have voiced similar 
doubts with regard 
to the prev ious 
survey of the trends 
of research in the 
natural sciences. But 
there the situation 
was different: those 
sciences have exis-
ted for so long, and 
have furnished so 
many and such stri-
king proofs of their 
capabilit ies, that 
their reality is no 
longer in doubt.

semantic fiction and a philoso-
phical hope which has yet to be 
conf irmed. The paral lel ism 
implied, even if only by the titles 
of the two surveys, therefore 
reveals a somewhat fanciful 
conception of the facts. […] 
But, before we start looking 
for a solution which will inevita-
bly be unsatisfactory, it may be 
useful to review briefly 
cer t a in cont r ibutor y 
causes of the disparity 
between the physical and 
the human sciences. […] 
To tell the truth, the 
function of the human 
sciences seems to lie 
 halfway between explana-
tion and anticipation, as if 
they were unable to make 
a definite choice between 
the two roles. This does 
not mean that these scien-
ces are useless from both 
the theoretical and the 
practical  …
A semantic 
fiction
The author of the pre-
sent report has devo-
ted his whole life to 
the social and human 
sciences. But he has not the sli-
ghtest reluctance to admit that 
there can be no pretence that 
they and the natural sciences are 
really on an equal footing, or to 
acknowledge that the latter are 
indeed sciences while the former 
are not; and that if the same term 
is, none the less, applied to both, 
it is done on the strength of a

UNESCO’s decision to undertake a survey on the main 
trends of research in the social and human sciences 
did not delight Lévi-Strauss. In this 13 March 1964 
text, of which we are printing excerpts, he points out 
the problems this project raises.

that, while the criterion of 
 scientific knowledge can be 
defined only by reference to 
Western science (which, it 
seems, no society will contest), 
the social and human sciences 
with the best claim to inclu-
sion are by no means all 
Western. Modern linguists rea-
dily admit that, as criteria of 
science in the social and 
human disciplines regards cer-
tain fundamental discoveries, 
Indian grammarians were seve-
ral centuries ahead of them; 
and this is probably not the 
only field in which the advan-
tage will have to be conceded 
to Eastern and Far Eastern 
knowledge. 
In another sphere, ethnolo-
gists today are convinced that 
even societies at a very low 
technical and economic level, 
unacquainted with writing, 
have sometimes succeeded in 
giving their political or social 
institutions a conscious and 
considered character, which 
imparts a scientific value to them. 
[…] 
If the progress of knowledge 
should eventually demonstrate that 
the social and human sciences 
deserve the name of sciences, the 
proof will come from experience: 
by verifying that he world of scien-
tific knowledge is round, and in 
the belief that they are moving 
away from each other to achieve 
the status of positive sciences, 
although by opposite routes, the 
social and the human sciences, 
without even realizing it, will 
merge with the exact and natural 
sciences from which they will no 
longer be distinguishable. 
position. But the alternative 
would raise practically insupera-
ble difficulties […] 
I have proposed that the only 
researches to be used as a basis 
for the survey should be those 
capable of satisfying an external 
criterion – that of conformity to 
the standards of sc ient if ic 
knowledge as generally accepted, 
not only by specialists in the 
social and human sciences (which 
would bring in the danger of a 
vicious circle) but also by those 
in the exac t and natural 
sciences. 
On this basis, a very wide 
consensus should be obtainable. 
But it will at once be remarked 
… points of view, but 
rather that their usefulness 
has to be gauged by refe-
rence to both, neither of 
which can ever be conside-
red entirely alone but, when 
combined, produce a new 
attitude in which the pecu-
liar mission of the human 
sciences is epitomized. The 
human sciences never – or 
very seldom – explain com-
pletely, and they do not 
predict with complete cer-
tainty. But, for all that they 
may only understand a quar-
ter or a half of what they 
have to consider, and may 
be able to foresee only in 
one out of two or four cases, 
they are yet able, because 
of the intimate connexion 
between these half-measu-
res, to give to those who 
practise them something 
that comes between pure 
knowledge and practical 
efficiency – discrimination, 
or at any rate, a certain kind of 
discrimination which makes it 
possible, with slightly better 
understanding, to act a little less 
clumsily, although without ever 
being able to determine exactly 
what is owed to either of the two 
aspects. […]
What sciences are we 
talking about?
Should the “trends” of research in 
the survey be those of contempo-
rary Western science, or should 
all the reflections on man produ-
ced at other periods and in other 
parts of the world be included? 
From a theoretical point of view, 
it is hard to see what principle 
could justify taking up the first
