There is no denying the potential violence
surrounding the current water crisis.
About 40 percent of the world’s
population live in river basins shared by
two or more countries. These basins
comprise more then 50 percent of our
planet’s landmass. Only a fool would be
surprised to find competing claims over
w a t e r.Yet this interdependence does not
inevitably lead to war over water.
The “water war”thesis may actually
help create the very conflicts it seeks to
a v o i d . It is usually presented as a growing
number of people vying for less and less
water. However, the current crisis is not
about an absolute limit, but about
d i s t r i b u t i o n . For water to reach people at
the right place and time, a government
must have access to technology,
knowledge and money as well as the
institutional capacity to distribute this
essential resource.
The wealthy North cannot approach
the South by saying, “Conserve water!
D o n ’t develop the resource. D o n ’t use
water-saving technologies to grow food.
And for God’s sake, reduce population!”
This message may be based upon good
intentions but it reinforces a sense of  panic
and the notion of a zero-sum game, i n
which one side must compete against
another for water. It is a message to the
bullies,“You better get yours first!”
By focusing on looming water wars,
we fail to see water as a tool for
preventive diplomacy. For example, a
river basin forces us to rethink notions of
i n t e r -
d e p e n d e n c e. Instead of fearing it as
w e a k n e s s,we use it as a network to better
respond to the tests of nature. B y
exchanging information on events like a
flood or  drought, states can reduce the
potential danger.This flexibility addresses
the basic, almost primordial fear that has
driven humans to become toolmakers
and engineers: fear of uncertainty in a
harsh environment. While often
challenging the engineering mentality,
this same fear inspires environmental
c o n c e r n s. Somehow water forces us to go
d e e p e r, beyond adversarial relationships,
to confront what we really share—an
instinct for life.
Water is one of our enduring human
symbols of life, regeneration,purity and
h o p e. It is one of our potent links with the
s a c r e d , with nature and with our cultural
i n h e r i t a n c e. It offers a medium for a
global project that unifies humanity in a
single cause for peace, stability and
ecological sustainability. The water war
thesis takes us in the opposite direction.
It denies the universal acceptance of
water as a common good.
The water war thesis has raised
consciousness of the resource. But we
are in danger of crying wolf too often.
This thesis plays to human fears—fears of
c h a n g e, fears of deprivation, fears of
l i m i t s, fears of violence and indeed
primordial fears of death. It is time to
move beyond fear to action. L e a d e r s
need to rediscover and harness water’s
capacity to generate wealth, its potential
for multiple uses and reuse, its great
convening power, its ability to provide
the learning ground for building civic
culture.
Perhaps we need to “go back to the
future”and look at how water has been
used in order to redefine the goals of
water leadership. Water holds the
potential for both conflict and
cooperation—the choice is ours. ■
