ÍRAN
tomorrow's
plosion
RAN is launching a special
programme to show its vast inheri¬
tance of historical monuments to more
people. It is doing this with the co¬
operation of Unesco.
The careful restoration and display
of Iran's artistic and architectural
treasures will help to reveal to the
world their full cultural significance.
To study these monuments is to
contemplate a panorama of the coun¬
try's history and art. Scattered across
the million and a half square kilo¬
metres of this arid plateau traversed
by mountains are the legacies of every
period. Hundreds of Stone Age settle¬
ments lie along the former shores of
dried-up lakes. The Zoroastrian fire
worshippers have left shrines which
range from primitive altars to the ruins
of sophisticated temples. The ancient
capital of the Medes, Ecbatana, is still
hidden under the modern buildings of
the city of Hamadan; but the Persian
Empire, which Cyrus founded 2,500
years ago and which was the real
beginning of the Iranian state,
reappears today in the palaces of Pas-
argades and Susa, the monumental
bas-relief of Darius I at Bisotoun
(whose inscriptions made it possible
to decipher cuneiform writing) and
especially the royal city of Persepolis,
one of the world's most impressive
historical sites.
The Parthian rulers, who recovered
Iran's independence from the succes¬
sors of Alexander the Great, and the
later Sassanian dynasty have made
their own contributions: domed palaces
in picturesque settings and huge bas-
reliefs on the sides of mountains are
memorials of a time when the Great
King of Persia and the Roman Empe¬
ror were called the twin lighthouses
of the world.
This powerful head was once
part of a capital (shaped as the
forepart of a human-headed bull).
It crowned one of the innumerable
columns in the mighty palaces
and halls of Persepolis, Iran,
and is now in the Tehran Museum.

The largest inheritance has been
that of Islam, which, from the seventh
century onward, changed every aspect
of Iranian civilization; new ideas of
art, architecture, philosophy and scien¬
ce, new customs and ways of living
are reflected in its mosques and pal¬
aces and tombs. The style and
conception of these Islamic monuments
which varied greatly during success¬
ive periods, for example, those of the
Seljuks, the Mongols and the Timurids
are in harmony with the contem¬
porary poetry, miniature painting,
ceramics and carpet-weaving that
gave peculiarly rich expression to the
Iranian genius.
F,ROM the beginning of the
sixteenth century to the beginning of
the eighteenth, the Safawid rulers,
especially the fabulous Shah Abbas I,
gave Iran a new Golden Age. Every¬
where in the country, the works of
the Safawids remain, but their most
astounding achievement was the thous-
and-and-one-nights city of Isfahan,
whose palaces, mosques, fountains,
gardens and mysterious streets have
survived until our time.
The subsequent Zend and Qajar
periods were an age of decay, when
technologically the country was fall¬
ing behind the nations of Europe and
North America galvanized by their
industrial revolution. Nevertheless,
many subtle baroque monuments of
this time form a valuable portion of
the cultural inheritance of Iran.
The Christian and other religious
minorities which have lived side by
side with the Moslems of Iran have
left original monuments to their own
faith and customs, dating from the
Middle Ages down to this century.
The importance of these monuments
for the cultural life of Iran is obvious.
Yet the problems of maintenance, to
say nothing of restoration and display,
are enormous. Guardians for several
thousand scattered units, many of them
in isolated areas, and the payment of
the most urgent repairs call for sub¬
stantial sums. For the vast number
of historical buildings in private hands,
the difficulties are even greater. The
archaeological sites of Iran are them¬
selves a huge enterprise. The national
administrative and technical machinery
for the protection of monuments needs
to be strengthened, and schools for
specialists created. Many new mu¬
seums are needed; for example, there
is not yet a carpet museum in the
country.
In fact, the effort required could
seem almost too much for a develop¬
ing country that should husband all
its resources to improve its economy
and the social conditions of its people.
However, the growth of tourism has
changed the problem. The expansion
of modern communications has at last
made international tourism in Iran pos¬
sible; it is expected to take on con¬
siderable proportions during the next
few years. It will not only open up
the country and its culture more widely
to the rest of the world, but also
stimulate its economy. Financial sacri¬
fices which will contribute to tourism
are therefore acceptable and even
necessary.
Now historical monuments and sites
are important to tourism everywhere,
but in a country like Iran they are vital.
People will not travel this far merely
for sport or recreation which they
can get closer to home but for a
unique cultural revelation. Iran, which
wants to preserve its cultural heritage
for its own sake, is also duty bound
to do so for practical reasons.
As soon as it laid down this prin¬
ciple, the Iranian Government sought
to translate it into action. For this, it
called upon the technical aid of
Unesco. Missions were sent to advise
the Iranian authorities on the prepara¬
tion of a specific plan for the preser¬
vation and display of monuments and
the development of tourism consider¬
ed as a single, integrated activity.
The special programme which result¬
ed from these studies has three main
features. It was decided not to extend

uments and audience halls,
including a Throne Hall with
99 columns and a Hall of
100 Columns. The construction
of Persepolis was begun by
Darius I in 520 B.C. and con¬
tinued by his son Xerxes and
by Artaxerxes I. To Perse¬
polis each spring came the
peoples of the Persian Empire
to render homage. Portrayed
in stone that once glittered
in bright colours, they still
seem to be mounting the
stairways and filing towards
the throne hall of their ruler
(see page 18). This ritual
procession in stone is one
of the actual ceremonies that
took place here nearly 25 cen¬
turies ago, when Darius con¬
ceived Persepolis as a meet¬
ing place for all his subject
peoples. For many years Iran
has taken steps to protect
the noble ruins of Persepolis
from the erosive effects of
wind and weather. Several
Unesco missions have made
on-the-spot studies at Iran's
request. In 1963, a Unesco
specialist suggested the use
of photographs taken ten
years earlier (including this
panoramic view) to detect by
comparison any deterioration
in the sculpture and stonework.

IRAN (Continued)
Around the world to see Isfahan
action to the country as a whole, but
to concentrate it on four priority areas,
leaving to the future the development
of other regions. Secondly, since
tourism and the preservation of monu¬
ments involve tasks which are of the
competence of many different kinds of
specialists, the programme will need
to be carried out by a special inter-
ministerial commission in which all the
ministries, departments and govern¬
mental services concerned with any
aspect of the work are represented.
Lastly, the programme is designed to
form an integral part of the national
five-year plan for development.
The monuments in the four priority
areas of Iran's programme represent
all periods of Iranian history, show
practically all aspects of its culture and
are set in impressive and contrasting
landscapes. For each of these areas,
the programme has a list of specific
projects bearing upon communications
in the area, tourist plant such as
hotels, restaurants, recreational and
other facilities, the preservation and
display of monuments and sites
and the organization of museums, and
lastly, laws and regulations relating
to this action.
T

HE first area lies along the
road from the Turkish frontier in the
northwest to Tehran. This has always
been one of the main lines of commu¬
nication between Europe and the
Orient. Today it is to become a
section of the great Asian Highway.
The road, when it enters Iranian
territory, crosses the high volcanic
plateau of Azerbaijan. Mt. Ararat, near
the corner where Turkey, Iran and the
U.S.S.R. meet, is visible from the road.
The picturesque villages have often
beautiful mud houses well adapted to
the extremes of the climate. They
would seem doomed to be replaced
by more modern buildings, but the plan
is to preserve the external appearance
of at least some of these villages which
are gradually being endowed with
modern conveniences.
The area is dotted with medieval
Armenian churches of original styles,
the most famous of which, the
eleventh-century Qara Kilissieh or
Black Church, is à place of annual
pilgrimage for Armenian Christians
throughout Iran.
Contrasts are everywhere. At the
edge of the town of Maku, a late
nineteenth-century baroque palace
built by a great feudal lord of the
region and stocked with all the curio
sities which the wealth of that time
could accumulate, is to be opened as
a museum. The town of Khoï has a
Mongol tower whose sides are decorat¬
ed with the horns of dozens of wild
animals. Marand has a Mongol mos¬
que, but also a primeval shrine of the
fire-worshippers.
The great city of Tabriz lies some
distance away from the vast salt lake
of Urmieh. Tabriz, all in red brick,
has many exquisite mosques, an old
bazaar, a curious museum devoted to
the revolution of 1906 which gave
Iran its first constitution, and the ruins
of the thirteenth-century Blue Mosque
with ceramic tiles whose exact hues
have not been reproduced elsewhere.
Farther east, other mountain ranges
are crossed. A ruined sixteenth-cen¬
tury red-brick caravanserai beside
the road, of unusual beauty, which
would soon disappear altogether if it
were .left as it stands, is to be restor¬
ed and made to serve as a motel.
A side road from the highway will
lead to a place in the mountains call¬
ed the Takht-e-Soleiman or Throne of
Solomon, near a lake in the crater of
an extinct volcano. This may one day
prove to be one of the major curio¬
sities of this part of Iran. A dead
city here, now being excavated by a
German archaeological expedition, was
one of the holiest centres of the
Zoroastrian fire worshippers, and
Zoroaster himself was believed to
have been born here.
The traveller along the highway
encounters medieval castles and
bridges, then the glistening nineteenth-
century Persian city of Zenjan. Later
on he reaches the famous funerary
mosque of the Mongol sultan Oljaitu
Khodabendeh. Of the great city of
Soltanieh which surrounded it, no
trace is to be seen. Today the great
lonely mosque rises above a tiny mud
village on a long plain against a back¬
ground of snow-capped mountains.
The monument will be given extensive
repairs and the old village preserv¬
ed. Modern buildings for tourists will
be allowed only at some distance,
beside the highway.
A series of measures are needed
at Qazvin, once the capital of Iran
and rich in palaces, mosques, chur¬
ches and baths of the past three cen¬
turies. The highway runs parallel to
the Elburz Mountains in which are the
castles of the Hashishin, a Mohamme¬
dan sect whose warlike piety and
mysticism during the Middle Ages
earned it a dire reputation among its
enemies.
The second priority area covers
Tehran and its surroundings. The
capital of the country is the natural
centre of its communications system,
as well as of its cultural life, and
practically all foreign visitors come
here. The great modern city in the
throes of rapid expansion gives, at
first, the impression that it has little
connexion with the past. However,
in addition to the museums and such
famous curiosities as the jewels and
regalia exhibited at the national bank,
there are many richly decorated pal¬
aces of the Qajar period (often
converted into administrative build¬
ings), old mansions which give a vivid
idea of the life of that time, one of
the city gates now lying in a private
garden, and the immense bazaar.
Projects are being planned for them
all. The Golestan or Rose Garden
Palace, with its ornate halls and
collections of furniture, carpets and
objects of art, will be reorganized to
house a group of museums.
s ITES and monuments out¬
side Tehran, belonging to a number
of periods of Iranian history, call for
protection and repair. Among them
are the early Islamic monuments surviv¬
ing from the ancient city of Rey (or
Rhages), which was destroyed by the
Mongols, the Qajar bas-reliefs of
Cheshme AM (one of them above a
spring which is also famous for the
sight of the carpets laid out to dry
on the rocks after washing), a nearby
Sassanian fire temple, and the Mongol
shrines and tombs at Varamin.
Lovers of Isfahan which is the
third priority area say that it would
be worth a 4rip around the world even
if one saw'ilothing else along the way.
The riches of an Islamic civilization at
the height of its glory, preserved
almost intact, are displayed before
the visitor's eyes.
The monument here is the city itself:
none of its buildings can be consider¬
ed separately. The programme for

IRAN (Continued)
In the luxuriant valley of Darius and Xerxes
restorations and improvements is a
plan for Isfahan as a whole. Though
some 150 buildings (including 80 private
houses) are officially considered to be
of historical or artistic interest, the
others also play a role in determin¬
ing the appearance of the town. A
group of old houses clustered around
a mosque can, in a certain way, prac¬
tically form part of that monument.
The improvement of gardens, the
proper lighting of streets and build¬
ings are not to be separated from the
preservation work.
T

O read through a list of
the projects planned for Isfahan is to
make an exciting imaginary tour of the
city. The Royal Square of Shah
Abbas, one of the most beautiful
squares in the world, has on its four
sides the palace of the Safawid rulers
or Ali Qapu, the Shah Mosque, the
Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and the
monumental entrance to the bazaar;
two storeys of loggias complete the
rectangle. The urgently needed re¬
pairs and embellishments will restore
its full splendour to the whole.
Behind the Ali Qapu, the immense
Safawid gardens lead (though across
a few recent obstructions) to the
Forty Columns or Chehel Sotoun.
Nearby, the fifteenth-century Timurid
Palace and the Ashraf Hall, which
have been abandoned to administra¬
tive uses, will become museums and
will be reincorporated in the garden.
Similar improvements are called for in
another pavilion, some distance away,
the hexagonal Hasht Behesht. This
whole central part of Isfahan will thus
form one monumental ensemble.
The Juma Mosque, to the construc¬
tion of which every Islamic period has
contributed, will require considerable
work, as will the many buildings of
the bazaar and a number of other
mosques and minarets. The city's
private mansions of exceptional
interest will be bought (with their
valuable furnishings), or else their
owners will be assisted in preserving
them, and these buildings will be
made available to the public. The
general care and embellishment of the
city will be pursued rationally.
Certain private initiatives at Isfahan
lie outside the scope of the pro¬
gramme but will help it to achieve its
objectives. One of these is the gra¬
dual installation in a Safawid cara¬
vanserai of the luxurious Shah Abbas
Hotel. The decoration and furnishings
of this hotel seek to reproduce the
atmosphere of Isfahan's Golden Age.
The last of the four priority areas
is that of the province of Fars, the
original "Persia", whose capital is
Shiraz (the language of Iran is Farsi).
It is a city of Islamic poets; Saadi
and Hafiz, whose tombs are covered
by respectful modern mausoleums,
sang here of the joys of life. The
pleasant city in its fertile plain en¬
compassed by mountains is still
decorated with "gardens", that is,
rich villas surrounded by ornate
gardens. The palace has become a
post office, the citadel more graceful
than menacing a prison; there are
rich museums in old buildings, mos¬
ques and even churches with a per¬
sonality of their own, magnificent
private mansions. All these are to be
set to rights and made enjoyable
again for the many people who will
wish to see them.
But Shiraz is also the centre for
some of the most impressive excur¬
sions of the Middle East. Remains of
the most ancient Persian times are to
be found on all sides. For each of
these, the programme defines the
urgent steps to be taken.
At some distance to the northwest
of Shiraz, the deserted city of Pasar-
gades preserves the tomb of its
founder, the great Cyrus, as well as
fragments of his palaces, a citadel on
the hillside, a fire-temple in the wilder¬
ness.
Persepolis, on a high platform
against a mountain dominating a
luxuriant valley, was the capital of the
ancient Persian Empire: there reigned
Darius and Xerxes and Artaxerxes,
several of each name. No one who
has seen them will ever forget the
high pillars of Persepolis, its ceremon¬
ious and yet realistic, humoristic
friezes of courtiers and satraps, or
the play of light at different times of
day on the walls of its palaces.
The valley is a jungle of ancient
remains: the painted Sassanian sculp¬
tures of Naqsh-e-Rajab, now badly in
need of protection; the tomb of Cam-
byses, the still buried city of Istakhr,
the royal Achaemenian tombs of
Naqsh-e-Rostem, which are huge,
pillared shrines carved out of the side
of a cliff.
The other main excursion points
were the creation of the Sassanian
kings. The road to Firouzabad leads
through a long pass dominated by a
monument to be repaired: the Qalaeh-
ye-Dokhtar or "Castle of the Daugh¬
ter". At several levels of the cliff
beyond, bas-reliefs of which the
ancient Persians were fond depict
historic scenes, especially defeats of
Roman Emperors by Sassanian sov¬
ereigns. The city of Firouzabad is
still to be fully excavated, and much
of it is still preserved underground;
but the palace of the Great King
Ardeshir I is fully visible; it is on
the point of crumbling today, but it
is to be protected and cleared of its
rubble; the fountain will form a small
lake for the palace gardens.
To the west of Shiraz, and across
a difficult mountain range, the Sassa¬
nian king Shapur I founded, in the
third century of our era, the city of
Bishapur. This deserted capital is
still a vast underground rectangle, the
forms of whose buildings can be
guessed at. Only the palace and a
few shrines have been exposed. The
rest will gradually be brought to light.
On the hill above stands another ruin¬
ed castle; a narrow pass leads into
a hidden valley, marvellously fertile,
with some of the most striking hillside
bas-reliefs in Iran. In the upper part
of this valley is a cave the logical
conclusion of this excursion inside
of which lies a colossal statue of the
Great King.
A,LONGSIDEand apart
from its programme for the preserv¬
ation of monuments and the develop¬
ment of tourism, Iran wishes to launch
new archaeological excavations in Iran
on an international basis. The terrain
is so rich that the country will welcome
increasing international co-operation in
its endeavour to bring this concealed
heritage to light. It may be remember¬
ed that archaeological excavations are
often the first step in making historical
monuments available to the modern
world.
One more thing can be said by way
of a conclusion. Iran has today, like
many countries, reached . a turning
point in its history. The sovereign,
the government and the people of
Iran are dedicating all their efforts to
the arduous task of bringing this great
country into pace with modern times,
so that it may assume its rightful role
in the technological age. But Iran
intends to be fully modern without
banishing the riches of the past. On
the contrary, they must be better
studied, better known and appreciat¬
ed, and help to evolve the new Iran-
¡an civilization which, in turn, will
offer its contribution to the civilization
of the world.
