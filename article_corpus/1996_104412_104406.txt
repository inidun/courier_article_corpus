The old city of Fez
(Morocco) is one of
the most beautiful
quarters of its kind
in the world. It was
placed on Unesco's
World Heritage List
in 1980, and a few
years later Morocco
and Unesco
embarked on a far-
reaching safeguard
operation which is
now starting to
bear fruit.
Viewed from the high part of
the city, the medina of Fez
unfolds as a dense, undulating
expanse of little white houses
from which a number of more
imposing buildings emerge. To
visit the medina is to venture into
a labyrinth of alleys hustling
with activity, a realm of pedestri¬
ans, donkeys, commerce and
craftsmanship, whose ground-
plan has not changed for cen¬
turies. The stroller on the look¬
out for historical remains will
find many examples of fine archi¬
tecture madrasahs, mosques,
fountains amid the mass of
dwellings. The hand of the past
still makes an imprint on the
daily life of the community.
Founded in 808 A.D. (192 of
the Ilegira) by Idris II, Fez grew

up at the crossroads of communi¬
cation joining the Mediterranean
to black Africa and the eastern
Maghreb to the Atlantic. In the
ninth century the Andalusians
expelled from Cordoba by the
Ummayads settled on the right
bank of wadi Fez, and migrants
from Kairouan in Tunisia made
their homes on the left bank.
Fez-el-Bali came into being as a
result of the union of the two
communities in 1069.
Qarawiyin university, the
world's oldest, was founded in
Fez in 859 by a woman, Fatima el
Fihri al Kairouani. Celebrated
madrasahs (Qur'anic schools)
developed around it at the time
of the Marinids, the Berber
dynasty which established its
ride over Morocco during the thir
teenth-fifteenth centuries. The
city's intellectual, artistic and
religious influence soon reached
beyond North Africa. Students
came from all over the country,
but also from the Orient, Africa
and Spain to work under illustri¬
ous teachers. Among those who
studied in Fez were the historian
Ihn Khaldun, the mathematician
Ihn Al-Yasamin, the physician
Ihn Bushd (Averroës), and many
linguists.
An ambitious scheme
A centre of Islam, the city was
flourishing economically by the
end of the thirteenth century.
The Marinids made it their capi¬
tal and ordered Fez-el-Jed id, the
white city, to be built to the west
of Fez-el-Bali, the historic city.

In the following centuries, the
new city continued to expand and
welcomed an influx of new inhabi¬
tants, mainly of rural origin.
Under the French protec¬
torate (1912-1956), the medina
was neglected and priority was
given to developing a modern city.
In 1980 it was the home of over
60 per cent of the city's popula¬
tion and their economic activities.
But road access was inadequate,
and the district was slowly going
downhill. With its 143 mosques,
seven madrasahs and 61 monu¬
mental fountains, Fez was a
threatened masterpiece.
Then UlNICSCO placed Fez on
the World Heritage List. After
five years' study, Morocco and
UNESCO finalized plans for com¬
plete rehabilitation of the old

city, including its monuments,
dwellings, urban amenities
(roads, drainage, lighting, etc.)
and economic life. The project
really took off in 1989. After a
general feasibility study, the
Moroccan state set up Ader-Fès,
a body responsible for carrying
out and co-ordinating the rescue
programmes. Around fifty monu¬
ments the oldest and most sig¬
nificant from a historical or
architectural viewpoint are
involved. The estimated total
cost of rehabilitation is around
|600 million and the first
restoration work is being done
step by step, as donor commit¬
ments are received.
Ader-Fès is using the best
local craftsmen, the mââlem,
keepers of the city's traditional
skills, to reconstitute the original
architecture of the buildings
using time-honoured techniques.
It is also setting up a training
institute in traditional building
crafts and a rehabilitation and
restoration laboratory. On the
ground the work is proceeding
slowly, however. The streets of
the medina are so narrow that all
the materials have to be brought
in by donkeys. The general need
for protracted and meticulous
work is well illustrated by the
case of Mesbahiya madrasah, of
which only a few terraces and
ceilings and a handful of decora¬
tive elements have survived. The
foundations of the madrasah
have now been stabilized and the
next step is to reconstitute the
architectural details in all their
refinement.
A pragmatic approach
The cultural context also plays
an important role in the success
of this gigantic enterprise.
"People here do not venerate art
for art's sake", says Abdellatif el
Ilajjami, director-general of
Ader-Fès. "They attach more
importance to a hammam than to
a monument. If restoration is to
be accepted, a new social func¬
tion must be found for the monu¬
ments." This approach lies
behind the renovation of the
Najjarin funduk (which housed a
livestock market in the eigh¬
teenth century) and the nearby
carpenters' souk which has been
transformed into a woodwork
museum and will house a library
for specialists and a restoration
laboratory.
Restoration of the Observatory
Tower of the great Qarawiyin
mosque, built in 1348 and
destroyed by fire a few decades
ago, is being carried out in the
same spirit. When the work is fin¬
ished it will house an astrolabe
museum. Bou Inaniya madrasah,
which was built in 1356 by the
Marinid Sultan Abou Inan, is also
being renovated. A building of
outstanding decorative refine¬
ment, Bou Inaniya is a place of liv¬
ing memory (it is still a Friday
mosque). It contains the world's
oldest hydraulic clock.
One of the most recent safe¬
guard operations has focused on
Dar Adyel palace, built in seven¬
teenth-eighteenth century style.
This sumptuous dwelling is far
more spacious than other con¬
temporary buildings of its kind
and has original architectural
features. It belonged to the
Governor of Fez in the seven¬
teenth century and later became
the property of leading citizens
of Fez. When its structure has
been consolidated, its decorative
elements of carved or incised
plasterwork, its woodwork and
small coloured tiles known as zel-

lij will have to be reconstituted.
When restoration is complete,
Dar Adyel palace will, as in the
past, be the home of a conserva¬
tory of Andalusian music.
In all, a dozen historical mon¬
uments are currently being reha¬
bilitated, but equally critical
work is also being done on hous¬
ing, mains, and roads. The suc¬
cess of repairs to the drainage
system will largely hinge on the
transfer of the most polluting
activities tanneries, oilworks,
copperware factories to Ain
Nokbi, a new craftsmen's district
outside the medina which is
equipped to handle their wastes.
Before rehabilitation work
began, the medina had an over¬
population problem caused by
demographic growth and an influx
of population from the country¬
side. Deserted by the better-off,
the old city was caught in a down¬
ward spiral of poverty. There
were growing deficiencies in the
public services. This situation has
now been halted.
Emergency measures have
been taken on over 200 buildings
that were on the verge of col¬
lapse. Ader-Fès also intends to
renovate a number of dwellings
of historic value (there are over
10,000 of these in the medina
out of a total 13,385 buildings)
With help from' the municipality
and the people concerned. It has
carried out a massive computer¬
ized survey in which the address,
architectural type, cultural
value, number of households and
physical condition of each build¬
ing is recorded.
The thorny problem of roads
and streets remains to be solved.
There was some support for a
plan for a road through the med¬
ina, but the proposal had a hos¬
tile reception internationally.
Today the idea is to make two or
three inroads, each a few hun¬
dred metres long, so that the old
city will become more accessible
to emergency services and its
business premises will be less iso¬
lated. Although rehabilitation
operations are still far from com¬
plete, the medina has already
recovered some of its unique
radiance and charm. M
