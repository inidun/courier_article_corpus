PAGODA (Cont/nuec/;
OFFERINGS
THAT BURN
FOR MONTHS
In more than a score of
pagodas of Saigon's "China¬
town ", people of Chinese birth
or ancestry honour divinities
on whose protection and good¬
will they count. People who
trace their origins back to
Canton on the South China
coast have a particular guard¬
ian to watch over thema
goddess of the sea who is
sometimes called "The Good
Mother" and sometimes, "The
Celestial Empress".
Chinese of other religious
beliefs also frequent the pagoda
of the people of Canton in
Saigon and Buddhists celebrate
their most important festivals
there. But the chief deity of
the pagoda is the protectress
of fishermen, travellers and
sailors, who is said to have
been born more than a thous¬
and years ago. Many stories
are told of her appearance in
the midst of tempests to save
mariners from certain death.

In the courtyard of the
pagoda are huge braziers. In
these, people solemnly burn
paper money and paper clo¬
thes during the three days of
anniversary celebrations for the
goddess, thus assuring cloth¬
ing and money for the Good
Mother for the next twelve
months. In return they hope
to receive her gratitude and
protection.
Throughout the year people
come to the pagoda to burn
joss-sticks and, on the assump¬
tion that the more they offer,
the greater will be their re
ward, wealthy Chinese bu
huge spirals of incense which
are then hung from the roof
where they smoulder away
slowly for months. Copyright J. D. Lajoi

AKING A SUPER JOSS-STICK
The tremendously long coils suspended from the roof
of the pagoda are a mixture of clay and incense. To con¬
struct them, workers begin by coiling the paste on a
wicker tray, first placed on the ground and later,
when the centre of the coil is finished, on trestles. Fi¬
nally the coils are sewn together (Below, right).
When dry the coil is stretched and placed on frame.
Some of these "super joss-sticks" burn for months.
