Love is made in heaven,but for many people,
marriages are arranged on Earth. For ultra-
orthodox Jews, marriages are made between
families as much as between individuals, on the
basis of mutual interests.“Intelligence and scho-
larship are highly va l u e d , n a t u r a l l y, but back-
g r o u n d , social position,wealth and health are also
i m p o r t a n t ,” says Israeli rabbi Yigal Bezalel Sha-
fran.
Families known to be genetic carriers of fatal
diseases are stigmatized,because in this strictly
o b s e r vant community abortion is generally for-
bidden unless the mother’s life is endangered.Ye t
A s h kenazi Jews (of Eastern European origin) have
the highest risk of Ta y - S a c h s, a genetic disease
causing dementia and death in childhood.The risk
of carrying the disease can run as high as four per
cent for the A s h kenazi (one in 25) compared to
0.2 per cent for non-Jews and Sephardic Jews (of
Mediterranean origin).
In 1983 a rabbi and a doctor in New York crea-
ted Dor Ye s h o r i m , a non-profit organization which
provides A s h kenazi with pre-marital genetic tests
to avoid the betrothal of two carriers of a fatal or
severely debilitating genetic disorder. A b o u t
70,000 people in New York,Israel and the United
Kingdom have been tested for Tay-Sachs and
other genetic diseases like cystic fib r o s i s. The pro-
gramme started in Israel in 1986,and since then
not a single Tay-Sachs child has been born in the
ultra-orthodox A s h kenazi community. It works
because both the spiritual leaders and the com-
munity agree with its principles, practices and
results.
Yet some medical geneticists oppose the pro-
gramme on the grounds that it snubs We s t e r n
m e d i c i n e ’s standard of privacy and the individual’s
“right to know” because the test results are retur-
ned to the “more objective and less emotionally
i n v o l v e d ” Dor Yeshorim rabbi,and not to the indi-
viduals tested.The prospective couple is informed
only if both members are carriers, in which case
they usually seek other partners. If just one of the
pair is a carrier, no one is told and the marriage
plans proceed.
There may be a lesson here for other cultures
and even for Western science. As genetic scree-
ning tests are increasingly ava i l a b l e, mostly for
diseases with no cure, people may have to bear
what Rabbi Shafran calls “an emotional burden of
knowledge that can only cause distress”.This bur-
den might be eased if the right to knowledge is
vested in their social group, in other words, if indi-
viduals choose the “right not to know”. n
