DURING THE past year, nearly$ 900, 000 worth of new books
have reached the shelves of
war-damaged and depleted libra-
ries in twenty-thee countries
under the programme operated by
CARE (Cooperative for American
Remittances to Europe and Asia)
at the instigation and with the
co-operation of Unesco.
These books, providing the
latest available information for
technical studies on such subjects
as applied science, medicine,
forestry, pedagogy and many
others, were the gift of profession-
al groups, colleges, research
councils, women's organizations
and private individuals in the
United States.
Purchases were made by CARE
on the basisi of lists supplied by
Unesco, reflecting the greatest
needs of libraries in all parts of
the world. Help was also given by
publishers who offered discounts
to cover the cost of packing and
export, and from customs authori-
ties who waived duties on the
cases of books.
In addition, arrangements were
made for 60, 000 volumes of new
and used books and periodicals not
