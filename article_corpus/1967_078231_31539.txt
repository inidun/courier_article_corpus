NEW HORIZONS IN MOSCOW
Moscow, capital of the U.S.S.R., is a swiftly growing metropolis.
Greater Moscow counts some five million inhabitants and in the
built-up areas that have risen along the main highways from
the city, live three million more. New plans for urban
development aim to link up these suburban population centres
and to create a number of modern cities on the outskirts
of Moscow. Right, architectural model of one of these cities,
now under construction. Its designers give high priority to
the need for greenery and open spaces. Above,
"master architects" of the new Moscow: Mikhail Posokhin
(on left) is Minister of Urban Development in the U.S.S.R. and
President of the Government Commission for Construction
and Architecture. He was the chief designer of the Palace of
the Congresses built within the Kremlin in 1961 (see page 26). With
him is Mikhail Perchine, Chief Architect for Urban Development
Planning. Below, model of a new development area, today
completed, along the length of the Leningrad Prospect main
highway from the city to the Sheremetyevo International Airport.


NEW HORIZONS
IN MOSCOW (cc(Continued)
Below, scale models of buildings on
this architectural layout of central
Moscow reveal outlines of the new
metropolis now rising under a master
plan for the Soviet capital's development
up to 1980. New Moscow landmarks
on model are multi-story buildings
on the Kalinin Prospect (1) and
Moscow's latest and largest hotel,
the Rossiya (2). Between them is
triangular-shaped outline of city's oldest
landmark, the Kremlin, its southern
wall rising above a bend in the Moskva
River. Bottom centre, another model
reveals in greater detail the buildings
on the Kalinin Prospect. Photo right
(taken in August 1967) shows them
nearing completion on the newly
widened and extended thoroughfare.
Bottom right, another project now
achieved the Rossiya Hotel. Located
next to Red Square and facing the
Moskva River (in foreground) it
accomodates 6,000 guests.

NEW FORMS
& MATERIALS
Soviet architecture today
is characterized by a
use of bold designs in
which modern
forms and functional
needs are kept in
mind. Architects use
marble, ceramics, wood
and other traditional
building materials In
conjunction with more
modem elements such as
concrete, glass and
aluminium. Top left,
entrance hall of the Palace
of Congresses in the
Kremlin. Its chief
architect, Mikhail Posokhin
(see page 22) was
awarded the Lenin Prize.
Top right, winged
silhouette of "The Dove",
a terrace cafe
in Baku, capital of the
Azerbaijan Republic. Left,
distinctive semi-circular
arches in one of Moscow's
underground stations.
Right, Palace of Sports In
Minsk, capital of the
Byelorussian Republic,
can seat 6,000 spectators.
Destroyed during the
Second World War, Minsk
has been completely
rebuilt in a modern style.
