H ERITAGE
olonia del Sacramento
remembers its turbulent past
by Edouard Bailby
Colonial monuments with an eventful history grace the old
quarter of the Uruguayan port of Colonia
The Street of Sighs
( Calle de los
Suspiros), with the
swirling waters of
the Río de la Plata in
the background.
The Río de la Plata estuary,
which is 280 km wide at its
mouth, sticks like a wedge into the
continent of South America
between Argentina and Uruguay.
Well inland, where the Paraná and
Uruguay Rivers meet, its two banks
are still 50 km apart. It is there, on
a peninsula at Uruguay's southern¬
most tip, on the edge of the pam¬
pas, that Colonia del Sacramento
was founded in 1680. This small
town was spawned by rivalries
between two colonial powers, Spain
and Portugal, and its turbulent past
is reflected in its unusual blend of
two architectural styles. It was on
those grounds that the site was put
on UNESCO's World heritage List in
December 1995.
Present-day Colonia del Sacra¬
mento, which is visited by tens of
thousands of tourists every year, is a
sleepy town untouched by the hurly-
burly of modern life. From its upper
district, it is possible at night to see
the twinkling lights of Buenos Aires,
the town from which, in 1680, the
first Spanish expedition set out to
take Colonia del Sacramento, then a
Portuguese stronghold.
A coveted prize
For almost a century the Por¬
tuguese and Spanish fought for con¬
trol of the Río de la Plata, which
was of strategic importance. It was
through that estuary, after a voy¬
age of several thousand kilometres
along the Paraná and Uruguay
Rivers, that precious stones and
hides from Bolivia, as well as pre¬
cious metals from Peru, passed on
their way to Europe. It was through
that same channel, butin the other
direction, that the Spanish and Por¬
tuguese transported and often
smuggled goods to the heart of
the continent.
It is generally agreed that the
first Spanish navigator to have
entered the Rio dc la Plata was Juan
Díaz de Solis in 1516. Later on,
Spanish, English, French and Dutch
privateers and pirates ventured into
the estuary and unloaded cattle on
to unknown land, hoping they would
quickly proliferate and become a
source of trade. But there were soon
clashes with the Portuguese, who
were seeking to extend their terri¬
tory to the south of Brazil. In 1680,
the Prince Regent of Portugal, Don
Pedro, ordered Colonia del Sacra¬
mento to be founded.
But the Spanish were in no mood
to accept that, and the same year
the newly-founded town fell into
their hands, despite the heroism of
Joana Galväo: after the death of
her husband, who had been given
the task of defending the fortress,
she took over command of his
troops. Colonia del Sacramento

later changed hands several times as
a result of treaties or battles, and
was destroyed and rebuilt almost
as many times. It was not until the
first half of the eighteenth century
that Colonia enjoyed twenty-seven
years of uninterrupted rule by a sin¬
gle Portuguese governor, Antonio
Pedro de Vasconcelos. During that
time (1722-1749), the town was
graced with many fine examples of
civilian and military architecture
(the surviving examples of which
can be admired today). It also
reached its cultural and commer¬
cial zenith, and boasted twice as
many inhabitants as Montevideo,
which was founded by the Spanish
in about 1726.
'Don't let's tamper with the past'
In the early 1960s a small group of
Uruguayan history enthusiasts man¬
aged to persuade the government
and the town council to come up
with the financial and material
resources needed to preserve Colo¬
nia 's old quarter. Some house-own¬
ers agreed to sell their homes and
restoration work started.
In January 1991, a team of
archaeologists identified the pre¬
cise location of governor Vasconce-
los's palace. The discovery and sub¬
sequent work on the site resulted in
Uruguay's first laboratory of his¬
torical archaeology being set up in
Montevideo. Nelsys Fusco Zambe-
togliris, an anthropologist and
archaeologist at the National Her¬
itage Department, is opposed to any
plans for reconstruction. "Let's
keep the old stones just as they
are," she says, "and don't let's tam¬
per with the past, except to show it
to good advantage."
The historic quarter, which is
sandwiched between the remains of
the ramparts and the modern city,
covers the area of the former Por¬
tuguese town of Nova Colonia do
Santissimo Sacramento. It contains
almost 16 hectares of buildings in a
great diversity of styles. Its layout
is unusual. Unlike many other Span¬
ish and Portuguese colonial towns,
which were built on a grid pattern,
this stronghold was given a jigsaw-
puzzle design, partly because of the
site's topography, and partly to act
asa windbreak the Río de la Plata
is subject to fierce gales.
Plaza Mayor, which was adorned
with five royal palms and two cedars
at the beginning of this century,
gives on to the Río de la Plata. With
its public gardens and lovingly pre¬
served eighteenth-century man¬
sions, it has retained some of its
erstwhile bucolic charm. No. 180,
a modest building with thick stone
walls, houses the Portuguese
Museum. Its azulejos (enamelled
tiles), furniture made of Jacaranda
(a precious South American wood),
clothes and kitchen utensils stand
as a reminder that Colonia del
Sacramento long had connections
with the Portuguese crown. A
stone's throw away, a small street
called Calle de los Suspiros (Street
of Sighs) runs gently down to the
estuary. It has a central gutter that
drains rainwater off its uneven cob¬
bles, and is lined with early eigh¬
teenth-century peasant houses. Less
centrally located is the Spanish
Museum, the home of exhibits and
documents relating to the Spanish
presence in the town.
Probably the most interesting of
Colonia's seven museums is the
Municipal Museum, once the resi¬
dence of the Irish Admiral William
Brown, who played a heroic role in
Uruguay's independence. It offers

the most comprehensive collection
of exhibits connected with the town's
history. On top of 50,000-odd docu¬
ments in Spanish and Portuguese and
wide-ranging collections of colonial
furniture, cannon-balls and stuffed
animals, there are a number of uten¬
sils and weapons used by Charrúa
Indians, the former hunter-gather¬
ers of the region who were massacred
and dispersed by colonization.
The governor's palace
The Church of the Most Holy Sacra¬
ment (Iglesia Matriz del Santísimo
Sacramento) is Uruguay's oldest
church. It has been partly destroyed
several times since its foundation in
the late seventeenth century. The
greatest damage was caused in 1823
when the sacristy, which was being
used as an explosives depot, blew
up. Despite restoration work, the
building has since, lost its original
architectural unity. The nave does
however contain some admirable
works of art, including a sixteenth-
century altar-piece, a seventeenth-
century painting of the Holy Family
and a sculpture of St. Francis of
Assisi made out of Paraguayan caoba
wood. The only elements of the orig¬
inal church that have survived are
its pillars, which date from 1695.
It is between this church and
Plaza Mayor that archaeologists
have succeeded in pinpointing the
site of the palace of the Portuguese
governor Vasconcelos. Nothing
remains of the building itself, but
by collating several ground-plans
dating from the colonial period it
is possible to delimit its outer walls
and reconstitute at ground level the
layout of each wall and partition
over a surface of 1,000 sq. m.
Despite extensive research and
excavations, the turbulent past of
Colonia del Sacramento's old town
has not by any means yielded all its
secrets, and much remains for
archaeologists yet to discover. I
