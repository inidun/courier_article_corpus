Snovym godom's novym scast'em"
(With the New Year new happi¬
ness), say the Russians as they
kiss one another on New Year's Eve
once called the Vasili vecer (Saint-Bas¬
il's night) or the Melanka (Saint Mel-
ania's night). What was the "new
happiness" that they wished one an¬
other "with the New Year ?"
In early times the Slav peoples did
not bother much about astronomy or
the exact computation of time ; as
peasant farmers, their calendar de¬
pended primarily on the cycle of plant
growth. Whether the year began in
winter or in spring, they wanted it to
bring rich harvests. And, on Saint
Basil's night, they would try to divine
whether or not the season would be
"scedraja" (generous) to them.
In White Russia, two young men were
taken round from house to house, one
richly clad and wearing a crown of rye,
and the other in rags with a crown of
straw. Their garb was concealed un¬
der voluminous coverings and the head
of every household had to try and guess
which was which ; if he chose the
former, prosperity awaited him, but if
the latter, poverty and death.
The first of January was not origi¬
nally a true traditional holiday in any
of the Slav countries. The ceremonies
connected with it were of an official
character and principally associated
with the towns. In olden times, the
Russian Tsars used to set out with
great pomp to "meet" the New Year on
the Kremlin Square on the first of
September. This was when the civil
year began, while the ecclesiastical year
commenced on the first of March. In
1505, it was decided that the same date
should be fixed for both and until the
eighteenth century that date was the
first of September.
But in the year 7203 since the crea¬
tion of the world (i.e. 1699), Peter the
Great decided that the first of January
should be the beginning of the year,
and the people were required by order
to hold rejoicings on that day, to
exchange good wishes, and to decorate
houses with pine, fir and juniper.
The peasants, for their part, were in
the habit of greeting the New Year in
March, with the spring. Ovsen, a word
which may be derived either from oves
(oats) or from vesna (spring), personi¬
fied the New Year. An old song tells
us that he came in on a bridge built
by the boyars from planks of pine-wood
cut in the forest. "Ovsen and the New
Year will pass that way." After 1699
Ovsen had to change the time of his
coming, and the people went out to
meet him on Saint Basil's day (Jan. 1).
The winter festival took the place of
the spring festival, but was fitted into
the extremely complex cycle of the
winter solstice and Christian rites.
The birth of Christ, of the sun and of
the year merged together. The
Church, being unable to abolish the
pagan festivals, took them over and
gave them countenance by transferring
the date of the birth of Christ from
January 6 to December 25, so that it
coincided with the winter solstice.
Each pagan rite was given a Christian
significance. The straw scattered on
the ground in fertility rites became the
straw of the manger ; the miraculous
water became the water of the Kresce-
nie or Baptism of Christ (Epiphany) ;
the grains with which the Polish peas¬
ants pelted one another for luck on
St. Stephen's day (December 26) came
to symboKze the stones which had been
cast at the martyr.
God and the Saints took the place
of the pagan divinities. The prophet
Elijah, who was held in great honour
in Russia, ousted Perun, the god of
thunder. His feast-day fell in the
summer but he also came on Saint
Basil's day to fertilize the earth : "He
holds whips of wire and tin. He shakes
them here and there. The grain springs
up". The old pagan cycle of
twelve days fitted in between (Cont'd on

Night of

Krescenie (the Baptism of Christ).
It is a critical period. Will the sun
and the seasons, having run their
course, resume it again ? It is a time
of preparation and decision for the
coming year, and the twelve days are
the twelve months in miniature. The
Poles foretell the weather for the
twelve coming months by the weather
in- the last twelve days of the year.
Supernatural events are possible at
this time: animals may speak, trees
may suddenly bear fruit, and some¬
times golden fruit, the heavens may
open, water may cure infirmities
whence the custom of drawing water
from holes cut in the ice to wash and
to sprinkle over the cattle and even, in
some cases, of bathing in the streams
and immersing the children. The
Church took over this rite as a com¬
memoration of the Baptism of Christ
and made it a solemn ceremony, at
which the Tsar was present on the
banks of the Neva.
This period of twelve days' and, above
all, of twelve "holy" nights is also one
of the times at which the dead return
to earth; places are set for them at
table and they are offered their portion
of the New Year feast. God and His
Saints come down to earth and walk
among men to see how they are living.
Three hairs from a cat
But evil spirits, sorcerers and wolves
may also appear, chiefly on the
last night of the year, "the night
of terror". On that night, as the Sibe¬
rian Russians believe, the "force of
evil" is let loose upon the face of the
earth and men and beasts must stay
within shelter, under the protection of
the sign of the Cross, drawn in soot
upon the door. These perils of the
New Year continue until Epiphany.
At Christmas or on the first of Janu¬
ary, according to the locality, the
evil spirits are driven out by firing
guns, beating out every nook and
cranny with sticks, and with loud
shouting. On Christmas night, the
Slovaks pull out three hairs from a cat,
dip them in holy water and burn them,
so as to put the evil spirits to flight.
The very name of the evil spirit is sig¬
nificant: Karacun, or Korocun, mean¬
ing "the end", symbolizing the death of
the year and the baneful force which
must be driven out.
The name of the koleda or koljada,
found in all the Slav countries and
elsewhere, is derived from the Latin
calendae. The Roman New Year was
celebrated at the calends of January,
and the Slavs have kept the word to
designate the turn of the sun, the turn
of the year, and the festival, the songs,
the girl or the dummy figure personify¬
ing that critical period.
Some students of folklore have mis¬
taken this allegory for the representa¬
tion of an old god. Koleda, however,
is no more a goddess than Ovsen or
Karacun are gods, but stands on the
same footing as the Lady Maslenica
(from maslo, meaning butter), who re¬
presents Carnival, or Marena, the fig¬
ure symbolizing the death of Winter
which is cast into the water in Spring.
Princess 'Buckwheat'
These are merely examples of the
popular tendency to personify
even the simplest things; there
are likewise festivities in honour of the
Grain, and in praise of the Princess
Kasa (buckwheat meal), while Pluga,
the plough, is often invoked at the end
of the year as a being in whom great
hopes are placed, the prime architect
of future harvests. "The gilded plough
is turning the soil and behind it walks
the Lord himself. Saint Peter helps
him to guide it and the Mother of God
bears the grain."
A plough is often taken round the
village with the singers of the koljada,
who go in gay procession by night from
house to house, sometimes wearing
masks and disguised as animals espe¬
cially as goats, which probably repre¬
sent the spirit of the wheat, and these
masquerades foreshadow the Carnival.
The singers extol the virtues of each
family and wish all a prosperous year.
Magic rites are performed during
this holy time. Ploughing and sowing
are mimed to encourage the growth of
the plants. The scattering of grain
and money, symbolizing abundance,
brings luck. The trees in the orchards
are wrapped round with the straw
which has been strewn over the floors
of the houses and are shaken, caressed
and threatened, "Will you bear fruit
or not?" they are asked, and one
member of the family makes promises
on behalf of the tree. Among the Serbs
and the Poles, in particular, the far¬
mers' wives scatter straw through the
house, imitating the
sounds made by the
domestic animals, while
the children, under the
table, repeat "cluck-
cluck, quack - quack,
cackle-cackle, moo-moo
a hundred chickens,
ducks, geese and cows!"
The new fire rite, con¬
nected with the begin¬
ning of the year or the
return of the sun, took
place at the solstice or
on New Year's Day, and
the yule log common
among various Slav peo¬
ples is a survival of it.
The ceremonies connected with the
badniak (the Serbian yule log) show
that it also represents a New Year rite.
The "Christmas visitor" strikes the log,
wishing his hosts "as much cattle, as
many horses, sheep, pigs, and hives full
of honey, with as much good fortune,
prosperity, success and happiness as the
sparks that fly out."
The meals at these festivals must be
ample: the richer and more plentiful
the dishes the more prosperous will be
the year.
Both the menu and the order in
which the dishes are served are impor¬
tant. The number of dishes may vary
but, in Poland, must always be uneven,
and every type of produce, from farm,
field, kitchen-garden, orchard, forest
and river, must be included to ensure
that there shall be no lack in the
coming year.
As the feast proceeds, the guests do

not, in the midst of their gaiety, forget
to take precautions for the future.
When eating peas, the Poles pull out a
hair, saying: "Peas, twine around the
stake!" When cabbage is served, they
strike their heads with their spoons,
repeating "Form a good head, cabbage,
form a good head!" Millet is bidden
to "Form heavy ears and grow well!"
The scraps left over are kept and
planted, in the kitchen-garden, in the
spring.
Thus, everything is important; every
gesture is significant and has an effect
on the future. The fortune of the New
Year is determined during this critical
period that ushers it in and represents,
in some sort, the dress rehearsal for
the performance to come.
