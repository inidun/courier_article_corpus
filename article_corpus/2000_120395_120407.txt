Ousséini Ouédraogo, f o rt y - s o m e t h i n g, looks like
a lumberjack.He has the moral strength of one,
t o o.Ouédraogo coordinates the programmes of
the National Fe d e r ation of Fa rm e rs ’ O r g a n i z at i o n s
(FE N O P) , a group that was set up in 1996 and boasts
1 9 7 u n i o n s , 500 grassroots associations and some
400,000 members in eve ry corner of Burkina Fa s o.
O u é d r a o g o,an agronomist who descends from Pri n-
cess Yennenga—the ancestor of the Mossé, B u r k i n a
Fa s o ’s main ethnic group—is fighting for the fa rm e rs in
his country, where nearly 80 per cent of the populat i o n
l i ves off the land.Almost non-existent fa rm mechaniza-
t i o n ,i l l i t e r a cy and low yields mean they are barely able
to eke out an existence.And ye t , the country owes them
e ve ry t h i n g . C o t t o n , Burkina Fa s o ’s pri m a ry source of
foreign curr e n cy, accounted for two-thirds of export
e a rnings in 1998, or over 1.2 billion French francs

($171.4 million). Breeding accounted for 15 per cent of
e x p o rts ($38.5 million) the same ye a r.
“ For us, fa rm e rs are full-fledged citizens,” s ays Oué-
d r a o g o.“They are entitled to respect.We are working to
i m p r ove their status and to defend their interests.We ’r e
a lways there wherever and whenever one of our mem-
b e rs needs us.”The FE N O P fought its first battle against
an “ i n t e rnal enemy.” In 1997, the organization clashed
with the Textile Fibre Company (SO F I T E X) , which ru l e s
the cotton industry and has a monopoly on input and
s a l e s. Cotton was in cri s i s. A black veil covered the
“white gold.”Cotton fields were ove rrun by cat e rp i l l a rs ,
and the pesticides supplied by a SO F I T E X s u b s i d i a ry
were ineffective . Some fa rm e rs left the country, o t h e rs
committed suicide. G r owe rs who went into debt up to
their necks at the start of each agricultural season felt as
if they had a knife to their throat s.


Banana b l u e s

A farmers’ group in Burkina Faso gains clout in its battle against the liberalization of
a g r i c u l t u re, and turns to the global movement for support
◗ Journalist with the Jade agency

Appealing to popular opinion, Ouédraogo and his
o r g a n i z ation asked a pri vate newspaper, Le Pay s, to see
for itself. SO F I T E X c o u n t e r - attacked by staging a pro-
paganda tour of a cotton-gr owing region for other news-
p a p e rs.T h at is when the FE N O P r e c e i ved unexpected
s u p p o rt from L’ I n d é p e n d a n t, directed by the fa m o u s
i nve s t i g at i ve journalist Norbert Zongo, who was assas-
s i n ated on December 13, 1 9 9 8 .Protests swelled and the
g ove rnment had to calm things dow n : it wiped out all the
debts that fa rm e rs had contracted to purchase the pes-
t i c i d e s. This was the first time in any fa rm e r ’s living
m e m o ry that the State backed down in the face of
a n gry protests.
The FE N O P is proud of that victory, but it had to keep
on fig h t i n g, this time on the broader front of fa rm
i n d u s t ry liberalizat i o n . In the 1980s,s t ructural adjustment
policies had dealt severe blows to fa rm aid such as sub-
sidized fert i l i z e rs and training. M o r e ove r ,l ower import
duties helped to increase competition between nat i o n a l
and foreign products on the domestic market. I n t e r g o-
ve rnmental accords signed in Ja n u a ry 2000 in the fra-
m e work of West A f ri c a ’s regional integr ation policy only
f u rthered the trend towards lower customs barri e rs.
A n d , as usual, nobody asked small fa rm e rs what they
t h o u g h t .
In this context, the FE N O P s t a rted two bat t l e s ,
o n e against bananas from Côte d’Ivo i r e , the other
against rice from A s i a , both symbols of trade liberaliza-
t i o n . But the struggle against bananas from Côte d'Ivo i r e
seems futile. E ven though they do not taste as good as
Burkina Fa s o ’s smaller fru i t , they look better and cost
l e s s. G r own on large, m o d e rn plantat i o n s , they also
b e n e fit from better agricultural conditions and a more
clement climat e .
The battle against Asian ri c e , which is gr a d u a l l y
replacing local gr a i n s , seems off to a better start bu t
depends on untangling a web of corru p t i o n .“ We have
conducted an inve s t i g at i o n ,” s ays Ouédraogo,“to show
t h at a ton of that rice costs 25 per cent less on the
market at Ouagadougou than it would if the import e rs
paid all the duties.”He adds that Burkina Fa s o ’s rice “ i s
of better quality because it comes from recent harve s t s ,
while the imported rice is sometimes seven to 10 ye a rs
o l d .And there is not a shadow of a doubt that chemical
p r e s e rvat i ves had to be added to keep it from spoiling.
But many consumers are unaware of all that .”
Winning market shares
without selling out
According to its leaders , the FE N O P is fighting so that
p r o d u c e rs are no longer left out of the global economy
and can win positions on future markets.The group goes
out into the field to inform and train fa rm e rs , while pro-
ducing films for national television about promising
c r o p s , such as oil seeds, shea and sesame. For example,
few fa rm e rs know that sesame brought in some $4.2 mil-
lion two ye a rs ago.T h at tidy sum was harvested because
of the quality of Burkina Fa s o ’s crop, gr own without fer-
t i l i z e rs (because fa rm e rs cannot afford them) at a time
when organic products are becoming increasingly
popular in Europe and A s i a .
So opening up borders sometimes has positive
e f f e c t s. But Burkina Fa s o ’s fa rm e rs must be careful not
to sell their souls to the devil. “ T h at is also what we
d e f e n d . A kind of citizenship agri c u l t u r e ,” s ays Oué-
d r a o g o.“Like José Bové in France. In September 1999,
we even adopted a motion of support for the impri s o n e d
French fa rm e r.”Faced with a gove rnment that is seeking
to divide and denigr ate the fa rm e rs ’ m ove m e n t , t h e
FE N O P k n ows it needs allies. At the beginning of July
2 0 0 0 , the group helped to set up a regional organizat i o n
of West A f rican fa rm e rs ’ m ovements and maintains
contacts with Via Campesina, a worldwide move m e n t
to support fa rm e rs ’ cultures and stru g g l e s.The Sahel and
M c D o n a l d ’s may not be at war ye t , but fa rm e rs ’o r g a-
n i z ations are gearing up for the fray. ■

The country’s “white gold” has plunged many farmers into debt.
