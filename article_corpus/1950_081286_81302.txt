PURPOSE and SCOPE
of ART FILMS
TODAY the cinema isbringing art within
easy reach of millions
of people in much the same
way that radio has
for music. Films on art are
not a new innovation, but
until about ten years ago
most of them were of the
documentary type intended
to'''cultivate''the spec-
tator.
Then, producers in a num-
ber of countries, especially
those in Belgium and Italy
began to use new techniques
which enabled even people
without an expert knowledge
of art to"look inside"the
art being filmed where before
they had only looked at it
mechanically.
Evidence of the rapid and
widely international deve-
lopment of such techniques
was given two years ago when
many of these new art films
were screened at the first In-
ternational Congress of Art
Films in Paris.
Even greater progress has
been made in the last two
years, and when a Second In-
ternational Congress met in
Brussels a few weeks ago, its
delegates-producers, art
historians, critics and museum
curators-were able to see
and judge over 40 films pro-
duced since 1948.
To serve or use art
ONE cf the most important
tasks of the recent
Brussels Congress was to
define the scope and purpose
of films on art. Some
delegates maintained that
films should serve the cause
of art by strictly didactic
means ; others argued that it
was quite permissible for
producers to give a personal
interpretation of art to use it
to serve new ends.
Most art films produced to
date have dealt with painting,
sculpture and engraving-in
short, the visual arts. The
Congress agreed, however,
that there was no reason why
the scope of films on art
should not be extended to in-
clude music, dancing or even
poetry. This was reflected in
the final definition of art films
which the Congress declared
were those"contributing to
the knowledge, study or disse-
mination of all branches of
art".
Firstly, there are films which
contribute to a knowledge
of art such as documentary
films for the general pu-
blic ; for example the French
film"Cesaree"showing the
remains of a Roman city in
North Africa.
Then there are those which
assist the study of art and
which may be linked with art
history or criticism. An excel-
lent example of this group is
the Belgian aim"Rubens"
made by Paul Haesaerts and
Henri Storck.
Finally, there are those
films whose function is to
disseminate art, and this ca-
tegory includes all films
which, while based on a work
of art, give a free, imaginative
interpretation of it. In"L'Evan-
gile de la Pierre", for example,
Andr6 Bureau relates the life
of Christ through the medium
of sculptures in different ca-
thedrals.
Films, however, should not
One of the most important
results of the Brussels Con-
gress was the setting up of
the Council of the Internatio-
nal Federation of Art Films
This Council was asked to
consider, in consultation with
the International Federation
of Film Archives, the setting-
up of a central reference film
library. It was also asked to
study means of promoting the
production, sale and distribu-
tion of art films.
Between their meetings.
delegates to the Congress
were shown films from 15
countries. The following short
descriptions of some of these
give an idea of the wide field
covered by producers of art
films.
Sagas in stone

British film,"THE APOCALYPSE OR THE

treatment from which he emerged unscathed.

"Saga in Stone" (In-
dia) presents a splendid
gallery of sculptures.
Although the film might
be criticized on the
grounds of technical de-
fects, the material treat-
ed is so rich that such
drawbacks can be readily
overlooked.

Temptation
through fear
The"diabolic figures"or Brue-ghel, Bosch, Grunewald and
others are depicted by Carlo
Castelli Gattlnara and Enrico Ful-
chlgnonl in their'''Demoniaeo
neU'Arte" (Italy), the leit-motiv
of which IS Temptation through
Fear.
Dekenkeleire's"Les Metiers
d'Art de Flandre et de WaUo-
nie" (Belgium) depicting the
achievements of art craftsmen, Is
a glorification of work as the
maker of beauty. The beginning
and end of the film are in geva-
colour and throw valuable light
on this new colour process.
Poland has produced a highly
interesting documentary on the
ancient lake city of.'Blskupin",
where relics of the bronze age
have been discovered. The pro-
ducer, Stefanowski, may be con-
gratulated on a flawless piece of
work.

the United States, Is a sensitive

Such films showed that produ-
cers are seriously facing their
two-fold task of providing an
Instrument for research and a
means of spreading culture.

A film which has already met
with much success is"Le Para-
dis Perdu" (Italy) in which Lu-
ciano Emmer reproduces the
many fascinating details of Hie-
ronymus Bosch's famous painting
"The Garden of Delights".
