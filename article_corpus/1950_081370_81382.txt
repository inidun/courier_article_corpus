LATIN AMERMAN SCIENCE MBSEBM
Montevideo's'Science and Modern Man"Museum is to be installed in the city's magnificent Palacio Muni-
cipal (City Hall). Intended as a centre for the popularization of science in Uruguay, the museum will behoused in the wing shown on the right of the architect's drawing (above).
MONTEVIDEO, capital city of Uruguay, already notedfor its great modern hospital nd its schools of
engineering and architecture, is soon to have one
of the most modern science museums in Latin America.
With the general theme of"Science and Modern Man",
this new museum, to be housed in the magnificent Palacio
Municipal, will be the country's centre for the populariza-
tion of science.
The idea for this modern museum of science was
conceived in talks between members of Montevideo's
Municipal Commission of Culture and Dr. A. Establier,
Head of Unesco's Field Science Office for Latin America.
Through Unesco's Division for the Popularization of
Science, technical assistance was given on all aspects of
planning. Mr W. Stephen Thomas, Director of the
Rochester Museum of Natural History, at the request of
Unesco, acted as consultant.

One important reason for
spreading the scientific way
of thinking in the modern
world is to ensure a rational
approach to social problems.
A science museum is an
instrument whereby this
kind of general knowledge
about science can be diffu-
sed.
See and Understand
MR. STEPHEN THOMAS, Wri-ting about the impor-
tance of such institu-
tions, said : *'Museums are
not merely p I ace s for
preservation of-specimens,
and thus static and inert, they
o : re active and alive. They
exhibit material in an attrac-
tive and lively manner, and
at the same time carry or
extensive educational pro-
grammes.
"Because such museums
teach through visual edu-
cation-use of objects in
three dimensions-they can
reach an classes of people
However, the important thing
is that the exhibits convej)
ideas and thus serve in the
interpretation of facts and
principLes which are found
most difficuLt to convey
through the written word.
One has to see to understand.
Museums of science of this
type, designed for and sup-
ported by the community,
will soon become among the
most important institution !
of civiLized people".
In this museum self-ope-
rating exhibits consisting of
animated panel displays will
present highlights of the phy-
sical sciences under such
titles as,"The Sun, Source of
An Power","What is Mat-
ter ?"and"'The Water Cy-
cte".
A series of small models,
similar to those in The
Franklin Institute in Philadel-
phia, demonstrating magnets,
conductors, pendulums, etc.,
which can be operated by the
visitor, will show some of the
natural laws of physics. From
this point displays will de-
monstrate the relationship of
mathematics to other scien-
ces ; potential and kinetic
energy ; primitive tools and
mechanisms, and finally, mo-
dern mechanisms as applica-
tions of simple machines.
One section with the theme
"Man Controls His Environ-
ment", will reveal the
changes man has made in
nature through such applied
sciences as electricity, optics,
photography and atomic
energy. Modern industry in
Uruguay will be represented
by scale models of national
refrigerator plants, oil refi-
n e r i e s and hydroelectric
power systems.
Mature On Display
A SECOND division of them museum will depict
nature and natural prin-
ciples with special emphasis
on Uruguay. Here will be
demonstrated growth in
plants and animals, repro-
duction and race preserva-
tion, and the distribution of
living things. To illustrate
the latter, a series of habitat
groups or small dioramas will
show Uruguayan plant and
animal life in such biological
zones as sea-coast, open
forest and grasslands.
Climaxing these exhibits in
an adjacent hall will be a
section on the biology of man.
Here will be displayed models
showing the functions of the
human body as well as food,
human diseases and a series
of special exhibits on the
cultural progress of man.
This museum is a tribute
to the enlightened Uruguyan
attitude towards science and
constitutes an example of
how Unesco helps to translate
ideas into realities.
