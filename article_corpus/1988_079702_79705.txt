With the fragmentation of Kievan Russia into autonomous principali¬
ties in the 12th century, Russian cities experienced an extraordinary
flowering of architecture and the arts. In the northeast, the principal¬
ity of Vladimir-Suzdal became the major political centre after the
decline of Kiev. At the end of the 14th century, it was absorbed by its
appanage, the principality of Moscow.
Monuments built in the cities of this region between the 12th and the
17th centuries rank among the finest cultural treasures of Old Russia.
On a map they form a "golden ring". Photos on this double page show
some of the treasures that can be seen on a trip around the ring in
clockwise direction, beginning at the walls of the Kremlin (citadel) of
Moscow (1).
Zagorsk developed around the walls of the Trinity and St. Sergius
monastery, which was founded in 1340 by St. Sergius of Radonezh and
later became a major religious centre. (2) View from the 80-metre-high
bell tower; left, the chapel of the well (1644); at rear, the church of the
Holy Spirit (1476); right, the Trinity cathedral (c.1422). (3) Religious
service in the cathedral, for which Andrei Rublev painted his Old Testa¬
ment Trinity. (4) Cathedral of the Dormition, begun in 1559 during the
reign of Ivan the Terrible.
Pereslavl-Zalessky was founded in 1 152 by Prince Yuri Dolgoruki, who
also founded Moscow. (5) Church of the Presentation (1 778), dedicated to
Aleksandr Nevsky. (6) Right, cathedral of the Dormition at Goritski
monastery, noted for the remarkable quality of its acoustics; left, All

St. John the Theologian (9), built above an entrance gate on the periphery
of the Kremlin (1683). (10) Centre, bell tower of the cathedral of the
Dormition, with its 13-bell carillon.
Yaroslavl, founded in 1010 by Prince Yaroslav the Wise, ranked second
only to Moscow in the 17th and 18th centuries. It has a number of
magnificently decorated churches. (11) The church of St. Elias (1647-
1650) and (12) its famous baroque iconostasis (screen decorated with icon

The Ipatievski monastery, which houses a museum of architecture in
wood, is dominated by the cupolas of the mid-17th century cathedral of
the Trinity (17).

have existed since 1024. (18) In its Kremlin are the cathedral of the
Nativity (13th century) and the monastery of the Saviour-Efimievski
(14th century). (19) The central area: left, market halls dating from the
