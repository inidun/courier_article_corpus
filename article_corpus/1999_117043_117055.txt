A single word on a sign advertises a thriving busi-
ness in India: u l t r a s o u n d . Using sound waves to
produce images of foetuses,this diagnostic tool
is a common part of prenatal care. But in India, a d ve r-
tisements for ultrasound carry a hidden message: d o c-
t o rs will use the tool to reveal the sex of the unborn ,o p e-
ning the way to abort “negative” results, meaning in
effect females.
Clinics have resorted to this disguised adve rt i s i n g
since a law enacted in 1996 banned the use of prenatal tes-
ting for sex selection.D o c t o rs are only allowed to test foe-
tuses for genetic and congenital abnormalities or disease.
In pri n c i p l e , they can be prosecuted for giving the fa i n t e s t
hint as to the sex of a foetus.
Yet the law looks better on paper than in practice,
admits S.C. Srivastava, Policy Director of the central
g ove rnment Health Ministry. R e gi s t r ation of clinics
has been slow and there has not been a single prose-
cution despite official acknowledgment of widespread
a bu s e . One reason is that abortion up to the 20th we e k
of pregnancy is legal,even though sex selection is not.
It is hard to prove an abortion is done for sex selection.
Female foeticide
Sex determ i n ation has been rampant in India since the
1970s when doctors began misusing amniocentesis (ana-
lysis of uterine flu i d ) . A 1985 survey in Bombay, f o r
e x a m p l e , r e vealed that 90 per cent of amniocentesis
centres were invo l ved in sex determ i n at i o n ,with nearly 96
per cent of female foetuses abort e d .To d ay, ultrasound is
the preferred method, with some 1,500 clinics operat i n g
in Punjab alone,a nort h e rn state of over 20 million people
where India’s first sex determ i n ation clinic was set up.T h e
only thing the law seems to have done is to raise doctors ’
fees from about $10 to $30 a session to compensate for the
risk of criminal prosecution.The situation will even get
wo rse with a new wave of ultrasound units, s ays Dr. S h a-
rada Ja i n , a we l l - k n own Delhi gynecologi s t . A m n i o c e n-
tesis is effective in sex determ i n ation in the 16th to 18th
weeks of a pregnancy.To d ay,abdominal ultrasound ima-
ging can tell the sex of a foetus with 90 per cent accuracy
at 14 we e k s. More advanced trans-va ginal ultrasound—
widely-used in Delhi and spreading elsewhere—has eve n
gr e ater accuracy at 12 we e k s. Thus female fœticide is
n ow possible in the first trimester when abortion is less
c o m p l i c ated and there is less suspicion of sex selection,s ay s
D r. Ja i n .
The heart of the problem is traditional at t i-
tudes towards females, insists Dr. Mira Shiva of the
Vo l u n t a ry Health A s s o c i ation of India in New
D e l h i .D a u g h t e rs are seen as an expense part i c u l a r l y
because of the dow ries families pay to marry them
o f f. Under such circumstances, the law banning sex
selection is a “non-starter,” says Dr. Shiva.
G i ven this value system, h ow would people
respond to new genetic technologies to pre-select
the sex of embryos? An A m e rican fertility institute
recently caused a stir with a new technique, M i c r o-
Sort, which separates sperm bearing X-chromo-
somes (producing females) from those with Y- c h r o-
mosomes (producing males).Doctors report a 93
per cent success rate for producing girls and 73 per
cent for boy s.The current $5,000 cost of such a pro-
cedure is expected to fall and doctors believe it is
only a matter of time before the new sex pre-deter-
mination technique hits India.
“I can easily provide the service within months,”
s ays Dr. Anoop Kumar Gupta of Delhi IVF and
Fe rtility Clinic. “If I do, I will have hundreds of
clients queuing outside.” Some doctors in India,
like Dr. T. C . Kumar of Hope Infertility Clinic in
B a n g a l o r e ,b e l i e ve the pre-determ i n ation technique
would stem female fœticide.“The ethical choice lies
b e t ween the preve n t i o n , and the perp e t u ation of fœti-
c i d e ,i n fanticide and homicide of females,” s ays Dr.
Ku m a r. “Social change is a long, d r awn-out pro-
c e s s. Can we afford to wait until these changes
o c c u r ? ”
But according to Dr. S h i va , sex pre-selection
would only feed the “ p at h o l o gical condition of 
our society which discri m i n ates and denigr at e s
wo m e n .” n
