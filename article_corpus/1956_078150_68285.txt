HOW BIASED ARE OUR
HISTORY TEXTBOOKS ?
by Herbert Abraham
It is a shock to find that some
people regard you as a villain;
perhaps as much, of a shock to
learn that they ignore your existence.
If you read the history textbooks
published in other countries, you may
be offended sometimes in both ways:
at finding that your country is
regarded as the villain, and also at
that your country is virtually
ignored. If neither villain nor ignored,
you *will almost certainly conclude
that your country has been under¬
estimated, misrepresented and mis¬
understood.
Our own people, we have learned,
have on occasions been victims of
broken promises, treachery, and
massacres: the notion that "we" have
been the perpetrators of such infa¬
mies would be ridiculous if it were
not so revolting.
The British do not think of
themselves as an aggressor nation,
but it is clearly recorded in history
textbooks oí another country (and
one that is considered very friendly
to Britain) that the British started a
war against them: "Peace reigned,
yet they seized by treachery..." . The
French would not think of themselves
in the terms applied in a textbook in
another country: '"the pillage and
rapine of the invaders..." Americans
and British both feel some hurt in
their pride when they learn that there
exist accounts of the Second World
War from which it would be difficult
to deduce that their countries made
any sacrifices and took part in the
defeat of Hitler.
' Burn the books '
cry of the past
What attitudes toward other
countries do children learn from
their textbooks? It took the
First World War to spark interest in
this question.
Teachers' organizations and many
others devoted to the aims of the
newly-established League of Nations,
campaigned against "the teaching of
hatred". They denounced the kind
of history teaching which glorified
military conquests. French teachers
took the lead. The famous writer,
Anatole France, made a stirring
appeal: "Make hatred hated... Burn
the books which teach hate, burn
them all. Exalt labour and love."
Teachers, who were free to choose
textbooks for their classes, refused
to use those found "warlike". Teach¬
ers and historians from France and
Germany worked together to agree
on more objective accounts of
issues which had divided the two
countries: Alsace, for example. All
through Europe in the 1920's, plans
for revising school textbooks in the
interest of peace were propounded,
adopted and to a certain extent
were acted upon.
But nationalism took new and
virulent forms in the 1930's. The
friendly exchanges between French
and German teachers fell 'foul of Nazi
racialism, which enlisted textbooks
as tools for indoctrinating the young.
The belief that textbooks ought to
convey truth rather than falsehood
rose again when the world looked
forward to peace after the Second
World War.. Textbook revision was in
the air; there was the necessity of
producing new textbooks to replace
those used in Fascist countries;
educators in many countries were
conscious of their responsibility for
contributing to a peaceful world
order through education. When
unesco was established, an essential
part of its programme was to bring
about a review of textbooks with a
view to increasing their contribution
to international understanding.
The world scene has changed a
great deal since 1919. No one today
would use the words of Anatole
France, even in a crusading speech
for a good cause. These words "burn
the books" have an evil ring. The
temper in which educators approach
the question today has nothing in it
of boycott or censorship. It is not a
question of looking for "offensive"
passages and demanding, they be
deleted, nor of getting governments
to sign agreements to give fair treat¬
ment to one another in the textbooks.
One difference between the present
time and 1919 is that, in fact, history
books are a great deal better. There
is nothing new any longer in the idea
that the study of history should give
us some understanding of social,
economic and cultural life. There is
no need to crusade against the kind
of history that consists only of politics
and battles. Of course, the opinions
will differ as to whether a given
textbook goes into too much detail on
military campaigns, and the like.
But the general principle is widely
accepted that past wars should not be
the main feature of history teaching.
Historians have added enormously
to our knowledge of the cultures of
the past, and this is finding its way
to the textbooks. Moreover, with the
experiences of the last two genera¬
tions behind us, and with the
widespread understanding of the
perils of the future, not many people
are disposed to uphold war as a glori¬
ous experience. Overt militarism
does not sit well with the temper of
these times. Then, too, the writers
of textbooks today can build on the
work done between the two wars.
No longer seen as
picturesque ' natives '
When French and German histor¬
ians and teachers took up
again the consideration of his¬
tory textbooks after the Second
World War, they were able to take
as their starting point conclusions
that had been reached in consulta¬
tions held fifteen years. before. The
question of giving a balanced and fair
account of the story of Alsace-Lor¬
raine, for example, was not new to
them. Of course, there are obvious
difficulties in reaching agreement on
ways of treating recent events which
would not foster hatred, but which,
at the same time, would not violate
deeply-held national feelings. But
taking a long view of history, great
progress has been made toward pre¬
senting it dispassionately and objec¬
tively.
While it is true, then, that you may
sometimes be shocked by finding your
country presented as a villain in some
textbooks in other countries, you
will also sometimes be pleasantly
surprised by the scrupulous objecti¬
vity and sympathetic understanding
with which your country's past is
presented.
There is another important differ¬
ence in the scene today. We are
learning to think on a much larger
geographic scale. It was still true,
forty years ago, that when people
generally thought about the countries
that "mattered", they thought chiefly
of the Western European "Powers".
Today, we are learning to take all

peoples into account. Ignorant as
most of us are of cultures widely
different from our own we no longer
look on millions of our fellow human
beings as more or less picturesque but
quite unimportant "natives".
This situation changes the point of
view from which we raise questions
about the teaching of history. It is
not a question of removing misunder¬
standing just between a small number
of great powers. Educators ask
themselves how they ' can better
promote understanding between all
peoples. They look at history text¬
books with this question in mind.
They find that the picture of world
history is distorted by omissions and
by a biased point of view.
' Religious fanatics,
avid for plunder'
This point emerged clearly at a
meeting of history teachers and
textbook writers which was
organized by Unesco in 1950. The
participants from western countries
had their attention directed some of
them no doubt for the first time to
the treatment of Moslem history and
civilization in the western textbooks.
It was pointed out that textbooks
emphasized only the warlike quality
of Islam ("militant, religious fanatics,
avid for plunder"). Islam and
Christianity were contrasted Chris¬
tianity spread through missionaries.
Islam through conquests. Islam
was presented as a menace from
which Western Europe was fortunately
saved at the battle of Poitiers. Social
customs of which the West disapprov¬
ed such as the veiling of women or
polygamy were presented as religious
teaching without any reference to-
their historical setting. While Arab
contributions to Western civilization
were mentioned, with stress on the
transmission of the Greek heritage,
little or nothing was said of major
Arab achievements, of the basic ideals
in which Moslems take a special pride,
such as freedom and brotherhood,
absence of race consciousness, the
care of the poor and of the weak.
In 1946, a pioneering enquiry was
made into the treatment of Asia in
American textbooks. This study led
to certain interesting conclusions, e.g.
that the material about Asian ques¬
tions in most of the textbooks under
consideration was so superficial and
episodic that pupils had little chance
of obtaining a coherent picture.
The conclusions reached in the
American study are borne out by
reports that have come to unesco of
studies made in some European
countries.
Unesco will follow up these studies
by urging Asian countries to look
carefully at what pictures their
textbooks present of Western Europe.
Regardless of whether Unesco itself
pursues these enquiries much further,
these reports will certainly have the
effect of stimulating contacts and
discussions among European and
Asian educators, and of course among
educators of other countries as well.
Obviously, the problem of giving a
better understanding of other peoples
all over the world cannot be solved by
adding to the present textbooks
masses of information about every
country. It calls for new thinking
about the ways history should be
taught and about the selection of

FATHER OF TODAY'S
TEXTBOOKS
This medal was struck in Czecho¬
slovakia in 1946 to honour John Amos
Comenius the first great textbook wri¬
ter of the age of printing. Comenius,
whose real name was Komensky, was
born in Eastern Moravia in 1592 and
died in Amsterdam in I 670. He pro¬
duced schemes for a complete system
of national education and a series of
textbooks to serve the system. Nothing
better than his two principal works,
Janua Linguarum and Orbis Pictus, was
produced for more than two centuries.
Comenius looked forward to the estab¬
lishment of a just and free common¬
wealth of men. That is why the in¬
scription on the reverse side of the
medal above reads : " To a forerunner
of the United Nations Organization ".
materials that will arouse interest
and give basic insight.
Reference has been made to
unesco's interest in the improve¬
ment of textbooks for international
understanding. Again, we may make
a contrast with the situation in 1919.
We now have an international organ¬
ization with a definite responsibility
for promoting education for interna¬
tional understanding, and conse¬
quently some responsibility for
promoting the improvement of text¬
books and teaching materials for this
purpose.
This does not mean that unesco has
either the authority or the desire to
rewrite any country's textbooks. The
only people who can improve text¬
books are the people in the country
which uses them. Unesco's work
starts with this as a basic assumption.
Responsible educators in many
countries believe that their pupils
should get a more balanced and more
objective view of other countries.
Obviously, they can be helped in their
thinking * about this by meeting
educators who are thinking along the
same lines elsewhere. Unesco has
organized international study confer¬
ences for teachers of history, geogra¬
phy and foreign languages.
Unpleasant facts
are not hushed up
As a result of one such meeting of
history teachers held in Brussels
in 1950, many smaller meetings
have been held in Western Europe,
most of these have been bilateral
meetings that is, educators from
two countries have met to talk over
the way they are presented in each
others' textbooks. Unesco encourages
this kind of frank and friendly
exchange.
At some meetings, historians have
discussed details which do not strike
the layman as being particularly
significant. It must be remembered,
though, that they are applying in
these minor cases a general rule
which is of great importance! that
whatever gets into the history text¬
book, whether in itself of minor or
major importance, should be based on
the best historical scholarship.
Sometimes the discussions have
turned on highly controversial issues
which are charged with intense na¬
tional feeling. The people taking
part in such discussions have on
occasion been wrongly accused in
their own country of agreeing to
cover up unpleasant facts in order to
please a foreign country. There
have been mistaken fears that these
meetings may produce some kind of
official version of history which sacri¬
fices truth in the supposed interest of
international understanding.
The facts do not justify these fears.
At 'bilateral meetings, the teachers or
historians bring to each others' atten¬
tion facts vyhich they think relevant
and reasons why different interpreta¬
tions are current in their respective
countries. Sometimes they agree in
recommending that some neglected
facts ought to be included in history
textbooks. Sometimes they recom¬
mend that children should learn that
different people do in fact interpret
events differently.
They all agree that any changes
that are to be worthwhile and sound¬
ly based, must be made at their own
free choice by the people who write
and publish textbooks.
