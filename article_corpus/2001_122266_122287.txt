the radio scene tells all
Radio, the most widely used medium in Africa, can only flourish on democratic
soil, which helps to explain why private stations are thriving in the west and not
in the centre of the continent
had has only six private radio stations,
while Mali boasts 100… What explains
this tremendous disparity? The two coun-
tries are similar on several counts. They
are the same size (a little over 1,200,000
square kilometres), and neither has
access to the sea. Both were French colo-
nies and lived through long years of mili-
tary dictatorship after achieving inde-
pendence in 1960. And last year, t h e y
ranked among the world’s poorest coun-
t r i e s,with a per capita income of $261 for
Mali and $240 for Chad.
“An unfavourable political environ-
ment and socio-cultural factors” s l o w
down the development of radio plura-
lism,says Gilbert Maoundodji,director
of FM Liberté, Chad’s second indepen-
dent radio station, launched last year.
“The people who govern here have not
yet completely assimilated the values of
collective action, f r e e d o m , tolerance and
democracy. That sets up a roadblock to
initiative.”
A country’s political context rubs off
on its airwaves. M a l i , which held free
elections in 1992 and has set up demo-
cratic institutions that function reaso-
nably well, launched its first private radio
station in March 1991. Radio Bamakan
paved the way for a host of others, i n c l u-
ding Radio Liberté, Radio Kay i r a a n d
Klédu FM.
In early 1993, Chad settled for a
parody of a “national conference,” g e n e-
rally intended as a broad policy consul-
t a t i o n . Yet it only strengthened the
power of President Idriss Déby, w h o
took the reins through armed force.As a
r e s u l t , even religious stations found it
d i f ficult to make a breakthrough. Th e
first Catholic station, La Voix du Pay s a n
( “ Voice of the peasants”), started broad-
casting in 1996.The lay station Dja FM
followed suit only three years later.
Other stations, including FM Liberté,
Radio Brakos, and the brand new Duji
Lokar FM (“Morning Star”) came later.
And plans for a private weekly radio
s t a t i o n , L’ O b s e r v a t e u r, are on the verge
of fruition.
Confiscating equipment
“needing repair”
C h a d ’s example is emblematic of
Central Africa as a whole, which seemed
to have a lead over its western neigh-
bours when Africa N°1, the first and only
French-language pan-African radio sta-
t i o n , began broadcasting in Gabon in
1 9 8 0 .But since African states began tur-
ning to democracy in the early 1990s,
West Africa has witnessed an explosion
of independent radio stations: t h e i r
number has soared to over 400.In Cen-
tral A f r i c a ,h o w e v e r, private investment
in broadcasting remains minimal.
Chronic instability has set the region ten
years back.Most countries there, inclu-
ding the Central African Republic and
the Republic of the Congo, are belea-
guered by simmering armed conflicts, if
not all-out war, as in Rwanda, Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
In the eastern part of the DRC, for
e x a m p l e, rebels have confiscated the few
private radio stations that existed before
the August 1998 war. Radio Muunga-
n o ’s transmitter was taken to Uganda
in October 2000 on the pretext that it
needed repairs,and to date has not been
returned.When they don’t control pro-
gramme content, insurgent groups
simply do away with the equipment.Th e
g o v e r n m e n t ’s methods are just as drastic.
In September 2000,Radio Télévision Kin
M a l é b o ( RTKM) was nationalized
outright and three private television net-
works closed down.Only religious radio
stations are allowed to broadcast,as long
as they steer clear of politics.

torial Guinea, Gabon and Cameroon,

intitutional. Since 1990, when a law on
broadcasting freedom was passed, t h e
Cameroon government has used all
kinds of subterfuge to prevent the emer-
gence of private radio, with the exception
of rural and community stations laun-
ched by UN E S C O or the Intergovern-
mental Francophone Agency.
For example, Radio France Inter-
nationale (RFI), which broadcasts
throughout A f r i c a , could not be received
on FM in Yaoundé until February this
y e a r. “ We had been in contact with
Cameroon since 1992,as part of a coope-
ration agreement to include RFI in the
national radio station’s technical struc-
t u r e,” says Hugues Salord, R F I ’s director
for international affairs. “But we were
unable to clinch the deal until the decree
of April 3, 2 0 0 0 , which benefited not
only RFI, but Africa N°1, the BBC, a n d
other local private radio stations.”
It took ten years for the decree to
be signed, but the obstacles remain. O f fi-
cials have increased administrative com-
plications, imposed very short applica-
tion deadlines (four months) and
demanded exorbitant fees for operating
licenses—$15,400 in a country where a
civil servant’s average monthly salary is
$ 1 2 0 .Most of the proposed projects were
therefore eliminated,and one of the sta-
tions that had operated until then on an
experimental basis, Radio Soleil, had to
stop broadcasting in June 2000.
The art of
bureaucratic subversion
As a free medium which reaches a
wider population than print, p a r t l y
because of broadcasting in local dialects,
partly because of high illiteracy rates,
radio arouses the mistrust and hostility
of political leaders. Hence their inclina-
tion to maintain a government mono-
poly on broadcasting to foil an inde-
pendent media that is often virulent and
close to the opposition. The airwaves
are strategically important for politi-
c i a n s, who will go to great lengths to
control them by any means.For example,
on February 22, 1994, Gabonese army
tanks destroyed the facilities of Radio
L i b e r t é . The government later claimed it
was because the opposition was using
the station as a propaganda mouthpiece! 
“Radio Liberté? It was the devil’s
radio… The army and security services…
destroyed their facilities.We ’ve returned
to the normal game of democracy since,”
wrote Gabon’s president, Omar Bongo,
in his recently published book, B l a n c
comme Nègre.
B o n g o ’s comments illustrate the
demonization of free radio in Central
A f r i c a . The ghost of Rwanda’s R a d i o
Télévision des Mille Collines (RTLM),
which played a key role in mobilizing
the killers who perpetrated the 1994
genocide, still haunts the region.Today,
political leaders disinclined to accept
broadcasting freedom point to it as an
e x a m p l e, conveniently forgetting that
RTLM was initially close to the Kigali
g o v e r n m e n t . The result: as soon as a
radio station strays from the official line,
it is suspected of inciting rebellion or
tribal hatred. Equatorial Guinea has
taken drastic steps to avoid that risk:
not a single private radio station has
been allowed on its soil! 
Besides political factors, the weak-
ness of civil society has clearly helped
slow down the growth of independent
radio in Central A f r i c a . Local NGOs
and grassroots organizations are not
involved enough in national political
d e b a t e. This results in indifference on
the part of donors likely to help set up
radio stations, especially by training staff
and supplying equipment.“I obtained a
frequency last year, but can’t afford to
purchase equipment,” says Begoto
O u l a t a r, director of N’Djamena Bi-
h e b d o, C h a d ’s most famous newspaper,
which is now branching onto the air-
waves.
Economic woes also prevent private
radio from gaining a foothold in central
A f r i c a .Public networks receive the lion’s
share of advertising, the only source of
income for independent radio, w h i c h
cannot count on user fees.To stay out of
t r o u b l e, businesses avoid advertising on
stations with a reputation of being hos-
tile to the government.Take the case of
Gabon’s Radio Soleil, which rose from
the ashes of Radio Liberté and was sus-
pended five times in four years. During
a 1999 Yaoundé conference on pluralist
m e d i a , Makaga Vi r g i n u s, a station repre-
s e n t a t i v e, explained companies’ reluc-
tance to invest on its airwaves:“we were
not subservient enough to the central
g o v e r n m e n t , which has very close ties
to the business world.”
Electronic inroads
to state monopolies
But there are reasons to be opti-
mistic about the future of radio in A f r i c a .
New technology is making equipment
l i g h t e r, smaller and less expensive.
Direct access to information on the
Internet will probably prompt officials to

loosen their grip. And there is likely to
be a change of mentality with the slow
but steady influx of foreign radio net-
works such as RFI,the BBC and Voice
of A m e r i c a , which may end up softe-
ning political rigidity.
Local radio stations created by inter-
national and non-governmental organi-
z a t i o n s, such as the Central A f r i c a n
Republic’s Radio Ndeke Luka, (heir to
the United Nations radio in Bangui), o r
Burundi’s RSF-Bonesah FM (founded
by veterans of Radio Umwizero, an ini-
tiative of the Association for Humani-
tarian Action), will also help along the
p r o c e s s.Worldwide groups like the Panos
Institute, the Research and Technology
Exchange Group (Gret), the Hirondelle
Foundation and Search for Common
G r o u n d ,which have contributed to radio
pluralism in West Africa,are beginning
to focus on Central Africa.
The audiovisual landscape is chan-
ging in most countries.A case in point is
Cameroon, where the TV Max private
television network, founded in August
2000, was barely two months old when
the public network adjusted its pro-
grammes to compete! Why don’t pri-
vate radio stations do the same? If the

area acquired a network of groups and
NGOs working to promote independent
radio, there is hope that Central Africa
would soon catch up with its neighbours
in the west.
The 2001 Free Fr e q u e n c i e s f e s t i v a l ,a n
initiative of Kinshasa’s Réveil FM ( f r o m
March 19 to 22),was a step in the right
d i r e c t i o n . It brought together several
Central African operators and has
already laid the groundwork for a
regional organization to defend the
rights of private radio. ■
