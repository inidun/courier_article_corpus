The dawning possibilities of human cloning raise unprecedented ethical and political
d i l e m m a s. N o w h e re is the debate more intensive than in Britain, w h e re the cloned sheep Dolly
was created using a revolutionary technique.

In Fe b ru a ry 1997, when British scientist Ian W i l-
mut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute out-
side Edinburgh announced that they had suc-
cessfully cloned a sheep, D o l l y, the news set off a
global wave of concern about the possibilities of
human cloning. In contrast, the reaction of gove rn-
ment officials in Britain was one of sat i s fa c t i o n — b o r-
d e ring perhaps on complacency — t h at adequate pre-
p a r ations had already been made to address the full
i m p l i c ations of cloning research.
As political leaders across the world spoke stern-
ly of the need for an immediate global morat o ri u m
on such research, B ritain was able to point out that
human cloning—the creation of humans copied from
other humans—was already banned under the
Human Fe rt i l i z ation and Embryology A c t , passed in
1 9 9 0 .
The 1990 Act does, h owe ve r , a l l ow research on
human embryos up to 14 days old and in pri n c i p l e
appeared to open the way for “therapeutic cloning”—
the use of cloning techniques to develop a potential
range of medical treatments such as organ and tissue
replacement and repair.
But the mood changed in June this ye a r , w h e n
the gove rnment refused to endorse a proposal from
the respected regulat o ry body established by the act—
the Human Fe rt i l i z ation and Embryology A u t h o ri-
ty—to allow amendments to the legi s l ation which
would formally allow research into therapeutic clo-
n i n g .The gove rnment said it needed more time to
study the ethical implications of such amendments.
For Bri t a i n , the political dilemma is part i c u l a r l y
a c u t e .On the one hand, the cloning techniques deve-
loped by Wilmut and his colleagues have been hailed
as a major scientific breakthrough whose broad poten-
tial medical applications promise to provide a major
boost to the British economy, for example through
licensing to companies across the wo r l d .
But with trust in gove rnment scientists already
deeply scarred by the experience of bovine spongi-
f o rm encephalopat hy (BSE, i n f o rmally known as
Mad Cow Disease), and further dented by concern
over the potential health and environmental dangers
of genetically modified crops, the gove rnment appea-
red reluctant to take further risks to its credibility by
giving rapid approval to another “ r e vo l u t i o n a ry ”a n d
c o n t r ove rsial technology.
Copies of pop stars
There are few who would endorse the use of clo-
ning technology to produce replica human beings to
o r d e r. It is therapeutic cloning, with its enorm o u s
potential medical applications to humans, t h at is at
the centre of most current controve rs y.
One possible application of therapeutic cloning
could be the treatment of women whose mitochon-
d rial DNA—the genetic mat e rial that provides ener-
gy to the cell—is damaged, and therefore risks pas-
sing this defect on to their children. Another is the
ability to gr ow and graft skin in this way,which wo u l d
replace the need for the current practice of using skin
taken from another part of a pat i e n t ’s body.The same
technique could be used to replace damaged bone
or liver cells.
The problem, of cours e , is that the word cloning
remains highly emotive ,c r e at i n g, as it does, v i s i o n s
of rich pop stars or autocratic dictat o rs ordering up
multiple copies of themselve s. C ritics argue that clo-
ning represents the ultimate “ i n s t ru m e n t a l i z at i o n ”
of a human being: t r e ating one individual pri m a ri l y
as the means to gr atify another, not as an end in him-
self or hers e l f.They also argue that any attempt to

distinguish between “ r e p r o d u c t i ve cloning”and “ t h e-
rapeutic cloning” is largely semantic, and that gi v i n g
the green light to the second will inevitably lead to
the firs t .
But the distinction is seen as critical for those keen
to realize the full medical potential of the cloning
t e c h n i q u e s.Among them is Wilmut himself, who has
spent much of the past two and a half ye a rs talking
about both the threats and the promises that his wo r k
has opened up, and now works as chief scientific offi-
cer for Geron Bio-Med,a company set up earlier this
year jointly by the Roslin Institute and a U. S .b i o-
technology company, G e r o n , to exploit the potential
of his wo r k .
For W i l m u t , like many others , the ethical threat s
of human cloning invo l ve sensitive issues of human
identity and social relat i o n s h i p s ,p a rticularly within
the fa m i l y.“ We can all imagine the type of issues that
would arise if a cloned child were born into our ow n
fa m i l y,” he say s.“Just think, for example, of the dif-
ficulties for a child who fails to meet the expectat i o n s
of its parents, which is quite likely gi ven that pers o-
nality is only partly the result of our genetic inheri-
t a n c e .” But he also insists that the promises of clo-
ning techniques, if responsibly used, r e m a i n
e n o rm o u s.“There is a large potential here for prov i-
ding more effective treatment for a range of diseases,
such as Pa r k i n s o n ’s Disease, t h at are associated with
damaged cells that do not have the ability to repro-
duce themselve s.” He acknowledges that the ethi-
cal dilemmas are diffic u l t ,a d d i n g :“ We are keen to
take part in any discussion that addresses them.”
But attempts to win acceptance for therapeutic
cloning research in the political arena have prove d
fraught with obstacles,p ri m a rily stemming from the
political strength of anti-abortion gr o u p s ,who remain
deeply opposed to all forms of cloning.
T h i s , for example, has already been the fate of
attempts by the Clinton administration to introduce
l e gi s l ation in the United States that would simulta-
neously outlaw reproductive cloning while allow i n g
e m b ryo cloning for therapeutic purp o s e s.
Sensitivities in the U. S .are high.Earlier this ye a r ,
the National Institutes of Health announced that ,
despite being subject to a congressional ban on the
use of federal funds for research on embryo s , it had
decided to sponsor work on stem cells obtained from
e m b ryos provided by the pri vate sector, e . g . , left ove r
from fertility treat m e n t s. (Stem cells are undifferen-
t i ated cells from which specialized cells such as blood
cells deve l o p.) But congress is now moving to close
this loophole.
The pers p e c t i ve of U. S . c ritics is close to that
which has dominated legi s l at i ve debates in mainland
Europe—in particular in France and Germ a ny — w i t h
its heavy emphasis on potential threats to human
“ d i g n i t y ” . Indeed it is this approach, combined with
the view that human life begins at conception, t h at
has led most European countries to ban not only
attempts at human cloning, but all forms of embryo
r e s e a r c h .
‘A moral black hole’
In contrast, the official British (and A m e ri c a n )
approach has,up to now,been more pragmat i c, s e e i n g
the potential dangers of human cloning pri m a ri l y
in terms of the possible medical ri s k s , such as uncer-
tainty over long-term complicat i o n s. But the UK
g ove rn m e n t ’s new announcement appears to refle c t
an increased willingness to accept that other more
explicitly “ e t h i c a l ” fa c t o rs need to be taken into
a c c o u n t .
This acknowledgment was immediately we l c o-
med by religious lobby groups such as Chri s t i a n
Action Research and Educat i o n , whose director,
Charles Colchester,was quoted in the London Ti m e s
as urging the gove rnment to ensure that a new review
body set up by the gove rnment to inve s t i g ate human
cloning techniques should consider what he descri-
bed as the “gaping moral black hole” in such scien-
t i fic research.
But this suggestion was widely criticized by resear-
c h e rs in the fie l d .R o b e rt W i n s t o n , for example,p r o-
fessor of fertility studies at the Royal Po s t gr a d u at e
Medical School in London,wa rned that many of Bri-
t a i n ’s “best scientists” m ay be tempted to leave the
c o u n t ry to carry on their work if the gove rnment does
not back dow n .“By confusing the cloning argument,
the gove rnment is in danger of impeding one of the
most significant medical advances of the decade,”h e
s a i d .
There was also criticism from those keen to see
cloning techniques developed as a commercial acti-
v i t y. “ B ritish science is currently at the forefront
of this emerging field,” s ays John Sime, the chief
e xe c u t i ve of the Bioindustry A s s o c i at i o n , the pro-
fessional organization for the UK biotechnology
i n d u s t ry.“But it is a competitive one in which much
is at stake,both for patients and the economy.”
Some remain optimistic that research will recei-
ve the green light. “If the promises that have been
made for these new techniques, in terms of the
potential for treating degenerat i ve diseases,are eve n
half tru e , it would be immoral not to go ahead with
the research,” s ays Juliet Tizzard of the Progr e s s
E d u c ational Tru s t , a group that lobbies in favour of
research on reproductive technologies.
But this conclusion is far from assured, and the
debate is far from over.The prospect of being able
to produce identical copies of adult humans conti-
nues to hold enough fascination for some—and to
be sufficiently distasteful for others—to ensure that ,
w h at e ver the potential medical benefits from
the less dramatic aspects of cloning research,
its support e rs face a difficult task in getting
permission to proceed. n
‘ We can all imagine the type of issues that would
arise if a cloned child were born into our own family.
Just think, for example, of the difficulties for a child
who fails to meet the expectations of its pare n t s,
which is quite likely given that personality is only
partly the result of our genetic inheritance.’
