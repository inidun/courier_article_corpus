Designed by an international panel of architects, UNESCO'S new headquarters
occupies a seven and a half acre site made available to UNESCO by the French
Government.
Plans for the three buildings of the headquarters were prepared jointly by Marcel
Breuer of the United States, Pier Luigi Nervi of Italy and Bernard Zehrfuss of
France; they were approved by an international panel of five architects: Lucio
Costa (Brazil), Walter Gropius (United States), Charles Le Corbusier (France),
Sven Markelius (Sweden) and Ernesto Rogers (Italy). American architect Eero
Saarinen was also consulted.
Architectand designer, Marcel Breuer has taught and lectured in universities and

many official and private organizations. Among his recent works are the National
