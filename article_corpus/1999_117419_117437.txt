In a nation where the death penalty is in
force in 38 out of 51 stat e s , r o u g h l y
3,500 pri s o n e rs are waiting on deat h
r ow, 47 per cent of them white and 42 per
cent black.* Executions are on the ri s e ,w i t h
68 carried out in 1998. In addition to impo-
sing the death penalty for crimes committed
by juve n i l e s , the U. S . is also unusual in
making no exceptions for the mentally retar-
d e d .
W h at explains the endorsement of the
d e ath penalty by four out of eve ry five A m e-
ricans? In the civil rights period of the1960s,
the percentage of those in its favour bri e fly
dipped as low as 42 per cent.But since the
Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976,after
a morat o rium of about a decade, s u p p o rt
has been little short of monolithic. It is tru e
t h at the figures drop (to about 60 per cent)
if those surve yed are presented the altern a-
t i ve of keeping serious offenders in jail
without possibility of parole.
The ‘death belt’
H owe ve r , fear of crime persists and a puni-
t i ve climate remains. L aw m a k e rs are conti-
nually introducing bills to expand the list of
“ a g gr avating fa c t o rs ” presented to the jury in
m a ny states in the sentencing phase of a capi-
tal case.
The so-called “ D e ath Belt” of the Sou-
t h e rn stat e s , with their history of lynch law,
accounts for a hefty percentage of death row
i n m at e s , and half of the executions in 1997
were carried out in Texas alone. But Cali-
fornia,which pays out more for its prisons
than its unive rs i t i e s , n ow has the largest
number of inmates on death row. New Yo r k ,
whose Gove rnor Mario Cuomo was one of
the few American politicians in recent his-
t o ry willing to risk a public stand for aboli-
t i o n , has brought the death penalty back.
And in A ri z o n a ,o f ficials intend to accele-
rate the pace of executions.
Built on Puritanical foundat i o n s ,h u m a n
relations in this gun-toting culture are still
v i e wed in Manichean term s , va l i d ating the
f r o n t i e rs m a n ’s call for the bad guy to be
s t rung up. In a climate heavily influ e n c e d
by the religious ri g h t , a public stand against
capital punishment is regarded as nothing
s h o rt of political suicide. E xe c u t i ve cle-
mency, which was used to commute many
d e ath sentences to life imprisonment duri n g
the heyday of the gangsters in the 1930s and
1 9 4 0 s , is rarely exe r c i s e d .Witness Gove r-
nor Bill Clinton,who approved the execu-
tion of a mentally retarded convict in A r k a n-
sas just after winning the presidential
elections in 1992,and California’s Demo-
c r atic Gove rnor Gray Dav i s , who has pas-
sed up the possibility of staying two exe c u-
tions this year.
M o r e ove r , the criminal justice system is
i n e x t ricably intertwined with electoral poli-
t i c s. D i s t rict at t o rn e y s , who make the deci-
sion whether to seek the death penalty in a
gi ven case, are elected. S t ate judges, o n c e
a p p o i n t e d , face a retention vote at the next
general elections.While federal judges are
appointed for life, they face a grueling congr e s-
sional confirm ation bat t l e .Public perception
is that capital cases, which can cost a state in
the region of $1.2 million to prosecute, a r e
subject to unduly lengthy scru t i ny. In fa c t ,
l e gi s l atures around the country have made it
increasingly difficult to bring appeals.
M e a n w h i l e , despite a 1984 Supreme
C o u rt ruling intended to correct racial bias
in jury selection, the operation of the deat h
penalty remains racially skewe d .Of the 1,838
D i s t rict At t o rneys in death penalty states as
of May this ye a r , only 22 were Hispanic and
22 black.Although roughly equal numbers
of blacks and whites are homicide victims, o f
the 500 people put to death between 1977
and 1998, 81.8 per cent were convicted of
killing a white pers o n . Setting aside cases
i nvolving particularly egr e gious crimes such as
s e rial killings, the death penalty falls dispro-
p o rt i o n at e l y, for crimes of equal seve ri t y,u p o n
poor blacks who cannot afford adequate legal
r e p r e s e n t at i o n .
There are some signs of movement in
public opinion. A cluster of miscarriages of
justice on death row and the reve rsal of seve-
ral convictions have helped to rally support
both for a new morat o rium on executions and
for a plan to dive rt spending on death penalty
cases into a fund for the families of homicide
v i c t i m s. It is also conceivable that if a Demo-
c r at comes to power at the next elections and
appoints two new justices of a less than
extreme conservat i ve pers u a s i o n , the Supreme
C o u rt might turn the situation around.
B e t ween now and then, p ri s o n e rs wa i t
on death row. In the words of one juve n i l e
offender in Oklahoma,“ To condemn me to
d e ath . . . is to say my life has no positive
va l u e , I’m beyond correction or rehabilita-
t i o n .” It is strange that a nation that puts such
store in the perfectibility of the individual is
willing to discard so many live s. n



T HE AMERICAN EXCEP T ION

In a climate influenced by the religious right, a public stand against the death penalty
is regarded as nothing short of political suicide
w Journalist, San Francisco Chronicle
In Texas, the cross marking the grave of an executed prisoner bears his number, not his name.
