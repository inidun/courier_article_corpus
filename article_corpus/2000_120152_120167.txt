Mi riam Makeba is a living legend, whose music
inspired millions in the struggle against
a p a rt h e i d . Forced into exile for 30 ye a rs ,
Makeba performed for the likes of the Ethiopian
Emperor Haile Selassie, J F K , Fidel Castro and the
Po p e . Yet on this sunny South A f rican morn i n g,
“Mama A f ri c a ” opens her door in Jo h a n n e s burg to a
j i t t e ry journalist and a young upstart ,T h a n d i swa ,t h e
lead singer of the kwaito group Bongo Maffin .K wa i t o
is a local brew of hip-hop, house and reggae music.
Bongo Maffin ’s fame dates back to their 1997 hit
ve rsion of Makeba’s classic song,“Pat a - Pat a ” .
“She’s young enough to be my granddaughter!
W h at are we going to discuss?” c ries the 68-ye a r - o l d
gr e at - grandmother Makeba. But as soon as
Thandiswa walks in,they embrace.
How did you feel when you first heard Bongo
Maffin’s version of “Pata-Pata” in 1997?
M i r i a m: I was ve ry pleased because when I
came back home [from exile], some people said,
“ A h , t h e y ’re the oldies!” And here are these ve ry
young people, s i n ging my songs. It also made me
happy to see youth still so attached to A f ri c a n
m u s i c, especially considering the influence of what
they hear on the radio. H o n e s t l y, when you listen
to these stat i o n s , you don’t know if yo u ’re in A f ri c a
or Californ i a . Not just because of the musical con-
t e n t …
T h a n d i s w a:Also from the tone and attitude of the
D J s.
Thandiswa, how would you describe kwaito?
Thandiswa: It’s about the energy of the time,
post-independence youth expressing their freedom
and excitement about everything being so brand
new. Listen to the music and you’ll find it’s dance-
oriented but there is also a very positive vibe in its
energy and message.
M i r i a m: I t ’s South A f ri c a ’s counterp a rt to rap.
K waito has its own way of spreading a positive mes-
s a g e . In our society, we have always passed messages

and expressed ours e l ves through song.This is why the
f o rmer gove rnment was so scared of musicians…
Thandiswa, do you feel that young people have a
negative attitude towards the old-school
musicians?
T h a n d i s w a: I t ’s not about negat i ve at t i t u d e s ,
but we didn’t gr ow up in the same situation of
s t ruggle against apart h e i d . The only time I
remember being stuck in a situation of revolution
was in 1985/86 [a state of emergency was declared
as massive student riots erupted]. A lot of young
people know all about the struggle but they we r e n ’t
directly involved.
With the new freedom in 1994 [the first free
elections], we started “eating” everything given to
u s , including stuff from A m e rica… Many in the
“kwaito generation” began living in town, discon-
nected from their gr a n d m o t h e rs , parents and
cousins.
M i r i a m: I t ’s as if kids today don’t realise just how
little time has passed since Mandela was in pri s o n .
Around the time of the second national elections in
1 9 9 9 , I heard some young people say i n g, ‘I’m not
going to vote because Mandela didn’t do this and that
and he promised he wo u l d .’ I had a serious talk with
t h e m :‘ W h at did you say? Yo u ’re living in towns and
attending multiracial schools.There was a time when
your parents and grandparents were being taught
under a tree and that is something you cannot forget.’
Miriam: I’d like to ask you a question,Thandiswa.
I’m on a committee to try to find ways of improving
HIV/AIDS education. How can we get the message
of prevention to sink into the minds of this
generation?
Thandiswa: I don’t know, Mama. People know
about the disease, people know people who are
dying because of it,but the message isn’t clicking.
People are having sex at such a young age. T h e
highest infection rate is among women betwe e n
the ages of 15 and 25. At 15, girls can’t make
rational decisions about using a condom, or not
going with a lot of boys… 
This is why many of the Aids campaigns are
using kwaito to push the message through to the
young kids. [ T h a n d i swa and a number of other
k waito stars are spokespeople for an anti-Aids cam-
paign called,“Love Life”.] 
M i r i a m: And the boys are not so nice.They force
their way… When I go on tour, I’m bombarded
with questions like, “What about all the rapes in
South A f ri c a ? ”You feel embarr a s s e d ,h u rt and, as a
woman, you could kill someone…
Thandiswa, Miriam’s music is known all over the
world.Are you aiming to do the same with Bongo
Maffin? 
T h a n d i s w a: Yah definitely! We would like to
become an international band.
Miriam: I hope it happens because one day the
Mama Makebas will be gone.During a UK music
f e s t i val in A p ri l , another major kwaito gr o u p, T K Z e e ,
was singing outside while I was playing indoors. I t ’s
nice to see the different generations together… It
shows we’re not standing still. ■
The road that I follow
Leads me on my wa y
Got my eyes 
on tomorrow
And my feet 
on today.

South African singer (1932-)
