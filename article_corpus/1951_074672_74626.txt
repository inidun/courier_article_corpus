Specialized Agencies
carry out much of
the United Nations'
practical work
O HEALTH : WORLD FIGHT AGAINST DtSEASE.The World Health Organization (WHO) concentrates its
efforts on eradicating diseases : malaria, T. B., typhus. Here
a Haitian mother brings her baby for a penicillin injection
against yaws. A WHO team of doctors and nurses is working
in the Marbial Valley of Haiti, where Unesco has a fundamental
education pilot project, to help fight this crippling disease.

International Refugee Organization () RO). MiHions have
received care and maintenance from IRO and other UN agen-

disease. Over half the world's population can neither read
nor write. That is whey Unesco is working to ensure the basic
minimum of education for everyone, along with the knowledge
and skills to enable them to improve their living conditions.
At Patzcuaro, Mexico (shown here), Unesco has set up the first
of a world network of regional fundamental education centres.

has a training scheme to ensure safe maintenance of airfields
in all parts of the world.

devastated and under-developed countries. Loans are used
for hydroelectric power development (shown here), improve-
ment of agriculture, rebuilding of port facilities.
