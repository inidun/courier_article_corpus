THE IMPORTANCE
OF NOT BEING EARNEST
by George Mikes
I1 am. classified by most of my
enemies and even by some of
my friends as a humorist. Make no
mistake: to call a man a humorist is
no compliment. No one calls himself
a humorist because there is some¬
thing pejorative and dismissive in the
phrase. But I accept the classification
not with pride (I am not a very proud
man), not with resignation (I am not
given to melancholy) but with a shrug.
Very well, I am a humorist if you
insist on it. But here I must sound a
warning against myself. A humorist is
no more an expert on humour than
a man suffering from diabetes is an
"expert" on diabetes. The humorist
like the diabetic has got it but he
has no idea how he got it and still
less how to get rid of it.
\ Humour is a problem of philosophy
but philosophers do not fare much
better than humorists or diabetics.
- A philosopher with a sense of humour
will laugh at a joke instead of per¬
forming a post mortem on it; and a
philosopher will not be able however
competent he may be otherwise to
teach us a lot about the sense of
humour if he himself lacks one.
The issue is further plagued by
another complication unique to this
subject. A man reading an essay on
humour has no more right or reason
to expect to laugh or to be entertained
than someone reading an essay on
Nicomachean Ethics; yet he does
expect to be vastly amused. A woman
reading a cookery book does not
expect to have her hunger quenched
but a person reading an essay on
humour expects to be entertained.
And the fact that more dull books
have been written on humour than on
any other subject seems to make no
.difference.
GEORGE MIKES, author of How to be an
Alien (1946) and Switzerland for Beginners
(1962) has sent us the following biographical
note: "I was born in 1912 in Siklos (Hungary)
but moved to Budapest when I was ten. I
wanted to become a journalist and writer but
my family insisted on my becoming a gentleman,
i.e. a lawyer, following in my father's and grand¬
father's footsteps. So I studied law but got a job
for myself as a journalist too. By the time I got my
doctorate, I was too far gone in journalism and
my family had to give up all hopes of my becom¬
ing a gentleman. I was sent to London for a
fortnight and have stayed ever since. During the ]
war I worked In the BBC's Hungarian Section,
after that as a freelance writer. I have also
written more than 30 books and I am told
they have sold several mil/ion copies in 21
languages. "



humour
across frontiers
make laugh (ter)
not war!
Let us then have a very quick survey
of what other people said about
humour and how they tried to define it.
The Old Testament already noticed the
sadness of laughter: "Even in laughter
the heart is sorrowful"; and "the
end of mirth is heaviness." Accord¬
ing to Plato we laugh at the misfortune
of our friends and our feeling is mixed
pleasure and pain. Aristotle also
recognized the essentially cruel nature
of humour and said that to make a
joke of a man is to vilify him. Cicero,
too, thought that the ridiculous had its
grounds in baseness and deformity.
A very long jump takes us to John
Harington, Elizabethan courtier and
wit, who says that comedies "may
make men see the shame of their own
fault". The English philosopher Tho¬
mas Hobbes' definition is the most
famous of all: "Laughter is nothing
else but sudden glory arising from
a sudden conception of some emi-
nency in ourselves, by comparison
with the infirmity of others, or with our
own formerly."
I could go on for 24 volumes to
quote the great sages and philos¬
ophers through Hegel and Schopen¬
hauer but I shall quote only three:
Bergson, Koestler and myself.
Bergson knew that laughter was
always corrective. He was also fully
aware (and Freud later agreed with
him) of the aggressive and cruel-
nature of laughter. "In laughter we
always find an unavowed intention to
humiliate and consequently to correct
our neighbour."
Koestler wrote a great deal about
humour, including an essay for Encyc¬
lopaedia Britannica. His definition is
more pragmatic: the aim of humour
is to provoke laughter. He goes on,
explaining that laughter is the one
"luxury reflex" of humanity: a reflex
which unlike sneezing or closing our
eyes in fright serves no useful
purpose.
Finally myself. I quote an old Jewish
joke, one of those which, I find, are
often more illuminating than a bunch
of philosophers.
An old, blind Jew asked a young girl
what milk was like.
"Milk?" asked the girl, astonished.
"Yes, milk, You see, I'm blind and
I just cannot imagine what milk is
like."
"Well, milk is white."
"White..." said the old man. "I'm
old and blind. I just don't know what
white means."
"It's easy to explain," said the girl
brightly. "A swan is white."
"But I've never seen a swan."
"It has a curved neck."
"Curved?" sighed the old man.
"What is curved?"
The girl lifted her right arm, bent
her wrist forward like a swan's neck."
"Feel it," she said. "That's curved."
The old man felt the girl's arm,
touched the curved wrist several times
and then exclaimed with satisfaction:
"Thank God I Now at last I know
what milk is like."
Philosophers, like that helpful little
girl, keep telling us clever and true
. things about humour. She was right
and everything she said helped: milk
is white, and a swan is white and -
the swan has a curved neck. But in
the end, having read a whole library ^
about humour, we know as much about r

humour as the old man knew, in the
end, about milk. In other words: many
important and helpful details, except
one basic thing: what humour really is.
I should like to add just a few
observations to our knowledge of
important details before proceeding
to other subjects.
It is usually the grotesque, the
paradoxical, the funny which strikes
me in a situation where others per¬
haps see darkness and tragedy.
About 15 years ago I was writing my
first novel and Arthur Koestler whom
I have already mentioned asked me
what it was about. I told him it was
about a man who ate too much, whose
mortal passion was eating, who ate like
some others drink. "A good subject,"
he nodded. "A better one for Kafka
than for you but a good subject." He
only saw the tragic element in it.
I, while I hope I do not lack com¬
passion and understanding and while
I liked my hero and felt sympathy for
him, saw him as an essentially comic
character. After all, to eat yourself
to death is less tragic than dying, say,
a heroic death on the battlefield. Yes,
I often see the humour and fun where
others look at me quizzically and with
suspicion: what the hell is he laughing
about?
My sister had a bit of a great Slav
soul. I had a very happy childhood
and she had a tormented and unhappy
childhood but we both had the same
childhood. I had loving, devoted and
understanding parents while she had
harsh, strict and not devoted parents.
But we both had the same parents.
And this fact that humour is not
in the situation but in the beholder's
eye is the answer to the question
every humorous writer is often asked.
"How is it," people ask you, "that
all the funny things always happen to
you?" A humorist's life seems to be
an endless chain of hilarity while, they
add with dismay, nothing ever happens
to them.
Life is, of course, a long, happy Joke;
it is also a dark, horrible tragedy; or
endless boredom, ¡t depenas on you.
The only difference between the
humorist or rather between the man
with a strong sense of humour and
one utterly without it is that the former
notices the humour in all situations
while the other misses it.
It was G.K. Chesterton who gave
the perfect answer to this question
when he remarked, speaking to
humanity at large:
"You make the jokes; I see them."
Telling endless jokes without any
apropos can be an awful bore. Lis¬
tening to endless jokes is a pro¬
fessional hazard for a humorist.
Wherever I go, people keep telling me
jokes. It was Frederic Karinthy, the
great Hungarian humorist, who com¬
plained: "I cannot explain to people
that the humorist is the man who
is supposed to tell jokes and not the
man to whom you are supposed to
be telling jokes."
The joke is a minor art, with not
only literary but also with political
significance. A joke which has a point
not only the point of a joke but some
point of telling it in the circumstances
can be more revealing than many a
long lecture.
Jokes have special significance in
tyrannies. They are brief; they can be
whispered from ear to ear in a few
seconds; and by making fun of the
tyrant they bring him down to a human
level, showing that the great man is
nothing more than an erring, frightened
and stupid human being, like the rest
of us, and that's the one thing no
tyrant's reputation can bear for long.
The joke has never received its
proper due. It has been analysed by.
Freud and others as a psychological
phenomenon but never as a literary
one. It would deserve some attention
but it must, inevitably, remain a minor
art. Why minor? For three main
reasons.
1. Humour must always take second
place behind tragedy. This does not
mean that great humorous writers, like
Mark Twain, lag behind silly serious
writers. Of course not; they are much
greater. But if you take Shakespeare
himself, his great tragediesKing
Lear or Hamlet are greater, master¬
pieces than his excellent comedies,

From the days when the ancient Egyptians
used hieroglyphic typewriters to caption
their obelisks, words have always caused
problems. Some people just drop their
aitches instead of minding their p's and q's;
as for others whole words escape them.
The Merchant of Venice or the Taming
of the Shrew.
2. The joke. is one dimensional, while
life is complex and multifarious so it
just cannot cope.
3. There may be beauty in a short
piece of art say, in a Japanese poem
but there can be no development,
no construction.
It was Ferenc Molnár, the playwright,
who encouraged his friend, the Aus¬
trian, Alfred Polgar, to write longer
pieces and not to stick to his excellent
epigrams, paradoxes, very short obser¬
vations. Polgar thought this advice
over and rejected it. That's the form
which suited him, he would stick to
it. Molnár shrugged his shoulders.
"Very well", he said, "then you will
remain the world champion of the one-
yard sprint."
Yes, the joke as a form of art is
the one-yard sprint.
Is there such a thing as a national
humour? Of course there is. The
speciality of the English, for example,
is understatement. A man is swept
into the water from a Channel boat. A
tremendous gale is lashing moun- ;
tainous seas. The man's head emerges
just once from the water. He being
a proper Englishman shouts at the
people on the boat, not excitedly of
course, just loud enough to be heard:
"Rather windy, isn't it?" That's
understatement.
Or take this scrap of dialogue from
the pen of the English writer and
humorist, P.G. Wodehouse:
you seen Mr. Fink-Nottle,"Have
Jeeves?"
"No, sir."
"I am going to murder him."
"Very good, sir."
Understatement is not simply a
manner of making jokes; in England it
is also a way of life. When the
Englishman leaves his house in pouring
rain, all he will say, passing his neigh¬
bour, is: "It's not so nice, is it?" The
whole rhythm of life in England is
understatement. The underreaction to
everything, the polite word instead of
the rude outburst.
I could go on analysing such unlikely
national humours as the Greek or the
Swiss. I have given considerable time
trying to understand the Chinese, and
even more, the Japanese sense of
humour. I failed. In our European
arrogance we are inclined to believe
that they have no sense of humour
just because it is so different from
ours. Well, I am not sure.
All I can say now, in conclusion, is
this: yes, there is such a thing as
national sense of humour. As long
as there are national characteristics,
they will manifest themselves also in
national humour. How long this will
last in a world which is steadily
becoming duller and more uniform, no
one can tell.
Does then, national humour exist?
It does. There is a less frequently,
asked but perhaps more interesting p

question to pose: is there such a thing
as international humour? Does hu¬
mour, cari * humour travel across
international boundaries?
Many people maintain that it does
not and cannot. This statement,
however, just is not true. People laugh
at the same jokes all over the world.
Having said it, I hasten to qualify, and
enlarge upon, this statement.
Educated people laugh at the same
things and uneducated or less edu¬
cated people also laugh at the same,
though different, things.
This does not mean that educated
people will not laugh at the man who
slips on a banana skin or has custard
pie thrown into his face. This banana-
skin or custard-pie humour releases
such atavistic feelings of fear and
aggression that all barriers of edu¬
cation fall to the ground like the walls
of Jericho. We may be thoroughly
ashamed of our low taste; but we shall
laugh.
There are certain other types of
jokes and certain types of humour
which are far below the level of some
people and far above the level of some
others. The education barrier is more
difficult to cross than the national
barrier.
Some jokes are not only international
but pretty ageless. Some crop up at
various places in different centuries.
Sometimes they are cleaned up,
modernized, dusted, put into a new
guise but they do come back. Jokes
born at the time of the post-World
War I German inflation reappeared
half a century later in Brazil or Italy;
jokes told against regimes in, say,
Greece or Chile, were already told
against Hitler, against Napoleon III or
even against Caligula.
So I can emphatically repeat that
humour does not respect national
frontiers. This, however, does not
mean that jokes and humour travel
more easily than, say, wine. Some
wines do not travel at all; many people
detest Retzina, others would not touch
anything else; others again do not
like wine at all, and so on. Similarly,
the popularity of jokes depends on
many factors:, the national .mood;
people's individual sense of humour;
education; momentary painful problems
or euphoria; taste, etc.
But the foundation is there: humour
can travel and in many cases does
travel. It is not easier to establish
true internationalism in humour than
in anything else. No, on second
thoughts, I think it Is easier: people,
after all, are more inclined to laugh
than to make political concessions.
So make laugh(ter) not war.
George Mikes
