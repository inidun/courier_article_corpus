Natural hazards originate
from the air (storms, wildfires,
droughts), the earth (earthquakes,
landslides, volcanic eruptions) or
water (flooding).
When communities cannot cope
with them they turn into disasters.

Earthquakes
Small quakes happen every day all over the
world. Large ones, which are rarer, can cause
more damage than floods and severe storms.
Earthquakes are dangerous because they strike
without warning, trigger disaster in less than a
minute and forecasts of their effects are difficult.
Undersea earthquakes can generate tsunami
flood waves which can have effects at great dis¬
tances. Buildings and communities near active
earth-fault zones, or on soft or unstable soil
or slopes, or at the water's edge are especially
vulnerable to ground shaking, earthquake-trig¬
gered fires and tsunamis. Some recent earth¬
quake disasters:
« Kobe Qapan), 1 7 January 1995. This 6.9 mag
nitude1 tremor was the world's most costly
earthquake disaster, with losses of about $140
billion. Centred 20 km from Kobe, it struck
just before dawn and destroyed 200,000 homes,
set off 600 fires, put the city's port out of oper¬
ation, severely damaged the Hanshin elevated
expressway, and left 6,000 dead and 34,000
injured.
w Northridge, California (U.S.A.), 17 Janu¬
ary 1994. Also striking before dawn, this 6.8
magnitude quake affected 3.5 million people
and led to the highest earthquake insurance pay¬
out in history more than $13 billion in claims.
Its centre was 20 km from downtown Los
Angeles and damage was estimated at $40 billion.
It damaged parts of the elevated freeway sys¬
tem, left 50,000 people homeless and 15,000
injured. Sixty-one people were killed.
«- Spitak (Armenia), 7 December 1988. A 6.9
magnitude earthquake in mid-morning, it
demonstrated the well-known weakness of unre-
inforced old buildings. But many new reinforced
concrete buildings collapsed too, among them
schools and hospitals. Some 25,000 people were
killed and reconstruction cost $16 billion.
'*" Mexico, 19 September 1985. Its epicentre was
400 km (240 miles) from Mexico City, but its
magnitude (8.1) brought down 400 government
buildings, hospitals, schools, businesses and
high-rise apartment blocks in the old lake bed
area of the city. Between 5,000 and 1 0,000 peo¬
ple were killed and losses were estimated at $5
billion.
<*- Tangshan (China), 28 July 1976. A 7.8 mag¬
nitude quake which struck in the middle of the
night while most of the million people living
and working in this industrial and coal-mining
centre in northern China were asleep. The city
mostly unreinforced buildings was devas¬
tated. At least 240,000 people died and 800,000
were injured. Reconstruction took more than
a decade.
1 The Richter scale is widely used to express the
magnitude of an earthquake by the quantity of energy
released. The highest value yet registered is 9.5. Editor

Droughts
Droughts may be annual or may occur once
every few years. They can last for many years,
devastating agriculture and creating deserts.
Two major droughts:
* The Sahel (Africa), 1969-73. From 1968,
a lengthy drought in West Africa extended
across the Sahara Desert southwards in the
Sahel countries of Mauritania, Senegal, Mali,
Burkina Faso and Chad. It was no worse
than many previous ones, but 250,000 peo¬
ple died and millions of refugees poured
into cities. Millions of head of livestock
died. Farm production dropped sharply.
The "Dust Bowl," Mid-Western U.S.,
1930s. This 10-year drought spread across
the entire Great Plains from North Dakota
to Texas. One dust storm in May 1934 car¬
ried hundreds of millions of tons of earth
for thousands of kilometres. In one day,
Chicago was covered with 12 million tons of
dust and distant New York City had many
gloomy, dusty days. Wheat and corn pro¬
duction fell by up to 75%. Hundreds of
thousands of people fled the area for places
further west.

Floods
The most common natural hazard, mainly
caused by flash floods after very heavy rain or
from melting ice and snow. Towns and villages
on the coast or in river plains are most at risk.
Floods cause property damage, social disruption
and health care problems and damage the envi¬
ronment (mainly soil erosion and pollution).
Some major recent floods:
*- The U.S. Midwest in April 1997 and the east¬
ern U.S. in January 1996. Heavy snowfall and
then a rapid thaw along with heavy rain flooded
North Dakota in 1997 and river valleys from
New York to Philadelphia to Virginia in 1996.
More than 100,000 people, including entire
communities, were evacuated. Losses exceeded
$2 billion mainly damage to buildings, infra¬
structure, dams and bridges.
*" Italy, 4-5 November 1966. After many hours
of rain, the River Arno burst its banks. Florence
was soon under five metres of water. Moving at
more than 130 km/hour, the flood made 12,000
people homeless, inundated more than 5,000
homes, destroyed some 10,000 cars and the
contents of half the city's shops, knocked out
the electricity, water and sewage systems and
destroyed bridges. Worst of all, oil from bro¬
ken oil tanks mixed with nearly a million tons
of mud and ruined more than a million art
treasures.
Tsunamis
These are usually set off by undersea earth¬
quakes and can travel across oceans at the speed
of a jet airliner, smashing into coastal towns
and villages with waves 30 metres high.
On 22 May 1960, a 9.5 magnitude undersea
earthquake set off a tsunami which destroyed
I 400,000 houses along 1,000 km of coastline,
| leaving 5,000 people dead. The ground shook for
g three and a half minutes and subsided as much
I as two metres. Tsunamis with waves as high as
¡ 10 metres affected every Pacific rim country,
| damaging ships, flooding coastal areas and
g destroying buildings and factories.

Landslides
These occur daily all over the world and are
caused either by heavy rains or earthquakes. A
big quake can can set off tens of thousands of
landslides of all sizes.
One such disaster occurred in Peru, on 31
May 1970, when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake
centred 25 km off Chimbóte, on the north
coast of Peru, caused Latin America's biggest
recorded landslide. A mass of ice 5,500 metres up
Mt Huascaran was dislodged and in three min¬
utes had slid down a glacier and travelled another
1 0 km to bury the towns of Yungay and Ran-
rahirca, killing all but 400 of their 20,000 inhab¬
itants. In Chimbóte, 96% of the town's adobe
houses were destroyed by ground tremors and
more than a thousand people killed.

(September 1988).
Hurricanes, cyclones,
typhoons and tornadoes
These tend to be seasonal and confined to cer¬
tain parts of the world. Coastal settlements are
most at risk. Physical damage and social dis¬
ruption are caused by high winds, storm surge
floods, very heavy rain, beach and coastal ero¬
sion, lightning and hail.
Notable storm disasters in recent years:
*" East Pakistan and Bay of Bengal, 12-13
November 1970. Winds of up to 240 km/hr
and a storm surge flood killed about 596,150
people in Bangladesh. More than four million
people were affected, 335,000 houses damaged
and 264,000 head of cattle killed.
« Bangladesh, 30 April 1991. A typhoon
whipped up an eight-metre storm surge which
hit the city of Chittagong after midnight, leav¬
ing 10 million people homeless, some 200,000
dead and 139,000 injured. More than 1.5 mil¬
lion buildings were damaged. An early warn¬
ing system, evacuation and the use of cyclone
shelters meant that casualties were fewer than in
the 1970 disaster.
m The Caribbean, 10 September 1988. Hurri¬
cane Gilbert, dubbed "the storm of the cen¬
tury", hit the eastern Caribbean and caused
unprecedented devastation as it swept across
Guadeloupe, Martinique, St Lucia, Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and
Mexico. A fifth of all the houses in Jamaica were
destroyed or badly damaged by high winds and
half a million Jamaicans were left homeless.
Banana plantations, coffee trees and food crops
were ruined by flooding, winds and landslides.
Surprisingly few lives were lost but economic
losses were more than a billion dollars.

Volcanic eruptions
The world's 500 active volcanoes erupt infre¬
quently, but when they do, the effects can be
devastating. Nearby towns can be affected by
clouds of volcanic ash (which can also seriously
threaten aircraft in the area), lateral blasts, pyro-
clastic flows of red-hot rocks and gases, lava
flows and lahars (debris flows). A major explo¬
sive eruption can affect the world's climate.
Notable volcano disasters include:
*" Mt. Pinatubo, in the Philippines, 15-16 June
1991. This was the biggest volcanic eruption of
the century. It lasted 15 hours and sent ash 30
km into the sky and set off pyroclastic flows
and lahars. More than 200,000 people, including
those at the U.S. Clark Air Force Base, were
evacuated the largest-ever evacuation before a
volcanic eruption. Typhoon Yunya passing 50
km to the north added to the disaster. Because
of the evacuation, the death toll was limited to
320, but the region was economically devas¬
tated. Strategic military alliances were altered
by the eruption as the Clark base was
abandoned.
'*" Nevado del Ruiz (Colombia), 13 November
1985. After being dormant for 140 years, the
volcano erupted and hot pyroclastic material
melted the mountain's ice cap and set off lahars.
These travelled at 30 km/hr along four river
beds to the towns of Armero and Chinchina.
The debris buried the towns late at night, killing
24,740 people, injuring 5,485 and destroying
5,680 homes.
** Agung (Bali), 1963. Two violent eruptions
in March and May generated a huge hot ash
cloud and set off lahars, which killed 1,148 peo¬
ple and injured 296. Seventy-three villages were
destroyed, leaving 70,000 people homeless and
400,000 destitute. They also destroyed 54,289
hectares of farmland and 1 1,745 hectares, of for¬
est and swept away bridges and roads.
Wildfires
Thousands of wildfires flare up every year
around the world, threatening towns and vil¬
lages. Many are caused by hot, dry summers
and set off by lightning. Others are started by
lava flows or triggered by earthquakes. A few are
the result of arson.
One recent major wildfire disaster occurred


in Great Khingan Range (China), on 6 May
I 1987. Fanned by high winds for 20 days, the
| fires burned down 750,000 cubic metres of for-
| est over a million hectares 13% of the total
| forested area or a fifth of the annual timber
¡ production of the region. The fire killed 191
| people.
