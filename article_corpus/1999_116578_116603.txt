I N T E RV E N T I O N :
A CONTROVERSIAL RIGHT

The crisis in Kosovo has fuelled the debate between supporters and opponents of the right of
humanitarian intervention. The contributions below were made at the beginning of June 1999

The term “ ri g h t ” or “ d u t y ” o f
“ i n t e rvention”—to which the wo r d
“ h u m a n i t a ri a n ” was soon added—wa s
coined in the late 1980s by Mario Bettat i ,
Professor of Intern ational Public Law at the
U n i ve rsity of Pa ris II, and by the French
politician Bernard Kouchner, one of the
f o u n d e rs of the aid organization Médecins
sans frontières (Doctors without Borders ) .
As Kouchner put it, they were taking
issue with “the old-fashioned theory of stat e
s ove r e i g n t y, used to fend off criticism of
m a s s a c r e s.”The idea caught on quickly,
especially with the emergence of a new
world order in which values like democracy,
the rule of law and respect for human ri g h t s
were supposed to be top pri o ri t i e s.The need
to help peoples in distress would mean that
e ve ryone had a “duty to assist a people in
d a n g e r ” which would ove rride the
traditional legal rules.
Despite the generous intentions of its
advocates, the fuzziness of such a right
immediately raised questions and even
criticism. Was it simply a moral right or
was it a principle to be incorporated into
international law? For centuries, interna-
tional law has been based on the soverei-
gnty of the state.As a result,a state is only
bound by a legal obligation—especially by
an obligation to protect human rights—if
it has agreed to it by ratifying a treaty or
by adhering to an existing customary
rule. Human rights have widely varying
legal status all over the world,and persons
are better protected in some countries
than in others.
A challenge 
to sovereignty
S overeignty also means that a coun-
t ry which has violated human rights can-
not be prosecuted unless it accepts or
has accepted the authority of a court .
Except by going through regional bodies
such as the European Court of Human
Rights and the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights, it is thus ve ry hard to get
a gove rnment convicted of human ri g h t s
v i o l ations by an intern ational court . A n d
e ven if a conviction is obtained, there is
no way of guaranteeing the sentence will
be carried out. S overeignty has prove d

incompatible with the existence of a kind
of worldwide “international police force”.
The doctrine of “the right to interve-
ne” is an attempt to challenge this tradi-
tional legal structure by calling into ques-
tion the very concept of sovereignty it is
based on.The power of the state, it says,
must yield to a “principle of extreme
urgency”—the need for a minimum pro-
tection of human rights.
H u m a n i t a rian aid must therefore be
d e l i vered without regard to nat i o n a l
f r o n t i e rs , or whether or not a country
has pledged to respect a ru l e , the juri s-
diction of a court or the powe rs of an
i n t e rn ational police force. It is no longer
tenable to bow to legal formalism which,
as Kouchner say s , is tantamount to
accepting that it could be “ p e rm i s s i b l e ,
albeit discreditable, to massacre one’s
own people.”
M a ny legal experts have strongly cri-
ticized the view of traditional intern at i o-
nal law held by support e rs of the right to
i n t e rve n e . F i rs t , under no circumstances
can a gove rnment claim it is “ l aw f u l ” t o
massacre its own population on the
grounds that eve rything that goes on insi-
de the country is an “ i n t e rnal mat t e r ” .
All states have formally agreed that they
should respect fundamental ri g h t s , s u c h
as the right to life and respect for the
p hysical pers o n , and that genocide is
u n l awful as far as their own people are
c o n c e rned and therefore on their ow n
t e rri t o ry. They decided in “a sove r e i g n
m a n n e r ” to respect these pri n c i p l e s , s o
they must respect them in a sove r e i g n
manner too.
Where a massive violation occurs ,
retaliatory measures and reprisals can be
taken in political, diplomatic, economic
and financial ways. An embargo, even
without United Nations interve n t i o n ,
could be envisaged against a state or a
group which is violating a people’s most
basic rights. Such a measure, quite a for-
midable one, has been used against cer-
tain states, including Argentina at the
time of the Falklands war, the Soviet
Union after its military intervention in
Afghanistan and more recently against
Haiti and Burundi in response to coups
d’état in those countries.
The United Nations Security Council
can also declare that massive violations of
human rights are a threat to “ i n t e rn at i o n a l
peace and securi t y ” and duly authori z e
m i l i t a ry intervention (article 42 of the
United Nations Charter). It has done this
on several occasions (see box ) . So on closer
i n s p e c t i o n , most of the operations pre-
sented as arising from “the right of huma-
n i t a rian interve n t i o n ” are actually applica-
tions of existing legal mechanisms. It is
quite wrong to say that traditional inter-
national law is incompatible with effective
protection of human ri g h t s. In fact the pro-
blem is usually more political than legal, i n
the sense that what is needed is not new
rules but the better use of existing ones.
These political obstacles, e s p e c i a l l y
the right to exercise a veto in the Security
Council, mean that nobody is going to
claim international law is perfectly ade-
quate to protect human rights. But despi-
te the system’s shortcomings, many ana-
lysts think that it is less bad than one that
would include a broad right of humanita-
rian intervention.
The principle of non-intervention is
the result of a historic battle waged by the
weakest countries. Throughout the 19th
century, they were subjected to colonia-
lism and imperialism, which also made
themselves out to be defending “civilized”
values. On many occasions, the humani-
tarian argument was used to justify mili-
tary action by Western states against the
Ottoman Empire, as well as in Africa and
the Far East.
The United Nations Charter did not
put an end to such practices, but at least
it gave countries that were attacked the
opportunity to invoke the law to oppose
the use of force. A return to a situation
where there was a right to interve n e
which could, hypothetically, involve sides-
tepping UN decisions, would mean the
world’s most powerful states could set
themselves up as sole judges of what
humanity supposedly needs. Once again,
might would be right.
Colonial memories
The question of double standards is
often raised.How can one claim an action
is humanitarian if it clearly arises from
considerations of realpolitik, which are the
only possible explanation why some states
that violate the most basic human rights
Under no circumstances can a government claim
it is ‘lawful’ to massacre its own population
on the grounds that everything that goes on inside 
the country is an ‘internal matter’

are let off the hook? The Palestinian situa-
tion is the one most often cited in this res-
pect. This probably points to the funda-
mental problem raised by the “right to
intervene”—that it is not clearly defined.
M a rio Bettati (see below) illustrat e s
this ambiguity when he defines “the ri g h t
to interve n e ” largely in terms of opposi-
tion to a restri c t i ve , ri gid interp r e t ation of
s ove r e i g n t y. “The term just by itself has no
legal content,” he say s. “It only acquires
a ny when it is accompanied by the
a d j e c t i ve ‘ h u m a n i t a ri a n ’ . By virtue of the
p u rpose it gi ves to interve n t i o n , the adjec-
t i ve removes the unlawful aspect which
e ve ryone associates with it. A law ye r
would prefer the expression ‘ right to pro-
vide humanitarian assistance’, w h i c h
d e fines the purpose more clearly and
sounds less like a subjective and implicit
clash—which after all it isn’t—with the
anti-colonialist principles of ‘ n o n - i n t e r-
ve n t i o n ’ and ‘ n o n - i n t e r f e r e n c e .’ ”1
Ambiguities
And so it is hardly surp rising that this
d o c t ri n e , which might seem at t r a c t i ve in
t h e o ry, has led to and is still leading to
m a ny abuses in practice. The recent
example of the war in Kosovo may be seen
to embody all the ambiguities of a “ right to
i n t e rve n e ” e xe r c i s e d , in the name of the
i n t e rn ational community, by a coalition of
the wo r l d ’s biggest military powe rs. n
The Rwandan case:in 1994, France led Operation Turquoise to protect populations from the genocidal war tearing
the country apart.
