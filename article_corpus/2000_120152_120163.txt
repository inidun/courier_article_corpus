New York City, where the dream of danceflo o r
Utopia lives on and (in the words of one dance
music diva) “everybody’s free (to feel good)”.
At Body and Soul, DJs like Joe Claussel still
embody the determ i n ation to mix and mat c h — b o t h
styles of music and their audience—to remain aloof
from the machinations of the global entert a i n m e n t
gi a n t s , to find more in “club culture” than getting
high or getting paid. And it takes determ i n at i o n , f o r
over the past decade or so, “ d a n c e ” or “club cul-
ture”—based on electronic music and its deri va-
t i ves—has become an intern at i o n a l , m u l t i - m i l l i o n
dollar market despite the
e f f o rts of DJs like Claussel to
promote the dream of cultur-
al dive rs i t y, a rtistic indepen-
dence and unive rsal spiri t u a l-
i t y. For many of its devo t e e s ,
this club culture represents an
escape from the regi m e n t a-
tion of modern life and even a
r e t u rn to a pre-industri a l
pagan shamanistic utopia.
But before delving into
this global phenomenon, a
little history and vocabulary is called for.To begin
with, let’s deflate the generic use of the term
“techno” to describe anything with a thudding
electronic beat. Techno is actually one strand of
an ever-expanding genre generally called “elec-
tronic dance music”. A veritable cannibal, this
genre spawns a constant stream of variants as the
technological wizards, DJs, re-configure any kind
of music or sound—from a train whistle to the
chant of a Tibetan lama—within the thud-thud-
ding of a four-beats-to-a-bar rhythm. Two of the
major sub-genres are techno and house.
The club culture surrounding the music is in
some ways a reconfig u r ation of the disco era of the
m i d - t o - l ate 70s. All of us probably remember that
p e riod as one of poor taste and excess, symbolised in
the mainstream by John Tr avo l t a ’s white suit in the
A m e rican mov i e , S at u r d ay Night Fe ve r. But before
N o rth A m e ri c a ’s white, s u burban middle classes
adopted the commodified BeeGee’s S t ay i n ’A l i ve ve r-
sion of disco, the music was considered an offshoot of
funk and soul music. Commercial in aspirat i o n , ye s ,
bu t , at its best, fun and funky.D i s c o, under the pres-
sures of the “disco sucks”campaign (orchestrated by
disaffected rock fans) and the global over-exposure of
S at u r d ay Night Fe ve r,waned in popularity as the three
gr e at anti-commercial genres of popular music
e m e r g e d : reggae in Ja m a i c a , punk in the UK, h i p - h o p
in New York City. H owe ve r , the disco principle of
p l aying a smooth mix of long single records to keep
people “dancing all night long” l i ves on in the endless
stream of electronic dance music.
House music, in part i c u l a r , is often held up as a
kind of banner of cultural dive rsity owing to its ori-
gins in black and Latino discos,
where it first found its audience
(see p. 4 5 ) . One could point to
the 1980s, when A f rican A m e r-
ican producers / D J s , like Frankie
K n u c k l e s ,M a rshall Je f f e rson or
DJ Pierr e , began refining the all-
night dancefloor workouts at
u n d e r ground gay and mixe d
clubs in New York and Chicago,
like the legendary Wa r e h o u s e
from which house music deri ve s
its name. Or there is DJ Larry
L e va n , whose residence at New Yo r k ’s Pa r a d i s e
Garage not only defined a distinct sub-genre of its
own (“garage” is slower and more gospel ori e n t e d
than “house”) but set the tone for today ’s rave s1—
no alcohol,h e avy drug use, a mixe d ,“up for it crow d ”
and loud, p u l s ating music for 15-hour stretches with-
out a break.

E l e c t ronic dance music is constantly spawning new strands 
of music like techno and acid house. Behind the thudding beats,
communities of DJs and dancers try to stay one step ahead of

1. In the 1970s,Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans
colloquially used the word “rave” to mean “party” or “have
fun”. In 1987/88,UK youth began calling large, often
unlicensed parties “raves”. DJs play through the night at
these events which can attract thousands of paying
participants.
For many of its devotees,
this club culture
re p resents an escape fro m
the regimentation 
of modern life and even 
a return to a pre - i n d u s t r i a l
pagan shamanistic utopia.

At the same time, in the post-industrialising con-
crete jungle of Detroit (Michigan), t e c h n o, a cooler,
more futuristic form of house—intensely laye r e d
r hy t h m s , often pierced by machine noises and recon-
figured over diva - vocals—emerged from a cross-Atlantic
dialogue between yo u n g, radical A f rican A m e ri c a n
p r o d u c e rs like Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May and
electronic Euro-pop, notably by Kraftwe r k , a Germ a n
e x p e rimental group of the 1970s.
By the mid-80s,a series of influential independent
record labels had appeared and the va rious strains of
N o rth A m e rican house, garage and techno we r e
e x p o rted to Europe, t ri g g e ring the rise of local va ri a n t s
and scenes.Which kinds of music were adopted where
is a story in itself.B ri e fly,wa rm e r ,more gospel-ori e n t e d
house music found a ready audience in Italy.N o rt h e rn
E u r o p e ,H o l l a n d ,B e l gium and Germ a ny proved fer-
tile ground for cold, hard techno, which those coun-
t ri e s ’ own electronic traditions had a hand in cre-
at i n g .H owe ve r , the UK took the lead in adopting and
adapting the new U. S .s o u n d s. Each va riant found a
B ritish audience: soul- and gospel-tinged house wa s
adopted by “ s o u l ” fa n s , while techno drew devo t e e s
from rock and even punk.
In 1987 a group of British DJs and pleasure-
seekers, enjoying the traditional British sun’n’fun
holiday on the Spanish island of Ibiza (a leg-
endary spot on the hippie trial, with a casual atti-
tude to drugs) discovered a potent mix. They
found that the empathy-generating drug MDMA
(aka ecstasy, “E”) proved the perfect accompani-
ment to a night in the clubs dancing to the new,
wobbly, futuristic sound of “acid house” (a vari-
ant of American house). On returning to rainy
England, these DJs tried to “recapture” the Ibiza
feeling by starting their own clubs and holding
unlicensed “acid house parties”, the prototype of
the “rave”. They began re-creating the feel of a
holiday club in the sun by taking over disused
warehouses or railway arches where an older mid-
20s crowd had an ecstatically good time.
The parties thundered on for about a ye a r
before parents and police panicked over their
“amoral” and illicit dimensions.The media had a
field day sensationalising the rave s ’ dangerous rep-
utations,which,of course,heightened their attrac-
tion for thrill-seeking teenagers. As the chill of the
B ritish winter set in, acid house parties went furt h e r
underground to escape police interference but by
summer 1989, they re-surfaced outside metropol-
itan areas, in leisure centres, rural wa r e h o u s e s ,e ve n
fie l d s.The scene mushroomed: one eve n t ,S u n ri s e ,
reputedly attracted 10,000 participants.
Within about five ye a rs of “the birth of the
r ave ” , the UK gove rnment passed a series of pro-
h i b i t i ve laws to crack down on the eve n t s. T h e
C riminal Justice Act of 1994, for example, p r ov i d e d
the police with sweeping powe rs to squelch any
e vent feat u ring amplified repetitive beat s. But the
repression had contrasting effects. F i rs t , by dri v i n g
the events further undergr o u n d , it actually spurr e d
their politicisation with the so-called DiY (Do it
Yo u rself) aesthetic: organise events out of a com-
mitment to independence and explicitly anti-
c o n s u m e rist political action. DiY rave rs were no
longer just organising dance events but musical
protests around environmental and social justice
i s s u e s. Groups like the legendary Spiral Tribe also
began spreading the “ g o s p e l ” of punk-like resis-
tance across the European continent by helping to
kick off “ Te k n i va l s ”( t e c h n o - f e s t i vals) in France and
G e rm a ny. Similar groups had a hand in deve l o p i n g
the major European Te c h n i val circuit, which now
includes one of the wo r l d ’s biggest part i e s : B e r l i n ’s
L ove Pa r a d e , which attracted an estimated 1.5 mil-
lion reve l l e rs from across Europe in 1999.
Europe’s biggest party, the Berlin Love Parade.

At the same time, l e gi s l ation also led crowds to
r e t u rn to licensed nightclubs.The late 1990s gave ri s e
to “super clubs”,with rationalised administration and
marketing strat e gi e s. Clubs such as the Ministry of
Sound in London and Cream in Live rpool are hugely
p r o fitable bu s i n e s s e s ,flying in the latest “star DJs” t o
p l ay in a tightly controlled and regulated at m o s p h e r e .
O t h e rs , like Home and Gat e c r a s h e r , are export i n g
their branded goods (like t-shirts and records) ove r-
s e a s. Home even opened a club in Sydney (Australia).
Yet despite this commercial explosion, t h e
dream of club culture’s democratising power lives
on, particularly in how the music is produced and
c o n s u m e d . The entertainment industry has con-
ventionally followed a “ r o c k ”m o d e l , which relies on
bands signing long-term recording contracts with
record labels (production and distri bution compa-
nies) so they can afford to record an album of songs
in an expensive,commercial studio.The label then
sends the band out to promote the album by play-
ing live concerts in large venues.
Copyright chaos
Dance music has shaken up this model.
Instead of hiring and promoting an entire band of
musicians, the club and recording industries have
the much easier and affordable task of signing
and managing individual DJs who “play” the ever
more affordable digital equipment produced by
companies such as Roland of Japan and
Sequential Circuits of the U.S.With drum boxes
and synthesizers, technological wizards mimic
musical instruments. By “sampling” (a form of
digital copying), they can digitally record and
manipulate any sound, thereby throwing copy-
right law (and its principles of originality) into a
disarray from which it has yet to recover.
Creative individuals without musical training
and only rudimentary electronic know-how can
now produce dance music on their personal com-
puters with programmes like Cubase. Using digi-
tal equipment, a “track” (not a “song”) can be
composed, produced and mixed entirely by the
DJ/producer.
Although digital production is the standard in
house music, vinyl (records), as opposed to digi-
tal forms like CD, still predominate in clubs. DJs
seem to prefer the immediate tactile advantages
offered by the old “needle-on-the-record” that
allows special forms of manipulation (“scratch-
ing” records while rewinding and fast-forwarding
by hand to taunt and titillate the audience).
Turntables also seem to produce a warmer sound
than CD players. However, many local scenes,
such as those in Portugal or Belgrade (see p.43),
lack vinyl pressing plants and must rely on
imported vinyl from New York or London.
M a ny artists would like to remain indepen-
dent and set up their own labels, sometimes eve n
d i s t ri buting their products from the DJ booth of a
club or delive ring by car to specialist record shops.
H owe ve r , if that recording does become a hit, t h e
a rtist will soon need substantial investment to sup-
ply demand. Therefore artists are forced to do
deals with either independent or “ m a j o r ” d i s t ri b-
ution groups or to sell the track outright to a
record company. In this way, e ven independently
produced music is incorp o r ated into the global
music market.
While digital technology may have opened up
new possibilities for independent production,o b v i-
ously not everyone has equal access. For the vast
majority of the world’s population this technology
is economically out of reach and overwhelmingly
c o n c e n t r ated in the U. S , We s t e rn Europe and
Japan.Even in the West,the majority of producers
and DJs are male in keeping with social codes. E ve n
when female DJs do achieve a degree of “respect”
from club crow d s , they are marketed as sexual icons
in music magazines rather than technically com-
petent producers.When I mention my experience in
an electronic dance music group (as a progr a m m e r
and keyboard playe r ) , the first question I often hear
is:“Were you a singer?”
In the global loops of music production and
distribution, dance or club cultures are taking
root from Sao Paolo to Tel Aviv across a wide
political and cultural spectrum.Yet the spread has
done little to shift uneven power distribution;
Western global cities continue to dominate along
with the five major record companies which con-
trol distribution and abide by the stubborn dis-
tinctions of gender and class.We cannot help but
ask, “Is everybody equally welcome at this global
party?”We must question the diva quoted earlier:
Is everybody really “free to feel good”? ■

Could it be the “home studio” of one of the world’s best-paid DJs, Fatboy Slim?
