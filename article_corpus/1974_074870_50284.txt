MAGDALINA STANCHEVA is one oí the leading archaeologists and
philologists of Bulgaria. Head of the Archaeological Department of the
Historical Museum in Sofia for the past twenty years, she has carried out
investigations at all the major archaeological sites in her country. For her
pioneer work on Serdica (the ancient Roman name for Sofia) she was
awarded the Sofia Prize.
Above, model of the ancient Roman
citadel of Serdica. Ruins of
Serdica's forum were discovered
in 1971 in the heart of Sofia, capital
of Bulgaria, during the construction
of an underground pedestrian pas¬
sageway. Arrowed sign indicates
the site of the pedestrian subway.

I|T grows but does not
grow old." This motto, displayed on
the arms of Sofia, capital of Bulgaria,
is an apt description of the evolution
of that ancient city in the heart of the
Balkans which continues to modernize
and look to the future while preserving
its 7,000 years-old links with the past.
The central part of the city, which is
still in the process of change above
ground, extends over the buried
remains of several civilizations, com¬
prising strata of ruined cities to a depth
of 10 metres.
From the now scarcely identifiable
traces of an ancient Thracian settle¬
ment to the vestiges of later cultures,
the whole of this archaeological
complex records the troubled history
of a city often besieged by invaders
and destroyed several times.
Lying at the crossroads of the
Balkans peninsula, set in a fertile well-
watered plain surrounded by mountains
and forests filled with game, and famed
for its mineral springs and baths, Sofia
has often paid dearly for its privileged
situation.
The "heart" of the city is still the
same: it is the Forum of the Roman
town of Serdica, the centre of medieval
Bulgarian Sredets and the main
square of the Sofia liberated less than
a century ago from foreign domination
a square today named after Lenin.
Every epoch built on the ruins of the
past and each layer of ruins left its
mark. Little by little, century after
century, reality fused with legend.
An unusual subway has been built in
Sofia. To cross the busy central
square, the pedestrian has to go thirty-
five steps down below the ground.
Nothing above ground could lead one

to guess the extraordinary surprise
awaiting the passer-by who for the first
time goes down the granite steps
flanked by marble walls, under the
bright lights of a glass and aluminium
ceiling.
At the foot of the steps, he enters
the hall of what appears to be a
museum of archaeology. At the
entrance he passes through the main
east gate through the wall of the
ancient fortifications which defended
the city for more than twelve centuries.
The gate, built of great limestone
blocks, now stands hospitably open.
It originally had two metal doors which
were closed at the onslaught of in¬
vaders. Its pentagonal towers on
either side, built of red brick upon a
plinth of large stone blocks, formed
part of the 6th century wall that en¬
circled the citadel. When they were

built, the towers were about 10 metres
high. Today their ruins reach the
ceiling of the hall at a height of about
four metres.
Behind these fortifications the ruins
of another wall, built in alternating
layers of stone and brick, were also
unearthed. Fortifications and wall are
both four metres thick. It is not by
chance that Serdica's fortress was
claimed to be impregnable and that
only a long siege could force the city's
defenders to open its gates.
The second wall dates from the time
of Constantine (4th century) but an
inscription cut in a great stone slab
displayed in the hall indicates that
Serdica also had a defensive wall as
early as the 2nd century, at the time of
the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. These
fortifications protected the city even
after its occupation by the Slavs and
inclusion in Bulgaria in the 9th century,
but were destroyed in 1382 when the
Turks besieged and captured Sredets,
as it was known by that time.
The outer gate leads to an enclosed
space in which are entrances to the
towers, well preserved up to their
arches. There is an inner gate on the
opposite side of the enclosure. On
the threshold of both gates traces of
the ruts left by the passage over many
centuries of innumerable iron-rimmed
wheels of carts and patricians' chariots
are still visible.
The small court between the two
gates is paved with thick stone slabs.
Most of them are parts of the magni¬
ficently ornamented cornices and
architraves, with their sculptured sides
face downwards. They once adorned
the facades of buildings and porticos
around the forum of Serdica.
The Roman city, which grew and
prospered in the second to fourth
centuries, was devastated in the fifth
century by the Goths, the Huns and
other invaders. In the sixth century,
under Justinian, the city regained its
importance, but during the vicissitudes
of the ensuing centuries much of its
magnificence was to be trampled under
foot and buried. Today men of the
20th century are again walking on the
original stone slabs.
The finds were not unexpected,
because archaeologists had the plan
of the ancient lay-out of the city, and
parts of the old fortifications had

Passage to Serdica
Stepping down one of the four
entrances to the subway (above)
pedestrians find themselves
among the amphoras, mosaics
and sculpted reliefs of the world
of antiquity. Going along the
passage, they can follow the
ancient road through Roman
Serdica from the citadel gate to
the forum (above right) treading
on the original paving stones,
still well preserved. Right, a
carved stone slab of the 4th
century A.D., representing circus
games with riders, wild animals
and their keepers. The slab,
which may have once decorated
Serdica's Circus, is now in the
Sofia Archaeological Museum.

already been explored before work on
the subway began.
But as soon as the work of excava¬
tion started, archaeologists realized
that the old east gate would be
unearthed in an exceptionally good
state, considering that the town had
been destroyed and rebuilt so many
times. So it was decided to modify
the course originally planned for the
passage and to allow more time and
money for its construction.
The finds which came to light are
now preserved in the passage hall.
They surpass in their monumental
structure and archaeological signifi¬
cance all earlier discoveries, proving
that the effort was well worthwhile.
Special laws for the protection of
cultural property and painstaking
efforts by archaeologists working
closely with architects produced a bold
and original solution that reconciles
urban modernization with the needs of
cultural preservation.
The citizens of Sofia have taken the
habit of using the passage. Hurrying
.along the ancient way, some heed¬
lessly pass between the massive ruined
walls. Others stop to telephone in
The Roman tower
in the
bargain basement
Do you know a department store where
half the floor space in the basement is
taken by the ruins of an ancient Roman
tower? The inhabitants of Sofia do.

huge whale, the base of one of the triang¬

the glass and metal booths. Amid
snatches of conversation and laughter,
life moves on at a modern pace...
But for the newcomer the subway is
a fascinating step backwards into
history. Blow-up photos of the exca¬
vations show interesting details of the
archaeological monuments and help to
explain them. Niches in the walls
contain fragments of sculpture, original
mosaics and even a small altar de¬
dicated to Artemis by the priestess,
Rhodope.
From a small room, containing other
exhibits, one can see the inner side

of the fortified wall and the steps up
which the sentinels climbed. A relief
map shows the layout of ancient
Serdica.
There are also on display earth¬
enware containers out of which the
defenders of the citadel poured boiling
pitch onto the invaders. Nearby are
amphoras discovered in the ruins of a
small shop on the ancient way where
today souvenirs and post-cards are
sold from a small kiosk.
Constantly the visitor notices other
links between Sofia past and present.
The vestiges of antiquity no longer
seem to be dead. Fittingly, Sofia's
coat of arms with its inscription, "It
grows but does not grow old," in¬
scribed between two olive branches,
has been placed on one of the walls.
The four quarters of the coat of arms
bear the ancient symbols of the city:
the image of Tyche, patron goddess of
cities, copied from a Serdica coin; the
magnificent 6th century basilica of
St. Sophia, which gave its name to the
city in the 14th century; the little
temple of Apollo Medicus incarnating
the beneficent thermal springs; and the
Vitosha mountains, their massive peaks
forming an unchanging back-drop to
the city.
Nearby is the great stone at one
time embedded in Serdica's gate above
the arch, still welcoming the visitor
with the traditional greeting, "Good
luck", inscribed above the names of
ancient emperors and governors.
