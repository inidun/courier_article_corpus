RADIO-ACTIVE ATOMS FOR EVERYDAY USE
WHEN America was discovered
in 1492 the first reaction of
the civilized world was
astonishment at the revelation that
so great a continent, so peopled
with strange tribes and so wealthy
in resources, had always been there,
quite unknown to Europeans. The
world suddenly became much larger
than anyone had thought and, far
from being fist, was soon shown to
be a globe when Magellan sailed
completely around it. Then came
the great stories of adventure and
exploration, which lasted for a
century. Then came settlements in
the new land, and colonies and
finally the great nations that now
comprise one-tenth of the human
race.
The history of most discoveries in
pure science is similar. First the
interest is philosophical and lies in
the further revelation of the
complexity and glory of nature.
Then it becomes an absorbing story
of conquest and understanding.
Finally the new knowledge becomes
useful and valuable to human living.
So it is with nuclear science.
The preceding articles in this
series have explained the funda-
mentals of the new knowledge of the
world within the atom. It remains
to discuss its uses which are already
large and diverse. Although they
are still in their infancy, they are
enough to prove that this is one of
the great discoveries of all time,
comparable to the invention of the
microscope and of the steam engine,
in its benefits to science and to
humanity.
But the most impressive, yet
terrible single use, and one which
cannot be ignored, is in military
explosives. This use is dominant in
the minds of men because of its
awful threat to humanity but, from
a broad point of view, it was a
development of only one aspect of
the new knowledge forced by
military necessity. It is an accident
of history that the discovery that
energy can be obtained from one
special type of atom came just at
the moment when the greatest war
of history began. But in the long
run the year 1939 may well be better
remembered for the discovery of
atomic energy than for the inception
of World War II..
The studies of nuclear structure
that have here been described all
involve the use of tremendous
energy concentrated in high-speed
particles in order to form a very
few tiny nuclear fragments. It is a
vast expenditure of energy with no
gain.
But there is one case in which an
atom, thus disintegrated by a colli-
sion with a neutron, gives out more
energy than it receives. That is the
case of the relatively little known
metals, uranium and thorium. It is
their excessive energy that can be
utilized for destruction. Whether or
not it will ever again be so used we
do not know, but it is quite certain
that it will be employed on a large
scale for peaceful purposes. An age
of atomic energy in industry lies
ahead, at least in those countries
that have no resources in coal or
petroleum.
One pound = 1, 500 tons
IT is now well known that onepound of uranium can yield as
much power or heat as 1, 500
tons of coal. But this does not mean
that energy from this source is
cheaper than energy from coal.
Even if the uranium cost nothing
at all, the cost of its energy would
still be high because of the very
large and expensive equipment that
i. s needed to generate it. Wherever
coal or oil are cheap, hence where-
ver they are close at hand, they wilJ
remain the chief source of industrial
power. But where coal is costly be-
cause it must be transported long
distances, atomic fuel is economical,
even now.
While the direct use of atomic
power is still in the future thre are
already literally thousands of
valuable uses for the rays and for
the materials that have been made
commonly available by the progress
of nuclear physics. Industry, agri-
culture, medicine and the biological
sciences are making large use of
them in the form of isotopes-those
WHEN DEALING with radio-active
chemicals on a laboratory scale,
a wall of two-inch-thick lead bricks
offers sufficient protection against
dangerous rays emanating from such
materials. More elaborate precau-
tions are needed in large scale
atomic energy plants. Here, at the
Atomic Energy Research Establish-
ment, Harwell, England, students see
a demonstration of how a chemical
can be put into an isotope container
with tongs. Lead containers are used
for the transportation of isotopes.

MOST ISOTOPES are stored in
liquid solutions. Technicians operate
by overhead mirror, behind two-foot
concrete wall (Radio-active waves shoot
sideways but not vertically). Bottles
are filled, packed and withdrawn by an
ingenious"master-slave"manipulator,
a remotely controlled device which
can duplicate the motion of a hand.

isotope will be shipped, is protected

elements that are not found in
nature but are produced by nuclear
collisions in the cyclotron or by
neutrons emitted by uranium in the
atomic furnaces.
More than 32, 000 shipments of
radio-active isotopes and more than
2, 000 shipments of non-radio-active,
or stable, isotopes have been made by
the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission
to more than a thousand institutions
in the U. S. A. and 1, 600 shipments of
radio-isotopes have been made to
some 350 institutions in 33 other
countries. Many industrial firms
and thousands of physicians the
world over are making daily practical
use of them.
Industrial applications
A typical industrial use of the rays
from these radio-active mate-
rials is in the automatic con-
trol of the production of thin sheets
of paper or plastic, or the metal for
making tin cans. As the sheet leaves
the rollers which squeeze it to the
desired thickness, it passes through
an instrument that holds a small
amount of radio-active material
under the sheet and holds a detect-
ing instrument, such as a Geiger
counter, over the sheet. The rays
penetrate the sheet and are received
and detected on the other side.
But if the sheet for some reason
becomes either thinner or thicker
than is desired the amount of
radiation received by the detecting
instrument instantly increases or
decreases as a result, because it is
partly absorbed in the sheet. Thus
the instrument is a constant and
automatic inspector of the thickness
and it can easily be adjusted to
regulate the rollers and correct the
error so as to produce a sheet of
uniform thickness.
Another example of the direct
industrial use of the radiations from
isotopes is the control of the flow
of oil through long pipe-lines. Such
a line can seldom be used for long
periods to deliver one single grade
or variety of oil. Instead, different
oils are pumped through, one after
another. It is important for the
operators at the receiving end to
know when one grade or one ship-
ment is at an end and another is
to begin in the continuous flow of
oil from the pipe.
This is now done by mixing in a
small quantity of radio-active oil at
the boundary between one batch and
another as they are pumped into the
pipe. When that radio-active oil
reaches the receiving station, per-
haps hundreds of miles away, the
radiation counters immediately
detect its arrival so that valves can
be adjusted to shift the flow from
one tank into another.
Another example from the oil
industry illustrates the use of
isotopes in research. The Shell
Petroleum Company in England now
measures friction and engine wear
by exposing a piston ring to bom-
bardment by neutrons until a small
part of the iron is converted to a
radioactive isotope. The ring is
then fitted in an operating engine..
As it wears by friction the debris
goes into the crank case oil and that
oil is then pumped through a
sensitive detector of radiation. The
very small quantity of weakly radio-
active iron is sufficient to be
measured and therefore to give an
immediate indication of the amount
of wear on the engine. This
method of testing avoids the long
operation of the engine and the
troublesome analysis of the oil for
iron, and can show the effect of
different lubricants within minutes.
The California Research Corpora-
tion reports that in similar resear-
ches a programme of friction studies
that would have taken 60 years and
cost a million dollars was completed
in this way in four years at a cost
of thirty-nave thousand dollars.
Others have employed this method
to show that high speed driving on
the open road causes
only about one-third of (Cont'd on

is involved in city driving. The end
result of these researches, however,
is the reduction of friction and the
improvement of lubrication.
The rays from radio-active isoto-
pes are also directly effective in
causing the luminescence of cry-
stalline materials used on watch
dials and on out-door signs. These
cheap isotopes have now replaced
expensive radium for this use, Ano-
ther application is in the ordinary
fluorescent tube. When isotopes are
mixed with the luminous material
they increase the conductivity of the
air in the tube so that it requires
less voltage to start the lamp and it
starts much more quickly. A similar
use is made of a tube of such ma-
terials, weakly radio-active, where
there is danger of sparks from static
electricity. The faint rays make
the air a sufficient conductor of
electricity so that static does not
accumulate.
For the future, one of the most
promising uses is likely to take the
form a semi-permanent low-power
electrical generator. One of the iso-
topes of strontium, spread on an
electrode in a vacuum tube, emits
electrons, hence emits negative elec-
tricity and itself becomes positively
charged. A voltage as high a. s
365, 000 volts has thus been obtained.
Experiments are in progress to uti-
lize this generation of electricity to
operate a small direct current mo-
tor which would require no other
source of power.
Bacteria-killing rays
IN other industrial plants, the! penetrating rays from isotopes
are now replacing complicated
X-ray methods for testing the struc-
ture of metal parts. In still another
application they are used to measure
the height of liquids in tanks by
having an isotope in a float on the
surface and reading the position of
this float by the rays that are
emitted through the tank walls.
This method can even be used to
measure the height of molten metal
in a foundry tank.
The radioactive isotopes described
in the above examples are only
faintly radioactive, sufficient to be
detected by the right instrument but
not sufficient to do harm to living
things. But extremely powerful
isotopes are also available. In the
case of the metal cobalt, for instance,
it is possible to obtain an isotope
thousands of times stranger than
radium itself, so that a small
tumbler of the material gives as
powerful a radiation as a whole
kilogram of radium.
In such strength, the rays can be
used to destroy bacteria and even
larger forms of life. One of the most
interesting possibilities therefore is
the sterilization of drugs, medical
supplies, and foods merely by expos-
ing them to the rays from this form
of cobalt for a few seconds or
minutes. Complete sterilization can
be obtained without the use of heat,
a point which is very important in
the case of drugs that are decompos-
ed by heat and for many foods
whose composition and flavaur are
changed by the usual processes of
sterilizing by cooking.
Perhaps the most immediate use
of this process is in the manufacture
of penicillin, the drug that is now
so widely employed for the cure and
prevention of infectious bacterial
diseases. The total annual produce-
tion of penicillin per year is now
worth well over a hundred million
dollars (36, 000, 000 pounds). Since the
drug is used in the human body, it
must be completely free from living
organisms, yet it cannot easily be
sterilized by heat without partial
decomposition. As soon as the cost
of radio-active cobalt becomes
somewhat less than at present, many
kilogrammes bf it could be put to
work for the sterilization of this
drug.
The production of radio-active
cobalt would have to grow still larger
and become still cheaper before the
same process could be used for the
sterilization of foods. In this case,
a source of very penetrating rays
would be used which would com-
pletely sterilize the interior of a cut
of meat or of a large vegetable.

of their flavaur and their lack of

RADIO-ACTIVE ISOTOPES are now being used in mazing ways in industry,
medicine, agriculture and the biological sciences. This photograph shows
an isotope which is being used to strain out the nicotine from cigarettes.

radio-active isotopes without affect-
ing the flavour and would remain
sterile if.. their surface were protect-
ed.
An even larger possible use is the
sterilization of fresh fruits or vege-
tables. These at present remain
fresh for only a very short period.
If they were sterilized cold by radia-
tion they would retain their flavour
and, if properly packaged, would not
spoil for long periods of time. They
could be sterilized immediately after
picking and retained on the market
for months afterwards.
Rejuvenated pastures
ANOTHER utilization of thissame method is the destruc-
tion of organisms on the sur-
face of foods. The skin of the fruit
is the usual source of spoilage
and provides an almost ideal
medium for the growth of bacte-
ria. It would be a relatively simple
matter to sterilize the skin and
outer surface without the use of
heat. This system could be applied
to fresh tomatoes, apples, peaches,
melons, nuts, eggs, cucumbers,
grapes, and oranges. Since only the
surface would be sterilized, they
would not remain fresh for months
but they could be kept for several
weeks before being sold or eaten. It
would also be applicable in the case
of packaged foods, such as bakery
products, which in some countries
are now sold in plastic or paper
wrappers. A surface treatment with
radiation would preserve them.
The production of radio-active
isotopes of this strength is not yet
sufficient for these uses and the cost
is also at present too high, but the
advantage to the food industry in
cold sterilization may make it pos-
sible to produce isotopes for this
purpose in huge volume and at low
cost. When atomic fuels are used
for the generation of large quantities
of power in industry, very great
amounts of these radio-active isoto-
pes will become available as by-pro-
ducts.
There is no direct application of
these powerful rays in agriculture,
biology, or medicine except in cases
where destruction is desired, such as
the eradication of a cancer. But the
use of radio-active isotopes in these
sciences is nevertheless enormous by
quite a different technique. This
consists in using the chemical ele-
ments that occur in animals, plants
and plant foods, with a very small
admixture of the radio-active form
of the same element.
For example, phosphate is a neces-
sary plant food and is a component
of nearly all fertilizers. It is an easy
matter to produce the isotope of
phosphorus that is weakly radio-
active and to mix it with the normal
phosphate in the fertilizer. Since it
constantly gives off a weak and
harmless radiation that can be
detected by proper instruments, it is
a very simple matter to follow or
trace what happens to the phos-
phorus in the soil and in the plant.
Used in this way, phosphorus would
be called a"tracer".
Important agricultural information
has thus been obtained. For ins-
tance, Swedish investigators have
found that phosphate in a fertilizer
is taken up by the plant roots almost
immediately when it is spread on the
soil ; there is no delay. American
investigators have discovered that
pasture grasses can take up phos-
phate that is spread over their leaves
and roots, so that old pastures can be
rejuvenated by phosphate without
the need for ploughing.
Even more interesting is the fact
that maize, sugar beets, tobacco and
cotton take up phosphate from the
fertilizer only during the early stage
of growth. Fertilizer spread on the
soil late in the season is of no value
to these crops. On the other hand,
potatoes take up phosphate from the
fertilizer in large quantities through-
out their entire growing season.
Finally, it has been found that
phosphoric acid added to irrigation
water is just as effective as fertilizer
spread dry on the soil. All of these
results were obtained by. measuring
the amount of radio-active phos-
phorus detected in the growing

GENERAL VIEW from the air of a field at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, used for plant experiments with nuclear radiation. Maize and other crops
are planted in circular furrows around a central source of radiation, radio-cobalt. Mutations and other changes in cell structure of plants are induced by exposure
to gamma rays emitted by the radio-active cobalt. Scientists are studying results which may eventually lead to improved strains of maize and also other vegetables.
plant. While its quantity is small,
like the black sheep in a flock, it can
reliably be used for measuring the
fate of all the phosphorus.
Many other tracer elements util-
ized in this manner have given
information of value to the farmer.
Radio-active potassium, painted on a
branch of a dormant plum tree, in
weather below freezing point, was
found to enter the sap and move
several feet both up and down the
branch in spite of the fact that the
sap is supposed to be motionless in
winter. On the other hand, in
summer the phosphorus moves all
the way to the roots within twenty-
four hours.
Another agricultural application
of this tracer technique with radio-
isotopes is in the study of insects
and fungi. Radio-iodine has been
used to study the spread of the oak
wilt fungus, through the roots and
from the roots of one oak to another.
Insecticides also can be tagged with
radio-isotopes. Thus it has been
shown that plant leaves absorb in-
secticides principally on their under
surface and do so only during the
day. Such work has also emphasiz-
ed the difference between broad-
leafed plants and narrow-leafed
grain and grasses in their reponse
to such weed-killers as 2, 4-D. A
broad-leafed plant absorbs a weed-
killer sprayed upon it and within
two hours the entire plant is per-
meated with it. On the other hand,
the grasses absorb very little weed-
killers and what is absorbed stays
on the spot without affecting the
plant as a whole.
Replacement for radium
EVEN mosquitoes can be tracedby radio-isotopes. Mosquito
larvae that swim in a very
weak solution of radio-phosphorus
remain radio-active all through
their lives and their presence can be
detected with Geiger counters. The
habits of mosquitoes are now being
studied by this method to learn how
long they live, how far they fly, and
what they feed on. It is expected
that similar treatment of birds may
give reliable information on bird
habits and especially on their migra-
tions.
The use of the powerful tissue-
destroying rays from radium is
established in the treatment of
cancers. They have the same effect
as equally powerful X-rays but a
cancer can often be reached with a
small pellet or tube of radium that
cannot well be reached by X-ray
tube. The new radio-isotopes can be
used in exactly the same way, but
with the advantage that the amounts
of radiation that can be obtained
from them are far larger than in the
case of radium and they cost less.
The commonest substitute for ra-
dium is radio-cobalt. A small
cylinder of metallic cobalt gives
gamma rays equal to that of radium
costing several hundred thousand
pounds sterling. Such a piece of
cobalt, weighing little more than an
ounce is enclosed in heavy metal but
an intense beam of radiation is di-
rected through a small window at
the cancerous growth.
In other forms, both radio-phos-
phorus and radio-gold are very
conveniently used for this type of
treatment. For skin cancers, an
ordinary blotting paper is soaked
with radio-active phosphate solution
and when dry it is cut to the size
and shape of the tumor, then is
strapped to the tumor with adhesive.
Radio-cobalt can be drawn out into
a fine wire or cut into tiny beads
which can be placed within the
cancerous growth. And radio-gold
can. be formed into tiny grains which
are fired directly into the cancer
from a small"gun". In both cases
they remain in the cancer until it is
destroyed.
In another method of treatment,
the radio-isotope can be given inter-
nally or can even be swallowed to
find its way into the blood stream.
It tis absorbed from the blood by
cancerous tissue. This is one of the
respects in which cancer differs from
ordinary tissue : it does absorb the
radio-isotope. Consequently, one
disease, in which the red blood cells
are formed lin such profusion as to
clog the blood vessels, can be treated
by radio-phosphorus which sharply
reduces the production of red blood
cells in the body for a period of about
a year.
Body-building revealed
THE element iodine is freely ab-) sorbed by the thyroid gland
which uses it to make the hor-
Imone called thyroxine. In patients
whose thyroid gland is too active, so
that it produces too much thyroxine,
part of the thyroid was formerly
removed by surgery. Nowadays, a
glass full of a solution of radio-io-
dine serves the same purpose since
iodine is absorbed in the gland and
there emits its rays which destroy
the excess thyroid tissue and active-
ty. This is, however, not a cancerous
condition and cancer of the thyroid
is in fact not easily treated with
radio-iodine.
In a few such uses, radio-isotopes
have been extremely valuable. How-
ever, their chief use in medicine is
not for treatment but for research,
where the purpose is to trace the
course of chemical and physiological
processes in the body. The isotopes
used are those that give weak and
harmless rays that can easily be
detected by the proper sensitive ins-
truments. In some cases isotopes,
are used that are not radio-active,
heavy water, for example, and must
be detected by more complicated
methods
One of the first results of the
use of"tracer"isotopes was the dis-
. covery that all the tissues in the
body are in a constant process of
, replacement. It is natural to think
of the body as a stable structure
which uses food only to maintain its
heat and for replacement of worn
parts. This is not so. When fats, in
which some of the hydrogen atoms
have been replaced chemically by
"heavy hydrogen"are eaten, the
new fat is deposited in the fatty
layers of the body while the older
fats, already in the body, are burn-
ed for heat.
So, too, eating proteins which
contain"heavy nitrogen"results in
the use of the fresh protein for
building body tissues, muscles and
blood cells, while the proteins al-
ready present are oxidized and
excreted. Every part of the body is
thus constantly being rebuilt by a
steady exchange of new materials
from food to replace the established
materials.
In a relatively short time, a matter
of weeks or months, every human or
animal body is completely rebuilt.
Even the bones are thus rebuilt and
the only exception is the iron, chiefly
in the red blood cells, which is not
rapidly replaced by new iron atoms
in the food. This process is a funda-
mental to life, but would probably
never have been discovered without
the use of tracer isotopes.
Animals and plants can seldom
distinguish between ordinary atoms
and the unnatural isotopes. The
fact that there are now more than
six hundred different isotopes avail-
able, some of them in large quan-
tities, has made possible the in-
vestigation of a very large number
of biological reactions, so that the
tracer technique has provided
almost as much information about
living things and the life process as
did the microscope during the first
few centuries after its invention.
This is partly because an isotopic
atom can be followed through a
lbng succession of changes.
For instance, the actual function
of vitamins and how they do their
work in nutrition has recently
become entirely clear by this
method, though it is too long a
story to tell here. One example is
the addition of radio-cobalt to the
culture medium on which the mould
Streptomyces griseus is grown. The
mould takes up the isotopes and
uses them to manufacture vitamin
B-12 and they can be detected by
their rays both in the mould and
in the vitamin that is
(Cont'd on later produced from the
next page) mould. Thus a radio-

active vitamin can be used in the
food of human beings and its fate
in the chemistry of the body traced.
The most promising investigation
of this sort is the study of the pro-
cess by which green plant. s build
their substance from the water and
carbon-dioxide of the air. This
reaction is the fundamental one for
all life since all the green plants de-
pend upon it and all other plants
and all animals depend on the green
plants. It is apparently a simple
reaction in which the molecule of
water and that of carbon-dioxide
are combined, lose some oxygen, and
form sugars, starches, cellulose, and
more involved chemical materials.
Nevertheless, no one knows how
the plant does it and man is unable
to duplicate the reaction. But the
availability of a faintly radio-active
isotope of carbon has already given
much information and may withinthe next year or two
explain the reaction
completely. This will
not mean that man
can dispense with
plants for food pro-
duction, but it may
well mean that the
food production by
plants can be greatly
improved ounce this
reaction is understood.
The process involves
the formation of car-
bon-dioxide gas from
carbon which contains
a small proportion of
the radio-active isotope
of carbon. The pro-
duct is"heavy carbon-
dioxide"but is used by
plants in the presence
of sunlight exactly as
they use ordinary car-
bon. The results is
that the radio-active
carbon is built into the
materials of the plant
and its presence and
location in the plant
can be detected im-
mediately. When the
green leaves of certain
plants were thus ex-
posed to radio-active
carbon-dioxide for only
one minute, at least
fifty separate c o m-
pounds were found in
the leaf, tagged with
radio-carbon. When
the time of exposure to
sunlight was reduced
to two seconds, the leaf
had already manu-
factured two or three
compounds from the
carbon-dioxide of the
air.
It turns out that the
first products made by
the'plant are com-
pounds of phospho-
glyceric a c i d which
thus are shown to be
steps in the manu-
facture of fruit, or
grain, or sugar. After
two minutes of ex-
posure, radio-carbon
tests showed that even
proteins and fats
already contained the
new carbon just received from
the atmosphere. The detailed in-
vestigations of these reactions are
now in process and the full mecha-
nism of this basic plant reaction
should be understood very soon.
By studying the process in diffe-
rent plants it is now known that the
early stages of the reaction are iden-
tical in all plants. Only later does
the process diverge into the produc-
tion of compounds that are charac-
teristic of each plant, such as aro-
mas, colours, and drugs. In the case
of the green algae, it has thus been
possible to divert the reaction among
the algae so that either a preponde-
rance of sugar or of malic acid can
be formed early in the process.
On Ithis basis, the experiments
have now been continued to show
that the same algae which normally
contain about 50 % of protein can
be so altered as to produce about
75 % of fat instead of protein. In
fact, the protein content can be
varied all the way from 7 % to 88 %,
while the fat content can be changed
from 1 % to 75'%. At the same time,
the carbon-dioxide can be changed
from 6 % to 38 %.. This obviously
opens enormous possibilities for
changing and increasing the food
supplies available both to animals
and to human beings.
One more chapter must be added
to the achievements of the radio-
isotopes, namely that they have
provided a new measure for histo-
rical time. They have given answers
to questions on the age of trees and
of long-buried animals, of human
skeletons and of human structures of
centuries ago. They have dated the
Ice Age and are capable of fixing
closely the dates of many events
within the last 30 thousand years.
The method is based on the fact
that there is a very small but defi-
nite proportion of the heavy radio-
active isotope of carbon in all the
carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.
Since all plants build their tissues
from that carbon dioxide and all
animals breathe it, the proportion of
radio-active carbon to ordinary car-
'even the organic material of mud.
Using this method, scientists at
the University of Chicago have
found that charcoal left from the
ancient settlement of Shaheinab
near Khartoum (Sudan) is from
trees which were growing 5, 060 years
ago, while shells of bi-valves found
in the same place were taken from
the sea 5, 446 years ago. At Jarmo, in
Irak, is a site of an ancient village
which shows the earliest traces of
granaries and of a food producing
economy. These were shown to be
6, 695 years old. A Mayan lintel was
carved 1, 470 years ago, while the fa-
mous Stonehenge in England is
dated at 3, 800 years ago, thus nearly
2, 000 years B. C. A pair of rope san-
dals in so good a state of preserva-
tion that they look as if they had
been thrust aside only yesterday
were found in a cave in Oregon,
(U. S. A.). A test showed they were
9, 000 years old.
Another recent question was the

bon in all living things is the same
and is as well-known scientific fact.
As soon as an animal or a plant
dies, the exchange of carbon with its
surroundings ceases and many are
buried and partly preserved.
As soon as this happens, a slow
change in the proportion of the two
isotopes occurs. The radio-active
isotope gives off its rays and becomes
inert so that it can no longer be
detected. But this is a slow process.
Any amount of radio-active carbon
is reduced to half the original quan-
tity in 5, 568 years, then to half of'than, therefore to a fourth of the
original, in another 5, 568 years. In
the course of about 30 thousand
years what remains is too small
to measure.
Within those 30, 000 years, however,
it is possible to measure the radio-
activity of the carbon present, to
compare it with the total carbon and
thus to get an estimate of the date
at which the plant or animal died.
By this method it is now possible to
fix the exact date when there was
life in buried skeletons, the wood
found in old structures, the charred
remains from prehistoric fires, and
age of a manuscript scroll of the Old
Testament book of Isaiah. Was it
written in the days of the Old Tes-
tament or was it a medieval forgery ?
Analysis proved that it was written
some 2, 000 years ago but it could
not be decided if it had been written
before or after the life of Christ.
The oldest date for human life so
far fixed in this way is the Lascaux
cave in southwest France, site of
the famous paintings of the extinct
woolly mammoth. Analyses proved
that this cave was inhabited and
used by man about 15, 500 years ago.
On the other hand, there are remains
of the flesh and hair of the ancient
super-bison in Alaska which are
older than 28, 000 years, yet the flesh
is in sufficient preservation so that
arctic dogs have eaten it.
Perhaps the most surprising dis-
covery relates to the circulation of
the water in the oceans. At the
surface ocean water contains the
normal proportion of radio-carbon
and ordinary carbon but in the arctic
regions the surface water sinks and
is known to move slowly along the
ocean bottom toward the tropics, so
that there is a constant circulation.
glacial period, the sea
level was about 80 feet
lower than now ; 9, 000
years ago, it was 70 feet
lower ; 7, 000 years ago,
50 feet lower, and
3, 000 years ago, 25 feet
lower. Sea level is still
rising, as the arctic and
antarctic ice melts.
This method has
been used also to
measure the rate of
formation of plankton,
the very fine vegetable
and animal matter
that lives in the ocean
and on which the
smallest fish feed. An
exploring vessel deter-
mined that, every
year, every square yard
of oceans produces
three thousandths of
an ounce. This may
seem little enough, but
in all the areas of the
seas it amounts to
40 thousand million
tons of carbohydrates
every year-as much
as is produced by all
the trees and plants
on land. Incidentally,
this investigation show-
ed that organic matter
in the seas off the
western coast of Africa
is four or five times
higher than that in the
Indian Ocean. Further
such studies can be
used to locate future
profitable fishing
grounds.
A related problem
solved some 30 years
ago is the age of the
earth. During the last
century estimates have
varied from a few
thousand years, ac-
cording to biblical do-
cuments, up to many
millions. The most
reliable measurement,
and one now every-
where accepted, is
based on the radio-
activity of uranium and
its slow decay into
lead. The half-life
of uranium i. s 700 mil-
lion years, so long a period that
there is still uranium on the earth
in. spite of its constant decompo-
sition into lead. By measuring the
amount of uranium now present
together with the amount of lead
formed from it, and comparing it
with the known rate of decay of
uranium, the resulting age of the
earth is found to be approximately
3 thousand million years.
Thus the radio-isotopes have open-
ed a new chapter in science by
providing a reliable clock for the
measurement of time which is long
since gone.
Up to now only small quan-
tities of radio-isotopes are available.
If and when atomic power, and
therefore atomic furnaces, are
widely used by industry throughout
the world, the production of radio-
isotopes as a by-product of atomic
furnaces will also greatly increase.
It is therefore safe to say that
both the direct uses of the isotopes
and the scientific discoveries made
with them will greatly increase and
will multiply both man's knowledge
and his power.
Measurements of samples of water
taken deep in the Atlantic opposite
Newfoundland showed that the or-
ganic material in the water was
about 1, 500 years old. It is therefore
a matter of several thousands of
years for the slow ocean currents to
turn over the surface water to the
bottom and bring bottom water up.
Another interesting date is that of
the last ice sheet which covered
northern Europe, Asia, and America.
Its date has now been set by measur-
ing the age of the trees and wooden
debris that lie under the gravel de-
posited by the glacier. The date is
11, 000 years ago. Since then, the
glaciers have been retreating and
still are. This has been confirmed
by a study of the muds on the sea
coast especially in the deltas of
great rivers.
During the Ice Age, there was so
much water frozen in the glaciers
that the ocean level was much lower
than it is now. At the height of the
