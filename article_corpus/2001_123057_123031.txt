Has the spread of globalization pro d u c e d
an increasingly standardized ideal of
the human body?
Oddly enough, the more
globalization advances, the less of a
single ideal there is.As far as pure physical beauty
g o e s, the American model prevailed for several
d e c a d e s. It changed slowly, from brunettes like
Audrey Hepburn and Lauren Bacall to blondes
epitomized by Marilyn Monroe and others. Then
various ethnic groups demanded their place in
a d v e r t i s i n g.The result is that today, a wide range of
human models is held up to us.
To what extent does advertising create people’s
image of the human body?
That image comes to us from the fashion world.
People like to say advertising starts trends, like the
recent wave of “fashion pornography.” But this
came straight from designers and fashion
journalists. The job of advertising is to pick up on
trends. It’s rarely subversive because brands don’t
gain anything from shocking people too much.
Advertising’s a remarkable mirror, but it doesn’t
start fads.
So are the accusations unfair that advertising has
c reated an ultra-thin ideal of the body, as pers o n i fie d
by top model Kate Moss?
Kate Moss has certainly had a big influence on
anorexic teenagers, but it isn’t just because of
a d v e r t i s i n g. I t ’s her presence on the screen.M u s i c,
video clips and television are just as responsible as
advertising for promoting this ideal of thinness.
The image of men has changed quite a lot too, h a s n ’ t
it?
The depiction of homosexuals, especially in
Fr a n c e, is a major revolution. Surveys show people
a r e n ’t in the least shocked by the presence of
homosexuals in advertising images. All this has
helped to win acceptance for the idea that a man has
the right to take care of his body. Sales of male
beauty products are booming.Men are trying to fin d
their bearings.Their three reasons for being, in the
West at least—going to war, bringing home the
bacon and making babies —are disappearing as
more women work and science advances. M e n
have mentally accepted that they should do
housework (though only three percent actually do
any) and help to look after their children. B u t
women are also calling for men to be more
masculine again, while demanding they show a
sensitive, feminine side…
Advertising reflects this confusion.
A b s o l u t e l y. France is the country that seems
to have the freest attitude by far to morals and
morality.The Anglo-Saxons are very prudish.You
never see naked breasts in American ads. Three
years ago, there was an uproar when the lingerie
firm Victoria’s Secret mounted a big advertising
campaign in the United States, complete with
parades by top models. It was the first time people
had seen women moving in public wearing nothing
but a bra and panties. We’d been seeing that on
French television for 20 years.
Has that image become routine?
Ye s, and we’re not bothered by it. A recent
survey we conducted showed that most Fr e n c h
people aren’t shocked when they see very sex-
oriented advertising. Scandinavian countries have
even less of a complex with regard to nudity,
although the images are not erotic. They are very
puritanical Protestant societies.
In Fra n c e, a law has been suggested to safeguard the
image of women in advertising.
Some feminist groups deplore excessively
sexual advertising and the depiction of women as
o b j e c t s, but I think it’s dangerous to pass laws about
t h a t .Wh o ’s going to decide what’s what? It’s not up
to judges to say whether an ad is degrading to
w o m e n . People will eventually get bored with very
sexual images and a balance will be restored
naturally.
A re there any taboos left in the way the human
body is depicted?
The last taboos, t h a n k f u l l y, are pedophilia
a n d z o o p h i l i a . The trend of portraying sado-
masochism shocks feminists but at the same time,
advertising works with fantasies. If there’s no
physical threat to the human body, such allusions
