KOREAN
A YEAR
"To have a single book for the school was a
luxury. When we didn't have a blackboard,
we used to draw our illustrations on the
mud floor." That is how Korean teachers
describe the difficult war-time and early
post-war conditions in their schools. Today,
however, a steady stream of textbor,;;s is
flowing back into Korean schools from the
new National Textbook Printing Plant (left)
now in production at Yong Dong Po, near
Seoul. The plant was built through the
combined efforts of the United Nations
Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA),
UNESCO and the Republic of Korea Govern¬
ment. Geared to produce thirty million
textbooks a year, the printing, stitching and
packing equipment (below, left and centre)
is the most modern obtainable. Between
September 1954, when the plant opened,
and March 1955, 12,000,000 books were
produced. In Pusan, South Korea's main
supply port, UNKRA Is helping thousands of
sick people by providing equipment and sup¬
plies for the clinic operated by the Mary
Knoll Sisters. This has enabled the clinic
to give orthopaedic treatment to children
suffering from tuberculosis of the bone and
poliomyelitis. Long before daybreak, patients
pack the courtyard and alleyway leading to
the clinic waiting their turn for examination
and treatment. Photos (right) show a father
explaining the nature of his child's illness
to one of the sisters, and another sister taking
blood count of young orphan, one of many
thousands treated at the clinic. (U.N. photos)
