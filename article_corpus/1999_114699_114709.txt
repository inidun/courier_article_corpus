HelpAge Intern ational (HAI) is one of the
wo r l d ’s biggest networks of not-for-profit
o r g a n i z ations invo l ved in community
activities designed with and for older people. I t
has 57 members wo r l d w i d e , most of them in less
d e veloped countries of A f ri c a , Asia and Lat i n
A m e ri c a . In countries where confli c t , disaster or
social transition have created particularly acute
s i t u at i o n s , HelpAge Intern ational ru n s
p r o grammes to support some of the most
vulnerable older people, in many cases by
strengthening the capacity of local organizations to
address their needs. HAI is active in such fie l d s
as health care, income and food securi t y,
ophthalmic wo r k , training and educat i o n ,
e m e r g e n cy relief, c a r e , a d vo c a cy and research.
One of its chief aims is to increase the invo l ve m e n t
of older people in project planning and
m a n a g e m e n t .
In one HAI-supported village project in
C a m b o d i a , older people have started up ri c e
b a n k s , from which participants borr ow rice for
food or sow i n g, refunding it with interest—in
rice—after the harve s t . Some of the “ p r o f i t ” i s
d i s t ri buted free to frail older people in the village.
In South A f rica HAI is working with the
Muthande Society for the Aged (MUSA) on a
t h r e e - year literacy project in six centres in
D u r b a n . A team of older people trained as literacy
t u t o rs are running courses in Zulu, English and
n u m e r a cy, with lessons designed to help students
cope with real-life challenges—pension form s ,
b i l l s , telephone numbers and sewing pat t e rn s. ■
