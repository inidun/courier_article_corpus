The journalist who first uncovered Echelon, a major electronic spy
network, reveals how international surveillance touches us all
C
onstellations of giant golf balls can be
spotted in the most remote locations across
the world, from China’s Pamir mountains
to the swampy north coast of Australia and
atop tiny coral atolls in the Indian Ocean.
Between 30 and 50 metres wide, these smooth, s y m-
metrical white domes also loom among rice fields in
northern Japan and the vineyards and mountains of
New Zealand’s South Island.
The clusters are the most visible signs of concealed
electronic networks that watch the world. Each dome
is filled with satellite tracking dishes that silently soak
up and examine millions of faxes, email messages,
phone calls and computer data that keep business and
political affairs aflo a t .Unknown to the communicators,
their messages are running through the domes, i n t o
computer networks and onto listeners who may be on
the other side of the planet.
As the world has globalized and international
communications have become central to human
a f f a i r s, these listening networks have grown expo-
n e n t i a l l y.They are part of systems called signals intel-
ligence or “ s i g i n t ,”operated by a handful of advanced
c o u n t r i e s.
For many years, sigint networks were secret: d i s-
cussion of their existence was strongly discouraged or
even forbidden by law in the countries concerned.
Now the European Parliament is seriously investigating
sigint organizations and their impact on human rights
and international trade. Europe is focusing on
“ E c h e l o n ,” a system that relies on listening stations in
about ten countries to intercept and process interna-
tional satellite communications. Echelon is just one
part of an immense network run by the U. S. and its
English-speaking allies—Britain, C a n a d a , Au s t r a l i a
and New Zealand—known as UKUSA after a secret
agreement that created the alliance in 1948. L i t t l e
escapes the UKUSA network, which intercepts mes-
sages from the Internet, undersea cables and radio
transmissions as well as from monitoring equipment ins-
talled in embassies.It even operates in space with a fle e t
of orbiting satellites.
The history of systems like Echelon is as old as
radio itself.The first international scandal over secret
listening occurred in the 1920s, when the U. S. S e n a t e
discovered that British agents were copying every
international telegram sent by American telegraph
c o m p a n i e s. To d a y ’s international networks were
founded in the early years of the Cold Wa r, w h e n
many western countries began jointly monitoring the
former Soviet Union.
Fear not 
the word “ b o m b ”
Who is listened to, and why? Officially govern-
ments only admit that surveillance is aimed at com-
monly agreed perils such as arms proliferation, t e r-
r o r i s m , drug trafficking and organized crime.But this
is the tip of the iceberg.The main aim is to spy on other
governments’ diplomatic messages and military plans
while collecting information about trade. In fact, i n
1 9 9 2 , the U. S. re-adjusted its national intelligence
p r i o r i t i e s, specifying that 40 percent would be eco-
nomic or “economic in nature,” according to Robert
G a t e s, director of the Central Intelligence A g e n cy at
the time. International and non-governmental orga-
nizations like Amnesty International and Greenpeace
are also targets.
While UKUSA is the world’s largest network,
Fr a n c e, Germany and the Russian Federation have
similar systems. On a smaller scale, so do countries in
Scandinavia and the Middle East, including Israel,
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. The budgets of all
government sigint agencies probably add up to an
annual expenditure of $20 billion,according to my cal-
culations for a European Parliament report publi-
shed last year.
Despite the extraordinary scale of Echelon and
its sister systems, the press has mistakenly reported
that the network could intercept “all email, t e l e p h o n e,
and fax communications.” Nor can it recognize theThe listening base Menwith Hill,UK.

on Human Rights and the International Te l e c o m m u-
nications Convention, which assures the privacy of
international communications.Indeed sigint agencies
trample over a long line of treaties.
While individuals probably never know that they
have been spied upon, their organizations and coun-
tries may pay a high price for it. During trade nego-
t i a t i o n s, sigint agencies can sweep up the messages of
a producer nation to discover their bottom line.A r m e d
with such secret reports, the negotiators for the deve-
loped world can force prices down to a minimum.
Several governments have recently begun targeting
environmental organizations or those protesting unfair
world trade.
Even when there are no direct adverse conse-
q u e n c e s, the mere existence of powerful surveillance
systems can exercise a chilling effect on free speech,
inhibiting political and cultural development.
As these activities have become more contro-
v e r s i a l , the U. S. has tried to expand its circle of
c o l l a b o r a t o r s. Countries like Switzerland and
Denmark are currently building new satellite stations
to gather and trade spy data with the U. S. B u t , as the
ongoing European Parliament inquiry indicates,p u b l i c
awareness and concern are growing fast.Yet vigilance
is not enough: if countries and peoples are to have
equal rights in the global information infrastructure,

content of every telephone call. And it is pure fic t i o n
that by typing key words like “ b o m b ” in an email, y o u
can trigger a tape recorder in some secret base. Fo r
every million messages or phone calls intercepted, l e s s
than 10 will be used for intelligence purposes.Most per-
sonal communications are ignored except those of
“ i m p o r t a n t ”i n d i v i d u a l s, like politicians, top business
executives and their families.
The UKUSA network, h o w e v e r, does have the
power to access and process most of the world’s satel-
lite communications and relay contents to client states.
The system provides participating countries an enor-
m o u s,unfair political advantage,since most developing
nations cannot afford the expertise and equipment
necessary to protect the privacy and security of their
n e t w o r k s.
Spying on the goverment
for the people
News about these systems began to leak out in the
1970s as U. S. intelligence agencies came under scrutiny
in the “ Wa t e r g a t e ” a f f a i r, when former president
Richard Nixon used electronic bugging against his
election opponents.Since then, an increasing number
of whistleblowers have revealed the scale and effects
of sigint spying.
I first wrote about electronic spying by Britain in
the 1970s. While completing a university degree in
p h y s i c s, I ’d noted that the countryside was dotted
with mysterious radio and satellite stations.In 1976, I
uncovered the British dimension to the activities of
A m e r i c a ’s National Security A g e n cy (NSA), w h i c h
had been revealed the previous year by Congres-
sional enquiries.O f ficials were aghast that a sacred cow
of eternal and indivisible secrecy had been slaughtered.
Soon after the article’s publication, my American co-
author was deported from Britain as a “threat to
national security.”
The government then arrested me, along with
another journalist and our source. The authorities
d i d n ’t dare accuse us of espionage for a foreign
c o u n t r y. Our “ c r i m e ” was spying on the government
for the people. Had the prosecution succeeded, w e
would have faced heavy jail sentences.
Over the next 20 years, o f ficial secrecy relaxed as
U. S. Congressional investigations notably turned the
spotlight on sigint agencies. In Britain in the 1980s, a
controversial ban on trade union membership at the
Government Communications Headquarters
(GCHQ) boomeranged by shifting attention on its
spying activities.
The growth of the public information culture on
the Internet has taken these developments a step fur-
t h e r. N o w, even GCHQ and NSA have websites to
reassure UKUSA citizens that they are not targets.N o
such safeguards apply to the rest of the world: t h e s e
citizens are by default denied the right to privacy.Th e
countries intercepting their communications are free
to use the intelligence for whatever they wish.
Such conduct violates the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights,as well as the European Convention
