As this issue goes to press the
world has learned of the extent of
the catastrophic floods which rav¬
aged Italy last month. The damage
to Italy's art treasures and his¬
torical monuments is incalculable.
Unesco has issued an appeal to
all countries " to assist to the
fullest extent the efforts of the
Italian people and authorities to
preserve and restore cultural pro¬
perty that has been damaged. " For

1967
INTERNATIONAL
TOURIST YEAR
The United Nations General Assembly has designated 1967 as Inter¬
national Tourist Year. In devoting this issue to international tourism,
and more especially to that new phenomenon of our times " Cultural
Tourism ", we have sought to show, in the words of Mr Arthur Haulot,
president of the International Union of Official Travel Organizations,
" the far stronger ties now drawing men everywhere closer to each
other and thereby achieving the cultural enrichment of all mankind. "
0 VER 115 million tourists,
180 million air passengers in 110
countries, 130 million cars in the world.
These figures for the year 1965 indi¬
cate the importance of the new econo¬
mic and social phenomenon represent¬
ed by international tourism.
The recent growth of tourism is
related to the increase in purchasing
power and in the practice of taking
holidays, the availability of cheaper
transport and the appearance of new
forms of transport which are faster
(aircraft) or more convenient (private
cars). In countries with a high stan¬
dard of living, tourism, both domestic
and international, is no longer the pre¬
rogative of a small minority; it has
become a mass phenomenon and is
increasing by about 15 per cent in rela¬
tion to a 10 per cent increase in family
income. In some countries, it accounts
for an average of 8 per cent of family
expenditure, not including transport
costs or secondary residences.
Inter-continental tourism depends
mainly on air transport and regional
tourism on the. private car. There has
been a continuous reduction in air
fares. Taking into account the increase
in charter flights, it can be estimated
that, in terms of constant prices, fares
have been reduced by more than half
in the last fifteen years. In the same
period, the duration of the flights has
also been reduced by more than half.
In the United States of America
almost 90 per cent of all journeys are
made in private cars, in spite of the
growth of domestic air travel, and in
Europe the mileage travelled has
tripled in the last ten years, while the
number of foreign cars entering the
country has increased six times in
Spain, 6.5 times in Denmark, 30 times
in Yugoslavia and even more in Bul¬
garia.
Europe's motorways grew by 680 km
(400 miles) in 1965, bringing its total
network to 8,000 km (5,000 miles). In
July 1965, the opening of the longest
road tunnel in the world (12 km;
8 miles) under Mont Blanc linked the
French and Italian road networks.

INTERNATIONAL TOURIST YEAR (Continued)
IT 5 million tourists abroad
in a single year
Within six months 350,000 vehicles
had passed through the tunnel.
As it grows, tourist traffic is becom¬
ing more diversified. Thanks to the
increased rapidity of air travel, every
country is now within the reach of the
regions from which the majority of the
tourists come. New tourist patterns
have been added to the traditional
ones as a result of the opening up of
new regions and of the desire of tour¬
ists to explore new countries.
Touring holidays are on the increase,
but resort holidays abroad are
increasing even more rapidly and the
countries which benefit most from this
are the Mediterranean countries and
the West Indies, because of the attrac¬
tion of sea and sun. Individual and
group travel are increasing at the same
time, without affecting each other's
growth. The number of tourists taking
winter sports holidays is doubling
every seven years, and more and more
people are taking more than one holi¬
day a year.
Special visits abroad particularly for
professional conventions and for sport¬
ing or cultural events are becoming
increasingly popular and more widely
distributed geographically. The same
is true of cruises; for example, bet¬
ween 1958 and 1963 the number of
passengers to Bermuda increased from
71,500 to 200,000, and to Greece from
22,300 to 68,200.
In 1965, the world's travellers spent
$57,300 million on international and
national tourism, according to a special
report on the development of tourism
published in October 1966 by the Or¬
ganization for Economic Co-operation
and Development. If the cost of trans¬
port were included the figure would be
about 30 per cent greater. Spending
on national tourism totalled $46,000
million.
More people went abroad in 1965
than ever before: nearly 6 million from
Britain, 3.5 million from France, almost
3 million from Italy and over 2.5 million
from the U.S.A. travelled overseas, to
give but four examples.
Relative expenditure on domestic
and international tourism varies ac¬
cording to the country; it is estimated,
for example, that, not including the
cost of transport, international tourism
accounts for 10 per cent of the travel
spending of residents in the U.S.A.,
40 per cent in the Netherlands, 50 per
cent in Argentina and nearly 80 per
cent in Belgium. In some countries,
the expenditure per inhabitant on
foreign travel is considerable: almost
$29 a year in Canada and Switzerland,
almost $24 in Belgium, almost $22 in
the Federal Republic of Germany,
about $12.5 in France and the United
Kingdom, and $11 in the United States;
in other countries, expenditure per
inhabitant is much smaller: $2.9 in Mo¬
rocco, §1 in Nigeria and $0.05 in In¬
dia (1).
Earnings from international tourism
sometimes represent a considerable
portion of the national income. They
represent, for example, more than
24 per cent of the national income in
Barbados, more than 7 per cent in
Austria, Ireland and Lebanon, more
than 6 per cent in Mexico, more than
5 per cent in Jamaica and Jordan,
almost 4 per cent in Puerto Rico,
2.6 per cent in the United Arab Repub¬
lic and 2 per cent in Morocco, while
in the United States of America they
represent about 0.2 per cent and in
the Federal Republic of Germany,
Japan, Sweden, Thailand and the Unit¬
ed Kingdom they are in the region of
1 per cent. These figures do not take
account of the multiplier effect of tour¬
ist spending; on that score, they
should in most cases be doubled.
International tourism can be a very
important source of foreign exchange;
it accounts for between 10 and 20 per
cent of the total visible and invisible
foreign exchange earnings in Greece,
Italy and Switzerland, and for more
than 40 per cent in Spain, where the
foreign exchange from tourists amount¬
ed to $919 million in 1964; in Panama
the profit balance from tourism halves
the balance-of-payments deficit. On
the other hand, tourism shows an
adverse balance in tourist-exporting
countries, particularly in the United
(JJ Most of the figures quoted in this and
succeeding paragraphs are based on the
estimate of the International Union of Official
Travel Organizations (IUOTO), and relate,
unless otherwise indicated, to 1963.

THE SPECTACULAR
GROWTH
OF INTERNATIONAL
TOURISM
The development of international
tourism has been spectacular. Bet¬
ween 1958 and 1963 the rise in tourist
expenditure was about 75 per cent.
The rise in 1964 is estimated at 15 per
cent. The distribution of international
tourism among the different regions of
the world, however, is very unequal,
as this table shows. It should be
noted that the table covers both tour¬
ism within each region and tourism
between regions.

Kingdom, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the United States of
America, where the deficit in respect
of tourism amounted in 1964 to some
$200 million, $600 million and $1,120
million respectively.
In Europe, tourists from other conti¬
nents accounted for only 15 per cent
of the 1963 total of 66 million (see table
page 6), and even so they have been
counted several times in the table
when, as happens very frequently, they
have visited several European coun¬
tries. Expenditure by United States
tourists in other countries, apart from
Canada and the frontier region of
Mexico, was $1,326 million, including:
$815 million in Europe and the Medi¬
terranean countries of Africa and the
Middle East;
$310 million in the Caribbean and
Central America;
$93 million in Asia and Australia;
$65 million in South America.
To this must be added transport
expenses, which benefited foreign
transport organizations to the extent
of some $635 million.
T,HESE figures show the
importance of Europe and North Am¬
erica in international tourism. It is these
areas that provide the great majority
of tourists. It is to these areas, too,
that by far the largest number of tour¬
ists go. In 1964 approximately 2 million
Europeans went outside Europe and 2
million tourists from the United States
went to foreign countries other than
Canada and the frontier region of
Mexico.
Spending on international tourism
in 1965 totalled $11,600 million, or the
equivalent of over 6 per cent of all
world exports of goods and merchan¬
dise. Earnings from international tour¬
ism were well over $7,000 million for
European countries among which Italy
remained in first place ($1,288 million;
up 24 per cent) closely followed by
Spain ($1,157 million; up 26 per cent)
and then France ($910 million; up 11
per cent).
The growth in the tourist movement
shows no sign of slackening. The
number of overseas visitors to the
United States rose from 516,000 in
1961 to 962,000 in 1964 and to over a
million in 1965. It was because of this
increase that the deficit in the coun-

Spain, with 34 million inhabitants, was visited by 15 million tourists from
abroad in the first nine months of 1966, thus beating its previous annual
record for tourist arrivals. In 1965, Spain earned the equivalent of
$1,157 million from tourism, or almost as much foreign currency as was brought
in by overseas trade. This tourist poster shows Salamanca's magnificent
palace, the Casa de las Conchas, named for the scallop shells on its façade.

try's tourism balance-of-payments did
not grow until 1964 despite the consid¬
erable rise in United States travel
abroad.
More than 1,200,000 persons visited
the U.S.S.R. in 1965. A vast building
programme was launched this year to
provide hotel and motel accomodation
for 50,000 extra visitors.
In Europe, the year 1964 saw a very
large rise over the previous year in
the number of foreign tourist arrivals
in certain countries (e.g., Portugal 100
per cent; Spain 33.4 per cent; Yugo¬
slavia 23 per cent; United Kingdom
11.8 per cent; and Turkey 10.7 per
cent.) On the other hand, there was
a decline of 4 per cent in Italy and
2 per cent in Greece. The number of
nights spent by foreign tourists rose,
in each of the years 1963 and 1964, by
an average of no more than 5 per
cent over the previous year, but this
figure gives a very inaccurate idea of
the development of tourism, because
supplementary means of accommoda¬
tion (camping, caravaning, residences
abroad, rooms in private houses, etc.),
which are developing very rapidly, are
often not included in the statistics. (It
is estimated that in France only 45 per
cent of the total number of nights
spent by visiting foreign tourists were
in hotels.)
Probably the fastest expanding feat¬
ure of domestic and international tour¬
ism nowadays is the camping holiday.
France now has 3,600 camping sites,
the U.K. has 3,000 and the Netherlands
2,800. Bulgaria, France, Turkey, Spain
and Yugoslavia are some of the coun¬
tries where hundreds of camping sites
and holiday camps are springing up.
Since 1963, many countries and nota¬
bly Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Spain
and Bulgaria, have launched large-
scale programmes to build, extend and
modernize their hotels. In Europe, the
country with the most hotel accommo¬
dation is the U.K. (just over 1 million
beds) with Italy almost neck. and neck,
followed at some distance by the Fed¬
eral Republic of Germany (700,000
beds). France's classified hotels have
600,000 beds, but France has more
supplementary accommodation than
any other country (1.5 million beds).
The African countries are making a
great effort to develop their tourism.
Measures have been enacted for the
protection and preservation of nature
and national parks in Dahomey, Ga¬
bon, Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria. His¬
torical and cultural centres are under
the protection of the state in Daho¬
mey, Guinea and Nigeria. The devel¬
opment of handicrafts, folklore and
hunting is encouraged in Tunisia. Stu¬
dent exchanges and the establishment
of vacation colonies are likewise en¬
couraged in Dahomey, Gabon, Guinea,
Nigeria and Zambia.
Large-scale publicity campaigns in
foreign countries and programmes for
the construction of roads and expan¬
sion of air services have been under-

taken by most of the countries.
Through the press and radio, the popu¬
lation is becoming aware of the bene¬
fits brought by tourism. The countries
from which tourists come to Africa are,
in order of importance, France, the
United Kingdom, the United States, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Spain and Sweden. But inter-regional
tourism is little developed in Africa.
In the Pacific and East Asian region,
the number of tourists in 1964 was
16 per cent higher than in 1963. This
trend continued in 1965. The Inter¬
national Union of Official Travel Organ¬
izations estimates that in Australia
the number of visitors, which was
146,000 in 1963, rose to 180,000 in
1965, while in Hong Kong it rose from
ed Arab Republic being 23 per cent,
for Lebanon 30 per cent, for Jordan
18 per cent, for Syria 16 per cent and
for Israel' 8 per cent. There was a
decline, however, in Cyprus. The
amount of tourism within the region is
considerable. Foreign visitors from
outside the region come mainly from
the United States, the United Kingdom,
France and the Federal Republic of
Germany, plus a good number from
Greece and Iran. The annual rate of
growth during the period 1960-1964 for
such non-regional tourism was 16.8
per cent for the United Arab Republic,
18.1 per cent for Lebanon and 30 per
cent for Jordan.
In Central America, the number of
tourists to Mexico grew by 12 per cent
ductions no satisfactory progress has
been made in the 'staggering of holi¬
days and the extension of the tourist
season.
Reports on tourism in the first
months of 1966 show that the upswing
in international tourism has further
increased. Greece recorded a 20 per
cent rise in tourist revenue up to Sep¬
tember, and in Austria, U.K., Bulgaria,
Italy, Rumania, France and Spain, tour¬
ist arrivals were up to 24 per cent
higher than during the same period of
1965. The U.S.A. had 14 per cent more
visitors from overseas and 14 per cent
more Americans travelled to Europe.
With the popularization of internation¬
al tourism, tourist spending abroad
has long since lost its luxury character.

295,000 to 410,000, in Thailand from
195,000 to 250,000 and in Hawaii from
429,000 to 610,000. Many new hotels
are being built in Australia, China,
Hong Kong, New Zealand, the Philip¬
pines and Thailand. Many airports
have been built, particularly in Malay¬
sia and the Republic of Korea.
In addition, many countries in the
region are developing their national
parks and tourist regions, training
qualified hotel staff and organizing
tourist offices. Malaysia and the Philip¬
pines are engaged on important
tourism development plans. Studies of
the tourist market and the economic
gains that can be derived from inter¬
national tourism are being made by
most of the countries.
In the Near and Middle East, the
total number of arrivals of foreign tra¬
vellers was generally higher in 1964
than in 1963, the increase for the Unit
in 1963 and by a further 12 per cent in
1964. In 1964, for the first time, the
country's currency earnings from tour¬
ism, according to certain estimates,
exceeded $1,000 million. For South
America, Central America and the Car¬
ibbean together, the number of tour¬
ists from the United States rose by
10 per cent from 1963 to 1964, but their
expenditure seems to have risen by
only one per cent. In the opposite
direction, the number of tourists from
the area to the United States rose by
24 per cent and their expenditure by
just over 10 per cent.
One of the crucial problems of
tourism is the staggering of holidays.
Despite measures taken against holi¬
day congestion in many countries co¬
ordination of paid holidays in large
firms and administrations, timing of
school holidays, displacement of offi¬
cial holidays and off-season price re-
International tourism is important not
only from an economic standpoint, but
also from social, educational and cultur¬
al viewpoints. And it contributes to a
better understanding among nations.
International tourism, which has
developed most actively since 1961,
is likely to expand even more rapidly
in years to come. Factors which
should contribute to this development
are: increases in living standards and
leisure time in many countries, the
need for relaxation and cultural better¬
ment, the desire to escape from big
cities, demographic pressure which
tends to increase the proportion of
young people and of the active popu¬
lation among whom international tour¬
ists are drawn, availability of cheaper
transport, and the virtual elimination in m
many countries of red tape and admin- JJ
istrative barriers to the free move¬
ment of the tourist.
