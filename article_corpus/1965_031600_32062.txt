WORLD POPULATION TO DOUBLE
BY END OF CENTURY
A population "explosion" of unprecedented size is taking
place in vast areas of the world. This extraordinary multi¬
plication of population poses tremendous economic and social
problems, particularly in the developing countries. These
problems will be examined by the World Population Confer¬
ence, a scientific meeting of experts on population, to be
held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in September 1965, under the
auspices of the United Nations and with the co-operation of
Unesco, FAO, WHO and other international organizations.
Below we publish some of the findings of a recent U.N. study
on world population prospects for the next 40 years.
^^»ORLD population, approximately 3,000 million
1960, will rise to the order of 5,300-6,800
million by the year 2000, according to "plausible long
range" projections contained in a United Nations report on
world population prospects. A figure near 6,000 million,
or double the 1960 number, "seems to be the most likely
expectation", according to the study.
The world total by the year 2000 could, however, rise to
a level 2.5 times the 1960 figure to 7,410 million if the
1960 fertility rate were to continue and if mortality were

to go on decreasing~at the rates which prevailed during the
1950's, an assumption, the report states, "not considered
likely to be borne out by future developments."
The study notes that "it is highly probable that events
will occur which will bring about changes in the present
population trends". "Certain tendencies of development
can now be discerned which have fairly definite implications
for the near future, and their possible implications for the
more remote future are also calculable, though with varying
degrees of uncertainly", it states.
The publication, "Provisional Refort on World Population
Prospects, as Assessed in 1963", was prepared by the
Population Branch of the United Nations Department of Eco¬
nomic and Social Affairs and is being circulated among gov¬
ernments, selected demographic institutes and individual
experts for comments and suggestions. On the basis of
comments received, a final report will be prepared for pub¬
lication in the United Nations series of population studies.
In 316 pages of text and tables, the report points out that:
In nearly all developing countries, there remains
considerable scope for rapid decreases in the death
rate, so that the prevailing tendency is one of accele¬
rating population growth;
The population of most developing countries is now
increasing at annual rates ranging from about 1.0 per
cent to 3.5 per cent, whereas the rates of most dev¬
eloped countries are between 0.5 and 1.7 per cent;
The population of Latin America by the end of the
century would be 3.6 times as large as in 1960; Africa
and South-East Asia would each have more than three
times as many inhabitants, East Asia 2.3 times as many;
those of Oceania, North America and the Soviet Union
would nearly double; and Europe's population would
be increased by one-third;

Sweden, the country of long life
By the year 2000, the share of world population in
the now less developed areas would rise from 71 per
cent In 1960 to 81 per cent. Very high population den¬
sities would be attained in East Asia and South Asia,
surpassing the density in Europe;
Migration in the future would probably tend to be on
a reduced scale and the relative demographic impor¬
tance of the population movements would be even
slighter;
The developed countries are undergoing a progres¬
sive increase in the proportion of aged persons in the
population, which is resulting in a gradual slowing-
down of population growth.
The report notes that world population growth has "cons¬
picuously accelerated", due to the immediate effects of
mortality decline, and may accelerate further for the same
reason. "It is inevitable, however, that this growth must
eventually slow down", the report says, but "if fertility does
not decline, the prospect of eventual slowing down of the
population growth is removed to a more distant future, and
the eventual size of the population will be still much larger."

Trends in Eight World Areas
A section of the publication deals with future population
projections up to the year 2000 by eight major areas: East
Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Soviet Union, Africa, Northern
America, Latin America and Oceania.
Included in this section is a report on population estimates
for mainland China. The report refers to the "scarcity and
uncertainty of data" and presents population projections
according to variously combined assumptions regarding
trends in mortality and fertility for mainland China. One of
the variants is computed on the assumption of low mortality
and late fertility decline. It gives the following figures on
the population estimate for mainland China:
1960	 648.1 million
1980 916.8 million
2000 1,210.0 million
The adjoining table compares the "medium" find the
"continued recent trends" projections of world population
by regions up to the year 2000 as calculated in the report:
Infant Deaths*
Despite the continuing downward trend in infant mortality
rates throughout much of the world, the range between the
lowest and the highest rates is still enormous. Thus, in
Sweden, the rate is 15.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live-births,
while the. recorded or estimated rates are 180.4 in Haiti,
165 in Turkey and 139.3 in Burma.
Very high infant mortality rates are also found in the
United Arab Republic (133.9 per 1,000 live-births), Indonesia
(125), Chile (116), the Turks and Caicos Islands (107.1) and
Ecuador (104).
At the lower end of the scale, in addition to Sweden, are
the Netherlands (15.8), Iceland (17), Norway (17.7), Finland
(18.0), New Zealand (19.6), Gibraltar (19.6), Australia (20.0),
Denmark (20.1) and Switzerland (21.2).
Expectation of Life*
Female babies born in Sweden now can expect to live
slightly over 75 years. Those born in the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Norway can look forward to almost 75
years of life; those born in France can expect to live
slightly over 74 years; and those born in Denmark, the Uni¬
ted States, Czechoslovakia and New Zealand have an aver¬
age number of years of life (expectation of life) between
73 and 74 years.
In addition, there are 19 other countries where life expec¬
tation for females is as high as 70 years or more, making
a total of 28 countries in which the expectation of life for
females is 70 years or over.
The highest expectancy for males born today is almost
72 years, and this applies to those born in Sweden. Male
babies in the Netherlands and Norway can expect to live
slightly over 71 years.
There are only three additional countries Denmark,
Israel (Jewish population) and Iceland where the longest
expected lifetime for male babies is 70 years or more,
making a total of six, as contrasted to the 28 for females.
