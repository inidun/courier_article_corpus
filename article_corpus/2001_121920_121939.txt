“Small re a c t o rs are a solution”
CHRISTIAN STOFFAËS
DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTING AT ELECTRICITÉ DE FRANCE.
Nuclear power is coal’s only real alternative to make massive cuts in CO2 emissions, but the
environmental movement is turning a deaf ear to this reality. Several countries in Europe,
including Germany, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland and Spain, have signed a moratorium on new
plants. In those countries, the need for new reactors will not be felt for another 20 years. On the
other hand,there is a major potential in the emerging countries, where the demand for electricity
is rising 3 to 6 percent a year. In the fight against the greenhouse effect, sustainable energy
sources have a role to play in rural areas. But it is impossible to imagine them powering
megalopolises of 20 million people in China,India and Southeast Asia.In those places, the choice
is between coal, gas and nuclear power. We want to promote a different kind of nuclear power,
with international safety monitoring managed by an inter-governmental agency and the
development of smaller, safer, 100 to200-megawatt reactors between [compared with an average
capacity of 1,000 megawatts today]. It is also necessary to set up an international system to
monitor nuclear materials and to outlaw plutonium, which is a byproduct of recycling military
waste. Today, the UN must consider inscribing nuclear power in flexibility mechanisms. ■
