Öur ancestors used objects
made of wood, which rotted,
and iron, which rusted. Today
we produce durable materials
like stainless steel and plastic,
but instead of being delighted at
how tough they are and holding
on to them as long as possible, we
throw them away at the earliest
opportunity, egged on by manu¬
facturers. In his book The Waste
Makers the American writer
Vance Packard quotes the indus¬
trial designer Brook Stevens as
saying: "Our whole economy is
based on planned obsolescence	
28
It isn't organized waste. It's a
sound contribution to the
American economy."
The more developed a country
is, the more waste it produces.
Waste is an excellent standard-of-
living indicator. Because we are
generating a rising tide of it and
because it is a significant source
of pollution, it has also become a
major cause for concern to
governments all over the planet.
The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) has drawn up the follow¬
ing categories for waste classifica¬
tion: municipal (mainly house
hold) waste; industrial waste; resi¬
due from the production of
energy; hospital and agricultural
waste, mining spoil and demoli¬
tion debris; dredge spoil, and
sewage sludge. (Nuclear wastes are
generally dealt with separately.)
We don't all throw away the
same amount of garbage. The
average person gets rid of 300 kg
of waste per year in Italy, 400 kg
in Japan, 600 kg in Finland, 860 kg
in the United States, and only 180
kg in Yaounde, Cameroon. But all
of these figures are constantly
rising.
The results of a survey conduct-
ed in France by CREDOC, the
French centre for the study and
observation of living conditions,
give some idea of the kind of
things that are thrown out: 34 per
cent is organic matter, 30 per cent
paper and cardboard, 13 per cent
glass, 10 per cent plastic, 7 per
cent metal, 4 per cent wood and 2
per cent textiles.
In the industrialized member
countries of OECD, where 90 to
100 per cent of garbage collection
is carried out by municipal author¬
ities, people tend not to worry
about what happens to their house¬
hold waste. Either it ends up in
an official dump, or landfill, or it
is taken to an incineration plant.
Storage and treatment capacities,
however, are under increasing
pressure because of the amounts
involved 423 million tonnes for
the OECD countries alone in
1989. With the spread of the
NIMBY ("Not in my back yard")
syndrome people are refusing to
live in the vicinity of landfills and
incineration plants, and it is
becoming virtually impossible to
build new plants. The odours
from landfills, and the endless
procession of trucks going to and
fro unquestionably represent a
serious disamenity to residents in
the immediate vicinity, not to
mention potential health hazards,
which are only now becoming the
subject of epidemiological stu¬
dies. Solutions must be found.
The first solution is to sort out
waste at source. Several garbage
bins in the kitchen, special
containers in the street, and a
well-organized selective collec¬
tion system are keys to efficient
recycling and to the conservation
of energy and raw materials.
Paper, glass and metal can easily
be sorted in this way. Plastic,
which is totally non-biodegra¬
dable, is very difficult to recycle.
Organic substances, as anyone
who has a garden knows, can be
allowed to decay for use as com¬
post to fertilize the soil.
Such an attitude to recycling
implies that we should all be
aware of the problem and make a
daily effort to solve it. This can
only become a habit if there is
considerable educational back¬
up. We can do our marketing with
our own bags or baskets and
refuse to accept plastic bags,
which are not a negligible source
of pollution. Another solution
would be to make it compulsory
for stores to take back cartons and
other forms of packaging, to
encourage the charging of a
deposit on glass and even plastic
bottles, the re-use of metal and
plastic containers and the sale of
unpackaged goods.
We have to act now, before we
are submerged in our own waste. A
recent example concerning the
German city of Ulm, in Bavaria, is
highly instructive. Ulm was export¬
ing 160 tonnes of household waste
daily to two landfills in France,
when it came to light that unscru¬
pulous carriers were mixing dan¬
gerous hospital or industrial waste
into their loads, and some were
even secretly dumping them at

beauty spots. France decided to
call a halt to this traffic. The Ulm
authorities could have built an
incinerator, but the proposal had
been vetoed by environmentalists,
who also opposed the establish¬
ment of a landfill. Now there is no
alternative but to build an incine¬
rator. However, construction will
take three years, and during this
period, garbage will pile up in and
around the city.
The most ordinary garbage bin
contains all sorts of hazardous,
toxic chemical substances found
in solvents, adhesives, batteries,
oven cleansers, disinfectants,
medicines, pesticides, and other
products. Once garbage has been
incinerated, the metals in it
such as lead, chrome, mercury or
arsenic remain and can easily
filter into the natural environ¬
ment if the ash is not perfectly
stored.
