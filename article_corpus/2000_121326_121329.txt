A bill to privatize Bolivia’s
government-owned water network
recently sparked off a “water war” that
grew into one of the Andean country’s
most serious social crises of the past few
years.
The conflict erupted in January 2000
when the price of drinking water was
tripled in the central Bolivian city of
C o c h a b a m b a , and peasants in the
surrounding arid region suddenly found
that the water they had been drawing
freely for generations no longer belonged
to them. City-dwellers accustomed to
subsidized water supplies were
confronted by the true market price,w h i l e
the peasants—mostly Quechua Indians
who had owned the water for centuries—
involuntarily found themselves customers
of Aguas del Tunari, a subsidiary of the
British firm International Water.
No clean water for 
one third of the people
These changes were the result of Law
2 0 2 9 ,a bill passed at the end of 1999 which
privatized state drinking water and sewage
d i s p o s a l . “ The law’s big mistake was to
privatize the sources of the water as well
since franchises are usually only applied to
administration of the service,” s a y s
Bolivian hydrologist Carlos Fe r n á n d e z
Ja u r e g u i , a UNESCO water expert.
F u r t h e r m o r e, the law was pushed through
without any kind of public hearings and
under pressure from the French fir m
Lyonnaise des Eaux,which is in charge of
the water supply in the capital, La Paz,
through a local company called Aguas de
I l l i m a n i .
In South A m e r i c a ’s poorest country,
where a third of the population has no
access to clean water and 70 percent of
people live below the poverty line, there are
plenty of reasons for social unrest. O n c e
b e g u n , the water conflict escalated into a
much wider rebellion lasting 10 chaotic
months and causing huge economic losses,
an 11-day state of siege and a dozen deaths.
The unrest was serious enough to
make the government cave in.In April,
Aguas del Tunari pulled out of the
contract they had signed with the state to
build a dam at Misicuni aimed at boosting

FREE OR FOREIGN:
THE WATER BATTLE IN BOLIVIA
Should water be supplied by local authorities or private companies? 
A violent conflict in Bolivia has recently shown that both 
can work, but only if the wishes of consumers are taken into account
Water wars

the Cochabamba region’s water supply.
But in spite of the citizens’ victory in the
“water war,”C o c h a b a m b a ’s basic problems
have not been solved.The city has no more
than five hours of water a day,and only 40
percent of farmers in the surrounding area
have access to clean water.“ The only way
to end Cochabamba’s water shortage is to
build the dam,” says Fernández Ja u r e g u i .
“ The other solutions are just sticking
p l a s t e r s.” Other plans, such as one to tap
into underground rivers,have so far made
little headway, while efforts to form a
cooperative or limited company with the
involvement of local people have come to
n o t h i n g.
Aside from the dam, the Misicuni plan
includes building a tunnel, w a t e r
p u r i fication plants and sewage farms to
the tune of $300 million. The generous
terms the privatization law
gave to contractors were
j u s t i fied in terms of the need to
attract enough investment to
pay for the multi-million-dollar
project on top of the money
provided by Bolivian
t a x p a y e r s. In the end,h o w e v e r,
the project backfired on
President Hugo Banzer’s
g o v e r n m e n t :Aguas del Tu n a r i
is demanding heavy
compensation for having to
withdraw from the project,
stoking fears that if the state
does not pay up, B o l i v i a ’s
reputation with foreign
investors will be harmed.
Taking culture and
customs into account
But the departure of these
foreign firms is not necessarily
the best solution, not even for
the poor. Due to their
international experience,
multinationals are usually
better value for money than
local public utilities, they use
the water more effectively and
pay better salaries to their
t e c h n i c i a n s. G o v e r n m e n t s, f o r
their part, must shield citizens
from the natural commercial
appetites of these giant water
c o m p a n i e s.
In Fernández Ja u r e g u i ’s
o p i n i o n , B o l i v i a ’s water
problems stem from
administrative failures, a n d
Bolivians are paying for their
inexperience in water
l e g i s l a t i o n .“ There aren’t any
laws or institutions and there
i s n ’t enough suitable
infrastructure to cope with the
water problem,” he says.
Other Latin A m e r i c a n
c o u n t r i e s, in contrast, h a v e
acquired useful experience in
solving the thorny confli c t s
caused by water.C o m m u n i t i e s
are very attached to the free
supply of water enjoyed by
previous generations, b u t
through frank and open
dialogue they can also come to understand
that it is a scarce resource which must now
be paid for. “ There were obviously other
ways to tackle the water problem in
B o l i v i a ,”says Fernández Ja u r e g u i .“ Wa t e r
legislation has to be based on consulting
local people, as other laws are. If local
c u l t u r e,customs and ways of life had been
taken into account, all these problems
could have been avoided.” ■
