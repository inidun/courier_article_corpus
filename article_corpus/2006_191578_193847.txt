                       scientists working in egypt learn a valuable lesson: 
                  if they are to involve local villagers in dryland conservation projects, 
                    they must first propose a solution to the community’s drinking water shortage.
harnessing The sun’s energy 
To make drinking waTer
he first meeting took place in a 
crowded Bedouin tent. We, the 
scientists working for the SUMA-
MAD (Sustainable Management 
of Marginal Drylands) project in 
Egypt, were there to assess the 
needs of the Bedouin community, 
the desert people who live in the 
Omayed Biosphere Reserve, and 
to offer our help. 
Initially, our intention was to ad-
vise this impoverished population 
against overgrazing and uprooting 
the sparse local vegetation. We 
thought we would work with them 
on several rotational grazing re-
gimes and dry farming to improve 
their livelihoods in a sustainable 
way. In the process we would gain 
some of their traditional knowledge 
on coping with drought. 
They had a different idea. One 
youth said immediately “We will take 
your advice, give you facilities, but 
give us drinking water first!” 
“Water for us is like gold, very pre-
cious and hard to find,” another Bed-
ouin continued. “The water in our 
wells is very salty. We get our fresh 
water from trucks and travel a long 
way to get it.” 
“We walk ten km carrying bu- 
ckets on our heads. Our population 
is growing, and so is our need for 
water,” an old woman with a face full 
of wrinkles joined in. “You civilized 
people, help us. We need water, 
not T-shirts with ‘protect the environ-
ment’ written on them!”
We could only agree that the 
Bedouins faced a critical situation. 
Omayed Biosphere Reserve (OBR) 
is part of Egypt’s Western Coastal 
Desert, located on its Mediterranean 
coastal edge, an area rich in natural 
resources. 
Groundwater, 
a scarcity
Water resources, however, are 
scarce and variable. Groundwater 
in the Omayed Biosphere Reserve 
comes from the Moghra and Wadi El 
Natrun Aquifers, which are saline due

 very precious 
and hard to find.”

to over-extraction and infiltration. 
In the four villages that OBR covers, 
with a population of about 12,000, 
there is not enough fresh water for 
irrigation, livestock and domestic 
needs, so many people use the salty 
and environmentally-damaging well 
water. Many travel far and pay high 
prices for drinking water delivered by 
trucks. Contaminated by storage in 
corroded tanks and open cisterns, it 
can cause serious intestinal diseases. 
At the meeting, the challenge to 
SUMAMAD was clear. If we wanted 
to involve OBR villagers in our dry-
land conservation projects, we had to 
propose a solution to their clean wa-
ter shortage: a desalination process 
for well water. Although large-scale 
desalination technologies have been 
used in Egypt for many years, they 
have not yet become widely available 
in a form that would fit the needs of 
the Bedouins. 
For the process to be sustainable 
in the OBR, water must be pumped 
in amounts permitting its natural re-
plenishment. The technique must be 
simple, clean, environmentally friend-
ly and compatible with local culture, 
and it must use minimum energy, fit 
the natural conditions and require 
minimum maintenance.
Fortunately, the solution already 
exists: a small-scale, solar-powered 
desalination system invented by a 
German scientist that meets all the 
above criteria.
With the community’s strong sup-
port, a pilot project was established 
in the OBR village of Awlad Gebreel. 
Inhabitants helped in every way they 
could, donating 150 square meters 
of land including a salt water well 
for the installation of the desalination 
units, a small building and a pump.
A solution that works
The system is now operating. Gravity 
causes raw water to run from the tank 
to four distillation units that separate 
salt from water using solar energy. 
About 100-120 litres of distillate are 
produced per day depending on the 
amount of sunlight. Even on cloudy 
days, there is enough to provide five 
families - 40 to 50 people - with drin- 
king water. The process also produ- 
ces salt crystals that can be used for 
tanning leather. 
To further the project’s participa-
tory aim, we held an open day with a 
workshop in the community meeting 
hall and later at the site. We explained 
at length how the system works and 
stressed the importance of hygienic 
conditions for the pump and freshwa-
ter tank. We also organized a special 
course for members of the community 
who will be responsible for the plant’s 
maintenance. 
The Bedouin community showed 
great appreciation. The women were 
especially happy that their children 
could now have clean water. They 
even expressed their feelings in songs, 
singing that “the dream of having wa-
ter flowing easily has come true.”
