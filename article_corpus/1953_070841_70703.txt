ONE of the greatest para-
doxes of the twentieth
century is that in an age
of aviation, radio and
nuclear physics, the people
in the world who cannot
read or write outnumber those who
can. Although in some places the
percentage of illiteracy is slight,
there are also vast areas where men
and women are mostly incapable of
reading the instructions they receive
or of signing their name to an agree-
ment, and yet the right of every
human being to education is, of all
the rights affirmed by the United
Nations Declaration of 1948, one of
the least contested.
Article 26, which deals with the
right to education, was adopted una-
nimously with two abstentions. The
terms of the article are couched in
no uncertain language, although na-
tions and families are given all rea-
sonable freedom in interpreting it :
elementary education must be free
and compulsory, technical and pro-
fessional education must be made
generarlly available, and higher
education must be equally access. ible
to all, on the basis of merit.
This is the culmination of a cen-
tury and a half of effort made in
almost all countries with a view to
a truly democratic distribution of
education. A hundred years ago, not
only did the immense majority of
human beings not know how to read
or write, even in the Western world,
but the idea of making education
accessible to all appeared, to many,
to be dangerously Utopian. Yet
today such ideas have triumphed
throughout the world.
The principle is now admitted, but
in many countries it is not applied.
There are countries where education
cannot be made accessible to all, for
lack of resources. There are those
again, where such a state of things
is not really desired, because certain
elements doggedly resist it, e. g.,
governments that are not in too
great a hurry to turn their subjects
into citizens capable of understand-
ing and criticizing the conduct of
public affairs.
Some people have been surprised
to find the word"compulsory"in an
article that deals only with"rights".
But to each right corresponds the
obligation of others to respect that
right. The right of children and
students is inseparable here from
the obligations of parents and the
State, whose responsibilities, in this
respect, are joint. There are other
rights, that those who hold them
can make prevail through the vote,
the power to act collectively, and so
forth. Youth is deprived of such
weapons.
Fears and objections
IT remains to examine what
education the child, the youth
and the young girl have the
right to receive ; and who, parents
or State, should decide this. There
is no single universal answer, because
conditions vary greatly and most
communities are very jealous of
their independence in this matter.
Some countries have made reser-
vations regarding possible inter-
ference by the State usurping the
role of families and inculcating ideas
contrary to those of the parents.
These reservations are of two kinds :
Some quarters fear that the State
might infringe the rights of minori-
ties, uproot legitimate traditions and
respected customs, obliterate region-
al characteristics, and establish arbi-
trary uniformity.
A like objection is raised through
fear of totalitarian methods ; people
are concerned lest the State should
mass produce little soldiers for the
regime, fanatically attached to a
party or man in power and dead to
the exercise of free thought and
civic responsibility.
The first category, then, fear the
misuse of new ideas in the education
of their children, and the second are
concerned to avoid tyrannical forms
of collective discipline. The first
fear that child will be deprived of
tested values and that his thinking
will drift towards anarchy. The
second are afraid that he will not
think at all.
To meet these apprehensions, Ar-
ticle 26 gives parents a prior right to
choose the kind of education that
shall be given to their children. But
this does not give them the right to
leave their children without educa-
tion. In any case, parents'rights
are not absolute ; they cease when
the child comes of age.
In many countries, the democratic
State has had to contend with

COURIER
family opposition that was not always
inspired by a desire to preserve tra-
ditions. It has often been a question
of greedily exploiting a child by
setting him to hard manual work
instead of teaching him how to read.
The idea of equality has some-
times led to misunderstanding. It is
not a case of equality in the results
of education, these depend upon
vocation and effort. Equality means
that every child should be given an
equal chance at the outset of its
pursuit of learning. Not so very long
ago, in certain countries that are
foremost in modern civilization, the
price of a good, complete education
was prohibitive for anyone of modest
means.
the Declaration of Independence of
the United States, seems to have
been the most keen and far-seeing
of the pioneers in this respect. For
him, the normal exercise of demo-
cracy necessarily implied a relatively
high degree of education among the
citizens.
Great pioneers
- w-EFFERSON wrote :"Popular edu-
) cation produces self-government,
and popular government is nei
ther sure nor efficacious if the
people are not educated".
It is largely due to him and to
Benjamin Franklin that the United
States was the first nation to
petrified in false formulae, or
pedantic and lifeless knowledge.
At the dawn of modern times, while
Comenius, Thomas More, Erasmus,
Bude, Vives and Montaigne planned
the lines or a powerful new culture,
Rabelais and later Moliere cruelly
satirized the shallow and soulless
learning of incompetent teachers
or doctors.
As regards rational pedagogy, this
came to growth mainly in the
nineteenth century. Its great
pioneer was Pestalozzi in Switzer-
land ; he died in 1827. Others were
Froebel, Miss Edgeworth (Scotland),
Channing and Horace Mann (United
States), and, more recently, Mrs.
Montessori and many others.
THE TOUCHSTONE
OF CIVILIZATION
What must be popularized are the
means of acquiring culture. Whether
it is thereafter obtained depends on
personal effort. What is essential is
that no human being who really
wishes to learn should be prevented
from doing so by reasons extraneous
to culture-distance, class preju-
dice, or financial obstacles.
In a word, the acquiring of culture
should be free and difficult, not
expensive and easy.
The history of education, at va-
rious periods, bears a clear relation
to the history of civilization at those
periods. But it must not be confused
with the history of the right to
education, a comparatively recent
ideal. There have been periods of
great culture when education was
fairly closely reserved for the pri-
vileged classes.
It was really only after the
recognition and proclamation, at the
end of the eighteenth century, of the
civil rights of the person, that it
became clear how valueless those
civil rights would prove if a citizen
did not enjoy, fully and equally with
others, the right to education.
Thomas Jefferson, the author of
establish free and compulsory edu-
cation. (It had been compulsory in
Sweden and Denmark since 1719,
but not free).
The great French advocates of the
idea that education should be
accessible to all were Condorcet,
Carnot, Guizot, and later Paul Bert
and Jules Ferry. In England, the
leaders of the movement were John
Stuart Mill and Huxley and, so far
as post-school education was con-
cerned, Owen, Kingsley and Ruskin ;
in Germany, Wilhelm VOn Humboldt ;
and in Russia, Tolstoy, who wrote
simple stories of a few lines for
children learning how to read.
For the very modern conquest of
the universal right to education, the
ground had been prepared, of course,
by all the great educators who,
throughout the ages, had tried
to promote study and raise its
level. Some struggled against the
ignorance that was too generally
accepted as being the lot of the
poor classes, of other races, or of
women.
Others fought against false forms
of culture, like dogmatic or routine'
education, sciences that had become
India, China and Persia have
always honoured the man of letters,
the scholar and the artist. Once
material conditions allow of elemen-
tary and subsequently higher educ-
ation accessible to all, these great
countries with their ancient tradi-
tions of culture will make tremen-
dous contributions to human civili-
zation, which must call, more than
ever before, upon the efforts of all
its children.
In our times, whole continents,
where lower standards of living
seemed inseparable from an equally
low standard of education, are now
adopting popular education, acces-
sible to all. This, as Jefferson said,
is essential to any democratic regime
based on popular endorsement.
Recognizing that human dignity
demands that all men be educated
with a view to the preservation of
justice, freedom and peace, the
United Nations wrote the right to
education into the Universal Decla-
ration of 1948.
Unesco, whose constitution enjoins
it"to advance through the educa-
tional, scientific and cultural
relations of the peoples of the world,
the objectives of international peace
and of the common welfare of
mankind", has a major role in the
implementation of this right.
In a"Basic Programme"drawn
up in 1950 Unesco broadly defined
its task with regard to education as
follows :"To help Member States to
ensure that their educational systems
are adequate in every way to meet
the needs of society and of the indi-
vidual."
As well as helping its Member
States to improve their existing
educational systems, Unesco has
taken the initiative in helping them
to extend these systems to meet new
needs. There are areas where
schools are almost unknown ; illi-
teracy is widespread and even on
the increase. There are deficient
and handicapped children who
require special treatment. Adult
education must be developed every-
where for"you cannot have a wholly
educated younger generation amid
an adult society remaining sunk in
ignorance."
Wider horizons
THAT is why Unesco, in colla-boration with its Member
States and with the United
Nations and some of the Specialized
Agencies has undertaken a pro-
gramme for the development of
what is known as.'fundamental
education", particularly intended for
the vast underdeveloped areas of
the world.
Literacy teaching is just one aspect
of fundamental education. It merely
opens up wider horizons which lead
to campaigns for the improvement
of health, living standards, food
production and hygiene. Its aim is
"to help people to achieve the social
and economic progress which will
enable them to take their place in
the modern world."
To bring fundamental education
to all who need it requires a great
many teachers possessing the right
techniques and teaching aids. As
a first step to meeting this need
Unesco has undertaken a bold expe-
riment-the creation of a network
of regional fundamental education
centres where technicians receive
practical training in this new branch
of education.
The basic purpose of these cen-
tres is to produce"teachers of
teachers', as graduates from the
courses return to their own countries
to staff similar centres organized on
more local lines. In these centres
teachers who are to work in the
field will be trained.
Already two regional centres are
operating. At Patzcuaro, Mexico,
the first course of student-teachers
has graduated and its members have
returned to countries in all parts of
Latin America. The second centre
serving Middle East countries was
opened in Sirs El Layan, Egypt, last
year.
One basic aim
To keep in touch with educa-tional developments through-
out the world, Unesco has
organized an Education Clearing
House which carries out enquiries
and studies in co-operation with the
International Bureau of Education
at Geneva, and with national docu-
mentation centres.
It has also sent international mis-
sions of educators to give technical
advice and assistance to Member
States which ask for such help.
Missions working on such subjects as
primary and secondary teaching,
literacy campaigns, adult education
in rural communities and education
for women, have visited such coun-
tries as Thailand, the Philippines,
Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, India,
Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Ecuador.
The United Nations Programme of
Technical Assistance has made it
possible to increase the number of
such missions.
Whether it concerns itself with
education for women, education for
international understanding, the
special problems of children, the
improvement of curricula, methods
and teaching materials, teaching
about JIuman Rights and United
Nations, or work for young people,
all Unesco's activities in these fields
have one basic aim-making the
principle of the right to education a
practical reality.
