BY POLITICS ALONE

THE MAN WITH THE ROSE. India's
distinguished statesman, Jawahar/a) Nehru
(1889-1964) played a leading role in the
work of the United Nations and in meetings
between nations. The rose that he usually
wore in his buttonhole remains a symbol
of his faith in a universal humanism which
inspired all his efforts ' for peace and
for the accession of his country to modern
life. "Man does not I1.3 by politics alone."
he said at Unesco's General Conference at
New Delhi, in 1956. Visiting Unesco in
1962, two years befe: his death, Jawa¬
harlal Nehru declared nnt 'ode the spirit
of tolerance is j.-'Oie .it'"<¿S£/v :'un ever
before. "Science and technology are ne¬
cessary," he said, "but a spiritual back¬
ground no less so." In September 1966,
Unesco and the Government Of India jointly
organized a round table on the role of
Jawaharlal Nehru in the modern world.
Earlier this year a Nehru Memorial Exhibi¬
tion was held in Unesco House, Paris. On
these pages we publish major passages
from an address that Jawaharlal Nehru
delivered at the inauguration of the Indian
Council for Cultural Relations in New
Delhi on April 9, 1950.
IATIONS, individuals and
groups talk of understanding one
another and it seems an obvious
thing that people should try to
understand one another and to learn
from one another. Yet, when I look
through the pages of history or study
current events I sometimes find that
people who know one another most,
quarrel most. Countries which are
next door to one another in Europe
or in Asia somehow seem to rub one
another up the wrong way, though
they know one another very thoroughly.
Thus knowledge, by itself, does not
lead to greater co-operation or friend¬
ship.
This is not a new thing. Even the
long pages of history show that. Has
there been something wrong in indi¬
vidual nations or in the approach to
this question? Or is it something else
that has not worked as it should have
done? When we talk of cultural rela¬
tions, the question that immediately
arises in my mind is what exactly is
the "culture" that people talk so much
about?
When I was younger in years, I
remember reading about German "kul-
tur" and of the attempts of the German
people to spread It by conquest and
other means. There was a big war to
spread this "kultur" and to resist it.
Every country and every individual
seems to have its peculiar idea of
cult ire.
When there is tal)< about cultural
relations although it is very good in
theory what actually happens is that
those peculiar ideas come into conflict
and instead of leading to friendship
they lead to more estrangement. It is
a basic question what is culture?
And I am certainly not competent to
give you a definition of it because
I have not found one.
One can see each nation and each
separate civilization developing its own
culture that had its roots in generations
hundreds and thousands of years ago.
One sees these nations being intima¬
tely moulded by the impulse that
initially starts a civilization going on
its long path. That conception Is
affected by other conceptions and one
sees action and interaction between
these varying conceptions.
There is, I suppose, no culture in the
world which is absolutely pristine,
pure and unaffected by any other
culture. It simply cannot be, just as
nobody can say that he belongs one
hundred per cent to a particular racial
type, because in the course of hun¬
dreds and thousands of years un¬
mistakable changes and mixtures have
occurred.
So culture is bound to get a little
mixed up, even though the basic
element of a particular national culture
remains dominant. If that kind of thing
goes on peacefully, there is no harm
in it. But it often leads to conflicts.
It sometimes leads a group to fear
that their culture is being overwhelmed
by what they consider to be an outside
or alien influence. Then they draw
themselves into a shell which isolates
them and prevents their thoughts and
ideas going out. That is an unhealthy
situation, because in any matter, and
much more so in what might be called
a cultural matter, stagnation is the
worst possible thing.
Culture, if it has any value, must
have a certain depth. It must also
have a certain dynamic character.
After all, culture depends on a vast
number of factors. If we leave out
what might be called the basic mould
that was given to it In the early stages
of a nation's or a people's growth, It
is affected by geography, by climate
and by all kinds of other factors. The
culture of Arabia is intimately governed
by the geography and the deserts of
Arabia because it grew up there. The
culture of India is influenced obviously,
as we see In our own literature, by
the Himalayas, the forests and the
great rivers of India among other
things. It was a natural growth from
the soil.
Of the various domains of culture
like architecture, music and literature
any two may mix together, as they

Learning more about a
civilization's historic past makes
for easier understanding of its
present characteristics. Art,
like literature, is a major road of
communication between cultures.

often did, and produce a happy
combination. But where there is an
attempt to improve something or the
other which does not naturally grow
and mould itself without uprooting
itself, conflict inevitably arises. Then
also comes something which to my
mind is basically opposed to all ideas
of culture. And that is the isolation of
the mind and the deliberate shutting
up of the mind to other influences.
My own view of India's history is
that we can almost measure the growth
and the advance of India and the
decline of India by relating them to
periods when India had her mind open
to the outside world and when she
wanted to close it up. The more she
closed it up, the more static she
whether of the in-
nation or society, is
dynamic, changing,
Whatever stops that
also injures it and
became. Life,
dividual, group,
essentially a
growing thing,
dynamic growth
undermines it.
We have had great religions and
they have had an enormous effect on
humanity. Yet, if I may say so with
all respect and without meaning any
ill to any person, those very religions,
in the measure that they made the
mind of man static, dogmatic and
bigoted, have had, to my mind, an evil
effect. The things they said may be
good but when it is claimed that the
last word has been said, society
becomes static.
The individual human being or race
or nation must necessarily have a
certain depth and certain roots some¬
where. They do not count for much
unless they have roots In the past,
which past is, after all, the accumu¬
lation of generations of experience and
some type of wisdom. It is essential
that you have that. Otherwise you
become just pale copies of something
which has no real meaning to you as
an individual or as a group.
On the other hand, one cannot live
In roots alone. Even roots wither
unless they come out in the sun and
the free air. Only then can the roots
give you sustenance. Only then can
there be a branching out and a
flowering. How, then, are you to
balance these two essential factors?
It is very difficult, because some
people think a great deal about the
flowers and the leaves on the
branches, forgetting that they only
flourish because there is a stout root
to sustain them. Others think so
much of the roots that no flowers or
leaves or branches are left: there Is
only a thick stem somewhere. So, the
question is how one is to achieve a
balance.
Does culture mean some inner
growth in the man? Of course, it must.
Does it mean the way he behaves to
others? Certainly it must. Does it
mean the capacity to understand the
other person? I suppose so. Does it
mean the capacity to make yourself
understood by the other person? I
suppose so. It means all that.

What is a scientific approach to life's problems?
It is one of seeking truth
by trial and error and experiment
50
A person who cannot understand
another's viewpoint is to that extent
limited in mind and culture, because
nobody, perhaps barring some very
extraordinary human beings, can pre¬
sume to have the fullest knowledge
and wisdom. The other party or the
other group may also have some
inkling of knowledge or wisdom or
truth, and, If we shut our minds to
that, then we not only deprive
ourselves of it but we cultivate an
attitude of mind which, I would say, is
opposed to that of a cultured man.
The cultured mind should have the
capacity to understand another view¬
point fully even though it cannot always
agree with it. The question of agree¬
ment or disagreement only arises when
you understand a thing. Otherwise it
is blind negation which is not a cul¬
tured approach to any question.
I should like to use another word
science. What is a scientific approach
to life's problems? I suppose It is
one of examining everything, of
seeking truth* by trial and error and
by experiment, of never saying that
this must be so, but trying to
understand why it is so and, if one
is convinced of it, of accepting it,
of having the capacity to change one's
notions the moment some other proof
is forthcoming, of having an open
mind which tries to imbibe the truth
wherever it is found. If that is culture,
how far is it represented in the modern
world and In the nations of today?
Obviously, if it was represented more
than it is, many of our problems,
national and international, would be
far easier to solve.

Symbol of the
spread of today's
technological
civilization,

automobile excites
the interest of an
African village child.
Civilizations,
cultures and ways
of life today mingle
as never before.
And problems
created by their
Interpénétration are
increasingly giving
way to the desire
for mutual
understanding.
Almost every country in the world
believes that it has some special
dispensation from Providence, that it
is of the chosen people or race and
that others, whether they are good or
bad, are somewhat inferior creatures.
It is extraordinary how this kind of
feeling persists in all nations of the
East as well as of the West without
exception. The nations of the East
are strongly entrenched in their own
ideas and convictions and sometimes
in their own sense of superiority about
certain matters.
Anyhow, in the course of the last
two or three hundred years, they have
received many knocks on the head
and they have been humiliated, they
have been debased and they have
been exploited. And so, in spite of
their feeling that they were superior
in many ways, they were forced to
admit that they could be knocked about
and exploited. To some extent, this
brought a sense of realism to them.
There was also an attempt to escape
from reality by saying that it was said
that we were not so advanced in
material and technical things but that
these were after all superficial things,
but nevertheless, we were superior in
essential things, in spiritual things, in
moral values. I have no doubt that
spiritual things and moral values are
ultimately more important than other
things, but the way one finds escape
in the thought that one is spiritually
superior, simply because one is inferior
in a material and physical sense, is
surprising. It does not follow by any
means. It is an escape from facing
up to the causes of one's degradation.
Nationalism, of course, is a curious
phenomenon which at a certain stage
in a country's history gives life, growth,
strength, and unity, but at the same
time, it has a tendency to limit one,
because one thinks of one's country
as something different from the rest
of the world. The perspective changes
and one is continuously thinking of
one's own struggles and virtues and
failings to the exclusion of other
thoughts.
The result is that the same nation¬
alism, which is the symbol of growth
for a people, becomes a symbol of the
cessation of that growth in the mind.
Nationalism, when it becomes success¬
ful, sometimes goes on spreading in
an aggressive way and becomes a
danger Internationally.
Whatever line of thought you follow,
you arrive at the conclusion that some
kind of balance must be found. Other¬
wise something that was good can turn
into evil. Culture, which is essentially
good, becomes not only static but
aggressive and something that breeds
conflict and hatred when looked at
from a wrong point of view. How you
are to find a balance I do not know.
Apart from the political and economic
problems of the age, perhaps, that
is the greatest problem today, because
behind it there is a tremendous conflict
in the spirit of man and a tremendous
search for something It cannot find.
We turn to economic theories
because they have an undoubted
importance. It Is folly to talk of culture
or even of God when human beings
starve and die. Before one can talk
about anything else one must provide
the normal essentials of life to human
beings. That is where economics
comes in. Human beings today are
not in the mood to tolerate this
suffering and starvation and inequality
when they see that the burden is not
equally shared. Others profit while
they themselves only bear the burden.
We have inevitably to deal with these
problems in economic and other ways
but I do think that behind it all there
is a tremendous psychological problem
in the minds of the people. It may
be that some people think about it
consciously and deliberately and
others rather unconsciously and dimly,
but that this conflict exists in the
spirit of man today is certain. How
it will be resolved I do not know.
One thing that troubles me is this:
people who understand one another
more and more begin often enough to
quarrel more and more. Nevertheless,
it does not follow from this that we
should not try to understand and that
is something which really cannot be
done in the context of the modern
world. Therefore, it becomes essential
that we try to understand one another
in the right way. The right way is
important. The right approach, the
friendly approach, is important, be¬
cause a friendly approach brings a
friendly response.
I have not the shadow of a doubt
that it is a fundamental rule of human
life that, if the approach is good, the
response is good. If the approach Is
bad, the response is likely to be bad,
too. So, If we approach our fellow
human beings or countries in a friendly
way with our minds and hearts open
and prepared to accept whatever good
comes to them and that does not
mean surrendering something that we
consider of essential value to truth or
to our genius then we shall be led
not only towards understanding but
the right type of understanding.
So I shall leave you to determine
what culture and wisdom really are.
We grow in learning, in knowledge and
In experience, till we have such an
enormous accumulation of them that it
becomes impossible to know exactly
where we stand. We are over¬
whelmed by all this and, at the same
time, somehow or other we have a
feeling that all these put together do
not necessarily represent a growth in
the wisdom of the human race.
I have a feeling that perhaps some
people who did not have all the
advantages of modern life and modern
science were essentially wiser than
most of us are. Whether or not we
shall be able in later times to combine
all this knowledge, scientific growth
and betterment of the human species
with true wisdom, I do not know. It
is a race between various forces.
I am reminded of the saying of a
very wise man who was a famous
Greek poet :
What else Is Wisdom ? What of man's
[endeavour or
God's high grace, so lovely and so
[great ?
To stand from fear set free, to breathe
[and wait,
To hold a hand uplifted over Hate,
And shall not Loveliness be loved for
[ever ?
(from Euripides' "Bacchae").
