SCIENCE ITS EVERYONE'S BUSI
FIVE young men were preparing to leave Bordeaux, France last month to sail
around the world in a 46 foot (14. 5 metres) catamaran, a double-hull boat whose
construction is based on a 2, 000 yearold Polynesian model. The five young men
are.'scientists". It will be at least five years before they return from the voyage
in their vessel, the.'Copula", During that time they expect to have demonstrated that
every person can be a scientist. For these voyagers ordinarily earn their livings,- _... _........ 4-....... lT".........-.......-.... 1.......-+l.-t : } Jt \' ; 1I1VC1'y, ( :\i ) ø. UIC. l\, ; Uø. UII,
a sculptor, an engineer, ansculptor, a  engineer, an
architect, and a film tech-
nician. Apart from the
engineer, they are all ama-
teur scientists. To full-
time professional scientists
these adventurers have
suddenly become valued
colleagues.
On behalf of a number
of French scientific institu-
tions, which have given
them short training courses
and supplied them with
simple instruments, they
are to make some investi-
gations-that is to learn
in detail things which have
never been known before.
Nothing elaborate, but the
collection of useful data.
For example, they have
been asked to obtain wher-
ever possible samples of
the oil from the liver of
the shark and to study the
effect of different waters
and different climates on
under-water paint.
Their notes read, in part :
"The crew will undertake to
record the boat's course
and speeds, to take the
surface temperature of the
water daily, if possible, at
the same hour, to note the
state of the-sea, and to log
the different ports of call,
the length of stay in each
port, and to indicate
whether the boat was in
dry dock. around or
afloat".
Miracle Maker Myth
A LTHOUGH amateurs, ifthey proceed bout the
collection of facts care-
fully they will be acting as
scientists. They have very
many famous predecessors :
Isaac Newton was a public
official ; Leeuwenhoek. the
father of microscopy, was a
Dutch merchant Benjamin
Franklin was a printer ; Chris-
tian Sprengler, who made
some of the first studies of
insect pollination, was a mi-
nister ; Herschel was an orga-
nist ; Joseph Priestley was a
divine who dabbled in che-
mistry ; Charles Darwin was
a country gentleman ; Gregor
Mendel, pioneer in genetics,
was a monk ; and Henri Fabre,
great investigator of the
insect world, was a school-
teacher in a French country
town.
The world-renowned British
Royal Society sprang up from
the efforts of a group of ama-
teurs. In the 18th and 19th
centuries it was only the
amateur who could make a
contribution as a scientist.
for science was the pursuit of
a leisured class, a gentlemanly
activity. This contributed in
part to the myth that has
grown up through the years
following that the scientist
is a being apart, a miracle-
maker who moves in special
ways his mysteries to perform.
This false view has been
reinforced in our century by
the fact that for many inves-
tigations mighty machines
and instruments are neces-
sary : for example, the elec-
tron microscope and the mass
spectrometer, the radio-active
isotope and the cyclotton. It
has come to be accepted that
to do scientific research much
equipment is needd.
A FLOATING"LABORATÓRY". In this double. huUed catamaran the
"Copula", five young men are setting out from Bordeaux, France, on a
round-the-world trip. During their live years'voyage they will collact
useful data for a number of French scientific institutions.
It is true that this is the
age of the organized scien-
tific worker, who is a phe-
nomenon of the last quar-
ter-century. It is since the
first world war that there
have grown up considerable

numbers of technicians who
earn their livelihood in
research laboratories. But the
amateur still has a contribu-
tion to make. His equipment
need be only as limited as
that belonging to Dr. Wollas-
ton, the great chemist and
physicist who was president
of the Royal Society in 1820.
"bering Up
My Laboratory"
SIR Richard Gregory in hisdelightful book"Disco-
very", tells how a foreign
scientist called on Wollaston
and asked to be shown round
his laboratory."Certainly",
said Wollaston, and rang the
bell."John,"he told the at-
tendant who entered,"bring
up my laboratory". Where-
upon John went out and re-
turned in a few minutes with
all Wollaston's apparatus on a
tea tray.
Even children have a proper
role to play as amateur scien-
tists, according to Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote :"Much
of it falls within the Capacity
of Persons, even of Children.
It consists of attending the
objects with which Nature pre-
sents us, in considering them
with Care, and admiring their
proper Beauties, etc..."
What the Rev. J. G. Wood,
an English clergyman and
amateur natural historian,
wrote in 1861 is still valid
today :"there is little doubt
but that if any one with an
observant mind were to set
himself to work determinately,
merely at the study of the
commonest weed or the most
familiar insect, he would, in
the course of some years'
patient labour, produce a
work that would be most
valuable to science".
Root Of All Research
THIS view was underlinedvigrously by Mr. E -
mond W. Sinnott, retir-
ing president of the American
Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, last Decem-
ber."'We sometimes forget
the still vast areas where
facts and principles of great
scientific value may be disco-
vered with no more complex
tools or techniques than are
at the command of any intel-
ligent layman", he said.
"Even to list all these
would be impossible here.
The exact distribution of
plant and animal species, the
records of flowering dates
through the years, the varia-
bility of wild species, bird
censuses and the records of
bird migration, the collection
and identification of fossils,
the distribution of minerals,
detailed local weather obser-
vations, records of meteorites
and of variable stars.
"Let us not disparage such
work as'anecdotal', as'mere'
natural history, simply be-
cause experiment and complex
apparatus play relatively
minor parts in it. Intelligent
observation is at the tot tom
of all research and opportu-
nities for this are almost
limitless. There is ample
room in science for the efforts
of a vast body of enthusiastic
laymen".
