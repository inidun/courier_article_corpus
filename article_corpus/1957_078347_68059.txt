THE ATOMIUM
Focal point
for millions
of visitors
Easily the most spectacular and unusual piece of architecture at
the World's Fair in Brussels will be the Atomium, consisting of
nine spheres representing the arrangement of atoms in an ele¬
mentary crystal of metal. Situated in the heart of the Fair, the
Atomium will be the centre of attraction for the 35 million
visitors who are expected there. This gigantic metallic construc¬
tion rising to a height of 360 feet will appear as an immense cube
resting on one of its angles, witheightspheres marking theextrem-
ities of the cube and one in the centre. The spheres, each
59 feet in diameter, will be connected to each other by tubes
10 feet in diameter equipped with escalators or travelling belts.
Every part of the remarkable structure will be open to the public.
The Atomium is symbolic of the importance to the future of the
world of knowledge relating to the structure of matter and
the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Thus, some of its spheres
large sound-proofed, thermically-insulated and air-conditioned
hallswill be used to display the peaceful uses of the atom. A
fast lift will take visitors up the central column to the top sphere
in 25 seconds. A special technical exhibition will be housed in a
circular pavilion built underneath the Atomium's base sphere.
Facings of the spheres will be in light alloy giving a brilliant
appearance. In the daytime the light casing is designed to give
off a dazzling reflection of sky, sun and clouds; at night, lights
moving around the spheres will imitate the rotation of electrons
around the nucleus of the atom.
Photos on these pages show the erection of the base of the
Atomium's central axis, a steel cylinder 50 feet high, the first
of the spheres taking shape and (last photo) the structure's
striking appearance as revealed by scale model.
