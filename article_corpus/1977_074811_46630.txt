at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Abidjan
(Ivory Coast). They gave a fuller treatment
of the subject of this article in a study on
"Black Civilization and Education" prepared
for Unesco and presented at the Second
World Black and African Festival ofArts and
Cultures held in Lagos (Nigeria) from 15
January to 12 February 1977.
O talk in proverbs is to invoke
the established order and
the authority of our ancestors.
The expression of a people's in¬
herited wisdom and code of behaviour,
proverbs are often used in traditional
societies as a means of instruction.
A study of such maxims reveals some
of the characteristics and underlying
principles of traditional education and
shows where they coincide and where
they conflict with those of modern
education.
The proverbs presented here are
those of the N'Zema people who live
in the south of the Ivory Coast, in
the region of Grand Lahou, Dabou,
Abidjan and Grand Bassam. Most
of them have a strong similarity to
the proverbs of two other Ivory Coast
peoples, the Agni and the Baoulé,
as well as certain affinities with those
of the Ashanti people of Ghana.
The main educational guidelines
laid down in the proverbs are ad¬
dressed on the one hand to adults
and parents bringing up their children,
and on the other to the children
themselves.
First of all, the proverbs impress
on parents that their children will
reflect themselves. Parents should
never forget that "A bird cannot beget
a mouse", and "Where the needle
goes, the thread follows."
Even when their children are diffi¬
cult, parents must not shirk their
responsibilities. After all, "If you
graze your knee, you can't pretend
that it's not part of your body."
Fortunately, not all children are
rascals. Some of them are favoured
by the gods from the moment they
are born, and, in the words of the
proverb, "A good meal doesn't need
onions or tomatoes."
It goes without saying that a
youngster isn't an adult and that
%

Africa's
wit and wisdom
children are neither as crafty nor as
quick on the uptake as they some¬
times make themselves out to be.
"A child knows how to run but he
doesn't know how to hide."
Sometimes children try to be too
clever by half and get caught out at
their own game. They do not realize
that "If a child stops his mother
from sleeping, then he won't sleep
either." )
Parents should remember that their
children are growing and changing
all the time. "You don't . take the
food off the fire until it's cooked"
and "You only pick palm-nuts when
they're ripe." But children will grow
up in time. "A dry coconut won't
stay on the tree forever." (In other
words, when the coconut is well and
truly ripe, it will drop unaided from
the tree.)
Children react to things in different
ways and so education should be
adapted to suit the character of each
child. "You don't put all animals
on a leash", says one proverb, while
according to another, "The dung
beetle says there are many ways of
carrying a load." (Some carry it on
their head, others on their back. As
for the dung beetle, he rolls it along
walking backwards.)
Children must be trusted, espe¬
cially if they really set their minds
on doing something: "A child who
wants to set his trap on a rock knows
where to put the snare."
Never give up hope where a young¬
ster is concerned. "If a cluster of
palm nuts drops from the tree and he
doesn't pick them up, then he'll pick
up the dead leaves."
If parents treat their children with
respect, then so will other people:
"If you kick your dog, the others will
give it a beating."
But still, a firm hand is necessary,
since "You don't rear a cock for it to
perch on your head and crow."
Means must be adapted to ends.
"You don't need a knife to eat an
egg", and "When the journey is short,
you don't rest on the way." And
again, "If you dig the grasshopper's
hole with a log, you'll block it up."
At the same time, adults should be
tolerant, and sometimes even turn
a blind eye when their children get
up to mischief.
It is best to let a child learn his
own lessons, so that he can find out
for himself what he needs to know.
Nothing can beat practical experience.
"Sweetness is enjoyed in the mouth",
goes the proverb. Sometimes it
may be advisable to let a child do
something even if he regrets it later
on. "The road doesn't say a word to
anyone." In other words it doesn't
tell travellers what has happened to
those who went before them; every¬
one must learn his own lessons.
The same idea is found in another
proverb: "It's only when you've
spilled the oil that you know where
you should have stored it."
In some cases children should be
given a helping hand when they insist
on doing something. One proverb
is quite categorical about this: "If
the child cries for the arrow you've
snatched from his hands so that he
wouldn't prick his finger, then sharpen
the point and give it him back."
Everyone has the, right to find out
for himself.
Grown-ups should help a child,
but never put themselves in his place.
"The child's share of cooked yam has
been cleaned and given to him",
goes the proverb, "but it's up to him
whether he eats it or not. We're
certainly not going to eat it for him."
Children must respect society's
institutions and the established order.
A youngster who remains attached
to his mother and his society won't
go far wrong. "The chicken that
follows its mother is the one that
eats the cockroach's paw." Contrari¬
wise, it's risky to keep out of social
life. "He who loses his father loses
his protection", says one proverb.
Others take up the same theme:
"The child who can't stand living
with his mother will end his days
on the skin of a black monkey" (in
other words, abandoned and without
a grave). "If your father and mother I

5 million, the Peul or Fulbe people are found
scattered in many parts of West Africa from Lake
Chad in the east to the Atlantic coast.
Originally nomadic herdsmen, some Peuls have
become sedentary farmers. It is thought
that the famous prehistoric rock-paintings
of Tassili in the Sahara may have been the work
of the Peuls' distant ancestors.
Ingeniously carved lids for
earthenware pots are used
by the Woyo people who
live near the mouth of the
Congo as a means of
illustrating proverbs.
On this "proverb lid", a
husband is pointing
indignantly at a bowl of
bananas, "a dish fit only for
bachelors", which his wife
has served him to show that
she is tired of cooking.

Wisdom worth
its weight in gold
The tiny ornamental figures shown here are metal
weights originally used for weighing gold dust
and nuggets by the peoples of southern Ghana
and of some parts of the Ivory Coast. Most of
them were cast in brass by the "lost wax" process,
but some are actually made of gold. Corresponding
to ancient units of weight based on the seeds
of certain plants, they were made in a variety
of forms: human figures, animals, musical
instruments and weapons. They speak a language
full of double meanings, illustrating ironic proverbs
or transmitting messages from creditors to debtors.
Even when their esoteric significance is not fully
understood, they remain small masterpieces
of humour and vivacity.
Unhappy landing
Its fins bristling, a caught
catfish takes stock of dry
land. With round bulbous
eyes it gapes at the cooking
pot and wonders how it is
going to be served up.
It has no say in the matter;
it has ceased to be master
of its fate. Moral: when the
game's up, give in gracefully,
however much pride you have
to swallow.
> give you advice and you don't listen,
then the tree-stumps on the road will
teach you a lesson or two." (In other
words, the ups and downs of life will
teach you how to live.) Another
proverb refers approvingly to the
child who accepts his society and is
accepted by society in his turn: "The
child who knows how to wash his
hands eats with the adults."
Society, like a mother, wants no¬
thing but good for its members, even
when it imposes restrictions on them.
After all, "The mother hen's claw
doesn't crush her pullet."
A number of N'Zema proverbs
stress the importance of respecting
existing institutions, the hierarchy,
and the time-honoured order of
things. Girls should be told what
is expected of their mothers: "The
hen knows when it's dawn, but it's
the rooster that crows." "As long as
you've got a head on your shoulders,
your knee doesn't wear a hat" and
"The chicken may get fat but he's
still a bird." "If a child's got good
lungs, he'll blow the trumpet but he
can't blow the chaff from the mortar."
He should know the natural order
of things: "The child doesn't break
the turtle-shell, he cracks the shell of
the snail." (He isn't strong enough
to break a turtle-shell and no one
expects him to be.)
The members of the community
should stick together and help each
other out, since "The right hand
washes the left hand and the left
hand washes the right hand", and
"It's the ear that hears the good news
about the healing medicine, but it's
the hand that takes it." Solidarity
and mutual assistance should prevail,
not only between children but also
between parents and children, bet¬
ween young and old. The proverb
declares that "The old man's hand
won't go through the narrow neck
of the jug, but the child's hand can't
reach the top of the food dryer."
At the same time people should
always a keep a cool head and know
when to act on their own initiative
when necessary: "The Azié monkey
says that we receive life one at a
time." (In other words, we are
born alone and we die alone, and so
we should avoid following the crowd
heedlessly.) "If raw meat is taboo
for you, then don't make friends
with the panther."
Everyone is responsible for his
own actions, and woe betide anyone
who tries to wriggle out of respon¬
sibility on the grounds that he is a
victim of heredity or because he
happened to be born on a certain
day. "Assuan says he doesn't get
on in life because he was born at
night." Success comes from hard
work: in the words of one proverb,
"The salt you beg will never season
a meal." If people work hard for
themselves, they won't be hamstrung
by having to rely on other people. A
man who depends on others is like a
blind man, and "The blind man doesn't
lose his temper in the middle of the
forest."
People should always persevere
and ignore risks and setbacks, re-

Four identical toucans quench their thirst

that we should never think that we are
"rare birds" nor underestimate those around us.

The back-stabber
Once upon a time,
the scorpion was a symbol
of good fortune; today it brings
bad luck. It has turned from
a faithful friend into
a remorseless enemy.
The message of the scorpion
is a warning to those
who would never dream that
a childhood friend could
betray them: "Beware."
(Brass weight from the
Ivory Coast)
membering the proverb that "As long
as your pursuer doesn't say he's tired,
don't you say that you are."
It is essential to look before you
leap, to know your own possibilities
and limitations and act accordingly.
"When the animals get together be¬
fore leaving, the tortoise has already
gone on ahead."
Though personal experience paves
the way to knowledge and success,
the wise man knows that some forms
of experience are futile and even dan¬
gerous. "You don't push an old man
to see where he will fall" and "Even
if you're tough you don't jump and
hurl yourself against a rock."
It is clear that these educational
maxims are deeply rooted in the way
of life of the societies which formu¬
lated them. Social life and the
structure of society also seem to
influence the theory of knowledge.
But what is the purpose of knowledge?
The purpose of knowledge is to
understand everything that has any
bearing whatever on mankind, whose
value is supreme: "Man", says the
proverb, "is superior to gold."
The fount of all knowledge is expe¬
rience, and the best experience is
that which is acquired slowly, over
the years. Experience is the touch¬
stone which tests the validity of
knowledge, and if a child can never
know as much as an adult it is pre¬
cisely because of his lack of expe¬
rience. ("He knows how to run but
not how to hide.") If he claims to
know it all, then he should be brought
down to earth. "When you were
born you didn't see how your mother
was decked out in her bridal clothes
to be taken to her husband."
It is in real life that we can see how
these proverbs are reflected in educa¬
tional principles. Education comes
from coping with situations as they
arise; there are no formal lessons in
morality or the civic virtues. Mis¬
behaviour is corrected as and when
it occurs. Children must prove them¬
selves though contact with their
playmates and with adults, picking
up what life has to teach them and
absorbing the ¡deals of the community
in which they live.
It can be said that some of the
principles which modern education
proudly claims to have discovered
or rediscovered have always been
unobtrusively observed in traditional
societies.
For example, when a school encou¬
rages a child from a traditional village
background to be self-reliant and to
use his own initiative, it is teaching
him qualities which his parents have
already begun to expect of him.
When a school teaches a child that
co-operation is a virtue, it in no way
contradicts values inculcated by
traditional education.
Of course, schools provide a syste¬
matic education, whereas education
in the traditional society is usually
less methodical. Theoretically, then,
a child who has attended school
ought simply to have fuller, more
precise and more systematic know¬
ledge than one who has had no
schooling.
In practice, however, certain con¬
flicts arise between traditional and
modern forms of education. The
fundamental divergence lies in the
fact that modern education tends to
develop a critical approach and to
call established values into question.
And so problems arise when children
pass from one system to another.
When parents in traditional village
society discover that their children,
in whom they have always inculcated
respect for the old, for the natural
order of things and for time-honoured
beliefs, have learned at school patterns
of behaviour which lead them to
question and challenge everything,
they inevitably feel disappointed.
They consider that schooling has
corrupted their children.
It also happens that children,
seeing their parents still attached
to traditional values, feel that they
are old-fashioned and find it hard to
fall back into step with them.
The conflict facing most school¬
children stems largely from a contra¬
diction between respect for existing
institutions and the established order,
which social stability demands, and
the critical approach and the ques¬
tioning of values, which are neces¬
sary in a constantly changing society.
