The computer takes a crack
at code-cracking
H	|ow do experts set about
deciphering an ancient, pictographic script?
The famous Rosetta Stone, inscribed in hiero¬
glyphic, demotic and Greek characters, provided
a key to the secrets of the hieroglyphs of ancient
Egypt. But in the case of the Indus script no such
key has been found and a much longer, more
painstaking study is required involving complex
semantic, phonetic, grammatical, historical,
statistical and other factors combined with infor¬
med guesswork.
For almost a decade, four Finnish experts,
Asko Parpóla, Seppo Koskenniemi, Simo Parpóla
and Pentti Aalto, of the Scandinavian Institute
of Asian Studies, Copenhagen, have been attempt¬
ing, with the aid of a computer, to decipher the
300 or so signs of the Indus script on the basis
of the 2,000 inscriptions on seals found in the
Indus valley. Their work is based on the as¬
sumption that the Indus script is related to
Dravidian. This assumption and the interpre¬
tations arrived at by the Finnish team have
been contested by other authorities.
We present below extracts from one of the
preliminary studies "Further Progress in the
Indus Script Decipherment", Special Publication
No. 3, published in 1970 by the Scandinavian
Institute of Asian Studies. They give the layman
an insight into the reasoning used by experts
in an attempt to crack the coded messages
that have come down to us over some 4,000 years.

must have been called after their "colours by the ancient
Dravidians, for the original Dravidian names coincide with
the colours associated with the planets in the Sanskrit and
Tamil sources: Mars = red; Mercury = green; Jupiter =
golden, yellow; Venus = white; Saturn = black.
The above order of the planets can be deduced from
the weekdays (Tuesday - Saturday) with which they are
associated in later Indian tradition.
"56 l = "& = the red star = Mars = Siva
Jfr = the black star = Saturn = Krsna
the white star = Venus = Balarama
the green star = Mercury = Ganesa
the golden star = Jupiter = Brahma
Jupiter's Sanskrit name is Brhaspati, which is also one
name of Brahma, the Creator of the Hindu trinity, called
also Brahmanaspati, Prajapati or Vacaspati. Since, on the
seal above, the god's name is one of the two planet signs
that had not yet been deciphered, it seemed worth .while
to examine whether the scene would fit to what is known
about Jupiter and Brahma.
The man kneeling in front of the horned personage in the
midst of the holy pipal or fig-tree (Ficus religiosa) is
obviously the god's high priest (note his "crown") and

corresponds to the sign
*& = an "man, servant"
at the end of the inscription [read from right to left]. Most
probably the sign
UJ (here "ritually pure")
on the other side of the tree also refers to him. The person
in the fig-tree must be the god himself, whose name in
the genitive case precedes the sign
i .if*.
The sacred tree of the planet Jupiter is according to the
Sanskrit sources, the asvattha or pipal tree; in Dravidian
this tree is aracu and aracan means besides "king" also the
planet Jupiter. The same tree, usually called udumbara,
is the sacred tree of the god Brahma/Prajapati, being a
symbol of life and fertility and the place of the soul after
the death.
In the Brahmana texts we have numerous variations of
the story of how Prajapati created these worlds. They used
to begin by telling that Prajapati hatched himself and then
created these three worlds, which he then hatched, etc.
In the Vedic agnicayana ritual where Prajapati is the central
deity, he is represented by a golden man; the acts re'ating
to this figure are accompanied by verses of "he who was
born of golden womb". In the Mahabharata it is told that
Brahma was hatched out of the golden egg that lay floating
on primeval waters.
Jupiter is the golden planet, and pon "gold" is also the
Tamil name of the planet Jupiter. If we allow for a slight
difference of the final nasal, we have a homophone which
would give a good explanation to the scratch inside the fish
in the pictogram

pun "wound, scratch"
Brhaspati and Brahmanaspati must mean approximately
the same as Prajapati and be translations into Sanskrit of
a Dravidian epithet meaning "the lord of creation and life".
But Brahma also has a name Vacaspati "the lord of speech",
and in fact he is the husband of Vac, "Speech, Voice", who
is identical with Sarasvati the goddess of wisdom (= Tamil
kalai-makal) and the life-giving holy river of north-west India.
It is not a mere coincidence that the best Dravidian word
for (the principle of) "life", uy, uyir, ucir, means besides
^life; salvation, reanimation" (= Sanskrit Brahman) and
"propagation, emitting semen" (= Sanskrit praja) also
"speech" (= Sanskrit vac), the basic meaning being
"breath" (= Sanskrit prana), an important concept intimately
connected with Brahma/Prajapati.
Brahma and Sarasvati had seven children, the "seven
sages" who are the stars of the constellation of Great Bear.
The planet Jupiter also has seven children, six sons and one
daughter by Candramasi, Seven persons are seen depicted
at the bottom of the seal.
Brahma is represented as riding on a wild goose (hamsa),
which symbolizes the soul and the sun, and the Mahabharata
tells in several places how Prajapati assumed the shape of
a golden goose, which is the first incarnation of Visnu, the
supreme soul. Also in Tamil literature Brahma is said
to have a swan in his banner. But in the Vedic ritual the
animal specially connected with Prajapati is the horse, the
foremost symbol of sun and fertility of the Aryans. The
vahana or "vehicle" of the planet Jupiter is a yellow horse
or goose. (Is the unclear object in the seal a goose?)
The planet Jupiter holds in his hand a lotus, and is some¬
times represented as sitting on a lotus. The lotus is, like
the fig tree, an important symbol of fertility (of kantal, kanta,
katta "bulbous root of lotus" and kanta "male, husband")
and also the seat of Brahma, who according to one legend
sprang from a lotus that came out of Visnu's navel. That
Jupiter was a god of fertility like Prajapati is evident also
from the great importance that was attached to the
favourable position of Jupiter in the case of marriages in
post-Vedic times.
The significance of the human-headed ram on the seal is
not yet clear.

The

the tiger
HE Indus seals usually
have in addition to the pictographic
text a design of an animal. The
ancient Tamil kings, gods, tribes, etc.,
had totemic emblems depicted in their
flags, seals, houses, etc., consisting
mostly of different kinds of animals.
Ancient Tamil literature has preserved
a most interesting account of the use
of these seals. It is said that mer-

But in order to show that it is not

that is meant, the other side is left
open to show that a drum beaten on

chandise was sealed with emblems of
respective kings. . . Goods unloaded
from ship to shore and vice versa, and
the articles gathered on the shore,
were sealed before letting them go
out of the customs yard. The act of
sealing the bags is explained in the
words pulí porittu puram pokki, which
means "the tiger (sign) was stamped
and was passed out". The extant
Indus sealings were stamped on clay
tablets attached to bales of goods.
The word venkai means in Dravidian
both "kino tree" and "tiger", both
totemic emblems of clans. The colour
of the tiger's stripes bears a strong
resemblance to the colour of the
flowers of the kino tree. "It was on
account of this resemblance that the
young maidens of the Kuravar phratry
shouted out 'Tiger, Tiger' when they
were plucking the flowers of the venkai
tree." This looks almost like a des¬
cription of a fairly common scene
depicted on the Indus seals, where a
person is squatting in a tree and
extending one of his arms with some
object (flower?) in the hand towards
a tiger beneath him.
the sign, which was probably associated
with some special priestly act depicted
on the seal, opposite, showing a female
figure with a bull's head and tail and
legs, reaching towards a horned tiger.
On this seal the text, unfortunately
broken, contains the sign Ps
with a tail added:^^C
This tail is otherwise known from
the sign^-^Ç, a variant of vfi/, both
of which occur in contexts indicating
a meaning "priestess".
If £^ is tampi/nampi (used also
as god's epithet like ]& )
and V%) is its feminine form, the
word is tankai/nankai "younger sis¬
ter; woman of distinction". The tail
added to the pictograph of course
associates it with the priestess's dress,
but also probably has a phonetic value.
The word for "tail" in Dravidian is val,
which has an exact homophone val
meaning "(ceremonially) pure, white,
holy", used with special reference to
virgins. In Egyptian the word w' b
"(ordinary) priest" literally means
"pure, clean (person)".
