m ROM the moment on
a November day in 1966, when he was
thrown to the mat during wrestling
practice at St. Albans School in Wash¬
ington (U.S.A.), and heard his neck
snap, he knew what had happened.
"My body from the neck down was
floating in space. Only my head was
on the ground."
"The doctors", said William's mother
calmly, "told him right away, 'Gene, we
can't establish a close personal rela¬
tionship with you. Ninety-seven per¬
cent of our spinal cord patients die." "
While in traction for six weeks in the
intensive care unit of a local hospital,
Williams heard patients in adjoining
beds enter, conscious or unconscious,
and eventually die.
One death was more important than
others. Williams says it, in part, "ins¬
pired me."
A construction worker who had fallen
five stories was brought in uncons¬
cious. "I heard about the accident on
the radio", recalled Williams. "He
never regained consciousness and I
never saw him, but for five days I lis¬
tened to his breathing in the next bed."
At some deep level, Williams feels, he
decided not to quit and die. And then
he almost did die. Not once, but
several times.
With holes drilled in his skull for
traction, he developed bursitis of the
jaw, couldn't eat and lost 75 pounds.
Like all longterm bed patients, he was
prey to Infection. In February, a blad¬
der infection sent his fever over
104 degrees F.
"The doctors told me, 'See, Mrs
Williams? We told you not to get
your hopes up' " said the mother.
Desperate and furious, the mother
cursed the specialists "who had almost
killed Gene", and followed the advice
of "a great male practical nurse."
The two packed the emaciated boy

in ice and gave him alcohol baths for
eight hours until the fever abated.
In June, 1967, Mrs. Williams, looking
almost as haggard as her son, wheeled
the patient out of the hospital against
doctors' orders and off to the Rusk
Institute In New York City.
Williams entered Rusk "just skin and
bones", according to Dr. Donald Co-
valt, associate director of the institute
at New York University.
His injury, a cervical fracture (bet¬
ween the fifth and sixth vertebrae), left
Williams a "high-level quadriplegic"
that is, paralyzed in all four extremities.
The long rehabilitation in which Wil¬
liams learned to use what arm, wrist
and chest muscles he had left was,
according to both Williams and his
father, "one long athletic event. The
simplest movement was a wrestling
match."
Williams entered Rusk a near-Invalid,
but left driving a car.
With limited use of arms and wrists,
but none of the hands, Williams could
wheel himself to his car, hoist himself
into the front seat, haul his wheel¬
chair in and drive. "The car was a
lifesaver for him", said his father.
The story of Gene Williams, who is
now 24, is "a mile or two beyond any¬
thing I've ever seen here before",
according to Dr. Covalt. The patient
does not see it that way.
"Once I decided not to die, a clear
choice never presented itself", he said.
"You go with what you've got."
He went back to St. Albans to finish
his senior year In 1968 and to help
coach the football team. "He was a
damn good coach", said St. Albans
athletic director Gary Gardiner, who
remembers Williams's chair being
carried down the cathedral steps at
graduation by teammates.
Refusing to give up the pleasures
he could retain, Williams began going
anywhere he pleased, becoming fier¬
cely independent. "Most 'wheelies'
call ahead everywhere to find out if
there are accomodations for them.
How high the curbs are. I show up
at restaurants, movies, anywhere, and
and then cope with what's there."
In 1970, with a huge supply of cran¬
berry juice to fight the bladder and
kidney stones and infections that
plague and often kill paraplegics,
Williams went to Harvard.
There his appetite ranged from musi-
cology (his major) and political
science, to psychosomatic médecine
and neuroanatomy.
During his Harvard years, he took
two trips to Mexico alone. The Inde¬
pendence of the Mexico trips, picking
up hitchhikers, caring for himself, is
to Dr. Covalt the most remarkable per¬
formance by a quadriplegic in his
experience, illustrating why "this man
will be a success in whatever he
attempts."
Praise for his fortitude is one of
Williams's principal irritations. "This
idea of me attacking life is really stu¬
pid." he said. Every attempt he makes
to live normally is seen as another
example of his abnormality.
"I would like to think I would have
developed the same way I have,
without the injury", said Williams. He
is not certain, nor ever can be.
Would the original Gene Williams
have become passionately interested
in music and the healing arts? Would
he have been in the march on the
Pentagon in a wheelchair? Would he
now be a jazz percussionist with his
own progressive group in Cambridge?
"I like to think so. But really, I can't
say whether I'm better off or worse off
than if I hadn't been hurt."
Doctors predict a near-normal life
expectancy for him. M
