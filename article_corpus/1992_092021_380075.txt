The world'sforests have been called
"the lungs of the planet". Is this an
accurate metaphor?
The metaphor arises from the
continuous exchange of carbon
dioxide and oxygen that takes place
between living organisms and the
environment. Living plants take up
carbon dioxide and give offoxygen.
When they are dead, the reverse
occurs and they take up oxygen and
give off carbon dioxide. If all the
forests were wiped off the face of
the Earth, the amount of oxygen in
the atmosphere would diminish and
the amount ofcarbon dioxide would
increase. However, the change in
the amount of oxygen in the atmo¬
sphere that this would entail would
be only temporary furthermore, the
concentration of oxygen in the
atmosphere is such that, as far as
humans are concerned, the change
would be imperceptible.
In fact, the prime role played by
forests, in particular the tropical
forests, in the atmospheric balance
and the Earth's climate relates to
the part they play in the water cycle.
Deforestation has serious reper¬
cussions on the process of evapo¬
ration and the rainfall régime. When
forests are destroyed, the water
balance of the atmosphere is upset
and this has a direct influence on
the climate. Massive deforestation
would also entail a serious reduc
tion in biodiversity, a subject that I
shall not go into more deeply here.
How can the poorest countries
achieve a level ofgrowth and welfare
compatible with the protection ofthe
environment?
That problem is more than just
circumstantial, which is to say it
cannot simply be solved, in a rather
paternalistic way, by the rich coun¬
tries providing money. The roots of
the problem are structural. The
developing countries need and
Unesco plays a central role here to
acquire know-how: without educa¬
tion, awareness, management train¬
ing, they will not be able to resolve
their difficulties. Meanwhile, as a
result of the prevailing monetary
system and the market economy,
the terms oftrade are against them
and give them no room for
manoeuvre.
To escape from this impasse, it
will be necessary to change the rules
of the international marketplace.
Otherwise developing countries will
be forced to destroy forests, impov¬
erish the soil, and only cultivate
cocoa, coffee or other export crops,
thereby aggravating the degradation
of their environment. The relation¬
ship between the North and the
South should be modified struc¬
turally. Instead of talking about aid
for the Third World, we should be
talking about justice and equity for it.
Energy consumption per head of
population is often used as an index
ofdevelopment. Yet theproduction of
energy under present conditions is a
major cause ofpollution. Isn't there
a contradiction between economic
growth and the protection of the
environment?
Yes, there is a conflict between
development as it is presently
understood and the environment.
The objective of the Rio conference
was to prove that environment and
development are two sides of the
same problem. As long as we refuse
to admit that the two issues are
complementary, we will continue
to experience setbacks in both
domains. Despite growing aware¬
ness among governments and
peoples, in spite of the efforts made
and programmes set up here and
there, environmental policy over
the past twenty years has been an
almost total failure. As a result, we
have also lost out where develop¬
ment is concerned.
There is undeniably a link be¬
tween development and energy
consumption, but it is less direct
than it is often thought to be. Let's
take an example: the United States
consumes much more energy than
the European countries, but should
one conclude from that that it is
more developed than Germany? No.
The United States could maintain

the same level ofdevelopment while
using maybe 20 to 30 per cent less
energy. To sum up, considerable
energy savings can be made without
slowing down development. But a
minimum of energy is of course
necessary	
Will the so-called "clean", renewable
energy sourcessolar energy, tidal
powerandso on one dayproduce suf¬
ficientlysatisfactory results to be wide¬
ly used? Whatare their realprospects ?
The priority for the time being
is to conserve and economize on
existing energy sources rather than
to produce new ones, however
necessary they may seem to be.
Both in the developed countries
and elsewhere, there is an urgent
need to reduce energy consump¬
tion without slowing down devel¬
opment two perfectly compatible
objectives. The new energy sources
are already producing results, but
on a limited scale providing heat¬
ing in villages, or working wells in
the desert but the main thing is
that they are notyet sufficiently pro¬
ductive. It is a fantasy to think they
could replace existing energy
sources in ten or even fifteen years.
It will certainly take much longer
than that. They still cost too much.
And a lot more progress will have to
be made on the scientific and tech¬
nical fronts before these new ener¬
gy sources replace the older ones
everywhere.
Protecting the environment is every¬
one's business. Don't you think that
Ministries ofEducation in every coun¬
try ofthe globe should be made aware
of this point, so that every child can
learn from a very early age how to
respond to the situation? What is being
done about this?
This is a very important point.
The role of education at both the
primary and the secondary level is
crucial. But there's more to it than
that. The people responsible for
development should also be train¬
ed in ecology; they must be fully
aware of the repercussions of the
economic model they choose. We
must make ecology seem a force for
action, a broadly-based movement.
People who have become aware of
the problems of the environment
can put pressure on their govern¬
ments which tend to act in the
short term, within the narrow time¬
frame of their mandates to take a
longer-term view of things. Well-
informed people could bring about
policy changes byusing their power
as voters. Direct action of this kind
must rest on a solid scientific foun¬
dation if it is to be effective, not just
on emotional reactions as is still too
often the case.
I repeat, whether in the Third
World or in the developed coun¬
tries, the problem of the environ¬
ment will remain unsolved as long
as the norms of development
remain unchanged. The two crises
cannot be separated, which is why
the Rio conference has marked a
turning-point: to think one can
resolve them independentiy is Uto¬
pian. The only chance for a solu¬
tion rests in a joint approach. The
problem of the environment is in
realityjust a consequence, an aspect
of the type ofdevelopment we know
today. No country is unaffected, for
the world economy is completely
interdependent and the environ¬
ment ignores frontiers. No country
is so great or powerful that it can
afford to say, "No, I don't want to
change, and what happens else¬
where doesn't matter tome. ..", for
the scale of these problems is global,
and none of them can be resolved
without a sense of global solidarity.
