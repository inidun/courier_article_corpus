Is it any wonder that the English word “ ri va l ”
d e ri ves from the Latin “ ri va l i s ” ,meaning people
who live on opposite banks of a ri ver? All of the
214 largest ri ver basins in the world—home to about
40 per cent of the globe’s total population—are used
by more than one nat i o n .E ven the most cordial and
c o - o p e r at i ve of neighbouring nations have found it
d i f ficult to achieve acceptable arrangements for their
t r a n s b o u n d a ry surface wat e rs.
As the world gropes for solutions to disputes ove r
water resources, many who are concerned about
water issues are increasingly attracted to the idea of
setting up free market trading systems for water.
H owe ve r , market solutions to establishing
s overeignty over and control of water resources are
fraught with danger. Rather, we should look to the
body of international law that countries have been
s l owly developing by drawing on ancient pri n c i p l e s
of sharing dating back centuries.
It must be noted at the outset that countries have
recognized that water is too vital a resource for
nations to go to war. Throughout the many wars
fought in the twentieth century, water facilities have
by and large escaped unscat h e d . In the three major
wa rs between Pakistan and India, for example,
water could have been used as a formidable we a p o n
by both sides. Not only did they both refuse this
deadly option, they implemented water shari n g
agreements even as bullets were flying. Low-level
violence punctuated by full-fledged war has been
s i m m e ring in the Jordan Valley since the 1920s
b e t ween Israel and the neighbouring Arab nat i o n s.
Yet you can count on one hand the number of
times water supplies have been specifically targeted.
H owe ve r , the absence of “ water wa rs ” does not
mean that there aren’t serious disputes brewing,
p a rticularly in arid regions like the Middle East

where already scarce water supplies are in
unprecedented demand as populations gr ow and
lifestyles change with gr e ater industri a l i z at i o n .T h e s e
disputes are generally in the form of diplomat i c
c o n t r ove rs i e s , although sometimes more dramat i c
c o n f r o n t ations ari s e .E ve ry transborder water resource
is coveted by the countries that share the resource.
They carefully monitor the amounts used by
n e i g h b o u rs.
Markets are now much in vogue as ideal
institutions for resolving disputes over control of
water resources and for managing the use of those
resources effic i e n t l y. B a s i c a l l y, the aim is to set up a
trading system by which wat e r - rich countries sell
supplies to those in need. T h e o r e t i c a l l y, m a r k e t s
ensure effic i e n cy and peace. C o u n t ries don’t dare
waste a resource for which they have paid dearly. A t
the same time, the market supposedly helps resolve
water disputes: if one country infringes on the
“ p r o p e rt y ” of another, c o m p e n s ation can be sought
in a court .
A resource with no respect
for borders
Twenty ye a rs ago, few experts or policy - m a k e rs
would have considered such a proposal seri o u s l y.
To d ay, the concept is gaining ground thanks to the
a c t i ve promotion of major lending institutions like the
World Bank and other multinational organizat i o n s.
Pa rt of the enthusiasm deri ves from the triumph of
We s t e rn-style free markets and the assumption that
there are no credible altern at i ves for efficiently
m a n a ging resources. But the market support e rs
overlook a critical fa c t : wat e r , unlike eve ry other
n atural resource except the air we breat h e , is ambient.
It move s. It doesn’t respect borders and so cannot be
controlled by any single entity.Yet for a market to
wo r k , clear ow n e rship rights have to be recognized
before any good can be traded. But how can yo u
d e t e rmine who owns a resource which ebbs and
swells as it moves from one country to the next?
True water markets have rarely existed in the
p a s t , and there is little reason to believe they will in
the future.A curs o ry look at the case of the Nile Va l l e y
highlights the limitations of market-approaches.
The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia to Sudan and
on to Egypt. As is commonly the case, countries
lower down the basin tend to be richer and more
developed than those further up. This is because
small rivers and streams feed into the river as it
flows, bringing water and nutrients that leave the
lower basin more fertile. Furthermore, the lower
basin generally is relat i vely flat , while the upper
basin generally is mountainous, making agri c u l t u r a l
d e velopment easier in the lower basin. I n d e e d ,
Egypt,with a per capita gross domestic product of
$ 6 3 0 / ye a r , is wealthier than Sudan (GDP
$ 5 4 0 / ye a r ) , and both countries are far more afflu e n t
than upstream Ethiopia (GDP $120/year).
Nevertheless,Ethiopia does get the water first.
One might think, t h e r e f o r e , t h at the Ethiopian
government is in a position of strength and can do
what it wants with the Blue Nile. It could build a
Four international rivers
The Jordan
The river: The 93-km-long Jordan drains part of the
territories of Israel,Jordan,Lebanon and Syria,four of the
states most involved in regional hostilities in the last half
century. It rises in four tributaries, the Yarmouk in Syria,the
Banias in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the Hasbani in
I s raeli-occupied southern Lebanon, and the Dan in Isra e l .B y
virtue of the 1967 war and the “security zone”created in
south Lebanon in the early 1980s, I s rael is the upstream
riparian on the upper Jordan system;Syria is upstream on
the Yarmouk.
P roblems and pro s p e c t s : Jordan and the Pa l e s t i n i a n s,
as downstream riparians of Israel and Syria, are in the worst
position in the basin. J o r d a n ’s dependence on the river
system is particularly great, since apart from a few w a d i s—
watercourses that are dry except in the rainy season—it
has no other important sources of fresh wa t e r. Th r e e
attempts have been made to establish an international
water management regime (in 1953-55, 1 9 7 6 - 8 1 , a n d
1987-90) but each came to a halt because of an inability
to include all riparian states in the proposed arra n g e m e n t .
A water resources working group was set up as part of the
Middle East peace process in 1995 and 1996, but wa t e r
politics specialist Miriam R. Lowi of the Center of
International Studies at Princeton University notes that
“the implementation of a water agreement will not be
effected until the political conflict has reached closure.”
Four international rivers
The Nile
The river:The Nile is 6,700 km long from its most distant
source to its mouth in the Mediterranean,and drains one-
tenth of the African continent.The river system is composed
of two major tributaries, the White Nile and the Blue Nile,
which rise in Lake Victoria (Ke n ya , R wa n d a , Ta n z a n i a ,
Uganda) and Lake Tana (Ethiopia), r e s p e c t i v e l y. The nine
nations of the Nile basin are Rwa n d a , B u r u n d i , t h e
D e m o c ratic Republic of the Congo, Ta n z a n i a , Ke n ya ,
Uganda,Ethiopia,Sudan and Egypt.
P roblems and pro s p e c t s : The vast majority of the river’s
flo w, estimated at 84 billion m3 a n n u a l l y, is used by Egypt,
by virtue of a 1959 treaty between Egypt and Sudan which
allocates to the two countries an amount of Nile wa t e r
that adds up to nearly 90% of the river’s annual flow.
Upstream nations such as Ethiopia want to harness the
N i l e ’s waters to provide economic prosperity for their
growing population and are challenging Egyptian and
Sudanese claims.

dam, for example, or develop irrigation systems.
Ethiopia, however, is too poor to pay for this kind
of infrastructure on its ow n .E g y p t , which fears any
interference that might interfere with the flows of
water down the Blue Nile,has succeeded in using
its political clout within multilateral lending
o r g a n i z ations like the World Bank to block Ethiopia’s
applications for financial assistance to exploit the
ri ve r. (The situation may be changi n g, h owe ve r ,a s
the Egyptian gove rnment recently let pass an
Ethiopian loan application with the World Bank
for a small-scale irrigation project.)
Who owns what?
U l t i m at e l y, Egypt claims an absolute right to the
integrity of the river. According to this principle,
Ethiopia should do nothing that might affect the
quantity and quality of water currently flowing to
Egypt. But such a claim deprives Ethiopia of any
means of developing its agriculture and condemns
the country to continued dependence on
international food aid to stave off mass starvation.
Imagine that Egypt and Ethiopia decide to set
up a water market. How would they resolve their
differences? Ethiopia in theory could buy the right
to develop the ri ver from Egypt, although in practice
the price of such a right is likely to be much higher
than it could afford. Or Egypt could compensate
Ethiopia for foregoing the Blue Nile’s
development—another unlikely scenario because
Egypt considers that it already “ ow n s ” the wat e rs it
uses.
The major flaw in any market “solution”is the
failure to determine clearly who owns what.There
are groups of water experts and policy-makers in
Israel and Jo r d a n , for example, who would like to set
up a water trade in the regi o n . On the one hand, t h e
Israelis,who control the source of the vital Jordan
River,say that Palestinians should buy water from
t h e m .And on the other, Palestinians insist that the
Israelis stole the water from them and should now
pay for it.
L e t ’s imagine that two countries did manage to
c l a rify any ow n e rship disputes and began trading in
wat e r.W h at about third parties further dow n s t r e a m ?
Water isn’t like mineral resources. Russia can mine
coal and sell it around the world and neighbouri n g
c o u n t ries barely notice. But try selling part of a
ri ver from one region to the next without
downstream neighbours causing an uproar.
For years, the Turks have discussed a proposal
to sell water from the Euphrates to Israel. About 98
per cent of that river’s flow comes from rain and
s n ow on Tu r k e y, which has built one of A s i a ’s largest
dams to capture and control these wat e rs. H owe ve r ,
the Turkish gove rnment doesn’t have the money to
build all the infrastructure needed to use the wat e r
for ir rigation in Turkey. The Turks could sell the
water to Israel or various Arab nations by building
a pipeline across Syria to the Jordan Valley or the
Arabian peninsula. Perhaps a more realistic option
would be to pipe the water to Tu r k e y ’s
Mediterranean coast and then ship it by tanker.
Claims
and counterclaims
Such a deal would have serious repercussions for
Iraq and Syria, Turkey’s downstream neighbours,
who depend on the Euphrat e s. I m a gine that Tu r k e y
did use the dam’s reservoir for irri g at i o n .
D ownstream nations would still reap benefits
because much of the water used would still reach
t h e m . Run-off from irri g ated fields would feed back
into the river, and the water that evaporates in the
r e s e rvoir and the fields would eventually return
through the water cy c l e . But by shipping Euphrat e s
water outside the va l l e y, the Turks cut off these
b e n e fit s.The only option available to Iraq and Syri a
would be to buy the water to which they feel a
natural right. In my opinion, the solution to
water scarcity lies not in building water markets bu t
in consolidating the rules for sharing found in
customary international law.To better understand
the concept of customary law, consider an analogy.
Suppose there is a field between two villages.

right way between the villages even though no one
can say precisely when this notion took hold.At that
point, people consider those who take a different
p ath as trespassers.And so we find a legal norm and
not merely a factual description of a path.
To d ay there is a well developed body of
c u s t o m a ry intern ational law that gove rns the ri g h t s
of nations in intern ationally shared sources of fresh
wat e r.T h at body of law develops through a process
of claim and counterclaim, with the nations making
the claims appealing to legal rules to establish their
ri g h t s. All nations agree that only ri p a rian nat i o n s —
n ations across which, or along which, a ri ver flow s —
h ave any legal ri g h t ,a p a rt from an agr e e m e n t , to use
the water of a ri ve r. B e yond that ,h owe ve r , there are
t wo types of intern ational claim.The upper-ri p a ri a n
n ations initially base their claims on a b s o l u t e
t e rri t o rial sove r e i g n t y, typically claiming the right to
do whatever they choose with the water regardless
of its effect on other ri p a rian nat i o n s. D ow n s t r e a m
n at i o n s , on the other hand, generally make a claim
to the absolute integrity of the ri ve r, insisting that
upper-riparian nations can do nothing that affects
the quantity or quality of water flowing.
Equitable utilization
The usual solution to these contradictory claims
is found in a concept known as equitable utilizat i o n :
each ri p a rian nation recognizes the right of the
others to use water from a common source.At the
same time, there is an obligation to ensure that the
way in which one ri p a rian nation uses water does not
unreasonably interfere with similar uses of other
nations further downstream.Under this principle,
c o u n t ries usually decide on how much water is
a l l o c ated to one state or another by looking for
some more or less objective standard such as histori c
p at t e rns of use or the amount of land that could be
i rri g ated in each nat i o n .They also take into account
“ o b j e c t i ve ” fa c t o rs , like the need for more water for
growing populations.
C u s t o m a ry law does something that the market
c a n n o t : it recognizes the unique nature of wat e r. I n s t e a d
of trying to determine who “ ow n s ”w h at proportion of
a river, it lays down a set of rules for sharing.
Of cours e , there are at least two problems with this
kind of informal law.To begin with, the principle is too
vague to determine a nat i o n ’s “ fa i r ” s h a r e . S e c o n d ,
there is no neutral way of enforcing the ru l e s. So when
a violation occurs,the only recourse often available is
the law of the vendetta.
But these problems are just part of the nat u r a l
course of developing any form of customary law. At
some point, rules have to be set down on paper and
c o d i fie d .I n d e e d ,n ations have hammered out hundreds
of agreements in the attempt to define what constitutes
fair sharing of a particular wat e r way.The intern at i o n a l
community took a major leap forward about a ye a r
and a half ago by approving the United Nat i o n s
C o nvention on the Non-Nav i g ational Uses of
I n t e rn ational Wat e r c o u rses by a vote of 104 to three. I t
will unquestionably be the leading law gove rn i n g
i n t e rn ationally shared fresh wat e rs once it is rat i fied by
35 nations—a process that could take a decade or
more.The convention provides a set of standards in
codifying the rule of equitable utilization based on a long
list of dive rse fa c t o rs—from geographic and ecologi c a l
considerations to the economic value of existing and
potential uses of the wat e r way. The aim is to help
arbitrators and judges determine “equitable”sharing,
which should not be confused with equal shares.
The convention is a legal document, not a magic
f o rm u l a . Disputes will continue. But instead of resort i n g
to the law of the vendetta, nations can now seek legal
r e s o l u t i o n .The rule of equitable utilization can also serve
to channel the negotiations between ri p a rian neighbours
should they prefer to resolve the matter by treaty rat h e r
than by arbitration or litigation.
The convention reflects not only logi c, but need and
power—which amounts to a far more balanced and
s o p h i s t i c ated approach to managing water than simply
relying on a free market. n
Four international rivers
The Mekong
The river: From its source in the Himalayan peaks of Ti b e t , the Mekong flows for 4,200 km
through China’s Yunnan province (population 38 million) and through Myanmar, Laos,Thailand,
Cambodia and Viet Nam, countries populated by around 190 million people, many of them poor.
P roblems and pro s p e c t s : The river flows through an area which has been at war for much of
the century. Regional institutions including the Mekong River Commission (Cambodia, Vi e t
N a m , Laos and Thailand) are working to turn the Mekong into a “channel of commerce and
p r o s p e r i t y — A s i a ’s Danube”, by exploiting possibilities for mutual benefit and opening up a va s t
new market in this region where cross-border links are often rudimentary. Finance is proving to
be a major challenge, h o w e v e r. Some dam schemes to generate hydropower alarm
environmentalists who warn of problems ranging from the intrusion of salt water into the delta
to loss of rare species.China is building a dam in Yunnan from which electricity may be sent across
Laos to Th a i l a n d . It claims that the project will help river flow and benefit downstream nations,
but there are anxieties among low-lying countries because of the upstream dam’s capacity to
radically alter the river’s flo w, which would disrupt ecological balances.
Four international rivers
The Danube
The river: The Danube is Europe’s second largest river,
with a watershed area of 817,000 km3 in seventeen
c o u n t r i e s. The main channel of the river flows through
Germany, Austria,Slovakia, Croatia,Hungary, Yugoslavia,
Bulgaria,Romania.
P roblems and pro s p e c t s : Pollution by nitrogen and
phosphorus from agriculture, and toxic substances from
industries and cities. Hungary and Slovakia are still divided
by a long-running dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros
dam project that was referred to the International Court of
Justice in The Hague. In 1997 the court ruled that both
countries were at fault—Hungary when it cancelled work
on the project in 1989 and withdrew unilaterally from a
1977 bilateral agreement, S l o vakia by diverting the Danube
onto its territory without attempting to work out the
disagreement with Hungary.
