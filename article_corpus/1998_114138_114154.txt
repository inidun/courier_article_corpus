An unusual mix of groups and governments
braves a political minefield to curb the spread
of light weapons

From Yemen to Sri Lanka,the world is
awash in small arms and light we a p o n s
which are generally defined as those that
can be carried by an individual or fired by
a small crew. Small arms range from
revolvers to sub-machine guns while light
weapons include small mort a rs ,h a n d - h e l d
or mounted grenade launchers , p o rt a b l e
anti-aircraft guns and portable launchers
of anti-tank and aircraft missiles.

about three-quart e rs of a million we a p o n s ,
the bulk of which has gone to Kosovo,
according to Chris Smith, a light we a p o n s

treaties concerning nuclear, chemical and
conventional weapons,they have not even
a greed on intern ational standards for
classifying or regi s t e ring small arms and
light weapons, let alone a UN convention
c o n c e rning their transfer. And ye t , they are
the pri m a ry or sole tools of violence in
v i rtually all the armed conflicts curr e n t l y
dealt with by the United Nat i o n s ,
according to Jayantha Dhanapala, U N
Under Secretary General for
D i s a rm a m e n t . O ver 90 per cent of the
victims of small arms are civilians, w i t h
women and children accounting for 80 per
cent of casualties.
H owe ve r , the political tides may be
c h a n gi n g . An intern ational campaign is
n ow underway with non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGOs) of all stripes and
c o l o u rs — d i s a rmament and gun control
groups along with development and human
rights associations in the North and
S o u t h — building common ground with the
a c t i ve support of gove rnments like Mali,
C a n a d a , N o r way and Ja p a n . B u oyed by
success in banning landmines, they are
setting their sights on small arms and light
we a p o n s , despite the major differences
b e t ween them.The networks for producing
and procuring light weapons are far more
d i ve rse and widespread than that for
landmines. Small arms, unlike the mines,
are also culturally embedded in many
s o c i e t i e s. Uprooting the my riad of gun
cultures will take far more than a
c o nvention regulating their manufa c t u r e ,
use or export.
But before dismissing the campaign as
just another liberal wave of good intentions,
there seems to be growing interest on the
part of some major political powers which
just happen to be major arms suppliers.
While developing countries have borne the
b runt of the casualties, European and
N o rth A m e rican countries are now
increasingly concerned as these we a p o n s
fuel the fires of ethnic and intra-stat e
c o n flicts raging in their backya r d s ,
particularly in the Balkans.
“ We are suddenly finding the doors
widening from all kinds of governments,”
says Geraldine O’Callaghan of the British
A m e rican Security Inform ation Council
( B A S I C ) , an independent research
o r g a n i z at i o n . “The interest is also linked to
the fact that these weapons don’t have the
same dollar value as the big ticket items like
jets and tanks. Light weapons initiat i ve s
take attention away from the big weapons
i n d u s t ry.” O’Callaghan also points to the
links between guns, d rugs and organized
c ri m e , which rank high on domestic
a g e n d a s. By focusing on efforts to curb this
illicit trade, governments can score points
with voters.
E s t i m ates of the black market are
s k e t c hy at best. I n t e rn ational trade in small
arms reportedly runs at between three and
five billion dollars a ye a r. According to a
UN study, the black market amounts to
about 40 per cent of the legal trade,
although some experts maintain that it
could equal or surpass it.And even less is
known about the “grey market” of covert
sales between gove rnments and to non-
state actors.
The National Rifle Association’s
political clout
Despite the lack of data, the past year
has seen a wave of initiat i ves to curb the
illicit trade.The Organization of American
S t ates (OAS) brokered a conve n t i o n
outlining practical measures to notably
strengthen import / e x p o rt controls and
increase inform ation exchange betwe e n
s t at e s. In short , s t ates agreed that guns
would be marked with the time and place of
m a n u facture along with the name of the
i m p o rter should they cross a border.
Mexico turned the screws on the United
S t ates gove rn m e n t , for whom any t h i n g
resembling gun control is taboo given the
political weight of the National Rifle
A s s o c i ation (NRA), a UN accredited NGO
which ferociously defends the individual’s
right to bear we a p o n s. The Mexicans
maintained that it was impossible to stop
drugs streaming north so long as US guns
inundated states south of the border.
Looking to the OAS convention as a
m o d e l , the UN Economic and Social
Council is now working to incorp o r at e
similar measures in the form of a “ F i r e a rm s
P r o t o c o l ” which would fall within the
Tr a n s n ational Organized Cri m e
C o nve n t i o n . The proposed protocol wo n
the official support of the G-8 (Group of
Eight Industrialized States) during a
meeting in A p ril 1998. And just a month
l at e r , foreign ministers of the European
Union signed an ethical code of conduct
essentially calling on states to refrain from
t r a n s f e rring weapons to conflict zones or
states likely to use them to commit serious
human rights abu s e s.While a step forwa r d ,
there are serious loopholes, notably in the
lack of provisions for parliamentary or
public scrutiny over arms exports.
With the possible exception of the EU
c o d e , these initiat i ves represent a law
enforcement approach, the success of
which depends on gove rnments adopting
and enforcing strict legal controls on
weapons licenses. For some expert s , i t
marks an important shift away from the
traditional view in which guns are seen as a
commodity to be traded like any other
which exonerates the suppliers from
responsibility over their end use.
“The focus on the illicit trade is
basically an uncontroversial way of getting
into the debate surrounding light
we a p o n s ,” s ays Elizabeth Clegg of
S a f e r wo r l d , an NGO. “While states like the
United States have traditionally blocked
a ny moves to restrict the production and
sale of light weapons because there could
be domestic implications,they could have
little to say on attempts to curb illicit
transactions.
“ H owe ve r , this approach does not
address the problem of all the arm s
manufactured legally but which have gone
through several chains of supply and are
n ow in the grey and black market,” s ay s
Clegg.
“ I t ’s dangerous,” s ays Joost Hilterm a n n
of Human Rights Watch,an NGO. “It lets
g ove rnments off the hook by not holding
them responsible for cove rt trade in the
grey market. If gove rnments have an
interest in selling weapons, they will do so
legally when they can and illegally if they
‘Focusing on the illicit arms trade does not address 
the problem of arms manufactured legally which go
through several chains of supply before entering the black
or grey market’

m u s t .You cannot get rid of the illegal trade
without monitoring the legal trade.And to
do that, you need to focus on government
p o l i cy,” s ays Hilterm a n n , who points to
such classic tactics by which governments
sell to second parties which then transfer
the weapons to a third stat e , possibly in
d e fiance of a UN embargo, or to a non-
state actor.
Distinguishing between the legal and
illegal trade has proven to be a political
m i n e fie l d .A l a rms began ri n ging in  A u g u s t
when Canada’s Foreign Minister Lloy d
A x wo rt hy, a key player in the campaign
after his involvement in brokering the ban
on landmines, began asking foreign
m i n i s t e rs to consider a global convention to
prohibit the transfer of military -
s p e c i fic ation small arms and light we a p o n s
to non-state actors. According to a
discussion paper by the Canadian foreign
m i n i s t ry, “these non-state actors are
va riously term e d : t e rr o ri s t s , g a n g s t e rs ,
b a n d i t s , wa r l o r d s , hooligans and
n a r c o t r a f f i c k e rs.” While recognizing that
the proposed convention “ would deny arm s
to non-state actors opposing repressive
r e gi m e s ,” the ministry maintains “ t h at non-
violent means are the best way to effect
political change.”
Arms to defend
human rights
“This is a ve ry controve rsial issue,
especially in the South,” s ays A l e j a n d r o
Bendaña of the Center for Intern at i o n a l
Studies in Managua, N i c a r a g u a . “ T h i s
proposal would have banned gi v i n g
weapons to the A f rican National Congr e s s
d u ring apartheid or to any other liberat i o n
m ove m e n t .”
Mr A x wo rt hy seems to have taken a
step back from his proposal. D u ring a
September meeting at the UN on the subject,
he highlighted the links between the legal and
illegal trade in supporting the idea of a UN
conference on the subject, possibly in the ye a r
2000.
Confusion of the issues is expected given
the complicated nature of the subject and the
d i ve rsity of the actors invo l ve d . In pri vat e
c o nve rs at i o n s , l aw enforcement officials
express concern , for example, in dealings with
some disarmament and gun-control groups.
By openly calling for changes to domestic gun
laws, these groups may be offering the NRA
the political ammunition needed to drag the
US administration away from the negotiat i n g
t a b l e . As NRA spokesperson Tom Mason
e x p l a i n s , “ we are like an 800-pound gori l l a
sitting on the US administration.”
Other experts are concerned that in try i n g
to convince the public, p a rticularly in the
N o rt h , t h at disarmament is possible, t h e r e
will be a hasty rush to set up gun buy-back
projects and strat e gies concerning gun
t a g gi n g, for example, without the technical
e x p e rtise required. And gi ven the politics
i nvo l ve d , mistakes can prove costly—which
raises the question of the campaign’s fin a n c e s.
“The funds should not be diverted from
d e velopment bu d g e t s ,” s ays Bendaña, “ n o r
should they be diluted by going towa r d s
television commercials in the North and
professional lobbying. C o u n t ries just coming
out of conflicts need demilitarizing—not just
taking away mines but depolarizing divisions
within society. This is ve ry delicat e . . . . We
s h o u l d n ’t build up expectations about the
possible political success of this campaign.
C o nventions wo n ’t eliminate the demand for
guns or the roots of violence because the
economic violence will continue. . . . This is
just one step in a long process.” n
