CHRISTIANITY &
ANTI-SEMITISM
by Father Yves Congar
Bs author of The Catholic
Church and the Race Ques¬
tion, one of the booklets in
the Unesco serles, The Race
Question and Modern Thought,
permit me to comment on a number
of points in the racism issue of The
Unesco Courier.
In his most interesting article
"A Look at Modern Anti-Semitism,"
Léon Poliakov has, in effect, once
more taken up the thesis of P. Jules
Isaac, a man whose name I have
known since childhood, for it was
from his textbooks that I learned my
history. His thesis is that a re¬
lationship exists between modern
anti-Semitism and theological anti-
Semitism which "dates back to early
Christian times."
As a historian myself, convinced
that History is a great mistress of
truth, of human culture and of
objectivity, and hence of peaceful
understanding, I think there is an
undeniable element of truth in
this thesis. In this respect, I
would attach particular import¬
ance not so much to the
theological arguments of the Fathers
of the Church and leading theo¬
logians, but to certain popular
predications such as those delivered
on the occasion of the Crusades or
auto-da-fés. A work on the auto-
da-fés in Portugal at the end of the
15th century, which I recently
examined, comes to my mind. Such
predications helped to spread a
picture of "The Jew" on which the
irrational sentiments of the broad
masses thrived.

Yet even so, from 1938 to 1943 I
was mentally in agreement with
discriminatory measures like the
numerus clausus, as it was applied
in Hungary, whose unjust and
dangerous nature I failed to un¬
derstand at the time. I have since
realized that this was inadmissible.
From talks I had with fellow prisoners
of war who were Jewish, and after
the frightful events of Auschwitz
and Bergen-Belsen, I came to see,
after 1943, that any discrimination
whatever based on ethnic or racial
considerations opened the way to the
negation of justice and love, to the
denial of human fraternity and,
eventually, step by step to actions
of the worst kind.
Out the exact nature of our
relations with "others" de¬
pends above all on a critical
examination of such general
images through which it is so easy to
build up a grotesque and even vile
picture of certain groups of people,
especially if their life apart makes
them seem foreign or mysterious.
Anti-clericalism and criticism of
monks also thrived in this fashion.
In point of fact, even when one
has not been subjected to the in¬
fluence of such images there is always
a need to reinforce the truth of one's
beliefs. Here I might use my own
experience as an example. Thank
heaven I have never been an anti-
Semite and, as far as I know, have
never injured a Jewish person in any
way. As a child I had Jewish friends
who were the children of my parents'
friends. And a generation later I see
that my own nephews have as their
friend a child who escaped the
massacre, but whose parents my
own childhood comrades never re¬
turned from the death camps.
n should like now to make five
points concerning the thesis
of Léon Poliakov (and of
Jules Isaac).
*
1. It is easy to make a collection
of texts (and of facts) concerning
Christian anti-Semitism. But facts
and texts should be considered and
understood in their proper contexts.
Originally a polemical atmosphere
prevailed. The first persecutions of
the Christians sometimes stemmed
from Jewish denunciations, in a world
in which Judaism was still proselytic
and influential. In his Verus Israel
Marcel Simon has clearly demonstrat¬
ed the responsibilities on both sides
for this struggle between Jews and
Christians during the first four
centuries of the Christian era. The
"doctrinal anti - Semitism" of the
Fathers of the Church had as its
counterpart an anti-Christianity of
the Talmud.
2. This "doctrinal anti-Semitism"
is truly doctrinal and hence religious.
It is not racist. It may have had
practical consequences similar to
those produced by pagan anti-
Semitism. But in itself it is quite
different, it seems to me. And to
come to an objective conclusion
concerning the theological, religious
and non-racist character of Chris¬
tian anti-Semitism in past centuries,
I would recall the excellent Protestant
book, Antisémitisme et Mystères
d'Israël, written in 1955 by F. Lovsky,
which neither Léon Poliakov nor Ju¬
les Isaac have taken sufficiently into
account.
3. Léon Poliakov is too experienced
a historian to believe that there was
once a Jewish people ready to mingle
with the pagan peoples, and later
with Christian populations, and that
the tragedy of the situation which
led to the Ghettos can be laid en¬
tirely at the door of Christianity.
Besides the fact that pagan anti-
Semitism existed before any Christian
anti-Semitism, Israel was inclined by
its own Internal laws that ls, by its
most noble and profound traditions
to live apart. Its uncompromising
particularism could hardly help but
raise a kind of "Jewish question."
There has also been and still Ls a
Moslem anti-Semitism as well as a
Soviet anti-Semitism which have
no connexion whatever with the
doctrinal anti-Semitism of Christians.
What Dubnov has said in his
Histoire Juive on the situation of the
Jews in the Orient, shows that in
another way, but all the same in one
form or another, the Jewish people
are the subject of discrimination in
that part of the world.
4. The "doctrinal anti-Semitism"
of the Christians was not drawn up
specifically and exclusively for the
Jews. It rests on an ensemble of
theological theses which concern
"the Others," the non-Christians, the
"heterodox," those belonging to other
religious groups and even the pagans.
Christian thought of other centuries
had drawn up on this subject a
coherent and logical collection of
theological findings which amounted
to a kind of jurisprudence. These
arguments were drawn from an
entirely objectlvist realm of thought,
inspired by the conviction that Truth
exists and that it alone has proper,
defined rights.
Today we still believe In the rights
of Truth but have a different way
of meeting its demands.
llfJ e have nowadays reached
I 'I the point where we -can
^^^ I take Into consideration the
individual viewpoint or that
of conscience. But it should not be
forgotten that the ancient theology
often laid claim to texts of the Old
Testament. The very Idea of "divine
punishment", which has led Léon
Poliakov to detect an odour of
crypto-Chrlstlanlty In Le Dernier
des Justes, because the author,
J. Schwartz-Bart, had given space to
It, is not specifically Christian, but
Biblical.
What I have just said was even
more accentuated under a Christian¬
ity in which religion and politics
existed In tight association; in which
the Kingdom of God took on the
status of a form of government, in
which, unhappily, religious or
dogmatic reproval was translated
into social or judicial measures.
5. Finally, the thesis of Jules Lsaac
and Léon Poliakov runs the risk of
showing only the tragic and un¬
pleasant side of the co-existence
between Christians and Jews which
has so often been a sorrowful one
for the latter. There is, however, all
the positive side, often brought out

CHRISTIANITY & ANTI-SEMITISM (Cont'd)
In historical studies which- I could
quote. This is manifested in atti¬
tudes, often merciful and conciliatory,
made possible by a legal status, the
overall result of which was bé¬
néficient. Chrysostom, Augustine,
Gregory the Great, Bernard and the
Popes Pius XI and XII took up the
defence of the Jews. The texts and
the acts of these last two popes are
not sufficiently well known. In 1953
I Included a short list in my booklet
and one could draw up another from
one of Mr. Pollakov's own works,
Les Juifs et le IIP Reich. Exact
history should include all this in its
balance sheet of facts and in its
appreciation of realities.
This, of course, does not mean that
there ls nothing more to be done.
Unhappily there is much to do... But
Christians are ready to learn and are
willing and able to revise their ideas
and actions. We are in full agree¬
ment with Mr. Poliakov and with
Unesco to continue the effort which
is already well under way, but still
not equal to the need.
A FEW COMMENTS
by Léon Poliakov
It was with emotion that I read
the letter of Father Congar. I should
like to say at once that with the
exception of some slight shades of
meaning I agree with the first three
points of his letter. On the fourth
point I feel obliged to disagree.
1. The situation of the Jews, as
hétérodoxes or the others in the
mediaeval world, was very special and
infinitely vulnerable. It was consider¬
ed at that time that the Jews had
condemned themselves by their own
offence to perpetual punishment
and servitude (this offence was
firstly "deicide" and secondly "im¬
penitence," that ls, their refusal to
become Christians).
2. I agree with Father Congar
when he recalls that In all centuries
there have been Christians who have
defended the Jews (although among
the great names he quotes one could
make distinctions) and I would
add that during every age there
have been reassuring examples of
friendship and understanding
between Christians and Jews; and
even between theologians and rabbis.
Nor should we forget the great
Abelard, the only theologian of his
day who absolved the Jews of all
responsibility for the Crucifixion.
To recall such facts can only serve
the cause of Judaeo-Chrlstlan friend¬
ship ; it would be false and harmful to
pretend that Jewish history has been
nothing but a Vale of Tears. It is
Important to recognize that even at
a time when ideas were very different
from those we have today and when
laws Imposed a rigorous segregation
between the followers of the two re¬
ligions, understanding and mutual
esteem were fully possible. Such
contacts no doubt enabled each side
to perceive the elements that made
up (or were missing from) the
metaphysical nature of the other.
Thus life, in its manifold and
mysterious fullness, transcended the
doctrines and the laws.
