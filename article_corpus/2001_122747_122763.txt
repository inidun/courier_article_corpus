FOUNDER OF TOOLS FOR SELF-RELIANCE, HAMPSHIRE, UK (WWW.TFSR.ORG)



The mending hands
of youthful elders
In Great Britain, thousands of retired men gain a new lease on life
by refurbishing rusted tools and dispatching them to craftsmen
in Africa.A personal account of this ongoing adventure

W
e started Tools for Self-Reliance in
1979 with a handful of volunteers,
based on the simple idea of collecting
and sending refurbished tools to vil-
lage workshops in A f r i c a .My interest
in tools grew alongside a rising disenchantment with big
technical projects overseas. I ’d seen foreign compa-
nies in West Africa make huge profits in the name of
d e v e l o p m e n t . Expatriate staff who were supposed to
make a difference enjoyed huge salaries, servants and
extravagant perks, all adding to Third World debt.
Much of this assistance seemed to inhibit the ordinary
working people from taking initiatives to better their
l i v e s.
In Ethiopia,I ’d observed costly Caterpillar diggers
brought in by aid agencies rusting away, because it was
impossible to find diesel or spare parts for them.
M e a n w h i l e, thousands of Ethiopians went unem-
ployed and hungry. Surely there was a way to do
things differently.

Then,one day, hearing an aid worker in Uganda
complain that young people were stealing the tools
from his visual aid display, it struck me that tools
could empower these poor people and give them a
l i v e l i h o o d . Visits to local craftsmen showed their
equipment was almost worn out, chisels sharpened
t o the last centimetre, hammers mere stumps of iron.
I was sure there was scope for an organization which
could assist them while avoiding traditional
debt traps.
The first steps
Back home, the idea crystallized further. M y
mother pointed out that in our street alone, t h e r e
lived dozens of people with tools from a lifetime
stacked in their sheds.What did this mean, in terms of
the unused hammers, s a w s, and sewing machines that
could be collected all over Britain? 
We got to work with a bunch of dedicated student
volunteers from the Polytechnic in 1979, using an
abandoned church hall in Portsmouth as our first tool
shed. There was no heating, no water, no gas, no fur-
n i t u r e, but we were jubilant. We had found some-
where to clean the first batch of 240 tools collected
from houses in the Kingston prison area.
To d a y, tools worth more than £500,000 ($800,000)
each year are shipped to partner organizations in
Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Mozambique, Sierra
Leone and Ghana.Working closely with these groups,
TFSR is able to deliver targeted aid to groups of
craftsmen in poor communities. We also promote
local tool production by supporting blacksmith
training programmes in Ta n z a n i a , Z i m b a b w e, a n d
Sierra Leone. Rural blacksmiths use our heavy-duty
equipment to make and mend tools locally,p r o d u c i n g
far more than we could ever ship out.
Without its large core of dedicated volunteers,
TSFR would not exist. When we started out,we had
never considered what secondary benefits this scheme
might bring,especially for retired men, who are often
reluctant to get out and socialize—often to the despair
of their wives. Thousands of them have got a new
lease on life by volunteering with us—today, o l d e r
men make up about half the membership of our 70
groups. Once a week,up and down the country, they
get together to de-rust, m e n d ,s h a r p e n , oil and fin a l l y
pack the tools, as good as new (and sometimes better
because steel in old tools is often of superb quality) for
dispatch to Africa.

in Tanzania
Some of these volunteers once earned their living
as mechanics, engineers or builders, and they take
great pride in teaching their skills to younger members.
“What they have in common,” says Tony Care, coor-
dinator of T S F R , Wa l e s, “is their high standard of
w o r k m a n s h i p. They are methodical and thorough.
They enjoy taking on a complicated job and refuse to
be beaten by it.They’re a mine of useful information
and a constant source of funny stories from the past.”
It can be a time for
nostalgia too. N o w
and then, a volunteer
will pick up a rusting
instrument and
e x c l a i m , “I haven’t
seen one of these
since World War II!”
H o w e v e r, i t ’s not
just the practical
aspect of the job that
attracts our volun-
t e e r s. Most come
because they appre-
ciate the underlying
spirit of the organi-
z a t i o n , and sharing
experiences with
o t h e r s. “TSFR is
infinitely worth-
w h i l e,”declares Jo h n
Watley, our 84 year-
old sewing-machine
guru who was once
the town clerk in
A n d o v e r, H a m p-
s h i r e. “ I t ’s the most
original and in the
best sense, ’r e v o-
lutionary’ relief
workI’ve ever come
a c r o s s.” In Don-
c a s t e r,Derek Ta y l o r,
72,shares his reason
for volunteering.
“Our son was killed
in a road accident,” he explains.“My wife and I started
to think of our own lives. Before, our family was the
only thing that mattered. N o w, we are outward-
l o o k i n g ;everyone is our family.Some of our v o l u n t e e r s
illustrate how it’s never too late to make a difference.
Kevin Petrie, 8 5 , spent his working life as a book-
keeper and teacher, and only started collecting and
refurbishing tools at 70. Over the last 15 years, he has
refurbished 11,500 beautiful tools, mainly for car-
pentry. A member of the TSFR board of trustees, he
visited Ta n z a n i a , at his own expense, to see the equip-
ment in use.The country’s former president, Julius K.
Nyerere, who was a TSFR patron,invited him home
to discuss the role of tools and artisans in development.
Later, as Kevin travelled around villages to broaden
his education,his enthusiasm was so evident that he
was christened Mzee kijana, or youthful elder.
When I asked Ke v i n ’s wife, R u t h , how she felt
about the thousands of hours he had spent closeted in
the garage, she smiled.“ H e ’s been happy doing those
t o o l s,” she mused.“I see it as our small contribution to
help the world along.” ■
