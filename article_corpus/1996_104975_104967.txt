The African landscape reveals
itself in all its splendour from
the air. As you fly over Tai" National
Park in southwest Côte d'Ivoire, near
the border with Liberia, a palette of
many shades of green stretches
beneath you, mingling with blueish
vapour trails. From the summit of
Mount Niénokoué (396 metres), in
the south of the Park, there is an
equally stunning view of the sombre
beauty of the virgin forest and its
wheeling flocks of birds.
A more down-to-earth look at the
Park tells us that it was given national
park status by government decree on
28 August 1972 in an area which had
been a "forest and wildlife refuge"
originally created by the French
administration in 1926. In 1978 the
Park was accepted as a biosphere
reserve and in 1982 it became a
World Heritage site.
Straddling the borders of the
departments of Guiglo and Sassan-
dra, the Park comprises some
454,000 hectares of dense evergreen
rain forest, to which 96,000
hectares of the N'zo Animal Reserve
were added in 1993. It is in a sloping
granitic area which flattens out near
the coast where the granite gives
way to schist. The soil in the north is
fragile although protected from ero¬
sion by dense vegetation. Further
south the soil is far more fertile, ben-
efiting from the influence of the
Hana and Meno rivers as well as
heavy rainfall (more than 1900 mil¬
limetres annually). It is around these
rivers that the 230 bird species, and
47 of the 54 species of large mam¬
mals known to occur in Guiñean rain
forest are most in evidence, as well as
primates, ungulates and carnivores.

(there were 1,800 in 1979), makes a
big contribution to the perpetuation
of the ecosystem, as secondary forest
grows largely from the dung it leaves
in clearings and fallow areas. Seeds

regions. Cape buffaloes (Syncerus
caffer) Uve in couples or in herds of up
to ten. They live in marshland around
the liana and the Meno in the south of
the Park and also along long-estab¬
lished trails that run through the sec¬
ondary forest. But they have a strong
preference for dense undergrowth.
Pygmy hippopotamus (Choerop-
sis liberiensis), once found in Nigeria
and today occasionally spotted in
Sierra Leone, can also be seen in the
Park. They live in couples and much
prefer conditions on land, where
they find food and refuge in case of
danger, to an aquatic environment.
They venture into open country, usu¬
ally at dusk. Researchers at a sci¬
entific station near the village of Tai
have come across them disporting
themselves on Mount Niénokoué.
Scientists are particularly inter¬
ested in the population of chim¬
panzees (Pan troglogytes verus) of
I which there are from 2,000 to
| 3,000 specimens in the Park. The
¡ chimps use tools to crack nuts, orga-
I nize hunting and food sharing and
| practise division of labour accord
ing to sex. They are elusive crea¬
tures, however, since the presence
of humans disturbs them and their
sexual cycle. Their reproduction
rate gives little grounds to predict a
population explosion.
Tai National Park is home to 230
bird species, 28 of which are
endemic to the Guiñean zone. Eight
of them are threatened, including
the white-breasted guinea fowl (Age¬
lastes meleagridis).
Of the 1,300 higher plant
species identified in Southwest
Africa, at least 870 are found in the
Park: 80 per cent of them are
endemic to the Guinea-Congo sec¬
tor and 10 per cent to the south¬
western part of Côte d'Ivoire. The
northern part of the humid primary
forest consists largely of climbing
palms with spiny blistered leaves
(Eremospatha macrocarpa), and of
Diospyros mannii, small trees
belonging to the family that includes
ebony and niangons (Tarietia utilis).

through the Park visitors can see

trees whose trunks soar towards the
light like a simplified human form
joyfully thrusting out a multitude
of arms. There is a greater variety
of endemic plants in the south of
the Park because of its more fertile
soil and heavier rainfall. One of the
region's rarities is also found there,
Armorphophallus staudtii, a species
that was thought to have disap¬
peared until it was rediscovered in
1977.
Ant-hills built on dead tree
trunks are found on the edge of the
trails which wind around the virgin
forest in the south and lead to the
Park's ecological station.
A BARRIER AGAINST CLIMATIC
DETERIORATION
Tai National Park faces a number
of threats . In addition to those orig¬
inating in the usual economic activ¬
ities found in forests, the arrival
since 1989 of hundreds of thousands
of Liberian refugees fleeing civil war
in their country has considerably
increased demographic pressure on
the environment. Cropland (coffee,
cacao, palms, hevea) may expand
and make inroads on the reserve's
peripheral areas. Poaching and
unsupervised panning for gold must
also be reckoned with, although
development programmes set up in
recent years (especially under the
auspices of the Dutch Tropenbos
Foundation, UNESCO's Man and the

Pygmy
hippopotamuses
[Choeropsis
liberiensis).
Biosphere Programme, and German
technical co-operation schemes) have
closely involved people living in the
Tai' forest.
Since 1988, a Park Development
Unit, known since 1993 as the
Autonomous Project for the conser¬
vation of the Park, has been respon
sible for drawing up and imple¬
menting an agreed management pol¬
icy. Many village committees, co¬
operative groups and local non¬
governmental organizations have
been set up and are trying to make
young people and women more aware
of conservation problems. Themain
purpose of this educational project
is to draw attention to the impor¬
tance of the forest as a means of pro¬
tection against the deterioration of
climatic conditions.
