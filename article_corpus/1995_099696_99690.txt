GREENWATCH
CLEAN DRIVING:
A GREEN DREAM?
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
It is all too easy for a motorist
enjoying a smooth drive along a
good road to forget that the road
and the vehicles that use it are far
from harmless to the environment.
In November 1989 the Council of
Ministers of the European Confer¬
ence of Ministers of Transport
(ECMT) adopted a Resolution
incorporating a wide range of rec¬
ommendations designed to curb
the impact of transport on the envi¬
ronment. The recommendations
are exacting and constitute a major
challenge for the nineties. -
Transportation unquestionably
contributes to the greenhouse effect
by producing carbon dioxide
(CO2)675 million tons in 1990 in
the member countries of the Orga¬
nization for Economic Co-opera¬
tion and Development (OECD)
methane (CH4), ozone precursors
such as hydrocarbons (HCs) and
nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as chlo-
rofluorocarbons (CFCs), tropos-
pheric ozone (03, from 0 to 15 km
above the earth) and water vapour.
These gases are emitted from fossil
fuel combustion within the manu¬
facture, operation and disposal of
transport systems and from the pro¬
duction and processing of fossil
fuels. Vehicles, especially private
cars, contribute 25% of the overall
CO2 emissions in most western
European countries.
Greenhouse gas emissions are
not the only forms of air pollution
caused by road transport. Diesel
engines (mainly lorries) emit oxides
of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur dioxide
(SO2) and microscopic particles
(especially of carbon) that cause
visible exhaust fumes and soil build¬
ings. Sulphur dioxide and nitric
oxide react in the atmosphere with
water to form sulphuric acid and
nitric acid, which can turn soil and
lakes acidic and eat away at building
stone. They may travel long dis¬
tances in the atmosphere. Gases
emitted by one country often cause
acid damage in another.
THE CARLESS MAJORITY
Motor vehicle production has expe¬
rienced spectacular growth since
the end of the Second World War,
rising from about 10 million vehicles
per year in 1950 to 50 million in
1990. Today there are more than 675
million vehicles worldwide
(including two-wheelers). Outside
the OECD countries, however, most
of the world's inhabitants do not
use motor transport. The countries
ofAfrica, Asia (excluding Japan) and
Latin America contain more than
four-fifths of the world's popula¬
tion, but only one-fifth of motor-
vehicle registrations. However, the
number of vehicles per head has
grown by 20% worldwide over the
past ten years.
As Laurie Michaelis of the Inter¬
national EnergyAgency (IEA) noted
in a report presented at a seminar
on Transport Policy and Global

Heading into Death
Valley, California
(U.S.A.).
Warming organized by ECMT in
1992, "It would be technically pos¬
sible, by reducing car size and per¬
formance, to reduce the energy con¬
sumption, and hence greenhouse
gas emissions, of petrol cars by a
factor of three. However the
resultingvehicles would not achieve
much market share under current
market conditions. Without com¬
promising marketable vehicle char¬
acteristics, vehicle energy efficiency
is unlikely to improve by much
more than 10% before 2005." In fact
the commercial success of a car,
based on power, speed, size, secu¬
rity and comfort, is usually at odds
with the goals of reducing energy
consumption.
In his report Laurie Michaelis
makes a comparative analysis of the
advantages and disadvantages of
the different kinds of fuel and the
environmental effects of their pro¬
duction and consumption. Diesel
emits 15% more CO2 than petrol.
Although the image of diesel-pow-
ered vehicles as dirty, noisy and
heavy is fading, their number is
restricted because they cost more to
buy. Liquid petroleum gases (LPG)
include propane and butane. Vehi¬
cles that run on LPG have a green¬
house gas emission rate 20% less
than that of petrol vehicles. The
major drawback ofLPG is that sup¬
plies are limited, since it constitutes
only about 5% of refinery output.
Compressed natural-gas engines
emit little CO2 but a lot ofmethane,
which makes them less enticing.
But the main unknown is how this
innovative fuel will be received by
the consumer. As far as alcohol fuels
are concerned, methanol and
ethanol are expensive to produce.
They are less energy-rich, and so
vehicles have to be fitted with larger
fuel tanks, or vehicle range is
reduced. They are also corrosive,
and if they were adopted as fuels,
some materials currently used in
engines would have to be replaced.
Hydrogen seems to be the ideal fuel,
since its combustion in air produces
water and certain nitrogen com¬
pounds. If it is obtained by elec¬
trolysis, however, with the current
average electricity generation mix in
OECD European countries, the
plants generating the necessary
electric power for this operation
produce twice as much carbon
dioxide per unit of energy as the
emission level from petrol. The
same problem arises with electric
cars. Although some car makers
believe that electric cars will
become increasingly popular, their
speed, limited to 100 km/h, their
autonomy, no more than about 100
km, and their relatively high price
are a handicap except when an anti¬
pollution law is enacted, as may
happen in Los Angeles, California
(U.S.A.). And of course, the elec¬
tricity that powers them must come
from renewable energy sources!
On the other hand the electric
car is the only one that is completely
silent. As we saw in the lune 1994
Greenwatch ("Defeating Decibels"),
noise is one of the great scourges
ofthe modern world, and automo¬
bile traffic is one of the major con¬
tributors to it. The noise heard by
people living near roads comes
from the engines, transmissions,
tyres, horns and the road surface.
Public-works contractors are trying
to improve the latter. A French com¬
pany has developed a system that
makes it possible to reduce traffic
noise by 3 to 5 decibels; this may
not sound like much, but it is actu¬
ally a breakthrough. Gravel is coated
in asphalt in such a way as to reduce
density. The result not only leads to
less noise but also enables rain to
drain away more quickly, making
the road less slippery.
OTHER KINDS OF POLLUTION
Indispensable though they are,
roads are the cause ofseveral kinds
of pollution. They contaminate
water by soil erosion, which may
generate between 1,000 and 10,000
tons of suspended matter per kilo¬
metre both during construction and
resurfacing. Chronic pollution is
caused by wear and tear on sur¬
facing, tyres, corrosion of protec¬
tion guards, road signs and rein-

forced concrete, not to mention
leaded fuel that spews heavy metals
into the air that are then ingested by
plants and mushrooms growing
nearby. In winter, to treat icy roads,
especially in the mountains, 20 to 30
grams of salts are spread per square
metre (sodium-, calcium- or mag¬
nesium-chloride) that are harmful
to rivers. Worst of all perhaps are
the dangerous products that are
spilled on the roads in accidents
involving tankers carrying hydro¬
carbons or other chemical products
that then filter into the earth and
pollute the groundwater.
As Jean-Pierre Orfeuil of the
French National Institute for
Research into Transport and Trans¬
port Safety (INRETS) writes, "The
shift of goods traffic away from the
railways has created an all-powerful
road-transport lobbywhich exploits
the intensified competition and its
corporate power to impose its views
on society." This shift is shown by
the statistics. From 1984 to 1989
road haulage traffic increased by
84% in the European Economic
Community, compared with only
13% for rail freight. "Because trans¬
port in developed countries helps
push up oil consumption," Jean-
Pierre Orfeuil notes, "there is per¬
sisting pressure on prices, and the
. Third World is deprived of the devel¬
opment opportunities flowing from
low-cost energy opportunities
which the developed world enjoyed
during the post-war years." More¬
over, the Third World is bogged
down in economic crisis and has a
hard time maintaining its roads and
motor vehicles, which are often in
poor shape and therefore even
worse polluters.
Although scientists sometimes
contest doomsday predictions of
global warming and its correlation
with the increased presence of
carbon dioxide, a sane precau¬
tionary principle would be to reduce
all. pollutants emitted by motor
vehicles in order to safeguard our
environment now and for genera¬
tions to come. A set of measures
currentlybeing studied provides for
an increase in fuel consumption
taxes, stricter enforcement of speed
limits, a reduction in the cost of rail
and public transport, the promo¬
tion of road-rail goods transport,
the reduction of traffic in towns and
cities and the development of cycle¬
ways. However, the users need to
be won over, and this is no mean
task. "Those without access to a car
(the young and some of the very
elderly)," writes Jean-Pierre Orfeuil,
"feel themselves outsiders in an
automobile-dependent society." We
cannot yet know whether informa¬
tion campaigns, however persua¬
sive, will convince people that
raising taxes and reducing speed
will guarantee cleaner air for
everyone.
