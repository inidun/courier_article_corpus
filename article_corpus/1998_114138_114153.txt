I m m i gr ation is increasingly seen in terms of threat s.
The prevalent image of this threat in the deve l o p e d
c o u n t ries of the North is one of mass invasion by
hundreds of millions of poor from around the wo r l d .T h e
overarching response in these countries is to militari z e
their borders and to maximize policing inside them.
I m m i gr ation thus becomes suffused in a mentality of
n ational cri s i s , and unilateral sovereign action emerges as
the only effective response.
This is of course not the first time in the history of
the twentieth century that immigr ation has been
p o rt r ayed as threatening and that there has been a
clamour for strong unilateral state action. But today
the context has radically changed. S t ates have been
forced by major economic trends to approach more
and more matters multilaterally. Unilateral strongman
tactics in military operations are less acceptable in
i n t e rn ational fora and are generally seen as less effective
than multilateral approaches. For the first time
i n n ovations in intern ational law have subjected nat i o n a l
states to supranational authorities.
The context is also radically different when it comes
to the use of policing as a key approach to more effective
immigrant regulation. Today far more civil rights
instruments are available to judges and there is a
gr owing trend towards the constitutionalizing of civil
rights in both the United States and in Europe.T h e r e
are also far more human rights instruments ava i l a b l e
to judges and they are much more likely to be used
than was the case even ten ye a rs ago.
Fi n a l l y,there is a sharpening sense of the concept
of civil society. S t r at e gic sectors of the citizenry,
especially in the United Stat e s , h ave asserted their
right to criticize and even take to court va ri o u s
g ove rnment agencies, most particularly police
a g e n c i e s.These conditions contrast sharply with the
call for stronger police action vis à vis immigr a n t s.
When the object of stronger police action is a broad
s p e c t rum of people—immigrant wo m e n , men and
children—sooner or later it will get caught in the
expanding web of civil and human ri g h t s , it will violat e
those ri g hts and interfere with the functioning of civil
s o c i e t y.
In the United Stat e s , for example, t h e

If my son decided to go write the gr e at A m e ri c a n

could well be one of the suspects, because I know
he would not be carrying his US passport with him.
M a ny of these INS actions can escape accountability
in front of a judge if the persecuted are merely
suspected of being undocumented. Sooner or lat e r
stronger policing and the weakening of judicial
review of such police actions will interfere with the
a s p i r ation towards the rule of law that is such a deep

Defending
the rule of law
Acting on immigr ation as if it were a national cri s i s
is today both unsustainable and undesirable for stat e s
under the rule of law. P r e c a rious and partial as the
concept of the rule of law may be, and imperfect as its
i m p l e m e n t ation is, it is nonetheless an impressive tool
in the struggle for a better and more democrat i c
s o c i e t y. A s p i r ation to it strongly conditions political
and civic order in the highly developed countri e s.T h e
rule of law in good part means the right of citizens to
be free from abuses by the state and is not enhanced

by the expanded use of policing as an instrument to
maintain control over immigr at i o n .
Since it is likely that cross-border migr ation will
continue as the world becomes increasingly
g l o b a l i z e d , it is urgent that we rethink and innovat e
on the policy front.As we develop the cross-border
integration of markets for goods and services, for
capital, for information, and for communications,
I would argue that the flow of people will continue
a p a c e .This will be especially the case among the top
l e vel professionals whose mobility is an essential
part of the integration of markets,and among low-
wage wo r k e rs for whom cross-border mobility is
often the only option.
The powerful actors in the new economic order,
such as global corp o r ations and global markets
often more powerful than many a government,are
already hard at work setting up, albeit a mostly
p ri vat e , system of rule that protects the rights of
these actors no matter what country they choose for
their operat i o n s. And stat e s , m a ny enorm o u s l y
r e l u c t a n t ,h ave joined in the multiplying multilat e r a l
e f f o rts that the new economic order demands. M o r e
and more of them have relinquished capacities and
c o m p e t e n c e s , and even bits and pieces of their
s ove r e i g n t y, in the name of a more effective
m u l t i l ateral economic order.They have done so not
only de fa c t o, in some low - l e ve l ,c l o s e - t o - t h e - gr o u n d
o p e r ational sense, but also de jure through the
f o rm a li z ation of these changes in national and
international law.Yet in the realm of immigration
p o l i cy we see the continuat i o n , and eve n
s t r e n g t h e n i n g, of unilateral state action, t h e
i nvo c ation of absolute and undiminished stat e
sovereignty.
This raises several questions concerning the
v i a b i l i t y, e f f e c t i veness and desirability of such a
f r a m e work for policy. Can such an immigr at i o n
r e gime be viable when most other cross-border
flows are increasingly centred in multilat e r a l i s m
and diminished state sovereignty? Even if it is viable
is it the most effective way of proceeding? Similarly
with the expansion of a policing approach. Is it
viable or effective in the context of a strengthening
civil society and human rights? When it comes to
d e s i r a b i l i t y, the issues around immigr ation are
probably more ambiguous than in the case of trade
and capital flow s , and become entangled in a va ri e t y
of well-founded rationales along with ill-guided
political passions.
I believe that multilateralism is a better way to
proceed in a broad range of mat t e rs , i n c l u d i n g
i m m i gr at i o n , because it is essential to creat e — a n d
i nvent—policies that have receiving and sending
c o u n t ries working together. I also consider the
expansion of policing undesirable and not the way for
enlightened societies to proceed.W h at e ver the control
a c h i e ve d , the trade-offs are too costly both for the
i m m i grants themselves but also especially for the
receiving societies in terms of violations of civil and
human rights and the threats to the fa b ric of civil
s o c i e t y.

R e g u l ation is necessary but achieving it does
not necessitate militarizing borders and maximizing
i n t e rnal policing.W hy? Because of a combination of
three fa c t o rs. F i rs t , far from being a mass inva s i o n ,
im m i gr ation is pat t e rned and bounded in time and
s p a c e . S e c o n d , n ational states are acquiring gr e at e r
competence in multilateral management because of
economic globalization and hence may be more
competent to develop multilateral co-operat i o n
mechanisms with sending countri e s. T h i r d , a g a i n
because of economic globalization national states have
had to learn to accommodate a gr owing number of
conditions and norms coming from intern ational fora.
This combination of fa c t o rs signals the possibility of
new approaches to regulating immigr at i o n .
The key to a more enlightened and less crisis-
o riented approach is the fact that migr ations are
p at t e rn e d . The evidence about intern at i o n a l
m i gr ations in the United Stat e s , in We s t e rn Europe
and in Japan shows that intern ational migr at i o n s
are patterned,bounded in scale and duration,and
conditioned by other processes.They are not simply
an indiscri m i n ate flow from pove rty to prosperity as
is suggested by the imagery of “mass invasions”.If
poverty were enough to produce emigration,then
the developed countries would indeed be
threatened with massive invasions. But it is only a
very tiny fraction of all the poor who emigrate and
they do so from ve ry specific areas and towa r d s
equally specific destinations.
F u rt h e rm o r e ,most migr ations end.They do not
go on for centuri e s. Fifty ye a rs seems to be a fa i r l y
l e n g t hy duration for most cross-border migr ations in
the United States and We s t e rn Europe—that is to
s ay, s p e c i fic migr ation processes of a gi ven nat i o n a l i t y
group to a particular locat i o n .I n d e e d ,t wenty ye a rs
is probably more common in Europe. One of the
reasons for this is that such migr ations tend to be
embedded in the cycles and phases of the receiving
a r e a s.D r a m atic examples of this include the migr at i o n s
of hundreds of thousands of Italian and Spanish wo r k e rs
to nort h e rn Europe that were in full swing in the 1960s
and basically ended in the 1970s.To d ay, when Italians
and Spaniards are free to move within Europe, there is
almost no new migr at i o n . T h at particular phase of
labour migr at i o n , embedded as it was in the post-wa r
r e c o n s t ruction of Europe and then in the expansion of
the 1960s, came to an end when these conditions no
longer held, and Spain and Italy became prosperous.
If intern ational migr ations are conditioned,p at t e rn e d
and bounded processes, the policy response need not be
c o n fined to maximizing border control. We can move
away from a mentality of national crisis to one of
m a n a g e m e n t .This may be a good time for such a change.
There is some consensus about the existence of a
widening gap between immigr ation policy intent and
i m m i gr ation reality in the major developed receiving
c o u n t ri e s.An important nine-country study published in
1 9 9 41 found that the gap between the goals of nat i o n a l
i m m i gr ation policy (law s ,r e g u l at i o n s ,e xe c u t i ve actions,
e t c.) and the actual results is wide and gr owing wider in
all major industrialized countri e s. It also found that
i m m i gr ation officials in all nine countries were less
c o n fident about the effectiveness of policy than their
p r e d e c e s s o rs fifteen ye a rs before.

m at t e r. C e rtainly the implementation of a new
economic order required an enormous amount of
problem solving and innovat i o n . It is not evident to me
t h at the last round of negotiations on the General
A greement on Ta riffs and Trade (GAT T ) , the so-called
U ru g u ay Round, was any less complex than
i m m i gr ation regulat i o n . It took ye a rs of wo r k , but it got
d o n e . I am convinced that we need a radical rethinking
of key aspects of the regulation of immigr ation and an
e n o rmous amount of innovation if we are to have a
more effective and enlightened set of immigr at i o n
p o l i c i e s. Some of this work is under way in the
European Union,which has seen considerable and at
times radical innovations in the last ten years on the
subject of immigration.
F i n a l l y, there is now a so-called “ c o n c e rt e d
c o n s e n s u s ” among a gr owing number of nat i o n a l
s t ates around the shared objective of furt h e ri n g
economic globalization and the major policy
o ri e n t ations that come with it—deregulat i o n ,
p ri vat i z at i o n , a n t i - i n flation policies, and foreign-
exchange parity with the leading curr e n c i e s.These are
all fundamental conditions for the implementation of
global capital markets. Along with the World Tr a d e
O r g a n i z ation and the environmental agenda, they have
forced states to develop new competences to act
m u l t i l at e r a l l y. They may suggest that national stat e s
can be led—or forced—to adopt a more international
u n d e rstanding of subjects such as immigr ation that
used to be regarded in purely domestic terms. n
