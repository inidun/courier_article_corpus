FEW months ago work-
/A men were putting the
finishing touches to a
group of buildings in
the Auer-wellsbach Park at
Vienna. The buildings, whose
modern functional design
made a striking contrast with
the ornate splendour of the
Palace of Schoenbrunn just
across the park, were intended
to house a new kindergarten
for children aged between
3 and 7 years.
But not all the children who
have been attending the
"Sonder Kindergarten"in
Auer-wellsbach Park since it
was completed and opened last
September, are the happy,
active youngsters normally
found in kindergartens.
To this modern centre each
day come children who wear
a brace on their leg, others
who cannot see the sun shin-
ing through trees, or who
cannot hear the birds singing,
and still others whose minds
are confused, who may sud-
denly burst into tears without
cause.
For the Sonder Kindergarten
is one of the most modern of
European institutions both
for the education and re-
education of young children.
The Sonder Kindergarten in Vienna is one of the most up-to-date chil-
dren's rehabilitation centres in Europe. For physio-therapy a special
bath (shown above) has been installed. Its glass side and interior
lighting allow the therapist to observe and direct the exercises which
assist disabled children to regain the use of their limbs.
Planned and built by the
Social Assistance Department
of the City of Vienna, with
financial help from the Swiss
Red Cross, it possesses an up-
to-date centre for study and
demonstration. Here educa-
tors, psychologists and other
specialists can draw on the
results of observation and
practical research to devise
new methods for the re-educa-
tion of handicapped children.
From the Research Institute
a corridor leads to a row of
six pavilions, each of which
constitutes a specialized unit
designed for a selected group
of children. One is devoted
to the study of normal chil-
dren ; the others specialize in
disabled, backward, deaf and
dumb, blind and"emotionally
disturbed"children.
Normal Children
as"Yardstick"
IN each of these pavilionsthe furnishings are simple
though perfectly adapted to
the needs of the 16 children
and members of the staff.
Each unit has a large light
airy room, whose high wide
windows look out into the
park. This room serves in
turn as dining room, playroom,
school room and, at the time
of the afternoon nap, as a
bedroom.
have been installed, made of
special glass through which
experts can observe without
being seen, so that the chil-
dren are not disturbed, or
conscious of being watched.
The inclusion of a group of
"normal"children enables the
specialists to maintain contact
with"normality"in their
work and at the same time
serves as a"yardstick"of
redactions and behaviour
against which those of the
handicapped children can be
measured.
Modern equipment, and the
re-education methods em-
ployed, have made the institu-
tion one of the most interest-
ing achievements of its kind
in Europe. In the pavilion for
maimed children, for example,
the successive stages of phy-
sio-therapy can be controlled
and observed in various ways.
The handicap of moving the
weight of limbs and bodies is
partly overcome through teach-
ing children to exercise in
water. A special bath with a
glass panel and interior light-
ing allows the therapist to
observe and teach exercises to
the child in the bath.
The children are taught and
cared for in an atmosphere
of happiness and kindness,
and each pavilion has its own
small playground complete
with sandpit.
It might seem ironic to des-
cribe these children as"the
lucky ones", but they are for-
tunate compared with the
many thousands of handicap-
ped children in the world who
get no help to overcome their
disabilities. Vienna's"Sonder
Kindergarten"should be an
example and encouragement to
educators in other countries
to help give all afflicted chil-
dren the chance of a normal
happy life.
