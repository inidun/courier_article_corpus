the future
The “third industrial
revolution” is radically
changing the societies in which we
live. The signs of this are the spread
of the revolution in information
technology, the rapid development of
communication and information
sciences and technologies, and the
progress made in biology and
genetics and their applications. New

growth of this new scientific and

beginning to be seen.

ensure that globalization becomes a
powerful force for emancipation and
international solidarity, instead of one
that generates exclusion and inward-
looking attitudes?
It is true that globalization offers
the potential benefit of improved
means of information and
communication, as well as the
transport of this information. The
new information and communication
technologies provide fresh
opportunities in the area of distance
learning; they hint at the promise of a
society of networks – one which is
decentralized, more democratic and
less hierarchical. Globalization could
contribute not just to the
fragmentation of societies but also to
the spread of an international
consciousness. This is perhaps how
we should see the ill-named anti-
globalisation protest movement that
sociologist Edgar Morin calls a
second globalisation: one of
awareness, alongside economic and
technical globalisation.

codes today, followed by genetic
codes tomorrow – the third industrial
revolution is subjecting the material
production society to a new –
immaterial – force, which is based on
the signs of the “programmed
society.” The advent of this society is
being precipitated by the rapid
growth of world networks, both
public and private, which are the
main instruments of globalization,
the pace of which they help to
accelerate. The effects of this
revolution – which subjects societies
to a fractal logic – have now
penetrated the very fabric of our
society. What effect will this trend

2 Are poverty
and exclusion
increasing?
The past few decades have seen
considerable progress. The
UNDP says poverty has decreased more
in the last 50 years than in the last five
centuries. However, over three billion
individuals – more tha half the human
race – are trying to survive, living in
poverty on less than US $2 a day; 1.5
billion individuals have no drinking
water and over 2 billion do not get
basic health care. Seventy per- cent of
poor people are women, and two thirds
of poor people are under 15.
According to the World Bank, on
the basis of current projections the
number of people living in absolute
poverty (or on US $1 a day) looks set
to rise. By 2015, 1.9 billion people
could be living below the absolute
poverty threshold, compared to 1.5
billion people at the dawn of the new
millennium and 1.2 billion in 1987.
In 25 years time, at least 85 percent
of the total world population will
probably live in developing or
transitional economies, which will
have to bear the brunt of this
demographic growth – unless there
are new waves of South-North
migration. And the concentration of
resources in the hands of a few could
continue, or even intensify, which

would make the situation worse. In
addition, the rise in poverty can be
measured not only in economic terms
but also in terms of education,
technology, culture, environment and
health.
Some 800 million people in the
developing world suffer from chronic
malnutrition. The current decrease
(an average of eight million people a
year) is insufficient to fulfil the
pledge taken at the World Food
Summit in November 1996 by 186
countries: to cut by half the number
of people suffering from malnutrition
by 2015. This objective could only be
met if this figure decreased by 20
million people a year.

The events of September 11
and their consequences
seem to have created a new pattern
of international security, of war and
peace, in which an alliance of
“civilised” states faces countries
supporting international terrorism. Of
course this picture should be
qualified, if only to avoid spreading
the dangerous (and largely refuted)
myth of “a clash of civilisations.”
Despite the genuine risks of
international terrorism and the
tensions and imbalances it creates,
we must remember that this new
situation has not abolished the risks
there were before: it has simply
superimposed itself on them.
Since the end of the Cold War,
peace appears to be less impossible,

while war often seems to be that
much less improbable. A number of
states continue to devote considerable
sums to defence, which are then not
available when it comes to dealing
with the non-military threats to their
future. In addition, we have seen a
rise in the number of intra-State
confrontations and inter-ethnic or
inter-communal conflicts, which now
represent the type of conflict par
excellence at the dawn of the 21st
century. Such conflicts often take
place against a background of the
breakdown of the rule of law and of
the powerlessness of national
institutions. In such circumstances,
are we to fear the growth, in the
coming decades, of the phenomenon
of “failed states” and an increasing
number of conflicts that take place
without any respect whatsoever for
international legal norms, making any
attempt at mediation on the part of
international institutions extremely
difficult?

massacres and enormous human
rights violations, the growth of illegal
war economies and more violence in
schools and society? Will states and
international institutions in the
coming decades be reduced to
managing differences rather than
strengthening the social link?
The end of the Cold War aroused
great hopes: at long last, it would be
possible to substantially reduce
defence budgets and invest more in
human development, in particular
education. However, it has to be said
that the famous “peace dividends”
have yet to arrive. After the hopes of
a “disarmament race” which began in
1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
we are now seeing new increases in
military spending and new growth in
the arms trade.
The threats to peace and security
are no longer solely of a military
nature. In recent decades there has
been an increase in awareness, at
both the national and international
level, of the many different
dimensions of peace and security. In
view of the increasing
interdependence of political,
economic, financial, social and
environmental phenomena, will the
United Nations Security Council not
feel impelled to include on a more
systematic basis, among its fields of
competence, other threats which
endanger human security: the
degradation of the environment and
living conditions; population
problems; cultural and ethnic
rivalries; and all forms of violations
of human rights?
We must avoid
spreading the
dangerous myth 
of a “clash 
of civilizations”

The United Nations projects
that the world’s
population could reach eight billion
in 2028 and nine billion in 2054,
when it will then stabilize at about
that figure. Thus, there would not be
any demographic bomb, but a strong
increase followed by a levelling off;
according to some demographers
there could even be, in a few
decades’ time, an implosion: the low
projections by the United Nations
predict that world population will
reach a ceiling around 2050 of about
7.3 billion, and then begin to fall.
Since the demographic transition has
accelerated, it can therefore no longer
be excluded that the world’s
population will scarcely exceed
8 billion people by about 2050.
Demographic
changes
Moreover, the world’s population 
is ageing: the under 15s would go
from 31 percent to 19 percent of the
world’s population from 1995 to
2050, according to the United
Nations’ intermediate scenario, and
the over 60s would increase
proportionately during the same
period from 10 percent 
to 22 percent.
The geographical distribution of the
world’s population is also changing.
In the absence of strong migratory
flows that cannot be ruled out, the
populations of Europe and Japan
should decline over the next 50 years.
According to some analyses, there
would be no other solution than
immigration to offset the drastic
decrease in the balance between the
working and non-working
populations.
The causes of mortality are also
changing. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has warned of
an impending global crisis concerning
infectious diseases. Despite
considerable progress (smallpox has
been eradicated and polio and guinea
worm may also be), a third of deaths
worldwide are still attributable to
infectious diseases caused by bacteria
and viruses: some are new, others are
in constant mutation, while others
still have adapted to resist the

treatments that have protected us up
to the present, and they all have a
worrying tendency to travel. One
disease departs and another arrives:
in 1980, WHO announced the
worldwide eradication of smallpox; in
the following year, 1981, AIDS was
identified for the first time.
Meanwhile, major diseases like
tuberculosis are re-emerging, new
agents of infection such as the prion
have been identified, several known
diseases have developed resistance to
the traditional antibiotics, and
vaccine research is on the decline. In
Botswana, the country most affected
by the AIDS epidemic, a quarter of
the adult population is infected by
the AIDS virus. Life expectancy at
birth has fallen from 61 years to 47
years over the last decade, while,
without the AIDS epidemic, it would
now be 67 years. Life expectancy has
also fallen in the Russian Federation
and in several countries of the former
USSR.
There is a link between the
education of girls and issues of
population and development. There
are plenty of case studies on the
impact of the education of women on
social development and health, and
especially infant mortality and the
birth rate. Is not the best form of
contraception education for all
throughout life?

natural and cultural resources; the
right to housing; new problems of
urban citizenship and the contraction
of public space). If these trends are
confirmed, it has been estimated that
the equivalent of a thousand cities of
3 million inhabitants would have to
be built over the next 40 years –
almost as many cities as exist today.
Urban expansion is now strongest
in the poorest regions – where it is
unaccompanied by real development
– but also in those regions which 
are experiencing the most rapid
economic growth. In the latter case, 
a “boom” often produces a chaotic
explosion which gives rise to
considerable problems relating to the
provision of drinking water, energy
and food security, and to violence,
marginalization and exclusion.
Consequently, many countries have
experienced a growth of “gated
communities” surrounded by walls,
protected by barriers or isolated 
by distance. In the United States,
between four million and eight
million people, according to some
assessments, live like this in 
very highly protected residential
areas. According to an OECD report
published in 1996, 35 million
Americans live in 150,000
communities managed by private
associations.
Attracted by the bright lights of the
city, millions of people leave the
poverty of rural areas to go and live
in the wretched “accompanied
loneliness” of large cities, where they
often find themselves lacking 
the most elementary amenities, 
such as schools, sanitation or basic
infrastructure, in a situation of
poverty and exclusion that often
provides fertile ground for violence
and extremism. In such situations,
how are cities to be humanized? 
How are habits of urban behaviour
and civility to be re-created? How are
the excluded to be assimilated?

We now know that failing
widespread measures, the
impact of human activity on the
global environment threatens the
survival of the biosphere and future
generations:
Global climatic warming largely
results, according to the vast majority
of scientists, from “greenhouse gas”
emissions caused by human activity
and modern modes of consumption,
primarily those which are bound up
with urbanization (thermal power
plants, industrial pollution, motor
traffic, etc.). The thawing of the
Earth’s glaciers would lead to a
veritable ecological disaster. Global
warming also seems to be
accompanied by greater variability
and considerable regional or local
disturbances. These could be the
cause of radical climatic changes in
some regions of the world and of a
growing number of increasingly
serious “natural” disasters whose
precursory signs are already to be
observed. It is nevertheless clear that,
where control of greenhouse gas
emissions is concerned, the progress
made since the Rio Conference in
1992 has had a limited impact, as
shown by the problems of getting the
Kyoto Protocol ratified.

everywhere and for everyone. Almost
a quarter of humanity – 1.4 billion
people – does not have access to
clean and drinking water and over
half the world’s population lacks
proper sanitation. To meet the
challenges will require above all
policies on the judicious use of water
resources so as to put an end to the
excessive consumption of water in
agriculture, which at present uses up
worldwide close to two thirds of all
the water taken from rivers, lakes,
streams and underground. But
behaviour patterns must also change.
The depletion of the ozone layer,
protector of life on Earth, has never
been so great. But there are
encouraging signs: if the provisions of
international protocols are complied
with, the ozone layer could be
completely reconstituted by 2050.
Desertification is spreading and
today directly affects 250 million
people and is threatening close to one
billion human beings living on arid
lands in approximately 110 countries.

the present rate.

regarding access to knowledge,

developed and developing countries,
and even within countries. 
Many experts consider the

digitization and mathematization of
the real are not without their
drawbacks: a certain ontological link
with reality slackens, opening the
way to many abuses, of which image

a foretaste. But above all, the spread
of digital representations encourages
a certain confusion between truth
and fiction, nature and artifice, reality
and the depiction of what we believe
to be reality. It encourages the
manipulation of codes, images and
symbols.

expectations since it creates a new

Most of all, participation in the
“civilization of the immaterial” is
extremely patchy in different parts of
the world. How can we fight against
“techno-apartheid” when, as we
know, the new technologies are one
of the keys to the 21st century, to
accessing information and setting up
distance education networks? A

democracy and pluralism. But the
ongoing revolution also raises some
essential questions about the
consequences of this form of
“globalization.” Apart from the
industrial innovation that the new
information and communication
technologies introduce, societal
options can be discerned. How can
we help “maintain, increase and
diffuse knowledge,” as UNESCO’s
Charter requires, in this radically new
context? Some are already speaking
indiscriminately of the “information
society” and the “knowledge society”.
Should we not stop confusing
“information” and “knowledge”? The
oversupply of information may be
condemning knowledge – which
involves mastery of information
through knowledge and critical
reflection. In short, education.

f o c u scountry, however powerful, can solve
them by itself.
To meet all these challenges for the
future, which are complex, global and
interlinked, there is no task quite so
difficult or so pressing as learning to
live together. Faced with an
increasingly globalized market, are
we moving towards more developed
forms of international and regional
democracy?
New actors have emerged on the
international scene who are changing
the practice of democracy,
participation, association, and even
the rules of the game in international
cooperation. Granted, the 21st
century will most likely not see the
disappearance of the world order
based on the state; but within states
and at the international level, the
power of civil society seems set to
grow. Will a new culture of
democracy strengthen the links
between representative and
participatory democracy? The 21st
century must therefore provide an
answer to this crucial question: how
can we humanize globalization in
light of these new challenges and
threats?

Will the “globalization” of
most of the challenges
that we have mentioned make it a
matter of increasing urgency to
strengthen systems of international
and regional governance? According
to Boutros Boutros-Ghali, “the only
institution that exists, and which has
the means for solving such global
problems, is the United Nations.” 
In a world which is interdependent
and increasingly aware of its common
destiny, the solution of problems
requires coordinated action at the
global level, whether it concerns
environment or public health, the
fight against corruption or organized
crime. These and many other issues

UNESCO’s fields of competence. In
view of these advances, the role of
women should grow during the first
decades of the 21st century and most
societies should move towards greater
gender equality.
The most remarkable advances are
those that have been made in
education. Significant progress has
also been achieved with regard to
health: the life expectancy of women
has risen at a rate 20 percent higher
than that of men during the past 20
years; their average fertility rate has
fallen by one third. Very slowly, the
gateways to political power are
opening up to women, at least in
some countries. Despite popular
belief, this progress has been even
more appreciable in the South.
However, the progress achieved over
the past 30 years in the fields of
education, health and participation has
far from eliminated all the obstacles.
With regard to education, nearly two
thirds of the 880 million illiterates in
the world are women, and one adult
woman in three today cannot read or
write; most of them live in rural areas.
Despite their specific health and
nutrition needs, women, particularly in
the Third World, receive poorer care
than men. In politics and in the
professions, in spite of recent progress,
Of all the inequalities linked
to development, gender
inequality is one of the most specific,

those that are most advanced and
proudest of their achievements in this
regard. Contrary to received wisdom,
progress in gender equality is not
always related to the wealth of a
country, or even – at first sight more
surprisingly – to the level of what
UNDP calls “human development.” It
is more a question of how
development is viewed, of political
will, cultural change, and the
commitment of society at large.

The insufficiency of women’s rights
is reflected in the moral and physical
persecution and oppression of women.
Violence against women and rape as
an instrument of war continue to be
used in order to spread terror and
intimidation during armed conflicts.
Domestic violence and the sexual

woman are still coming up against
“glass ceilings.”
Poverty affects women
disproportionately. Of all those living
in absolute poverty, 70 percent are
women, and the number of women
living in poverty in rural areas has
practically doubled in 20 years. With
regard to work, improved training for
women has not yet translated into
higher income, effective equal rights
and social recognition. In other words,
the vast majority of women remain
confined to what some economists call
the “pink ghetto”: service staff,
subsistence agriculture and poorly
paid office jobs. In addition, in all
regions of the world, unemployment
and underemployment affect women
more than men. Women still do not
receive equal treatment with men
when it comes to property and
inheritance rights or rights relating to
marriage and divorce.

It is probable that the rise of
the new information and
communication technologies,
information networking, and growing
interactivity and interconnectivity will
substantially and permanently alter
not only the economic, social and
political landscape, but also the
cultural landscape in the coming
decades.
The key question is whether
globalization and the new technologies
will promote the rise of cultural
pluralism, dialogue and cross-cultural
encounters. If so, what will be the
nature of those encounters? Will they
be rewarding and creative, or will they
be hostile and destructive? Are we
heading for a “clash of civilizations” or
cultural and ethnic hybridization?
Will the new encounters between
cultures will lead to the dominance of
one or more of them over the others

(even the cultural homogenization
feared by some). Or will they
exacerbate cultural differences and
bring about new cultural
fragmentation? Put another way, what
will happen to the rich diversity of
cultures in an increasingly global,
“networked” and interconnected
world? Let us not forget that at least
half (or perhaps a lot more) of the
5,000 to 6,700 languages spoken in the
world today may die out by the end 
of this century.
Will cultural identities, over the
coming decades, replace citizenship or
help to reinforce and reinvent it?
According to French sociologist Alain
Touraine, “the central question to
which political thought and action
must respond” is “how to restore a link
between the excessively open space 
of the economy and the extremely
closed and fragmented world of
cultures?” Another question then
arises: what type of identities and what
sorts of authorities will be fostered by
the information society and the
information networks?
The technologization of culture is
another observable trend. The
application to culture of industrial
techniques, while helping to
disseminate culture, may also presage
the disappearance of traditional ways
of producing and transmitting it. Will

the new facilities for duplicating,

manipulating images and sounds speed
the rise of a society of pretence and a
fully virtual era? What will intellectual
property mean in the new context?
What will the future of copyright be? 
The 21st century will have to meet
another challenge: how to ensure the
access of all to culture, and to all
cultures. How can we foster genuine
dialogue between cultures? In what
direction is the digital world moving:
will networks be opening up or
becoming more exclusive? In this
context, one of the major issues of the
coming decades will surely be
development of information in the
public domain and providing equal
access to it, in particular in developing
countries.
What effect will the new
technologies have on books and
reading? The increasing digitization of
written texts and the development of
new aids are already giving rise to new
forms of writing and reading but also
of printing and circulating material;
books are becoming a form of raw
material that can be manipulated
endlessly. With interactivity, readers
now have an almost infinite number of
choices with regard to texts and, as a
result, reading could become genuinely
plural and pluralist.
What is more, the new technologies
will be bringing about marked changes
in the creation and communication of
knowledge. In the 21st century,
textbooks and educational texts in
general might be designed with a view
to greater interactivity between the
various fields of knowledge in order to
meet the individual needs and tastes of
every learner. They would thus
encourage self-instruction and self-
learning and a new way of reading
akin to navigation.
Another major trend is the
development of the notion of heritage,
which has broadened over the last few
decades from preservation of the
cultural and natural to recognition of
intangible, symbolic and spiritual
heritage and then to protection of the
human genome. What will the new
terrain of heritage be like in coming
decades?

Science and technology:
the new ethical
challenges
The many advances in
biotechnology, genetics,
astrophysics and the sciences of the
infinitely large and the infinitely
small are revolutionizing our
perception of living things and the
world around us.
In many cases these scientific and
technological advances hold the
promise of positive applications for
the benefit of humankind. This is
true of progress in genetic
engineering, which is paving the way
for new gene therapies. It also applies
to the development of energy-efficient
techniques and the field of
nanotechnology, which concerns
medicine and computer technology.
Use of biotechnology in agriculture
could, if properly controlled, help
combat food shortages.
But these advances also raise
questions and ethical concerns. To
begin with, there is the application of
technology to living organisms,
especially human beings. Will the
power to artificialize nature and
manipulate species – even the human
species – take us into the “brave new
world” foreseen by Aldous Huxley
and an ethically unacceptable
situation in which humans
domesticate other humans? What
status will human beings have when
they are the object of manipulation,

experimentation, mutilation or even
destruction? What, in this new
context, will be the meaning of life
and death? Who will decide on the
supposed “usefulness” of a particular
genetic feature? Parallel manipulation
of the genetic heritage of plant and
animal species will in future decades
surely be an unprecedented challenge
for the global environment.
Over and above society and the
environment, the very definition of
the human species and its biological
integrity is at stake and in danger.
Human beings can now alter the
genetic heritage of any species,
including their own. They even have
the dismal privilege of being able to
plan their own destruction. What
must be done now is to agree to
limit, through ethical guidelines and
wisdom, the currently boundless
power of technology. We must apply
to technology Montesquieu’s maxim
that absolute power corrupts
absolutely. We must apply to science
Rabelais’ observation that science
without conscience is but the ruin of
the soul.
