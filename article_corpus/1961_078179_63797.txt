LAS MENINAS by DIEGO VELAZQUEZ.

VELAZQUEZ A LA PICASSO
When he was 14 years old, Pablo Picasso visited the Prado in Madrid with his father
and saw for the first time the famous painting, "Las Meninas" (Ladies in Waiting),
masterpiece of the 17th century Spanish artist, Velazquez (see special issue Unesco
Courier, December 1960). It was an experience he never forgot. The memory
of this court scene with its wealth of detail and the engaging figure of the tiny Infanta
haunted him for years. "What a picture," he once remarked to a friend. "What
realism !... What a marvellous achievement." In the autumn of 1957, Picasso brought
to artistic fruition years of pent-up feelings about Velazquez' great work. For two
months he shut himself away from his friends and created a series of 45 paintings
in which he took for his theme the whole or parts of " Las Meninas. " The largest
canvas, 6 feet by nearly 9 feet, painted in monochrome (below centre) incorporates
all of the main features found in the original. Many of the series are innumerable
variations of aspects of the original, particularly those studies of the Infanta which
reveal Picasso's remarkable versatility and his audacious treatment of the work.
