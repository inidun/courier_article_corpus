THE POWER-PACKED ATOM
It could end the world's shortage of energy
RAW MATERIAL of ato¬
mic energy is plentiful in
France. Here official of the
French Atomic Energy Com¬
missariat is examining a
"sample of pitchblende (ura¬
nium bearing ore). Map

of uranium deposits. These
deposits in France as well
as others of thorium and
beryllium in Madagascar have
been important factors in the
development of France's
atomic energy programme.
As a man needs food to stay alive,
so modern urban, civilized living
demands energy for its sus¬
tenance. Energy is hard to define,
since it is not a thing and has no size
or weight. It is the basis of action, the
capacity for doing work. It is the
difference between an object in motion
and one at rest, the difference between
hot, expanding steam and cold water,
between coal that can burn and rocks
that cannot.
In each case the first material con¬
tains energy which it loses in action.
Invisible and intangible, energy is res
ponsible for anything and everything
that happens in the universe.
Men and animals get energy from the
food they eat. In a primitive society
that energy is enough for a day's work,
but in most parts of the world a man
can barely support himself and his
family by the work of his own muscles.
A horse, camel or bullock increases his
production and his wealth. In an
organized society, light and warmth,
transportation and manufacturing
must all be supplied from fuels, the
wind, or energy from the sun. The
more industrial a society is, the more
it needs energy and the "development"
of a country requires first of all a
supply of energy.
A pound of bread or of rice provides
about 1,200 calories to the human body.
Two or three pounds of food a day
2,500 to 3,000 caloriesfurnish the
energy that is needed for an ordinary
day's work. This, plus a little more
for cooking or for warmth, is enough
for a simple life. But an industrialized
country needs far more energy.
In the U.S.A., for instance, the total
for each person is 172,000 calories per
day. This is almost sixty times the

energy that a man generates, so that
in such countries every man, woman
and child has the equivalent of sixty
labourers working for him.
In the discussion oí the United
Nations project for the use of atomic
energy, M. Jules Moch, French delegate
and former Minister of the Interior,
discussed the growing need for energy
in all the countries of the earth. In
the major industrial countries the use
of power doubled during the first third
of this century and at present is about
half a horsepower per
person. In the U.S.A
the power used in fac¬
tories, excluding trans¬
portation and motors,
was only 0.19 horse¬
power per person in
1909 but 0.50 horse¬
power in 1950. This is
approximately 400 times
the power demand in
the underdeveloped ter¬
ritories of Asia, Africa
and America.
For the world as a
whole, the average use
for power per man is
now only one sixth of
that in the U.S.A.
Hence if the industria¬
lization of the rest of
the world is to reach
the level prevalent in
North America, the
total energy available
will have to be multi¬
plied at least six times
over. Expressed in
terms of coal, the pro¬
duction would have to
be increased from 2,500
million tons to 15,000
million tons per year.
The average American
uses 8 tons of coal a
year, the European, 2.2,
whereas the man in a
practically underdeve¬
loped country only
makes use of 0 02 tons.
This is another way of
saying that the most
industrialized countries
use 400 times as much
energy per person as
developed.
If the world's consumption of fuels
were doubled, to say nothing of being
multiplied sixfold, our underground
resources would soon prove inadequate.
The oil and natural gas will last for
only decades and the coal for some
centuries. Yet in the industrial coun¬
tries the coal of high quality that is
easily mined is already becoming
exhausted, so that at best the cost of
coal will increase and its quality will
decrease. For this reason far-seeing
engineers are gravely concerned over
the future of the industries that depend
on underground fuels.
But what is more important is the
striking disparity in the coal resources
available in different countries. An
industrial future is hardly possible for
countries that have little coal or oil.
To transport a hundred million tons of
coal for thousands of miles would incur
a cost of a thousand million dollars for
freight alone. It is a prohibitive cost.
It is for this reason that the newly
created resource of atomic energy is
attractive. If the atom can be
harnessed to provide the energy, the
PROBING NATURE'S SECRETS: One day energy from the atom wrll help to ease
the dram on such natural fuels as oil, coal and natural gas, on which the demands of industry
and modern life are making ever-greater inroads. In the meantime scientists are experi¬
menting with the production of synthetic fuels. Here, two scientists of the Gulf Oil
Company, in Pennsylvania, probe into the still mysterious reaction by which petrol is
made from coal. They use radio-isotopes as "tracers". (Photo, Gulf Oil Co.)
do the least industrialized countries need not fear
the increasing cost and decreasing
supply of coal. The countries that
have no coal can hope to compete at
once even if its cost is higher than the
present cost of energy in the industrial
countries.
A striking example is the situation
of so highly industrial a country as
Switzerland. The economy of that
country is based on water power
generated from the ample Alpine
streams. Yet Switzerland faces a
future in which this power will not be
enough to meet its needs.
Recently, Mr. Alfred Winiger de¬
scribed the situation to representatives
of Swiss electrical industries. He fore¬
sees a continuing increase in the de¬
mand for energy of about 3.8 % per
year. On the basis of this estimate he
concludes that : "By 1975 the demand
for energy in Switzerland will no lon¬
ger be met by our hydraulic resources,
which are today used at 50 % of the to¬
tal available. According to circumstan¬
ces, we should have new sources of
energy at our disposal between 1970
and 1975 if we wish to avoid being too
dependent on foreign sources for our
energy requirements.
"Taking these fac¬
tors into consideration,
it is quite logical that
we should turn to nu¬
clear reactors for our
future source of energy.
We should then conti¬
nue to depend on for¬
eign sources for the
delivery of atomic fuel,
but, on the other hand,
the cost of transport of
the fuel, which at pre¬
sent weighs heavily on
our economy, should
be virtually eliminated.
In effect, a ton of ura¬
nium, used to the
maximum, produces as
much heat as 3 million
tons of coal. To trans¬
port this coal from the
mines of the Ruhr to
Zurich would alone cost
nearly 120 million Swiss
francs, plus the cost of
storage. The saving in
transport costs would
permit us to lighten
considerably our ba¬
lance of payments
abroad."
M. Jules Moch, speak¬
ing to the General As¬
sembly of the United
Nations said:
"These considerations
point out the direction
to be taken by human
effort. If the standard
of living of the under¬
developed majority of
mankind is to be in¬
creased and if the standard of living
of the industrialized minority is to be
maintained and improved man must
and soon exploit new power resources
The achievement of that goal is, in the
last analysis, the very condition of
social progress.
"Does atomic energy offer a solution
to this problem of replacing exhausted
or decreasing power resources? Theo¬
retically, this is no' doubt true... The
total annihilation of a gramme of
material, any material, would release
the power equivalent to that released
by the burning -of 20 million tons of
coal. The present needs of all
mankind, -counted in millions of tons

of coal, would thus be realized by the
disintegration of 300 pounds of matter.
"However, we do not yet know how
completely to annihilate a particle of
matter and turn it into energy. Per¬
haps not even our descendants will
know how to do so. The phenomenon
of fission obliterates less than one-
thousandth part of the materials
involved. The phenomenon of fusion,
if it could be carried out in a slowed-
down manner, would bring about the
disappearance of less than a hundr¬
edth part of the materials involved.
"We should therefore have to subject
to fission masses of material one
thousand times larger than the
quantities I have just mentioned in
order to produce the same amount of
energy and power. In other words, we
would have to operate in terms of tons
rather than in terms of pounds. In
fact, still speaking theoretically, it
would be necessary to bring about the
fission of 130 long tons of uranium 235,
rather than 300 pounds to produce the
equivalent of the energy produced by
the burning of 2,500 million tons of
coal.
"Let us suppose that fission becomes
industrially feasible in a number of
years. It is not so today and... we have
still a few years to go. Let us also
assume that a procedure can be used
that is still in the experimental stage,
the "breeder" procedure (see page 21).
Let us also suppose that the output of
this operation in a certain number of
years reached 50 per cent efficiency,
under these conditions the reaction
would have to use 300 tons of material
per year in order to produce the total
power now being used. However, since
URANIUM MINE near Limouzat, France, is one of several
being worked by the Research and Mining Operations Branch
of the French Atomic Energy Commissariat (C.E.A.). Uranium
has been known since 1789 when a German chemist, Martin
Klaproth, discovered an oxide of this element and named it
after the planet Uranus. But a French chemist, Eugène Péligot,
¡n 1841, was the first to isolate pure uranium.

Dôme, Central France. Here the ore is brought to the surface
and transported by cable car to nearby processing plant. In
its pure form uranium is a white metallic element, slightly softer
than steel and more than I 8 times as heavy as water. It occurs
widejy in the earth's crust, though most minerals contain only
a small proportion of the element.

we cannot hope for such technical
progress except after a lapse of a
number of years, we must envisage a
doubling of the power' consumption
over the same period, and it would be
necessary to have natural uranium at
our disposal, as well as thorium, at the
rate of 600 tons per year.
"And finally, in order to give the
peoples of the world the American level
of industrialization, the quantity re¬
quired would be almost 4,000 tons per
annum. Since fruitful breeder ma¬
terials are involved, these figures can
be reached without any insurmountable
difficulties, but the technical pro-
to all peoples. In the same manner,
the portable reactors now being built
in America which are known by the
striking and expressive name of "power
package" constitute a happy augury
for the international proletarization, if
I may so call it, of power to be placed
at the disposal of mankind.
"One hurdle remains, and that is the
question of cost. It is certainly rash to
prophesy, since we do not know the cost
oi atomic power production in large
central plants which would utilize
breeder and fissionable materials at
the same time. We do not know to
what point the progressive exhaustion

May 1953. In England, the cost of
electric current over the same period
was .8 cents and the price at which it
was sold to industry was between 1.1
and 1.3 cents per kilowatt hour. I
shall not cite the French figures,
because we are rather poorly endowed
so far as power costs and power
resources are concerned. It might be
hoped that in the near future a cost
of .7 cents or .ßVents per kilowatt hour
could be achieved by means of atomic
energy if such projects were realized in
conformity with the hopes of their
sponsors, and it might be supposed that
atomic energy would rapidly competo
with conventional energy sources, even
in those countries where the latter are
low in cost.
"The ease of transportation... would
give atomic energy this rare virtue of
being saleable everywhere at the same
prices or at just about the same prices.
cedures must still be perfected and,
therefore, the general use of atomic
energy by this process, which as yet
has not been fully explored can be
carried out only gradually.
"Let us, therefore, forego any exag¬
gerated hopes. And here we come to
the core of the problem. The ad¬
vantages of this process, as regards the
underdeveloped areas of the world, are
incalculable. The 600 tons of uranium
which I previously envisaged would
correspond to a doubling of today's
consumption of fuel, equivalent to the
consumption of 5,000 million tons of
coal. With an extraction rate of 1 per
cent of metal, the 600 tons of uranium
would require 60,000 tons of ore, which
is a tonnage 80,000 times less than that
of the coal that would be required to
produce the same energy.
"The transition from the thermal era
to the atomic era would thus take the
form of a reduction, by a ratio of 80,000
to 1, of the weight of the. materials or
ores to be extracted, and a reduction of
100 times larger would make the ratio
8 million to 1 in the weight of the fuel
to be transported from the mine to the
furnace. Atomic power thus appears
to be easily dispersable and transferable
into regions lacking in other resources.
"This sort of dissemination doubtless
would spell immense social progress in
making available large power resources

of coal and of oil resources will raise
the price of conventional power
sources. Comparisons of future prices
are still impossible, and we must there¬
fore limit ourselves to the present day,
even though we are fully aware that
the present data will not apply
tomorrow.
"Today, the cost of power produced
in large American power plants using
coal is in the region of .4 cents per
kilowatt hour. The average for other
countries is between .5 and .6 cents per
kilowatt hour, according to the study
carried out by Professor Weinberg in
It would therefore be the main power
resource of countries where con¬
ventional power sources are scarce or
costly, that is to say, essentially in most
of the under-developed areas of the
globe. Perhaps an international orga¬
nization, prompted by some feeling of
international solidarity, might assign
some sort of priority to the latter areas.
"But even if atomic energy were to
become competitive, the fact would
remain that the transition from the
classical power era to the atomic power
era will be a gradual and prolonged
one."
