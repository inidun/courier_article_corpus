A land on the move
CANADA'S FAR NORTH
by Irene Baird
HAT is the quality about
Canada's northern territories the huge
lands that lie north of the ten pro¬
vinces that pricks the curiosity and
stirs the imagination of so much of
the rest of the world?
Only about 40,000 people live there.
No more than could be lost in the
IRENE BAIRD, Canadian writer and novelist,
has made a special study of development
problems in Canada's far northern territo¬
ries. She has also served as a consultant
to the U.N. Technical Assistance Adminis¬
tration on press and information needs of
technical assistance missions in the field.
metropolitan areas of Montreal and
Toronto.
The north is not the home of the
world-famous. For all its exotic image,
that journalists and television produ¬
cers from other countries come so far
and try so hard to catch in print and
on film, few northerners are known by
name outside Canada. And the names
of the few who are may be hard to
pronounce. Like Kenojuak, the bril¬
liant young Eskimo artist whose graphic
art and sculpture have created for her
a reputation far beyond the village of
Cape Dorset where she lives.
Is there some spell then about sheer
size and remoteness? The north is
big; a million and a half square
miles in area; one third of the second
largest, country in the world (only the
U.S.S.R. is bigger than Canada). But
size alone explains nothing in a world
generously endowed with big countries.
And air travel has made remoteness,
even in the most far-off places, a rel¬
ative word.
From Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg
and Vancouver, the Yukon and the
Northwest Territories are only flying
hours away. Their capitals, Whitehorse

Inuvik, a village in Canada's far
northwest, 400 kilometres (350 miles)
within the Arctic Circle, is now an
important scientific community. Since
a government research station was
set up there nearly six years ago,
geologists, physicists, meteorologists
and ice-observers have been using
the north as a huge outdoor laboratory,
assembling data that will be used to
develop the arctic regions. Left,

and Yellowknife, are linked to southern
Canada by air service that ranges from
jets to the two-seaters used by pros¬
pectors and geologists. On northern
airfields or moored to a lakeside dock,
these bright-painted tough little planes
look frail as dragonflies.
If, on some winter days, when in
southern as well as northern Canada
planes are grounded and you cannot
reach the north, your voice still can.
Mass communications the Northern
Service of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, telephone, telex, the bul¬
letins of the arctic weather stations
feed north and south in a continuous
two-way exchange.
It's a rare home in the north that
doesn't have a radio; the voice of the
CBC reaches Eskimo and Indian liste¬
ners in their own dialects. Northerners
like to talk and on radio everybody has
a chance to air their views and hear
what the other fellow is saying. If
city listeners grow bored with radio,
not so the isolated. Voices are a vital
human link not only between the north
and south but between widely scat¬
tered communities throughout the
north.
Yet for all the great contributions
of science and technology the north is
still inwardly and outwardly frontier
country, full of the style and spirit of
a region moving towards the status of
a province and impatient to achieve it.
A land where weather and distance
can be at their most formidable and
the individual whatever his race counts
heavily. He is himself; not a mere
digit of man in the mass. People from
other countries must find this frontier
quality attractive, too, because so
many of them are in the north.
Geography has created no set pat¬
tern for the land save its immense
size. The territories extend west to
east from the borders of Alaska to
the rocky east coast of Baffin Island
and north from the provincial bounda¬
ries to the continental limits of Canada
in the high arctic.
Within this rough triangle lies a jig¬
saw puzzle of mountains and tundra,
uncountable lakes and semi-deserts,

CANADA'S FAR NORTH (Continued)
vast expanses of spongy muskeg, stark
out-croppings of ancient rock. A land¬
scape built from millions of years of
geological time.
The north is many things to many
different sorts of men.
To the mining executive it is an
area of potential wealth and high cost
operation. One man who is now
engaged on a major mining develop¬
ment 300 miles inside the Arctic Circle
has said, "In a remote northern loca¬
tion. . . the ordinary difficulties are
multiplied a thousand times." He was
referring here to the whole parapher¬
nalia of development from discovery to
markets. Yet all over the north the
work gets done. Obstacles are beaten
down or bent and twisted into oppor¬
tunities.
To the scientists working at the
government research station at Inuvik
in the western arctic, the north is a
huge outdoor laboratory where life
forms range from Nanook, the polar
bear, to delicate summer butterflies
and ferocious mosquitos. A region
where caribou, musk-ox, polar bear
and the sea mammals can be studied
as they move and drift among the
solitudes driven by urges older than
science. Where geologists, geo¬
graphers, physicists, meteorologists
and ice observers probe the secrets
of air, land and sea providing basic
data for northern development and
adding their knowledge to the pool
of world science.
In 1962, a year before the Inuvik
station was opened, the (then) Depart¬
ment of Northern Affairs and National
Resources initiated a Grants program¬
me to meet the need for more trained
scientists, to stimulate research in the
north and encourage Canadian univer¬
sities and other interested bodies to
engage in northern studies and expe¬
ditions. From a modest $60,000 the
first year, the Grants programme has
increased to $595,000 this year and
includes aid to ten Canadian universi¬
ties, the Yukon Research and Develop-

ment Institute at Whitehorse and the
Arctic Institute of North America.
But science, vital though it is, is
only one segment of a total programme.
Engineers, town-planners, and adminis¬
trators who, once their spending esti¬
mates are approved by Parliament must
think immediately of getting their pro¬
grammes both onto and off the ground,
tend to regard life in the north in less
esoteric terms. To them and their
colleagues, the teachers, doctors, in¬
dustrial development officers and a
complex of connecting professions and
jobs, life is a day-to-day succession
of fronter rewards and setbacks. Var¬
iety and challenge, boredom and iso¬
lation, companionship and moments
of adventure northern service has
them all.
These are mainly the men and the
women who come from southern
Canada and whose present contribution
is vital. But the people who will count
most in the long run are the northern¬
ers; thosë'who were born in the north
or have made it their home; who have
roots in the present and a stake in the
future. With the movement of the
government of the Northwest Terri¬
tories into the north later this year a
pioneer step will be taken to bring the
Northwest Territories closer to the
day when it attains provincial status.
The Yukon is likely to achieve this
first.
T,HE Northwest Territories
adjoins the Yukon along its eastern
boundary and is all that its small, com¬
pact and homogenous neighbour is not.
Unlike the Yukon, which borders on
Alaska to the west and Is 520,000
square kilometres (202,000 square
miles) in area, the Northwest Territories
occupies 3,230,000 square kilometres
(1.25 million square miles) and is larger
than the combined area of six prov¬
inces. About 14,700 people live in the
Yukon and some 25,000 in the North¬
west Territories. All but about 200 of
the total Eskimo population of 12,500
live in the Northwest Territories and
arctic Quebec. The northern Indian
population of some 4,500 are settled
in both Territories in about equal
numbers.
In the past dozen years, the north
has been moving into the mainstream
of the Canadian future. From the
most northerly arctic weather station
on Ellesmere Island to the bustling,
well-settled, mining capitals of White-
horse and Yellowknife it is all very
much a part of contemporary Canada.
It is easy to write about the north in
segments but hard to describe it as a
whole. It Is too massive, too contra¬
dictory and there is too much going
on. As the Eskimo hunter remarked
after inspecting the first plane he had
ever seen on the ground, "This is a
bad thing to know just a little about."
But it draws you back and back to
learn more.
The education programme is as good
an example as any of how solid pro¬
gress can be so diffused over the
huge area it has to cover that it is
only when some fairly spectacular
stage of progress has been reached
that the peaks appear.
Throughout the north children of all
races go to school together. And no
segment of the government's total
northern commitment has been the
object of more effort and concern than
how to bring education to the children

Ways of life in the Arctic have changed over the last twenty years and
living standards have improved considerably. More and more
Eskimo people live in houses of wood (below), instead of igloos.
Increasingly the Eskimos tend to give up a nomadic life and settle
permanently in places where wood and other materials are available.

Pre-university education

of the north; all the children. And as
many adults as wish to have it.
A dozen years ago when the pro¬
gramme first got off the ground the
federal school system consisted of one
school In the arctic village of Tuktoyak¬
tuk north of Inuvik. Today there are 64
federal schools that range from two-
classroom schools in isolated commu¬
nities, where, all the children except
those of the teacher may be Eskimo, to
residential and vocational schools in
the larger centres where academic
studies can take qualified students to
university level or offer them a practical
trade and commercial training.
B

I Y January 1966, 7,000 chil¬
dren were in school approximately 85
per cent Eskimo children, 75 per cent
of Indian children and almost 100 per
cent of others of school age. During
the period July 1, 1964, to June 30, 1965,
91.2 per cent of northern children and
teenagers were in school.
Included in a total teaching staff
of 380 are specialists in northern cur¬
ricula. Theirs has been the early ex¬
perience, path-finding, experiment, trial
and error. Northern children are keen
learners and Eskimo children quicker
to pick up English than their teachers
to learn Eskimo. Strongly creative as
an ethnic group, Eskimo children de¬
light in the messy joys of finger paint¬
ing with bright colours on large sheets
of brown paper and modelling in clay
the birds and animals they watch their
fathers and older brothers carve in
soapstone.
Since radio reception in winter in the
more isolated communities is unreliable,
teachers rely on taped programmes
rather than live and use a great many
films, filmstrips and wall charts. By
1971, the education programme will
have reached the point where it is
providing a pre-university education
to standards as high as any in Canada.
The test of the programme's success
lies somewhere within the next ten
years. One criterion will be how many
qualified young northerners of all
races will be occupying positions and
holding down jobs now filled by Cana¬
dians from the south. How many Eski¬
mo and Indian teachers will be teaching
children of their own race? How many
young people will have made a suc¬
cess of the job of their choice if
they decide to leave the north and
try their luck elsewhere In Canada?
And so clear across the north through
almost the whole range of skills and
professions. The over-riding question
known to every planner, teacher and
vocational training expert associated
with the programme is how many jobs
will be waiting for these bright ones
when they are ready for them.
If you have seen a group of Eskimo
children or teenagers in school, you
will know with what zest they advance
on any opportunity to learn some new
thing that interests them. Particularly
any skill that can be expressed through
their hands drawing modelling, paint¬
ing.
It is not the Eskimo children that
teachers have to "sell" on school
attendance; it is their parents, some
of whom still do not approve of their
children being kept at a desk when
they could be out with their families
hunting or fishing or helping around
the house or the boat. The days of the
kayak have been succeeded by the
power-operated canoe and the Peter¬
head; both can move fast to the seal
and walrus hunting grounds and hunt¬
ing is a family affair.
I ANY who may know little
else about Canada have heard of
Eskimo art. By now the sculpture,
prints and fine crafts have been shown
in many world capitals where they have
had a great success. Those who
regret the passing of "primitive" carv¬
ing should remember that a vital art
does not live in the past, nor do artists
with something to say.
In May 1967, an Important collection
will be shown at the Galerie Iris Clert
in Paris.
Those who own. the art quite often
remark on the Eskimo's gift for con¬
veying so much in deceptively simple
lines. They ask how do the artists
achieve this feeling of strength? Do
they drive themselves hard? Do they
ever seem unsure of what the end
result will be? How do they work?
Most Eskimos seem to work in a
concentrated way, yet giving a feeling
of being relaxed about it, too. I mean
they give a sense of enjoying what they
are doing and not being anxious about
it, though, like all artists, they must
have their anxieties. Will this crude,
dusty lump of soapstone turn into the
shapes they wish it to? Will the
colours of a drawing, the texture of a
print, turn out right?
Perhaps they ask themselves these
questions. But the feeling I get about

GOOD-BYE
TO ISOLATION
Canada's once-isolated vast northern territories
(only 40,000 inhabitants, including 12,500 Eskimos
and 4,500 Indians) are today moving into the
mainstream of Canadian life. Ships may still
be trapped in the Arctic ice for months on
end (right), but communications are maintained
by planes and helicopters. If blizzards put
a stop to hunting, planes quickly drop supplies
of meat from reindeer herds maintained for
such emergencies by the government (below
right). Above, young Eskimo woman, elegant
in the traditional winter costume of her
people, works as a secretary in the civic
centre of Tuktoyatuk (below).

CANADA'S FAR NORTH (Continued)
An art
of all seasons
them when they work is quietness, an
easy, concentrated strength. At Cape
Dorset and other talented communities
such as Povungnituk, Holman, and
Baker Lake, the artists enjoy their
success and the extra money, too. But
they don't get excited about it.
I remember noticing this quality of
quiet collectedness in Kananginak, one
of Dorset's best hunters and an excel¬
lent artist, when he came south to the
opening of a- new collection at which
his own and his wife's work were
represented. He received a good deal
of publicity but remained quite unruf¬
fled by it.
At one stage, when the opening was
over and a cocktail party was in full
swing, shrill and noisy, I asked Kanan¬
ginak if the noise bothered him. The
interpreter said something and they
both laughed, then the interpreter
replied, "Kananginak says the noise
does not bother him at all. It just
reminds him of standing below a cliff
of gulls when someone is raiding the
nests."

IN 1966 the Dorset group,
after three years of experiment, added
fabric design to sculpture and graphic
art and won one of Canada's National
Design Awards.
The colours capture the magic of
the arctic in summer, clear yellow,
mauve and blue of rock flowers, red
and orange of the midnight sun, the
soft greens of the lichens and Dorset
soapstone. Many are bird designs,
always a favorite with Eskimo artists.
Birds that fly, birds that walk, geese
that run when chased by a boy with
a stick.
Everything about this arctic land¬
scape, every changing season, every
creature that walks or swims or flies
is part of the Eskimo's life and there¬
fore of his art. So is that other
landscape where the spirits dwell.
A Canadian poet has written of the
arctic:
A land where all is space
And nothing time
Where today was tomorrow
And tomorrow will be yesterday.
And when you turn off your radio
and step out of your warm house and
walk alone on the tundra you find
that this is how the land still is.

In the craft centre at Cape Dorset, 2,000 kms
(1,200 miles) north of Montreal, Lutkak works on a
stone carving. Drawings and carvings by other
Eskimo artists decorate the studio.
ARTISTS OF THE TUNDRA
Though living a difficult nomad existence in a harsh
climate, the Eskimos of Canada have developed over the
centuries a unique art form, as ancient carvings excav¬
ated in Manitoba confirm. Today, as in the past, the
Eskimos carve in walrus tusk ivory, caribou antlers and
stone and draw designs on sealskin. They draw inspi¬
ration from their everyday life and ancient legends and
they recreate with consummate skill the forms of the
animals of the tundra which they hunt for food and cloth¬
ing. Some years ago, the Canadian Government set up
a craft centre at Cape Dorset (Baffin Land) where men
and women artists can create works that are becoming
increasingly known and appreciated around the world.
