About a year ago I was in London at the invitation of
British psychologists and sociologists in order to lecture
on "National Stereotypes". Throughout the preceding
day, during which I was undoubtedly made more sensitive by
my preoccupation with this topic, I kept running into exam¬
ples of such stereotyped thinking.
In my hotel, I heard someone say, "Oh, she has that
Scottish stubbornness, you know". A book review in a
newspaper used the phrase, "With true Gallic wit". At the
theatre that evening, during the interval, I caught part of a
conversation in which a pretty girl said to her escort, "I know
that all Americans have a 'line' " ; and in a mystery story
that I read before retiring, there was a reference to "typical
German thoroughness".
These are all instances of those "pictures in our heads"
to which Walter Lippman gave the name of stereotypes.
They are typical of the ease with which most of us generalize
about national or ethnic groups, usually without even stop¬
ping to think where such "information" comes from, and
whether it represents the truth, the whole truth, or anything
like the truth.
There are certainly very few, if any, among us who have
not succumbed to the temptation to stereotype nations. One
might almost describe the tendency as inevitable, or at least
very nearly so. We know that Englishmen are reserved, and
Irishmen pugnacious ; we have heard it all our lives ; be¬
sides most people agree with us. If we are asked, however,
how we know, we would not easily find a suitable answer.
One of the earliest careful studies of this tendency was
made by Katz and Braly, in 1932, in connexion with the
stereotypes held by Princeton University students. The
technique was simple.
Each student was given a list of traits, and a list of
nationalities ; from the first list he chose the five traits
which he regarded as characteristic of each national or
racial group.
The results showed a fair degree of unanimity, e. g. out of
100 students, 78 described the Germans as "scientifically
minded", and 65 described them as "industrious"; 53 students
used the adjective "artistic" for the Italians ; the same per¬
centage described the English as "sportsmanlike" ; 79 agreed
that the Jews were "shrewd" and 54 stated that the
Turks were "cruel"; 84 regarded Negroes as
erstitious", and 75 described them as "lazy".

W I s ted i m ages of nations
We may summarize the results in a
slightly different manner by indicating
the three or four characteristics most
commonly ascribed to each nationality.
These included, for the Germans: scien¬
tifically-minded, industrious, stolid ;
the Italians, impulsive, artistic, passion¬
ate ; Negroes, superstitious, lazy,
happy-go-lucky, ignorant ; the Irish,
pugnacious, quick-tempered, witty; the
English, sportsmanlike, intelligent, con¬
ventional ; the Jews, shrewd, mercen¬
ary, industrious ; the Americans, in¬
dustrious, intelligent, materialistic, am¬
bitious ; the Chinese, superstitious,
sly, conservative ; the Japanese, intelli¬
gent, industrious, progressive ; the
Turks, cruel, religious, treacherous.
A recent study of the stereotypes of
German students
at the Free Uni¬
versity of Berlin
by Sodhi and
Bergius showed a
similar willing¬
ness to stereotype
nations and, on
the whole, com¬
parable results.
Americans, for
example, were
described as
sportsmanlike,
democratic, ma¬
terialistic; the Italians as warmblooded,
musical, light-hearted; the Chinese as
poor, inscrutable, modest; the Germans
as conscious of duty, loving their
homeland, intelligent; the English as
proud of their nation, bound by tradi¬
tions, sportsmanlike. There were some
variations between the German and
the American stereotypes, but on the
whole the overlapping is considerable.
On a more extensive scale, a study
conducted in 9 countries under the aus¬
pices of Unesco in 1948 and 1949, show¬
ed that such stereotyped thinking
could easily be elicited almost any¬
where. In each country approximately
1,000 respondents, representing a cross-
section of the population, were given a
list of 12 traits, and asked to choose
those which they thought were most
applicable to themselves, to Americans,
to Russians, and in some cases, to two
or three other national groups as well.
They could choose as many of the
traits as they wished.
The British, for example, thought of
Americans as primarily progressive,
conceited, generous, peace-loving, in¬
telligent, practical. The Americans re¬
garded the British as intelligent, hard¬
working, brave, peace-loving, conceited
and self-controlled. The Norwegians
described the Russians as hardworking,
domineering, backward, brave, cruel
and practical. The full results can be
found in the volume by Buchanan and
Cantril, "How Nations See Each Other".
(1).
The "self-image" is also revealing.
The British saw themselves as peace-
loving, brave, hard-working, intelligent;
the French saw themselves as intelli¬
gent, peace-loving, generous, and brave;
the Americans saw themselves as peace-
loving, generous, intelligent and pro¬
gressive. All the groups agreed on one
item: their own nation was the most
peace-loving of all!
The most peace-
loving nation?

"Books for understanding other peoples".
Few people realize how much the
existence of stereotypes may colour our
relations with other people, even to the
extent of seeing them differently as a
result. Psychologists have long known
that our perceptions of the external
world, and particularly of human
beings, are determined not only by what
is out there , but also by what is in
ourselves. What we see is determined
in part by what we expect to see. If
we believe, for example, that Italians
are noisy, we will have a tendency to
notice those Italians who are indeed
noisy; if we are in the presence of some
who do not fit the stereotype, we may
not even realize that they, too, are Ita¬
lian. If someone points that fact out
to us and says: "Look, those people are
Italians, and they
are not noisy",
we can always
dismiss them as
exceptions.
Since there is
no limit to the
number of cases
that can be so
dismissed, we may
continue to cling
to the pictures in
our heads, in
spite of all the
facts to the con¬
trary. This does not always happen.
Stereotypes do sometimes change in
the light of new experience, and evi¬
dence for this is presented later. If we
have had them for a long time,
however, we surrender them with great
reluctance.
A number of significant investigations
have shown in a very dramatic manner
how our stereotypes may determine our
perceptions. Some years ago Allport
and Postman, psychologists at Harvard
University (Cambridge, USA) studied
some of the phe¬
nomena associat-
ed with the-
spread of ru¬
mours, making
use of a tech¬
nique known as
"serial reproduc¬
tion", a very sim¬
ple device which
anyone can use
with a group of
friends in his own
home. They
showed a picture
to one student, and he described to
a second student what he saw in the
picture. The second then told a third
what the first had told him; the third
told the fourth, and so on, through a
series of 8 to 10 reproductions. Then a
comparison was made between the final
result and the original presentation.
One of the pictures used in this
investigation showed a scene in a
subway in which, in addition to a
number of people seated, there were two
men standing, one a white man, the
other a Negro. The white man was
dressed in working clothes, with an
open razor stuck in his belt. It so
happens that the stereotype of the
Negro held by some people in the USA
includes the notion that Negroes carry
with them an open razor, of which they
make ready use in an argument.
The psychologists were able to de¬
monstrate that in half of the groups
The razor 'moves'
from the white
man to the Negro
who served as subjects in these experi¬
ments, before the end of the series of
reproductions had been reached, the
razor had "moved" from the white man
to the Negro. In some instances, the
Negrq was even represented as bran¬
dishing the razor violently in the face
of the white man. This does not mean
that half of the subjects in the experi¬
ment saw the Negro with the razor,
since if only one person in the chain
made this error, it would be repeated
by those that followed. Interestingly
enough, this did not occur when the
subjects were Negroes (who rejected the
stereotype), or young children (who
had not yet "learned" it).
Another study conducted by Razran
in New York points in the same direc¬
tion. A group of college students in
the USA were shown photographs of
30 girls, and asked to judge each pho¬
tograph on a 5-point scale, indicating
their general liking of the girl, her
beauty, her intelligence, her character,
her ambition, and her "entertaining-
ness". Two months later, the same
students were again shown the same
photographs, but with surnames added.
For some of the photographs Jewish
surnames were given, such as Rabino-
witz, Finkelstein, etc; a second group
received Italian names, such as Sca-
rano, Grisolia, etc; a third group
Irish surnames,, such as McGillicuddy,
O'Shaughnessy, etc; a fourth, "old
American" names like Adams and
Clark.
The investigator was able to demon¬
strate that the mere labelling of these
photographs with such surnames defi¬
nitely affected the manner in which
the girls were perceived. The addition
of Jewish and Italian names, for
example, resulted in a substantial drop
in general liking, and a similar drop for
judgments of beauty and character.
The addition' of
the same names
resulted in a rise
in the ratings for
ambition, parti¬
cularly marked in
the case of the.
Jewish surnames.
It seems clear
that the same
photographs Zoofc-
ed different just
because they
could now be as¬
sociated with the
stereotype held by these students.
If a great many, people agree that a
particular trait is associated with a
particular nation, does that make it
true? There is a fairly widespread
theory to the effect that "where there's
smoke there's Are"; or, in other words,
that the very existence of a stereotype
is, to some extent at least, an argument
in favour of its truth. Otherwise, the
argument runs, where does the stereo¬
type come from? How would it come
into existence?
There is, however, a good deal of
evidence as to the possibility that
stereotypes may develop without any
kernel of truth whatsoever. We all
know how widespread is the notion


that intelligent people have high fore¬
heads, yet scientific investigation in
this field has failed to reveal any such
relationship. The stereotype of the cri¬
minal as bearing in his features the

mark of his criminality is widely
accepted, but it is equally without foun¬
dation; the famous British criminolo¬
gist, Sir Charles Goring, was able to
demonstrate that a composite photo¬
graph, representing criminals in British
gaols, bore no resemblance to the ac¬
cepted stereotype of the criminal.
Stereotypes frequently change. In
some cases it may be argued that this
corresponds to a real change in the
characteristics of the people; in others,
however, it seems much more likely to
be due to external circumstances which
have little or nothing to do with the
group concerned. The Dutch sociolo¬
gist, Shrieke, has, for example, made a
collection of some of the descriptive
phrases applied to the Chinese during
the course of their residence in the
state of California, U.S.A.
When the Chinese were needed in
California, in order to carry on certain
types of occupation, they were welcome
there; during
that period,
newspapers and I
ioumthemerrä Richard :
among "the most
worthy of our
newly adopted ci¬
tizens"; "the best
immigrants i n
California";- they
were spoken of as
thrifty, sober,
tractable, inof¬
fensive law-abi¬
ding. This flat¬
tering picture prevailed over a consi¬
derable period of time, but around 1860,
presumably because economic competi¬
tion has grown much more severe, there
was a marked change in the stereotype
of the Chinese. The phrases now
applied to them included: "a distinct -
people", "unassimilable", "their pre¬
sence lowered the plane of living", etc.
They were spoken of .as clannish, cri¬
minal, debased, servile, deceitful, and
vicious.
This startling change can hardly be
.accounted for by any real modification
of the characteristics of the Chinese
population of California. The most
acceptable explanation is that when it
became advantageous to reduce the
competition from the Chinese, the
stereotype was altered ' in a direction
which would help to justify such action.
In this historical case it seems reason¬
able to conclude that the change in
the characteristics ascribed to the
Chinese throws doubt on the notion
that stereotypes must necessarily
contain some truth.
Another Dutch sociologist, Den Hol¬
lander, has studied the historical
changes in the stereotype of the
Hungarians in Europe. He points out
that for centuries after the migration
of Hungarians to Central Europe, they
had a bad reputation, and were regard¬
ed as culturally different, and therefore
inferior, to Europeans generally. Dur¬
ing the 15th and 16th centuries, how¬
ever, when they joined in the war
against the Turks, they were pictured
as a brave, devout, and chivalrous'
people.
By the second half of the 18th century
their popularity had again declined,
and they were described as savage,
lazy, egotistical, unreliable, and tyran¬
nous. This picture changed again a
little later, when the Hungarians be¬
came romanticized and idealized. Den
Hollander believes that the image fol¬
lowed the pattern of political inter-
Herman : Stupid
Cuthbert: Sissy
relationships; it seems unlikely that
there was sufficient transformation in
the character of the people to justify
the change in the national image.
One of the most amusing examples
of a stereotype which has apparently
developed without any kernel of truth
emerges from an investigation by
Schoenfeld on stereotypes associated
with proper names. Here again the
technique used was a simple one. The
American students who served as sub¬
jects in this study were given a list of
eight proper names, and a list of eight
adjectives; their task was to "match"
or pair each name with the adjective
regarded as most appropriate.
Since there were 120 students, and
eight names, the results to be expected
by chance alone, that is to say, if no
stereotype existed, would be 120 divid¬
ed by eight, or 15 for each name. The
actual results showed that 63 out of the
120 judges matched Richard with "good
looking"; 58 judg¬
ed Herman to be
"stupid"; 59
HnnHqomp judged Rex as
nUIIUbUlllt: "athletic"; 71 as
sociated Adrian
with "artistic";
and 104 agreed
that Cuthbert
was "a sissy". In
a similar experi¬
ment with Ame¬
rican girls judg¬
ing feminine
names, 54 re¬
garded Minnie as
stupid; 60 saw Linda as sophisticated;
69 said that Mary was religious; 58 that
Maisie was talkative; and 73 that Aga¬
tha was middle-aged.
Although this study was done with
American students, it seems quite cer¬
tain that comparable stereotypes would
be found in languages other than
English.
In any case, it can hardly be
argued that Ri¬
chard is really
better looking
than John, or JLA m m a
Herman more " I
stupid than
Cuthbert. To
return to ethnic
stereotypes, one
significant study
may be cited
which demon- jyt « »
strates the man- JVtOISie
ner in which
stereotypes may
-ievelop without
any basis in truth. The Ame¬
rican sociologist, La Piere, studied the
attitudes of residents of California
towards first and second generation
Armenian immigrants in Fresno County
in that State. There was almost com¬
plete agreement that these Armenians
had more than their share of faults,
and the general attitude toward them
was relatively unfriendly.
La Piere proceeded to question non-
Armenians as to the reasons for their
antipathies, and he was able to classify
the answers into three stereotypes. In
the first place, it was stated that Arme¬
nians were treacherous, lying, deceitful.
In actual fact, when measured by the
criterion of business integrity, the Ar¬
menian merchants turned out to be
equal and frequently superior to others.
In the second place, they were alleged
to be parasites, making excessive de¬
mands upon charitable organizations,
free clinics, etc. Actually, such de
mands by them were less than half of
what would be expected in terms of
their proportion of the population.
Finally, it was said that they had an
inferior code of morality, and they were
always getting into trouble with the
law. In fact, police records showed
that they appeared in only 1.5% of
Police Court cases, although they
constituted approximately 6% of the
population. La Piere concludes that
all of these stereotypes have one factor
in common, viz. that they are definitely
false. This does not mean that stereo¬
types never contain any truth. It does
mean that they can develop without
any truth whatsoever.
There is, however, the possibility that
a little truth may enter into a stereo¬
type through the back door, so to
speak. A Frenchman, with consider¬
able experience of international meet¬
ings, once said that when he had occa¬
sion to address such a meeting he
usually did so in a rather oratorical,
flowery, "Latin" style. He said that
otherwise his Anglo-Saxon colleagues
would be disappointed! When he was
with other Frenchmen, he reverted to
a quieter, more matter-of-fact, "un-
Latin" manner, which really suited him
personally much better.
In this case, the stereotype itself
determined his behaviour under certain
circumstances, and undoubtedly' rein¬
forced the conviction of the Anglo-
Saxons that they really knew what
Frenchmen were like. More rarely, the
stereotype may operate in reverse. A
member of a group with the reputation
for frugality, may go out of his way to
spend freely, and tip lavishly; if the
stereotype calls for lack of punctuality,
he may make it a point to arrive at his
destination well before the hour speci¬
fied. Since, in that case, as was indi¬
cated above, he will probably be re¬
garded as an exception, the stereotype
will still prevail.
Stereotyped thinking may be almost
inevitable, but
there is good evi¬
dence that it can
. C 4- i « r-v j-l at least be redu-
-JlUpiU ced, if not elimi
nated. Eighteen
years after the
Katz and Braly
study, another
psychologist (Gil¬
bert) applied the
T || ¿ I same technique
lalkatlVe to a new gene
ration of Prince¬
ton students. He
found that there
was some persistence of stereotypes,
but also a very important change
which he describes as "a fading effect".
There is much less agreement among
the students in 1950 than in 1932; any
specific trait is usually checked by a
much smaller proportion of students In
the later study. In 1932, for example,
84% of the students described the
Negroes as lazy; in 1950 the percentage
had dropped to 31. The description of
Italians as artistic drops from 83 to 28.
In London, a Unesco study conducted
by H.E.O. James and Cora Tenen,
showed how specific personal expe¬
riences might affect the nature and
content of stereotypes. (1) What they
did was to obtain from schoolchildren
their opinions of other ethnic groups,
particularly of African Negroes, and
then bring them into contact with two
able African women teachers ,r ,.

PICTURES IN OUR HEADS
(Continued)
The "before and after" picture is very
striking. As an example, a child before
the experience stated that "I do not
like black people; it's the colour; it
makes me nervous; they might be sa¬
vage... they are different in nature to
us, more savage and cruel sometimes,
so you don't trust them ever". The
same child after the- experience said:
"Miss V. and Miss W. were nice people-
there does not seem any difference
between them and us except the colour.
Ithink that Negroes are like thaWjust
like us, except for the colour. I like
them. They are nice people".
The authors give many examples of
f-ir-nilar changes that occurred. Stereo¬
types cannot always be modified so
¿ nor so fast, but the fact that
they can be changed at all as a result
of experience is itself encouraging.
Growing older helps
Sometimes just growing older helps.
In a study sponsored by Unesco,
Piaget and Weil report the results
of a series of interviews with Swiss
children of different ages. One inter¬
view with a little girl aged eight years
ran as follows:
"Have you heard of foreigners?
Yes, there are Germans and French.
Are there any differences between
these foreigners?Yes, the Ger¬
mans are bad, they are always
making war. The French are poor
and everything is dirty there.
Then I have heard of Russians, but
they are not at all nice^Do you
have any personal knowledge of
the French, German, or Russians,
or have you read something about
them?' No*Then how do you
know? Everyone says so."
On the other hand, a boy aged
thirteen years, after having mentioned
a large number of foreign countries of
which he had heard, was asked,
"Are there any differences between all
those countries?", and his answer was,
in part, "you find all types of people
evert/where". We are not all as "ma¬
ture" as this 13-year-old boy, but per¬
haps we can move in that direction.
Or is it possible that the Swiss are...?
Oh no! No stereotypes!
Peoples are different
The understanding of national char¬
acteristics represents an impor¬
tant task for all of us, and it is
certain that the following articles will
contribute to that end. The difficulties
in the way are great: nations are made
up of many different kinds of indivi¬
duals, and generalizations are danger¬
ous if they do not give adequate
consideration to the range of individual
variations.
An important first step will be taken
if we treat "the pictures in our heads"
with a strong dose of scepticism, and if
we keep our minds closed to stereotypes
and open only to facts. No one is
denying the existence of national char¬
acteristics.
A knowledge of them can aid our
understanding of people, as well as our
enjoyment of the varieties of behaviour
and personality that are found in dif¬
ferent parts of the world. We need to
make sure, however, that the "pictures
in our heads" correspond as closely as
possible to reality.
