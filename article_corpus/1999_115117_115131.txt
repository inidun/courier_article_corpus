A new deal for the poor
Madagascar has a long
tradition of village solidarity.



In the uplands of northern Madagascar, the villagers
of Ambingivato shaped their community’s future with their own hands.
But this kind of collective action is fading fast
Madagascar: a waning tradition
n
A m b i n gi vat o,a village with a hundred or so inha-
b i t a n t s , is five hours ’ walk from A m b a r a r at a ,t h e
nearest town accessible by ve h i c l e . For the past
20 ye a rs it has had a hospital and a school which serve
four neighbouring villages.This sounds a bit gr a n d ,a s
the hospital is just a couple of big whitewashed rooms,
one of them a mat e rnity ward and the other for recei-
ving pat i e n t s.The school consists of two huts built of
t a n i m a n ga ( c l ay ) ,each with four rooms in which chil-
dren of different ages and educational levels mix.
But makeshift though it is, the hospital has meant
t h at mothers-to-be no longer have to suffer the ordeal
of bumping along all the way to A m b a r a r ata in a cart
d r awn by two oxe n .The school is equally modest bu t
it provides an education for the local children.
Both were built by local fa rm e rs themselves follo-
wing a decision by the fo k o n o l o n a,a kind of community
assembly and a political institution dating from pre-colo-
nial times. A ny project initiated by the fo k o n o l o n a
becomes a public facility and is respected as such.
To the Malagasy, the term conjures up a picture
of solemn meetings at which the community gat h e rs
to decide its future. One of its regular functions, f o r
e x a m p l e , is clearing roads after the heavy December
and Ja n u a ry rains. Each year at this season, A m b i n-
givato is cut off from the other villages by godram-
potaka, the very thick grey mud that is typical of
Madagascar’s rural areas, and its people are pre-
vented from exporting rice and coffee via A m b a r a-
rata to Befandriana Avaratra.The menfolk set to
work with shovels to clear the blocked roads.
U n aware of new concepts of “community deve-
l o p m e n t ” and “local part i c i p at i o n ” and well before
We s t e rn NGOs arri ved in Madagascar,A m b i n gi vat o ’s
fo k o n o l o n a was thinking about how to improve local
conditions without calling on any outside help. To
build their school and hospital,the villagers divided up
the work among themselve s.The children went dow n
to the Anjingo River to gather rocks, the men broke
them into small pieces to use as foundation mat e rial and
men and women together hauled earth which wa s
m i xed with rice straw to make big bricks for the wa l l s.
To raise funds in an economy where cash is
little used, the fokonolona held fairs and organized
h o t e l y—small inns where women served ri c e , ox
meat and poultry to the people from surrounding
villages, who would buy tickets for the occasion in
a d va n c e . At the fa i rs , where 1970s music was playe d
on old gramophone records, the young and not-so-
young came to eat ,h ave a good time and spend a bit
of money.The cash raised went to buy things like the
h o s p i t a l ’s expensive corru g ated iron roof and to
build one of the school’s two huts.
The other part of the school still has a that-
ched roof. N ow, after many ye a rs , it is time to
replace it with corrugated iron and mend the mud
walls weatherbeaten by gale-force winds sweeping
in from the Indian Ocean every year.
But the A m b i n gi vato fo k o n o l o n a is no longer so
energetic and is less enthusiastic about the school
than it once wa s.The fall in coffee prices in the last 20
ye a rs , the death of elders who handed down cus-
t o m s , the exodus of young people and the lack of local
prospects may help to explain why all the A m b i n gi vat o
fo k o n o l o n a does these days is clear the roads.T i m e s
h ave changed. In recent ye a rs , m a ny non-gove rn-
mental organizations have been busy in Madagascar.
They bypass the fo k o n o l o n a, and do eve rything from
p r oviding water supplies to refurbishing schools.T h e
projects are useful and local people take part in them.
But the initiat i ve comes from the outside. Instead of
taking their own decisions and doing the job them-
s e l ve s , people are now content to wait for others to do
it for them. n
