W h e re drug fir m s
fear to tre a d
Access to medicines in poor countries has become a critical issue with the spread
of AIDS and re-emergence of illnesses once thought to have been beaten. Can
the profit-driven pharmaceutical industry offer any kind of response?
here is a little, forgotten disease afoot,
and a third of Faustino To r r i c o ’s
neighbours are infected. As a medical
professor in the local university of
C o c h a b a m b a ,B o l i v i a ,he would like to do
more to help the affli c t e d , but the vicious
blood-sucking bug that hosts Chagas
disease has one insuperable defence
against the world’s health industry.
Trypanosoma cruzi likes its insect carriers
to live in mud walls and roofs—it likes to
feed on the poor.
As Torrico knows only too well, the
numbers do not add up. He knows of
some pills that could help the
450,000 infected people in his region—
many of whom will see their hearts and
guts irreparably perforated by the
parasite—but they cost a dollar a go.
That makes $90 million to treat Cocha-
bamba alone, about 84 million more than
his entire country’s six-year budget for
treating Chagas disease.
The portents of such immense
shortfalls are well known to the
developing world’s health profession.
For the 23 million AIDS victims in sub-
Saharan A f r i c a , they point to absent
t r e a t m e n t ,semi-legal scrambles for cheap
pills and almost inevitable death.S i m i l a r
tales can be told of malaria and
t u b e r c u l o s i s.Yet these are the “big three”
d i s e a s e s : major world scourges, all of
which (now including malaria) have at
least a foothold in the rich nations and a
claim on global attention.For Chagas in
B o l i v i a , yellow fever in Guinea and
sleeping sickness in Uganda, the pockets
of exotically named illnesses are
ringfenced by silence.
As for drugs,what there is tends to be
e x p e n s i v e, ineffective or both.One recent
study for the World Health Organization
(WHO) revealed that between 1975 and
1 9 9 7 ,1 , 2 3 3 new chemical treatments were
put on the market.Only 11 were for what
are known as “tropical diseases.” O v e r
half of those were initially designed for
animals.
“If you look over the last 20 y e a r, t h e
share of developing countries in the
w o r l d ’s pharmaceutical consumption has
actually dropped from a quarter to
2 0 p e r c e n t . So in essence we have
7 5 percent of the world’s population
consuming only about 20 percent of the
w o r l d ’s drugs in terms of value,” e x p l a i n s
Jonathan Quick, head of the W H O ’s
essential medicines division.
The frantic search
for market winners
Bridging this fracture between
medical need and medical supply has
become an urgent issue, pushed to the
forefront of politicians’ minds by the
ravages of AIDS on the A f r i c a n
subcontinent and discussed at the G-8
table in Okinawa last July. Quite simply,
the market-driven behaviour of the
pharmaceutical industry seems to afford
little space for the health needs of those
too poor to buy pricey new drugs. Th e
scale of the challenge is to bring profit and
poverty together.
It is a task made that much harder by
the fragmented nature of modern health.
For previous generations, the most
devastating infectious diseases—
t u b e r c u l o s i s, s m a l l p o x , syphilis and
polio—spanned the globe, paying little
heed to geography or wealth. N o w,
h o w e v e r, rich and poor illnesses are
clearly divisible. What kills in the west
are chronic ailments such as heart disease,
cancer and strokes. Poverty and poor
healthcare, in contrast,have proved just
the right environment for the emergence
of new resistant strains in old pestilence.
Over 70 percent of malaria sufferers in
Sierra Leone, to take just one of many
c a s e s, enjoy no benefit from the old
chloroquine prescription. Fo r
pharmaceutical companies, it is a sad fact
that does little to interfere with market
strategy.
From modest beginnings in the
penicillin trade that followed the end of
World War II, the industry has changed
beyond recognition.Annual research and
development in the sector now stands at
$40 billion, overshadowing the work of
In Burkina Faso, a young boy leads

public laboratories which in turn jostle to
match the industry’s priorities. Impelled
by a string of mergers and acquisitions, a
pack of multi-billion dollar corporations
currently dominates, all of them
frantically searching to please
s h a r e h o l d e r s, avoid takeover and find the
holy grail—the drug that can net a billion
dollars in sales a year until its 20-year
patent expires.
Given the scale of their investments
(an estimated $500 million per new drug),
potential sales are clearly the key to
choosing a field for research.According to
Herman Mucke, a Vi e n n a - b a s e d
independent analyst of the industry, the
craze of the moment is the central
nervous system—the weak link in old
p e o p l e ’s bodies,and thus a market winner
in ageing Europe.“ L i f e s t y l e ” drugs have
also boomed since Pfizer unleashed
Vi a g r a .The sinking of considerable funds
and talent has produced alluring new
treatments for weight loss, face wrinkles
and separation anxiety in pet animals.
Tired of depending on stubborn health
authorities and doctors’ prescriptions,
the firms are even aiming straight at
consumer desire in the style of a chain
store. For the first ever time, a television
advertisement was shown in Britain in
1999 “ r e c o m m e n d i n g ” a visit to the doctor
for sufferers of incontinence.Why? Heard
of Pharmacia & Upjohn’s new drug?
“ Th e r e ’s no disputing that one old,
f a t , b a l d , fungus-ridden rich man who
can’t get it up counts for more than half
a billion people who are vulnerable to
m a l a r i a ,” intoned an article on the
industry in the left-wing U.S. magazine
The Nation.
Yet as the pharmaceutical industry is
careful to argue, such criticisms mistake
moral fury for fair assessment. Th e
i n d u s t r y, after all, is in the private sector—
from where it must attract consumers and
recoup investment. For shareholders, t h e r e
is no more reason for it to serve pills to the
poor than for banks to hand out cash to the
destitute or supermarkets to disburse food
to the hungry.“Some individuals in various
firms might be far-looking enough, b u t
you know how these companies work:
they have thousands of shareholders who
tell the director that the only thing to
worry about are profits and dividends.
When those two drop, they are pensioned
off and that’s it,” says Mucke.
In spite of such pressure, s e v e r a l
companies have still co-operated in major
public health ventures. The U. S. f i r m
Merck, for instance, donated 65 million
doses of the drug ivermectin over a
decade, a vital part in largely successful
efforts to eradicate river blindness disease
in A f r i c a . Several firms have also pledged
to continue production of drugs to
counter sleeping sickness.
But few health activists have any
illusions about the firms’ warmth of heart.
“ The logic of the pharmaceutical industry
is not the logic of social action,” s t a t e s
Jean-Marie Kindermans from Médecins
Sans Fr o n t i è r e s. In response, his globally
respected organization has begun to fig h t
for immediate measures to get existing
drugs into the hands of those too poor to
afford them.
Charitable agreements
and generic drugs
A prime target are the people infected
with HIV and AIDS in A f r i c a . P e t e r
L a n g i , a leading health official from
Uganda (820,000 infected out of a
population of 21 m i l l i o n ) , admits that
“access to HIV drugs is minimal and they
are very expensive.The medicine is only
available from a few hospitals in the
capital.”All five leading pharmaceutical
firms agreed last May to cut the prices on
AIDS drugs for Africa by 80 p e r c e n t .
Langi explains that in Uganda’s case a
deal has just been struck to bring the
price of the triple therapy antiretrovirals
down to $140 a month. The only snag is
that his government’s health budget
stands at $12 per person per year.
For Médecins Sans Fr o n t i è r e s, t h e
message is clear: gentlemanly deals with
the pharmaceutical firms are not enough.
In the opinion of many public health
a c t i v i s t s, the firms are acting for the same
strategic reasons that motivated their $20-
million donation to the U. S. p r e s i d e n t i a l
election campaigns. Cut prices and
g i v e a w a y s, most recently seen in Pfiz e r ’s
pledge to hand South Africa free
fluconazole (a cure for cryptococcal
m e n i n g i t i s, the frequent result of A I D S
i n f e c t i o n ) , certainly look good on press
r e l e a s e s. But generic versions of these

same drugs are currently being
manufactured by upstart firms in Brazil,
I n d i a ,Thailand and A r g e n t i n a ,s o m e t i m e s
at less than a fortieth of the big fir m s ’
p r i c e s.Could it be that the giants’ charity
is just a ploy to win plaudits, q u a s h
c o m p e t i t i o n , and preserve their rights to
worldwide patent protection (see box)?
“ The solution for AIDS is not to have
five big donors reducing their prices—
we need pressure for a political
a g r e e m e n t ,not a charitable one,”d e c l a r e s
K i n d e r m a n s. Encouragement of cheap
g e n e r i c s, relaxation of patent restrictions
and differential pricing of medicines in
poor and rich countries have all been
pinpointed as critical steps. The goal is
to bring the pharmaceutical industry to
heel—to remind it that health, t h e
condition for human life, can never be
just another market.
Incentives to boost
invention
B u t , as the WHO hastens to add,
confrontation is not a solution. In the case
of AIDS and patented drugs, says Quick,
“we need change on all sides,” i n c l u d i n g
b u s i n e s s, politics and also consumers in
rich countries, who may have to shoulder
higher prices even though their pills are
being transformed into just one more
c o m m o d i t y. As for tuberculosis, m a l a r i a
and those forgotten tropical diseases,
grindingly slow research partnerships
between public and private sectors still
seem the only option. One major global
malaria initiative,for example, envisages a
new drug rolling off the production line in
five years at a mere $150 m i l l i o n ;i n d u s t r y
has promised assistance “in kind.” A n d
though several drugs to combat sleeping
sickness are now being donated, one of
the most promising patents, that for
e flo r n i t h i n e, is stuck like a limpet to the
W H O ’s hands: no firm has yet agreed to
risk the combustible production process.
The giant pharmaceuticals,
meanwhile, are digging in.At the centre
of their concern is the patent system—the
axle of the entire industry. Scrap that or
tinker with it, as more radical health
activists demand, and firms risk terminal
demise.
I n s t e a d , a defence has been mounted:
developing countries are hampered more
by bad healthcare than lack of pills.And if
flourishing drugs firms are needed in poor
c o u n t r i e s, says Viren Mehta, head of the
New York-based pharmaceutical analysts
Mehta Partners, then strong patents and a
dose of public funds are essential. “ Th e
pharmaceutical industry is at an infle c t i o n
p o i n t . The new tool of biotechnology
makes the future very exciting: it allows us
to move beyond trial and error, start with
a clean slate and begin to do fundamental
research into the mechanisms of nature,”
he argues. “If we look at it over two
g e n e r a t i o n s, what is needed are solutions
that can be distributed in a cost-effective
w a y. What we need from this science is a
pill that can cure malaria in a safe, e f f e c t i v e
m a n n e r, a pill that can clean water, a pill
that can make crops grow.
“If the results are protected for a short
time in the private sector, it is a
s u f ficiently attractive carrot which allows
them to be widely available a generation
l a t e r. But human nature being as it is, it is
somehow not able to muster the power,
energy and creativity when there is no
r e t u r n ,” adds Mehta.The industry agrees:
the way to beat market failure is through
more markets. With the new patent
r e g i m e, they say, a genuine research
industry has taken root in Mexico and
B r a z i l . Even some of India’s 28,000
copycat firms have turned to invention.
In terms of the incentives to
i n v e n t i o n ,Mehta is almost certainly right.
But so long as the good works of the
pharmaceutical industry are an
afterthought of revenue, the incentives to
clear the parasites from Cochabamba’s
roofs may well stay off sick. ■
