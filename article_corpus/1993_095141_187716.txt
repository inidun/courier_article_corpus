" "nesco regards the environment
as one of its top priorities, and
by virtue of its four fields of
competence education, sci-
v ence, culture and communi¬
cation it is involved in environ¬
mental issues on a wide range of
fronts.
"Unesco started doing in-depth
work in the aftermath of the major
United Nations Conference on the
Environment held in Stockholm in
1972," says Victor Kolybine, who is
in charge of the Organization's activ¬
ities in environmental education.
"In collaboration with the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP), we launched an interna¬
tional programme on environ¬
mental education in which the con¬
cept of the natural environment was
widened to include socio-economic
and cultural dimensions. A key idea
was that environmental protection
is compatible with ecologically
sound development."
Today Unesco and UNEP are still
using a wide range of methods to
improve awareness of environ¬
mental issues. Twenty-seven young
people from various northern and
southern countries have designed
and illustrated a version ofAgenda

year's UN Conference on Environ¬
ment and Development, adapted
for 7- to 12-year olds. The book,
entitled Rescue Mission: Planet
Earth, will be published at the end
of the year by Kingfisher (UK).
Another innovative project is being
planned by the International
Humour Centre in Granada, Spain,
which in April 1994 will publish a
book of cartoons by famous artists
and informative texts in Spanish,
English and French.
To promote better under¬
standing of the the complex inter¬
relationships between human activ¬
ities and the environment, Unesco
makes a point ofbreaking down the
barriers between its various fields of
activity, with the social sciences
joining forces with the exact sci¬
ences and economics. University
chairs in sustainable development
will be established to provide mul-

tidisciplinary education. Pro¬
gramme specialist Christine von
Furstenberg explains: "Training
nothing but overspecialized experts,
as is done everywhere today, pre¬
vents the co-operation between
researchers and practitioners that is
vital in many disciplines."
This pioneering multidiscipli-
nary approach is intended not only
for those with specialized qualifi¬
cations in the exact, natural and
social sciences but also for deci¬
sion-makers, civil servants, engi¬
neers, journalists and the interested
public. The holder of a Unesco chair
co-ordinates the teaching of sev¬
eral colleagues from different dis¬
ciplines, and offers sixteen courses
leading to a degree. Outlets include
national, international and non¬
governmental organizations. The
first chairs already exist. One is in
Granada (Spain), another in
Quebec, and a third is shared
between two universities in Aus¬
tralia and Thailand.
Since 1971 Unesco's "Man and
the Biosphere" (MAB) programme
has been an outstanding tool for
understanding and protecting ter¬
restrial ecosystems. Its purpose is
to study the impact ofhuman activ¬
ities on the biosphere and the
means that can be employed to pre¬
vent further damage. MAB has
established an international net¬
work of 300 "biosphere reserves"
covering a total of 164 million
hectares in 75 countries.
The reserves are not static, unpop¬
ulated ecological museums. They
have been created to conserve and
monitor representative samples of
the planet's major natural and semi-
natural ecosystems, offer research
opportunities and ensure that local
people benefit from the resources of
their area without exhausting them.
Examples include the Maya forest
reserve in Guatemala, the Central
Californian coast reserve in the
United States a complex terrestrial
and marine environment and the
National Park of Tassili N'Ajjer in
Algeria, which is famous for its cave
paintings.
Each reserve has a protected
"core" area which is surrounded by
a buffer zone. However, this system
of protection is only effective if the
government of the country in which
the reserve is located has the polit¬
ical will to respect it. In Africa
recently an oil company was given
permission to carry out extensive
drilling operations in a reserve,
wiping out conservation efforts.
Other, less well-known environ¬
mental programmes include
"Diversitas", which studies terres¬
trial and marine biodiversity, and
"People and Plants", which was
launched jointly with the World¬
wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and
the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew

(UK) to promote the sustainable
and equitable use ofplant resources
by providing support to ethnob-
otanists from developing countries.
Nature can provide a cornucopia of
medicines for those who know how
to use it.
For over a year local people have
been helping ethnobotanists, forest
managers and traditional practi¬
tioners conduct an inventory of
plant life in particularly rich ecosys¬
tems in the Caribbean, Madagascar,
Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Cameroon
and Uganda. In Kinabalu Park,
Sabah (Malaysia) a three-year pro¬
gramme is cataloguing the many
uses of palm trees and medicinal
plants. A detailed manual describing
the plants and their chemical com¬
position, medicinal or toxic prop¬
erties and uses will be published.
The objective is to make traditional
plant resources, which poor and iso¬
lated populations rely on for most or
all of their medicine, available to the
greatest number of people.
The Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission (IOC) works
on a completely different scale. It
participates in international climate
and ocean observation research
programmes aimed at forecasting
natural disasters such as floods,
cyclones and tsunamis (seismic sea-
waves).
Unesco is also concerned with
the sustainable management of
coastal areas threatened by urban¬
ization, pollution, the spread of
tourism and transport systems and
the destruction of mangroves and
coral reefs. "Insula" and "Archipel"
are two programmes exclusively
concerned with promoting sus¬
tainable development of islands.
Their aim is to piece together a vast
network, which is already begin¬
ning to take shape between Oues-
sant (France), Estonia, Majorca
(Spain) and the Bijagos Islands
(Guinea-Bissau). The programme,
based on sharing experience and
solutions, has aroused interest in
the United States, Guadeloupe and
Finland, which are considering
taking part in it.
Insularity is also a concern of
Unesco's International Hydrolog¬
ical Programme (IHP), which seeks
to rationalize fresh water use and
management on tropical islands.
IHP's wide-ranging mandate
includes evaluating the link
between climatic change and water
resources and helping Member
States, especially those in arid or
semi-arid zones, to study the water
cycle and improve the management
of water resources degraded by
human activity.
This is only a selection of
Unesco's many environmental
activities. A forthcoming Green¬
watch will take a further look at the
Organization's work in this field.
