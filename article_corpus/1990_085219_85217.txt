THE GREAT WALL
OF MEDIEVAL PARIS

lou can buy no postcards of it.
There are no organized tours to visit
it. Guidebooks are far from loqua¬
cious about it. And no signposts will
lead you along its path. Yet there it
is, numerous vestiges of it at any rate,
many in plain sight of the tens of
thousands of Parisians who pass by
some part of it each day without
knowing what they are seeing
perhaps without even really seeing it.
What is it? Quite simply the
formidable wall built around Paris
from 1190 on the orders of Philip
Augustus, one of the great Capetian
kings of medieval France (reigned
1 179-1223). The rampart's 800th an¬
niversary this year is perhaps a chance
to pierce its undeserved anonymity.
The wall was intended to defend
what had recently become the French
capital against the Anglo-Norman ar¬
mies entrenched a few kilometres
down the Seine, when Philip left for
the Third Crusade to the Holy Land
with Richard the Lionheart in 1191.
That Richard was king of England
only goes to show that alliances were
no simpler then than now.
Today the remains of Philip's wall
enclose an oval space of some 253
hectares which at the time of its con¬
struction was occupied by around
100,000 people, indeterminate
amounts of livestock and countryside
expansive enough to be commemo¬
rated in still-surviving place-names.
There is some disagreement
among archaeologists as to certain of
the rampart's measurements, but de¬
pending on the differing strategic
needs of various parts of the
perimeter it appears that it was 6 to
9 metres high and 2.6 to 2.8 metres
thick at its base, tapering at the top,
along which ran a walkway for look¬
outs and archers. Along the right
(north) bank of the Seine the rampart
was built largely at local merchants'
expense to protect the commerce
that was beginning to thrive in the
relatively peaceful conditions afford¬
ed by the Capetian central
government.
No such source of funds was to
be found on the left bank. Although
there were wealthy monasteries and
other religious establishments, they
had their own fortifications. The
south side of the city was shared by
farmers and the usually penniless stu¬
dents of what became known as the
Latin Quarter because of the com¬
mon language of its plurinational
population. So the king paid for the
wall on the south bank. This was
probably not a gesture of selfless
generosity, but rather seems to have
been a calculated political and psy¬
chological tactic in his struggle
against the still-powerful and still-
numerous feudal lords, over whom
he exercised only indirect control to
which they submitted grudgingly at
best.
In addition to fortified gates at
the entry and exit points of the main
east-west and north-south thorough¬
fares, the wall was punctuated by a
semicircular tower some 6 metres in
diameter every 60 metres or so. Why
this distance? Probably so that bow¬
men on adjacent towers could con¬
trol the span of wall separating them,
as it has been shown that the maxi¬
mum effective range of a crossbow
is about 30 metres.
Unlike fortifications built on
Philip's orders at other cities, the Paris
wall had no moat. A moat was even¬
tually built, a century and a half later,
when during the Hundred Years' War
between England and France Charles
V refurbished the capital's defences
in a project that also included the
construction of the Bastille.

Another reason for the construc¬
tion of the wall may have been the
king's passion for enhancing the in¬
frastructure of French society at a
time when it was emerging from the
more anarchic earlier medieval peri¬
od. During Philip's reign and largely
at his initiative, a flurry of urban con¬
struction was carried out that was
truly worthy of a rising national
capital.
For the first time since the Ro¬
man occupation of Gaul, the main
streets of Paris were paved. The Hôtel
Dieu hospital, which still operates
near its original location, was built.
So was a central enclosed market,
with doors that could be locked at
night, which partly replaced the
peripatetic fairs then common and
put business on a daily rather than
a seasonal basis. Known as Les Halles,
this market was not moved from its
original site to the city outskirts until
the 1970s. Work on Notre Dame
cathedral, begun under Philip's father
Louis VII, proceeded apace, and the
fortress on whose site the Louvre
now stands was built.
Philip's lifelong ambition seems
to have been to forge a powerful cen¬
tral monarchy that directly controlled
an ever-expanding territory. If not yet
a nation, France was already begin¬
ning to assume the substance and
trappings of a state.
The Church was a potential ally
against Philip's enemies, but he had
alienated Rome (for example he had
had his second marriage annulled to
free him for a third) to such an ex¬
tent that he and France were excom¬
municated for a while. This was a very
grave measure, in his subjects' eyes
at least. There remained as a possi¬
ble counterweight to feudal power
the small but steadily growing urban
populations and in particular their
merchant élites.
Philip was not unfailingly solici¬
tous to the nascent bourgeoisie, yet
he often treated it as an ally. On
departing for the Crusades, for exam¬
ple, he broke with tradition and en¬
trusted the keys of the royal treasury
to seven townspeople. He also grant¬
ed charters to guilds of butchers and
drapers and favoured the ascendan¬
cy of the watermen's guild. The
watermen were of vital importance
to ensure Parisian control over trans¬
port of goods into and out of the city
through a network of major rivers
the Marne, Oise and Yonne as well
as the Seine. This move was all the
more astute as at that time land
transport in France was so antiquat¬
ed that it still depended in some
places on the remains of the roads
abandoned by the Romans.
The wall thus may be interpret¬
ed as a political and psychological as
well as a military statement, saying
in effect that "feudalism stops here,
and here begins a qualitatively new
kind of lifeurban life". The city had
begun to offer refuge, anonymity, al¬
ternatives and at least a degree of
freedom unknown in the lords'
domainsa runaway serf who
managed to enter the city and stay
there uncaught for a specified peri¬
od (such as a year and a day) became
a free man.
A glance at a map of Paris will
show how the French capital has
grown in concentric ovals out from
its twelfth-century perimeter wall, the
6 to 9 metres of stone which pro¬
claimed "the city begins here".
