THE RUINS
OF
NEMRUD DAGH

Ur-
Twenty centuries ago, Antiochus I, King of
Commagene raised a mighty monument to him¬
self and his gods atop Nemrud Dagh (Mount
Nimrod) in the Anti-Taurus Mountains of present-
day Turkey. Hewn from the mountain rock, the
sanctuary consists of three terraces levelled on
the summit and decorated with giant statues
of Antiochus and the deities worshipped by his
Greek and Persian ancestors. Above the ter¬
races rises a great tumulus of rock chippings
which archaeologists believe may hide the tomb
of Antiochus, but so far this rocky cairn has
defied exploration. The colossal statues guard¬
ing the secret of this Anatolian king still stand,
but most have been decapitated. Left, fallen
heads of deities litter the west terrace of
Nimrud Dagh. Though now shattered by earth¬
quakes, erosion and vandalism, the deities still
seem marvels of engineering skill. Upon their
platform, they rose as high as a five-storey
building. Above, heads of Herakles (on left) and
Zeus (right) are twice the height of a man.
Above left, bearded Herakles (foreground) and
handsome Apollo resemble giants buried to the
neck in the rocky soil.
