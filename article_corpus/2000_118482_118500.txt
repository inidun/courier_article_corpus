G a n d h i ’s disputed heritage
w Darryl D’Monte
The leadership of an Indian farmers’ movement against transgenic crops says it embodies
Gandhian principles but critics wonder whether it is being manipulated
In December 1998, Indian farmers burn cotton plants that had been genetically modified using knowhow provided 
by the U.S. multinational Monsanto.
In December 1998, when fa rm e rs in the south
Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Karn at a k a
torched cotton plants bred with know h ow pro-
vided by the U. S . chemical multinational Mon-
s a n t o, their activism was cited intern ationally as an
example of grassroots Third World opposition to
genetically modified organisms (GMOs). T h e i r
action against the plants, which were being tested
for their resistance to pests, won particular note
from Rural A d vancement Fo u n d ation Intern at i o-
nal (RAFI), which has been at the forefront of the
worldwide movement against GMOs and coined
the term “ Te rm i n ator Te c h n o l o g y ” .
The fa rm e rs belonged to the Karn ataka Rajya
Raitha Sangh (KRRS), a movement that regards
the spread of transgenic breeds as “a new imperi a-
list assault” on the Third Wo r l d .To d ay the KRRS
claims to have 10 million members in Karn at a k a ,
whose total population is 60 million.
This was not the first time that the KRRS had
taken direct action against a multinational seed
bu s i n e s s. In 1992, for example, its members occu-
pied and ransacked the offices of the giant U. S .s e e d
c o m p a ny Cargi l l , in Bangalore, the state capital,
and its administrat i ve building in Bellary.
The KRRS was formed in 1980. Its founding
p r e s i d e n t , Prof M.D. N a n j u n d a swa my, told the
C o u rier that at first “the fa rm e rs tackled conve n-
tional gri e vances like debts, a gricultural prices and
d i s c ri m i n at o ry taxe s.Within a ye a r ,h owe ve r ,t h e y
had spontaneously developed a comprehensive
ideology to address issues raised by Green Revo-
lution technology.”
D. S .K a l m at , a fa rmer from Sindhanoor, a vil-
lage in Karn at a k a ’s Raichur distri c t , where Mon-
s a n t o ’s GM cotton was tried out on a tiny quart e r -
acre plot, d e s c ribed for the Courier some of the
e vents leading up to a crop-bu rning operat i o n .
Outflanking traditional 
political parties
“ We had read many articles against genetical-
ly modified va ri e t i e s ,” he said. “Prof Nanjun-
d a swa my telephoned me in December 1998 to fin d
out where the trial was being conducted.We dis-
c overed that the seeds had been provided by an
Indian company.The gove rn m e n t ’s A gri c u l t u r e
D e p a rtment had no inform ation about the tri a l ,
and the fa rmer himself had no idea of its implica-
t i o n s. He was willing to co-operate with us till the
B h a r at i ya Kisan Sangh [a movement affil i ated to
the party heading India’s coalition gove rn m e n t ] ,
asked him to resist any action by our organizat i o n .
Then Prof Nanjundaswa my arri ved with two acti-

vists from Spain and Germ a ny and we bu rned the
c r o p.”
K a l m at was one of 400 fa rm e rs , half of them
from Karn at a k a , who in May 1999 went on a
month-long trip to Europe organized by the KRRS
to press their case.“An Intern ational Caravan tra-
velled through Europe and was in Cologne to pro-
test at the European Union Summit and the G8
c o n f e r e n c e ,” s ays Nanjundaswa my.
Opposition environmental movements like the
KRRS have often outflanked India’s traditional
political part i e s. For example, no party in any
Indian state has come out openly either for or
against GMOs.The mainstream parties have exces-
s i vely ri gid structures and rely on their own fa r-
m e rs ’o r g a n i z at i o n s , which are reluctant to launch
spontaneous actions and wait for diktats from the
central party leaders h i p,often based in New Delhi.
N o n - p a rty mass movements like the KRRS
h ave often shown up the shortcomings of the
c o nventional political system and its inability to
comprehend the linkages between economic libe-
r a l i z ation and threats to freedoms on many fronts.
Such groupings are much looser, i d e o l o gically and
s t ru c t u r a l l y, than traditional classic parties and
d r aw their support from an assortment of fa rm e rs ,
urban activists, academics and sometimes inter-
n ational environmental NGOs.
One reason why a mass movement against
GMOs has risen in India, a country where 750 mil-
lion out of the total population of one billion live
in the country s i d e , is that it is easy to whip up pas-
sions against technologies that are reminiscent of
the oppressive rule of British colonialists.
N a n j u n d a swa my says his movement is “ b a s e d
on Gandhian ideology.” M a h atma Gandhi saw the
Indian village as a keystone in his non-violent 
s t ruggle against British domination in the first half
of the 20th century.
“In the Indian village,” Gandhi wrote,“an age-
old culture is hidden under an encasement of cru-
d e n e s s.Take away the encru s t at i o n ,r e m ove the vil-
l a g e r ’s chronic pove rty and illiteracy and you will
find the finest specimen of what a cultured,
c u l t i vat e d , free citizen should be.”
The Gandhian lineage of the KRRS’s ideas has
also been stressed by a famous Indian env i r o n-
m e n t a l i s t ,Vandana Shiva , who has gi ven the move-
ment much of its intellectual ri g o u r.
For Shiva , non-violence means that “ we live
e c o l o gically and at peace with all species. In India,
the Earth community has never been seen to be
d o m i n ated by humans. A species are part of Va s u d-
h a i va Ku t u m b h a k a m, the Earth fa m i l y. L e av i n g
space for others is a measure of non-
v i o l e n c e . . . . Genuine non-violence and democra-
cy call for pluralistic coalitions and multiple res-
p o n s e s , r ather than monopolization and manipu-
l ation of move m e n t s.The horizon for activism is
ve ry wide.”
H owe ve r , KRRS violence in destroying GM
crops and the offices of multinationals has been cri-
ticized by hard-core Gandhians who emphasize
t h at means are as important as ends. N a n j u n-
d a swa my defended KRRS actions against this accu-
s ation when he told the C o u ri e r t h at “It is similar to
bu rning British goods during the freedom stru g g l e .
D u ring the Quit India movement against the Bri-
t i s h , Gandhi was asked whether bu rning cargo
trains constituted violence and he said it didn’t ,
unlike passenger trains.”
Rhetoric  and symbolism
C ritics are also sceptical about the KRRS’s 
credentials as a mass move m e n t .They say it is res-
t ricted to a few agi t ating fa rm e rs and to their urban
l e a d e rs h i p, which seeks support from the media
and the courts rather than organizing action by eve n
r e l at i vely small numbers of fa rm e rs who tend to be
among the better-off, with larger holdings.T h e y
also point out that the KRRS has a traditional hie-
rarchical stru c t u r e , with a President, t wo General
S e c r e t a ries and a Treasurer in Bangalore, and that
it is dominated by its founder, who is said to beha-
ve autocrat i c a l l y.They also maintain that the com-
plexities of GM crops are in any case usually beyo n d
the comprehension of the peasant.They point out
t h at Monsanto spokespersons in India cite other
Indian fa rm e rs ’ o r g a n i z ations which have enthu-
siastically supported the introduction of GMOs.
As for last ye a r ’s European tri p, the KRRS lea-
d e rship emphasized that the fa rm e rs paid their ow n
air fa r e s , though it is hard to imagine poor peasants
being able to do this. Obviously these were com-
f o rtably placed fa rm e rs , although Kalmat , w h o
owns just 6 acres, denies there are any of these in
K a rn ataka because of land reform s.
On the whole the media have been support i ve
of the KRRS, which is port r ayed as David bat t l i n g
against Goliaths which are often backed by the stat e
and powerful multinat i o n a l s. It is certainly true that
much of the rhetoric raised against these techno-
l o gi e s , and Monsanto and Cargill in part i c u l a r , i s
couched in nationalist term s. D e m o n s t r at i o n s
against multinationals often attract nation-wide T V
c ove r a g e .The media are always keen to sniff out
c o n s p i r a c i e s , and the threat to fa rm e rs and food
s e c u rity from powerful We s t e rn commercial inter-
ests is the stuff of many stori e s , not all of them 
a c c u r at e .
In some ways neo-Gandhian movements like
the KRRS are open to accusations of being high
on rhetoric and symbolic action but low on deli-
ve ring the goods in intern ational and national fora.
From all accounts, l e a d e rs like Nanjundaswa my
are today somewhat isolated and may not be able
to sustain a movement against GM crops and the
introduction of other fa rm technologies into India
for much longer. n
On the whole the media have
been supportive of the KRRS,
which is portrayed as David
battling against Goliaths which

and powerful multinationals
