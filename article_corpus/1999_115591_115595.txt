One and a half billion dollars—that’s
h ow much compensation 75 Cofa n ,
Secoya and Quechua Indians living in
E c u a d o r ’s Amazon region want from
Texaco. They accuse the U.S. oil giant of
perpetrating “ecocide” during 26 years of
o p e r ations in Ecuador and maintain that the
damage is continuing because the firm is
using old equipment.
The Indians have not sued in the court s
of their own country but before a court in
New Yo r k . B e t ween 1964 and 1990, a
consortium of a Texaco subsidiary and the
E c u a d o rian state oil company Pe t r o e c u a d o r
drilled 339 wells,including 232 which are
still producing in the eastern part of the
c o u n t ry and have been operated exclusive l y
by Petroecuador since 1992.
The Indians quote studies done by env i-
ronmental organizations such as the U.S.
National Resources Defense Council and
the Center for Economic and Social Rights,
both based in New Yo r k , and on research by
scientists from the Harvard School of Public
H e a l t h . The Indians say Texaco has pol-
luted about a million hectares of land and
that some 30,000 people have contracted
skin and intestinal diseases, had my s t e ri o u s
miscarriages and in some cases developed
cancer.

Texaco is also accused of having released
more than 75 million cubic metres of tox i c
liquid waste into ri ve rs and mars h l a n d s ,
accidentally spilled more than 60,000 cubic
metres of oil and left uncovered more than
600 dumps containing toxic mat e ri a l . I n
addition,it is said to have caused conside-
rable deforestation along with soil erosion
and reduced biodiversity.
Texaco has admitted that “oil spills some-
times do occur”, but it cites inve s t i g at i o n s
by two firm s ,A gra Earth and Env i r o n m e n t a l
and Fugro McClelland, which say the Te x a c o
s u b s i d i a ry “acted responsibly” without cau-
sing “a lasting or significant impact” on the
e nv i r o n m e n t .Texaco adds that between 1995
and last ye a r , under an agreement with the
E c u a d o rian authori t i e s , it carried out a $40
million “ r e m e d i a l ”p r o gr a m m e .
The subsidiary, it say s , “ c o n s i s t e n t l y
complied with the laws of Ecuador and
international petroleum industry environ-
mental standards” and that all its operat i o n s
“took place under the control and superv i-
sion of Ecuador’s gove rn m e n t ” . It adds
that the matter should go before an Ecua-
dorian court because “U.S. courts should
not gove rn the activities of a sove r e i g n
foreign nat i o n , just as foreign courts should
not govern the activities of the U.S.”
These are the issues U. S .D i s t rict Judge
Jed Rakoff is due to decide in A p ril 1999 at
the end of a tortuous legal battle which has
lasted more than five ye a rs. If he decides the
case can be heard in the United Stat e s , it will
set a ve ry important precedent, o p e n i n g
the way for other non-U.S. citizens to sue
U.S. firms in the United States itself.
The four gove rnments Ecuador has had
over the past six ye a rs have opposed such
m ove s. For reasons of national sove r e i g n t y,
they have said, the matter should be dealt
with in Ecuador. But if that happened, u n l i k e
in the U. S . where “class actions” (joint suits)
are allowe d ,e ve ry one of the 30,000 people
affected would have to sue individually. O n
top of that , s ays their law ye r , C ri s t o b a l
B o n i fa z , the plaintiffs do not believe they
will get justice in Ecuador because Ecua-
d o rian judges lack experience of such cases
and most of all because oil interests are too
p owerful there.
T h i rteen million hectares—almost half
the country — h ave been leased for explora-
t i o n , mainly to intern ational oil companies.
Oil provides half of all Ecuador’s export s
and 40 per cent of its national income. It is
considered the key to the country ’s progr e s s ,
enabling some to argue that ecologi c a l
damage is a price that has to be paid.
But this is nonsense. E c u a d o r ’s foreign
debt has risen from $217 million before
the oil boom to nearly $15 billion today, a n d
70 per cent of Ecuadorians live below the
p ove rty line. And oddly enough, the oil-
fields are in the poorest parts of the country,
where working conditions are tough and
the pay bad.



The oil flo w s, and the forest b l e e d s

A group of Ecuadorian Indians are suing the oil company Texaco 
for ‘ecocide’ in the U.S. courts
‘U.S. courts should not govern the activities 
of a sovereign foreign nation, just as foreign courts should
not govern the activities of the U.S.’
In Quito, Indian women demonstrate outside
the headquarters of the Tripetrol company.

The oil companies are notorious for per-
suading local authorities to turn a blind eye to
e nvironmental damage and even for buying up
polluted fa rmland so as to avoid demands for
c o m p e n s ation or rehabilitat i o n . The Nort h
A m e rican firm A R C O, which says it nego-
t i ates with the Indians, e ven got official per-
mission to build security fences around its ins-
t a l l at i o n s , along with pri vate paramilitary
g u a r d s , at a cost of nearly $2 million a month.
To end these three decades of harmful

p r a c t i c e s , the laws concerning oil opera-
tions should be thoroughly ove r h a u l e d ,a n d
this is bound to involve co-operation bet-
ween the state and civil society. Signs that
things might be changing include talks bet-
ween the gove rnment and indigenous
peoples about oil and about setting up two
protected areas in the Amazon region.
M e a n w h i l e , graffiti on the walls of
several towns proclaim that “the oil flows
and the forest bleeds.” n
