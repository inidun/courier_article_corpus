The menace of 'extinct' volcanoes
by Haroun Tazieff
One of history's most famous volcanoes,
Vesuvius on the bay of Naples, is still
active. Its eruption of AD 79 buried Pom¬
peii, Herculaneum and Stabiae.
I
have gradually become convinced of
something that laymen and even pro¬
fessional geologists and volcanologists
usually ignore and it fills me with dread
the prospect, some day soon, of unheard-
of volcanic catastrophes. Geological evi¬
dence has finally convinced me that
humanity has so far been fantastically
lucky, and the catastrophes of Pompeii and
St. Pierre de la Martinique are nothing to
what awaits us. These were small towns
compared with the enormous modern cities
threatened at closer or longer range by a
volcanic outburst Naples and Rome,
Portland and Seattle, Mexico City, Ban¬
dung, Sapporo, Oakland, Catania, Cler¬
mont-Ferrand! ... Volcanoes regarded as
totally extinct near these cities are dead
only to eyes that cannot or will not see. A
volcano may be less than a century dor¬
mant and people almost forget that it exists.
But volcanoes are geologically live; time for
them is counted not in years or even in
centuries, but in millennia and tens of mil¬
lennia. Centuries might pass and Clermont-
Ferrand, Rome or Seattle not be wiped out.
Butthe interval might be much less.
