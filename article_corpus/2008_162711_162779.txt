The custom of making New Year 
gifts has both a simple and 
complicated history. It is simple 
enough if we merely think of the 
general meaning of the custom 
itself, and examine the example, 
Japan’s New Year wish, “O-ni wa 
soto fuku wa uchi!” (Out, all 
demons! Let good luck come in!) 
Just as the old year should take 
the ill luck away with it, so the 
enrichment and happiness brou-
ght by the exchange of gifts on 
New Year’s Day are regarded as an 
omen, almost as a magic 
spell, to ensure that the 
New Year will continue 
as joyfully as it begun. 
From this point of 
v iew, the Japanese 
saying is very like those 
used by Ovid in the first 
book of the Fastes, des-
cribing Romans customs 
at the festival of Janus. 
Today, this has become 
our January 1, although 
for a long time, even in 
Rome, the festival did 
not coincide with the 
beginning of New Year. 
“What is the meaning”, 
kept up in the French language, in 
which the word for the New Year 
gifts is étrennes. Shopkeepers 
reverse the meaning in the use of 
the verb étrenner, which signifies 
to make the first sale of the day. 
It is more difficult to trace the 
origin of the custom of New Year 
gifts in the Western world. The 
ancient Celtics Druids had a cere-
mony which corresponds to 
January 1. They cut mistletoe, 
which was considered to be a 
magical plant with 
protec t ive powers 
from the oak trees, 
and distributed it to 
the people. Hence the 
name given in certain 
parts of France, until 
quite recently, to New 
Year gifts: guy- l’an- 
neuf, corrupted some-
times into aguignette 
(from the French gui: 
“mistletoe” and l’an-
neuf: “New Year”). 
In Rome during the 
second half of Decem-
ber and the early part 
of January, festivals 
took place   …
the poet asks Janus, “of the dates, 
the wrinkled figs and the light-
coloured honey, offered in a white 
vessel?” “It is an omen,” replies 
the god. “They express the desire 
that coming events may impre-
gnate with the same sweetness…” 
Ovid also relates that on the first 
day of the year, the Roman shop-
keepers were careful to open their 
shops for a short while, in order to 
make a few sales as a good omen 
for the rest of the year. Curiously 
enough, this tradition has been

Renaissance, metal pins became a 
favourite form of present as they 
were then a great novelty; until the 
15th century, women had used 
wooden pins to fasten their clo-
thing. As for New Year cards with 
pictures and ornamental texts, they 
are known to have been in use from 
Europe to Japan. “Some in golden 
letters write their love” says a 17th 
century English poet. In France, 
illustrated New Year cards were in 
fashion until the revolution.
Spontaneous 
acceptance of 
interdependence
To understand why the practice of 
exchanging New Year gifts is so 
persistent and so widespread, we 
must look beyond these entertai-
ning details for the underlying 
significance of the custom. “The 
manner of giving is more impor-
tant than the gift”, the saying 
goes, and all peoples, “savage” or 
civilized, appear to believe that it 
is better to receive objects as 
presents than to acquire them 
oneself, as if the act of giving – 
or receiving – has added to the 
value of the object. The Maoris of 
New Zealand believed that a 
magic power, which they called 
“hau”, entered into the present 
and created a permanent link 
between the giver and the recei-
ver. Similarly, the Roman custom 
of offe ring …  continue on page 38

with juniper fumes and sprinkled

New Year gifts, as we know them 
today, are not so much a relic of 
these popular customs as the 
democratization of an aristocra-
tic tradition. Very early in modern 
history sovereigns demanded New 
Year gifts as a means of augmen-
ting their income and affording a 
further opportunity for their sub-
jects to prove their loyalty. In 
France, Henry III and the Duc de 
Berri were in the habit of recei-
ving New Year gifts (what we 
would nowadays call a “luxury 
edition” is mentioned under this 
heading in the inventory of the 
latter’s possessions). It is well 
known that Elizabeth I of England 
relied on her New Year gifts for 
her pocket money and the upkeep 
of her wardrobe; the archbishops 
and bishops each used to give her 
from ten to forty pounds, while 
she received dresses, skirts, silk 
stockings, garters, cloaks, mantle 
… at which gifts 
were exchanged; those 
of fered in December 
were usually of two 
k inds –wax candles 
(which we have adopted 
for our Christmas trees) 
and dolls made of clay 
or some edible subs-
tance, which were given 
to the children. There 
were others, too, des-
cribed in great detail by 
Martial in his epigrams; 
Roman chroniclers rela-
ted that the patricians 
received gifts from their 
plebeian dependents 
and the Emperors from 
the citizens. Caligula 
took possession of his 
gifts in person and spent the 
whole day in the vestibule of his 
palace for this purpose.

Traces of their dual origin – in 
pagan customs and Roman rites- 
seem long to have been preserved 
by New Year gifts. Why otherwise 
would the Church throughout the 
Middle- Ages have tried – in vain 
– to abolish them as barbaric sur-
vival? However, by then, these 
gifts were not only periodical tri-
bute paid by the peasants to their 
overlord, in the form of capons, 
fresh cheeses and preserved 
fruits; or symbolic  offerings, such 
as oranges or lemons, spiked with 
cloves, hung like charms above 
jars of wine to prevent it from 
turning sour, or nutmegs wrapped 
up in gilt paper. They were part of 
a much larger scheme of offerings 
under which, in certain parts of 
Europe, even the livestock were

with another. This annual New 
Year festival, at which flowers and 
sweets, ties and illustrated cards 
change hands, is not then to be 
decided. It is an occasion when 
all men realise that the society in 
which they live is based on this 
very principle of give-and-take.

out of a like belief. It originated 
in the offering of green boughs 
to the Sabine King, Tatius, who 
shared the royal power with 
Romulus. These boughs were 
taken from the sacred wood of 
the goddess Strenia, and were 
thus called strenae in Latin, from 
which is derived the French, 
étrennes. 
Strenia was the goddess of 
strength. For the Romans and for 
the Maoris alike, presents were 
objects endowed with a special 
power through the act of giving. 
From where did this power come? 
By the exchange of gifts, often of 
mere token value, people give 
expression in outward and visible 
form to the inner spirit of commu-
nity life – spontaneous accep-
tance of interdependence one
