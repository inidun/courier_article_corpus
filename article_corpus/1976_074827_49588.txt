BRANCUSI
i



an artist in quest
of the absolute
by Barbu Brezianu
BARBU BREZIANU, Romanian art critic.
Is a member of the International Association
ofArt Critics andan honorary research worker
at the Arts History Institute of the Romanian
Academy. He is the author of a major study
on Brancusi, published by the Academy of
the Socialist Republic of Romania, in 1974.
CONSTANTIN Brancusi was un¬
deniably one of the great
sculptors of the 20th century. And
yet today, 20 years after his death,
although the name of this Romanian
artist is universally known, his work
is not as fully appreciated as it
should be.
Brancusi was born in 1876 of pea¬
sant stock and was to retain a life¬
long nostalgia for the mountains and
forests of his native region of Oltenla.
His artistic education in Romania
lasted from 1894 to 1902, first at the
School of Arts and Crafts ¡n Craiova
and then, at the National School of w
Fine Arts in Bucharest. r
In 1922 Brancusi began to think of creating a monument to the dead of the
First World War. He executed this war memorial in 1937-1938 in a park in the town
of Tirgu-Jiu near his birthplace in Romania. Among the major works in the
ensemble of sculptures at Tirgu-Jiu are the Table of Silence (above), a table of
spiritual communion with the dead and the Endless Column (right), an axis of
communication between earth and heaven.

Photos below show two stages in the experimentation with forms that
preoccupied Brancusi throughout his life. In Sleeping Muse or The Sleep (below)
a marble sculpture executed in 1908, the influence of Rodin can still be seen.
Another Sleeping Muse (below right) displays the originality of Brancusi's search
for purity of form.
, In 1904 he moved to Paris, where he
studied at the famous Ecole des
Beaux-Arts until 1907. Two of his
fellow students were Georges Braque
and Fernand Léger. Paris was his
chosen place of residence for half
a century, and here he worked conti¬
nuously until his death in 1957, trans¬
forming marble, wood and metal Into
sculptures which frequently discon¬
certed his contemporaries by the
unfamiliarity of their underlying
concept.
Yet from very early on it was clear
that Brancusi could have had a first-
class academic career. In 1898 he
exhibited a bust in Craiova which
attracted much notice; and the Ecor-
ché (anatomical model) which he
made in 1901-1902 at the School of
Fine Arts in Bucharest, impeccable
¡n Its technical execution, revealed
the unusual virtuosity of the novice
sculptor. For he had studied anato¬
my painstakingly, even to the extent
of attending numerous dissections of
corpses.
He was a tireless worker, and had
soon mastered all the difficulties of
his craft. The bronzes and marbles
18

which he sculpted at the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts in Paris bear witness to
the sureness of his representations
of the human body, though he. was
soon to reject these, refusing as he
put it to sculpt "bronze and marble
corpses" because he was exasperat¬
ed by the technique which he believ¬
ed turned "the living body of a hu¬
man being" Into "my inert sculpture...
the corpse of my model".
During his last year at the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1906-7) Bran¬
cusi discovered Rodin. The French
sculptor, thirty years his senior, en¬
joyed almost universal renown at the
time. Under his influence Brancusi,
who was not yet doing direct carving,
began to work towards a more sen¬
sitive way of modelling which would,
through the right balance of light and
shadow, contrasts and volumes, bring
out the interior expression of the
model.
But Brancusi was not cut out to
be a. disciple: the vision which ins¬
pired him was his own. He could
not be satisfied by producing "one
sculpture a day like Rodin. I could
not work by his side, even though
he was fond of me. I did what he
did. I was imitating him, not inten¬
tionally, but I realized what was hap¬
pening. I was not happy these were
years spent in searching, groping to
find my way."
In 1952, five years before his death,
Brancusi in a "Homage to Rodin"
destroyed a myth which alleged that
he had worked in Rodin's studio. "Ever
since Michelangelo sculptors have
wanted to create the magnificent, but.
they have only succeeded in achiev¬
ing grandiloquence... Rodin came on
the scene and changed everything.
In his work man again became the
measure of things, the module from
The Prayer, a bronze funerary monument executed in 1907
for the cemetery of Biizau (Romania). It is now
in the National Gallery of the Bucharest Museum of Art.
which the final statue grows. He
made the form and content of sculp¬
ture human again. In 1906 Rodin
offered to take me as a pupil, but
I refused, because nothing can grow
in the shadow of tall trees. When
he heard my decision Rodin just said
'He's right; after all, he is just as
obstinate as I am.'"
Brancusi found his own way in the
years 1907-1908, as ¡s evident from
two examples of his work: one is
The Prayer (1907), a bronze monu¬
ment for a tomb in a Romanian ce¬
metery (today in the Bucharest Mu¬
seum); it represents a nude woman
kneeling with the body leaning for¬
ward, and is a perfect signpost to¬
wards everything that we shall find
in Brancusi's subsequent develop¬
ment. The statue is not simply a
woman praying: it is the quintessence
of prayer.
The second sculpture is The Kiss
(1908), one of Rodin's basic themes,
but in this case so far removed from
Rodin that it might almost be regard¬
ed as diametrically opposed to the
latter's work. It has been carved .
directly from a block of rough quar- r

Birds in the Sky, a watercolour and gouache
(32 cm 66 cm) by Brancusi, probably executed around
1929 1930. As well as birds, the work suggests the essence
of flight itself. The Miracle or The Seal, grey marble

two opposites: agility and ungainliness.
Flying Turtle, marble (1943). Its streamlined form
suggests a modern aerodynamic design.

, ried stone and ¡s composed of the
waist-length figures of two lovers
embracing. The same theme of two
human figures in an embrace this
time full-length is found again in a
work of funerary sculpture for which
Brancusi was given the commission
in Paris for the Montparnasse Cem¬
etery. In this version abstraction has
been taken one step further.
This nude woman praying, this nude
couple united for all eternity, present¬
ed an unusual sight in a cemetery
during the first decade of the twen¬
tieth century at a time when old
aesthetic and moral conventions still
prevailed. The statuary could have
caused amazement and even indigna¬
tion had it not been for the austere
simplicity of Brancusi's nudes, the
legacy, it could be suggested, of the
Byzantine tradition and the ancient
world.
These works form an important
milestone in the history of modern
sculpture. The Prayer, exhibited at
the 26th Salon des Artistes Indépen¬
dants in Paris in 1910, undoubtedly
influenced the works produced from
1911 onwards by the German sculp--
tor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, a Parisian by
adoption who in his turn and despite
his early death in 1919 exerted a
significant Influence on German sculp¬
ture during the period following the
First World War.
The Kiss produced in 1908 was
sculpted at the time when Brancusi
was rejecting modelling in clay as
done by Rodin, a method which he
had hitherto used himself. "Which
of us was it who said that clay was
like mud? He was quite right", he
said to Modigliani who was to be¬
come one of the greatest twentieth-
century painters and at that time was
beginning to sculpt. The significance
of this rejection of soft material
should not be underestimated: in the
stone of The Kiss Brancusi eliminated
all superfluous detail and achieved
the ultimate simplification of volume.
The Kiss ¡n its many variations fi¬
nally evolved into the Gate of the
Kiss (1938), one of the main elements
in a sculpture ensemble created as
a war memorial to the dead of the
First World War at Tirgu-Jiu in Roma¬
nia. The memorial also includes the
7ao/e of Silence, whose structure re¬
calls that of the drum-shaped stone
altars of Romanian village churches;
¡t is surrounded by twelve hour-glass-
shaped stone stools.
Another work in this group is the
remarkable Endless Column, compos¬
ed of sixteen elements with lozenge-
shaped or rhomboid planes, which
Brancusi likened to a "preliminary
design for a column which when en¬
larged would support the vaults of
heaven."
In his essay, "Brancusi and Mytho¬
logies", the great historian of reli¬
gions, Mircea Eliade, wrote as follows
about this 30-metre-hlgh column in
metallized cast iron: "It is significant
that Brancusi chose a motif ¡n Roma¬
nian folklore which has developed
from a mythological theme dating
back to prehistory... the 'heavenly
column' which supports the vaults of
heaven... The image must have
haunted Brancusi, for it was part of
the symbolism of ascension, flight,
transcendence... In many ancient
dwellings the central pillar was a
means of communication with the
heavens. "
We can see that the concepts un¬
derlying Brancusi's works, and even
the names of the statues, bear wit-,
ness to his personal spiritual vision,
so closely linked with the land and
whose origins go back to the ancient
culture of Thrace. It is this vision,
already exemplified in the first Kiss
of 1908, which will illuminate his ar¬
tistic output for the next half century.
It will also be responsible, even to¬
day, for Brancusi's reputation as a
"difficult" artist, that is to say diffi¬
cult to understand.
Yet around the same time, Picasso's
painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon
(1907) revolutionized art. It was a
first step towards Cubist expression
and reflected African art which the

and 1949.

The Kiss is one
of the
fundamental
themes in
Brancusi's work.
This remarkable
sculpture
represents the
force of love in
the face of
eternity. " We
feel a heart
beating there",
it has been said ;
the heart of the
world.
Western world was just discovering
and which would overthrow traditional
values ¡n the plastic arts in Western
culture for many years to come.
Brancusi was undoubtedly drawn
to African and Oceanic art for a
brief period, and it probably had
some influence on works of his which
have been lost or destroyed. But in
the same way as he had earlier refus¬
ed to work with Rodin he now.turned
. away from masks and fetishes and
also from the experimentations of
Picasso. He preferred to tread his
own solitary path, as dictated by his
own spiritual make-up, equilibrium,
serenity and philosophical wisdom.
Right up to the end of his life
Brancusi subjected his works (to¬
talling just under 300) to a continuous
process of purification. Henry Moore
denned the historical significance of
the Romanian sculptor and his works
in the following words: "Since the
Gothic, European sculpture had be¬
come overgrown with moss, weeds
all sorts of surface excrescences
which completely concealed shape.
It has been Brancusi's special mis¬
sion to get rid of this overgrowth,
and to make us once more shape-
conscious. To do this he has had
to concentrate on very simple direct
shapes, to keep his sculpture, as it
were, one-cylindered, to refine and
polish a single shape to a degree
almost too precious. Brancusi's
work, apart from its individual value,
has been of historical importance in
the development of contemporary
sculpture."
Brancusi's sculpture is a return to
the primeval element, the primary
molecule, the germ of all life: the
egg. Throughout his life he search¬
ed for, and achieved, . the fullest
possible significance of ovoid forms.
The First Cry, the First Step, the Be¬
ginning of the World, to mention only
three, are the fruits of a continuous
and profound process of reflection.
"Reality", he said, "is not the out¬
ward shape of things, but their essen¬
ce". And so the sequence of Sleeping
Muses was created, and the Birds
sequence which began in 1912 with
the Maiastra, a mythical bird figuring
in Romanian folk tales. The 1912
version of the latter, ¡n polished
bronze, ¡s not merely the suggestion
of a bird about to take flight: it is
the essence of flight and the whole
upward movement of life itself.
Between 1919 and 1940 Brancusi
continued the Bird ¡n Space sequen¬
ce which numbered twenty-two ver¬
sions, some in polished bronze and
others in marble of different colours,
their sheen and polish varying ac¬
cording to the material used. Each
curve describes an asymmetric ellip¬
se which merges into the heavens.
This image of movement towards
the absolute the sculptor even suc¬
ceeds in Imparting to the form of a
turtle, that most ponderous of beasts,
in his unusual Flying Turtle (1943)
This sculpture in marble is reduced
to its simplest expression, with an
oblique movement suggesting an up¬
ward pull against gravity, flight in a
dream.
We find the harmony of ovoid forms
again in the remarkable portraits of
Mademoiselle Pogany, about whom
the. sculptor-poet Jean Arp wrote:
Who is this beauty?
It is Mademoiselle Pogany, related to
Lady Shub-ad, the beautiful Sumerian
woman, and to Nefertiti.
Mademoiselle Pogany is the fairy god¬
mother of abstract sculpture.
She is made of arches, curves, pure
shells,
Encased in pearl. .,
Her eyes hatch white moons.
According to the Romanian art
expert Edgar Papu, Brancusi believed
that his materials were alive, suf¬
fused with their own powers of
thought and spirit. In the reflections
of Brancusi's lovingly polished bron¬
zes, Papu could even perceive light
being formed from the sculpted
material.
Right up to his death Brancusi
continued to search and make dis- ^
coveries. He can be regarded as a r

one he went further in his
search for simplicity and purity
of form.
precursor of kinetic art: in his studio
he sometimes used electric motors
to move his sculptures round on a
base. He invested the pedestal with
a new significance: instead of being
the mere support of a piece of sculp¬
ture it became an integral part of it,
an essential complement, a work in
itself. For the variations on a theme
¡n his sequential works, we find that
in each case the pedestal is a crea¬
tion in itself, rich in resonance like
the music to the lyrics.
In addition to being a virtuoso in
marble and bronze, Brancusi gave
new life to sculpture in wood, suffu¬
sing the carving with a secret and
Intense life of its own. We can see
this in the four hollows of the Spirit
of Buddha (dating from the 1920s),
later renamed the King of Kings,
which truly seem to be inhabited by
spirits. The same applies to Socrates
(1923), Chimera (1918) and Adam and
Eve (1917), an abstract work over
2 metres high carved in old oak on
a chestnut wood and limestone base,
which is a perfect example of the
pedestal as conceived by Brancusi,
i.e. an inseparable part of the total
concept of the sculpture.
Writers, poets, philosophers, pain¬
ters, sculptors, critics and art histo¬
rians a whole generation has reco¬
gnized the genius of Brancusi's art.
It ¡s as though the world has been
confronted with another, new world.
We will leave the last word to Jean
Arp ¡n his evocation of the studio of
the Endless Column on "one even¬
ing in May 1929".
Day was drawing to a close, but the
space around a bird was dreaming of
an arrowed flash of lightning and did
not notice that the bird had flown off
and was finding its way to the studio
of the endless column.
The cock was crowing cock-a-dood¬
le-doo and each sound made a zig
or a zag in its neck.
Brancusi's cock is a saw that is joy.
This cock saws the day of the tree
of light.
All these sculptures come from a
human fountain:
The cock
The seal
His self-portrait: the endless column.
The fish, giant king of the flint-rocks
swimming in a cloud.
The prodigal son who mounts the
steps by descending.
The penguins which lay the egg of
the newborn.
A fountain recounts these plastic fa¬
bles.
These are fables of such subtlety
that the revelations they offer us are
limitless.
