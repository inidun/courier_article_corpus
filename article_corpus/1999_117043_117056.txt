Is C h i n a ’s law eugenic?
C h i n a ’s approach to family planning has been attacked in the West as authoritarian
and an infringement on individual rights. B e l o w, Chinese Academician Qiu Renzong re j e c t s
claims that his country’s Law on Maternal and Infant Health is eugenic. O v e r l e a f, a German
Sinologist challenges Qiu Renzong’s position.
Ch i n a ’s Law on Mat e rnal and Infant Health (see
b ox opposite page) has attracted considerable
c riticism in the We s t e rn media and scientific
c i r c l e s. Some of the criticism is valid but some is
based on misunderstandings caused by linguistic or
cultural barri e rs. Much of the confusion revo l ve s
around the word yo u s h e n g, which repeatedly occurs
in the legal text.A tricky word with dual meanings,
it is commonly used to mean “ h e a l t hy birt h s ” in asso-
c i ation with child-reari n g . H owe ve r , yo u s h e n g c a n
also be used to describe eugenic programmes such
as that practised by the Nazis.U n f o rt u n at e l y,E n g l i-
sh translations of the law tend to reflect this lat t e r
m e a n i n g .
Is the Mat e rnal and Infant Health Law eugenic?
I would argue that for a policy to be eugenic it must
first reject individual consent and second, be based
on racism. Neither of these conditions applies to
C h i n a ’s law.While doctors may advise two indivi-
duals at risk of passing on hereditary disease to refrain
from marrying or to undergo steri l i z at i o n , the ulti-
m ate decision is left to these adults.When prenat a l
testing reveals genetic disease, a doctor will offer
advice—not a directive — c o n c e rning abort i o n .
The way to a higher domain
It is also crucial to recognize that the law is not
m o t i vated by racism but by a desire to reduce birt h
d e f e c t s. I n d e e d , there is no racist tradition in China.
The Chinese have been the victims of We s t e rn impe-
rialism and Japanese militari s m .They may have
made gr ave mistakes, but they have never claimed
superiority over another people,and their military
actions have never been motivated by racism. N o r
is racism part of China’s internal policies.The Han,
C h i n a ’s dominant ethnic gr o u p, do not claim super-
iority over China’s minorities.
We s t e rn e rs are often shocked by Chinese at t i-
tudes to defective foetuses because they do not
u n d e rstand the cultural and economic fa c t o rs invo l-
ve d .The gr e at Confucianist Xun Zi (300-237 BC)
s a i d :“ B i rth is the beginning of a human being, a n d
d e ath is the end of a human being. A human being
who has a good beginning and a good end fulfills the
Tao [the Way to a higher spiritual domain].”Two
major fa c t o rs shaping genetic policy in China emer-
ge from this Confucian view. F i rs t ,a b o rtion is moral-
ly and socially acceptable because life begins with
b i rt h . A foetus is not considered a human being.
S e c o n d , congenital disease and deformity are consi-
dered a sign of sin committed by the parents or ances-
t o rs in their previous life. G i ven that a defective new-
b o rn child is traditionally called a “monster foetus”,
it is not surp rising to find little in the way of fa m i l i a l
or social support . One of the parents of a deform e d
baby will usually have to stop wo r k i n g, and the costs
of caring for such a child can amount to a third of an
average wo r k e r ’s salary.
Poverty
C h a n ging these negat i ve attitudes will take a
gr e at deal of time.There are now more than 50 mil-
lion handicapped people, mostly living in poverty,
and it is unreasonable to expect any major impro-
vements in the treatment of handicapped children
and their mothers in the near future. In this context,
m a ny feel that these children and their mothers
would be better off if the handicapped had neve r
been born . In fa c t , the Chinese A s s o c i ation of the
Handicapped formally urged the gove rnment in
1989 to speed up legi s l ation to prevent the birt h
of deformed babies, gi ven their suffering and the
burden they represent for society.
The concern for the collective good has at times
led geneticists and others in China to infringe upon
individual autonomy.They have confused what is
t e c h n o l o gically possible (genetic testing) with what
is ethically perm i s s i b l e .H owe ve r , I feel that the law
is a positive step towards guaranteeing eve ryo n e
access to genetic counselling and to prohibiting sex-
s e l e c t i o n . Chinese geneticists and bioethicists have
c riticized some articles of the law.Their suggestions
include more explicit recognition of the pri n c i p l e
of informed consent. Last ye a r , the authori t i e s
consulted leading Chinese bioethicists and gene-
ticists and will make the needed changes at  an
appropriate time.Meanwhile,I would ask Western
colleagues to directly consult officials, g e n e t i c i s t s
and citizens instead of trying to sanction China,
which may do more harm than good. n
