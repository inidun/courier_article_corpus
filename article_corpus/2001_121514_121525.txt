C o h é r e n c e. “ That would be true if, after coming
home from the supermarket,we didn’t have to pay
taxes for the European Union’s common
agricultural policy, which amounts to 3,000 French
francs [about $400] per European household,
finance exceptional subsidies to offset periodic
drops in pork prices and,above all,foot the water
pollution clean-up bill.”
Brittany is no stranger to agricultural crises.
Each time one has arisen,the region has struggled
to overcome it as best it could, but the nagging
problem of water pollution is getting worse. H a r m f u l
nitrates from the 500 kilos of fertilizers per hectare
that farmers spread on their crops, or from foul-
smelling manure, are building up in rivers. Fo r
B r i t t a n y, that represents a toxic waste spill of 200,000
tonnes a day. In theory, France abides by the
p o l l u t e r-pays principle. But since the first water
pollution law was passed in 1964, p o w e r f u l
agricultural industry pressure groups have made
sure that it has never been enforced.
Marching for quality water and
a different kind of agriculture
As early as 1969, Eaux et Rivières de Bretagne,
an organization of salmon-fishers and nature-lovers,
sounded the alarm. Since then, the group has voiced
the discontent of its members, who have won a
lawsuit against the Lyonnaise des Eaux water
c o m p a n y : they deduct the pollution clean-up charges
from their bills.“On March 21, 1 9 9 9 ,” says livestock-
breeder and Cohérence member Denis Baulier,
“8,000 people demonstrated in Po n t i v y, in the centre
of Brittany, demanding both quality water and a
different kind of agriculture. That is the day when
consumers and farmers joined forces.”
As attitudes were changing, the condition of
rivers was deteriorating.The government launched
a pure water plan for Brittany in 1990,followed by
another one. Ten years and 1.5 billion francs later,
the amount of nitrates is higher than ever. Th e
government has even opened a second front by
implementing a plan to control agricultural
pollution. A recent government accounting office
report has blasted the scheme for abysmal
management.
“That plan has already cost five billion francs,”
says René Louail, a livestock-breeder from the
Côtes d’Armor region and spokesman for the
Confédération paysanne, a farmers’ group. “ Fo r
the most part, i t ’s been used to approve or legitimate
farms that have gone around the law to expand.
There won’t be any significant improvement of

Wh a t ’s in Brittany? Three million
i n h a b i t a n t s, 57,000 farms and 22
million livestock animals, i n c l u d i n g
cows fed on animal meal, p i g s
enclosed in concrete pens by the
hundreds and industrially produced chickens that
have never seen the light of day. To catch up
economically with the rest of the country and to
provide jobs for its children, half a century ago this
region in western France adopted the only option it
was offered: production-intensive agriculture.E a c h
time there’s a hitch in the system, Brittany suffers.
First there were cyclical pig crises,now there’s mad-
cow disease.
But not everybody has lost hope. Standing in a
field of clover amidst his 35 cows, Pascal Hillion
believes he’ll make it through the epidemic.His secret:
his placid herbivores have always grazed on grass
instead of eating granules containing animal meal,
which causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy
( B S E ) . “In 1996, about twenty breeders, i n c l u d i n g
m y s e l f, created a label for our products, ‘ Fr o m
B r i t t a n n y ’s Pastures,’ which has helped us to win
back consumers’ trust and to show other breeders how
to proceed. We don’t use nitrate fertilizers, so our
method respects the environment,” he says. “ We
produce better-quality meat while spending less,
working less and earning a better living.Ten years ago,
people thought we were eccentric. To d a y, y o u n g
people who want to become farmers are studying us
c l o s e l y.” The 20 partners have even opened up a
b u t c h e r ’s shop in Saint-Brieuc.
This initiative will not revolutionize farming in
Brittany, but similar experiments are multiplying
thanks to a network of organizations. Seventy of
t h e m , grouped together under the name
“ C o h é r e n c e,” are trying to forge a new alliance
between farmers, environmentalists and consumers.
Everybody in the town of Lorient knows Dr.
Lylian Le Goff. Responding to a student council

products are not necessarily more expensive than
others. A nearby highschool has already followed
suit. And many local communities, after banning
beef from school cafeterias, wonder whether this
might be the answer to their worries.“Production-

F ra n c e : mad cows 
and studious farmers
Farmers, environmentalists and consumers unite to battle 
the ravages of industrial farming in Brittany

B r i t t a n y ’s water until more ecological farming
methods are adopted.”
André Pochon agrees. “ Farming in Brittany
started spinning out of control when the bond with
the soil was broken,” he says. D é d é , as everybody
calls him, has had time to think the matter over. I n
1 9 4 4 , when he was 11 years old,a teacher convinced
his parents to put him into an accelerated
p r o g r a m m e.Two years later he graduated and was
encouraged to enroll in a teachers’ training college.
But he preferred cows and the Jeunesse agricole
c h r é t i e n n e,a Christian farmers’ youth group that was
a breeding ground for the trade union cadres who
were going to revolutionize Brittany’s agriculture.
“ We did a terrific job up to 1970. We boosted our
yield threefold while keeping the same number of
f a r m s.At that time, we sold butter and cheese.We let
cows roam freely in the meadows and raised pigs on
w h e y. But when industrialists introduced milk
c o l l e c t i o n , intensive pig-breeding started and with it,
the elimination of small farms and the race to
increase yields.”
Dédé went along with the trend, but also took
correspondence courses and read a lot.“I became an
agronomist in spite of myself,” he says. He also
perfected his method of combining grass with clover
to fix nitrogen in the soil.As a result,he pursued and
improved the fodder revolution that had been under
way for several decades. He also convinced other
farmers around him. A master of the one-liner, h e
s a y s, “A cow is a mower in front and a manure-
spreader in the rear.Th e r e ’s no need for cutting the
grass or for mineral fertilizers.”To d a y, his method has
caught on with hundreds of livestock-breeders in
B r i t t a n y, like Pascal Hillion.But when André Po c h o n
started using it, the corn-soybean combination was

being imposed to feed cattle. “ I t ’s a monumental
mistake except for agro-business! Farmers have to
buy their hybrid seeds and herbicides, p u r c h a s e
farm equipment and buildings for intensive breeding,
level their knolls, drain wet land, e t c. The cost is
sky-high and the consequences for the environment
are serious. If you leave the soil bare in the winter,
the corn actually increases nitrate run-off.”
In the early days of the common agricultural
p o l i cy, Europe negotiated its place as a food and
agricultural power with the United States. It obtained
a green light, except in one area: animal feed. To
protect its farmers, the United States had to export
their soy. To d a y, France imports over four million
tonnes of soybeans, a good proportion of which is
genetically modifie d .A n d r é
Pochon has been making the
same arguments for 25
y e a r s. At fir s t , e c o l o g i s t s
listened to him. Th e n
organizations did. “I help
them evolve and they’v e
changed my perception.
To g e t h e r, w e ’ve changed
p e o p l e ’s mentalities.”
Sustainable agriculture
labels are flourishing for all
farm products. In Brittany,
people would like to be able to drink tap water again.
Since the mad cow crisis broke out, local communities
have been seeking more reliable meat supplies.A n d
the public is shaken.But people are starting to assess
the stakes,and know that farmers can adapt.They also
know that it’s everybody’s business to decide whether
to change with or against nature. ■
