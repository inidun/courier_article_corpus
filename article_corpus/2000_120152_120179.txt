January 14, 2000, Oakland, California. It was
with eager anticipation that more then 12,000
people descended upon the Oakland Coliseum
to see rap superstar Juvenile and his Cash Money
Click.The musicians were at the top of the charts,
while their songs and videos were being played on
radio and TV stations across the country. Earlier in
the day, they made a jovial appearance at KMEL,
the area’s leading music radio station. Joking with
fa n s , they promised to gi ve the performance of a life-
time.Little did we know what was in store.
Around 11 o’clock that night, local TV show s
were interrupted by frantic reports of mayhem at
Oakland Coliseum. H o rri fic pictures seemingly
depicting groups of thuggish young men beating up
helpless concert - g o e rs plastered TV screens as more
than 100 police offic e rs in riot gear swooped on the
C o l i s e u m . The show was halted and the sold-out
c r owd told to go home, without refunds for their
$ 5 0 - t i c k e t s.A fight had broken out, i nvolving about a
dozen men.
The aftermath was swift and damaging. Local
club owners pointed to the Coliseum fiasco as an
excuse not to host similar eve n t s. For example, t h e

Who is to blame for the violence associated with hip-hop? Media
s e n s a t i o n a l i s m , money and stereotypical readings of this 
pop culture ’s complexity
p r e s t i gious Gavin Music Convention was scheduled
to take place in the Bay Area the following month.
Plans were well underway to organise several large
hip-hop show c a s e s.They were all unceremoniously
cancelled. In fact, the hype surrounding the Coli-
seum event spread well beyond Californ i a .C o n c e rt
venue owners from across the country called Oak-
land police officials to gauge whether or not they
should host similar concerts.Yet many people saw
the Coliseum management as being ill prepared.
They were understaffed and therefore slow to let
people into the venue (which raises tensions) and,
more import a n t l y, s l ow to respond once the trouble
broke out. This criticism was barely considered,
h owe ve r , in the public hearings subsequently organ-
ised on a possible moratorium on rap concerts.
The backlash resulting
from isolated events
Making mat t e rs wo rs e , the incident occurred at a
rough time for rap because some of its supers t a rs ,
including Puff Daddy and Jay - Z ,had been invo l ved in
extremely violent incidents. Puff made intern at i o n a l
headlines when he fled a shooting in a New York City
The highly controversial Puff Daddy accepts the Rap Artist of the Year award from Billboard magazine in 1997,three years before he was implicated in a
nightclub shooting in New York.

n i g h t c l u b. Police later found an unregistered gun
inside his car and arrested him in late December last
ye a r.The bad news came on the heels of another dra-
m atic arr e s t :G r a m my award winner Jay-Z was accused
of stabbing fellow record exe c u t i ve Lance “ U n ”R i ve r a
for supposedly bootlegging his mat e ri a l .
Incidents like these have made the issue of hip-
hop violence a main staple for media commentat o rs.
Should we ban the concerts? How concerned should
we be about the lyrics and imagery promoted by
some of the acts?
S e rious discussion requires proper pers p e c t i ve .
Ye s , there are violent incidents associated with hip-
hop, but they do not define the mindset of the cul-
t u r e .B e ware of the trap of stereotyping.The alleged
illegal actions of superstars like Puff and Jay-Z are
an embarrassment, but they do not represent the
music and culture.
For example,violent incidents abound at soccer
m atches around the world but they don’t defin e
the sport or a particular community. In many cases
l aw enforcement and civic officials understand that
the cost of doing business is a likelihood of vio-
l e n c e . Hence fences are built to keep ri val fa n s
a p a rt , while special security units patrol the stands.
Hip-hop has never been afforded such treatment.
I am not suggesting that we turn concerts into
police zones.Yet obviously large gat h e rings require
special precautions.We must also recognise that the
media have an interest in hyping may h e m .These sto-
ries sell. For example, nobody was killed, let alone
t r a m p l e d , at the concert I descri b e d .The violence wa s
c o n fined to a small area and invo l ved less then 20 peo-
ple out of the more than 12,000 who at t e n d e d . Not a
single arrest was made, despite the presence of about
100 police offic e rs. N e ve rt h e-
l e s s ,TV stations saw fit to inter-
rupt their regular progr a m m i n g
to inform the public about the
fig h t s. Compare that sort of
urgent coverage to the l a ck o f
attention gi ven to the crow d
violence that occurs regularly
at Bay Area football games.
The violence surr o u n d i n g
the “Big Game”b e t ween Stan-
ford Unive rsity and ri val Unive rsity of California in
1997 made the Coliseum concert look like a picnic.
The entire field, including the goal posts, was
d e s t r oyed by marauding fans who trampled innocent
b y s t a n d e rs. Police offic e rs were even at t a c k e d .Ye t
there were no TV highlights on the evening news.T h e
n e w s p a p e rs wrote rave reviews of the game and barely
mentioned the fig h t s.A p p a r e n t l y,no-one would dare
t a rnish the reputations of two ve ry prestigious uni-
ve rs i t i e s.The following ye a r , the fans went bers e r k
a g a i n , despite the presence of 200 police offic e rs.
Once again, no news cove r a g e .
I mention these incidents to highlight a much
larger point. Hip-hop is a convenient scapegoat
because its communities don’t have the political
p ower or money to control the type of media images
projected wo r l d w i d e . This has resulted in unbal-
anced coverage and the maligning of a culture.
Another major issue to consider is the violent
i m a g e ry often promoted by the rappers themselve s.
A cottage industry has blossomed over the past ten
ye a rs as record companies and artists make a killing
by selling a “thugged out”, m i s o g y n i s t i c, g a n g s t a
i m a g e .There is no denying that some of these art i s t s
actually adopt the attitudes their songs and videos
p r o j e c t . H owe ve r , there are other ways of reading
these coded lyrics and images.To begin with, s o m e
r a p p e rs use the violent metaphors as part of a long
tradition of toasting or bragging about their musical
p r owe s s.As A f rican A m e rican author and professor
Robin D. G. Kelley points out, by exaggerating and
boasting about imagi n a ry criminal acts, r a p p e rs
engage in “ verbal duels over who is the ‘ b a d d e s t ’ .”
Kelley also shows how the narr at i ves operate on two
l e ve l s. I n s i d e rs can appreciate the irony of the duels
while outsiders—namely white middle-class kids—
are enthralled by a literal reading. Judgements aside,
gangsta rappers take this audience on a fantasy tour
of “the ghetto”—a forbidden zone of cop-killers and
w h o r e s. The rappers are simply playing up on the
appeal of the evil fa n t a s i e s.
N ow you may not approve of this panderi n g .B u t
r e m e m b e r , the artists are just a small cog in the
machine of the multi-billion-dollar (per year) music
bu s i n e s s.Radio stat i o n s ,D J s , video outlets,p r o m o t i o n
people and record labels must also shoulder the
b l a m e . These money-makers aren’t just cat e ring to
popular demand.They are cultivating the market.
Major radio stations are literally flooded with hun-
dreds of pieces of music eve ry day. Who is more
responsible for influencing the public: the radio stat i o n
with a million listeners or the artist that the stat i o n
chooses to play? If an artist like
Snoop Dog or Dr Dre (both
a s s o c i ated with violence) come
in for an interv i e w, the journ a l-
ist is not obliged to focus exclu-
s i vely on the negat i ve side of
their “ghetto upbri n gi n g s ” .
They could ask about positive
projects the artist might be pur-
s u i n g .Yet it’s more profitable to
p l ay up the negat i ve stereotypes
t h at people have of rappers and black people in gen-
e r a l . One could argue that the artist should challenge
the unbalanced questioning. But it’s crucial to realise
t h at the problem of violence is bigger then the art i s t .
The violence associated with hip-hop must be
seen in proper pers p e c t i ve .We can condemn the vio-
lent acts of certain individuals without maligning a
c u l t u r e .We can read between the lines of masculine
joustings via the microphone.We can also recognise
the mainstream cultural obsession with violence: j u s t
check out the ticket sales to Hollywo o d ’s gangster
films or TV progr a m m e s. In short , we have to recog-
nise the complexity of hip-hop. R a p p e rs offer more
than just a mirror of the violence in their own com-
munities—their work reflects that of society as a
w h o l e . In short , hip-hop will remain as violent as we
a l l ow it to be. It wo n ’t change until we do. ■
