S T UDENTS BOOST 
A MUSEUM’S WORK F ORCE
◗ Zoe Titus
In Namibia, high schools have become key actors in documenting scientific collections
museum on which they had to fill in eleve n
different data fie l d s. Despite minimal tech-
nical skills, students scored a  remarkably low
13 per cent error margi n . Pa rticipants recei-
ved a string of pri z e s , from books and cd-
roms to radio cassette playe rs.
The contest has had a ripple effect and
led to the launch of SchoolNet Namibia, a
n e t work among schools, t e l e c o m m u n i c at i o n s
and electricity service prov i d e rs , the bu s i n e s s
community and other stakeholders to pro-
mote Internet deve l o p m e n t .At present, o n l y
28 per cent of Namibia’s 1,600 schools have
a telephone connection, and only a handful
are online. Money allow i n g, the museum
intends to take the model to Zimbabwe and

t e a m , which entered the highest number of
r e c o r d s , will visit Sweden in May 2000 for
t wo weeks—to computerize handwri t t e n
Namibian insect records held by seve r a l
museums there. ■
records are still handwri t t e n . “Instead of
going along the tried and failed path of see-
king foreign donor support to fill our third-
world museum with foreign consultants,
e x p e rtise and resources, we took it upon
o u rs e l ves to motivate our local corp o r at e
community to support us indirectly by
giving them a chance to be socially respon-
sible,” continues Komen.
A ripple effect

N a m i b i a ’s national museum was the
first on the continent to leap into the
I n t e rnet age: v i s i t o rs can walk through
a virtual collection of rock art , search an
online database of collections or find out
about ongoing progr a m m e s. E ven more
e n g a ging are efforts to hook up the coun-
try’s schools to the Net and heighten envi-
ronmental awa r e n e s s , via an annual contest
held for the first time in 1999.
The rule: students give the museum a
helping hand by computerizing handwrit-
ten data on its insect collection, the fif t h
largest in A f ri c a . In return , their schools
win computers and Internet access. “ We
have over 1.5 million insects in our ento-
mology collection, 70,000 handwri t t e n
insect catalogue records, and the usual
excuses—no staff, no money and no tech-
nical resources,” s ays the museum’s Jo ri s
Komen, the driving force behind the pro-
j e c t . Museums in developing countri e s
often have problems obtaining data on their
b i o d i ve rsity because many insect specimens
are kept in foreign museums, and most
