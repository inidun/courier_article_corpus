You maintain that the effects of the Cher-
nobyl disaster have been played down not
just by your own country’s leaders but also
by international organizations...
The U N Scientific Committee on the
Effects of Atomic Radiation (U N S C E A R)
relies on the figures of the International
Atomic Energy A g e n cy (I A E A) , w h i c h
represents the nuclear lobby. In evalua-
ting the disaster, the I A E A has compared
Chernobyl to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
But in Ja p a n , the thermo-nuclear reac-
tions took place entirely in the air and the
soil was not contaminated. After the
Chernobyl fir e, neighbouring countries
were bombarded by hundreds of tonnes
of radionuclides (or particles).The soil of
Belarus alone absorbed two-thirds of the
fall-out and some of the nuclides, such as
c a e s i u m - 1 3 7 , stay radioactive for more
than 30 years. Food accounts for 80 per
cent of the long-term contamination of
the population. Since the disaster, m y
institute has been systematically moni-
toring children with special spectrome-
t e r s. My colleague, P r o f. Yuri Bandaz-
h e v s k y, was the first to link the
accumulation of radioactivity in people’s
bodies to their illnesses. The contami-
nation has caused many diseases not
recognized by international organiza-
t i o n s.
What are these ailments?
After doing thousands of autopsies, B a n-
dazhevsky and his team showed that cae-
sium-137 had accumulated in muscle tissue,
beginning with the heart.Two-thirds of the
2,000 children monitored in the highly-
contaminated area of Gomel have heart
p r o b l e m s. The concentration of caesium in
the kidneys has also caused serious mal-
functions from an early age. Caesium in
the eye muscles leads to cataracts. Fo r
e x a m p l e, a 1997 study in Svetlovisy, n e a r
G o m e l , found that a quarter of children
between 13 and 15 had cataracts.
During pregnancy, the placenta in
mothers-to-be stores caesium which irra-
diates the foetus and after the birth,the
mother breastfeeds the baby with conta-
minated milk. This leads to several
d i s e a s e s, such as “Chernobyl A I D S,”
which is an immunity disorder.The radio-
active particles also combine with lead
(which was used in 1986 to put out the fir e
and was then absorbed into the ground)
to cause mental retardation and stomach
a i l m e n t s. We are heading towards a
national disaster.
What does your country need most?
Two million people, a quarter of them
c h i l d r e n ,are living in contaminated areas.
We have to set up mobile units to monitor
these people and what they eat. My ins-
titute doesn’t have many resources, s o
can only do very little monitoring. It’s
also threatened with closure because the
government doesn’t want the “ d i s t u r-
b i n g ”news to spread. The contaminated
children need to be sent for a month’s
stay in clean areas at least twice a year
and be given pectin-based pills,which are
e f f e c t i v e, very cheap and made in
U k r a i n e, though not here. We have to set
up centres for young mothers in areas
where they can eat uncontaminated food
while pregnant and breast-feeding.
Why hasn’t your government raised the
alarm about all this?
Belarus is facing alone a disaster it’s not
responsible for. Neither Russia nor
U k r a i n e,where Chernobyl is located,h a s
helped us. Our national budget only
allows a small amount of money to be
spent on the victims and our government
o f ficials believe they know best. But they
h a v e n ’t properly evaluated the situation.
Th e y ’ve lied to tens of thousands of Rus-
sians who have come from “hot spots” o r
crisis areas in the former Soviet Union to
live in the contaminated region.1 Th e y ’r e
still lying to their own people. They have
a head-in-the-sand attitude. Only massive
international aid and strong logistical
support by the government will ensure
the survival of my people in the long run.■
1 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 25 million
Russians found themselves living outside the new
b o rders of Russia, mainly in Central Asia and the
Caucasus where there was and still is war. T h e
Belarusian government encouraged them to settle in
the contaminated areas by giving them housing,
jobs and resident status.

FACING THE DISASTER A L O N E
INTERVIEW BY GALIA ACKERMAN
OF RADIO FRANCE INTERNATIONALE
The Chernobyl nuclear disaster
continues to threaten the
survival of the Belarusian
people, says Vasily Nesterenko,
a local physicist*
On April 26,2000, crowds marched in downtown Minsk to mark the anniversary of the disaster.
* Vasily Nesterenko is former director
of the Nuclear Energy Institute of the
National Academy of Sciences of Belarus
and currently head of the independent
Institute of Radiation Safety (Belrad)
