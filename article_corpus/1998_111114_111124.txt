over 2,000 years ago form uncanny designs whose meaning

Unesco's World Heritage List since 1994.
The desert air, already
shimmering in the heat
despite the early hour, roars
through the windows of the small
aircraft in which we are overfly¬
ing the world's largest and most
impressive concentration of geo-
glyphs grooves incised in the
earth. Beneath us is the archaeo¬
logical site of Nazca, in southern
Peru, which has been on the
World Heritage List since 1994.
The lines, which form geo
metrical designs or figurative
motifs, mirror a cosmogonie sys¬
tem which we are only just begin¬
ning to understand. Traced more
than 2,000 years ago by the peo¬
ple of the Nazca culture, like
writing on a giant slate, they cover
an area of almost 500 square kilo¬
metres of arid land surrounded
by outcrops of rock.
As if fascinated by the spec¬
tacle beneath it, the small one-
engined plane slowly circles over
the huge designs a pelican 285
metres long, a guanay (guano
bird) of 280 metres, a lizard of
180 metres (cut in two by the
Pan-American highway!). The
number of these large etchings in
the soil and the period of time
over which they made from the
fourth century B.C. to the fifth
century A.D. are equally
astounding. Virtually invisible
from the surface, they can only
be fully taken in from the air.
Their existence was unknown for
centuries, and even today they are
an archaeological enigma.

this sun-scorched and windswept
region of the world? What is the
meaning of their designs?
A COMPLEX CULTURE
Although the spiritual universe
of the Nazca children of the off¬
shore winds blowing in from the
Pacific and ancestors of the Iluari
culture is still shrouded in mys¬
tery, sufficient vestiges of their
culture and craftsmanship have
survived for us to answer the first
question. If the early ceremonial
centre of Kawachi is included,
their territory extended between
the rivers Grande and Nazca. It
included the oases of the Ingenio
and Palpa river valleys situated
between the cordillera of the
Andes and the Pacific and the
uninhabited alluvial plains
stretching between the towns of
Palpa and Nazca, where the geo-
glyphs are to be found.
It is in this inhospitable
region one of the most arid on
the planet that the Nazca devel¬
oped a complex and industrious
culture. Much of their history is
reflected in their craft produc¬
tion, such as textiles, beaten gold
artefacts and above all funerary
pottery, in which they used as
many as seven colours, whose dif¬
ferent shades mark an amazing
contrast with the austere tones of
the surrounding desert. The
National Archaeological Museum
of Peru has some 2,500 of these
ceramic pieces, which have a per¬
fect finish and are in an excellent
slate of preservation owing to the
region's dry atmosphere.
Further proof of the level of
development reached by the
Nazca can be seen in the vast
hydraulic engineering works
which they built to make up for
the shortage of water and fertilize

the land and which are still in
working order. They form an
extensive network of underground
channels, sometimes conveying the
water for kilometres before
emerging from time to time in
superbly designed wells known as
puquios. Seen from the sky, these
lines of funnel-shaped cavities spi¬
ralling into the earth appear to
stitch together whole stretches
of the valley.
AN IMMENSE SLATE MADE OF SAND
Over the eight centuries during
which they were created, the geo-
glyphs seem to have evolved from
figurative motifs to increasingly
geometrical and symbolic patterns.
Whether or not this is the case,
two main kinds of design can be
distinguished. The first category,
comprising some seventy items,
consists of drawings of animals and
plants. The largest and most spec¬
tacular concentration of animal sil¬
houettes is on the slopes of the
Ingenio river valley and includes a
monkey, a spider, a dog, a hum¬
ming-bird and a killer whale. The
few human figures, such as the
thirty-metre-tall "astronaut" or
owl-man etched into a hillside near
Jumana, are creatures of fantasy.
Other drawings depict flowers,
plants or twisted trees, and every-

day objects, such as a weaver's
loom.
These figurative motifs moved
towards a more consolidated sym¬
bolic form, which gave rise to the
second category of geoglyphs.
These are lines which look as if
they have been traced with a ruler
and cut through the plain, some¬
times for kilometres on end, to
form a variety of geometrical fig¬
ures such as triangles, spirals and
rectangles. Others span outwards
from a central promontory or
encircle it like the quipu cords
used in Inca accounting systems.
Yet another group is formed of
"paths" for the guidance of peo¬
ple travelling on foot.
Most of the motifs, figurative
and geometrical alike, are found
on pottery and textiles dating from
the same period. Maria Reiche,
who spent many years studying the
Nazca lines, came to the conclu¬
sion that these geometrical draw¬
ings were symbolic writing in which
the same words were sometimes
written in giant characters and in
other instances in small letters.
The technique used by the
Nazca to produce these designs
was both simple and ingenious. All
they had to do was to rake back
the dark and gravelly topsoil to
uncover the much lighter-coloured
clay layer and to pile the waste
material in 30-centimetre-high
banks on either side of the line.
The high degree of oxidation of
the soil and the moist winds at
night, which clean out the furrows
clogged with sand by the winds
blowing during the day, have pro¬
tected the Nazca lines until the
present time. In addition to these
engraved intaglio-like designs are
some executed in relief and oth¬
ers, which are much older, incised
into the sides of mountains.

IIow did the Nazca solve the
problems of scale? According to
Maria Beiehe, they had plans on
which they plotted short dis¬
tances, which they then had only
to multiply and transpose using
stakes and ropes like a gigantic
set of compasses. The precision
of the measurements and angles
shows that they had a thorough
command of geometry.
THE MYSTERY UNVEILED?
When the Peruvian scholar Mejia
Xesspe first saw the Nazca lines
in 1926, shortly after their acci¬
dental discovery, he thought that
they were "sacred roads", since
some of them were like paths along
which it was possible to walk.
However, it was not until 1911 that
the first scientific exploration mis¬
sion was organized under the direc¬
tion of the American historian Paul
Kosok, with the assistance of the
Peruvian air force.
On 22 June 1941, the shortest
day of the year in the southern
hemisphere, Kosok noticed that
the sun set precisely at the end
of one of the lines. He concluded
that it was a solstice line and thus
came to regard the Nazca geo-
glyphs as being the world's biggest
astronomy book.
The following year, Kosok
returned to Nazca with Maria
Reiche, a German translator from
Lima. Stunned by the spectacle
and intrigued by the mystery of

the geoglyphs, she was to spend
the rest of her life elucidating the
enigma of Nazca and protecting
the site.
According to Reiche, who eon-
firmed this aspect of Kosok's the¬
ory, the Nazca lines are a gigantic
astronomical calendar recording
the passing of the seasons and pre¬
dicting eclipses of the sun and the
moon. In her book Contribuciones a
la geometría y astronomía en el
antiguo Perú" (1993, "Contribu¬
tions of ancient Peru to the history

of geometry and astronomy"), she
wrote: "The Nazca knew about
the movements of the heavenly
bodies and knew how to calculate
exactly when to start sowing and
when to gather in the harvest.
They can accordingly claim to have
their place in the history of astron¬
omy". In her opinion, the stars
were the template for the orien¬
tation of the Nazca lines. The 46-
metre long spider, for example,
was connected with the constella¬
tion of Orion and the spectacular
110-metre-long monkey with the
Pleiades.
However, the theories of Kosok
and Reiche are countered by
research conducted by the astro¬
physicist Gerald S. Hawkins, who
in 1967 reconstituted by com¬
puter the changes in the map of
the sky in the Nazca region over
the past 7,000 years. He demon¬
strated that 80 per cent of the
geoglyphs bear no relation to the
movement of the forty-five main
heavenly bodies in the sky over
Nazca and that only thirty-nine
lines coincide with the movements
of the sun and moon.
OPEN-AIRTEMPLES
Disregarding the far-fetched the¬
ories of Erich von Daniken, Hunt
Williamson and others, who
looked upon the lines as landing
strips meant to be seen from the
sky by extraterrestrial creatures,
most scientists now agree that the
geoglyphs performed a ritual
function connected with astron¬
omy. The designs were probably
totemic representations connected
with the organization of elans (ayl-
lus), which helped to maintain the
social and religious hegemony of
the Nazca over the centuries.
Some archaeologists regard the
designs as fantastic open-air tem¬
ples which made it possible for the
people to enter into communion
with the cosmic force of the spirit
they represented. It is true that
most of the drawings have a clearly
identifiable "entrance". For exam
ple, it is possible to start out from
the eoiled-up tail of the monkey
design, which like the others is
formed by a single unbroken line,
and follow the whole figure in out¬
line right back to the starting
point. It can be readily surmised
that such continuity must have
had a ritual purpose.
Like a large map of the celes¬
tial world, these lines on the
pampa challenge us not only to
decipher their meaning but also to
preserve them in an environment so
fragile that every footprint leaves
its mark. Through Maria Reiche's
endeavours, a viewing platform
has been built for visitors, but this
does not prevent motor vehicles
from driving on the existing tracks
and leaving indelible tyre-marks
in the landscape. Unless the nec¬
essary protection measures are
taken, this exceptional archaeo¬
logical site, which has come down
to us intact after more than 2,000
years, could disappear forever in
the space of a few decades.
Some theorists have
maintained that
these long straight
lines traced In the
desert indicate
landing strips for
extraterrestrial
creatures.
