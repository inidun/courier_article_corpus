EDITORIAL
I HE interview which opens this issue has a symbolic
importance that will be evident to all our readers. Amos Oz is a
great Israeli novelist, deservedly taking his place among the
leading artists, scientists and writers from every corner of the
globe whom the UNESCO Courier welcomes to its pages month
by month. He has also been in the forefront of efforts to achieve
peace between Israelis and Palestinians, peace that has so
suddenly, so unexpectedly, ceased to be a dream and become an
ongoing political and economic process. Amos Oz has been in
the vanguard of those who have, at great risk to themselves,
reconnoitred the no-man's-land where dream and reality for so
long tried in vain to meet.
This issue also carries a dossier on UNESCO's General
Conference. The session that opened on 25 October, as well as
considering the Organization's programme and budget for the
next two years, will also see the election for the post of Director-
General. We have taken the opportunity to focus on some of the
issues and projects that are being discussed during the
Conference and to present Federico Mayor's views on this
turning point in the life of UNESCO.
Last but not least, the main theme of the issue is the origin of
numbers and the numeration systems that are among the great
intellectual inventions of humanity. The articles have been
written by specialists who were asked to explain in terms
accessible to those of us who may not be of a mathematical turn
of mind some of the latest findings of scientific research in their
field. We hope you will agree with us that they have successfully
risen to the challenge. I
