. ain international advisory and
information service for na-
tions carrying on campaigns
against illiteracy and low living
standards has now been put into
operation by Unesco. The recent
opening of this"associated pro-
jects system", as it is termed,
places on a formal basis the assis-
tance which the organization has
been rendering agencies and pro-
grammes dealing in fundamental
education over past years.
Fundamental education pro-
grammes in seven countries of
Asia, Latin America and Africa are
now recognized as"associated pro-
jects". As such, they are to
receive assistance from Unesco in
three forms.
Firstly, the organization will
supply them with documentation
on most recent developments in
their fields-an important service
for educators who must often work
in isolated regions.
Secondly, Unesco has opened an
enquiry service to work on any
problems they encounter in their
own work. And, thirdly, six Unesco
field advisers are available for
service in projects requesting their
help, for periods up to six months.
One of the most important
aspects of the system is its"two-
way"flow of knowledge. It is
expected that data furnished by
educators in the field will be of
extreme importance in seeking the
answers to such fundamental
education problems as teaching
literacy in countries where peoples
speak a vernacular often complete-
ly different from the official lan-
guage taught in schools.

A AGENCIES and programmeswhich were the first to be
included in the associated pro-
jects system emphasise its already
wide scope.
In the Union of South Africa for
example, there is the Division of
Soil Conservation and Extension of
the Department of Agriculture.
This division, which has been
modelled after the extension
service of the United States
Department of Agriculture, advises
farmers and conducts test demon-

strations of techniques aimed at
increasing food production, such
as irrigation, crop rotation and
terracing.
India is represented so far by the
Delhi State Pilot Project in Adult
Education. Here, an Indian state
has begun the task of improving
living conditions in all 305 of its
villages by training a corps of 250
teachers to begin teaching approxi-
mately 125, 000 illiterates. The
teachers, drawn from the villages
themselves, are being trained at a
college where surrounding villages
are used for field work. Unesco
has already provided aid for the
programme.
In the Philippines, the agency
concerned is the National Federa-
tion of Parent Teachers Associa-
tions. The Federation is conduc-
ting literacy classes for some 10, 000
pupils and, at the same time, it
is striving to introduce better
facilities for health, sanitation and
recreation in rural villages.
A V øriety of WeøpoDs
TD RAZIL'S nation-wide adult edu-cation campaign is also inclu-
ded. This campaign is attacking
adult illiteracy with a variety of
weapons-literacy classes, radio
programmes, portable film projec-
tors (there are 1, 600 of these in
operation) and mobile libraries
mounted on motor vans.
Another Latin American project
is that of Viani in Colombia,
which already has received the
services of Unesco advisers. At
Viani, education is being put to
work to find solutions to the pro-
blems of farming on mountainous
land subject to erosion
In Colombia's neighbouring state,
Ecuador, the rural cultural exten-
sion service, organized in April,
1950, is also included. Here, again,
mobile missions are being used to
b r i n g educational facilities to
regions with insufficient schools,
always driving home the benefits
the rural dweller will derive from
his new knowledge in his daily life.
Finally, there is the night school
programme of the Dominican
Republic, which is aimed mainly at
reaching adult illiterates in towns
and cities.
These programmes are only a
beginning. At present, there are
75 more requests for inclusion in
the"associated projects"system
on hand and Unesco is in a posi-
tion to service up to 100 projects
this year. It has been pointed out,
however, that requests for inclu-
sion must be received by April 15,
if the project is to be considered
under the 1951 programme.
