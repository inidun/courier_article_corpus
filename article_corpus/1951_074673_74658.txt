"CULTURE MUST
BE ONE OF THE
FOUNDATIONS
FOR WORLD
UNDERSTANDING"
by
PROFESSOR
ALBERT EINSTEIN
IN order to grasp the fullsignificance of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
it is well to be fully aware of the
world situation that gave birth to the
United Nations and to Unesco.
The devastation wrought by the wars
of the last half century had brought
home the fact to everybody that,
with the present-day level of technical
achievement, the security of nations
could be based only on supra-
national institutions and rules of
conduct. It understood that, in the
long run, an all-destroying conflict
can be avoided only by the setting
up of a world federation of nations.
So-as a modest beginning of
international order-the United
Nations was founded. This organiz-
ation, however, is but a meeting
ground for delegates of national
governments and not for the peoples'
representatives acting independently
on the basis of their own personal
convictions. Furthermore, U. N.
decisions do not have binding force
on any national government ; nor
do any concrete means exist by
which the decisions can be enforced.
The effectiveness of the United
Nations is still further reduced by
the fact that membership has been
refused to certain nations, whose
exclusion seriously affects the supra-
character of the organization. Yet,
in itself, the fact that international
problems are brought up and dis-
cussed in the broad light of day fa-
vours the peaceful solution of con-
flicts. The existence of a supra-
national platform of discussion is apt
to accustom the peoples gradually
to the idea that national interests
must be safeguarded by negotiation
and not by brute force.
This psychological or educa-
tional effect I regard as the United
Nations'most valuable feature. A
world federation presupposes a new
kind of loyalty on the part of man,
a sense of responsibility that does
not stop short at the national bound-
aries. To be truly effective, such
loyalty must embrace more than
purely political issues. Understand-
ing among different cultural groups,
mutual economic and cultural aid
are the necessary additions.
Only by such endeavour will the
feeling of confidence be established
that was lost owing to the psychol-
ogical effect of the wars and sapped
by the narrow philosophy of militar-

ism and power politics. No effective
institution for the collective security
of nations is possible without
understanding and a measure of
reciprocal confidence.
To the U. N. was added Unesco,
the agency whose function it is to
pursue these cultural tasks. It has
in a greater measure than U. N.
been able to avoid the paralyzing
influence of power politics.
Realizing that healthy international
relations can be created only among
populations made up of individuals
who themselves are healthy and
enjoy a measure of independence,
the United Nations elaborated a
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which was adopted by the
U. N. General Assembly on 10
December, 1948.
The Declaration establishes a
number of universally comprehen-
sible standards that are designed to
protect the individual, to prevent
his being exploited economically,
and to safeguard his development
and the free pursuit of his activities
within the social framework.
To spread these standards among
all U. N. Member States is rightly
regarded and aimed at as an impor-
tant objective. Unesco has accord-
ingly instituted this third celebration
for the purpose of drawing attention
far and wide to these fundamental
aspirations as a basis on which to
restore the political health of the
peoples.
It was scarcely to be avoided that
the Declaration should take the
form of a legalistic document, which
in its rigidity may lead to endless
discussion. It is impossible for such
a text to take the great diversity of
conditions of life in the different
countries fully into account ; in ad-
dition, it is unavoidable that such a
text admits various interpretations of
detail. The general tendency of the
Declaration, however, is unmistak-
able and provides a suitable,
generally acceptable basis for judg-
mend and action.
To give formal recognition to
standards and to adopt them as the
guiding lines of action in the teeth
of all the adversities of a changing
situation are two very different
things-as the impartial observer may
see particularly in the history of
religious institutions. Then and only
then will the Declaration exert
effective influence, when the United
Nations itself shows by its decisions
and actions that it does embody, de
facto, the spirit of this, its own
Declaration.
