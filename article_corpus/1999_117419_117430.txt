“Condom Night” in Bangkok.
A survey conducted in Thailand for the British
c o n t r a c e p t i ve firm Durex, published in
December 1998, showed that 60 per cent of
those questioned used condoms. Polls taken by
UNAIDS among 21-year-old Thai men found that use
of condoms in brothels in northern Thailand rose
from 61 per cent to 93 per cent between 1991 and
1995, while the number of customers fell by half.
Such changes in sexual behaviour are two solid
results of  T h a i l a n d ’s large-scale effort to fight A i d s.
Even before the first case was detected in Thailand in
1 9 8 4 , Mechai V i r ava i d ya (“Mr. C o n d o m ” ) , a fa m i l y
planning pioneer and founder of the Population and
Community Development A s s o c i at i o n , was publicly
s i n ging the praises of condoms. At first he was accused
of tarnishing the country ’s image, but then he wa s
c o n gr at u l ated for his major contri bution to halting the
spread of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and
Aids.
Non-governmental organizations were the first to
support his work but were quickly overwhelmed.The
rapid spread of such diseases spurred the government
to launch a broad mobilization campaign. In 1992, it
announced a three-year plan to monitor and fight A i d s.
By 1996,the plan’s budget had risen to $82.3 million,
an initiative unmatched in any other country.
Coordinated by the ministry of health, preventive
e d u c ation was gradually taken over by civil society as a
w h o l e . By 1990, e ven before the plan was launched,
television had become the chief source of inform at i o n ,
with the broadcasting of expensive advertising spots.
Rural communities set up solidarity funds and Bud-
dhist monks opened their temples to ill people
rejected by their families.The religious association
Sangha Metta, based at the Buddhist Unive rsity of
M a h a m a k u t , at Chiang Mai, has so far trained more
than 500 monks and nuns to work in preve n t i o n
and treatment.
In most towns, people with Aids or HIV took
a c t i o n . The New Life Friends associat i o n , set up
in 1993, has several hundred members and is doing
an impressive job of raising awa r e n e s s , e s p e c i a l l y
in schools. M a ny members are now teaching classes
about the disease.
Complacency 
and budget cuts
From the early 1990s, clinics specializing in
t r e ating STDs, whose patients were mostly wo r-
king in the sex industry, generously handed out free
condoms and pushed brothel ow n e rs to encourage
their use.This programme,launched on a national
scale in 1991 and known as the “100 per cent
Condom Campaign” is the key to Thailand’s suc-
c e s s , according to W i wat Rochapichaya k h o n , t h e
UNAIDS director for the Asia-Pacific region.
But prevention has flagged for the past two
years for several reasons. Rochapichayakhon says
people have taken for granted the progress and
h ave become complacent. The head of the
European Union’s Aids programme in Thailand,
Alessio Panza, blames a new policy of targeting
specific groups rather than conducting a mass
campaign. The chief of the Aids department in
the Thai health ministry, Chaiyos Kunanusont,
claims that the economic and financial crisis that
erupted in 1997 is responsible. The budget to
prevent the disease has been cut by a quarter, he
complains.
The effect of the economic crisis on the epide-
mic is unclear.Will the newly-unemployed end up
working in the brothels of Patpong and Pat t aya? Or
will the falling standard of living mean fewer cus-
tomers and so less demand for new sex workers?
One thing is cert a i n : the thousands of people retur-
ning to the countryside after losing their jobs in the
t owns are already causing sexual health problems in
the north and northeast of Thailand. n
