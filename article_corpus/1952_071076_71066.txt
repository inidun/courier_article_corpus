THE bazaars of Baghdad on ahot summer day are not as
romantic as some of us may
have been led to think. There is
colour enough, it is true. Vendors
move leisurely about selling their
gay and exotic wares. The costumes
and the strange music weave much
the kind of spell the average tourist
expects. But it is really poor stuff
compared to the glory and glamour
which once belonged to this part of
the world.
For in its heyday, this region
was the centre of a great civilization
and power. Some 70 miles to the
south lay the ancient city of
Babylon, with its magnificent imper-
ial palace, its priceless art treasures
and the famous Hanging Gardens
said to have been one of the Seven
Wonders of the World. Somewhere
to the south of here, too, is reputed
to have been the Garden of Eden-
the cradle of mankind.
Once, the whole region between
the Tigris and Euphrates was rich,
green and productive. A system of
canals carried water wherever it
was needed. At the height of its
glory, Babylon was even called the
"granary of the world". But there
is little evidence of it now.
Today the canals are gone-
broken, destroyed and buried
beneath the advancing sands. The
rich alluvial soil has drifted away,
carried off by the hot winds blowing
up from the Persian Gulf and by
every other wind that blows. Now
the desert presses in on all sides.
There is nothing unusual about
this. The same story could be told

in Syria, which holds some of the
grandest ruins of the ancient world
such as Baalbeck and the graveyard
of a"Hundred Dead Cities", an
area of about 1, 000, 000 acres lying
between Aleppo, Antioch and Hama.
It could be told in the Lebanon,
where the Forests of the Cedars
retreated before axe, fire, hoe and
the voracious black-eared goat, until
today only a few remnants of the
famous extensive forest are left.
The same story could be told in
Egypt and indeed wall over the
Middle East, in India, in China, in
North Africa and in the New World.
It happens everywhere that men
take from the soil and fail to replace
the vegetation that binds the soil,
or where the water is allowed to
rush indisciplined across the land.
As Dr. W. C. Lowdermilk, land
erosion consultant of the U. N. Food
and Agriculture Organization has
said, the problem is not so much one
of conquest of natural deserts as of
reconquest of man-made deserts
that have resulted from neglect and
misuse, where"the recklessness,
ignorance and hunger-drive of man
have supplemented the process of
wind and water erosion in destroy-
ing vegetation and soils, resulting
ill regional suicide."
"Mankind has strode across the
face of the earth for 7, 000 years,"
Dr. Lowdermilk adds,"reaping
where he has not planted and
destroying what he has not made.
In occupying new lands one after
the other, one section of mankind
has looted his fellows and'skimmed
off the cream'and left thin milk for
generations that follow. Man has
tended to destroy the sources of his
existence."
Thus, ancient Cyrenaica used to
produce three harvests a year ;
today it is largely unproductive, In
Australia, the semi-desert areas
are creeping forward and engulfing
the good land because of the
overstocking of cattle and deforesta-
tion. Every year, rivers in South
Africa and Latin America carry
millions of tons of top-soil into the
sea ; one can actually watch the
soil being carried away. Through
careless exploitation in the past,
vast areas of formerly good land
in the United States have become
unproductive"dust bowls". In
South Africa, the situation is
critical because of the merciless
exploitation by farmers and land-
owners. And according to conserva-
tion authorities, a national catas-
trophe due to soil erosion is perhaps
more imminent in South Africa
than in any other country.
Today more countries in the world
are confronted with problems caused
by aridity than by any other
characteristic of climate. It is
estimated that the arid and semi-
arid regions of the world make up
more than a quarter of the land
surface of the globe. There are
the extreme instances-like the
Central Sahara or Libyan deserts,
the Takla Makan in northwest
China, or the Rub'Al Khali in Saudi
Arabia-where practically nothing
grows and where a few nomads
survive under the most primitive
conditions. Only radical scientific
discoveries may some day make
these areas productive to man.
But fringing these deserts are
semi-arid areas which, except for
short rainy periods each year, are
dry as dust. They support a heavy
population whose people live only by
the most careful use of the water
and sources of power available.
Because of the enormous pressure
of increasing population, it is more
urgent than ever before that
the unproductive lands should be
brought back into the service of
mankind.
It is the same problem which
inspired the prophet to say :"In
the wilderness shall waters break
out, and streams in the desert. And
the glowing sands shall become a
pool, and the thirsty land springs of
water ; in the habitation of jackals
where they lay shall be grass with
reeds and rushes. And a highway
shall be there..."
The ancient prophets were the
wise men of their time. They kept
an eye on the community and it was
their business to see that provision
was made for the welfare of
future generations. They may have
lacked the scientific knowledge of
our days but they had judgment and
wisdom.
And now in the 20th century, the
call has gone out again to bring
water to the thirsty ground. For
at a time in history when popula-
tions are increasing at the rate of
some 55, 000 a day, civilization is
running a race against time and
famine.
The call is being answered,
however, with all the resources of
scientific knowledge and engineer-
ing. Governments in many coun-
tries are giving the problem
high priority. But unrelated local
attempts to wrest production from
the dry lands cannot be expected to
achieve the best results. This is a
case, if ever there was one,
for international co-operation and
exchange of experience.
At the General Conference of
Unesco at Beirut in 1948, the Indian
delegation put forward a proposal
which led Unesco to set up an
advisory research committee to
guide Unesco's arid zone pro-
gramme. This committee consists
of nine scientists from Australia,
Egypt, France, Great Britain, India,
Israel, Mexico, Peru and the U. A.
The committee saw two major
difficulties today impeding the world
struggle to make the lands of the
arid zones productive : lack of in-
formation on what is being done,
and insufficient research on the in-
ternational level. Unesco therefore
set itself two objectives :
First, to seek out and make
available all the experience and
expert knowledge gained from the
many experiments and projects
carried out in many parts of the
world.
Second, to help the development
and expansion of desert research
stations, so that they would devote
time and study to certain problems
affecting several countries at least.
Each year, Unesco selects a par-
ticular field of research for study.
The first field chosen, in 1951, was
water-the one problem common
(Continued on next page.)
ARID ZONE

PUSHING BACK THE FRONTIERS OF THE DESERT
(Continued from"revious"age.)
to all arid and semi-arid areas.
Hydrology concerns itself with both
water on the earth and below it,
but less is known about underground
water resources than surface water.
Scientists do know that there are
vast seas of underground water in
almost all areas of the world
including deserts, but much is
still to be done on studying these
resources.
Unesco therefore commissioned
eight scientists to study and report
on current research on this subject.
Last April, an international sympos-
ium of scientists met at Ankara,
Turkey, to discuss their findings.
The results will provide research
workers with the first comprehen-
sive picture of what is being done
to find out how underground water
behaves, and the possibilities of
using it effectively in arid zones.
But water is not the only problem
or the only answer for the parched
lands of our planet."The signi-
ficant characteristic of the arid
zone,"said the Indian delegate at
Unesco's Beirut Conference in 1948,
"is that it is constantly expanding
and is sterilizing the adjacent fertile
and cultivable areas at a consider-
able pace."The search for improv-
ed plant species for agriculture to
halt the world's marching sands is
one of the most important problems.
That is why Unesco has chosen
plant ecology-the relation of
plants to their environment-as
the special arid zone research theme
for this year. A group of ten plant
ecologists are surveying this ques-
tion and assembling experimental
and research data on promising
species and strains which thrive
under dry conditions in one area
and which may be profitably
introduced into others.
Australia offers an interesting
example of the introduction of
plants native to other areas.
Dr. B. T. Dickson, plant physiologist
from that country, pointed this out
at a symposium on desert research
held in Jerusalem last May under
the auspices of the Research Council
of Israel, in co-operation with
Unesco. He made the following
revealing statement :"Every cereal,
vegetable and fruit crop now grown
has been introduced, none is
indigenous. So too have been many
pasture grasses and legumes, parti-
cularly for better rainfall areas.
"One may hear joking reference
to the need to find pasture plants
which will remain green all the
year round without water, and
which can be sown from a saddle
bag and can establish themselves
readily. The point is that new
plants, to have a bare chance of
establishment, must be in equili-
brium with the environment, in
other words, immigrants capable of
ready naturalization. To expect
more is to end in frustration."
Unesco is also interested in
research projects for developing
sources of power in arid zones by
utilizing wind and solar energy, and
will probably study this question
fully next year.
The U. N. expanded technical
assistance programme for economic
development has provided a large
number of missions directly
concerned with the development of
the arid zone. In the arid Marbial
Valley of Haiti, the World Health
Organization and the Food and
Agriculture Organization have
joined Unesco in demonstrating
how to improve agricultural and
health methods, avoid erosion and
care for the soil. In Libya, a joint
FAO-Unesco mission is studying
plans for the expansion of the Sidi
Mesri arid zone research station.
The FAO is now engaged in a
gigantic international battle with
desert locusts. The most dangerous
plague of desert locusts for more
than a century has attacked crops
from the Nile Delta to India, 1
threatening to destroy the whole
food supply of half-a-dozen agricul-
tural countries. The locusts have
made a single feeding ground out
of extensive areas in French
Somaliland, Eritrea, the Sudan,
Aden, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Iraq,
Iran and Pakistan.
To meet this threat, international
action has been organized on a scale
unprecedented in peacetime, the
FAO reports. From Turkey, Syria,
Lbanon, Irak, Saudi Arabia and
Egypt aid has come to help save the
crops of Jordan, one of the most'seriously infested lands. India,
Pakistan, U. S. A. and U. S. S. R. have
sent insecticides and equipment to
Iran where more than 200, 000, 000
acres are infested with desert locust
eggs.
Reports reach Unesco from all
corners of the earth telling of
national governments sponsoring
projects to save or reclaim their land.
In Cyprus, large-scale erosion has
been checked by destroying herds of
wild goats and planting trees on the
steep hillsides. Turkey is establish-
ing an institute of hydrology and
geology which will organize research
and teaching on problems of the use
of underground water for its semi-
arid central region.
Research work on the arid regions
and research stations are being
strengthened in places as far distant
as India and Chile, Australia and the
Sahara desert. Eight of these have
now been linked up directly with
Unesco's programe of research de-
velopment. They are in Algeria,
Egypt, French West Africa, India,
Israel and the United States. In
addition to co-ordinating their re-
search with Unesco, these centres
will accept visiting scientists and
fellowship holders in arid zone ques-
tions. By also exchanging their
scientists and technicians with other
institutions carrying out related
work, they will become the nucleus
of the first team of internationally-
trained arid zone specialists.
By the sharing of engineers and
scientific knowledge on an interna-
tional scale, all nations have a chance
of turning a world of want into a
world of plenty. For all nations are
interdependent in the fight for food
and life.
