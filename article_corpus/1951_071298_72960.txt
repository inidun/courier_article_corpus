MARCINE :
BIGGEST
"FAMILY"
ON the outskirts of Charleroi, inthe heart of Belgium's"black
country", a trim little com-
munity of ultra-modern homes laid
out over 30 acres of gardens and
playgrounds contrasts sharply with
the background of towering steel
mill chimneys and coal mine
shaftheads.
Only one thing in the communi-
ty's appearance help to distinguish
it from a typical modern suburban
development project-its gateway
whose arch bears the words,
"City de l'Enfance" (The Chil-
dren's City). Living in its neat
little houses today are 330 orphans
and children of war refugees
- children who had never known
a proper home, but who have now
found an ideal one.
The movement responsible for
the City is the"Inter-Community
Organization for Social. Works"
(Intercommunal d'CEuvre Social)
of the Charleroi region, which has
been set up by the people of Char-
leroi and of thirty-two neighbour-
ing communities. To provide homes
for the children in the City at
Marcinelle, a suburb of Charleroi,
costs the inhabitants of these
thirty or so communities the sum
of ten Belgian francs ($ 0. 20) per
capita each year. In addition, the
City receives a subsidy from the
Belgian Government.
The reason for the City's foun-
dation and development has been
explained by M. Ren√© de Cooman,
president of the Board of directors,
as"a desire to create a home where
orphans would live in an atmo-
sphere and under conditions as
far removes, as possible from those
of an'institution'."
The result was a community of
twenty-one, two-storey homes, each
housing no more than sixteen
children with an individual coun-
selor in each home.
The Children Understood
THE houses are ultra-modern inappearance and in equipment,
with electric kitchens, central
heating, hot and cold running
water, and tiled bathrooms.
"When we planned these
houses,"M. de Cooman recalls,
"people told us they were too good
tor the children, but we maintained
that children would understand
PLENTY OF PLAYMATES. Children have no time to feel alone in the world when they have
over 300"brothers and sisters"to join them in games and sports.
what we were trying to do for them
and would respect their homes,"
Proof of this came in rather an
unusual way. As the result of the
war, some children had to be
moved into an unfinished house, in
the early years of the City, before
the furniture was varnished and
the walls plastered. This particu-
lar house suffered more damage
from unruliness among the
children than others which were
opened in an already perfect state.
The City is equipped with a
gymnasium, a wading pool, sand
beaches and workshops where its
adolescent citizens can learn to
become cabinet-makers, electri-
cians, bakers, gardeners, tailors
and shoemakers.
If a child shows promise, he is
encouraged to continue his studies
for such professions as medicine
or law."Our children have as
much right to choose their careers
! lS those who are lucky enough to
have wealthy parents,"explains
M. de Cooman.
Children's Ambassador
AT present, the City's inhabi-tants range from three to
twenty-five years of age, but
plans are being made to accom-
modate even younger ones in a
new nursery now being completed.
The older members of the commu-
nity often work outside in Char-
leroi and live in the City just as
they would in an ordinary home.
Children below the age of twelve
live in houses with dormitory-style
sleeping quarters. Above the age
of twelve, however, each child has
a room to himself, complete with
an individual washstand. In some
cases, the care given by the City
to infants begins almost as soon as
they are born. One young girl has
been in the City ever since her
mother abandoned her in the
maternity ward of a hospital.
M. de Cooman, who was recently
elected president of the Interna-
tional Federation of Children's
Communities, an organization
working in close co-operation with
Unesco, is a Belgian industrialist
and an"ambassador"for the Mar-
cinelle Children's City.
Following a recent meeting of
the International Federation at
Unesco House in Paris, he described
a new development at Marcinelle
designed to enable the City to
extend its help to children even
after they have grown up and
left it.
By the early part of 1951, M. de
Cooman explained, the City will
begin a policy of extending
long-term, no-interest loans to
give youngsters a chance to set
themselves up in business. If a
boy learns his trade as, say, a
baker or a plumber, the City will
be able to advance him the money
to open his own shop. The money,
paid back in instalments, will be
used as a revolving fund to give
future"citizens"a start in the
world.
For other reasons too, the
Children's City of Marcinelle is
held in affection by children who
have lived within its walls. Young
men or women, leaving the city to
marry and set up a home, always
receive a wedding present from
the board of directors. At present,
the City is busy making plans for
the marriage of one of its girl
citizens. At the wedding the entire
population of more than 300
children will be present as mem-
bers of the bride's"family".
Ever-Open Gates
THE boys and girls of Marcinelleare proud to belong to such a
united family. Their affection
for it is perhaps best symbolized by
the City's ever-open gates. It is
just as easy to leave as to enter,
and although children have been
known to run away during their
first few days-before they had
had time to settle down-no one
has ever wanted to leave after
living there for several weeks.
That, for the men and women
who run the City is the best proof
that they have created a real
home for children who today no
longer consider themselves as
"orphans".

GATEWAY TO A CITY and to a home where the family spirit dominates every activity end the word"orphan"seems to lose its meaning.
