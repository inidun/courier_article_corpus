What a French
village thinks
of the
foreigner
by Lucien Bernot
and René Blancard
N
ouville is* a real French village, but you won't
find it marked on any map of France. The name
was used to hide the identity of a typical French
village where experts from Unesco and from the
Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, in Paris, made
a detailed study of its people and their opinions.
While the complete report««Nouville, un village
français," by Lucien Bernot and René Blancard (I)
covered a great deal of ground, the following article
is taken from one of the chapters, entitled : "What
do the people of Nouville think about foreigners?"
Who do these villagers regard as "foreigners" ?
For them, the foreigner is not only someone who
lives outside the borders of France. It is anyone
who does not belong to the family, the village or
the region. It is ««he" as opposed to ««we". It

can apply both to the far-off Chinaman and the
close-at-hand Parisian. Recalling childhood mem¬
ories, one villager told an investigator: ««When I
went to fetch the milk in the evening I was uneasy ;
I wasn't afraid of the French people, but of the
Bretons."
Foreigners, then, are the people of whom the vil¬
lagers say: "We don't visit one another. It's not
that we are on bad terms with them ; we simply ex¬
change a «good day' or a «good evening'nothing
more."
Yet not all the distinctions made by the "Nouvil-
lois" are black or white. ««Of course they are not
foreigners", they say of some people, «'they live in
France, don't they?"
Here, directly, sometimes awkwardly and often
bluntly, but always with a ring of sincerity, which
marks a simplicity of ideas, is what the people of
Nouville think about foreigners.

Unesco Courier. N" 6. 1955
When the Municipal Council of Nouville heard that two
investigators were being sent to the village by Unesco,
several Councillors asked "What's Unesco?". The
general concensus of opinion was "It's one of those U.N.
thingumajigs; an international organization run by the
Americans."
When we did arrive one of the villagers told us: "We
expected to see two dark-suited officials ride up in a magni¬
ficent American car complete with chauffeur. We were
surprised when you came by train." The school-teacher's
comment, on hearing that one of us had paid a visit to the
village by bicycle a few days earlier, was: "Good, that shows
they are the athletic type."
The one idea that everyone had of us at first was that we
must have plenty of money. People we met asked: "Who's
paying you ? The Government? The
Americans?" One Councillor later
admitted to us: "At first, I was
suspicious. I thought you had been
sent down by some Conservatives. Then
I saw you weren't dealing with politics
and you were talking with the working
people; you weren't stand-offish."
We ran into sharper, more intense
opposition in a hamlet which we visited
later than the rest of the commune.
When some of the inhabitants found
we were there, they asked their coun¬
cillor what we were up to and his reply
was: "They are here as representatives
of some international affair." This cau¬
sed some people to remark "The inter¬
national people are the Russians.
We'd better be careful. These fellows
are the eye of Moscow".
. When one of us asked a workman in
this hamlet for some information, he
replied: "You're not pumping me for
any information. I almost got stood
up against a wall in the last war. And
if I wasn't it was only because I kept
my mouth shut."
Others were more polite, but still
refused to give any information: "I've
got nothing against you; you go ahead
and do your job, but I've nothing to
tell you.""Why?""Because the whole
thing's anti..""Anti what?""Anti...
'. it's not pro anything..."
As a whole, the first reaction of the
people of Nouville was that we might
be spies.
"In 1940 people like that came round
asking questions. And then we had
the war a little later on." They still
tell the story of the butcher from Sou-
zoir who used to make deliveries before
1939 and who turned out to be a Nazi
spy; he was seen during the war in German uniform.
Eventually, this suspicion around us died away; the inha¬
bitants of Nouville were reassured by articles in the press.
"They're in the newspapers", they told one another, "so they
can't be spies."
A Councillor's wife remarked to me: "Unesco is the same
as the U.N., and all that sort of thing's tied up with
foreigners... We've got too many foreigners in France,
that's why you get so many spies."
Someone else from the same hamlet said: "Don't you pay
any attention to what people here think; they're stupid;
you're talking to somebody now who really knows what
Unesco is. It's an American outfit." (sic)
We explained that he was wrong, that Unesco was an inter¬
national organization, and that in any case we were working
under the direction of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,
of Paris. This person was quite ready to believe us, and the
continued: "During the war I sheltered an
American airman. We hid him for several months and then
he managed to escape. After the Liberation we got a short
letter of thanks. I don't want to make anything of it, but do
you think they sent us any parcels? Not even one... You
can tell them so when you see them."
On the whole, the people received us in a friendly way, but
no one would ever admit that Unesco could be anything but
an American organization. Several Councillors asked us if it
would be possible to get some assistance for the commune
through Unesco. One of the Nouville representatives, intro¬
ducing us to a glass manufacturer, said to him, "Here are
two gentlemen from Unesco. It's an honour for us to have
them here... and maybe they'll be able to be of use to you in
your business."
It is possible to distinguish several categories of foreigners
within the commune, but the "conscious" meaning which
both adults and children give to the word "foreigner" is:
someone who is not French. A test made on second year and
(Photo Christian Baugey)
final year secondary school pupils bore this out for the majo¬
rity of the boys and girls. In a few isolated cases, it is also
used to indicate someone from outside the village.
An analysis of the answers gave the following definitions
of the term "foreigner": First, someone speaking another
language than French; secondly, someone wearing different
clothes; and finally someone who does not know the district.
We found that the idea which people.form of foreigners is
determined more by what is known about them, through the
press and radio, than by any fears or hopes they may inspire.
Not all foreigners are thought of in the same way or seen
in the same perspective. When people speak (well) of the
British or (ill) of the Germans, they do so by evoking the
past. But Americans and Russians are considered in the
light of current events. People speak of them in the present
tense, calculate the chances of their "leaving us in peace or
not", and think of the future. Their views of these two
foreign peoples depend on public opinion, that
is, on the degree of fear which either of these (Cont'd on

A second group of nations, such as the Belgians, the

J_ iNALLY there is a third
type of foreigner, the attitude
towards him being quite
distinct. It includes the
Chinese, the Japanese, the Indians who live in far-off, di¬
stant lands and whom no one fears. The people of Nouville
have no strong feelings about them either way, yet at the
same time they regard them as backward, and also cruel
views based on what they have read. Opinions about these
countries may therefore be favourable or unfavourable. In
either case, though, no strong emotional feelings are involv¬
ed, and the inhabitants readily admit that they may be
mistaken, that they "'saw it in a book".

cribed. The first was:
T
	 wo questions were put
to the people of Nouville. The
replies reflect the three cate¬
gories of foreigners just des-
"Of the following peoples, underline the names of those
you like most and strike out those you like least: Americans,
Belgians, Chinese, English, Germans, Jews, Russians, Spa¬
niards, Swiss, Jugoslavs, Israelites."
The answers (shown at the top of the next column) reveal
no great differences of opinion between farmers and
workers. Some, however, simply underlined the names of
peoples for whom they had the most friendly feelings, or
underlined or crossed out only a few names:
This question listed the two names, Jews and Israelites.
Some of the inhabitants of Nouville did not know the second
term, but this hardly changed the result at all.
In the second question, the inhabitants were given 14 brief
sentences containing descriptive adjectives or phrases, such
as "the... are trustworthy", "the... are untrustworthy", "the...
want war", etc. They were asked to write in the name of the
foreigners they considered most fitting in each case. The
replies are shown in columns two and three of these pages.

No great advantage can be gained from considering all
these replies globally as they indicate no valid conclusion.
This system was unsuited to the people of Nouville. Some
used their children's geography books to refresh their memo¬
ries and to obtain the names of 14 different peoples so as to
complete the questionnaire!*
jflhftt *
w e shall therefore li¬
mit our comments to .those
results borne out by our
personal experience, noting
those peoples whose names recurred most frequently in
conversation during our stay with the villagers.
There is very little spontaneous discussion about Jews, but
when the villagers were asked to strike out from a list of
peoples those they liked least, a large number struck out the
word "Jew". Yet, no active or systematic antisemitism was
involved. Several men from Nouville had Jewish friends in
the army and still spoke of them: "They were just like
everybody else." In our opinion, if Jews were to settle in the
community, they would not be regarded any differently from
the other inhabitants. The opinions about Jews reflect ste¬
reotype thinking.

A young woman who
had recently arrived in Nou¬
ville attracted attention be¬
cause of her olive complexion
and black hair. These were regarded as odd characteristics
and caused much speculation. Many people queried us
about her: "You are invited to her house, do you know where
she' comes from? What race, is she? What country does
she come from? I'll bet it's Indochina." Someone else
insisted that she came from North Africa. A third spe¬
culated: "She must be Jewish. They say she wore a yellow
star at Amiens during the occupation... But she's a
good Jew."
As a matter of fact, the woman's ancestors had been
citizens of Amiens for generations and never, so far as is
known, had any Indochinese, African or Jewish origins.
We asked someone who was criticizing the Jews, "Do you
know any?" He replied that he did not, apart from this
woman, "who must be Jewish but who is a nice person".

It is only through news sources that people can have any
knowledge of the Chinese. The opinions expressed about
them fall into the third category of "distant" foreigners,
already described. A few favourable answers were given
concerning them. These came from local communists or
communist sympathisers who were happy "to see a new
friendly nation". But, apart from these few cases, the
general opinion held of the Chinese is unfavourable, not
from a political point of view but because people have read
stories and articles about "those lands of mystery". We
heard people remark: "These Chinese must be a queer lot;
I shouldn't like to live with them." The idea most frequently
expressed is that the Chinese are "backward".
II. s for the views held of
the Americans and the Rus¬
sians, it was interesting to see
the extent to which an unfa¬
vourable opinion of one of those countries corresponded to
favourable opinion of the other.
Favourable to the Americans and unfavourable to
the Russians	34 %
Unfavourable both to the Americans and to the
Russians 34 %
Favourable both to the Americans and to the
Russians 7 %
Unfavourable to the Americans and favourable to
the Russians	25 %
The results thus obtained reflect three attitudes among
the people of Nouville and are in many cases dictated by fear
of a future war. We thus have:
Those friendly to the U.S.A.;
Those friendly to the U.S.S.R.;
Those who consider both countries equally responsible
for any future conflict.

A French village's views on foreigners
(Cont'd {rom page 19)
It has already been suggested that most of the time people's
ideas of foreigners come from daily news and from sources of
political information. It seemed of interest to correlate the
answers to the question "Are you interested in politics?"
with those to the two questions on foreigners. The answers
were:

This table does not take into account a few answers that
could not be fitted into this framework; e.g., to the question
"Are you interested in politics?", the reply "A little at election
time"; or, to the question about foreigners: "One people is as
good as another."
This table makes it clear that those who are interested in
politics replied, for the most part, to the two questions
concerning foreigners, while those who claim not to be
interested in politics fell into two groups those who replied
and those who did not.
*
O'pinions in respect of
foreigners spring from three
different ways of looking at
things. Yet, even though these
opinions may vary, behaviour is identical in the case of
most people in Nouville. Little aggressiveness is displayed
towards the foreigner; when it does appear, it is merely in
verbal terms and as a reaction to some unpleasant event; it
is not systematic.
The wealth of information from outside of Nouville
compared with the meagre information available within the
village, here assumes its full importance.
In practice, the news which comes to hand about foreign
countries, with little if anything in the way of explanation,
is passed around at Nouville in the form of gloomy remarks:
"Did you see what it said in the paper? Things don't look too
good !" . And so the question of foreigners imperceptibly be¬
comes the question of the difficulties between foreign coun¬
tries.
*
F or the inhabitants of
Nouville, the people in all
foreign countries are "'always
human beings", and, while
these countries are seen in an abstract way, they evoke a
concrete picture in the minds of these French villagers.
Their standard of reference is France, which also is a con¬
crete country made up of people, of Frenchmen, and the
feeling is that "these people are just the same as we are."
Thus, for the inhabitant of Nouville, the term "foreigner"
brings to mind above all someone who speaks a different lan¬
guage.
For those foreigners who come from a country other than.
France, either contacts have been established with them over
a sufficiently long period and they are then "people like
ourselves" (for example, the foreigners who live in Nouville
or the German soldiers who were stationed there for a long
time), or no contact has been made, in which case they re¬
main unknown, "foreigners" in the full sense of the word.
The villagers have no personal experience of these people ;
they live far away in "'mysterious", "exotic" lands. "Beyond
the forest," said a very old lady of Nouville, speaking of the
Chinese. What is known about them inspires wonder or
"makes one shudder". Even in this case, the people of Nou¬
ville know nothing of their history nor their legends, and
have nothing to turn to except stereotyped memories of
school lessons and the clichés of the modern town criers, the
broadcaster and the journalist.
