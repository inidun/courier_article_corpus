e i r e s i g n an use
Before we can evaluate the realities
of atomic power, as distinct from
visions of the future, we need to
understand the basic science involved,
the installations that generate the
power and the factors that enter into
their operation. This in turn takes us
on an excursion into a realm of science
that was not taught in any school even
ten years ago. It also brings us into
contact with words that hardly existed
then but are now becoming familiar in
every language.
' It is now well known that all matter
is composed of atoms, discreet particles
that are the smallest and ultimate
units of the chemical elements. Until
the discovery of radium they were
thought to be indestructible and un¬
changeable. Radium provided the first
clues to an atomic interior and its
study led eventually to present-day
"atom-splitting" in which the atom is
laid wide open to fragmentation, to
separation of some of its parts and
even to the addition of more units and
the synthesis of wholly new atoms.
The process of splitting is now known
by the more accurate term, "fission",
and those types of atoms which un¬
dergo fission with relative ease, as in
the atomic bomb, are known as "fis¬
sionable" or "fissile". It is pity that,
in the English language at least, there
is as yet no verb to express the action
of fission. "To fiss" is almost unthink¬
able and "to fissure" does not quite
convey the meaning but can hardly be
improved upon.
The complex installation in which
fission takes place with the release of
energy and the production of new
elements from the fissile material was
known originally as a "pile" because
it was in fact a pile of uranium rods
and blocks of graphite. It is more
properly called a "reactor". In com¬
mon speech it . is the atomic furnace
where the energy is generated from the
atomic fuel, though there is no fire and
no combustion in the usual sense.
The new science is one of events
within the atom but more especially
within the nucleus of the atom. It is
unfortunate that the terms "atomic
energy" and "atomic power" have
become popular, for in truth "nuclear
energy" and "nuclear power" are more
correct. The world within the atom,
as revealed by the natural rays from
radium and by cosmic rays, is almost
incredible from the ordinary human
point of view. This is not merely
because it is so complex but also
because the basic particles within the
nucleus have new and odd relations to
both matter and energy that do not
fit into cur common conceptions.
The nucleus of the atom contains all
the "matter", yet is so small that it
occupies only a thousandth of a mil¬
lionth of a millionth of the space
within the atom. It occupies a rela¬
tively smaller space within the whole
atom than the sun occupies in the
whole great solar system. In that case
its density (that is, its weight per
cubic inch) must be a thousand'times
' a million times' a million times that of
ordinary materials. Whatever that
atomic core is made of, it is so dense
that a.1 lump of it as large as a drop of
water would weigh two million tons.
But that is only half of the aston¬
ishing situation. Energy is similarly
concentrated there. Within that ex¬
ceedingly minute volume of the atomic
nucleus there are new forces that hold
the mass together. The earth itself
is held together by gravity but the force
within the nucleus must be so much
stronger than gravity that there is no
word to express it. The force of gra¬
vity would have to be multiplied by a
number that comprises the figure 1
followed by 37 zeros. Gravity holds
the planets in their courses and the
stars in the sky but has no place in
the nucleus.
The binding force within the nucleus
is of a new and unknown form. It is
complicated and depends on the velo¬
city of the nuclear particles and even
on their spinning motion or rotation.
On the other hand the force, whatever
it is, does not depend on electrical
charges, for (neutral) neutrons and
(positive) protons seem to attract each
other to the same degree that they
attract their own kind.
This is the present mystery of the
nucleus and therefore of the atom and
thus of matter and energy in general.
There, in the intimacy of the atomic

REACTION begins

Uranium 235 or
plutonium atom.
When fission oc¬
curs, great energy
is released and se¬
veral neutrons are
elected. These strike
other U-235 or plu¬
tonium atoms like
bullets and fission
them, thus freeing
more energy and mo¬
re neutron bullets.
19

Th sources of atomic energy
nucleus, lies the secret of the true
nature of matter, of energy, and of
their relation to each other. It is the
purpose of the great cyclotrons and
synchrotrons, such as those now being
built at Geneva for the European
Organization for Nuclear Research, to
study this nuclear world. (See page 23.)
It is the nucleus that explodes during
fission, that emits rays in radio-activ¬
ity, and that combines with other
nuclei to generate the sun's heat. It is
the nucleus that will provide the
energy for what we have- called the
atomic age. It is
by the explor¬
ation and partial
mastery of the
nucleus that
science has in
recent years been
able to duplicate
and greatly im-
prove on the
radio-activity of
radium, for
instance, and has
surpassed the
dream of me¬
dieval alchemists
by changing one
chemical element into another, such as
changing gold into mercury or pro¬
ducing explosive plutonium from harm¬
less uranium.
Just as the atoms of the various
chemical elements combine with
others to form the molecules of che¬
mical compounds, so a number of still
smaller particles combine to form the
different atomic nuclei. Three such
primary particles must be mentioned
briefly: the proton, the neutron and the
electron, the last being the familiar
"particle of electricity" that flows
through wires in countless millions to
form an electric current. It has a
charge or perhaps one should say it is
a charge of negative electricity, which
is to say that all electricity is negative
(and thus misnamed).
Less familiar is the proton. It is
almost 2,000 times heavier than the
electron. It is definitely matter rather
than electricity. Indeed it is for some
reason positively charged, as if it had
itself lost a negative electron. It is an
essential component of all atomic
nuclei, combined and compressed in
them into firm union. But it has a
comfortable existence all its own as
the entire nucleus of the hydrogen
atom, the simplest and lightest atom.
At the surface of the hydrogen atom
is a single electron, vibrant and
dancing in a complex mathematical
orbit. That electron is responsible for
the atom's chemical properties and
enables it to combine with other atoms
to form molecules, such as with oxygen
to form water. But at the centre of
the hydrogen atom is its concentrated
mass, its nucleus, the single proton
whose positive charge balances that of
the relatively distant electron, making
the whole atom electrically neutral.
Every other atomic nucleus is more
complex and heavier than that of
hydrogen and every one contains
neutrons in addition to its protons.
The neutron is practically identical
with the proton, with almost exactly
the same weight, but it has no positive
charge and so is electrically neutral.
When neutrons form a part of an
atomic nucleus they add to its mass
The alchemists'
dream has been
surpassed
and weight but do not affect its
positive charge and therefore do not
change the number of external
electrons that are responsible for the
atom's chemical properties.
These are the essential components
of all nuclei: protons, neutrons and
electrons, plus positrons, mesons and
others that need no mention here.
There are, however, several com¬
binations of protons and neutrons that
form well-known nuclear particles.
For instance, the "alpha particle", long
known as emitted by radium, is com¬
posed of two pro¬
tons and two
neutrons, and
thus has two po¬
sitive charges
When the alpha
particle is emit¬
ted by radium it
quickly picks up
two wandering
electrons and be¬
comes an atom
of helium, for the
alpha particle is
identical with the
helium nucleus
and two external,
circulating electrons make it a neutral
whole atom.
Another such stable group comprises
a single proton and a single neutron,
and thus has a single positive charge.
This group takes part in many nuclear
reactions and is called a deuteron.
When it picks up a single electron in
an external orbit it forms an atom that
is identical with hydrogen in its
chemical properties though it is twice
as heavy because its nucleus is not
merely a proton but has a neutron
added. Deuterium is therefore an
"isotope" of hydrogen that is called
"heavy hydrogen". Two deuterium
atoms combine chemically with one
atom of oxygen to produce "heavy
water".
Hydrogen,' with only one proton, is
the simplest and lightest atom. But
there are 92 different chemical elements
and the atomic nuclei of all the others
are made up of larger numbers of both
protons and neutrons. The heaviest
and most com¬
plex of all the
common atoms is
uranium, whose
nucleus contains -
92 protons and
146 neutrons, a
total of 238.
But this is not
the only type of
uranium that can
exist and there¬
fore not the only
possible composi¬
tion of the nu¬
cleus.
There are other forms with 141
neutrons, or 143, or 147. They all
have 92 protons and thus all of them
have identical chemical properties.
But the weight of the atom is the sum
of the weights of the protons and
neutrons, so that these three varieties
of uranium have atomic weights of
233, 235 and 239, respectively.
Such varieties of atoms of the same
elements, all with the same chemical
properties but with different weights
and a differing number of neutrons, are
Swift neutrons
explode the
adjoining atoms
known as isotopes. Most of them seem
to be under some sort of strain and
undergo a disintegration during which
they emit particles and rays of various
sorts. Thus they are radio-active and
are known as radio-isotopes. Their
rays are useful and will be discussed in
a subsequent article of this series.
(See page 29.)
Isotopes of the naturally radio-active
elements have long been known, pri¬
marily because of their distinctive rays.
But bombardment of almost any of the
92 elements by high-speed protons in
one of the great modern cyclotrons or
bombardment by neutrons in an atomic
reactor will add or subtract neutrons
from their nuclei and convert them
into isotopic varieties, some stable, most
of them radio-active.
Thus isotopes of all the chemical
elements are now known a total of
more than a thousand different atomic
varieties. In fact neutrons and protons
have been added to uranium in various
stages so that six new, previously un¬
known elements have now been created,
the last of them up to now being
No. 98, Californium.
In the case of uranium that variety
known as uranium 235 (from the
weight of its atom) spontaneously
disintegrates when struck by a stray
neutron, coming perhaps from outer
space as a cosmic ray, and ejects some
of its neutrons. When such a neutron
strikes an atom of uranium 238 it is
captured to form uranium 239. This in
turn instantly goes through a more
complicated nuclear reaction and
forms plutonium, with a weight of 240.
When that atom is struck by a neu¬
tron perhaps from another atom of
uranium 235, it is literally split in two.
Smaller atoms of lighter elements
result but the important thing is that
when this happens some of the binding
energy within the plutonium nucleus is
released and the atom not only splits
but the fragments fly apart with
tremendous energy. This reaction is
the basis both of the atomic bomb and
of atomic or nuclear power.
In the bomb the explosion of one
atom releases swift neutrons which at
once explode ad¬
joining atoms,
and the neutrons
from them in
turn explode still
other atoms.
Within a mil¬
lionth of a se¬
cond the entire
mass disintegra¬
tes in the indes-
:ribable explosion
that has horrified
the world. But
when this dis¬
integration i s
controlled so that
it proceeds at a manageable rate, then
the energy of disintegration may be
liberated over the course of hours,
months or years. Precisely the same
energy that feeds the bomb feeds the
atomic furnace, the "nuclear reactor".
The reactor is thus the scene of
controlled nuclear explosions. In it,
the high-speed nuclear fragments, and
neutrons too, are slowed down, their
energy is absorbed in the surrounding
materials and reappears as heat. It
may be that by future research the
10

high-speed nuclear projectiles can be
harnessed to generate electricity di¬
rectly but for the present all atomic
reactors generate heat and their
energy can be used only in that form.
But if reactors are to be used for
industrial power this heat must be
captured and put to work. Modern
reactor design is largely a problem of
how to capture a maximum quantity of
heat and thus to utilize the energy of
the exploding atoms efficiently. The
crucial point in present atomic power
development is precisely that: whether
or not enough
heat can be cap¬
tured to justify
the enormous
cost of the reac¬
tor and of the
fissionable ura¬
nium and whe¬
ther or not the
power produced
will compare in
cost with the po¬
wer made by the
combustion o f
coal or any of
the other fuels.
task is complicated by the fact
that neutrons are emitted during fission
at very high speed, which are dangerous
to personnel, ruinous to equipment and,
in addition, convert many of the atoms
that they strike into radio-active
isotopes which are themselves dan¬
gerous. Consequently, the heat cannot
be removed from the reactor by any
simple device. The cooling liquid that
flows through the reactor becomes
radio-active and cannot be used direct¬
ly to operate an engine.
In one common type of reactor the
coolant is liquid metallic sodium. This
flows from the reactor through pipes
to a heat-exchanger where it is in turn
cooled by water before it returns to
cool the reactor once more. In that
exchange the water turns to steam that
is not dangerous because the radio¬
active sodium does not emit neutrons
and thus does not affect the water or
the steam. The 'latter can then be
passed through a steam turbine where
its high-pressure energy spins the
turbine and thereby generates electri¬
city. Thus by successive steps the
energy which came from the exploding
plutonium or uranium atoms emerges
from the power house as electric
current and is in no way different from
a current generated by other methods.
It is apparent then that the nuclear
reactor is merely the source of energy
and in a large power house would
replace only the coal furnace; all the
remaining parts of the power installa¬
tion would be unchanged.
There are many types of nuclear
reactors. They all have features in
common that differ only in degree.
The fuel is always a fissionable
material, either uranium-233, 235 or
plutonium. .Each of these releases
almost three million times as much
heat when it disintegrates as does the
combustion of an equal weight of coal.
The pure fissionable materials are,
however, extremely difficult and costly
to produce. Uranium-235 is present
in all natural uranium but comprises
only 0.7 % of it. Since it is chemically
identical with the 99.3 % of uranium-
238, it can be separated from it only
by complex and costly physical
methods. Plutonium must be made
from uranium-238 in a reactor and
uranium-233 can be similarly made
Three million
times the heat
of coal
from thorium. The pure fissionable
fuels therefore cost many thousands of
dollars per pound. For the generation
of power they are commonly used in a
less pure form in which ordinary
uranium is merely "enriched" with the
fissionable varieties.
If the purpose of the reactor is to
produce plutonium, high grade ura¬
nium-235 is the fuel. It converts
ordinary uranium-238 into plutonium
which can then be chemically separated
in the pure form and used in the bomb
or as the fuel in another reactor. If
the purpose of
the reactor is to
test the resis¬
tance to neutrons
of metals and
other materials
that are to be
used in the reac¬
tors or in atomic
engines, the fuel
may again be a
pure fissionable
uranium in or¬
der to get a
I maximum con-
centration of
neutrons acting
upon the materials being tested. If po¬
wer alone is the purpose of the reactor
the fuel is "enriched" uranium because
a high intensity of neutrons is not
needed and a slower reaction is more
likely to generate usable heat.
Every reactor also has some form of
"moderator", a material like graphite,
heavy water or beryllium, which serve
primarily to slow down the neutrons
from their original speed of many
thousands of miles per second to a
speed at which they are more likely to
be captured by the uranium atoms and
thus to cause fission.
Every reactor also needs a material
which actively captures neutrons but is
not capable of fission by them. The
commonest material for this purpose is
the metal cadmium. It reduces the
number of flying neutrons and thus
reduces the rate of the fission reaction.
The cadmium is commonly used in the
form of thick rods which can be in¬
serted into the reactor if the reaction
is going too fast and thus slow it down.
They may, in
fact, be inserted
fully, whereupon
they stop the
reaction cornel °-
tely and shut
down the rear" ".
Thus the speed
of both the fis¬
sion reaction and
of the power ge¬
neration is then
controlled and
danger of, a
runaway reaction
or an explosion
is avoided.
Also every reactor must be provided
with means for carrying away the heat.
While this is necessary for all reactors
to keep them from melting, the cooling
liquid is the crucial part of a reactor
that is used for generating power, as
has been said.
Finally, every reactor must also have
an effective shield to absorb neutrons
that escape from the fission reaction
and prevent them from penetrating
into the room where scientists and
attendants are at work. Such shields
are usually heavy walls of lead or con¬
crete, or both. No reactor can safely
operate without a shield and it is for
- - r .
Th e / urnace
wh ich b reeds
its own fuel
this reason that there is no hope that
atomic reactors can ever be used for
the propulsion of automobiles or for the
heating of homes. The shield alone
must weigh many tons. While this is
no obstacle to its use in a large power
station or in a marine vessel, it is one
of the severe limitations on the use of
any atomic engine for airplanes.
Until May of 1953 the prospect of
using atomic fuels and reactors as a
major source of industrial power was a
bright hope but not more than that.
There were two major obstacles. One
was the cost of the pure fissionable fuel,
which has never been stated, since it is
made only by governments for military
purposes and it cannot now be bought
anywhere. It was nevertheless certain
that the cost per pound was very high
indeed. The second obstacle was the
lack of any certainty that there is
enough uranium available in the
minerals of the world to supply an
atomic industrial age. Both obstacles
were eliminated by the announcement
of the success of the experimental
"breeder" reactor, operated by the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission at Arco,
Idaho, since 1951. At one stroke the
effective supply of uranium was mul¬
tiplied by 140 and the effective cost of
the fuel was reduced almost to zero.
The breeder reactor is a major item in
the prospect of atomic power.
Briefly it is a reactor that generates
power and at the same time produces
as much new fissionable material as it
uses up, and probably more. This at
first thought seems as impossible as
would a coal furnace that consumes
tons of fuel to generate heat but at the
end contains more fresh coal than was
fed into it. Such a furnace would
operate without any fuel cost and, in
fact, could sell new coal to other users.
In the case of coal it is, of course, im¬
possible. But with atomic fuels in a
breeder reactor it is only one of many
apparent miracles.
When an atom of uranium-235
fissures it emits high-speed neutrons,
as has been said. If the fission
reaction is maintained, one of the
neutrons must strike another atom of
uranium-235 so that this, in turn, will
undergo fission. If two neutrons are
emitted the se¬
cond may do the
same, but if ordi¬
nary uranium-
238 (which does
not fissure) is
also present the
second neutron
may strike it,
and thus change
it into plutonium.
Plutonium is fis¬
sionable, exactly
as is uranium-
235, and the ori¬
ginal value of
the fuel has thus
been restored. If the uranium-235 fis¬
sion always emits two neutrons and if
both processes are 100 % efficient, the
furnace would be continuously manu¬
facturing its own fuel out of the cheap
natural uranium-238. The practical
questions then are : How many neu¬
trons does uranium-235 emit on fission
and how efficient is the process ?
The exact number of neutrons emit¬
ted has never been revealed. It has,
however, been annouced that there are
"more than two". The margin this.gives
is such that some neutrons may be lost
by striking the rods or other inert ma¬
terials in the reactor and yet leave one
21

THE COST OF
FUEL WILL BE
NEGLIGIBLE
to carry on the reaction and one to
make new fuel. If three neutrons are
emitted there is ample margin and it
thus becomes possible that the reactor
may even make more fuel than it uses.
That this is possible is still a real
hope, though it has as yet no official
confirmation. What the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission did announce in
May 1953 was that fissionable plu¬
tonium is produced in the breeder
reactor "at a rate that is at least equal
to the rate at which the uranium-235
is being consumed".
In the case of thorium, however, it is
known that more fuel can be produced
than is used. The original fuel in this
case is also uranium-235. If a neutron
from it strikes an atom of thorium-232
(which is not fissionable) that atom is
converted into fissionable uranium-233.
The reaction is
efficient enough
' so that more ura¬
nium-233 is pro¬
duced than the
uranium- 235.
When more fuel
is produced than
consumed, the
excess can be
sold to other
users , presum¬
ably the Govern¬
ment itself, and
the returns would
reduce the net
cost of power
which has been
produced in the nuclear reactor.
In both cases common and relatively "
cheap materials, uranium and thorium,
are converted into atomic fuels by the
reactor whose primary purpose is the
economic generation of power. This
means that all the uranium and
thorium in the world could be con¬
verted into effective fuels instead of
only the 0.7 % or l/140th of the
uranium that is present as uranium-
235. This multiplies the world's re¬
sources of uranium fuel 140 times.
What is more, it adds all the great
deposits of thorium to the fuel supply.
The breeder reactor which has
supplied this information and created
this confidence is a relatively small one
with a production of 250 kilowatts of
electricity enough 'for only a small
town. At its centre is the core of
fissionable uranium-235, about the size
of a football. Around this core is a
thick cylinder of ordinary uranium-238
which catches the neutrons to form
plutonium. The heat evolved is equi¬
valent to 4,000 watts for every cubic
inch of the active core.
In comparison, an oil-fired boiler,
such as is used in battleships, gives
only 600 watts per cubic inch of fuel.
The heat from the breeder reactor is
conducted away by a flow of liquid
sodium through inserted pipes. The
sodium stream emerges from the
reactor at a temperature of about
660° F and delivers its heat to water in
a heat-exchanger and thus forms steam
to drive a turbine.
COSMOTRON, at Brookhaven National Laboratory U.S.A., is the second most
powerful of giant machines used by scientists to bombard atomic nuclei with
high energy particles and thus learn more- about their make-up and nature. (Most
powerful machine operating at present is the Berkeley Bevatron, at the University of
California.) The huge "doughnut-shaped" magnet, 75 feet in diameter, guides the particles
in a circular path while a succession of electric boosts gives them phenomenal speeds.
Collisions between high-energy particles and nuclei are seen as thin white tracks (photo,
left), when photographed in an instrument called a cloud chamber.
To calculate the cost of the fuel used
in producing power is easy enough. As
has been explained, this is now not the
cost of the expensive, fissionable
uranium-235 but of ordinary uranium-
238 the price of which is approximately
$35 a pound. Since 20 pounds of
uranium will produce some 52 million
kilowatts hour of electricity enough to
light a fairly large city for a year the
cost of the fuel used would be only
0.0013 cents per kilowatt hour. Since
the usual price of electricity is more
than one cent per kilowatt hour, the
fuel cost itself is quite negligible.
But such a calculation is illusory
because other expenses are involved.
The most important of which is the
occasional removal of the covering
cylinder of natural uranium and its
chemical processing to extract the
plutonium for the future fuel. This is
a difficult operation because the very
strong radio-activity of the materials
makes it necessary to conduct the
chemical operation by remote con¬
trol, without contact with personnel.
Furthermore, the core itself gradually
becomes exhausted as the fission
products accumulate in it. It too must
therefore ultimately be removed so that
the remaining uranium-235 can be
extracted from the variety of other
and smaller radio-active atoms that are
the products of fission. The processing
of the fuels therefore adds an item of
cost which is at least ten times that of
the original uranium. In that case the
fuel cost is 0.013 cents per kilowatt
hour, which is still negligible.
But there are other costs. The
highly radio-active products must be
disposed of. Some of them are valuable
for use as radio- isotopes. Most of them
are of no value but are intensely radio¬
active and are therefore a serious
hazard. In any case the cost of
disposing of radio-active wastes is an
important one.
But the major cost is the building of
the reactor itself which is between
2 million and 20 million dollars, or even
more. The calculation of the practical,
final cost of electricity must therefore
be postponed to a more comprehensive
discussion of other reactor installations
and the plans of electrical power com¬
panies m a subsequent article (page 41).
