ASSISTANCE
WE are accustomed to read from
time to time in our news-
papers of some wonderful
new drug or treatment which is
alleged to be able to cure one or
other of the diseases to which man
is subject. Whatever the headlines
may shout about such a treatment,
we usually find when we read fur-
ther that the doctor or chemist
responsible for discovering and
developing it is very cautious in the
claims that he makes for it. The
true expert is normally very shy of
speaking of results and achieve-
ments, and prefers rather to speak
of probabilities and experiments.
Our world, our civilization, like
the human body, is also subject to
aU kinds of ills. The symptoms are
plain to see ; poverty, hunger ignor-
ance, ill-health, injustice, inequal-
ity, strife. The diagnoses that have
been made of the cause or causes
are various, and the methods of
treatment and cure remain uncer-
tain ; but aU over the world experi-
ments are going on and studies are
being made which it is hoped may
lead the human race forward to
better times.
One of the general signs of the
world's ill condition is the great
unbalance between the standards of
living in difIerent parts of the earth.
This unbalance is no new thing, but
it is more than ever apparent and
dangerous now that the improve-
men t of communications has.
brought people so much closer
together. The fundamental aim of
some of the biggest experiments is
to try to remove this unbalance, to
raise the levels of living in the less
developed parts of the world to those
which apply in the more developed
parts.
One of the methods which may
lead to the attainment of this pur-
pose is through programmes of what
is called"technical assistance".
Basically, these are programmes
whereby skills and knowledge which
exist in any country may be made
available to any other country in
need of them. This exchange of
skills is carried out by the sending
of experts and the offering of train-
ing and study facilities. Like the
name of some new drug, this phrase
"technical assistance"is becoming
familiar in the world.
It is good that this should be so,
provided that two things are under-
stood : first, that technical assistance
is not new, and second, that it is
not a proved panacea for the world's
troubles. Since the beginnings of
man's history, contacts between
peoples have led to the exchange of
skill and knowledge to mutual
advantage. Explorers and pioneers,
merchants and missionaries, have
all been the means, even if often the
unconscious and indirect means, of
furthering what we now calI tech-
nical assistance. The only new
development is the attempt to pro-
vide this assistance under systema-
tically planned programmes.
There are several of these pro-
grammes in action today. Some of
them operate under arrangements
whereby one advanced country alone
provides the needed assistance, as
under the U. S. Point IV programme,
or the development programmes
through which certain European
nations are trying to help forward
the dependent countries for which
they are responsible. Other pro-
grammes are organized by groups of
nations acting together, as under
the Colombo Plan. But the tech-
nical assistance programme which
has the widest participation is the
newest, that of the United Nations.
The United Nations Expanded
Programme of Technical Assistance,
as it is formally called, is like all
the others in what it is trying to
do. Its original quality and true
importance lie mainly in the fact
that it is an experiment in orga-

pooling world skill and knowledge
nizing technical assistance on a
really broad, international basis. If
this experiment shows results, it will
help to prove not just that technical
assistance is a good way of treating
the world's ills, but also that it is
really possible for the nations to
work together constructively for the
common good.
The practice of technical assist-
ance is not unlike that of medicine.
A good physician does not treat
diseases, he treats people. He cannot
expect to cure the body of his
patient if he ignores the mind. But
while concerning himself with the
whole man, he may want more
expert advice on a specifie problem,
and so he calls in a specialist. Simi-
larly, an attempt is made under the
United Nations Technical Assistance
Programme to diagnose the needs
of a country as a whole, and, follow-
proves major projects, and allocates
funds to the member organizations.
But it is the specialized agencies
themselves which study the needs of
Member States in detail and act on
the requests of governments by fur-
nishing foreign specialists and by
arranging for training and study
facilities in other countries.
The Technical Assistance Pro-
gramme is llnanced by the contri-
butions of Member States, furnished
in proportion to their resources and
voted at an annual Technical Assist-
ance Conference. At the first con-
ference in June 1950, slightIy over
$20, 000, 000 was pledged by 50 na-
tions for the programme from
July 1, 1950 to December 31, 1951.
A similar sum was voted for 1952 at
the second conference last Novem-
ber.
According to a recent report of
by Michael HOWSON
ing up this diagnosis, to provide the
appropriate specialized assistance.
Since the Programme came into
operation in July, 1950, an organiza-
tion has grown up to meet its
requirements. Directly responsible to
the U. N. Economie and Social Coun-
cil for the programme is the Tech-
nical Assistance Board. The Board
consists of the heads-or their
representatives-of the U. N. Tech-
nical Assistance Administration and
of a number of the Specialized
Agencies. In addition, the Inter-
national Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other Agencies
such as UNICEF, although not
members of the Board, assist in
projects undertaken under the Pro-
gramme.
The Technical Assistance Board
is the central organ which reviews
programmes, arranges for joint
action between organizations, ap-
the Technical Assistance Board,.'by
the end of 1951, some 717 technical
assistance experts in a wide variety
of Seids of knowledge have been
sent out under the expanded pro-
gramme to some 75 under-developed
countries and territories. Some
845 fellows drawn from some 69
countries and territories had been
placed in technical training institu-
tions or had otherwise been provid-
ed with training, study or observa-
tion facilities, in countries other
than their own. By the end of March
1952, an additional 227 experts had
been recruited and 232 additional
fellowships had been awarded."
Since it is in relation to the pro-
blems of the world as a whole that
the programme is conceived, its
scope is naturally very wide. Detall-
ed descriptions of a few of the pro-
jects that are being undertaken are
pul51ished elsewhere in this issue.
The doctor can do hardly any-
thing without the co-operation and
goodwill of the patient. In the same
way, the foreign experts sent out
under the Technical Assistance Pro-
gramme can do hardly anything
without the co-operation and good-
will of the people among whom they
work. No assistance is given unless
a request for it is first received from
the government concerned. By
making a request, a government not
only expresses a wish to have expert
advice and assistance in some neld
which is considered to be important
to the future of its people, but also
implies that it is already engaged in
development in this field or is will-
ing and able to undertake such
development. If, for example, a
government asks for expert assist-
ance in improving its railways, this
implies that resources, financial,
material and human, are available
for railway development. If a go-
vernment asks for a fellowship for
one of its citizens to study welfare
services in a foreign country, this
implies there will be a job for that
person in a field of social welfare
when he or she returns home. In
fact, nearly aIl governments have
their own plans for economic deve-
lopment, and projects of technical
assistance are usually designed to
fit into such plans.
By far the greatest effort for de-
velopment has to be made by the
people of the requesting country
which, in addition to making its
contribution towards the funds of
the Technical Assistance Pro-
gramme, is usually devoting to its
own internai development, resources
for larger than those furnished from
outside.
OfficiaI co-operation is thus assur-
ed for technical assistance projects.
But this alone is not enough. Fun-
damentally, technical assistance im-
plies co-operation between people.
Much must depend on the spirit
in which the advice and instruction
are given and received at the work-
ing level. However expert a foreign
specialist may be in his own subject,
his function is not to present to the
people of the country where he is
working, a ready-made plan which
they have merely to put into affect.
Though, in technical matters, the
foreign adviser may know all the
answers, his ftrst important task in
any country is to ask many ques-
tions. He and his local counterparts
must alike tackle their joint pro-
blems in a spirit of, willingness to
learn.
The Technical Assistance Pro-
gramme has now been in operation
for more than two years ; but except
in the cases of a few projects which
have limited and short-term pur-
poses, it is too soon to attempt to
assess thp over-all results. The
whole Programme is essentially a
long-term experiment, or rather a
series of experiments. Although the
problems which are being faced
urgently need solution, nevertheless
neither those who have some active
part in the Programme, nor others,
(including the general public of the
would), who have the responsibility
for supporting it, must look for
immediate superftcial results. The
experiments have barely started.
The nations who have started
these experiments must see that
they are carried through to conclu-
sions still far ahead. Financially,
the Programme is a small one,
though it is the expressed view of
the ECOSOC that it should expand.
In its special international quality,
however, it is of immense import-
ance. Some of the experiments will
fail ; some will only partially suc-
ceed ; others will bring visible and
sensible benefits. The results will
aIl depend on the extent to which the
efforts of those concerned meet the
needs of the peoples of the world
whom they are designed to help.
