When girls go missing
f rom the classro o m
Millions of girls are not making it into school, despite a concerted international movement to push
the cause forward. In some African countries, the gender gap is even widening.What’s gone wrong?
n Ethiopia, girls are sometimes abducted for
marriage when they’re no more than eight.I n
West A f r i c a , t h e y ’re recruited from poor
rural families to work as domestics in coastal
cities or neighbouring countries. In South
A f r i c a , a recent report by Human Rights
Watch warns that sexual violence and abuse
is hampering girls’ access to education.And
in Afghanistan,they’ve simply been barred
from school under the Taleban regime.
C u s t o m s, p o v e r t y, fear and violence: g i r l s
still account for 60 percent of the estimated
113 million out-of-school children, and the
majority live in sub-Saharan Africa and
South A s i a . In 1990, faced with a
deteriorating educational record in many
countries, the major development agencies
and 155 national governments rang the alarm
at a high-profile conference in Jo m t i e n ,
Thailand.Launching the Education for All
i n i t i a t i v e, ambitious targets were set, n o t a b l y
to get all children into school within ten
y e a r s, stressing that “the most urgent
p r i o r i t y ” was to ensure access to, and improve
the quality of education for girls and women.
Ten years later, in Dakar (Senegal), the world
community had to face up to the fact that
“gender discrimination continues to
permeate education systems”and that “ l i t t l e
progress has been made in increasing girls’
participation in basic education.” This time
r o u n d , they set 2015 as the date by which
“all children,particularly girls . . . complete
free and compulsory primary education of
good quality.” More boldly, they pledged to
eliminate “gender disparities in primary and
secondary education by 2005.”
For Christopher Colclough,a professor at
the Sussex-based Institute of Development
Studies (IDS), there is “no chance
whatsoever”of reaching the 2005 target.In
sub-Saharan A f r i c a , where he has led a nine-
country research project1 to diagnose

Girls account for an estimated 90 percent of child domestic workers. Few have a chance to attend school.

constraints to schooling and propose policies
to improve outcomes, the gap between girls’
and boys’ primary enrolment rates has
increased in some places. “ G o v e r n m e n t s
recognize that girls’ education is incredibly
important but their policies to tackle it are
usually inadequate,” says Colclough,
suggesting a “de facto political unwillingness”
to deal with the problem.S e c o n d l y, he notes
“if you have a situation where women and
girls are discriminated against in society and
not all children are in school, it follows almost
as night follows day that girls will be kept out
of school most.”
Not that the task is easy.In many countries
strapped by debt burdens, the goal appears
more elusive than ever, with families bearing
increasing costs for educating their children.
“A lot of girls are dropping out of school or not
being sent at all because of the poverty of
p a r e n t s,” says Peninah Mlama, e x e c u t i v e
director of the Forum for African Wo m e n
Educationists (FAW E ) , a partner in the IDS
s t u d y. “ Traditional cultural attitudes are still
very strong,especially in rural areas.The little
money parents have to scrounge for sending
children to school is seen as too big an
investment to risk on the girl child.”To make
matters worse, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is
cutting into a generation of young adults—in
S w a z i l a n d , it is estimated that three to four
teachers die every week of A I D S. In the
absence of a breadwinner, girls are the most
likely to be denied access to school to head a
h o u s e h o l d .
Hidden costs
While there is no magic bullet for solving
the quandary, there is little left to discover
about why girls stay on the sidelines,s t a r t i n g
with the number one factor, p o v e r t y.
“Although we can’t underestimate the role of
c u l t u r e, even in the most conservative
societies like rural Ye m e n , the vast majority
of families want to send their children to
school,and they will do so if you reduce the
c o s t s,” says Carolyn Wi n t e r, of the Wo r l d
B a n k . The problem lies in the complex
weaving of “social and economic forces that
overlap and strengthen each other,”
Colclough underlines. Waiving school fees
for example, does not address the question of
how to replace a girl’s valuable labour in the
home and the fie l d s,nor the profound bias in
some countries against educating daughters.
Nor does it recognize the hidden costs of
s c h o o l i n g, from clothing to textbooks.
Recruiting more female teachers, a n
indisputably positive influence, is only truly
b e n e ficial if parents are informed of their
presence, if textbooks are revised to cut out
stereotypes and training tackles attitude
q u e s t i o n s. In all the countries where they
conducted research, the IDS team found that
teachers believed that boys were more
intelligent….And when chores have to get
done like cleaning the classroom, girls are
naturally expected to oblige.
“If there is one lesson we have learned,
i t ’s that there is no single quick fix , but there
are usually to two or three actions together
that are catalytic,” says Mary Joy Pigozzi, a
senior UN I C E F education advisor. Two are
proven musts: getting parents and
communities involved in schools, a n d
improving quality. Most importantly, s a y s
P i g o z z i , quality has be thought about in
“ e n g e n d e r e d ”terms through an “ a f fir m a t i v e
a c t i o n ” approach that takes into account
where the learner is coming from:“ You have
to understand that girls may get less protein
than boys, that communities raise girls to
have different expectations of themselves.
Then you have to look at the quality of the
learning environment to address issues such
as safety and sexual harassment, and the
whole teaching-learning process.”
Understanding the critical things that
make a difference is one part of the story, t h e
other is how countries go about changing
their ways. “Nearly every single policy
document mentions girls’ education, i t ’s
almost as if it’s the politically correct
language to use,” says Mlama. “ B u t
governments don’t have the capacity and
commitment to really do something.” Many
education ministries, for example, have set up
gender or girls’ education units,“often staffed
by one or two people who don’t have the
skills and capacity to influence overall
educational policy.”In meetings on education
reform, she continues, “they’ll be called in
towards the end of the process or at the fin a l
meeting with donors.”
Addressing the bias
Outside pressure is founded upon
irrefutable evidence: educating girls and
women has a significant impact on reducing
poverty. Benefits include lower fertility and
infant mortality rates, better health and
n u t r i t i o n , higher productivity and chances
that the next generation will in turn be
e d u c a t e d . But shaking up bureaucratic,
patriarchal structures might well be the most
mammoth task of all.“Civil structures are
often set up so that there is very limited
incentive to invest in improvements and
work towards goals and targets,”says Wi n t e r.
Some examples of good practice involve
skirting slow bureaucracies and vested
interests. In India,for example, the state of
Uttar Pradesh took advantage of a law on
developing charities to set up a well-staffed
“ p a r a l l e l ” structure to push through a
comprehensive package on girls’ education
in rural areas.Women in the community walk
girls to school, parent-teacher associations
and principals reach out to homes where
children aren’t enrolled, and local groups
stress to mothers that schooling is a basic
legal right.
Such fine-tuned strategies can only bear
fruit when countries are ready to take the
first step, by addressing deeply set biases in
their societies. Committed governments, say
a c t i v i s t s, can start changing the tide, f r o m
making education compulsory to delaying the
age of marriage and opening their eyes to the
realities of child labour. Otherwise, ten years
down the road, millions of girls will still go
missing from the classroom,keeping the wheel
of poverty turning. ■
