"Kuboyama and the Saga of the 'Lucky Dragon'" (1) recounts the story of
the crew of a Japanese fishing boat which was in the vicinity of Bikini Atoll
when the first Hydrogen Bomb was exploded on March 1, 1954. Kuboyama
was radio operator on board the "Lucky Dragon". Neither he nor his crew
mates realized the nature of the apocalyptic spectacle they had witnessed.
But the people of Japan and the entire world were soon to learn of the
fate that awaited Kuboyama.

K UBOYAMA'S last jour¬
ney to sea got under way on Friday
January 22, 1954, shortly before noon,
when the Fukuryu Maru (Lucky Dra¬
gon) headed out from Yaizu.
The crew had been told they were
going south into seas near the Solo¬
mon Islands. But Fishing Master Mi-
saki and the vessel's owner, Nishi-
kawa, had decided that the Lucky Dra¬
gon would fish near Midway Island,

over 2,500 miles to the east of Japan.
They had pored over the carefully
kept records of Japanese fishing boats
and had been favorably impressed
by the good catches of albacore, or
"American tuna" as they called them
in that area. They were reluctant to
tell the crew, however, since they
knew there would be strong objections
to fishing in those notoriously stormy
waters.
According to custom, Captain Tsut-
sui, Chief Engineer Yamamoto and
Radioman Kuboyama should all have
been consulted in selecting the fishing
grounds. Kuboyama voiced angry
doubts as to whether the Lucky Dra¬
gon was sturdy enough to withstand
the battering that she might run into
in storms around Midway. Yama-
40
moto expressed fears that his engine
might break down, which in rough seas
could be disastrous. Tsutsui objected
too, but he could not overrule his fish¬
ing master. The real boss aboard a
Japanese tuna boat is the fishing mas¬
ter. The Lucky Dragon continued on
Its course toward Midway.
Long before dawn on February 7,
some two hundred miles south-west
of Midway, Misaki climbed to the
bridge, rang the ship's bell, and order¬
ed the waiting deck hands: "Begin
to throw out the linesl"
The Lucky Dragon moved ahead at
her top speed of seven. knots. Work¬
ing under electric lights, the crewmen
laboured to pay out the line fast
enough. Other crewmen rapidly bait¬
ed big steel hooks with eight-inch-long
frozen mackerel that had been stored
in the hold since they sailed from
Yaizu. A lighted buoy attached to
one end of the long line went out first
and then, after every three hundred
yards of line, a green glass buoy with
a bamboo pole and flag on it followed.
After nineteen of the green buoys
had been dropped, a second lighted
buoy went down. Then more green
buoys, another lighted buoy and so
on. Almost four hours later the one
long line was out, extending away from
the Lucky Dragon about thirty miles.
It hung in a series of festoons about
two hundred feet below the surface,
suspended by float lines from three
On Friday, January 22, 1954, a
Japanese fishing vessel, the
"Lucky Dragon" set out from the
small port of Yaizu to fish for
tuna in the Pacific, over 2,500
miles to the east of Japan. None
of the fishermen suspected
that a terrifying experience
awaited them in the Pacific.

Kuboyama, radio
operator on the "Lucky
Dragon", was the
most popular and
shrewdest member of
the crew.
hundred buoys. More than fifteen
hundred baited hooks waited for pass¬
ing tuna with appetites.
The crewmen ate their breakfast of
rice, soup, and tea with savour, spe¬
culating on how the first throwing of
the lines would come out. Four hours
after the last buoy had been dumped
over, they began to retrace their pre¬
vious course to haul in their catch.
The fishermen watched the buoys
with intense interest as they recovered
their lines. The men worked thirteen
hours, until after midnight, before the
lines were all in. The catch totaled
fifteen fish weighing altogether only
a few hundred pounds. They had put
out more than that in bait. The crew
grumbled, blaming Misakl for bring¬
ing them to Midway rather than to the
Solomons.
IHE following day winds
caused a rough sea, so that lines could
not be thrown. The day after that, long
before daylight, the lines went out for
the second time. Two hours before
sundown it was discovered that the
main line had parted. Had the lines
become caught on coral that sometimes
juts sharply toward the surface in these
seas? Or had currents sucked the
lines into entanglements on the ocean
bottom itself? Whatever the explana¬
tion, the breaking of the main line was
a disaster. The fishermen cursed
their luck and, especially, they cursed
Misaki for bringing them here. But
their bitterness did not detract from
the diligence of their search for the
buoys that might mean recovery of
the lines.
The Lucky Dragon searched that
night and the following two days, find¬
ing only a few buoys with short lengths
of line attached. The day after that,
Misaki gave up the search. With
almost half his line lost, he called
together the captain, chief engineer,
radioman, boatswain, and chief deck-
man to determine their course of
action. They would of course continue
fishing, for they still had enough line
and fuel to make a respectable catch.
"I believe we should go north,"
Misaki said. "There are high-priced
fish there."
"This old ship could not stand the
rough seas of the north," Kuboyama
objected.
"The main bearing of the engine has
already burned out once," Yamamoto
said. "It would be very dangerous if
this should happen again In a storm
such as is common in the north."
The others sided with Kuboyama and
Yamamoto, who proposed instead that
they go south to the calmer seas of
the Marshall Islands. There should
be big-eyed tuna there, they argued.
At length Misaki agreed.
With Its fortune running true, the
Lucky Dragon turned south to avoid
storms and quickly ran into a bad
one. Engine trouble followed. But
when clear skies finally did appear,
the spirits of the crew rose and fishing
was resumed.
On March 1 a few minutes after
three o'clock in the morning Misaki
gave the order to start fishing. It
was still dark when the throwing of
the lines was completed two and a
half hours later. Misaki ordered the
engine cut, and the Lucky Dragon drift¬
ed silently in the sea.
Some of the crew were sleeping;
others were below deck preparing for
breakfast. The few who were topside
were suddenly amazed when a huge
incandescence arose on the western
horizon. Yellowish white light flash-

the fishermen exclaim
ed over the sea and against the clouds
that partially covered the sky. The
brilliance became a glaring yellow, and
then a blazing orange. The fisher¬
man watched in awe. One of them
rushed below and excitedly told his
shipmates, "The sun rises in the
westl"
"What could this be?" the men
asked each other frantically. Almost
Immediately it was suggested that
they might have witnessed a pika-don
a compound word meaning "thunder-
flash" that entered the Japanese lan¬
guage after the bombing of Hiroshima.
"But if it's a pika-don." Kuboyama
wondered, "where is the mushroom in
the sky?" True, there was no mush¬
room, and soon the great light began
to fade. Some of those who had been
sleeping, like Captain Tsutsui, found
that by the time they reached the deck
pre-dawn darkness had returned.
Just as the men were beginning to
calm down, about seven minutes after
the beginning of the flash, the Lucky
Dragon was seized with a violent shak¬
ing. A few seconds later two reports
that sounded like distant rifle shots
were heard. The sailors threw them¬
selves to the deck and covered their
heads.
42
HEN quiet returned, the
debate was resumed over the strange
occurences. Some suggested that
the U.S. Navy might be holding
gunnery practice. Others guessed
again that they must have seen a
pika-don. Shrewd Kuboyama made
a simple calculation based on the
difference in time between the sight¬
ing of the flash and the arrival of
the sound wave that shook the Lucky
Dragon. "We must be about 87 miles
away from where the flash took place,"
he said. Misaki consulted his charts.
About 85 miles away, in the direction
from which the light had come, lay
Bikini Atoll. Whatever the flash was,
It had come from Bikini.
Since the long line was still out, a
decision had to be made. Should It
be cut so the Lucky Dragon could
leave the area immediately? Many
thought so. They were afraid that If
there had been a bomb test an Ameri¬
can reconnaissance aircraft might spot
them, and the crew watched the sky
anxiously. They recalled that when a
small Japanese fishing boat had disap¬
peared without trace In fair weather
in 1952, it had been rumored that Ame¬
rican guns had sunk it. They felt sure
that the Americans would not hesitate
to provide a similar fate for the Lucky
Dragon.
Misaki consulted the officers; then
he ordered the lines hauled In. The
crew made haste to get the job done.
After they had been working about
two hours, a strange fog formed in
the sky. Then a drizzle of very small
whitish flakes began to fall on the
Lucky Dragon. The fishermen brush¬
ed them out of their eyes, noses,
mouths, hair. "It ¡s a sandstorm at
seal" exclaimed one.
Kuboyama took off his straw hat to
observe the ashlike particles. Could
they be salt? He tasted a flake. It
had no taste, nor did it have an odour.
The radioman noted that the ash had
become so thick on the deck that he
left footprints as he walked.
Leaning over his charts, Misaki con¬
sidered a sample of the ash. It had
substance. It might be volcanic; it
might be coral ... He recalled the
eruption of Krakatoa, which had spread
cinders for thousands of miles around,
But his charts showed no active volca¬
noes in the area. Captain Tsutsui, who
was steering, suggested that if the
morning's flash had been a pika-don,
then it might be coral dust that was
falling on them. Mlsaki's charts could
not confirm this either. The Lucky
Dragon was outside the restricted area
that fishing boats were not supposed to
enter. Eniwetok, which the Maritime
Safety Board had warned them about,
was three hundred miles to the west.
Could the Americans have had a bomb
test at Bikini instead?
Some of the deckhands complained
that the white dust hurt their eyes.
Nevertheless, the work went ahead,
and after six hours the line was all
in. Only nine fish were caught, seven
of them big-eyed tuna. These were
cleaned on deck, with the white ash
coming down on them steadily.
Finally the flakes stopped falling. The
Lucky Dragon headed north on its
homeward journey.
s=lEA spray and breezes
carried away most of the thin blanket
of white ash that covered the main
deck and other exposed surfaces.
But the flakes clung in corners, in cre¬
vices of the deck and hull, in the wet
lines, and in the rims of portholes.
Most of the men took baths. Kuboya¬
ma, who remained uneasy about the
mysterious dust, went below with the
others to wash himself thoroughly.
The men talked more of their poor
catch than of the white dust. They
would arrive in Yaizu when prices for
fish were high, but they would have
little to sell. This would mean hard
times for their families, and this wor¬
ried them.
Chief Engineer Yamamoto, who had
been on deck during most of the driz¬
zle of ashes, had felt nausea at lunch
timé and had not eaten. In the en¬
gine room he Jiad difficulty reading
the dials. He "took a nap to restore

himself, but when he awoke he felt
worse. His eyes were clogged with
a sticky discharge, and the engine
room dials were harder than ever to
read.
Other members of the crew had
similar symptoms. At dinner time
many of them complained of not being
hungry. To bolster their drooping mor¬
ale Kuboyama produced a bottle of
sake that he had hoarded for a special
treat. The men drank it, but it did not
help.
In succeeding days, the crew con¬
tinued to wonder about the "sand¬
storm", they had seen at sea. One
sailor gathered a sample of the dust
In a piece of paper and gave it to
Kuboyama. As he accepted it, the
radioman admired its whiteness "like
the coral of an atoll" and suggested
that they must have it examined after
their return to Yaizu. Kuboyama put
the packet under his pillow, where he
slept on it every night until they
reached port.
A variety of ailments befell the crew.
At first they complained of itching
skin, especially around the hands and
neck. Their faces turned a leaden
colour, darker than the robust hue of
a tropical sun tan. There were com¬
plaints of fever, nausea, loss of appe¬
tite, general weakness, diarrhoea, scalp
sores, and runny eyes. Yet none of
the crew was confined to bed for the
entire homeward voyage.
The feeling grew that they had indeed
seen a pika-don. Kuboyama read in
one of his books about the bombing
of Hiroshima to see if he could unco¬
ver a clue as to why .there was so
much illness among the crew. But at
Hiroshima all the people injured had
been within a few miles of the explo¬
sion. The Lucky Dragon was 85 miles
from Bikini on March 1, so how could
there be a connexion?
His last doubts vanished during a
talk with Boatswain Kawashima. When
Kawashlma happened to scratch the
side of his head, his hand came away
with a tuft of black hair on it. "My hair
is falling outl" he exclaimed. The
sailors were amused. Kuboyama
playfully snatched at Kawashlma's
head, and he too pulled off a wad of
hair. Before long the clutches of his
companions had shorn Kawashima of
most of the hair on the left side of
his head.
Kuboyama soon found out that
others of the crew also had falling
hair. . Then he recalled that loss of
hair was one of the symptoms of
"atomic bomb disease" after the
attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
He wondered if somehow the strange
ash had caused the men to be hurt
by radioactivity. He sought out Mi¬
saki to discuss his thoughts. They
agreed that the men should go to the
hospital immediately after landing.
0 N Sunday, March 14, after
fifty-one days at sea, the Lucky Dragon
drew into her home port of Yaizu. The
owner, Nishikawa, and a few others
were on the pier to meet her. Nishi¬
kawa was much more disturbed by the
sickness of the crew than by the small
catch and the loss of line. He was
shocked by the muddy colour of their
faces.
Kuboyama did not follow his own
advice. Instead of going to the hos¬
pital he first dropped off some wireless
equipment at a friend's house and then
he continued home. He held a towel
around his face so that people would
not stare at him because of his strange
pigmentation. For the same reason he
entered his own home by the back
door.
"Daddy's homel" called out one of
his three daughters. As he embraced
his wife and children, Miyako, his
oldest daughter, said with surprise in
her voice, "How black Daddy is. He
looks like a Negro."
After a while the children went out-

KUBOYAMA (Continued)
At 3 a.m. on March 1,
1964, the crew of the
"Lucky Dragon" saw
an Immense fiery light
on the western horizon.
One man suggested it
might be a "pika don"
(thunderflash), as the
Japanese call an atomic
explosion. The ship
was only 85 miles
from Bikini Atoll.

side to play, and then Kuboyama told
his wife about the atomic explosion
they had seen and the white ash that
had fallen on them. "Don't worry,"
he said, "I will be all right." In a while
he left, saying he was going to the
doctor. But instead he returned to
the Lucky Dragon, where he made
some repairs to his wireless.
Some of the crew did go to the hos¬
pital. The doctor, who did not have
a Geiger counter, told the fishermen
they had no serious trouble. But
Misaki urged that two of the men be
sent to Tokyo to see an expert on
atomic sickness. The doctor In charge
reluctantly agreed to write a letter of
introduction to such an expert for
them.
The pair caught an early train the
following day to Tokyo. In the hospi¬
tal the doctors were startled when they
held a Geiger counter to one of the
fishermen's heads; it clicked loudly,
showing he was radioactive. They
decided to go to Yaizu to see the rest
of the fishermen.
Since the small port of Yaizu did
not have its own daily newspaper, it
was two days before the Yomiuri
Shimbun In Tokyo learned of the Lucky
Dragon story and broke it in front-page
banner headlines. It quickly spread
around the world. Reporters and pho¬
tographers flocked to Yaizu. When
scientists arrived they held their Gei¬
ger counters over the deck of the
Lucky Dragon and were astounded at
the fierce rattling sound. Fear struck
the crew members when Geiger coun¬
ters held near their heads chattered
ominously. Within a few days all
twenty-three fishermen had been mov¬
ed to two hospitals in Tokyo.
One scientist as soon as he read
the story, took his Geiger counter to
the marketplace at Osaka. He tested
various tuna and found only normal
radioactivity about twenty counts per
minute. But then he checked one from
Yaizu that caused his Geiger counter
to emit two thousand clicks per minute.
It made such a noise that bystanders
gasped. "The fish are crying!" From
then on, the contaminated fish were
known as "crying fish."
Since fish is a staple of the Japa¬
nese diet, the "crying fish" caused a
panic in the markets of the country.
Prices slumped as housewives refus¬
ed to buy fish. The Misaki market
shut its doors on March 19; the Yoko¬
hama market was next; then the Tokyo
Central Wholesale Market closed for
the first time since the cholera epi¬
demic of 1935. Shopkeepers posted
signs stating: OUR FISH ARE NOT
RADIOACTIVE. Customers were not
convinced.
The attention of the nation focused
on the twenty-three hospitalized
fishermen. Their white cell counts fell
alarmingly. The normal count is from
five thousand to nine thousand cells
per cubic millimeter. After several
weeks the counts of the Lucky Dragon
crew fell below four thousand; in two
cases it went as low as eight hundred
and a thousand. By May the men
were also sterile.

Toward the end of June more than
two-thirds of the crew including Kubo¬
yama came down with jaundice. Ku-
boyama's recovery was slower than
the rest but by August 5 he felt well
enough to be the crew's spokesman
at a press conference. Then the
radioman's condition took a turn for
the worse. On September 1 he told
his wife, "It's no use any more. My
sufferings are too great."
Kuboyama slipped into unconscious¬
ness, and was put on the critical list.
He rallied several days later to the
point where he could eat and recognize
his friends. But on September 20 he
was again in critical condition, although
fully conscious. He said, "My body
feels like it is being burned with elec¬
tricity. Under my body there must be
a high tension wire."
The family again gathered at his bed¬
side. "I will get well," he told his
mother. "Promise me so," she said,
and he replied, "Yes, I will hold out."
It was late in the afternoon of Septem¬
ber 23 when Kuboyama began his last
fight for life. His family, his fellow
fishermen and his doctor were with
him as he fought.
Shortly before seven o'clock that
evening, the doctor examined "Kuboya¬
ma with his stethoscope. He turned
to the family and said quietly, "It is
his last moment." The doctor buried
his face in his hands and sobbed.
"Alkichi, you break your promise!"
his mother cried. Kuboyama was silent.
His eyes opened and his face stared
vacantly. Kuboyama's wife touched a
tiny cup of water the symbol of a last
earthly drink to his lips. Kuboya¬
ma was dead.
Everyone present including the
fishermen who had so loved him wept
without restraint. The crowd that had
gathered outside the hospital to pray
for the fisherman was told of his death.
Moments later the news was flashed
by radio and television. Throughout
the night messages of sympathy
including many from ships thousands
of miles at sea, arrived at the hospital.
The following day the American am¬
bassador sent a letter of condolence
with a check for a million yen to
Mrs. Kuboyama.
Kuboyama's body was cremated and
his ashes placed in an urn. His widow,
dressed in the traditional black
kimono with the family crest, carried
the urn in the funeral procession in
Yaizu. His eldest daughter clutched
a wooden mortuary tablet on which
were inscribed the words, "The soul
of the deceased Aikichi Kuboyama"
while his second girl carried a photo¬
graph of her father. At the end of
the ceremony two hundred university
students sang "A-Bomb Never For¬
given" and a score of white pigeons
were released In the air. Then the
urn was placed In a marble vault In
the mountainside above Kuboyama's
native Yaizu where It remains today.
Why did Kuboyama die?
Fatalists will say that Kuboyama was
on a collision course with death and
All over Japan people waited
anxiously for news of the

On September 1, Kuboyama told his
wife: "It's no use any more. My
sufferings are too great."
that there was nothing he could do
about it. Is the world likewise on a
collision course with death ? Are we
sailing our ships of state into waters
upon which death will rain from the
sky? There have always been wars
and we have changed nothing so as to
make war impossible; therefore it is
logical that there should be a war. A
war In which most or all of us will
perish.
Or can we reject fatalism and deter¬
mine our own destiny? Can we un¬
derstand the historical forces that
threaten us and bend them to our will?
Can we smash down these weapons
that have grown too terrible for man
to endure? Can we build a world
order in which the hostilities among
men and nations will be dealt with
through law not force? Can men of
all colours, religions, economic sys¬
tems and ideologies live together on
this planet without engaging in mass
murder?
These are the questions that face
us as a society and that face each of
us as individuals. Are we as helpless
before them as was Kuboyama? If the
answer is Yes, then the radioman will
have been the first of many millions of
victims of the thermonuclear age. But
if the answer is No, then we may be
able to count him as the last victim.
