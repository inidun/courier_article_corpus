PUSHKIN
His gallery
of portraits
ALEXANDER SERGEYEVICH PUSHKIN,
poet, dramatist, novelist and
author of tales, was the first of
the giants of literature of modern Rus¬
sia. He was strongly influenced by the
Romantic movement, especially by
Lord Byron, and had a profound
knowledge of European literature,
translating many works from English
into Russian. Though he was no pro¬
fessional painter, drawing and sketch¬
ing occupied an important place in his
life. His manuscripts and notebooks
are covered with innumerable drawings
of the characters he was describing in
his works, his friends, the women he
loved, members of his family, as well
as Russian and foreign literary figures.
One of his biographers has called,
Pushkin's drawings "his graphic diary".
(1) This self-portrait of Pushkin
showing him "On the Road to Erze-
rum" to participate in the Russo-Tur-
kish war in 1829 was drawn by the poet
on a draft page of his tale Voyage to
Erzerum. Despite the Czar's opposition,
he had gone off to the Caucasus. He
found himself in trouble on his return
to St. Petersburg.
(2) Pushkin and Onegin. This
sketch shows the author with the hero
of his masterpiece novel in verse Eugene
Onegin. They are leaning on a para¬
pet along the River Neva at St. Peters¬
burg opposite the Peter and Paul
fortress. The drawing was part of a
letter which Pushkin wrote to his
brother Leon asking him to have a
professional artist do an illustration
based on It for the first chapter of his
book. The illustration was never made
however. As a rule, Pushkin never
intended to publish his own drawings.
The year 1830 marks the beginning
of what was probably the most fertile
and intensive period in Pushkin's life.
Drawing (3) made at the end of 1830
illustrates a manuscript page of his
short story The Coffin Maker. It shows
two characters in the story, the Ger¬
man cobbler Gotlieb Schultz, left, hav¬
ing a glass of tea with Andrian Prok-
horov, the coffin maker. Between
them, he added a Russian samovar.
Among the many sketches and draw¬
ings left by the author of Boris Godun-
ov and The Queen of Spades, one finds
a series of sketches of Anna Alexevyena
Olenina with whom he was passionately
in love in 1828. She is depicted in (4)
in profile, with an opulent, upswept
hairdress which hides all but a few
features of her face. Another portrait
of Oleninain verse this timewas
done by Pushkin, entitled "Her eyes".
The amusing sketch of a "Mouj Ik
and his glass of vodka" (5) was drawn
by Pushkin in 1834, three years before
his death in a duel at the age of 38.
