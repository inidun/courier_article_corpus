AMADA
A whole temple
moved on rails
On the left bank of the Nile, about 200 kilometres south of
Aswan, a notable feat of engineering has been taking place.
Here, the jewel-temple of Amada, built over 3,000 years ago
during the New Empire was being transported to its now
oasis site as a single unit over a distance of 2.600 metres
(1.6 miles) and raised to a height of 65 metres (215 feet)
to set two world records for horizontal and vertical displace¬
ment. The seven halls of the temple are decorated with rich
inscriptions and paintings of delicate beauty. It was considered
impossible to dismantle the building stone by stone. Tho
method adopted is the one employed for moving various
types of buildings on rails even over unstable terrain. Vehicles
carrying hydraulic jacks (above) maintain constant support
while compensating for variations in the grade of the railbed.
The moving force comes from special double-action jacks
which are anchored on the rails after each inch by inch ope¬
ration. These are activated by two high pressure hydraulic
pumps. Drawings below show, from left to right, concrete
supports placed under the temple; the building will be sta¬
bilized to prevent any movement of blocks, and finally removed
on vehicles set on three sets of tracks to compensate for Tiding
and descending slopes and curves. The operations are being
carried out by French engineers at a cost of $237,000 after
United Arab Republic dismantling of the front of the sanctuary.
