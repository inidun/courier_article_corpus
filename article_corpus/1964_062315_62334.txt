World War XII, as everybody knows, brought
about the collapse of civilization
Towns, cities and villages disappeared from
the earth
Men, women, and children became lower
than the lower animals
Years and years went by
She told other humans that the last flower
was dying but only one young man paid
any attention


THE LAST FLOWER
by James Thurber
In 1939 just before the world was plunged into World War II the American
humorist, James Thurber, published "The Last Flower", a parable in pictures on
the theme of war and peace. With the advent of the Atom Bomb and in the light
of man's present capacity to devastate the world, Thurber's work today three
years after his death takes on even greater depth and meaning and points as
never before to the need for disarmament. The book first published by Harper
& Brothers, New York, was dedicated to "Rosemary, in the wistful hope that her
world will be better than mine."

All the groves and forests were destroyed.. ...And all the works of art
Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted
their fallen masters
Emboldened by the pitiful condition of the
former lords of the earth, rabbits descended
upon them
Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other
blankly, for love had passed from the earth
One day a young girl who had never seen a
flower chanced to come upon the last one
in the world
Together the young man and the girl nurtured
the flower and it began to live again
Before long there were two flowers, and then
four, and then a great many

THE LAST FLOWER (Cont'd)
Groves and forests flourished again Love was reborn into the world Dogs came out of their exile
Towns, cities and villages sprang up Troubadours and jugglers came back into
the world
And painters and poets
And soldiers And still more soldiers The liberators set fire to the discontent
So presently the world was at war again This time the destruction was so complete.,
Except one man And one woman
..That nothing was left in the world
And one flower
