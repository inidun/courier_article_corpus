UNESCO Radio is different, unique
even, according to some listeners.
Unesco began to produce radio
programmes in the late 1940s. The aim
has always been to contribute to the
understanding of the ideals that the
Organization stands for, through dis¬
cussion of issues in the fields of edu¬
cation, science, culture and commu¬
nication.
Around fifteen 30-minute feature
programmes are produced each year in
English, French, Spanish or Russian.
Their subjects, chosen on the basis of
their interest both for UNESCO and the
general public, cover a vast field rang
ing from Aids to astronomy, from bio¬
diversity to bioethics, from street chil¬
dren to indigenous peoples, from the
violence of war to the culture of peace.
The programme catalogue contains
hundreds of recordings which are
offered on tape or cassette to over 400
national, public and community radios
in all parts of the world (257 stations
broadcasting in English, 60 in French,
60 in Spanish and 42 in Russian) as
well as to international short-wave
broadcasters.
For the last two years, UNESCO
Radio has been taking part in the
Nexus-International Broadcasting
Association Internet experiment of
RealAudio on demand. All UNESCO
progammes will shortly be available
via the Nexus RealAudio server (for
details, consult http://www.ncxus.
org/IRN) and will eventually be put
on UNESCO's Internet site.

scriptions may be obtained from:

Radio transmits sounds over long distances
using waves, invisible electric impulses that
travel through the atmosphere and space.
These waves, known as Hertzian waves
(from the name of the German physicist
Heinrich Hertz, who demonstrated their
use in 1 888) or radio waves (from the Latin
word radius = ray) travel at the speed of
light (300,000 km per second).
To make a radio connection, a trans¬
mitter and a receiver arc needed, each con¬
nected to an antenna. The waves travel
between the two antennae in some cases
by bouncing back from certain layers of
the atmosphere. Satellite transmission sys¬
tems exist today.
Sound vibrations arc changed into
electrical waves, which are then changed
into radio waves by the transmitter. The
radio waves are picked up by the receiving
antenna and changed back into an electri¬
cal signal which is amplified and further
processed before being changed back into
sound by the loudspeaker.
There are different kinds of waves.
Long waves cover almost 2,000 km.
Medium waves travel a few hundred km.
Short waves can travel all round the world.
Amplitude modulation (AM) is a
broadcasting method in which the sound
changes the power of the wave. Frequency
modulation (FM), which guarantees bet¬
ter quality reception, is a method in which
the sound changes the frequency of the
wave.
In simple terms, it may be said that
the transmitter codes the signals, the
waves carry them and the receiver decodes
them.
