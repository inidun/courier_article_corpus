Half of Kenya’s children drop out of primary school.
Efforts to provide them with vocational training, formally or 
on the job, are yielding modest but promising results

In a poor area of Nairobi, under a
blazing sun, fif t e e n - year-old Reuben
is making wooden stools. He and two
f e l l ow apprentices have chosen to learn
c a rp e n t ry.
“I really like this way of learning by
working,” he says,“but I’d also like to get
some training at a school so I can get a
diploma.”
When he ended his formal educat i o n
by dropping out of primary school,he had
obtained no cert i fic ate or technical
q u a l i fic ations—a common situation in a
c o u n t ry where most young people leave
school at primary level without being able
to get a job afterwards.

apprenticed into two trades, h a i r d r e s s i n g
and dressmaking.
Despite sat i s fa c t o ry results, M i l l i c e n t
had to break off her education duri n g
s e c o n d a ry school when her parents, w h o
had little money, decided that her brother
should be the one to be educat e d . But they
offered to send her to a Catholic missionary
school which taught girls dressmaking. S h e
did not complete the course there either,
once again for lack of money. “However I
did learn how to make simple clothes for
women and children,” she said,“ but I really
wanted to complete the training so I could
be fully qualified.”
So she went off to Nairobi and with
help from her uncle found an
apprenticeship in a dressmaking shop.
T h e r e , she worked alongside other gi r l s ,
some of whom had not been able to fin i s h
their schooling because of unwa n t e d
p r e g n a n c i e s. This problem affects nearly
10,000 Kenyan girls eve ry ye a r , r e d u c i n g

Apprenticeships
for street children
John was born in Mathare,a poor part
of Nairobi. He was brought up by a mother
who was unable to provide for the family.
When he was eight years old,he became a
“parking boy ” , or street child. A f t e r
spending three ye a rs at a community centre
which cares for such children,he returned
to wandering the streets of the capital and
was eventually arrested by the police, who
threw him in jail for a few we e k s. “ T h e y

were taken in by the Undugu Society,” a
C atholic organization which looks after
c h i l d r e n , p r ovides them with a basic
e d u c ation and finds them jobs with
craftsmen who gi ve them a technical
training paid for by the Society.“I saw kids
l e a rn to be carp e n t e rs that way, so I decided
to do that too,” said Jo h n , who was then
apprenticed to a woodworker.
“This kind of rehabilitation aims to help
young people do productive work by
placing them in a workshop run by a
craftsman respected for his ability to train
p e o p l e ,” said a teacher at the Undugu
Society. Social workers advise the children
on the choice of a trade and visit them each
week in their workshops to see how they
are getting on and to organize on a step-
by-step basis their preparation for working
life.As well as street children,the Undugu

Qualified 
but jobless
Despite the gove rn m e n t ’s efforts to
encourage technical educat i o n , the netwo r k
of some 2,000 public and pri vate vo c at i o n a l
training centres absorbs little more than
one per cent of the school-age population.
These institutions attract young people
with a good school record whose poorly-
e d u c ated parents have the means to pay the
fees. But the centres have serious financial
p r o b l e m s , despite the support of
development aid organizations.
Some centres, like the “ yo u t h
polytechnics”, do not always have enough
funds to equip their workshops and raise
cash from the local community and from
selling items made by the yo u n g
apprentices. All the same, the apprentices
manage to acquire some qualific at i o n s , bu t
m a ny surveys show that in spite of their
technical education only a few of them fin d
a job when they leave.Good qualifications
seem to be less important than knowing the
right person when looking for a job
commensurate with the training they have
received.
In recent ye a rs , vo c ational training
centres have been criticized because of their
high running costs, the relat i vely few places
available in them and the lack of results as
regards placing apprentices in jobs.
In view of this problem and a situation
in which more than half the country ’s
children drop out of school eve ry year after
p ri m a ry educat i o n , the Kenyan authori t i e s
h ave begun to reform the educat i o n a l
system (see box ) . The length of pri m a ry
schooling has been extended from seve n
ye a rs to eight and now includes some
technical education.The goal is to give the
children some practical skills so they can
m ove on to some kind of training or
professional activity in the jua kali sector.
At the same time, the government has
launched a major initiative to support and
boost the prestige of these kinds of jobs. It

is estimated that the sector can prov i d e
about 90,000 professional jobs for yo u n g
people each year. After receiving technical

s y s t e m atically look for white-collar jobs
when they leave school.
Abdi is an apprentice in a garage,
l e a rning about electricity and mechanics.
“My parents are fa rm e rs in Eldoret and
they couldn’t afford to pay for me to go to
school,” he says. “So I came to Nairobi to
live with my uncle who introduced me to
the owner of this garage.” Abdi intends to
get solid qualifications so he can go on to a
polytechnic and get a diploma and then a
job “in a big garage.”
Reuben too hopes he wo n ’t always be a
jua kali, making stools: “I’m too young to
work,” he says. “After my apprenticeship, I
want to take courses at a technical school so
I can eventually set up my own carpentry
business.” He would then,in turn,take on
his own apprentices, children forced, l i k e
him,to drop out of school. n
