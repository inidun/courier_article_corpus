YET FOUND

An honest shepherd is shocked to see his

Q̂
ince the publication of its January issue
\J in colour, devoted in part to Persian
miniatures, the unesco courier has
received a report of the recent discovery
of 109 Persian miniatures which represent
the oldest yet found. The miniatures
decorate the original manuscript (or a con¬
temporary copy) of the Andarz Nameh, a
collection of sage counsels, admonitions and
tales written by Kabus Vushmgir, a Persian
ruler on the shores of the Caspian Sea in
the 11th century. Until this discovery it
had hitherto been believed that the earli¬
est extant Persian miniatures dated from
the end of the 13th century following the
Mongol invasions, when Iran was thorough¬
ly ravaged, its cities were sacked and its
great libraries containing thousands of ma¬
nuscripts or miniatures were destroyed. This
recently discovered manuscript is consider¬
ed of tremendous importance both for the
miniatures it contains and its literary value.
