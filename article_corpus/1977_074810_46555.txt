" f^ OMMUNICATION is news
today. I am glad that
^^ Unesco should be the
forum for a far-reaching debate which
is in full accordance with its mission."
With these words, spoken in Novem¬
ber 1976 during Unesco's General
Conference at Nairobi, the Organiza¬
tion's Director-General, Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow, drew attention to a
major problem of the modern world.
What is at stake in this debate?
And why should it be held within
Unesco?
The first and most obvious point to
be made is that information today
means powertechnological power
and political powerboth within
countries and at the international
level.
But this power is unevenly distri¬
buted. Decisions governing its use
are, undeniably, increasingly taken
in those countries which possess
highly developed facilities for the
production, storage and transmission
of information. Generally speaking,
the world of information and commu¬
nication is dominated by the Western
media (press, radio, TV, films, pub¬
lishing, etc.).
One example speaks volumes. On
25 November 1975, Surinam (for-,
merly Dutch Guiana) became inde- f

, pendent. Between 24 and 27 No¬
vember this event occupied only
3 per cent of the space devoted to
foreign news by 16 leading daily
newspapers in 13 Latin American
countries. This 3 per cent came in
its entirety from international news
agencies of the industrialized coun¬
tries. And yet Surinam, a country
somewhat larger than England, is the
world's third biggest producer of
bauxite.
During the same four days, 70 per
cent of the foreign news published
by these newspapers concerned the
industrialized countries, and four-
fifths of this news originated in the
same news agencies.
Such an example helps to explain
why the developing countries find it
hard to accept a situation in which
they are mere "consumers" of a
"product" (information) over whose
manufacture and distribution they
have no control: a product which is,
moreover, as important culturally as
economically, if not more so. Could
it be that the world is divided into
those who can make their voices
heard because they have the means
to do so, and those who cannot?
This, perhaps, is the heart of the
matter.
"The dissemination of information
is largely a one-way process,"
Mr. M'Bow has also pointed out.


tional, scientific and cultural mate¬
rial, etc.) and a Declaration of
guiding principles on the use of
satellite broadcasting.
But since its creation 30 years ago,
Unesco has grown. Its representa¬
tive character (and today it has 141
Member States) has been enriched
by the membership of many newly
independent Third World countries.
This growth has posed a new pro¬
blem, that of progressively elimina¬
ting the gulf between the industriali¬
zed world and the developing coun¬
tries.
Unesco is engaged in reflection on
the establishment of the "new world
order" which has been on the agenda
of the United Nations since 1974.
To a great extent, this new order
will depend on improved access to
information, on more effective com¬
munication, on a more equitable
distribution of the mass media with
their immense potential for promo¬
ting mutual understanding between
men and nations, and ultimately on
ensuring that information becomes
once again a liberating force rather
than an instrument of subjection.
The present imbalance is not
merely economic. It also has grave
cultural implications, erasing national
values and replacing them by a silent.
invisible, yet deep-rooted state of
dependence. The very principle of
cultural identity is called in question
when the "transmitter" of information
enjoys technological superiority over
its "receiver."
Since the early 1 970s, the emer¬
gence of the Third World and the
urgency of the problems to be solved
have led to an awareness of the need
to claim and defend this identity and
to use it in support of a fresh, global
approach to the whole question of
development. This is why cultural
policies as well as communication
policies (and, indeed, the two are
inseparable) should be incorporated i
in all development efforts. I
According to Unesco's
Statistical Yearbook, the
latest edition of which
has just been published,
there was a world total
of 922 million radio
receivers in 1974.
But the distribution of
these radios was highly
uneven: in the industrially
developed countries
there were 700 receivers
for every 1,000 of the
population, compared
with only 205 per 1,000
in Latin America, 132 in
the Arab States, 93 in
Asia (excluding China)
and as few as 72 in
Africa. Right, community

Right, "reading-room" in a village in
Colombia. In 1974, this Latin
American country had 36 daily
newspapers, with a total circulation
of about a million and a half copies
per day. These figures are very low for
a country with 24 million inhabitants
where, in the same year, less than
20 per cent of those over the age
of 15 were illiterate. Below, right,

At the present time, more and more
Member States, aware that Unesco
has accumulated a wealth of expe¬
rience throughout the world, are
seeking its help in clarifying their
communication and information pro¬
blems and in formulating appropriate
policies. Unesco only intervenes at
the specific request of its Member
States and in accordance with the
instructions of its sovereign body,
the General Conference. It has no
communication policy of its own to
suggest to its Member States.
The first conference at which repre¬
sentatives of governments from a
single region met to consider the
question of communication policies
was held at San José, Costa Rica,
in July 1976. Bringing together
delegates from Latin American and
Caribbean countries, it was a land¬
mark in the quest for a mutual enrich¬
ment of cultures and a genuine rap¬
prochement between peoples.
The protection of journalists
At a press conference in Nairobi (Kenya) in November
1976, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, Unesco's Director-
General, made this appeal on behalf of journalists:
"The right to communicate poses in its widest sense
the problem of the responsibility of journalists both as
individuals engaged in a professional activity and as
groups wielding considerable power. In this connexion,
Unesco is contributing to the creation of a universally
applicable code of ethics and duties... But what I wish
to stress here is the need to ensure the effective protec¬
tion of journalists themselves from the arbitrary exercise
of power as they endeavour to fulfil their mission in a
spirit of the strictest objectivity. For it must be admitted
that respect for ethical standards can place journalists in
dangerous situations if they do not enjoy the guarantee
of adequate protection from pressures and reprisals..."

} cracy itselfassumes the participa¬
tion of the largest possible number
in the process of communication."
More recently, however, at
Unesco's General Conference, a draft
declaration on the fundamental prin¬
ciples governing the use of the mass
media revealed wide divergencies of
opinion derived from different concep¬
tions of the role of the mass media.
But on this occasion, with the aim
of reaching the widest possible
consensus, the Conference decided
to send the whole project back to the
drawing board before re-examining it
again in 1978.
In the meantime, the Director
General has been invited "to pay
very special attention to the activities
of the bodies responsible for co-ordi¬
nating and implementing the infor¬
mation programme of the non-aligned
countries".
This programme, based on recom¬
mendations adopted by the non-
aligned countries in Tunis, New Delhi
and Colombo during 1976, is concer¬
ned mainly with improving national
and international news-gathering
networks, strengthening news agency
pools and"since respect for ethical
standards is not without its risks"
giving support to journalists' unions.
The question of information has
now assumed an importance which
is unlikely to diminish in the fore¬
seeable future. This is not only
because, in accordance with instruc¬
tions from its Member States, Unesco
will be holding a series of meetings
similar to the Costa Rica Conference
in each region of the world, together
with many meetings between profes¬
sionals, but above all because the
countries "on the receiving end" of
information are increasingly emphatic
in demanding a fair right to reply.
For its part, Unesco intends no
longer to confine itself to speaking
generally about "freedom of expres¬
sion" and "freedom of informa¬
tion", but also to talk in terms of
"access to and participation in com¬
munication" and a "balanced flow of
information."
What it is endeavouring to define
is a new concept of the right to com¬
municate. Without powers of its*
own, whether economic or of any
other kind, Unesco must rely on its
powers of persuasion and on its
capacity to promote ideas.
