SUDAKOV,
of the USSR, is the editor-in-
chief of the Central
Department of Geodesy and
Cartography, which is
responsible to the USSR
Council of Ministers. He is a
member of the editorial boards
of a number of major
cartographic publications and
the Soviet Union's permanent
representative on the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic
Research (SCAR) working
group on geodesy and
geological information.

heights for the entire area of the Soviet Union.
Heights and co-ordinates throughout the country
had to be determined with great accuracy in rela¬
tion to the Baltic Sea and the reference point at
Pulkovo near Leningrad. This in turn required
astronomic and gravimetric work throughout the
country, the development of triangulation and
levelling grids, and the construction of tens of
thousands of geodetic signs, some of them over
40 metres high.
The late 1930s and the eve of the Second
World War were a time of universal suspicion,
mistrust and spy mania in our country. Measures
were taken to protect information, including
information about topography. Detailed large-
scale maps that had had limited circulation were
made secret. But the objective formulated for
Russian cartography over 150 years ago, "the col¬
lection and distribution in Russia and beyond of
as full and reliable data about our native land as
possible", was never abandoned. In 1947, the
Chief Department of Geodesy and Cartography
was awarded the Gold Medal of the Geographic
Society for having completed the state map of the
USSR to a scale of 1:1,000,000.
This success made it possible to start work
on a new 1:2,500,000 (1 cm = 25 km) map, which
in the 1950s served as the basis of a series of
detailed regional maps. These years also saw the
start of planning for a project unheard-of in any

other country: large-scale (1:25,000, i.e. 1 cm =
250 m) surveys of the entire territory of the Soviet
Union. The effort took some forty years and over
250,000 maps were produced.
In the early 1960s, certain maps began to dis¬
appear from the shops. The small-scale maps that
were produced to replace them inherited old mis¬
takes and distortions and incorporated new ones.
The location of sites in relation to the carto¬
graphic grid was changed. Geographical co¬
ordinates were no longer shown on maps that
were transformed into schematic representations
of low, information value. This practice was
rendered meaningless by the development of
space imagery, but we continued to publish maps
of the Aral Sea coast as it was traditionally seen,
for instance, while maps produced in other coun¬
tries using space technology showed its actual
state.
Although some restrictions have now been
lifted, there are still many problems. The mili¬
tary think that circulation of detailed
topographical maps is premature, especially those
on the 1:100,000 and the 1:25,000 scales. But
tourists are attracted above all to little-known
forests and mountains, the parks near Leningrad,
the towns and countryside of old Russia. People
want to get to know their own country, and to
be able to explore it on foot. For this they need
reliable large-scale maps.
