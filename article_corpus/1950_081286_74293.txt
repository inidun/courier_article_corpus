FILMS TEACH
IT was market day whenthey arrived in Shih Tze
Hsiang, a woman and
three men in a car. Most
of the children were off
the streets, shouting their
lessons in the school as
their fathers and great
grandfathers had done in
their day. Everyone stopp-
ed whatever he was doing
to look. It wasn't every
day in a provincial town of
Szechuan, far in the interior
of China, that four
strangers arrived, and in a
car loaded with strange
wheels and boxes.
The four who arrived in
Shih Tze Hsiang on market
day were from Unesco's Fund-
amental Education Audio-
Visun. 1 Project at Pehpei, about
40 miles north of Chungking,
from a very different kind of
school to the one in the old
temple where the young
children were learning their
lessons. The woman in the
car was Dr Clara Nutting,
medical supervisor of the
mission, and the men were
Hugh H u b b a r d, Unesco's
Regional Representative in
China, and two members of
the Pehpei Mission, Wang Te-
wei and Fan Wei-Ch'uan.
As they drove along the streets
they looked and finally found
a place to set up an impromptu
outdoor film theatre which
would also be the school for a
lesson so many of the people
of the town and countryside
needed to learn-how to
recognize, to prevent and take
care of the illness of the eyes
called trachoma. Trachoma
is one of the most widespread
diseases in China, whose
people call it"Sha Yen"
(sand eye) because the pain it
causes makes its victims feel
as if grains of sand have got
into their red-rimmed water-
ing eyes.
Putting over
health lessons
But this is only one ofChina's health problems.
Large numbers of the people
must be shown the need for
small-pox vaccination, the use
of D. D. T., the importance of
safe drinking water and the
vital roles of proper sanitation
and protective medicine in
the fight for health.
All these aims are included
in the project at Pehpei,
where film strips, posters,
pamphlets and other audio-
visual materials for funda-
mental education are prepared
and later tested during visits
to towns and vlllages In
Szechuan Province.
The visit of Dr. Nutting,
Hugh H u b b a r d and their
assistants to Shuih Tze Hsiang
was typical of many others
which have enabled them to
find out the most effective
ways of"putting over"the
health lessons, lessons which
will later be used on a growing
scale elsewhere in China, and
by educators in other parts of
the world.
A few hours after their
arrival in the town, the mem-
bers of the Pehpei Mission
were unpacking their equip-
ment. By now they had the
help of two members of the
Chinese Mass Education
Movement, Dr. Chiang and
Nurse Hsiung-field soldiers
in the war of modern science
against the old plagues of
endemic and epidemic illness
in the Chinese countryside.
Children stood around,
watching with delight as out
of the car came a generator,
a transformer, a gramophone
and equipment for filmstrip
projection. Some of the
children, and the grown-ups
who watched from further
away, didn't see as well as
they should have ; they had
trachoma.
F
Story 01 Wantl San
in a II y everything wasr ready. About 1000 towns-
people and farmers, young
and old, were in the impromptu
theatre in front of the ancient
temple whose stone step made
an excellent gallery. Hubbard.
Wang and Fen Wei-ch'uan put
on the show. First there was
Chinese music. Then ai :
educational filmstrip about
the Pehpei mission's fight
against trachoma was shown.
The film brought to many
children, women and men
with sore eyes a simple tale of
what they needed to do to be
cured and to prevent others
from suffering.
Filmstrips on trachoma
shown by the mission in the
towns and villages have very
simple scripts telling, in a
way that every villager can
grasp, of the dangers of the
disease and how these can be
avoided. One, for example,
tells the story of Wang San, a
clever carpenter, who caught
trachoma from public towels
he used to wipe his face each
time he visited a tea house.
The towels had been used
previously by people suffering
from the disease. Wang San
neglected his eyes until it was
too late to cure him, became
blind and so lost his job.
Then, because he and his wife
used the same towel, she also
caught the disease. However,
with proper treatment, as the
filmstrip illustrates, she was
cured.
As the filmstrip ends, the
commentator gives some final
advice to the audience :
"Friends, p'ease rem. ember :
Do not use public towels to
wipe your eyes. When your
eyes feel wrong do not touch
them with your hands, but go
to a doctor for treatment. Use
your own towel and ww ; h
your face with clean water in
a clean basin to protect your-
self and others from becoming
blind."
Next morning Dr Nutting,
Dr Chiang and Nurse Hsiung
set to work. The impromptu
theatre of the previous night
became a medical consulting
room. And here sitting at
three tables they reaped
the harvest of the seeds
of knowledge that the
filmstrips had sown. ash
morning, they greeted towns-
folk and farmers, examining
their eyes, giving them treat-
ment, registering their cases.
Most of those who came had
sore eyes. In the afternoon
232 children from the school
were examined. Only 26 per
cent had trachoma and three-
fourths of the cases were mild ;
but the fifteen bad ones
proved to the doctors that
there would be much blindness
in Shih Tze Hsiang unless the
Unesco team could get into the
homes and show the need for
clean habits.
While the doctors were at
work, a loud speaker set up
near them explained what was
going on, told men and women
who had not seen the film-
strips the night before why the
examinations and treatments
were important. Posters were
also put up on walls of streets
far from the old temple
square, but the strongest
appeal was the fact and the
sight of the doctors carrying
out their mission of teaching
and helping in front of the
unseeing eyes of the old
temple gods.
Dice field cinema
In the evening of theirsecond day at Shih Tze
Hsiang, the Unesco health
educators went with their
school-theatre equipment to
another primary school two
and a half miles away. This
was in the courtyard of the
home of the local representa-
tive of the Chinese Mass Edu-
cation Movement. But the
courtyard was too small for
the 550 persons who wanted to
see the filmstrips, So the
screen was set up in a recently
harvested rice field by the side
of the road.
Although there was a drizzle
of rain the next day, farmers
on their way to the Pi Shan
market stopped to have their
eyes examined at the open-air
clinic which had been as usual
set up. Of the 87 children in
the school 39 had trachoma.
Before the team from Pehpei
left Shih Tze Hsiang another
programme of filmstrips was
given and again more than
1000 persons watched, listened
and learned.
The results of visits to
test the effectiveness of the
materials produced by the
Unesco project team have
been so successful that it has
been decided to continue the
work, which should have
ended in 1949, until the middle
of 1950. When it finally ends,
a report will be published and
samples of the materials made
available to the governments
of Unesco's Member States.
"Best wishes for good health"saye this Chinese Calendar for 1950. pre-
pared by Unesco's Fundamental Education Audio-Visual Project at
Pehpei. But as good health tems from habits rather than hopes, the
Calendar illustrate some of the do's and dons which can make every
Chinese village"a healthy village".
