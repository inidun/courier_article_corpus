IS the ocean thrusts itself
into our affairs, it creates situations
that demand new political and juridical
answers. Its present and future uses
are incompatible with the old assump¬
tion that beyond the three-mile limit
it belongs to no one. For all intents
and purposes other than navigation,
the assumption is as anachronistic as
the shore batteries upon whose range
the limit was based. At least seven
nations have claimed jurisdiction over
fishing rights 200 miles off their shores.
Under the Convention on the Conti-

Unesco's Press Division. While on leave

Unesco field projects.
nental Shelf, adopted by a United
Nations conference in 1958 at Geneva,
all coastal nations now have a clear
title to the bottom resources of their
continental shelves down to a depth
of 200 metres (656 feet), a boundary
that can run as far out to sea as 250
miles, depending on the hazards of
submarine geography. It is as if a con¬
tinent larger than Africa were added
to their area.
Within it, states the Convention, they
own "the mineral and other non-living
resources of the seabed and subsoil
together with living organisms belong¬
ing to sedentary species, that is to say,
organisms which, at the harvestable
stage, either are immobile on or under
the seabed or are unable to move,
except in constant physical contact
with the seabed or the subsoil."
Certain "organisms" slip through
this legal barbed-wire entanglement.
In international disputes since the
4
adoption of the convention, marine bio¬
logists have been drafted as experts
to determine whether lobsters and king
crabs swim or crawl. If the animals
swim, then the lawyers must consider
them as fish and anyone can catch
them ; if they crawl, they belong to the
owner of the continental shelf.
Ownership of the shelf is not all
that clear, either. In 1958, the Geneva
Convention's framers expected that
twenty years would go by before any¬
thing worthwhile could be mined
beyond the depth boundary of 200
metres that they had drawn.
Oil drillers are already capable of
surpassing it; the miners of phospho¬
rite and manganese nodules are wait¬
ing in the wings. They can make
use of a purposely opened loophole
in the convention's definition of the
continental shelf as "the seabed and
subsoil of the submarine areas adja¬
cent to the coast ... to a depth of 200
metres, or beyond that limit, to
whether the depth of the superjacent
waters admits of the exploitation of
the natural resources of the said area."
In other words, exploitation of the
natural resources is nine points of the
law. Dr. Kenneth O. Emery, a geologist
from Woods Hole Océanographie Insti¬
tution, Cape Cod, U.S.A., is among
those who note that "exploitation" is
not defined in the convention.
He has asked several provocative
questions that cannot as yet be answer¬
ed: "Does the recovery of a few man¬
ganese nodules as curios constitute
exploitation? How many tons of nodu¬
les per year per unit area constitutes
exploitation? Is profit on a free and
open market required, or will large
governmental subsidies substitute for
profit? Manganese nodules with their
content of cobalt, copper and nickel
are the chief deep-sea resources that

No flags on the sea floor
generally receive mention, but does
the recovery of a few million dollars
worth of these metals per year warrant
assignment of sovereignty to huge
areas of the earth?"
There are other questions. What
is the status of the country with a
deep trench near it's coast that separ¬
ates it from what would normally be
its continental shelf? Norway was in
such a position when drilling rights
were apportioned in the North Sea, but
Great Britain allowed her to extend
her claim across the trench.
In the Pacific Ocean, the long arm
of American law reached over waters
10,000 feet deep to prosecute an in¬
genious group that had tried to put
a man-made island on Cortes Bank,
110 miles off San Diego, to reap a crop
of abalone and lobster. To start their
island, they decided to sink an old
troopship on the bank, but their plans
went awry and the ship was wrecked
in 35 feet of water. They were charg¬
ed with creating a hazard to navigation
on the continental shelf off California. '
6
T,HE convention's least
controversial provisions are already
becoming obsolescent. It declared
as a matter of course that the
legal status of the seas above the
shelf remains unaffected. Serious
doubts are now being expressed about
allowing freedom on the top of the
sea.
Dr. John P. Craven, chief scientist
of the Navy Special Projects Office in
Washington, does not see how fishing
and shipping could continue in areas
where divers are working for long
periods at a stretch:
"They are in a precarious position
with respect to man-made perils. They
cannot tolerate explosive detonation in
their near vicinity; they cannot tolerate
extensive pollution; they cannot toler¬
ate interference by trawls or dragnets."
Such prospects are plausible in the
context of a legal vacuum. There is
a growing sentiment that the vacuum
cannot be allowed to exist much longer
if we are not to repeat in the ocean
the same grievous mistakes that have
left us in our present predicament on
land.
In July 1966, President Johnson said
what many are thinking: "Under no
circumstances, we believe, must we
ever allow the prospects of rich har¬
vests and mineral wealth to create a
new form of colonial competition
among the maritime nations. We must
be careful to avoid a race to grab
and to hold the lands under the high
seas. We must ensure that the deep
seas and the ocean bottoms are, and
remain, the legacy of all human
beings."
In several quarters, the President has
been taken literally. Senator Clai¬
borne Pell, of Rhode Island (a state,
as he has said, with 156 of its 1,214
square miles under water and a shore¬
line of 384 miles) introduced into the
U.S. Senate, in September 1967, a
short resolution aimed at achieving
"a reasonable legal order for the extra¬
national world ocean."
The resolution speaks of an "urgent
need" for an international agreement
to keep the deep-sea floor and its
resources free for use by all nations.
The agreement would also ban the
stationing on the ocean bottom of
"unproven types of nuclear or other
kinds of mass destruction weapons."
Pell asked that the U.S. State De¬
partment take steps leading to an
ocean space treaty that would allay
any fear that the United States and
the Soviet Union "might attempt to
carve up the oceans of the world into
co-dominions much as the Spanish and
Portuguese sought to do with the
New World in their agreement at Tor-
desillas, signed on June 7, 1494."
Just about this time, Malta, a state
even smaller than Rhode Island, drop¬
ped a similar idea into the United
Nations General Assembly. In August
1967, Malta requested that the Assem¬
bly's agenda be modified to include an
item on "the reservation exclusively
for peaceful purposes of the seabed
and of the ocean floor, underlying the
seas beyond the limits of present

THE UNDERWATER LANDSCAPE
OF OUR PLANET
Beneath the enveloping mantle of the
oceans lies most of the geography of
our planet, a landscape as seamed and
rugged as any on earth. Until recently,
man knew even less about the
submerged 70 per cent of the earth's
surface than he knew about the near side
of the moon. Today with the aid of new
electronic instruments man has mapped
the ups and downs of much of the sea
bottom. One striking result is this map
of the Atlantic Ocean floor (detail of a
larger map) reproduced here by special
permission of the National Geographic
Society, Washington (U.S.A.).
Map shows how the Continental Shelf,
a vast underwater platform,
juts out from the coasts of North America,
Greenland, Iceland, Europe and Africa.
Deep gorges and canyons, crevasses and
valleys mark the greatest depths. Winding
down the middle of the ocean from
Iceland towards the equator is the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an immense oceanic
"spinal cord", criss-crossed by deep
fractures and flanked by chains of high
mountain ranges. Key to figures shown:
-12,000, depth in feet below sea level;
(14,000), height above the 16,000-foot
average depth in the abyssal plains;
9,000, height in feet above sea level
on islands and continents.

270.000,000,000 tons of heavy water
national jurisdiction, and the use of
their resources in the interests of
mankind."
In an accompanying memorandum,
Malta suggested that the "net financial
benefits" that would come from use of
the sea floor should be used "primari¬
ly to promote the development of poor
countries." An international agency
could be created to assume jurisdic¬
tion over the ocean floor as a trustee
for all countries.
One of the main proponents of
such a solution has been Dr. Francis
T. Christy, Jr., of Reseach for the
Future, Inc. in Washington, a non¬
profit corporation financed by the Ford
Foundation. Christy discounts the
feasibility of simply extending each
country's continental shelf as it is
exploited.
Under such a "national lake" ap¬
proach, the French and the British
could lay claim to vast areas of the
Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans
because of their island holdings (the
Geneva Convention gives islands the
same rights as the mainland). The
Soviet Union, with its comparatively
small coastline, would be short-chang¬
ed and, Christy remarks, no ocean
regime can be set up without its
agreement.
The second possibility he mentions
is that of the "flag nation". Any¬
one could operate on the ocean floor
under the protection of his own country
but competition and conflict would in¬
evitably call for supra-national rules
anyway. Christy concludes that the
answer is an international authority
that could collect royalties from the
the seabed miners in the deep ocean,
and in return guarantee their exclu¬
sive rights to a deposit.

HE U.N. General Assem¬
bly started to discuss Malta's idea in
November 1967. Dr. Arvid Pardo, the
Maltese delegate, provided more
details about the international agency
that his government had in mind. The
ocean floor, he believed, could not
very well become the responsibility of
the U.N. in its present form: "It is
hardly likely that those countries that
have already developed a technical
capability to exploit the ocean floor
would agree to an international regime
if it were administered by a body
where small countries, such as mine,
had the same voting power as the
United States or the Soviet Union."
Pardo suggested a new agency that
could finance itself by income from
rental of the ocean floor. If the agency
were created in 1970, its gross income
could reach $6,000 million a year by
1975, a sum that could be transfused
into the underdeveloped world. Two
months later, the General Assembly
adopted its resolution setting up a
committee of thirty-five countries to
study the item in view of future action.
Malta's suggestion kicked up a cur¬
ious storm in the United States.
Strong reactions were heard in the
halls of Congress against the idea of
turning the sea floor over to the
United Nations (which Pardo specifi¬
cally said he did not have in mind).
Florida seems to have led the attack.
One of the state's congressmen,
Representative Paul G. Rogers, propos¬
ed an eastward ho! alternative. He
urged that the United States should
occupy the sea floor out to the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge by 1980. "The sea bot¬
toms off the United States present an
opportunity to expand our national
borders in the same manner we did
as we crossed the West in the early
days."
In October 1967, Florida's governor,
Claude Kirk, went down in the under¬
water research vessel Aluminaut and
planted the flags of his state and
the United States on the bottom, eight
miles off Miami, at a depth of 1,000
feet. When he came up, he explain¬
ed to the press: "I didn't make a fan¬
fare about this thing because we would
have had eighteen senators and the
federal government protesting. Well,
it's too late now. You should dismiss
the question of boundaries when talk¬
ing about the ocean bottom. It is only
a question of possession. That's the
way the Spaniards did it. They just
said 'it's mine' and took it. The United
States should do the same."
Eighty-six members of Parliament for
all British parties do not see things-
his way. In May 1968, they tabled a
motion in the House of Commons that
asked, as Pell had done in the U.S.
Senate and Malta in the U.N. General
Assembly, for a treaty to conserve the
sea floor as "the common heritage
of mankind."
Elsewhere, it has been hinted that
the strongest backers of the Malta
plan were large companies with a
stake in the sea. Their support was
attributed to their business sense, not
to a sudden infatuation with the U.N.
Yvonne Rebeyrol, who covers ocean¬
ography for Le Monde in Paris, wrote:
"They [industrial firms] are the most
eager of all to see a settlement of the
legal problems raised by the exploit¬
ation of the resources of the ocean
bottom. In fact, they cannot start
to invest heavily on the bottom until
they are certain they will not be evict¬
ed by someone else who, for example,
could claim prior discovery or rights
under a national law."
The debate among parliamentarians,
economists, jurists and diplomats
shows that the land world is becoming
aware of the built-in internationality of
the ocean. The oceanographers are
involved in dozens of international
organizations, the oldest being the
International Council for the Explora¬
tion of the Sea that dates back to
1901, when it was founded in Copen¬
hagen by countries of north-western
Europe.
Dr. Arthur Maxwell, associate direc¬
tor of Woods Hole, has gone so far
as to say that "the oceanographers
have arrived at a position where they
are actively considering a public order
of the sea quite independently from
the efforts taking place in internation¬
al law circles."
Maxwell, who is equally at ease at
sea or in a U.N. working group, traces
the first major co-operative effort in
oceanography back to the International
Geophysical Year, which ran through
1957 and 1958. It was based on en¬
lightened self-interest: "While the mo¬
tivation of the organizers of this effort
was co-operation on a world-wide
basis, its acceptance among the océan¬
ographie community was at least in
part an economic necessity. Support
for oceanography had been fluctuating
widely and this international pro¬
gramme provided a salvation."
The scientists then convinced their
foreign ministries to support an Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Commis¬
sion, which came into being under
Unesco's wing in 1960, with the late
Anton Bruun, a Danish deep-sea bio¬
logist, as its first chairman.
0.PNE of the Commission's
earliest moves was to turn all its
members' guns against a propos¬
ed international research vessel. The
oceanographers knew what they were
doing. Instead of one ship performing
international research, they have since
had dozens their own. The Com¬
mission offers them a way to combine
their resources, represented by land
laboratories as well as by ships.
Such resources are not the mono¬
poly of a single country. The United
States, it is generally agreed, spends
more than anyone else on the ocean.
Its federal marine science and techno¬
logy budget has been growing lust¬
ily: $333 million in the 1966 fiscal
year; $409 million in 1967; $447 mil¬
lion in 1968.
The proposal for fiscal year 1969
was $516 million, an increase of 15 per
cent, but still only 3 per cent of the
$17,000 million that the federal govern¬
ment devotes to research and develop¬
ment. In 1967, the United States had
125 océanographie ships.
In a report to the U.N., the U.S.S.R.
has stated that its annual expenditures
on oceanography run to $20 million
and that it operates 1 1 0 vessels. Com¬
parisons are difficult to establish and

are always being made. In the United
States, there is a tendency to speak
in public about "catching up with
the Russians" whenever funds are
being sought. American oceano¬
graphers who visited the U.S.S.R. have
told me that their Soviet colleagues
tend to use the same argument for
the same purpose.
There is certainly a similarity in
attitudes about the sea. The follow¬
ing quotation must sound familiar to
Western readers: "More than 40 chem¬
ical elements have been discovered
in sea water. There are more than
10 billion tons of gold, four billion
tons of uranium and 270 billion
tons of heavy water [the author uses
"billion" in the U.S. sense, 1,000
millions] to say nothing of the fact that
MINING SEAFLOOR URANIUM
Century after century, water washing
off the land has deposited in the oceans
every" mineral known to man.
Scientists are now devising
new ways to "mine" the ocean's uranium
which totals four billion tons.
Drawings below explain the functioning
of a huge "uranium trap" to be set up on
the coast of North Wales.
Nodules of titanium hydroxide, a "mag¬
net" for uranium, are placed on the
beach at low tide.
The rising tide covers the nodules. A
barrage is placed across the bay to trap
the seawater.
Two days later the barrage is removed.
Nodules, on which uranium has combined
with the titanium hydroxide, are recov¬
ered at low tide.
the sea contains 97 per cent of our
planet's wealth in water. The ocean
is a storehouse holding all the minerals
of the globe. If they were gathered
and spread evenly over the earth's
surface, they would form a layer more
than 200 metres thick."
It is from an article entitled "Seven
Seas," by A. Grinevitch, in Yuni Tech¬
nik (Young Technician), a popular Sov¬
iet science magazine aimed at young
readers. The issue also contains
articles on the polar seas, whaling,
ships of the year 2000 and a piece
by Jacques Cousteau, who starts by
telling Yuni Technik's audience: "Mys¬
tery is a challenge I cannot resist."
There is a difference between the
usual Western presentation of the
subject and the Russian approach:
Grinevitch talks of six seas (those of
the physicists, the biologist, the geolo¬
gist, etc.), and adds a "poet's sea." A
Soviet captain describes an area in the
Mediterranean: "A handful of amber
beads is scattered over the blue
Aegean. Garlands of yellow pebbles
fill the waters between the Greek and
Turkish shores; their many rows cross
the sea, and along the southernmost
strand of the necklace of islands, there
hangs the mysterious amulet of
Crete."
To learn more about Soviet oceano¬
graphy, I called on an old acquaintance,
Dr. Konstantin N. Fedorov, a physical
oceanographer from Leningrad who
worked for the Institute of Oceano-
logy of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences. He now doubles in brass
as head of Unesco's oceanography
office and secretary of the Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission
(and manages to do valid scientific
work during his weekends). No inter¬
preter was needed: Fedorov's English
is as fluent as his Russian, and his
French is not far behind.
He thought that American and Soviet
océanographie efforts are now run¬
ning parallel, though at their very origin
they stemmed from different sources:
the practical needs of the seaman and
the fisherman in the United States,
and basic scientific curiosity in the
U.S.S.R. "During the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, attempts were
often made to study the ocean as part
of Russia's major geographic explora¬
tory efforts. The great Russian scien¬
tist-explorers were always assured the
active support of the Academy of
Sciences. Ever since its creation by
Peter the Great, the academy has
never been a passive club of academi¬
cians."
A major stimulus to Soviet oceano¬
graphy was the early exploration of
the Arctic. "Little is known outside
Russia of the dramatic history of the
Arctic seas. They were our only free
route to the Pacific: to Japan, to the
Aleutians, and to Alaska, our source
of furs and gold. Beginning in the
seventeenth century, Russian explorers
went east along the Arctic coast in
summer. This economic drive was
the basis of our present efforts in
Arctic meteorology and oceanography.
On the northern route, the U.S.S.R.
runs one of the few existing océano¬
graphie services in the world. It serves
shipping bound from Archangel and
Murmansk to Vladivostok."
Fedorov himself came into oceano¬
graphy through meteorology. In 1947,
he graduated from a technical col¬
lege in his native Leningrad with the
diploma of meteorological observer.
"Our diplomas are narrowly specializ¬
ed, true, but they are based on a
very broad education. The technical
college also offered a course in de¬
scriptive and physical oceanography.
It interested me, and I chose it for my
higher education and more advanced
work for my Ph.D."
His first expedition took him to the
Baltic and the Barents Seas. Later, he
worked in the Black Sea and the
Pacific, and in 1959, he was chief
scientist aboard the Akademik Vavilov
when she made the first Soviet re¬
search expedition to the Mediterra¬
nean. Following that trip, he went
to England to study at Liverpool Uni¬
versity and the Imperial College of
Science and Technology in London on
a Unesco fellowship.
F.EDOROV has also sailed
on an American ship, Woods Hole's
Atlantis II, during the International
Indian Ocean Expedition in 1965.
This cruise his idea of a vacation
from his office in Paris gave him
an opportunity to work with Henry
Stommel, an American oceanographer,
on the study of differences in temper¬
ature and salinity over depth ranges
of only a few feet the new field of
micro-oceanography.
He knew of Stommel from his writ¬
ings. "His works were among the first
scientific books that I studied in
English. Practically every research
oceanographer in the Soviet Union
reads English. Later, I met Stommel
at a meeting of our Commission's
scientific advisory group in Moscow.
He is one of those scientists I only
know a few like Lev Zenkevich, the
father of marine biology in the Soviet
Union, or Roger Revelle, or Vsevolod
Zenkovich, the coastal geomorpho-
logist, or Walter Munk who have
both stature and unlimited human
qualities." Stommel and Fedorov pub¬
lished a joint paper on their research.
Fedorov saw no difference between
Atlantis II and Soviet vessels in the
organization of work at sea and the
spirit in which it was carried out. "On
both American and Soviet ships, many
crewmen participate voluntarily in
scientific observations: bird-watching
or surface fish-catching. When one
of our ships is on station at night,
sailors lower a lamp into the water
and catch fish. It's a sport, of m
course, but they don't eat the fish M
They give them to the scientists for **
their collections. I think that, like
Atlantis II, we get the type of sailor

NEW WORLD OF THE OCEANS (Continued trom page 9)
According to legend, Alexander the Great, in the 3rd century B.C., was lowered
into the sea in a glass barrel "to see what was there and to defy the whale"
(from a 15th century manuscript, below). Leonardo da Vinci designed submarines
and diving gear and is said to have made a descent in a diving bell. Above, a
17th century one-man diving bell, ballasted by a large lead ball. Water penetrated
the bell to the point where it equalized the air pressure.
Mobile houseboat for
who doesn't go to sea just for the
money."
I asked Fedorov a question that
keeps popping up: why are Soviet
research ships so big. The largest is
the veteran Ob, displacing 12,000 tons,
and several newer vessels run to
6,000 tons, three times the size of
Atlantis II. "There are several
reasons. The boundaries of the
U.S.S.R. are such that our ships
cannot keep returning to Soviet ports.
It is not profitable for them to pay for
supplies in foreign ports. Fuel, for
example, is much cheaper at home.
So voyages must be long. A large
ship offers more comfort for the
scientific team and much more of a
cultural life for both the scientists and
the crew."
Fedorov confirmed what I heard
from American visitors to the Soviet
Union who were struck by a solid
emphasis on details in océanographie
work. "We're very pedantic in
scientific work. When we make
observations, we bring along not only
great scientists but a host of inter¬
mediate characters. They take a
student by the ear and they give him
a smack if he is careless. This is an
absolute must, from the point of view
of methodology. You must enforce
standards of observation when you
deal with a changing environment
otherwise, your measurements will
change more than the environment."
Marine science in the U.S.S.R., he
explained, has three main bases: the
Academy of Sciences, responsible for
basic research in the world ocean;
the Ail-Union Institute of Fisheries and
Oceanography; and the Hydrometeor-
ological Service, which provides
forecasts for fisheries and shipping.

deep-sea divers
They are co-ordinated by a State
Committee of Science and Technology
under the Soviet Council of Ministers.
Fedorov, who never neglects a
chance to score a point in the long
and usually friendly debate that we
have had over the years, reminded
me that the U.S.S.R. brought the
ocean into national affairs as early as
1921, when Lenin issued a decree
establishing a "Floating Marine
Science Institute" at Murmansk aboard
a research vessel, the Perseus.
Behind the Soviet Union and the
United States, money spent on
oceanography falls off sharply, but
there is no corresponding dip in qual¬
ity. Discovery in Great Britain,
Meteor in the Federal Republic of
Germany, Jean Charcot in France are
every bit the equal of American and
Soviet ships, and laboratories are at
the 'same level. Unlike space a rich
man's game oceanography can be
played by the moderately well-off.
T«OTAL British expenditure
on oceanography is less than $8 mil¬
lion a year, funded through a
Natural Environment Research Coun¬
cil, which also finances activities in
conservation, marine biology and
Antarctic exploration.
The National Institute of Oceano¬
graphy at Wormley in Surrey must get
along on an annual budget of
$1,800,000 that includes operation of
the 2,800-ton Discovery. Frills are
few and far between at the institute's
laboratory, where offices are spartan
and secretaries a collector's item.
There is no scrimping on the ship:
she is fitted out as a small liner, on
the theory that scientists get more
work done when they live well.
British oceanographers whom I met
shuddered, when they recalled the
steel decks of American vessels and
the ordeal of going to breakfast
without a cup of morning tea served in
one's cabin by a cheery steward.
Discovery's size and comfort are
considered an economy: she can work
throughout the North Atlantic winter,
and nothing costs more than a ship
in port.
The Federal Republic of Germany is
on pretty much the same tack as the
British. The Ministry of Scientific
Research pays the bills for the new
$4-million Meteor, a magnificent
2,740-ton ship equipped with a dozen
laboratories to work in all branches
of oceanography. The German Re¬
search Society enabled her to carry
out a notable cruise that studied
both the geology and the inhabitants
of seamounts in the North-East
Atlantic, particularly the Great Meteor
Seamount, a peak rising from a depth
of 15,000 feet up to 900 feet and

by the French cartoonist, Pierre Jacquot.
discovered by the first Meteor in 1938.
The cruise was led by another
marine internationalist, Professor Gün¬
ter Dietrich, head of the Institute of
Oceanography at Kiel University.
Dietrich was elected president of the
International Association for the
Physical Sciences of the Ocean in
1967 and he stuffs the Meteor with
foreign scientists (on the seamount
cruise, he had sixteen aboard from
France, Great Britain, Norway, Por¬
tugal and Spain).
He once told a writer for Science:
"When we were at the zero point of
our existence in 1945, there was one
commander who came as supervisor
for oceanography from the British
navy to our country. He did not come
as a conqueror who drove the oceano¬
graphers in all directions ... He gave
them chances to work in Hamburg and
Kiel ... If oceanography revived in the
Federal Republic of Germany, it was
by his help. This was Dr. J.N.C.
Carruthers of the National Institute
of Oceanography."
A French government survey has
counted 500 Frenchmen working in
oceanography at no fewer than
100 laboratories. The statistic sums
up the brilliant individualism that
characterizes the French. While their
country devotes but $26 million a year
to all forms of marine science, they
are present everywhere: whether in
diving and underwater living, deep-sea
tide measurements, biological studies
in the deepest ocean with the bathy-
scaph Archimède, or the use of
manned floating islands.
A National Centre for the Exploita¬
tion of the Ocean has been set up
by the French government to har¬
monize these commendable, if some¬
what disjointed, efforts. The centre
operates the Jean Charcot, a new
2,200-ton ship, and is establishing a
large océanographie laboratory at
Brest. As priorities, it has chosen
the development of marine protein
concentrates for food, aquaculture, the
mapping of the continental shelf, deep-
diving techniques, the prevention and
cure of pollution, and air-sea inter¬
action research.
It has contracted with Cousteau's
Centre for Advanced Marine Studies
at Marseilles for a new diving saucer
that will-take a pilot and two scientists

NEW WORLD OF THE OCEANS (Continued)

down to 10,000 feet. Also under
construction in co-operation with the
French Petroleum Institute is a 230-ton
submarine that is really a mobile
houseboat for divers, rendering them
independent of a surface ship and
attendant risks of bad weather.
A new floating island will replace
the first version that has been in the
water since 1963 as a house sitting
on top of 210 feet of pipe, with 160
feet below the waterline (it cannot be
flipped; once it is down, it stays
vertical even when it is towed). It
has spent most of its working life
anchored between Nice and Corsica,
staying for as long as two years at a
stretch.
Its main user has been the labora¬
tory of Professor Henri Lacombe, who
started the first modern course in
physical oceanography in France in
1948. Members of Lacombe's staff,
based at the Paris Museum of Natural
History, take turns living on the buoy
to. run an ocean data station. They
try to correlate what happens in the
sea with the atmospheric records kept
by meteorologists less than a hundred
miles away.
"That is the advantage of working
on air-sea interaction in the Mediter¬
ranean," Lacombe said. "It is caged
by a network of land stations." To
study these processes on a smaller
scale, he is also creating a sample
ocean 130 feet long, 10 feet wide and
3 feet deep, to be used with a wind
tunnel. Professor Alexandre Favre,
director of the Institut de Mécanique
Statistique de la Turbulence at Mar¬
seilles, is in charge of this work.
Lacombe considers the whole Medi¬
terranean as a miniature ocean where
processes can' be studied with greater
ease and accessibility. He and
Dr. Paul Tchernia, his assistant
director, put the finishing touches to
the solution of the ancient riddle of
why the Mediterranean doesn't over¬
flow despite the current that rushes
into the Straits of Gibraltar from the
Atlantic.
The presence of an opposing under¬
current in the straits had long been
known (and put to use during World
War II by Italian submarines that rode
it silently out into the Atlantic past
British listening posts), but the
Mediterranean's water budget was
still uncertain. Using measurements
obtained by ships of five nationalities,
in a one-month survey of the straits,
Lacombe and Tchernia concluded that
about 31,600 cubic kilometres of
water enter the Mediterranean from
the Atlantic every year and only
30,000 slip out below. The missing
five per cent represents evaporation
by Mediterranean sunshine.
Despite the sun, Lacombe also finds
the Mediterranean an ideal place to
study the formation of deep water
under "polar" conditions normally
found only off the Greenland ice cap
and Antarctica. During a cold Euro¬
pean winter, the Mediterranean off the
Riviera behaves ' almost like the
Labrador Sea: surface water chilled
by cold winds grows denser as it
cools, then sinks to mix with under¬
lying water and thus contributes to
the formation of bottom water. What
happens to it after that is of impor¬
tance not only to physical oceano¬
graphers but to researchers in marine
pollution who wish to know the fate
of dangerous wastes buried in the
deep.
Movements of bottom water are
influenced by "sills" in the seabed,
another feature that the Mediterranean
offers in abundance for convenient
examination. Lacombe told me of a
study of the process of deep water
formation in the north-west Mediter¬
ranean that he hopes to carry out
with the participation of American,
British and French vessels. Very
detailed observations are to be made
with new techniques to follow "mini-
features" of temperature or salinity
characteristics and to try to get at
the underlying processes.
Lacombe served as chairman of
the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission from 1965 to 1967. He
manages to remain active in teaching
and research, yet finds time for inter¬
national affairs. It is something of an
act of faith. He once wrote: "Will
man be able to see the ocean's unity
as an image of the need for a unity
of efforts, a sharing by nations of
their capacity for discovery so they
can first explore and then exploit an
area that is intrinsically almost entirely
international and open to all open
to hopes but also to ambitions?"
A.i S chairman of the Com¬
mission, Lacombe was busy with
legal matters. The status of buoys
drifting or anchored in mid-ocean
is a subject for discussion; so
is freedom of research itself, which
was set back, many feel, by the
convention on the continental shelf.
Under the convention, the country
owning the shelf must give permission
for research there, and scientists are
complaining that it can take longer to
get a permit than to do the work.
Lacombe sees two distinct view¬
points here: "The Americans and the
British prefer to look at an issue case
by case before trying to frame rules;
the Soviets, and to some extent, the
French and the Latin countries, want
to study all aspects at once and move
immediately to a convention."
The Commission has sixty member
countries, but no budget of its own,
no building and no bureaucracy.
Administrative housekeeping arrange¬
ments are provided by Unesco at a
cost of $50,000 to $80,000 a year, as
compared to the $10 million to $20 mil¬
lion a year that the Commission's
members have devoted to international
co-operative expeditions.
The most recent -of these expedi¬
tions is a study of the Kuroshio (its
name means "black water" in
Japanese), the western Pacific's equi¬
valent of the Gulf Stream. It has
been carried out by eight countries
and thirty-six vessels, with Japan
making the greatest contribution. In
1963 and 1964, an international co¬
operative investigation of the tropical
Atlantic was conducted by the same
number of nations using thirteen ships.
The Commission's largest single
effort has been the International Indian
Ocean Expedition from 1959 to 1965
that launched an armada of forty
research vessels under fourteen flags,
with nine more countries participating
in shore operations.
On the oceanographers' charts, the
Indian Ocean was one of the last
great blanks; even data from commerc¬
ial shipping had dwindled since the
opening of the Suez Canal.
It was also the site of the kind of
natural experiment that every physical
oceanographer dreams of performing.
To see the effect of the wind on the
circulation of the sea, he would dearly
love to switch it on and off. In the
Indian Ocean, he has the seasonal
reversal of the winds with the
monsoons. Geologists wanted to
learn if their ridge system continued
into the Indian Ocean; biologists were
interested in the actual productivity of
an ocean that accounts for 25 per cent
of the area of the sea but only 5 per
cent of its fish catch.
No single nation could mount such
an undertaking. The major océano¬
graphie powers sent ships, but so did
Australia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Portugal, South Africa and Thailand.
The expedition was started' by the
Scientific Committee on Oceanic
Research (SCOR) of the International
Council of Scientific Unions, an organ¬
ization that groups scientists in their
professional capacities, not as dele¬
gates of governments.
Later on, the expedition was co-
sponsored by SCOR and Unesco, while
the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission, took over its co-ordina¬
tion. Its implications for weather and
fisheries became the respective con¬
cerns of two U.N. agencies: the World
Meteorological Organization, and the
Food and Agriculture Organization.
Tangible results were produced by
the free-roaming ships. The great
wind experiment was a success. Dur¬
ing the south-west summer monsoon,
Soviet, British and American ships

investigated the Somali Current along
the coasts of Arabia and Africa. It
races north at speeds up to seven
knots almost twice as fast as the
Gulf Stream.
The Somali Current turns sharply
away from the Arabian coast. To
replace it, cold water 55 degrees F.,
the coldest surface water anyone has
ever found so close to the equator
rises and brings up nutrients. It is
roughly the same upwelling situation
that feeds the anchovies off Peru.
It would be comforting to write that
a scientific expedition has found fish
for the protein-hungry populations on
the shores of the Arabian Sea. It
would be misleading: the 150,000 tons
of fish that are now being taken off
the Arabian coast go into the holds of
modern Japanese and Soviet trawlers.
Antiquated local dhows are unable to
work this new offshore fishery.
In the short run, therefore, the
expedition has failed to achieve one
of its stated purposes: to bring food
out of the ocean for Asia. In the long
run, the prospects may not be as
gloomy. The expedition has given a
salutary jolt to marine science in the
region, mainly in India, which now
has a National Institute of Oceano¬
graphy of its own at New Delhi.
0.MHER results of the expe¬
dition are being charted. Scripps
Institution has brought out an atlas
of the fishery oceanography of
the Arabian Sea; Soviet scientists are
responsible for a biological atlas of the
entire Indian Ocean; Americans at the
University of Hawaii are compiling
physical and meteorological atlases.
Another heritage of the expedition
is an International Meteorological Cen¬
tre at Bombay that is getting an insight
into the vagaries of the monsoon, upon
which Indian agriculture depends. The
end of the expedition has seen the
start of permanent research in the
Indian Ocean.
Scientific co-operation on the high
seas is now focusing on areas that
can be covered more intensively. The
latest studies conducted by the Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Commis¬
sion are aimed at the Caribbean and
the Mediterranean, two seas that have
already been explored but now need
to be understood.
What is heartening about both
studies is that they give smaller
countries a chance to join in oceano¬
graphy. The investigation of the
Caribbean was proposed by the
Netherlands; research in the Mediter¬
ranean is bringing together countries
of North Africa and the Near East
under arrangements that permit them
to carry out scientific investigations in
the same waters.
Photo above shows an undersea geologist gathering samples from
the seabed as clues to locating fossil-bearing oil beds. One day
man may mine the sea floor for cobalt, copper and nickel, using huge
vacuum cleaners to suck the minerals up into surface ships, or
submarine earth movers to scrape them into submarine mine hoists.
