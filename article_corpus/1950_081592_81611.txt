A new technique in educational film. similar to that used in French and Italian art film was used in"Local
Government", which teaches schoolchildren about the history 01 local government in England, taking the
city of Norwich as a typical example. It was made from a series of stills, meticulously drawn in period
style like the one above, showing Norwich in the 15th century, with the camera providing the movement.
3pecially composed musical accompaniment creates the right atmosphere for each period.

understand and r e-
member them more
easily when teachers can
supplement explanations with
visual impressions of the sub-
ject being taught. Only a
few years ago, however,
teachers were obliged to
improvise nearly all their own
visual aids. Many adults can
certainly still remember their
teachers using an orange, an
apple and a lighted candle to
give a crude, but effective
demonstration of the rela-
tionship between the earth, the
sun and the moon.
Today, with films, wall
charts, filmstrips, models and
special maps supplementing or
replacing teacher-made devi-
ces, one of the countries
giving a valuable lead, espe-
cially in the field of films, is
Great Britain, where the
development of such visual aids
has been going on for many
years.
The belief in the value of
films as educational aids began
to grow in Britain about 1920.
Since then, the interest and
activity shown by teachers
associations, education insti-
tutes and Local Education
Authorities has encouraged
film makers to produce mate-
rial suitable for the school
curriculum.
Further development is being
made possible today through
the National Committee for
Visual Aids in Education.
formed to plan and develop a
visual aid policy for England
and Wales, and the Educa-
tional Foundation for Visual
Aids (E. F. V. A.) whose work
includes the provision of infor-
mation and facilities for edu-
cational authorities and
teachers and help, in an advi-
sory capacity, to sponsors and
producers of new educational
films.
Industrr Helps Education
EDUCATIONAL film librarieshave been set up by such
bodies as the British
Electrical Development Asso-
ciation, the Petroleum Film
Bureau, the British Iron and
Steel Federation, the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat and
the Tea Bureau. The first of
these groups, for instance, has
produced over 15 films dealing
with the basic theories and
principle of electricity.
These ten minute films explain
in simple language the why
and wherefore of electricity
and its different applications
in the home and in the
factory. They are loaned
to teachers together with
detailed notes and question-
naires which help them to
make the fullest use of the
films as visual aids.
In all, 1, 000 prints of 15
films are in constant circulation
throughout the country today,
and in the case of"Generation
of Electricity"and"Trans-
mission of Electricity", 120
prints of each film have been
made to meet the needs of
schools and technical colleges.
An important contribution
to the teaching of science and
engineering has been made by
the iron and steel industry.
Films and filmstrips cover the
obtaining of raw materials and
the production of iron and
steel. Area training officers in
the steel industry use them for
training apprentices, but they
are also available to schools
and technical colleges.
Wool has always played a
large part in British national
life. Accordingly, the industry
has for years helped develop
the use of visual aids for the
teaching of economics, geo-
graphy, chemistry, biology and
domestic science. Similarly,
the tea industry has done a
great deal to instruct teachers
in the use of visual aids and to
provide schools with material
which will enliven lessons on
geography, history, transport
and social customs. In addi-
tion to films, exhibitions are
organised ; cardboard models
with sheets of cut-out figures
made for children to assemble
in the course of a lesson.
English In Six Weeks
EVERY kind of visual nidwas mobilized by the
National Coal Board in
1947 to meet a thorny pro-
blem-the teaching of thou-
sands of foreigners from over
twelve different language
groups, enough English in six
weeks to follow their training
course in mining. Although
the lessons were based on the
"direct"method-the teacher
speaking sentences for the
pupils to repeat-filmstrips
played an important part and
were found to be useful
because they forced the
trainees to focus their atten-
tion on one picture at a time
as it was projected on the
screen. Films were found
useful for revision and for
dramatisation of normal
straightforward conversation
Ordinary documentaries were
used, but the sound track was
replaced by a commentary
which kept strictly to the lan-
guage level reached by each
particular group.
Among recently produced
films dealing with language
teaching was"La Famille
Martin"which enables the
pupil to see French characters
talking naturally, and acting
naturally as they do in
everyday life. The tempo of
the film is deliberately normal
and not slowed up for fear of
creating an artificial and
erroneous impression.
Such films enable children
cribing"Map Projection",
"Latitude and Longitude"and
"Day and Night". The last
named, produced in colour, is
exceptionally clever in its use
of revolving models and inge-
nious lighting.
Geographical films, pro-
duced from an unbiased point
of view, have done much to
create a better understanding
of other peoples'problems.
Every recent British produc-
tion of geographical films and
filmstrips has tried to do more
than teach the children the
bare facts. An attempt has
been made to show people in
other lands as real people,
with families and homes.
Hence, there is little generali-
sation. A filmstrip on Persian
oil-fields, will take a specific
Persian worker and tell the
story of his daily life against
a background of the oil-fields
and will thus create an under-
standing of his problems.

Children no longer find it. difficult to understand the meaning of liners
drawn on a map or the world when it is explained to them as clearly
as in the film"Latitude and Longitude" (above).

used to make every detail visible and intelligible, make even the most

An outstanding achievement
among films on physiology
was"Digestion", because of its
clear exposition of the entire
digestive system, and for its
painstaking degree of accuracy.
Every muscle contraction is
shown in animation. Colour is
used to make every detail visi-
ble and intelligible. It is a
fascinating production which
makes the subject seem amaz-
ingly easy to understand.
Other Peoples'Problems
IT is perhaps in the geo-JL gra hy lesson that the film
and filmstrip come into
their own. And here remark-
able results have been
achieved. For example, child-
ren have always found it
difficult to visualise the world
and to understand the meaning
of the lines drawn on the
revolving globe. A series of
films has been produced des-
Another pointer to a growing
awareness of the international
value of education is found in
the efIorti'made to obtain fo-
reign films for teaching in
English schools. British pro-
ducers and British teachers are
looking across the seas for
available material.
The day is fast approaching
when such exchanges will be
facilitated by the removal of
customs barriers through two
international agreements
sponsored by Unesco. The
first agreement would relieve
educational films from licences,
quotas and tariffs and the
second (described on page 9 of
this issue of the Courier)
would also free the movement
of films as well as other edu-
cational materials.
Such exchanges are expected
to give an added incentive to
commercial firms and indus-
trialists willing to undertake
the production of films for
schools, by providing a wider
market for their productions.
