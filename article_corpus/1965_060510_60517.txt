ONE WINNER
TWO VICTORIES
IIT is not often that a
sportsman is awarded a
trophy when he loses a contest. But
on May 20, 1965, Eugenio Monti, the
Italian bobsleigh champion was pre¬
sented by Mr. René Maheu, Director-
General of Unesco, with the first Inter¬
national Fair Play Trophy, not for
winning a race, but because he lost it.
Monti's defeat was more significant
than a victory; it was an outstanding
example of the spirit of fair play which
is the finest lesson that sport can
teach.
During the 1964 Olympic Winter
Games at Innsbruck (Austria), Monti
made his last bobsleigh run at a speed
that most people thought would bring
him victory. Then he learned that the
British bobsleigh team, Tony Nash and
Robin Dixon, were in trouble because
of a broken part on their sleigh.
Without hesitation Monti removed the
part from his sleigh and gave it to the
British team. They repaired their own
sleigh, made a record run . . . and won
the Olympic gold medal.
Presenting the trophy to Eugenio
Monti, Mr. Maheu stressed the rela¬
tionship between the spirit of sports¬
manship and the values that Unesco
seeks to promote.
Fair play, he said, is above all a
spirit of loyalty. This quality may well
come from an inborn trait but also
needs to be developed, and that is the
role of education. Fair play also implies
a concern for equal opportunities, and
Eugenio Mojiti displayed that concern

by correcting an accidental inequality
so that others could compete on a
equal footing, that is to say objectively.
And what else is objectivity but the
scientific attitude of mind?, asked
Mr. Maheu. Lastly, fair play exalts
the intrinsic worth of an unselfish act
which is the hallmark of true culture.
The award was made to Eugenio
Monti by the "Pierre de Coubertin"
International Organizing Committee for
Fair Play Trophies (Pierre de Coubertin
was the founder of the modern Olympic
Games). This committee is composed
of representatives of Unesco, of the
International Sporting Press Associa¬
tion, of the International Council of
Physical Education and Sport and lead¬
ing international sports federations.
On being presented with his trophy,
Eugenio Monti said he believed that
the International Fair Play Trophy
would become "the world's most covet¬
ed award."
