SPAIN. To care for its rich heritage
of artistic and cultural treasures, Spain
has recently set up a central Ins¬
titute of Restoration equipped to
apply the latest techniques of the
modern "art clinic". Technical advice
on the creation of the institute and
the training of its staff was given by
a Unesco mission in 1963. The ins¬
titute will give priority conservation
to the Romanesque sculptures of the
monastery of Ripoll (photo) in
northern Spain and to 14th century
murals in the Cathedral of Toledo.
MOROCCO. Rich in ancient cities
dominated by graceful minarets :
Fez, Meknes, Marrakesh each a
monument in itself, whose balance
and character would be destroyed,
as a Unesco mission warned in
1962, if modern multi-storied build¬
ings were added to them. The
mission studied the setting up of
museums and libraries for the
conservation of ancient documents
and recommended special preser¬
vation treatment for mosaics in

PAKISTAN. Three major mis¬
sions (1956, 61, 64) have asses¬
sed problems of Mohenjo Daro
the great capital of the Indus
River Valley civilization of 4,000
years ago. Immense ruins cover¬
ing some 250 acres are being
eroded by invading salt-impreg¬
nated waters from Indus River
and irrigation canals. Methods
of protecting ruins and of pump¬
ing away salty water now
being studied. Pakistan Govern¬
ment requested Unesco mis¬
sion to advise on measures for
saving site. Investigation and
report by the most recent
mission considered by special¬
ists as a model of its kind.
