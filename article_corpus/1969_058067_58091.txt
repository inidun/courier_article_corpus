In Russia, the Ukraine and
Byelorussia, for centuries
wood was the only available
material for making objects
of everyday life. These
objects range from
monumental sculptural
works to simple household
articles in which the hand
of the craftsman has
integrated beauty with
utility. This head, which
strikingly recalls one of the
giant statues dotting the
slopes of Easter Island in
the Pacific, is the decorative
top of a bottle stopper
fashioned by a village wood
carver in early 19th century
Russia.

UTENSILS
AS WORKS
OF ART
by Veniamin Fabritsky and Igor Shmelyov
VENIAMIN FABRITSKY and IGOR SHMELYOV are Soviet architects
whose designs have gained numerous prizes and awards. In the study
of the ancient art of wood carving they found an absorbing hobby to
which they have devoted many years of research and travel in the
most distant parts of the U.S.S.R. They have described their search
for masterpieces of folk craftsmanship in "Sagas in Wood", a book
published in Russian in the Soviet Union last year.
IN Russia, a land of dense
and boundless forests, wood has
always been the most accessible and
widely used material. And in the hands
of the Russian craftsman, the axe, a
rudimentary tool, becomes endowed
with magical qualities.
In times when saws and nails were
still largely unknown, craftsmen used
the axe to make household objects
embellished with elegant carving and
to hew and shape the solid timber-
work of log cabins as well as palaces
and churches. The skill of the archi¬
tects ¡n integrating these structures Into
the surrounding landscape still amazes
us today.
The art of wood carving goes back
many centuries to the time of the
Eastern Slavs who settled on the banks
of great rivers such as the Dnieper,
the Volga and the Don and around
Lake Urnen in the first millennium A.D.
These peoples deified the primitive
forces of nature. They worshipped
mighty rivers, great mountains and

UTENSILS AS WORKS OF ART (Continued)
The master carvings of the 'Volga Boatmen'
rocks, towering trees, and made
wooden idols with human features. The
walls of their temples were adorned
with wooden figures of human beings,
birds and animals so realistically
portrayed that they seemed to be alive.
Slav pagan religion and mythology
continued to Influence Russian art
down through the centuries. Wooden
vessels of today still resemble the
duck-shaped cups unearthed from an¬
cient sites in the Urals; the traditional
Russian log hut, the izba, is basically
unchanged after hundreds of years;
and the sun, represented as a circle
with a fan-shaped pattern of rays,
remains a widely used motif ¡n wood
carving. Such carvings of the pagan
sun god were once carried as protec¬
tive emblems at the mast-heads of
ships.
Christianity was adopted in Russia
at the end of the 10th century and
brought with it new ¡mages and emo¬
tional qualities to enrich Russian art,
which drew inspiration from the highest
forms of Byzantine culture and assim¬
ilated the artistic heritage of classical
antiquity.
The new works were shorn of all
but essential elements. Background
details were shown as clearly as those
in the foreground. Sculptural works
were characterized by their terseness,
clear cut rhythm and stylized form, and
the central figure was made dispropor¬
tionately large to emphasize its pre¬
eminence and moral status.
These characteristics are seen in the
surviving examples of two types of
13th century monumental wood carv¬
ing: the framework of the iconostasis
and the so-called Ludogoshcha cross.
The 13th century iconostasis (a
screen separating the sanctuary from
the rest of the church) is divided into
rectangles in which reliefs are sculpt¬
ed. The whole composition is austere
and rhythmical; the carved forms
concise, stylized and extraordinarily
impressive.
The Ludogoshcha cross has a most
unusual shape resembling that of a
branchy tree. Bas-reliefs in circular
frames are placed at different levels
on its surface which is covered with

intricate carved patterns that unite the
different ¡mages into an expressive
ensemble.
Both the 13th century iconostasis
carving and the Ludogoshcha cross
are representative of the art of one
of the oldest Russian cities, Great
Novgorod, whose works are distin¬
guished for their strong, clear line and
their monumental yet austere form
and expression.
The people of Novgorod were often
called "the master carpenters", such
was their fame as craftsmen ¡n wood.
All Russia admired their wooden
churches, carved poles, sleighs, boats,
beautiful handmade objects carved in
boxwood and Caucasian walnut, and
the giant oak pipes that served as
water mains. At the end of the 10th
century, the craftsmen of Novgorod
built St. Sophia, a huge wooden cathe¬
dral with 13 belfries.
In the 13th century the Tatar invas¬
ion placed the Russian people under
a yoke they were to endure for 150
years.
In wood carvings of that time saints
are often depicted as inspiring figures;
the most popular were the fiery
Archangel Michael, sword ¡n hand,
and St. George, a courageous, hand¬
some youth in armour and on horse¬
back. Grey-haired St. Nicholas per¬
sonified man at his best wise, kind
and charitable to others.
In 1380, the Russians routed the
Tatars at Kulikovo and drove them
out of Russia. The country rose from
its ruins to begin a new life.
Some 30 years later, Andrei Rub-
lyov, the greatest icon painter of
ancient Russia, created a work that
marked the beginning of a new epoch
in Russian art: the famous "Trinity".
Crystal clear, harmonious and lyrical,
it was a masterpiece that revealed the
very quintessence of human feelings.
Symbols and forms Intended to express
the immutability of religious dogmas

emotional work of art, the complexity
and diversity of life.

Artists and craftsmen of
all periods have used
their art to express the
ideas of their time and
to depict events that
changed the course of
history. In the 15th and
16th centuries, Russia
was striving to weld its
far-flung territories into
a single state. In 1551,
an unknown wood
sculptor decorated the
ceremonial seat of Ivan
the Terrible, in the
Cathedral of the
Assumption, in Moscow,
with scenes depicting a
multitude of events in
Russia's history. Detail,

An outstanding centre of the wood
carver's art in ancient Russia was
Novgorod, from the 9th to the
12th century a dependency of Kiev
and for the next three centuries a
medieval republic Sovereign Great
Novgorod. By the 13th century
its famous craftsmen had developed a
characteristic form of sculptural
wood carving, an austere yet
expressive style that is still evident
in the crosspiece of a crucifix shown
below, carved at Novgorod in the
mid-1 7th century.

compositions of Western Europe, the
frescos and sculptures of India, the
classical landscape paintings of Chi¬
na, the miniatures of the Near and
Middle East, indeed, with all the art
of the Middle Ages.
Within the bounds of medieval
thought and knowledge, wood sculp¬
tors and carvers used their art to
express with tremendous force the
ideals of their time, as well as to
observe and comment on events that
changed the course of history.
The ceremonial seat of Ivan the
Terrible in the Cathedral of the As¬
sumption, in the Kremlin, is an out¬
standing example of 16th century wood
carving, and at the same time its com¬
positions are a record of historical
events compiled at a time when the
vital task facing the country was to
unite all its territories into a single
centralized state. These reliefs are
images from the pages of Russian his¬
tory, depicting among other episodes,
the reception of ambassadors, the con¬
ference between Prince Vladimir Mono-
makh of Kiev and the Boyars, and
Russian cavalry on the move.
Traditions and techniques of sculp¬
ture in wood were passed on from
generation to generation. Northern
Russia became famous for its unique
wood carving which, with Its simple
patterns composed of slanting and
zig-zag lines, triangles, diamonds, ro¬
settes and indentations, perpetuated
the traditions of the art of Great Nov¬
gorod. Architecture in wood, too, was
developed to a remarkable degree ¡n
the north where the Church of the
Transfiguration in Klzhl surmounted by
22 domes still stands as a masterpiece
of design and construction.
Another outstanding centre of the
wood craftsman's art was the Volga
region where the famous "ship carv¬
ing" originated. Initially found only
on the boats which plied the Volga
River, it spread far and wide to adorn
gates, porches, poles and window
mouldings. From its original austere,
geometrical patterns, it evolved into
imaginative, embroidery-like designs
creeping plants, leaves and flowers,
fantastic birds, friendly-looking lions
with splendid manes and flowers in
their tails, mermaids, and herons with
a bunch of grapes in their beak. All
these inspired poems in wood were
executed with superb craftsmanship.
The skill of the carvers, their ability
to conjure the maximum effect from
their material and above all their love
of beauty are clearly evident in the
forms of utensils and other household
objects indispensable to a farming
community.
With their perceptive understanding
of wood and its plastic qualities, these
craftsmen excelled in using to the best
advantage its natural grain and pattern,
and in utilizing roots and knots to
fashion decorative motifs.
Every household article, however
insignificant, was given a distinctive
beauty: distaffs hand painted in bright
colours, heavy benches with carved
backs, boards for making richly
decorated honey cakes and others for
printing colour patterns on fabrics,
finely carved jugs, cups and salt cellars
shaped like boats, ducks or swans.
In this way, even the simplest every¬
day activities fulfilled the purpose of
the craftsman: the integration of beauty
with utility.
