OUT IN THE COLD
in many Third World countries
only the better off can afford
"low cost" housing intended
for the needy
by
Joseph Bain D'Souza
JOSEPH BAIN D'SOUZA, Chairman and
Managing Director of India's Housing and
Urban Development Corporation, is a noted
authority on low-cost housing programmes
and community action in new towns. Since
joining the Indian Administrative service
in 1947, he has been Municipal Commis¬
sioner (city manager) for Bombay and
. Managing Director of the City and industrial
Development Corporation of Maharashtra,
responsible for planning and building the
2-mllllon-populatlon city of New Bombay
outside Greater Bombay.
FACED with mounting prob¬
lems of slums and shanty
towns, many Third World govern¬
ments have launched crash pro¬
grammes to build subsidized low-
cost housing for the poor. In India,
for example, public housing pro¬
grammes cost $550 million in the
five years up to 1974. Yet in India,
as In most nations of the develop¬
ing world, most of the subsidized
low-cost houses are now being
bought by the better-off sections
of the communityand the poor
are being left out in the cold.
World Bank figures for five ci¬
ties Madras, Ahmedabad, Nairobi,
Mexico City and Bogota show
that the cheapest public housing
now being built is too expensive
for all but the richest 30 per cent
to 50 per cent of the urban
population.
These figures are based on the
assumption that people can afford
to spend 15 per cent of their in¬
come on housing. It is a generous
assumption. The poorest people in
most developing countries prob¬
ably spend three-quarters of their
income on food alone. The rest has
to pay for fuel, clothing, education,
medical care and household neces¬
sities, leaving only about 6 per cent
to 10 per cent for housing.
On this more realistic basis, an
even smaller percentage of a de¬
veloping nation's people can afford
to buy the subsidized "low-cost"
housing. For the city of Ahmeda¬
bad, for example, it means that the
subsidized housing programme Is
catering only for the richest 15 per
cent of the people. A recent survey
of several housing projects in nor¬
thern India confirms that out of
every ten houses being built for the
poor, between seven and nine are
actually being bought by the bet¬
ter-off.
Yet most public housing agen¬
cies have the genuine aim of build¬
ing houses for the very poor.
What is going wrong?
A scene in my own office, just
the other day, provides an illustra¬
tion of what is going wrong. The
Chief Administrator of one of In¬
dia's largest cities looked at a
chart on my wall which showed
just how little a family living on less
than $36 a month could afford to
spend on housing. "But who can
possibly earn less than $36 a month
nowadays?" he asked, "Hardly
anyone in our urban areas, surely."
The fact of the matter is that less
than fifteen out of every hundred
families In India's towns and cities
have more than $36 a month to live
on. That means only 55,000 fami¬
lies in this particular Chief Ad¬
ministrator's city of 350,000 fami¬
lies. And of the remaining 295,000
families, almost half have less than
$18 a month coming in.
The Administrator's question re¬
veals what is wrongthe gulf bet-

ween the poor and those who plan
for them. The planners, architects,
engineers and administrators be¬
long almost exclusively to the
middle and upper classes. They
seldom know just how numerous
and how poor the poor really are.
In consequence, they base their
plans on their idea of a house and
their idea of what proportion of the
people can spend what proportion
of their income on housing. They
often assume, for example, that the
poor can afford to spend one quar¬
ter or even one third of their In¬
come on buying a home.
But In practice a family living on
$36 a month can barely afford
$3.60 a month for shelter. Even
with a 20 year hire-purchase
scheme, and even with a subsi¬
dized Interest rate of 5 per cent,
this means that the maximum cost
of a home which the majority of
the population can afford is about
$550.
Faced with this reality, most
planners and architects throw up
their hands in helplessness and
say that you cannot build a decent
house fit for human beings to live
In for about $550. The bricks and
the cement and the steel are too
expensive; the house has to stand
for a hundred years; it has to pro-
ylde privacy for all its occupants;
it has to meet standards and bye-
laws laid down for the benefit and
protection of Its occupants, xj
In practice these norms and
standards, drawn up to protect the
people's welfare, are actually op¬
erating against the welfare of the
poorest majority by preventing the
building of the kind of homes
which they can afford. So houses
which conform to these middle-
class standards of what a house
should be, continue to be built and
continue to be bought by the
better-off people who alone can
afford them. What can be done?
Again, a recent episode in India
provides a clue to what can be
done. In 1975 disastrous floods
destroyed 2,000 poor people's hou¬
ses in just one State. Three months
later, before any of the housing
agencies had really moved, most
of the flood victims had fashioned
new homes for themselves out of
whatever materials they could find
or buy.
One of the flood victims, Raj
Kumar and his family, built a mud
and thatch house for themselves
without the help of architects or
engineers. Raj Kumar told me that
the materials and the carpentry
had cost him $55.
Today, another three months
later, the public housing authorities
22

are starting to build well-appointed
up-to-standard houses for $800 to
help those who, unlike Raj Kumar,
could not afford the $55 for the
material to build their own homes.
Who will finally buy those houses?
Left entirely alone and without
help, the poor in the slums and
shanty towns of the developing
world fend for themselves with
remarkable success. Only by build¬
ing on this self-help can the
"urban-blight" of millions of squa¬
lid slum-dwellings be solved.
With the major part of their
populations concentrated at the
lower extreme of the Income scale,
It Is idle for developing countries
to carry on the pretence of provi¬
ding them all with "decent dwel¬
lings", as defined by planners, at;
prices which they can afford. There
Is no realistic alternative to the
legitimizing of the shanty towns.
As some planners are now rea¬
lizing, the way forward lies in envi¬
ronmental Improvement for the
shanty-towns the provision of ac¬
cessible clean water; hygienic sani¬
tation and surface drainage; gar¬
bage clearance arrangements, and
other basic community amenities.
The settlers and squatters them¬
selves will do the rest If they are
assured that their tenure Is secure
and if they are given the encoura¬
gement and help they deserve.
Selling them small plots of land
and perhaps the basic skeletons of
houses which they themselves will
complete, Is the way to help cre¬
ate thousands upon thousands of
"new" homes on a government
subsidy of only $360 or $550 In¬
stead of ten times as much. In
many cases, no subsidy at all will
be needed. Incentive is all.
Initially, the settlers will complete
their houses with whatever mate¬
rial they can lay their hands on.
If it Is their house, created by them
In their own way, they will even¬
tually Improve it as their own cir¬
cumstances improve.
They will not look as tidy and
photogenic and prestigious as the
smart new estates envisaged by
most of today's planners. Yet, as
Habitat, the U.N. Conference on
Human Settlements in Vancouver,
is helping to make known, the only
way of drastically Improving the
living conditions for millions in the
slums of the Third World Is to build
on the self-help and ingenuity of
the slum-dwellers themselves.
And It will call for a drastic revi¬
sion not only of present norms
and building codes but of "our"
notion of what a "house" really is.
