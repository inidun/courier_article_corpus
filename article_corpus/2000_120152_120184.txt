HIS TORIC LIMA 
GETS A NEW HE A RT
◗ Luis Jaime Cisneros
Although not a metropolis every urban planner would dream of, Lima no longer has the
dubious title of one of Latin America’s dirtiest and most polluted cities

Nobody who strolled through the centre
of Lima in the 1980s could have imag-
ined that some day the Pe ruvian capital
would be called a “garden city”. Air and noise
p o l l u t i o n , lack of public services (public toi-
l e t s , proper lighting), t r a f fic chaos,va n d a l i s m
and the invasion of the city centre by thou-
sands of street ve n d o rs drove out not only
t o u rists and pri vate businesses but local res-
idents who only ventured there to go to wo r k .
In June 1989, a group of urban planners ,
architects,historians,artists and art critics
decided to set up the Lima Foundation, a
p ri vat e ,n o n - p o l i t i c a l ,n o n - p r o fit organiza-
tion to save the old city centre. “ We all had
jobs in the historic centre and could see
h ow it was really going dow n h i l l ,” s ays jour-
nalist Augusto Elmore.
The Fo u n d at i o n ’s first victory was get-
ting the city centre onto UNESCO’s World
H e ritage List in 1991.This enthused public
opinion and spurred the city authorities to
embark on a far-reaching renovation pro-
gramme in the mid-1990s with the Foun-
d at i o n ’s help and support . “ H i s t o ric city
centres are places where culture, tourism
and economics can rub shoulders , and their
r e s t o r ation must benefit all social classes and
foster a spirit of unity,” s ays urban sociolo-
gist Gladys Chavez.
Those in charge of the programme took
this to heart and reckoned that revamping
the centre would have a beneficial effect
on the rest of the city, which is home to eight
million people (a quarter of the country’s
p o p u l at i o n ) . They focused on renovat i n g
116 blocks cove ring 123 hectares and
including 570 monuments—baroque
c h u r c h e s , Renaissance mansions, u n i ve r-
sities and conve n t s , all of them examples of
Spanish urban colonial architecture.
The programme borrowed ideas from
earlier plans to restore Hava n a , M e x i c o
City and Quito—all of whose historic cen-
tres are World Heritage sites—and was a
joint effort by local authori t i e s , civil society
and the pri vate sector. “The Fo u n d at i o n
drafted renovation projects and passed them
on to gove rnment bodies—the city author-
i t i e s , the National Cultural Institute and
the urban investment fund—for exe c u t i o n ,”
s ays Juan Günther, the 63-year-old architect
in charge of the Foundation’s projects.
Traffic control
One of the first measures taken was to
reorganise street trading. “ To get to the
Plaza José de San Martin square, in the
c e n t r e , p e d e s t rians and motorists had to
we ave their way through thousands of ve n-
dors,who either had stalls or laid out their
wares and their knick-knacks on the pave-
ment and in the road,” s ays Elmore.To d ay,
you can get through the streets more easily,
because only officially licensed street ven-
dors are allowed into the centre and many
of the others have been moved into shop-
ping galleries outside the old city centre.
Another pri o rity was tackling air and
noise pollution. “ A nyone who works in the

centre suffers from it eve ry day,” s ays Gün-
ther. “It gives me a sore throat and a lot of
my colleagues get skin rashes.” So the traffic
system in the centre was changed to limit
the number of buses and taxis, which are
now regulated and painted yellow.
Restoration of the main public spaces,
such as the Plaza Mayor, began in 1997,
along with the renovation of churches, m o n-
uments and San Marcos Unive rs i t y,
founded in 1551 and the oldest in Latin
A m e ri c a . “But it was more than just restora-
tion.These places got used for new pur-
poses,” says Chavez. He cites the example
of the Lima Biennial A rt Fe s t i va l , w h i c h
holds exhibitions in large ari s t o c r atic man-
s i o n s , as well as schemes to encourage local
t o u rism such as the “ R e t u rn to the Centre”
campaign and the renovation of the Chinese
quarter.
Much of the work was carried out with
technical and financial assistance from
UN E S C O and foreign gove rn m e n t s , such as
Spain, or with the help of Cuba. But the
Fo u n d ation also lobbied the pri vate sector,
and va rious banks and big firm s , such as the
S o u t h e rn mining company, the Backus and
Johnson brewery, Telefonica de Peru and
Coca Cola, all of which gave money for the
r e n ovation wo r k . An “Adopt a Balcony ”
campaign to restore 300 colonial balconies
in the centre (at a cost of about $5,000
each) was funded by private firms.
Suggestions for
fighting poverty
In the past few ye a rs , Lima residents
of all classes, especially young people, h ave
begun to return to the centre. “We enjoy
coming here now because it’s like being in
a city within a city,” say Jimena and Kike,
two students crossing the Plaza Mayor.
Günther says the impression of neglect
and alienation people used to feel when
t h e y walked through the city centre is a
t h i n g of the past, but he fears the changes
might not stick. Air and noise pollution
h ave not gone away. “ A b a n c ay Ave n u e ,o n e
o f the main thoroughfa r e s , is a nightmare,w i t h
four times the maximum level of pollution
s e t by the World Health Organizat i o n ,” h e
s ay s.
But the big problem, he continues, i s
“social pollution” caused by petty crime in the
central area and the spread of poor housing,
along with insanitary conditions and high
i n fant mort a l i t y.The challenge for the next
few ye a rs will be to draw this sector of the
p o p u l ation back into society and into jobs.
Old mansions classified as histori c a l
monuments are occupied by between five
and sometimes a dozen families who pay
little or no rent. But the centre is not very
densely populated because of the large
number of official buildings,churches and
public spaces. The Fo u n d ation has sug-
gested conve rting disused buildings into
a p a rtments and knocking down those in
ve ry bad condition to replace them with
about 90,000 new apartments.
M oving more people into the old part of
the city and improving living conditions
there will also improve the quality of busi-
nesses and make the centre more at t r a c t i ve
for Lima’s citizens and for tourists. “The
first and most urgent task for Lima,” says
G ü n t h e r , “is the economic, c o m m e r c i a l
and cultural revival of the old city.” ■
The “Adopt a Balcony” campaign funded by private firms has led to the restoration of 300 colonial balconies in Lima’s historic centre.
