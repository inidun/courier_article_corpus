In the black townships around Jo h a n n e s bu r g,
South A f ri c a , a new music culture is taking hold
among youth. In the small clubs and storefront
shebeens of these impoverished dormitory towns,
young people are eschewing the gove rn m e n t - s a n c-
tioned “ a u t h e n t i c ” music of Afro-jazz bands in
favour of recorded sound. Just as Jamaican sound
system operat o rs back in the 1950s or South Bronx
hip-hop DJs in the mid-1970s discove r e d , t wo
t u rn t a b l e s , a mixer and a microphone (made in
Ja p a n ) ,a supply of vinyl records (pressed in Europe
or the U.S.) and a competent DJ are all that is
required to get the party rockin’until dawn.
Local eruptions of globalised “club culture”
f ru s t r ate simplistic notions of authenticity (should-
n ’t A f ricans listen to A f rican music?) or attempts to
wrest a defin i t i ve meaning from youth culture
(linked so often to music).The township kids have
punctured and deflated the ove r - s i m p l i fied analysis
often surrounding Afro-diasporic music. In many
c a s e s , p aths are traced from A f rican ori gi n — t h e
m u s i c ’s “authentic roots”— through to its re-art i c-
u l ation (“whitening”) or commodific ation (“sell
out”) by greedy corporations based in the modern
We s t e rn metropolis. T h at argument falls apart in
places like the tow n s h i p s , where youth adopt music
with A f r o - d i a s p o ric roots (house music was born in
the black-latino urban gay clubs of the U.S.) bu t
routed through the cities of northern Europe. For
these young people, it represents a highly va l u e d
link to the West—much as their heavily logoed jeans
and baseball caps function as status symbols. But is
their rejection of Afro-jazz for Euro-house a subtle
form of reverse appropriation (whereby kids have
adopted the music as their own) or merely bad fa i t h
(a rejection of their culture)? Music scenes like
these are far too sophisticated to fit into the
cramped confines of binary (either/or) analysis.
Instead of delive ring easy answe rs , these music
scenes raise critical questions: is globalisation a sign of
the wo r l d ’s unific ation or cultural imperialism? Is this
e m b ryonic youth culture just another example of
o n e - way globalisat i o n — v i nyl singles being export e d
from the First World to the Third along with Coca-



Mapping 
the meanings of
dance m u s i c

By adapting global music tre n d s, a re young people
dancing on the graves of their cultures 
or building new hybrid identities?

C o l a , designer jeans and other markers of conspicuous
c o n s u m p t i o n , in the endless cycle of seduction and
e x p l o i t ation? Or is this the story of creat i ve adapta-
t i o n — youth as cultural bri c o l e u r ,mixing and mat c h i n g
symbols of prestige to create their ow n ,a u t o n o m o u s
subculture? Township DJs play house records at
around 90 beats per minute (bpm), far slower than the
130 bpm pace preferred by the European audience.
The reduced speed turns the  propulsive , h e c t i c
“ b a n gi n g ” into a glutinous and out-of-focus funk-
d u b , more in keeping with the drinking culture of
South A f rica than the drug-induced speed of European
s c e n e s. With a flick of a pitch control, black youth re-
signify and re-claim a Europeanised form of “ b l a c k ”
( A f r o - A m e rican) music.
Replacing rock
Are these young South A f ricans building new
hy b rid identities or dancing at the funeral of their
own cultural traditions? As Jeff Chang notes in his
assessment of hip-hop (see p. 2 3 ) , it is never clear
whether youth music cultures “ r e flect a hy b rid yo u t h
rebellion or capitulation to global capitalism.”
Therein lies the gr e at promise, as well as the
central dilemma, for academic analyses of youth-
music cultures, particularly “dance” or electronic
music (house music and its derivatives),which has
arguably replaced rock as the most globally signif-
icant popular form.Whether it is Detroit techno in
Birmingham, trance in Goa (see p.51) or funk in
Rio de Janeiro, there is no single theory to explain
the meaning of dance music scenes.We simply can-
not resolve the youth rebellion/commercial co-opta-
tion couplet once and for all.

C a ribbean social theorist Stuart Hall reminds us
(taking as a gi ven the unequal distri bution of we a l t h
in a world “ s t ructured in dominance”) that the
basic principle of popular culture is contradiction,
and that there can be no guarantee that the “ m e a n-
i n g s ” encoded into cultural products (TV ads or
records) will be those “decoded” by the audience.
Nothing can be taken for granted in the terrain of
popular culture, especially that associated with
socially marginal groups.
The “ m e a n i n g ” of scenes organised around
exactly the same music can be markedly different in
different circumstances.The politics of buying yo u r
way into the “ d a n c e floor community” at one of the
globally branded and meticulously policed “ s u p e r-
clubs” is significantly different than that of illegal
r aves in Nort h e rn Ireland or Sarajevo where
“dancefloor communitarianism” takes on a more
c o nvincing tone in the light of fierce religious or
ethnic antagonisms that may be ove r c o m e , h ow-
ever briefly, on the dancefloor.
The rebellious genre of today can become
t o m o rr ow ’s mainstream music and the day after
t o m o rr ow ’s darling of nostalgia (see the strange
r e v i val of old rock ’n’r o l l ) . Counter-culture can
become over-the-counter culture.
Did I say “can become…”? I meant “ w i l l
b e c o m e ” . For this is one of the only reliable fea-
tures of popular music: it will change. A c c o r d i n g
to some technologically minded theori s t s ,d i gi t a l l y
produced dance music is like an alien virus with a
life of its own,continually splitting and reforming,
spreading and folding back on itself. S h o rt - l i ve d
sub-genres are constantly spreading: n e u r o - f u n k ,
acid jazz, t e c h - s t e p, happy hardcore, t ri p - h o p,
“nosebleed”and the list goes on
As electronic music spreads—through tradi-
tional circulation loops like import record netwo r k s ,
via radio airwave s , and through the Intern e t — i t
fuses with other musical forms and local styles like
fla m e n c o, dancehall reggae and Middle Eastern
p o p. It revitalizes itself through this profane contact,
and new genres emerge which feedback to the cen-
tres of production.The twin forces of youthful dis-
respect for ort h o d oxy and the ever-present threat of
c o - o p t ation by the content-hungry global enter-
tainment complex virtually guarantees change.
The politics 
of the dancefloor
But is this global mixing and matching evidence
of the increased hy b ri d i s ation of aesthetic form s ,o r
of the cannibalistic appetites of First World capital?
Are genres like Asian dance music—pioneered in
B ritain by Asian Dub Fo u n d ation (see p. 4 7 ) — s i g n s
t h at the West is finally coming to terms with its post-
colonial responsibilites, or another déjà vu phase of
S a i d ’s Orientalism (fetishism for the exotic)?
The challenge for the analyst is to disentangle
these processes. To ensure that this incredible
amount of creat i ve (and frequently under-
r e warded) cultural labour is gi ven its due, w h i l e
simultaneously ensuring that “ c e l e b r at i o n s ” o f
youthful creativity and hedonism are not merely
laying the groundwork and supplying the justifica-
tion for the dealers and profiteers—whether they
are peddling Ectsasy drug tablets, clothing brands
or fizzy dri n k s. C o rp o r ate capital needs no more
cheerleaders.
Dance music continues to grow and mutate,to
focus anxieties associated with youth—namely dru g
use and hedonism—to acquire associations with
local politics, to offer opportunities for fun, work,
c r e ativity and corp o r ate exploitat i o n .Like any cul-
tural form , dance music is always related to a socio-
political context. It may embody global aspirat i o n s
but it always has a local manifestat i o n : d a n c i n g
takes place somewhere, with particular kinds of
people present, in a particular socio-histori c a l
m o m e n t . The music has no meaning outside of
these concrete, but difficult to discern , r e l at i o n s ;
and even then its meanings are never complete or
resolved.As Yale professor Paul Gilroy reminds us,
“ c o m m u n i c at i ve gestures”, like dance, “are not
e x p r e s s i ve of an essence that exists outside the acts
that perform them.”
Academics, journalists and others interested
in what youth are up to have the task of tracking
these dancing bodies and mapping these “social
movements”. As in all cultural production, the
dialectic between resistance and exploitat i o n
plays out across its surfaces, refusing to resolve
itself into a transcendent either/or, always in the
process of becoming. ■
