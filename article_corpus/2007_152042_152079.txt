GHASSAN TUENI: THOSE WHO 
ATTACK JOURNALISTS MUST KNOW THEY 
WILL HAVE TO PAY

Ghassan Tuéni
Son of the founder of An Nahar, 
the independent daily created 
in 1933, he took over from his 
father as director. In 1949, his 
column brought him his first jail 
term. His son Gebrane Tueni, 
who in turn had become the 
newspaper’s director, was assas-
sinated in 2005 in a car bomb 
attack. One of his best-known 
editorial writers, Samir Kassir, 
was also murdered. Cofounder 
of the first Arab university for law, 
economics and political science 
and a former ambassador,  
Ghassan Tueni has replaced 
his son in Parliament as Beirut 
deputy with the Future party. 
Interview by Bassam Mansour. 
You and your family have paid 
heavily for your commitment to 
freedom of the press. Is it worth 
so much sacrifice? 
When it comes to freedom of 
the press, and freedom, there’s 
no room for calculation - they are 
priceless. You can’t put a price on 
freedom; it’s the very essence of 
free people. It’s impossible to judge 
whether information, as such, “risks 
costing too much”… to me, expres-
sions like this circulating in the me-
dia seem alien to the cause of free-
dom. A journalist doesn’t count up 
the “price” of freedom before serv-
ing it, because the end goal isn’t 
his or her own freedom. Journalists 
devote their work to a general free-
dom, human rights, the homeland, 
and so on. Any calculation within 
that commitment desecrates our 
profession. 
Since the civil war, Lebanese 
journalists have been exposed 
to attacks and the danger has 
reoccurred in recent years. 
What can be done to protect 
the press and its work? 
Unfortunately the only guarantee 
is a law-based state ensuring that 
security prevails. Journalists have 
only their pens; using the same 
methods as their opponents to 
defend themselves would mean 
betraying their principles, so they 

are particularly at risk. That said, 
I hope the international tribunal 
will investigate the assassinations 
of Samir Kassir, Gebrane Tueni 
and Georges Haoui. It can help 
prevent such attacks, no matter 
who is guilty. We must also stress 
the political condemnation of the 
culprits, and the tribute paid to 
martyrs. The killers and those who 
hire them must know that they will 
pay a higher price if they continue 
to carry out their crimes than if 
they refrain.
Do recent security threats 
greatly limit the work of the 
press and its approach to sen-
sitive issues? 
I don’t think so. Opinions ex-
pressed remain just as lively and 
distinct, even if the verbal violence 
has abated somewhat. We are per-
haps getting closer to political chit-
chat. 
In other Arab countries, the 
work of a journalist is still far 
from being independent. How 
do you see the future for the 
profession in the region? 
It’s hard to generalize. The press 
in Lebanon, for instance, is differ-
ent from the one subsisting under 
a totalitarian regime, where it “be-
longs” to the state. In that situation, 
you don’t have to worry about your 
freedom, because you no longer 
have any! 
An abundance of new media 
is being launched in the Arab 
world, notably satellite 
 television channels. Do you

2005 by a car bomb assassination.

think this phenomenon can 
promote freedom of expression 
and the press? 
This profusion certainly expands the 
space for freedom of expression. Yet 
we could call it a “collapse into free-
dom”. I have misgivings about televi-
sion programming. I prefer not to men-
tion the names of channels, but the 
superficiality, even on the most sensi-
tive issues, the endless running time, 
the repetition of a lot of programming, 
these cause profound boredom. Pro-
fusion unfortunately also means filling 
up air time with gratuitous and medio-
cre productions and imported series. 
More seriously, some shows are de-
liberately provocative, instead of open-
ing the door for rational exchange and 
making a positive contribution to soci-
ety by bolstering mutual understand-
ing and promoting the search for truth. 
In that way the danger is that they con-
tribute to solidifying or even amplifying 
problems. In this “abundance”, the 
news is the most likely victim of this 
collapse, because it’s presented 
like entertainment sandwiched 
between two fruitless analyses.
