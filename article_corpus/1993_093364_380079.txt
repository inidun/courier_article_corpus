PAPER was invented in rela¬
tively recent times. Mediter¬
ranean civilizations used
papyrus reeds for more than
4,000 years. In his Natural
History, the Roman writer
Pliny the Elder described the pre¬
paration of the reed as follows:
"The 


paper is prepared by using a
needle to split the papyrus into
strips that are very thin but also as
wide as possible. The strips are
spread on a sloping table, dam¬
pened with Nile water, and then
crossed with other strips to form
a latticework pattern. These are

pressed 


to make a sheet which is
dried in the Sun." The last
recorded use ofpapyrus in Europe
was in 1057. It was replaced by
parchment made of animal skin,
which was expensive.
The first sheets of paper, a felt¬
like material made of matted cel¬
lulose fibres, were produced in
Canton, China, in 123 BC, when
Tsai Lun, the Minister of
Agriculture, recommended the
use ofmulberry bark and bamboo
to produce a pliable, polished
sheet. In 751, Chinese prisoners
captured in Samarkand by the
Arabs described these techniques
to their captors. In 794, paper
mills were set up in Baghdad, and
later in Damascus. Subsequently
others were established in
Alexandria, Tripoli, Tunis, Fez,
Valencia in Spain, Palermo in
Sicily, and Genoa, Siena and
Fabriano in Italy. Arab paper was
made of rags (mostly linen)
ground between two millstones.
For centuries, in Europe, "rag
was the indispensable raw mate¬
rial used in paper manufactur¬
ing," writes the historian Georges
Detersannes. "Its relative abun¬
dance, together writh that ofwater,
would be the key factor in decid¬
ing whether or not the art of
paper-making would be estab¬
lished in a particular region."
Throughout the eighteenth cen¬
tury, traders collected and sorted
rags, with white ones fetching
twice the price of black ones. Up
to that time, paper-makers also
spread out the sheets in meadows
to bleach them. From the second
half of the eighteenth century
onwards, chlorine was used as a
bleaching agent, later being mixed
with limewater. This chlorine
solution came into general use
and has been used ever since.
During the same period, rags were
replaced by wood.
Well-tended forests
"The paper industry is good for
the development and sound
management of forests," claims
Francis Cailliez, a specialist in
forestry research. All those who
think that making paper means
destroying trees will probably find
this a rather surprising statement.
"A magnificent forest is one that is
managed and carefully tended,"
says Cailliez. Trees need to be
felled when they have reached
maturity, so as to give the young
trees around them the opportu¬
nity to thrive. Thinning out dense
stands of forest provides timber
for joinery and construction work.
The upper part of trees and the
branches go for firewood or pulp,
uses for which diseased, small or
misshapen pieces of wood are
also very suitable. "The two main
threats to forests are natural disas¬
ters such as big fires, followed by
shifting agriculture and grazing.
Timber felUng comes a long way
behind," notes Cailliez, who has
spent twentyyears studying trop¬
ical forests. Forests are not threat¬
ened by the paper industry as
such, but by haphazard felling.
The world has three main forest
zones: in Amazonia, southeast
Asia, and central Africa. Examples
ofbadly controlled deforestation
are to be found in the first two
regions. The central African basin
has 500 million hectares of forest
in Cameroon, Gabon, Zaire, the
Central African Republic, and

monitors the sparsely populated, since a high
pulping process. rate of population growth is a
threat to the forest, not only
because people cut down trees
for firewood and clear the land
for farming, but also because of
overgrazing by the animals they
raise to survive. It is not surpris¬
ing, therefore, that the forest
should regenerate in a region that
has been abandoned by human
populations. This has happened
in the once-overpopulated coastal
savanna of Gabon, a region from
which human activity has now
virtually disappeared.
Forests in countries specializ¬
ing in the production of paper
pulp, such as Canada and the
Scandinavian countries, are very
well managed. The largest artifi¬
cial forest in Europe, the pine
forest that covers more than one
million hectares in the Landes
department in southwestern
France, suppUes wood to three
paper mills in the area. In an
endeavour to increase producti¬
vity, scientists are working on the
development of a type of pine
with optimum qualities, such as
straight and rapid growth without
too many branches, and resis¬
tance to drought, frost, disease.
insects and fungus. Some promi¬
sing results have been achieved. It
used to take sixty-five years to
grow a good tree. Soon it will take
no more than forty years. Between
1962 

and 1987, the Landes forest
almost doubled its output from
an annual 4.7 cubic metres 

to 9
cubic metres per hectare.
One sheet ofpaper can be
recycled 7 times
"In plantation forestry," notes
Francis CaiUiez, "the conflict that
sometimes arises between the
defenders of local species and the
advocates of imported species
seems to have subsided. The pre¬
vailing opinion is that an unpre¬
cedented effort should be made
to establish more plantations, so as
to relieve the pressure on natural
formations, to store carbon, to
meet human needs for wood and
other forest products, and to pro¬
duce exportable commodities 	
Regardless of whether they are
used for firewood, construction
timber or wood pulp, exotic spe¬
cies (such as the much decried
eucalyptus varieties) seem to have
won acceptance." The eucalyptus,
which has adapted very well to
the savanna along the coast of
Congo, near Pointe Noire, reaches
maturity in seven years. The qual¬
ity of its fibre is highly suitable for
paper manufacturing, which is
why intensive eucalyptus planta¬
tion has been carried out in
Congo, Brazil and southeast Asia.
Research is also being carried out
on the production of paper from
straw.
Yet perhaps the simplest way
to manufacture paper is to make
it from paper itself. Europe pro¬
duced nearly 32 miUion tons of
pulp in 1991, while it consumed
about 25 million tons of waste
paper. Nearly 50 per cent of used
paper and newsprint is recycled.
A sheet of paper can be recycled
seven times. Satisfactory re¬
cycling, however, depends on the
quality of the sorting. Let users
take their waste paper to the
containers which are increasingly
being provided for that purpose in
cities, towns and villages. By doing
so they can help to prevent this
faithful ally of the written word
from being wasted.
