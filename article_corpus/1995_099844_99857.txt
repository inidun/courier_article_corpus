SOME DEFINITIONS
ALPHABET: a system of signs expressing
the basic sounds of a language. Unlike
scripts of pictographic origin such as
cuneiform or hieroglyphic scripts based
on a large number of stylized symbols, an
alphabet reproduces at least consonant
sounds via a small number of simplified
symbols. After a long process of evolu¬
tion, the Phoenician alphabet of 22 letters
took shape around 1100 B.C., and later
spread to many cities on the Mediter¬
ranean rim. Around the 8th century B.C.,
it was adopted by the Greeks, who added
letters for the vowels, thus making the
world's first complete alphabet.
CALAMUS: a reed whittled to a point or
bevelled and used for writing and callig¬
raphy.
CALLIGRAM: a text, usually poetic, the
words of which are arranged so as to form
a decorative pattern (also known as pat¬
tern poetry).
CODEX: to replace papyrus scrolls, which
were awkward to handle, sheets of parch¬
ment bound into the form of a book or
codex (plural codices) first appeared in
Rome in the 1st century A.D. Very long
documents could be reproduced in this
form.
CUNEIFORM: cuneiform ("wedge-
shaped") script, which first appeared
between 4000 and 3000 B.C. in
Mesopotamia, may be the world's oldest
form of writing. Originally pictographic,
its signs (about 550 derived from the per¬
mutation of 4 basic elements) gradually
came to have syllabic values, enabling
phonemes as well as objects to be desig¬
nated. This process was accompanied by
a reduction in the number of signs and a
simplification of their forms, leading even¬
tually to the creation, in Phoenicia, of the
first alphabet.
GLYPH: a writing sign incised or carved on
materials such as stone, as in pre-
Columbian civilizations.
HIEROGLYPHIC: Egyptian pictographic
or figurative writing used as early as the
4th millennium B.C., in which each hiero¬
glyph or sign (among some 700) repre¬
sented an object. Ideograms were also
used to express certain ideas, and phono¬
grams to render sounds. A strikingly suc¬
cessful use of hieroglyphs (etymological
meaning = "writing of the gods") was for
monumental inscriptions.
ICON: a sign that imitates the object it
describes, e.g. the drawing of a house to
represent a house.
IDEOGRAM: the representation of a mes¬
sage or an idea by means of drawings, in
some cases schematic and symbolic. Sev¬
eral varieties of ideographic writing arc
known, including cuneiform, Egyptian
hieroglyphics and Chinese.
PHONEME: a unit of spoken speech
(vowel or consonant).
PHONOGRAM: a sign or part of a sign
representing a word, a syllable or a
phoneme. The basis of alphabetical
writing, the signs of which represent only
sounds.
PICTOGRAM (OR PICTOGRAPH): an ele¬
ment in writing that represents an object
by means of stylized signs or symbols.
Each pictogram has a specific use, but an
abstract idea may be expressed by com¬
bining several of them. The first stage in
writing.
