One Islam, a mosaic of believers
Allah is one but Islam is a mosaic. The Muslim world is a linguistic tower of Babel, an ethnic
patchwork, a geographical puzzle and a political kaleidoscope offering a picture of extraordinary
doctrinal diversity
he word Islam derives from the Semitic
root slm, which means both “peace”and
“ p r o s p e r i t y.” Even much earlier than the
Koran, that root could be found in the
name Salem, the Canaan deity who
became the god of Ur-Salem,the City of
S a l e m , Je r u s a l e m . Names such as
S a l o m o n ,S a l o m e, Salmanassar (the king
of A s s y r i a ) , and the word s h a l o m (a gree-
ting that means “peace”in Hebrew and
Aramean) and s a l a m in A r a b i c, also stem
from s l m. For Muslims, “ I s l a m ” m e a n s
“ s u r r e n d e r,” entrusting onself to the will
of God. According to the Prophet
Mohammed, its basic ethic can be sum-
marized by “worshipping God without
associating anything with Him, o b s e r v i n g
the canonic prayer, paying the manda-
tory alms, fasting during the month of
R a m a d a n , offering food to the hungry
and the greeting of peace to neighbours
as well as strangers.”
Today Islam refers to both a religion
and a civilization,but the faithful would
rather use the term u m m a when referring
to the Muslim world (the community of
the faithful), or the expression dar el-
islam (the house of Islam).
That spiritual dwelling stretches from
Indonesia to Morocco,the Arctic Circle to
the Tropic of Cancer. It encompasses 57
states with very different political sys-
tems ranging from the medieval emirate
to the constitutional republic and every-
thing in between: u l t r a - c o n s e r v a t i v e,
I s l a m i c - C h r i s t i a n , modernist and secular
r e g i m e s.These countries are divided into
allies and enemies of the United States,
free-market and socialist economies, r i c h
and poor.
Few people are aware that one in
three Muslims lives in countries domi-
nated by other cultures, including Catho-
licism (France, Belgium), Protestantism
(United Kingdom, United States),
Orthodox Christianity (Russia, M a c e-
d o n i a ) , Judaism (Israel), H i n d u i s m
( I n d i a ) , Buddhism (Sri Lanka) and
Confucianism (China). In all, M o h a m-
med’s disciples—Turks, Kurds, Persians,

A r a b s, M a l a y s, B e r b e r s, S l a v s, C h i n e s e
and Africans—are spread out over a vast
a r e a , from the Javanese jungle to the
Sahara desert, the Himalayan mountains
to the steppes of Central Asia.
The same diversity can be found on
the level of doctrine.As Mohammed him-
self predicted,Islam has split into 73 dif-
ferent persuasions, currents, denomina-
t i o n s, confraternities and sects, i n c l u d i n g
S u n n i t e s, S h i i t e s, K h a r i j i s, Z a y d i s, A l a-
wites,Ahmadis,Alevites, Ibadis, Bohras,
Qadianis, Bektashis and Druzes. One in
ten believers is Shiite, while the majority
are Sunnite.Although this branch is consi-
dered “orthodox,” it is divided into four
major legal and theological schools
( H a n a fi,S h a fii ,M a l i k i ,H a n b a l i ) , each of
which dominates one swath of dar el-
i s l a m.As a result, the u m m a has as many
faces as Christianity. There is no single,
accepted authority.That accounts for why
it is difficult, if not impossible, for a
consensus to emerge on any point of faith,
dogma or politics.
Islam has no equivalent of the pope
nor of the Vatican,but there are several
intellectual centres. The Shiite world,
which is limited mostly to Iran,has a veri-
table clergy led by an ayatollah, t h e
highest “ r a n k ” in the religious hierarchy.
Sunnite Islam, in contrast, has no hierar-
chical structure. However, El Azhar, the
theological university in Cairo, serves as
an intellectual centre for u l e m a s (the doc-
tors of Islamic law) around the world.
Nevertheless, El Azhar is a state institu-
tion whose rector is appointed by the
Egyptian president. In Te h r a n ,Cairo and
elsewhere, religion remains very closely
linked to political power, when it does
not outrightly contest it. ■
