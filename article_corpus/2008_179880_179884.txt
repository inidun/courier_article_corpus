The project “Learning to read and 
write in good health”, launched 
in 2002 by the municipality of Curi-
tiba, capital of the state of Paraná, 
in southern Brazil, is bringing lite-
racy to adults in underprivileged 
neighbourhoods. The educational 
method combines alphabet and 
health: H as in Hygiene, O as in 
Osteoporosis, A as in AIDS… 
This fight against illiteracy in adults 
that goes hand in hand with promot-
ing their health is a result of the col-
laboration of two municipal sectors, 
Education and Health. Their experts 
produced photocopied lessons that 
they handed out to learners. They 
also set up a very simple mode of 
operation: volunteers sign up and 
undergo four hours of training, after 
being assigned to one of the city’s 
care centers. Since the launch of the 
programme, 163 volunteers have 
been trained in this way.

A good idea, positive social 
impact, multiple benefits: 
the equation sums up the 
success of the programme 
«Alfabetizando com Saúde». 
It received the UNESCO 
International Reading 
Association Literacy Prize 
this year. Its founders 
had intended for it to 
last only a short time!

Fernanda Portela, 23, a student in 
chemical engineering, is one of them 
and has been a facilitator for several 
months. “I discovered I enjoyed 
doing it,” she explains, on her way to 
the class where 12 students are wait-
ing for her. “It’s fantastic, because I 
notice that all of them have already 
made progress.” 
Following the first stage of volunteer 
training, it is the task of the com-
munity agents to rally the popula-
tion concerned: people who can’t 
read. Bernadette de Sa, 63, mother 
of four and with four grandchildren, 
has been going to the Alvorada 
Center, where she recently learned 
the letters of the alphabet. 
Proud of her success, she says that 
now she can read the price and names 
of the products in her neighbourhood 
market, and she can even take the 
bus by herself – impossible for her 
until recently, because she couldn’t 
read the destination signs. 
She has also learned to pay attention 
to possible symptoms of illnesses 
people in her age group are prone to. 
“As well as learning, one can pass on 
the information to others, she says, 
describing herself as a “chatterbox” 
who like to spend time talking to 
friends and neighbours and uses the 
opportunity to share what she has 
learned in class. 
Literacy and lucidity
The number of students per class 
varies and the duration of the learn-
ing period depends on each person’s 
capacity to learn.  … 

the first time the learner writes his 
own name.
The project is 
spreading to Africa
The project was launched in 2006 in 
Cabo Delgado in Mozambique. 
Brazilian experts were invited to 
develop two courses – one for teach-
ers and the other for students – with 
contents based on local epidemio-
logical data. 
In 2007, thanks to this partnership, 
30 teachers and 1200 literacy agents 
were trained. The programme 
“Alfabetizando com Saúde” has taken 
root in four Cabo Delgado districts. 
Luciano Ducci, now deputy mayor of 
Curitiba, was the head of the Health 
department when the programme was 
created. What’s special about it, in 
his view, is its ability to provide sig-
nificant benefits at little cost. “The 
founders’ wish is that the programme 
last only as long as it is needed to 
wipe out illiteracy,” he states. And it 
won’t need to last very long, in his 
opinion.  
the basis of the experiences and 
practical know-how of the learners 
themselves, taking into account their 
social position and worldview. 
A committee of experts is responsi-
ble for monitoring the progress of 
activities by visiting centres 
monthly. Among the programme’s 
greatest benefits can be cited 
improving the quality of life of learn-
ers and their families, disease pre-
vention, and boosting people’s 
self-esteem and reinforcing their 
sense of identity – notably when for 
… On the average, 400 people 
pass through some 30 city centres 
every year. In six years, more than 
2000 people have learned to read 
thanks to this method. Their ages 
range from 48 to 80. Consequently 
the health information is mainly 
focused on the chronic or acute dis-
eases that are most common at these 
ages. This year, 48 volunteers are 
working in 31 centres and 338 people 
are taking classes in Curitiba. 
Project coordinator Marisa Giacomini 
says enthusiastically “We have suc-
ceeded in bringing a large number of 
people out of the darkness of illiter-
acy.” Indeed, becoming literate is 
not only learning to read and write 
but also to look at the realities of 
life with greater lucidity. This is why 
many people are interested in the 
classes, simply to gain greater inde-
pendence: take a bus, write a little 
note to a distant relative, read the 
label of a medication or just read the 
Bible.

learners’ needs. Volunteers work on
