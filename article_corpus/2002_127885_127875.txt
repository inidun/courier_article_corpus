Joseph Stiglizt
The subtle truth about 
globalization
He is the hero of the anti-globalization movement and the nemesis of 
market fundamentalists. “Joe” Stiglitz, the controversial winner of the Nobel Prize 
for Economics finds the world “unfair” and wants to change it
In your latest book Globalization and
its Discontents you affirm that
globalization doesn’t work. Why?
 Because globalization doesn’t
work for the benefit of everybody,
even if some people and, in certain
parts of the world, many people, have
benefited from it. China and many
other Asian countries have increased
their exports. But in Latin America
the reforms of the 1990s have
resulted in instability. In many cases
growth has been very limited and the
benefits have gone disproportionately
to the rich. 
Do you think the crisis affecting
financial markets in rich countries is
linked to a dysfunctioning of
globalization?
 Yes and no. The problem is not
globalization itself but the
international economic institutions,
particularly the IMF that pushed a set
of ideas, like market fundamentalism,
a particular view of capitalism seen
as the best possible economic system,
the only economic system. The
troubles and recent scandals in the
United States and elsewhere have
shown that there are some very
serious problems with American-style
capitalism. Secondly, it illustrates the
link between politics and economics.

And this political link can be a
problem even in the US and
industrialized countries. When I was
on the Council of Economic Advisers
in the White House, we supported
initiatives to change the accounting
standards for executives’ stock
options. But Treasury, the financial
community, the corporations resisted
and succeeded in postponing the
reforms for another eight years at
great cost to the American economy. 
Which specific interests does
liberalization serve in the West?
 It does not serve only the
interests of some people in the West
but special interests within the
Northern and Southern countries. For
example, globalization of the capital
market serves the interests of
speculators and people who are
interested in pushing short-term
securities. Some of the unbalanced
trade rules, such as the intellectual
property regime, are pushed by drug
companies and the entertainment
industry over the interests of the
broader scientific community, over
those who are concerned by the
health and care of the very poor. 
But you don’t believe in the
“conspiracy theory” that is popular in
Asia and in Russia. Why? 
 Conspiracy suggests that people
get together, conspire and actively co-
ordinate working together. I think
that’s wrong. What I do think is that
there are certain ways of thinking and
certain political processes. The
market fundamentalists’ ideology is a

spark debate.” Loaded
with degrees, honors
and awards, including
the 2001 Nobel Prize for
economics, Joseph
Stiglitz has once again
achieved his goal. His
book Globalization and
Its Discontents
(published by W.W.
Norton, 2002) has
sparked often
passionate reactions the
world over. It has also
provoked some
ferocious attacks from
supporters of his bete
noire: the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
This neo-Keynsian has
not stopped denouncing
the “market fundamen-
talists” of the IMF. The
man who penetrated the
circle of global decision-
makers dared to speak
out against their “grand
hypocrisy.” In short, he
betrayed them.
Born in 1943 in Gary
(Indiana), Stiglitz is
considered to be one of
the most brilliant
economists of his
generation. During his
university studies at
Yale, Princeton, Oxford
and Stanford, where he
now teaches, he helped
to create a new
discipline: the economy
of information. In 1993
he joined the ultra-
exclusive Council of
Economic Advisers of
the White House, where
he became Bill Clinton’s
principal economic
councillor. In 1997, he
moved on to the World
Bank as chief economist
and vice president. 
But “Joe” Stiglitz hit
the first bump in his
career in 2000. In
January, he caused an
uproar by resigning,
because he considered
that the IMF did not give
him enough elbow room
to make the World Bank
slogan - “Our dream is a
world without poverty”
-a reality.

to pay for it

investments in a country’s future, so
they need to be given special priority.
But one has to look at how they
spend the money.
What do you think of the increasing
trend towards the privatisation of
educational services? 
 In general, it can represent a very
dangerous trend. In the US it often
serves to enhance segregation, not so
much racial segregation today but
social segregation. The private
schools often have better results
because in many cases their students
come from better backgrounds, with
better home education and so forth.
There’s a general belief in the power
of ICTs to reduce the economic gap
between rich and poor? What do you
think?
 The new technologies have the
power to reduce the gap between the
rich and the poor when the poor are
rich enough to avail themselves of
these new technologies. In countries
like China it is almost sure that they
will shorten the gap. But in Africa,
where there is almost no access to
NT, it would have the effect of
increasing the gap. 
Is it in the economic interest of the
poor countries to develop their own
intellectual property laws to protect
their assets (their biodiversity for
example) or is it better for them to let
the piracy of western products grow
as it is doing now?
 It is very important for them to
develop their own legal framework to
protect themselves against bio-piracy.
The problem right now is that it is an
unfair game because the developing
countries do not have the legal
resources to combat the expensive
American lawyers who work for the
firms engaged in this kind of activity.
It is critical for developing countries
to get together to have a concerted
Excerpts from 
Globalization and Its Discontents
“As I moved to the
international arena, I
discovered that […]
the decisions were made on
the basis of what seemed
a curious blend of ideology
and bad economics, dogma
that sometimes seemed to be
thinly veiling special
interests.”
“Today, few defend the
hypocrisy of pretending to
help developing countries by
forcing them to open up their
markets to the goods of the
advanced industrial countries
while keeping their own
markets protected, policies
that make the rich richer and
the poor more impoverished
– and increasingly angry.”
Speaking of the IMF: “The
change in mandate and
objectives, while it may have
been quiet, was hardly subtle:
from serving global economic
interests to serving the
interests of the global
finance.”
“The colonial mentality – the
certainty of knowing better
than developing countries
what is best for them -
persisted.”
“Globalization today is not
working for many of the
world’s poor. It is not working
for much of the environment.
It is not working for the
stability of the global
economy.”
In your book, you insist on the
tremendous impact that a good
education policy can have on
development.
 I would distinguish very strongly
between the position of the World
Bank and the position of the IMF.
The World Bank actually supports
educational projects in many
countries around the world. I saw
some very successful education
programmes first hand for instance in
Colombia, where they developed a
curriculum that facilitated migrant
workers’ children. In Ethiopia they
were thinking very hard how to
redesign a curriculum to reflect the
needs of people in that country. On
the other hand, quite often, the
austerity measures imposed as part of
the IMF programmes, undermine
education. The question is: are the
austerity programmes excessively
austere? From what I saw in Ethiopia
I can say very clearly that they were.
Educational expenditures are
very strong force, the political interest
in campaign contributions of the
financial community is a very strong
force. The problem is with the
political process, which is in many
ways undemocratic. It’s not
transparent and the voices of
particular countries and of particular
groups are more valuable than others. 
What is the impact of globalization in
the fields of education, culture and
knowledge sharing? 
 New technologies can support
cultural diversity by making it easier
for communities to express
themselves. But globalization has
sometimes been pushed too fast and
in an inappropriate way, threatening
the stability of existing cultures.
Many societies have traditional ways
of handling social support, but
sometimes international institutions
have come in with assistance
programmes that undermine those
local systems. 

effort and to use Doha, the new
round of trade negotiations, to say
“we have to revise the intellectual
property regime”. 
You are convinced that globalization
could be a force for the good of the
poor. What kind of changes are
needed to meet this goal?
 There has to be recognition,
particularly in the North, of the
nature of the inequities and of the
nature of the problems. I think the
majority of people in the North
believe in principles of equity and
fairness. If they become aware of
some of these issues they will begin
to put political pressures on their
governments to do something. That’s
the explanation for the Jubilee 2000
movement for debt forgiveness. But
there have to be longer-term
institutional reforms in international
economic institutions. 
What reforms would you introduce?
 I would change the voting
distribution because when one
“When foreign
business come in
they often destroy
local competitors,
quashing the
ambitions of the
small businessmen”
country, that is the US, has a veto
power it is inevitable that the IMF is
going to reflect the interests of the
US. And when the US is represented
by the US treasury it is inevitable that
interests within the financial market
are going to be heard more loudly. I
would also change the representation.
If the IMF was only engaged in
technical matters like insurance,
nobody would care that it is done by
the financial community. But IMF
policy is about education, health,
every aspect of society. And those
people who are affected have no
voice, absolutely no voice.
What would you do now in Argentina
for example?
 First, I would change from
focusing on trying to get foreign
money, which just goes into paying
foreign debts, and ask: “what can I
do inside the country? What is the
problem?” The problem is that
human resources, for example, are
not being used. How to get them to
be used? What you need is a market,
demand and working capital for the
firms, to get the system going again
instead of paying foreign creditors. I
would try to cultivate a special
arrangement on a temporary basis
with all of my trading partners so
that they would take more of my
goods and that they would provide
firms with working capital. It is all
about restarting the engine.
