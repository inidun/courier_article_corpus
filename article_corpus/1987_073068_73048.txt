THAT an impression of the "exotic" is relative stands in no further need of
proof. It is the effect of a mere spatial shift, distance, or, when distance is
abolished, the surprise of the first few moments. Here I am, now living
quite naturally in "faraway places", moving easily and without curiosity among
the same old customs. ... Now, it is the thought of returning to Old Europe that
seems like a mirage. ...
Consider me, yesterday morning, on the track which follows the circumference
of the island, riding in an American buggy harnessed to a rather frisky horse, with
Le Morne as the hub around which we turn. The endless reef, the calm sea, the
rustling of dry leaves that the land-crabs haul laboriously into their holes . . . there
is Faa-Nui, the great valley, the priestly name of Bora Bora itself.
Towards evening comes the beat of the drum, the conscientious summons to the
Upa-Upa, but it is not taken up. Cheerless couples pass by. A mere four dancers,
including the fine figure of Terii Farani. Night falls. The drum throbs in a frenzy,
played by an old blind man whose only joy in life is drumming.
The man's whole being is rhythm. His shoulders shake and follow the move¬
ments of the dance with great precision. He works up to emotional crescendos. He
is cajoling people to dance. The dejected couples look on indifferently. Half¬
heartedly, they form a ring. And now here is Terii Farani, in a white tapa,
crowned with large white flowers, her slightly hooked nose with its fine curve, her
flashing eyes, her delicately shaped and attractive mouth, and her proud stance
and she decides to take the lead. Her feet mark time with quick, tiny steps. Her
hips sway beneath her steadily motionless torso. Her arms undulate and swing;
her hands, from time to time, vibrate. Before she is drunk for later we shall give
her ample opportunity this woman is truly beautiful. Then, in the arms of a tane,
with her hand on his broad shoulder and the other clasping his equally broad
hand, in the very pose of our European waltz, she mimics our feeble little dances,
our fragile porcelain polkas, and gives them her beautiful gestures and attitudes,
and all the "grandiose grace" of her race.
And I think how very ridiculous a Frenchwoman would look if, spontaneously,
without any practice beforehand, she tried to imitate some native dance step!
This woman has a pure beauty.
The few lights go out and the old drum slackens its pace. The great grass-fringed
lawn darkens to black, and the night swallows thefare-himene, the fare-puera and
the school, three great edifices, the last two of which have proved lethal to the
country. We are doing much to force "civilization" into retreat, and doing it
cheerfully! In disobedience to official orders and moral injunctions, a few gallons
of strong rum have been brought ashore, together with plentiful supplies of wine.
We go indoors, and encourage the dancers and musicians to drink. And these
dignified women get drunk as if they were performing a duty, promptly, draining
at a draught each glass as it is held out to them, until their eyes turn up in their
sockets and their lips grow thick. ... The company includes the very young
Tanahoa, a nice fellow, who asks for "perfumes" and offers his relative in
exchange; and there is Atu, the relative in question, tall and gentle, with such kind
eyes, and Hina (the Moon-child), nearly auburn and wilder, and then Rereao,
slighter and livelier; and finally, Terii Farani, who complicates her dances with
new steps, inspired by alcohol, who nevertheless holds her graceful posture, and
who, above all, is prudent enough to withdraw from the scene before her inevi¬
table collapse.
The honest schoolteacher, who leads a devout and upright life and sings in
church, must be losing sleep, in his fare almost next door!

Island fling
by Victor Segalen
s
In 1903 and 1904, the French writer
Victor Segalen (1878-1919), a surgeon
aboard the Tahiti-based sloop la Durance,
sailed the length and breadth of
Polynesia. He was immediately aware of
the drama then being enacted in the
islands: the slow disappearance of the
traditional Maori civilization. He set out
to collect the surviving evidence of this
civilization about which he wrote a
masterpiece, Les immémoriaux,
published in 1907 under the pseudonym
ofMaxAnély. He also returnedfrom his
voyage with the draft of an "essay on
exoticism". In his denunciation of the
tragedy ofa people being deprived of its
myths and language, Segalen draws
attention to the fatal inner destruction
which the clash of two civilizations can
bring about.
