Building blocks of  
In a world of cut-throat competition, Denmark is a European
leader in worker training and education. The LEGO group offers
its employees courses that are not directly related to their jobs
in a bid to educate ‘the whole person’
■
“Danish industries are way ahead of
i n d u s t ries in other European
c o u n t ries when it comes to training
and upgrading the skills of employe e s ,” s ay s
C h ristian Braad, a consultant at the
E d u c ational Department of the
Confederation of Danish Industries.
In a labour force survey carried out in
1996 by Eurostat , the European Union
S t atistics Office, more than 8 million
Europeans over 30 years of age were asked
whether they had received any kind of
teaching or training in the four we e k s
preceding the interv i e w. Denmark came
out on top with around 12 per cent of
respondees answe ring “ ye s ” , more than
three times the EU average.
“And we are not resting on our laurels,”
Braad continues.“ E d u c ation is increasingly
becoming a focus area for both small and
large companies.Whereas opportunities for
education once went mainly to employees
in high positions and skilled wo r k e rs ,t h e r e
is now a marked trend for unskilled wo r k e rs
to be offered—or even required to at t e n d —
various kinds of educational courses.With
increasing globalization companies have to
be flexible,and so does the workforce.”
Braad adds that the flexible and
i n d e p e n d e n t , but gove rn m e n t - s u b s i d i z e d ,
Danish system of skills training centres is an
indispensable tool to achieve this.The system
was introduced in the 1960s to offer short
courses for workers as a response to
increasing use of technology and demand for
q u a l i fied labour. L at e r , other kinds of adult
e d u c ation were ava i l a b l e , focusing more on
“ s o f t ” issues not directly related to specific
job skills.
“The system can accommodate the
special needs of individual companies,”
Braad say s , “and at the same time offer
general training and education which is not
job- or company - s p e c i fic. In the short term
companies may complain that their
e m p l oyees are taught things that they
cannot directly use in their present job. O n
the other hand it increases the mobility of
the wo r k f o r c e , and this is important for
Danish industries in general.”
Two reasons are cited to explain why
“ s o f t ” c o u rses which seek to educate “ t h e
whole pers o n ” are increasingly used by big
Danish companies and why employees are
encouraged to take them. One is the need
for a more widely educated workforce as a
result of the general trend to delegate powe rs
to floor level—to replace foremen with self-
g ove rning gr o u p s.The other is an increased
focus on quality control as the responsibility
of each individual rather than of outside
c o n t r o l l e rs.
Right from the start the Danish
government subsidized workers attending
training courses. Today it pays around 70
per cent of an employe e ’s salary while he or
she is on a course; the employer pays the
r e s t . In some cases the gove rnment eve n
refunds the topping up of the salary.
Education
for unskilled workers
Most Danish companies make use of the
s y s t e m , but some big companies have taken
the lead in developing new kinds of cours e s.
One of them is the LEGO group, a toy-
m a n u fa c t u ring firm which employs close on
10,000 people worldwide.The success of
LEGO, a term formed from the Danish
words “Leg Godt” ( “ p l ay we l l ” ) , has been
largely built on 8-studded plastic bri c k s ,e a c h
m e a s u ring just under 5 cm3, which can be
pressed together and assembled into a wide
range of toy constru c t i o n s. Some 189 billion
of them were moulded between 1949 and
the end of 1997. The company has a
workforce of 4,300 at the bustling town of
B i l l u n d ,where LEGO was founded in 1932.
In 1987 LEGO set up its ow n

focused on unskilled wo r k e rs and soft
c o u rses on such subjects as “ P r e p a ri n g
yourself for education”,“Improving basic
reading and writing skills”, E n g l i s h ,
information technology, management and
team bu i l d i n g . LEGO employees are
encouraged to take courses both duri n g
work-time and during their time off, t h at
do not necessarily have any relevance to
their jobs.Around 1,500 people have taken
p a rt in the courses since 1995. A l t h o u g h
there are no statistics to prove it, L E G O
feels sure that the courses have a positive
impact on job sat i s faction and productivity.
“In a fast changing wo r l d ,w h at you did
yesterday will not suffice tomorrow,” says
Ku rt A u l b j e r g, head of LEGO’s human
resource development depart m e n t .
“ Traditional skills-upgrading courses are
not sufficient. Our approach to education
has to be much more broadminded.”
In other wo r d s , the LEGO gr o u p
cannot afford only to make use of the hands
of its employe e s. The company wants the
whole person.
Poul Erik Pe t e rs e n , a metal worker and
shop steward for 150 metal workers, went
on a personality cours e . He started off
feeling sceptical.
“I have been on several job-relat e d
c o u rses to upgrade special skills,” Pe t e rs e n
s ay s ,“and nobody questions the relevance of
this kind of educat i o n . Since becoming a
shop steward two ye a rs ago, I have also
attended a six-week course laid on by my
trade union. But being on a course that
focuses on your personality rather than yo u r
professional skills is quite another story. A l l
of a sudden you are being questioned about
w h at you do when you are off the job. D o
you have skills, e x p e riences or talents that
can make you perform better at wo r k ? ”
Pe t e rsen cites the case of a yo u n g
secretary who had to get a signature from
her superior for every piece of expenditure
she endorsed from her depart m e n t , n o
m atter how small. “ D u ring a course she
mentioned that she was the treasurer of a
big sports association and responsible for
an annual budget of around $40,000.As a
consequence she was gi ven more
responsibility in her daily wo r k , t h u s
relieving her superior of simple duties and
increasing her own job satisfaction.”
Made-to-measure
training courses
Pe t e rsen is in favour of a flexible approach
whereby each employee can more or less
design his or her own educational plan.
“With so many people from ve ry different
b a c k gr o u n d s , you cannot make the same
c o u rses compulsory for eve ryo n e ,” he say s.
“ T h at would have a negat i ve impact on
m o t i vat i o n .We have to realize that people
who have worked here for many ye a rs ,w h o
joined us immediately after school,and who
h ave been used to taking orders ,m ay not be

prepared for change, to take responsibility
and become students again.” On the other
h a n d , Pe t e rsen adds, “all employees must
prepare themselves for this. Otherwise we
will lose out to other countri e s. ”
B e n ny Pe t e rs e n , a shop stewa r d
representing 70 unskilled wo r k e rs , a gr e e s.
“Life—and working life in part i c u l a r — h a s
become a process of ongoing educat i o n ,”h e
s ay s. He joined the LEGO group 20 ye a rs
a g o, and he has lost track of the number of
c o u rses he has attended since then. In his
opinion one of the best courses is the one-
week course on “ P r e p a ring yo u rself for
e d u c at i o n ” .
“It may not look ve ry relevant to most
wo r k e rs and I have met quite a few who we r e
ve ry sceptical beforehand,” he say s. “But to
me it shows that ‘soft issues’ like psychology
are as relevant and important as hard skills.”
The LEGO group makes wide use of
local education institutions, using their
regular courses as well as courses specially
designed for its employe e s.“ We are extremely
f o rt u n ate in that Denmark has this highly
d e veloped system of skills training centres
and other educational institutions that offer
a va riety of courses that are flexible to the
needs of local bu s i n e s s ,” explains A u l b j e r g .
“ R e p r e s e n t at i ves of local municipalities
and counties sit on the boards of these
i n s t i t u t i o n s ,and trade unions and employe rs ’
associations are also represented. This
ensures a ve ry close dialogue between the
institutions and local companies and enables
the institutions to respond ve ry quickly to
local needs. If the LEGO group starts up a
new production facility in a regi o n , we talk
with the local schools and can have special
c o u rses designed to meet our needs.”
“This benefits both the employer and
the employe e ,” Poul Erik Pe t e rsen say s. “ I n
fa c t , it can also be used as a means to
a c h i e ve job securi t y.The LEGO group and
most other big companies have peak
p e riods eve ry ye a r , but also periods with
less wo r k . D u ring off-peak peri o d s
e m p l oyees are often laid off or moved to
other depart m e n t s. With good planning
these periods can be used for cours e s ,
which—again—is to the benefit of all of us.”
But Aulbjerg emphasizes that the
g ove rnment subsidy is not the driving force
behind his company ’s education policy. “ I t
is based on our needs and pri o ri t i e s ,” h e
says,“and in some cases we have declined
subsidies that we were entitled to.” ■
