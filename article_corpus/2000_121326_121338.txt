My first contact with oral tradition on
Marrakesh’s Jemâa-el-Fna square
led me to start thinking about the
s p e c i fic nature of written literature,
and the differences between these
two modes of expression.In oral communication,
the speaker can refer to the context at any time:in
other words, to a specific situation with which the
listeners are familiar. In written literature, the author
and reader have nothing in common aside from
the text written by the former and membership (by
birth or learning) in the same linguistic community.
Oral literature establishes a line of communication
between a speaker and a listener, both of whom
experience the world in a similar or even identical
w a y. Reading a novel,on the other hand, e s t a b l i s h e s
communication between a narrator and a reader; t h e
former is unable to verify whether the latter
p o s s e s s e s, at the time of reading, s u f f i c i e n t
knowledge of the context to understand the text.
That is why the reader, distant from the text in
space and/or time, needs an intermediary to recreate
the context and fill in the gaps. Hence the presence
in translated novels of the editor’s or translator’s
explanatory notes.
In the h a l c a, the circle of listeners and spectators
that forms around the storyteller, none of that is
necessary. The storyteller addresses these people
d i r e c t l y ; they are his accomplices.The text he recites
or improvises functions like a score, leaving the
performer a wide margin of freedom. In the oral
tradition,changes in voice and oratorical rhythm,
expressions and gestures, play a fundamental role:
even a seemingly sacred text can be parodied and

JUAN GOYTISOLO
The oral traditions of Marrakesh’s famous square are unique in the world
for their richness and variety. They are also the roots of a new concept:
humanity’s oral and intangible heritage
There is no other square like this in the world.Every day, musicians,storytellers,dancers,jugglers and bar

lowered to a scatological level. In children’s stories
and chansons de geste, the frequent use of para-
linguistic devices and cynegetic sketches (which
evoke hunting), stresses the magic, power or
dramatic aspects of the episodes being told.
As my knowledge of d a r i x a ( M o r o c c o ’s A r a b i c
dialect) improved, I was able to appreciate the
richness and variety of the oral traditions preserved
within Marrakesh’s Jemâa-el-Fna square. I attended
performances of classical works like The T h o u s a n d
and One Nights a n d A n t a r i a, legends based on X e h a,
A i ch a and K a n d i x a—to mention just three popular
folk heroes—comic improvisations,and a number of
sexual pantomimes by highly talented h a l a i q u i s
( s t o r y t e l l e r s ) , of whom Saruh and Bakchich, b o t h
now dead, merit a special mention.They expressed
themselves effortlessly in the spectators’ dialect,
using euphemisms which only those sly folk with long
experience of the h a l c a could decipher.
Jemâa-el-Fna is a great melting pot of folk
cultures where the Berber and g n a w i t r a d i t i o n s
c o n v e r g e.The Berber tradition is characterized by
songs and recitals in Ta m a z i g h t , the language of the
majority of Berbers, or in Soussi, the language of
Berbers from the Agadir region.Performances range
from love poems to elegies to works of moral and social
c r i t i c i s m . G n a w i are the descendents of slaves who
belonged to a popular confraternity.Their vast repertory
includes invocations and prayers that are part of ritual
trance ceremonies. Professor Hamid Hogadem has
recently assembled recordings he has made of present-
day h a l a i q u i s from the three traditions in a single volume,
which will be soon be published with the support of
UN E S C O.
Everything belonging just to the
present is doomed to perish with it
As the years go by, my thoughts on the specificity of
literature have extended to the relationship between
oral and written traditions. In the European and A r a b
cultures I am familiar with,their interdependence shows
that a codified and listed oral tradition has nurtured the
development of written literature, which returned the
favour by seeping into the circuits of oral story-telling.
Many lyrical and narrative medieval texts have been
written for public performance,and can only be properly
understood when their acoustic and para-linguistic
dimensions are taken into account. It is highly signific a n t
that the 20th century’s most innovative and sensitive
narrative authors, including James Jo y c e,L o u i s - Fe r d i n a n d
C é l i n e,Arno Schmidt,Carlo Emilio Gadda,G u i a m a r a e s
Rosa and Guillermo Cabrera Infante, combined writing
with basic features of the oral tradition.Their novels—
featuring a whole range of competing voices—sound as
if they were meant to be read aloud,enabling readers to
appreciate the true value of the underlying literary
e x p l o i t s. For my part, I would point to how much the
s q u a r e ’s oral cross-winds inspired me in writing my novel
M a k b a r a.My work would probably have been different
without them. The act of listening—in other words, t h e
simultaneous presence of the author or storyteller and an
attentive audience—gives a new dimension to poetic
and narrative texts, as it did in the time of Chaucer,
B o c c a c i o, Juan Ruiz, Ibn Zayid, and Al Hariri.A buried
thread links the Middle Ages to the literary avant-garde
of the twentieth century. As the great Russian theorist
Mikhail Bakhtin subtly showed,a work cannot survive the
centuries to come unless it has been
nurtured by the centuries that have gone
b e f o r e. Everything belonging just to the
present is doomed to perish with it.
For many reasons, the fragility and
precariousness of Jemâa-el-Fna causes
me ongoing concern. The spectacle
offered by the square is the product of a
fortunate combination of circumstances
(some documents indicate that it existed
as far back as the mid-16th century), b u t
it may vanish,swept away by the assault of
unbridled modernity that jeopardizes our
lives and our works. Considered until recently as a vestige
of the Third World by a large part of Morocco’s
Europeanized elite (causing the square to be temporarily
closed after independence before popular pressure
compelled the authorities to re-open it), it is paradoxically
appreciated for its very anachronism.Urban planners and
technologically-advanced societies from “ d e v e l o p e d
c o u n t r i e s ” even consider it a desirable model, w o r t h
emulating as a site where people from all walks of life
come to meet and talk with each other,as well as eat,s h o p
and stroll, enjoying the richness and variety of a place that

is continuously in motion.As I wrote in these pages
years ago, the square may be destroyed by decree,b u t
not created by one. Becoming aware of that will
probably help to save it.
E v e r-increasing traffic, e n v i r o n m e n t a l
deterioration and,above all, certain building projects
that flagrantly violate a law passed in 1922—projects
which, if they are actually built, will disfigure the
environs of Jemâa-el-Fna forever—are serious
enough to merit a worldwide campaign to save the
square’s endangered oral and intangible heritage.
Since the meeting of experts from many different
and sometimes very distant regions organized by
UN E S C O in Marrakesh in June 19771,we have been
acutely aware that this is the only place on the
planet where musicians, s t o r y t e l l e r s,d a n c e r s, j u g g l e r s

and bards put on a new show before large crowds
every day of the year. The square offers us an
ongoing spectacle in which the distinction between
actors and spectators fades: everyone can be one or
the other if he or she desires. We live in a world
where the information technology juggernaut is
homogenizing and impoverishing our lives by
bottling them up in the remote-controlled darkness
of privacy. Jemâa-el-Fna offers the exact opposite:
a public space that fosters social life through a
mixture of humour, tolerance and diversity created
by its poets and storytellers.
In 1997, UN E S C O’s general conference adopted
the concept of humanity’s oral and immaterial
heritage, giving vital backing to plans to protect a
vast number of oral and musical traditions,crafts and
k n o w l e d g e, not to mention the “living human
treasures”who possess them.2
Today, it is no longer possible to deny that all
cultural richness, which sowed the seeds of what we
call “high culture,” will be swept away if we do not
rush to its rescue. ■

focusing on the preservation of places where folk
culture thrives, a new concept of cultural

A public space that invites conviviality.
