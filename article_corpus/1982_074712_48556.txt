The role
of the World Health Organization
The World Health Organization (WHO)
carries wide responsibilities for the sup¬
port of Member States who request aid
or advice in dealing with their drug-
related health problems (including prob¬
lems related to alcohol and tobacco
use). One of the most important func¬
tions of WHO, which falls within its co¬
ordinating role, is the international
transfer of information on health mat¬
ters, the Organization being used as a
neutral ground for abstracting, assessing
and disseminating information. It is a
responsibility of WHO to make such in¬
formation available to those who need it.
Among its priorities the Organization
must co-operate with countries in rela¬
tion to drug dependence in order to:
a) increase the effectiveness of health
and social service delivery systems by
developing effective low-cost ap¬
proaches to treatment and rehabilitation
of drug-dependent patients;
b) develop strategies for treatment
and prevention through primary health
care and in the framework of country
health programmes, in countries with in¬
adequate or no health or social care
systems;
c) co-ordinate international research in
drug dependence;
d) strengthen the planning of effective
prevention and control programmes
through the international collection and
exchange of data on the epidemiology of
drug dependence;
e) ensure that suitable training pro¬
grammes , are provided to meet man¬
power needs;
f) work in partnership with other
United Nations agencies and organiza¬
tions that have direct responsibilities for
drug problems;
g) fulfil the responsibilities identified
in the international conventions concer¬
ning drugs;
h) establish an effective co-ordinating
mechanism whereby the knowledge and
experience of non-governmental orga¬
nizations and centres of excellence may
be transmitted and adapted to countries
with few technical and human
resources.
WHO responsibilities derive from the
World Health Assembly, the Executive
Board and the Regional Committees,
and from the International Narcotics
Treaties. Resolutions adopted by the
Health Assembly provide policy and
priority directives to implement ac¬
tivities for the control of alcohol and
drug problems.
During the past five years, WHO has
set up a collaborative relationship with a
number of centres of excellence. In the
mental health programme, which in¬
cludes drug dependence activities, col¬
laborating centres serve as a link bet¬
ween WHO and national authorities for
programme -purposes; they are respon¬
sible for formal and informal exchange
of information at national, regional and
global levels, and they function as focal
points for specific research activities,
and as training centres.
So far, five centres have been
designated WHO Collaborating Centres
for Research and Training in Drug
Dependence: the Addiction Research
Foundation, Toronto, Canada; the Mex¬
ican Centre of Studies on Pharmaco-
dependency, Mexico City; the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville,
Maryland, USA; the Drug Dependence
Research Project, University of Sains,
Penang, Malaysia; and the Health
Research Institute, Chulalongkorn
University, Bangkok, Thailand.
