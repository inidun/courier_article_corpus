THE LESSON BECAME A CRUSADE
IN a certain United States city hygienic conditions ina number of public eating places were unsatisfactory.
Each day newspapers published articles and letters
on the need for a"clean-up". Finally, however, it was
the students of a class in 9th year Health Biology who
went into action and brought about a great improvement
in the standard of sanitation.
How the. se students did it as a regular part of their
school activity is told by John S. Richardson in a report
sp. ecially written for Unesco's Division for the Dissemi-
nation of Science (Introduction of Experimental Science
in the Elementary and Secondary Schools of the United
States. UNESCOjNSjPSIj9).
"The newspaper accounts",
writes Mr. Richardson,"were
brought to class each day
and analyzed for facts and
assumptions. Finally the class
accepted and defined three or
four of the most significant
problems. These problems
dealt with the cleanliness of
hamburger shops, soda noun-
tains and the like.
"In the process of discussion.
the students had to arrive at
definitions as to what consti-
tutes cleanliness. They decid-
ed that the one way to get
information was by observa-
tion and experiment. Sterile
culture plates were made, and
then students set out to expose
the culture plates to the air
in the. eating places.
EVIDENCE BY FLASHLIGHT
PERMISSION was obtainedfrom attendants to expose
the cloths with which
they wiped the counters. The
cleanliness of the attendants'
ciothing as well as their hands
and finger nails was noted.
The students checked the state
of floors, and took cultures of
dishes that had been washed.
Two boys even went to a
popular hamburger shop after
closing hours and obtained a
l1ashlight picture through the
window of food on the counter
inside.
"Cultures were propp. rly
grown and compared with
"ontro] cultures. The students
asked that a bacteriologist
from the county health de-
partment come to the class
and examine their evidence
and help them identify some
of the bacteria on the plates.
They made pure cultures of
some of the bacterial strains,
strained them and identified
some of the more common
types.
"Many periods were spent in
recording, organizing and in-
terpreting the evidence. Re-
ports were formulated and
criticized in class and conclu-
SIons relating to the stated
problems were drawn.
CLEAN UP OR CLOSE UP
PERHAPS the most interest-ing and significa  ou
come occurred when the
class decided without thp
knowledge of the teacher to
take some action. This action
took the form of letters
written to local papers, all of
which were published, and
others were written to p : aces
that had been found to be un-
sanitary, threatening boycott
unless certain practices of good
sanitation, which were set
forth in the letter, were insti-
tuted.
"The result was a very sharp
and observable clean-up OJ
almost all of the local ham-
burger and soda places which
were frequented by the stu-
dents.
This Report is the first in a
series intended to stimulate
discussion on the responsible
and difficult task of"teaching
for thinking". One of the best
ways of doing this seems to be
to make the pupils actively
acquainted with the scientific
approach to things.

Elementary and secondary
Schools in Switzerland" (UN-
ESCO/NS PSI/10.) is also
available on request to Unesco.
