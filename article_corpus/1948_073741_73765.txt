_ ; The progress made in education

. ears is such that the results of
--jthe discussion groups and general
I-' (fneetings of the Seminar are ex-
l''too to prove of unusual inte-
sot. Since the war, many pro-

1< n initiated in Latin American
unties and long-held educatio-
lay values are being seriously
; questioned and examined by edu-
castors all over South America.

iha. ve given particular attention to
child deliquency, especially in'azil, Chile and Ecuador where
tits relation to school attendance
:' : J1as brought out soch outstanding
dies as those of Piragibe andtHauck Magofke,. while Argentina,
lombia and Cuba have paid
ticular attention 10 research in, history of education, to cite
y a few cases.
Harold Benjamin, of the Uni-
ersity of Maryland, writing in
"handbook of Latin Amer-
s can Studies" (Number 10) states :
"The growing body of educa-
'onal writings, especially in the
'elms of theory, curriculum, and
organization, show that the
, 0015 of the American countries
us coming more and more to de-
their own problems, examine
; emir own objectives, and critize
eir own practices in terms of
e needs of their own people.
LTley have long believed in the
M maxim,"Nemo dat quod non
'abet", and now they are work-
tao give their educational ins-titutions resources of Personnel
equipment proportional to
ne tremendous task of the school
B and tor democracy."
