m
.s MEDITERRANEAN
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
Tin; Mediterranean, which lies
between southern Europe,
western Asia and North Africa,
is the world's largest inland sea.
Created by the continental
movements that forced up the Alps,
the Mediterranean basin is one of
our planet's most geologically
unstable areas, subject to earth¬
quakes and flanked by many vol¬
canoes. The waters of the Mediter¬
ranean, fed by the Atlantic through
the Straits of Gibraltar, are renewed
every ninety years. Saltier and
warmer than the ocean, the
Mediterranean is almost tideless.
Of all the world's seas, it has longest
been the scene of human activity.
The great civilizations of Egypt,
Greece and Rome grew up on its
shores.
It has its own characteristic land¬
scapes and vegetation. To the north,
there are red rocks studded with
agaves and prickly pears sur¬
rounding small harbours that shelter
brightly-coloured fishing-boats,
ancient olive groves, umbrella pines
and tall black cypresses, steeply-
sloping islands dotted with spot¬
lessly white villages. To the south
stretch endless sandy beaches where
the Sahara meets the sea. The cli¬
mate is similar to that of California,

offering a quality of life that has
made the region popular with
tourists. The northern shores are
warm in summer and mild and
damp in winter; to the south the
climate is dry and hot.
But the hospitableness of its
coastlands, its rich history arid a
beauty marred only by occasional
storms have not been unmixed
blessings for the Mediterranean.
The cities on its shores have mush¬
roomed, particularly to the south
where there has been a population
explosion. Cairo now has more than
twelve million inhabitants; Alexan¬
dria has five million, Algiers 1 .5 mil¬
lion and Tripoli 1.2 million. In all,
100 million people now live around
the Mediterranean, and the figure is
expected to double by the year 2025.
In addition, 100 million local holi-
daymakers and foreign tourists visit
the area annually, and that figure is
expected to increase to 300 million
over the same period.
This human tide brings with it an
accumulation of refuse that the
Mediterranean countries are unable
to cope with. Further pollution is
caused by the vehicles that bring in
the tourists. There is also pressure
on the area's limited water

resources, since most tourists come
in summer the dry season
reducing the amount available for
local inhabitants. In Israel, Libya
and Malta, intensive water use is
threatening total exhaustion of sup¬
plies. Furthermore, the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) estimates that about 70 per
cent of the two billion cubic metres
of often severely polluted water
from the region's domestic and
industrial outfalls is discharged into
the sea entirely untreated.
A TORRENT OF THREATS
The deluge of industrial and
domestic waste, oil-tanker spillages,
over-building and the tourist flood
mean that the Mediterranean is now
under serious threat. Its inshore
waters are polluted, since, even if
waste water is treated, billions of
bacteria find their way continually
into the sea, threatening bathers
with infection. Its coastline is dis¬
figured in many areas by uncon¬
trolled urban sprawl. The advan¬
tages ofsiting factories on the coast
so that raw materials can be deliv¬
ered by sea have been only too well
understood by industry; there are
now thirty-seven refineries and
tanker terminals, thirty-two indus¬
trial complexes and thirteen nuclear
power stations located on its shores.
Twenty per cent of the world's oil
traffic passes through the Mediter¬
ranean, and the amount of waste
oil flushed into it each year is sev¬
enteen times the size of the Exxon
Valclez oil spill in Alaska in 1989. To
that figure must be added the size¬
able amounts of naturally-occur¬
ring bitumen that ooze into its
waters and the fourteen oil-tanker
accidents that have occurred in the
Mediterranean in the last fifteen
years.
In addition to this substantial pol¬
lution by hydrocarbons, a great deal
ofdamage is being done on shore in
the Mediterranean lands, many of
which were thickly forested within
historical times. Deforestation, car¬
ried out to create farmland, extend
cities or provide fuel or ship¬
building materials, has brought
irreparable erosion in its wake. In
addition to solids brought by rain,
rivers carry down to the sea such
pollutants as detergents, pesticides
and heavy metals like mercury, zinc
or chrome. The Po in Italy, the Ebro
in Spain, the Egyptian Nile, the
Rhône in France, and other rivers
drain off agricultural and industrial
waste, in the case of the Rhône
alone from a catchment area of
94,604 square kilometres and
there are twenty-nine catchment
areas around the Mediterranean!
One direct consequence of this
pollution were the "red tides" which
affected the Italian coastline from
Venice to Ancona in July 1989, cov¬
ering the beaches in a foul-smelling,
glutinous sludge. This phenomenon
is caused by eutrophication (a term
derived from the Greek word
eutrophos, literally "well-fed"), a
process that occurs when decom¬
posing waste matter uses up the
dissolved oxygen in the water, suf¬
focating the local flora and fauna
except for invertebrates, plankton,
bacteria and tiny fungal growths.
The areas most threatened by the
phenomenon include the Golfe du
Lion, the Lake of Tunis, the bay of
Izmir and the Venetian lagoon.

The flora of the Mediterranean
faces many dangers, one of them
being the destruction of the Posi-
donia sea-grass meadows that serve
as the lungs, larder and nursery of
the sea, and where hundreds of
marine species reproduce. Jetties
and marinas encroaching on their
habitat can destroy them, as can
pleasure boats, which tear the
plants up with their anchors.
Recently another danger has
appeared in the form of a "killer"
alga, the almost fluorescent green
Caulerpa taxifolia. Introduced acci¬
dentally off Monaco, it has now
begun to spread on the sea-bed. It is
toxic and has no known predators.
No way of eliminating it has yet
been found, and it has already
spread too widely to be simply
pulled up by hand.
The sea's fauna is equally threat¬
ened. In the course of an expedi¬
tion on the Calypso, Yves Paccalet, a
member of Captain Jacques-Yves
Cousteau's team, noted the gradual
disappearance of the monk seal,
one of the world's twelve most
threatened species. There were
almost 1,000 monk seals in the
Mediterranean in 1980, but their
ranks have been decimated by
hunters and fishermen and only
about eighty are left. The logger¬
head turtle (Caretta carena) now
only lays its eggs on Greek and
Turkish beaches, where they are
often trodden underfoot by tourists.
The turtles often get entangled in
fishing-nets and end up on the
menu in local restaurants. Other
endangered species include the
grouper, the mantis shrimp, the
rough pen shell {Pinna nobilis)
which can grow almost a metre
long, and the date mussel
{Lithophaga lithophaga), which
lives in clefts in the rocks.
A PLAH OF ACTION
To deal with this alarming situation,
an Action Plan for the Mediter¬
ranean has been drawn up on the
initiative and under the auspices of
UNEP, and it was adopted at
Barcelona in 1975. It commits the
eighteen countries bordering on the
Mediterranean, as well as the other
members of the European Eco¬
nomic Community, not only to pro¬
tect the sea from pollution but also
to ensure that coastal development
respects the environment. Ismail
Sabri Abdalla, an Egyptian econo¬
mist, and Serge Antoine of France's
Ministry of the Environment were
commissioned to carry out a fore¬
cast of future developments, and
their work provided the basis for a
"Blue Plan" on future prospects for
the area that was published in 1988
under the direction of Michel
Bâtisse, President of the Blue Plan
Regional Activity Centre and a
former Assistant Director-General
(Science) of Unesco. In 1990 the
Mediterranean Environmental
Technical Assistance Programme
(METAP) was launched jointly by
the EEC, the United Nations Devel¬
opment Programme (UNDP), the
European Investment Bank and the
World Bank. In 1993 it was suc¬
ceeded for a further three years by
METAP II.
Will this be enough? Michel
Bâtisse thinks that oceanographers
have exaggerated the extent of
marine pollution. "The sea is pol¬
luted, certainly, but only near the

coastline. Fifteen kilometres out it's
perfectly clean. Oil spills disperse
very quickly. It's true that heavy
metals are carried in the atmos¬
phere, that natural mercury wells
up on the seabed in some places
and that sedimentary pollution
needs studying. But it is still not
proven that the fish are poisonous,
even if fishermen are recommended
not to eat them at every meal.
"In my view, the fight against ero¬
sion, the preservation of water
resources, which are too often
wasted, and the protection of the
coastal scenery are the priority
tasks. Rapid population growth on
the southern and eastern shores is
the big problem. Countries have to
support their populations, but how?
They are not self-sufficient in food
production, so they have to import,
and they have neither industrial
products nor services to sell in
exchange. Algeria and Libya export
oil, bu t it's starting to run out. Their
only resource is tourism, but that
depends on the coastline not being
ruined by uncontrolled construc¬
tion driven by the search for quick
profits."
