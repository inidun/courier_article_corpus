"ECONOMIC UNDER-DEVELOPMENT"-Enemy Of Man :
ECONOMISTS were the first to use the phrase"under-
developed areas". Yet as a definition solely in the
language of monetary exchange-in dollars, pounds, pesos,
rupees or gourdes-it is grossly inadequate. A better
definition would have to include the overtones of graphic
descriptions of famines, epidemics ; of unceasing and un-
rewarding labour, of the plight of hundreds of millions of
human beings, prevented by ignorance from finding a way
out of their misery. Statistics fail to give these overtones of
tragedy that alone can provide an adequate definition. Yet
statistics are used here for their graphic simplicity.
In 1939, a survey was made
of fifty-three nations on all
the world's continents These
countries were divided into
three groups ; the first was
of fifteen nations with a per
capita annual income of more
than $200 ; the second, ten
countries, with a per capita
annual income of between
$100 and $200 ; the third,
twenty-eight countries, with a
per capita annual income less
than $100. The first group
made up one-fifth of the
world's population ; the second,
one-sixth ; the third, making
about two-thirds of the world
people, was co-terminous with
the"under-developed areas"
The Yawning Gap
THIS was before a tremend-ous war which wid ed
the gap between the high-
est and the lowest. Here are
some further differences :
1. Life expectancy at birth
in the first group was sixty-
three years,"Under-developed
areas"showed, when figures
were available, an average of
forty years, in some cases fall-
ing as low as twenty-seven
years.
2. Out of every 100, 000 per-
sons in the first group, sixty-
four died of tuberculosis
annually. In the third and
largest group, the rate was 333.
3. In the first group, less
than five per cent of the
population were unabie to read
and write. In the"under-
developed"countries, the it-
literacy rate averaged 78 per
cent. Eighty per cent of the
world's literate people lived in
countries which made up only
40 per cent of the world's
population.
4. It has been estimated
that a man needs a diet cont-
aining 1, 800 calor'es as a vital
minimum for life. In the first
group, the average food supply
was 3. 000 calories ; in the last
it was 2, 150 calories, a slim
margin against poor harvests
or insect plagues.
Hunger And Ignorance
THE shortage of doctors andteac ers was greatest in
the regions where they
were most needed. In the
relatively healthy countries ofthe first group, there was
more than one physician for
every 1, 000 persons. In the
last group, there was only one
for every 6, 000. The countries
with less than five per cent of
illiteracy had almost four
elementary schoolteachers for
every 1. 000 persons. Those
where illiteracy was as high
as 90 per cent had less than
two elementary schoolteachers
for every 1, 000 persons-less
than half.
In food production, the story
was similar. The hungriest
peoples, partly through lack of
technical knowledge produced
the least food. In the first
group of countries, wheat
fields were as high as forty
bushels per acre in the period,
1935-39 ; in the third group,
the figure fell as low as eleven
bushels. Properly cultivated,
an acre of rice land was made
to yield-as a national aver-
age-seventy-six bushels, but
in countries where rice was
the staple diet, production fell
as low as twenty-six bushels.
Human Realities
MECHANICAL energy- the greatest liberator
of man from drudgery-
was developed in few countries
and was pitifully absent in
precisely the regions where it
was most needed. In the first
group, the average person had
26. 6 horse-power hours a day
at his command ; in the last,
he had 1. 2.
These facts and figures-
horsepower hours, teachers per
1, 000 persons, bushels per
acre, life expectancy-con-
tribute to a definition of
under-development. But the
human realities are more
eloquent. A phrase like"life-
expectancy"has echoes of
tragedy in a nation which,
while trying to increase its
standard of living, finds that
disease carries off its popula-
THE CHILDREN WHO WAIT-AND HOPE. These
children are symbolic of hundreds of millions of human
beings who, in misery and suffering, wait and hope for
the chance of a new life. Most of them are to be found
in the"under-developed"areas, where two thirds of the
world's population live and where poverty, malnutrition
and starvation, disease and ignorance are the common
condition. Today, their hope lies in the promise offered
by the United Nations Expanded Programme of Techni-
cal Assistance-the first great international attack on
poverty and its related Ills.
tion."Teachers per 1, 000" is
a very immediate problem to a
young nation building for the
future."Horsepower hours"
translate into money for
development or the lack of it.
All these conditions continue
to exist now. But what is
new and encouraging is the
fact that they have now been
recognized as a world problem
which requires a world solution.

These simple sentences are statements of fact, however.
only if an individual or a community has the money to pay
for the services, and if the persons with the right qualifications
to perform them can be found. For a whole country, the money
needed may amount to millions of dollars or pounds. The
persons with the proper training and education may be
thousands of miles away. A rich country can get what and
who it needs, if not at home then abroad. But where can a
poor country find an expert on the newest technique in
insecticides or a man qualified to run a soil research laboratory
And how will he be paid ?
One important form of mu-
lual technical assistance among
nations has already been
suecpssfully in operation either
on a Regional or on a bi-
lateral basis, through publie
and private agencies, and
increasingly through the United
Nations and a number of the
Specialized Agencies.
In December, 1948, the
United Nations General As-
sembly voted the modest sum
of $'288, 000 for technical
assistance, mainiy through
fellowships and expert advice.
In March of the following year.
the UN Economic and Social
Council instructed the Secre-
tax'-General to work out an
expanded programme of tech-
nical assistance.
Four Basic Conditions
TilE next step in the de-velopment of technical
assistance as a major
objective of the UN was a
report drawn up for the Council
by representatives of the UN's
8peeialized. Agencies. They
outlined an international
scheme for technical aid In
agriculture, transport, industry,
labour, education, finance,
health and welfare. And to
carry out the new programme,
the Council formulated a set of
operational conditions. These
points were emphasized :
l. It would be a Joint, co-
operation programme for ae-
sistance In economic develop-
ment, given only on the
request of the aountry eonMrn-
ed ;
2. The assistance would be
designed to increase productiv-
ity in fields where benefits
could be distributed to the
entire population ;
3. The government receiving
asslstanoe would assume part
of the costs ; (in practice as
high as 50 per cent) ;
4, The assistance would not be a
means of foreign political or
economic interference with the
domestlo affairs of the country,
receiving it.
The Council also created the
framework of the administra-
tive structure of the pro-
Tile delegate of Liberia--
I am authorized by my
Government to pledge the sum
of $8,000.
The delegate of Ceylon--
We regret that we cannot
ourselves make a very large
monetary contribution. My
Government has instructed me
to say that it will contribute a
sum in Ceylon currency equi-
valent to $15, 000.
Fifty Nations'Fund
THE money poured in - in-shillings, afgha is, pesos,
sucres. cruzeiros, dollars,
lempiras, dinars, ilorins,
pounds, francs, sols, rupees,
and other currencies-to
make the total of $20, 012, 500.
The majority of the nations
contributing were the very
ones which had the greatest
need for aid.
The 50 counlries pledging
funds were Afghanistan, Ar-
gentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma,
Canada, Ceylon. Chile, China,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt,
Salvador, Ethiopia, France,
Greece, Haiti, Honduras, India,
Indonesia, Iran, Israel Italy,
Korea, Lebanon, Liberia,
Luxembourg, Mexico, Monaco,
Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Pakistan Philippines.
Sweden, Switzer and, Syria,
Turkey, the United Kingdom,
the United States, Uruguay,
Venezuela, Yemen and Yugo-
slavia.
The money has now been
allocated to the United Nations
and its Specialized Agencies In
the following manner :

Unesco's share, therefore, is
$2, 300. 000 to cover technical
assistance activities for econo-
mic development, undertaken
by the Organization up to
December, 1951.
In July of 1950, the Technical
Assistance Board reported that
it had received requests from
fift. y-seven countries : some
under the normal programme
01 the UN and its agencies,
others under the expanded
technical assistance scheme.
ON MARCH 4, 1949, THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS adopted a
resolution requesting"... the Secretary-General in con-
sultation with the heads of the interested specialized
agencies... to prepare a report setting forth : 1. A compre-
hensive plan for an expanded co-operative programme
of technical assistance for economic development..."
Thus was the signal given for the preparation of the
vast programme which M. Trygve Lie, U. N. Secretary-
General, has described as"wnat should become and
can become one of the world's greatest achievements
for lasting peace and for the social progress and better
standards of life proclaimed in the Preamble to the Char-
ter of the United Nations."
gramme, is a manner designed
to avoid duplication and wasted
effort. It decided that the UN
would itself take care of
requests which did not fall
within the specific provinces of
its Specialized Agencies, such
a. s industrial development and
transport. And it proposd
the formation of a Technical
Assistance Board, made up of
representatives of the UN's
agencies, to co-ordinate the
programme.
The Council's proposals were
submitted to the fourth session
of the UN General Assembly.
They were unanimously ap-
proved on November 16, 1949.
Spirit Of Generosity
The next step was to financethe programme. The
Assembly asked contribu-
tions from the UN Member
States and they were given
generously at the United
Nations Technical Assistance
Conference held at Lake
Success in June, 1950. Fifty
nations not only reached the
conference's goal of $20, 000, 000,
but exceeded It by another
$12, 500.
The conference had the
atmosphere of an international
competition in generosity. This
started when the United
States pledged $10, 000, 000 if
other contributions totalled
$., 000, 000. Then the American
delegate offered to raise the
United States'share to
$12, 500, 000 provided that it
amount, at that sum, to not
more than 60 per cent of the
total reached.
The responses of other dele-
gates marched the American
spirit.
The delegate from Venezuela
-. My Government is prepared
to raise its contribution to a
totat of $44,000, 000, an increase of
$4, 000 over the amount pre-
viously pledged.
The delegate of the United
Kingdom-H'e regard it as
important that than figure
($20, 000, 000) be reached. We
propose to increase the United
Kingdom contl'ibution to
$. 760, 00, that is, an additionat
$28, 000.
The delegate of the Nether-
lands-Two days ago our
delegation ptedged 1, 500, 000
Dutch guilders. Now we find
that it is only $396, 000. We
should like to raise this $4, 000
to make the $400, 000 1'Ound
figure and help in altaining
the $400, 000 round figure and
help in attaining the $20, 000, 000.
