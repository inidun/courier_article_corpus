AT various times, every country has been the scene of fierce contro-
versy over the freedom of creative-artists and the difficulties they
meet in their work. T  ascertain what measure of fre dom exists
for artists today, Unesco sent a detailed questionnaire to writers,
painters, dancers, musicians, actors, sculptor. and scenario writers
living in its Member States.
The replies it received were later used as the basis for studies and discus-
sions by a committee of experts which met in Unesco House, last February.
This committee had as its members, M. Castrol Lea). Mexican Delegate to
Unesco (chairman). George Auric, the French composer, Gino Severini,
the Italian painter and critic, Philip James. of the Arts Council of Great
Britain, Krishna Hebber, the Indian poet and Frederik Prokosh, the American
writer.
After discussing the replies to the questionnaire, some of which are
included in the articles on this page, these experts framed a series of re-
commendations for improving the material and moral freedom of artists
and a draft Artists'Charter, for submission to Unesco's General Confe-
rence which meets in Florence next month.
Wherever it has been necessary to designate or identify a country,
it must be understood that the artists concerned are speaking of
their own countries. These statements do not imply that the artist
is less free in these countries than in others. What is important is
that some, perhaps even most of the comments may apply to the
country in which you are reading this story.
