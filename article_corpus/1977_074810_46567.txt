relations among news agen¬
cies, is more important today
than ever before.
In recent years, news exchange has
become accepted practice for most
news agencies in the non-aligned
world. January 1977 marked the
second anniversary of the creation
of the system known as the "Pool"
multichannel flow of news reports
and information between these
agencies.
The idea of the Pool grew out of
the awareness that the circulation
of news reports and information about
and among the non-aligned coun¬
tries was insufficient and lagging far
behind the relations developing
among them at the political and
economic levels.
Current efforts to build a new inter¬
national economic order inevitably
stimulated initiatives for change in
the structure of information, which
for decades had been based on a
one-way flow of news from the deve¬
loped to the developing countries
under the influence of a small number
of news agency giants in the deve¬
loped world.
On the basis of recommendations
adopted at the Fourth Summit Confe¬
rence of Non-Aligned Countries held
in Algiers in 1973, bilateral exchanges
of views took place between the
news agencies of some ten non-
aligned countries concerning possi¬
bilities of joint action to change
the existing situation.

LIGIMED COUNTRIES
THEIR NEWS
' S*2*
Full agreement was reached and in
January 1975 the Yugoslav news
agency, Tanjug, launched the collec¬
tion and redistribution of news reports
among the non-aligned countries.
This was a modest start. Many
difficulties lay ahead, and some of
them persist even today. One of the
greatest is undoubtedly the low level
of development of national informa¬
tion media and a corresponding inad¬
equacy in their technical facilities.
Many of the countries which wel¬
comed this initiative with most
enthusiasm still face the problem
of how to ensure sufficiently speedy
reception and retransmission of daily
news reports from or to the regional
points of the Pool which redistribute
reports to the news agencies of the
other non-aligned countries.
Even in its early stages, however,
the exchange of news reports and
information among the news agencies
of the non-aligned countries provoked
an immediate reaction. At all sub¬
sequent meetings of the non-aligned
countries, it was given full support.
It was generally agreed that news
agency dispatches, when promptly
.transmitted and authentic in content,
are unsurpassed in immediacy and
effect as announcements of events as
they occur. Together with subse¬
quent news agency reports, they
make an instant and incisive impact
on public opinion.
The initial dispatch is the precursor
and often also the basis of articles,
commentaries, features and even
more extensive coverage. Therefore,
it is understandable that the major
international news agencies should
seek to maintain a world-wide pre¬
sence through high-speed, well-
presented news reports prepared with
enviable professionalism.
But it is equally understandable
that the non-aligned countries, most
of which committed themselves to
the development of their own infor¬
mation media at the height of theirs
struggles for liberation, ¡ndepen-r
19

>dence and emancipation, should wish
to make their voice heard. These
aspirations gave birth to the vision
of joint action which has now mate¬
rialized as the Pool.
The Pool was officially constituted
at the meeting of information mini¬
sters and news agency directors of
62 non-aligned countries held in
New Delhi in July 1976. At this
meeting, , the Pool's statute was
adopted and a co-ordination com¬
mittee formed. All the resolutions
of the meeting were endorsed a
month later by heads of State or
government at the Non-Aligned Sum¬
mit in Colombo (Sri Lanka).
The first meeting of the Pool co¬
ordination committee, held in Cairo
in January 1977, noted that more
than 40 news agencies in Africa, Asia.
Latin America and Europe were
already contributing actively to the
news flow of the Pool, and that since
1975, national news agencies had
been formed for the first time in
16 non-aligned countries. Five
news agencies were already function¬
ing as regional or multilateral col¬
lectors and redistributors of news
reports and information from other
agencies participating in the Pool.
FURTHERMORE, 1976 had seen
an exceptional number of inter¬
national gatherings in the infor¬
mation field which were of particular
importance to the non-aligned coun¬
tries. These meetings ranged from a
symposium on information in Tunis, a
seminar in Mexico, the New Delhi
conference, and an Arab-European
news agencies' meeting, to the
Unesco General Conference in Nai¬
robi, where information and especially
the non-aligned news agencies' Pool
were examined in detail.
At its Cairo meeting the co-ordina¬
tion committee was thus able to
assess that the Pool had rapidly deve¬
loped during 1976 and that this new
form of multilateral co-operation
among the non-aligned countries in
matters of information had made
great strides.
The Pool is a tangible example of
co-operation among equals, on a
voluntary and democratic basis.
From the outset, it was never con¬
ceived as a supra-national news
agency of the non-aligned countries.
We believe that it will help to
enhance mutual knowledge among
the non-aligned countries and to
reinforce their unity. We are also
fully aware that the non-aligned
movement is in no way a mono¬
lithic block, nor in any way subject to
the will of a single centre. It is a
movement marked by great diversity,
but also by strong, identical interests.
The manner in which the Pool
functions is the best proof of its
democratic basis. A news agency
is considered as a participant if it
transmits its selection of news
reports to one or more of the Pool's
collector-redistributor news agencies.
The process involved is simple.
Each participant agency transmits by
the means at its disposalteleprinter,
telex, airmailone or more of its
news reports daily to a Pool redistri¬
bution centre.
EACH agency selects which re¬
ports it will send to the Pool.
A redistributing news agency
translates the reports it receives into
languages in which it usually
transmits abroad, scrupulously res¬
pecting the substance of the news
received.
Tanjug, for example, redistributes a
six-hour daily total of news for the
Pool in French, English and Spanish.
Its average newscast for the Pool
contains between 30 and 40 items
from the news services of national
news agencies of the non-aligned
countries and also from Unesco and
the Office of Public Information of the
United Nations.
The constantly increasing number
of news agencies ready to function as
collector-distributors is particularly
encouraging. In addition to the five
agencies which had accepted this
responsibility up to the time of the
co-ordination committee meeting
in Cairo, nine more have expressed
their readiness to include Pool news
in their regular foreign newscasts.
This concrete form of co-operation
among the non-aligned is in no way
viewed as a challenge to or compe¬
tition with existing news reporting
systems. The Pool's function is to
fill the previously existing vacuum
in the international information sys¬
tem, and it is in this sense that it
becomes increasingly attractive.
If it is to develop, the Pool will
require the support and willingness
to co-operate expressed during the
Unesco General Conference in
Nairobi. The Pool's co-ordination
committee is in favour of using any
resources Unesco may make avail¬
able for its development, to provide
assistancein the first placeto the
least developed news agencies in
the non-aligned world, in other words,
to developing countries planning to
form their own national agencies.
Although the Pool and the agree¬
ments reached in New Delhi received
wide coverage in the press of many
countries, with favourable responses
and objective assessments, certain
of the mass media in the highly indu¬
strialized countries reacted with
unease, and attempted to belittle the
Pool and distort its true nature.
It was claimed that the non-
aligned countries were forming a
news agency with the intention of
imposing a monopoly and censorship
in the reporting of news in their coun¬
tries, that this was an attack on the
free flow of news and information,
and so on.
It is patently absurd to maintain
that the non-aligned countries intend
to create a monopoly in the news
agency world.
Even if they had the material, pro¬
fessional and technical capacities to
do so, this would be impossible,
because the entire force and attraction
of the policy of non-alignment lie in
its uncompromising fight against all
types of monopoly and domination.
The non-aligned countries are enga¬
ged in this form of co-operation as
part of their quest for ways of streng¬
thening their own information media
and promoting a better flow of
information so that public opinion in
their respective countries and beyond
may be better informed.
IF this is felt by some as a threat
to their interests and positions,
the cause is not in any design to
seek a confrontation with existing
highly developed systems, but rather
in the objective clash between differ¬
ing concepts: a clash which occurs,
furthermore, in many other domains
of political and economic relations
throughout the world.
The publication rate of items from
the Pool newscast is still modest, but
it is improving daily. The quality,
substance and presentation of the
material provided is also constantly
improving, while an increasing num¬
ber of news agencies of non-aligned
countries are actively participating
in the Pool.
Thus, the principle of the Pool,
widely accepted by the non-aligned
countries during the first two years
of its existence, is now becoming a
reality. Interest in the Pool has also
been shown by several news agencies
and other bodies concerned with
information outside the non-aligned
world, where the Pool is increasingly
making its presence felt in the mass
media.
It is obvious that a new dialogue
has begun in international communi¬
cation, and that the process of build¬
ing a new international information
system is under way. Difficulties
clearly lie ahead and change will not
be rapid, but the process which has
been initiated cannot be arrested or
reversed.
The best contribution to the quest
for the most widely acceptable solu¬
tions will be to continue the dialogue
among all those who have an interest
in the world of informationa dia¬
logue which must take place between
equals.
