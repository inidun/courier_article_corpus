3. The big city
syndrome

HAT can education do in
the face of the barrage of violence
that comes via the TV screen? In
Dr. Sherwood Washburn's opinion,
it is not doing very much. An out¬
spoken man who has had ample
opportunity to study violent behaviour
by young males outside the windows
of his university office at Berkeley,
California, Dr. Washburn declared:
"Animal behaviour studies show that
early environment is tremendously
important. Yet our education system
is the worst possible system. It
delays the start of education much
too long. Then it uses discipline
rather than play. It would be hard
to devise a worse system for educating
human beings. It is at the root of
many of our problems of aggres¬
siveness."
He gave equally short shrift to the
system of higher education that has
stirred such widespread student protest
in the United States and elsewhere.
"The trouble with universities is that
they are housing people who don't
want to be there," he said.
"Students come to universities
because they want a certificate for a
job, they want to find a mate or
because their parents are compens¬
ating for having treated them badly
in childhood. So students rebel in
universities because, perhaps, they
have no choice but to go there."
This tendency seemed to have a
parallel In a quite different society,
that of Baghdad. Crimes of violence
among students there, Dr. Kemal
noted, are highest in the case of
students whose parents live in the city
itself. His explanation was that
students who come from outside the
city have more purpose and less luxury
in their lives.
Soon, it became obvious at the
meeting that there were similarities
between two apparently unlinked
examples of modern aggressive be
haviour: student protests and violent
crime in the cities. Both might be
correlated to some extent with over¬
population. The big university of
today, the so-called multiversity, is a
city. Dr. Hamburg observed that the
earliest known city was Ur in the Near
East. Archaelogists have estimated
its population at 40,000 just half the
enrolment of the University of Cali¬
fornia.
The mention of urban violence
opened a Pandora's box that the
meeting never really closed because
no one yet knows how. There was
even disagreement over whether cities
are more violent than they used to be.
Dr. Tiger said they aren't and claimed
that high crime rates now exist simply
because many incidents ignored in the
past are reported today, particularly
when they involve more prosperous
citizens.
Dr. John Gunn, a British forensic
psychiatrist who was at the meeting
as an observer, warned of the danger
of using crude crime statistics to reach
precise scientific conclusions. He
also added a question mark to findings
by ethologists that animals are most
aggressive of all to strangers. Humans,
he reminded the experts, are even
more aggressive to their kin and there
is nothing that policemen dread more
than being called to intervene in a
violent family quarrel.
In the developing world, the problem
takes on a different cast. Violent
crime in Baghdad, Dr. Kemal pointed
out, is highest among new migrants
from rural areas who make up half the
city's population of two million.
Among the newcomers, the crime rate
is lowest for those who are living
in neighbourhoods with other city
dwellers rather than in settlements
composed mainly of migrants.
The same story was told by Dr.
Shib K. Mitra of the psychology depart¬
ment of the University College of
Science in Calcutta. Crime is up In
his city, too, and he attributed this to
the anonymity of its crowds. "In a
big city, a person from a village loses
his niche. These are the people that
become lost souls."
One reason why they do was ad¬
vanced by Dr. D. B. Lubis of the psy¬
chiatry department of the Faculty of
Medicine at the University of Indonesia.
He remarked that, in a country like his,
the big city is a centre of Western
culture. When the farmer pulls up
stakes and moves to Jakarta, he is not
only going from the country to the city
but to an entirely new culture as well.
This does not only happen to
country people. Cities today are
changing so fast that even their native
sons are left bewildered and disorient¬
ed. Dr. Delgado told of the urban
renewal programme that has been car¬
ried out in New Haven, the home of
Yale University. "The city is now
beautiful and modern but I feel as if
my personal identity is lost. I don't
see colourful gypsies in the street any
more, I don't see the old Negro church
with its piano banging. My whole
history has been stolen."
^B^r F course, there are cities'
and cities. Dr. Kun stuck to his guns to
defend his beloved Budapest where, he
said, the rate of violent crime is
much lower than in remote rural vil¬
lages of Hungary. Dr. Hamburg then
suggested that some research on the
optimum size of cities could be very
useful. He observed that we are as
ill-adapted to the urban as we are to
the industrial civilization. No society
was urbanized before 1800 when only
2.2 per cent of Europe's population
was living in cities. Even as recently
as 1900, only one country, Great
Britain, could have been called urban¬
ized. "We have gone from a situation

Nobody regularly reading a
newspaper or watching television
in Europe or North America nesds
to remind himself of the place of
violence in modern society the
media do that for him daily.
Equally, nobody working in the
media can be unaware of a growing
suspicion that the media might be in
part responsible for the violence
they portray there have been
enough commissions of enquiry
and letters from the public to
make that clear. But suspicion is
not so far based on any generally
applicable scientific findings and
there is deadlock between those
who accuse the media of creating a
demand through their supply of
violence and those who cry
"censorship" and warn that the
media must not be made a
scapegoat for conditions society is
unable or unwilling to do anything
about. As this issue of the "Unesco
Courier" went to press, Unesco
was attempting to review the
present state of knowledge on this
problem and to seek practical
proposals for action through a
symposium on "The Impact of
Violence in the Mass Media" at
its Paris headquarters. Participants
from 20 countries will tackle
such fundamental questions as the
definition of violence, whether it
can be said to be increasing and
whether attitudes have changed
towards it, as well as exploring the
difference in impact between the
message on the screen, the printed
page and in the comic strip, the
varying effects of violence in fiction
and news and the responsibility
of the mass media.

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S AGGRESSIVENESS (Continued)
of no one In cities to the present trend
of everyone in cities."
Some work has already been done to
try to determine if big cities really
make humans behave inhumanly. Dr.
Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford University
researcher, bought two cars. He left
each out in the street for nearly three
days with its hood open and its licence
plates removed, one in front of Stan¬
ford at Palo Alto, California, and the
other next to New York University in
lower Manhattan.
At Palo Alto, a town of about 50,000,
nothing happened to the car. When a
rainstorm broke, some kind passers-
by pushed it under cover. In New
York, Dr. Zimbardo's watchers found,
the car was in the street no more than
seven minutes before it was damaged.
By the end of the experiment, it was
nothing but a stripped and battered
hulk. Most of the damage had been
done in daylight and by well-dressed
members of the white middle class.
The explanation can be found in the
anonymity of the big city. The New
Yorkers who damaged the car felt
that they did not know the owner and
that they would never see any of the
other passers-by again.
In another experiment mentioned
by Dr. Hamburg, four students rang
peoples' doorbells to ask if they could
use the phone. They conducted their
test in New York and in a town of
60,000 nearby. Their chances of ent¬
ering an apartment were five times
higher in the small town. In New
York 75 per cent of the people whose
bells they rang shouted through closed
doors or peered through peepholes.
In the small town, 75 per cent opened
their doors.
"We must remember that cities do
crowd strangers," Dr. Hamburg re¬
marked. "Every day, people come into
contact with strangers whom they will
never see again and with whom they
compete for a short supply of every¬
thing from parking spaces to sexual
partners."
How and why these findings by
ethologists, anthropologists, psycholo¬
gists all representatives of the na¬
tural sciences can be applied to the
actual world was the concern of Dr.
Nicolas Kovalsky from the U.S.S.R.,
deputy-director of the Institute of the
International Labour Movement, in
Moscow. Dr. Kovalsky wanted more
emphasis on the social factors behind
aggressiveness which he divided into
three categories, respectively involving
individuals, national societies and the
international world. He warned, too,
about the dangers of being too biolog¬
ical in one's approach to the problem.
