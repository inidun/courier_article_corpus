“ E nvironmental protection”has a special
meaning in space. A bolt or a nail trave l l i n g
faster than a bullet at 75,000 kilometres an
hour can seriously damage an expensive tele-
c o m m u n i c ations sat e l l i t e .An estimated two
million kilos of junk are already in orbit, w i t h
about 110,000 objects between one and 10
centimetres and another 8,500 fragments
e ven bigger.And these numbers are expected
to gr ow exponentially. In 10 ye a rs ’ time 1,000
s atellites will be orbiting the eart h , up from
600 circulating today.
An orbiting junkyard
Yet the space debris problem may prove
r e l at i vely easy to resolve because it directly
c o n c e rns major powe rs with the biggest
i nvestments in  space hardware like the
U. S . , Russia and France. “ We ’ ve already
had at least one major accident, when a
piece of debris hit the French sat e l l i t e ,
C e ri s e ,” s ays Dr. K a i - U we Schrogl, a law ye r
with the German Aerospace Centre.The
accident didn’t cause too much of a legal
ruckus, though, because the “guilty” frag-
ment was ori ginally from a French launcher.
“But just imagine if that debris had come
from a Russian or Chinese launcher.”
While there is some mention of env i r o n-
mental protection in two of the three UN
c o nventions gove rning space activities (see
b ox page 13),there are no binding rules desi-
gned to limit debri s. “The United Stat e s
d o e s n ’t want anything resembling intern a-
tional regulat i o n s ,” s ays Schrogl, but many
other countries are pushing for a UN agr e e-
ment on the issue. I r o n i c a l l y, the U. S . is the
only country with national regulations concer-
ning space junk and, s ays Shrogl, the U. S .
g ove rnment is now in the process of streng-
thening these laws which are expensive to
i m p l e m e n t . It costs much more to build a
s atellite that doesn’t shed its spent rocket
b o o s t e rs than one that does.“When cheaper,
more polluting launchers developed by other
c o u n t ries begin to reduce A m e ri c a ’s com-
p e t i t i ve edge,we will find a U. S .a d m i n i s t r a-

Send up a sat e l l i t e , haul an asteroid onto
it and ship it to the earth . . . .This may
sound like science fic t i o n , but it’s on the
agenda of an A m e rican industrialist bent on
being the wo r l d ’s first proud owner of a celes-

cost? How do things stand legally, f o r
example? According to intern ational space

But if he manages to get his asteroid down to

body and space law wo n ’t apply.

commercial possibilities in space, a Pa n d o-

b e gi n s. So while an aircraft registered in one
c o u n t ry needs permission to fly through
another country ’s airs p a c e , the situat i o n
would be less clear for a microwave - p owe r e d
reconnaissance device which is being deve-
loped to fly about 30 kilometres overhead and
is neither a satellite nor an aircraft.
Issues like this will take centre stage at
the upcoming Third United Nations Confe-
rence on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space (UNISPAC E ) , which will be
held in Vienna,Austria, in July. Represen-
tatives from 185 states as well as industrial
l e a d e rs in the field will be attending the
c o n f e r e n c e , the most important intern a-
tional meeting on space affa i rs held this
decade.The decisions arising from UNIS-
PACE will shape the way we envision and
use outer space.Three major issues in par-
ticular will dominate the legal discussions:

r e g u l ations set in a non-gove rnmental foru m
where they can do what they like. But they’ll
e ventually be forced to go to the United
N at i o n s.”
The issue of liability is highlighting a
major gap in existing international space
law. All the major agreements in this field
were negotiated during the Cold Wa r ,w h e n
states were the sole actors in space.Today,
p ri vate companies are increasingly invo l ve d
in the constru c t i o n , launch and operation of
space objects.Yet there is no formal licen-
sing system.As Shrogl describes the situa-
t i o n ,i t ’s as if countries have failed to set up
a driving licence system for space traffic, t h e-
reby setting the stage for intern ational col-
lisions.
Consider the case of the new Sea Launch
C o m p a ny which is launching satellites from
the high seas beyond the bounds of nat i o n a l
j u risdiction and therefore beyond the control
of gove rn m e n t s.The consortium is regi s t e r e d
in the Cayman Islands and consists of four
p a rt n e rs : N o r we gi a n s , R u s s i a n s , U k r a i-
nians—each owning about 20 per cent—
and the A m e rican company Boeing, w h i c h
owns 40 per cent. C o m p l i c ating mat t e rs
f u rt h e r , the ship and plat f o rm used for the
launches are registered in Liberi a .W h at if a
failed launch accidentally drops a rocket on
a fifth country? Which gove rnment will be
held responsible for ensuring that the com-
p a ny pays the damages?
A condominium in space
In the case of Sea Launch, the United
S t ates unilaterally decided to assume res-
ponsibility for political and economic rea-
s o n s , s ays Dr. Frans von der Dunk, c o -
director of the Intern ational Institute of A i r
and Space Law at the Unive rsity of Leiden,
in the Netherlands.“If Boeing was allowe d
to circumvent U. S . j u ri s d i c t i o n , it could
offer launches to China and other coun-
t ri e s ,” s ays von der Dunk, who explains that
a substantial amount of technical know-
ledge is passed on in the process of fitting a
s atellite into a launcher—a sensitive point for
the U. S .While a solution was found for Sea
L a u n c h , the bottom line remains, s ays vo n
der Dunk: “the law has to come to gri p s
with the complexities of the bu s i n e s s.”P r e s-
sure is beginning to build up within the
United Nations Committee on the Pe a c e f u l
Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) to
d e velop an intern ational agreement or at
least a set of guidelines to resolve questions
of responsibility and liability.
Intellectual property is also likely to
attract a lot of attention at UNISPAC E ,
especially in light of preparations to launch
the Intern ational Space Station (ISS). A
project involving 16 countries, the station
will be the largest and most complex stru c-

ture ever placed in orbit. A rr ays of solar
panels with a total surface of half an acre will
be connected up to a column the length of
a football field comprising a series of round
modules where a crew of seven will live
and conduct scientific experi m e n t s. O ver 40
space flights will be needed to deliver and
assemble the components of the stat i o n ,
which will weigh about 460 tons.The ISS is
scheduled for completion in the year 2004.
“ I t ’s essentially a marriage of conve-
n i e n c e ,” s ays Dr. Ram Jakhu of the Institute
of Air and Space Law at McGill Unive rs i t y
in Canada.The partner states are setting up
a kind of condominium, s h a ring the
expenses of communal services but retai-
ning control of their individual modules.
The stat i o n ’s law ye rs have had almost as dif-
ficult a time as the engineers.They’ve had
to iron out everything from visas and pos-
sible death cert i f i c ates for astronauts to
customs duties.Topping the list of techni-
calities has been intellectual property ri g h t s.
The ISS will provide an environment of
m i c r o gr av i t y, sometimes described as
“ we i g h t l e s s n e s s ” , giving researchers a
unique opportunity to study solids, l i q u i d s
and gases and the forces that affect them.
This may turn out to be a goldmine, since
scientists expect to make some phenomenal
breakthroughs in biotechnology, research on
c o m bustible and renewable fuels, p h a rm a-
ceuticals and the development of metal
a l l oys of unprecedented strength. P h a rm a-
ceutical companies are also whetting their
appetites. They have plans to grow in the
ISS ve ry pure and precisely ordered protein
c rystals which could be used to design new
strains of very effective drugs. Imagine the
s c e n a ri o, s ays Ja k h u , in which an Indian
scientist is allowed to conduct experi m e n t s
in Russia’s research module where he or she
discovers a cure for cancer.Who owns the
intellectual property rights? Now chances
are the two countries would broker some
kind of agreement ahead of time.But that
d o e s n ’t mean the Ja p a n e s e , for example,
c o u l d n ’t copy the experiment in their
module. Space is a free zone beyond the
bounds of terr e s t rial copyright laws and
bodies like the World Trade Organization.
“Should we try to apply traditional ru l e s ,
which are ve ry protective and nat i o n a l i s t i c,
or should we change the approach when the
i nvention contains a benefit for the whole of
mankind?” asks Prof . Maureen Williams,
space law expert at the Unive rsity of Buenos
A i r e s. “Obviously countries and compa-
nies investing astronomical sums should
be rewarded for their inve n t i o n s. But should
a formula with unive rsal benefits, like a
cure for flu, be licensed strictly on a com-
mercial basis or should there be prov i s i o n s
to make it accessible?” Here Williams is
e voking a major principle of space law
embodied in the Outer Space Convention
of 1967:“the exploration and use of outer
space . . . shall be carried out for the benefit
and in the interest of all countries, irrespective
of their degree of economic or scientific deve-
lopment. . . .”
The question of intellectual property ri g h t s
a rises in a particularly acute form in the case of
remote sensing, which has a wide range of appli-
cations, from monitoring deforestation to pre-
dicting mud-slides and improving agricultural
irrigation. It is also a somewhat elegant way of
r e f e rring to observation by sat e l l i t e .D u ring the
Cold War, most countries tacitly accepted the
fact that they were being watched or “sensed”
but this “ g e n t l e m a n ’s agr e e m e n t ” is coming
under increasing strain for two reasons.To begi n
w i t h , the technology has dramatically improve d .
The old remote sensing systems only had a
resolution of 30 metres or larger—referring to
the amount of detail, or land area, t h at could be
seen.The latest systems offer resolution of just
one metre. Until a few ye a rs ago, these adva n c e d
systems were basically in the hands of national
intelligence communities in the U. S . , R u s s i a
and a handful of other countri e s.The technology
‘Obviously countries and companies investing astro n o m i c a l
sums should be re w a rded for their inventions. But should a
formula with universal benefit s, l i ke a cure for flu , be licensed
strictly on a commercial basis or should there be provisions to
m a ke it accessible?’

is now making its way into the commercial
s e c t o r , and companies are selling the infor-
mation they acquire to the highest bidder.
“There is particular concern that terrorist
groups will be able to get their hands on
detailed inform ation about potential tar-
gets that they never had access to before,”
says Stephen Doyle,a former deputy head
of intern ational affa i rs with the U. S .
N ational Aeronautical and Space A d m i-
nistration (NASA).“The groups could go
through third parties to buy the data and
no-one would be able to trace them.”
For 10 ye a rs , d e veloping countries have
been calling for rules to regulate remote sen-
sing which they see as an infringement of
their national sove r e i g n t y.With high-resolu-
tion images,a company like Shell can explore
a developing country ’s oil resources without
e ven setting foot on its terri t o ry.As things stand,
a company can take pictures of a country ’s
n atural resources without the country ’s consent
and is under no obligation to share that infor-
m at i o n .The company “ ow n s ”t h at data and is
therefore free to sell it at any pri c e .The most the
c o u n t ry of ori gin can hope to do is buy the
rights to the dat a . If not, t h at country may we l l
find itself in a situation in which another com-
p a ny or gove rnment that did buy the data has
a better understanding of their resources than
they do.
“This is a highly sensitive and political
issue,” says Williams. Although the UN has
adopted a series of principles to ensure fair
access to remote sensing dat a , the fact remains
that countries being sensed have no right to
p rior consent, nor do they have a preferential
right to access the data.
Uses and abuses
of remote sensing
“We haven’t got a very good deal, to say
the least,” s ays Dr. José Monserr at Filho,
vice-president of the Brazilian Society of
Aerospace Law. “We [developing countries]
need a legally binding agreement to regulat e
remote sensing. O b v i o u s l y, g ove rnments and
e n t e rp rises from industrialized countri e s
d o n ’t see the need for a new agr e e m e n t .T h e y
prefer customary law ” and vo l u n t a ry codes or
p rinciples which, s ays Filho,“just maintain the
status quo.”
“ You must be practical,” wa rns He Qizhi,
legal adviser on space affairs to the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “If you set too
high a goal, you achieve nothing.” Instead of
pushing for a legally binding conve n t i o n ,H e
is hoping to see “softer instru m e n t s ” l i k e
d e c l a r ations and resolutions designed not
only to limit abuses of remote sensing but to
extend its benefits. “This could be a ve ry
p owerful tool for improving the env i r o n m e n t
and saving lives, particularly in developing
countries. . . .The principles for this co-ope-
r ation and fair access are in the existing
c o nventions but they’re just not clear or
c o n s p i c u o u s.” He is hoping that UNISPAC E
will spotlight the need for co-operat i o n
through declarations or principles which may
l ater pave the way for regional or bilat e r a l
agreements.
As one positive step, Shrogl points to a
new European Union policy providing scien-
tists with access to remote sensing data while
still permitting its commercial sale. “We’re
going to see national and regional legi s l at i o n
n e g o t i ated on an ad hoc basis,” he say s ,“ bu t
we ’re not going to see something like the
Law of the Sea. . . . The question is how to
organize intern ational co-operat i o n , not force
it.” n
