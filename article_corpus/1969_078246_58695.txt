OF ANTS
AND MEN
by Sir James Gray
lAN's position in the world
of Nature is brought most sharply into
focus by the concept of natural evolu¬
tion. Cosmic, biological and human
evolution can be regarded as phases
in a continuous natural process and,
from this point of view, astronomy,
geology, biology, archaeology and
history form a continuous spectrum of
knowledge. To pass through many mil¬
lions of years from a primaeval nebula
to modern man without any sudden
break in continuity of thought gives a
feeling of intellectual tidiness, but quite
apart from this it enables us to vis¬
ualize Man against the background
of his past and to regard him as
Nature's supreme masterpiece. At the
same time, he must not get too big
for his biological boots or tend to
exaggerate the gap between himself
and the rest of the animal kingdom.
No animal can manufacture aero¬
planes, or Asdic; but the prize for
aeronautics must go to the shear¬
water which navigated the Atlantic
without compass or chart, that for
Asdic to the ears and vocal cords of
our nearer relatives, the bats. By
surrounding themselves with an elec¬
tric field, some fish (e.g. Gymnarchus)
can, in total darkness, detect foreign
objects in the surrounding water with
very remarkable precision.
The total weight of the mechanism
involved including the animal's brain
amounts only to a few grammes;
a man-made instrument of comparable
performance would involve at least a
ton of highly complex electronic ma¬
chinery. Again, there is no labora¬
tory in the world which can compete
with the biochemical skill of even the
smallest living organism.
In fact, as delicate and precise
pieces of machinery, Man's inventions
so far compare very unfavourably with
those which have come into existence
during the natural course of biological
evolution. On the other hand, we may
fairly claim that we have accomplished
in a few centuries things for which
Nature required many millions of years.
Nevertheless, we need not be in the
least ashamed of the older members
of our evolutionary family; we have
still a great deal to learn from them.
So as to visualize Man's posi¬
tion in the animal world, let us de¬
fine his main diagnostic characters.
He is a highly gregarious bipedal mam¬
mal with unspecialized limbs but a
very large brain. He is the only ani¬
mal which has developed the sym¬
bolisms of speech and writing, and he
may well be the only animal capable
of rational thought. He Is, therefore,
the only organism which can hand on
patterns of acquired learning from: one
generation to another. To these ad¬
vantages he owes his dominant posi¬
tion in the world today.

HEY have enabled him to
exploit his environment and increase
his numbers and his range of distribu¬
tion far more quickly and far more
extensively than any animal of com¬
parable size. He has eliminated some
of his competitors and exploited others
for his own use, but the time has now
come when different races of men
are competing with each other within
the closed arena of a limited environ¬
ment, and it Is not easy to see where
it will end.
There is nothing equivalent to this
in the inanimate world; but, when a
biologist looks at the general trend
of events, he is inclined to say, "Where
have I seen something like this before,
what is it due to, and how does it
usually end?"
Nature has made, not one, but two
great experiments in the design of
social animals. The first was carried
out in Mèsozoic times when Man's
mammalian ancestors were beginning
to emerge from reptiles. The results
of this experiment are represented
today by the social insects notably
the ants.
There are a very large number of
different species of ants, none of
which interbreed; among them is found
a range of complexity of social be¬
haviour which is not only unique in
the animal kingdom but which forms
a very remarkable parallel to different
races of human beings.

7,000 kinds of ants are known.
Mason ants build skyscraper dwell¬
ings with wonderfully domed cham¬
bers and ceilings supported on
pillars.
Each ant colony is ruled by a
queen. The only duty of male
ants is to mate with the queen.
Only queens and males have
wings. All the other members
of the colony sterile female ants
are workers.

Ants practice many of the arts
and have most of the vices
of man. They are harvesters and
herdsmen and raise tiny insects
called aphids, which are milked
like cattle for the sweet honeydew
they secrete.
Each cotony has a highly orga¬
nized social system. Ant slaves
(prisoners of war) do the most
irksome jobs. Some slave-owning
ants have become so lazy that
when the colony moves house
they have to be carried by slaves.
Each group of worker ants has
its own special Job. The roadbuild-
ers are constantly at work, con¬
structing open and covered high¬
ways.
Down these roads the colony
migrates, accompanied by its cattle
and slaves, to take over new
territories, often waging war on
other ants in the process.
Ants are clever engineers. When
they reach a stream, a living
bridge of ants swings across over
which the whole column passes.
The job each ant will do is deter¬
mined from the time of its birth.

Ants are the result of Nature's
first great experiment in designing
social animals. Man came only
150 million years later. Has man,
as a social animal, progressed
much further than the ant?
February 1949
At one extreme are species forming
small communities, restricted to local¬
ized or specialized environments and
exhibiting relatively little subdivision
of labour between individuals.
At the other extreme are large and
often aggressive communities with
marked differentiation of structure bet¬
ween different grades of individuals;
populations of this type display high
levels of co-operative effort involving,
in some cases, the rudiments of agri¬
culture and husbandry:
In all cases, however, ant societies
are organized on a straightforward
totalitarian basis, the contribution made
by each individual towards the wel¬
fare of the community is determined
from the time of birth; each grade of
individual is structurally adapted for
predetermined tasks.
How far ants can communicate with
each other may be doubtful,, but it
is tolerably certain that members, of
the same community recognize each
other by a characteristic smell, and as
the brain of an ant is about the size
of the head of a pin, it is perhaps
not surprising that ants should attack
or kill an individual from another colony
with a smell slightly different to their
own. It is much less easy to under¬
stand why a man, with a brain of an
entirely different order of complexity,
should, at times, react almost equally
violently to skin pigments different
from his own.
Ants are also the only organisms
which apart from Man indulge in
organized warfare raiding the nests
of other species and incorporating
captives into their own societies. But
perhaps the most striking facts relate
to species which have changed their
habits and distribution within recent
times.
IWO instances of territorial
expansion are known to have occurred
in the last 150 years. Early in the
nineteenth century an Eastern species
(Pheidola megacephala), having spread
rapidly over North Africa and southern
Europe, managed to reach the islands
of Madeira and Bermuda; in both
places it exterminated the smaller
native races.
Meanwhile, a similar policy had
been carried out by another species
(Iridomyrmex humjlis), from the Argen¬
tine, which, having landed at New
Orleans, very rapidly overran the
southern United States; in due course,
it too reached Bermuda, where it pro¬
ceeded to eliminate the earlier invader.
In the world of ants there is no
place for small peaceful communities
unless they can isolate themselves
effectively from larger and more power¬
ful neighbours, nor does there seem
any lasting peace between large ag¬
gressive communities. Solomon's
advice has, I suspect, been misinter¬
preted. It should read: "Consider the
ants, and, if you use your intelligence,
you will see how not to deal with
international problems."
Having designed the ants, Nature
waited for about 150 million years be¬
fore embarking on her second or
human experiment. She waited, in
fact, until it could be carried out with
a species in which an individual's con¬
tribution to society was no longer
based on inherited structural char- s
acters but on the power of inter¬
communication with other individuals;
in other words, until Man's brain had
reached a level of development which
enabled him to control his environ¬
ment, and to deal rationally with the
subdivision of labour between indi¬
viduals and with the distribution of
natural resources between different
groups of individuals.
At the same time, she arranged that
such groups should not be physio¬
logically isolated from each other.
Different races of men can interbreed,
or they can, if they wish, come to
mutual agreement about the distribu¬
tion of world resources.
The first policy would seem to lead
to a world state with uniformity of
social pattern and of material interests;
the second involves territorial limita¬
tions and economic agreements. Both,
as we know only too well, involve
great practical difficulties. All the
same, men ought to be able to do
something better than ants.
