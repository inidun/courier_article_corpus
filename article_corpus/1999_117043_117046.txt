At firs t , the men seemed to be sufferi n g
from nothing more than a case of
i n flu e n z a : a bad headache,aching joints,
a feve r. But it quickly became clear that
dozens of Durba’s gold miners in the
D e m o c r atic Republic of the Congo were in
the grip of something far wo rs e .S o m e h ow,
late last year, they had come into contact
with a terrifying infectious agent that was
attacking all their internal organs, causing
them to bleed uncontrollably.
O ver the following months, over 60
m i n e rs died from the my s t e ry disease, t h e i r
limp bodies covered with blotches and
oozing blood even after deat h .Local doctors
had never seen anything like it. At firs t ,n o t
e ven seasoned experts from the Wo r l d
Health Organization (WHO) could say for
sure what was causing such appalling
deaths.
But many harboured the same suspi-
cion: that the miners had become infected
by a so-called emerging viru s : a tiny packet
of genes that had lain undisturbed in its
natural lair for years, perhaps millennia—
until humankind blundered into it.
The suspicion was that the my s t e ry
disease was caused by a so-called fil ov i ru s ,
a thread-like virus whose deva s t ating effect
on the human body had first been disco-
vered 30 years ago.
In 1967, dozens of people working in
l a b o r at o ries in Germ a ny and Yu g o s l avia fell
ill with eerily similar symptoms. S e ven died,
and many of the survivors suffered long-
t e rm effects ranging from impotence to
i n s a n i t y. The source of the infection wa s
traced to a batch of ve rvet monkeys
i m p o rted from Uganda, m a ny of which had
died during transportation.
The monkeys were found to be car-
rying a filov i ru s , which was duly named
after one of the German towns where the
first cases emerged: M a r bu r g .To this day, n o
cure has been found. If the victim’s immune
system cannot fight it, i t ’s over—a fate that
awaits over 50 per cent of those who become
infected.
Deadly pathogens—
do not disturb
In May, WHO confirmed eve ryo n e ’s
f e a rs : tests on blood samples taken from the
miners showed that they had indeed been
infected with Marburg virus. Soon reports
began to emerge of an outbreak of the same
disease among soldiers in Zimbabwe .T h o u-
sands of troops had been crossing into DRC
to support President Laurent Désiré Kabila
as he tried to put down a rebel uprising.
Fo rt u n at e l y, blood tests on three soldiers
suspected of carrying Marburg turned out
to be negat i ve , and by early summer the out-
break in Durba was ove r. The virus had
vanished again, back into its jungle haunts—
but precisely where, no one know s. S o m e w-
here out there, a creature—a species of bat ,
p e r h a p s , or a rodent—is unwittingly acting
as a refuge for Marburg.
W h at is clear is that the more incur-
sions into virgin terri t o ry humankind
m a k e s , the gr e ater the risk of another
encounter with Marburg—or perhaps some-
thing wo rs e . After decades of insouciant
use and abuse of the wo r l d ’s nat u r a l
r e s o u r c e s , from the primordial forests of
e q u at o rial A f rica to the oceans, the threat of
disturbing new and deadly pathogens now
has to be taken seriously.
The wa rning signs have long been clear.
As long ago as 1485,reports emerged of a
disease known as the Swe ating Sickness,
in which victims progressed from sudden
swe ating to prostration and death in just 24
h o u rs. It struck four more times before
vanishing again in 1551. But the country
affected was not some isolated jungle com-
munity in the tropics.The Sweating Sick-
ness wreaked its havoc in England, u l t i m a-
tely claiming the lives of around 20,000
p e o p l e — over 0.5 per cent of the total 
population.
Recent research has linked the emer-
gence of Sweating Sickness to a strikingly

Through an arrogant or ignorant disregard for ecological complexities, ceaseless human
encroachment on nature can unleash a terrible new threat of killer diseases carried by
microbes that have long lain undisturbed

woodland.

modern phenomenon: deforestation.The
timing and spread of the outbreak ties in
with the mass destruction of woodland in
S h r o p s h i r e , on the we s t e rn borders of
England.The suspicion is that forest wor-
k e rs somehow allowed the virus respon-
sible for the disease to spread beyond the
c r e ature that had acted as its host for count-
less generat i o n s , b ri n ging it into contact
with populations big enough to sustain an
epidemic.
This is a scenario that has been played
out again and again in our own times. In
Argentina after the Second World Wa r , va s t
areas of the Pampas were cleared with her-
bicide to make way for new crops. In the
p r o c e s s , the natural balance between a spe-
cies of field mouse and its predat o rs was dis-
t u r b e d , and the numbers of the form e r
soared—as did those of itinerant fa rm - wo r-
k e rs. By the early 1950s, people began to fa l l
prey to feve rs , vomiting and headache.
Some went on to suffer massive haemor-
r h a gi n g, and died hideous deat h s.The cause
was eventually traced to a previously unk-
n own viru s ,J u n i n ,c a rried by the field mice.
The same story was repeated in Bolivia,
where farmers keen to grow maize hacked
d own stretches of jungle near the Machupo
R i ve r. Sure enough, the reports of strange,
h o rrible deaths among fa rm - wo r k e rs start e d
to roll in, and their cause was traced to
another haemorrhagic virus, duly named
Machupo, again carried by field mice.
And early in 1999, evidence emerged to
link campaigns of deforestation to the rise
of the most notorious emergent disease of
them all: A i d s. In Fe b ru a ry, an intern a-
tional team of researchers published a paper
in the journal N at u r e t h at points to the
chimpanzee Pan troglodytes trog l o d y t e s as the
natural host of HIV-1, the lethal virus that
now infects over 30 million people world-
wide.
Killed for their meat by hunters hired by
timber companies, these apes are bu t c h e r e d

million people have died from A i d s , 80 per
cent of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
The dangers of an arrogant disregard for
the complexities of ecosystems may take
other forms than the destruction of virgin
territory. It was, for example, attempts at
r e f o r e s t ation in nort h - e a s t e rn A m e ri c a
d u ring the 19th century that led to the
recent emergence of Lyme Disease, a poten-
tially fatal bacterial infection affecting the
j o i n t s ,h e a rt and brain, passed to humans via
ticks carried by deer.
The deer came into contact with
humans following moves to rectify the
impact of deforestation caused by inten-
s i ve fa rm i n g . Local gove rnments launched

and created a landscape attractive to both

Lyme Disease.
With few natural predat o rs in the newly-
f o rmed ecosystem, the deer flo u ri s h e d ,a n d
increasingly came into contact with humans,
who were also flocking to the area,
entranced by its apparently “ n at u r a l ”
beauty. By the mid-1970s the first cases of
the tick-borne disease were being noted
among the inhabitants of Old Lyme,
Connecticut.
The same story has since been played
out in Europe, Asia and Australasia, and
tens of thousands of cases of Lyme Disease
are reported worldwide each year.
The return of TB, diphtheria,
cholera and malaria
The return of a number of old killer
diseases once thought vanquished also
s e rves to wa rn of the dangers of hubris and
complacency. Tuberculosis, all but elimi-
nated in the West following the advent of
decent housing and powerful dru g s , h a s

with over three million killed each ye a r
wo r l d w i d e .M a ny experts blame sloppy use
of antibiotics by We s t e rn doctors , w h i c h
has allowed mutant TB bacteria to survive
and create resistant strains. In developing
c o u n t ri e s , the Aids epidemic—which has left
tens of millions with no disease-fighting
immune system—caused the number of
TB cases to triple by the early 1990s.
Outbreaks of diphtheria, another bac-
t e rial disease of the lungs that especially
targets young children, were virtually unk-
nown in the last days of the former Soviet
U n i o n .Around 40,000 cases were report e d
in 1998, p ri m a rily among the poor and
homeless who flocked to major cities follo-
wing the collapse of the union, w h o s e
health-care systems had collapsed with it.
In the early 1990s,cholera returned to
haunt the A m e ricas after a century of
absence. Experts suspect this deadly bac-
t e rial gut disease was imported from Asia in
water flushed from the ballast tanks of
ships. At the turn of the century, virtually
no cases were known in the A m e ri c a s ;
t o d ay, around 60,000 cases are being repor-
ted each year. Globalization of commerce
h a s , it seems, gi ven us all too ready access to
rather more than just exotic produce from
faraway lands.
Yet of all the resurgent diseases, it is
m a l a ria that provides the most poignant
example of where ecological effects have
shattered the dream of complete eradica-
t i o n .The ori ginal optimism stemmed from
the introduction of DDT into developing
n at i o n s , to kill off the mosquitoes that carry
the parasite responsible for malaria.
Within ten ye a rs of its introduction after
the Second World War,DDT had saved an
e s t i m ated 5 million live s. In many countri e s ,
the impact was truly astonishing. In 1948
S ri Lanka had 2.8 million cases of malari a ;
by 1963, f o l l owing the introduction of
DDT, the number had fallen to just 17.
But by the late 1950s, evidence had
emerged suggesting that DDT’s pers i s t e n c e
in the soil and ability to creep up the food
chain was having a deadly effect on some
forms of wildlife.
Although some experts are beginning to
dispute the evidence—and especially its
relevance to the Third World—DDT now
faces a worldwide ban. The mosquitoes

D D T.Wo r l d w i d e , a staggering 400 million
cases are being reported each year, along
with almost two million deaths—90 per
cent of which take place in Africa.
In March 1999, Dr Gro Harlem
B ru n d t l a n d , the Director-General of  W H O,
singled out malaria as an example of a
pandemic killer likely to benefit from ano-
ther environmental threat : global wa rm i n g,
caused by man-made pollution trapping
more of the sun’s heat in the atmosphere.
Dr Brundtland pointed out that malari a
is now being reported in locations at higher
altitudes than in previous ye a rs , such as
the mountain plateaus of Kenya . W h i l e
admitting that there are likely to be va ri o u s
e x p l a n ations for the change, Dr Bru n d t-
land believes that one possibility is global
warming.
Rising sea-levels, caused largely by the
t h e rmal expansion of water dri ven by global
wa rm i n g, pose another threat , according to
Dr Brundtland.“If coastal protection sys-
tems are not strengthened, a 50-centimetre
rise in sea-level by 2100 would place 80
million people in danger of being flooded
more than once a ye a r , compared to 46 mil-
lion people under present climate and sea-
level conditions,” she says. “The displace-
ment of so many people to already
d e n s e l y - p o p u l ated delta areas and on popu-
lous island states would be bound to result
in outbreaks of diseases like diphtheria and

could also encourage the release of patho-

a 50-centimetre rise in sea-

present conditions.

people to already densely-
populated delta areas and on

gens into septic systems and waterways.”
But while the effects of global wa rm i n g
on sea levels have yet to make themselves
c l e a r ,f e a rs are already gr owing that the sea
m ay pose a more immediate—and insi-
dious—threat to health.
It stems from humankind’s insouciant
use of the wo r l d ’s oceans as gigantic sewe rs.
A 1993 World Bank report estimated that
around 30 per cent of humans have no
other waste disposal system than streams,
rivers—and the sea.
For years a case of “out of sight, out of
mind”, the dumping of so much waste in
coastal waters is now starting to have an
impact on health. V i ruses from human
diseases like polio and hepatitis have start e d
to be found in shellfish, while toxic algal
b l o o m s — vast colonies of simple, p at h o g e n -
packed organisms that thri ve on wa s t e -
d e ri ved nutrient—are becoming increa-
singly frequent along coastlines.
It is now becoming clear that the sea
is acting like a gigantic cold-store for
potentially deadly microbes like rotavirus,
responsible for severe diarr h o e a , and polio-
v i rus—and sometimes they emerge to cause
h avoc on the mainland. In December 1992,
thousands of people in Bangladesh fell
victim to cholera, f o l l owing an upwelling of

coast.
From deforestation to overpopulation,
mass migr ations to global transport , at m o s-
p h e ric to oceanic pollution: the reasons for
which new and resurgent diseases can and
do rise up to threaten humanity are legi o n .
But lessons are being learn e d . Some are
very basic and relatively simple to imple-
m e n t , such as the one-time-only use of
hy p o d e rmic needles. O t h e rs are equally
obvious but far harder to achieve, such as
making safe sex advice effective among
those at risk from sexually-transmitted
diseases like Aids.
Early detection
and rapid control measures
As with any threat ,e t e rnal vigilance for
new disease outbreaks is now being seen as
c ru c i a l . In its report on the outbreak of
plague in India in August 1994, the A l l -
India Institute of Medical Sciences wa rn e d
t h at such re-emerging infectious diseases are
a gr owing threat wo r l d - w i d e .“Early detec-
tion and rapid implementation of effective
control measures are essential,” the report ’s
a u t h o rs said, and duly called for the setting
up of national surveillance centres to act as
early-warning systems.
But the key message now emergi n g
from many of the recent outbreaks is a
blunt one: we must become far more
thoughtful in our dealings with the env i-
ronment and its delicate ecosystems. L o n g
dismissed by some as just a pious desidera-
tum, the cost of ignoring this simple mes-
sage could be nothing less than the needless
death of millions. n
