STARK PROFILE
OF WASTAGE IN EDUCATION
In order to get a picture of school drop-outs and repeaters in the world, Unesco undertook,
in 1969, a world-wide inquiry on this subject, carried out by its Office of Statistics. Spe¬
cial questionnaires were sent to 148 countries. The difficulties of this kind of global
research in education are shown by the fact that only 58 of the countries were able to
provide data complete enough for analysis. The results have been published in a detailed
report, "The Statistical Measurement of Educational Wastage", presented to the Inter¬
national Conference on Education, in Geneva, in 1970. Below Gabriel Cárceles Breis, of
Unesco's Office of Statistics, presents a brief analysis of these findings. Data in his ar¬
ticle relating to social disparities and access to education are taken from "Group Dispa¬
rities in Educational Participation and Achievement ", a 1970 report by the Organiza¬
tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) in Paris. A special Unesco
report on this subject, "The Social Background of Students and their Chance of Success
at School", was the main item of discussion at last year's International Conference on
Education, in Geneva (see page 4). The Unesco report points out that "because of varia¬
tions in educational systems and still more so because of differences in the way occupa¬
tions and social groups are defined for national purposes... statistics on this question
need to be used cautiously, and inter-country comparisons are to be avoided."

enormous efforts by educational
authorities in most countries of the world, access to basic
education is still far from universal in the developing
countries.
PRIMARY SCHOOLS
In 1967-68, nearly 70 per cent of children of primary school
age were enrolled in schools throughout the world. But
whereas in the industrially developed countries enrolment
reached nearly 100 per cent (North America 98 per cent,
Europe and the U.S.S.R. 97 per cent, Oceania 95 per cent),
in the developing countries it was much lower (70 per cent
in Latin America, 55 per cent in Asia and 40 per cent
in Africa).
Even more significant is the breakdown of the figures
of children who were not enrolled. Thus, taking the 6 to 12
age group during 1967-68 in various parts of Africa, we
find that 9 out of 10 children in Mauritania and 8 out of
10 in Mali and Chad were not enrolled, whereas in Algeria
and Botswana the proportion was only 5 out of 10 and
in Zambia 4 out of 10.
These figures refer to children enrolled, not to those
who attend school regularly. In some areas in the develop¬
ing countries, there is seen to be a big difference between
the number of children enrolled and the number actually
in class. Children very often drop out during the school
year to help their families, particularly with the crops
at harvest time.
In Latin America, 4 out of 10 children were not enrolled
in Salvador and Nicaragua, 3 out of 10 in Colombia,
the Dominican Republic and Peru, 2 out of 10 in Chile
and Mexico and 1 out of 10 in Argentina.
Figures available for Asia show that 9 out of 10 children
were not enrolled in Saudi Arabia, 5 out of 10 in Iran,
3 out of 10 in Thailand and Syria, whereas in Singapore
the figure was only 1 in 10 and in Japan 1 in 20.
SECONDARY SCHOOLS
The proportion of children of secondary school age
enrolled at all levels in 1967-68 throughout the world
was 40 per cent. The gap between the developed and
the developing countries was thus even greater than
for primary education. In North America 92 per cent of
secondary school age children were, enrolled, followed
by the U.S.S.R. and Europe with 65 per cent and Oceania
with 60 per cent. Then came Latin America with 35 per
cent, Asia with 30 per cent and Africa with 15 per cent.
REPEATERS
A very large number of children "fail to make progress
in school and sometimes spend several years in one
class repeating the work that they did in previous years.
These repeaters occupy places in schools and block
entry for others coming along behind them.
In 1967-68, the first grade of primary school was repeated
by 1 out of 2 children in Chad, Togo and Gabon, by 1 out

of the Congo, the Ivory Coast, Mali and Tunisia, by 1 out

Algeria.* The percentage of repeaters was even higher
in the last year of primary school which was repeated by
at least half the pupils enrolled in the above countries
with the exception of Algeria where only 2 out of 10
repeated.
In Latin America the number of repeaters is generally
lower but even so 1 out of 3 children repeat the first year
in the Dominican Republic and Uruguay, 1 out of 4 in
Colombia, El Salvador Guatemala, Panama and Paraguay,
and 1 out of 5 in Mexico and Venezuela. One pupil
out of 10 repeats the final year in Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador and Uruguay. In Mexico, Panama,
Paraguay and Venezuela the proportion is 1 out of 20.
In Asia during 1967-68, 2 out of 5 first year pupils were
repeating in the Khmer Rep., 1 out of 4 in Thailand and 1 out
of 6 in Iran. But fewer pupils repeat the final year : 1 out
of 4 in the Khmer Rep., 1 out of 6 in India and 1 out of 10
in Iran.
DROP-OUTS
A much more serious problem is the number of school
drop-outs. In some countries it reaches alarming pro-

portions in view of the relatively few children enrolled
in the first place.
In some countries drop-outs from primary education
amount to over 80 per cent of those who enrol. In a
country in which only 10 per cent of children between
the ages of 6 and 12 have been enrolled In school, it
means that only 2 per cent of children who should normally
have access to education pursue their studies to the
end of the primary school programme.
In Africa, of 100 pupils enrolled in 1960 in the. People's
Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon and Libya, 50 had
dropped out of school before the end of the primary cycle.
In Algeria, Burundi and Upper Volta, drop-outs numbered
60 out of 100, over 70 in Botswana, the Central African
Republic and Madagascar, and over 80 In Rwanda and
Chad.
During the same period in Latin America, 50 per cent
of children enrolled dropped out in Salvador and Panama,
over 60 per cent in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay and
Venezuela, and over 70 per cent in Colombia and
Guatemala.
In Asia, over 50 out of 100 school-children dropped out
in India and Quatar and over 60 out of 100 in the Khmer
Republic.
URBAN AND RURAL AREAS
The proportion of drop-outs in rural areas is much higher
than in urban zones. The following examples taken from
four Latin American countries for which comparative
statistics are available give a clear idea of the situation:
Percentage of drop-outs
Total Urban zones Rural areas
Colombia 72.7 52.7 96.3
Dominican Republic 69.6 48.1 86.1
Guatemala 74.7 50.4 96.5
Panama 37.7 19.3 54.7
It is clear that in predominantly farming communities the
chances of completing primary school are very small. As
a result, agricultural modernization is hindered and
migration to the towns may increase.
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES
Few studies have been made concerning social and
economic disparities in access to and participation and
success in secondary schools In the developing countries.
A study made by the Organization for Economic Co¬
operation and Development, in Paris (Background Study
No. 4, "Group Disparities in Educational Participation",
1970), shows, however, that In industrially developed
countries, a form of social selection appears to take place
during the transition from primary to secondary education
and, more noticeably, from secondary to higher education.
ACCESS TO SECONDARY EDUCATION
In the Netherlands, for example, the ratio of grammar
school admissions to 12-year-olds was found to vary
considerably among social classes. In 1960, 67 per cent
of upper stratum boys, 25 per cent of middle stratum
boys and 7 per cent of lower stratum boys were admitted.
The figures for girls were comparable but somewhat lower
at 63, 19 and 4 per cent respectively. Similar trends
were noted for England and Wales.
In France in 1963, 55 per cent of children who had
completed their primary schooling were admitted to
secondary education, as compared with only 30 per cent
in 1953. But the gap among social groups was still

quite substantial: 32 per cent of agricultural workers'
children (13 per cent in 1953), 45 per cent of workers'
children (21 per cent In 1953) and 94 per cent of children
of higher level employees and members of the liberal
professions (87 per cent in 1953) who had completed
primary schooling were admitted to secondary education.
Furthermore, dropping out from secondary education
was much more marked among children from the under¬
privileged classes. In 1963-64 in France, workers' children
represented 24 per cent of the school population at the
beginning of the secondary cycle, but only 12 per cent
at the end.
ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION
The same O.E.C.D. study shows a very wide disparity
in the social and economic background of students accord¬
ing to the country considered. A clearer idea of the pro¬
portion of students of working class origin entering higher
education is given by the graph on this page. But it should
be remembered that the definition of what constitutes
"the working class" may vary from country to country.
The table below shows the problem in another way.
Lower Stratum Upper Stratum
France 1964-65 27.1 629.0
Japan 1961 32.0 565.0
Netherlands 1961-62 10.6 359.0
Portugal 1963-64 5.3 440.0
Spain 1962-63 3.9 151.0
Yugoslavia 1960-61 66.0 465.0
It compares the number of students per 1,000 active
males in the 45-54 age group (in other words, the students'
fathers' generation) in the different social and economic
groups in six countries.
Further striking evidence of disparity becomes apparent
when the statistical chances of young persons from
different social backgrounds entering higher education are
compared. This can be done by comparing the ratios of
upper stratum and lower stratum students with the active
labour force, using the latter as a standard.
The O.E.C.D. study shows that lower stratum youths
In Yugoslavia (in 1965-66) had 1 chance of entering higher
education against 4 for those from the upper stratum: in
the United States (in 1958) the ratio was 1 to 5, in Norway
(in 1964-65) the ratio was 1 to 7. At the other extreme,
the ratio was 1 to 65 in Luxembourg (in 1964-65), 1 to 87
in Spain (in 1962-63), and 1 to 129 in Portugal (in 1963-64).
See table on page 22.
The report concludes that social differences In edu¬
cational participation are widespread. In the O.E.C.D.
countries at least, "the chances of being in school are
distinctly superior for those with higher social origins,
somewhat advantageous for those with 'middle class'
backgrounds, and inferior for those from the lower strata
or with agricultural backgrounds. Only the magnitude of
the difference varies among countries."
In short, says the report, social group differences in
educational participation appear to be a persistent
characteristic of educational structures in all O.E.C.D.
countries, and any change that is taking place is gradual
in the. extreme. m
