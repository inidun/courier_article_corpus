Even though the war
has subsided, the
humanitarian crisis 
in Afghanistan is 
far from over, and
the task of rebuilding
the war-ravaged
nation has hardly
begun. Little has
arrived of the $4.5
billion reconstruction
aid pledged to
Afghanistan in
January. Millions 
of Afghans continue
to live in squalid
poverty, and many
are getting impatient
- both with their 
own leaders and the
international
community that
supports them.

Afghanistan
How it is
The United Nations estimates 
1.5 million Afghans have died, two
million have been wounded and five
million more made refugees in
fighting that started in 1979 with the
Soviet invasion. From 1992, when the
Soviets withdrew, until 1996, rival
war- lords fought a civil war. The
chaos this caused allowed the Taliban
to take over until they were driven out
last December by U.S.-led forces.

How it was
Afghanistan has a long history of
invasion and instability. Its location
astride the land routes between Iran,
China, Central Asia and the south
Asian subcontinent has always 
enticed conquerors. One of the first
was Alexander the Great in the third
century BC. His successors created
wealthy kingdoms in Afghanistan that
bridged the civilizations of East and
West. In the early centuries of our era
Afghanistan was the centre of the 
vast Kushan empire which acted as
intermediary in trade between India,
China and Rome. The Kabul Valley
was birthplace of Gandharan art,
beautifully blending Greek stone-
carving skills with Buddhist themes,
while in the 15th century Herat, in
northwestern Afghanistan, was 
capital of the Timurid Empire and a
verdant centre of art and learning.
How did it get so bad? 
In the early 1970s Afghanistan was beset by serious economic
problems, including  long-term drought. Maintaining that King
Muhammad Zahir Khan had mishandled the economic crisis and
was stifling political reform, a group of young military officers
overthrew the monarchy in July 1973 and proclaimed a republic.
Lt. Gen. Muhammad Daoud Khan became president and prime
minister, but in 1978 was himself deposed by a group led by
Noor Mohammed Taraki, who aligned Afghanistan with the
Soviet Union. In the late 1970s the government faced increasing
popular opposition to its social policies, and by 1979 guerrilla
opposition forces, popularly called mujahedeen, were active in
much of the country. In September, 1979, Taraki was killed and
Hafizullah Amin took power. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet Union
sent troops into Afghanistan, Amin was executed, and the Soviet-
supported Babrak Karmal became president.
The People
Although the continuous state of war in Afghanistan from
1979 onwards has caused substantial population
displacement, regional ethnicity is still generally the same.
Tajiks live around Herat in the northwest, Uzbeks live in the
north, the nomadic Turkmen live in the Vakhan in the
northeast. In the central mountains are the Hazaras, of
Mongolian origin. In the east and south are the Pashtuns,
the country’s largest ethnic group  in a total populaion of
about 22 million. Pashto and  Dari (Afghan Persian), plus
various Turkic tongues, mainly Uzbek and Turkmen, are the
country’s principle languages. Almost all the inhabitants are
Muslim; the large majority are Sunni, the minority,
numbering over two million, Shiite.

Over
two decades of
conflict and
three years of
drought have devastated Afghanistan’s
agriculture, says the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). As
farming and related activities are the only
means of livelihood for some 85 percent
of the population, the country is being
kept alive by international food aid.
Delivering relief supplies to remote
regions on a reliable basis, however, is
difficult, and millions of Afghans – most
of them children, says the UN Children’s
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) – remain at
risk.
HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES
The Afghan government too is living
hand-to-mouth. To meet its running costs,
the government has received grants of 
as much as $10 million each from India,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, which officials carried
back in suitcases because there is no
banking system in Kabul.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees 
have been returning to Afghanistan each
week, putting the country’s shattered
infrastructure under even greater 
strain and stretching still further the
government’s meagre resources.
Thousands of unemployed crowd
ministries and United Nations offices
looking for jobs. Beggars have staked out
houses where foreigners live, and Afghans
holding university degrees work as 
drivers for foreign aid agencies. 
Many of Afghanistan’s towns and cities
are badly damaged, with only intermittent
running water and electricity. Parts of
Kabul lie buried beneath thousands of
tons of rubble. While in the countryside
The Future
The Loya Jirga, or grand council of tribal elders, meeting in
Kabul in June, elected Hamid Karzai, the aristocratic Pashtun
tribal leader as president of the Transitional Administration that
will lead Afghanistan until elections in 2004. Outside of Kabul,
however, the government’s writ does not run strong. Warlords,
whose private armies control huge swathes of the country, pose
perhaps the gravest danger to the fragile transitional
government.
The Great Game
For almost a century Afghanistan was a pawn in the ‘Great Game’ played by
European imperial powers as they vied for influence in Central Asia. Napoleon’s
intrigues in Persia prompted the British in India to first open official relations
with Kabul in 1809. Russia’s steady expansion southwards across Central Asia
deepened their concern. Acutely aware of Afghanistan’s age-old position as a
highway from Persia and Central Asia to India, the British took an active interest
in the seating and unseating of princes on the throne of Kabul during the
remainder of the 19th century. Twice this interest led to war: first in 1838-42, and
again in 1878-80. Attempting to free Afghanistan from British influence, King
Amanullah invaded India in 1919. This third Afghan War was ended by the Treaty
of Rawalpindi, which gave Afghanistan full independence.
Khyber Pass
Throughout history Afghanistan served as a springboard for the
conquest of the south Asian subcontinent, and the Khyber
Pass, which links the two, was the gateway through which
these invaders - Persians, Kushans, Turks, Timurids and
Moghuls - poured. In recent times it was the main escape route
for millions of refugees fleeing the fighting in Afghanistan.
Now it is the main artery for aid to Kabul.

roam 700,000 armed men who must be
persuaded to give up their guns with aid,
jobs and education. 
Like much else in Afghanistan,
however, the education system too is in
shambles. Although more than 1.5 million
children turned up at the start of the new
school year, many more are still caught in
displacement camps and refugee centers.
Meanwhile, more teachers have to be
selected and trained; textbooks printed,
school supplies bought and distributed to
meet the expected influx of children if
peace prevails.
HUGE LOGISTICAL
CHALLENGES
These are huge logistical challenges in a
country with a poor road network,
shattered infrastructure and a heavy
infestation of land mines. Close
cooperation between national and local
authorities, UN agencies and the myriad
of non-governmental agencies (NGOs) 
is needed. “At present there is too much
competition,” says Cindar Isasac,
programme officer for Focus, the
humanitarian arm of the Aga Khan
Development Network.  
At last count, there were 18 UN
Agencies, 83 international NGO’s, and 111
Afghan NGO’s active in Kabul.
Competition among NGOs for funding and
projects is fierce,while NGOs, which have
been operating in Afghanistan for many
years, accuse recently returned UN
agencies, who pulled out during the
fighting, of poaching their trained staff.
“Mending Afghanistan,” says UN
Development Programme (UNDP)
Administrator Mark Malloch Brown, “is a
task for all of us, a historic wrong to be
put right and an opportunity for
North/South solidarity,” Brown, who was
named by UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan to head the recovery effort in
Afghanistan, says developing countries, as
well as the rich, can play an important
role in the country’s reconstruction.

One of the few ancient monuments in
Afghanistan to survive the wrath of war, the
fury of the elements and acts of destruction
by the Taliban, is the Minaret of Jam. None
too soon, it has been placed on UNESCO’s
World Heritage List
The slender, tapering
minaret soars to a height
of 65 meters over the floor
of a remote valley in
western Afghanistan.
Modern scholars only
reached the site in 1957,
when discovery intact of
the enormous 12-century
brick tower caused a
sensation. It was a mystery
to architects how such a
structure stood for so long
in one of the world’s most
active earthquake zones.
And historians wondered
why it was the only
monument left standing by
Genghis Khan’s Mongol
hordes, who devastated
the region in 1221.
The Minaret of Jam is
the second tallest brick
tower in the world after the
Qutub Minar in New Delhi.
It is three-tiered and
decorated with a variety of
geometric and floral
patterned bands and
inscriptions in brick and
stucco. Located east of
Herat, the minaret stands
on the site of what may be
the capital of the Ghorid
Dynasty, which ruled
Afghanistan from 1148 to
1214. The site also includes
the ruins of a palace,
fortifications, and a
Jewish cemetery.
The Minaret of
Jam is one of over
60 towers, dating
from between the
early 11th and mid-
13th centuries, still
standing in Afghanistan,
Iran, and the Central Asian
Republics. The special
taste for towers in this
period, is ascribed to the
widespread recognition of
the form as an appropriate
symbol of the triumph of
Islam in the region. 
Some towers that
appear independent today
were once attached as
minarets to mosques built
of sun-dried brick that
have since disappeared.
Other towers, however,
were conceived as
independent, and also
served as landmarks to
guide caravans across the
landscape, or watchtowers
in times of war.
The most impressive 
of this latter type is
undoubtedly the Minaret
of Jam. Scholars speculate
that it was because of 
its usefulness as a
watchtower
that the Mongols spared it.
They also believe that
wooden beams inside the
brickwork may have
provided some of the
necessary tensile strength
for the tower to survive
earthquakes.
The minaret is now
threatened by water
seeping from the two
rivers at whose confluence
it stands, by vibrations
from a planned road-
building project nearby,
and continuing illegal
archaeological digs.
“It is vital that this
monument and the whole
archaeological site be
placed under constant
surveillance,” says
UNESCO consultant Prof.
Andrea Bruno of Italy,
who is also urging that
the proposed road route
be altered.

etracing this “trail” – which
centuries before was part of
the ancient Silk Road – we
sped out of Kabul one recent dawn on a
tour of Afghanistan’s five central
provinces within whose borders Asia’s
main overland trade routes once crossed.
Leaving the capital via the Koh Daman
Valley we passed hundreds of abandoned
villages, thousands of destroyed homes
and millions of withered vines. Crippled
tanks, burnt out trucks and twisted
artillery pieces littered the roadside, which
was lined by signs warning of landmines.
Koh Daman Valley was once one of the
richest and most beautiful valleys in the
country. It was noted mainly for its
vineyards, but almond, pear, apricot, fig
and cherry trees also flourished here. Not
any more. For this was the line of attack
on Kabul or – depending on which way

Driving through the
pulverized suburbs of
Kabul, across the
withered Afghan
plains and over the
war-debris-littered
passes of the Hindu
Kush, it is difficult to
imagine this

once was: a centre of
great empires, an
international
crossroads of culture
and commerce, and,
in more recent years,
a safe and peaceful
stopover on the Asian
“hippy trail.”
AFGHAN JOURNEY
UNESCO projects in Afghanistan range
from new initiatives to rebuild the
country’s education systems and academic
life to restoring historical monuments and
museums damaged by war. Some
question whether historic sites should be
a priority for rebuilding when so much of
modern Afghanistan is in ruins, However,
UNESCO’s Pakistan representative
Ingeborg Breines points out that: “In post-
conflict countries it is extremely important
that people are rallied by something that
can give them a national identity.”
Much of the magnificent remains of
Afghanistan’s past have, however, already
vanished, victims of either shelling,
systematic theft or illegal excavations.
Kabul Museum was looted, and many
archaeological sites, such as Hadda, Aï-
Khanoum and Tillia Tepe, were dug up
and their treasures sold abroad. Finally,
the decree of Taliban spiritual leader
Mullah Omar on February 26 last year
ordering “all non-Islamic statues and
tombs” to be destroyed, led to the much-
publicised demolition of the Bamiyan
Buddhas.
One of Afghanistan’s few ancient
legacies still intact is the Minaret of Jam
(see previous page). In June, the minaret
was placed on UNESCO’s list of historical
monuments that should be preserved as
part of the world’s cultural heritage. It is
the first Afghan site to be inscribed on the
World Heritage List, earlier efforts by the
Afghan government to get sites listed
having been cut short by war.

the war was going – retreat to the fastness
of the Hindu Kush. Today most the Koh
Daman Valley vines are dead and its
orchards destroyed; their fruit trees
stripped for firewood.
Because of its strategic location at the
southern base of the Hindu Kush the
once-fertile Begram plain, which we now
crossed, was in recent years another
virtual war zone. It guards passes through
mountain ranges fanning out from the
towering Hindu Kush across the centre of
the country. In ancient times these passes
were gateways to India, Bactria,  and
Central Asia, and Alexander the Great
built a city here, which the Kushans later
made capital of their vast empire. They
called it Kapisa.
The Begram plain is desolate today, but
in 1939 archeologists excavating the ruins
of Kapisa discovered a treasure trove
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
testifying to the existence here, nearly
2,000 years ago, of a highly refined and
cultured citizenry. In two small rooms in
the royal city were exquisite Indian ivories
and Chinese lacquers side by side with an
infinite variety of objects from the far-
flung reaches of the Roman Empire.
SIGNS OF CHANGE
Overlooking Kapisa is a low hill
celebrated in Muslim legend. It is said
that the Imam Hannifa Ghazni has lived
inside this hill, known as Reg Rawan or
Moving Sands, for the past one thousand
years and that one day he will emerge to
bring peace to the region. His failure to
appear during the recent years of of
conflict, said our guide, has somewhat
shaken his reputation.
Three important caravan routes from
China, India and Central Asia met at
Kapisa.  We took the one along the
Ghorband Valley, which once led to
Central Asia. In recent years, the valley
was a front line between the forces of the
Taliban and their oponents of the
Northern Alliance, and signs of fierce
fighting were frequent: burnt out
armoured cars, broken bridges, and more
abandoned homes.
There were signs too, however, that life
in the valley was slowly returning to
normal. It was early morning as we
climbed the stepped-sided valley, and
hundreds of children were hurrying to
school. Among them were groups of
laughing girls, many of them attending
classes for the first time in six years. “Its
the first time I’ve seen smiles on their
faces in years,” said Sean McQade, an
engineer with more than ten years work
experience in the region.
Crossing the Shibar Pass, we stopped at
Eljanak village where 60-year-old Hussain
Ali was rebuilding his house with the help
of his neighbours. The wooden beams
supporting the house had been removed
after Hussain and his family fled, causing
the roof to collapse and most of the mud
walls to cave in. A neighbouring house

The Silk Roads:
Roads of Dialogue
Long before the beginning
of East-West trade the
geographical traces that
later formed the Silk Road
were ancient pathways of
profit. An early urban
bronze-age civilization that
arose in northern
Afghanistan developed an
active caravan trade
linking the civilizations of
the Indus Valley and
Mesopotamia. The finest
lapis lazuli in the world
was brought west from the
Afghan highlands of
Badakhshan to Sumer and
Egypt 5,000 years ago by
this route. Later, ancient
Bactria, in northern
Afghanistan, was joined to
India by a 4,200-kilometer
road built by Indian’s
Maurya dynasty, and was
linked to Central Asia and
the Middle East by the
imperial highways of the
Persians.
The formal opening of
the Silk Road to China is
usually placed in the late
second century BC, when
Emperor Wu of the Han
Dynasty, expanded his
empire into Central Asia,
where his imperial routes
and agents connected with
the existing routes to
India, the Middle East and
Rome. The Kushans, a
dynasty of nomadic kings,
who, from their center in
Afghanistan, controlled a
vast empire reaching from
China to the Caspian Sea,
acted as intermediaries
between the Roman West
and the Chinese East,
issuing gold coins on the
model of Roman denarii
to facilitate trade. 
The extent of
international trade at this
period is best exemplified
by the discovery of the so-
called Begram Treasure,
found at Begram, the site
of one of the ancient
capitals of the Kushan
Empire, north of Kabul. It
contained Indian ivories,
Chinese lacquer-ware, and
a bronze statuette of a
deity from an eastern
province of the Roman
empire.
In the following
centuries, the names of
the leading actors changed
but the basic roles
remained the same. A final
dramatic chapter in the
history of the Silk Road
was written in the 14th
century by the Turco-
Mongol Timurids. Timur,
the dynasty’s founder,
known in the West as
Tamerlane, was one of the
most successful warriors
the world has ever known.
In a series of military
campaigns, he conquered
all of Eurasia from the
Great Wall of China to the
Urals. Trade revived, and
Herat, the capital of the
empire in the 15th and
16th centuries, became a
centre for painters and
craftsmen from all over
the Middle and Near East. 
Timur’s successors,
however, lacked the
authority of their ancestor,
and were unable to hold
together the vast steppe
empire he had created.
Tribes revolted and
political instability set in –
followed by economic
depression and cultural
decline. Weak and
disorganized, Central Asia
was no longer capable of
playing the role of
intermediary vital to
continued East-West trade. 
Meanwhile, in
1426, in an effort
to expunge long
years of foreign
influence and
resuscitate
traditional
Chinese values,
the Ming
Dynasty closed
China’s borders.
After 1,500 years
as a main artery
between East and West,
the Silk Road was finally
cut, preserving during the
following centuries only
the romance of its name
and the vague memory
that somehow, long ago, it
had been important.

From Eljanak village we drove down
the steep Shibar valley to Bamiyan. The
town is dominated from the north by high
sandstone cliffs in which are cut two
enormous niches. Now eerily empty they
once contained two of the world’s tallest
standing Buddhas (see page 48) –
demolished in 2001 by the Taliban. Today,
all that remains are forlorn piles of rubble
at the bottom of each niche covered by
UNESCO with protective fibreglass. 
Caves in the cliff face that once served
as cells for Buddhist monks are now
home for families from nearby villages
destroyed by Taliban forces. And at the
base of the cliff what was once a thriving
bazaar lies devastated by civil war. 
was blackened by fire but was relatively
intact. In fact, although most damage we
saw in urban areas was caused by
fighting, in rural areas it seemed to result
from the removal of wooden beams: the
only thing of value left in the house after
families fled.
Millions of refugees, who fled to
neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, and to a
lesser extent Tajikistan and Turkmenistan,
are now being urged to return home.
Many, however, have no homes to return
too, while others are deterred by
uncertainties.
“They want to be sure that when they
return they have food, water, and security.
Even though the refugee camps are
primitive they do have these here,” said
Shahnaz Akhtar of OCKENDEN
International, an NGO involved in
repatriation. Others, she said, are
reluctant to return because they are afraid
they won’t be able to get out again if
things turn sour.
UNESCO | the new Courier | October 2002
Bamiyan was once mainly populated by
Tajik, but they fled when Taliban forces,
who were mainly Pashtuns, occupied the
town. Later, Hazaras from surrounding
villages moved in. “There was a lot of
movement of refugees internally as well
as externally,” explained agriculturalist
Karim Dostyar, at whose aid outpost we
spent the night sleeping round a warming
stove. “And this is now causing tensions.”
FOOD FOR ALL!
Later we saw first hand what these
tensions were. Stopping off at Samangan,
so our translator could visit the home his
family fled to escape the fighting, we
found it occupied by complete strangers.
It was a tense meeting, and Afghan
officials acknowledge that reclaiming lost
assets could take years.
Driving through rivers where bridges
had been blown up to halt the enemy’s
advance, we reached Wadou. Here we
faced an impromptu assembly of angry
village elders, who crowded into the
house of a former commander who
invited us for tea. As we sat cross-legged
on cushions and sipped the sweet green
liquid they complained that although
neigbouring villages had received food aid
their village had not. 
At the next village – where sacks of
World Food Programme wheat were being
distributed from the back of a truck – we
discovered why. Wadou it seems had
accidentally fallen between two
distribution zones. Such administrative
mixups create tensions between villages,
which, although neighbouring frequently
belong to different ethnic, tribal of
religious groups.
At least most of the food aid now
seems to be getting through to the people
who deserve it. In the past, some 50
percent of it went to the warlords. Now, a
senior Afghan aid worker in Pol-i-Kumbri
told me, they get only ten percent. 
Dusk was falling as we drove into
the once bustling industrial centre of

Afghanistan
The Valley of Bamiyan lies
at the heart of the Hindu
Kush Mountains about 150
miles northwest of Kabul.
During the early centuries
of our era endless
caravans of luxury-laden
camels plodded along the
Silk Road, passing through
the valley. Later, Buddhist
monks joined these
caravans and a great
religious center burgeoned
in Bamiyan. 
About 400 AD the
pilgrim Fa Hsien came to
Bamiyan from China, and
described a sumptuous
assembly attended by
such large numbers of
monks that they came, it
seemed, «as if in clouds.» 
The great wonders at
Bamiyan were two
monumental Buddhas
carved into the face of the
sandstone cliff dominating
the town from the north.
The eldest of these two
statues, was 38 meters tall.
The other measured 55
meters.
Around and between
them a maze of cells and
sanctuaries were
painstakingly cut out, their
ceilings and walls
smoothed over with mud-
and-straw plaster and then
painted with inspirational
scenes. The Buddhas were
probably executed during
the 3rd to 4th centuries;
the murals mainly during
the 7th.
The encounter between
Buddhism and Islam did
not result in the immediate
decline of the monastries
of Bamiyan. Although the
local ruler embraced Islam
during the late 8th century,
Buddhism and Islam
existed side by side for at
least another hundred
years. By the 9th century,
however, Buddhism had
faded from the valley, to
be replaced by Islam.
The Buddhas continued
to survive invasions, for
another thousand years.
They could not, however,
survive the Taliban, which
last March, reduced them
to a pile of rubble.
UNESCO Director-
General Koïchiro Matsuura
said it was abominable to
witness the cold and
calculated destruction of
cultural properties that
were the heritage, not only
of the Afghan people, but
the whole world. “The
Buddhas of Bamiyan were
not inscribed on the World
Heritage List but deserved
to be and their destruction
represents a true cultural
crime. The loss is
irrevesible.”
The question of whether
to reconstruct the
destroyed giant Buddhas
of Bamiyan is very
controversial.
However, all involved are
agreed that the cliffs of
Bamiyan and the 600
caves and remains of the
mural paintings with
which they are decorated,
should be protected and
restored.
UNESCO proposes to
shore up the cliffs at
Bamiyan, conserve in situ
the remains of the statues,
and make archeological
test probes to find new
caves. A small museum
will also be created and
new excavations
undertaken to try and
locate a giant reclining
Buddha several hundred
meters long said to be
buried somewhere in the
Bamiyan Valley. The
$700,000 project will be
financed by Japan through
their Funds-in-Trust at
UNESCO.

A Crime Against Culture

Koh Daman and Kabul. 
Opened in November 1964, the 2.7 km
tunnel took six years to build. An
additional 5.4 km of galleries have been
constructed to keep the approaches free of
snow. Today the tunnel is in a dangerous
state of disrepair. Snow has gathered and
frozen in the damaged galleries reducing
traffic to one-way on alternate days – at
least in theory. On the day we drove
through it was coming from both
directions, causing total chaos.
Stalled at the mouth of the tunnel, aid
workers posed for photos on top of an
abandoned bulldozer, once used to clear
away the snow. We gave one of them a
ride, through the tunnel, down by the
Salang River and back to Kabul along
more roads littered with the endless
debris of war. As we approached the
capital, I asked our passenger, Deborah
Storie, a six-year veteran of the
International Assistance Mission (IAM) to
Afghanistan, for her impression of recent
developments.
“There is a veneer of change, but it
does not go very deep,” she said; which
seemed to sum up much of what I had
been told on our journey through this
devastated land.
Pul-i-Khumri, its cement and
textiles factories now largely
silent because of lack of spare
parts to mend broken plant,
and not enough raw cotton
to feed them. The factories
now employ only a fraction
of their former thousand-
strong workforce, and recent
returnees told us it was
pointless even going to ask for their old
jobs back; yet another source of tension
between those Afghans who stayed
and those who fled and are now
returning.
That night I had dinner with a group 
of young aid workers in their compound.
The foreigners talked mainly of the fun
they would have when their stint in Pul-i-
Khumri was over. The Afghans talked
only of staying and of the prospects of
permanent peace. “This time there will be
peace,” said one young Afghan. “People
are tired of the fighting”. 
Older Afghans I talked to, however,
were not so sure. “Things haven’t
changed,” a middle-aged engineer told me
next day. “The mullahs (Muslim clerics)
and the commanders (warlords) are still
in control. Every family still has a
weapon, and 40 percent of Afghans earn
their living from their guns.”
Some things, however, are changing.
Evidenced, for example, at a school we
visited at Pul-i-Khumri. Here hundreds of
eager boys and girls were squatting in the
playground, while their classrooms were
being refurbished. As we were leaving
lorries laden with new desks and chairs
rolled in through the gates. 
Returning to Kabul via the Salang Pass,
the road climbed by the side of the
Khinjan River through numerous
mullberry groves, then rose steeply across
rugged slopes sprinkled with Asian
conifers. At an altitude of 3,363 metres is

centuries ago joined east and
west, north and south across Afghanistan.
Ruins of ancient cities, such as Kapisa, in
the heart of Afghanistan, and Aï
Khanoum and Yemshi on the northern
Afghan plains told a story of complex
exchanges with other lands. 
At Aï Khanoum, archeologists
discovered an orientalized Greek city; at
Kapisa they unearthed a treasure trove of
Indian ivories, Chinese lacquers and
Roman art, and at Yemshi they found
motives reflecting the disparate artistic
styles of India, Greece, Iran, China and
the nomads of Central Asia.
War, theft and acts of destruction by
the Taliban have, however, devastated
much of Afghanistan’s rich and varied
heritage, which vividly illustrated several
high points in the history of civilization
over the past 2,500 years. And although
efforts are now underway to protect what
remains, much of what was destroyed is
irreplacable.
THE LEGACY OF
ALEXANDER THE GREAT 
The Achaemenid Persians were the first to
include Afghanistan in their empire in the
6th century BC, but a few coins found at
the foot of Tepe Maranjan in the centre of
Kabul were the only surviving evidence of
their presence. These have now been
stolen.
Afghanistan’s strategic position at the junction of China, India, Central
Asia and the Middle East, made it a meeting point of culture, commerce,
conversion and conquest. Its art, architecture and archaeology bear
witness to this extraordinary past.
A historical junction

Once one of the cultural
icons of Kabul, the
museum was repeatedly hit
by rockets during the 1991-
96 civil war, and two-thirds
of its unique collection
systematically looted. Many
irreplacable items, such as
the Begram ivories (right),
the entire numismatic
collection, and fragments of
Buddhist wall paintings
from the Bamiyan Valley
disappeared. Later, the
Taliban smashed many of
its Greco-Buddhist statues.
Of two nearly 2,000-year-
old statues – one believed
to represent the Kushan
King Kanishka I, the other a
Kushan nobleman - that
once graced the entrance
hall, nothing is left but the
feet. The fragments of
these and other smashed
statues are piled in crates
in the museum, in the hope
that experts, using digital
and virtual assembly
techniques, can
reconstitute some of them.
It is also hoped to bring
back items taken abroad
illegally as soon as the
museum is secure.
With the help of Greece,
the museum building,
which is situated in the
war-ravaged suburb of
Darulaman, some eight
kilometres from the centre
of Kabul, is to regain its
roof and windows. Efforts
to restore the museum’s
collection have already
begun, with CEREDAF, a
French NGO, furnishing the
required materials, and the
Musee Guimet of France,
the British Museum and the
SPACH (Society for the
Protection of Afghanistan’s
Cultural Heritage, an NGO)
contributing to the
inventory and training of
personnel.
“We must hurry, for 15
years the artifacts have not
been treated and many
have defects” said the
museum director as he
showed a recent visitor
around the dark, dusty
museum, which six months
after the fall of the Taliban
was still without water or
electricity. 
The first museum in
Afghanistan was
established in 1919 in the
Bagh-i-Bala palace
overlooking Kabul, and
consisted of manuscripts,
miniatures, weapons and
art objects belonging to
former royal families. A few
years later the collection
was moved to the king’s
palace in the city centre 
and in 1931 was officially
installed in the present
building, which King
Amanullah had originally
intended to be the
Municipality of a new
capital area on the outskirts
of Kabul.
The original collection
was dramatically enriched,
beginning in 1922, by the
first excavations of the
Delegation Archeologique
Francais et Afghanistan
(DAFA). Through
the years other
archeological
expeditions
added their finds
to the museum
until the
collection
spanned  6,000
years, including
the Prehistoric,
Classical, Buddhist, Hindu
and Islamic periods. 
Kabul Museum: Keeping
Afghanistan’s culture alive
A banner hung over the entrance of Kabul museum earlier this year proudly 
proclaimed: “A nation stays alive when its culture stays alive.” Inside, however, 
tells a different story.

Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, eventually
taking in the whole of northern India and
parts of northwest China. 
Having no traditions on which to build
a settled way of life, the nomadic Kushans
adapted what they found in ways best
suited to their own personality. What
emerged was a vibrant indigenous culture
born of the fusion of western oriented
Greco-Bactrian styles with those from
eastern-oriented India and interpreted by
the forceful character of Central Asia. 
The result was vital and dynamic and is
best illustrated by the Golden Hord of
Bactria: a treasure trove of Kushan art
discovered at Tillya Tepe in the vicinity of
the city of Shibarghan on the northern
Afghan plain. Archeological excavations,
began there in 1978, revealed six tombs
dating from the lst century AD, the zenith
of Kushan power in these regions. The
excavators speculate that the burials, five
of them women, were of the nobility of
the nearby ancient city of Yemshi,
perhaps even the rulers.
The corpses were draped in cloth
shrouds decorated with hundreds of gold
and silver disks reflecting the many
traditional art styles of Central Asia.
Indian, Greek, Iranian, and Chinese motifs
are readily perceptible, but perhaps most
interesting is the influence of the animal
art of the pastoral nomads. The infusion
Alexander the Great, having crushed
Achaemenid power, was the next to
invade Afghanistan in 328 BC. A
Macedonian who became steeped in
Greek culture after his conquest of Greece,
and then an oriental monarch captivated
by the idealism of the East, Alexander
was himself the embodiment of cultural
intermingling.
Unable to quite conquer Central Asia,
because of fierce resistance, Alexander
colonized it. He founded several new
cities there and his men intermarried,
introducing Hellenism but at the same
time becoming thoroughly Asianized and
integrated into the local population. This
cross-fertilization of cultures resulted in a
multinational kingdom that bridged the
disparate cultures of India, Iran, Greece
and China. It’s name was Bactria and one
of its cities was at Aï Khanoum, at the
confluence of the Kokcha and Amu Darya
(ancient Oxus) rivers in northern
Afghanistan.
Aï Khanoum was the easternmost
Greek city ever discovered in Asia, and
before their work there was interrupted by
the Soviet invasion in 1979, French
archeologists uncovered a triangular
metropolis with sides 1.6 km long. Inside
it were many typical Greek monuments,
including a gymnasium, a 6,000-seat
theatre, a stadium, public baths and
temples. Its Hellenistic architecture
incorporated the three classical styles:

Ionic, Doric and Corinthian. Some of its
shrines, however, were more Persian than
Greek.
The past five years have been fatal for
Aï Khanoum. “The site has been ravaged
by clandestine diggings,” says Afghan
archeologist Zemaryalai Tarzi.  “And what
was left of the ancient ruins, including
stately columns, their shafts, capitals and
bases, have been transported for use as
ordinary building materials in
neighbouring villages.” 
Alexander`s conquests took place at a
time when Greek art and thought were in
fullest flower and the peoples of Asia
were quick to adopt – and adapt – the
aesthetics of Greece. A single example
speaks volumes: statues at Tepe Shotor
near Jalalabad, in southern Afghanistan,
represent Alexander, Heracles and
Dionysos as acolytes of Buddha. Tepe
Shotor, which, transformed into an open-
air museum, was one of the brightest
jewels of Afghan archeology, has also
been destroyed.
THE NOMAD INVASIONS 
No fully satisfactory explanation has ever
been offered for the periodic explosion of
nomadic peoples from – or through –
Central Asia, but the pattern is clear: the
region’s sedentary peoples were
repeatedly overrun by mounted nomads,
and its cities repeatedly razed and rebuilt
with each successive invasion.  The
invaders pitched their tents and settled
down, adopting the civilized ways of
those they had conquered. And, having
become soft themselves, they submitted
in turn to a new wave of hardy warriors.
Thus, in the first century BC, the Greek
kingdom of Bactria was conquered by the
Scythians, who, one hundred years later,
were overrun by the Parthians. Hard on
their heels rode the Kushans, nomads of
Central Asian origins, who at the
beginning of our era settled astride the
Hindu Kush. From their centre in
Afghanistan the Kushans, pushed their
frontiers across what is now Pakistan,

Fine Arts and Crafts
Afghanistan’s figurative artists and sculptors are getting back to
work. At the Academy of Fine Arts in Kabul a wooden figure of a
woman, unthinkable under the Taliban, was being carved this
summer. While exhibits at the newly-opened Gallery of Fine Arts 
and Traditional Afghan Crafts included figurative works of over 
20 known Afghan artists, plus many new ones. 
Under the Taliban’s strict
interpretation ofF Islam all
figurative art and sculpture was
banned. Even today some
conservatives still oppose it.
“The long war, and especially
the last five years, was
especially difficult for Afghan
artists,” says the Coordination of
Humanitarian Assistance (CHA),
which after three years in exile
in Pakistan recently opened a
gallery in Kabul.
Although fine ceramic art no
longer flourishes in Herat,
UNESCO-supported craftsmen
still produce glazed brick and
slab for restoration of the city’s
ancient Muslim monuments.
The preparation of glazed
brick is simple: the baked brick is
dipped into, or painted with,
coloured glazes mixed from
seven ingredients, including
pigments. It is then fired for one
day or more – depending on the
colour – at 1000 degrees
centigrade, in a process which
has remained virtually
unchanged for centuries
The Mesopotamians were the
first people to use glazed brick
as a contruction material. They
used it to make mud walls water
resistant rather than as
decoration. But glaze allowed
the introduction of colour, and
these colourful surfaces,
decorated with beautiful
geometric and floral forms,
arabesque panels and elegant
bands of calligraphy, eventually
became an indispensable
element of Islamic architecture,
absorbing the creative genius
that, in the Christian West, went
into frescoes and sculpture.
of this pastoral style gave life to an art
that was fast becoming static, as the
hybrid traditions from which it derived
lost their vigor.
Another eloquent example of the
encounter of civilizations on Afghan soil
is the Treasure of Begram discovered in
the ruins of the Kushan summer capital of
Kapisa, 60 kilometers northeast of Kabul,
on the fertile Begram plain. French
archeologists excavating the site shortly
before the outbreak of World War II found
a treasure trove of precious objects from
the eastern Mediterranean, India and
China. Hidden in a chamber of the royal
city, they found hundreds of plaster
moulds of Greco-Roman medallions,
painted glassware from Alexandria in
Egypt and Chinese lacquered furniture
encrusted with Indian ivory. The ivories
were divided between the French Musee
Guimet and the Kabul museum. Those in
Kabul have long since disappeared.
BUDDHISM AND
GANDHARAN ART
It’s difficult to say how early Buddhism
entered Afghanistan. According to legend
it arrived from its homeland in India via
Trapusa and Bhallika, two merchants who
were the first lay followers of Buddha.
This story is based on popular etymology

east decisively altering the strength and
distribution of its religions. 
Afghanistan was affected by both of
these developments. Visiting Kabul in
644, Chinese pilgrim Hsuen-tsang noted:
“The king is Turk, the men naturally
fierce and impetuous.”
THE GROWTH OF 
THE ISLAMIC EMPIRE
Not only did the Turks of Central Asia
embrace Islam, they became its new cut-
ting edge. By the end of the first millen-
nium, the military manpower and fighting
skills of Turkic steppe nomads had taken
over the role played by the desert
Bedouins during Islam’s first extraordinary
period of expansion through the Near
East. And a second era of Muslim expan-
sion began. 
From the final decades of the 10th
century through the 11th and 12th
centuries Afghanistan was the seat of
powerful Muslim kingdoms: first the
Ghaznavid Dynasty, then the Ghorid
dynasty. During this period Islam became
firmly established in Afghanistan, which
became a springboard for the islamization
of northern India.
identifying the name Bhallika with the
town of Bahlika (Balkh) in northern
Afghanistan. It is more probable, however,
that it was at the time of the 2nd century
AD Kushan king Kanishka I that
Buddhism spread from northwest India
through Afghanistan to areas further
north and east. 
At the same time, Buddhist art also
crossed the borders of its land of origin
penetrating the cultures it encountered. A
curious hybrid art form emerged
combining Western Classical elements
with those of Central and southern Asia.
It carried the name of the region where its
famous workshops flourished: Gandhara,
an area comprising the Kabul Valley and
adjacent areas.
Gandhara subjects reflect not an
intermingling or proper synthesis but the
often awkward coexistence of disparate
stylistic influences that have – for that
reason – made Gandharan sculpture so
distinctive. These influences are Greco-
Roman, Indian and Parthian. 
It was also at Gandhara that the
Hellenistic concept of personality
combined with religious influences from
India, to bring about one of the turning
points of Buddhist art. Up to this point the
Buddha himself had not been represented
in person. Instead, symbols such as an
empty throne, a horse without a rider, a
parasol, a bodhi tree or footprints had
been used to indicate his presence. But at
Gandhara the image of the Buddha
appears in human form for the first time.
This notably gave rise to giant statues
of Buddha at Bamiyan (See page 48), in
the heart of the Hindu Kush, which were
demolished in 2001 following a decree by
the Taliban’s spiritual leader Mullah Omar
ordering “all non-Islamic statues and
tombs” to be destroyed.
In the 6th century, Turkic tribes began a
westward wave of migrations from their
original homeland in Mongolia that
ethnically swamped Central Asia. While
in the 8th century, Muslim Arabs swept
The Ghaznavids, in 1008, defeated a
confederacy of Hindu rulers at Peshawar,
annexed the Punjab, and extended
Muslim influence as far south as Lahore.
Then came the Ghorid conquests which,
by the end of the 11th century, had
expanded Muslim rule over most of
northern India, adding Delhi and Ajmer to
the Islamic realm in 1192, and two years
later Bihar and Bengal. 
The spread of Islam brought profound
changes in the art and culture of Central
Asia. In the 9th to 13th centuries,
figurative fresco and sculpture – forbidden
by Islam – disappeared, and was replaced
by non-representational art. Four main
styles of decoration: floral, calligraphic,
geometric and arabesque dominated all
other art forms.
Despite the dominance of common
Islamic values each region preserved
essential individual features of its art and
culture. Among these were the miniature
paintings of the School of Behzad in
Herat, which continued to represent
human images.
In the field of architecture, Muslims
allied the traditions of the past with
scientific and mathematical precision and

Babur’s tomb is a modest
structure in comparison to
the elaborate edifices built
by his descendents in
India. It was once
surrounded by the
beautifully landscaped
gardens know as Bagh-e-
Babur. But decades of
neglect, 23 years of war
and four years of drought
have seen the gardens
perish and left their
historical buildings
decayed. At walking
distance from the city
centre, they are now
surrounded by urban
sprawl climbing up the
hillside into which they
are set.
Babur, who claimed
direct descent from both
Genghis Khan and Timur,
seized the throne of Kabul
after being ousted from
his own in the Ferghana
Valley. From Kabul, in
1525, he launched his
invasion of India and
became the first of the
Moghul emperors with his
court at Agra.
Babur, however, never
forgot Kabul, and when he
died, in 1539, he was
buried there, according to
his wishes, in Bagh-e-
Babur. A century later
Shah Jahan, who built the
Taj Mahal, constructed a
small marble mosque in
Babur’s Garden, close to
the simple tomb of his
forefather. In the late 19th
century Amir Abdur
Rahman built a elegant
pillared pavilion whose
veranda looked out over
terraced gardens dotted
with fountains,
magnificent stands of
chinar (plane) trees, and a
profusion of sweet
smelling wild rose and
jasmine to the city beyond. 
According to
researchers, the Bagh-e-
Babur gardens were laid
out  between 1504 and
1528. They were damaged
by an earthquake in 1842
which ruined many parts
of Kabul. The gardens
were restored by the
Afghan ruler Amir Abdur
Rahman in the late 18th
century and again by King
Nadir Shah in the 1930s.
But both men were
influenced by European
gardens and the Islamic
tradition of the garden was
ignored. Later the gardens
became a public
playground with the
construction, during
Communist rule, of a
swimming pool.
A multi-year renovation
project will restore the
shrine and mosque
according to their original
design, and if feasible the
pavilion, which was
severely damaged, then
partially restored.
Neighbourhood residential
dwellings will be
rehabilitated, and the
gardens replanted with
trees, flowers and other
ornamentation appropriate
to Moghul tradition.
Walkways and benches
will be constructed for
public use so that
residents of Kabul may
enjoy the gardens again.

it reflected the influence of all three. Nor
was it modeled on the old Central Asia.
Instead, these captured architects
embellished Timurid cities with buildings
possessing a new and dazzling Tatar
concept.
The 40-year rule of Timur’s son, Shah
Rukh, a devout Muslim and a man of
peace, saw the transformation of the
restless nomad empire into an orthodox
Sunni Muslim state with Herat, in
western Afghanistan, as its capital.
Although Herat is also known for its
monuments dating from the powerful
Muslim Ghorid dynasty – including the
12th century Great Mosque, which was
reconstructed in the 14th century in all
its blue and turquoise-tiled splendor –
the city’s real treasures are its
monuments from the 15th and 16th
centuries, when the art of Timurid
ceramic revetment reached its height.
Even after the collapse of the Timurid
Empire, the faience mosaic and blue tiles
that were its hallmark continued to exert
strong influence on later flowerings of
ceramic art in Iran and Turkey.
The court of Shah Rukh and his
successor Husayn were verdant centers of
art and learning. The enlightened
sovereigns protected such creative
personalities as the poet Djami and the
miniature painter Behzad. During their
rule Herat became one of Asia’s most
important literary, artistic and cultural
centres.
One of Herat’s favorite sons was Mir Ali
Shir Nava’i, a venerated 15th century
poet, known as “the Chaucer of the
Turks.” As Chaucer had done in English,
Nava’i revolutionized a national literature
by becoming the first  outstanding writer
to use the Turkish vernacular in his
works. In Nava’i’s hands, Turkish, a
language traditionally regarded by
medieval men of letters as uncouth and
plebeian, achieved recognition as a
graceful medium for poetry and prose of
the highest order.
developed new forms in building and new
tastes in decoration. This produced a large
number of masterpieces of architecture
and art, including the early 12th century
Tower of Masud III, at Ghazni in central
Afghanistan, whose plan is an eight-
pointed star with seven bands of
ornamental brickwork, terra-cotta panels
and stucco decorating its shaft; and the
late 12th century Minaret of Jam which
soars to a height of 65 meters over the
western Afghan plains (See page 43). 
THE TIMURID
RENAISSANCE
This fruitful cultural development was
interrupted by the devastating invasion of
Central Asia by the armies of Genghiz
Khan. Only in the 14th and 15th centuries
with the emergence of the Timurid
Dynasty did Central Asia have the
opportunity for a renaissance of culture. 
In a succession of 15 military
campaigns in 23 countries lasting
50 years, Timur, known in the West as
Tamerlane, carved out an empire
stretching from the Indus River to the
Black Sea. By 1370 the Turco-Mongol
warrior was undisputed leader of the
steppe, and in 1380 defeated the Il Khans
to become master of Persia. In 1398,
Timur stormed through the Khyber Pass,
devastated Sind and Punjab and sacked
Delhi. In 1399 he invaded Georgia, and
in 1401 stormed Baghdad and Damascus.
In 1402 he defeated the Turkish Ottomans
in Ankara. Had he not died of pneumonia
in 1405, as he was leading his armies
against China, Timur may even have
conquered that too.
Timurid art forged a new aesthetic by
linking the cultural traditions of the many
lands they conquered with their own
Turkic origins. From conquered territories
in Persia, India and the Middle East,
Timur plundered both talented craftsmen
and treasures to enhance the cities of
Central Asia. What they created was
neither Persian, Indian or Arab, although

Born in Herat in 1441, Nava’i added the
Turkish language to the roster of the
world’s major literatures. One of his best-
known verses is:
Since the best of men must pass 
through Death’s portal,
Happy is he who makes his name
immortal.
One man who did, was Timur’s great-
great-great-grandson Babur, who seized
Kabul and carved out a kingdom in
Afghanistan, from where he launched his
invasion of India to become the first of
the Moghul emperors.
At Kabul, Babur built a beautiful
landscape garden (See page 55 ) that was
the predecessor of many famous imperial
gardens in the South Asian sub-
continent. Babur’s garden was damaged
by internal fighting between 1992 and
1995, as were many other cultural icons
of Kabul, including the museum (See
page 51). 
With the help of UNESCO and other
organizations active in the restoration
process, including the Aga Khan Trust for
Culture and the Development and
Humanitarian Services of Afghanistan,
this and historical sites elsewhere in
Afghanistan are to be restored. 
Meeting in Kabul in May, Afghan
authorities and international organizations
seeking to rehabilitate Afghanistan’s
cultural heritage, mandated UNESCO to
establish an international committee to
undertake operations concerning the
safeguarding of the Afghan cultural
heritage. A similar type of structure has
already been successful in Cambodia,
where it has been working since the end
of that country’s war.

EDUCATION
In
Afghanistan’s native languages,
they call the start of the new 
school year “Sabak,” meaning
the “return to learning.” This year
“Sabak” took on special significance. For
many of the l.5 million boys and girls
who reported for school were entering a
classroom for the very first time, following
years of school closures and exclusion of
girls from formal education. 
In what it described as its largest-ever
logistical exercise in support of education,
the UN Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) delivered more than 7,000
tonnes of learning materials to virtually
every elementary school in the country.
The supplies included textbooks,
blackboards, pencils and notebooks.
Teaching aids, tents for use as makeshift
classrooms, and other teaching and
learning materials. 
It was just one component of an
Afghan back-to-school campaign led by
the new administration that mobilized
teachers, registered children, readied
elementary school facilities, and
reorganized a curriculum from scratch.
UNESCO for its part focused its efforts
on assisting in the creation of an efficient
education ministry, the improvement of
teacher training, and the development of
curricula and textbooks not only for
primary schools, but also for secondary,
technical and higher education.
Earlier this year, UNESCO funded
nationwide university entrance
examinations, covering the expenses of
professors to travel to provincial cities to
supervise the exams as well as the cost of
printing examination papers and answer
sheets. The examinations were a huge
success with 20,000 candidates
participating, of whom 16,400 – many of
them women – were admitted. 
JUMP-STARTING
HIGHER EDUCATION
Another UNESCO-funded initiative
enabled the Ministry of Education to
bring together more than 91 Afghan
educators from some 26 different
provinces to talk about educational
issues. This workshop was the first
occasion in more than 20 years that the
directors of education offices  throughout
Afghanistan met to share views on how
they foresaw the education system in
the future.
Return to learning
The thirst for education and knowledge in post-Taliban
Afghanistan is enormous. After years of denial, Afghans are
reaching out to embrace new ideas, technology and 
expertise. School buildings are bursting with children eager 
to learn from a handful of teachers determined to teach.

“A massive effort has already been
made over the past few months (…)to
enable children to get back into class,”
says UNESCO Director-General Koichiro
Matsuura. “This first phase must now be
followed up by long-term activities to
rebuild the education system.”
To this end, UNESCO and the Afghan
authorities have drawn up a series of
projects aimed at developing a national
education strategy, UNESCO is seeking
$27 million from donors to meet the
country’s most urgent education needs, In
particular the rehabilitation of Kabul
University to jump-start higher education,
training for education managers and
teachers, and the development of non-
formal and distance education to tackle
one of the world’s highest rates of
illiteracy. 

Afghanistan
Women face a complex web of challenges
as they seek to rebuild their role in Afghan
society. Despite the fall of the Taliban,
deeply conservative values towards
gender still dominate Afghanistan’s social
structure. Few women yet feel confident
enough to walk the streets without the
Burka.
Afghan women, who make up an
estimated 60 percent of the population,
are “the highest stakeholders of peace,
stability and development,” says Dr.
Noeleen Hayzer, executive director of
United Nations Development Fund for
Women (UNIFEM). “They have the most
to gain from new opportunities and also
the most to lose if fragile communities
breakdown.”
Fundamental issues faced by women
include: severe food insecurity - their
removal from the economic sphere by the
Taliban meant that many women without
male breadwinners were reduced to
beggars; one of the poorest healthcare
systems in the world; the need to make up
for years of limited or no access to
education; and widespread fear of violence.
The Chair of the human Rights
Commission, Dr. Sima Samar, says that
“security is not only about ending the war
and silencing the weapons, but it is about
ensuring women and girls can live in
safety and dignity.” She emphasized the
need for national identification cards,
which would ensure women’s right to
engage in the political process as voters
and representatives. At present, only one
to two percent of women in Afghanistan
have identity cards, meaning that almost
98 percent of women are people without
citizenship or identities, and therefore
could be excluded from participating in
elections due in 2004. 
The unprecedented step of setting up a
Ministry of Women’s Affairs for the first
time in Afghan history was a start to
addressing the grave situation of women
and the inequities that developed between
the genders under the Taliban. But
advancing the cause of women within the
context of current conditions will take time
and require fundamental changes in the
social, economic and political areas.
The MoWA must walk a fine line,
balancing traditional values towards
gender issues with modern perspectives
that advocate pushing forward quickly to
address gender inequities. Thus, in order
to make advances, MoWA will move
incrementally rather than taking an overt
and accelerated approach.
Women reclaiming their livesRestructuring the country requires
educated and qualified Afghans. Over the
past two decades, however, Afghanistan
lost an estimated 200,000 teachers and
academics and its 17 universities and
institutes were left devastated by war.
“The immediate priority is to upgrade
and pay present teachers – some of whom
have been cut off from developments in
the outside world for many years and
haven’t been paid for months,” says
UNESCO Kabul education coordinator
Professor Lutfulla Safi. “Next we must
hire and train new teachers, and replace
outdated curricula and text books.” 
Major questions to be addressed in the
long term, says Safi, include the choice of
teaching languages, defining the contents
of school textbooks and curricula, co-
education and the place of religion in
education. On these, he warns, “we must
move carefully.” 
A vital part of the learning process for
many Afghans is the gaining of foreign
language expertise and the development
of new technology applications, such as
computers,” says UNESCO’s Kabul
Education consultant Professor Ed Burke.
To meet this need, it is proposed that
UNESCO and UNDP, in collaboration with
international partners, establish a
Knowledge and Language Center in
Kabul.
UNESCO is also planning the launch of
a major community radio programme to
provide basic education for those who for
nearly 25 years have been excluded from
all types of educational systems, women
in particular. 

Speaking out 
A professional association of women
media workers has been established
in Kabul with support from UNESCO.
The new Afghanistan Women in
Media Network, involves 60 women
media professionals, and will enable
Afghan women to link with their
colleagues all over the world. “The
spirit of these women is remarkable,”
says Martin Hadlow, the director of
UNESCO’s Kabul office. “They have
lived through a lot, and now it is their
turn to speak out.”

lthough the government
controls the five major
newspapers, there are over 85
independent publications in Afghanistan.
In view of its importance in promoting
good governance and democracy in post-
conflict zones, UNESCO is helping to
nurture this fledgling free press.
UNESCO helped re-launch Kabul
Weekly, the first independent publication
to appear in Kabul following the fall of
the Taliban. The newspaper returned to
the streets on January 24, five years after
it disappeared when the Taliban seized
power.
Funding support has also been provided
by UNESCO for several other independent
publications in Kabul, including ARIA
Press, Malalai women’s magazine, Seerat
newspaper for women and the Zambil
Eran satirical cartoon magazine. Funds
have been provided to AINA, a French
non-governmental organization for the
development of independent media, to
enable it to assist these newspapers and
magazines to print and distribute.
UNESCO has been a funding
supporter from the outset of the
independent Media Resource Centre
being developed by AINA. It will be
equipped with radio, television and print
training facilities. UNESCO is also
assisting in training the personnel of the
national television broadcaster Kabul TV,
and providing a digital cameras and an
editing suite for use in developing
newsroom capacity. 
UNESCO is helping to modernize the
Afghan national news agency, Bakhtar,
installing computers and an internet link
Afghanistan
COMMUNICATIONS
In the offices of the
NGO AINA,  the team
of the Kabul Weekly
put the final touches
to the newspaper,
which is sold on the
streets of the capital
Nurturing Afghanistan’s
fledgling free press

for the agency’s network, and
computerizing its considerable archives.
A computer centre has been set up at
Kabul University Faculty of Journalism,
installing ten computers and a satellite
Internet system. The centre, which is
entirely funded by UNESCO, provides
basic information and communication
facilities, including access to the internet
and will offer training in communication
skills for the students, especially women.
There is also a project to create
community multimedia centres to provide
access to information needed for
development projects and provide
distance learning facilities. UNESCO’s
Community Multimedia Centres combine
community radio by local people in local
language with community telecentre
facilities: computers with the internet and
email, phone, fax and photocopiers
enabling even the most remote village to
communicate and exchange information
with the rest of the world. Local people
can create their own community database,
storing up local and external information
for educational and developmental needs.
Even the illiterate can participate by
identifying information required and
responding to information gathered on
‘radio-browsing’ programmes when the
community radio presenter searches the
internet on behalf of listeners.
