The Chinese protester, on the other hand,
was photographed in virtually identical

Magnum and Sipa-Presse) as well as by a
cameraman from Bri t a i n ’s Independent
Television News (ITN).
Hawked around
to the highest bidder
W hy is this difference import a n t , yo u
m ay ask, since the impact of both photos is
strong? The answer is that an exclusive
p h o t o,w h at journalists call “a scoop”,can be
h awked around to the highest bidder wo r l d-
wide and earn many thousands of dollars.
This can’t happen when similar photos have
been taken by several photogr a p h e rs. If the
man who took the A l gi e rs photo had not
been a salaried employee of an agency which
charges its customers by subscription rat h e r
than on a picture-by-picture basis (see box
page 44), both he and the agency could
h ave sold the photo for a fort u n e .

Supply of photo reports outstrips demand, competition from television is intense. 
Can photojournalism survive?

m ation and symbolism in a single aesthetic

R aymond Depardon and British photo-
grapher Don McCullin were the only mem-
b e rs of their profession cove ring the war in
B i a f r a .1 In 1994, s e veral hundred photo-
gr a p h e rs descended on Rwanda in aircraft
c h a rtered for military - h u m a n i t a rian pur-
p o s e s. G o o d - b ye to the exclusive photo.
W h at ’s more, these photogr a p h e rs arri ve d
three months after the genocide began on
A p ril 6 and could only send back depres-
singly similar pictures of the afterm ath of the
tragedy—the exodus and the epidemics,
not the event that sparked them off.
Exponential growth
P h o t o gr a p hy is widely considered to
h ave been invented in 1839.Since then the
number of photographic images has gr ow n
e x p o n e n t i a l l y. It is increasingly hard, d e s-
pite photogr a p h e rs ’s k i l l s , to come up with
a picture that doesn’t echo an earlier one.
Because of the laws of supply and demand
this has led to the situation in which increa-
sing output of news pictures goes hand in
hand with a decrease in the price they fetch.
Does a photo—a silent image, with a
b rief caption or no caption at all—have
a ny intrinsic meaning? Imagine a shot of a
h o rseman who is caught by the camera
whipping his hors e . Is he a coward fle e i n g
the enemy or is he charging bravely forwa r d ?
It all depends,of cours e ,on the caption that
goes with the picture and its credibility.
Take the example of the photos that
were long thought to show the “ Ve l ’d ’ H i v ”
stadium in Pa ris at the time when French
Jews were held there for deport ation in July
1 9 4 2 .2 N ow we know that they show a mee-
ting held two ye a rs lat e r.And what should
we make of the photo analysed by French
philosopher Régis Debray in his book L’ O e i l
naïf (“The Naive Eye”) showing a group of
Pa risian strollers looking nonchalantly at a
bus with an open rear plat f o rm? The scene
a p p e a rs banal, except when we know that
the packed bus was taking Jews to the inter-
nment camp at Drancy, outside Pa ri s.
Herein lies one of the ove rriding we a k-
nesses of photojournalism and of photo-
gr a p hy in general, d e s c ribed by the Ger-
m a ny philosopher Walter Benjamin as
“The image in an age when it can be tech-
nically reproduced”. “I’m just an image,
nothing more,” is all it says to us.
Despite this draw b a c k ,a number of pho-
tos have had a decisive effect on public opi-
nion and changed the course of history.O n e
notable example is the photo of the naked
girl running away from the Vietnamese vil-
lage of Trang Bang which had just been
bombed by mistake with napalm by South
Vietnamese aircraft on June 8, 1 9 7 2 . It wa s
taken by a Vietnamese AP photogr a p h e r ,

can soldier being dragged through the
streets of Mogadishu.It humiliated the Uni-
ted States and turned U. S . public opinion
against the presence of A m e rican troops in
S o m a l i a .
The strength and the weakness of pho-
t o j o u rnalism stem from its capacity to
t rigger a sudden earthquake in public
o p i n i o n — p r ovided that the wo r l d ’s maga-
zines and daily newspapers get hold of the
photo and circulate it. But this key role
has now been taken over by television.
E ven if screened images are often less
s h a rp than many famous still photos,
television gives them added weight and
viewer interest via sound, commentary
and in some cases on-the-spot report i n g .
‘Telepresence’
From an aesthetic viewpoint, p h o t o-
gr a p hy is eve ry bit as good as television
r e p o rt i n g .A photograph can be looked at
again and again, whereas the televised
image fades from the screen. H owe ve r , a
good television report has a didactic adva n-
t a g e : it can explain and teach us about
e ve n t s. Since the 1960s, television sets
h ave become a common household item,
and TV reports reach vast audiences.
M e a n w h i l e , the ingredients of photogr a p hy



PHOTOJOURN A L ISM: HOW IT WORK S
There are three kinds of photojournalism. The
first and oldest kind relies on individual free-
lance photographers who come up with ideas,
shoot a feature and then offer it to various media,
mostly magazines and sometimes daily papers,
for publication. In some cases the media will com-
mission them to produce a report in line with their
special interest or skills.
The second kind comprises groups of photo-
g raphers working in an agency. The oldest and most
prestigious agency is Magnum, which was founded
in 1945 and is the only agency run as a photogra-
phers’ co-operative. Gamma, set up in 19 67 by Ray-
mond Depardon and his associates, is another
famous agency. Sygma and Sipa-Presse were
founded later. All these agencies are based in Pa r i s .
Their way of paying photographers and hence their
working methods are ra d i cally changing. The agency
and the photographer consult with the editors of a
client publication before a job, and usually split the
cost of the assignment as well as the potential pro-
fits originating from publications which negotiate
reproduction fees on a ca s e - b y - case basis. They
keep the copyright to all their photos. This 50 - 50
agreement has revolutionized major assignments.
The third kind of photojournalism is done by the
big news agencies—Associated Press (American),
Reuters (British) and Agence France Presse (Fr e n c h )
—which are often known as wire services. The
media pay subscriptions to the agencies for unli-
mited use of agency photos and news.
News agency photographers are on a regular
s a l a ry, and like most agency journalists their names
are not widely known. They are paid at a fixed ra t e
irrespective of the sales of their photos. Recently,
international photofeature agencies such as
Gamma, Sygma and Sipa-Presse have also put
some of their photographers on fixed salaries. The
turnover of each of these three international agen-
cies is nearly $20 million a year. n

2. More than 12,000 French Jews were rounded
up on July 16 and 17, 1942,and taken to the
Vélodrome d’Hiver stadium (the Vel’ d’Hiv’) in
Paris. From there,most of them were taken to a
transit camp in the suburb of Drancy, and then
sent to German concentration camps.

most famous award in U.S.journalism.

are fine craftsmanship, the courage of the
p h o t o grapher and the high level of skill
required to capture a unique moment, n o t
a second too late or too early.
W h at French writer Jean-Louis We i s s-
berg calls “ t e l e p r e s e n c e ”has swept away the
era of printed magazines. E ven the most
p r e s t i gious magazines no longer shape
public opinion, except on ve ry rare occa-
s i o n s.W h at Debray calls the “ v i d e o s p h e r e ”
has taken over “hot news”, l e aving photo-
j o u rnalism to a few independent photo-
gr a p h e rs who have a hard time getting their
work published.
So is photojournalism on its last legs?
Perhaps not, but to use a metaphor from
athletics maybe it’s on the last lap.The big
photo agencies such as Gamma, Sygma
and Sipa-Presse (see box on facing page)
h ave been forced to turn to areas out-
side journ a l i s m , like illustrating books,
d i c t i o n a ries and ency c l o p a e d i a s , wo r k i n g
for the communications departments of
public and semi-public institutions, p h o-
t o graphing the tempestuous lives of cele-
b ri t i e s , or even doing plain laborat o ry
wo r k .C e l e b rity photos accounted for 60
per cent of Sygma’s turn over before it
was taken over two ye a rs ago, while news
photos earned less than 10 per cent.
These agencies are now so economi-
cally weakened that they are easy prey for
outside inve s t o rs.A major investment gr o u p
looking to break into the field can buy out
a famous photo agency and gain far more
than a network of photogr a p h e rs and a
stock of photos. It can also acquire a pres-
t i gious name which is wo rth far more than
the financial costs of the takeove r.
Banks took a sizeable stake in Gamma
in 1997. More import a n t l y,m e g a - c o m p a-
nies such as Bill Gat e s ’ Microsoft and its
d atabank Corbis have been especially active
in trying to get their hands on major photo
a r c h i ve s. In June 1999, Corbis bought
S y g m a ,whose photos by its salaried staff are
all free of copyri g h t .These photos can be
reproduced ad infin i t u m ,without bri n gi n g
a ny royalties to the photogr a p h e rs who took
t h e m .These companies can draw freely on
such huge archives to obtain low-cost illus-
t r ations for their multimedia activities or else
re-sell these pictures far more cheaply than
o t h e rs on the market,e ven if they are dat e d .
Wire services
“It’s hard to tell the difference these
days between a fresh news picture taken
at gr e at expense and a much cheaper
photo that has come from an archive,”
says Roger Thérond,former head of the
French weekly magazine Pa ri s - M at c h. I n
fact too much photojournalism is killing
photojournalism, just as too many taxes
kill taxation.The fact remains,however,
t h at the death of the written press has
been predicted for the past twenty years
yet it is still alive—and abundantly illus-
trated.So how do things really stand?
Perhaps the past has caught up with us.
The gat e k e e p e rs of photojournalism did
not emerge ove rn i g h t . In 1903, F r e n c h
e n gineer Édouard Belin invented a machine
which could transmit photos by telephone
from one place to another, like sending a
fax today.The machine enabled all the wo r l-
d ’s daily newspapers to receive pictures in
“real time” for publication the next day.
“Wire serv i c e s ” such as A s s o c i ated Press,
R e u t e rs and Agence France Presse were set
up to serve as communications netwo r k s
and feed the media pictures via this pro-
c e s s.
These agencies, n ow virtually the sole
p l aye rs in news photogr a p hy, continue to
c over world events alongside the big tele-
vision netwo r k s.The hundreds of wo r k e rs
on their staff would claim to be simply
“doing a job”. Most newspapers are sat i s-
fied with what they produce. M e a n w h i l e ,
p h o t o j o u rnalism in the strict sense—tel-
ling a story with still photos—is now the pre-
s e rve of a handful of talented art i s t s. n
