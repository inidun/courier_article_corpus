FARAS
incomparable gallery
of 169 frescoes
ONE of the most resounding
victories of the International
Campaign to Safeguard the Monuments
of Nubia has been won at .Faras in
the Republic of the Sudan. ~,:ln the
ancient cathedral of Faras, buried for
centuries beneath the sands, the
Polish Archaeological Mission led by
Professor K. Michalowski has brought
to light an incomparable collection of
frescoes and has saved them in record
time from the waters rising behind
the Aswan High Dam.
Altogether 169 paintings were
uncovered, Including such spectacular
works as a fresco of the Nativity
measuring seven metres by four. No
one had suspected that Faras hid
such an Important cache of artistic
treasures. ^
In February 1963, Louis Christophe,
Unesco Co-ordinator of Archaeolo¬
gical Missions in Egyptian Nubia,
reported to the Unesco Service for
the Monuments of Nubia, in Paris:
"I have received a. report that the
Polish mission uncovered 123 Christian
frescoes and this number is expected
to rise to 150. Querying this astonish¬
ing news I was told that the removal
of a fresco revealed a still more
ancient painting beneath. In most
cases two or three frescoes are
painted one above the other."
Some frescoes were painted by the
alfresco method (painting on plaster
that is still humid); though most were
done on dry plaster. The majority are
magnificently preserved and the vivid
and delicate colours seem as fresh
as the day they were applied. The
subjects include scenes from the Old
and New Testaments, the Nativity, the
Crucifixion and the Three Young Men
In the Fiery Furnace. There are
paintings of the Virgin, St. Michael
and the Apostles, and a series of
portraits of the bishops who were
successively enthroned at Faras.
"We discovered a complete basilica
at Faras", says Professor Michalow¬
ski. "Engulfed by the sands, it had
been abandoned in the 12th century
when northern Nubia came completely
under Moslem rule. It is built of stone
and fired brick in contrast to most
other buildings of the period, including
the many churches scattered along the
Nile, whose mudbrick construction has
suffered from weather and calamities.
Its stones were taken from the ruins
of temples raised by Thutmosis III and
Rameses II. This basilica dates from
the 7th century. Its five naves are a
rare find in Nubia where most churches
have only three. It is dedicated to the
Virgin and Saint Michael.
"During 1962 and 1963 we gradually
cleared the building, and just recently
we brought to light a collection of
frescoes that will become a landmark
in the history of Byzantine art. In fact
no future history of Byzantine art will
be complete unless it includes an
account of the paintings at Faras."
The Polish mission began to live an
astonishing adventure as it literally
peeled away the walls of the basilica
strip by strip; previously there had

been nothing about these walls to
suggest that Nubian painters had
covered them over and over again
with religious images, although the site
of Faras itself had, of course, been
considered as a potentially rich field
for archaeological remains.
Under the Pharoahs of the Middle
Kingdom Faras was an important
fortress; later it became the site of
a New Kingdom temple and of
buildings raised during the Meroitlc
period. Later still It was the capital
of the Kingdom of Nobetea which
covered the north of Nubia.
During this period Faras was the
monastic and cultural centre of
Christian Nubia (where religion took
root and developed under the direct
influence of Byzantium). According to
evidence uncovered by recent exca¬
vations, the administrative centre of
the kingdom was probably at Kasr
Ibrim (see page 33). The amazing finds
at Faras all date from this period of
Christian cultural expansion in Nubia.
"Engraved in a niche on one side
of the basilica", reported Professor
Michalowski, " we found the names of
27 bishops. Since then we have
uncovered their portraits. These are
remarkably true to life. The age, racial
origin and other characteristics of each
person are clearly shown. Most of
these bishops, by the way, were of
African origin. Finally we discovered
their skeletons burled In the cemetery
nearby. These were examined by
Professor Rogalski, an anthropologist
from Warsaw University, who con¬
firmed the perfect similarity between
the facial structures in the portraits
and the skulls."
NIOW came the task of saving
the paintings. To remove
them from the ancient walls demanded
infinite skill and patience. In an ope¬
ration of this kind even a slight
mistake may do irreparable damage to
a masterpiece. And risks increase
when frescoes are like those at Faras,
most of them painted on a dry plaster
background 1,200 years old and thus
extremely brittle.
First the frescoes were cleaned and
then sprayed with a protective
coating. Afterwards a sheet of tissue
paper was applied followed by layers
of muslin impregnated with hot
beeswax. When this had dried the
plaster was cut away from the wall.
It sounds simple enough; in reality it
is delicate and arduous work (see
photos).

the operation increased beyond all
expectation, in an indescribable
