How has advertising changed
with the emergence of the immaterial
economy?
There is a crisis in advertising.The industry is
l a g ging behind social trends, but it’s so rich and
powerful that it’s very difficult for it to change.
In the early twentieth century adve rtising focused
on a company ’s buildings and machines.After that it
s t a rted presenting products.T h e n , since all products
s t a rted looking alike, they could no longer be at the
h e a rt of the message.So in the 1960s adve rt i s e rs star-
ted showing leggy models to sell cars.The long legs
offered added va l u e .The product took a back seat
and what was sold was a symbol.The problem with
this technique is that the message is always based on
c o n s u m e rs ’s h o rtcomings and makes them feel guilty.
It tells them,“if you have n ’t got this product, yo u ’r e
out of it.” On the other hand, if you buy a cert a i n
brand of sports shoes you can play like Ronaldo eve n
if you can’t kick a ball.
A second technique is repetition. P r o f e s s i o n a l s
think people remember a product if they see the same
commercial over and over again.T h at dri ves up costs.
But all the commercials end up looking so much alike
t h at you don’t know which brand they’re adve rt i s i n g
a ny more.Who wins? The companies with the biggest
g u n s , in other words the most money.Who pays? T h e
c o n s u m e r ,because on average adve rtising accounts for
15 per cent of a product’s sales pri c e .People in the ri c h
c o u n t ries sink hundreds of millions of dollars into
a d ve rtising eve ry ye a r. It doesn’t make sense any
m o r e .The system is so sick it’s not going to be around
much longer.
Why should it change?
Because consumers are smarter than adve rt i s e rs.T h e
system worked as long as people were really interes-
ted in the products, because they needed them. B u t
t o d ay, in the rich countri e s , they own enough shirt s ,
swe at e rs and television sets for three entire lifetimes.
So they consume less and better: more trave l , m o r e
c u l t u r e .T h e y ’re also ve ry we l l - i n f o rmed and much
more demanding. They think before bu y i n g . A n d
m a ny people, s t a rting with yo u t h , think that consu-
ming is a way of integr at i n g .They buy certain pro-
ducts to be accepted by society or their community.
They take refuge in an imagi n a ry wo r l d , while their
l i ves are full of fear and unhappiness.
How should advertisers adapt to these new
consumer patterns?
They have to be more creat i ve , but the adve rt i s i n g
i n d u s t ry couldn’t care less about creat i v i t y. It wa n t s
to perp e t u ate the system to keep on living off it.T h e
fact is that adve rt i s e rs must explain the client com-
p a ny ’s philosophy. If they’re successful, c o n s u m e rs
will work out for themselves that the products are
g o o d . To capture their at t e n t i o n , a d ve rtising must
become an artistic product in itself, like a play or a
fil m .T h at has never happened because the only
things that condition the industry are money and
marketing managers , who are idiots. All they know
h ow to do is repeat what ’s already been done.
To be successful adve rtising has to disconnect the
message from the product and forget about marke-
t i n g, which standardizes eve ry t h i n g . I don’t do the
same thing other people do. I use products to focus
on the major problems besetting humanity. I ’ ve
p r oved that it can be profit a b l e . Since I’ve been wo r-
king for Benetton, the company has gr own tenfold.
A d ve rtising people hate me but they have to admit
t h at I’ve wo n . ■

The art of advertising
Customized messages
Christian Blanchasse is the producer of Culture Pub,a television programme broadcast on Fra n-
c e ’s M6 channel, and the director of the weekly CB News Communication. He agrees that
advertising is facing the emergence of a new economy of abundance and more demanding, b e t t e r-
informed consumers. But he is also aware of the transition to an individualistic society and increa-
sing audience and media fra g m e n t a t i o n .“ Twenty years ago everyone was watching the same two
or three television channels. It was easy to develop a single message intended for the whole popu-
l a t i o n .Today society and families are split up.”This situation has led to the growing importance of
direct marketing on mass campaigns.“Advertising is adapting by trying to understand people bet-
ter in order to send them customized messages. More and more specialized companies are polling
individuals and trying to figure out their personalities by overlapping all the information about
them that they can get their hands on.” Blanchasse predicts that new technologies will increase socie-
t y ’s fra g m e n t a t i o n .Yesterday shopping was a family affair.To d a y, “on Internet the individual is the
one who chooses and makes the purchases.The world is changing.” ■
