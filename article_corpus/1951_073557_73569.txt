UNESCO'S 6TH GENERAL CONFERENCE
We work for tomorrow, but tomorrow
begins todayH
,'I T is for tomorrow that we
are working, but tomor-
row begins today."Under
this emblem of urgency, the offi-
cial government representatives
of 59 nations will gather together
in Paris from June 18 to July 12
to decide on Unesco's course of
action for the months to come.
This is the sixth time that de-
legates will be meeting at a
Unesco General Conference. But
1951 is a critical year in which
threats of war call more than
ever before for co-operative
international effcrt to help con-
struct and guard intact the living
fabric of world peace.
Conscious of these pressing re-
quirements, the Executive Board
of Unesco has drawn up a new
draft programme for submission
to the General Conference. It is
a programme conceived not in
terms of Unesco's theoretical po-
tentialities but in the light of the
practical experience of trial and
searching gained in recent years.
It is a programme that has been
scaled down to permit concen-
tration on a number of major
practical problems facing the
peoples of the world today in
education, science and culture.
(The 1951 programme contained
294 resolutions ; the new draft
programme has reduced these by
50 per cent.)
Ignorance is one of the deep-
lying causes of conflict and war.
Lack of fundamental knowledge
for living breeds poverty, disease,
under-nourishment and with these
despair and violence. Perhaps
the boldest and most far-reaching
new proposal to be placed before
delegates at the 6th General Con-
ference will be a special $20 mil-
lion, 12-year project for launching
a world-wide campaign against
ignorance and low standards of
living. It has been called"the
great campaign of men against
their common enemy". (For de-
tails see pages 6 to 11 of this
issue.)
Enemies of the fundamental
rights of men and women must
resort to oppression which ultim-
ately results in friction and con-
nict. The widest of the central
themes running through the pro-
posed 1952 programme is there-
fore action in the service of Hu-
man Rights. Thus, for example,
the conference will be asked to
approve new plans first for mak-
ing these rights more widely
known and understood by the
peoples of the world. Specific
projects, too, will be considered
for studying methods of reducing
racial discrimination ; for an
agreement to lift barriers to the
free movement between countries
of persons travelling for educ-
ational, scientific and cultural pur-
poses ; and for promoting the
effective application of free and
compulsory education as set forth
in Article 26 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
Three groups of peoples have a
special claim to attention in the
modern world. They are the
workers, women and young peo-
pIe ; and special efforts on their
behalf dominate the proposed
Unesco programme for 1952.
To take one example, the many
problems of men and women
workers are the focal point of the
new adult education programme.
One project calls for the establish-
ment in 1952 of an international
centre for improving workers'
educational methods and for
training specialists in this field.
The proposed centre which is to
be set up in co-operation with
international trade unions, will
also organize courses for workers,
laying special stress on under-
standing among peoples of the
world and the necessity of inter-
national co-operation within the
framework of the United Nations.
In addition, Unesco has been
working on a broad programme
for extending fellowship and tra-
vel opportunities for workers. In
1952 individual and group travel
grants for them to study abroad
are to he arranged through work-
ers'organizations in different
countries.
In the same way as for workers,
the 1952 programme includes
fellowship projects specially de-
signed for young persons, and
programmes in every department
of Unesco for practical work to be
done by young people, outside of
school, through youth movements,
voluntary work camps, science
clubs, etc.
Working for the improvement
of the status of women, Unesco
will accentuate in 1952 ways of
providing them with greater
access to education and practical
suggestions for the education of
women everywhere for world
citizen-ship.
The above examples are in-
tended to convey only an idea of
some of the practical themes
which Unesco proposes to develop
in 1952. There are of course
others which are equally im-
portant and urgent. No mention,
for example, has been-made of the
technical assistance plan for eco-
nomic development in which
Unesco is already providing and
will continue to provide practical
help to remedy inequalities of
opportunity and means in educ-
ation, science and culture, which
today hamper under-developed
countries. Mention should he
made, too, of projects proposed
for 1952 for increasing Unesco's
campaign to teach and explain the
principles of collective security
and the contribution of the
United Nations to peace.
In general, it can be said that
in the 1952 programme to be sub-
mitted this month for approval by
the General Conference, projects
of academic interest have been
sacrificed to those which have a
direct or indirect effect upon
present-day world problems and
the programme has been given
more practical direction through-
out.
