People are wo rried about the fa r - r e a c h i n g
transformation of the economy. Are we hea-
ding for “the end of wo r k ” predicted by the
A m e rican economist Je r e my Rifkin? He and his
s u p p o rt e rs say we have reached the end of the road.
We are no longer creating jobs in industry and auto-
mation is sure to reduce their number in the ser-
vices sector.The quantity of work is thus inexorably
bound to decrease.
This thesis may be popular, but it is also mistaken
and harm f u l .H i s t o ry shows that technological inno-
vation has always created jobs on a large scale. In no
way is the current trend leading to “the end of wo r k ” .
Just the opposite: the new economy contains huge
pools of new jobs which can more than make up for
the inevitable loss of traditional jobs.
Dematerialization—the shift away from mate-
rial products—is revolutionizing all aspects of
work—its nature, its organization and its relation-
ship with other activities. Its function is no longer
just the manufacture of physical objects but the
handling of dat a , images and symbols.The content
of jobs is becoming more abstract.Skilled workers
need to know a lot more about mathematics than
their fat h e rs or gr a n d fat h e rs did. E ven milking cow s
and manufacturing require more and more calcu-
lation,evaluation and control.
Financial markets
that never sleep
The organization as well as the product of wo r k
is also becoming increasingly intangi b l e .The unity
of time, space and action which characterized wo r k
in the industrial economy has disintegr at e d .Work is
no longer a regular eight-hours-a-day, five-days-a-
week routine. New rhythms have appeared—the
hectic pace of financial markets which never sleep,
the ups-and-downs of life in show business and the
u n c e rtainties of “ j u s t - i n - t i m e ” production where
components are delivered a few moments before
the final product is assembled.
The new jobs are quitting familiar workplaces
such as fa c t o ri e s , offices and wa r e h o u s e s.Te l e wo r k
is increasing. E u r o p e ’s telewo r k e rs may number 10
million by the year 2000, up from one million in
1994.
This upheaval of worktime and workspace is
going hand in hand with a functional explosion.
The range of skills and types of work is expanding



The advent of an ‘intangible’ economy does not mean the end of work.
But it does mean the end of familiar routines and rhythms, of job security,
of rigid hierarchies and career planning
The future of  

all the time. In the United Stat e s , the number of
job cat e g o ries has risen from eighty in the 1940s
to nearly 800 today. At the same time, trades are
dying out faster and fa s t e r , especially in inform at i o n
technology where many jobs have a short life of
only a few ye a rs. Jobs are becoming simultaneously
more evanescent and more pervasive, more disso-
c i ated and more integr at e d . On the one hand, f r a g-
m e n t ation in time and space seems to be more
e x t e n s i ve than it was in the industrial economy. O n
the other,information technology is strengthening
the links between different stages of work and crea-
ting an overall fluidity.
Disparities in
productivity
The new forms of work are non-linear. When
handling inform at i o n , k n owledge and feelings,
there is no direct relationship between the amount
of effort and the final result. This makes for ve ry
wide disparities in productivity. In industry, t h e
r atio of the performance of an average worker to
that of a good one is no more than one to five.But
in immaterial work, an excellent programmer can
be a hundred times more productive than an ave-
rage one.
Non-linear work means non-linear organiza-
tion.The notion of a rigid,formal hierarchy based
on unchanging cri t e ria no longer makes much
s e n s e .All that mat t e rs now is technical, s c i e n t i fic or
artistic skill and the ability to establish a solid rela-
tionship with the customer. Functional hierarchy is
replaced by what Thomas Stewa rt , a journalist with
the A m e rican monthly magazine Fo rt u n e, c a l l s
“ b r a i n p owe r ” — a u t h o rity gr av i t ates to those who
c r e ate and control the new stock of intangi b l e
a s s e t s :d at a , brand image, t e c h n o l o gical know - h ow
and human capital.
The new techniques for managing human
resources are individualizing the assessment of per-
f o rm a n c e .Two people doing the same job may have
different salaries and different stat u s. A u t o m at i c
across-the-board pay rises are being dropped and
replaced by bonuses linked to results.There are no
sinecures in the new business enterprise,either for
r a n k - a n d - file employe e s , s u p e rv i s o rs or techni-
cians—the supposed benefic i a ries of the new know-
ledge economy.
Business leaders are no longer a protected spe-
cies.The head of a big American firm is ten times
more likely to be sacked for poor performance now
than was the case twenty years ago.The notions of
l oyalty and of indissoluble links between a firm and
its employees are losing their meaning.
The changing nature of work has led to a big
increase in so-called non-typical jobs, i n c l u d i n g
p a rt - t i m e , t e m p o r a ry and flexi-time work and
s h o rt - t e rm contracts.Almost all the jobs created in
Europe between 1992 and 1996 were part - t i m e .
This trend wo rries many observe rs who see it as
hidden under-employment or disguised unem-
ployment.But they are overly pessimistic.
The growth of non-typical jobs is the result of
the convergence of several persistent deve l o p m e n t s.

Where the new jobs are
The shrinking number of jobs in traditional sectors of the economy seems to be a general and
irreversible trend. In rich countries as a whole, the share of industrial jobs fell from 28 per cent
in 1970 to 18 per cent in 1994.
M e a n w h i l e, the share of the services sector grew steadily. Four major new sources of jobs can
be identified:
Handling information and knowledge: computer services, research and development,
teaching and training account for 40 per cent of knowledge worke r s. These high-intensity know-
ledge activities comprised 43 per cent of all new jobs created in the United States between 1990
and 1995,but only 28 per cent of total jobs.
Information technology: here there is a shortage of personnel.Professional groups are
sounding the alarm and calling on governments to help. In the European Union countries, the
imbalance between supply and demand is such that half a million jobs are waiting to be filled.
The health sector: the growth of high-intensity knowledge services in this field is related
to increased life expectancy and the ageing of the population,and the demand for physical and
psychological well-being is also steadily increasing. The growth of expenditure on health is per-
sistent and widespread.For the OECD countries as a whole, this spending grew from 3.9 per cent
of GDP in 1960 to 7.2 per cent in 1980 and 8.4 per cent in 1992.
The leisure economy: this has triggered the expansion of cultura l , sporting and leisure ser-
v i c e s. It ranges from amusement parks and rock concerts to cultural events such as opera and major
art exhibitions.The products of the culture industries have become mass consumer items. Never
before have people read so much, listened to so much classical music or visited so many museums.
Information technology is also going to add to this vast range of consumer choice. In southern Cali-
fornia and New Yo r k , the entertainment and multimedia professions are among the main sources
of new jobs. In Los Angeles, film- and television-related activities created 40,000 jobs between
1992 and 1997,and Hollywood became the city’s main employer. C. G. ■
In the labour market, the increase in non-typical
jobs is one of the ways in which employe rs are
responding to the pressures of competition and
adapting to a global economy which functions
s e ven days a we e k ,t wenty-four hours a day.To cope
with the new situat i o n , firms are having to figure out
h ow they can use their wo r k e rs more efficiently and
flexibly.
The gr owth of non-traditional jobs is also due to
changing demand. Consumers want to be able to
buy a very wide range of goods and services at the
drop of a hat , or amuse themselves any time, a ny w-
h e r e . To meet this demand, shops and places of
entertainment have to be open late at night and on
S u n d ay s.Technology encourages this trend: the vir-
tual economy of the Internet never sleeps.
The widening range of types of work also
reflects long-term demographic trends, especially
the greater number of women workers and longer
life expectancy. Some see non-typical jobs as a
n e c e s s a ry evil, while others , especially women with
children, welcome the change.
The divide between traditional kinds of wo r k
and the new jobs is no longer wat e rt i g h t . Pe o p l e
are increasingly switching back and forth between
the two cat e g o ri e s. In the course of a lifetime, a
p e rson may change from full-time to part - t i m e
work, from an office job to home office and from
the security of a big firm to the adventure of entre-
preneurship.
Changes in the nature of work are also brea-
king down the rigid frontiers which marked off the
world of wo r k . The traditionally distinct fields of
wo r k , e d u c ation and leisure are now interwove n
and coexist flexibly in a kind of triple helix of social
life.
The emerging intangible and relational eco-
nomy has a huge potential for growth because it is
not bound by the constraints of material scarcity.
However, the transition to the new economy is an
open-ended process. The state has a key part to
p l ay in bri n ging it about. G ove rnments can slow
down the rate of change by making it more painful
and more costly.
Obstacles 
to change
Pessimistic scenarios are still plausible,such as
that of an economy which generates few new jobs
and is polarized between a small elite and the rest of
the population who are marginalized and live in
precarious conditions.There is a big risk that this
s c e n a rio will come to pass because current law s
and regulations, as well as widespread pessimistic
ideas about wo r k , are powerful obstacles to change.
Optimistic scenarios require a wholesale reform of
institutional structures and profound changes in
b e h aviour and at t i t u d e s.Such far-reaching changes
often run into strong opposition from the social
and political establishment and come up against
the weight of psychological and social tradition.
But the gamble of a new approach to work must
be made if the transform ation to the intangible eco-
More and more jobs involve measurement,evaluation and control.
