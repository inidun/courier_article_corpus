1 986:Year of peace/8
Love andPeace
SINCE 10 December 1985, a re¬
markable mural by the French
painter Benn has hung in Unesco
Headquarters in Paris. Entitled "Love and
Peace", the mural measures 7 metres by
2.5 metres, and has been presented to
Unesco by the painter, who has devoted his
life and art to the cause of peace and
understanding between people and na¬
tions. Born in 1905 at Bielstok in Russia,
Benn settled in Paris in 1930 and estab¬
lished a reputation before the Second
World War. Shortly before the outbreak of
war he executed a series of seventy-two
premonitory drawings in white crayon on
black paper, which as he wrote later "pre¬
figured the unprecedented monstrosities
that were to assail helpless humanity".
These drawings were exhibited at Unesco
. Headquarters in 1983. Benn's wartime ex¬
periences, including internment and over
two years spent in hiding from the Gestapo,
gave rise to a series of paintings inspired by
verses from the Psalms. The Unesco mu¬
ral, a celebration of universal harmony
achieved after a struggle against war and
violence, also reaches back to the wartime
years, originating in a drawing executed
early in 1 944. Love and peace are evoked
on its three panels by symbolism drawn
respectively from the plant, animal and hu¬
man worlds. The world of plants is repre¬
sented by peace in the form of stylized olive
branches; the animal world by two birds
kissing, sheltered by the graceful antlers of
two young stags. The world of humankind is
symbolized by hands uplifted in a gesture of
prayer to a white dove, the messenger of
peace.
