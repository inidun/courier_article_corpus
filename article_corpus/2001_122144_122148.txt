T h e y ’ re connected,
but are they learning?
Canada’s ambitious vision of computer learning has made it one of the most
connected nations on Earth. But in the country’s classrooms, teachers are not
getting the help they need to make the most of new technology
w o r l d . By 1999, the country
could boast that it was the fir s t
to hook up every willing school
and library to the Internet.
Only Sweden has a higher per-
centage of its students logging
on at school.
But education in Canada
remains the responsibility of
the provinces. Each one has its
own education budget to allo-
c a t e. And each has its own
views on how and when to
integrate computers into the
c u r r i c u l u m . In A l b e r t a , for ins-
t a n c e, computers are inte-
grated in grade one, while in
Ontario they are not generally
given that kind of prominence
until as late as grade seven.
Alberta,after years of squee-
zing the schools for money, is
now making extra funds avai-
lable for innovation, and Cal-
gary’s school board has been
quite bold in tapping into those
f u n d s.The Galileo Educational
Network is one of its innova-
tive projects designed to bring
schools into the age of the
knowledge-based economy.

The three-year project,
funded by $600,000 from the
province and matching funds from
i n d u s t r y, is in place in ten schools, i n c l u d i n g
Glendale Elementary.The idea is that tea-
chers learn to use computers not only as a
means of instruction, but as a tool for chan-
ging the very nature of the classroom.
“Schools are set up on the industrial model.
Children are educated to be workers for
i n d u s t r y,”says Pat Clifford,the president of
Galileo.“They learn very early on the vir-
tues of compliance. They are moved on
every year.The learning is very structured
and hierarchical.”
N o w,she says, students must take more
responsibility for their own learning, with
the teacher acting as a guide and facili-
t a t o r. But it is unrealistic to expect that
teachers can do this alone. The Galileo
programme works closely with school prin-
cipals and the local school boards, a n d
allows teachers to take time off to chart out
new approaches.When given this support,
teachers can afford to confidently test out
different ways. Susan Marinucci,a Grade
At To r o n t o ’s Holy Family Catholic Ele-
mentary school, grade eight teacher Irene
Korbabicz-Putko yearns to help her stu-
dents make the most of computers. H e r
school board offers instruction to the tea-
chers, but in a suburb a good 45 minute-
drive away in rush hour. Not surprisingly,
M s. Korbabicz-Putko sometimes has other
commitments.
Halfway across the country, at Calga-
r y ’s Glendale Elementary School, the local
school board has received funding not only
for on-site teacher training but for an inno-
vative programme that sends experts in
computer education into classrooms to
serve as mentors to the teachers.
Schools like Glendale are finding that
new technology holds extraordinary pro-
mise. But Canada’s experience with com-
puters is very much a tale of two schools.
Holy Fa m i l y, for instance,has just one com-
puter connected to the Internet for 600
students from kindergarten to grade eight.
Glendale has several per classroom.
N a t i o n w i d e, the computer revolution is
still in its early stages.
“Clearly we’re in pioneering days,”
says Richard Smith, the director of Simon
Fraser University’s Centre for Po l i cy
Research on Science and Te c h n o l o g y, w h o
is studying the introduction of computers
into the country’s classrooms. “There will
be missteps and mistakes made, but some-
thing is changing in education and clearly
computers are part of it.”
Back in 1994, Canada set a goal of
having a computer connected to the
Internet in every school and library.
Federal politicians felt that for Canada to
t h r i v e, it must move beyond its traditional
resource-based economy and prepare its
young people for the knowledge-based
Preparing students for the knowledge economy.

Five teacher at Glendale Ele-
m e n t a r y, has woven computers
into projects involving team work
and real-life situations. When I
recently visited the school, h e r
28 students were enthusiastically
involved in a math and chemistry
p r o j e c t .With their teacher’s help,
they had made soap and were
discussing the best price to sell it
a t . The whole exercise had
involved searching for recipes
and pricing information on the
I n t e r n e t . In another class,
younger students had to imagine
they were on a desert island and
design survival tools with very
few resources at hand. A g a i n ,
with the teacher’s help, they drew
some inspiration from pictures
of tools found on the Internet.
These fledgling efforts refle c t
S m i t h ’s vision of computers as
“providing an opportunity to
engage students in a new style of
learning—the explore and discover style.”
This includes opening up connections to
new people and information sources. For
M a r i n u c c i , the prime benefit is obvious:
“ w e ’re connected to the world,” she asserts.
An end to
the sage?
C o n n e c t i o n , so far, is probably the key
word to describe a flurry of initiatives
across the country, inside and outside the
c l a s s r o o m .The Writers in Electronic Resi-
dence programme, for instance, connects
budding student-writers at several schools
to far-off professional authors who act as
readers and mentors. In the eastern pro-
vince of New Brunswick, a programme
keeps teenage mothers in electronic
contact with their schools after they give
b i r t h . In numerous schools, students are
developing CD-ROMs documenting envi-
ronmental and heritage issues, c r e a t i n g
web pages and producing online maga-
zines.Through its SchoolNet programme,
the government works with the private
sector and education groups to fin a n c e
and promote these innovations.
Teachers experienced with computer
learning understand that their roles must
change, but that they are still vital to the
l e a r n e r. Larry Danielson,of Garden Va l l e y
Collegiate Institute in Wi n k l e r, M a n i t o b a ,
has been teaching an English course avai-
lable partly online for students enrolled
in a co-operative programme (combining
schooling with part-time employment).
But his first principle stresses human
c o n t a c t :“ We really focus on personal rela-
t i o n s h i p s,whether on-line or face to face.”
“What we’re seeing,” says Elise Bois-
j o l y, the executive director of Canada’s
SchoolNet,“is gradually the teachers are
becoming less of the ‘sage on the stage’
than a ‘guide on the side.’ It’s a cultural
shift,and one that will take a bit of time.”
Her hope is that such methods begin as
early as grade one. “If you start early it
will be in the culture of the learner.That’s
part of the larger goal of building a lifelong-
learning culture.”
But she acknowledges that there is a
long way to go. Lack of teacher training is
a major barrier,she says. In Ontario, for ins-
t a n c e, the number of annual professional-
development days has been cut from nine
to four.And money is short for maintaining
and repairing the computers. “If computers
a r e n ’t used in the right way, they can
impede learning,” Boisjoly says.“The gui-
dance of the teacher is critical.”
But as the experience of Irene Korba-
bicz-Putko suggests, Canada has only
begun to address the issue of how to train
its 300,000 public school teachers. “There
are exceptional cases of well-trained tea-
c h e r s, but overall it’s not one of our bright
lights,” says Smith. Until teacher training
receives its due, the country will miss out on
the real benefits of the computers it has ins-
talled at such expense and effort in the
classroom. ■
