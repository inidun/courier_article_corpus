A world congress on copyright teaching
by Yves Gaubiac
UNESCO is holding a World Con¬
gress on Copyright Teaching and
Information in Paris in September
1987 in order to mark the thirty-fifth anni¬
versary of the Universal Copyright Con¬
vention, which was signed on 6 September
1952 and the secretariat of which ¡s
provided by Unesco.
The theme of the Congress, which is
directly related to Unesco's mandate in the
field of education, has been chosen because
many infringements of copyright are due to
lack of information and knowledge.
The provision of information and educa¬
tion about copyright is an indispensable
part of any effort to ensure that copyright is
respected. The idea of literary and artistic
property is not universally shared. There is
no basic reflex relating to justice and equity
for creators. Education and training are
needed in order to create this reflex. Once
¡n'circulation, created works are often seen
as common property which can be freely
used. Works should certainly be circulated
as widely as possible, in order to satisfy
people's legitimate desire to enjoy the crea¬
tions of the mind. But the use of a work
without its author's consent and in the
absence of any remuneration is harmful to
creative activity since it deprives authors
and their rights holders of the financial
resources necessary to create and invest in
the production of new works.
Copyright is recognized in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights of 10 Decem¬
ber 1948, which states that "Everyone has
the right to the protection of the moral and
material interests resulting from any scien¬
tific, literary or artistic production of which
he is the author".
Copyright is now an accepted right. It
should be more widely known if it is to be
more widely respected.
YVES GAUBIAC, of France, is a consultant with
Unesco's Copyright Division.
