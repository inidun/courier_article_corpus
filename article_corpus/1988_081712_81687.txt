The decimal system
The decimal system, now fundamental to modern science, originated in
China. Its use can be traced back to the fourteenth century BC, the archaic
period known as the Shang Dynasty, though it evidently was used long
before that.
An example of how the ancient Chinese used the decimal system may be
seen from an inscription dating from the thirteenth century BC, in which
"547 days" is written "Five hundreds plus four decades plus seven of days".
In computation, the Chinese used counting rods on counting boards. To
"write" ten involved placing a single rod in the second box from the right,
and leaving the first empty, to signify zero. To change the ten to eleven, a
single rod was added in the first box. To "write" 111, single rods were
placed in the first, second and third boxes. Apparently from the earliest
times, the decimal place system for numbers was literally i place system;
the Chinese placed counting rods into actual boxes.
The fact that the decimal system existed from the very beginnings of
mathematics in China gave the Chinese a substantial advantage, laying a
foundation for most of the advances they later made.
