AFRICA
by Michel Leiris
LONG before the aesthetic
reassessment which at the
turn of this century led to the "dis¬
covery" of hitherto disdained arts,
Europeans had begun to show interest
in Negro art. By the second half of the
15th century, examples of work by
MICHEL LEIRIS, author and anthropologist,
is a leading authority on Negro cultures
of Africa and the New World, and is on the
staff of the Musée de l'Homme, Paris. Few
among his many published works have
been translated into English. Among these:
"Race and Culture" (Unesco, 1965; 3/6,
$0.60) and "The African Negroes and the
Arts of Carving and Sculpture" (in "Interre¬
lations of Cultures, Their Contribution to
International Understanding"), Unesco,
1953; out of print.

Negro artists were already reaching
Europe...
In the 17th century, a Jesuit priest,
Father Athanasius Kircher, who is still
remembered for his scholarly books
on a wide variety of subjects, founded
a museum in Rome (today the Pigorini
Museum). It was to house, among
other material, an important ethnugra-
phic collection which today includes
stone statuettes brought from the
Lower Congo towards the end of the
17th century.
Travellers were already expressing
admiration for what they had seen on
their journeys to tropical Africa. In
1668, Olfert Dapper of Holland des¬
cribed the city of Benin in glowing
terms. In 1704, Willem Bosman, also

MIGHTY OX DRUM
Though of strikingly
modern appearance,
this carving was
actually discovered
at the end of the
19th century in
the Ubangui River basin
of equatorial Africa.
A huge tom-tom shaped
in the form of an ox,
it is one of the
finest examples
of the African
drum-maker's craft.
Carved from
a single piece
of wood, it measures
no less than 2.29 m.
(7 ft. 6 in.) in length.
With the hollow
belly serving as
a sound-box,
the drum was able
to transmit messages
over a great distance.

The
revelation
of
Negro art
12
of Holland, recorded that, while visit¬
ing what is now Ghana, he had seen
gold objects "of pleasing shape" and
testified to the skill of the Negro gold¬
smiths. This tribute was confirmed a
century later by the British Envoy,
Thomas E. Bowdich, chiefly in his
description of the ornaments worn by
King Sai Tutu Çuamina of the Ashanti
people to receive the British mission.
Between 1795 and 1797, the Scottish
doctor and explorer, Mungo Park, was
struck by the skill of the Mandingan
goldsmiths, and in 1884, a report by
Ensign Besson, the first commander
of the French fort of Grand Bassam,
in the Ivory Coast, mentioned gold
objects from the Ebrié district which
"sometimes show a facility of design
and an understanding of proportions
rarely found among savage peoples."
Towards the close of the 19th cen¬
tury a number of scientific works
appeared such as the studies by Leo
Frobenius of Germany on the art work
of various African tribes, and two
English works by Charles Read in
association with Ormonde Dalton and
A.H. Pitt Rivers. All praised the ancient
art of Benin although they attributed
it to Portuguese influence, since in
those days it seemed inconceivable
that Africans could produce bronze
and ivory work of such consummate
skill all by themselves.
It was not until the early years of
this century that "Negro art" gained
full recognition. Artists in Paris, Dres¬
den and Munich seeking to instill new
life into Western art were drawn to
African wood carvings which fascinated
them and wherein they found not only
inspiration but new notions that helped
them to answer some of the questions
that perplexed them.
The first person to write of Negro
art as a great art worthy of being
taken seriously was a member of this .
avant-garde group, the German poet
and writer on aesthetics, Carl Einstein.
His Negerplastik was published in Leip
zig in 1915. It was a short work of
little ethnographic value but of great
aesthetic importance. In it Einstein set
forth the intrinsic qualities of African
sculpture in so far as it answered
some of the problems which were then
exercising the greatest exponents of
European art.
The art of Benin, and indeed the
earlier art of Ife, some remarkable
examples of which had been found
in 1910 by Frobenius, were already
known to the world when the Neger-
plastik was published. But there was
reluctance to regard these arts (which
were strikingly naturalistic) as a gen¬
uine product of the African Negro.
The Negro spirit was assumed to be
fundamentally opposed to naturalism
so that the Benin-lfe carvings were
explained as the result of foreign in¬
fluences introduced into tropical
Africa.
Things have changed since then.
We now appreciate far better than
our predecessors did the great diver¬
sity of Negro art forms. If Ife art
remains quite unique (the artists who
produced the bronze heads and figures
were naturalists who achieved a purity
of form as majestic as that of the
great Negro masterpieces conceived
according to completely different
norms), it is at least a factor which
cannot be disregarded in any assess¬
ment of the plastic arts of the African
Negro.
We are, moreover, beginning to form
an idea of the Negro artist rather dif¬
ferent from that which is even now
too often current. His anonymity is
now being recognized to be due essen¬
tially to the general absence of signed
works (due in turn to the fact that
writing is almost unknown in that part
of the world) and to the scantiness
of our information, which prevents us
from recognizing that a particular work,
considered of interest simply from the
point of view of discovering to which
ethnic group its creator belonged, may

In this rider with raised
arms the sculptor has
depicted the figure
of a mythical ancestor
sacrificed in expiation
of a ritual offence.
The 36 cm. (13 in.) wooden
figure comes from a Dogon
village (Mali).
Its patina of cinders shows
that it long remained
on the sacrificial altar.
All the legs of the mount
(possibly a horse)
have been broken.

MOUSE ORACLE
A contemplative figure, its back resting against
a piece of pottery, reveals the grace
which places the works of the Baule
artists (Ivory Coast) in the front rank
of African sculptures.
The pottery, 25 cm. '10 in.) high, was used for reading
omens. It fits into a circular wooden base and has
two compartments, one above the other.
Two hungry mice were placed in the lower one.
The upper one held a tortoiseshell covered with millet
on which ten small sticks were arranged.
Climbing up to eat the millet,
the mice disturbed the sticks whose
new patterns were interpreted by a soothsayer.

A KING AND HIS MUSICIANS
The sumptuous arts of the Ashanti
kingdom (Ghana) are attributes
of a great civilization in which guilds
of artists were formed to meet the
demands and elegant tastes of the court.
The profusion and beauty of ornaments
and precious objects astounded travellers
who saw them as early as the 18th century.
Left, a bronze kuduo or
sacred vessel in which
ritual offerings were placed.
In the centre of the lid (detail below)
the richly bejewelled king
smokes his pipe of state.
Around him are his musicians:
seven horn players following
the bearer of a double bell.
A seated figure facing the king
flourishes the royal sceptre.
The vessel and its figures were cast
by the lost wax process,
a technique known throughout
the lands along the Gulf of Benin,
where the science of working gold
and other metals became highly developed
in the service of the royal courts.

AFRICA (Cont'd)
Symbolism
and beauty
of design
have been executed by an artist of
high local repute. This is a fact now
established in respect of many areas
of Africa.
As comparative study is extended,
the African artist's products appear
less stereotyped within a given style,
and we are gradually coming to rea¬
lize that, despite the weight of tra¬
ditions, the artist still has a certain
margin of liberty and can thus in the
best cases, of course give his work
a personal stamp.
While, since the Negerplastik was
published, considerably more has been
learnt about Negro art, and while there
is no question that, even in its time,
that work was seriously marred by an
almost complete failure to understand
the sociological context in which any
work of art is set, it remains true
that Einstein was able to show very
clearly the priceless value of what the
Negro sculptors have done and what
any sculptor can learn from an exa¬
mination of the forms taken by their
works.
Reacting against the tendency of
those who were first fired with enthu-.
siasm for Negro art to concentrate
on the beauty of the objects alone,
without bothering about their exact
significance, most of the anthropolo¬
gists and others who have written on
this subject in the last few decades
have laid stress on the context of the
works, which had been neglected by
earlier writers on art, artists and art-
lovers. But they have laid so much
stress on the context that, when we
read much of what has been written,
we find the works themselves more or
less obscured behind the web of be¬
liefs and practices to which they cor¬
respond.
African arts are almost always highly
symbolical and functional in nature.
Yet, as many observers have noted,
there is a growing tendency on the part
of Africans to view their crafts aesthe¬
tically, as works of art, and no longer
exclusively as functional objects or
symbols.

GUARDIANS OF THE HARVEST
Carved on the door of a millet granary,
three capped and bearded figures
with bent knees call on the ancestors
of the Dogon people (Mali) to protect
the family harvest.
The double herring-bone pattern
bordering the panel symbolizes
the rain which makes
the millet sprout.
