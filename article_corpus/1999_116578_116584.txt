A rt , like other potent substances, should be
consumed in moderation.This conclusion is
to be drawn from the experience of the
French novelist Stendhal (Mari e - H e n ri Beyle, 1 7 8 3 -
1842) who, while visiting Florence in 1817, e m e r g e d
from the church of Santa Croce in an extremely
shaky condition.
“I was already in a kind of ecstasy,” he wrote,“ b y
the idea of being in Florence, and the neighbourhood
of the gr e at men whose tombs I had just seen.
Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty, I
s aw it in close-up, I touched it so to speak. I had
reached that point of emotion where the heave n l y
s e n s ations provided by the fine arts meet passionat e
f e e l i n g s. On leaving Santa Croce, I had palpitat i o n s ;
all the life went out of me, as I walked I was afraid I
would fa l l .”
This is the first description of what Florentine
p s y c h i at rist Graziella Magherini named “the Stendhal
s y n d r o m e ” , a profound psychological disturbance
t riggered by exposure to a work of art . Symptoms may
include dizzy spells, loss of the sense of identity and
o ri e n t at i o n , depression and even physical exhaustion.
This kind of cultural ove r d o s e , for which the only
k n own cure is rest, r e p o rtedly affects a handful of
foreign tourists in Florence each ye a r.According to
M a g h e ri n i , who has written a book on the subject,1
the ingredients are “an impressionable pers o n a l i t y,
the stress of travel and the encounter with a city like
Florence haunted by ghosts of the gr e at ,d e ath and
the pers p e c t i ve of history.”
Tourism picks up steam
The Stendhal syndrome is not the only
e x p e rience shared by modern cultural tourists and
wayfarers of the past.
In fact,there is nothing new about sightseeing.
Travel guides proliferated in Greek Antiquity, and
the Hellenistic wo r l d ’s taste for tourist at t r a c t i o n s
(m i ra b i l i a) was reflected in the invention of the Seve n
Wonders of the World.
Neither is souvenir hunting an invention of
m o d e rn trave l l e rs.The Greeks who consulted the
Oracle at Delphi or Dodona, like the medieva l
C h ristian pilgrims who trod the highways and
byways of Europe,bore relics in which there was a
profitable trade.
The dehumanizing effects of modern trave l ?
Long before cars and Concordes John Ruskin
condemned 30-m.p.h train travel as “a matter . . . to be
got through as soon as possible. It transmutes a man
from a traveller into a living parcel.” And even before
t h at ,William Wo r d swo rth had decried “ p i l grims of
fashion hurried along in their carriages”.
The tourist as a figure for satire? How about Mrs Clack
in Samuel Fo o t e ’s play A Trip to Calais ( 1 7 7 6 ) , who wa s
amazed at how well the French spoke French?
I n t e r a c t i ve tourist guides? As early as the 1840s Karl
Baedeker was urging readers of his handbooks to wri t e
in with their suggestions for future issues.
The list could go on.
Who was the first cultural tourist? Ulysses?
Alexander the Great? Julius Caesar? Perhaps they, l i k e
the Venetian merchant Marco Polo and the gr e at
voyagers of the European Renaissance who journeyed
“to make Christians and seek spices”, were essentially
business trave l l e rs.The gr e at 14th-century Arab trave l l e r
Ibn Batutah is a stronger candidate. He covered some
120,000 km in the Islamic countries and went as fa r
afield from his birt h p l a c e , Ta n gi e r , as China and
S u m at r a , “for the joy of learning about new countri e s
and new peoples”.
More recent cultural trave l l e rs were the sprigs of
the English ari s t o c r a cy who went on the Grand To u r
of continental Europe, a flexible itinerary usually
including visits to Pa ris and the main Italian cities.w UNESCO Courier journalist

The p i o n e e rs
w Roy Malkin
Once upon a time there were tra v e l l e rs. . . .
T h e n , in the 19th century, a ferment of 
social and economic change ushered 
in the tourist re v o l u t i o n

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
According to Thomas Nugent, author of The Gra n d
To u r ( 1 7 4 9 ) , this was a custom “visibly tending to
e n rich the mind with know l e d g e , to rectify the
j u d g m e n t , to remove the prejudices of educat i o n ,
to compose the outward manners , and in a wo r d
f o rm the complete gentleman”. O t h e rs we r e
sceptical about this optimistic ideology.
In the late 18th century the industrial revo l u t i o n
c r e ated a new market for trave l : i m p r oved roads
d r a m atically shortened journey times; i n d u s t ri a l
expansion generated gr e ater wealth and a new
r e s e rvoir of potential trave l l e rs in towns and cities;
t i m e - r e g u l ated forms of work brought with them the
concepts of leisure and va c at i o n .The modern touri s t
is a child of the steam age in Europe and Nort h
A m e ri c a .
S t e a m - d ri ven vessels began to link Dover and
Calais in 1821, and by 1840 an estimated 100,000
t r ave l l e rs were using them annually. In the same
year the steamship B ri t a n n i a crossed the A t l a n t i c
in 14 day s. S t e a m e rs started to ply the Rhine in
1 8 2 8 , the Rhône and the Danube a few ye a rs lat e r.
A b ove all, the spread of railway systems speeded up,
democratized and extended the range of travel.



Going by the book
The new tourists needed more guidance,
solicitude and organization than their more
independent and privileged predecessors. By the
mid-19th century a tourist industry compri s i n g
t r avel agents, g u i d e b o o k s , package tours , h o t e l s ,
r a i lways and timetables, duly emerged to prov i d e
them with protected modes of trave l .Three key
figures in this process were the British and Germ a n
p u b l i s h e rs ,r e s p e c t i vely John Murr ay (1808-1892)
and Karl Baedeker (1801-1859), and the Bri t i s h
travel agent Thomas Cook (1808-1892).
Dozens of volumes of travel writing existed to
a c c o m p a ny the Grand To u ri s t , but they had tended
to be rambling and opinionated accounts of their
authors’ own travels. For the new kind of traveller,
such idiosyncratic writings became obsolete. In the
1 8 4 0 s , they were replaced by red-covered Murr ay s
and Baedekers , which were standardized in form at ,
regularly updat e d , and designed to fit easily into
hand or pocket. B a e d e k e r , whose aim was to gi ve
t r ave l l e rs enough inform ation to dispense with paid
(human) guides, made incognito journeys to check
the reliability of his inform at i o n .He also used “ s t a rs ”
to rank sights and hotels. In fact the red guides, l i k e
some of their modern successors , h ave been
criticized for presenting a monumental heritage of
s t a rred attractions divorced from the real life of the
land and people that had created them and gave
them their meaning.
B a e d e k e r ’s publicat i o n s , which covered most of
E u r o p e , became so popular that Kaiser Wilhelm of
G e rm a ny was quoted as saying that he stat i o n e d
himself at a particular palace window each noon
because “ I t ’s written in Baedeker that I watch the
c h a n ging of the guard from that window, and the
people have come to expect it.”
The emblematic figure of a tourist industry
organized with bu r e a u c r atic efficiency to satisfy a
( r e l at i vely) democratized tourist market is T h o m a s
C o o k , who saw tourism as opening unprecedented
o p p o rtunities for people to enrich themselve s
culturally and morally by excursions to other
c o u n t ri e s. After starting out in 1841 by organizing
cheap train travel for English working men, he soon
went upmarket and by 1865 was escorting to Italy
“ c l e r g y m e n ,p hy s i c i a n s ,b a n k e rs , civil engi n e e rs and
m e r c h a n t s.”
Cook was often referred to as a gr e at general, t h e
“Napoleon of excurs i o n s ” , and military and
i m p e rialistic ove rtones of modern tourism (inva s i o n s ,
a rm i e s ,hordes) accompanied his career.To u ri s m ,s o m e
a r g u e d , was like imperi a l i s m : it might bring money
and commercial benefits but it would also sustain a
system of exploitation and oppression. C o o k ’s firm
b e c a m e , for instance,a crucial agent of British military
and administrat i ve authority in Egypt. It was said that
“the nominal suzerain of Egypt is the Sultan; its real
suzerain is Lord Cromer. Its nominal gove rnor is the
K h e d i ve ; its real gove rnor . . . is Thomas Cook and
S o n ” .
Cook and his “excursionists” were attacked by
traditionalists as hurried observe rs , v i s i b l e
r e p r e s e n t at i ves of a modernity that was bri n gi n g
i n t ru s i ve crowds into formerly self-sufficient villages,
t owns and regions and we aving them into a gr ow i n g
web of alien economic and social forces. M o r e
s c u rrilously it was implied that the new touri s t s ,
“red-nosed people carrying red books in their
h a n d s ” , we r e , almost by virtue of travelling in a
c e rtain organized way, not only incapable of
aesthetic response but in some way responsible for
p r o faning the sanctity of the monuments they
visited.Speed was associated with superficiality.
Which brings us back to the Stendhal syndrome.
Magherini has described how contact with artistic
m a s t e rpieces can bring to the surface repressed
emotional experi e n c e s , thus deepening self-
k n ow l e d g e . In other words it is a reminder that the
longest journeys are still, as they always were and
will be,in the mind. n
