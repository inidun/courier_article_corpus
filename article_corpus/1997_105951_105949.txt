GREEN WATCH
by France Bequette
"As the expression of the
direct affinity between civi¬
lization and nature, and as a place of
enjoyment suited to meditation or
repose, the garden thus acquires the
cosmic significance of an idealized
image of the world, a 'paradise' in the
etymological sense of the term, and
yet a testimony to a culture, a style,
an age, and often to the originality of
a creative artist." So says the Charter
of Florence, which was drawn up in
1981 by the International Commit¬
tee on Historic Gardens and Sites, a
specialist organ of ICOMOS, the Inter¬
national Council on Monuments and
Sites (see ¡tage 46).
Gardening is a universal art. In
the Bible the Garden of Eden was
created by God and tended by
Adam, a place of delight to which he
longed to return after he had been
expelled from it. In the Qur'an, par¬
adise is a garden rich in pastures,
fountains, trees and delicious fruit.
In the arid desert, verdant oases are
watering places that make life pos-
sihle. In China, the fabulous K'un-
lun mountains of the west, the gate¬
way to heaven, were festooned with
hanging gardens.
Unlike agriculture, which has a
utilitarian purpose, gardening imposes
a certain order on turbulent and
unpredictable nature. This is what
the park at Versailles has in common
with a Japanese garden. "A garden,"
writes Belgian horticultural specialist
René Pcchère, "is a composition. It is
always artificial. . . ."It is a mirror of
the society which creates it.
Places of power and holiness
History offers many examples of
rulers who wanted a magnificent
park to provide a setting for their
palaces and express their power. The

Greek historian and philosopher
Xenophon wrote admiringly of the
paradise garden designed and culti¬
vated by Cyrus the Younger (in
about 420 B.C.), king of Persia. Lo\e
of gardens was at the core of the
Persian world-view. Not only was gar¬
dening a part of the education of
princes, it was taught to all school¬
boys. Two hundred years earlier, one
of the seven wonders of the world,
the hanging gardens of Babylon,
were planted on stepped terraces by
Nebuchadrezzar II for his Persian-
born wife, who missed the gardens of
her native land.
Greece's rocky soil, warm climate
and lack of water were not very pro¬
pitious for gardening, and in any case
luxuriant pleasure gardens associated
with ¡lower and personal prestige
would probably not have gone down
well with a people enamoured of
democracy. Gymnasia (schools) were
established in Athenian parks for the
common good. Plato shared a garden
with his students and established the
Academy there. The sacred groves
familiar to the Greeks of Antiquity
were wildernesses where divinities
took refuge, and as a result were left
untouched by human hand.

Versailles Palace
(France).
Egyptian gardens blended plea¬
sure with productivity (wine, fruit,
vegetables and papyrus). Exotic
trees and flowers were imported very
early on and enriched the country's
natural plantlife. Gardens were laid
out in geometric patterns imposed
by the presence of irrigation ditches.
A scale model of a garden with abun¬
dant plantlife, found in the tomb of
Meket-Re in Thebes (1700 B.C.),
shows a garden with a rectangular
layout, surrounded by high walls
that protected it from the desert
sands and the Nile flood.
In ancient Rome gardens were
made within the confines of villas.
This example was followed in
Europe during the Middle Ages. In
those troubled times city dwellers
planted their gardens inside rather
than outside the town walls, and
lords made gardens in the courtyards
of their castles, where women grew
vegetables and medicinal herbs, as
did monks in monastery gardens.
These enclosed places contrasted
with cemeteries, which at that time
were public meeting places where
behaviour was free and easy, if not
licentious. Located as they were next
to churches, cemeteries continued
until the 18th century lo enjoy their
medieval status as extra-territorial
zones where the right of asylum asso¬
ciated with the church building was
still enjoyed.
The Islamic heritage
In Spain, the Arabs began to create
pleasure gardens in the 8th century.
Thousands of them appeared in
Andalusia. The Moorish gardens of
Granada the Alhambra and the
Generalife are still among the most
beautiful in the world. In compli¬
ance with strict geometric patterns,
they were divided into four quar-

ters, representing the four elements.
This pattern, often symbolically fea¬
tured on carpets, was also found
among the Moguls of India. In the
15th century the Muslim sultan
Tamberlaine (Timur-Lang) used it in
Samarkand. The vast extent of their
gardens gave his successors real con¬
trol of the land, and were invested
with divine power by making the
desert bloom.
In Italy during the same period
gardens acquired a reputation for
sensuality. They were places for cel¬
ebrations, friendly meetings and
intellectual and sexual freedom.
They provided an image of a well
tempered, well ordered universe in
an eternal spring. Water played the
major role in these Renaissance gar¬
dens. Carefully trimmed evergreen
shrubs were sometimes used as
mazes. Marble statuary from Antiq¬
uity had still not been dethroned by
flowers.
The triumph of geometry
Italian artists who travelled through
Europe inspired "French" gardens
where architecture took pride of
¡dace over nature. Very strict geo¬
metric perspectives were used to
show buildings to their best advan¬
tage. The gardens at Versailles,
designed by André Le Nôtre, were
inspired by the sun-symbol chosen
by King Louis XIV, the main axes
corresponding to the points of the
compass. Flower beds edged with
trimmed box hedges were planted.

served as inspiration for the town

Towards the end of the 18th cen¬
tury, the French garden came to be
seen as too artificial and gave way to
the English landscaped park style.
Lovers of poetry and painting for¬
sook straight lines in favour of "nat¬
ural" landscapes composed of hills,
woods, ponds and waterfalls. The
Romantics liked their paintings to
include ruins and mausoleums. The
garden became a theatre set,
expressing the aspirations of 18th-
century man in search of knowledge.
Landscaped gardens:
the Désert de Retz
The Désert de Retz, some 20 kilo¬
metres west of Paris, is an astonish¬
ing example of this in France (the
word "désert" here being used to
designate an isolated, "deserted"
place). It is a landscaped garden
which François Racine de Monville
began to create on a 40-hectare site
in 1774.
In a vale in the heart of Marly
Forest, he built a house in the form
of an ancient ruined column 15
metres in diameter. Visitors enter
the park through a grotto which
leads them on a kind of initiatory

journey from the outside world into
the "Désert". The park, which has
an "English-style" layout, contains
an open theatre and 17 small struc¬
tures or "fabriques": an Egyptian-
style obelisk and pyramid, a temple
dedicated to the Greek god Pan and
a votive altar and a tomb evoking
ancient Rome. A Tartar tent stands
on an "Island of Happiness", and
beside a pond there is a Chinese
house with outhouses and an
enclosed garden, reflecting ideas of
China current in France at that time.
This high spot of the Enlighten¬
ment attracted visitors from all over
the world. Thomas Jefferson, for
example, architect and future Pres¬
ident of the United States, took
inspiration from it for the Univer¬
sity of Virginia in Charlottesville*.
Visionary film-maker Abel Gance
chose it as a setting for one of his
films. The surrealists were fasci¬
nated by its mystery.
Perhaps gardens are a synthesis
of all art forms. René Pechère
believes that a garden is "architec-

ture by virtue of its composition;
sculpture via the art of landscaping;
painting via the effect of coloured
trees; music through the rhythms
of its composition; poetry, theatre
and even dance".
Our round-the-world garden tour
will be continued in the next issue.
