To w a rds an ethics o f t o u r i s m

With pre s s u re on sites and cultures set to rise in the coming years, initiatives are multiplying 
to reduce tourism’s negative impacts and promote awareness at all levels
As glossy travel catalogues thicken by the year
and U.S. companies take reservations from
citizens hoping to become the first touri s t s
in outer space,concerted efforts are on the rise to
make the industry—and the traveller—more res-
ponsible.
O ver the past few months, the World To u ri s m
O r g a n i z ation (WTO) has been consulting NGOs,
businesses and gove rnments to draw up a Global
Code of Ethics for To u rism that will be presented
to its General Assembly in Santiago, C h i l e , in Sep-
tember 1999.“There are many vo l u n t a ry codes of
conduct produced by associations and companies
but there is really a demand from all the part n e rs in
the tourism industry for one simple reference that
could be a base for all other initiat i ve s ,” e x p l a i n s
W TO secretary-general Francesco Frangi a l l i .S u c h
codes aim to put forward guidelines that prov i d e
the industry and other stakeholders with an ove r a l l
f r a m e work for applying sustainable tourism prac-
t i c e s.
The first article sets the tone: “The actors in
tourism development and tourists themselves are
duty-bound to observe the social and cultural tra-
ditions and practices of all peoples, including nat i o-
nal minorities and indigenous people.” The code
condemns the “exploitation of other people in any
f o rm , notably sexual”and stresses that tourism poli-
cies should benefit local communities, c o n t ri bute to
p r e s e rving and embellishing heri t a g e , and allow
traditional crafts and folklore to flo u ri s h .A mecha-
nism of implementation will be proposed for solving
potential conflicts betwe e n , for instance, a tour ope-
rator and a host community.
Contradictory interests
While the World Council of Churches and other
a s s o c i ations started to draw attention to the des-
tructive impact of tourism on local cultures in the
late 1960s, it is only over the past decade that the
subject has turned into a much broader debat e ,
p a rtly dictated by the steady gr owth in the number
of intern ational trave l l e rs. For the first time, in A p ri l
1999 tourism was featured on the agenda of the
United Nations Sustainable Development Com-
m i s s i o n , which gat h e rs eve ry year to discuss fol-
l ow-up to the Rio Earth Summit. R e p r e s e n t at i ves of
i n d u s t ry, local gove rn m e n t s , NGOs and trade
unions broadly agreed that mechanisms had to be
put in place to ensure that tourism deve l o p m e n t
was sustainable—i.e. t h at long-term social and env i-
ronmental benefits are placed ahead of short-term
gains—and underlined the critical role that local
governments have to play in defining projects and
assessing to what extent they benefit their consti-
tuencies.
Underlying these trends is the notion that tou-
rism cannot be simply considered as a commercial
activity gove rned by market cri t e ri a .“ N ational tou-
rism policies have to be developed by multidiscipli-
n a ry teams that not only include tour operat o rs bu t
also archaeologi s t s , a n t h r o p o l o gi s t s , h i s t o rians and
g e o gr a p h e rs ,” s ays Doudou Diène, of UN E S C O’s
Division for Intercultural Projects. This strategy is
being promoted with WTO. C o n t r a d i c t o ry interests
m ay often be at stake.“ T h e r e ’s a strong lobby seeking
to cut down prices and taxe s ,” s ays Hervé Barr é ,o f
UN E S C O’s touri s m , culture and development pro-
gr a m m e . “On the other hand, c u l t u r e , from an eco-
nomic standpoint needs the price of entry tickets to
be high enough in order to cover costs.”
‘Respect makes for 
the best of encounters’
U l t i m at e l y, both pri vate and public sectors have a
role to play in safeguarding heritage and cultures
and also in educating visitors. In 1988, the Wo r l d
Tr avel and To u rism Council launched a video seri e s
aimed at airlines and schools starring a cartoon cha-
racter who returns from extinction to help creat e
awareness of the impact of tourism on the env i r o n-
m e n t .The British NGO To u rism Concern has pro-
duced its first inflight video that highlights concern s
Gambians have about touri s m . It has also made a
video for secondary schools, which examines the
c o u n t ry as a destination through the eyes of adve rt i-
s e rs ,t o u rists and local people.“ U l t i m at e l y, we ’d like
to believe that someone going on holiday could make
real choices by taking the most ethical product, bu t
t h at ’s still a long way in coming,” s ays Pat ricia Bar-
n e t t , head of  To u rism Concern .
There are signs of change.At the World To u ri s m
Fair held in March in Pa ri s , the French tour opera-
tor Atalante presented the “ Tr ave l l e r ’s Ethical Char-
t e r ” .A f firming that “respect makes for the best of
e n c o u n t e rs ” , it provides advice on photogr a p h i n g,
d r e s s , gi f t s , t i p p i n g, e nvironmental protection and
ways to help the local economy.
Atalante is the first to know that educating the
t r aveller is not so simple, no matter how much pre-
p a r ation is invested in a tri p.A few ye a rs ago, b e f o r e
leaving on an excursion to Ethiopia’s Omo Valley,
Atalante obtained tacit approval from trave l l e rs that
they would not take pictures of local tribes ri g h t
upon arri va l . On the spot howe ve r , a few could sim-
ply not refrain. . . . nw UNESCO Courier journalist
