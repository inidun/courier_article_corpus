Vadaj is a desolate place about 40 km
from the historic city of Baroda in
I n d i a ’s Gujarat stat e .D u ring the sum-
mer months the baked earth cracks in the
h e at . When the monsoon comes, v i l l a g e rs
perch on the furniture like chickens to avo i d
the rising wat e rs.After the floods have subsi-
d e d ,the waterlogged clay soil is impenetrable,
trapping cattle and people alike. For the past
four ye a rs , the tin shacks of Vadaj have been
home for dozens of families forced to leave
their ancestral village to make way for the
giant reservoir of the controve rsial Sardar
S a r ovar dam on the Narmada ri ve r.
These “ o u s t e e s ” could even count
t h e m s e l ves lucky. According to a report by
N a rmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), a
pressure group fighting the Narmada project,
when the Bargi dam was finished in 1990,
over 1,000 km upstream in Madhya Pradesh,
the 114,000 people from 162 villages in the
p ath of the flo o d wat e rs were simply jettisoned
with nowhere to go. The gove rn m e n t , s ay s

N B A , offered no resettlement land and only
minimal cash compensat i o n .M a ny of these
v i l l a g e rs , s ays the report , n ow have menial
jobs in the slums of Ja b a l p u r , the main city in
the regi o n .
The plight of the Vadaj oustees could
be shared by over 300,000 others as
c o n s t ruction moves slowly ahead on the 30
large dams, 150 medium and 3,000 smaller
dams in a vast project that will transform
the Narmada into a staircase of reservoirs
and turbines. For the past 15 ye a rs , t h e
backlash of opposition from NBA, a
coalition of local people’s move m e n t s
opposed to the different dams, has been
challenging the view of development that
these dams promote. NBA argues that the
b e n e fic i a ries of the project will be city dwe l-
l e rs , not the rural communities forced to
leave their homes in the flooded valley.
O ver 80 per cent of India’s rural house-
holds have no electricity—and little hope of
e ver being connected to the electricity gri d —
according to A ru n d h ati Roy, the acclaimed
Indian author who has recently championed
N B A ’s stru g g l e . She says the increased food
t h at the dams’i rri g ation canals may produce
will be destined for export , doing little to feed
the nat i o n ’s poor. In 1995, she say s , some 30
million tons of unsold grain were stockpiled
in state gr a n a ri e s , while 350 million Indians
still live below the pove rty line.W h at is more,
most of the people affected by the Narm a d a
p r o j e c t , s ays NBA, are tribal communities,
fishing villages and Dalits (the so-called
“ o p p r e s s e d ”l ower stratum of the Hindu caste
s y s t e m ) , who already benefit least from
I n d i a ’s prosperi t y.
The notion of dam building as a pri m e
technology solution to development is not
n e w. Back in the 1940s, just after Indepen-
d e n c e ,P rime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru saw
dams as “the Temples of Modern India”.T h e
N a rmada Valley Development Project wa s
to be a showcase for this vision.Although this
p a rticular project stayed on the draw i n g
board for over 30 ye a rs , mostly because of
disputes over water rights between the three
s t at e s — M a d hya Pradesh, Maharashtra and
G u j a r at—through which the Narmada flow s ,
India went on to build some 3,600 dams.
Coupled to the Green Revolution of the
1 9 6 0 s , these dams provided massive irri-
g ation systems that have underpinned a
fourfold increase in food production.And
similar prospects are being heralded for the
N a rmada dams. According to offic i a l
fig u r e s , the Sardar Sarovar dam, the last
and largest of the dams before the ri ve r
reaches the Arabian Sea, will provide wat e r
for 20-30 million people all year round,
especially in the arid areas of Kutch, Sau-
rashtra and the state of Rajasthan. At the
same time, the 138.6-metre multi-purp o s e
dam is scheduled to produce 1,450 MW of
hy d r o e l e c t ric powe r , while its reservo i r
should smooth out the yearly seesaw of
floods and droughts, protecting some
400,000 people.
World Bank withdrawal
NBA contests just about all the official
statistics on the future benefits of the pro-
ject. It also questions the very principle of
the dams from the point of view of deve-
lopment.Led by Medha Patkar,a sociolo-
gist originally from Bombay, NBA argues
that the benefits will never justify the irre-
versible loss of forest, fisheries, farmland,
culture and livelihood for the hundreds of

In August 1999, protesters campaigning against the building of a dam on the Narmada River in India were
ready to drown themselves in the rapidly rising monsoon waters.

In Khoteswar, a temple still used in 1998 has since been submerged, a direct consequence of the Sardar Sarovar dam. 
thousands of displaced people. Some 30
million people depend directly or indirectly
on the 1,312-km-long river and its valley,
with its fertile fa rm l a n d , h i s t o ric temples
and pilgrimage routes.
In 1986, a year after the World Bank lent
$450 million to construct Sardar Sarova r ,
NBA commissioned a series of impact
assessment studies that , it claims, e x p o s e d
c rucial flaws in the official cost-benefit ana-
lyses for the entire project.But at the heart of
N B A ’s campaign is the apparent lack of
resettlement provision for oustees. W i t h
mounting intern ational support , NBA wa s
able to force a review of the Narmada pro-
j e c t . In 1991 the World Bank commissioned
an independent inquiry,whose report essen-
tially endorsed the NBA claims, s aying that
there had been “no proper appraisal” of the
p r o j e c t ’s impact. Two ye a rs lat e r , in an
unprecedented about-turn , the World Bank
withdrew from the scheme.
In 1994, I n d i a ’s Supreme Court upheld
a case presented by NBA, freezing all
construction on the Narmada dams until
the state gove rnments carried out adequat e
impact assessments.NBA insists that there
must be no displacement if there are no
realistic plans for resettlement. With the
exception of Sardar Sarova r , none of the
dam projects had any resettlement plans,
s ays the organizat i o n . NBA is adamant that
it is not opposed to the development that
the dams promise. It is also looking for a
compromise solution, calling for the final
height of the dams to be reduced.The lowe r
the final height, the fewer people will be
forced to move to make way for the reser-
voirs and the less land will be lost.
Rally in the valley
Although it now seems unlikely that
N B A ’s actions will stop the dams, the orga-
nization has brought the issue of resettle-
ment to the fore.In 1998 the Madhya Pra-
desh gove rnment set up a task force to look
at resettlement possibilities. It found that
not only was there no land in Madhya Pra-
desh to house oustees but that the land pro-
mised by Gujarat either did not exist, o r
was of too poor quality. Madhya Pradesh
has now called for a new eva l u at i o n .T h e
s t ate of Gujarat , h owe ve r , has dug in its
h e e l s. Not only did it refuse to allow the
independent World Commission on Dams,
set up by the World Bank (see page 10), to
visit the Sardar Sarovar site, it also challen-
ged the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling.In
Fe b ru a ry 1999, after a four-year morat o-
rium,the Supreme Court reversed its ear-
lier decision, a l l owing construction to begi n
again at Sardar Sarovar,adding a further 5
metres to the 80 metres already built.
NBA has now reinforced its stru g g l e ,
organizing a series of passive sit-ins and
hunger strikes. At the end of July last year
A ru n d h ati Roy organized a “Rally in the
Va l l e y ” , marching with 400 other public
figures and supporters from village to vil-
lage in the affected area. An estimat e d
10,000 oustees joined the rally in the fert i l e
Nimad region of Madhya Pradesh, where
the local fa rm e rs will lose their land if
c o n s t ruction goes ahead. And when the
monsoon rains began in August 1999,
Medha Patkar and other NBA members
took up positions in the village of Dom-
khedi,refusing to move as the flood waters
rose up to their shoulders. Police in boats
finally removed them. At the end of last
ye a r , A ru n d h ati Roy published a closely-
documented essay entitled “The Great e r
Common Good” in Outlook m a g a z i n e ,c ri-
ticizing the Narmada Valley project both in
principle and in its application.
As the mud flies between NBA and
s u p p o rt e rs of the project, the withdrawa l
of the World Bank could have unpredic-
table effects in the longer term.With most
i n t e rn ational aid programmes now
unwilling to be associated with the dams,
the deve l o p e rs are looking for pri vate sector
f u n d i n g . This could be much harder to
i n fluence than an institution such as the
World Bank, which has a “ wo rt hy ” image to
protect. ■
