begun to realize over the ye a rs that wo m e n
attending and running literacy classes don’t
a lways share these views.The aid agencies
intent on finding linkages between wo m e n ’s
l i t e r a cy rates and development indicat o rs
such as child mort a l i t y, f e rtility and nutri t i o n
tended to use the words “ e d u c at i o n ”a n d
“ l i t e r a cy ”i n t e r c h a n g e a b l y. On a micro leve l ,
they often eva l u ated literacy progr a m m e s
through calculating the percentage of wo m e n
who went on to join savings and credit gr o u p s
or the number of families who built lat ri n e s.
My own impression was that these wo m e n
attending classes (as well as their teachers )
were less convinced about the deve l o p m e n t
outcomes associated with literacy and made
more distinction between “ l i t e r a cy”and “ e d u-
c at i o n ” . Whereas the latter took place in
schools and enabled their children to gain
good jobs and stat u s , the women regarded

Laxmi was on her way to an adult literacy class,

school as a youngster—though her brothers

on reading and wri t i n g . By calling hers e l f
“ green cucumber”, she referred to the com-
mon Nepalese say i n g,“ W hy eat green cucum-
ber at the time of dying?”Becoming literat e —
like eating cucumber in this area—is both a
l u x u ry and a challenge at this late stage of life.

women like Laxmi go to such trouble to learn
to read and wri t e , and what they feel they have
gained from the classes.This period was ve ry

wanted and the progr a m m e ’s contents.O f t e n
this resulted in many dropping out but it wa s

approach to convey messages and skills
directly relevant to development activities.To

third world woman gr ateful to learn to read

These women already knew about fa m i l y

as account keeping or writing letters ,but often
just to feel educated like their husbands and
c h i l d r e n .
Ironic joking
It was the desire to reflect these wo m e n ’s
p e rs p e c t i ves that led me to conduct more
in-depth research. I chose to focus on two
contrasting programmes in differing areas
of Nepal. The classes in We s t e rn Nepal
( A rutar) were run by an intern ational aid
a g e n cy which used the literacy class as a way
of forming wo m e n ’s micro-credit gr o u p s.
The programme near Kathmandu (in Lalit-
pur district) was organized by a small local
NGO which developed its own lesson sheets
linking literacy skills to health awareness.
In both cours e s , which were run by local
s t a f f, the lessons were designed to gi ve
health messages through stories about vil-
lage women who did or did not follow
recommended practices. S e veral of the older
women challenged the messages and ironi-
cally countered the images of ignorant vil-
lage women port r ayed in the stori e s : 


N a n i
[ l i t e ra cy trainer] was explaining that a cert a i n
type of wo rm was on “ s a g ”(a kind of spinach)
and that if one eats it raw,one gets infe c t e d .T h e
women laughed “ W h at can you do if yo u ’re in
the fields all day cutting paddy and you see some
nice sag gr ow i n g. No time to cook it—just eat
it and get wo rm ” .Then Nani talked about hook
wo rms and said you catch this wo rm if you go to
the toilet with no shoes on.The woman laughed
and joked,“ We don’t have to wo rry about that
o n e — we don’t have any toilets to go to any-
way! We just go in the stream.” The group of
older women cackled away and then the joker
turned her attention to me:“What can I do—
e at or study? How can I cut paddy, d ry it all
d ay and then come to study? My arms are
aching, I’m tired out.”
As Nani was an older experienced fa c i-
l i t at o r , she could handle the wo m e n ’s sar-
c a s m ,s y m p athizing with those who were too
tired to study. But the younger girls who ran
classes found the discussion style daunting
and resorted to chanting of alphabet letters
i n s t e a d .A further issue was around language:
the course was written in Nepali, p a rtly in
response to the younger women who saw
flu e n cy in the latter as opening more doors
to them than their local tongue, N e wa ri .
H owe ver the older women insisted that the
up the hill for the big meeting of six wo m e n ’s gr o u p s
will you? They explained that each group had to
appoint a leader and that person had to attend a
meeting of all the local wo m e n ’s gr o u p s. . . . S a n-
s a ra wanted to send her daughter in her place as
she could read and wri t e ,but this was not allo-
we d . I later discovered that Sansara had a good
mental record of all the loans taken by gr o u p
m e m b e rs ,r e p ayment schedules and interest
owe d , but that these details were not wri t t e n
d ow n .The group members preferred their
traditional oral practices or to rely on yo u n-
ger family members , but the agency was keen
t h at they should adopt new practices of wri t-
ten account keeping and agenda setting,e ve n
if in reality these were less accurat e .
In both, the A rutar and Lalitpur classes,
the women encouraged the teachers to spend
time on chanting the texts in unison and
copying out wo r d s ,r ather than the more crea-
t i ve discussion approach in which they had
been trained.Though the women disputed
fa c i l i t at o rs conduct the class in Newa ri ,s o
in practice there was a mixture of both.
Hierarchical relationships
In A ru t a r , the literacy course was a direct
e n t ry point into wo m e n ’s group activities
around sav i n g s , credit and income genera-
t i o n .The women were expected to use the
l i t e r a cy skills to keep accounts, minutes of
meetings and write report s. Although the
women recognized that the deve l o p m e n t
a g e n cy presented a rare opportunity for secu-
ring a loan, they disputed many of its ideas
i n d i r e c t l y — e ven the assumed link betwe e n
l i t e r a cy and income generat i o n .When I inter-
v i e wed Sansara, the treasurer of the A ru t a r
wo m e n ’s group (also mother of seve n ) ,s h e
explained that her role was to look after the
record books: I asked her wh at was in them and
she said she had no idea.Other people write in it
and she just has to carry them to the meetings.
Her daughter said,you wo n ’t have to carry them

‘What can I do—eat or study?
How can I cut paddy, dry it all
day and then come to study?’
In Arutar, low-caste women who learn to read and write are often more strongly motivated by a desire 
to improve self-esteem than the need to keep accounts.

the teacher’s authority in relation to the deve-
lopment ideas, they welcomed a more hie-
rarchical relationship where they called the
teacher “ M i s s ” ,a n swered the register and imi-
t ated the kind of education they had seen in
local schools. A l i n a , the A rutar fa c i l i t at o r ,
responded by treating the women (who we r e
much older than she) as school children,e ve n
though she knew well the constraints wo m e n
faced as they were her neighbours :
A l i n a : Did you understand it? I said so
much myself I don’t know if you unders t o o d .
To m o rr ow don’t bring any children.And study
at home.
All the women laugh—no time.
A l i n a : If you can’t study,h ow can I teach?
Go home and study in any free moment yo u
have,here and there.
So what did women gain from literacy
c l a s s e s ? Although many women challenged
the teaching methods, language of instru c-
tion or course content, their ve ry presence at
the classes suggested that they still saw some-
thing to be gained from literacy.As time we n t
o n , I realized that what they valued in the
e x p e rience was less tangible than the skills of
keeping written accounts or reading about
wo rm s. When I talked to Sansara, t h e
wo m e n ’s group treasurer, she was keen to
s h ow me the part of the records book where
the women had signed their names. I noticed
on another page that there were only thumb
p rints—these were the marks of their hus-
bands who had attended in their place one
d ay.The fact that a wife could sign in place of
a thumb pri n t , when her husband could not,
i n d i c ated some important changes taking
p l a c e .S u rp ri s i n g l y,most men did not see this
as a threat to their authori t y, as they regarded
w riting as just one skill which one member of
the family needed. For the women howe ve r ,
signing their name constituted a new identity
as a “ l i t e r at e ” wo m a n .When I attended the
annual parents’ meeting at A rutar school, I
d i s c overed that the few women who came did
so partly to assert their identity in a public
arena through signing the regi s t e r.
A private space
An incident that I observed at the A ru t a r
l i t e r a cy class made me realize that some
women were beginning to use literacy for their
own purp o s e s : I sat next to Misra and glanced
at her book—she had written something about
h e rs e l f.She covered it with her hand when she saw
me looking.Alina [teacher] asked her wh at she
had written—something that was in my mind,
she answe r e d .But still she refused to show it.I wa s
i n t rigued to think that Misra—the husband
who refused to let her come to the literacy class
r e g u l a r l y — was now perhaps expressing her-
self through wri t i n g . It seemed that wri t i n g
(and reading) might provide a pri vate space
for women to reflect on their experi e n c e s.F u r-
ther proof of this are some of the articles and
s t o ries written by women published as a fol-
l ow-up to the literacy course (see box ) .
So whose agenda should determine the
kind of programmes on offer? The link being
made between literacy and inform ation on
h e a l t h ,n u t rition or income generating through
the “ f u n c t i o n a l ” approach seemed to result
p ri m a rily from the aid agencies’ need to pro-
duce quantifiable results from literacy pro-
gr a m m e s. My experiences in Nepal show that
we , the “ d e ve l o p e rs ” ,h ave not taken time to
u n d e rstand where women are starting from,
and more import a n t l y,where they want to go.
They may already have knowledge about
n u t rition and skills in chicken-rearing and

they may not want to learn to write agendas
for meetings or accounts. Is the desire to wri t e
about your feelings as a low-caste woman or to
read religious books as justifiable as the more
concrete development aims? If women want to
i m i t ate a style of education provided in tradi-
tional village schools, should the aid agencies
be supporting this? 
Gains in self-confidence
The illustrations from Nepalese classrooms
d e m o n s t r ate that if women are not getting the
kind of literacy that they wa n t , they either drop
out or put pressure on class fa c i l i t at o rs to focus
on what they enjoy. Aid agencies need to
respond to this challenge and gi ve wo m e n
more direct control over what they learn and
h ow.This can be done by conducting initial
research into wo m e n ’s specific needs and inter-
e s t s : not eve ryone wants to write about their
l i ve s , just as some women may prefer to learn
h ow to write accounts.
L i t e r a cy programmes can be based on
wo m e n ’s own interests and an unders t a n d i n g
of the local context,r ather than a unive rsal ste-
reotype of an “ i l l i t e r at e ” wo m a n .E d u c at i o n
around issues such as family planning can
b e gin from a more critical approach that
encourages women to analyse their problems
and find ways to address them.L i t e r a cy - f o c u-
sed programmes are only beginning to draw
on such part i c i p at o ry planning approaches in
an attempt to provide support for wo m e n ’s
existing (rather than imagined or projected)
l i t e r a cy needs.The development outcomes of
such programmes might be more difficult to
e va l u ate than the numbers of savings gr o u p s
f o rmed or scores on a health knowledge test.
But the gains in wo m e n ’s self-confidence and
changes in social relationships should be long
lasting and eventually improve their quality of
l i f e . n
