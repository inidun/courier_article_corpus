I q a l u i t , the capital of the new Canadian terri t o ry of
Nunavut, to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, native
e n t r e p r e n e u rs themselves are increasingly show i n g
off their cultures—and profiting from it.This stands
in contrast to many other parts of the world where
indigenous communities have little control or eve n
s ay in tourist inflows that are having sometimes
huge impacts on their cultures and societies.
“While we have played a role in the touri s m
i n d u s t ry for ye a rs , we were somewhat margi n a-
l i z e d ,” s ays Barry Pa r k e r , president of the Canadian
N ational A b o ri ginal To u rism A s s o c i ation (CNATA ) .
“ We were thought of in terms of p ow wow s or other
cultural celebrations, or as ‘wilderness guides’ for
hunting and fishing.”
N at i ve entrepreneurs no longer merely stage
a b b r e v i at e d ,s i m p l i fied dance shows for tour gr o u p s
which quickly move on to other ersatz attractions,
or souvenir shops selling mass-produced trinkets.
To d ay, indigenous populations are providing trans-
p o rt ation services and accommodations while ope-
ning galleries, restaurants, theatres and even their
own homes.
Not all abori ginal communities in Canada or
Australia welcome touri s m .H owe ve r ,m a ny see it as
an important source of income. C N ATA is “ b o t t o m
line ori e n t e d ,” s ays Pa r k e r.“Our business is job crea-
tion and revenue creat i o n .” P r o m o t e rs say touri s m
also allows abori ginals to teach others about their
t r a d i t i o n s , thus helping strengthen indigenous
c u l t u r e .
Aboriginal Business Canada,a federal govern-
ment agency, cites tourism development as one of
its top three priorities.There are now about 1,000
Canadian abori ginal tourism businesses (i.e., bu s i-
nesses that are at least 51 per cent owned or
controlled by nat i ve people) generating up to some
$200 million in revenue per year, according to the
federal gove rn m e n t ’s Department of Indian A f fa i rs.
These companies provide about 15,000 jobs sea-
sonally and 7,500 year round.
Indigenous tourism has become so economically
i m p o rtant to both countries that gove rnments and
aboriginal peoples have established official groups
to promote and control the industry. Besides the
C N ATA , these include A b o ri ginal To u rism A u s-
t r a l i a , the National A b o ri ginal and To rres Strait
Islander Tourism Industry Strategy (NATSITIS)
and A b o ri ginal To u rism British Columbia (AT B C ) .
E ven Nunav u t , the new terri t o ry in nort h e rn
Canada, has its own tourism body, promoting the
Eskimo (Inuit) culture.

Australia has about 200 abori gi n a l - o p e r at e d
t o u rism bu s i n e s s e s , according to Graeme Pri e s t l e y,
who manages the federal gove rn m e n t ’s section res-
ponsible for developing aboriginal tourism.These
businesses are generating almost $20 million in
revenue per year,with sales in indigenous arts and
crafts amounting to an estimated $130 million
a n n u a l l y, according to the Australian Office of
N ational To u ri s m . P riestley believes that indige-
nous tourism could be a much more signific a n t
business opportunity for aboriginal people.
The gr owing revenues going back to their com-
munities mark progress for those aborigines who
want to encourage touri s m . But by their standards,
more can be done.The Canadian Tourism Com-
mission estimates that if aboriginal peoples shared
in the tourism industry in proportion to their popu-w Paris-based travel writer


M a s t e rs in their own tepees
w Garry Marchant
In Canada and A u s t ra l i a , aboriginal communities are taking control of tourism in their homelands.
An art gallery in Darwin,Australia,proudly spells out its aboriginal ownership.

l ation—four per cent of Canada’s total—abori gi n a l
t o u rism would bring in about $1 billion annually—
five times what it does today—and provide as many
as 40,000 jobs.
L i k e w i s e , despite progr e s s , A u s t r a l i a ’s abori-
gines still face several major obstacles to deve l o-
ping touri s m .To begin with, a b o ri ginal land claims
must be legally resolved.Without legal land titles,
a b o ri ginal people find it difficult to secure bank
loans to start up their bu s i n e s s e s.Also in short sup-
ply are the business skills needed to successfully
run a company.To try to fill these gaps, the gove rn-
ment has worked with aboriginal authorities to set
up a range of support i ve measures—from indivi-
dual grants to training programmes.
Hazel Douglas, a member of the Guguyalanji
tribe in the far north of Australia’s Queensland,is
fully aware of the difficulties of breaking into the
tourism trade. “When I started my business [five
ye a rs ago], people said,‘ O h ,s h e ’s just an abori gi n a l
l a d y, she’ll only last a couple of day s ,’ ” D o u g l a s
told The Australian newspaper. Today, her award-
winning bu s i n e s s ,N at i ve Guide Safa ri To u rs ,l e a d s
groups across the rugged terrain of the Daintree
rainforest, aWorld Heritage site, and Cape Tribu-
l ation National Pa r k .While recounting legends and
explaining traditional culture, she takes her gr o u p s
into the bush to show them how to eat the thirst-
quenching abdomens of live green ants—high in
vitamin C. She also teaches them how to fix snake-
bite with seaweed and how to listen to the bird calls
near the river to know whether a crocodile lies in
wa i t . For Douglas, the tour is more than just a bu s i-
n e s s. “The most important thing is to educat e
people about abori ginal culture and to preserve it,”
she says.
Pa rt of this educational task lies in dealing with
the stereotypes tourists expect to see during their
visits. “People still have the impression that we are
living in the past,” says Jeff Watts,a member of the
Tseshaht tribe in Canada who started his native
culture tour in Va n c o u ver last ye a r.When tourists ask
Watts to take them to a native Indian village, he
teases them by suggesting they hail down the next
covered wagon.
The abori ginal tourism offering is considerable.
In Canada, the possibilities include digging into
traditional indigenous fare at a Haida longhouse res-
taurant serving the likes of toasted seaweed, wild
Pacific sea asparagus, goat ribs and caribou; living
with Inuit families at an igloo camp or spending a
week on an Indian reserve sleeping in a longhouse
or tepee; searching for shaggy musk-ox ; or perhaps
learning drum dances and native games. In Aus-
tralia, one can take tours to aboriginal homelands
to learn how to use a boomerang, listen to native
dreamtime legends, visit an abori ginal emu fa rm or
take a day trip in the scrubs to look for spiny ant
eaters and kangaroo.
Spirituality is
not for sale
In many cases visitors to aboriginal lands have
to learn to live like locals, far away from modern
c o nve n i e n c e s. For example, in Canada, t o u ri s t s
may have to accept caribou hairs on their bannock
bread, while in remote parts of Australia, accom-
modation is in cement floor huts with only basic
washing facilities.
There is often a clash between expectations and
reality, with the result that sometimes tourists are
disappointed while their hosts are astounded by
o u t s i d e rs ’p e r c e p t i o n s. For example, one tour com-
p a ny reportedly received a complaint from a South
Australian tourist that the abori gines in the
M a nyalluk community wore T- s h i rts and short s
instead of loincloths.
Many aboriginal people are aware of possible
n e g at i ve effects of touri s m . In some instances entire
communities are off limits. In other cases, native
communities are controlling deve l o p m e n t ,p u t t i n g
sacred sites off limits and preventing public access
to some ceremonies.
“ E l d e rs generally welcome the opportunity to
share aspects of their cultures with others , but are ada-
mant that their spirituality is not for sale,” s ays CNA-
TA ’s Pa r k e r.“There are things that are not for others
to see or share.Mainstream tourism needs to know this
to ensure appropri at e , authentic products are deve-
loped and marketed with cultural sensitivity.”
E ven more important than the impact of touri s m
on the land is its effect on the people.Says Parker:
“No one wants to feel like they are fish in a fish bow l
or have people invade their space.” n
In Kaan,an Amerindian village in British Columbia (Canada), visitors can learn about the
significance of totems from local guides.
‘ T h e re are things 
that are not for others 
to see or share.
M a i n s t ream tourism needs
to know this to ensure
a p p ro p r i a t e, authentic pro d u c t s
a re developed and marke t e d
with cultural sensitivity.’
Travel broadens the
mind: one leaves
behind the prejudices
of one’s own country,
and one is hardly
qualified to take on
those of foreigners.

French writer and philosopher
(1689-1755)
