The World Heritage Convention, 
twenty years later, UNESCO, 1996
the idea of creating 
an international movement for protecting heritage 
emerged after World War i. 
the 1972 convention concerning the protection 
of the World cultural and Natural Heritage 
developed from the merging of two separate 
movements: the preservation of cultural sites 
and the conservation of nature.
