The top twenty
The table at right ranks countries in terms of their
share of world scientific output as measured by the
production of articles that appear in scientific publi-
c at i o n s1.There is remarkable continuity between the
t wo periods considered, with the same 20 countri e s
a p p e a ring on both lists.The United States accounts
for the lion’s share of scientific activity, p r o d u c i n g
more than one-third of all publications recorded by the
SCI dat a b a s e .There is howe ve r , strong competition
for the runner-up position.Although this is still held
by the UK, Japan inched up its share by 1.3% and Ger-
m a ny by 1.2%. In the lat t e r ’s case, u n i fic ation playe d
a part ,e ven though the GDR never accounted for 1%
of total output.
Taken as an entity, the European Union has
i m p r oved its position and has gained a competitive
e d g e : it succeeded in ove rtaking the U. S . ,with 35.9%
of all papers signed by an author with a European
address between 1990 and 1995, against 35.1% by
a U. S .a u t h o r. I n d i a ’s decrease is cause for concern
and could reflect an unfort u n ate draining of scientists
t owards the bu r e a u c r atic and political arena.


Data on the output of scientific publications show that the world’s
s c i e n t i fic hiera rchy has remained remarkably stable over the past decade,
with the continued domination of the U. S. - Ja p a n - E u rope triad
A global snapshot of scientific
Highs and lows
The table at right indicates those countries
which have shown the highest and the lowest
gr owth rate in terms of publication output.
Foreseeably, Asian countries come out in the top
p o s i t i o n s , s h owing impressive gr ow t h . S p a i n ’s
advance over the past decade is partly linked to its
i n t e gr ation into the programmes of va ri o u s
European organizat i o n s. The same holds for
Portugal and Greece. These three countries are
the only ones in Europe that posted significant
growth rates. In contrast, countries in transition
such as the Czech Republic and Russia show a
marked decline in output, as does India.

1.This overview of trends and patterns in world science is
based on the Scientific Citation Index (SCI) database
established for bibliographic purposes by the Institute for
Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia, USA.
Regarded as one of the most accurate reflections of where
countries stand in terms of research activity, the SCI
measures scientific output by the number of articles
published in scientific journals.The database provides
systematic coverage of the articles from the 2,500 most
cited scientific journals. It should also be stressed that data
tend to focus on basic rather than applied research or
technology. These data are used by other institutions,such
as the European Commission, which produces the
European Report on Science and Technology Indicators.

International collaboration
Figure at left shows the instances of co-
authorship between the three major producers of
scientific articles, namely the United States, the
European Union and Japan. It is worth noting
that output is practically equal in the U.S.and the
EU. Japan more often co-operates with the U.S.,
although other data indicate an increase in co-
authorships with the EU. Less than 20% of
papers in the U.S. and Japan are internationally
co-authored,a figure that reaches between 30 and
40% in the EU because of the links between
scientists from different European countries.
Data can also provide a more detailed insight
into how international collaboration evolves over
time. In one analysis, links between 14 countries2
were studied between 1985 and 1995 using the
Salton measure, which distinguishes we a k ,
medium and strong links. The change is striking:
whereas in 1985, only 7 countries, all developed
ones, had international co-operation links, all of
which were weak, in 1995, the picture was signi-
ficantly different.All 14 countries had internatio-
nal co-operation links with one or more coun-
tries, and in 7 cases, they were strong ones.
Although weak, the two developing countries in
the selection—Argentina and Mexico—both for-
ged links over this period.
I n t e rn ational co-authorship reflects more than
c o l l a b o r ation between individual scientists. I t
points to emerging part n e rships between the insti-
tutions behind the scientists, namely academia,
g ove rnment and industry. In developed countri e s ,
these are becoming the norm . In less deve l o p e d
o n e s , i n d u s t ry ’s part i c i p ation in the funding of
science is often extemely weak or non-existent,
h i n d e ring intern ational collaborat i o n . S o m e t i m e s ,
this is counterbalanced by the stat e , when public
science is recognized as an important engine of
economic progress in the global economy. n
