Tsevi Mazeh*: The beauty of the world
“Science cannot tell us why and what for, and in a sense science is limited
to the technical details of how the world works. I think there is no problem
with saying God was in the beginning, that God set the world rolling and
decided upon its rules. But as for the question of God interfering during the
history of the universe—that is something I believe, but which I do not
fully understand.
My religion [Orthodox Judaism] does not influence my work as an
astronomer, but it does make me appreciate God and the beauty of the
world. I have been teaching a course on binary stars, in which there is a
mathematical formula describing perfectly the stars’ motion.In my eyes it
is a miracle that the human mind can find such beautiful mathematical
tools to explain the motion of the world—I see that as one of the miracles
of the world that God created.
As for Chapter 1 of Genesis, you have to realize that it has a core and it
has details. The core is the theological message:there is one unified God.
When the Bible was written, this was a complete revolution and actually
doesn’t make sense when you look upon the world and see its forces
fighting each other. The writer of Genesis had to convey this message in
some cosmological terms, so he chose the cosmology of his day. He could
not mention the big bang, the speed of light or atoms. Instead, he spoke
in terms understandable to the people of that time.”
