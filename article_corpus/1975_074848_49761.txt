THE NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE 4
A single submarine
can destroy
any country
on earth

Four countries today possess missile-firing nuclear
submarines U.S.A., U.S.S.R., U.K. and France. Above,
three French nuclear submarines "Redoutable",
"Terrible" and "Foudroyant" at a rendezvous on the
high seas. As the so-called doctrine of "mutual
deterrence" escalates, an even more powerful type of
missile-firing submarine is being built. It will carry
24 multiple-warhead missiles with a range of 4,500 miles
and a total of over 400 warheads. Below left, this future
submarine monster, the U.S. Trident submarine to be
launched in 1979. Each Trident will cost $1 .8 billion, nearly
double the annual budget of a country such as Morocco.
Submarines that can fire nuclear missiles have
become the most deadly weapons system in
today's nuclear arsenal. According to SIPRI
Yearbook 1975, "World Armaments and
Disarmament", nearly 100 nuclear-missile
submarines were being operated in 1974 by four
countriesU.S.S.R. (48 submarines) U.S.A. (41)
U.K. (4) France (3). The latest type of nuclear
submarine can carry 16 missiles, each equipped
with 10 to 14 nuclear warheads, and has a



striking power of 160 to 224 warheads, each a
hydrogen bomb three times as powerful as the
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Released
independently after launching from under water
(photos right) the warheads could be directed to
separate targets 100 miles apart and over
1,000 miles away with an accuracy of a quarter of
a mile. As one specialist puts it: "One nuclear
submarine can destroy any country on earth."
Right, three phases in test launching of submarine-based
nuclear missiles. 1. Clothed in air bubbles, a missile
hurtles through the water from its launching tube.
2. Carrying a dummy multiple warhead, missile erupts
from waters of ocean test-range. Nuclear submarine's
extra tall antenna used for tests sticks out of water at
right. (3) Vapour pinwheel pattern forms in sky as missile
begins its powered flight.
