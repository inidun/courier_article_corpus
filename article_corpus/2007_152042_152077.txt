The days are long gone when 
Robert Capa and Henri Cartier 
Bresson roamed the world immor-
talizing the faces of Spanish repub-
licans, capturing the drama of D-
Day or the liberation of Paris in vivid 
images. Photojournalism now is 
enduring a profound crisis. For one, 
most newspapers have set up web-
sites and increasingly they resort to 
using amateur photos. Second, the 
sheer multiplication of available im-
ages has created inflation on inter-
net and caused prices to drop. The 
decline is further accentuated by 
the internet’s overtaking of paper 
media, affecting press publications 
on every continent. The result: the 
idea of cheap or even free infor-
mation is spreading. 
“Associating information with 
something available free of charge 
is dangerous,” warns Alain Fri-
let, editorial director of Magnum 
agency in Paris. “Because then 
we are no longer concerned with 
the content or with ethical crite-
ria.” Yet as Lorenzo Virgili, admin-
istrator for the Association Natio-
nale des Journalistes Reporters 
Photographes et Cinéastes, re-
minds us, “Amateur photo scoops 
have always existed.” The best-
known example is still the film 
of President John F. Kennedy’s 
assassination, made by a Dallas 
clothing manufacturer on 22 No-
vember 1963. Amateur shots of 
the Madrid (Spain) bombings in 
March 2004 and those in London 
(United Kingdom) in July 2005, 
have also circulated. “It isn’t a real 
threat to professional photogra-
phy, because it can’t replace its 
relevance,” continues Virgili. “But 
that’s on the condition it isn’t used 
simply to produce cheap editorial 
content, which is unfortunately 
more and more often the case. 
But if you point the finger at ama-
teur photography, you’ve picked 
the wrong target.”
True, internet has given the phe-
nomenon greater scope. Busi-
nesses have rushed into the gap, 
acting as intermediaries between 
amateur photographers and press 
editors. Fotofolia, for instance, 
a French image bank, receives 
some 20,000 photos a day and 
sells them at prices ranging from 
one to ten euros (half of which is 
theoretically paid to the photogra-
pher). 
In addition, the development of 
affordable digital equipment has 
changed the odds. Until now, 
photo reporting was reserved 
mainly for Western professionals 
who had access to cutting-edge 
technique and to the newspapers 
in industrialized countries. With 
digital, photographers in develop-
ing countries have emerged from 
the shadows. “Managing editors 
are saving money. They no longer 
send professionals all over the 
map because they know they can 
find a journalist on the spot who 
knows the place and owns a digi-
tal camera,” comments Leonardo 
Antoniadis, an Argentine photog-
rapher based in Paris. 
“Today, here’s the real question, 
what place do we want to give to 
images?” says Frilet. “Will media 
corporations take into account 
that photography is a source of in-
formation in itself? In France, 80% 
of photos used by magazines and 
daily papers are merely illustrating 
text.” On an international scale, 
only a few American magazines, 
opposing the tide, continue to as-
sign photo reporting. “The outlook 
is grim,” mourns Frilet. “For agen-
cies, 80% of photos sold to maga-
zines come from archives. Assign-
ments now account for only 10%.” 
“When Sebastião Salgado was 
shooting in the Sahel in the mid 
1980s, he was the only one 
denouncing famine used as a 
weapon of war, long before televi-
sion,” says Alain Mingam, photo-
journalist and former director of 
the French agencies Sygma and 
Gamma. “His photos definitely 
caused a massive change in peo-
ple’s awareness around the world. 
These days you’d go find a star 
and photograph them in that loca-

MEDIA UNDER ATTACK
A decisive shift to digital photography, increasing use of amateur snaps, 
mass distribution of images over internet:  
these realities have significantly altered photojournalism.  
Is it doomed to become extinct?

tion.” The consequence: “The bud-
get allocated to celebrity photos 
tends to be rising, at the expense 
of photo reportage.” An agency like 
Sipa currently makes two-thirds of 
its sales on celebrities. 
All these factors make photojour-
nalism precarious, and profession-
al photographers’ paycheques are 
shrinking. Forced to expand their 
field of activity, they turn to corpo-
rate annual reports. Furthermore, 
their rights are rarely defended. 
So? Is this the end of photojour-
nalism? In October 2006 at the 
war correspondents’ awards in 
Bayeux (Calvados, France), pho-
tojournalists showed they can rise 
to the challenge, as proven by the 
work of American Magnum pho-
tographer Chris Anderson on the 
war in Lebanon*. To go with his 
pictures, he presents his recorded 
observations, producing a three-
dimensional report that undoubt-
edly foreshadows a new style of 
internet magazine.
