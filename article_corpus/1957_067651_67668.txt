RABINDRANATH TAGORE
1 have fallen under the enchantment of lines'
Ir was 1928. Rabindranath Tagore stood
at the pinnacle of fame and success. He
was the Poet Laureate of Asia, the Sen¬
tinel of the East, Asia's first Nobel Prize
winner for Literature. His writings had
been translated into all the major languages
of the world. Honours had been heaped
upon him by learned societies and humble
institutions alike, and he was the subject of
a veritable cult in India and his native
Bengal. As poet, dramatist, essayist, short
story writer, musician, humanist, philoso¬
pher and educationist, his genius was uni¬
versally recognized.
Then, at the age of 67, Tagore felt an
irresistible urge for a new form of expres¬
sion. A latent genius long asleep within
him suddenly revealed itself, and the vener¬
able sage of India became a painter. For
twelve years he devoted his energy to
drawing and painting, little by little aban¬
doning his writer's pen. When he died in
1941 at the age of 80, he had produced
nearly 2,000 works of art, of extraordinary
design and strange rhythmic beauty.
The poet turned to painting when he dis¬
covered that his hand was moving automa¬
tically across the pages of his manuscripts,
transforming the scratches and erasures into

designs. "I have fallen under the enchant¬
ment of lines," he explained.
Rabindranath's scratches and erasures
took the form of thin horizontal threads
which he enclosed in an outline something
like a cartouche. Various cartouches
scattered over a page became so many
islands, each with its own form and volume.
Tagore joined up this archipelago of scrat¬
ches with soft and flowy curves to form a
rhythmic arabesque of masses and discon¬
nections, nerves and flexures that stretched
out into a beak, a bird in the air, or a vase
decorated with incisions and designs.
Never before had Rabindranath felt this
impulse to convert his manuscripts into
patterns and shapes. At first he considered
them the playful products of his leisure
hours. (In his younger days he had made
pencil sketches and ink designs in a drawing
book, magnificently bound in black leather.)
But he soon discovered that "the scratches
in my manuscript cried, like sinners, for
salvation," and that the desire to "rescue
them into a merciful finality of rhythm"
was too strong to be easily shaken off.
Thus more designs and drawings came to
be made until Tagore became conscious
that a hidden force was being manifested
within him, and undertook to paint in
earnest.
His first exhibition, held
in the Galerie Pigalle in Continued
Paris in 1930, created a
sensation not only in the
French capital but in India

Tagore painted most of his works on paper using Ink or flower petals as pigments.
He rarely gave them titles, though he called them "my versification in lines."

where nis own countrymen were astounded to learn that their
beloved poet was also a painter. The same year a few examples
of his works were shown in London, Berlin and New York. His
first exhibition in India came in February, 1932 when 265 of
his drawings, paintings and engravings were displayed to the public
in Calcutta, followed the next year by another exhibition in
Bombay. In 1946, four of his paintings were included in an
international exhibition of modern art organized by Unesco in
Paris.
Nevertheless, to the world at large, Rabindranath Tagore the
Painter still remains practically unknown.
Many of the great poet's drawings and paintings have an air of
having been done on the spur of the moment and often were.
Once begun, a painting took possession of him and left him no
pause until it was finished. He worked with great zest and gusto,
drawing rapidly and without faltering or stopping to ponder and
correct.
Although he used all kinds of paints and produced coloured
chalk drawings, pastels, and later dry-points and etchings, Tagore's
preferred medium was liquid colour. He used any ink at hand,
usually ordinary fountain-pen ink. When this was not available,
he crushed flower petals and used them as pigments. To obtain
a glossy effect he chose different kinds of oils, particularly coconut
oil and mustard oil. He rarely used a brush (when he did it was
a home-made version) and disdained the artist's palette. Instead,
he worked with cloth soaked in colour, the back of a fountain pen,
his thumb, a stick or, more often, a knife.
Tagore was associated with the most celebrated painters and
artists of the world for over half a century. In the course of his
many voyages to foreign lands he acquired a profound first-hand
knowledge of both Oriental and Western art. On a visit to Japan,
for instance, he once left on a week-end trip to see a private art
collection in Yokohama and stayed on for three months to make
a minute study of the technique and styles of Japanese and Chi¬
nese painting. So deep was his interest in art that in 1920 he
even founded an art school at Santiniketan.
Yet, despite all this, Tagore's art is peculiarly his own, without
ties to either the past or the present. Rabindranath followed no set
rules ; his works are the spontaneous creations which sprang from
his fertile imagination, simple, yet disconcerting, original, totally
sincere and idealistic. Like his poetry they are deeply thought-
provoking and shrouded in mystery, the outpouring of a man ena¬
moured of pure beauty, form and colour. "My morning was full
of songs," Tagore said, "'let sunset days be full of colour."
When Tagore began to paint after fifty years as a writer, he
discarded many barriers and explored new ground. "He seemed,"

Ajit Mookerjee recently wrote, '"to have broken away from an
inhibited world and released the primal forces of the unconscious."
When his painting was called that of a madman, Tagore remark¬
ed : '"My pictures did not have their origin in trained discipline,
in tradition, and deliberate attempt at illustration."
The poet's imagination delighted in the mysterious, but his
works of art were not intended as a metaphysical or mystical
expression. "It would be a great mistake," Ananda K. Coomaras-
wamy pointed out before Tagore's death, '"to search in them for
hidden spiritual symbolism ; they are not meant to be deciphered
like puzzles or code messages. ...It is obvious that the poet must
have looked at many pictures in the course of his long life ; but
there is nothing in his own work to show that he has seen them.
This is a genuinely original, genuinely naive expression; extraor¬
dinary evidence of eternal youth persistent in a hoary and vener¬
able personage."
