Haiku by Bashô
/Ç.fr^y^*"-'
"A League ofNations presupposes a league of
minds," saidPaul Valéry in 1932. In line
with this approach, the International
Institute ofIntellectual Co-operation
published between 1925 and 1946 several
series ofbooks on economics, social issues,
education, art, literature and other themes.
The Japanese series published in 1936
featured an anthology ofpoems by Matsuo
Bashô (1644-1694), the great haiku poet,
with illustrations by his compatriotFujita
Tsuguhara, a painter better known as
Léonard Foujita (1 886-1 968), who lived in
France. Below arefourofthe haiku, with the
commentaries and paintings that
accompanied them.
Octopus traps: how soon
they are to have an end these
dreams
beneath the summer moon.
Under the bright moon
I walked round and round
The lake-
All night long.

'Japanesefishermen caughtoctopus using traps
thrown into the sea. Thefate ofall creatures is
equally ephemeral and the dream of poor
humanitydoes not last much longer than thatof
the condemned beast. This is a traditional Bud¬
dhist idea that life is but the evanescentdream of
an instant. . . . For those who understand it, this
haiku not only evokes a picturesque image, it is
full ofintense and profound emotion.
" All night long Bashô admired the moon in
the sky or in the water's deep round mirror. He
could not make up his mind to sleep.

Wake up! Wake up! It's I,
who want you for companion,
sleeping butterfly.
With a hat on my head
And straw sandals on my feet,
I met on the road
The end of the year.
' A simple reflection by the poet-pilgrim on the last day oftheyear.
