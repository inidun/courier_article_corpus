TheTower ofLondon is the most
popular historic site in the
British Isles, welcoming two
and a half million visitors a year. The
biggest drawing card is the lewel House,
where the Crown Jewels are displayed in
all their panoply. In March 1994, a com¬
pletely newJewel House, located on the
ground floor of Waterloo Block, was
opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The
Jewels are seen in brilliantly lit glass-
enclosed cases in a series of rooms,
while visitors are borne slowly past on a
moving floorway or "travellator". Above
the cases, giant screens project a
panorama of the Jewels' history, with
the Coronation illustrating their cere¬
monial purpose.
While the Coronation rites extend
back to St. Edward the Confessor in Saxon
times, the Jewels at Queen Elizabeth's
Coronation, that the visitors see, come
from the Restoration ofCharles II in 1660
or later. The Puritans ofOliver Cromwell's

in the Regalia; the Coronation Robes;
the Crowns, Sceptres and Orbs, among
them the great gold St. Edward's Crown
made for Charles II and still used at the
investiture; the Imperial State Crown
made for Queen Victoria, thickly set with
precious stones and worn at state cere¬
monies such as the opening of Parlia¬
ment. The State Crown also displays in
its lower cross the large ruby of the Black
Prince, which adorned the helmet of
Henry V at Agincourt in 1415, and the
Stuart sapphire, and in the uppermost
cross gleams a sapphire said to be from
the ring of the Confessor himself. In a
royal sceptre sparkles the Star ofAfrica,
the largest cut diamond in the world.

Adjacent to the Jewel House is the mas¬
sive White Tower, the original tower built
by William the Conqueror at the end of
the eleventh century. The Norman king,
who overthrew the Saxon Harold at
Hastings, consolidated his triumph by

.. building strong castíes throughout Eng¬
land. For London, he chose the site of a
former Roman camp on the Thames and
in 1078 he confided to Gundulf, Bishop of
Rochester the construction of what
William Fitzstephen's 12th-century
Chroniclewould describe as "a very great
and most strong Palatine Tower". Unlike
wooden Saxon structures, the Tower of
London was built of Kentish limestone
with dressings of white granite stone
brought from Caen.
The White Tower, its Caen stone
white-washed, with spired turrets at the
four corners, still dominates the sur¬
roundings. Over the centuries, addi¬
tional structures were built until the
whole consisted of thirteen towers of
the Inner Ward and six towers and bas¬
tions of the outer ward.
Previously, the only entrance by land
was over a walled causeway, 30 metres
wide, leading to the barbican of the Lion
Tower. Here prowled the King's beasts,
and the Constable, the chiefofficer of the
tower, was paid 14 pence per day, with 6
pence more for chunks ofbloody meat,
to feed the lions, leopards, bears and
wolves.
Palace and prison
Today, the Lion Tower has gone and the
beasts were despatched in 1834 to the
new London zoo. The entrance is now
through the gate of the Middle Tower
and across another smaller causeway
over the dry moat, drained in 1843, up to
the Byward Tower, with guardsmen in
scarlet coats and tall black busbies.
The various towers before the visitor
evoke mingled memories: ofcenturies of
cruelty and anguish, of brilliant
pageantry, of all the great work of the
kingdom carried on within these walls.
No better description of the original
purposes of the Tower ofLondon may be
found than in John Stowe's Survey of
London, published in 1598.
"This Tower is a citadel to defend or
to command the city; a royal palace for
assemblies or treaties; a prison of state
for the most dangerous offenders; the
only place of coinage for all England at
this time; the armoury for warlike pro¬
vision; the treasury of the ornaments
and the jewels of the crown; and general
conserver of the most records of the
king's courts ofjustice at Westminster".

toric Royal Palaces Agency, which man¬
ages the Tower, created a fire escape on
the second floor which will take visi¬
tors, who may number 1,000 at peak
periods, down to the first floor near a
well-marked exit. A fire detection and
alarm system is likewise installed. The
Jewel House has a fire control centre for
the entire site.
St. John's Chapel occupies part of the
second and third floors, while the White
Tower houses the finest collection of
armour in Europe. It was begun by
Henry VIII whose gigantic suits may be
seen in the Tudor armoury on the top
floor. Renaissance and medieval armour
are on the second floor, while tourna¬
ment armour is found on the first floor.
From the White Tower, on the left-
hand side, is the stretch of greensward
called Tower Green, where a plaque,
placed at Queen Victoria's command,

indicates the site of the scaffold. Here,
those of the highest rank, condemned
for defiling or reaching for the Crown,
were beheaded. Two of King Henry's
unfortunate wives met their doom on
Tower Green. Both were accused ofadul¬
tery, though probably Queen Anne,
mother ofElizabeth I, was innocent. Her
execution was delayed so that, atAnne's
request, a skilled headsman with a fine
sword might be brought from France.
The morning of her execution, 21
May 1536, she asked the Lieutenant of
the Tower ifhe had seen the sword and
if it was good. The Lieutenant assured
her that it was. "Then," quoth Anne, "it
were well for me, for I have a slender
little neck."
When the Tower guns boomed,
announcing the execution, bluff King
Hal was cross-gartered and wearing
yellow, signs of joy. The royal widower
was soon to wed Jane Seymour. Anne
was buried in the nearby Chapel of St.
Peter ad Vincula, where Queen
Catherine also lies.
The last to perish on this raven-
haunted Green was Queen Elizabeth's
gallant cavalier, the Earl of Essex, who
aspired to the Crown. Now plump glossy
ravens strut on Tower Green, once the
scene of so much blood and grief, while
the wind sighs in the stately sycamores.
A tradition holds that if the eight care¬
fully guarded ravens should go, the
Tower will fall.
Every night at 10 p.m., the ancient
Ceremony of the Keys is enacted by the
ChiefYeoman Warder, with an escort of
a sergeant and three guardsmen in
scarlet tunics and black busbies. First
he locks the outer gate, then the great
doors of the Middle Tower, finally those
of the Byward. Returning to the Inner
Ward, he is challenged by an officer with
bared sword. The guardsmen present
arms; the yeoman warder raises his
Tudor hat and cries: "God preserve
Queen Elizabeth!"
As chimes toll the hour, a bugler
sounds the lingering silvery notes of
"The Last Post", which echo across 900
years in the night and memories of
London's mighty Tower.
