V W ILL there ever be such a
person as International Man or Inter¬
national Woman? Someone whose
attitudes and beliefs are not enclosed
by national or racial boundaries? Some¬
one for whom words like "foreign"
or "alien" have been defused of
menace? Someone whose . values
have been formed specifically by the
international education he or she has
received? These are good questions
to ask in International Education Year.
Some answers may perhaps be
found in a new and major experiment
In international education The United
World Colleges and at the first of
these colleges at St. Donat's Castle in
Wales which was opened in 1962.
I went to the London headquarters

of the project and to the college in
Wales to see and hear for myself.
The aims of the project were out¬
lined to me in London by an Irishman,
Robert Blackburn, who was the first
Director of Studies of the college and
now as Chief Executive Officer of the
project, works for Lord Mountbatten,
the President of the International
Council of the United World Colleges.
Robert Blackburn told me that the
United World College of the Atlantic
was the first of a number of such
colleges all based on a simple belief:
that international education is no
longer an expensive luxury but must
be made general In this century for
the sake of survival. The project aims
to use education to unite not divide
nations, to break down barriers, to
create new forms of international
education.
The plan is to set up a chain of
international colleges In Europe and
in other continents which will enter
young men and women of high ability
for their last two years of secondary
school. In these schools the organ¬
izers hope that students will discover,
by living and studying together,
common ideals based on service and
loyalty to the International community.
The intention is that they should then
return to their own countries, welcom¬
ing International diversity, convinced
that International problems must be
settled by reason and discussion; not
by force.
This is an Idealistic aim but if such
colleges could turn out each year
several thousand able and carefully
selected students, their influence
could be of lasting International value.
Half a dozen such Colleges could have
a major impact by the turn of the
century.
There are special practical needs
today for International education at
pre-university age which make this
project of particular interest in Inter¬
national Education Year. The inter¬
national business community is

growing rapidly; increasing numbers
of international civil servants and
diplomats are moving around the world
with their families and have great
difficulty getting suitable education for
their children. They want to give
their children secondary education
in the country in which they are
based but university education at
home. The existing national educa¬
tional systems cannot meet these
needs. Also, international organiza¬
tions and businesses desperately need
staff with a genuinely international
outlook and training.
From what I saw, I believe that the
United World Colleges can help meet
these idealistic and practical needs.
The first United World College Is in
a fabulous setting a modern college
campus based on a 13th century castle
which was owned and extensively
modernized by the American millionaire
and newspaper owner, William Ran¬
dolph Hearst It was purchased by
a prominent French internationalist,
Antoine Besse, who donated it to the
college. Now it stands, spectacular
and secure, a medieval fortress
surrounded by ultra modern dormitory
blocks and academic buildings.
Terraced Elizabethan gardens lead
down to the rough and dangerous
waters of the Bristol Channel.
At St. Donat's the first experimental
phase of the United World Colleges
project has now been completed. By
September 1969 the first college was
at full strength with some 300 students
from more than 36 countries. The
United Kingdom provided one quarter
of the students, followed by large
groups from the Fed. Rep. of Germany,
U.S.A., Canada end Scandinavia.
Most other western European countries
are represented, and the first students
have been entered from eastern
Europe. Smaller numbers come from
Africa, South America, Malaysia and
India.
Here, in action, is a working example
of international education and co¬
operation. The students (boys and
girls) are mixed internationally in
classrooms and in the dormitory
houses where they live. English is
the common language and all students
must speak it well as it is their
language of instruction, their common
meeting ground. But in the corridors,
in the dining hall, in the coffee bar
you can hear any language from
Finnish to Swahili.
The study of modem languages is
particularly emphasized and all students
learn at least one foreign language.
The college has proved academically
to be an outstanding success and
already former students have returned
to more than 150 universities through¬
out the world.
A large group of these first students
at St. Donat's have been Norwegian,
and I had an opportunity to meet some
of them in Norway after their two
years at the college. They have come
back convinced internationalists but
none the less Norwegian for that.
The former students have just
started an Association Journal and the
first Dano-Norweglan edition has been
published. It Is clear their links with
their own culture and countries have
been strengthened not weakened by
this International experience: at school
in Norway one does not have to
explain and describe and defend ones
own country. At St. Donat's a Nor¬
wegian, Welsh or Polish student must
do just this.
Students who enter the college
(maximum age 17 1/2) must be of good
university potential. Most enter with
scholarships, financed by local educa¬
tion authorities for the British students,
by the State in some countries, and
private sponsoring groups in the
U.S.A. and several other countries.
This support from Ministries of
Education and Foreign Affairs, and
United World College National Com¬
missions has been essential as the
college ¡s a private foundation. It
ensures, through a competitive entry,
high academic standards, also a wide
variety of backgrounds among the
students from the sons or daughters
of Welsh miners and Greek taxi
drivers to the children of Scandinavian
shipowners and steel magnates from
the Ruhr. The daughter of a Nor¬
wegian carpenter is a student along¬
side the sons of the largest car
manufacturer in Italy and the leading
shipowner in Greece. This is no snob,
élite school except in terms of ability.
The range of nationalities, religious
belief and political allegiance Is equally
wide. There are students from
eastern as well as western European
countries; political refugees from
South Africa with the sons of European
settlers in Rhodesia; students from the
Arab states as well as Israel. This
is an adolescent U.N. in miniature.

community is tough. Students choose
three or four major (Advanced Level)
subjects and then add four or five
subsidiary courses. Then there are
their afternoon "activities" which take
eight hours a week, followed by
evening lectures, seminars, debates,
college societies, evening tutorials.
A lecture by a representative from
the Soviet Embassy may be followed
by a symposium on the Middle-East
led by Jordanians and Israeli students.
An official South African lecturer will
be questioned by a Bantu student in
exile on a U.N. scholarship. Here
every political point of view is re¬
presented.
History is a central, subject in the
curriculum. Students bring the text
books used in their former schools;
there Is little agreement on the inter¬
pretation of the great issues of modern
history. What a Greek and a Turk
are taught about Cyprus, or what an
English and German student are taught
about Bismarck are still not the same
stories. In fact, so serious are these
variations that the college is going to
take on a major project in the com¬
parison of national history text books
as seen by the students from a
working level in an international
community.

HEN they first arrive, the
barriers and divisions between the
students are real and bitter; as real as
the divisions of our time. Therefore,
in addition to the international work
done in classrooms, debating hall and
dormitory, the college has designed a
special activities programme to further
its international purpose, based on that
most international activity of all the
saving of human life.
Therefore all students are taught
first aid and life saving and take part
in one of the college rescue services
Beach Rescue Unit, Cliff Rescue
Team or Inshore Rescue Boat Corps
or the Social Service Unit. This is no
playing matter, no schoolboy game.
These services are responsible to the
competent British national authorities
for the safety of the public along the
ten mile stretch of rocky coast of
which St. Donat's is the centre. They
have already answered 46 emergency
calls, have prevented many accidents
and saved 30 lives at sea, on the
beaches, or on the cliffs.
The skill and ambition of the
students is so great that one of them,
an 18-years-old Norwegian girl, Eli¬
zabeth Hostvedt, has qualified as the
first woman coxswain in the history
of the highly professional and rather
conservative British Royal National
Lifeboat Institution. (The college is
an accredited station of the R. N.L.I,
and operates its own small fleet
of inflatable inshore rescue boats
which are designed and built by the
students.)
The college rescue services were
one of the first voluntary services to
be called out to assist at the great
mining disaster at nearby Aberran
when a coal tip slipped and engulfed
part of the village and an entire
primary school.
The first college is now also becom¬
ing known as an important pioneering
venture in international education,
particularly for the work it is doing
with the International Baccalaureate
Office in Geneva, to establish an inter¬
national university entry examination,
which would be widely recognized
throughout the world.
No such examination existed when
the college started. However, it was
essential that all the students at the
college, irrespective of nationality,
should follow common programmes
leading to a single matriculation
examination. This was done by taking
the matriculation examinations of the
country in which the college is
situated (in this case British G.C.E.
Advanced Level examinations) and
then negotiating agreed additions with
ministries of education and universities
abroad so that students might be
excused their national matriculation
examinations.
These bilateral equivalence agree¬
ments were the college's first
piece of pioneering educational work.
However, it has been expensive in
time and money, infinitely complex
and only partially successful as a
number of countries have not accepted
G.C.E. qualifications, France and Bel¬
gium in particular.
However, all national examinations
are ill-suited to an international school
and therefore the college became a
founder of the International Baccalau¬
reate (I.B.O.). The teaching staff have
played a considerable part in develop¬
ing the programmes of the Inter¬
national Baccalaureate and the college
currently provides the majority of
students for the first trial examinations.
This I.B.O. experiment, which has
the full support of Unesco, has
created widespread interest in univer¬
sities throughout the world. Many
have already accepted the International
Baccalaureate as equivalent to their
own matriculation qualifications. The
college at St. Donat's intends to
change over to the I.B. course com¬
pletely from September 1971 and there
is no doubt that the I.B. will provide
the academic structure for subsequent
United World Colleges.
The interest which has been shown
in this pioneering work and the
success of the first college at
St. Donat's has revealed a wide
demand for international education at
this level, not just in Europe, but
throughout the world. Therefore,
the second phase of United World
Colleges development has begun: to
make the project multi-college.
For this purpose an International
Council has been set up under the
presidency of Lord Mountbatten (an
outstanding example of International
Man himself). In giving his' reasons
for taking on this major task of
establishing a chain of international
colleges throughout the world Lord
Mounbatten has said:
"I accepted this office because I
believe that this new venture In inter¬
national education can make a real
contribution towards international
understanding and peace; also because
in the present world situation educa¬
tion must now be harmonized as a
force to unite nations.
"I believe that education today
without some international element is
as outmoded as education which gives
no training in modern science or
technology."
N
lATIONAL committees have
already been set up in eleven countries
to further the project, mobilize public
interest, raise money and select
students. Active plans are now being
made for the next two Colleges in the
Fed. Rep. of Germany and North
America.
In the Fed. Rep. of Germany a
strong founding committee has been
established and there is widespread
interest and support.
In Canada a widely based national
committee with Mr. Lester Pearson
and Senator Donald Cameron is now
making active plans for the establish¬
ment of a North American College
which will be sponsored jointly by the
U.W.C. American and Canadian Com¬
mittees. This college will probably
be in British Columbia and will look
toward Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Australia for Its non-national students
in the same way as the College of the
Atlantic in Wales looks toward Europe.
It Is hoped to enter the first students
in September 1972.
Considerable Interest has also been
shown in Italy and Scandinavia in
founding United World Colleges while
in France a survey has just been
completed on the practicability of a
United World College within the
French educational system. A college
for South East Asia in Singapore is
also being considered.
When several such colleges have
been established throughout the world
the venture will be of major importance
In developing International education.
And as for the first students, they
say "We'll never be the same again.
These two years will be with us for
the rest of our lives." I am sure they
are right.

Atlantic College has a special
activities programme based
on the most international
of all activities the saving of
human life. Already 30 people
owe their lives to the
college's beach, cliff and inshore
rescue units, which are
responsible for the safety of
the public along a 10 mile
stretch of rocky Welsh
coastline. One student, an
18-year-old Norwegian girl
has qualified as the first woman
coxwain in the history of
Britain's Royal National Lifeboat
Institution. The college is an
accredited station of the
Lifeboat Institution and operates
its own fleet of rescue boats,
designed and built by the
students. Above and right,
regular training keeps student
sea rescue teams at
peak efficiency.
