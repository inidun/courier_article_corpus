ft When did the Indian
cinema begin?
It dates back to the days of the
Lumière brothers who were the first to
show films in India. That was in
Bombay at the turn of the century. In
1 901 , Charles Pathé brought his cam¬
eras here. The first Indian films were
made in 1912, including the famous
Raja Harishchandra by Dhundiraj
Phalke, who had been trained in
Europe. To edit his films, he held up
the frames between his fingers.
The Indians, who were under
British rule at that time, soon realized
what advantages they could draw
from the cinema. They turned to
mythology and history to find their

roots and indirectly oppose the
British.
Taking their inspiration from Méliès
and the Lumière brothers, they
invented special effects which still
seem astonishing today. The marvel¬
lous Hindi cinema was born in the
wake of the nationalist movement.
Realism was a later development.
With the coming of talkies and
music, four main genres appeared: the
mythological film, the historical saga,
the musical comedy and the social
chronicle often heavily influenced
by Soviet cinema. Major directors
emerged, such as Santaram and
Chetan Anand.
The Indian cinema soon became
popular. Film techniques were easily
adapted to the Indian scene. India pro¬
duced an enormous output of, essen¬
tially, new versions of American
films something that would create
copyright problems today. Later, a cer¬
tain snobbery led us to prefer Amer¬
ican and English films to our own
Indian productions. This had the
blessing of the English government,
which was very keen on creating a
local elite of "brown sahibs".

cinema came after the

independence, Indian films carved out
for themselves an enormous and con¬
stantly growing market. That was the
golden age. Famous actors like Ram
Rao were idolized on a scale
unknown in any other country. The
actor even came to be identified with
the gods he played. That is still the
case today. The masters included
Guru Dutt, Raj Kappur, Satyajit Ray,
Mrinal Sen and many others. But the
age of the great masters is over now.
ft Is that when your career
began?
At that time I was in the United
States, studying at the University of
California at Los Angeles. Reading
was my first passion. But in the
1960s I lived on a diet of American
films. At the same time, at the univer¬
sity, where we talked for hours on
end, I discovered Fellini, Kurosawa
and even Satyajit Ray. But I knew that
I would return to India and I did so in
1974 when my father died. I soon
decided to set up a distribution com¬
pany. My mother was opposed to the
idea. At that time the cinema was not
highly thought of. It was a job for a
marasi, a strolling player. "You are
going to become a marasi," she said.
To which I replied: "If I have bad luck
tomorrow, I'll blame you." I promised
to come back to her if films didn't
work out. But my company was suc¬
cessful and I am still going strong.
ft How is distribution
organized in India?
As a general rule, the cinema
owner asks the distributor to agree to
a flat rate price. He does not share in
the risk. That is the first obstacle,
especially for ambitious films. But the
National Film Development Corpora¬
tion, a production company in which
the government and television are
both involved, helps to produce high-
quality films. However, the funds
raised are often ridiculously small. And
the major distribution circuits do not
take these films. There is also the lan¬
guage problem (it is unusual, for
instance, for a Bengali film to be
shown elsewhere in India), and the
inadequate number of cinemas, to say
nothing of poor projection quality.
ft How does the Indian
cinema stand today?
Our national market is threatened.
For the first time, the Americans
dubbed one of their films, Jurassic
Park, in Hindi. It was a smash hit. That
success is bound to make them con¬
tinue. How can we resist? I really
wonder. First, we must give up the
idea that our domestic market is
untouchable. We must fight and
invent. And we can only do so if we
regain our lost passion, or better still a
new passion, for the cinema. M
