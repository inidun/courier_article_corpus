BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
For many people seaweeds
are simply plants that grow
in water. This was the accepted
definition until the eighteenth cen¬
tury. They were regarded as "not
proper plants" because they liad
neither flowers nor seeds. Today,
this definition is out of dale. A sea¬
weed or alga may be cither veg¬
etable or animal, thrive in water or
on land and interest zoologists as
much as botanists.
Until the cud of the 1950s,
explains Bruno de Reviers, senior
lecturer at Franco's Natural His¬
tory Museum, scientists usually
classified living things as either ani¬
mal or vegetable. Seaweeds arc in
fact both. Says Reviers: "Sea¬
weeds aren't simple, they're a bun¬
dle of organisms drawn from very
différent groups, sometimes quite
philogenelically distant, that is,
without direct links."
The overall view of the world
of living things is changing very
quickly. The vegetable kingdom
was traditionally divided into thal¬
lophytes and cormophytes. The
former (from the Greek word for a
shoot, thallos) are "simple" (some¬
times called "inferior") vegetation,
without stems, leaves, roots or vein
systems. They included seaweed,
mushrooms, lichens, mosses and
even bacteria. Cormophytes (from
the Greek for stem, kormos) have
stems, roots and flowers.
So how were vegetables distin¬
guished from animals? By the abil¬
ity of animals to move, something
vegetables cannot do. But things get
complicated when some animals,
like sea anemones or coral, slay in
one spot, while some microscopic
seaweeds move about, like Spir¬
illum (a blue seaweed) or diatoms
(brown planktonic seaweed).
Another difference is that ve<r-
etables synthesize living matter by
using the energy of liglit through
photosynthesis, while animals trap
and cat prey. But like carnivorous
plants, some seaweeds can trap
prey too and feed off organic male-
rial as well. To cover this com¬
plexity, biologists now offer five or
moro categories, and fan-like

A LONG HISTORY
AND A COMPOSITE FAMILY
Seaweed is everywhere on land,
in the sea, in fresh or salty water,
on our plates, in the pharmacist's
cupboard, in water purification
plants and even sometimes in our
lungs. Ilowmany kinds are there?
Estimates range from 20,000 to
130,000 species, but the real fig¬
ure is probably around 45,000.
The very first marine plant
forms equipped with chlorophyll
which appeared on Earth were
really just bacteria. They were
blue, not green, because of the
extra pigments associated with the
chlorophyll. These pigments
enable energy to be drawn from
light, even when the rays received
by the chlorophyll and necessary
for photosynthesis pass through
water. The best-known blue sea¬
weed is Spirulina, found in lakes in
North Africa, Chad, Mexico,
Florida and the Bahamas. It is tra¬
ditionally eaten in biscuit form and
is cultivated these days in Viet
Nam and Israel.
To grasp this diversity, we have
to go back to the dawn of time.
Oxygen is produced by the photo¬
synthesis of blue seaweed. The
ozonelayerforms. About 700 mil-

lion years ago, there is a great
burst of life and species multiply
and diverge. Think of a crown with
branches growing out from it. The
blue seaweeds are very far away
from the green ones, which in turn
have no connection with the brown
or red seaweeds. When the
branches multiply, a link develops
between green seaweed, ferns and
mosses, and between dinoph)te
seaweed and the plasmodium par¬
asite, which transmits malaria.
The common ancestors of some
green seaweeds gradually emerge
from the water and adapt to life
in air. Oddly, some later return to
living under water. Eel grass, for
example, which serves as a nurs¬
ery for young fish, actually flow¬
ers and reproduces through seeds.
Like seaweed it can take in nutri¬
tion directly through its leaves,
instead of its roots.
Brown seaweeds are microscopic
like diatoms or huge like giant
kelps, which grow to a length of 50
metres or more. They are found
anywhere from the surface to 150
metres down. Dinofiagellates are
simile-cell organisms which form
"red seas" and can secrete poisons.
Some of these poisons, which arc
100,000 times stronger than
cocaine for example, attack the
human nervous system and can
destroy it. This is what happens in

eaten poisonous seaweed (see "Nat¬

THE USES OF SEAWEED
Alvaro Israel, of the Israeli
National Institute in Haifa, has
identified 107 types and 493 vari¬
eties of seaweed used by human
beings. Most are grown and con¬
sumed in the Far East and the
Pacific in accordance with long tra¬
ditions. In Korea, for example,
brown seaweed was found in the
10,000-ycar-old remains of meals
in tombs at the Kiong-Lu burial
grounds. In fourth-century Japan,
the imperial court taxed the con¬
sumption of nori (Porphyru),
wakamc (Undurici) and konbu
(Laminaria). Since then, the
national dish of sushi (rice and raw
fish) has been served with nori.
In the West, famine in the fif¬
teenth century led people to eat
seaweed, which is why it was dis¬
dained for so long in this part of the
world. The Chinese eat the most
seaweed these days 20 kg a head
every year followed by the Kore¬
ans and the Japanese, with 13.4
kg. About 60 varieties of brown and
red seaweed are eaten in the forms
of vegetables, pâté, jam, soup,
bread or beverages. In the Pacific,
delicious little "grapes"' of eaulerpa
are served up as salads.
At the Seaweed Research and
De\ clopinent Centre (CEVA), part
of the French Research Institute
for the Use of the Sea (IFREMER),
Joel Fleurence is looking into the
nutritional value of seaweeds.
"Their make-up," Ik; says, "varies
according to the species, the sea¬
son, the surroundings, and geo¬
graphical and physiological factors."
Edible seaweeds are mostly
made iqi of carbohydrates com¬
plex sugars and dietary fibres.
Brown seaweeds contain the least
protein from 5 to 15% of their
dr) weight but red seaweeds like
Palmaria and Porphyra teñera
have about 47% and rival soya
(35%). They are very low in fats
and contain mineral salts and trace
elements such as magnesium,
arsenic, copper, lithium, sulphur
and zinc. They also have a full range
of vitamins, especially vitamin A,

lack of which can lead to blindness.
Unfortunately they tend to disap¬
pear with drying or cooking, par¬
ticularly vitamin C.
From seaweed, industry gets
alginates and carrageens, valuable
additives which feature in much
of our food, for example, stabiliz¬
ing sauces and making dairy prod¬
ucts creamy. They hide behind the
European Union code names of
E400to407.
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES
But not just any seaweed can be
harvested, any time or anywhere,
since seaweeds easily absorb pol¬
lutants like mercury. They are
increasingly being cultivated in
specially chosen and protected
places. In Asia, the 530,000
hectares of seaweeds farmed by
250,000 family businesses provide
950,000 jobs. According to the
Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion of the United Nations (FAO),
7,637,000 tonnes of fresh seaweed
were harvested in 1991, 90% of it
cultivated.
The uses of seaweed seem end¬
less. Do you want to make cherries
without cherry flesh? Make your
plants grow? Mop up urine in
babies' nappies? Have waterproof
umbrellas or mackintoshes? Make
plastic floors and wood shine with¬
out polishing them? Make dental
impressions without risk of burning
the patient? Have photographic
film where the gelatine doesn't
melt in the heat? Or put out forest
fires by dropping thick chemicals
from fire lighting planes? Biologists
think a lot more research should
be done into seaweed, especially
for food purposes, when the world
is going hungry and seaweed is
everywhere.

Found in seas throughout the world, Laminaria kelps grow in tidal areas.
