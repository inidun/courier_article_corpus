At the end of some 40 ye a rs of development co-
o p e r ation it may seem heart - wa rming that
“ p a rt n e rs h i p ” is currently one of the key
words in the development dictionary, or at least in
its Nort h e rn edition. It is by no means as clear that
it is as salient a term in the Southern editions. A n d
this holds particularly true in the education and trai-
ning sector.
It is good to hear so many donors talking of the
need for part n e rships with the South to be genuine
and respectful,a tacit admission that to date many
were not at all symmetrical.Yet even now, it is still
the donors who are laying down the cri t e ria for
genuine part n e rs h i p. S e veral of them are swa p p i n g
some of their old part n e rs for new ones who appear
to comply with new requirements on governance,
pro-poor gr ow t h , gender equity and basic educat i o n .
With some of these part n e rs , the donors are
trying out a new form of aid delivery known as the
Sector Wide Approach or SWA P. H owe ve r , d e s-
pite their title, S WAPs are often not sector-wide, bu t
t u rn out to be co-ordinated donor support to a
single sub-sector, p ri m a ry educat i o n .And it some-
times seems that the sheer scale and complexity of
S WAPs means that they can be more inva s i ve of the
n ational sovereignty of a state than previous donor
projects ever were.
This suggests a paradox at the heart of the
SWAP partnership approach.The SWAP assumes
t h at the gove rnment is in the driving seat—to use the
d o n o rs ’ commonest metaphor—and has deve l o p e d
its own sector-wide policy framework and medium-
t e rm expenditure plan. It is then meant to co-ordi-
nate the financial inputs of perhaps as many as 18
d o n o rs (as for example in the current SWAP to

make its own judgments about its technical assis-

c o u n t ries that actually have this kind of capacity at
national and provincial levels don’t need this huge
amount of co-ordinated donor funding.While those
which still do desperately need external assistance
d o n ’t have the capacity to be part n e rs on these
demanding terms.
A second kind of emerging part n e rship encom-
passes a series of new alliances that are no longer
solely dependent on aid.They involve all kinds of
twinning—of schools,of universities and colleges,
and of educational and cultural resources such as
museums. But in what kind of countries and insti-
tutions do we find these new twinning part n e rs? Not

and in Asia rather than in some of the ve ry poor ins-
titutions of sub-Saharan A f ri c a ,t h at such alliances

discourse. In these kinds of environments, North-
South part n e rships turn out to be centrally

T h u s , despite the president of the World Bank’s
admission in December 1999 that deve l o p m e n t
co-operation needs to be fundamentally rebuilt,it
is a pity that some of the principal designs for this
new architecture of part n e rship appear to have
