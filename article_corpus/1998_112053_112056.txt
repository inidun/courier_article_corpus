"Most of the young men with numbers on
their white T-shirts are just waiting for the
sound of the gong which means that
another day has passed and there is one day
less to count before they can go back to
their families, where maybe a new brother
or sister has arrived, see their friends who
will have grown but not changed and live in
'a neighbourhood which will always produce
victims who cannot obtain the quality of
life produced by a society where money,
Mercedes and beauty are the ingredients that
count. As long as honesty and pride don't
count in society young men will commit
crimes which will put them behind bars and
give them boundless hours of waiting."
These lines by British photographer Tina
Gue accompany her coverage of a prison for
young men and a women's prison in
Djakarta (Indonesia). On these pages, a
selection of her photos.
