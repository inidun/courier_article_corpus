Unesco past and
The watershed year of 1945
saw the awakening of a new
spirit of planetary awareness
that was to become one of the hall¬
marks of our century. The time had
come for nations to be more recep¬
tive to one another and abolish the
distances between them. In the
euphoria of the postwar age a group
of men and women who dreamed
of a better future laid the founda¬
tions of UNESCO, an organization
that would participate in the world¬
wide task of reconstruction and
"contribute to peace and security
by promoting collaboration among
the nations through education, sci¬
ence and culture". UNESCO came
into being on 16 November 1945 at
the close of an international con¬
ference in London, and held its first
General Conference a year later in
Paris, from 20 November to 10
December 1946 in Paris. Four days
later it officially became a special¬
ized agency of the United Nations.
As its contribution to the
gigantic task of postwar recon¬
struction, UNESCO was called upon
to repair intellectual and moral
damage. The war had shown that
ignorance could take a terrible toll
and that powerful weapons could
lurk in school textbooks. With these
preoccupations in mind, the Gen¬
eral Conference approved a pro¬
gramme for the dissemination of
knowledge through education and
mass information including a pro
ject for an in-depth review of text¬
books and other school books.
By 1947 UNESCO was sending
missions to Austria, Czechoslo¬
vakia, Greece, Italy, Poland and
Yugoslavia to inquire into the most
immediate needs of their people. A
pamphlet entitled The Teacher and
the Post-war Child was published
with funding from the Greek gov¬
ernment and was subsequently
translated into German, Italian,
Hebrew and Romanian. A number
of youth service camps were orga¬
nized, and pilot projects in funda¬
mental education were launched in
Haiti, China and East Africa.
The programme submitted to
the first General Conference also
outlined action to promote the free
circulation of books and other
information materials. A pro¬
gramme of exchanges for librarians
was set up and preparations were
made for a survey of library
schools. An appeal was addressed to
all countries, inviting them to pub¬
lish selected national bibliographies;
the first edition of the UNESCO Bul¬
letin for Libraries appeared, and
UNESCO established a Central
Information Service.
As part of the same broad pro¬
gramme plans were made to replace
scientific and technical equipment
in war-devastated regions, to set up
40

present by Jasmina Sopova
a world-wide radio network, and
to study the tensions that lead to
war. In 1947 field science co-oper¬
ation offices were established in Rio
de Janeiro, Cairo, Nanking and
New Delhi, and grants amounting
to $231,319 were allocated to var¬
ious scientific institutions. One
important project in the social sci¬
ences was launched to study all
aspects of "international under¬
standing", while others included a
world inventory of research per¬
sonnel and resources and the study
of comparative law.
The same year, the Section of
Philosophy and Humanistic Studies
prepared a report on the philo
sophical principles underlying
human rights, based on replies to a
questionnaire that had been sent to
200 philosophers and thinkers and
to the governments of Member
States. UNESCO's Translation Unit
examined the re-establishment and
possible enlargement of the Index
Translationum, a comprehensive
guide to world translations that had
been previously published by the
International Institute of Intellec¬
tual Co-operation. The Interna¬
tional Theatre Institute was estab¬
lished, and an international literary
pool was inaugurated. The
Museums Section was strength¬
ened, and in co-operation with the
International Council of Museums
(ICOM) became an international
centre for information and advice in
this field.
In the single year 1946-1947,
words had led to action. The first
projects in education, culture, sci¬
ence, and communication had been
launched. UNESCO was rapidly
taking shape.
"UNESCO was convinced that it
had before it a great mission and
unlimited possibilities while at the
same time being aware of the
immediate urgency of its task,"
writes Fernando Valderrama,
whose History of UNESCO traces
the development of UNESCO fro m
the foundations laid by its prede¬
cessors (the League of Nations
Committee on Intellectual Co
operation and the International
Institute of Intellectual Co-opera¬
tion) to 1993. It is a story that
reflects an entire historical period.
Photos from UNESCO's archives
and the results of its programmes
illustrate a growing record of
achievement.
Based on material from archives
and libraries, this richly docu¬
mented book written by a leading
Spanish researcher and former
UNESCO staff member shows how
programmes, projects and resolu¬
tions have not been mere words
but have shaped whole chapters of
contemporary world history.
"The purpose of this history,"
writes UNESCO's Director-General,



Federico Mayor, in his preface, "is to
retrace the whole development of
an organization with a universal mis¬
sion, in which the past informs the
present, acting as a vital force
injecting into it the emotion and
drive that spurred its inception, its
expansion, the experience of its
mature years and the reflection on
its role in a changing world that it has
necessarily had to undertake."
