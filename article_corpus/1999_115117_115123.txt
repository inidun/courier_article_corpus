The final and optimal c r i s i s
of the century
20 The UNESCO Courier - March 1999
Global financial crises have shaken faith
in the market as panacea. To d a y, the world is grappling for a new 
consensus to meet the challenges of globalization, development and poverty.

Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD)

It may sound paradoxical to join two such
apparently contradictory words as “optimal”
and “ c ri s i s ” . I heard the expression for the firs t
time from the Director of the Institute for Interna-
tional Economics, C . Fred Bergsten, in Wa s h i n g t o n ,
D.C. He explained that it was be-coming increa-
singly common there, in the sense of the crisis being
gr ave enough to force the mighty to finally do some-
thing without being so serious as to render the
action useless and too late.
We may be approaching an optimal point.For eve n
the most enthusiastic prophets of the brave new wo r l d
of globalization (for instance,p a rticipants in the Wo r l d
Economic Fo rum at Davos) are beginning to question
the wisdom of their blind beliefs, and to look for a
human and social dimension to add to their world view.
One of the advantages of crises is that they can
p l ay a catalyzing role in changing our perception of
t h i n g s. And so, it seems, in the face of crisis we are
n ow witnessing gr owing signs of a new turning point.
This new current addresses humanity’s future in
t e rms of globalizat i o n ,d e velopment and pove rt y,a n d
asks a fundamental question: w h at is the nature and
sense of the economy? Is it an autonomous and largely
s e l f - r e g u l ating mechanism like the galaxies or the pla-
n e t a ry system, or is it a product of culture and society,
the result of societal choices based on va l u e s ?
Once more the impulse for change is coming not
so much from academic debate but from reality itself,
from the huge gaps between the rich and the poor.To
cite just one example:basic education for all would cost
$6 billion a ye a r.By compari s o n , $8 billion are spent
annually on cosmetics in the United States alone.
Such gr o t e s q u e , e ven obscene, contrasts show
d r a m atically that the twin problems of deve l o p m e n t
and pove rty are still ve ry much with us more than a
decade after the Washington Consensus claimed to
h ave reached “ u n i ve rsal conve r g e n c e ” around “ t h e
common core of wisdom embraced by all seri o u s
e c o n o m i s t s ” . In broad term s , this approach recom-
mended that gove rnments should: (i) pursue eco-
nomic stability in the sense of balancing the budget and

e l i m i n ating balance-of-payments defic i t s ; (ii) open
their economies to the rest of the world through trade
and financial liberalizat i o n ; and (iii) promote free
market capitalism through pri vat i z at i o n , d e r e g u l a-
t i o n , and other measures of liberalizat i o n .P r o p a g at e d
through the Intern ational Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank, the Washington Consensus has
been the dominant paradigm for development from
the early 1980s until the mid-1990s. Its introduction
entailed a total shift from earlier thinking, u s u a l l y
seen as a shift from state-led d i ri gi s m e to market-
o riented policies.
O ver the last few ye a rs ,t wo important challenges
to the Washington Consensus have emerged: firs t l y,
the UN D P’s sustainable human development approach
a n d ,s e c o n d l y, an emerging “ S o u t h e rn Consensus”,
founded on analyses made from the pers p e c t i ve of
c o u n t ries undertaking late industri a l i z ation and see-
king to catch up with rich countries in the global
e c o n o my.This Southern Consensus has not yet been
s u f ficiently elaborated to incorp o r ate predominantly
a gricultural economies of A f rica and the least deve-
loped countri e s. But it can be deduced from the
increasing convergence between the Latin A m e ri c a n
e x p e rience and East Asian development models.
The overselling of globalization
The sustainable human development approach
espouses a set of values different from those under-
pinning the Washington Consensus. Whereas the
Washington Consensus focuses on the promotion
of gross domestic product gr owth and has been
implemented through a top-dow n , d o n o r - c o n d i-
tionality-driven and outside-expert-led approach,
the sustainable human development approach
argues that development should improve the nat u r e
of people’s lives, and that it should be founded on
p a rt i c i p ation and a more equal part n e rship bet-
ween developing countries and aid donors.
M o r e ove r , the Washington Consensus has cracked
in the practical sense that real differences of opinion
h ave emerged in Wa s h i n g t o n ,b e t ween the IMF and the
World Bank,on the causes of the Asian crisis and how
best to handle it.The Chief Economist of the Bank,
Joseph Stiglitz, has argued that there is a need for a
“ p o s t - Washington Consensus” to achieve broader
o b j e c t i ves—higher living standards and equitable, s u s-
tainable and democratic development—using a wider
range of instruments to correct market fa i l u r e , to foster
c o m p e t i t i o n , and to control short - t e rm capital flow s.
It may be too early yet to announce the final
demise of the Washington Consensus despite Sti-
glitz’s critique,UNCTAD’s work in favour of a Sou-
t h e rn Pe rs p e c t i ve or the renewed emphasis on
p ove rty eradication resulting from the 1995 Copen-
hagen Summit for Social Development.
The emerging new consensus will be dri ven by the
main “ wo r k a b l e ” a l t e rn at i ve , East Asian models,
strengthened through their convergence with Lat i n
A m e rica experi e n c e , and adapted to A f rica and the
least developed countri e s.There are still serious obs-
tacles facing efforts to develop a more comprehensive
consensus that would finally be able to ove r c o m e
and reconcile the old ideological antinomies:m a r k e t
ve rsus stat e , p rice stability ve rsus economic gr ow t h ,
capital accumulation ve rsus income distri bu t i o n ,
competition and open integr ation into the world eco-
n o my ve rsus national industri a l i z ation and consoli-
d ation of a strong local productive capacity.
There will be a special difficulty in devising
strategies for long-term development in a world of
globalized money where speculat i ve attacks and
financial vo l atility can unravel and destroy in a
matter of weeks the economic growth and poverty
reduction achieved in 30 ye a rs , as happened recently
in Indonesia. In other wo r d s , here is where the pro-
blems of development and pove rty coincide with the
challenge of globalization.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall almost 10 years
a g o,g l o b a l i z ation was ove rsold to the public as a sure
way of bri n ging more accelerated gr owth and pros-
p e rity for all. But the record of economic gr owth in
the 1990s has been a dismal one, not only much
inferior to the exceptional rates of the 30 Glorious
Ye a rs of the post-war period but disappointing eve n
in comparison with the troubled 1970s. Still wo rs e ,
we are approaching the year 2000 without a solution
to the aggravation of the two most serious failures
of the twentieth century : mass unemployment and
growing inequality inside and among nations.
One of the problems with the conve n t i o n a l
approach to globalization is that it is too narrow. It
usually reduces and impoverishes a complex phe-
nomenon to just one of its components, t h e

e conomic unific ation of commercial markets, i nve s t-
ment opportunities and financial markets on a pla-
n e t a ry scale. In that reductionist way, we miss the ri c h
d i ve rsity of what actually is an historic process with
a ve ry strong cultural element. A rising out of the
breakthroughs in electronics and telecommunica-
tions which constitute the first scientific revolution to
change our perceptions of time and space, unlike the
previous ones that dealt basically with energy and
m at t e r , g l o b a l i z ation represents the unific ation of
the planet for human interaction and mutual know-
l e d g e .But scientific and technological breakthroughs
are no guarantees in themselves that the new tech-
niques will be used not to dominate but to liberat e
and promote human beings. In the past, it was pre-
cisely the scientific revolution of Galileo and Newton
which gave the West the technological superi o rity that
made colonialism and imperialism possible.
The situation now is certainly more decisive in
t e rms both of promise and threat s. I n d e e d , n e ve r
before has knowledge become so crucial as to consti-
tute the ve ry condition for deve l o p m e n t .As we move
away from a type of economy where success wa s
d e t e rmined by capital, cheap labour or abundance of
resources towards one that is know l e d g e - i n t e n s i ve ,t h e
monopoly of inform ation and technology may easily
become a frightening weapon for domination and
o p p r e s s i o n , the roots of inequality.
We are beginning to understand the first prin-
ciples of a new branch of economics, information
economics. The old presumption was that infor-
m ation had a zero or negligible cost.We now know
t h at inform ation has a cost and that this cost of tran-
saction may be the difference between economic
success or failure.Without access to information
there will be no access to markets.The market solu-
tion will not always be the optimal solution because
markets are systems to process and convey infor-
m ation and they are never perfect in performing this
t a s k .F i rms and economic actors , people and gove rn-
m e n t s , h ave to deal with inform ation and some
will prove more able at it than others.Those who are
well educated and who have good access to infor-
m ation and knowledge will prevail in a highly com-
p e t i t i ve wo r l d .W h at will happen then to the legi o n s
of losers in the global competition, unskilled wor-
k e rs in rich countries or marginalized countri e s
and continents like A f rica? To take care of them, we
will have to redefine the concept of competition as
a game that not only needs clear rules and an impar-
tial arbiter, as in the World Trade Organizat i o n , bu t
also, like all games, requires training, preparation
and educat i o n . In the same way as one has to learn
how to play a game, nations need to learn how to
produce, how to trade, how to compete. Govern-
ments and international organizations must strive
to make inform ation and knowledge available to all
in an equal way.
The return of Adam Smith
E ven if we find how to share inform ation and
k n owledge in such a way as to allow widespread eco-
nomic development of all or most countri e s , this will
not guarantee per se a fair and balanced distri bution of
the results among all cat e g o ries of citizens.A c c e l e r at e d
economic gr owth is certainly a necessary condition for
rapid pove rty reduction, as was demonstrated in
China and Asian countries in general. It is not,
h owe ve r , a sufficient condition, as we have learn e d
from some Latin A m e rican examples of extreme
c o n c e n t r ation of wealth and income and from what is
n ow happening in many industrialized societies.
We still do not know enough about how to
balance growth and distribution, or reward initia-
t i ve with relat i ve equality. D e ve l o p m e n t ,p ove rty and
globalization are problems that will only be solved
if we go back to the ori ginal approach to economics
as “political economy ” , as part of what Adam Smith
t a u g h t : moral philosophy, t h at is, the economy as a
product of the “ p o l i s ” , the city of human beings. N o t
as the planetary system whose laws we cannot
change, but something that is the result of societal
choices based on shared values. And the first of all
values is that the economy was created for man
and not man for the economy.This is the only way
to promote genuine hope, and faith that the future
will be better than the past. n
