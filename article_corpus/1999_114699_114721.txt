better known as “ Ta s i n i Vs The New Yo rk
Ti m e s” , attracted widespread attention as
this was the first new media copyright case
of its sort in the United States. In 1997, a
l ower court ruled in favour of the
p u b l i s h e rs ,s aying the existing US copyri g h t
l aw allowed the publishers to reuse
c o n t ri butions “in any revision of that
c o l l e c t i o n .”The case has now moved to the
appeals court.
“The present US copyright law does
not state explicitly anything about
electronic ri g h t s. C o u rts have just begun to
consider wri t e rs ’ claims and there are
demands to include electronic rights in the
existing law,” says Carlinsky.
On the other side of the A t l a n t i c,
though there are no specific regulations as
yet gove rning the use of journ a l i s t i c
m at e rial in the electronic media, j o u rn a l i s t s
and authors in many We s t e rn European
and Scandinavian countries have reached
partial or full agreements with publishers
over copyrights and the Internet.
Copyright law 
that benefits authors
“The existing European authors ’ ri g h t s
law is sufficient to handle the pay dispute
b e t ween wri t e rs and publishers in
electronic publishing. H owe ve r , the system
is different in Anglo-Saxon law,” s ay s
R e n ate Schroeder, of the Bru s s e l s - b a s e d
European Federation of Journalists.
The copyright law generally followed in
S c a n d i n avian countri e s , as well as in France
and Germany, benefits the authors. When
m at e rial is used again in electronic
p u b l i s h i n g, a u t h o rs have the right to be
consulted as to where and how it is used
and to receive extra pay m e n t . For example,

With Internet spreading like wildfire,
authors around the world have been
c l a m o u ring for protection of their
c o p y ri g h t s. H owe ve r , this has resulted in
an increasingly tough battle with publishers
who want writers to sign a contract giving
away all rights,including electronic.
Until a few ye a rs ago, a u t h o rs and
journalists may not have bothered to scan
through their work contracts with regard
to copyrights. In fact,many magazines did
not even send contracts to authors. N ow
both sides are careful about the mention of
“ c o p y ri g h t s ” in the contract for reuse of
a rticles and other creat i ve work in Intern e t
and electronic database systems.
A u t h o rs argue that print publishing is a
one-time event bri n ging in one set of
r e ve n u e s , including adve rt i s e m e n t s.On the
other hand, m at e rials in electronic
publications can be used repeatedly, each
time potentially generating new
a d ve rtisement reve n u e s.“So we tell authors
that it’s a big mistake to grant permanent
rights for a one-time fee,” s ays Dan
Carlinsky, vice president of the American
Society of Jo u rnalists and A u t h o rs (ASJA),
New York.
While some publishers are ready to pay,
o t h e rs maintain that once authors cede
their rights they cannot claim additional
payments for reuse of their material. In a
case filed in 1993, a group of freelancers in
New York challenged publishers and
electronic reusers of published wo r k ,
claiming copyright infri n g e m e n t .The case,

their rights
the leading French daily Le Monde e n t e r e d
into a two-year agreement with its staff in
1996 on electronic rights. From its annual
e a rnings through electronic publicat i o n s ,
it pays a percentage of its revenue from
online editions and CD-ROM to all its staff
m e m b e rs , whether or not their work has
been used.“This agreement is the first of its
kind in France and it is working well,” says
Michel Colonna d’Istri a , chief of L e
Monde’s multi-media services.
On the other hand, in the A n g l o - S a x o n
c o p y right model used in the US and the
UK and adapted also by the Netherlands,
publishers can and do use their economic
p ower to gain the right to reuse articles and
other creat i ve mat e rials after making a one-
off pay m e n t . A u t h o rs in these three
c o u n t ries claim that the present law denies
the right to compensation for the reuse of
their mat e ri a l s. In 1997, h owe ve r , t h r e e
Dutch journalists for the first time won a
c o u rt case against the newspaper d e

articles without permission on CD-ROM
and the World-Wide Web.
The UK-based Ja n e ’s Inform at i o n
G r o u p, publisher of Ja n e ’s defence
m a g a z i n e s , demands all rights from authors
around the world for both print and
electronic editions. The magazine gr o u p
maintains that its one-off fee includes all
f o rms of delive ry. “So far no one has
complained,” says a Jane’s spokesperson.
Mike Holderness, who is active in the
campaign for electronic rights in the UK
for the National Union of Jo u rn a l i s t s
( N U J ) , s ays that the A n g l o - A m e ri c a n
c o p y right system gi ves economic adva n t a g e
to publishers and denies benefit to authors.
“There is an obvious need to harm o n i z e
c o p y right laws within the European
Union,” he says. ■
