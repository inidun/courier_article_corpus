"1 Tational parks are universally
% recognized as places of excep-
1 tional beauty and of major
I importance as regards the flora
- - ' and fauna that countries are
trying to preserve and protect. We
should not, however, underestimate
the threats to which they are
exposed ifwe want to ward off those
threats. The world's first national
park, Yellowstone, was created in
the western United States in 1872, at
the height of the industrial revolu¬
tion. Today, there are more than
8,500 national parks in 120 coun¬
tries, totalling about 850 million
hectares almost three times the
size of India. In the beginning, these
parks, not to be confused with the
biosphere reserves Unesco began
designating in 1971, were above all
places for leisure and meditation,

but they are now tending to become
conservation areas. The two pur¬
poses are difficult to reconcile,
insofar as the ever-growing "smoke¬
less industry" of tourism has a
potentially considerable destruc¬
tive impact. It is also becoming
increasingly difficult to find unin¬
habited areas to protect, as the
human population continues to
grow and as agriculture, industry
and urban development take up
more and more space.
A national park, according to the
World Conservation Union (IUCN),
"contains one or more ecosystems
not materially altered by human
activity and it contains fauna, flora,
geomorphological sites, and habi¬
tats of scientific, educational and
recreational interest"; it may also
contain a natural landscape ofgreat
beauty. When creating a park, the
authorities must take steps "to pre¬
vent or eliminate . . . exploitation or
occupation" in the whole area. Visi¬
tors are allowed to enter for "educa¬
tional . . . and recreational purposes".
The purposes so defined are much
more difficult to implement than it
may seem. The first parks were
28
established by coercive means (the
"fences and fines" method), but it
soon became apparent that no bar¬
rier or law could prevent local pop¬
ulations from farming the land,
poaching, cutting down trees or even
practising slash-and-burn cultiva¬
tion methods in order to survive.
Worse still, how could they allow
themselves to be evicted from their
land in order to protect the natural
environment?
DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION
Such operations sometimes work
well. Brazil's Iguaçu National Park
and the Guastopo park in Venezuela
were emptied of their inhabitants,
and the government compensated
and relocated hundreds of families.
However, the Brazilian government
took the opposite approach in 1961
when it set up the Xingu National
Park and moved in seventeen tribes
whose land had been confiscated.
Some of them took legal action
against the government to reclaim
their former territories because they
could not adapt to the unfamiliar
ecosystems. In 1985, after several
banana plantations in Costa Rica
had been abandoned, 800 unem¬
ployed labourers and their families
invaded the Corcovado National
Park on the Osa Peninsula, and
began prospecting for gold, pol¬
luting the rivers with sediment and
mercury. A court order gave the
police powers to evict them after
they had been indemnified, but no
sooner had they left than other
prospectors arrived, setting off
armed conflicts. At Khao Yai, Thai¬
land, the creation of a 2,200 km2
park led to a bloody battle between
wardens and villagers, with fatalities
on both sides. Despite strict pro¬
tection measures, poaching and tree
cutting continued, with the result
that 5 per cent of the forest has been
destroyed and 5 to 10 per cent has
suffered damage.
The situation in the parks in the
areas ofarmed conflict in west and
central Africa is no better. Gérard
Sournia, director of the French
branch of IUCN, who has spent
many years there, says: "By defini¬
tion sparsely populated in time of
peace, parks and the species that
inhabit them can offer, in time of
war, many advantages not only to
the belligerents but also to the local
people, as zones of incursion or safe
havens, out-of-the-way battlefields
or new sources of supplies and
commodities, such as ivory and
rhino horn, that can be sold to buy
arms, or as land to be used for sub¬
sistence farming there are many
claims on their territory". For thirty
years, international, civil or tribal
wars have been raging in this corner
of the world, and parks in Rwanda,
Zaire, Niger, Senegal, Mali, Mauri¬
tania, Togo and Chad are paying a
high price. Animals are scattered
during the fighting or gunned down
with automatic weapons, as in
Zaire's Virunga National Park and
the Queen Elizabeth National Park
in Uganda. Such disorders, Gérard
Sournia stresses, discourage inter¬
national co-operation and fund-
raising efforts. "In Niger," he writes,
"and more precisely in the Ai'r-
Ténéré region, the Tuareg rebellion,
the taking of hostages among staff
and employees of the reserve (of
whom at least two have lost their
lives), threats against expatriates
and the theft of equipment, espe¬
cially vehicles, have led IUCN,
which heads the project, acting in
accord with the funding sources
and local authorities, to withdraw its
personnel to the capital and sus¬
pend the project". To take another
example, during the 1960s, over 70
per cent of Uganda's tourist busi¬
ness came from its Murchison Falls
Park, and growth rates in tourist
spending reached nearly 25 per cent
per year, but following Idi Amin's
1971 military coup tourism came
to a halt and was even banned two
years later. Visitors are returning
with the new-found political sta¬
bility and are helping the economy
get back on its feet.
TOURISM'S PROS AND CONS
A remarkable document, Industry
andEnvironment, published by the
United Nations Environment Pro¬
gramme (UNEP) in 1992, reveals
that "tourism's share of GNP in, for
instance, Tunisia is 6 per cent, in
Barbados 32 per cent, and in the
Maldives 18 per cent". Tourism is a
major world industry with an
annual investment in capital pro¬
jects ofmore than $400 billion, and
more than 130 million employees
serving over 450 million people trav¬
elling internationally, and ten times
as many travelling domestically. For
some countries, such as Kenya,
tourism is the primary source of
hard currency. In Amboseli National
Park, animals are worth far more
alive than dead: American
researcher David Western estimates
the value of a single lion as a tourist
attraction to be $27,000 a year, while
an elephant herd may be worth as
much as $610,000 per year. On the
other hand, the growing number of

The Iguaçu vehicles tracking cheetahs, a tourist
Falls, Brazil. favourite, has become a threat to
their existence. Another difficulty
is that the land was originally the
territory of the pastoral Masai, who
are aggrieved that, while their tra¬
ditional hunting practices have
been forbidden, they do not share in
tourism's benefits. In Nepal, as the
UNEP study points out, "young men
have virtually ceased to enter the
monasteries ... to become priests,
choosing instead the more lucra¬
tive life working in support of
trekking and climbing expeditions
in the Himalayas". These sherpas
invest the money they make in
building bigger houses, a threat to
forests since they require more fire¬
wood to heat, or they buy more live¬
stock, thereby increasing grazing
impacts.
The situation is different in
developed countries. Some very
beautiful parks, victims oftheir own
success, are literally invaded in the
holiday season. Every summer,
more than 800,000 people visit La
Vanoise National Park in the French
Alps. Some days, its trails are
crowded with thousands of people
looking at the flowers and observing
the wildlife. Elsewhere, the craze
for off-road vehicles four-wheel
drives, all-terrain motorcycles and
mountain bikes is causing irre¬
versible damage to soils. It is not
enough to ban them; ways have to
be found of enforcing the ban. The
problem here is not only one ofedu¬
cating the public, but also of
recruiting, training and paying
enough wardens. In France, there
are between ten and seventy war¬
dens per park, as enthusiastic as
they are badly paid. Theywatch over
the park, help scientists with
research on the flora and fauna, and
provide visitors with information.
In some reserves, they are also in
charge of buildings that house a
system of cameras that allow visi¬
tors, for example, to engage in bird-
watching without disturbing the
birds. In such cases, the park has
only one purpose, to protect a nat¬
ural environment to which humans
are not allowed access. In the same
vein, some "conservationists" have
suggested that parks reduce to
between 2 and 3 per cent the area
open to the public, and set up a
scaled-down reproduction of the
parks' most spectacular landscapes
outside the parks themselves in
order to keep visitors away.
Couldn't we do better? Last
December, a meeting was held in
the United States, attended by 100
people, mainly U.S. biosphere
reserve managers and representa¬
tives from various federal and local
authorities, to work out a plan of
action for the American biosphere
reserves. This important initiative
will greatly contribute to the
strengthening of the World Network
ofBiosphere Reserves, the situation
and status ofwhich will be reviewed
in March 1995 at a UNESCO-orga-
nized conference in Seville. Even
though they do not always achieve
all they set out to do, these reserves
are superior in conception to
national parks, since they take the
conservation ofbiodiversity and of
ecosystems as their starting point,
participate in an international
research and management network
and, above all, combine environ¬
ment and development, so safe¬
guarding the quality of life of local
populations.
