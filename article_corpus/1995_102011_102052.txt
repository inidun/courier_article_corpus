Protecting
plant lift
by France Bequette
hue first European Conference on) t the Conservatio of Wild Plants
was held in September at Hyeres
(France), at a time when 25, 000
wild plants are threatened with
extinction. The Conference, entitled
"Planta Europa", was co-sponsored
by Plantlife, a charity dedicated to
saving wild plants, and by the
French Ministry of the Environment.
It was attended by 200 experts from
thirty European countries
In his inaugural address, the
well-known British botanist and
environmentalist David Bellamy,
president of Plantlife, noted that
plants have for too long been too
low on the list of conservation con-
cerns."Pandas may reign supreme
as the logo for the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF),"he said,
"but as every schoolchild will tell
you they are totally dependent on
bamboo both for their habitat and
their staple diet."

THE THREATS
David Bellamy went on to list the
"seven deadly sins that threaten the
flora of Europe"as"changes in land
use practice including : 1) extensive
and intensive farming based on ever
larger fields and the reseeding of
meadows and pastures with
nitrogen-hungry monocultures ; 2)
the replacement of the rural work
force, crop rotation, fallow and
mixed farming by machines and an
armamentarium of chemicals ; 3) the
eutrophication of water due to the
excessive use of fertilizers and inten-
sification of animal husbandry
including the foddering of sheep and
cattle on heath-, moor-and bogland ;
4) drainage on a massive scale
including the loss of water meadows
and farm ponds ; 5) road-building
dissecting viable populations of
plants and the animals and insects
which depend on them and upon
which they depend ; 6) acidification
due to the increasing use of fossil
fuels and the replacement of native
woodlands and coppice with exotic
conifers ; 7) overgrazing by sheep,
cattle and other herbivores."
The some 12, 000 species of
flowers and ferns in Europe are also
under threat from environmental
degradation due to the intensifica-
tion of farming, industrial and
urban expansion, the growth of
tourism and uncontrolled extrac-
tion of natural resources. Twenty-
five higher plant and fern species no
longer exist in their wild state, and
many more have been reduced to a
very small number of specimens.
The situation is particularly wor-
rying since the distribution of bio-
logical diversity worldwide is irreg-
ular. Europe is responsible for sev-
eral plant-life territories of
worldwide interest in such areas as
the Alps, the Pyrenees, the
Seed preserved in
cold storage at the
Botanical
Conservatory in
Brest (France).
Spanish mountain chains, the
Balkan mountains, the Mediter-
ranean basin and its islands, the
Canaries and the Azores.
The first thing that must be
done is to catalogue all the world's
plant species, and this will be a
long, costly and complicated job. In
Europe, for example, botany as a
discipline has lost much of the
prestige it once had, except in
Spain where there are a number of
top-level botanists. It is gradually
being overshadowed by disciplines
such as molecular biology. Some
wags have even begun to wonder
whether present-day researchers,
with their eyes glued to electronic
microscopes, could tell a field of
barley from a field of wheat !
THE RESPONSES
And yet international legal tools to
protect plant life do exist. The
Washington Convention on Interna-
tional Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
came into force in 1982 in more
than 130 countries. And Europe's
wildlife and environment have been
protected by the Bern Convention
since 1979. Despite these regula-
tions, however, indigenous plant
populations are still being plun-
dered to meet the demands of the
horticulture business. In the 1980s
Southern Europe and Turkey
exported between 50 and 70 mil-

lion bulbs per year, mainly to the
Netherlands but also to the United
Kingdom and Germany.
The best way to protect plants
in their natural habitats is to estab-
lish protected areas. According to
two French experts in natural
resources, Matthieu Glachant and
Francis Leveque, there are a total
of 4. 85 million am2 of such areas,
covering 3. 7 per cent of the earth's
land surface, including biosphere
reserves, parks and natural reserves
of all sizes. But it is difficult to
provide proper protection in
densely populated regions. It would
be a pity if we could no longer see
wild plants growing in nature and
had to look them up in dried plant
collections, even collections as rich
as those in Geneva (5 million speci-
mens) and Vienna (3. 8 million).
Botanical gardens and seed or
pollen banks provide for the con-
servation of plants outside their
natural habitat. A Council of
Europe study published in 1994
notes that the world's 2, 500 botan-
ical gardens play an important role
in scientific research and in the con-
servation of endangered species,
and that it is in them that the
greatest variety of plant species-
roughly 80, 000-are found outside
natural ecosystems. Using speci-
mens grown in botanical gardens
many countries, including Aus-
tralia, Russia and the United
States, have created national data
banks for rare or endangered
indigenous plants."Red Books"
compiled by some countries on
their endangered plant life are also
valuable conservation tools.
Extremely rigorous techniques
must be used for collecting, freeze-
drying or vacuum storage of speci-
mens in seed and plant tissue
banks. But in France, for example,
such facilities have been instru-
mental in restoring to life a certain
variety of club moss of which only
one sterile fragment had survived.
This raises the problem of how
far a plant population or its habitat
should be modified to ensure the
survival of the species. Take, for
example, the narcissi that grow on
the Glenan group of islands off
France's Brittany coast. They were
dying out, partly through being
trampled on by tourists and partly
because their bulbs were being
removed. Their habitat was fenced
off to protect them, but trees and
bushes grew and smothered the
flowers. A solution was found by
introducing sheep, which do not
eat narcissi. The introduction of
foreign plants can also pose prob-
lems. A pretty flowering plant
called the Hottentot fig (Carpo-
brotus edulis), originally from
South Africa, is spreading along
the coasts of the Mediterranean
and California and smothering
endemic plants. After rashly intro-
ducing St. John's Wort into their
country, Australians had to import
an insect that preys on this invasive
plant. Australians are also faced
with the proliferation of gum suc-
cory (Chondrilla juncea), which
originated in the Middle East and
has such a tough stalk that it is dif-
ficult to scythe.
All the same it was reassuring to
find out from the"Planta Europa"
conference what naturalists are
doing on a worldwide scale to pro-
tect wild plants, for plants are not
only a source of pleasure but also
potential food and medicine for
tomorrow. N

THE RHINOCEROS IS ALIVE AND (FAIRLY)
WELL IN ZIMBABWE
The Pan-African News Agency (PANA) reports
that in the last 18 months, the Zimbabwe
Society for the Protection of the Rhinoceros
has not registered a single case of poaching in
the four protected sites it has established.
When Zimbabwe became independent in 1980
the rhinoceros population numbered several
thousands. Now there are only 300 left.
Poachers sell rhino horns, which are used to
make so-called aphrodisiac powder and as
scabbards for swords, for as much as
$US90, 000 each. The Harare government has
invested 500, 000 Zimbabwe dollars (about
$US62, 500) to protect the survivors.
GLOBAL WARMING :
A CLOUDY OUTLOOK
Researchers at the United States'National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in
Boulder, Colorado, report that clouds absorb
about four times as much solar energy as had
been previously thought, and by using the
new values have arrived at preliminary results
that predict a warmer, drier climate than that
shown previously. An NCAR study of the tiny
particles that form the nuclei of cloud

burning of tropical forests may be the largest
source of these particles, other cloud con-
densation nuclei being dust and sea salt. The
increase in nuclei could result in a decrease in
rainfall.
WENO'S R) S) NG DDE OF WASTE
Abo. ut 17, 000 people live on Wendo Island,
capital of Chuuk State (Federated States of
Micronesia). Weno, whose area is just under
20 km2, has a serious solid-waste problem.
Because of a quarrel between land-owners and
the government about land use, the existing
disposal site has been closed. When a repre-
sentative of the World Health Organization
(WHO) visited Weno last year, he found that
there was no public service for the collection
of solid waste, so that people had to trans-
port their waste to the public dump them-
selves. However, since neither the dump nor
its access road are well-maintained, illegal
dumping has increased. Even with the road in
good repair, a new site will have to be opened
up sooner or later. But where ? Weno's waste
disposal problem is one being faced by many
communities all over the world.
DONKEYS FIGHT BATTLE
AGAINSTDUNES
The June 1995 issue of the French magazine
Secheresse contains an article co-authored by
Professor Pierre Rognon of Paris and Jean Meu-
nier, an agronomist living in Mauritania,
describing how the latter has developed a
simple, effective and inexpensive way of halting
desert advance. Saplings are planted in wire-
mesh cylinders wrapped in plastic bags, and are
watered at root-level via a system of buried
plastic bottles linked to a bottle acting as a
funnel from the surface. After 6 months, the
saplings are 2. 5 metres tall, enough to stabilize
the sand. The cheapest way to bring in the
water is on donkey-back, and Meunier has
developed a rubber sandal to increase the
bearing surface of donkeys'hooves and pre-
vent them from sinking into the soft sand.
ONE WOMAN, MANY TREES
The 1994 annual report of Switzerland's Depart-
ment of Development and Humanitarian Aid
(DDA) tells the heartening story of Mariam
Begum, of Bangladesh. Mariam, who never
attended school and learned to read and write
through an adult literacy programme, started a
nursery on 280 m2 of land lent to her by the
state. Three years later she was working on an
area ten times bigger. In 1994 she sold 10, 000
trees and earned ten times the average
Bangladeshi income. She hired a full-time
employee, and her husband joined her busi-
ness. Now Mariam has become a forestry con-
sultant and plants trees for wealthy landowners.
Because of entrepreneurs like her, more than
two million trees have been planted in
Bangladesh since the DDA-supported forestry
programme was started nine years ago.
THE WATER HYACINTH
STRIKES AGAIN
Burkina Faso is the latest African country (see
UNESCO Courier, May 1995, p. 47) to be threat-
ened by the water hyacinth, a small, floating
water plant with round leaves and beautiful
pale-blue flowers. According to the Burkina
Faso Botanical and Technoiogicai Research
Institute, the hyacinth encourages evapora-
tion. If it spreads to the dams of Kompienga
and Bagre, the water supply of the country's
capital, Ouagadougou, will be jeopardized. A
media campaign has been launched in the
national languages, calling on people to
destroy the water hyacinth before the advent
of the rainy season. If the campaign fails, it
will cost several million dollars to get rid of the
troublesome plant.
