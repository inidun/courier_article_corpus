IN the industrialized countries, 3.3 per cent of the adult
population is illiterate. For the developing countries as a
whole thefigure is 35 per cent, and rises as high as 60 per
cent in the 47 least developed countries. In the develop¬
ing countries, some 130 million children in the 6- to 11-
year age-group and 277 million in the 12- to 17-year
age-group are not enrolled in school. Throughout the world
there are 44 million teachers in the formal education sys¬
tem, 


and millions of other people working in various capa¬
cities who transmit their knowledge on an informal basis.
They all need the written word in order to share their know¬
ledge. Education and culture need books, magazines, and
newspapers.
Paper accounts for 30 to 50 per cent of the total cost of
publishing, and this percentage can be as high as 60 per
cent in countries where the paper industry is still in its
infancy. It is very difficult for paper users in the non-indus¬
trialized countries to obtain supplies, especially because of
the bewildering terminology used by specialists.
Many users in the South are askingfor assistance in order¬
ing "cultural" paper, the kind used for books and news¬
papers, which is usually imported, and in hewing it deliver¬
ed. Paper Users Clubs have been set up in Jamaica and the
Dominican Republic. Buying paper wholesale, in the form
of roll stock rather than sheets, can reduce costs. In
Tanzania, small and medium-sized printers and publishers
have joined together, with a view to collaborating and
increasing self-reliance. A Paper Users' Manual has been
published and publishers' practical training programmes
are being planned.
To promote literacy and the right to culture and defend a
certain idea of communication is to defend the cause of
paper.

World
Although the United States tooic
an early lead in wind technology,
the use of wind power there got
off to a shaky start in the 1980s.
After earning a reputation for
being an unreliable energy
source, wind is now making a
brisk comeback. Greatly improv¬
ed machines with highly effi¬
cient turbines are relatively
simple to operate and cheap to
use. Production costs per kilo
watt-hour are falling steadily. In
the United States wind power
already generates a total of 1,600
megawatts, or enough electricity
to meet the domestic needs of a
city like San Francisco. But the
most advanced development pro¬
grammes for this clean and re¬
newable energy source are to be
found in Europe, especially in
Germany, the Netherlands and
Denmark.
Although environmentalists are
stepping up their protests against
dams, and the Aswan High Dam
has been a special target of criti¬
cism, Asit K. Biswas, former
President of the International
Water Resources Association, has
come forward with a more posi¬
tive assessment of the Egyptian
26
dam. "The huge costs of building
the dam are estimated to have
been recovered within only two
years," he writes, "through
increases in agricultural produc¬
tion and hydropower generation.
The dam also proved its value to
the country's economy through
years of sustained drought and
potentially catastrophic floods.
Although there are environmental
problems resulting from the
dam's construction, many
including riverbed erosion and
the effects on fishing have
proved much less severe than at
first feared. Others, such as an
increase in waterborne diseases,
have been shown to be mainly
due to lack of sanitation."
According to Biswas, the High
Dam has made "significant bene¬
ficial contributions to Egypt's
overall development."
Between 1940 and 1990, popu¬
lation growth in the United States
was greater along the coastlines,
especially the AÜantic and Pacific
coasts, than elsewhere in the
country. In 1990, nearly half of all
Americans lived within 80 km of
the sea. Population growth is lead¬
ing to forms of development that
threaten wildlife and the ecologi¬
cal balance in these areas. The
same trends are also found
planetwide: 60 per cent of the
world's population today live
within 60 km of the sea. According
to a United Nations forecast, this
proportion will rise to three-quart¬
ers by the year 2000.
In his 1556 treatise on mining,
De Re Metallica, the German geo¬
logist Georgius Agrícola wrote:
"The fields are devastated by
mining operations	 Woods and
groves are cut down, for there is
need of an endless amount of
wood for timber, machines, and
the smelting of metals. And when
the woods and groves are felled,
then are exterminated the beasts
and birds. . . . Further, when the
ores are washed, the water which
has been used poisons the brooks
and streams, and either destroys
the fish or drives them away."
Today, four centuries later,
mining projects threaten nearly
half the national parks in tropical
countries. The smelting of ores
releases millions of tons of sul¬
phur dioxide and other pollutants
into the atmosphere each year. It
has created as many as 10,000
hectares of biological wasteland
and accounts for much of the
world's acid rain. Yet there is little
discussion of the impact of
mining on the environment. It
will not be easy to reduce indus¬
try's global appetite for minerals,
but this is clearly a problem that
will have to be closely watched.

Venezuela has the highest rate
of urbanization in South America
today. During the 1970s and
1980s, considerable numbers of
Venezuelans migrated to urban
areas, hoping to benefit from the
oil boom. Many of them ended up
in barrios, low-income squatter
settlements that sprang up on the
edge of the major cities. There are
twice as many barrios today as
there were in 1978. Barrio resi¬
dents are needy and have no legal
title to the land they occupy. A
$40 million World Bank loan has
been made to help FUNDACO-
MUN, the Venezuelan agency res-
ponsible for improving living
conditions in the barrios. A plan
for granting land ownership to
barrio residents will be launched
to give residents an incentive to
upgrade their homes.
A Friends of the Earth group
has been establi^shed in Lomé,
Togo. 


With the help of a French
nongovernmental organization,
Solidarité Forêt, its Togolese
members have undertaken a tree-
planting campaign. They have
planted plots of eucalyptus to
provide villages in the Kioto
region with firewood, and teak to
counter desertification. One nur¬
sery will produce 15,000 saplings
of a variety of species intended to
provide shade in streets, public
squares, and gardens.
Cameroon, a country often
considered to be a microcosm of
Africa because of the many types
of climate and soil that are found
there, is facing many environmen¬
tal problems, including desertifi¬
cation in the north, marine pollu¬
tion offshore in the south,
anarchic forest exploitation, and
random dumping of industrial and
domestic wastes. In April 1992, on
the occasion of the Earth Summit
in Rio, the government of
Cameroon decided to set up a
Ministry of the Environment and
Forests. A group of international
experts was asked to study the
situation and provide the new
minister with a general policy pro¬
posal. A multidisciplinary mission
visited Cameroon in September
1992 not only to make suggestions
but also to propose specific
actions and to develop the
contacts needed to secure funding
for them. This is an experiment
that will be fascinating to follow.

The story on this page appears in an
anthobgy entitled Compdignons du Soleil
("Companions oftile Sun") co-published (in
French) by Unesco, Editions La Découverte
(Paris) and the Fondation pour le progrès de
l'Homme. The anthology has been prepared
under the general editorship ofthe African
historian Joseph Ki-Zerbo, in collaboration with
Marie-Josephe Beaud.
FOR a long time, there was no Sun,
only a Moon and stars. This was
before there were men on Earth,
when there were only four-footed
animals and birds, which were seve¬
ral times bigger than they are today.
One day, Dinewan the emu and
Brälgah the Australian crane were
standing on a broad plain near the
river Murrumbidgee. They were
quarrelling and fighting. In a fit of
anger, Brälgah ran to Dinewan's
nest, seized one of the large eggs in it
and threw it as hard as he could into
the sky. It broke into pieces against a
pile offirewood, which burst into
flames when the yolk touched it The
flames lit up the Earthly world, to
the great astonishment of all the
living beings, which until then had
been accustomed to living in semi-
darkness and were blinded by the
sudden burst oflight.
A kindly spirit in the sky saw how
brilliant and beautiful the Earth
was when that flame flared up. It
thought that it would be a good
thing to make such a fire every day.
And that is what it has been doing
ever since. Every night, the spirit and
its helpers gather firewood, which
they build up into a pile. When the
pile is large enough, they send the
Morning Star to warn the beings on
Earth that thefire will soon be lit
When the spirits light the fire, it
does not give off much heat But by
midday, the whole pile is on fire and
the heat is terrific. Then it gradually
dies down, and when evening comes
only a few red embers are left, which
die out altogether, apart from some
which the spirits cover with clouds,
so that another fire can be lit on the
following day. Text @ Editions La
Découverte and
