Read, write  
and succeed
Women are the future of mankind, 
the saying goes. True, they run the 
household, raise the children and till 
the soil alongside their spouses. This 
is why ANFEAE made them the prior-
ity. The association addresses mainly 
women in Ethiopia’s more remote 
regions, stressing literacy and family 
planning. 
Before, families in Beke – a small 
community 56 km north of Addis 
Ababa, where ANFEAE established a 
centre for adults in 2003 – were very 
large, despite their meager incomes. 
In Ethiopia, notably in rural areas, 
having many children is considered 
genuine wealth, even without the 
means to raise them. 
Today in Beke, thanks to ANFEAE’s 
non-formal education programmes, 
20 women aged 28 to 65 have suc-
ceeded in finding their place in the 
economic system and thus become 
independent. They are gaining men’s 
“Before, we knew nothing about 
sheep, poultr y, dif ferent 
kinds of vegetables, and even less 
about family planning. It was ANFEAE 
who taught us all that,” explains 
Workenesh Getachew, a 39-year-old 
farmer and mother of six children. 
Since she signed up for the “Literacy 
Plus” programme, Workenesh earns 
as much as 300 birr a month (about 
US$30) selling eggs from imported 
hens (which lay more than local hens) 
as well as vegetables she grows in 
her kitchen garden with seeds pro-
vided by ANFEAE. This income sup-
plements earnings from the village’s 
annual grain harvest. It may seem a 
paltry sum, but her family is now able 
to make ends meet. 
Workenesh is even able to save 
money, instead of being completely 
dependent on her husband like 
before, as women in her village gen-
erally are. Though at first her hus-
band was hard to convince– he 
thought spending two hours in class 
twice a week was a waste of time!

Writing workshops, business

offered by the “Literacy Plus” 
programme launched by the 
Adult and Non-Formal Education 
Association in Ethiopia (ANFEAE), 
for which the NGO received 
one of the two 2008 UNESCO 
Confucius Prizes for Literacy.

respect with their learning. The asso-
ciation is bridging the gap left by 
the formal educational system. 
Founded in 1995 and operational 
since 1997, ANFEAE aims to educate 
the least privileged, mainly in rural 
areas. According to a survey con-
ducted by the Ethiopian Ministry of 
National Education in 2001, illiteracy 
concerns 30% of the population, 
living mostly in the countryside. 
Public spending on education 
increased by 26% in 2000-2001 to 
face the problem. And primary school 
enrolment increased from 61% in 
2001 to 68.4% in 2004. Enrolment of 
girls in the same period rose from 
41 to 59.1%. 
ANFEAE is active in only three regions 
within the country (Oromiya, Amhara 
and Gambella) but the “Literacy Plus” 
project is an undeniable success. “We 
have reached about 8000 adults in 
the country,” says NGO director 
Alemayehu Haily Gebre. According to 
a survey his group conducted of 3000 
women, out of the total of 6200 that 
took part  … 

African leaders to meet the develop-
ment goals they have set them-
selves. Education is crucial for 
integrating the new realit ies 
imposed by globalization, in order 
to understand them and develop an 
African adaptation. It is the essen-
tial tool African societies can use to 
stop the progress of HIV and AIDS, 
generate responses to global busi-
ness challenges and above all, win 
the fight against poverty. 
Yet despite efforts made in recent 
years, girls are those who suffer the 
most from exclusion in the tradi-
tional educational system, which is 
furthermore unable to meet the 
diversity of educational needs. Non-
formal education in this context 
represents a godsend. It provides 
customized solutions for a popula-
tion that is often deprived by the 
formal system’s failures and defi-
ciencies.  
Some former learners become teach-
ers, after a month’s training. Each is 
responsible for 50 pupils and receives 
a monthly salary of US$45.
Customized education
Education for all in Africa, particu-
larly for women and young people, 
is a major challenge that demands 
resolute action on the part of 
… in the literacy programme, 
“Half of them, or 1500, increased 
their revenues by 25%,” he explains. 
He is proud of the results, though 
one concern remains: “Our goal was 
to enable these women to have 
access to microcredit, but NGOs are 
not allowed to engage in savings or 
lending activities.” 
“We have five centres and we can 
provide basic education, particularly 
to the poorest women,” the director 
adds. “We have also trained 1200 
civil servants in different districts 
and published 17 training manuals 
translated into four national 
languages.” 
Educational material is developed by 
a group consisting of teachers, 
learners and representatives from 
health and agriculture organizations. 
The training course lasts two years 
(300 hours of instruction in all) in 
classes of 25 participants, and costs 
a total of US$240,000, or less than 
US$40 per pupil. Funds come from 
USAID and SIDA via Pact Ethiopia, 
and the Addis Abeba World Bank 
Small Grant Programme as well as 
donations from ANFEAE members.
