SAD TAIL OF
GABROVO'S CATS
Cats had no easy life in
the town of Gabrovo, Bulgaria's
Internationally famous capital of
humour. The Gabrovians have
given themselves a reputation
totally unjustified for
stinginess. The story goes that
they cut off their cats' tails so
that the animals took less time
to pass through the doorway,
thus saving heat In winter.
So It's not suprising that a
tailless cat (right) is the symbol
of the festival of humour and
satire held in Gabrovo every
year. Satirically smiling cat on
dish (left) still has a tail, but it
will soon lose it (below) to the
astonishment of Gabrovo's dogs.

THE GIFT
OF THE GABROVO
how Bulgaria became famous
for good humour as well as yoghurt
by
Bogomil Gerasimov
ASK a Scot if he can tell you
where mini-skirts, tight trou¬
sers, gliders, the smallest coin in the
world or similar things were invented
and he knows immediately that a joke
about Aberdeen is coming up. Put the
question to a Bulgarian and he knows
that he can expect a quip about the
town of Gabrovo in central Bulgaria.
It was only a few years ago that_
"the British learned tö" their surprise that
Aberdeen's fame for stories of mean-

and journalist, has published an anthology of
Scottish jokes and anecdotes: From Aberdeen
with Laughter (in Bulgarian). He is the author
of several novels, television plays and film
scenarios.
ness is shared by Bulgaria's Gabro¬
vo and that Aberdonian and Gabrovo
jokes are astonishingly alike. And not
only the jokes, but also the sense
of humour behind them is identical.
This whole revelation on a new type
of town-twinning came about by pure
accident in 1967, when I was an offi¬
cial of the Bulgarian Embassy in Lon¬
don. I was joking with a British jour¬
nalist friend of mine about the fact
that both Bulgarian yoghurt and Scotch
whisky have achieved world-wide re¬
nown, when he asked me to tell him
a typically Bulgarian joke. So I told
him about the inhabitants of Gabrovo,
who are said to be extremely mean,
and far from resenting this reputation,
do their best to feed it by inventing
their- own "jokes and "even publishing
collections of them.
To illustrate my point I told him that
Gabrovo people stop their clocks and
watches during the night, in order not
to wear out the cogs. "But what do
they do when they want to know the
time at night?", asked my friend, and
before I could reply he added: "An
Aberdonian always keeps a trumpet be¬
neath his bed. When he wants to
know the time during the night, he
opens the window and lets off a blast
on it. There is always a neighbour who
will bang up his own window and
shout: 'Who's the idiot making that
racket at twenty past two in the morn¬
ing?'" Incredible, but true; the ending
was identical with that of the joke from
Gabrovo.
My friend seemed fascinated by the
Gabrovo sense of humour, and so I
told him a few more typical Gabrovo
stories. The Gabrovians dance bare¬
foot, so they can hear the music from
the next village... They put green spec¬
tacles on their horses, so that they
take straw for fresh grass..JThey.throw-
their cats down their chimneys to avoid
paying chimney-sweeps... They heat
their knives before dinner, so that
guests can't use the butter... They join
wildlife protection societies so that
their wives won't ask them for fur
coats...
Out of this conversation was born ^
the idea of organizing a competition for r

the best Gabrovo-type Scottish joke,
run in Glasgow, Scotland's largest city,
by the Da/7y Record newspaper. The
grand finale of the competition was, of
course, held in Aberdeen, where the
winners were awarded a free two-week
stay in Bulgarian holiday resorts, inclu¬
ding a special visit to Gabrovo.
The Daily Record headlined its report
of the final "The Night Aberdeen Dou¬
bled up with Laughter", and the Aber¬
deen Evening Express ran an article
headed "Humour links Aberdeen with
Bulgaria". As a result of the publicity,
I received an avalanche of letters, not
only from many places in Britain but
also from the U.S.A., Zambia, Australia
and New Zealand. All these letters,
together with those sent directly to the
Da/7y Record are now carefully pre¬
served in Gabrovo.
As I have said, a number of Scottish
anecdotes are virtually identical to
those found in Gabrovo. I have often
been asked who thought up these stor¬
ies, and whether one country could
have picked them up from the other.
In my opinion, there may well have
been some borrowing, but it is very
difficult to prove, and in any case the
question is not that important.
It is well known, in Bulgaria at least,
that Scottish bagpipes are of Bulgarian*^
origin, although this does not prevent
the Scots from claiming them as their
own invention and as their special
contribution to the world's musical cul¬
ture.
Some witty Gabrovo jokes may well'
have followed the bagpipes to Scotland
where they speedily took root in the
northern Scottish soil and flourished.
In the same way, no doubt, a number
of Scottish jokes took out Bulgarian
citizenship and settled down cheerfully
in the town of Gabrovo. These obvious
similarities are curious enough but the
most striking thing of all is the basic
resemblance of the sense of humour
in both places.
, In Bulgaria, Gabrovo has the same
reputation that Aberdeen enjoys in
Scotland. The inhabitants of both
towns are considered to be misers,
penny-pinching, deeply cunning and
always on the lookout for ways of
making easy money. The facts, as
often, are different from the fiction.
The inhabitants of Gabrovo are hard
working, honest, hospitable and gen¬
erous. And from my own experience
of the Scots, I can say the same thing
about the Aberdonians.
The town of Gabrovo lies on wooded
slopes of the foothills of the Balkan
range not far from the ancient capital
of Bulgaria, Veliko-Tirnivo, and ex¬
tends along both banks of the Yantra
river. Mountain towns generally are
short of arable land, and the people
who settled the area in the 16th cen¬
tury had to find other ways of existing
than farming; so they turned to crafts¬
manship.
There was no electricity then, but the
fast flow of the river was there to
work for them, harnessed by their
own ingenuity. They produced excel¬
lent quality goods, and then set out
to sell them, becoming tradesmen in
the process. But salesmanship is not
easy. It demands special qualities. The
people of Gabrovo had to fight off
competition, pull in the customers, flat¬
ter them and convince them that buying
Gabrovo goods was the hallmark of a
customer with an eye for a bargain.
With this in mind, the tradesmen
of Gabrovo exaggerated some of their
own defects, and passed themselves
off as simpletons. They constantly
polished this particular tactic and laugh¬
ed at themselves as hard as they
could, provided it was good for busi
ness. They made up jokes and anec¬
dotes about their own shortcomings
but never about the goods they
were selling. That is a fundamental
rule of Gabrovo humour.
As the years went by, the small
craftsmen were joined by larger enter¬
prises. The first factories went up.
The town was slowly changing. But
Gabrovo was only really transformed
after the Second World War. The old
workshops and small factories were
replaced by modern industrial plants
from which goods are today exported
to dozens of countries.
The people's lives too have chan¬
ged. Gabrovo is now a pleasant and
steadily growing town. It has wide
streets, parks, monuments, elegant
buildings and attractive suburbs.
Nothing is left of its former poverty,
hovels and narrow dusty streets. All
that is a thing of the past. Only the
Gabrovo flair for business, its inge¬
nuity and enterprise and its sense of
humour constantly replenished by
streams of new jokes carry on un¬
changed.
One striking example of this enter¬
prising spirit is the well-known
museum-village of Etara just outside
the town. The village recreates for
visitors the atmosphere and way of life
of 150 years ago. (See "Unesco Cou¬
rier" October 1975). Its narrow paved
streets are lined with fine examples
of the old architecture of Gabrovo, and
with small workshops where master
craftsmen and their apprentices prac¬
tise traditional skills using the old ma¬
chinery powered by the flow of the
river. The number of foreign tourists
visiting Etara is growing annually.
And, of course, Gabrovo remains a
town bubbling with humour. The peo¬
ple seem to be born with a sense of
fun which they keep for the rest of
their lives. In the centre of the town,
on a rock in the middle of the river,
is a statue of the town's founder,
Ratcho the Blacksmith. Another exam¬
ple of the citizens' parsimonious out- .
look: why not use the useless rock
as a pedestal and save the good
land on the riverbanks?

said, cut their cats' tails, so that the
animals take less time to pass through
a doorway, thus saving heat in winter.
Each May, Gabrovo organizes a
great festival of humour and satire.
It starts off with a symbolic gesture:
the tail of an enormous dummy black
cat is cut off. Then comes the carni¬
val procession, with floats presenting
scenes from satirical shows, and illus¬
trating old jokes, with participants
dressed in fantastic costumes and
wearing masks, singing and dancing.
Nowadays a special place is reser¬
ved at the festival for Scottish humour,
and the links created between Gabro¬
vo and Aberdeen. The people of Ga¬
brovo, dressed in Scottish costume,
carry posters written in English and
act out Scottish sketches.
All this is treated as excellent fun
by participants and audience alike with
spectators packed on the pavements,
massed at the windows or even look¬
ing down from vantage points on the
roofs in order not to miss anything.
But the Gabrovo festival is not just
a carnival. During a whole week,
theatres and cinemas present all-com¬
edy programmes. At the same time,
conferences discuss the nature of hu¬
mour and satire. Exhibitions on hu¬
mour are staged, and the festival ends
with games and comic contests in the
town stadium.
In. May 1973 the first International
Biennial of Cartoons was launched
during the Gabrovo festival, under the
title "Gabrovo 73". Its display of over
1 ,300 works by 348 artists and car¬
toonists from 22 countries, gave a pro¬
mising start to this international cul¬
tural event. The second Biennial, held
during the 1975 festival, was even more
successful.
The Biennial of Cartoons was the
first important event organized by
Gabrovo's "House of Humour and
Satire". Now completed, this centre
has its own film projection room, a
theatre for staging satirical works, and
conference and exhibition halls. The
idea of setting it up was welcomed
internationally and received warm
support from well-known humorists
such as Charlie Chaplin, Jean Effel,
Herluf Bidstrup, Eric Lipinsky, among
many others.
The House of Humour gets a steady
flow of enthusiastic letters from all
over thé World and has received more
than 10,000 contributions for its collec¬
tion. Through its wide-ranging pro¬
gramme, this remarkable cultural cen¬
tre will contribute to the development
of humour, and will promote contacts
and exchanges between creative ar¬
tists in this field.
The humour of Gabrovo is thus part
of Bulgaria's national heritage and one
that is not kept in museums or guard¬
ed in safes. It lives in the hearts
of those who enjoy it and who are
proud to preserve and enrich the.

humour" f
