Half the world’s population uses a total of eight
languages in daily life, while one sixth of the world’s
languages are spoken in New Guinea alone 
T he linguistic heritage is very unevenly distri-
buted. According to estimates made by the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), w h i c h
campaigns for preservation of the least-know n
t o n g u e s , only three per cent of the wo r l d ’s 6,000 lan-
guages are used in Europe, whereas half of them are
spoken in the A s i a - Pa c i fic regi o n , with the top pri z e
going to New Guinea (the Indonesian territory of
I rian Jaya plus Papua New Guinea), which is home
to one sixth of the world’s languages.
Linguistic dive rsity does not match populat i o n
d e n s i t y : 96 per cent of languages are spoken by
only four per cent of the wo r l d ’s population and ove r
80 per cent are endemic, i . e . confined to one
country. Only about 20 languages are spoken by
hundreds of millions of people in several countri e s.
Although the figures va ry according to the
method of counting, the Millennium Family Ency-
c l o p a e d i a (Dorling Kinders l e y, L o n d o n ,1 9 9 7 ) ,e s t i-
mates that around half the people in the world use
in eve ry d ay life one of the planet’s eight most wides-
pread languages: Chinese (1.2 billion speakers ) ,
English (478 million), Hindi (437 million), S p a n i s h
(392 million),Russian (284 million), Arabic (225
m i l l i o n ) , Po rtuguese (184 million) and French (125
million). SIL and Linguasphere Observatory (see
page 31) provide comparable figures,by adding to
those who speak a language as a mother tongue
those for whom it is a “second language”. (see p. 2 1 ) .
Ten languages 
die out every year
This imbalance leads specialists to forecast that
95 per cent of all living languages will die out duri n g
the next century. At present,10 languages disappear
e ve ry year somewhere in the wo r l d . Some go so fa r
as to claim a language dies out eve ry two we e k s.T h e
r ate of disappearance is especially high in areas
where linguistic diversity is greatest.
In Africa,more than 200 languages have fewer
than 500 speakers each and may soon die out.The
minimum number of speakers to ensure surv i val is
put at 100,000.
In North A m e ri c a , the biggest threats are to
indigenous and Creole languages.With the excep-
tions of Navajo, Cree and Ojibwa, the 200 Ame-
rindian tongues which have surv i ved until now in the
United States and Canada are endangered.
B e t ween a third and a half of Latin A m e ri c a ’s
500 A m e rindian languages are in danger, with the
highest rate of extinction predicted in Brazil,
where most languages are spoken by ve ry small
c o m m u n i t i e s.
The languages of Southeast Asia are each spoken
by relat i vely large numbers of people, and the future
of about 40 of the 600 to 700 languages there will
depend largely on government policies.
On the other hand, only six languages out of
n o rth-east A s i a ’s 47 have any real chance of surv i va l
in the face of Russian.Twenty are “nearly extinct”,
eight are “ s e riously endangered”and 13 are “ e n d a n-
g e r e d ” .The first group are spoken by only a dozen
people at most.The second group are more widely
used but are not being passed down to children.T h e
third cat e g o ry includes tongues spoken by some chil-
dren but fewer and fewer, according to the forth-
coming UN E S C O Red Book on Endangered Lan-
guages:Europe and North-east Asia.
In Europe, where the number of languages
varies by a factor of two according to the criteria
used to define them, 123 languages are spoken,
including nine which are nearly extinct, 26 seri o u s l y
endangered and 38 endangered, according to the
UNESCO book. ■
