LL living species whales
and cockroaches, roses and
the AIDS virus, pandas and
people make up the bio¬
logical diversity of the
Earth. All biological entities
and systems are intercon-
-nected and interdepen¬
dent, from a DNA molecule to an
ecosystem to the biosphere. Bio¬
diversity is important because it
provides basic services: it protects
and maintains soils, regulates the
climate and ensures photosynthe¬
sis, thus furnishing the oxygen we
breathe. It provides the basic mate¬
rial for our food, clothing, medi¬
cines and housing.
It is time to think about the conse¬
quences of the current changes in
biodiversity. Although there have
always been extinctions (such as
the disappearance of dinosaurs),
never have there been so many
losses of species and alteration of
natural areas as today. In order to
feed, lodge and transport the
world's millions, ecosystems are
being cut up, fragmented and com¬
pletely modified. Additions of ferti¬
lizers, domestic and industrial
wastes, or simply salty water are
degrading and poisoning natural
systems with a resulting die-off of
the animals, plants and fishes that
depend on them.
The resulting destruction affects
not only the area directly concern¬
ed: wind and river and sea currents
can transmit pollutants far from the
source ofcontamination. Thus pen¬
guins in the Antarctic have DDT
residues in their tissues. There are
cases of malaria in people living
near airports far away from infected
countries.
Intensive agriculture has brought
about a deliberate loss of biodiver¬
sity, which is a mixed blessing.
Farmers traditionally used many
varieties ofcrops and domesticated
animals to accommodate the local
differences in soil and climate.
Today, of 145 local sorts ofbeast in
the Mediterranean basin, all but
thirty are in serious danger of
extinction. In order to achieve maxi¬
mum yields, farmers are using only
a limited number of varieties of
cattle and crops, the latter very often
needing heavy inputs of fertilizers
and pesticides.
Our dwindling
biological capital
Only now are we beginning to
assess the threat that the loss ofbio¬
diversity can have on environmen¬
tal development. But such an assess¬
ment is difficult because we know
very little about biodiversity. While
some 1.4 million species have been
identified and described by scien¬
tists, there is a great deal of dis¬
agreement on the total number of
species on Earth. Estimates vary
from 5 to some 80 million, taking
account ofall the insects, microbes
and marine life-forms to be dis¬
covered. With so few data, the losses
in terms ofgenes, species and ecosys¬
tems are not easy to calculate. Some
biologists have hazarded a guess that
perhaps one-quarter of the world's
total biodiversity is at serious risk of
extinction over the next twenty to
thirty years. This figure may be
contested, but it does call attention to
the urgency of the matter.
Scientists are only now question¬
ing why there is so much biodiver¬
sity and how it is generated and lost.
They are also asking whether bio¬
diversity has a role in the function¬
ing of ecosystems. It has been
shown that there is some redun¬
dancy in ecosystems, for example,
different species performing the
same ecological tasks such as eating
the same fruits and occupying the
same space. This implies that we
may be able to do without some
species. But which ones? And is this
morally acceptable to society?
In the face of so many unknowns,
different countries have different
ideas and priorities. In order to
conserve a maximum of biodiver¬
sity, efforts need to be made to pro¬
tect natural areas as reserves, to set
up repositories in zoos, botanical
gardens and gene banks. Care
should be given to preserve biodi¬
versity in all types of natural sys¬
tems, from deserts and grasslands
to estuaries and coral reefs. However,
the most effective and difficult
measure of all is to use natural
resources sustainably, at least above
the threshold at which the processes
of evolution, of speciation and
adaptation can continue.

ThirdWorld countries, usually rich
in biodiversity, will and must exploit
their natural resources for their de¬
velopment. The industrialized coun¬
tries feel that more should be done to
protect biodiversity and save the last
wild natural areas of the planet.
Some countries thus decided to
negotiate an international conven¬
tion on biodiversity.
Unesco has an important role to
play in this effort. First, as the Uni¬
ted Nations scientific organization,
it will promote research and inven¬
tories to improve our understand¬
ing of the world's flora and fauna
and the role of biodiversity in the
functioning of ecosystems.
The 'Diversitas' project
Together with the non-govern¬
mental scientific community,
through the International Union of
Biological Sciences (IUBS) and the
Scientific Committee on Problems
ofthe Environment (SCOPE), a new
initiative called "Diversitas" has
been launched to mobilize a major
global co-ordinated effort in this
field. Unesco will also tackle the
educational aspects, sensitizing the
public and policy-makers to the
implications of losses of biodiver¬
sity, based on the results of Diver¬
sitas. Training activities, for example
ofmuch-needed taxonomists (spe¬
cialists in the classification ofplants
and animals) in developing coun¬
tries, will also be conducted.
One of Unesco's unique contri¬
butions is the international bio¬
sphere reserve networkunderwhich
representative ecosystems are pro¬
tected in 300 sites in 75 countries
around the world. The biosphere
reserve system makes it possible to
find solutions to land management
problems and to share the informa¬
tion through a co-operative net¬
work. They are field laboratories for
finding out more about biodiversi¬
ty and how it can be both protec¬
ted and sustainably used for the
benefit ofhumankind in all parts of
the world.
