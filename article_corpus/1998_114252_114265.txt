Tight marg i n s
in Sri Lanka
An expanding data processing sector
at the beck and call of middlemen
■
“Ten years ago only a few companies in Sri
Lanka dared to venture into the IT and data
processing industry. But today we are in the
midst of unprecedented gr owth in this fie l d ,” c l a i m s
Suresh Dominic, M a n a ging Director of John Keels
Computer Services (JKCS), a company based in
C o l o m b o, S ri Lanka’s capital. Established in 1987
with a capital of over $85,000, JKCS expects a tur-
n over of $3.7 million this ye a r. In the last ten ye a rs
it has captured substantial data processing and
s o f t ware business—mainly checking, va l i d ation and
management of data from multinational companies
like P & O Nedloy d , DHL and Mentor Computers.
By sending their data processing work to coun-
t ries like Sri Lanka, these multinationals are sav i n g
about 70-75 per cent of their costs. M e a n w h i l e ,S ri
Lankan professionals also regard themselves as
b e n e fic i a ri e s. In a country where a civil war is going
on and foreign businesses are not exactly fa l l i n g
over themselves to inve s t ,a ny business opport u n i t y
is welcome.
Competition from India
and the Philippines
“There is no bargaining powe r ,” s ays Soma-
sundaram Dharm ava s a n , M a n a ging Director of
Kingslake Engi n e e ring Systems Pri vate Ltd, w h i c h
c at e rs to over 300 Sri Lankan businesses and twe n t y
multinational companies. His firm does not get its
o r d e rs directly from multinat i o n a l s , but via agencies
based in the West which earn high profits from
acting as interm e d i a ri e s. London-based Techno for
Shortage of trained professionals is a major handicap.

example, receives orders from companies like Bri-
tish Gas, Shell and British Petroleum and then
sends them overseas on a sub-contract basis. “We
h ave always been dependent on interm e d i a ri e s ,”
s ays Dharm ava s a n . “But now our aim is to esta-
blish direct links with our clients so that we can
increase profits.The market is extremely competi-
t i ve , and if we quote higher rates our orders will
automatically go to India or the Philippines.”
Low overheads and 
import duty exemptions
At present, there are sixty small and medium-
sized data processing and software companies in
S ri Lanka.They had a turn over of around $25 mil-
lion in 1998. E x p e rts point out that they are no lon-
ger hindered by problems of transmitting their wo r k
(via Internet) since the state has invested in moder-
n i z ation of the country ’s telecommunication sys-
t e m s.They also benefit from low ove r h e a d s ,e xe m p-
tion from customs duty on computer and software
i m p o rt s , and above all from the availability of cheap
labour. Data processing professionals earn an ave-
rage of $600 a month (compared to $3,500 in deve-
loped countries). But the industry would be gro-
wing faster were it not for the relative shortage of
skilled IT professionals.
This shortage of human resources is the coun-
try’s major handicap in relation to India. “In this
respect our neighbour is ten ye a rs ahead of us,”
D h a n a n j ava Chandrasekera, J K C S ’s software direc-
tor, points out. “At present we have 95 professio-
nals,” Dominic adds. “We badly need another fifty
e m p l oyees right away, but unfort u n ately it is not
easy to get computer graduates in Sri Lanka.” Sri
Lanka produces about 200 computer graduates a
year whereas the gr owing industry needs at least
1,000 professionals, and so companies are now tur-
ning to well-trained diploma holders from private
institutions.To get hold of competent staff, JKCS
has made an agreement with the National Institute
of Inform ation Technology (NIIT), a noted Indian
computer training centre which recently opened
branches in Colombo and Kandy, in the south of
Sri Lanka.
“The computer business is the only field in
which a young Sri Lankan professional can start
out earning $600 a month and double or even tri p l e
his earning power within a matter of months,”
Dominic explains. “More and more Sri Lankans
are turning to computers and this augurs well for
the future.” ■
