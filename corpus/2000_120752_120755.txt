In the weeks after the accident, coniferous trees and mammals that ate
ground vegetation received the highest doses of radiation.Trees died and
were buried by the liquidators. Cows grazing heavily contaminated grass
near the reactor died. So too did most of the mice in the exclusion zone.
Most intriguingly for scientists, the survivors were almost all female. O n l y
after four generations did male numbers begin to recover.
Mona Dreicer, a U. S. researcher who collated material for a major inter-
national conference held on the Chernobyl aftermath in 1996 (Vi e n n a ) ,
says that levels of radioactivity in surface soils had fallen by a factor of
a hundred by the autumn of 1986, and “by 1989 the natural environment
had begun to recover.” B a d l y
damaged conifers were making
cones again and the rodent
population was growing fast.
To d a y, the roll call of wildlife
includes wild boar, e l k , d e e r,
foxes and some 200 wolves.The
list of animals failing to return is
relatively short: pigeons and rats,
which rely on human leftovers to
flo u r i s h , as well as swa l l o w s,
which have apparently fallen
prey to genetic disorders.
But the region remains heavily
contaminated,particularly soils,
v e g e t a t i o n , the tree wood and
leaf litter on the forest floors that
cover roughly a third of the
exclusion zone.The zone has become, in effect,the world’s first radioac-
tive nature reserve. It is a fantastic laboratory to analyze the impact of
radioactive fall-out.Yet says the head of the reserve, Nikolai Voronetsky,
most researchers have avoided travelling there, fearing for their own per-
sonal safety. It is not surprising, p e r h a p s. Three out of a team of ten bota-
nists who visited in 1986 are now dead,he says.
Vo r o n e t s k y ’s own researchers have shown that the internal organs of the
wolves and most other creatures remain radioactive.The wolves are particu-
larly worrisome as they stray outside of the reserve, hunting for sheep and
h o r s e s.The boar tallied the highest geiger-counter readings,says Vo r o n t e s k y,
because they dig into contaminated soil in search of food.
Rosa Goncharova of the Institute of Genetics and Cytology in Minsk says
that she has observed increased “genetic anomalies” in rodents and fis h
in the contaminated zone. Dreicer downplays such reports.“ The frequency
of these reported defects was shown to be similar in highly contaminated
and non-contaminated regions. . . Leading to the conclusion that they
were not due to increased radiation dose,” she says. But critics see this
as UN “ s p i n .” For one thing, you would not expect a close correlation bet-
ween defects and crude fall-out levels because, as Dreicer herself has
pointed out,the vagaries of local soils can lead to grazing animals recei-
ving high doses even in areas that had low fall-out.
There are many ways that radioactivity can “leak into the wider environ-
m e n t .” Earlier this year there were fears that fires raging across peat
bogs in the contaminated zones could unleash radioactive clouds of
smoke.The U.S. embassy sent a team to check for fall-out,but reportedly
none was found. Wa t e r, h o w e v e r, has proven to be a serious conduit for
c o n t a m i n a t i o n .
During spring flo o d i n g ,c o n c e n-
trations of radioactive materials
in local rivers increases by up to
four times. In fact, the contami-
nated zone had been flo o d e d
six times since the accident,
each time washing radioactive
material down river, e s p e c i a l l y
along the banks of the Pripyat,
which drains into the Dneiper
and ultimately the Black Sea.
With nine million Ukrainians
drinking water from reservoirs
on the Dneiper and many more
eating food irrigated by the river
wa t e r s, a European Commission
report has concluded that radio-
active water is the most important environmental threat still posed by the
a c c i d e n t .
Fourteen years after the disaster,radioactive materials are remaining mobile
within soils and ecosystems much more than scientists had expected. J i m
Smith of the British government’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology repor-
ted in May this year that “the environment is not cleaning itself of the pol-
lution at the rate we previously thought.” In places, he said caesium wa s
being “re-released into the ecosystem” as the Chernobyl legacy begins a
new cycle. ■
