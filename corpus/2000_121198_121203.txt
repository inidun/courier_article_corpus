The process of globalization is moving
ahead so fast that it has reached hereto-
fore public sector areas, such as education.
Tr u e, the relationship between schools
and the private sector goes back a long
way. Learning institutions have adapted
some of the private sector’s operating
m e t h o d s, and the public service has dele-
gated teaching missions to private com-
p a n i e s, but a further step has been taken.
The explosion of new technologies,w h i c h
speeds up the production and spread of
“educational goods” and the globalization
of markets, spurs on their commerciali-
zation worldwide and eventually, i r r e s i s-
tibly attracts entrepreneurs, always on
the lookout for new markets.Today edu-
cation is a sector weighing two trillion
dollars and companies are continually
expanding their choice of “ e d u c a t i o n a l
m e r c h a n d i s e.”At the same time, the real
or supposed shortcomings of public edu-
cation are turning parents and students
away from it,and fuelling their growing
demand for quality services, which they
are ready to seek elsewhere.
Everyone who believes that educa-
tion is a basic right thinks that commer-
cialization carries acute risks.They argue
that education must not only train wor-
k e r s, but also citizens and responsible
i n d i v i d u a l s. Therefore they question not
only the effects liberalization will have,
which would lead to discrimination against
the most disadvantaged countries, g r o u p s
and individuals,but also the impact a com-
mercial approach will have on the spread
of “common values” or respect for the
indispensable diversity of learning content
and methods,which take into account the
l a n g u a g e, culture and teaching traditions
of the people for whom they are intended.
Proponents of liberalization criticize
the public school system’s ability to offer
equal access to education for all. Th e y
stress that it’s time to increase and  diver-
sify offer in order to meet demand that the
traditional systems can no longer meet, a l l
the less so because of budget cuts. Th e y
emphasize the necessity to introduce ideas
of productivity and responsibility, the lack
of which, they argue, is the public sector’s
main shortcoming.
It is the opinion of UN E S C O,and of its
member states, that neither a wholly
public nor an entirely commercial edu-
cation system can overcome the educa-
tion crisis, which is tangible. The organi-
zation is convinced that public and private
education sectors each have something
valuable to contribute, and that by com-
bining their efforts and forging partner-
s h i p s, they can boost the educational sys-
t e m ’s overall effectiveness—under one
c o n d i t i o n :primary responsibility for tea-
ching must remain in the hands of public
a u t h o r i t i e s, because they alone are the
guardians of the common interest.A b o v e
all, education must be a means to train
responsible citizens. It goes without saying
that the deregulation of educational ins-
titutions cannot be accompanied by the
decline of the basic rules which underpin
the educational mission, and by a lack of
serious monitoring to ensure that those
rules are observed.
This is just as valid on a worldwide
s c a l e.The commercialization of education
requires regional or international co-ope-
r a t i o n ,especially to ensure that the acqui-
sition of universal values remains the pri-
mary objective of any educational system.
The World Trade Organization has started
taking an interest in this issue. But we
would be  straying from our mission by
envisaging the impact of globalization only
from a business perspective, and there-
fore ignoring its effects on—and potential
for—human freedom and self-fulfil l m e n t
through education, science and culture. ■
