Videomania in
G e o rge Orwell’s homeland
Satirist Mark Thomas uses the law to sidestep the UK’s ubiquitous
surveillance cameras
B
rits may appear to be paragons of discretion
but actually we’re a nation of voyeurs and
e x h i b i t i o n i s t s. For the past 25 years, t h e
government and citizens have been instal-
ling closed circuit television cameras
(CCTV) in the most banal places: train stations,b u s e s,
a i r p o r t s, town centres and even telephone booths.We
have hidden cameras in the changing rooms of shops
and parade before men in uniform with cameras tucked
inside their police helmets.
George Orwell’s homeland has the most sur-
veillance cameras per capita in the world: one for
every 55 people, according to a recent study by the
University of Hull. In 1995 almost 80 percent of the
Home Offic e ’s crime prevention budget went into
funding new cameras. And the private sector now
accounts for about 30 percent of the market, w o r t h
£150 million ($210 million) a year according to conser-
vative estimates, and growing 15 to 20 percent annually.
In the words of former Home Secretary Michael
H o w a r d ,“CCTV catches criminals, spots crimes, i d e n-
t i fies lawbreakers and helps convict the guilty,” y e t
there has never been an official Home Office assess-
ment of the cameras’ impact on crime rates. O n l y
weeks ago, it emerged that the Scottish Parliament has
no information on the number of convictions resulting
from evidence gathered by CCTV. And yet, Ja m e s
D i t t o n , a professor at the Scottish Centre for Crimi-
n o l o g y, reported in 1999 that the 32 cameras in
Glasgow city centre had produced just one arrest
every 40 days.
Indeed the exponential growth of CCTV has been
accompanied by rising crime rates and falling numbers
of police on the streets. Crime rates doubled between
1980 and 1990 and reached an all-time high last year
at 5.22 million, with violent crimes rising eight percent
n a t i o n a l l y. On any one night in London, a city of
seven million people, only 300 police officers are
actually on patrol, according to the Police Fe d e r a-
t i o n .
Sketches, lies
& videotape
So let’s scratch the crime prevention argument
and return to the original hypothesis:an obsession with
surveillance for social control—which seems only fit-
ting given that the British don’t have a legally ensh-
rined right to privacy. But we do have data protection
l e g i s l a t i o n , first introduced in 1984 and reinforced in
March 2000, which gives citizens the right to see and
correct personal information kept by anyone—govern-
m e n t , company or fellow citizen.
I work with Mark Th o m a s, who spends a lot of
time in front of and behind cameras for the TV pro-
g r a m m e,“ The Mark Thomas Product.”So in the spirit
of public service,we have sought to uphold the new law.
According to the guidelines, CCTV operators must
register their activities with the government, which is
good news because just about anyone can install a

camera anywhere. Quite logically, we made our fir s t
stop at a security industry exhibition.Of about 200 exhi-
b i t o r s,we discovered that 127 had failed to register and
were therefore breaking the law.We invited them to the
e x h i b i t i o n ’s cyber café to register online.Most declined
and we were soon ejected from the conference but not
before the organizers had drafted a letter to all exhi-
b i t o r s, notifying them of their legal obligations.
We then stumbled upon an interesting phrase in
the act: “the same legally enforceable information-
handling standards as have previously applied to those
processing personal data on computer now cover
C C T V.”Tr a n s l a t i o n :any identifiable individual fil m e d
by a camera now has the right to obtain a copy of those
i m a g e s.This is a satirist’s dream. If we are to be fil m e d
half our lives, then we want the footage for a 40-year
long out-of-home video.Perhaps this is the real reason
for the new law: why else would it stipulate that ope-
rators put their contact information on each camera? 
This took us to our next stop, B r i t a i n ’s privatized
and chaotic railways. We figured that a lot of people
were getting into trouble for being late to work.So we
found several harassed commuters eager to act as
guinea pigs by standing under their local station’s
cameras holding a half-metre high clock. All it took
was a quick letter of request and each commuter
received a personal video, courtesy of Railtrack, t o
prove to their bosses that they weren’t the culprits—
the company was.
The real surprise came while testing the latest
CCTV hi-tech wizardry. Newham Council in London
has spent £2 million ($2.8 million) on computerized
cameras to automatically recognize certain vehicle
number plates and identify known villains with facial
mapping software. We sent six traditional English
folk dancers, donning garters and bells, to do the
“ r a t t l e b o n e ” and “ p l o u g h j a c k ” through the streets of
the housing estate.Shortly after our visit, we received
a letter explaining that the council couldn’t release our
footage since “it has not been possible for us to extra-
polate your images from those of unknown third par-
t i e s.”
Announcing the world’s first
international CCTV competition
We had a major dilemma: had taxpayers’ money
been used for faulty equipment, or was something
else going on? We happened to be outside a Fo r d
Motor Company plant when a few union people dis-
tributing leaflets about a forthcoming strike ballot
were suddenly threatened by employees. Ford com-
plied with our request for the CCTV footage of the
i n c i d e n t . But aside from a riveting view of the nearby
car park, there was no sign of life. Another round of
technical problems? 
All of which leads us to the following conclusion:
C C T V ’s potential lies in the entertainment fie l d .As a
r e s u l t ,w e ’ve launched a competition for the best foo-
tage obtained through data protection laws. N o n e
other than Jonathan Ross, the BBC’s film critic, w i l l
judge the results. And perhaps most importantly, I
hereby formally announce the creation of the new
c a t e g o r y, “Best International Picture.” Any CCTV
footage will qualify, edited or uncut, from countries
with or without appropriate legislation. Please send
your tapes marked “CCTV Competition” to Ve r a
