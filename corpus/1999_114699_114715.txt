‘ When are
we l e a v i n g ?’
■
JB is an elderly retired professional man who
l i ves quietly in an English provincial city. E a r l y
in 1997 his 77-year-old wife was diagnosed as
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an age-related
d e g e n e r at i ve brain disorder which affects memory,
thinking, behaviour and emotion.
The first sign that something was seri o u s l y
amiss had come two ye a rs before, when IM had
gone to London to visit friends. She had failed to
a rri ve and returned home, h aving completely
forgotten where she was going.Before that,during
a question-and-answer session at an academic
g at h e ri n g, she had been uncharacteristically lost
for words.The couple saw their doctor who asked
IM who the Prime Minister was. She said she had
no idea but that surely it didn’t mat t e r. T h e r e
f o l l owed a series of brain scans and exhaustive
m e m o ry and language tests, as a result of which
she was diagnosed as being in the early stages of
Alzheimer’s.
Inexorable
mental decline
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form
of dementia, a malady that afflicts one in 20 people
over the age of 65. It affects all groups in society
irrespective of social class,gender,ethnic group or
g e o graphical locat i o n . According to curr e n t
e s t i m at e s , by the year 2000 there will be roughly
18 million people with dementia in the wo r l d ,a b o u t
two-thirds of them Alzheimer victims.
Tr e atment is in its infa n cy and as yet nothing
seems to slow the sufferer’s inexorable mental decline.
The disorder’s first stage may seem relat i vely benign.
After all, most people as they age lose mental
s h a rp n e s s , misplace things, forget people’s names
and suffer other minor mental lapses.From then on,
h owe ve r ,i t ’s downhill all the way.“ A l z h e i m e r ’s is like
an insidious fog,” JB say s , “barely noticeable until
e ve rything around has disappeared.After that it is no
longer possible to believe that a world outside the
fog exists.”
As the disease progr e s s e s , the patient becomes
dependent on others for help with all aspects of daily
l i f e .This care is usually provided by the immediat e
family and the period of dependency can last for
m a ny ye a rs. “Alzheimer sufferers are not alway s
g e n t l e ,” JB notes, and caring for a loved one with
A l z h e i m e r ’s disease has been described as calling for

A few months ago JB published a beautifully wri t t e n
short memoir of his wife,describing their lives together
“Then”(before the onset of Alzheimer’s) and “Now”, a
s e ries of vignettes of IM’s tragic descent into mental
n u l l i t y. S e rialized in the press, it struck a powerful chord
among many who are not only facing a more prolonged
old age than that of their forebears but may be coping
with the decline of someone to whom they are close.
IM’s case is particularly heart-rending in view of what
she had done before she began,as she put it,to sail into
the darkness. She is Iris Murdoch, one of the century’s
most gifted novelists writing in English and an author
with a devoted readership worldwide (her works have
been translated into 23 languages).Her husband,JB,is
John Bayley, a noted literary critic and former Oxford
professor.1
For over forty ye a rs Iris Murdoch had been engr o s s e d
in writing fiction and philosophy. In 27 novels published
b e t ween 1954 and 1995, she had created a vivid wo r l d
peopled by intelligent and intensely human figures whose
exceptional capacities for feeling and thinking were tested
in situations that were often macabre, comic and
m e l o d r a m at i c. She also wrote about philosophy, i n c l u d i n g
a critical study of Sartre (1953) and M e t a p hysics as a
Guide to Mora l s ( 1 9 9 2 ) . She had created and carri e d
the novels entirely in her head, planning them for
months before effortlessly writing them dow n .N ow
she no longer knows their titles.
A voyage 
into darkness
B ay l e y ’s memoir plunges the reader into the
world of sufferer and carer. To d ay Iris Murdoch
can no longer talk coherently or remember where
she is or has been.The day begins and ends with the
tussles of dressing (“most days a happy and comic
business”) and undressing. Around ten in the
morning it’s time for the Teletubbies,an animated
c a rtoon show on children’s television, which Iri s
watches “with something approaching glee.” S h e
is equally absorbed in sports progr a m m e s ,a l t h o u g h
she does not know the play or the scores.When she
t w i t t e rs away incomprehensibly Bayley fin d s
himself sustaining the illusion of a conversation by
uttering meaningless sentences of his own.When
they go out of doors she absently picks up stones
and twigs and brings them home. Her only
coherent phrase, which she repeats again and again,
i s : “When are we leav i n g ? ” She has a prodigi o u s
appetite for sleep. I t ’s some kind of consolation that
she does not seem aware of what she’s lost. “ I ’ m
grateful that there isn’t what you might call clear-
e yed despair going on. There is a kind of animal
t rust in the person she is with.” B ayley is quite
d e void of self-pity; his love for Murdoch shines
from every sentence. He gets through the days by
keeping bu s y. Jokes are import a n t , the sillier the
better to try to get a smile which “transforms her
face, bringing it back to what it was, and with an
added glow that can seem almost supernatural.”.
He tries to take the short view of things, n e ve r
looking beyond the next meal. Once he loses
control and explodes into anger as Iris goes on
meaninglessly watering the house plants.
“Like being chained to a corpse, isn’t it?” says
the wife of a fellow sufferer. He disagrees,refusing
to feel that Iris Murdoch’s individuality is absorbed
into “the common symptoms of a clinical
c o n d i t i o n ” . He accepts that eventually he will need
outside help, but “Like someone who knows he
cannot for much longer avoid going out into the
cold I still shrink from the need for professional
care . . . e ven the efforts of kind fri e n d s.All that is to
come, but let us postpone it while we can.”
Meanwhile the disease has oddly intensifie d
their togethern e s s. For ye a rs they had each been
engrossed in their own work, in a kind of conjugal
solitude.“Now we are together for the first time. .
. . E ve ry day we are physically closer; and Iri s ’s little
‘mouse cry’,as I think of it,signifying loneliness in
the next room, the wish to be back beside me, s e e m s
less and less forlorn , more simple, more nat u r a l .
She is not sailing into the dark: the voyage is over,
and under the dark escort of Alzheimer’s she has
arrived somewhere.So have I.” ■
