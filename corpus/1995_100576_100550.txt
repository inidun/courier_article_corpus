Milos Forman
interview
> Tell us about your first
contact with the cinema.
It was unforgettable. One Saturday
night, when I was four or five years
old, my parents took me to see a film
in Caslav, the city where I was born in
the country that was then called
Czechoslovakia. I found out later that
it was a documentary about Smetana's
opera The Bartered Bride. Oddly
enough, it was a silent film. On the
screen gigantic people opened enor¬
mous mouths from which no sound
emerged. But the audience knew the
opera by heart and began to sing
louder and louder. The women were
in tears. It was an extraordinary intro¬
duction to the cinema!
Some time later I saw Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs, which I
thought was wonderful. I thought
that I had seen the most beautiful
thing in the world, and I fell in love
with Snow White. In a store I had
bought coloured cakes of soap
shaped like the seven dwarfs, and
each day I used a different one. When
I saw the film, I stopped using these
pieces of soap so that they would last
longer.
How did you get started in
theatre, in directing?
During the war my brother Pavel,
who was being hunted by the
Gestapo, joined a troupe that staged
operettas. He designed the stage sets.
It was thanks to him that I saw my first
play, which struck a deep emotional
chord. He also took me backstage.
That was extremely disconcerting: the
young women undressing before my
eyes, the jokes, the music, the smell of
starch and mothballs and sweat. It
was a revelation to me and I decided
there and then that the theatre, this
other world, would be my life.
Looking around me, I gradually
discovered that there is often a differ¬
ence between what people think and

what they do. I learned to decipher
their feelings when they often
couldn't do so themselves. It's the
same with fictional characters. There's
always a mask that needs to be
removed, and essentially this is what a
stage or film director does.
I When you went backstage,
did you already know that
you wanted to become a
stage director?
No, I had no idea at that time. I
vaguely thought that maybe I would
become an actor or even a playwright.
I was very young. I remember very
clearly, towards the end of the war,
when the German authorities decided
to close all the theatres and movie
houses in Bohemia. Everybody was in
tears, on stage and in the audience.
The conductor silenced the orchestra.
I thought that the world which 1 had
just entered was disappearing forever.
I Later on you went to film
school?
Yes, in Prague. I studied screen¬
play writing and film technique. Milan
Kundera was one of my teachers. He
was already known as a poet. He was
not much older than we were, and the
female students adored him. He made
me read Les Liaisons Dangereuses,
which I made into a film many years
later. I wrote hundreds of pages,
analysing films and screenplays. And,
of course, we saw films.
I Which ones?
We saw all the films we could.
Today, when I try to remember which
ones had the biggest effect on me
back then during those decisive, for¬
mative years when choices are
madeI would put Charlie Chaplin
first. I admired and loved his work
enormously. Next I would mention

Forman's 77ie Firemen's Ball

Italian neorealist films, the work of
Cesare Zavattini and Vittorio De Sica,
especially Miracle in Milan and The
Bicycle Thief. I liked their blend of fun
and feeling. In a word, I liked their
humanity.
ft After film school, you
went into television. By
then, the communist
regime was firmly
established in
Czechoslovakia. Were you
a victim of censorship?
During the whole of the first part of
my life, in the theatre, in films, or in
television where, by the way, I pre¬
sented films everything I did meant
waging, as resourcefully as possible,
an endless struggle against censor¬
ship, which was ubiquitous. The
need to struggle, to be cunning day
in day out, made me realize very early
on that film plays a social role, that it is
a certain way of looking at the world,
and that it can even help to change
the world, even if only to a slight
extent.
Every actor who appeared on tele¬
vision first had to fill in a form in which
he wrote out his lines, which were
then submitted to the censor "up
there", as we used to say. One day, I
wanted to present two jugglers on a
variety show. I was asked to report to
the censor what they were going to
say. Of course they weren't going to
say anything. I tried to explain this but
it was no good. So I advised the jug¬
glers to fill in their forms anyway,
which they did. They wrote down
something like: "Hey! Ho! Hop! Hop!
Yup! Ah!" The form came back with
the official stamp of approval. The dia¬
logue had been accepted "up there".
There is something else that I'll
never forget. Under communism, in
principle, all society's problems were
solved. Consequently, any conflict
between good and evil in a contem¬
porary context, at any rate became
impossible. How could drama even
exist in such a situation? You can't
imagine the endless discussions that
were held to solve this problem which
today seems ridiculous.
ft Was it ever solved?
Yes. The great minds of the Party
found a solution. Conflicts should be
between "the good and the best".
ft Even since your first film,
the documentary Talent
Competition, you have
stayed very close to
reality.
Yes. I have always been fascinated

Love (Czechoslovakia, 1965).
by what is called "reality". I wanted
and still do my films to seem real.
But when a camera is filming, it always
distorts the reality it seeks to record
and people stop acting naturally. This
is something that cannot be helped.
Ironically, it was my interest in reality
that led me to fiction. There, at least, I
can create my way another kind of
truth.
ft But you also want to tell a
story.
I've always wanted to tell stories.
Telling a story, I think, is a way of
approaching even, perhaps, under¬
standing life. And storytelling, with
all its surprises, is also a source of
pleasure.
ft In 1968, when Warsaw
Pact troops invaded
Prague, you decided to go
and work in the United
States. Unusually, you
made a fresh start in
another country and in
another language. You
have won two Academy
Awards, one for One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest
and another for Amadeus.
What is your secret?
There is no secret. Adapting to a
new life in the United States was a
matter of survival. I had no choice. I
took advantage of an opportunity that
the French film director Claude Berri
gave me, and made Taking Off In New
York in 1969. But that film was not
successful in the United States. Prob¬
ably it was too idiosyncratic. For a few
years I had a hard time and then sud¬
denly had a success with Cuckoo.
No, I don't have a secret. Other
film-makers who had come from
Europe, especially Central Europe,
people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder
and Fritz Lang, also made a new life
for themselves in the United States. Of
course I had to change the way I
worked and even the kind of stories I
tell. Until I could walk into a bar and
understand everything people were
saying, I couldn't hope to make
movies in America that were close to
reality, movies like Black Peter and A
Blonde in Love. I wasn't really at
home, even If I was now carrying an
American passport.
ft Did you return to
Czechoslovakia?
I went back as soon as I could, in
1979, and my first official reception
was held at the American embassy.
After that, I made Amadeus there.
Now I often go back. My two sons live
and work in Prague. Vaclav Havel,
President of the Czech Republic, is an
old friend.
ft But you have no plans to
make a Czech film?
Some day, perhaps. Why not? But
I would have to change the way I work
again and get used to my country '
which has changed considerably all
over again.
ft Do you feel at home in the
United States now?
I have always felt at home in places
where I could work in peace. I felt at
home wherever I had a roof over my
head and could put down my suit¬
case. In recent years it has been easier
for me to make films In the United
States than in Central Europe, and I
had a good roof over my head in Con¬
necticut. How could I possibly not feel
at home?
But maybe one day the forces that
took me far from the land of my child¬
hood will bring me back again. Who
knows?
ft Do you think the cinema
has a future?
As far as I am concerned, yes. Five
years after Valmont, I am almost cer¬
tainly going to make a new film. We're
supposed to start shooting at the
beginning of next year.
ft And the cinema in
general?
Yes. Films will go on being made.
There's no doubt about that. What
sort of films? That's the big question.
The answer is in the hands of the
people who will be making them.
