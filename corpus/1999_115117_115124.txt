Looting in the ethnic Chinese
district of Jakarta,Indonesia,
in May 1998.

Hadijah sits cross-legged on the floor inside her
t i ny, dimly-lit tin-roofed cabin in the Cilenggang
area in the southwe s t e rn belt of Ja k a rta and tri e s
to hide her embarrassment as she describes her
attempts to find work.
“They say I’m too old,” the 43-year-old widow
m u t t e rs ,r e f e rring to a South Korean fa c t o ry and a
German business centre not far from her house.
Managers at both companies have rejected her job
application.
Hadijah’s fruitless effort began in October last
year after she lost her job of 24 ye a rs as a tea lady at
a Jakarta car spare parts manufacturer, which was
badly hit by a sudden fall-off in demand in the
wake of the Asian financial crisis that began its
sweep across the region two years ago.
M e a n w h i l e , rampant inflation has meant
Hadijah spends far more money than before the
crisis to buy food and to keep her only daughter in
school. Prices of basic commodities such as rice,
sugar, cooking oil and kerosene have increased,in
local currency terms, three to five times what they
were before the crisis hit.
Against a backdrop of awesome economic
growth in the 1970s, 1980s and early this decade,
the common wisdom across Southeast Asia used to
be that the market was the key to eradicat i n g
poverty.To a large extent that indeed was the case.
However, the financial crisis has shaken that faith
and exposed the weakness of the economic tri c k l e -
down approach to poverty alleviation.
“The ‘ m a gic of the market’ m ay work for those
who have ready access to capital, i n f o rm ation and
s k i l l s ,” I n d o n e s i a ’s education and culture minister
J u wono Sudarsono last August told an intern at i o n a l
seminar on Indonesian reform s ,“ but not for those who
lack educat i o n , skills and well-placed connections.”
According to Indonesia’s Central Bureau of
Statistics, the number of people living below the
p ove rty line—those who consume a minimum
2,100 calories a day—had soared to 95.8 million or
about 48 per cent of Indonesia’s total population of
202 million by the end of 1998.
It is indeed a huge setback. In 1976 Indonesia had
54.2 million poor people or 40.1 per cent of the whole
p o p u l at i o n . But by 1996, after two decades of rapid
economic gr ow t h , the wo r l d ’s fourth most populous
c o u n t ry had reduced the number of the poor down to
22.5 million or 11.3 per cent of the populat i o n .
Economic recove ry is vital if the trend is to be
r e ve rs e d .H owe ve r , as a World Bank report points out,
the rapid economic gr owth of previous ye a rs had
papered over long-standing problems with regard
to pove rty alleviat i o n .Among these are persistent poc-
kets of pove rty and rising inequality, weaknesses in
labour rights and need for social security nets.
“A rapid return to macroeconomic stability and
gr owth through distri butionally favourable adjust-
ment policies is the only way to begin to put a flo o r



In A s i a , financial crisis has thrust millions back into
impoverishment and shattered faith in the ability of marke t s
alone to address the problems of the poor. But can the re g i o n
capitalize on the lessons learned from the cra s h ?
A fickle friend

under falling incomes of the poor,” says the World
Bank report.
In Indonesia, as in many other parts of A s i a ,h o u-
seholds by and large have few formal mechanisms to
protect them from pove rty resulting from job losses,
disability or agi n g .I n s t e a d ,most rely pri m a rily on per-
sonal savings and informal family and community
l i n k s. But the financial crisis has cut so deeply that
those bu f f e rs against pove rty are proving to be too thin
for comfort .
H a d i j a h , for example, spent 1.5 million rupiah of
her separation pay to build a small food ve n d i n g
stand in front of her house last December. A niece
c o n t ri buted 0.5 million rupiah to buy basic com-
m o d i t i e s.At the end of the month they are able to take
home a paltry 150,000 ru p i a h , under $20 at recent
exchange rat e s.
But not eve ryone has even that frail surv i va l
mechanism and the result has been the wo rst social
tension and violence seen in decades.
Crime triggered by hunger
Amid mounting ethnic and religious tension, ri o t s
and looting have taken place in Indonesian tow n s
and villages as demoralized soldiers do nothing bu t
look on. One of the wo rst riots took place in Ja k a rt a
on 14-16 May 1998 when thousands of looters ran
amok attacking properties owned by ethnic Chinese,
whose economic prominence in this country has
made them a target. More than 1,200 people we r e
k i l l e d , mostly in bu rned superm a r k e t s , and many
Indonesian women of Chinese descent were sexually
h a r a s s e d .E ven outside of ri o t s , looting has become a
major problem, with highwaymen along an import a n t
road linking Ja k a rta with Surabaya ,I n d o n e s i a ’s second
most populous city, simply stopping the dri ve rs and
taking over the trucks loaded with food
I r o n i c a l l y, the deva l u ation of Indonesia’s curr e n cy
since the crisis broke,along with rising food pri c e s ,h a s
caused a huge shift in the internal terms of trade in
favour of fa rm e rs ,while palm-oil and cocoa producers
h ave benefited from soaring world prices for their
p r o d u c e . The World Bank says rural consumption
has increased 10 per cent over the past ye a r.
“The driving force behind this crime is hunger.
The hungry and angry people provide a good place
for the devil,” said rural sociologist Loekman Soe-
t risno of Gajah Mada Unive rs i t y.
In response to the cri s i s , the gove rnment has
sold cheaply or even gi ven away basic commodities
like ri c e , sugar and cooking oil. C h a rity organizat i o n s
h ave organized cheap lunch boxes for poor wo r k e rs
and unemployed people.
But many analysts say that the effort is not
e n o u g h .
As recommended by the Intern ational Mone-
t a ry Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Deve l o p-
ment Bank—key sources of finance to prop up Indo-
nesia during the crisis—the gove rnment in Ja k a rta has
set aside about $2.4 billion in funds to carry out a
social safety net programme for the 1998/1999 fis c a l
ye a r.The programme consists of food subsidies for
the poor, health services and subsidized medicine,
financial help for schools and funds for social work to
boost employ m e n t .
H owe ve r , implementing the progr a m m e , i n t r o d u c e d
early last ye a r , is diffic u l t .According to Marie Muhammad,
who chairs a programme monitoring team, only about 30
per cent of funds had been disbu rsed by the beginning of
this year due to overcautiousness of gove rnment officials in
parceling out the aid for fear of any graft or other irr e g u-
l a ri t i e s.
L i k e w i s e ,T h a i l a n d , also hard hit by the financial cri s i s ,
is trying to improve its social security system. S e verance pay,
the key net for the unemploye d , last year was extended to
10 months from six months. The gove rnment has also
launched a program to provide free health care for laid-off
wo r k e rs and their fa m i l i e s.Aid from multilateral fin a n c i a l
institutions is being channeled increasingly into training and
other programmes to help the unemploye d .
E ven so, such efforts appear to be far from adequat e .
Southeast Asian countries have been so enfeebled by the
c risis that now, when social security is most needed, is also
the most difficult time for gove rnments to raise funds for
social welfare. So far, safety net programmes have been
set up as largely short-term measures to deal with the
effects of the crisis rather than as steps forward to restru c-
t u ring socio-economic systems over the long term with a
view to protecting the poor.
H owe ve r , Southeast Asia may at least have made a
s t a rt towards more aggr e s s i ve attempts to buffer the poor
against future crises in that there is now at least recognition
t h at the market alone is not enough to alleviate pove rt y.
