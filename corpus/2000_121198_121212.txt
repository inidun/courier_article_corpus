Wiring up the ivory towers
Prestigious universities are forging alliances to conquer a share of the 
e-learning market and stand up to virtual competitors
Just like airline companies, u n i v e r s i t i e s
around the world are forming partnerships
and consortia in response to the pressures of
g l o b a l i z a t i o n .The World Education Market
held in Vancouver last May was a timely
s i g n : t h e
fair, expressly organized to foster relations bet-
ween universities, training providers, software com-
panies and representatives from nations with large
education needs,attracted participants from over 60
countries.
This race to “partner up” is fuelled by a number
of factors. In most industrialized countries, g o v e r n-
ment funding for higher education has decreased,
forcing institutions to look for new markets either
to subsidize campus programmes or just to remain
v i a b l e.There is a  growing need for lifelong learning
as “jobs for life” vanish and the information society
drastically reduces the shelf-life of almost any edu-
cational qualific a t i o n .Technological developments,
increasingly necessary for learners in all fields to
master, offer ever more innovative tools for sup-
porting e-learning.
For business,online learning is “ t h e ”new market
o p p o r t u n i t y, with the need for re-training and pro-
fessional updating predicted to create an $11.5 billion
industry by 2003. Business is better able to develop
and maintain the technological infrastructure neces-
sary to run large online systems and everyone, i n c l u-
ding the universities, recognizes that it takes robust
telecommunications technology to deliver educa-
tion and training on the scale demanded.
A host of companies has sprung up to help uni-
versities shape and package courses for online pre-
s e n t a t i o n , while network providers are jockeying for
position to deliver online education.
The United States is the undisputed leader in the
field, prompting governments in the U.K.,Canada
and Australia to commission hefty studies on the
danger of national universities being eroded by
U. S.ventures turned global.Canada and the U. K .a r e

in the early stages of setting up their own virtual uni-
v e r s i t i e s. But what has become clear is that the conser-
vative and labyrinthine decision-making processes
which characterize most university procedures are
being jolted by a race to get a share of the lifelong
learning market.
So far, the most common approach for universities
to break into the e-learning universe has been to develop
courses specifically for a corporate partner or to form
alliances among themselves.Universitas 21, a company
incorporated in the U. K . , is a network of 18 leading
universities in ten countries.Earlier this year, it formed
a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corpora-
tion to provide premium higher education programmes
using new information technologies and learning
m e t h o d s.In October 2000, S t a n f o r d ,P r i n c e t o n ,Yale and
Oxford formed “ The Big Four A l l i a n c e,” aimed at offe-
ring courses in the arts and sciences
to 500,000 alumni.
Very often,prestigious universi-
ties have stayed clear of going fully
o n l i n e, seeing a danger to their
brand name.Many are limiting their
offerings to continuing education
programmes and/or non-degree
c o u r s e s, and more often than not,
they are aiming at the corporate
m a r k e t . One company,U N e x t . c o m ,
has partnered with first-class insti-
tutions such as the University of
Columbia (U. S.) and the London
School of Economics to create
online courses marketed under the
name Cardean University. Th e i r
t a r g e t : the Fortune 500 companies as
well as individual adults. Th e y ’v e
managed to attract Nobel laureates to design courses and
the universities receive royalties for their content. O t h e r
universities have formed spin-off for- p r o fit companies
s p e c i fically to develop online programmes.This facilitates
the commercialization of software and other products,
and is a way to take a commercial approach to conti-
nuing and professional studies without compromising
the University’s academic standing.
Then there are the freestanding for- p r o fit virtual uni-
v e r s i t i e s, which are arousing the ire of institutions that
have prided themselves on a long history of  public
s e r v i c e.The most quoted examplar is Phoenix Univer-
s i t y, the largest private outfit in the U. S. Now owned by
the Apollo Group, it operates the country’s largest
online programme with 12,200 students.The university
tracks students’ progress and contacts those who don’t
submit assignments on time or fail to enrol in subse-
quent courses.Many critics question Phoenix’s blatant
c o m m e r c i a l i z a t i o n , but few doubt the university’s
impact on continuing professional development pro-
vision.
Although e-learning is in its infancy, its impact can
already by gauged.New providers are coming on the
market all the time and the trend is accelerating to the
point of upsetting universities’ virtual monopoly in
educational accreditation.An Information Te c h n o l o g y
training course offered or accredited by Microsoft has
undoubtedly become more valuable than a Bachelor
of Science from a renowned university.
The more consumerist the approach of the edu-
cation provider,the more what is taught is influ e n c e d
by demand. M BAs dominate e-learning provision
and IT courses are a close second. While the new
consumer/learner demands fle x i b i l i t y,choice and just-
in-time learning opportunities,suppliers will inevitably
arise who are focused on meeting the demand at the
expense of quality and value. And is the consumer
really the best judge of what course material to
choose? Education is a more complex “ p r o d u c t ”t h a n
toothpaste or washing powder.A totally consumer-
driven education market is unlikely to be in society’s
best interests in the long term.
The commercialization of education usually
goes hand-in-hand with desegregation: c o u r s e
d e s i g n ,d e l i v e r y, t u t o r i n g, a s s e s s-
ment and accreditation may be
carried out by different organi-
z a t i o n s. Students might study
courses or modules from diffe-
rent universities or providers
and then put themselves for-
ward for examination and
accreditation by yet another ins-
titution. While most academics
loathe marking assignments,
they regard this scenario with
horror, and blame commercia-
lization for the demise of the
“community of scholars”
concept of a university. Th e
death of the “course” has also
been predicted, with learners—
especially corporate and on-the-
job learners—demanding short study modules.
What then happens to the ability to get an overview
of a field when learning consists of the student
selecting a whole series of unconnected learning
“bites”? Learners will be “ z a p p i n g ” between short
sequences or presentations much as they do bet-
ween television channels.
But while some faculty view e-learning with
a l a r m , technology-based learning is where most of the
pedagogical innovation is taking place in universities.
Multimedia learning resources and interactive simu-
lations are being developed for the web.C o l l a b o r a-
tive learning activities, new forms of online assess-
ment and small group teaching technologies are
making online courses more stimulating, i n t e r a c t i v e
and attractive than many face-to-face taught courses.
Despite “doom and gloom scenarios,”most mode-
rate observers of the scene see a continued future for
the campus university, especially at the undergra-
duate level, while e-learning will above all cater to
a d u l t , professional and independent learners. S o m e
commercialization of education is good  if it fosters
i n n o v a t i o n ,concern for quality and responsiveness to
consumer demands.But if some is good, more is not
necessarily better! Not in education at least. ■
