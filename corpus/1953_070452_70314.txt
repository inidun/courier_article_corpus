THE RACIAL HERITAGE OF'H. M. S. BOUNTY
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLES-NOW ONE FAMILY
PERHAPS the most widely knownof all cases of race mixture is
the small group of Polynesian-
English mixed bloods that live on
Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific.
Here on a tiny volcanic island only
about two miles long and about half
as wide were resolved the train of
events that the famous mutiny of
the Bounty set in action.
This episode, famous in British
naval annals, occurred in the year
1789 shortly after.'H. M. S. Bounty"
had departed from Tahiti where she
had been dispatched under the
command of Lt. William Bligh to
collect bread fruit plants. Reports
brought back to Europe by Cook and
Bougainville described the bread
fruit as a remarkable tree capable of
supplying a staple article of food
with a minimum of effort.
British planters in the West Indies,
eager to obtain so easy a source of
foodstuff for their slaves, had
petitioned for the expedition with
by Dr. Horry L. Shapiro.
which Bligh had been entrusted.
Now after six successful months in
Tahiti, with the ship's hold full of
potted trees, the return trip was in-
terrupted by the mutiny of twenty-
five of the men out of the crew of
forty-four. The mutineers were led
by Fletcher Christian, one of Bligh's
officers, and a native of the Isle of
Man where his family had long been
prominent.
The mutineers seizing the ship, put
Bligh and those faithful to him
adrift in a small open boat and reset
the Bounty's course for Tubuai, an
island 300 miles south of Tahiti.
Here an abortive attempt was made
to establish a settlement, which
failed because of the hostility
aroused in the natives by the
behaviour of the mutineers. Re-
turning after this to Tahiti, the
mutineers now split into two groups :
one, consisting of sixteen men,
preferred to remain in Tahiti where
a number of them had already
established liaisons with native
women and had been welcomed into
the island homes ; the other con-
tained nine men headed by Chris-
tian. These men, apparently an-
ticipating a possible punitive ex-
pedition once the news of the mutiny
reached England, were eager to
leave Tahiti where they could not
hope to escape capture and to find a
more remote land perhaps in-
accessible island where they might
remain undetected.
Accordingly they, together with
twelve Tahitian women and six
Tahitian men, set sail from Tahiti
in September 1789 and until 1808
were virtually lost to the world. In
the latter year their retreat on
Pitcairn, some 2, 500 miles southeast
of Tahiti, was discovered by Captain
Meyhew Folger.
During this interval much had
happened on the island. All the
Tahitian men and all but one of the
Englishmen had died-most of them
violently and after only a short
sojourn in their new home. In
addition, Folger found eight or nine
surviving Tahitian women and
twenty-five children, offspring of six
of the Englishmen and their native
wives. None of the Tahitian men
had left issue, perhaps because they
were murdered too soon after the
settlement on the island.
. From this handful of children, half
Polynesian half English, the little
colony increased by leaps and bounds
until fifty years later there were
almost 200 inhabitants on the island.
By this time fear of over-population
and the recurrence of water
shortages induced them to request of
the British Government the use of
Norfolk Island, some 4, 000 miles to
the west, as a new home. This
considerably larger island had re-
cently been abandoned as a penal

colony and was temporarily un-
occupied.
In 1856 the entire colony moved
there and set up a new estab-
lishment, but subsequently several
families returned to their beloved
Pitcairn. In 1864 there were 45
descendants of the mutineers living
on Pitcairn, the remainder having
continued on Norfolk. At present
there are on both islands about 1, 000
descendants of the original colony,
not counting those who have
married out of the community or
settled in New Zealand, Australia,
and elsewhere.
An unusual mixture
As an example of race mixturethe Pitcairn Islanders are far
from typical. But it is the
very singularity of the colony that is
full of meaning in interpreting race
mixture as we commonly see it. Sim-
ply as a cross between Polynesians
and English they can be matched in
many parts of Polynesia where the
same kind of mingling has occurred,
often with notable results as in New
Zealand. But unlike all other
mixtures of this kind in Oceania, and
indeed unlike virtually all race
mixture wherever it occurs (1), the
Pitcairn Islanders have lived and
developed their common life
completely separated from the
societies from which they were
originally derived.
Now it is an almost universal
consequence of race mixture that the
mixed bloods live in contact with the
parental groups and in one or the
other of the parental societies.
Since social status works both ways,
the association of a mixed group
with one of its parental societies can
be a decisive influence on its
development. Where mixed bloods
suffer legal disability, economic in-
justice or social prejudice, they are
victims of the attitudes well or ill-
founded, of the dominant element in
their society. The effects such as
resentment or antagonism upon the
mixed group in turn reinforce the
attitudes that provoke them.
It is because of all this that the
Pitcairn Islanders'complete separa-
tion from and independence of all
other societies assume added im-
portance, for here the entire com-
munity was of the same mixed
origin, was free of any social
structuring imposed upon them by a
larger society and escaped the in-
fluences that prejudice subtly works
upon its object. This, then, is a
community where social prejudice, at
least, is not a factor to be considered
and where we can study the con-
sequences of race mixture divorced
from the concomitant effects that
being a part of a larger group might
impose.
The last mutineer
ON the other hand, in any con-sideration of the colony, its
very isolation must be kept in
mind as it must be in appraising any
small community remote from the
world and cut off from the intellec-
tual and material stimuli of a larger
society. For the first eighteen years
of its existence, the Pitcairn colony
remained unvisited by any ship. The
children growing up in the first
generation of the community had
m ver seen anyone not a member of
their little family, for the early
colony lived as one extended family
with John Adams, the surviving
mutineer, as their pater familias.
Even after 1808 when their
existence became known, callers were
rare and their visits very brief. Not
until the 1820's did ships begin to
call at Pitcairn to obtain water and
fresh food. As American whaling
became increasingly active in the
Pacific these visits increased in
number, reaching their highest
frequency in the 1840's.
With the decline of whaling, Pit-
cairn once more reverted to its
former loneliness. These contacts,
although important in bringing to
the islanders the goods of the outside
world for which they had acquired
a taste, were brief and had little or
no influence on the social structure
of the colony.
It would, of course, be futile to
attempt to rate Pitcairn against
other communities mixed or other-
wise. There are too many variables
impossible to standardize that would
have to be taken into account. But
it is evident to anyone visiting the
island that here is a well-organized
settlement, conducting its own
affairs successfully under a system
devised by the islanders themselves.
Like people anywhere of course they
vary, but the visitor is invariably
impressed by the pleasant, friendly
manners of the islanders, their
charm, their hospitality and self
confidence. There is no trace here
of a people conscious of inferiority.
Remarkable in so small a commun-
ity, especially one cut off from the
developments of the outside world,
striking way illustrates the decisive
roles that sex and environment may
play in creating a new society. The
cultural resources available to the
new colony were, of course, English
and Tahitian. But it is obvious on re-
flection that not all the content of
either of these cultures could or
would be drawn upon since one cul-
ture, the English, was accessible only
through men who were sailors by
occupation, and the other, the Tahi-
tian, was represented by women who
were familiar with the crafts and
skills traditionally exercised in Ta-
hiti by their sex.
In addition to this, the colony on*
Pitcairn faced an environment unlike
the seats of either people, and in
transplanting their traditional ways
both the Tahitian women and the
English sailors found themselves
without the usual technical equip-
ment needed to practice whatever
skills and arts they knew. Even
such a basic and necessary object as
a nail was not available, not to
terials and hampered by the lack of
tools.
We find them as a consequence
building houses ingeniously put
together, the frame mortised, the
walls constructed of roughly hewn
planks fitted into slotted uprights,
the interiors provided with bunks
as in a ship's cabin. The roof,
however, was thatched in the Tahi-
tian manner since roof thatching is
prepared in Tahiti by the women
and this was a contribution the
Tahitian women on Pitcairn could
make to this novel house.
One of the common allegations
made about race mixture is that it
produces inferior human beings.
This belief is stated in various ways
that all come to the same thing :
mixed bloods combine the worst
features of both parental groups,
they are inferior to both stocks, or,
at best, they are intermediate and
therefore a debasement of the su-
perior group. This kind of state-
ment is put forth with respect to the
Led by Fletcher Christian, nine of the mutineers of the"Bounty"together with some Tahitian men and women sailed 2, 500
miles across the South Pacific to seek a hiding place. They found it on Pitcairn, a tiny volcanic island, about two miles long

are some of the social institutions
which were established on Pitcairn
and maintained there ever since.
A democratic rule developed early
with all men and women enjoying
equal political rights, long before
political rights were granted women
in the Western World and indeed
before they were even very seriously
discussed there. Education was from
the first recognized as a necessity
and as the local institutions took
form, all children were required to
attend school until their sixteenth
year. The various families on the
island were taxed for the mainten-
ance of the school. Teachers were
selected from the students and
supported by the revenue levied on
the people. Here, too, the Pitcairn
Islanders were in advance of educ-
ational developments in greater cen-
tres of civilization.
The culture that emerged on
Pitcairn also reflected the mixed
origin of the colony and in a rather
mention a variety of common tools
that could not be fashioned on
Pitcairn.
Thus we find tata cloth univers-
ally used by the colony in its early
days. The making of this bark
cloth is traditionally a woman's job
in Tahiti and could be carried to
Pitcairn intact. Similarly, cooking
being a woman's concern, the Tahi-
tian technique of an underground
oven was standard on Pitcairn.
House building, on the contrary,
was the result of a complex of in-
fluences. The Tahitian style of
house would have been unsuitable in
the colder climate of Pitcairn, but in
any event it probably could not have
been built by the women who in
Tahiti leave the framing of a house
to the men. The Englishmen, prob-
ably only as adept in carpentry as
sailors of those days might be
expected to be, were handicapped
by the lack of essential building ma-
psychological (intellectual), moral
and biological characteristics of the
hybrids.
For the most part, the evidence
for this belief is strained through a
subjective sieve and rarely takes
account of the effect upon the
hybrid of his social, psychological
and economic position in the society
whose more favoured strains are
compared with him. But more
fundamental is the lack of reliable
measures for many of the qualities
in which the mixed blood is supposed
to be deficient.
As far as the Pitcairn Islanders
are concerned, I can offer no objec-
tive data on their psychological or
moral qualities. None to my know-
ledge is available. Certainly there
have been many published appraisals
of these traits of the islanders and
most of them are enthusiastic.

THE PITCAIRN ISLAND
DESCENDANTS OF THE
BOUNTY MUT) NEERS
(Continued from page 7.)
How far the romantic aura that
surrounds these people has seduc-
ed their visitors is beyond cal-
culation.
In the mid-nineteenth century
the typical reaction was delight
in finding so moral, upright and
virtuous a colony sprung from
mutineers, from violence and
from murder. Nowadays, being
less concerned with religiou. s
matters, with on the whole rather
different values, the present visi-
tor is less impressed by these qua-
lities and is likely to prize other
aspects of their character.
For my part I can only report
that, allowing for their isolation
and for a consequent
lack of sophistica-
tion, I found the
Pitcairn Islanders an
intelligent and at-
tractive people. And
I was struck by the
number of men and
women of impressive
character, possesses
of the qualities that
make for leadership.
Although biologi-
cally rather more of
what might be called
objective informa-
tion is accessible,
still it can only be
used for comparative
purposes with cau-
tion. Even such
standard criteria as
physical vigour, lon-
getivy or health can-
not be properly used
for such purposes
without reference to
diet, climate and va-
rious other environ-
mental conditions.
Both on Norfolk and
Pitcairn Islands the
physical condition of
the islanders was
excellent. In spite
of the inbreeding,
which has especially
characterized Pit-
cairn, I found no
physical deformities
or obvious signs of
degeneration.
On Pitcairn with a
population of 200
(1936) there were no
individuals incapa-
ble of taking care of
themselves, nor any
cases of serious
mental deficiency.
This is an excellent
record compared
with the frequency
of such cases in Eu-
rope and the United
States, especially in
remote, inbred vil-
lages.
In view of the fact
that neither on Pit-
cairn nor Norfolk is
there any resident
medical services or
even trained nurs-
ing aid, the longe-
vity of the popula--..
tion is impressive. In 1924, out
of a population of about 600 on
Norfolk, there were 24 who were
over 65 years of age, with the
oldest reaching 95 years. On
Pitcairn there were 12 between
the ages of 65 and 86 in a popu-
lation of 200.
There have been some claims
that hybrids are smaller and
weaker than their parents. Dav-
enport and Steggerda on the
basis of their study of race mix-
ture in Jamaica believed their

ISLANDERS
data demonstrated this conclu-
sion. The Pitcairn and Norfolk
evidence is quite the contrary.
Indeed, there is evidence here of
hybrid vigour comparable to the
vigour that can be demonstrated
experimentally in a large number
of animal and plant crosses and
which is real enough to be com-
mercially valuable to seed compa-
nies.
For example, if we take size as
a measure of heightened physio-
logical vigour as is done for maize
or crossbred domestic animals,
we find that the average stature
of the parental groups is 171. 4
centimeters for Tahitian males
and 170. 6 centime-
ters for the muti-
neers (based on Bri-
tish Admiralty re-
cords but possibly a
little low since some
of the sailors were
not fully mature
men). The modern
Englishman averages
around 172 centime-
ters. The first gene-
ration descendants,
averaged 177. 8 cen-
timeters (minimum
5 feet 9 1/2 inches,
maximum 6 feet 1/4
inch). This repre-
sents an average
increase of over two
inches, with the
shortest male ex-
ceeding the average
of his parental
groups by a consid-
erable margin. Alt-
though this striking
increase has not
been fully main-
tained in the present
generation, it is still
almost an inch
above the parental
average.
As another index
of this vigour, the
reproductive rate of
the islanders is
equally notable. I
have already refer-
red to the prodi-
giously rapid growth
of the colony which
has produced in 160
odd years well over
1, 000 descendants.
This may be appre-
ciated from the birth
rate by generations.
The first generation
averaged 7. 44 chil-
dren per mating, the
second 9. 10, the third
5. 39. Since then
there has been a
further decline. The
rate in the second
generation is one of
the highest on re-
cord for any com-
munity and reflects
an unusual repro-
ductive vigour.
As far as the
evidence goes, then,
the Pitcairn exper-
iment lends no support for the
thesis that race mixture merely
leads to degeneration or at best
produces a breed inferior to the
superior parental race. In fact,
we see in this colony some support
for heightened vigour, for an ex-
tended variation and for a suc-
cessful issue of the mingling of
two diverse strains.
