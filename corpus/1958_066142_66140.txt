Translation in the Modern World
by B. Gary
CC For tne past two nunarea
years, the civilized world
has been wasting a vast
amount of energy in diligently
translating books published in one
language into all the others."
This flat statement made by an
eminent Sinologist and translator,
Georges Margoulies, reflects one
attitude to a characteristic problem
of our times. What is the place of
translation in the modern world?
The latest volume of Unesco's
Index Translationum lists 27,617 works
translated throughout the world in
1956 (see pp. 11 and 35). The data in
the Index cover only 52 countries out
of the hundred or so usually found in
an atlas, and in some cases, even
these data are very incomplete.
What is published represents only
a very small part of the translation
work which is going on all the time
in the modern world. Technical
translations although at least as
numerous as literary translations,
only occasionally make their appear¬
ance in print in bookshops. Technical
translators work on articles from
periodicals, patents, instruction books,
catalogues and photostats, and the
results of their labours are often
transmitted confidentially, in the
form of microfilms or typewritten
documents, by information centres or
private offices. And this takes no
account of the daily work accomplish¬
ed by anonymous commercial transla¬
tors, civil servants, countless bi¬
lingual secretaries and others.
The Yearbook of International
Organizations for 1954, for
example, listed 1,138 interna¬
tional organizations, societies, asso¬
ciations, unions, and federations.
Here again, the Yearbook really
covers only part of the world and
even in this part many societies take
.no steps to publicize their work.
The organizations listed publish
hundreds of periodicals, generally
bilingual or multilingual. During
1954, they held over a thousand
congresses, conferences, symposia,
seminars and other meetings, each
usually requiring the services of
bilingual minute writers, translators,
and interpreters. At a recent In¬
ternational Labour Conference, held
in Geneva, there were no less than
72 interpreters.
No reliable figures regarding the
translation of the dialogue of sound
films are available. However, it has
been established, for example, that
5,600 films were provided with sub¬
titles and 3,000 were dubbed in France
between 1946 and 1952. A report
published by Unesco shows that the
proportion of foreign films exhibited
in Italy. Spain, Sweden, Turkey,
Brazil and the Federal Republic of
Germany is still larger than in
France. In a country like the Soviet
Union, even national films are auto¬
matically dubbed in the principal
languages of the Union Ukrainian,
Byelorussian, Georgian, Armenian,
Kirghiz, Tadzhik, etc. and vice versa.
As for the United Nations, it has its
own film studio, and there are for
example, 18 different language ver¬
sions of the Organization's film,
"Defence of Peace/'
Here, we have referred only to the
best-known spheres of transla¬
tion, but there is no branch of
human activity today in which it can
be claimed that translation is not ne¬
cessary. In buying and selling, build¬
ing machinery or tackling scientific
problems, the services of translators
are indispensable. In the space of
twenty-five years, the number of
books translated has doubled in
France and quadrupled in Czechoslov¬
akia. There are now three times as
many foreign plays acted in Paris as
there were a quarter of a century
ago. At that time, dubbing had only
just been invented. Fifty years ago,
only a few international conferences
were held every year and they did
not use interpreters. Traditional
diplomacy has given place to that
extraordinary new phenomenon
known as "international life," which
sweeps into its orbit ministers and
scientists, industrialists and artists;
and this young Titan, of incalculable
strength, babbles in every tongue.
For this is another major aspect
of the problem.
Until the Renaissance, Europe had
lived in the illusion that there was
a universal language, of which all
others were more or less fortuitous
corruption. In the eighteenth century,
the Abbé Gédoyn, a translator and
member of the Académie française,
was still stating firmly that: "to
translate is to put a classical writer
Greek or Latin into a vernacular
language."
With the Renaissance, these "ver¬
nacular" languages began to come
into their own, but the great move¬
ment which was to follow was not
foreseen at that time. Very soon,
links had to be established, not only
between such languages and Latin,
but also among those languages
themselves. People were quick to
realize too, that vast cultural re¬
sources, no less rich and no less
ancient, existed outside the Greek
and Latin spheres. In India alone,
there are over one hundred languages
and dialects, and each of six of those
languages is spoken by more than
twenty million people. The Bible has
been translated, in whole or in part,
into 1,353 languages by the Bible
Society alone, without counting
translations made by other bodies.
Today, the man in the street is
beginning to recognize that different,
languages are a feature of life and
that, taken all round, one is probably
as good as another. This is indicative
of a very profound change and an
overthrow of habits which go back to
the beginning of time. In all civiliza¬
tions, the use of a certain language
has been one of the first distinguish¬
ing signs of humanity. A Slav is a
man who has the gift of slovo, or
speech, a foreigner being "dumb." To
the ancient Chinese, to speak a
foreign language was to be doomed
to the subhuman fate of a Barbarian.
This recognition of the linguistic
diversity of the human race is
probably more significant than is yet
generally realized. Suspicion and
superstitious fear of everything
foreign may henceforth give place to
a will to achieve that international
understanding, so essential to man¬
kind in a world in which technology
has suddenly given it power on a
planetary scale. Having for thous¬
ands of years stood slightly aside
from man's everyday concerns, the
translator suddenly finds himself at
the very heart of man's problems and
among the most important architects
of this new world without barriers
which is taking shape before our eyes.
After being considered as odd or
exceptional, he is now admitted to
the ranks of those whose services are
deemed indispensable and sought
daily.
So far we have spoken only of
translation in terms of space, but our
languages are also growing old.
Rabelais is already being translated
into modern French and the Ballad
of the Band of Igor into modern
Russian. The time will come when
similar translations will have to be
made of Sartre and Gorki, Faulkner
and Selma Lagerlöf...
T
hese then are the facts or some
of them.
Is there any reason here to
talk of waste and squandering of time
and effort? Are we to look back re¬
gretfully to the age of barriers, or to
hope for complete linguistic uniform¬
ity at some future date?
Immobility may have its attractions
and static periods may sometimes
have had much to recummend them,
but the contemporary world like life
itself is on the move, and all move¬
ment entails expenditure of energy.
Translation is one form of this
general movement and has become
necessary to modern
life, lending speed and
flexibility to its tempo.

tantly increasing num¬

Translation in
the modern world c-^
society an enormous amount of effort,
it is certainly not expended in vain.
Translation, far from diminishing the
efficiency of the activities which it
serves, on the contrary increases it
tenfold. Printing, too, calls for mental
and physical effort, but it is thanks
to this invention that each book is
read in thousands of copies and that
thousands of books are written where
only one would have been written
before. Translation plays its part in
this attempt to popularize all know¬
ledge. As Ernest Renan said: a book
which is not translated is only half
published.
Nor is this all: by establishing
contacts, translation greatly enriches
all forms of culture. Literature,
philosophy and science are able to
draw upon resources beyond national
boundaries, which they could not find
within the confines of any one
country.
And it is no exaggeration to say
that such comparison with the
achievements of other countries
enables any healthy and vigorous
culture to discover its own originality
and to find itself. All our literatures
began with translations. On reading
the Défense et Illustration de la Lan¬
gue française, the first impression is
that it is a treatise on translation.
In his talks with Eckermann,
Goethe foresaw and welcomed the
advent of a universal literature. The
twentieth century has indeed put the
stamp of unity on this world of ours;
it has made men aware of their inter¬
dependence on a world-wide scale.
This in no way implies a fusion of
individual means of expression or
any sort of levelling down. Never
before, perhaps, have national feeling
and the desire for cultural individual¬
ity been so strong in all continents.
Analysing the fact that "conscious¬
ness is beginning to be planetary,"
such a man as Thornton Wilder has
said that he regards this as a further
extension of human consciousness.
Henceforth, to quote his own words,
"new is the response provoked in the
writer in relation to his own language
and his own environment."
Translation has become a human
activity of basic importance. The
translator, formerly unappreciated,
has left his ivory tower to come down
into the market place, into the
workrooms and shops, into the
councils of the great and the games
of the children. He is the tireless
builder of bridges at the very heart of
a universe which has adopted the
motto of the sage of Weimar: "What
matters is to travel."
