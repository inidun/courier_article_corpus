Stress-free learning? By some estimates, at least one million American children are home schooled.
■
Twenty ye a rs ago, C h ristopher and
Eileen Herman would have technically
been breaking the law. Opting against
c o nventional schooling, the parents are tea-
ching their two children at their home in
Washington stat e ,where until 1985, the only
legal way to home school was to hold a stat e
teaching license—something they both lack.
But today, the Hermans not only can
teach their children at home without fear of
p r o s e c u t i o n , they also have an extensive arr ay
of resources and supports at their disposal.
They belong to three local organizations of
parents who educate their children at home,
attend state-wide home schoolers ’ c o nve n-
t i o n s , and regularly cull advice from similar
families on the Intern e t .“Just about eve ry b o d y
k n ows someone who’s home schooling,”M rs.
H e rman say s.“ People may still think it’s kind
of odd, but there isn’t as much suspicion or
hostility any m o r e .”
Legal recognition
I n d e e d , the Hermans are part of one of the
fastest gr owing educational trends in the Uni-
ted Stat e s.By some estimat e s , the number of
home schooled children in the country has
gr own from roughly 50,000 in the mid-1980s
to at least one million today. ( O t h e rs peg the
p o p u l ation as high as 1.8 million).While that
still represents at most only three percent of
the total number of the country ’s school-aged
c h i l d r e n , the rapid rise in the popularity of
home schooling deserves notice.It has quickly
become the second most popular form of non-
g ove rnment sponsored education in the U. S . ,
n ow outranked only by the schools affil i at e d
with the Roman Catholic church.
“One big accomplishment of the move-
ment is that they’ve made home schooling a
viable educational option,” s ays Mitchell Ste-
ve n s , a sociologist at Hamilton College in
C l i n t o n , N. Y.and the author of an upcoming
book on home schooling.“It now has a small
place in the menu of educational choices in
this country.”
The forces behind the movement are com-
p l e x , and the bigger it gets, the harder it
becomes to describe a “ t y p i c a l ”home schoo-
l e r. Most experts see two ve ry different
l i n e a g e s.One was born in the late 1960s from
the altern at i ve school move m e n t , whose fol-
l owe rs believe children learn best when libe-
r ated from the ri gid structures of form a l
schooling and allowed to pursue their ow n
i n t e r e s t s.The other was largely fueled by the
c o n c e rns of some conservat i ve Protestant
families who—at about the same time—began
to wo rry that the public schools could no lon-
ger ensure the proper form ation of their chil-
d r e n ’s character.“Both are skeptical of the
bu r e a u c r atic organization of educat i o n ,”S t e-
vens say s. “ I t ’s a matter of, ‘I don’t wa n t
someone else taking care of my children.’ ”
Until the 1980s, home schooling in the
United States was still largely an undergr o u n d
a c t i v i t y,without legal recognition. But as the
number of practitioners gr e w, judges and
p r o s e c u t o rs became more willing to accept
t h at home schooling was permitted under
legal provisions allowing children who we r e n ’t
in school to be ‘otherwise instru c t e d .’ In 1983,
a d vo c ates formed the Home School Legal
Defense A s s o c i ation to push the issue in stat e
l e gi s l atures and to provide legal representat i o n
to individual home schooling fa m i l i e s.
To d ay, the practice is recognized as legal
in all 50 stat e s , although its regulation va ri e s
gr e at l y. I d a h o, for example,places ve ry few res-
t rictions on home schooling parents,not eve n
asking that they inform any state or local offi-
cials of their intentions. O r e g o n ,m e a n w h i l e ,
m a n d ates that such families periodically have
a ‘ q u a l i fied neutral pers o n ’ test their chil-
d r e n . N owhere in the U. S . are parents now
required—as they once were in Wa s h i n g t o n
s t ate—to be licensed teachers.A few states call
for parents to either have some college edu-
c ation or follow a home schooling ‘ q u a l i fie r ’
c o u rse at a community college.
S t ate laws often stipulate the number of
d ays of instruction and the general content
areas to be covered by fa m i l i e s. But while
these provisions usually call on parents to
keep records of their children’s progr e s s ,t h e y
are generally not required to turn these ove r



DOING IT 
T HEIR OWN WAY

to a gove rnment body. “ E ven the most ri g o-
rously regulated states in A m e rica have some
flexibility—a recognition that your child may
be learning at a different pace,” s ays Pat ri c k
Fa r e n g a , president of Holt A s s o c i at e s , a Cam-
b ridge (Massachusetts)-based publisher of
home schooling mat e ri a l s. S t ate and local
school districts va ry in how they accommo-
d ate home-schooled children. In some cases,
they are allowed to part i c i p ate in field trips or
sign up for certain classes while in others ,
school officials do not let them join any extra-
c u rricular activities.
Although conservat i ve Protestants appear
to make up the largest single bloc of home
s c h o o l e rs , the movement is dive rs i f y i n g .I n
recent ye a rs ,C at h o l i c, M u s l i m , and Je w i s h
home schoolers have formed their own orga-
n i z at i o n s ,and the practice continues to at t r a c t
a substantial number of more secular-min-
ded fa m i l i e s. S u rveys by the National Home
E d u c ation Research Institute in Salem (Ore-
gon) suggest that religion still is the most com-
mon reason for home schooling, but the
research centre also has identified five other
strong motivat i o n s :c o n c e rn about the aca-
demic quality of local conventional schools;
a belief that the best education also is the most
i n d i v i d u a l i z e d ; the desire to enhance rela-
tionships among family members ; an at t e m p t
to mitigate the negat i ve influences of peer
p r e s s u r e ; and wo rries that schools are beco-
ming increasingly unsafe. O f t e n , these rea-
Perhaps one of the best indications of
success is home schooling’s gr owing reco-
gnition by A m e rican colleges and unive rs i-
t i e s.The Home School Legal Defense A s s o-
c i ation recently surve yed more than 500
institutions of higher learning and found
t h at all but two had admissions policies for
e va l u ating home schooled students who lack
traditional high school records. M a ny col-
leges now accept evidence of student pro-
gress prepared by parents, p o rtfolios of their
wo r k , and standardized tests in place of
transcripts.
Despite its gr owing acceptance, p a r e n t s
still are sometimes brought before judges in
d i s a greements over whether they’ve corr e c t l y
f o l l owed state regulat i o n s. In a highly-publi-
cized case last ye a r , a Ve rmont home schoo-
ler was jailed for two weeks for refusing to let
s t ate examiners eva l u ate her 15-year-old son.
S t ate officials argued that they needed to make
sure the boy—reputed by local school offi-
cials to have learning defic i e n c i e s — was being
a d e q u ately served at home.
While public approval of home schoo-
ling has spread, it isn’t unive rs a l . A 1997
survey co-sponsored by the Gallup polling
organization and the international educa-
tion organization Phi Delta Kappa showed
that 57 per cent of Americans think home
schooling is a ‘bad thing’—though this wa s
d own from the 73 per cent reported 12
ye a rs earlier.The National Education A s s o-
sons ove r l a p.
Home schooling techniques va ry as much
as the motivations for doing it. In a country
with no national curri c u l u m ,s t ates are res-
ponsible for setting educational standards,
which are generally only loosely applied to
home schoolers. Parents generally put toge-
ther their instructional plan themselve s.H u n-
dreds of publishers now produce mat e ri a l s
geared toward home schoolers , their wa r e s
sold through the World Wide We b , in specia-
lized magazines and conve n t i o n s.They refle c t
a wide arr ay of educational approaches and
p h i l o s o p h i e s , from non-denominational cor-
respondence courses to mat e rials “ built upon
the firm foundation of scriptural tru t h ”a n d
not the “ p s e u d o - s c i e n t i fic jargon of the secu-
lar educat i o n i s t s.”
Trust in public schools
The few large-scale research projects that
h ave been carried out in the United Stat e s
suggest that the home schooled children
whose families part i c i p ated in the studies tend
to perform well above the national average on
standardized tests. But many researchers are
hesitant to make too much of such fin d i n g s ,
because of the obvious self-selection problem.
F u rt h e r ,m a ny agree that a substantial num-
ber of home schoolers remain undergr o u n d ,
refusing to be counted by state or local autho-
ri t i e s , and making it difficult to reach conclu-
s i o n s.
Keeping in tune: taking part in extra-curricular activities outside the home is just one way of interacting with other children.

c i at i o n , the country ’s largest teachers ’
u n i o n , also maintains a policy stat e m e n t
arguing that , “home schooling progr a m s
cannot provide the student with a compre-
h e n s i ve education experi e n c e .”The Nat i o-
nal A s s o c i ation of Elementary School Pri n-
cipals has issued a similar warning, adding
that government authorties should “make
c e rtain that those who exercise these
options are held strictly accountable for the
academic achievement and social/emotio-
nal gr owth of children.” A major part of
their concern is that home schooled stu-
dents may not learn enough about relating
to children from other backgrounds.
Home schoolers themselves disagr e e
about how big the movement will gr ow.
Some predict a straight-line gr owth for
many more years, while others see it soon
reaching a point of diminishing return s.
Polls suggest that most Americans remain
s at i s fied with their local public schools,
which educate about 90 per cent of the
c o u n t ry ’s students. But most observe rs
agree that, however large, home schooling
has established itself as a lasting feature in
the landscape of A m e rican educat i o n . A s
parent and publisher Patrick Farenga puts
it, “the concept of education is no longer
held to the schools like monks in a monas-
tery.” ■
