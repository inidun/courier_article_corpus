A daily dozen
a day to keep
cardiologists
away
by Emgeni I. Chazov
A study carried
out on men aged from 50 to
59 by the Myasnikov Institute
of Cardiology, in Moscow,
shows that one man in five
suffers frcm coronary heart
disease and nearly one in
four has high blood pressure
(hypertension).
It also reveals that these
diseases now occur more fre¬
quently in. younger persons.
Deaths from cardiovascular dis¬
eases in men aged from 35 to
44 have risen sharply, and a
serious increase is noted in
even younger, men.
According to the Myasnikov
Institute, which collaborates
with the World Health Organi¬
zation as a cardiovascular
research centre, atherosclerotic
changes In the vessejs of the
heart and aorta are also on
the increase among younger
persons.
This finding Is. borne out by
research at Riga (Latvia) where
doctors investigating the deaths
of persons between the ages
of 30 and 39 who had suffered
from atherosclerosis found that
on the average 22 per cent of
the internal surface of the ab¬
dominal aorta was - affected
by the disease.
This disease, however, be¬
comes far more serious after
the age of 40 and complications
such as heart attacks and
strokes may well occur.
Observations have revealed
two important factors: where
one lives and how one lives.
EVGENI I. CHAZOV is a cor¬
responding Member of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Medical
Sciences. In 1969, he was
awarded a State Prize for devel¬
oping new methods of treatment
for coronary heart disease. He
is the author of many publica¬
tions and research studies on
the problems of cardiovascular
disease. Prof. Chazov, who is
41 years old, Is now Deputy
Minister of Public Health of the
U.S.S.R.
While 2.2 per cent of workers
over the age of 40 In Moscow
fall victims to heart attacks, the
figure for a comparable group
of workers in Ufa, in the
southern Urals, Is only 0.6 per
cent. This suggests that the
faster pace and different pattern
of life In the capital may
increase vulnerability to heart
attacks.
Current research in the
U.S.S.R. points to the influence
of certain environmental fac¬
tors on the appearance and
development of several dis¬
eases of the heart In many
rural areas, hypertension is
found only half as often as in
the towns. In some parts of
eastern Siberia, for example,
angina pectoris among smokers
over the age of 30 was observ¬
ed in 27 persons out of 1,000,
whereas in non-smokers of the
same age group the proportion
was only 16 per thousand.
In some parts of Uzbekistan,
the frequency of coronary heart
disease among local people
who eat vegetable fats has
been compared with that among
immigrants who eat mainly ani¬
mal fats. Among local men
over the age of 30, only 3.2 per
cent had coronary atheroscle¬
rosis; among the immigrants the
percentage was 8.8 per cent.
Occupation seems also to
play a part In the appearance
of coronary disease and heart
attacks. Among technical en¬
gineering personnel, the rate Is
twice that of workers whose
jobs apparently cause less
mental strain. This situation,
however, is changing, since
nowadays jobs tend to be¬
come more and more complex
and often lead to increased
nervous tension.
The Importance of mental
factors has been confirmed
many times. Among 200,000
workers and employees In Mos¬
cow, high blood pressure was
found most frequently among
workshop engineers, foremen,
dispatchers and technicians, of
whom 7.2 per cent were affect-

It is all too easy for the harassed
city-dweller to neglect his body,
already enduring the stress
and pollution of modern
industrialized life. The value of
moderate physical exercise
as a means of preventing heart
disease is now widely recognized.
Some 50 million people belong
to physical culture organizations In
the Soviet Union (photo left).

ed. The next group consisted
of engineering constructors,
workers in the technical control
sectors and accountants, of
whom 6.2 per cent were
affected.
High blood pressure often
occurs among workers exposed
to excessive noise, vibrations
or other unfavourable con¬
ditions. For example, the per¬
centage of cases of high blood
pressure was 6.9 among
polishers, and 5.7 among elec¬
trical fitters. The disease is
also common among bus and
taxi drivers.
Among women, high blood
pressure is frequent among
telephonists and telegraphists,
who work "under pressure".
It is less frequent among
women in textile factories.
Studies carried out in eastern
Siberia, where very strong
liquor is drunk, and in Georgia,
where dry wines are mainly
consumed, have shown no rela¬
tionship between the occurrence
of coronary atherosclerosis or
ischaemic heart disease and
the consumption of alcohol,
although alcohol undoubtedly
plays a part in the appearance
of cardiac insufficiency.
The tendency to have heart
attacks at an earlier age is
found in many countries. The
explanation may be that athero¬
sclerosis of the coronary
arteries starts to develop now¬
adays much earlier. This, in
turn relates to a number of
factors: reduced physical acti¬
vity, dietary changes and
greater emotional strain brought
about by technological dev¬
elopment and the frantic tempo
of modern life.
The part played by stress in
heart attacks is particularly
obvious. At the Myasnikov Ins¬
titute of Cardiology, we studied
the events that led up to the
heart attack in many of our
patients. The attack was imme¬
diately preceded in 20.5 per
cent of cases by an acute emo¬
tional shock; in 35 per cent by
a state of emotional tension
lasting several days; in 30 per
cent by prolonged overwork;
but in only 4.5 per cent by a
physical effort.
Preventive measures go
beyond the purely medical
framework and are very lar¬
gely social in character. The
U.S.S.R. has a large network
of treatment centres, spas and
rest homes, organizations for
'physical culture and travel
associations. Special attention
is also given to the improve¬
ment of environmental health,
the promotion of balanced diets
and similar measures.
Physical culture organizations
have a membership of some
50 million, including not only
young people, but many of
middle and even advanced age.
Some eight million persons
come to State centres for
rest, preventive examinations
and treatment
Another institution which
plays an Important part is the
preventorium In Industry. For
a month or a month and a
half, manual and office workers
may spend time there after
work under the supervision of
doctors who test their blood
pressure, carry out laboratory
analyses and prescribe treat¬
ment diets or gymnastics.
In this way, preventive
therapy gymnastics, the im¬
provement of sleeping habits
or of diet can be carried out
without the worker having to
interrupt his job. There are
many such preventoriums in
the U.S.S.R.; at present they
have over 100,000 beds.
We are very much against
the sort of life in which the
individual, after an eight-hour
working day, takes refuge in
trashy books, or stretches out
on a sofa in front of the tele¬
vision set, or sits drinking with
friends.
A passive, sedentary life,
totally lacking in any creative
effort, in physical activity or
intellectual stimulation, is at
the origin of disturbances in
the metabolism of fats and
carbohydrates, and leads to fur¬
ther disturbances in the ner¬
vous system. In this way,
conditions are created for the
development of atherosclerosis,
coronary insufficiency and vas¬
cular spasms.
Sleeping long enough Is an¬
other important point Sleep
should be part of a well-
regulated life, and not the
result of taking sleeping pills.
We attach great importance
to human relationships, to
character formation, and to
education in the widest sense
of the term. The spirit of com¬
radeship, tact discretion, self-
control and respect for others
are not merely moral obliga¬
tions, but are fundamental for
the education of a healthy
generation. They are also
important in the prevention of
cardiovascular diseases.
Education in this sense should
start at school. It is important
that children should be taught
to master their emotions.
In the prevention of heart
diseases, an important role can
be played by health education,
and special scientific research
institutes have been created in
the U.S.S.R. for this purpose.
In conclusion, a word about
heart transplantations. It is
obvious that such operations
illustrate the remarkable possi¬
bilities of modern medicine.
Yet there is no doubt that
heart transplants cannot provide
any broad solution to the prob¬
lem of cardiovascular diseases.
Frankly, I believe that the
search for methods to prevent
atherosclerosis, heart attacks
or high blood pressure offer
greater promise than 100 or
even 1,000 brilliantly successful
heart transplants.
