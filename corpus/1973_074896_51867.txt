GREAT WORLD CIVILIZATIONS
INDUS SUMER EGYPT ANATOLIA
The Indus Valley Civiliz¬
ation (Pakistan) reached
its economic and cultural
zenith between 2500 and
1500 B.C. On this double
page we indicate some of
the great ' civilizations of
Asia, Africa, Europe and
America which also flour¬
ished at the time. It is
interesting to note that,
thanks to the 7000-year-
old tree-ring samples pro¬
vided by the bristle-cone
pine in California, it has
become apparent that
Carbon-14 dating methods
have been consistently
underestimating the dates
of monuments. It is now
thought, for example, that
the megalithic graves of
Brittany, France antedate
the Pyramids by as much
as 2,000 years and that
Stonehenge was being
built in England at about
the same time as a sculp¬
tor in Moenjodaro was
capturing in bronze the
graceful movements of the
young dancer shown
above.

Sargon of Akkad, whose
portrait in bronze (above)
was discovered at Nine¬
veh, became king of Meso¬
potamia in about 2370
B.C. The rich Tigris-
Euphrates valley had al¬
ready been cultivated for
some 2,000 years by the
Sumerlans (their name
derives from the Sumer
valley, in southern Meso¬
potamia). Skilled crafts¬
men, artists and traders,
they established a soph¬
isticated urban civiliz¬
ation which was emulated
by the Akkadians in north¬
ern Mesopotamia. At the
time of Sargon, Meso¬
potamia had trade links
with the Indus valley
cities and with the Medi¬
terranean countries. Cer¬
tain objects, in particular
seals and jewellery, seem
to indicate influences
from the Indus Valley
Civilization. The Meso¬
potamia n pictographic
script, which first ap¬
peared about 3500 B.C.,
was modified over the
centuries to develop into
the cuneiform script (now
deciphered) used through¬
out the Near East until
about 1000 B.C.

During the period of The
Old Kingdom (about 2800-
2200 B.C.) an aristocratic
culture developed in Egypt
under the Pharaohs of the
lllrd, IVth, Vth and Vlth
dynasties which saw a
flowering of the arts and
sciences (in particular
astronomy and medicine).
The great pyramids of
Giza were built during this
period and sculpture was
marked by a finely ex¬
pressed realism. Above,
the kneeling figure of a
high-ranking official, dating
from the Vth dynasty,
today in the Cairo Mu¬
seum. About 6,000 years
ago, Egyptian civilization
was beginning to develop
in Africa along the Nile
valley, in the regions bor¬
dering the Red Sea, in
Sudan and Ethiopia. The
development of papyrus
during the 3rd millenium
B.C. encouraged the
spread of a form of writ¬
ing which developed into
hieroglyphics (deciphered
in 1822). Countless texts
inscribed on stone and
other materials have en¬
abled experts to recon¬
stitute every phase of this
amazing civilization which
retained its distinctive cha¬
racter even during the peri¬
od of Roman occupation.

Shortly after 2000 B.C.
the Hittites established
their capital city Hattusas
(today Bogazkoy, 150 km.
east of Ankara) in the
mountainous region of
Anatolia in central Turkey.
The royal archives of the
Hittites contained thou¬
sands of clay tablets which
have provided detailed
information concerning
Hittite economic, religious
and legislative structures,
the names of kings and
dates of battles and
treaties. Mesopota¬
mian tablets indicate that
a civilization existed in
Anatolia, dating from
3000 B.C., and refer to
the time when Sargon of
Akkad came to the throne
of Mesopotamia, as well
as to a people speaking
the Hatti language who
were later displaced by
the Hittites. The Hittite
empire collapsed under
pressure from neighbour¬
ing peoples and the last
survivors established small
feudal enclaves in Syria
which were finally ab¬
sorbed into the rising
Assyrian empire. Warriors
and legislators rather
than artists, the Hittites,
nevertheless, produced fine
rock-carvings for their
open-air sanctuaries. Skil¬
led metal-workers, they
also fashioned copper or
bronze animal figurines,
such as the stag above.
The stag was a favourite
subject with Hittite artists
and was no doubt a cult
figure.

CHINA AEGEAN SEA IRAN
This striking Chinese
bronze vase is some 3,500
years old. It dates from
the era of the Shang
dynasty (1500 to 1027
B.C.). Many bronze tripod
vases, like the wine vessel
(chia) shown above, or in
other shapes, have been
found on the site of the
Shang capital of An-yang
in the province of Honan.
Most are richly decorated
with extraordinary, intri¬
cate designs and motifs.
The perfection of the
Shang bronzes has never
been equalled. At An¬
yang, archaeologists have
unearthed thousands of
bones inscribed with an¬
cient Chinese characters.
Already at the time of the
Shangs, Chinese civiliza¬
tion had a very long past,
marked by a highly homo¬
geneous cultural tradition,
of which the most ancient
site in the Huang Ho
(Yellow River) plain be¬
came the cradle of Chi¬
nese Bronze Age culture.

The standard text-book
dates of the ancient civili¬
zations of pre-Columbian
America are being pushed
back as a result of the
latest scientific research.
Thus, the Olmecs, usually
said to have flourished in
Mexico from about 800
B.C., are now considered
to be much older as
much as 1500 B.C. and,
according to some autho¬
rities, even older (2000
B.C.). The Olmecs, or
"hule (rubber) people",
established themselves in
the plains bordering the
Gulf of Mexico. Remains
of large mud buildings of
a later period have been
discovered at the great
centres of La Venta, Tres
Zapotes and San Lorenzo-
Tenochtitlan. Among later
Olmec art treasures that
have come down to us
are a number of colossal
heads (carved in imported
stone, some weighing up
to 18 tons) and countless
clay or jade objects and
figurines. The Olmecs
devised a calendar, an
arithmetical system and a
form of hieroglyphic writ¬
ing and their cultural
influence spread through¬
out Mesoamerica (Mexico
and central America).

rine (13 cm. high) modelled

This gold funerary mask
covered the face of a
hero of old buried some
3,600 years ago. It was
discovered at Mycenae, In
the Péloponnèse, Greece,
by the German archaeolo¬
gist Heinrich Schliemann
at the end of the 19th
century. The tombs open¬
ed by Schliemann contain¬
ed fabulous art treasures
gold funerary masks
and ornaments, clay and
bronze vases and wea¬
pons inlaid with gold and
silver. Among them were
objects of Cretan origin
and others made by artists
from mainland Greece.
Mycenaean civilization
was at the height of its
glory in about 1600 B.C.
and its influence extended
to Macedonia, Cyprus,
Syria, Asia Minor and even
to Sicily. Tablets found at
Mycenae and at Knossos,
Crete, inscribed In the
famous "Linear B" script,
contain some of the oldest
known texts in the Greek
language.

This female figurine
(24.5 cm. high) is a fine
example of the terracotta
art of ancient Iran bet¬
ween 2000 and 1000 B.C.
It was discovered at Tur-
eng Tepe, a site in nor¬
thern Iran. Four thousand
years ago, this region
was an Important trading
crossroad linking Mesopo¬
tamia, the Indus valley
and the countries border¬
ing the Caspian Sea. Iran
is the seat of a very
ancient civilization and
from 7000 B.C. settle¬
ments appeared in the
Zagros mountains to the
north of the Persian Gulf.
Tablets with numerical no¬
tations dating from about
3500 B.C. have been
unearthed as well as
later tablets inscribed in
proto-Elamite writing. Bet¬
ween 4000 and 2000 B.C.
Iranian communities, at
Susa, Sialk and Jiyan in
particular, produced paint¬
ed pottery of a remarkable
beauty and finesse.
