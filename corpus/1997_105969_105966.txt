ardens of the Far East
In the early eighteenth cen¬
tury English landscape gar¬
deners began to rebel against the
«traitjacket of French classicism.
They were weary of gardens divided
into symmetrical blocks by rectilin¬
ear paths punctuated with statues
and fountains, gardens where no
plant had a right to grow outside its
appointed place. When the fashion
for informal landscaped gardens
appeared in England, the hand of
Chinese influence was widely felt.
"Everyone knows that English gar¬
dens are nothing more than imita¬
tions of Chinese gardens," wrote
Ceorges Le Rouge in 1774 of the
fashion for what were known as
"Anglo-Chinese" gardens, which
later spread to many parts of Europe.
In point of fart, Chinese influence
went no further than a pagoda or
pavilion placed at the edge of a
stream in the middle of a park.
The gardens of the Ear East are
small enclosed worlds that awaken
the senses and calm the mind. Every¬
thing in them seems designed to

CHINA: ROOMS WITH A VIEW
"In Chinese," writes Antoine Gour-
nay, assistant curator of the Cer-
nusehi Museum in Paris, "the word
yuan (garden) means not so much an
area set apart from built architec¬
ture and mainly used for growing
plants, as a specific way of distrib¬
uting and arranging the space of a
dwelling." lie goes on to say that
"House and garden in China are
more often dovetailed together than
juxtaposed; what's more, the vege¬
tation that decorates this ensemble
is considered as secondary to rocks
and water." The regularity of archi-
by France Bequette
tecture contrasts with the irregu¬
larity of the garden with its twisted
rocks and ponds in a variety of
shapes.
Hocks symbolize mountains, the
place where sky and earth meet.
They are chosen carefully. The more
unusual their shape, the more they
are worth. Their size depends on
their creator's resources and ambi¬
tions. In the 11th century, the
Northern Sung dynasty emperor Ilui
Tsung spent twelve years creating
the Lake of Golden Clarity,
Longevity Mountain (;ï,000 m-) and
Gen Yu rockery ( 1 50 metres high) in
the imperial city of Bian Liang. In
his book Classic Chinese Gardens,
Qiao Yuri tells how the emperor "did
not hesitate to knock down bridges
or destroy roads and canals to trans¬
port these rocks." In China, where
mountains are worshipped (e.g. Knn-
lun shan, the residence of Tai ji, the

"immensely great one"), there are
no gardens without rocks.
Water is as essential as rocks, to
which it is a complement, since
water and rocks are yin and yang.
Sun-drenched, angular and hard,
rocks are yang. Cold and dark but
also free, ¡iure and regenerative,
water is yin. Liu Bang, Gaozu
(founding emperor) of the Han
dynasty in the third century B.C.,
created three artificial islands in Tai
Yi Lake, to symbolize paradise.
From that time on all imperial gar¬
dens used this symbol.
The first private gardens are
recorded in the year 900, the finest
examples being in the city of Suzhou
in Jiangsu province. Many men of let¬
ters went to live in the city in isola¬
tion from the world, and there they
practised gardening and painting on
silk. The format of traditional paint¬
ing on hand scrolls, which is read
cither vertically or horizontally, is
said to correspond perfectly with
the thought processes of the lover of
gardens.
Enclosed by walls, which provide
a neutral background, the Chinese
garden contains buildings for various
leisure activities. The landscape is
arranged according to the rooms from
which it is viewed. ¡No single point
a fiords an overall view. Natural com
positions are framed by open-work,
round, rectangular or fan-shaped win¬
dows, and doors shaped like full
moons or vases. Non-structural walls
are replaced by moveable partitions.
Covered walkways meander through
the garden so that it can be enjojed
in all weathers. The fusion between
the inside and outside areas is
complete.
Galleries, pathways and bridges
shun rectilinearity, for straight lines
are used by evil spirits. Garden design
is regulated by the science known as
fengshui, which literally means "wind
and water" and is expressed via geo-
mancy. For 2,000 y ears it was incon¬
ceivable to build a house without
first consulting a gcomancer. "If you
induce harmony of place," says the
Hook of Rites (Li ji), "then sky and
earth will assume their rightful
places and everything will prosper."
Antoine Gournay explains: "The site,
orientation and shape of buildings
are chosen so as to use to maximum
effect the breaths of the life force
(qiyun) that appear in ibis place, cap¬
ture their beneficial effects and take
precautions against their baneful
influences." The ideal site faces
south, turns its back to a mountain
and is near a stream flowing from
northwest to southeast. The garden
should be entered from the south.

JAPAN: PUTTING THE WORLD IN
ORDER
Japanese garden design is also gov¬
erned by fengshui, and as early as
the sixth century it was drawing
inspiration from Buddhism and Chi¬
nese practices. But Chinese and
Japanese thinking about gardens
went different ways. "By means of
the most ordinary things gardens
enable us to grasp the secret of
nature and its real essence," wrote
Soami, a sixteenth-century monk and
aesthete who wrote a book on gar¬
dens.
"The shadow of the bamboo
sweeps the steps
but not a speck of dust moves.
The moon plunges to the bottom
of the fountain
but the water is unruffled,"
leads an entry in the Zemin Kushu,
an anthology of quotations compiled
in the fifteenth century. The garden
is a place conducive to meditation.
Rigour, purity and asymmetry pre¬
side over its composition. Nothing is
left to chance. Its architecture is as
codified as calligraphy, the tea cer¬
emony or the art of flower arrange¬
ment. In fact gardening was done by
monks, painters or masters of the
tea ceremony until professional hor¬
ticulturists came on the scene. As a
way of putting the world in order, it
expresses a religion or a philosophy
with as much precision as a cathe¬
dral or a treatise. Its size is of no
importance. It can be miniaturized
and even be contained in a small
porcelain cup.
Japanese gardeners were poets
and philosophers. While resting

from their labours, they composed
haiku, 17-sy liable poems celebrating
nature. "The dead leaves flutter
down one on the other. The rain falls
on the rain." Their studies lasted
for u j) to ten years. Their favourite
trees were pine, plum, cherry and
maple. Irises, peonies, azaleas and
chrysanthemums could be used to
add notes of colour. Everything was
arranged according to immutable
principles. A tree, for example,
should never be planted in the cen¬
tre of the garden, for it would resem¬
ble the kumaru ideogram which
means "to have problems". Stones
and jilants must be arranged accord¬
ing to the magical yang odd num¬
bers: three, five or seven.

ceivable in China, appeared around
the middle of the fourteenth cen¬
tury under the influence of Zen phi¬
losophy. To achieve inner illumina¬
tion, satori, the sage creates an inner
void by silently contemplating a rec¬
tangle of raked white sand from
which deeply buried and carefully
placed stones protrude. Waterfalls,
rivers and waves are suggested by
furrows made by the rake. In the
most famous of these gardens, the
Ryoan-ji in Kyoto, which dates from
the Muromachi period (fourteenth
to sixteenth centuries), fifteen rocks
emerge from a lied of white gravel.
The crowds that visit the garden
every day see in it islands, constel¬
lations, clouds or even a tigress with
her cubs.
Later, when the tea ceremony
had been institutionalized, a garden
was designed to provide it with a set¬
ting. This "tea garden" is divided in
two: an inner garden and an outer
garden. The tea house must seem
isolated from the rest of the world.
The tall trees that surround it are
untouched by shears.
In places where hot springs shoot
out of volcanic soil, the garden
designer creates a pond for bathing
and relaxation. In this setting all
kinds of shapes and objects become
symbols. In the garden of the Silver
Pavilion (Ginkaku-ji, fifteenth cen¬
tury) in Kyoto, an ordinary pile of
sand meant for the garden's upkeep
caught the gardener's eye. Shaped
like a truncated cone, its flat top
reflected the moon so well that it
immediately became an altar to the
glory of the moon and a protected
monument. B
