Born in Mexico City, Latin A m e r i c a ’s only Aids 
p revention pro g ramme for street children is ready to 
s h a re its expertise with other countries in the re g i o n
The street is their home. For several thousand
young Mexicans, it is the place where they play,
e at , sleep and when they can, wo r k . For many,
the sex trade is the only way of earning a few pesos.
It is also the most likely way that they will become
infected with HIV.In a few ye a rs time, m a ny of them
will succumb to Aids.
Finding suitable ways to prevent Aids is no
simple task, and even less so when street children
are concern e d . “They are anxious, unstable and
sometimes aggr e s s i ve ,” s ays psychologist Gualbert o
G at i c a . To help tackle the problem, the NGO Casa
A l i a n z a , which has been working in Mexico since
1 9 8 6 , launched its Luna (“Moon”) programme two
ye a rs ago. It is the only Aids prevention campaign
in Latin America designed especially for homeless
children.
Distorted 
knowledge
Luna, a name the infected children conjured
up to evoke light amid darkness, is currently
monitoring 6,180 children and teenagers. Besides
being present on the preventive front, the pro-
gramme also keeps a close check on HIV-positive
children, provides medical treatment for youth
with Aids and psychological counselling for their
friends.
“Since 1997, the number of infected children
has ri s e n , so we ’re focusing on preve n t i o n ,”
explains Nicasio Garcia Lopez, the programme’s
coordinator. “Street children usually know about
sex and Aids, but it’s often distorted knowledge.
Hence the importance of effective prevention.”
Vo l u n t e e rs and teachers from Casa A l i a n z a
comb the capital’s neighbourhoods eve ry day to
p e rsuade boys and girls to go to the organizat i o n ’s
“ s h e l t e r ” where they can attend an hour-long
workshop twice a week called “ H I V / A i d s — W h at
is it?”.With the help of simple, colourful teaching
m at e ri a l s , they learn how the disease spreads and
h ow to protect themselves against it. M a ny chil-
dren are also reached directly on their home
ground—the street.When they go around the city,
Casa A l i a n z a ’s teachers carry games with them
t h at can be set up any w h e r e , all based on ques-
tions and answe rs. A game of darts for example.
Depending on where the children land the dart s
on the board, they must answer different ques-
t i o n s. A n o t h e r , called Marat h o n , is based on an
athletics race. The most popular game, L u n o c a ,i s
like snakes and ladders and provides inform at i o n
about HIV, the immune system and ways to pre-
vent A i d s. Such teaching mat e rial is easy to use
and entirely based on linking ideas and pictures.
A 1996 joint survey by  the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Mexico City
officials found that 13,373 young people under
18 lived and/or worked in the streets of the capi-
tal. Their number grew by 20 per cent between
1992 and 1995—more than 6 per cent a year.
Casa Alianza is also present in the United
S t at e s , C a n a d a , G u at e m a l a , H o n d u r a s , C o s t a
Rica and Nicaragua and is setting up a Luna net-
work in Latin America, based on the methods,
equipment and learning games used in Mexico.
“The idea is to copy the material and come up
with a manual which can be used all over Latin
America to assess the results,” says the program-
me coordinator.
The Mexican headquarters of Casa Alianza
also plans to devise new materials and games,
such as colouring books, picture slides and
puzzles which contain information about HIV.
The organization also responds to frequent
requests to give talks to schools, parishes and
Mexican institutions which care for disadvanta-
ged children. This is perhaps the best evidence
that the Luna programme is shining brightly. n

“Solidarity in Grief” is the title of this manual produced
for teenagers in the Dominican Republic.
