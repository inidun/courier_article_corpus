"We're not doing any research ourselves, but we help
with research atan international level. We don't have any
laboratories ofour own, yet we work with the best labs in
the world. We don't teach, but thanks to us knowledgegets
awmd- ndras Szollosi-Nagy, head
of Unesco's International
Hydrological Programme
(IHP), wants to avoid any
misunderstanding: even
though he is trained as a
scientist and his work deals
.with science, he is first and
foremost a "scientific manager". A
term that applies as well to his col¬
leagues working for the other three
international scientific programmes
at Unesco: the Man and the Bio¬
sphere Programme (MAB), the
Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission (IOC), and the Inter¬
national Geological Correlation Pro¬
gramme (IGCP).
"We achieve a worldwide synergy
of local research," says MAB Direc¬
tor Berndt Von Droste. Synergy is
the key word in the role played by
Unesco with these programmes.
They offer (but do not impose) pro¬
cedures on which scientists in dis¬
tant labs can rely to work effectively
as a global team. These procedures
thus help researchers in prioritizing
their activities on a worldwide scale,
in dividing up tasks according to
each team's strengths, and in co¬
ordinating the projects, making
information and results available
to all. In diplomatic jargon, this is
"international intellectual co-oper¬
ation." For Szollosi-Nagy, it is more
simply a way to "put together all
the pieces of the puzzle and get a
global picture."
Going global
With the worldwide impact of
environmental problems such as
pollution, the greenhouse effect,
climatic changes, and urbanization,
the concept ofworking together on
a global scale seems obvious today.
At the time when Unesco's interna¬
tional programmes got under way,
however, this idea had little weight.
In particular, the South was then
kept out of major developments,
most of the research capacity being
concentrated in the North. One of
the great merits of Unesco's pro¬
grammes lies in links built between
North and South and, little bylittle,
between South and South by
adding Third World scientists to
their endeavours, by helping in the
development of science in the
South, and especially by making
significant efforts in local training.
Innovating in new fields went
along with this extended geo¬
graphical reach: MAB, the IOC, the
IHP and the IGCP have been pio¬
neers in the study of tropical eco¬
systems, which were previously
little known even though three-
quarters of the world's population
live in the tropics. Similar ground¬
breaking studies are carried out in
desert areas, and on the relation¬
ships between the environment and
cities swollen by rural migration.
Indeed, Unesco's four major scien¬
tific programmes do not conduct
research for its own sake, be it on
the biosphere (MAB), the ocean
(IOC), fresh waters (IHP), or the
Earth's crust (IGCP), but rather with
the aim of improving humanity's
condition. Their interdisciplinary
42
character is emphasized further by
Unesco's mandate, integrating
science, education and culture.
Thus Unesco has played a leading
role in putting the concept of sus¬
tainable development forward in
international forums. -
The programmes have proved
successful. For example, more than
four out of five laboratories
throughout the world dealing with
issues concerning water co-opera¬
te with IHP, and the ratio is one out
of two in cases involving MAB or
IOC. But should this success be
taken for granted? Revolutionary as
such programmes may have been
twenty or thirty years ago, might
they not become outdated, even
superfluous?
Their budgets are extremely
modest compared to what is at
stake: Unesco provides them with
about $5 million a year, to which is
added about $25 million in volun¬
tary contributions from other orga¬
nizations and Member States. Yet
their worldwide scope is an asset
that no other network holds.
For the programme Directors, as
with the International Council
of Scientific Unions the largest
non-governmental body in this
field their intergovernmental char¬
acter is their "main strength", an
irreplaceable feature that "connects
the scientific engine with the poli¬
tical machine." But intergovern¬
mental means heavy bureaucracy,
making it at the same time an
obvious weakness.
The fact that many others have
now followed the lead set by
Unesco's programmes is a welcome
development. Faced with today's
environmental crisis, should inter¬
national networks not forge new eco¬
logical alliances, each focussing on
what they can do best, and
thereby ensuring greater efficiency?
Are interdisciplinary methods suf¬
ficiently established and validated
within and among these pro¬
grammes, or adequately tied to social
sciences, culture, and education?
Now that the Earth Summit is over,
the question is how these pro¬
grammes should evolve to embrace
the "revolution" needed in all our
institutions to confront the deg¬
radation ofour environment.
