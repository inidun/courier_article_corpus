Among the well-dressed unive rsity students
mingling just outside the gates of Shanghai’s
p r e s t i gious Fudan Unive rs i t y, three men stand
o u t . Dressed in surplus army uniform s , they  perch
on the curb behind small cardboard signs stuck in
p avement cracks.The crude signs adve rtising their
labour for odd jobs or construction work can be has-
tily snatched up and hidden should the police make
a sudden appearance.
The men, m i grants in their 20s and 30s from the
nearby city of Suzhou, n e ver know when they might
h ave to make a quick get-away. U n e m p l oyed for the
past month and flat broke, they have n ’t paid the tem-
p o r a ry residence permit fee, which makes them
subject to possible eviction from Shanghai.
“ We don’t have much money for any t h i n g, i n c l u-
ding the 15 RMB1 (US$1.75) for the monthly per-
m i t s , so it’s better if we stay clear of the police,” s ay s
the eldest of the three.
A steady
stream of manpower
Te m p o r a ry residents, the so-called “ f l o at i n g ”
p o p u l at i o n , are eve rywhere in China’s richest city.O n
b i cycle and afoot they stream through the city, ri n gi n g
bells and shouting out offers to sharpen knive s , s e l l
f ruit and vegetables from their carts or haul away old
junk and garbage. Like the three men from Suzhou,
they are ready to do almost any t h i n g, p r ovided it will
keep them in China’s city of opport u n i t y.
Such is the allure of Shanghai that an estimat e d
3.3 million of its 13.6 million population are migr a n t s.
Thanks to a thriving economy propelled not only by
economic reform but also an ambitious national policy
to transform Shanghai into a major Asian fin a n c i a l
c e n t r e , the city has turned into a huge constru c t i o n
s i t e .M i grants have filled the need for sheer manpowe r.
But for the most populous city in the wo r l d ’s most
populous country, the massive migrant populat i o n
b rings new problems, from huge strains on
i n f r a s t ructure to an exacerbation of a widening social
chasm between the haves and the have - n o t s.
China is going through “ u r b a n i z ation of a scale
n e ver seen before in its history,” s ays Wu We i p i n g, a
n at i ve of Shanghai who teaches Urban Studies and
Planning at the V i r ginia Commonwealth Unive rs i t y
in the United Stat e s.Already some 30 per cent of the
c o u n t ry ’s 1.3 billion people live in the cities.T h at
p r o p o rtion is likely to reach 50 per cent in the not-
too-distant future, according to Wu .
In a wo r d , the challenge is of truly epic
p r o p o rt i o n s. But so far Shanghai does at least seem
to be ave rting many of the wo rst problems of urban
swell common in other developing countri e s.T h e n
a g a i n , not eve ry city in the world has at its disposal
the tool that has been a  key to Shanghai’s qualifie d
s u c c e s s : a set of controls perhaps only possible under
a system of authoritarian government.
“China is one of the few places where there is a
d e l i b e r ate gove rnment policy that addresses
u r b a n i z at i o n ,” s ays Wu . One solution has been to
encourage the gr owth of small and medium-sized
cities around the country to take some of the
d e m o graphic pressure off the largest city.The other
pillar of the urbanization policy is to control migr a n t
p o p u l ations once they have reached a city. It is in
this latter area that Shanghai has shown its skill.
M i grants started making their mark on cities
soon after they were first allowed to move there in
1 9 7 8 , the beginning of China’s economic reform
p r o gr a m m e . Control on mobility was effected
through the hukou, or place-of-origin system.One
had to remain in one’s place of ori gin unless gr a n t e d
p e rmission to move . A p a rt from being illegal,
m i gr ation without official approval made life quite
literally unliva b l e : without the appropri ate h u k o u
card one was denied access to essentials such as
ration tickets for rice,meat and cotton cloth.
But the former constraints on migr ation we r e
a r b i t r a ry, imposed from the top dow n , and we r e
c e rtainly not compatible with the market economy
t h at was to develop after the Cultural Revo l u t i o n .
As the economy exploded, jobs opened up for
unskilled labourers ,p a rticularly in coastal areas
where most of the foreign and domestic inve s t m e n t
has poured in. In response, the authorities have
encouraged migr ation to bring in cheap labour.
M e a n w h i l e , higher crop yields and rising populat i o n
on a dwindling arable land mass have left the
c o u n t ryside with at least 100 million surp l u s1.The Chinese currency is called Renminbi (RMB).

labourers.
The hukou card system is still in place, but cities
like Shanghai today also issue temporary perm i t s
to accommodate migr a n t s.The temporary perm i t
system gi ves the gove rnment the best of both wo r l d s :
flexibility and a relatively strong level of control.
M i grants must first get permission from their
local gove rnment back home to work away from
their area of ori gi n . Upon arri va l , the fort u n ate stay
with family or friends from back home, while others
sleep rough as the authorities provide no
accommodation for transients.
Should they want to stay more than three days,
m i grants are required to get a three-month residence
r e gi s t r at i o n , which can then be extended for a two -
year permit issued by an enterp rise or local police
s t at i o n . Pe rmits are granted only upon proof of legal
a c c o m m o d ation in the city and of employ m e n t .O n
top of this, m i grants need to apply for an urban
e m p l oyment perm i t , r e n e wable yearly for a fee
e q u i valent to $8.40. Unlike blue- or white-collar
e m p l oye e s , street ve n d o rs and small retailers apply
for business licences instead of employment perm i t s.
Only after they have managed to make it through
all these bu r e a u c r atic check points are migr a n t s
legally allowed to remain in the city.
The temporary permit system means that in times
of economic dow n t u rn—such as that which has left
the three Suzhou men jobless for about three-quart e rs
of the past year—the authorities have some leve r a g e
to force migrants to go back to their homes. A n
e s t i m ated one in four of Shanghai’s float i n g
p o p u l ation doesn’t bother to register with the
a u t h o ri t i e s.
I g n o ring the law seems to be much easier than it
wa s ,c e rtainly in the pre-economic reform era. S o
much of the economy is now pri vate that one is not
n e c e s s a rily forced into contact with the stat e .At the
same time, the success of economic liberalizat i o n
means that food and other basic goods are so abu n d a n t
t h at ration coupons are no longer needed—again,
reducing reliance on state organs.A l s o, the numbers of
m i grants are so huge that it is impossible for the police
and other authorities to keep tabs on them all.
It is possible for migrants to achieve long-term
r e s i d e n cy, but the hurdles are substantial and ensure

granted only to the well educat e d ; or marry a local,
which requires overcoming the considerable

prejudice of the snobbish Shanghainese who showe r
disdain upon the floating population.
But while the state keeps close watch on migr a n t s ,i t
also intervenes to make sure they have at least the basics
of surv i va l .T h at help is motivated not only by a sense
of charity or social duty: the last thing the state wa n t s
is for social problems to fester and explode into mass
m ovements potentially challenging the political order.
Life for migr a n t s , while in many ways difficult, i s
n e ve rtheless not impossible. For example, on the city’s
n o rt h e a s t e rn outskirts at the long-abandoned Jiangwa n
a i rp o rt , sits a temporary residents’ camp sanctioned by
the municpal gove rnment three ye a rs ago. T h e
community is anything but fa n cy, and life here pales in
c o m p a rison with that of the middle classes and
especially the small, but visible class of new rich who
have made it to the top through a mixture of contacts,
s avvy and privileged position. N e ve rtheless Jiangwa n
is relat i vely clean and orderly—a far cry from squat t e rs ’
communities found in the wo rst slums of other
developing countries.
The site, home to 500 fa m i l i e s , includes a
ru d i m e n t a ry health dispensary, a few wo r k s h o p s , t i ny
fa c t o ri e s , small stores, a clutch of hairdressers ,
ramshackle places to eat , market gardens and a host of
other small bu s i n e s s e s.Young children proudly lead the
way to a school which, while ru d i m e n t a ry, does have a
t e l e v i s i o n , a stereo and wall maps of the wo r l d , and is
probably no different from thousands of other
e l e m e n t a ry schools in poorer parts of the country.T h e
t e a c h e rs , mainly in their early 20s, come from the same
p r ovinces as the migrants and thus share a common
d i a l e c t .The children themselves seem cheerful and
o u t g o i n g, and are all properly shod and healthy
looking—apparently enjoying the same sort of
parental attention that China’s one-child fa m i l y
planning policy has inadve rtently ensured for today ’s
youth.
The majority of the adults, who come from
nearby provinces such as Jiangsu as well as poorer,
hinterland provinces including Henan, A n h u i ,S z e-
chuan, leave the camp to work each day in nearby
Shanghai and its environs.To do so they must pass
through the gates of the compound under the occa-
sionally watchful eye of the gat e k e e p e rs , most of
whom are laid off wo r k e rs from state enterp ri s e s
and all of whom are bona fide Shanghai residents.
Second-class
citizens
Like other such camps, Jiangwan is under the
j u risdiction of the local district committee, which is
responsible for ensuring the residents are regi s-
tered, taxes and temporary residency permits are
paid,and security is maintained.
Each family pays approx i m ately $70 to the pri vat e
landlords who built and own the rows of houses
where it and its neighbours live . In a country where
the state has traditionally pr ovided housing for
nominal amounts of money, these rents are very
e x p e n s i ve .L i k e w i s e , the half-yearly tuition of about
$50 is fairly onerous. Yet migrants don’t seem to
complain much, perhaps because overall life in the
city is better or more promising than that back at
home.
A p a rt from the temporary permit system, t h e r e
are a number of factors which help the municipa-
lity manage the floating population issue, not the
least of which is the city’s policy of grassroots mana-
g e m e n t . In a pyramid-shaped organizational stru c-
ture with the city at the apex, the district just below,
the street next and the neighbourhood forming the
wide base, the city has found a way of keeping local
involvement high.
Through this last level of gove rn m e n t , the neigh-
bourhood committee,the authorities oversee day-
t o - d ay contact with the transient populat i o n .O n c e
k n own for being composed of busybodies who
interfered at every opportunity in people’s lives—
denouncing and ensuring punishment of eve ry-
thing from extramarital affairs to even mild forms
of political or even social dissent—the committees
have been professionalized in recent years.Where
once they were usually composed of retired people,
n ow they are manned by paid staff, usually dis-
placed state employees who have been specially
trained,notes Wu. Instead of being seen largely as
an instrument of interference in people’s private
l i ve s , the committees nowa d ays concern themselve s
with practical,everyday affairs.
Wu believes this approach is miles from central
planning-type d i k t at ,a remarkably efficient form of
maintaining control while answe ring genuine needs
for social serv i c e . As the population under any one

resident committee rarely exceeds 2,000 people, t h e
organization is characterized by a strong sense of
familiarity.
Another tool for managing migrants is urgi n g
e m p l oye rs to provide housing for their staff.Wu esti-
m ates that 36 per cent of migrants in Shanghai live at
or close to their place of work and that nearly half of
all rural labour migrants live in housing provided by
urban enterp ri s e s.Two-thirds of those listing constru c-
tion as their occupation live at construction sites.
But while migrants may fare better here than in
other parts of the developing world, there is little
doubt that they in effect do not enjoy the same
status as Shanghainese.Migrants are second-class
citizens, grudgingly accepted for their labour but
mistrusted because of the stresses they add to the
c i t y ’s infrastru c t u r e . Other residents of Shanghai are
often subsidized for the cost of their children’s e-
d u c ation by their employe rs or the gove rn m e n t .
The same goes for medical serv i c e s. Not so the
t e m p o r a ry residents, who must pay the full cost
should medical treatment be necessary. And their
children,many of whom are born in Shanghai, are
destined to be forever locked on the outside looking
i n . M i grant children are unlikely to mingle with
their Shanghainese peers. A Shanghainese parent
would be distraught if his child married a migr a n t —
which is not all that likely any way as the two wo r l d s
a r e , for all the physical prox i m i t y, culturally leagues
a p a rt , difference of dialect being just one of the
many factors. Besides, there is a big price to pay:
when a Shanghainese man marries a migr a n t
woman,their child inherits her place of orgin.
Pa rt of the disdain comes from the sheer lack of
s o p h i s t i c ation of the migrants in terms of dialect and
d e m e a n o u r , and their misplaced expectat i o n s. Fo r
example, male economic migrants typically buy a
suit before hitting the big city in hopes of landing a
desk job.They often end up we a ring the suits—the
labels still stitched to the sleeves—not in fa n cy
o f fice blocks, but on construction sites. A n o t h e r
cause for animosity is that problems such as rising
crime are attributed to migrants.
One does not have to look very far for signs of
contempt or discri m i n at i o n . Outside a high school
in downtown Shanghai—gleaming with new buil-
dings and proud of its new sports stadiums, e x p r e s s-
ways and a metro system, all built by migrants—a
policeman on a motorcycle is checking the papers
of a migrant worker who has been selling brightly
coloured shoelaces to the students. Not even dei-
gning to get off his bike, the policeman speaks
sharply to the middle-aged woman.
Distraught and crying she pleads her case to
the uniformed figure of  authority who snaps closed
his notepad and speeds off down the street.
Still weeping , the woman gathers her meagre
goods and begins walking away, watched by a small
c r owd of Shanghai residents. Where she’ll go is
anyone’s guess. n
