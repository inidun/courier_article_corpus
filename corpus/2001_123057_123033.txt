K
o o v a g a m , in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu,
has attracted the limelight in recent years—
thanks to A i d s.The village is the traditional
seat of chitirai pournami, an ancient
transsexual festival marking the anniversary
when Lord K r i s h n a is believed to have taken on the
form of a maiden to enjoy sexual bliss with A r a v a n, a
P a n d a v ap r i n c e.
For centuries, the festival has been celebrated on
a full moon day in April and is patronized by urban and
rural folk and hijras (transsexuals and eunuchs) from
across India.In the last three years, Aids prevention
organizations from Chennai have stepped in to confer
“new respectability” to this expression of alternate
sexuality by organizing an annual beauty contest for the
“third gender.”“ We want people to realize that h i j r a s
are as much a part of society as anyone else,and use the
opportunity to provide Aids information and
c o n d o m s,”says Dr. Manorama Pinagapany, director of
a community health NGO.
While the local media has become more daring
about promoting “new lifestyles,” Indians are generally
considered  “conservative and orthodox” in sexual
m a t t e r s. There is an irony in this: it was after all in
countries like India that various sexual cultures claimed
their natural place in society from time immemorial.
Hindu culture views the physical body as a
container of the soul,a divine but transient abode of
the spirit. The body is revered because  it houses the
S e l f, the life-force. The Kama Sutra, the ancient Hindu
treatise on sex by Va t s y a y a n a, notes that kama ( s e x u a l
desire) is one of the means to attain m o k s h a
( s a l v a t i o n ) . These primeval thoughts still pulsate
through the subcontinent. The S h i v a l i n g a , a phallic
symbol of the deity Shiva in sexual union with his
c o n s o r t , goddess Parvati, is worshipped all over India.
Lord Rama and his wife Seetha may be glorified for
their sense of duty and fid e l i t y,but India is also the land
of Krishna, celebrated for his dalliances with celestial
beauties.
Temple sculptures of Hindu deities seek neither to
conceal any body parts nor even censor their
p r o p o r t i o n s. Depictions of Hindu gods and goddesses
are usually of graceful,sensual proportions, the men

I n d i a ’s wings of desire
Hindu civilization glorified the sensual body and gave the world a famed
treatise of physical love. While the advent of Aids was first met
with intolerance, traditional practices are regaining right of place
1 . S H ATTERED IDEALS
The Media Foundation, an Indian NGO, has found a new vocation for the sculptures of the Khajuraho

long limbed and athletic, the women with slim waists
and fulsome bodies. Stone figurines of divinities and
mortals at the 10th century Khajuraho temples in
Madhya Pradesh depict a variety of sexual unions,
almost in clinical fashion.
The unabashed honesty of the nudity that embel-
lishes almost every Hindu temple divests the body of
crude eroticism,raising it to a near ethereal plane in
Hindu consciousness. The average Hindu was
conditioned to accept the body and sexuality as natural
aspects of the cycle of birth and death.
Cultures driven 
underground
Sexual openness was an ordinary aspect of
everyday life, as temples also served as centres for
social interaction.An assortment of sexual orientations
were an integral part of traditional Hindu societies.
Transsexual courtesans, dancers of the d e v a d a s i
t r a d i t i o n , street dancers, singers and musicians offered
pleasure and sensual fulfil l m e n t . Multiple partner sex,
bisexuality and other so-called sexually “ d e v i a n t ”
cultures were never explicitly disowned but instead,
had their own social, religious and artistic space within
mainstream society.
Sex work, for example was conferred religious
respectability in the culture of the devadasi s e c t .Th e s e
women were given in marriage to God and
ritualistically dedicated themselves to fulfilling the
sexual needs of society. They lived in or around the
temples and enjoyed considerable respect.
Indian civilization allowed for a diversity of
perceptions, lifestyles and values to the extreme and
was non-judgemental almost to a fault. Yet there
appears to have been a method to this madness:
complex social and spiritual systems had evolved,
allowing for a certain unity in diversity, a harmonious
co-existence.
Hindu cultures came under pressure from
Buddhist and Jain teachings that advocated physical
and sexual renunciation. During the Mughal rule of the
subcontinent (1556-1707), sexuality was put under
purdah (veil) and women further withdrew from the
public domain. Colonization by the British and
subsequent missionary efforts at “ c i v i l i z i n g ” t h e
sexually “exotic natives” deepened the departure
from uninhibited sexual mores. Victorian prudery
and double standards were added to this conundrum.
Indian sexuality, which had enjoyed abundant
expression in the public domain for centuries, s u d d e n l y
found itself choked. Caught between many worlds, i t s
natural growth became warped: hypocrisy, denial of
one’s roots and the self, fueled by a sense of shame,
began to gain momentum.Aping the culture of the
colonizers to gratify them led to a situation where
traditions were disowned.
The year 1947 saw the birth of an independent
I n d i a . The spawning of an English-speaking,
westernized Indian minority, which had internalized
many of Britain’s missionary values, now ruled as the
country’s political elite, setting new moral standards,
codifying what kinds of sex and between whom was
permissible by law.The d e v a d a s i t r a d i t i o n , for instance,
was criminalized and legally banned.
The upshot was a burgeoning culture of clandestine
sexuality, lurking in respectable neighbourhoods, the
dark by-lanes of towns and the deserted corridors of
t e m p l e s. It was into such an environment of sexual
hypocrisy and repression that the HIV virus made its
unfettered entry.
A foreigner’s
disease
When the first cases of  infection were detected in
India,the government responded by passing an HIV
quarantine law. The illness was perceived as a
f o r e i g n e r ’s disease from the “immoral and excessively
p e r m i s s i v e ”We s t .Some government officials called for
the repatriation of African students and a ban on sex
with foreigners. The government also made public
appeals for a return to the nation’s “pristine”values,
offered to pay sex workers to retire, or at least to
tattoo HIV-positive ones to forewarn clients.
The world is now twenty years into the A i d s
e x p e r i e n c e,with Asia stealing the spotlight during the
second decade. Until it was recently overtaken by
South A f r i c a , India had the largest HIV positive
population in the world—–about 3.86 million.
Available reports indicate that the epidemic remains
concentrated among groups like sex workers and drug
users. By the mid-1990s, more than 25 percent of sex
workers in Indian cities had tested positive for HIV. I n
M u m b a i , the prevalence rate among them had reached
71 percent in 1997. Interviews with HIV- p o s i t i v e
women in India revealed that despite public

Reconnecting with a sensual past.

information campaigns, women only learned about
the importance of condom use after they had become
i n f e c t e d .While gender inequality can be fatal as far as
Aids is concerned, the reality in several Asian countries
is that women remain largely uneducated and exploited
at home and in the fie l d s. They know little about
protecting themselves from HIV, or negotiating
condom use with their husbands or sexual partners.
Sex workers
in the open
But there is another side to the coin: Aids has
been the single most significant factor that helped
traditional sexual practices and orientations to at least
partially regain their rightful place in the public
d o m a i n .I r o n i c a l l y, this too is the result of international
p r e s s u r e s.Prostitution and homosexuality, it now turns
o u t , must be de-criminalized and women given the
right to safer sex in the age of A i d s. Sexuality must now
be redeemed from its underground sanctuary. P e o p l e
of different sexual orientations must be rehabilitated
into mainstream society, destigmatized and even re-
c h r i s t e n e d . With the arrival of A i d s, the circle is
c o m p l e t e, and the d e v a d a s i has re-emerged in her new
avatar of “sex-worker.”
Sex education is donor- d r i v e n , funded and
f a s h i o n a b l e. Sex is not a dirty word any more, just like
the good old days, centuries ago, when we took our
children to the temples where the most graphic details
of all forms of sexual practices were aesthetically
signified in stone, where grandmothers told tales to
their grandchildren about sexuality with utmost
r e v e r e n c e.The difference in this era of Aids is, h a v i n g
come the full circle,we sadly discover that we have lost
the natural ease, grace and élan that came
spontaneously in the distant past.There is a visible self
consciousness attached to public perception and
expressions of the human body.
After more than a decade of A i d s, the sheer
magnitude of the threat to human lives is finally
blowing away the layers of hypocrisy and painting a
brave new assertive face on Indian sexuality and the
b o d y.C a l c u t t a , which has A s i a ’s largest red light district,
S o n a g a c h i, is home to the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya
Committee —a forum of 60,000 sex workers and their
children.
The founding members, all sex workers, c a m e
together through their active involvement as peer
educators in an STD/HIV prevention intervention
programme. “We have been successfully networking
among sex workers in India and some other countries,
particularly in South and Southeast Asia,to promote
and protect our rights,” claims the forum’s
s p o k e s p e r s o n . “Our political objectives are
decriminalization of adult prostitution and securing
social recognition of sex work as a valid profession ”
How has the literate middle class and the polity
responded to the Aids epidemic? According to psycho-
analyst and author Dr.Sudhir Kakar,“sexual attitudes
have changed much less than what the media portrays.
Sexuality is still not seen as freedom of the psyche
and body.It is still surrounded by feelings of shame and
g u i l t .” Although middle class women have become
more vocally aware of their bodies, says Kakar,
sexuality can be very subversive for family stability.
“One believes that for family stability one has to be
sexually conservative.”The deep bonding within Indian
families is ensuring that people with Aids are largely
not being left to their own devices,although a husband
with the illness is more likely to be looked after by his
family than his wife.
People with HIV, irrespective of caste or class, a r e
subjected to considerable social ostracism. Th e
stigma can go to extremes: in 1989, a young HIV-
positive man in Goa was isolated and incarcerated
for having a “contagion that was dangerous to public
h e a l t h .” A decade later, a man rumoured to be
infected with HIV and supposedly attacking
residents of a Chennai suburb
with a needle contaminated with
his own blood, led to a hysterical
mob burning him alive.
Sitcoms vs 
morality
Even explicit HIV prevention
education attracted censors in
some Indian states. In June 2000,
two members of an Aids Service
Organization working in a village
in northern India were arrested
and jailed for having distributed
graphically explicit material on
HIV prevention.The couple had to
remain in custody on charges that
they had attempted to corrupt the
morals of society under the guise
of Aids education. A year later,
women in Bhopal (Madhya
P r a d e s h ) , publicly burnt HIV
prevention leaflets containing
graphic depictions of how to use
c o n d o m s, spurred on by a sense of
moral outrage.
With the opening up of the
Indian economy in the early 1990s,
American television serials
regularly flood urban middle-class
drawing rooms with sex and semi-
n u d i t y. Sexual talk is in vogue
among young,mostly urban Indians, but the emphasis
on virginity until marriage is still the norm,says Kakar,
especially among women  
Modernity and traditions are colliding under the
onslaught of globalization.Primordial beliefs, values
and norms are now awash with science, technology and
w e s t e r n i z a t i o n . Perceptions of the body and sexuality
are less self-conscious and the wheel seems to have

Straight talk.
