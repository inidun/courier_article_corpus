Such may be the future fate of the more
than 500 civilian nuclear power reactors
built in the second half of the twe n t i e t h
century.
In nearly all industries, the disposal of
a n t i q u ated plants and equipment is a
s t r a i g h t f o r ward and relat i vely low-cost ope-
r at i o n . But the high levels of radiation pre-
sent in retired facilities make it extremely
complex and costly for nuclear powe r.U p o n

Dismantling: the nuts and bolts
The basic “deconstruction” of a nuclear plant takes place in a three-step process, the guidelines of
which have been established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These phases consist
of removing the fuel and auxiliary structures;ensuring safe confinement of remaining radioactive struc-
tures and components;and finally taking the plant apart and removing it from the site.
The first job is to empty the reactor core of its fuel and to remove it from the site. In the second phase,
all remaining radioactive materials are confined and sealed; the result is sometimes referred to as “ s a f e -
s t o r e ” . If left in place for 30 to 100 years, slightly contaminated materials such as metals and concrete will
lose much of their ra d i o a c t i v i t y. The third phase involves removing all elements from the site and making
it usable for other purposes.
Because appropriate national infrastructures do not yet exist in many countries, operators have
often opted to postpone final dismantling until approved solutions for waste disposal are available.
Another reason to opt for deferred dismantling is the cost-benefit (see article). In the case of Britain’s
Magnox Electric,for example, which has adopted a 135-year safe-storage strategy, the fact that decom-
missioning costs are discounted over 135 years lightens the company’s books today. n
awaiting eventual dismantling and isola-
tion from humans and the biosphere.
Although it is unlikely that a scenario such
as that envisioned above will occur, the fa c t
remains that human societies have yet to
d e t e rmine just what will happen with retired
nuclear power plants.
François Chenevier, the director of the
French nuclear waste agency, admonished in
1990 that “it would be irresponsible for us to
b e n e fit from nuclear power and leave it to
l ater generations to deal with the wa s t e .”Ye t
t h at situation had already occurr e d , and will
likely continue into the next three or so
d e c a d e s. Although nuclear reactors are
expected to operate for between 30 and 40
ye a rs , their radioactive legacy — i n c l u d i n g
the physical structure of retired reactors — w i l l
remain for thousands of ye a rs.
The problem of what to do with shut-
tered reactors is gr owing steadily.As of the
b e ginning of 1999, 94 nuclear reactors had
been retired. At the same time, only 429
r e a c t o rs were in operat i o n , meaning that one
out of eve ry 5.5 reactors that has ever been
built has already been permanently closed.
Yet only a handful of these have actually
been taken apart.
This lack of progress in decommissio-
ning reactors is partly planned. Some coun-
t ri e s , such as Japan and the United Stat e s ,h ave
announced policies that would have them
dismantle closed reactors within a decade or
t wo of closure. Other countri e s , such as
Canada and France, intend to wait seve r a l
d e c a d e s.At the extreme, the United Kingdom
has decided to wait more than 100 ye a rs
before finally tearing down any reactors at all.
T h u s , old reactors could become a near per-
manent fixture in some countri e s.
The irony in tearing down nuclear
p ower plants is that the longer they ru n ,t h e
more radioactive their interi o rs get from
neutron bombardment. And the higher the
r a d i o a c t i v i t y, the more diffic u l t ,d a n g e r o u s ,
and expensive it is to dismantle the plants,
and store or bury the residual radioactive
wa s t e .T h u s , waiting decades or longer bet-
ween closing reactors and actually tearing
them down makes the task that much easier
and safer to undertake.

S t i l l , the radioactivity of the actual bu i l-
d i n g s — p a rticularly the reactor’s core ve s s e l
in which the nuclear reaction takes place—
will last for hundreds of thousands of ye a rs.
The radioactive substance nickel 59, f o r
example, is found in the reactor’s core, an
area that has experienced the heavy bom-
bardment of neutrons from fission’s chain
reactions. Nickel 59 has a radioactive half-
life of 80,000 years, meaning that it takes
roughly a million ye a rs before it is safe.
Current plans are to bury the waste,isola-
ting it from humans and the biosphere until
it becomes harm l e s s. H owe ve r , no country
has yet taken political action on just where
it will bury these materials.
Some scientists assure the public that
the problem of radioactive waste can be
s o l ved through such bu ri a l , although others
debate whether it can be “solved” in the
n o rmal fashion at all.Waste cannot be des-
troyed, nor can scientists prove that it will
s t ay out of the biosphere if bu ri e d . Proof of
a hy p o t h e s i s , via the scientific method,
requires demonstrat i o n .Yet with radioactive
waste,such proof would require hundreds
of human generations and entail extensive
ri s k s. C ri t i c s , from abori ginal people to
scientists, have often noted the presump-
tuousness of our civilizat i o n ’s willingness to
reach forward in time,borrowing from the
future that which we can never repay. To
leave a legacy that does not merely impo-
verish future life but may endanger it for
millennia to come, constitutes an act of
unprecedented irresponsibility.
Ignoring
early warnings
Politicians traditionally have been reluc-
tant to tackle an issue that will not come to
the forefront until after their political careers
have ended.Indeed,both government and
i n d u s t ry have long ignored wa rnings about
r a d i o a c t i ve wa s t e s , including the problem of
decommissioning nuclear power facilities.
In 1951, H a rvard Unive rsity president
James B. C o n a n t , f o rmer administrator of

the wa rtime Manhattan Project to deve l o p
a nuclear bomb, spoke publicly of wastes that
would last for generat i o n s. In 1957, a U. S .
N ational A c a d e my of Sciences panel cau-
tioned that “unlike the disposal of any other
type of wa s t e , the hazard related to radio-
a c t i ve wastes is so gr e at that no element of
doubt should be allowed to exist regarding
s a f e t y.” In 1960, another A c a d e my com-
mittee urged that the waste issue be resolve d
before licensing new nuclear fa c i l i t i e s.
Such recommendations fell on deaf
e a rs , and one country after another plunged
ahead with building nuclear power plants.
G ove rnment bu r e a u c r ats and industry spo-
kespeople assured the public that decom-
missioning and nuclear waste could be dealt
with, yet few resources were dedicated to
these issues.Working with radioactive wa s t e
was “not glamorous . . . nobody got brow n i e
points for caring about nuclear wa s t e ,”
according to Carroll Wilson, first general
manager of the U.S.Atomic Energy Com-
mission. So the issue was figuratively, and
almost literally, swept under the rug until the
late 1970s when safety problems and acci-
d e n t s , questions about health effects, s o a ri n g
c o s t s , and eroding public confidence slowe d
reactor construction.
Still, most people probably believe to
this day that the problem of dismantling
retired reactors and disposing of their wa s t e s
is not an issue to be concerned with.That
may be true, but even if an engineering or
social solution, such as a nuclear pri e s thood

t h at will protect the biosphere, is found,
there remains a huge, unpaid bill for achie-
ving it.
Despite some early real experience with
the cost of decommissioning plants, it still
remains uncertain just what those costs will
be—and who will pay. E s t i m ates of the dis-
mantling cost have ranged from 10 per cent
of the initial capital investment to 40 per
c e n t , and even 100 per cent. This trans-
l ates into costs ranging from $50 million to
more than $3 billion for a large reactor.
Who’s going to pay,
and how much?
In fact, one smaller reactor, the 167-
megawatt Yankee Rowe of Massachusetts,
which cost $186 million (1993$) to build in
1960 ended up having a dismantling bill of
more than $350 million three decades lat e r.
Indeed, if governments and utilities have
had a difficult time justifying the cost of
building and operating reactors , c l o s i n g
them could be an even harder sell.
In the United Kingdom, the gove rn-
m e n t - owned utility insisted for ye a rs that the
cost of tearing down redundant plants
would be relatively small. Then, in 1989,
when the gove rnment was in the process of
a failed attempt to privatize the country’s
nuclear industry, the utility admitted that
the decommissioning cost was roughly four
times that it had previously stated.
S i m i l a r l y, though most countries require
their operat o rs to collect funds for decom-
missioning during a reactor’s operat i o n ,
most of these funds consist of only “book-
k e e p i n g ”f u n d s.T h at is, the utility credits a
decommissioning fund with money, bu t
the actual cash is spent on other activities.
Thus, there is no guarantee that when the
utility actually needs the money for decom-
m i s s i o n i n g, it will have it.Yet even with sys-
tems that require actual cash reserves to be
c r e ated shortages can easily mount, if reac-
t o rs are shut down before the end of their ori-
ginal expected lifespan,as has been more the
rule than the exception with the nearly 100
r e a c t o rs now permanently closed.
In fa c t , the early retirement costs of reac-
t o rs in the United Stat e s ’e l e c t ricity markets
could run to more than $15 billion. In recent
ye a rs , S we d e n ’s gove rnment raised the
amount of money utilities need to collect for
d e c o m m i s s i o n i n g .No one can say for sure just
h ow much it will cost to handle the wa s t e
l e g a cy from nuclear powe r , though so far the
e s t i m ates continue to climb upwa r d .
In other countri e s , including France
and most developing countri e s , g ove rn-
ments intend to provide public funds to
dismantle reactors when the time comes,
ensuring that the current generation that
uses the power from nuclear plants will
pass on to future generations the cost of dis-
posing of them.
In the end, decommissioning could
become the largest remaining expense fa c i n g
the nuclear industry and the gove rn m e n t s
who have supported it, p a rticularly if effort s
to confine radioactive waste fa i l . E ven if no
more nuclear waste is creat e d , dealing with
existing waste will require attention and
i nvestments for a period that defies our usual
notion of time.The challenge before human
societies is to keep nuclear waste including the
actual remnants of shuttered plants in isola-
tion for the many millennia that make up
the hazardous life of these mat e ri a l s. In this
l i g h t , no matter what becomes of nuclear
p owe r , the nuclear age will continue for a
ve ry long time. n
