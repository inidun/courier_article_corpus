The River Okavango flows for
about 1,400 kilometres from its
source in Angola (where it is
known as the Cubango) before
disappearing into the sands of
the Kalahari Desert in Botswana,
where it forms the world's largest
inland delta. This vast marshy zone,
175 kilometres long and 180 wide
at its furthest extent, is a natural
wonder whose luxuriant, emerald-
green vegetation covers almost
16,000 square kilometres.
The delta's shallow waters con¬
stitute Africa's largest oasis. The last
free-roaming herds of Cape buffalo
are found there, along with a host of
other wild animals and some 350
species of birds including the
jacana, the bee-eater, the malachite

The region corresponds precisely
to the following definition of wet¬
lands, which features in the Con¬
vention on Wetlands of Interna¬
tional Importance especially as
Waterfowl Habitat, which was
adopted at Ramsar in Iran in 1971:
"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or
water, whether natural or artificial,
permanent or temporary, with
water that is static or flowing, fresh,
brackish or salt, including areas of
marine water the depth ofwhich at
low tides does not exceed six
metres."
A report published by the World
Conservation Union (IUCN)
describes the situation as follows:
"All deltas are notoriously unstable,
and that of the Okavango, which is
located between major fault-lines, is
a particularly fragile ecosystem; its
waters can disappear and some¬
times reappear within a genera¬
tion." Botswana is faced with severe
water shortages, made even worse
by a long drought, the worst in
southern Africa this century. Apart
from the River Chobe in the north,
the Okavango is the country's only
water source.
Aware that sustainable develop¬
ment involves wise management of
water resources, the government of
Botswana drew up a project to
increase food production and pro¬
vide water for Maun, a base for safari
companies in the south of the delta,
and for diamond mines located 280
kilometres to the south-east.
The project involved dredging 42
kilometres of waterways in the
southern part of the delta and cre¬
ating two reservoirs, each more than
100 kilometres long, which would
have submerged good agricultural
land. Local people were fiercely hos¬
tile to the idea, and Botswana's
WaterAffairs Department asked the
World Conservation Union to pro¬
duce a study on the impact of the
project. The conclusion of the study
was that there should be no
dredging and that the two reser¬
voirs should not be built, so that
the waters of the Okavango could
continue to flow and deposit their
average annual silt load of over
700,000 tons. Instead, it suggested
pumping ground water, sufficient
quantitites ofwhich are available.
STILL WATERS
While running water conjures up
an image of cleanliness and purity,
still water has a bad reputation.
Marshes, swamps and bogs are gen¬
erally thought of as gloomy, dismal,
frightening places that exhale
methane gas and are inhabited by
cold-blooded, monstrous creatures.
Malaria used to be known as marsh
fever, and the draining of swamps
has long been regarded as a public
health measure. Yet wetlands have
their uses: they play a part in replen¬
ishing ground water reserves, mod¬
erate the effects of flooding, stabilize
coastlines and protect them during
storms, retain sediments without
becoming blocked as dams do, pro¬
vide fodder for cattle, and furnish a

habitat for fish and for wildlife gen¬
erally, particularly birds.
The Ramsar Convention sug¬
gested that contracting parties
should designate at least one wet¬
land on their territory as being of
international importance and
should take steps to preserve its
ecology. It also called on govern¬
ments to promote "wise use" ofwet¬
lands, whether or not they appear
on the Ramsar List ofWetland Sites
of International Importance. In
practice there are, of course, no
means ofenforcing the convention's
proposals.
Take the example of Canada. The
State of Canada's Environment, a
report published in 1991, points out
that "By lune 1990, the Convention
had designated 488 sites. Of these,
the 30 in Canada cover 130,000
square kilometres ofwetland habitat,
the largest area ofdesignated Ramsar
wetíands of any country. This is not
surprising, as Canada has 24 per cent
of the world's wetlands. Although
designation in itself provides no
enforcable protection for wetlands,
most of these are protected by
existing federal or provincial legisla¬
tion." Protection is badly needed for,
as the Canadian government itself
admits, agricultural draining has
destroyed 85 per cent of the wet¬
lands ofBritish Columbia, the prairie
states, southern Ontario and the
Atlantic coastal marshes.
The situation is similar in the
United States. The World Wide Fund
for Nature (WWF) estimates that
870,000 square kilometres of wet¬
lands have disappeared and that 80
per cent of one-time wetland has
been put to agricultural use. In New
Zealand, more than 90 per cent of
wetlands have vanished since the
first European settlers arrived, and
draining is still going on. Two-thirds
of the mangrove swamps in the
Philippines disappeared between
1920 and 1980 to make way for the
farming of shrimps and the fish
known as chanos. In the Caribbean
and on the Pacific coast of central
America, mangroves are burned for
charcoal. In Costa Rica their bark
provides tannin for use in leather-
working, and a national utility com¬
pany is hoping to use them as sub¬
stitutes for imported telephone
poles.
OTHER APFR0ACHES
The degradation ofwetlands should
not be laid solely at the door of
greedy farmers. It is also caused in
part by infrastructure development
for industry, tourism and urban
development; by the exploitation
of non-renewable resources such

rently investing some $150 million
on studying ways of protecting the
population of Bangladesh from
cyclones and flooding. But is it nec¬
essary, as has been suggested, to
build embankments and other
structures that risk cutting off land
from the fertile silt that helps feed
the country's 110 million people?
A dozen or so dams have been
constructed on the Mekong River
and its tributaries, and have served
to produce electricity and to
increase agricultural production via
irrigation. But there have also been
negative effects. Beneficial flooding
has been reduced, and the diminu¬
tion in freshwater inflow to the
coastal zones, including the man¬
grove forests, has led to increased
salinity and a lowering of the water
level.
People seeking to protect natural
ecosystems are locked in perpetual
combat with the major construc¬
tion and development companies,
which are always on the lookout for
big public works projects. If the
environmentalists are to have any
chance ofwinning, they must come
up with detailed counter-proposals,
and persuade governments that
these ideas are feasible and also
cheaper to implement as they
have done in Botswana.

as peat or gravel; by the exhaustion
of ground water; by overfishing or
intensive or inappropriate fish
farming; and by the reduction of
surface water discharge, leading to
changes in silt deposits.
But the threat to wetlands may
also come from far away. WWF cites
dam construction on the Ebro in
Spain as an example. In the past,
more than 20 million tons of silt
were carried down to the delta each
year; now only 3 million reach it. As
a result, the complex of dunes,
lagoons and saltmarshes vital for
wildlife is being affected by
increased sea and wind erosion.
Catalan rice-growing has been
affected, because more salt is being
deposited on the rice-fields; mussel-
beds have also suffered. "We have
clearly not learned from our mis¬
takes," writes Chris Tydeman of the
British section of WWF, "for even
now similar plans exist in Greece,
including a scheme for several dams
on the Acheloos River, which will
have a devastating effect on the

trolling the increasingly severe
floods in Bangladesh have been the
subject of strong criticism. The
