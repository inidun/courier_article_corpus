Are there really
too many teachers?
by John Chesswas
|N these days of striving
for greater and greater productivity in
various kinds o f enterprises, eco¬
nomists point to education as a "labour
intensive" activity, conservative and
slow to adapt itself to modern prac¬
tices. How true is this criticism that
it uses a large quantity of manpower,
and educated and trained manpower
at that?
A simple calculation from data
JOHN CHESSWAS, of Unesco's Depart¬
ment of Planning and Financing of Edu¬
cation, was formerly head of educational
planning in the Uganda Ministry of Edu¬
cation, and a staff member of the
International Institute for Educational Plann¬
ing, in Paris. He is the author of several
books on educational planning, particular
concerning its application to the developing
countries.
concerning countries for which suitable
information is available produces the
ratios between population and teachers
and between total employees and
teachers, about 1965, shown in the
table on page 23.
Thus one could say, for instance,
that in Kenya every 278th person or
every 18th employee is a teacher. To
be sure, there are always some ele¬
ments of doubt in statistical counts and
projections, and difficulties arise from
differences of interpretation of the term
"employee". But even if the figures
in the table are taken as simply indi¬
cative of an order of size, the results
give food for thought.
In developing countries, which have
relatively less developed educational
services, teachers represent only a
small proportion of the population.
Yet in some cases the ratio of wage
earners to total population is also
extremely small. This is particularly
true of the first three countries in the
table (page 23) where teachers thus
represent a sizeable proportion of each
country's wage earners.
Even more interesting, perhaps, is
the situation in the more developed
countries which have a base of com¬
pulsory primary education and a well
developed upper second and higher
level of education as well, and at the
same time a predominantly wage-earn¬
ing economy.
As we see from the table, the two
"space nations", U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.,
come very close to one another, and
within the same range come Canada,

TOO MANY TEACHERS 7 (Continued)
MAKING
LEARNING FUN
These totally absorbed young
children in a first grade
classroom (left) are learning
to read. As their teacher's
tape recorded voice comes
through the earphones, they
watch story illustrations
projected on a screen or
follow her words in a book.
The use of audio and visual
electronic devices as teaching
aids has enabled first grade
beginners to attain third year
reading proficiency in eight
months. Right, this little girl
has Just answered a question
put to her by a programmed
teaching machine. If her answer
is correct, the following question
will appear on the lefthand
screen. She covers her eyes,
waiting to see if she was right
and if the machine surprises
her with the next problem.
Lowest status of all, or nearly so
22
Albania, France, Norway, Australia and
New Zealand, the whole forming a
highly significant group. Italy and Ire¬
land follow a little behind, probably
because their educational systems are
somewhat less developed than those
of the main group. Within this limited
group, the United Kingdom, somewhat
surprisingly, has the smallest propor¬
tion of teachers in terms both of total
population and employees.
Generally speaking, about one per¬
son in every hundred and one em¬
ployee in every thirty-five in these
countries is a teacher. But when one
considers the wide range of occupa¬
tions found in such countries, these are
low figures indeed.
Furthermore, there is a widespread
tendency not only for more young
people to enter school, but also for
them to stay there longer. To this
must be added the constant demand
by teachers for smaller classes in
the interests of educational efficiency
and teaching standards, which clearly
means that more teachers are needed
for the same number of students. Com¬
pound these two factors, and educa¬
tion claims an even larger proportion
of the population and of wage-earners.
In countries all over the world the
total cost of education has been rising
at a very fast rate, certainly faster
than national income, and especially
since the Second World War. Some
countries are now spending from six
to seven per cent of their Gross
National Product on education.
It is already being said that the
limit has been reached. This limit
must obviously come at some point for
every country, as education is only one
of numerous activities sharing the
national cake. Yet the prospects des¬
cribed above would push even higher
the fast rising share which education
already demands.
If more and more children are to be
kept in school longer and longer and
how long formal education should last
is itself a debatable question then
perhaps the time has come for a broad
reassessment of current educational
practices. Indeed, to carry the point
to its logical conclusion, the very con¬
cept of "education", recognized as a
universal human right, may be called
in question.
But in this article it is not proposed
to enter into such spheres. Its concern
is solely with educational practices in
relation to the function of the teachers
applying them.
At least one important probability
can be foreseen if present practices
are continued. If education continues
to command the present proportion
of the wage-earning force, or if that
proportion increases, as it well may,
then it will be difficult if not impos¬
sible for a country to pay to such
a large force of middle and high level
manpower, salaries which they will
accept as equitable to their education,
training and status vis-à-vis other
employees of equal standing.
The result will be that in many
countries teaching will stay near or
at the bottom of the popularity poll of
occupations for educated persons. Is
that what we want for our children?
Thus, instead of lowering the
student-teacher ratio by simply reduc¬
ing the size of classes, would it not
be more sensible to seek means of
raising it, without loss of educational
efficiency and standards? This is where
consideration of the new educational
techniques television, radio, program¬
med instruction, and the latest entrant
in the field, computers comes in.
It is not possible here to discuss

the relative merits of each of these,
or combinations of them, perhaps in¬
corporating mixtures of more conven¬
tional techniques. The present pur¬
pose is to point out that current edu¬
cational practices must be subjected
to scrutiny, and changes in methods
must be sought so as to reduce the
manpower demands of education and
put at the disposal of the teacher more
productive means to help him achieve
his object, at the same time enhancing
his position and status.
This has been done in many spheres,

mployees & wage-earners are
even, in spite of the forbodings of
economists some twenty years ago, in
the tertiary sector (service industries)
of some countries. So why not in
education too?
Whatever means are tried, they must
be subjected to a complete economic
analysis. It is pointless saving money
on teachers if in the process as much
as is saved, or perhaps more, is spent
on the alternative means used to re¬
place them. In some cases, in fact,
it has been shown that the same
number of teachers is still required, so
that the cost of the new technique
becomes an additional burden. It may
be found that a saving made on the
number of teachers employed is can¬
celled out by the need to employ
other kinds of human skills those of
technicians to maintain the electronic
teaching aids, for instance.
The question of the initial, the main¬
tenance and the depreciation costs of
expensive equipment thus becomes of
crucial importance. So does the need
to see that it is not maltreated. This
raises the question of the maturity,
motivation and responsibility of the
students.

REALLY TOO MANY TEACHERS? (Continued from page 23)
for a quick end to the teaching pro¬
cess. Put a group of upper secondary
students preparing for university en¬
trance in a similar situation and the
result might be very different.
It is possible that this latter group
could be left alone with the machine,
and the need for teacher-student con¬
tact would thereby be reduced. Here
is the basic essence of the use of
new techniques in place of some, at
least, of the conventional teaching
force.
In the former case, however, the
human presence is still essential. At
the lower levels of education, per¬
haps during the time that students are
"compelled" to attend school, the
opportunities to reduce the number of
teachers would seem to be less than
those at the higher levels, where the
students are there voluntarily because
they are looking for something, can
understand the logic behind the need
for care of the precious machine and
generally can be trusted to act in a
responsible manner.
L

ooking at the cost aspects
of the new techniques, we find one
which stands out because of its cheap¬
ness. Many people associate program¬
med learning with a machine which
controls the presentation of the
sequential learning material. It is the
control which matters, not the machine,
and programmed material has been
presented in simple book form with
considerable success (1).
The student is simply expected to
cover up the answers to the material
in the successive boxes and to move
from box to box in accordance with
instructions instead of using an ex¬
pensive machine to do the same thing
for him. Essentially it is a matter of
his behaving in a responsible manner,
and if he can be made to see that it
is to his advantage to do so rather
than to "cheat", then the purpose is
achieved.
Preparation of such programmes
needs skill and care, and although

velopment Programme project at the Institut
Pédagogique National de l'Enseignement
Technique (PNET) at Beirut, Lebanon.
programmed material presented in such
form may cost rather more than the
conventional text-book, it will cost
much less than complicated machines,
and it does mean in particular that the
learning of routine factual knowledge,
which many students now receive by
the conventional teacher-student con¬
tact, can be undertaken without the
presence of the teacher, if the students
can be trusted to follow the rules.
All this being said, there is one
important question to be answered.
To what extent is the personal in¬
fluence of the teacher on the taught
an essential part of the educational
process?
There are those who argue that no
mechanized form of instruction can
do the job better than a good teacher.
They maintain that the back-and-forth
interaction between teacher and taught
is essential for ensuring that the know¬
ledge which is being passed on is
correctly understood and for the
student to be able to use that know¬
ledge in an intelligent and constructive
manner. It is considered that a ma¬
chine cannot replace a good teacher
as the trainer of an imaginative, adapt¬
able human being; it might help him
to do so, but can never take his place.
There is also another aspect to the
question of the human influence, less
precise, less positively organized, but
in many philosophies of education as
important as the passing on of know¬
ledge and the ability to use it, if not
more so the moral training of the
student, the formation of his character.
Long ago, before our present cons¬
ciously organized style of education
existed, these personal influences were
automatically the responsibility of the
family and the community. To a great
extent they still are, but in some
countries they are now recognized as
partly the responsibility of the school.
In fact, when a child finds himself in
social contact with his fellow children
and adults in a school situation, such
influences happen of their own accord,
planned or otherwise, and, moreover,
they may not always be good in¬
fluences.
In which case, must it not be assum¬
ed that the school must inevitably
undertake part of this process? There
are cases where there is a distinct
necessity for a modern state to orga¬
nize corrective human influences on
children who come from disturbed
homes, and in fact the school is often
positively setting out to create an
atmosphere for that very purpose.
It can be argued that such compen¬
satory services should be provided
outside the school, but this is only
dodging the issue. In the full sense
of the word "education", this is an
educational activity and if social
workers are paid to undertake this task
the money and the manpower are in
fact devoted to an educational acti¬
vity, whatever the institutional orga¬
nization which is used for the purpose.
Is the human influence then
essential to the educational process,
whether for the purpose of passing on
knowledge and skills, for the purpose
of supervising, checking, guiding
students' work, or for the purpose of
exercising moral guidance on them ?
Again it must be said that this may
vary with students at different levels.
There must obviously be a difference
in attitude in this respect when one is
dealing with a primary school child as
against a student who is legally recog¬
nized as an adult and has a vote and
the legal right to own property and
marry without parental consent.
When it comes to the point, if a socie¬
ty decides that such human influences
are an essential part of the organized
educational process, then whatever
techniques, whatever machines, are
used in that process, a degree of
labour intensivity in education must
be considered as inevitable because
of the nature of the activity to be
performed.
Moreover, if this important service
is to be undertaken by suitable, train¬
ed professionals, society must be
prepared to pay them a remuneration
which they accept as compatible with
their status. With some twenty to
twenty-five per cent of the population
as students in schools and universities
the six to seven per cent limit to
the proportion of Gross National Pro¬
duct to be allocated to education would
then almost inevitably have to be
raised.
