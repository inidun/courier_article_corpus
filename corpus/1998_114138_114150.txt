A few months ago Italy’s Minister of the
Interior, Giorgio Napolitano, told parliament
t h at “Italy has a vo c ation as a country of
immigration.”This is an ironic twist of history. For
over a century Italians emigr ated on a massive scale,
but during the last twenty years the situation has
been reversed as hundreds of thousands of people
have come to Italy in search of a job and a new life.
They started to arri ve in the early 1980s.
Women came from Eri t r e a , where a war was on,
and Cape Ve r d e , looking for work as domestic
servants. Then the smiling faces of North African
café wa i t e rs and cooks began to appear in cities like
Rome and Milan. Egyptian wo r k e rs could be
spotted in the foundries of Emilia Romagna. I n
1 9 8 6 , when the Italian parliament passed for the
first time a law protecting the rights of wo r k e rs from
outside the European Community, the number of
these wo r k e rs was put at 500,000, out of a total
population of 57 million Italians.
The arri val of these newcomers signaled the
s t a rt of a new trend in a country which had,
r e gional disparities notwithstanding, b e c o m e
prosperous. In the mid-1970s,the other European
n ations closed their doors to immigr at i o n ,w h e r e a s
Italy adopted no specific measures to regulate a
phenomenon that was still new. The country also
looked with a different eye at its inform a l
“ u n d e r gr o u n d ”e c o n o my in which family members
sometimes employed one another, t a xes we r e
avoided and black market labour was often used.
Immigrant workers—flexible and easily-exploited
labour—found a place in that market.They wo r k e d
in homes, r e s t a u r a n t s ,s t o r e s ,s e rv i c e s ,c o n s t ru c t i o n ,
fa rming and, little by little, small- and medium-
sized companies.
I m m i gr ation became a socially recognized
p h e n o m e n o n . At the same time it stirr e d
c o n t r ove rsy and in some cases triggered xe n o p h o b i c
r e a c t i o n s. On the one hand, a s s o c i ations were set up
to defend immigr a n t s ’ ri g h t s ; on the other, t h e r e
were outbu rsts of racism, as in 1989 when a gang of
young delinquents near Naples murdered an
A f rican fa rm labourer.The killing galvanized public
opinion and the gove rnment decided to draft a new
bill concerning immigr at i o n , the status of foreigners
and their social ri g h t s.The bill became law in 1990
and enabled some 200,000 foreigners to obtain
residence permits.
A country to which
people come
Italy now has around one million officially
r e gistered immigrant wo r k e rs.A gove rnment report
published in June 1998 put the number of
undocumented aliens at between 200,000 and
300,000.The immigrants hail from an increasing
number and va riety of places, including the
M e d i t e rranean basin, China and the Indian sub-
c o n t i n e n t . In decreasing order, the largest
communities are from Morocco, the Philippines,
Tunisia, the People’s Republic of China, Senegal,
S ri Lanka, Po l a n d , Romania and other Ea s t
European countri e s. Recent ye a rs have seen an
increase in the number of undocumented aliens
from the former Yu g o s l avia and A l b a n i a , a direct
consequence of war and unrest in the Balkans.T h e
r e p o rt also says that “some communities have
stabilized considerably”, citing the gr owing number
of children and the increasing rate of family re-
unification.
Italy is still adapting to its new situation as a
c o u n t ry to which people come rather than leave .
For ye a rs informal networks made up of the foreign
communities themselves, private support groups,
o r g a n i z ations and a few local authorities organized
the reception of immigrants. Today the initiatives
they launched are often being taken up by
g ove rnment agencies. In the field of health care, f o r
example,a new figure has emerged—the “cultural
Italy, once a notable source of emigrants,
has become a magnet for immigrants in
the last 20 years

m e d i at o r ” ,who speaks the language and is fa m i l i a r
with the culture of the individual concerned, and
o f f e rs his or her services as a go-between to fa c i l i t at e
access to health care.There have also been at t e m p t s
to integr ate foreign pupils through multicultural
education.In 1996 a little over 50,000 children,or
six per cent of the resident foreign populat i o n ,we r e
enrolled in Italy’s elementary and middle schools.
School is the most effective tool for successful
integration and the key to peaceful co-existence.
An immigr ation law passed by the Italian
parliament in March 1998 established for the firs t
time a coherent legal framework gove rning admission
to Italy and the renewal of expired residence perm i t s.
Extremely complicat e d , if not entirely inapplicable,
l aws had previously encouraged immigrants not to
apply for papers.A nyone who has legally lived in Italy
for five ye a rs or more is now eligible for a residence
p e rm i t , which is valid for an unlimited length of time
and frees its bearer from eternal “ g u e s t ”s t atus as we l l
as from the trouble of renewing a permit that has
e x p i r e d .The gove rnment is requested to set annual
admissions quotas in consultation with the regi o n s
and gove rnment agencies concern e d . In early 1998
the quota was set at approx i m ately 20,000 people bu t
by June the Ministry of Labour had already recorded
34,000 requests.
At the same time, as a member of the European
U n i o n ’s Schengen group Italy must apply stri c t
rules concerning expulsion, t u rning back foreigners
at the border and fighting illegal immigr at i o n .L a s t
summer around 200 clandestine immigrants who
had paid an unscrupulous trafficker a high pri c e
for the trip over in a boat landed on the Sicilian
c o a s t , giving rise to talk about an “illegal alien
e m e r g e n cy ” . It was as if, at the sight of these
bewildered travelers, baggage in hand and hearts
full of hope,Italians had forgotten their old family
pictures of their grandfathers leaving home with a
