Heritage is a timely theme in a world
shaken by an intense and violent crisis,o n e
which calls into question an entire system
of values while eroding the relationship
between people and the environment.Th e
effects of industrial and technological
evolution testify to this: the sacred pact
between people, nature and the universe
has been severed.The planet is poisoned.
And life seems threatened in all its different
f o r m s.
This crisis not only beckons us to
rethink our approaches to development
but the very notion itself. For too long,
development has solely been seen
through the materialist lens of production
and consumption. To d a y, i n t e l l e c t u a l s,
artists and writers are increasingly
convinced that this concept, w h i c h
s a c r i fices culture to economic growth,
the qualitative to the quantitative, c a n
only bear catastrophic consequences.
To d a y,we renew our longstanding call
to place culture ahead of all else.The great
landmarks in humanity’s history have
always been in the domain of culture. It is
not a question of creating cultural,e t h n i c
and geographical ghettoes. On the
c o n t r a r y. Putting culture first means
appreciating the specificity and richness of
our respective identities, building on the
heritage of the past and enriching that
which we bequeath to future generations.
It is a heritage to which all peoples,
n a t i o n s, c o n t i n e n t s, in short, all civilizations
could contribute their own irreplaceable
v a l u e s.
This would lead us towards a
humanism of “giving and receiving” t h a t
the Martinique poet Aimé Césaire has
so fervently called for. This humanism
offers a new way of conceiving the terms
of exchange.The outcome is a symbiosis
of cultures so that they don’t become
alike or fuse, but are enriched through
encounters with each other.This “ c u l t u r e
of the universal,” cherished by the
Senegalese poet Léopold Sédar Senghor,
is not a universal culture but a meeting of
civilizations.
It is in this meeting that humanity’s
world heritage lies. Human beings
distinguish themselves from animals by
their creative spirit, with which they
transcend the horizons of the visible. Fi r e,
once mastered, is transformed into
rustlings of life, colours and shapes. The
first staff our ancestors leaned upon,the
first stones they chose to rest upon, the
first cave in which they sought shelter,
were all tinged with the colours of light.
Human beings were born in beauty from
the outset: for the beautiful they were
born.
Created by stardust, peoples crossed
the world, sprinkling it with stones as
g u i d e p o s t s, just as in the tale of Hansel and
G r e t e l . As time passed, they built
monuments carrying the stamp of their
genius and the permanence of their
s p e c i e s.
For coherent action, we need an
image of the past and a vision of the
f u t u r e. For if science cannot answer
questions regarding their earliest origins,
nor those of the afterlife, human beings
will climb many mountains to proclaim
their faith in life.Their spirit of resistance
and their hope springs from this faith.It
is a faith that is proclaimed, like a vital
need,on the front of their buildings.
From the cabins of their childhood
to the columns of temples,on each stone,
behind every door, this hope will be
forever engraved. ■
