Botelho says firms “most of all want access to stu-
dents and researchers familiar with Brazil who can
help them ‘ t r o p i c a l i z e ’ their markets.The unive rs i-
ties get direct income—because the companies pay
t a xes or rents—and also equipment, since the firm s
install supercomputers , the latest software and
other sophisticated facilities which can be used by
local researchers.”
The Brazilian government is considering new
legislation which would oblige firms granted ope-

invest in local R&D.The head of the PUC’s centre

research. n

Although Brazil is one of the wo r l d ’s ten biggest
economies,it invests very little in R&D.World
Bank figures show that in 1995, the South A m e-
rican giant earmarked only 0.6 per cent of its GDP

But the relationship between universities and
business “still doesn’t match the huge potential for
