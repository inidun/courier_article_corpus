S a n t ’ E g i d i o ’s diplomacy

and mediating in international confli c t s
An old woman barricades herself in a dilapi-
dated building in the slums of an Italian city.
She refuses to open her door. Her neighbours
are convinced she’s becoming a derelict.A member
of the Sant’Egidio community knocks at her door
and starts to speak to her. She replies in monosyl-
l a b l e s. He leaves but comes back later to continue
a dialogue that may go on for months,even a year,
until she agrees to open the door and let him in and
finally start getting some help.
Using these skills in patient communicat i o n
based on fri e n d s h i p, the community later made
contact with a guerrilla chieftain hidden away for
years in the heart of Africa,brought him out of his
i s o l ation and persuaded him to negotiate instead of
fight.
“The Church is a home for eve ryo n e ,e s p e c i a l l y
the poor,” said Pope John XXIII, who set the Chur-
ch on the road to modern i z ation and opened it up
to the wo r l d , m oves which were endorsed by the
Vatican II Council. In line with this, a group of
C atholic students decided in 1968 to set up a
m ovement which would not be an N G O but a Chri s-
tian community where religious devotion we n t
hand in hand with putting the Gospel into prac-
tice by personal commitment to the poor.T h e i r
leader was Andrea Riccardi, who now teaches his-
t o ry at Rome Unive rsity and has been awa r d e d
UN E S C O’s Gandhi Medal for his commitment to a
culture of peace.
A language
of reconciliation
The Sant’Egidio community, which takes its
name from the disused Roman church it has adop-
ted as its headquart e rs ,t o d ay has 20,000 members
in some 300 grassroots communities in 34 coun-
t ri e s.The community began by helping abando-
ned children in the slums of Rome, then went on
to work with immigr a n t s , the elderly, the home-
l e s s , the handicapped,Aids victims and many other
groups of disadvantaged people in Europe and in
d e veloping countries of A s i a , L atin A m e rica and
A f ri c a .
One country where Sant’Egidio (St. Giles in
English) has been particularly active is Mozambique,
where famine and war raged in the early 1980s.T h e
fighting began against Po rtuguese colonial rule in
1 9 6 3 , stopped with independence in 1975,and star-
ted again a few ye a rs later for external and intern a l
r e a s o n s.The apartheid regime in South A f rica wa n-
ted to destabilize all its neighbours who refused to
recognize its regional dominance. S o c i a l i s t - ru l e d
Mozambique was a front-line target.
H u m a n i t a rian aid provided by the Sant’Egi-
dio community disappeared into a bottomless pit
because it was impossible to solve the hunger pro-
blem as long as a war was going on.The search for
a traditional mediator—a state or an intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z at i o n — failed because diplomats couldn’t
make contact with an invisible armed opposition
and thought,wrongly as it turned out,that the war
would not end until apartheid disappeared in South
Africa.
The community reluctantly saw it had no choi-
ce but to act as a mediat o r. Lacking experi e n c e ,
it had to learn what to do as it went along. It inve n-
ted a “language of reconciliat i o n ” whose syntax
it picked up as a humanitarian organization wo r-
king for the poor.
S a n t ’ E gidio had discovered how to talk to all
kinds of people from its compassionate work in a
wide va riety of constantly changing situations in
which its members related to the poor, shared their
l i ve s , spoke their language, went to the same places
they did and regarded them not as we l fare cases bu t
as full members of society.
Turning weakness
into strength
Such a dialogue might be regarded as ineffective
when the resources to overcome pove rty are una-
va i l a b l e . But the community refuses to gi ve in to
these circumstances. E x p e rience has shown that its
mere presence can be vitally import a n t , e ven if it
d o e s n ’t lead to any immediate results. In the age of
the Intern e t ,i s o l at i o n , or solitude, is a serious ail-
ment of our time. Pe rsonal isolation or loneliness
can dri ve a person mad.The isolation of a move-
m e n t , a party or a country can lead to wa r , e s p e-
cially if the intern ational community stands idly by.
The persistence of wa rs in A f rica—in southern
S u d a n , for example—provides ample proof of this.
The community’s work has also taught it to be
p at i e n t .When the foreign minister of an import a n t
c o u n t ry travels to mediate in a gi ven situat i o n , he or
she has limited time yet their mission must lead to
r e s u l t s.They cannot risk failing because failure wo u l d
damage their credibility, because there is pressure
from public opinion or because elections are immi-
n e n t . But how can conflicts that have taken shape
over several decades be solved in a matter of months?

The community has no target date for results.
Peace negotiations started at the same time in
Angola and Mozambique. In A n g o l a , they we r e
completed in three and a half months, and it wa s
said that the talks in Mozambique were draggi n g
on.Many people told the mediator he was wasting
his time and theirs too.The negotiations were indeed
long—11 sessions over 27 months, b e t ween June
1990 and October 1992. E ve ry detail was careful-
ly scrutinized because the mediator regarded him-
self as a begi n n e r.To d ay the Mozambique peace
a greement is still holding, whilst sadly war has bro-
ken out again in Angola.
The community’s weakness is also its strong
p o i n t . It cannot mobilize an army or sign enorm o u s
c h e q u e s.This “ we a k n e s s ” is in fact a guarantee of
its sinceri t y — t h at all it’s interested in is peace-
m a k i n g, t h at it has no weapons except its belief in
f riendship and peace. So different sides come to
t rust it and talk about their problems freely, w i t h o u t
the restraints they would feel if dealing with offic i a l
bodies as part of the power plays that are inevitable
in such contacts.This fa m i l i a rity with the wa rri n g
p a rties goes hand in hand with the in-depth unders-
tanding of the societies in confli c t , especially in A f ri-
c a ,t h at Sant’Egidio has gathered from its local gr a s s-
roots communities.
A peace process is not just about negotiating and
then signing a document.The follow-up is extre-
mely complex.It involves development and demo-
c r a cy, r e c o n c i l i ation and rememberi n g . The 
community cannot do this by itself and has neve r
sought to do so. It does not believe in parallel diplo-
m a cy but in promoting a synergy of resources and
actions.
Gatherings to pray
for peace
A peace accord’s chances of success depend
mainly on those who sign it but also on civil socie-
ty and the intern ational climat e . So Sant’Egi d i o
encourages consistent and prolonged efforts by
m a ny other intern ational part i e s — g ove rn m e n t a l
and otherwise—to boost any peace process in which
it is invo l ve d .O b s e rve rs representing the United
N ations and the gove rnments of Italy, F r a n c e ,N o rt h
America, Portugal,the United Kingdom and even
South A f rica took part in the final stage of the
Mozambique negotiations.
These talks brought the community into the
limelight and it acquired a reputation and credibi-
lity that have since been used by wa rring part i e s
from Guatemala to Buru n d i , from Congo-Kinsha-
sa to Kosovo and A l g e ri a . In A l g e ri a , S a n t ’ E gi d i o
managed to bring Muslim enemies to the negotia-
ting table by using another of its methods, i n t e r - r e l i-
gious dialogue.
For more than a decade,Sant’Egidio has orga-
nized intern ational gat h e rings to pray for peace.
These are a key factor in the language of reconci-
l i ation because they build a genuine culture of inter-
r e l i gious peace. But Sant’Egi d i o ’s commitment to
peace continues to be an extension of its commit-
ment to fight pove rt y, to which it still devotes 80 per
cent of its efforts. n
The isolation of a movement,
a party or a country can 
lead to war, especially 
if the international community
stands idly by
