T
hat day will remain etched in my memory
f o r e v e r. At the time, in 1966, I was 12, m y
sister 10. Like every summer, we were
visiting our paternal grandparents in our
village 15 kilometres from Bamako in M a l i .
Early one morning, we went to see my aunt, m y
f a t h e r ’s sister, whom we were always happy to visit
because she spoiled us.
I didn’t suspect a thing. My aunt called me into
the bathroom. Several women jumped on me and
held me down. They spread my legs open. I was
s c r e a m i n g. I couldn’t see the knife but felt them
cutting me. I was crying as the blood flowed
e v e r y w h e r e. They said, “ D o n ’t cry, i t ’s shameful!
Yo u ’re a woman, what we’re doing to you is
n o t h i n g.”They started clapping.They dressed me in
a white skirt. No bandages, just something they had
prepared with shea oil and leaves. I left.It was my
little sister’s turn. I heard her crying and begging me
for help, and that hurt even more.

“ Taking the dress”
A Malian woman who underwent excision at the age of 12 recalls the
experience which led her to combat this ritual practice
2 . PASSING RITES
“We were betrayed.”

The excision was a plot.We were betrayed.We
were living in Senegal,where my father was a civil
s e r v a n t . My parents were educated people, t h e y
were against excision. But at that time, it was a
widespread practice in the countryside and city.
Most little girls were excised much younger than us,
and the occasion was followed by a party.We stayed
with our aunt for almost three
w e e k s. A woman she knew
helped us because we couldn’t
stand up by ourselves. It hurt so
much we avoided going to the
b a t h r o o m . Our mother cried
and kissed us the first time she
came to see us, but she couldn’t
do anything. In A f r i c a , t h e
f a t h e r ’s family decides whether
children live or die.
Meanwhile, we were given
our female education.We were
told that a woman must be strong, tough,secretive
and not too talkative. Sex was a taboo topic.
Mutilation never heals
I was filled with hatred and rage. I had not been
brought up with that mentality. But I was resigned,
despite the pain.I got married at 22.I never talked
about the feeling of being incomplete, of missing a
part of my body. Women were not allowed to
express desire or pleasure. I could only talk to close
friends about the fact that excision is not a wound
but a mutilation.A wound heals, but a mutilation
means disfig u r e m e n t . It means removing a part that
never grows back. When I had daughters of my
o w n , I told my husband that I did not want them to
be excised. He agreed. I protected them by not
sending them to visit Africa when they were little.
It was not a sacred or religious rite, but a ritual
p a s s a g e. There is an expression in Bambara that
says “taking the dress,”which means becoming a real
woman.Before excision,a girl is innocent,she can
walk around bare-chested or even naked. A f t e r
e x c i s i o n , she must keep her body covered. Th e
person who has his or her child excised does so
because that’s the way things have been for
g e n e r a t i o n s.They are afraid that evil will befall the
child if they don’t.They have always heard,“when
you have a daughter, you must have her excised so
that she can become a perfect woman.” But Islam
never said “excise your daughters,” even though
many people think the Koran orders them to do so.
Men invented excision to control women’s sexuality.
To be a real woman, her clitoris,which is considered
to represent a man’s sex, is removed. E x c i s e d
mummies dating back prior to the appearance of
Islam have been found.
African women have been denouncing excision
since 1924, but at that time they were considered
c r a z y. More recently,we have been lucky enough to
have support from European women and the media
to make ourselves heard.When I came to Fr a n c e, I
started campaigning with several organizations,
including GAMS (see box).To d a y,we are invited to
clinics and maternity wards to tell mothers that
excision is against the law. We campaign for
prevention in schools and with social workers. We
also see families individually.
P s y c h o l o g i c a l l y, i t ’s more
d i f ficult for girls born in Fr a n c e
to undergo excision.Those who
are 18 or 20 today will have or
have had problems during their
first sexual experience. Th e
men of my generation learned
to accept the unacceptable.B u t
t o d a y ’s boys will not want girls
who are undergoing excision
now and will be old enough to
marry around 2020. I know a
girl who had to leave her neighbourhood because
people made fun of her.
We are against excision in all its forms, even if
it takes place under anesthesia in the hospital.
Our campaign isn’t just against the pain at the
time of excision,but against the mutilation of our
bodies. ■

In our female education,
we were told that a
woman must be strong,
tough and not too
talkative. Sex was
a taboo topic.
