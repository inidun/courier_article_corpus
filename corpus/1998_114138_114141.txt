The fate of the unparalleled concentration of nuclear material on Russia’s
Kola peninsula is alarming neighbouring Scandinavian countries
n
The strike only lasted an hour, but it wa s
enough to set alarm bells ri n ging in
M o s c ow. Organized by Russia’s nuclear
defence wo r k e rs in September this ye a r , i t
caused such concern in Moscow that despite
the severe financial crisis the gove rn m e n t
allotted about $16 million for the defence
e m p l oyees who had not been paid for
m o n t h s.E ven the latest deal gave the wo r k e rs
only half of the wages owed to them by the
g ove rn m e n t .‘‘ People are really hungry. H ow
can you ask them to look after our securi t y ? ’’
said Yu ry Bers e nye v, a scientist from the
closed nuclear city Snezhinsk, in an interv i e w
to a local daily.
Corroding equipment
and dissatisfied servicemen
The Russian Union of Nuclear Industry
Wo r k e rs says that hungry nuclear wo r k e rs
and lack of funding could lead to seri o u s
trouble in the Russian nuclear sector,
including defence establishments.In addition
to corroding submari n e s ,d i s s at i s fied military
p e rsonnel now add more complications for
the Russian authori t i e s. In September this
year a disgruntled armed conscript killed
eight of his fellow servicemen and threat e n e d
to blow up the Akula-class submarine at the
Skalisty naval base in the Kola peninsula.
Finally he killed himself in the torp e d o
c o m p a rt m e n t . Though Russian officials
assured that the sailor could not have
damaged the torp e d o e s ,a ny explosion in the
c o m p a rtment was strong enough to damage
the submari n e ’s single nuclear reactor.T h i s
incident alarmed Norwe gian officials, as it
happened just 120 km from the border in the
c o u n t ry ’s nort h .The unstable situation in the
Russian nuclear sector has aggr avated the
wo rries of the neighbouring Scandinav i a n
n ations who will be the first to be affected in
case of a nuclear disaster in Russia’s nort h -
we s t .
The gr avest environmental hazard in the
Arctic Circle stems from  nuclear activity on
the Russian side,especially in and around the
n o rt h e rn Kola peninsula. N owhere else on
e a rth is there such a concentration of civilian
and naval nuclear reactors.According to the
Ya b l o k ov report1, an official Russian
d o c u m e n t , there were a total of 270 nuclear
r e a c t o rs in Murmansk and A r k h a n g e l s k
counties in 1990. Nuclear activity in and
around the Kola peninsula includes powe r
p l a n t s , nuclear submari n e s , huge piles of
nuclear waste and the effects of nuclear tests
conducted by the former Soviet Union.
Russia’s immediate neighbour Finland
is the only European Union country to
share a 1,200-kilometre border with Russia
and faces constant environmental threat s
from the former superp owe r. F i n l a n d ’s
Arctic Circle would be the first and worst
hit region in the event of a Russian
environmental disaster.With memories of
C h e rnobyl still haunting them, the Finns
are constantly monitoring air, water, soil,
plants and meat to make sure nothing is
amiss on the Russian side.
Despite the presence of so many old-
fashioned nuclear reactors and unprotected
piles of nuclear waste so close to the border,
K ristina Rissanen, head of the Regi o n a l
L a b o r at o ry of the Finnish Centre for
Radiation and Nuclear Safety (CRNS),in
R ova n i e m i , t ries to keep a sense of
p e rs p e c t i ve . ‘‘The radiation levels across
the border at present are not alarm i n g .
M o r e over the Russians in recent ye a rs have
s t a rted showing a more open approach, a n d
that itself is a positive factor.’’
R i s s a n e n ’s laborat o ry, eighteen metres
u n d e r gr o u n d , is designed to withstand a
nuclear holocaust.The enthusiastic team of
chemists in CRNS analyse hundreds of
samples eve ry day, from reindeer meat to
i n d u s t rial products. K ristina makes frequent
t rips to nort h we s t e rn Russia on joint
expeditions to find out the fate of submerged
nuclear reactors and the operat i o n a l
r e a c t o rs.
The Ya b l o k ov report noted that only 15
per cent of the dry-docked submarines had
been properly decommissioned by the
r e m oval of reactor fuels and the reactor
s e c t i o n . A state of the Arctic Env i r o n m e n t
Report2 says that along with nuclear waste,
the Soviet Union dumped six nuclear
s u b m a rine reactors and a shielding
assembly from an icebreaker reactor,
containing spent fuel, b e t ween the ye a rs
1959 and 1991.
Expeditions
in the Barents Sea
R i s s a n e n , whose team often searches
the Barents Sea for the nuclear reactors
from sunken Russian nuclear submarines,
takes a different view. ‘‘There is no doubt
m a ny of the submerged reactors could pose
a serious threat to the environment of the
Arctic region in the future. I am more
wo rried about the Kola nuclear power plant
than those reactors lying under the sea.T h e
nuclear reactors in Kola are very old and
similar to Chernobyl-type reactors.’’

R a d i o a c t i ve mat e rials were also found near
A t o m flot in Murm a n s k .H owe ve r , these are
not above the normal leve l s. It may be
o ri gi n ating from nuclear storage sites other
than those known. In certain areas in the
Barents Sea, where old reactors have been
dropped, the radiation level is higher. But
Russian officials do not allow us to go near
the precise spot.As long as these are not at
threatening levels it can be managed.’’
We s t e rn nuclear experts who have
visited Russia say that the form a l
r e q u i r e m e n t s , r e g u l ations and control in
the Russian Fe d e r ation today still do not
meet modern standards. To complicat e
matters,the enterprises are subordinate to
m a ny different authori t i e s , federal and
l o c a l , which make the regulat o ry system
complex.The amount of waste and spent
fuel greatly exceeds the capacity of storage
and reprocessing.Most importantly, there
is no money to fully maintain, restore or
replace equipment and facilities for
r a d i o a c t i ve waste and spent fuel
c o n d i t i o n i n g, h a n d l i n g, t r a n s p o rt and
s t o r a g e . According to former Russian
Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Nikolay
Ye g o r ov the cleanup projects in the
N o rt h e rn Fleet would require some $1.5
b i l l i o n . ‘‘ M at t e rs wo rsen eve ry ye a r. . . . a n d
The Nort h e rn Fleet and naval shipya r d s
include nuclear-powered submarines and
b attle cru i s e rs based at nine ports along the
n o rt h e rn coast of the Kola peninsula and at
t wo bases on the Archangelsk regi o n ’s coast.
There are about ninety vessels in operat i o n
and more than seventy out of operation and
laid up, containing about 170 reactors in
o p e r ation and 130 out of operat i o n .A b o u t
5,000 tons of solid waste are generat e d
annually at the Nort h e rn Fleet’s nuclear
vessels and at shipyards in the two regi o n s.
Rissanen cautions that new storage
facilities have to be built in the Russian
Fe d e r ation to ensure the safety of the
nuclear wa s t e . ‘‘ D u ring one of the
expeditions we found excessive radioactive
caesium in the sediments of Dvina Rive r
could turn into a cat a s t r o p h e ,’’ R I A
N ovosty news agency quoted Ye g o r ov as
saying in July this year.
Shannon Kile,a research assistant at the
Stockholm Intern ational Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) voices concern over the
fate of the nuclear missiles and fuel in the
decommissioned su b m a rines and
dismantled missiles. He says ‘‘as per the
S t r at e gic A rms Reduction Tr e aty (STA RT-
I) the Russian Fe d e r ation dismantled
hundreds of nuclear delive ry ve h i c l e s. B o t h
in STA RT-I and the ongoing STA RT-II (to
be rat i fied by Russian parliament) the
s t atus of the nuclear warheads fixed in
those missiles is unspecified and future
a rms reduction agreements should take
care of the warheads also.’’

About 5,000 tons of solid nuclear waste

N ovaya Zemlya (New Earth) was the
main Soviet nuclear test site between 1955
and 1990. In total, 132 nuclear explosions
were conducted, 87 of which we r e
at m o s p h e ric (above gr o u n d ) , three we r e
u n d e r water and 42 undergr o u n d . More than
90 per cent of the total power of all the
nuclear weapons tests performed by the
f o rmer Soviet Union were made in Novaya
Z e m l ya .3 According to scientists at the
Institute of Radiation Hygi e n e , S t .
Pe t e rs bu r g4, the highest levels of radioactive
fallout in the entire Russian arctic and
subarctic area were found in the Kola
p e n i n s u l a . They say the sources of
c o n t a m i n ation were at m o s p h e ric nuclear
weapons tests up to 1963, when the
maximum fallout concentrations of
r a d i o a c t i ve caesium and strontium we r e

Despite pressure from Scandinav i a n
and other European countries it is not
realistic to expect the Russians to wholly
abandon their nuclear energy projects,
which are badly required for the powe r -
s t a rved nort h west region of the country.
Irrespective of advances in other forms of
e l e c t ricity generat i o n , Russia will probably
continue to use and develop nuclear
technology because of its huge
i n f r a s t ructure and enormous manpowe r.
R u s s i a , in this regard, needs help from
Western countries to find a solution to the
problem.
Though Norway has taken the lead in
co-operating with the Russians in working
out solutions, We s t e rn experts say the
intransigent nature of Russian bu r e a u c r a cy
blocks rapid progress in co-operat i o n .
D u ring Norwe gian King Harald V ’s visit to
Moscow in May 1998, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said Russia would dismantle
all its old nuclear submarines in the Barents
Sea region if Norway provided the
n e c e s s a ry financial assistance. A n
a greement signed between the two
countries in May 1998 cleared the hurdles
t h at have delayed Norwe gian efforts to
p a rt i c i p ate in the cleanup of the Russian
N o rt h e rn Fleet’s leaking storage fa c i l i t i e s
for spent nuclear fuel in Andreeva Bay at
the Kola peninsula. N o r way has gr a n t e d
$60 million for the first projects and more
could be found if the programme is
successful.
‘‘Though the Norwegian side is willing
to help the Russian side there is no co-
o p e r ation from Russian authori t i e s. T h e
Ministry of Defence does not want to give
a ny access into their leaking fa c i l i t i e s.T h e y
say they would give video clips describing
the sites.You cannot make plans and give
money just by looking at the video clips.
We hope the situation improves in the
coming months,’’ said Igor Ku d ri k , a
researcher at the Bellona Fo u n d ation in
Oslo. n
