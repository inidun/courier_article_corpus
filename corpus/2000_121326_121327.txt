“I can tell any train by the noise of the wheels
European trains beat four four time, 
in Asia it’s three five or three seven”
Blaise Cendrars, Prosody of the Transsiberian and of Little Jeanne of France, 1913
(translated by John Dos Passos)

It takes more than five days to get from Beijing to Moscow through
Mongolia—no trip for the impatient.But I have always loved this journey.
At one time the departure was a solemn occasion, with deserted carriages
pulling out of the station before a row of Red Guards waving Mao’s little red
book to the strains of The East is Red. Nowadays, it is a hectic affair, with a
myriad of goods overflowing in jam-packed corridors.
As the train pulls out of the station it seems to lurch in front of the
corner tower rising on the Tartar city’s southeastern edge, a rare vestige of
the old ramparts, as if hesitating for a last time. Some travellers let their eyes
linger on the outlying neighbourhoods of China’s capital, while others begin
their adjustment to the small, slow-moving cell they will call home for the next
five days. During the journey’s first few hours, the train clatters through the
hilly northern Chinese countryside, where the Great Wall—at first well-
restored,later reduced to a state of pitiful ruin—once marked the limits of
the civilized world. Working through the landscape of loess, ochre and
gorges dotted by scrawny willow trees, the train slowly chugs up to the
Mongolian plateau.Depending on the season, the landscape rolling by is worn
down by summer rain or frozen like a rock in the dead of winter.
The train’s steady beat and the spectacle of this epic land,as fascinating
as a receding shoreline, inspires a mood of contemplation—that is until the
passengers are overcome by drowsiness caused by neither boredom nor
w e a r i n e s s,but a combination of daydreaming, r e a d i n g, c o n v e r s a t i o n ,w h i s p e r e d
secrets and treasured moments liberated from time, which seems forgotten
or at least less pressing.After Datong, further north in Mongol country, t h e
steppe stretches out monotonously to the horizon.A horseman keeping a herd
of camels and a yurt are signs of humanity in the endless space, s p a r s e l y
covered with grass in midsummer, a moonscape from November to spring.
As evening falls, darkness creeps through the train.The lights in the cars
have wiped out the outside world. In the heart of a desert that the passengers
have forgotten, a strange coziness fills the compartments. The outdated
decor in first class—worn-out velvet the colour of crushed raspberries, p i n k
ribboned shades on table-lamps next to the windows, bevelled mirrors,
imitation mahogany veneer and faded green curtains—keeps up the illusion
of past luxury.A closed world, carried by the clickety-clack of steel on steel,
advances into the night.The sleeping-car bunks are stacked three high.A weak
light shines on languid bodies dappled in shadow. Skillfully tied-up and
stacked luggage fills the rest of the space.
Ulan Bator, the Selenga valley and the shores of Lake Baikal, I r k u t s k ,
Tomsk, Novosibirsk,Sverlovsk (renamed Ekaterinenburg), the Urals. The
days go by ticking off a litany of names that turn like the train’s wheels.
From Moscow to Beijing, travellers have five days 
to indulge their nostalgia in a legendary 
journey alongside adventurers and the odd bit of illegal
trade

The Tra n s - S i b e r i a n ’s grand bazaar
“If I was a painter I’d splash a great deal of red, 
a great deal of yellow on the end of this journey
Because we must all of us have been more or less cracked
And an enormous delirium brought the blood 
out on the drawn faces of my traveling companions.
As we drew nearer Mongolia
That roared like a burning building”
Blaise Cendrars, Prosody of the Transsiberian and of Little Jeanne of France, 1913

The train’s measured pace opens the way to contemplation: here, a Russian woman from Siberia gazes out.

Changes are slow and the passengers have settled into their
h a b i t s.They return from the samovar at the end of the corridor
with faltering steps, following their daydreams, leaning their
elbows against the window; or weary of a journey that seems
endless, they play cards and chess.
The dining car changes with each country.The food’s quality
is uneven and offers a crude gastronomic tour first of China,
then Mongolia and finally Russia. But canteen or greasy-spoon,
it is part of the trip, attracting a steady flow of passengers and
adding its own touch of the exotic.The powerful smell of garlic,
the steam of boiled mutton and the bitter aroma of s o l y a n k a

and creaking axles.A t

Only a few
diplomats from east
Asia used to take the
Trans-Siberian back 
to the USSR. But in
the past few years,
the weekly train
between Beijing and
M o s c o w,which travels
by way of Mongolia or Manchuria, has been frequented by
passengers travelling for a host of different reasons. The most
common is trade,a product of shortages on the opposite side of a
b o r d e r,the resourcefulness of merchants and the flurry of peoples
who have now rediscovered bartering after years cut out of market
a c t i v i t y. There are also the “ s p e c i a l i s t s ” drawn to international
express trains, on the lookout for shady opportunities or even
ready to commit a crime. Female adventurers looking lost and
would-be immigrants who withhold their names and dream of an
elysian Europe still roam the wagons.
The further the train reaches into Siberia, the livelier the
corridors become. Train employees and passengers, all of them
C h i n e s e, unwrap cargoes including sacks of rice, bundles of
clothes and plastic utensils.The stops are few and far between,b u t
when they do come, the platform suddenly turns into one giant
b a z a a r. Rows of Russian women offer the most unexpected
i t e m s :berries from the neighbouring forests,hot potatoes, t a w d r y
l a m p s, shoes designed for discomfort. Men and women walk
across the tracks,wending their way between the cars as they carry
sacks bulging with who-knows-what. A teenager flees after
snatching a pair of trousers offered for sale by a Chinese man
leaning out of a train window. S u d d e n l y, the locomotive’s siren
puts an end to the buying and selling,and the passengers rush back
on the train, already thinking about the next stop.
And so on—until the Trans-Siberian reaches the area just
outside Moscow, rolling through villages dotted with white or
gold church towers resembling the birch trees that blanket the
Russian countryside in autumn.
The journey is a source of adventure and a muse. Isn’t
Blaise Cendrars’ Prosody of the Transsiberian one of modern
poetry’s most beautiful verses? Travelling across Asia to reach
Europe still captures the imagination. It is as if the people
roaming from one continent to another, frozen in our memories,
alone represent what is unchanging in human destiny. ■

THE WILL OF THE CZARS
The “real” Trans-Siberian travels
9,198 kilometres from Moscow to
Vladivostok.The train only runs
on Russian territory, on a line
that was finished in 1916.It was
built to double a line completed
in 1904 that the Russians
considered too unsafe after the
Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905
because it crossed Manchuria.
Today, two lines link Moscow and
Beijing. At first,they follow 
the Trans-Siberian route before
forking southward, one through
Manchuria,the other through
Mongolia.
