EZEKIEL MPHAHLELE, taught
English and Afrikaans in a
Johannesburg high school until
1957 when he emigrated to
Nigeria. There he taught Eng¬
lish language and literature
in the Department of Extra-
Mural Studies at the University
of Ibadan. He now lectures in
English Literature at University
College, Nairobi (Kenya). His
short stories include two volu¬
mes "Man Must Live" (Cape
Town 1947) and "The Living
and the Dead" (Black Orpheus,
Ibadan, 1960). His autobiogra¬
phy, "Down Second Avenue"
(Faber and Faber, London,
1959) has been translated into
eight languages.
IN June 1962 a conference
of African writers of English expres¬
sion was held at Makerere University
College in Kampala, Uganda. The
conference had been called by Mbari
Writers' and Artists' Club of Ibadan,
sponsored by the Congress for Cultu¬
ral Freedom in Paris. This was the
first get-together of its kind ever to
be held anywhere in the world.
Top on the list of questions posed
and examined about the African
authors' practical problems was the
not-so-practical one: what constitutes
African writing? There was an atmo¬
sphere of general surprise, just as if
the phrase we had used, tossed about,
identified certain things by, had sud¬
denly got out of hand and turned
against us with a vengeance.
Had the phrase "African writing"
been misused or abused, after all?
Some participants tried to dismiss the
question as academic; others felt
annoyed; others again tried to laugh
it off or explain it away. But even after
the more serious attempts to define
African writing, it stayed on like a
stubborn white spot on black linen.
It was generally agreed, rather
implicitly than explicitly, that we were
defining such writing in its simplest,
because emotional, terms: as writing
produced by black Africans. On reflec¬
tion, certain questions leap up with
irritating insistence: what about writ¬
ing produced by white Africans? What
distinguishes so-called African writing
from non-African? What, for example,
distinguishes a work by Joyce Cary
Left, "flying fish", two
modern metallic sculptures by M. Calka
which stand close to
the Haile Selassie Theatre,
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

(not African-born) from that by Dan
Jacobson (African-born) or a work by
Nadine Gordimer (white South African)
from one by Thomas Mafolo (South
African Negro)? Is it theme or style
or both, or tone or point of view that
one goes by?
Joyce Cary was a greater writer than
any of these whites using the African
scene, and it is quite clear that he
identifies himself with neither the
whites nor the blacks in his novels.
He writes with a masterly detachment.
There is a degree of identification in
which a white writer in Africa like
Mr. Paton or Miss Gordimer stands in
relation to the characters and setting
of his or her stories which indicates
whether either of them is African.
In both cases, one can distinctly
tell that they are on the white side
of the colour line. For their identifica¬
tion is stronger with the white char¬
acters than with the black.
This identification is a much closer
and more intimate relationship than
the mere espousal of a cause which
one's characters uphold in the
context of a story; in other words,
it is not just sympathy. It is
a matter of belongingness in relation
to the group represented by one
section of characters one is portraying
and the habitat of that group. What
holds good for the white writer is true
in the case of the black one in his
segregated world.
This is the distinction between a non-
African white writer and a white African
writer on the one hand, and between
a white and a black African writer on
the other.
When we talk of African English writ¬
ing then, I suggest we cannot help
but discuss literature coming from both
black and white in the continent. And
by "black" I am including African
Arabs. But if I insist on the cultural
context in which we use the phrase, I
should then take in writing by black
Africans south of the Sahara, leaving
out both whites and Arabs.
It is in this context that Mbari
summoned the writers to Makerere.
For the artistic problems facing the
South African Negro just to take a
country that has a plural society are
not the same as those confronting the
white South African: there is little inter¬
course between them, although the
paint from the one has rubbed off on
to the other.
But there are certain sets of values
common to so many African ethnic
groups that some South African
Negroes, say, would not find it difficult
to enter into the feeling and mood of
Chinua Achebe's story in Things Fall
Apart. I say some with hesitation
because I cannot say for sure that the
most urbanized African in South Africa
would easily appreciate the story.
But even if, because of the diversity
of our colonial experience in Africa,
and because of our ethnic differences,
we often find that we do not speak
on the same wave-length, this very
colonial experience, the common feel¬
ing among African Negroes that we
are saying things for ourselves about
ourselves which used to be the mono¬
poly of the white missionary, the
anthropologist, the white explorer, and
even the white administrator these
things are sufficient to make all African
Ixügroes respond to the sound of a
bell that calls "African writers" to an
assembly.
And the phrase ."African writing" still
has a strongly emotional content. A
white writer might respond intellectual¬
ly, not emotionally, as the blacks do to
the bell: he is most likely to argue
himself into such a meeting by saying
that he is African. Again, there are
two distinct streams of literary culture

AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued)
Committed' and 'Uncommitted' writers
26
and consciousness in Africa represent¬
ing black and white respectively.
Our contact with whites has given
birth to a neo-African culture. We can
really only speak of neo-African culture
to define the content arising from the
contact between Western and African
cultures, rather than the quality or
intensity of expression; or, as someone
suggests, the degree of passion in it.
It expresses itself in many voices and
modes, as can be seen in South African
writing and music as distinct from those
of West and East Africa. Vernacular
writing in Africa is unequivocally Afri¬
can in the present context.
African literary forms in English and
French should in fact be studied in
the relevant language department.
John Pepper Clark's, Efua Sutherland's
and Gabriel Okara's poetry, Wole
Soyinka's plays, Richard Rive's and
Alex la Guma's fiction and so on
should be part of the normal English
course. So should Birago and David
Diop's, Senghor's, and Tamsi's poetry,
Cámara Laye's, Mongo Beti's and Fer¬
dinand Oyono's fiction be studied side
by side with Flaubert, Baudelaire, Rim¬
baud and so on in the department of
French. Here African writing is meant
to be treated simply as literature in
Africa, and each work will be judged
on its literary merits.
It is common for the sociologist to
disregard literary merit when he is
doing research into creative writing.
As a scientist, he rightly argues that it
is not his business to give an opinion
on the literary qualities of a book, any
more than is Wordsworth's interest in
dissecting flowers reflected in his
poem, Daffodils.
In his scholarly book Culture and
Society, 1780-1950, Raymond Williams
does not enlist the tools of literary cri¬
ticism for its own sake and then go on
to establish incidentally the place in
the tradition of English culture of
Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold,
T. S. Eliot and so on, on the basis of
their creative work. And yet he is, as
he puts it, "committed to the study of
actual language: that is to say, to the
words and sequences of words" used
by the writers and thinkers to express
themselves on culture. Mr. Williams's
samples are either prose statements
or talkative verse.
It is significant that there is much
more creative writing than scholarly
prose by Negroes in Africa. Perhaps
it is because a poem or short story or
a novel are so close to individual expe¬
rience, and therefore more natural
modes of expression than argumenta¬
tive prose; and, further, because intel¬
lectual systems and the arguments
involved are not native to Africa. Dis¬
cussion for its own sake or to formulate
systems of thought in Africa are a
derivative occupation.
It is because one learns so much
about the African from his poetry and
fiction, e.g: traditional culture and cul¬
ture conflicts and their reconciliation
or consolidation, that a few over-
enthusiastic Africanists often sneak
into the realm of literary judgments
through the back-door. An African
novelist or poet is often raised shoul¬
der high for what is taken for literary
excellence, when all a sociologist
wants to say of a particular work is
that it is illuminating or revealing in
social comment.
Especially is this the case where a
non-African views an African work;
what begins as a natural and perhaps
even reasonable humility in the contem-
plator ends up in self-abasement and
woolly thinking. Often it is a self-aba¬
sement that is symbolized with such
devastating irony by Cámara Laye in
his brilliant novel Le Regard du Roi
(translated into English under the title
The Radiance of the King) when he
portrays Clarence, the white man,
trembling before the African king,
afraid to approach, out of a misplaced
European sense of sin and shame.
But there is much in African writing
to inform the sociologist who has a
feel for language: especially so be¬
cause there are no literary modes set
by a local tradition. The modes are
still as foreign as can be expected
of a tradition that has originated in the
metropolitan centres of the former colo¬
nial authority, or is originated by a for¬
eign educator. There is, for example, a
clear distinction between South African
Negro and West African writing on the
one hand, and between the literature
of the English-speaking and French-
speaking communities on the other:
the diction, rhythms, and themes found
in one region are not common in
another.
IN a short story, The Bench
(1), Richard Rive, a Cape Town colour¬
ed writer, tells us about a young man,
Karlie, who wants to defy the law by
sitting on a bench marked "Europeans
Only". He has been listening to a
political speech and is fired with the
zeal to challenge the system that
segregates people according to colour.
He will sit on the forbidden bench as
an act of challenge and therefore one
of becoming a man.
Abioseh Nicol, the Sierra Leonean
short-story writer, tells in his As the
Night, the Day (2), of a student who
breaks a thermometer in a laboratory.
Another student is made to bear the
blame and is punished. In his bed¬
room in the night the student writes in
shame and resolves to confess the
deed to the teacher. For him, also,

Rutherford (Faith Press, London).

(Gollancz, London).
this will be an act of becoming a man.
Here are the relevant extracts, the
first from Rive's story followed by
Nicol's:
Here was his chance, the bench.
The railway bench with the legend
'Europeans Only' neatly painted on
it in white. For one moment it sym¬
bolised all the misery of the plural
South African society. Here was a
challenge to his rights as a man . . .
That bench, now, had concentrated
in it all the evils of a system he
could not understand. It was an
obstacle between himself and huma¬
nity. If he sat on it he was a man.
If he was afraid he denied himself
membership as a human in a human
society. Here was his chance . . .
He seemed perfectly calm when he
sat down on the bench, but inside
his heart was thumping wildly. Two
conflicting ideas throbbed through
him. The one said, 7 have no right
to sit on this bench'; the other said,
'Why have I no right to sit on this
bench?' The one voice spoke of the
past, of the servile position he had
oocupied on the farms, of his father
and his father's father who were
born black, lived like blacks and
died like oxen . . .
Suddenly, in his little room, under
his thin cotton sheet, he began to
cry. Because he felt the sharp lanc¬
ing pain already cutting into him.
Because of Basu and Simpson and
the thermometer. For all the things
he wanted to do and which would
never happen. For all the good men
they had told them about, Jesus
Christ, Mohammed, and George
Washington who never told a lie.
For Florence Nightingale and David
Livingstone. For Kagawa, the Japa¬
nese man, for Gandhi and for
Kwegyir Aggrey, the African.
Oh-ee. Because he knew he would
never be as straight and strong
and true as the school song said
they should be. He saw, for the
first time, what this thing would be
like, becoming a man. He touched
the edge of an inconsolable eternal
grief. Oh-ee, oh-ee; always, he felt,
always I shall be a disgrace to the
nation and the race.
It is a fact of social history that the
South African character's field of refe¬
rence in the story has a concrete
physical meaning, and evokes a sense
of immediacy: "That of his - father,
his father's father who were born black,
lived like blacks and died like oxen."
The West African character's field of
reference is not so immediate, and is
conceived in abstract terms.
In the South African case, there is
the ever-present condition of oppres¬
sion which releases acute mental and
physical agony. The writer feels com¬
mitted. Through his impressionistic
style, in his anger, impatience, through
the sensuous imagery that he evokes,

From "Ibrahim El Salahl" Mbari Publications,
Ibadan, 1962
In Africa, an ancient world of the arts,
painters and sculptors in every country
are creating new forms of expression
in the visual arts. In many cases
these artists succeed in combining
traditional African styles with the latest
research and techniques in art. This
drawing is by Ibrahim Salahi, a young
Sudanese artist who, after studying
at London's Slade School of Art,
settled in Khartoum. Characteristic
of his work is his use of two
traditional art forms: Arab calligraphy
and the decorative pattern designs
on Sudanese baskets and calabashes.
and the rhythm that reveals a sense
of urgency, he is trying to come to
terms with himself and his environ¬
ment, to reject the status quo even
while he has often to relent in order to
allow the load to sit easier on his
shoulder. And this attempt to recon¬
cile disparate emotions helps him,
paradoxically enough, to retain his
sanity, to survive.
On the West African side, things are
much easier, more leisurely, there is
more sky, no claustrophobia, and the
writer can conceive his fictional char¬
acters within the broader context m
which less immediate and less urgent
thoughts operate. The rhythm, tempo
and texture of the prose and the
writer's mood do not display any sense
of urgency, nor sensuous intensity.
This is no value judgment but a state¬
ment of fact. For Abioseh Nicol is one
of the best prose writers in Africa,
certainly the best in West Africa, using
English.
In West Africa alone, English and
French writing move along different
tracks, particularly in the realm of
poetry. The Nigerian poet talks about
things as they affect him personally
and immediately. He is not protesting
or trying to vindicate his blackness.
The French-speaking poet, however,
particularly of the négritude school (I
do not know any who is not of it or
influenced by it) uses broad symbols
in which immediacy of individual
experience is not the important thing.
These are symbols of Africa, of
blackness, of what is regarded by the
poet as African traits which are ex¬
pected to be a unifying force not
only for the people of the continent
but for the Negro world in general.
Let us look at Leopold Sedar
Senghor's, Prayer to Masks (1):
Masks! Oh Masks!
Black mask, red mask, you black and
white masks,
Rectangular masks through' whom the
spirit breathes,
I greet you in silence!
And you too, my pantherheaded
ancestor,
You guard this place, that is closed
to any feminine laughter, to any
mortal smile.
You purify the air of eternity, here
where I breathe the air of my father.
Masks of maskless faces, free from
dimples and wrinkles,
You have composed this ¡mage, this
my face that bends over the altar of
white paper.
In the name of your image, listen to me'
Now while the Africa of despotism is
dying, it is the agony of a pitiable
princess
Just like Europe to whom she is
connected through the navel,
Now turn your immobile eyes towards
your children who
Have been called
And who sacrifice their lives like the
man his last garment
So that hereafter we may cry 'hero' at
the rebirth of the world being the
leaven that the white flour needs.
For who would else teach rhythm to
the world that has died of machines
and cannon?
For who else should ejaculate the cry
of joy, that arouses the dead and the
wise in a new dawn?
Say, who else would return the memory
of .life to men with a torn hope?
They call us cotton heads, and coffee
men, and oily men,
They call us men of death.
But we are the men of the dance whose
feet only gain power when they beat
the hard soil.
There is nobility of tone and feeling
in Senghor's poem. The masks are n
jumping-off ground for him to point to
the defects of Europe and its civiliza¬
tion and to the revered features of
African culture. The poet's feeling is
diffused over a wide area. The repre¬
sentative images in the poem are those
that turn around "You purify the air of
eternity". And we know when we read
it that we shall never really grasp the
prose meaning of the sentence: it leaps
from our grip into the metaphysical
world.
The individual is not important here,
but the object of adoration as a broad
symbol of what is often called "the
African essence".
Efua Sutherland is the most out¬
standing poet in Ghana and almost the
only highly individualistic writer in her
country. The rest of the poets in
Ghana express nationalist sentiments
and revive old hurts like slavery, and
so on. In a poem, Redeemed, Mrs.
Sutherland shows a sense of urgency
and individuality typical of the Nigerian
poets. A man wants to bring to her
knees a beautiful woman, and crusn
her as a poisonous snake destroys
good things. He smells the Eve
(woman's natural weakness) in her.
But he is afraid and he recoils, over¬
whelmed by her beauty. The prota¬
gonist says:
Love I the pillar of your neck
Governing like a marvel
The balance of the load of your head,
Yet I must break it.
Love I the shine of your skin,
Yet I must dull it.
With leprous venom from my spleen.
He stops short in his designs:
She paused in a pace, and turned on me
A soul that speared my reptile frame
Until I writhed in a helpless coil
And the poison in me did boil
And clot in the glare
From the splendour of her redeemed
[soul.

IT is a matter of interest
that even after political independence,
when colonialism has departed, some
poets still hammer on the theme of
African-ness and want to vindicate
their dignity as Negroes. Are we never
going to know what the peasant' feels
and thinks as he teeters on the edge
of a revolution which demands a
change in his whole mode of living
because his subsistence economy is
unproductive? Isn't there something
to tell about that young man pathetic
and comi-tragic who interprets the
words of politicians letter for letter
and thinks that he is called upon to
strike an attitude of chauvinism,
entangling himself in all its vocabu¬
lary in the process, never realizing that
he is out of step with the aspirations
of his government? How long are our 0"T
poets going to continue bleating like ¿. |
a goat in the crisis of giving birth?

AFRICAN LITERATURE (Continued)
that African literature should be treated
as part of world literature, and not as
something specially African; that there
is in reality only good and bad and
mediocre writing, whether African,
Chinese, Mexican and so on; that there
is a real danger in looking at African
writing merely as the sociologist's gold
mine. The danger lies in the fact that
the number of "bleatniks" will increase
when more of us turn out sociological
verse and fiction, simply as fodder for
the Africanist. It is a transitory phase,
for sure, but it js depressing all the
same.
But I have also said that even the
best of our writing in Africa reflects a
strong sense of social realism. If, as
is happening already, African literature
is used in African Studies because it
affords the student a glimpse of an
African's personality in a given social
climate a glimpse he cannot find
elsewhere due to the paucity of schol¬
astic writings by Africans then the
sociologist has to go through the mo¬
tions of literary examination such as I
have intimated earlier on. Rhythm,
imagery, diction are just as relevant to
his study as mere theme.
IN an ideal situation only
vernacular writing belongs in a depart¬
ment of African Studies. In South
African universities, even the ones
regarded as entirely or predominantly
"white", the three main Bantu lan¬
guages and a fourth minority one have
been subjects for research and teach¬
ing for at least thirty years, but have
been media for creative and journalistic
writing since the middle of the nine¬
teenth century.
It is hoped that the department of
African Studies in each university that
has one will try to stimulate verna¬
cular-literature in this way, among
others. Above all, it is considered that
vernacular writers should also take
part in workshops for those writing in
English or French. There are after
all individual techniques in creative
writing applicable to all languages.
And if vernacular writers are brought
into the workshops, they will realize
that theirs is not an activity apart from
the mainstream.
Furthermore, it is important that wri¬
ters in our indigenous languages out¬
grow the school-book mentality by
which they evidently regard a piece of
writing as important only if it can be
understood by school children. Why
should we not produce a novel in
Hausa or Swahili or Twi or Ibo or
Yoruba which has adult ideas and can
stand critical analysis side by side
with the fiction of Western and Eas¬
tern languages?
There are South Africans like A. C.
Jordan, whose Xhosa novel is a classic,
Thomas Mofólo, whose Sotho novel,
Chaka, is also a classic and has been
translated into English and German;
Makalo Khaketla and B. Vilakazi have
done well in their languages. Even
so, several other vernacular writers in
South Africa are being published by a
pro-government white press, which
seeks to supply literature for school
use: quite a lucrative racket. The first
task of an institute of African Studies
is to correct this senseless if under¬
standable trend.
Before we were invaded by a money
economy, by industries which claimed
enormous migrant labour, the African's
activities were guided by a moral or
immoral purpose, depending on whe¬
ther one deviated from the wishes of
the group or not. Culture was not
separate from anything, comprising
processes which we could speak of
as a "human court of appeal". Culture
was life; each phase marked by initia¬
tion ceremonies was an organic part of
man's education and moral growth.
But now mass media like TV, the press,
advertising, radio, political speechi¬
fying and pamphleteering, world lite¬
rature all these are battering at our
sense of values. Folk cultures are
giving way to urban cultures. And we
find ourselves asking ourselves: where
is the "human court of appeal" to help
us avoid the awful blunders Europe has
gone and is going through.
Some of us feel that we need to
evoke the essence of human relations
which is part of our African-ness. And
some of us build up myths about traits
in the African as a race. And we seem
to be asserting features of a culture we
are not living any more, asserting them
even while we are in Western metro¬
politan centres taking part in their
culture. We even refuse to see our
literature as part of Western tradition,
and like to believe that we are writing
in a style that is peculiarly Negro.
We seem to be losing sight of
culture as an interpretation of a whole
way of life, of a common experience.
We seem to forget that our neo-
African culture, by its very nature, is
going to absorb much more of Euro¬
pean techniques a process that
should not worry us, really: our writ¬
ing can only be valid if it interprets
contemporary society in a mode of
expression that hits on the intellectual,
emotional and physical planes bf
meaning. What more can you ask of
a writer, of an artist, of a musician?
In conclusion, it seems necessary to
warn against the danger of thinking
that because we are Africans, we
should write about the same things and
adopt the same styles or points of view.
Culture interests itself in stimulating
and promoting creative and intellectual
impulses. It interests itself in indivi¬
dual and communal activity. For this
reason we should allow culture to
flourish out of the local needs of a
community.
Culture should be something to be
lived rather than merely talked about.
