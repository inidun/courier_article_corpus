A
century has passed since
Rubén Darío was born In a little town
in Central America and during those
hundred years, the child born in
Metapa, Nicaragua, has become the
most celebrated poet of the Spanish-
speaking world, triumphing on both
sides of the Atlantic, and dying at the
height of his fame to become immortal
in his verse, with the other great
Spanish poets. During those hundred
years, the antiquated, provincial poetry
of a whole continent was changed by
the force of his genius into the new,
vigorous poetry of a score of modern
peoples.
When Dario was born, Nicaraguan
poetry was practically non-existent,
Spanish American poetry was known
in Spain only to the erudite, the
poetry of Spain itself was dying under
the weight of tradition, lassitude and
repetition. Darío changed all that in
the space of a few years. Striding
from Nicaragua to Santiago de Chile,
from Chile to Buenos Aires, from the
shores of the Plata to Madrid,
Darío took the provincial, wandering,
sluggish stream of verse and trans¬
formed it to a pure current which sings
and dances, flaunts its native or bor¬
rowed brilliance, and delights in its
own distinctive music. That music is
still to be heard.
The success of Dario's first notable
works, from Azul ... to Los raros
and Prosas profanas, in the torpid
years of the late nineteenth century,
scored a victory for the refinements
of a literature that was deliberately
and unashamedly literary. Darío (the
Spanish American) sang to the mar¬
quises and princesses of Versailles,
delighted in the' play of words, was
shockingly frivolous.
It was a gentle air, of slow
[measures:
the Fairy Harmony timed its
[cadences,
and half-formed phrases and gentle
[sighs
mingled with the sobs of the
['cellos (1).
EMIR RODRIGUEZ MONEGAL, a Uruguyan
writer and journalist, is director of "Mundo
Nuevo" (New World) a Spanish language
literary review published in Paris. He was
formerly professor of literature at the Uni¬
versity of Montevideo.
It is a joy to follow the Intricacies
of the lines which echo with the
rippling laughter of the Marquesa
Eulalia. With these and other poems,
Darío came to symbolize the emulation
of all poets in the New World for the
elegance and refinement of the
modernists.
At that time, Paris was the capital
of their frivolous, luxurious world:
Dario's poetry mirrored as closely as
it could the lustre of Paris. Many
eminent critics reproached him for
his gallic mentality, and bade him
(with a certain solemn officiousness)
return to his own country to describe
"the girls of his village," and try to
forget Paris "where he had spent
perhaps two or three weeks in his
life."
Other critics maintained, on similar
grounds, that Dario was not the bard
of Spanish America, but merely an
uprooted foreigner. Many viewed his
poetry as a mere projection of Ver¬
laine and Leconte de Lisle, a strained
adaptation of the inventions of Poe
or Mallarmé, the frothy tribute of an
admirer of French exoticism. As a
great Spanish writer put it: "In Darío,
you can see the Indian feathers
showing under his hat," implying that
he, like the Indians, was dazzled by
the latest European notions.
But the unjust quip of the great
Don Miguel de Unamuno touches only
the superficial Darío. His visits to
Paris, his active Involvement with the
diplomatic world, his thirst for luxury
and worldly success, seemed to justify
such strictures. Darío gave the
impression of being the typical Latin
American poet, stifling in our rude
lands, who cannot abide the "crass
municipal" populace (as he once
called it), and has no aptitude for
paying tribute to a new-born demo¬
cracy or a President of a Republic.
This incomplete, synthetic, fanciful
image was thus imposed on many
critics and readers. Darío himself
gave it currency, with a mixture of
amusement and childish impudence.
He wished to outdo the subtle in
subtlely, explore the farthest bounds
(1) Era un aire suave, de pausados giros:
el Hada Armonía ritmaba sus vuelos,
e iban frases vagas y tenues suspiros
entre los sollozos de los violoncelos.
of the decadent civilization of his time,
and he loved to scandalize the worthy
bourgeoisie of Latin America. He
wrote defiantly in his introduction to
Prosas profanas:
"Is there a drop of African, Cho-
rotegan or Nagrandanian Indian
blood In my veins? There may be,
in spite of my aristocrat's hand;
but Io! my verses sing of princesses,
kings, empires, visions of far-off or
impossible countries. What would
you? . I detest the life and times
I chanced to be born to; and I can¬
not acclaim a President of the Repu¬
blic in the tongue in which I would
sing to thee, O Halagaball whose
court of gold, silk and marble I visit
in my dreams ..."
I
hose who regarded Darío
as a mere imitator of the French school
overlooked his other achievements,
which were perhaps more important
than the trivial aping of Verlaine or
Banville. Darío came to Latin Amer¬
ican literature at the critical moment
in the development of a new cultural
tradition. For nearly a century, that
literature had been struggling to attain
an identity to match the continent's
political independence. The romantics
(who flourished practically throughout
the nineteenth century) were suc¬
ceeded by the "fin-de-siècle" poets,
who struck the first blows, in their
separate countries, for more subtle
and flexible verse, freer utterance,
newer and bolder images.
They were Mexican, like Salvador
Díaz Mirón and Manuel Gutiérrez
Nájera, Cuban, like Julián del Casal
and José Martí, Colombian like José
Asunción Silva or Salvadorian like
Francisco Gavidia. Each played his
, part in renovating the Spanish lan¬
guage and Spanish verse; but the only
one who was acquainted with them
all, learnt from them all and surpassed
them all was Rubén Darío.
Genius that he was, he absorbed
the spirit of different generations of __
poets and fused their many tongues J*\
into the unique, matchless, highly ^
distinctive voice of one poet: Rubén
Darío. This was his first feat: to

RUBEN DARIO (Continued)
The birth of a new idiom :
the haunting music of the soul
convert the speech of a scattered tribe
into an individual poetic utterance.
His second feat was equal to the
first: he succeeded» in imbuing other,
younger poets with the new spirit;
his genius embodied it in a language
common to a whole rising generation.
It was shaped in Santiago de Chile,
spread to Buenos Aires, and triumphed
in Madrid. Darío returned to the
fountain-head (like a modern conquis¬
tador whose caravels were to reverse
the course of history); he came to
Spain to restore to its poetry and
language the life, force and grace
which they lacked.
The younger Spanish poets were
the first to acknowledge the master,
and joyfully harnessed themselves to
his triumphal chariot. Antonio Ma¬
chado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Ramón
del Valle Inclán, adopted this Latin
American as their guide and paid
homage to him in their verses.
Before Darío came on the scene,
these young poets were gagged by
the prevailing mediocrity. Then Darío
sauntered in smiling, to open new
vistas, lighten the prose, electrify the
verse.
What Darío, the "Indian", brought to
Spain was not the gallic idiom, as the
older critics complained, but the
modern idiom: a new idiom of his own
invention, and yet as old as the lan¬
guage spoken in Spain at the conquest
of the New World; the speech he learnt
as a child in Nicaragua, sharing the
same roots with all its sister langua¬
ges; the Spanish American tongue.

ario came home like the
prodigal son, with no riches but his
words. He thus returned to the source,
and brought the mother country the
language preserved in America by the
sons of the conquistadors. The
treasures displayed by this "Indian"
were intangible, yet they were a
precious cargo: each word was new,
and yet immeasurably old.
Those who still accused him of
triviality did not look below the
iridescent surface of his verse. In
truth; Darío is much more earnest
than he seems, and the poet's
fundamental gravity underlies many of
his poems about flirtatious Marquises
and sorrowful princesses. He loved
to juggle with lines, rhythms and
rhymes, but behind the façade lay a
passionate, tragic soul.
His passionate side was obvious
and easy to copy. His gallant exploits
went the round of the literati; they
all knew of his escapades, his mar¬
riages, his many muses of flesh and
blood. And there was much talk of
his artificial paradises. The legends
were no doubt exaggerated, but the
poet's fame was not solely compound
ed of truth; falsehood also played
its part.
In reality, Dario was no Don Juan:
he was a headstrong, vulnerable man,
who could be possessed or even
swept away by love. Any number of
his poems, singing of the joy and
sorrow of love, are familiar to all
admirers of poetry. He once con¬
fessed:
Like an unbridled colt my instincts
[galloped;
My youth rode an unbridled colt;
Intoxicated, with a dagger at the
[waist;
If I did not come to grief, it was by
[God's good grace.
In my garden stood a beautiful
[statue;
It seemed of marble, but was of
[living flesh ;
A youthful soul within,
Sentimental, sensitive, sensuous (2).
For many years, readers and critics
closed their eyes to any image of
Darío but that of the victor, spending
his life in the pursuit of pleasure and
the capture of applause. But another,
very different image lay behind.
Masked by the harmony of this verses
is a poet who suffers and is dying
by inches. One of his most haunting
poems brings us face to face with
the reality: it shows him clinging to
life, passionately hugging it, while
Death inexorably draws near. The
poem is Lo fatal (The Inevitable).
Happy the tree almost bereft of
[feeling;
Happier still the rock, impenetrable,
[insensitive;
No greater pain than that of being
[alive;
No greater sorrow than to live and
[feel.
To exist and to know nothing, to
[have no set course;
To tremble at the thought of life's
[quick ebb,
And the terrifying certainty of death
[tomorrow;
To suffer for life and for the
[shadow.
For the unknown or the dimly
[conjectured;
To feel the temptations of the
[flesh, sweet and tendril-like,
And the cold tomb crowned with
[funeral wreaths,
And not to know where we are
[bound, nor whence we came . . . I (3)
His biographers explain that at
that time, Dario was disintegrating
physicaly, drinking himself to death,
dissolving into nothingness, a process
sublimated Into pure poetry. Darío
had discovered that the flesh is stub¬
born and does not want to die, and
that the infinite patience of Death is
a pure fiction. Death consumes us
implacably day by day; Death shapes
and overshadows our lives. And in
his verses even the best, the most
mournfully melodious he is tracing
the progress of Death's invasion and
victory.
Thus, Dario's third great feat was
to attain this profound insight for the
Spanish and American verse of his
time. Like every authentic creator,
Dario was constantly at odds with his
time. The conflict had its vicissitudes,
periods of peace and even sudden
gleams of cheerful harmony; but every
victory in the long struggle compro¬
mised his closest links with his envi¬
ronment.
A
t one time, the Spanish
language seemed threatened by his
gallicisms and thirst for modernity. At
other times, bourgeois conventions
were endangered by the white-hot
passion of his poetry. He sometimes
offended the most sensitive political
susceptibilities, which can influence
the destiny of a whole continent.
For that reason he lived much of his
life as a fugitive. Although firmly
rooted in the land and language of his
childhood, although he had covered
the whole of Latin America in his
triumphal progress, Darío lived a large
part of his life in exile in Paris, and
became a cosmopolitan. Only thus
could he become still more deeply,
more tragically Spanish American.
Up to the very end of his life he
took no respite, but went on seeking
and fighting. Death, which finally
vanquished him one day in 1916, did
not have an easy victory. The poet
refused to yield an inch without a
struggle, a cry, a lament. Long after
his death, his poetry (and the poet's
aspirations) live on.
(2) Potro sin freno se lanzó mi instinto,
mi juventud montó potro sin freno;
iba embriagada y con puñal al cinto,
si no cayó, fue porque Dios es bueno.
En mi jardín se vio una estatua bella;
se juzgó mármol y era carne viva;
una alma joven habitaba en ella,
sentimental, sensible y sensitiva.
(3) Dichoso el árbol que es apenas sensitivo,
y más la piedra dura, porque ésta ya no
[siente
pues no hay dolor más grande que el
[dolor de ser vivo,
ni mayor pesadumbre que la vida cons¬
ciente.
Ser, y no saber nada, y ser sin rumbo
[cierto,
y el temor de haber sido y un futuro
[terror...
y el espanto seguro de estar mañana
[muerto,
y sufrir por la vida, y por la sombra y
[por
lo que no conocemos y apenas sospe¬
chamos,
y la carne que tienta con sus frescos
[racimos
y la tumba que aguarda con sus fúnebres
[ramos,
y no saber adonde vamos,
ni de dónde venimos...!
