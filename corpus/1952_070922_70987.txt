Island villages on Lake Patzcuaro are among those in which the Centre's
students are working. Here their main task is to help the islanders to solve the
economic problems which are the result of an ever-dwindling supply of fish.
REPORT ON
PATZCUARO
One of the world's most unusual
social experiments,
IN addition to its famed sceneryand Friday market, the Mexi-
can town of Patzcuaro recently
acquired a third distinction. It has
become the headquarters of one of
the world's most unusual social
experiments. As its"laboratory,"
the experiment has 18 villages
framed by the scenery of Michoa-
can and peopled by the bronzed
descendants of Tarascan Indians
who are still more attached to their
own musical language than to the
Spanish of the rest of the country.
Six thousand feet up among the
hills of the plateau, and only slightly
above the incredibly blue lake,
Patzcuaro is one of the most exotic
of Mexican towns. Its market, en-
closed by motley colonial arcades,
has been a meeting place for cen-
turies. On Friday mornings, long
before sunrise, Tarascans with
their wives and children, in crowd-
ed ancient buses, on muleback, or
simply on foot, come along the
winding road leading from the lake
to the town. Old and young, all
carry their heavy burden of things
produced during the week. It is
on this day that they have to
exchange the products of their tra-
ditional skills for the coins that
will buy them the necessities of a
rigidly simple life for the rest of
the week.
By ten in the morning the square
is crowded with people. Baskets and
fruits, sashes and serapes, fish and
fishing-nets, pottery and straw som-
breros are on display. Among the
pyramids of colour, of restless poul-
try and frolicking children, there
is also the open-air apothecary's
stall, displaying its strange assort-
ment of dried sea-urchins, alligator
heads, earths and herbs, surrounded
by Tibor MENDE
THIS is the second in a series of articles on Latin America by TiborMende, author and journalist, who recently visited Central and South
America on assignment for Unesco. In last month's Courier,
Mr. Mende reported on Unesco's pilot project in education in the Marbial
Valley of Haiti. Below, he tells of his visit to Patzcuaro, in the State of Michoa-
can, Mexico. Here on May 9, 1951, Unesco and the Organization of American
States launched the first regional centre to train leaders of teachers of funda-
mental education for Latin America. The Patzcuaro centre is a workshop
producing men and tools to be used for creating similar workshops elsewhere
in Latin America. The fifty teachers Patzcuaro trained last year cannot by
themselves do much to reduce Latin American illiteracy or to alleviate the
poverty that accompanies it. But they are the beginning of a chain process
of teaching other teachers, which gradually will provide the human and mate-
rial means of coping with the problem. This is the key to the existence of
Patzcuaro, and also to the network of regional education centres Unesco is
setting up throughout the world.
by dancing masks and a thousand
other exciting things.
In this orgy of sunshine and
colour and the babble of voices
rising over the foliage of the trees,
there mingle the sorrows and hopes
of a people who have been by-
passed by mankind's technological
advance. Their lives and desires,
so pathetically centred around this
place of exchange, are slowly adapt-
ing themselves to another focus of
their activities. It is less colour-
ful, of less immediate benefit but,
in the long run, of even greater
significance.
On their way back to the little
pier where their quaint dug-out
canoes are waiting, they pass a gate
with a simple notice nailed over it :
"International Territory-United
Nations."Behind the gate are the
Headquarters of CREFAL (Centre
Regional de Educación Fundamental
de America Latina), Latin America's
first training centre for rural edu-
cators, set up by Unesco. From its
windows, looking out across the
lake, one can see the"laboratory,"
the villages of the Tarascans.
In less than half-an-hour one is
across to the first island. Janitzio
is a village of less than 1, 500 souls,
situated in the middle of the lake.
Here a team of Unesco students
pays a daily visit. Only a small
section of the path leading up to
the hill is paved..
Old men with wrinkled faces sit
in the sun and repair their fishing-
nets. Old and young women spread
the tiny fish on the ground to dry
them in the sun. Children stretch
the nets between branches of the
trees, and a small boy is asleep in a
big cardboard box, while his mother
is mending nets.
The lives of the people of Janit-
zio are centred around fishing.
When the conquering Spaniards
subdued the proud Tarascans, the
King of Spain sent a bishop to take
care of their affairs. Vasco de
Quiroga, the man on whom his
choice fell, began to organize the
people around'he lake and two teach
them crafts. He èhoSß a different
one for each village, and these av
been passed on from generation to
generation.
Janitzio's people have been living
on fishing for centuries, and it is
their privilege to take the famed
pescado blanco or white fish to the
Friday market. They do no basket-
making or pottery, but, like all the
other villages, just slick to their
own trade.
It is this strange status quo, this
centuries-old gentlemen's agreement
between the villages of the lake,
that provides the basic background
to the"laboratory"of 18 villages.
To improve the lives of the villag-
ers is possible only by respecting
this status quo and working within
the framework of their traditional
occupations. For, to achieve last-
ing improvements, projects have to
be organized and carried out by the
inhabitants themselves.
Up, behind the church, there is
a tiny plateau and a group of young
fishermen are working on it, shovel
in hand. Our Unesco team-a
Haitian girl and a young man from
San Salvador-are greeted like
old friends. Instead of the custom-
ary siesta, these fishermen are
putting in their few hours mixing
concrete and spreading it across the
tittle square.
"It will be the finest sports
ground in Michoaean."declares AI-
fouzo Vargas, one of the working
team."n cost 300 pesos... and do

lage has contributed ?" he says with

pride, and explains that they have
to hurry sup because the rest of the
road leading-up from the pier will
also have to be paved by Christmas.
"It's all voluntary work,"Vargas
says,"we all have only a few hours
each dav... after wall. the lake comes
first..."and he looks out over the
blue crater that for centuries has
provided the livelihood of Janitzio.
Meanwhile, the Haitian girl has
drifted away and she is
discussing with an old
woman how the fish
could be dried with less
effort and in a more
hygienic fashion. Var-
gas and his fellows are
in agitated discussion
with the young teacher
from San Salvador
about the price of ce-
ment and how a little
could be saved to repair
the cracked wall of the
church.
One of them brings up
an old project of pub-
lishing a mall guide-
book to explain to visit-
ing tourists the mural
paintings inside the
giant Morelos statue on
the top of the hill.
"From the sales of the
booklet we might buy a
small canning machine
and preserve our fish,"
one of the bovs re-
marks. The others look
sceptical.
"It's up to us,"Var-
gas retorts,"we have
to think of the futnre."
And the teacher from
San Salvador helps
them to calculate the
cost and promises to
discuss the plan at the
Centre.
Next day we go to
Ihuatzio, a village on
the shore. It is smaller
even than Janitzio. The
people are agricultur-
ists, and more reserved
than the fishermen of
Janitzio, who are quite
used to seelllg VISltlllg
strangers admiring their
island.
The village has a
sleepy air ; the wooden
planks of the landing
jetty are hanging in the
water ; pigs and dogs
roam the neglected
streets : and anart from
a few children sitting
around in the middle of
the road and playing
marbles on a serape,
there is seemingly little
interest in our group.
But the Mexican spe-
cialist in rural educa-
tion who came with us
takes me to a ! itt) e clear-
ing in front of an emph
building, and proudly
points to a group of
men rlearing stones from the
ground.
"They are volunteers,"he says.
"They are preparing the square
and repairing-the building which
is to he their community centre.
One day the viHage co-operative
will he directed from here..."
We wade through mud and water
and arrive at a modest house where
young women stand chatting on the
porch. The busy themselves
around a young Costa Rican student
of the Centre, who shows them
how to embroider t1e belts which
they send to the market each Fri-
day. Their conversation shifts to
questions of food. The student
explains to them how metals can he
varied and prepared more hygienic-
ally.
"We are getting them to do
something about that jetty too,"the
Mexican specialist says. But I in-
terrupt him :"All this is very
little... too slow."
The Mexican's tone, which has
been enthusiastic, becomes empha-
tic."You can change society
by either revolution or evolution,"
he says."The first may be quicker
and more spectacular-but pro-
hnhly less tasting. In this country
we have certainly had enougih
experience of it. Our way is the
painful, slow method of teaching
people how they can change their
livers. It is not imposed, it is deve-
loped... it is stop, but it is lasting."
He pauses, then goes on again.
"You could change this village from
top to bottom in 24 hours-it has
been tried before. But in a few
months, in a year, everything would
be right back where it was in the
past.
"You see, once these people really
feel and believe that the changes
are necessary, and get together and
build their own co-operative or
adopt a new method of working
because they realize its advantages,
AT THE CENTRE
I saw proof of that on another
of Lake Patzcuaro's tiny islands-
Jaracuaro. The Tarascans of this
village are no richer than their
neighbours. Yet, when they ferried
our team over to their island, they
refused to take money for it.
"Xot from you, Señor..."said
Pascal Corral, secretary of the vil-
lage council, as he was offered the
money by Filiberto Tentori, the
popular'Mexican teacher-student
working in this community. Here

Discussing future posters in art studio. Tarascan women learn fine points of needlework.

Ihuatzio will haze taken a lasting
step forward.
"And that's exactly why we're
here : not to do things for the peo-
ple, but to help them to do things
for themselves. Real rural educa-
tion must rest on this basic prin-
ciple... and, by necessity, the results
must be slow and gradual."
Results, of course, depend on a
number of factors. Some villages
may be more aloof and more suspi-
cious of outside interference than
ochers. The personality of teacher-
students in the teams that visit
the villages is of great importance.
There is an inevitable period of
"probing."First the students will
just walk around trying to under-
stand the problems of"their"ví\-
lage and be ready to offer advice
wherever it is asked for.
Sometimes circumstances may
favour their work. In one of the
villages confidential relationship
was quickly established because one
of the students was able to offer
quick and effective help to combat a
violent outbreak of malaria. In some
others, lire Ihuatzio, it took two
months before the villagers began
to display any desire to co-operate.
But the more resistance there is
to overcome, the more lasting the
improvements will be, as they
spring from the conviction that the
advice and example given have led
to self-help and an improvement in
living conditions.
It's easy to enlarge that window, student explains.
the daily arrival of the team is
greeted'with friendly smiles, with
roadside chats about current pro-
blems, and with the confidence
shown to comrades who are offering
a friendly hand.
Jaracuaro is the"sombrero-
island,"which manufactures wide-
brimmed straw-hats. But there is
also a tittle) and behind the village
where most of the food needed is
produced. When we entered Vi-
cente Rendon's house we were greet-
ed with the words :"My house is
at your disposaL"He and his
assistant were working on their
machines, sewing straw-ribbons
into a hat. White another young
man struggled with the creaking
press to flatten the straw, Vicente
talked about a power-press.
Now that the village co-operative
is in existence and has decided to
have an eieetric power-press, the
co-operative is about to embark on
its first serious action.'Vith the
help of the Pátzcuaro Centre, the
Electricity Commission agreed to
the village's request. In a matter
of weeks, the cables will be sunk
into the water across the lake.
The poles to carry the wires have
already been hauled across the
water'buy a fleet of canoes organized
bv the villagers, and now everybody
is waiting for the day when the
light will go on in the church of
Jaracuaro.
The basket-ball ground is already
on sports was written
by the young people
themselves.
In next month's issue
they intend to launch a
campaign for the build-
ing of a wood cause-
way across the water.
This would save buying
canoes, which are ex-
pensive.
Jaracuaro is wide
awake and is beginning
to take its future in its
own hands. On our
way back, swaying in
the shaky canoe, Fili-
berto proudly told me :
"When I first came here
five months ago they
looked just as suspi-
cious as the people you
have seen in Ihuatzio.
When they had an epi-
demic among their pigs
: md I told them that
they ought to kill and
burn the diseased ani-
mals, they were furious.
Now, however, they
understand why they
should."
The story is not very
different in the other
"laboratory"villages.
Problems and human
reactions varv accord-
ing to local circumstan-
ces. But beyond them
all, there is a patient
transformation that
slowly changes the out-
look of the men and
women going up to the
P ; ítzcuaro market every
Friday morning. Slowly,
their own efforts will
give them better results.
Already communities
are beginning to adopt
new ways which will
make life in them both
more rational and more
humane.
Behind the transfor-
mation stands CREFAL
with its educational
films, its slides and lec-
tures, its 50 teacher-
students from nine dif-
ferent countries, the
educational experts, the
specialists and techni-
cians and the handful of
devoted men who direct
the entire operation.
The teams, always com-
posed of five specialized
pupils (for health, eco-
nomics, labour pro-
blems, basic education and're-
creation activities) geo out to learn
while helping the villagers.
I was speaking of results one
morning with one of the directors
of the Unesco Fundamental Edu-
cation Centre when he interrupted
me impatiently :"Our principal
amhition is not to get quick results,
though naturallv it is satisfying to
see results... hut our real task is to
train these 50 young teachers, and
the many others who will come
after them, how to tackle these pro-
blems of village education... the
more difficult the reception they
have, the happier I am.
"They are here to learn every
trick and every detail of how to
penetrate the villages, how to learn
their problems, and how best to
establish themselves as people
whose advice and expert knowledge
are accepted and acted upon. That's
almost more important to us than
to have spectacular results...
"When they go home to their
own countries all over Latin Ame-
rica and begin to teach others the
art thev have learned from hard
experience, then we shaft know that
we have been doing a good job for
an entire continent..."
As we were talking, the Centre's
large blue bus was driving up the
road to take its load of students to
the lake. They were beginning
another dav dedicated to the future
of an entire continent.
