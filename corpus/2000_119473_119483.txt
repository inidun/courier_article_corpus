The trials of a Gikuyu w r i t e r
◗ M wangi wa Mutahi
Kenyan novelist Mwangi wa Mutahi is now an ardent defender of his native language 
but he was once as hostile to it as some of his own teachers 
Iwas born into a peasant family in 1963, the ye a r
K e nya gained independence. My sole language,a s
a child, was Gikuyu. It was the language in which
we sang songs,n a rr ated stori e s , exchanged riddles or
merely chat t e d , while around us adults conve rsed in
p r overb-loaded exchanges.To the best of my recol-
l e c t i o n , G i k u y u , spoken by about 22 per cent of the
K e nyan populat i o n , was the only language we we r e
taught during the first three ye a rs at school, a l t h o u g h
I had learnt the English alphabet in nurs e ry school. I n
our fourth ye a r , English was reintroduced, and we
had to bid fa r e well to Gikuyu. From there on, s p e a-
king or writing in our mother tongue was forbidden by
school ru l e s. Speaking it exposed us to beating and
p u n i s h m e n t ,and in some cases temporary expulsion.
The resentment with which Gikuyu and other A f ri c a n
languages were treated in my school was almost uni-
ve rsal in Kenyan pri m a ry schools. In the mind of my
e d u c at o rs , A f rican languages were not actually lan-
guages but pri m i t i ve ve rn a c u l a rs.
For a while,before and after my college studies, I
taught in secondary school, an experience which gave
me the opportunity to show my own attitudes towa r d s
A f rican languages.Would I be able to nurture Gikuyu
in my students,or would I wo rship foreign languages

while despising my own? Not surp ri s i n g l y, I turn e d
out to be as good a disciple of the colonial heritage as
my fellow teachers who worked hard to enforce the
school ru l e s. I found myself beating and punishing
students whenever and wherever they attempted to
speak in their mother tongue. Like many before me,
I found myself adopting the colonial doctrine accor-
ding to which speaking and learning A f rican lan-
guages stunt the student’s ability to learn . A n d
because the national examinations were in English,
students were easily convinced that they needed to
master this language in order to excel.
Decades after acquiring political independence,
the colonial system of education remains intact. N o
s i g n i ficant policy changes in the teaching of Kenya ’s
languages—the country counts about 40—have been
m a d e .With the exception of Kiswa h i l i , p r o c l a i m e d
by the late leader Jomo Kenyatta as an official lan-
guage along with English, the gove rnment tends to
look upon local languages as a threat to nat i o n a l
u n i t y. Emphasis is still put on excelling in English-
language examinat i o n s , and plenty of A f rican edu-
c at o rs uphold this system. It is the route to prestige,
to potential studies and jobs, locally and abroad.
Writer’s block
For me, the turning point came at the age of 32,
when I sat down to write my first nove l . At the
time I was living in the United Stat e s , working as a
research scientist. In writing Ngoima, I wished to
p o rt r ay the independent Kenyan gove rnment in
its true neo-colonial colours. I wanted to write for
an audience of peasants, wo r k e rs and dispossessed
people.My story exposes issues of corruption and
neglect in the health care system through a wo m a n
who runs into complications during her pregnancy.
I began writing in English, but after the first two
p a r a graphs I realized that the message that I wa n t e d
to delive r , in my mind,was in Gikuyu.This language
t h at I had gr own up speaking at home was more
deeply rooted in my mind than I had thought.As the
s t o ry unfolded and I tried to write dialogue, I stum-
bled again.Was it not false to have my two main cha-
r a c t e rs ,both peasant fa rm e rs , speak in English? Both
were at home in the Gikuyu language and culture.B y
this time, the writing of N go i m a was at a standstill.
S e veral months lat e r , without having picked up
the manuscript again, I had the opportunity to
return home to Kenya, where I spent time among
the kind of people I knew when I was growing up.
In a mysterious manner, this visit home rekindled
my writing of Ngoima. It was as if I had the oppor-
tunity of conve rsing in person with my two fic-
tional characters.At the beginning of 1997, I start e d
Ngoima again, this time in Gikuyu. My thoughts
were so clear that in two months I had completed
the first draft of the novel.
G i k u y u ’s written development has been stunted
because there are not enough people writing in it.
New wo r d s ,t e rms and spellings have lagged behind
other more widely spoken tongues. I ran into these dif-
ficulties throughout the writing of my novel but found
i n s p i r ation in two other wri t e rs (Gakaara and Ngugi )
who had chosen to write in Gikuyu before me. M y
book started selling in Fe b ru a ry 1999. My fat h e r , a
peasant whose reading for most of his life had been
c o n fined to the Bible and hy m n s , told me that reading
the book had been an “ e d u c ational experi e n c e ” f o r
h i m . In following the characters ’l i ve s ,he had also gai-
ned a better understanding of some of the social and
economic issues facing his community.
A way to empowerment
The way N go i m a has been received is a small tes-
t i m o ny that A f rican languages are well and truly alive ,
e ven though publishers rarely accept manuscripts in
them and English continues to be equated with nat i o-
nal and intern ational recognition.Although intellec-
tuals and wri t e rs have taken a firm stand in defence of
all Kenyan languages, their real bedrock of support is
found amongst peasants and wo r k e rs. They are the
ones who have kept the languages alive and evo l v i n g .
They are also the ones who are in dire need of reading
m at e rials in their mother tongue.
Writers and scholars from all regions of Africa
gathered in Eritrea last January for a timely confe-
rence entitled “Against all Odds:A f rican languages
and literatures in the 21st century.” It was the first
conference of its kind on A f rican soil, and was held
in a country that has incorporated nine languages
into its education and development agenda.I rea-
lized that we no longer have to fear that these lan-
guages are going to die, but rather push for ways in
which they can be more widely spoken, read and
t r a n s l at e d .To some, w riting in our own language is
a betrayal of the elite system. I now see it as the way
to break with neocolonial mentalities and empo-
wer the A f rican people. Listening to wri t e rs in A f ri-
can languages from all over the continent was an
i n s p i r ation to continue writing in Gikuyu, and I am
now back home, busy at work on my new novel. ■
