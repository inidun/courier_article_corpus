The 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity
gives priority to in situ conservation in protected
areas. Why?
The key aim is to conserve all the ecological
e l e m e n t s — p l a n t s , a n i m a l s , soil and wat e r — a s
well as the interactions between them, which
maintain the evolutionary process. This kind of
approach is crucial in poor countries, which rare-
ly have the means to put together ex situ conser-
vation projects such as gene banks,zoos and bota-
nical gardens. It also guarantees access to data on
natural resources and to the results of research
carried out on their territory.
Why is it a good idea to create physical land links
between different parks?
E l e p h a n t s , for example, m i gr ate from dry areas
to wet ones as they need to. If you try to stop them,
you threaten their survival.Protected areas should
be linked by corridors that allow species to move
around and also permit genetic exchange between
wildlife from different regi o n s. More and more
reserves these days straddle national borders.
What are biggest threats to protected areas?
Lack of intern ational co-operation and sup-
p o rt . A f rican gove rn m e n t s , which can no longer
satisfy the basic needs of their populations, have
downgraded the importance of protecting nature.
In many countri e s ,d e c e n t r a l i z ation of authority to
r e gional bodies has complicated park management
too.You can’t create new parks in Africa any more

and existing ones are short of eve ry t h i n g, e s p e-
cially staff.
Protected areas are also under pressure from
p o p u l ations whose resources are getting scarcer
because of pove rty and environmental changes.
These people are looking for new farmland, fire-
wood and animals to hunt. The introduction of
outside species like the sparr ow, which was unknow n
in sub-Saharan A f rica before 1978, is another des-
tabilizing element, because they come to occupy the
e c o l o gical space of nat i ve species and end up dri v i n g
them out. Package tourism and urban expansion are
other big threat s , though they are less important in
Africa than elsewhere.
Why do you campaign for involvement of local
people in managing reserves?
C o n s e rvation efforts have sometimes fa i l e d
because it was long believed that nature could be
c o n s e rved without involving people. But at t i t u d e s
h ave changed over the past two decades, thanks lar-
gely to the influence of the poor countri e s. P r e s s u r e
on resources is constantly increasing, and local people
see parks as obstacles to deve l o p m e n t . So we have to
c o m p e n s ate these people. Instead of investing in the
protected area itself, viable projects must be funded
in the surrounding area. S e veral approaches have
been tested, such as UN E S C O’s biosphere reserve s ,o f
which there are now 368 in 91 countri e s.
What have been the results?
Mixed,because of lack of money. But two pro-
jects in Senegal have proved that we were on the
right track.The Popenguine Reserve,for example,
is the first in the world entirely run by wo m e n ,
who live in eight nearby villages. They maintain
the park, grow food for market, manage stocks of
cereals and fuel, organize visitors ’a c c o m m o d at i o n
and act as tourist guides.At the begi n n i n g, in 1987,
they agreed to help the gove rnment run the park in
exchange for permission to continue gat h e ri n g
medicinal plants there.They worked for 10 years
without asking for a penny in payment. Then in
1 9 9 7 , a three-year $400,000 programme funded by
the European Union and the French Nicolas Hulot
Fo u n d at i o n , made it possible to start deve l o p m e n t
projects. Now the women are independent.They
p atrol the reserve , looking after its conservat i o n
and benefiting from the income from tourism.
For one success, t h e re seem to have been a lot of
f a i l u re s. Some people are calling for protected are a s
to be privatized. What do you think about that?
H ow can we stop the pri vate sector from try i n g
to improve their own fortunes? The Fazao Reserve ,
in Togo, was privatized in 1990.The wildlife there
i m m e d i ately began to be sold. T h at ’s a seri o u s
m at t e r.T h e r e ’s no altern at i ve to part n e rship betwe e n
the state, conservation organizations and the local
p o p u l at i o n . But we have to go further in the field of
participation. ■
