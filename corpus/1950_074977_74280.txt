WHAT IS"PNEUMONOUL TRAMICROSCOPIC-
"SILlCOVOLCANOKONIOSIS" ?
SCIENTISTS OF TO-DAY ARE NOT ONLY MADE YOUNG,BUT START CONTRIBUTING TO SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS
WHILE STILL IN THEIR TEE S.
TAKE THE RECENT WORK OF A 15 YEAR-OLD YOUNGSTER
IN THE UNI'rED STATES, IN CONNECTION WITH NEW
THERMO-PLASTIC SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS ORGANIC SILICON
POLYMERS. THESE ARE MADE BY A PROCESS IN WHICH
SMALL MOLECULES JOHN TOGETHER TO FORM A LARGER
MOLECULE, TYPICAL NDUSTR) AL PRODUCTS OF TH ! S PRO-
CESS BEING SYNTHETIC MATERIALS SUCH AS RUBBER AND
NYLON.
THiS YOUTH WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE BEST
REAGENTS FOR MAKING THEE NEW PRODUCTS ARE DAN-
GEROUS TO USE BECAUSE THEY ARE DISSOLVED IN ETHER,
FORMING EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES IN THE AIR. DETERMINED
TO FIND SOME LESS VOLATILE LIQUID AS A SUBSTITUTE,
HE SET TO WORK AND FINALLY SUCCEEDED. HITS DISCOVERY
REPRESENTED AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO CHE-
MISTRY AND TO INDUSTRY.
THIS YOUNG SCIENTIST DESCRIBED HIS EXPERIMENT IN
AN ESSAY HE WROTE AS A COMPETITOR IN A SCIENCE
TALENT SEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES, HE, AND SOME
16, 000 OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOW AWAITING THE
RESULTS OF THIS SCIENCE APTITUDE EXAMINATION WHICH
THE SCIENCE CLUBS OF AMERICA CONDUCT EACH YEAR.
BELOW, WE GIVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS SELECTED
FROM THE CURRENT SCIENCE APTITUDE TEST. SEE HOW
MANY OF THEM YOU CAN ANSWER. YOU WILL FIND THE
ANSWERS ON PAGE 10 OF THIS ISSUE,
DIRECTIONS : Four possible answers are given for each
question. Put an X beside the number corresponding to
the answer which you think is correct.

HOW JET PROPULSION DEVELOPED
These drawings are taken from a comic strip illustrating the development 01 jet propulsion, from the first ideas
conceived centuries ago to the construction of modern jet engines which carry men through the air faster than
ever before. This is one 01 a series distributed for the General Electric Company by General Comics Inc.
