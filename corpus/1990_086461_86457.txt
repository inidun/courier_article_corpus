UNESCO AND
'ARCHITECTURE WITH A SMILE'
BY HANS-DIETER DYROFF
N,Iineteen countries* are today co¬
operating in a Unesco project to
study and protect the architectural
heritage of Art Nouveau and
Jugendsi// described at a recent
meeting of specialists as "architecture
with a smile".
The notion of cultural dialogue,
today a central feature of Unesco's
programme, was already fore¬
shadowed in the Art Nouveau move¬
ment. Nowhere Is this more apparent
than in the Hungarian town of
Kecskemet, where the seeds of the
Unesco project were sown at a meet¬
ing of specialists held in 1985.
Kecskemet has a number of magnifi¬
cent buildings dating from the turn
of the century, including a town hall
designed by the Hungarian architect
Odön Lechner (1 845-1 91 4). Though
uniquely Hungarian, these buildings
are also the product of a closely knit
network of international influences
and exchanges, and bear witness to
a powerful movement whose dynam¬
ics spread not only through the coun¬
tries of Europe but also to other
continents.
The Art Nouveau project soon
generated great interest. The German
ft
National Commission for Unesco in
Bonn, which acted as co-ordlnator,
drew up an initial plan which won
wide approval at Unesco's General
Conference in 1985. The following
year, a group of European specialists
met at Heiligkreuztal in the Federal
Republic of Germany and defined Art
Nouveau architecture for the pur¬
poses of the projecta difficult task
in view of the great diversity of cre¬
ators and processes involved. They
adopted a definition which was
broad enough to include not only the
work of leading figures who set out
to use a combination of artistic skills
in order to create "all-inclusive works
of art" but also the contributions of
less well-known architects and builders
many of whom played an important
role, whether in shaping urban dis¬
tricts or in helping the transmission
of Art Nouveau internationally.
The next stage was to assemble
and evaluate information about Art
Nouveau buildings as a basis for pos¬
sible preservation work. A fund of in¬
formation about international
exchanges, building techniques and
especially the experimental use of
new materials at the turn of the cen-
1
tury has gradually been created. As
far as the spread of Art Nouveau is
concerned, it would be impossible to
emphasize too strongly the influence
exercised by popular illustrated peri¬
odicals such as the German magazine
Jugend, which made extensive use of
photographs to document new
trends in architecture and the arts.
Not surprisingly, therefore, one Im¬
portant activity of the Unesco project
is the assembling of photographic
documentation on Art Nouveau
buildings and on efforts being made
to preserve them. The Unesco Nation¬
al Commission of the German
Democratic Republic has already
mounted an exhibition which has so
far been shown in its country of ori¬
gin, in Finland and in the Federal
Republic of Germany. The other
countries participating in the project
intend to prepare similar exhibitions.
There are many reasons for the
growing interest in the project. One
of them is the fascination exercised
by an age in which the development
of new engineering tools and tech¬
niques, the expansion of transport
and communication, and belief in
progress, gave a strong impetus to
architectural and aesthetic innova¬
tions. Another is a general revival
of interest in the work of great ar¬
chitects such as Henry van de Velde,
Hermann Obrist, Otto Wagner, Eliel
Saarinen and many others.
A considerable amount of exper¬
tise and knowledge has by now been
accumulated, ranging from bibliog¬
raphies reflecting the current state of
research in different countries, to lists
of monuments, experts, firms, materi¬
als and other information. The
Unesco project group is now ready
to offer its advice and assistance to
specific conservation operations, fully
aware that its co-operation in such
efforts can only be based on the
initiative and involvement of local
groups.
