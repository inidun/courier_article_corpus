THE PARADOX
OF
BRITISH HUMOUR
by Ronald MATTHE. WS
IF there is a paradox in thebloody but unbowed Britain of
1951 inviting the world to a
Festival at all, there is perhaps an
even greater paradox in the fact
that its exhibits include one de-
voted to British humour. To dis-
play humour seems almost as
self-contradictory as to parade hu-
mility.
It is merely a Continental legend
that the British are proud of their
sense of humour. To be proud of
one's sense of humour would be as
humourless as it would be manner-
less to boast of one's good manners.
At most, the British regard with
pity or wonder the unhappy
foreigners who fail to appreciate
the spirit of the famous London
newspaper headline :"'Channel
gale : Continent cut off". While
the Latin will greet adversity with
rhetoric (which defies it) or wit
(which dominates it), the English-
man will accept it with humour
(which views it as a joke) and
includes himself in the jest.
No one could refuse to call brave
the last words of Danton on the
scaffold."Montrez ma tÃªte au
peuple, elle en vaut la peine". No
one could deny the same adjective
to those of Saint Thomas More,
brushing away his beard from the
headman's axe :"Pity that should
be cut ; that has never committed
treason."But the first phrase is
pure Latin rhetoric, which stems
from manly pride ; the second is the
purest English humour, which
stems from humility.
The British are not generally
credited with humility-but then
they are not generally credited
with a number of virtues which are
really theirs. To European and
American onlookers, their out-
standing quality has aften seemed
their conventionality, whereas
the great glory of English life has
always been the happy persistence
of the English eccentric ; and the
English eccentric has invariably
been quite unconcerned as whether
the world laughed at him or not.
JOINING IN JOKE
CAN one conceive of any religiouspretender other than an
Englishman describing himself as
.'good Admighty's Nephew", as did
Richard Brothers, founder of the
British Israelites ; or of any other
prophetess than an Englishwoman,
such as Joanna Southcott (of the
mysterious box) claiming for her
mythical heaven-begotten child,
not only the style of"the third
representative of Divinity", but
also that of.'infant monitor of the
Prince Regent (later George IV), in
whose palaces the bantling will
pass its first years, and from whom
His Royal Highness will learn his
first lessons of reform and tempe-
rance" ?
If the English eccentric accepts
being part of a joke, the English
humorist sets out to be part of it :
the Latin wit is superior to the
amusement he provokes. There is
no reason to consider one form of
arousing the saving purge of laugh-
ter as more worthy than the other.
THE LEG PULL
THERE is all the difference in theworld between Clemenceau's
mordant :"War is too serious an
affair to be left to generals", which
is wit, and the Duke of Wellington's
first comment on the raw troops
who were to serve under him at
Waterloo : :.'1 don't know what
the enemy will think of these fel-
lows, but by God, they frighten
me", which is humour.
Significant of the difference
between the two attitudes is that
there exists no French equivalent
for the phrase.'leading up the
garden path", an activity which
forms such an esential element of
English humour. The pompous or
unconscious ass being led up the
garden path is one of the central
themes in English comedy. We
can follow it back through the
centuries, finding it in the screen
scene of Sheridan's"School for
Scandal", when Joseph Surface is
the victim, and in the letter scene
in"TWelfth Night", where Malvolio
is having his leg pulled.
One of its earlier and most
brilliant appearances occurs in
Act IV, Scene 3 of Ben Jonson's
play"The Alchemist", because the
leading up the garden is mutual ;
the victim is silently pulling the
legs of his would-be swindlers.
The egregious"Capatin"Face has
picked up a stranger whom he
imagines to be a wealthy Spanish
visitor to London and whom he
proposes to part from his money by
proposing the charms of the fair
but frail Doll Common, one of his
two partners in roguery. In fact,
the"Spaniard"is an English cha-
racter. Before ears which they
fondly believe comprehend no
English, but which in reality seize
"English is understood almost everywhere"says the inscription in the mouth
of the lion at the Festival of Britain Exhibition."And the English almost nowhere",
adds the Unicorn. Between them, under the map showing the areas of the
world where English is spoken, the caption reads :"THE ENGLISH TONGUE.
It is a language tuned for all occasions, It writes sonnets, talks shop, sings
music hall and talks volumes. It was once the dialect of a handful of islanders.
It is now the mother tongue of 200 millions."
every word they say, the rogues
boast :"You shall be emptied, Don.
Pumped and drawn dry, as they
say... Milked, in troth, sweet Don."
When the Englishman laughs at
situations like this, he is not
asserting the superiority of human
intelligence over circumstance, as
does Latin wit, nor his own super-
iority over the butt of the jest, as
does the ill-bred child who mocks
at a cripple. He knows that in the
best and least pretentious of us
there lurks a pompous or an un-
conscious ass, and when he is
laughing at that ass's discomfiture,
he is also laughing at himself.
It is surprising to find that there
is only one European national lite-
rature in which the same attitude
towards the leg-pull may be found
- and that is the Russian. Gogol's
riotous comedy of"The Inspector-
General", where a penniless stu-
dent takes in an entire provincial
town by posing as a visiting official
from the Central Government,
could only have been written as it
was written by one other contem-
porary author in Europe-and
that was that most English of all
humorists, Charles Dickens..
One characteristic of the British people is their love of
eccentric fantasy. No better summary of this exists than
Tenniel's White Knight who, mounted on his all-purpose
steed, is displayed at the pavilion providing clues to British
character and tradition, at the Festival Exhibition.
The title of"The Lion and the Unicorn"given to a
pavilion at the Festival of Britain Exhibition, serves to
symbolize two of the main qualities of the British cha-
racter : on the one hand, realism and strength ; on the
other, fantasy, independence and imagination.
CURATE'S EGG
THE Briton is prepared to laughat himself and any of his
defects, as witness the summing up
of the British character by
"Punch"in a poem which went, in
part :
"Their philosophic outlook is noto-
riously stoic ;
"They have a gift for Compromise
allied to Muddled Thinking ;
"Though slightly xenophobic, they
are highly philozoic ;
"Their incomes and their appetites
are gradually shrinking".
He also laughs at himself for his
timidity as when the curate, break-
fasting with his bishop, was asked
whether he had not been given a
bad egg, made the immortal re-
ply :"Oh no, my lord, I assure you.
Parts of it are excellent."
Though he is reverent to what
he believes are holy things, he
laughs at himself as the preacher,
as in George Herbert's gently mali-
cious lines :
"The worst say something good ; if
all lack sense,
"God takes a text, and preaches
patience."
And sometimes, to the bewilder-
ment of foreigners, he appears to
laugh at just nothing."English is
understood almost everywhere....
and the English almost nowhere",
says an inscription in the Festival
of Britain Pavilion where the
English character and English hu-
mour are illustrated. That is a
statement which only an English-
man could make with compla-
cency.
The Frenchman may pride him-
self on the clarity of his intelli-
gence, the German on the profun-
dity of his philosophic penetration,
the Russian on the deep recesses of
his soul ; but if the British do at
any time come close to conceit, it is
not on their intelligence or artistic
talents that they plume themselves,
but over the fact that they can
make jokes which no one but they
can understand. I wonder how
many foreigners would laugh as
uproariously as Englishmen did at
Harry Graham's magnificent Ruth-
less Rhyme :
"I was playing golf the day
"that the Germans landed,
"All our men had run away,
"all our ships were stranded
"And the thought ot England's
shame
"Nearly put me off my game"
