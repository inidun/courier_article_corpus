According to a recent United Nations study, 
Sri Lanka is the country with the second highest
number of disappeared people in the world.1
And yet there seems to be hardly any debate
within the country about human rights viola-
tions. Why is this?
One of the biggest tragedies of Sri Lanka
t o d ay is the existence of a culture of fear
in both the majority Sinhala and the mino-
rity Tamil societies. Ethnic conflict (see time-
line) and the war against Tamil militants
h ave heavily militarized the society. In the
last three decades,people in the north and
east of the island have lived under the Sri
Lankan army, the Indian Pe a c e k e e p i n g
Force (IPKF) and different Tamil militant
gr o u p s. Both inside and outside the confli c t
z o n e s , civilians are used to living under dif-
ficult conditions, with official and unoffi-
cial curfews, house-to-house search opera-
t i o n s ,a rr e s t s ,t o rture and detention as part
of their eve ry d ay experi e n c e . Some civilians
who openly spoke out against the violence
and terror have been killed publicly by the
a rmy or by the militants. So there has been
no way civilians could talk about human
rights violations.
In the south, the situation is not much
d i f f e r e n t .Thousands of Sinhala youths died
when the government tried to suppress an
i n s u r g e n cy launched to oppose the Indo-
Lanka peace accord of 1987. In the ye a rs
b e t ween 1987 and 1990, piles of bodies bu r-
ning along the roadside became a common
s i g h t . Both the army and the insurgents we r e
responsible for those massacres and disap-
pearances.
In the context of such experi e n c e s ,
civilians in Sri Lanka fear that if you raise
your voice against injustice, the punishment
will be nothing less than deat h . Not intimi-
d at i o n , assault or impri s o n m e n t , but a ve ry
brutal death.Even today, people are being
a b d u c t e d , detained and tortured by the
s e c u rity forces and by para-military and
militant gr o u p s.The culture of fear has gi ve n
rise to a culture of silence. People are still
afraid to talk about what happened betwe e n
1987 and 1990, or about what is going on
t o d ay. Under existing conditions we cannot
expect civilians to come forward to talk
about the human rights abuses of the past
and present.The challenge facing civil socie-
ty in Sri Lanka now is how to break this
culture of silence.
Although there has been extensive loss of 
life in the conflict in Sri Lanka, the international
community has not taken a particularly 
strong line on this issue. What do you feel
about this?
According to our estimates more than

100,000 people have been killed in Sri
Lanka in the last two decades. It is a pity
that our successive governments as well as
the Tamil militant groups have not made
sincere efforts to find a peaceful solution. I f
the intern ational community had shown a
little more interest and put pressure on the
S ri Lankan gove rnment and the Ta m i l

tiated settlement by this time.
A l t hough Sri Lanka is in a state of wa r ,
the country continues to receive We s t e rn
d e velopment aid.This money is supposed to
be used for relief, r e c o n s t ruction and reha-
b i l i t at i o n . But how is it possible to undert a-
ke development work in the midst of a wa r ?
P r o b a b l y,We st e rn countries consider the Sri
Lankan situation as a manageable confli c t .
If the situation becomes unmanageable,
as in Kosovo or Rwa n d a , then I think there
may be some kind of initiative.

racism and neo-colonialism invo l ved in the

1.The United Nations Working Group on
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances says that
over 12,000 Sri Lankans have gone missing since
1980 after being detained by security forces. Only
Iraq, with 16,384 missing persons, had more
cases of disappearances.The Sri Lankan
government estimates the number of disappeared
persons at around 17,000,while Sri Lankan
human rights groups say more than 42,000
people have disappeared in the last two decades.

s i t u at i o n . If one white person had been
abducted or killed in Sri Lanka, then the
Western countries would have reacted dif-
f e r e n t l y. These are brown people killing
b r own people in a fa r away country.W hy
should the West bother?
A few years ago, the Sri Lankan 
government formed commissions of inquiry
to look into the disappearance of civilians 
and human rights violations. What have these
led to?
In the 1990s, human rights groups in
S ri Lanka and abroad launched a huge
public campaign demanding an inquiry into
the reported disappearance of over 42,000
p e o p l e .As a result, the gove rnment form e d
a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCI)
in 1992 to inve s t i g ate the complaints. S i n c e
then there have been several other com-
missions on disappearances.
Thousands of families of the disappea-
red testified before the PCIs, which in turn
submitted reports to the president. But the
commissions lacked powe rs to initiate legal
action against those found guilty. None of
the reports has been made public so fa r.A l l
the reports are lying with the presidential
s e c r e t a ri at .Only the president has the autho-
rity to submit them to parliament.
In 1998, because of considerable pres-
sure from the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, civil society, the media
and the intern ational community, t h e
g ove rnment said it had initiated action
against about 100 policemen who we r e
i m p l i c ated by the disappearances commis-
sion for the Central Province of Sri Lanka.
This resulted from a list of over 1,000 com-
p l a i n t s. Only one of the accused was a senior
officer.The rest were junior officials.
Human rights groups have been calling
for the commission to inve s t i g ate furt h e r
and expose those higher officials and poli-
ticians who actually gave orders for these
abductions and killings. In the context of
the on-going wa r , one has to understand the
dependence of the political structures on
the security machinery. From the stat e ’s
point of view (not from mine), you can per-
haps even justify formal impunity, but there
cannot be a total denial of the reality of what
has happened in Sri Lanka. If found guilty,
politicians should be barred from holding
public office and from contesting elections.
This demand is not unprecedented.There
are many examples, including A r g e n t i n a ,
C h i l e ,G u at e m a l a , and El Salva d o r , of coun-
t ries where va rious commissions named
political bosses for human rights abuses.
Human rights groups were also success-
ful in forcing the Sri Lankan gove rn m e n t
to allow a visit by Amnesty Intern ational and
A VICTORIOUS STRUGGL E
AG A INST IN T IMIDAT ION
Intimidation is nothing new to 46-year-old Sunila Abeysekera, the Executive Director of INFORM, a lea-
ding Sri Lankan human rights organization set up in 1989. In 1988, when she was several months pre-
gnant, death threats forced her to flee the country and seek refuge for a brief period in the Netherlands.
Her “crime” was to persistently demand accountability for human rights abuses and action against per-
p e t rators of human rights abuse, regardless of their rank or position. She was on the hit list of the Janata Vimukti
Pe ramuna (JVP), a militant leftist movement, in the mid-1970s, soon after her expulsion from the group. Her
bold criticism of the movement’s activities and a call for democra cy and justice within the group had
aroused the wrath of some senior members. But she weathered the storm and continued to work on her ow n
for civil rights. “When everyone is criticizing you, then you are doing the right thing,” Abeysekera says.
She was among the few members of the majority Sinhala community who established direct contact
with Tamil women in the north and east of Sri Lanka after the outbreak of ethnic conflict in 1983. Wo r k i n g
closely with her father, Charles Abeysekera, she highlighted human rights violations perpetrated by
s e c u r i ty forces under the guise of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and emergency rule in the country’s Ta m i l -
dominated north and east.
The Sri Lankan human rights situation attracted international attention after human rights NGOs in Sri
Lanka, including INF O RM, began to participate in the annual sessions of the UN Human Rights Commission
in Geneva from 1992 onwards. Abeysekera’s consistent presence at international human rights fora and
the international focus she has brought to the human rights situation in Sri Lanka have helped to bring
about some improvements. At the parliamentary elections in 1994 Sri Lankan political parties were
forced to pledge that they would give top priority to improving the human rights situation if elected to offic e .
“Though the promise has yet to be fulfilled, at least they recognized that there is a problem,” she says.
Abeysekera, a mother of two, now lives in Colombo, working with INFORM and many other human
rights and women’s rights groups seeking peaceful and democratic change in Sri Lanka.



UN HUMAN RIGHTS AWARDS
On December  10, 1998, Sunila Abeysekera was honoured by the United Nations for her outstanding
contribution to the struggle for human rights. With Angelina Acheg Atyam of Uganda, Jimmy Carter
of the United States, Jose Gregori of Brazil, and Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic, she received a UN
Human Rights Prize at one of a series of events held at UN Headquarters in New York to mark the 50th
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
H o n o ra ry in nature, the Human Rights Prizes were instituted by the General Assembly in 1966 and awarded
for the first time in 1968 on the occasion of the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights. Since then, the prizes have been awarded in 1973, 1978, 1988 and 1993. Previous
awardees include Nelson Mandela, Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant and Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. n
then by the United Nations working gr o u p
on disappearances in 1991.T h at was the firs t
time that the gove rnment recognized that
there had been disappearances. It was a major
breakthrough for the human rights move-
ment in the country.
Sri Lanka has been witnessing violence for the
last three decades. What impact has this had on
women and how have they responded?

tive and a positive impact.
At the same time, we also find wo m e n ’s
groups playing an active role in fighting for
peace and human ri g h t s. In 1986, the arr e s t
of around 600 Tamil boys led to the creat i o n
of the “ M o t h e rs ’F r o n t ” ,which organized pro-
tests in the streets of the nort h e rn town of Ja f f-
n a .They broke the barri e rs of a silence of many
ye a rs , and paved the way for a renewed acti-
vism for human ri g h t s.Since then,women of
all communities have come together in orga-
n i z ations seeking justice for disappearances
and working for peace and reconciliation in a
ve ry critical way.
Conservative groups argue that by claiming
equal rights for women, feminist groups are
destroying ancient culture and tradition. Do
you agree?
In South Asia we have this burden of an
ancient past.All our political and nat i o n a l i s t
m ovements have focused on the fact that we
are people with a gr e at heritage and a gr e at
c i v i l i z at i o n .There is no doubt that we have
i n h e rited from the past certain noble va l u e s
which need to be protected.But how can yo u
use religion and culture to justify discri m i n a-
tion against people on the basis of gender,r e l i-
gion and caste?
The conservat i ve s ’ hold over society rests
on their ability to wield control over wo m e n .
More than ever before in history wo m e n
h ave become the markers of the culture and
traditions of a community.The easiest way
to measure this is by looking at how a com-
munity imposes a dress code on wo m e n .We
find stricter dress codes for women now than
in the past. I think we are living in a socie-
from the north and east due to the violen-
c e . Men either join the army or the militant
gr o u p s.The third option for them is to leave
the country. It has been up to the women to
keep families together and to take care of
the children.There are about a million dis-
placed people within Sri Lanka and most
of them are women and children.
M a ny of these displaced women live in
pitiful conditions in gove rn m e n t - run camps.
Because there is a shortage of food, c l o t h i n g,
medicine etc. , they are forced to take up
small-time jobs elsewhere. But they are not
safe in their wo r k p l a c e s.The women are sub-
jected to a lot of sexual harassment.As a result
of the heavy militari z ation of the society, t h e
incidence of violence in the north and south,
p a rticularly sexual violence against wo m e n ,
has increased alarm i n g l y.
Communities are deeply divided by the
c o n fli c t , and men respond by imposing more
r e s t rictions on wo m e n .This applies to Sin-
h a l a ,Tamil and Muslim wo m e n . On the one
h a n d , the conflict pushes women to become
wage earn e rs and to assume responsibility
for the surv i val of their fa m i l i e s.On the other
h a n d , they are expected to conform to tra-
ditional values and safeguard the “ i m a g e ”
and “ i d e n t i t y ” of the community.
A l s o, both the army and the militants
r e c ruit women for their forces. Some of
them are even used as suicide bombers.T h i s

ty that ’s becoming increasingly fundamen-
talist and puritanical.
C o n s e rvat i ves quote religion as an excu-
se to retain their control over wo m e n . I
strongly believe that religious practices in
South Asia have nothing to do with the phi-
losophical framework offered by different
r e l i gi o n s , including Islam, Hinduism and
Buddhism.They have to do with male reli-
gious leaders who interpret religious texts
to suit their convenience.
The increased part i c i p ation of wo m e n
in the economic and political life of society
is a challenge to existing cultural and tradi-
tional barri e rs. For example, the concept of
the family is slowly being eroded as a result
of economic and social changes that are
b e yond the control of any individual.
Women are becoming independent, a n d
m e n ’s role and the male hold over the fa m i-
ly and society are being challenged by the
processes of globalizat i o n . Hence there is
c riticism of wo m e n ’s claims for equal ri g h t s
and equal treatment.
What role have peace movements and human
rights groups played in Sri Lanka?
Human rights and peace move m e n t s
h ave been trying to create a small space
within a heavily militarized society.T h e y
work closely with the media,academics and
cultural wo r k e rs to spread the ideas of peace
and civil ri g h t s.We hope that as an influ e n-
tial community within society they will have
the courage to speak out.

to the ethnic conflict. One is the Nat i o n a l

s e n t at i ves from Ta m i l , Muslim and Sinhala
c o m m u n i t i e s , and the other is the Interr e l i-

Anglican bishops and Buddhist monks.To g e-
ther they visited several areas of the nort h

dhist clergy on the same plat f o rm and all of

ve ry positive deve l o p m e n t .There is a gr o-
wing realization that you have to negotiat e

ful settlement of the ethnic conflict in Sri

It can’t be easy to be a human rights activist in a
heavily militarized society. . . 
You are ri g h t .When I started working on
human rights two decades ago it was not easy.
One is regarded as a trouble-maker, s o m e-
times as a traitor. Questioning the role of the
g ove rnment and of the different political
a c t o rs in destroying democratic stru c t u r e s
and creating a militaristic environment led
to attacks from all sides.
In general, human rights activists in Sri
Lanka are working under extreme pressu-
r e . Human rights abuses are committed by
many actors,and we must be critical of all

of them. Training people to document

re the law, p r oviding support for victims, a l l
this is a part of our wo r k . M o n i t o ring and
i n t e rvening in human rights abuses in the
north and east is especially difficult.We do
not easily acquire permission to visit areas
under the control of the militants. If there
are reports of human rights abuses in those
a r e a s , we go at the risk of our live s.We are
b a rred from having direct contacts with the
Tamil militants because of the Preve n t i o n
of Te rr o rism Act (PTA ) , which makes our
work even more difficult.
O ver the ye a rs , we have built up a good
n e t work of groups all over the country — p e a c e

Some individuals living in the troubled
areas pass on inform ation to us. If necessa-
ry, they travel to neighbouring areas on fa c t -
finding missions, sometimes risking their
lives.
Apart from attracting international attention 
to disappearances, what are your achievements
in human rights work?
I consider my consistent invo l vement in
va rious campaigns over the last 20 ye a rs and
acceptance by different networks of gr a s s-
roots organizations and move m e n t s ,b o t h
Sinhala and Ta m i l , as itself a major achie-
vement.The UN award,I feel,is a symbo-
lic vindication of the work I have done all
these years.
Our gr o u p, I N F O R M ,c o - o r d i n ates with
m a ny other groups and organizations in
launching human rights campaigns. I n
1 9 9 7 , we were part of a campaign calling
for action against soldiers who raped and
killed a Tamil schoolgirl,Krishanti Kuma-
r a swa my, while she was in custody. H e r
m o t h e r , brother and a neighbour who we n t
looking for her were also murdered.T h e
p e rsistent demands finally forced the
g ove rnment to initiate legal proceedings
against the suspects. Six of the accused we r e
sentenced to death in 1998.T h at was a land-
mark verdict and was the first time there
had been some kind of prosecution against
a rmy pers o n n e l . I think the credit should
go to all the human rights groups.
What are the chances of reconciliation after 
20 years of ethnic conflict?
T h at ’s a difficult question. As a human
rights activist I can say that it is possible for
all communities in Sri Lanka to live together
with dignity and respect.To achieve that ,l e a-
d e rs of all communities should come forwa r d
to make a new beginning through the pro-
cesses of forgi veness and reconciliat i o n .
There should be an acceptance that all
sides have committed horrendous cri m e s.
Then we have to move beyond that . I f
people are going to dwell on the past,then
there can be no solution.We have come out
of a particularly bad and horrifying period
in our history.The older generation from all
the communities still remember how they
l i ved together happily in the past. It is the
younger generation which has witnessed
wa r ,s e p a r ation and sufferi n g . If the situa-
tion is allowed to dri f t , then there is no chan-
ce for peace in Sri Lanka.
We all know that even if the war comes
to an end tomorr ow, peace will not return
unless the people from all communities are
willing to accept the past, f o r gi ve each other
and go back to living together. For this we
need a new democratic political stru c t u r e
and legal safeguards for the rights of all com-
munities. n
