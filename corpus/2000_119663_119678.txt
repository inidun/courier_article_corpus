molecular biology, they have begun designing
tailor-made drugs. Knowing the shape of a given
biological “lock”, they use computers to design
the molecular “key” that may trigger the mecha-
nism resulting in a cure. This method works in
theory, but in practice it is extremely complicated
to create ex nihilo an artificial substance that is not
found in nature. Hence the advantage of combi-
ning natural molecules that result from 4.5 billion
years of evolutionary development.
Recent successes have confirmed the value of
using substances from nature. The discovery of
cy c l o s p o ri n , an immunosuppressant, in a
Norwegian mushroom has led to decisive pro-
gress in preventing the rejection of transplanted
organs. Researchers working for the American
pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. have recently
detected a chemical component in a Congo
mushroom that acts like insulin and may be used
to make the much sought pill for diabetes. At the
same time, in vitro methods for detecting active
molecules have evolved. Pharmaceutical compa-
nies have giant robots capable of testing up to
100,000 samples a day.
Calling on 
local healers
N e ve rt h e l e s s , in practice the road leading from
plant to drug is still extremely long and fraught with
u n c e rt a i n t y. F i rs t , samples must be collected in stra-
t e gic places, where pri m a ry forest surv i ve s.They are
l o c ated in “ c o u n t ries in the inter-tropical zones of
A f ri c a , South A m e ri c a , Asia and the Pa c i fic,” s ay s

Institute for Natural Substance Chemistry.
In the field, biological prospectors are follo-
wing three different and complementary leads.
Scientists collecting plants at random bring back
as many samples as they can for screening by
robots. But the traditional knowledge of local
healers can narrow down the search. Folk reme-
dies have led to the development of several drugs,
starting with quinine and digitaline. Researching
in the South Pacific, American ethno-botanist
Paul Cox recently studied a stem of Homolanthus
nutans that Samoans prepare for the treatment 
of fevers. Chemists scrutinizing the plant found
that it contains a known molecule, prostratine,
which acts upon the Aids virus. Lastly, using the
In Madagascar’s Isalo mountain range, t h e
guide stops. At his feet, a tiny flower displays its
pink petals. “This plant is good for cancer,” the
man says proudly. Long consumed to relieve hun-
ger, the Madagascar periwinkle was first descri-
bed by the French botanist Etienne de Flacourt
in 1645.Then, in the 1960s, it was discovered to
be effective in treating cancer.
Humans have always found substances in
nature to relieve their suffering and cure their ills.
In developing countries, 80 per cent of the popu-
lation relies on traditional remedies extracted
from plants to treat illnesses. Some “modern”
d rugs that contain a single active ingr e d i e n t
rather than a mixture of substances owe their
existence to natural biodiversity. Morphine, qui-
nine, digitaline and 116 other drugs made from
plants are in widespread use, according to
American pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth.
An estimated two-thirds of the drugs sold in
pharmacies are of natural origin. They account
for some $30 billion in sales every year.
There is an urgent need for therapeutic
research to find new treatments that can be help-
ful in fighting recent, emerging diseases such as
Aids as well as overcoming resistance to current
treatments for cancer,malaria and bacterial infec-
tions. Researchers are following several leads,
such as gene therapy, which is still in its earliest
stages, and drug design. With the advent of

Profit-sharing
P h a rmaceutical research is sluggish and
u n c e rt a i n , while the threats to biodive rsity are
i rr e ve rsibly and rapidly gaining ground (see pp.
2 2 - 2 3 ) . In the face of this urgency, which coin-
cides with rising interest on the part of resear-
c h e rs , prospecting projects are being deve l o p e d ,
despite the increasingly strong constraints on the
i n d u s t ry. Before the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio
de Ja n e i r o, We s t e rn laborat o ries—the only ones
t h at can afford to invest huge sums in research—
drew from the biodive rsity of the Southern coun-
t ries without giving them anything in return . B u t
in the past ten ye a rs or so, these countries have
demanded a share of the profits—and pharm a-
ceutical companies are beginning to listen. I n
1 9 9 1 , for the first time, Merck & Co. paid ove r
one million dollars to INBIO, Costa Rica’s
National Institute for Bi o d i ve rs i t y, to gain access
to the country ’s genetic resources. If a drug is
d e ve l o p e d , the institute will receive between two
and six percent of profit s , of which half must be
e a rmarked for the preservation of national parks.
In five other projects carried out by the United
S t ates with South A m e rican and A f rican coun-
t ri e s , U. S . u n i ve rsities are co-operating with local
o n e s. It remains to be seen how the indigenous
people who help in the selection of plants will be
r e m u n e r at e d .
In the shadows of the wo r l d ’s big pharm a c e u t i-
cal companies, smaller local laborat o ries have joi-
ned the green gold ru s h . M a d a g a s c a r ’s Institute of
Applied Research has begun a study of 12,000
n at i ve plants. Working with France’s Natural Hi s-
t o ry Mu s e u m , the institute has identified a sub-
stance that strengthens the effectiveness of chloro-
quine against malari a .With a bit of luck, this plant
from the S t ry c h n o s family will follow the same trail
