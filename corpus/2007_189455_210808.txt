The Central University City Cam-
pus of the Universidad Nacional 
Autónoma de México (UNAM) 
rises up above a sea of volcanic 
lava. More than 150,000 stu-
dents, teachers and staff work, 
and in some cases live, in this 
southern part of the valley of 
Mexico, which the volcano Xitle 
(“little navel”), today extinct, en-
gulfed 2,400 years ago. 
Distant from the city in the past, 
the university campus is now a 
part of it. The demographic ex-
plosion has obliged its “inhab-
itants”, nicknamed “Pumas”, to 
share their oasis of science, art 
and sport with the 20 million peo-
ple living in the Mexican capital. 
“The architecture of the Ciudad 
Universitaria is such that even 
those who have not studied at 
the University identify with it, be-
cause it’s a very Mexican space,” 
declares Lourdes Cruz González 
Franco, researcher and coordi-
nator of Mexican architects’ ar-
chives. She underlines, “There 
is no clash between the Ciudad 
Universitaria and the big city. On 
the contrary, they are perfectly in-
tegrated with each other in a flu-
ent exchange.” 
The CU, as most people call 
it, has been instrumental in the 
major urban growth that Mexico 
City has known in the second 
half of the 20th century: since 
the beginning of its construction, 
avenues have come into being, 
others have been enlarged, like 
the Insurgentes Avenue, one of 
Mexico City’s most emblematic.
Functional  
space
The Ciudad Universitaria was de-
vised in the 1940s to concentrate 
in a single space all the differ-
ent schools and departments of 
UNAM, up until then scattered all 
over the capital. The construction 
began in 1949 over seven mil-
lion square metres and lasted for 
three years. “Mario Pani, Enrique 
del Moral and Mario Lazo opted 
for a modern architecture using 
cubical volumes and glass prisms. 
The functional and rational vision of 
space gave a new interpretation to 
an environment that the Xitle’s lava 
had made inhospitable,” explains 
Lourdes Cruz. 
Though the complex was de-
signed more than 60 years ago for 
a population of some 25,000 peo-
ple, the Ciudad Universitaria has 
lost none of its functional character 
today, even though in the 1970s it 
became necessary to add two new 
developments – one for scientific 
research and the other for human 
sciences – as well as a cultural 
centre and several multidisciplinary 
campuses.

pus. It represents a unique example 
of 20th century modernism in re-
gard to architecture, engineering, 
landscaping and arts. It is further-
more a modernism largely inspired 
by Mexican tradition. The campus 
comprises the most noteworthy 
buildings including the Rector 
Tower, the Central Library and the 
University Olympic Stadium used 
for the 1968 Olympic Games and 
the 1986 soccer World Cup. 
Seen from above, the open sta-
dium resembles a volcano surg-
ing out of the earth. Like other CU 
buildings, it was constructed out 
of volcanic stone from the Xitle. 
Famous Mexican painter Diego Ri-
vera (1886-1957), known for his 
murals, decorated its façade with 
a high-relief multicoloured mosaic 
symbolizing the homeland, peace, 
the university and sports. “This 
masterpiece of Diego Rivera’s 
mural painting was intended to 
retrace the history of sport in the 
pre-Hispanic and contemporary 
world and to continue all along the 
stadium’s enclosure, but it was left 
unfinished,” says Lourdes Cruz. 
Another symbolic building, the 
Rector Tower, with its coat of arms 
representing a double-headed bird 
(Mexican eagle and Andean con-
dor) and its aphorism, “The spirit 
will speak through my race”, is fur-
ther proof that in Mexico, art and 
architecture are one. The facades 
of this high tower, a landmark stu-
dents rely on, is adorned with three 
painted murals by another famous 
Mexican, David Alfaro Siqueiros 
(1896-1974), with eloquent titles: 
“People for the university - the uni-
versity for the people”, “Dates in 
the history of Mexico” and “New 
University emblem”. 
The painter and architect Juan 
O’Gorman (1905-1982), born 
of an Irish father and Mexican 
mother, gave us the 4,000 square 
metres of frescoes covering the 
Central Library facades. Thanks 
to O’Gorman, the outside walls of 
the ten-storey building decorated 
in multicoloured stones from dif-
ferent regions of the country tell 
the story of Mexico from the pre-
Hispanic era to modern times, dra-
matizing the age-old duality of life 
and death. 
Space  
for involvement 
With 18 departments, six national 
schools and 28 research institutes, 
the CU provides fantastic study 
space. But it also provides space 
for leisure. Its platforms and stair-
cases open to the sky, recalling 
those of pre-Hispanic cities like 
Teotihuacan (north of Mexico City) 
and Monte Albán (Oaxaca, south 
of the country), are crammed with 
students resting or rehearsing the-
atre pieces, taking advantage of the 
décor and the acoustics. “We have 
a feeling of freedom,” says Zully 
Góngora, drama student, who with 
a group of schoolmates is prepar-
ing a play in front of a wall made of 
volcanic stone and decorated with 
pre-Hispanic symbols. 
And Luis Alberto García, a gradu-
ate of the political science depart-
ment at UNAM, adds, “We Pumas 
are proud of CU, not just because 
of its architecture but also because 
some of our country’s great thinkers 
passed through its lecture halls.” He 
mentions, among others, three Mex-
ican Nobel Prize winners: Alfonso 
García Robles (Peace, 1982), 
Octavio Paz (Literature, 1990) et 
Mario Molina (Chemistry, 1995).

nated in the tragically well-known 
massacre of Tlatelolco, which 
occurred outside its walls 10 days 
before the start of the 1968 Olym-
pic Games. Students have also 
held regular major strikes – 1968, 
1987, 1999 – aimed primarily at 
defending free public education, 
as guaranteed by the Mexican 
constitution. So far, they have been 
successful.
