and screen-writer.
His film Cyrano
de Bergerac won
ten Césars, the
French national
film award.
> When did you first become
a film-goer?
It was just before the Second
World War. I enjoyed Walt Disney's
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
and The Adventures of Robin Hood
directed by Michael Curtiz and William
Keighley. I saw them in Auxerre, the
town where I was born, in the Grand
Casino, which was also used for
stage plays. And the theatre was my
first great love.
At the end of the war American
films poured into Europe, and like
every other teenager I raced to see
them. We started a film club in Aux¬
erre, and I was one of the organizers.
That's where I really started to learn
about the cinema and love films.
I remember Eisenstein's The Gen¬
eral Line and The Battleship Potemkin
and Pudovkin's Mother. When I was
fifteen, in 1947, I was stunned by
Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. I saw
that you could use all kinds of the¬
atrical devices in the cinema but go so
much farther than the theatre. It was a
turning point in my life. The supreme
art for me ceased to be the theatre and
became the cinema.
I thought of nothing else but
making films. I talked my father into
buying me a camera if I passed my
baccalaureate. He kept his word, and
while I was studying law studies
which I never finished I also began
making films on my own in the coun¬
tryside.
A little while later, when I was about
twenty, I met a producer and worked
for the next three years as his assis¬
tant. Then I made a few industrial

shorts and a short commissioned film
called Chronique provinciale ("Provin¬
cial Chronicle").
ft What made you take the
plunge and become a
director?
With Alain Cavalier, I had produced
an outline for the film that was to
become A Matter of Resistance.
When I actually began to write the film,
I noticed that the dramatic situations
we had invented inevitably turned into
comedy. I called Alain to talk to him
about this and told him I was worried.
He answered, "Don't stop, whatever
you do! Let it come!" I shot the film In
1965. It received the Prix Delluc and
was a box-office hit. Since then I've
never stopped, although I go at my
own pace which is rather slow.
Today I am happiest directing big
pictures like Cyrano de Bergerac or Le
hussard sur le toit ("The Hussar on
the Roof"). I think that's what I was
made for.
ft What about the technical
stuff?
I picked it up gradually, especially
through making advertising films
where I really discovered and devel¬
oped the techniques of cinema, espe¬
cially as my approach to films was
rather literary. I started making adver¬
tising films after my third feature,
Lovers like Us.
ft What future do you see for
the cinema?
That's the big question. Business
and artistic problems are intertwined.
Here in Europe we have got to resist
the American offensive and at the
same time ask how to renew the film
medium. Hasn't it all been said before?
But all my doubts fade away when
I talk to my two sons. Their enthu
siasm for the cinema is intact. They
know all the interesting films that are
going to come out. They rush to see
them, then talk about them. I'm
expecting a comeback of film fandom,
with different masters and different
landmarks. No, basically, I have no
fears about the future of the cinema.
ft What are your feelings
about aufceurcinema?
I respect and like auteur films. I am
completely convinced that the cinema
needs auteurs. I hope I'm one of
them. Moreover when I write and
develop my films, I try to write with the
public in mind. It's extremely impor¬
tant. Without losing an iota of my
ambition, I've always got the public in
mind. I like to think that I'm "a film-goer
who makes films".
