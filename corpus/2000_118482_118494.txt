A new are n a
for individual i n i t i a t i v e
Zaki Laïdi* believes that politics today revolves round three unequal poles: the state
(slimmed down but still alive and kicking), the market and civil society
There is a lot of talk about the weakening of the
state’s role in national and international life.
What exactly is the situation?
In the last twenty years or so, the state’s regulatory
p owe rs have declined.This decline began in the eco-
nomic fie l d ,with the 1973 world oil crisis in the ri c h
c o u n t ri e s , which noticed that their economies no
longer automatically responded to kick-start mea-
sures imposed from above. It was then that people
s aw how far the Keynesian model of economics had
broken down.
Three things happened in the 1980s to speed
up this process.The first was ideologi c a l . It was asso-
ciated with the advent of new governments in Bri-
tain and the United States which were strongly
opposed to state interve n t i o n .These gove rn m e n t s
f u rther discredited the stat e ’s role as a social and
economic regulat o r. S e c o n d l y, in the mid-1980s,
the deregulation of financial markets and the free
m ovement of capital began.This was a major tur-
ning point.T h i r d l y, the collapse of the Berlin Wa l l
rubbished the ideology of socialism and socialist
policies around the world.
How have these changes been transmitted to the
South?
Mainly through the structural adjustment pro-
grammes of the Intern ational Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank, b e ginning in the 1980s.
This process had mixed results, depending on the
c o u n t ry invo l ve d . But the pressure of stru c t u r a l
adjustment was ve ry strong until the 1997-98 A s i a n
economic cri s i s , when we saw the effects of exces-
s i vely rapid and poorly-organized economic 
liberalization.
Is there a link between the reduction of govern-
ment economic regulation and the emergence of
civil society?
Yes and no.There is no automatic relat i o n s h i p. I n
most countries of the South and the East where eco-
nomic pri vat i z ation has been put into effect, yo u
can usually see that traditional elites have jumped
on the bandwagon and taken control of the
resources made available by pri vat i z at i o n .This is
w hy there is more talk about the pri vat i z ation of the
s t ate rather than about the pri vat i z ation of the eco-
nomy. So we must avoid being overly simplistic.
At the same time, the loss of confidence in the
s t at e , its diminishing redistri bu t o ry functions and its
increasing ineffectiveness have spurred the members
of society to take action and to abandon their 
deference to the stat e . In human rights and the env i-
r o n m e n t , for example, NGOs have triggered new 
i n i t i at i ves that gove rnments have been forced to act
o n .
Fragments of a worldwide public awareness are
n ow having their say. I t ’s impossible to hold a wo r l d
conference about anything these days without 
i nvolving NGOs, which are a kind of indicator of
the democratization of world relations.
Why is this?
Because they encourage and fa c i l i t ate the wo r l d ’s
p l u r a l i z at i o n .S t ates have lost their monopoly of vio-
lence and of authori t at i ve declarat i o n .We ’re seeing
an extraordinary and far-reaching reconfig u r at i o n
of power into three components—the stat e , the mar-
ket and civil society.
But bewa r e . Here too we must avoid stereotypes
and utopianism.These playe rs are not necessari l y
opposed or in contradiction with each other. It is
too abstract simply to say that “civil societies” a r e
in process of taking powe r. Something far more
complex is going on.There is now a stronger and
more complicated interaction between the three
components of power I’ve been talking about. A n d
they aren’t very equal components either.
A l s o, we mustn’t forget that gove rnments can
be tempted to outsource their functions and get
va rious groups or the pri vate sector to take over res-
ponsibilities they formerly assumed.Yo u ’re not going
to understand much about what ’s happening if yo u
look at it in terms of a zero-sum game.
What role do you think civil society will play in
the future?
As I said, I think we ’re moving more and more
t owards a kind of tri p a rtite politics, a s s o c i at i n g
g ove rn m e n t , the pri vate sector and social gr o u p s.
But I don’t think the stat e ’s retreat means the end
of politics.That would be an enormous step back-
wards which would bring us face to face with the
nightmare of the 17th-century English philosopher
Thomas Hobbes of a “ war of eve ry one against eve ry
o n e ” . So the really important thing is to expand the
frontiers of politics,to think about politics beyond
the stat e .After all, e ve rything of concern to the com-
munity is politics. And what people call “the cri s i s
of politics” va ries in intensity from society to socie-
t y. I t ’s always more noticeable in countries where
there is only limited mediation by cultural and wo r-
k e rs ’m ovements between gove rnment and society.
In these cases, when the state gets we a k e r , s o c i e t y
feels weaker too.
I want to stress one point.The state isn’t dead,
far from it. E ven in the developed wo r l d , p u b l i c
expenditure has risen as a percentage of gross

n ational product in eve ry single country. This is
because the solemn responsibilities of the state remain
ve ry gr e at in the domains of social securi t y, p e n s i o n s
and debt repay m e n t .There are also gr owing demands
on the state in several areas, including educat i o n .S o
the state isn’t dead, just a certain conception of it—
one that makes refri g e r at o rs , for example.
E ven civil societies need an organized state in
which to flo u ri s h , one anchored in the rule of law
and capable of expressing va rious demands and
c o n c e rns at an intern ational leve l . The recent
attempt in Seattle to launch a new round of world
trade negotiations shows the tightly-knit relat i o n-
ship between gove rnments and economic and social 
players.
What’s the role of new information technology in
the emergence of a worldwide civil society?
A tremendous one, p r ovided of course that yo u
d o n ’t look for ove rsimplistic explanat i o n s. I t ’s
obvious that the Internet plays a decisive role in
mobilizing people about the env i r o n m e n t ,h u m a n
rights and trade.The speed at which inform ation is
exchanged gr e atly strengthens the building of cam-
paign plat f o rm s. It undoubtedly takes less time to
mobilize social groups than to mobilize states. But
once again, t h e r e ’s no innate conflict between the
t wo. One might think, for example, t h at the social
m o b i l i z ation of Europeans against genetically-
modified organisms is an important bargaining
counter for the European Commission as it fa c e s
the United States. n
