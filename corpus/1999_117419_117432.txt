At the school in Mujina, a couple of hours by
road from the Rwandan capital of Kigali, t h e
t e a c h e rs have gathered for a day of instru c-
tion about Aids organized by the NGO E n fants réfu-
giés du monde.They all admit to being confused:
w h at can we do? they ask.Their pupils start hav i n g
sex quite early on—around 16 for boy s , but much
e a r l i e r , from about 12 and up for gi r l s , who are often
pestered and harassed by adults.The teachers all
a gree that the school is ideally situated to reach
young people in efforts to prevent the spread of the
d i s e a s e . But how exactly can they get the message
across to their pupils? 
The curriculum officially includes lessons about
Aids and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), bu t
t e a c h e rs have not been taught how to tackle these sub-
j e c t s.They don’t have books or other written mat e-
ri a l , their own knowledge is limited and mainly obtai-
ned from the radio. Their mother tongue lacks
euphemisms for sexual mat t e rs.And even the most
energetic teachers shy away from the subject for fear
of being accused by parents of corrupting the minds of
their children.
An ‘internal army’
“As a result,”s ays a pri m a ry school inspector,“ m o s t
of them just don’t teach the classes they’re supposed
t o.”According to one female teacher,“ i t ’s impossible in
R wanda to talk about sex with children under 12.”
A team from the Rwandan Child to Child pro-
gramme gi ves a one-day crash course on a teaching
method by which children learn to be more concer-
ned about their own health and that of others.T h e
training aims to equip the teachers with inform at i o n
about Aids and techniques for tackling the subject.
Right from the start,the team reminds partici-
pants that A i d s , unlike any other sexually transmit-
ted disease, is a blood disease, not one directly affec-
ting sexual organs. From this angle, t e a c h e rs can
handle the matter more calmly, like any other infec-
t i o n .The problem is that many teachers are unclear
about the va rious functions of blood.With malari a
widespread in the regi o n , they know that red blood
cells carry ox y g e n , but they are less familiar with
white ones or with problems of the immune system.
Basic inform ation about blood is conve yed with
the help of games and ve ry brief talks.The immune
s y s t e m , for example, is presented as a professionally
organized “ i n t e rnal army ”which attracts their at t e n-
t i o n .They overcome their shyness and join in acting
A c ra s h c o u rse for teachers

During a day of role-playing and discussion, Rwandan teachers learn to broach the subject 
of Aids in the classroom without shyness or fear
w Member of the “Child to Child”programme, Institute of
Health and Development, Université Paris VI (France)
out how the virus attacks the body and how the va ri o u s
p a rts of the immune system fight back. A “ M r. H I V ”
and a “ M r. M a l a ri a ” gi ve talks about the virus and
h ow it spreads.
Before looking at how the virus enters the human
b o d y, the teachers are asked to draw the male and
female genitals.Ve ry few are comfortable doing so.
But making a life-size model of the female genitals,
using what e ver is at hand (an avocado pear for the
u t e ru s , for example) is met with enthusiasm. A pre-
s e n t ation about the different stages of Aids gi ves the
t e a c h e rs a chance to talk at length about the disease,
which is so present in their eve ry d ay life and ye t
remains inv i s i b l e .
After several further scientific points have been
m a d e , the question of prevention is tackled. T h e
Fleet of Hope, a book written by Bernard Jo i n e t , a
C atholic missionary and professor of psychology at
Ta n z a n i a ’s Unive rsity of Dar es Salaam, is used.
Aids is presented as a kind of Biblical flood and the
class “ e m b a r k s ” on one of three “ a r k s ” — a b s t i n e n c e ,
fidelity or condom—to escape drowning.
An eva l u ation of the training shows that teachers
feel it is vital to improve their scientific know l e d g e .
But this isn’t enough for them. Students in higher
grades are asking them all sorts of questions about
s e x u a l i t y, which they are at a loss to answe r. n
