THE RIDDLE OF OUR ATMOSPHERE
MEN
AGAINST
DISEASE
THE atmophere enveloping
the earth is a beneficent
cloak that not only
sustains the breath of life in
man and other animals, but
provides an effective shield
against the lethal agents raining
in on our planet from outer
space. Miraculously, our atmo-
sphere abounds in the life-
giving oxygen needed for breath-
ing. Other planets, insofar as
they have an atmosphere at all,
are wrapped in choking blankets
of strange gases such as
methane or ammonia. If
breathing animals exist in such
worlds, they must have a kind
of body chemistry quite un-
known to us.
The numerous meteors that
flash brilliantly in the night
skies would be devastating and
deadly missiles were it not for
the air. These fragments of
cold stone, hurling themselves
at our planet with a hundred
times the speed of a rifle bullet,
are heated so intensely by
friction with the air that they
usually burn or vaporize com-
pletely before reaching the
earth. Of the millions that
impinge each day, only an occa-
sional one will be large enough
to survive complete disintegra-
tion. It may then
crash to earth
with spectacular
and sometimes
destructive effect.
Even more im-. ...-a... 4 al41,portant than the mechanical
protection it affords is the
optical defence that the atmo-
sphere provides. This it is able
to do because of the formation
of a gas called ozone, generated
under the action of the searing
ultra-violet rays present in sun-
light. Ordinary oxygen gas
consists of molecules, each
made up of two atoms of this
element.
Ozone molecules, on the other
hand, are transient structures,
each constituted of three oxygen
atoms. They originate in the
region from about nine to 25
miles above the earth, but would
occupy a layer hardly more than
a twelfth of an inch thick if
confined at the pressure obtain-
ing at ground level. Yet this
mere film of gas is all that
stands between us and scorching
death from the sun's rays. On
such slender threads does
terrestrial life hang.
How far upward does the
atmosphere extend, and what
is its structure and condition at
various levels ? It may be said
that except for the part directly
accessible to earthbound man,
we had very little detailed
knowledge on these questions
before the beginning of the
present century, With the
coming of the aeroplane, heights
of up to about 60, 000 feet were
finally attained. Sounding bal-
loons carrying instruments can
be sent up to more than twice
this height.
In 1898, the French meteoro-
logist de Bort described and
named two fairly well-defined
atmospheric layers or shells-
the troposphere, extending from
the surface to an altitude of
about 45, 000 feet, and then the
stratosphere upward from this
point. Nearly a quarter of a
century later, by studying the
way in which radio waves are
reflected back to earth, Kennelly
in America and Heaviside in
England recognized the exist-
ence of a still loftier region call-
ed the ionosphere, beginning
at about 50 miles and extending
perceptibly to heights as great
as perhaps 2, 000 miles.
The troposphere, the locale in
which we live out our existence,
is the tumultuous region of wind
and weather, of clouds and
storms. Nearly four-fifths of
the air near sea level is nitrogen,
and about one-fifth is oxygen.
The chemically inert gas argon
and carbon dioxide together
account for less than one per

cent, while the very last
hundredth of a per cent is made
up of the other rare and inert
gases and of mere traces of
hydrogen and ozone. In addition
to these permanent members,
there are varying amounts of
water vapour, dust and bacteria.
One of the most striking
facts about the atmophere is
the rapid diminution of pressure
from height-a direct result of
the compressibility of gases
under the weight of the layers
lying above. It was the English
astronomer Halley, early in the
eighteenth century, who des-
cribed this pressure variation.
If one ascends about 17, 000 feet,
the pressure will be half its
value at sea level ; rising an
additional 17, 000 feet will bring
the pressure down to a quarter
of the initial amount, and so on.
But this smooth and simple
variation was later found to
hold only in the lower regions
of the air.
Compared with the tropo-
sphere, the stratosphere, lying
just above it is calm and
untroubled. Man himself has
been able to explore only its
very lowest layers, but quite
recently he has succeeded in
sending high altitude rockets up
through it and
even into the
ionosphere. An
occasional cloud.
the trails of me-
teors and atomic
'\u tno", nC ! 1"'r'\ ;"""'Q'Udebris left by the cosmic rays
are its only habitual visitors.
Studies of the manner in
which sounds are reflected back
to earth from the stratosphere
have given science much in-
formation about this region.
The ionosphere has been well
investigated up to heights of
about 500 miles, but there is
evidence that this outermost
region of the atmosphere
reaches perceptibly to over four
times this attitude before
abandoning its thrust into
interplanetary space. At such
heights the air must be far
more tenuous than the best
vacuum we can produce in the
laboratory.
Measurement of the manner
in which radio waves are sent
back to earth shows that there
are several layers of ionized, or
partially disrupted, atoms in the
ionosphere-hence its name.
Both the structure and the
composition of this region are
continually changing in res-
ponse to the influx of the fierce
radiation from the sun, of
cosmic rays and of electrified
atoms from outer space. In
addition, there is evidence for
the existence of violent and
tempestuous winds h a v i n g
many times the speed of the
most devastating gales ever
encountered at the earth's sur-
face.
More remarkable still is the
indication that temperatures
in the ionosphere range up to
2, 700 degrees Fahrenheit. This
does not mean, however, that
an object rising to these heights
would be burnt to a crisp.
Rather, it must be remembered
that temperature is merely a
measure of the speed of motion
of the atoms or molecules of a
substance.
Rockets now send automati-
cally to earthbound observers
radio messages of, for instance,
temperature, pressure, cosmic
ray intensity and solar radia-
tion. They can even collect
actual samples of the air at
various heights. Such data will
be valuable in answering ques-
tions concerning the origin,
structure and composition of
the atmosphere, and may
ultimately make possible the
long-range prediction of
weather conditions on earth.

IT was pitch dark and a sinister hourof night to be nosing through a
mangrove swamp. Every mangrove
root, arching high out of the water, looked
like a gargantuan spider or a petrified
octopus.
The throb of the engine startled the
wild life of the swamp. A slither and a
splash. A scurry through the branches.
The flapping of unseen wings. A cry. A
screech...
This was neither the time nor the
place to go pleasure cruising. But the
floating dispensary had an appointment to
keep. It had to be at its moorings at the
next village, in time to catch the fishermen
before they left at dawn for their fish-
traps in the delta.
No better example could be found of
the practical difficulties and resource-
fulnesss of Men Against Disease in the
heart of the equatorial jungles than these
floating dispensaries"doing their rounds."
In Sarawak and,
indeed, in the whole
of Borneo, the third
largest island in the
world, a major pro-...'"....'1.'1blem for the health authorities is com-
munications. Before medical science can
help people, it must reach them-a pro-
digious task in this island of swamp and
jungle and remote, often unexplored
uplands. There are few roads or even
paths or trails. In the whole 47, 000
square miles of the British Crown Colony
of Sarawak there are only 460 miles of
roads-and for 400 of these,"road"is
a courtesy title.
So the only practical way is by water.
And water means treacherous coastal
currents, swamp channels and jungle
rapids. This hazardous mode of travel
has made the Dyaks into redoubtable
watermen. The name Sea Dyaks (as
distinguished from the Land Dyaks) is
applied to people who live remote from
the sea, and is a reminder that the
first contact which the outside world had
with the Borneans was as head-hunting
pirates, whose skill in manoeuvring their
frail land boats far out at sea and their
addiction to chopping off heads made
them the terror of the Eastern trade
routes.
Civilization, then, must follow the
routes of barbarism and penetrate the
remote parts by water. The British
Colonial Development and Welfare Fund

- two out-station and 16 mobile. The
