A
s the violence between Israelis and
Palestinians spirals and cooperation is
considered an act of treason, both sides
continue to work together on a single issue:
w a t e r. In Fe b r u a r y, six months after the
intifada erupted, Israel and the Palestinian Au t h o r i t y
( PA) jointly called upon their people to keep water
and wastewater infrastructure out of the cycle of
d e s t r u c t i o n .The reason is simple:both of their systems
are intertwined.
The Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Committee,
set up under the Oslo A g r e e m e n t s, is probably the
only common framework to survive the past year.
Despite sealed borders and gunfir e, the committee
regularly meets to deliver water in the West Bank,
where many wells and springs have gone dry,e s p e c i a l l y
as the current drought scorches a second year. Talks
and action revolve around practical issues—repairing
pipes or delivering chlorine. Yet plans to construct
new wells, which the Palestinians desperately need

If common sense p r e va i l s
Despite sealed borders and gunfire, Israeli and Palestinian experts
continue to meet on the sidelines in an attempt to hammer out
a way of sharing their blue gold

and were promised in Oslo, have been abandoned.
The violence of the past year has killed the formal
discussions on redistributing water supplies and
recognizing Palestinian sovereign rights over natural
r e s o u r c e s.The Israeli government no longer considers
water to be a technical issue but a matter of national
s e c u r i t y.According to the hawks, I s r a e l ’s very existence
depends upon military and political control of the
Palestinian Te r r i t o r i e s, especially the West Bank which
provides for 25 percent of Israeli water needs.
Talking dollars
and cents
This obsession with security is certainly not new in
I s r a e l . Even before the intifada, environmental issues
were cast as threats, sold to the public as “ w a t e r
s e c u r i t y ” or “food security.” The Western press in
particular has towed this line, peddling stories about
water inevitably killing prospects for peace. Yet the
truth of the matter is that hydrologists and civil
engineers on both sides have been steadily developing
possible long-term agreements. While formal
discussions of these plans are now taboo, technicians
and government experts from across the region are
continuing to meet quietly, beyond the reach of hawks
on all sides. Here is an outline of a plan we have in
mind.
First a bit of background.Palestinians each have
about 85 cubic metres per year for all of their needs—
d o m e s t i c, industry and agriculture.Average use among
Israelis is 447 cubic metres per year. In the West Bank,
about 25 percent of the population doesn’t have
running water, even though this area is relatively rich
in groundwater thanks to the Mountain A q u i f e r, f r o m
which  Israel pumps about 85 percent of its yield. H e r e
lies the heart of the dispute.
The famous Mountain Aquifer actually consists
of three different ones—situated in the east, n o r t h w e s t
and west of the mountain.The media tends to paint the
Eastern Aquifer as a political minefie l d ,yet the path to
resolution is far from tortuous. The Palestinians can
rightfully claim absolute sovereignty over the aquifer

which lies entirely within their territory. Byinstalling
pumps after 1967,Israel has apparently contravened
international rules concerning military occupation.
The decision to give up this aquifer is not as painful as
it might seem. It is the poorest of the three in terms of
water quantity and quality.
The rest is not so clear- c u t , as seen with the We s t e r n
Aquifer, the largest of the three.About 80 percent of
the recharge basin—the area in which rain and streams
trickle down into the aquifer—lies in Palestine.
H o w e v e r, that water naturally
flows underground into Israel,
where most of it is pumped.
Palestinians claim that they
own the water because it
originates in their territory. A t
the same time,Israelis invoke the
cardinal international right of
historic use—they were the first
to tap into and develop this
source about 80 years ago through an agreement with
the British Mandate (in a concession to a Je w i s h
contractor).
Debates over water rights generally turn in circles.
While there is clearly a need to recognize both sides’
sovereign rights to natural resources, i n t e r n a t i o n a l
law and common sense directs us to find a “ r e a s o n a b l e
and equitable” use of the water.How do you determine
a fair deal? You cannot quantify a right to water, but
you can calculate the need for it.
Everyone—Palestinians and Israelis—should be
entitled to a minimum of 100 metres3 per year for
domestic and industrial use. To do this, Israel would
have to reallocate  100 to 200 more million metres3 o f
water each year to Palestinians. No state leader wants
to give up control over a resource, especially one so
precious and politically explosive as water. But there
is another way of evaluating the trade-off: in dollars and
cents.
Water equals money. Each cubic metre of water in
Israel is worth an estimated $0.20/m3. So the water in
dispute amounts to between $20-40 million a year—or
about 0.05 percent of Israeli GDP. This isn’t worth
fighting over. It is money well spent.
The economic value of water is obviously not new
in the Middle East. For years,
thirsty governments have been
trading in “virtual water”—
economists actually calculate the
water it takes to grow fruit and
v e g e t a b l e s. So by importing
tomatoes and oranges, f o r
e x a m p l e, governments are
actually buying cheap, b i o -
degradable packets of water. I t ’s
a lot easier and cheaper to import a tonne of fruit and
vegetables than the water it takes to grow it.
We want to expand this trade.To begin with, I s r a e l i
farmers can no longer earn a living by feeding their
c o u n t r y, which is accustomed to a costly We s t e r n
l i f e s t y l e. Not so for the Palestinians. Both Israel and the
Palestinian Authority currently allocate about 80
percent of their respective water supplies to
agriculture. In Israel, farmers make up about three
percent of the labour force and contribute three
percent of the GDP. In Gaza and the West Bank, a
third of workers depend upon agriculture, w h i c h
accounts for about a third of the GDP. So it is no
surprise to find that Israel buys the entire surplus
from farms in the West Bank and Gaza, p r o v i d i n g
Can this trade expand? Farmers setting up irrigation for agriculture in Jiftlik Valley, near Nablus.
For years, thirsty 
governments
in the Middle East
have been trading in
“virtual water”

for one-twelfth of the country’s fresh fruit and
vegetable needs. We suggest that they both use this
trend to their advantage and that of their neighbour,
Jordan.
Over the next 10 to 15 years, all three parties
should agree to increase the supply of irrigation water
in Palestine and Jordan.There are several options for
finding the extra water within the Jordan Va l l e y : a
redistribution of supplies from the Mountain A q u i f e r
and the Jordan River. R a i n - h a r v e s t i n g, t r e a t e d
wastewater and improved infrastructure (40 percent of
water is lost to leaky pipes in some Palestinian
m u n i c i p a l i t i e s ) . New sources further afield might also
open up. For example, Lebanon might sell water from
the Litani River which could be stored in Lake Ti b e r i a s.
The new Unity Dam,under construction by Jordan and
Syria,also holds potential.
Desalination: the saviour?
No one loses in this proposal. Palestinians and
Jordanians see a steady increase in the number of
agricultural jobs at a time of staggering unemployment.
They also gain a guaranteed market for crops and by
cultivating more land, Palestinian farmers lay the seeds
for new settlements. We are not suggesting that
Palestine base its economy on agriculture in the long-
term.No country in the Middle East can afford to do
so financially or environmentally. But after decades of
occupation,Palestinians cannot be expected to leap-
frog economically.
Despite Israel’s cultural attachment “to making the
desert bloom,” the state will have to cut back on
f a r m i n g. By allocating more water to Palestinians and
Jo r d a n , it would not only gain a secure source of cheap
fresh food, but the country’s hi-tech industry would
grow by selling irrigation technologies as well as high-
profit seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.
Fi n a l l y, the international community could
“ r e w a r d ” such a regional plan by setting up an
international fund for research and development in
water desalination. For this is clearly our most likely
option in the very near future.
In the next 20 to 30 years, the Israeli and Palestinian
populations are expected to double as their respective
diasporas immigrate to the region, especially with
formal recognition of a Palestinian state. Every drop
of fresh water will be required to fulfill domestic needs.
Desalination will be the saviour. Today the process
costs about $0.65/m3, which is still far too expensive,
especially for agriculture. (In the Middle East, a cubic
metre used for irrigation brings an economic return of
just $0.50 to $1.00).Yet it is still cheaper than importing
from the region’s hydrological baron,Tu r k e y,which has
proposed constructing a “peace pipeline”to deliver and
sell its blue gold at
$0.95/m3.
This proposal may appear to be a naïve attempt to
deny the escalating violence.Yet from where we stand,
it would be absurd and even criminal to give up on our
work.In the very near future, technicians from both
sides and beyond will be meeting outside the region to
continue to informally discuss and refine this proposal.
Contrary to popular belief,water in the Middle East is
not a source of war, but ingenuity. ■
