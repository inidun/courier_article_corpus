THE UNESCO GIFT COUPON SCHEME
Y OL' : \'G people following world
e\'ents these days often ask
themselves,"Is U thel'e any-
thing ? ue can do to help the
United Nations succeed ?"
There is. Unesco's Gift Coupon
Scheme offers students as well as
older persons who belong to vo-
luntary organizations, clubs or
other groups, a direct and per-
sonal part in the work of a United
Nations agency.
In fact, for some time, young
people in the schools of France,
the United Kingdom and the Unit-
eel States have been among the
pioneer in making the Gift Cou-
pon programme a successful
form of international co-operation.
They have been spending their
pennies, cents and francs so that
other people in less fayoured
countries throughout the world can
also have the advantages of edu-
cation. They have been selling
Gift Stamps and buying Gift Cou-
pons so that teachers, schoolchild-
ren, students of all ages and
types, artists and scientists can
obtain the books, films, micro-
scopes, music, and indeed equip-
ment of every kind that they need
for their work.
The Gift Coupon programme
was created by Unesco to help
struggling schools and other insti-
tutions of learning in under-deve-
loped and war-damaged countries
and at the same time to provide
voluntary organizations in the
more fortunate countries with a
practical way to join in the work
of the U. N. and Unesco.
L'nesco evolved the Gift Coupon
scheme when it realized that many
such voluntary organizations and
groups'were finding their efforts
to carry out programmes of inter-
national friendship hampered in
\'3. rious ways. Details about
worthwhile assistance projects
were hard to find. Buying, pack-
ing and shipping supplies pre-
sented troublesome, complicated
problems. A'nd fund raising for
sending gifts abroad had become
more difficult.
Unesco Gift Coupons eliminate
transportation problems as well as
currency difficulties. It enables
\'voluntary groups to send coupons
abroad to institutions of learning
whose needs have been made
known to them by Unesco. The
recipients themselves order the
equipment they need from a
list of suppliers who accept
the Coupons as a form of inter-
national currency. These sup-
pliers handle all shipping, packing
and crating, and are reimbursed
in their own currencies by Unesco.

A PRACTICAL WAY FOR SCHOOLS TO HELP THE U. N,
Gift Coupons, which are issued
in denomination of $10, fit, and
1, 000'Frenc h fmncs, al'e bought by
the voluntary donor group from
L'nesco which furnishes lists of
specific needs in padicular places.
The buyer of the Coupon can
decide whether, for example, he
want to provided tools for a funda-
mental education project in Burma
or Indonesia, laboratory equipment
or research apparatus for India,
radios or cinema equipment for
villages in Africa.
In order to make it easier for
clubs and other groups to buy a
$10 Coupon, L'nesco added a fund-
raising device to its programme-
the Gift Stamp. These are print-
ed in small denominations, such
as a-23 cent stamp, a 20 franc
stamp, a sixpenny stamp. These
stamps not only make it
connnient for children to parti-
cipate but they provide a symbolic
token for old and young as well.
Money raised by the sale of stamps
is sent by the donor group to
Unesco by cheque or money order,
and Unesco returns the Gift Cou-
pons to the group. These cou-
pons are then mailed by the donor
group directly to the recipient
together with a person-to-person
letter.
Thus, When a club or voluntary
organization adopts a Gift Coupon
project, it is on the l\\'ay to making
new friends in other parts of the
world, and is helping in a practical
way"to build peace in the minds
of men"which is L'nesco's goal.
Success after II months
THE Unesco Gift Coupon pro-gramme was launched experi-
mentally in the United States on
December 15, 1Ã¼50. On that date
the first twenty $10 Unesco Gift
Coupons \very purchased by the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors (Hunter College
Chapter, New York). They sent
half-$ 100 worth-to Professor
Franz Faltis at the Universitv of'
Vienna to help him obtain labo-
ratory equipment, books and scien-
tific periodicals. The other ten
coupons went to the University of
Wurzburg.
Eleven months later, the U. S.
National Commission for Unesco
pronounced the trial period a
success and gave the scheme its
complete endorsement. The Na-
tional Education Association, the
largest body of educators in the
United States, recommended offi-
cially that schools, teachers
and schoolchildren participate in
the programme as a means of
promoting international under-
standing and goodwill. Clubs,
schools, church groups, labour
unions, professional societies,
national and other organizations in
46 out of the 48 states undertook
gift projects.
By the middle of 195i, the
Unesco National Commissions of
the United Kingdom and France
decided to adopt the scheme. In
April 1052, Canadian groups
joined ; and by July of this year,
the number of donor countries had
risen to seven when Australia, the
German Federal Republic and the
Netherlands agreed to participate
in the programme. Meanwhile, in
New Zealand, the Council of Orga-
nization for Relief Service Over-
seas decided that a portion of its
funds would be converted into Gift
Coupons for selected projects.
Denmark. Japan, Norway, Sweden
and Switzerland are also consi-
dering participation as donor
countries.
The gift projects for the re-
ceiving'countries are carefully
chosen by Unesco from the most
urgent cases of needy schools and
other institutions in the under-
developed countries or those still
suffering the effects of \var.
Whenever t'nesco field officers or
experts, for example, find schools,
educational services, scientists or
artists whose work is important
for the development of their
countries but is retarded bv lack
of equipment or supplies, the facts
are reported back to Unesco in
Paris. Once approved the projects
are included in a Gift Coupon
"catalogue"and distributed to
prospective donor organizations.
1'he"catalogue"gives a general
background story summarizing the
salient historical facts and details
of each Gift Coupon project.
By July of this year, there were
more than 100 high-priority insti-
tutions in 37 countries listed as
Unesco Gift Coupon Projects.
Here are a few examples of
some of these institutions and of
the kind of material already
furnished to them through the
Unesco Gift programme :
Teacher Training College for
Girls, Kabul, Afghanistan : 10 mm.
sound projector and films, worth
$ 3, >0 ;
University of Rangoon, Burma :
laboratory equipment, $ 030 ;
Unesco Schools for Arab Re-
fugees in the Middle East ; 16 mm.

Leyte High Schoo), Tacyoban,
Philippines : laboratory equip-
ment, $ 200 ;
Hydro-Biological Research Ins-
titute, Lake Ohrid, Jugoslavia : mi-
crobalance and weights, $ 700.
In the donor countries school
teachers take an unusually active
part in the promotion of the pro-
gramme. In the United States,
they participate through their own
organizations. In France, with
the approval of the Ministry of
Education and the help of their
trade unions, they have introduced
the scheme in the public schools
and aroused the interest of their
pupils. In the United Kingdom,
it has also been the schools which
have been most active.
Corsica to India
NOT long ago, for example, aletter from a small town in
Corsica was sent to Mr. S. S. Ma-
thus, director of Janata College, a
rural education centre for Indian
peasants. The enwlope contained
a blue piece of paper, about the
size and shape of a bank cheque,
labelled'unesco Gift Coupon-
1, (joy Francs". The Corsican vil-
lage school whose fifteen pupils
collected the sum, had studied a
list of Janata's needs, ranging from
a 7, 000-franc farm implement to
several 1, 000-franc sewing kits.
The children decided they could
raise the 1. 000 francs for one
sewing kit, and received from
i'Unesco a booklet of fifty 20-franc
Gift Stamps to sell to their families
and friends.
About the same time, a similar
letter from the United States
reached my. gorge Yemenetsis in
Salonika, Greece. It contained
30 L'nesco Gift Coupons each for
$ 10.. Mr. Yemenetsis is Chairman
of the Anatolia College Alumni
Association's Committee for the
Adoption of Lefkohori village, and
the money came from a special
bazaar held bv the students of
Public School Number 221, Brook-
lyn, New York.
A third letter reached Professor
A.. I. vun del'Beek of Bandung,
Indonesia, on the other side of the
world. It contained 13 orange-
coloured Unesco Gift Coupons, of
one pound sterling each, and came
from the Bournemouth School for
Girls in Hampshire, England.
When these girls decided to join
the Unesco programme, they se-
lected Gift Project No. 23. 2-B-
"Kit of raffia-weaving materials,
fifteen pounds or fifteen Gift
Coupons."This unit was reserved
for the school by the Council for
Education in world Citizenship,
which manages the Gift Coupon
programme for the schools of
England, Wales and Scotland.
College and university students are
reached by the British World Uni-
versify Service, young peoples'
organizations by the World
Assembly of Youth, and adult
groups by the U. N. Association.
U. K. plans big campaign
PROCESSOR van der Beek hadsubmitted a list of his school's
urgent needs varying from vo-
cational training materials to a
$.) on instrument for measuring the
hearing of nearly-deaf children.
The children in Brooklyn had
learned through Unesco of the
needs of Lefkohori, one of a num-
ber of war-wrecked villages in
Northern Greece which have been
"adopted"by urban groups in
Salonika. These village"adop-
tion"groups or committees sup-
lement their relief and welfare
work with long-range educational
assistance for which they need
special teaching equipment, such
as film projectors and radios.
Dr. Luis Padilla Nervo, President
of Unesco's Sixth General Assem-
bly has said :
"Without doubt, this programme
will be accepted by the majority
of men, women and children in all
countries who desire to contribute
to peace, because I believe that
never before today has the will for
peace been more apparent in all
countries of the world. All the
world is convinced that peace must
be built in the minds of men, and
that this must begin with edu-
cation. Thus, to collaborate in this
Unesco activitv means also colla-
borating in the work of building
the peace."
The results of the programme in
the United States, the United
Kingdom and France seem to
confirm Dr. Padillo. Nerve's op-
timism. When the New York
State Classroom Teachers Asso-
ciation undertook to raise $ 1, 500
for the University of Vienna,
Mr. Erwin Coons, its president,
said :
"We started modestly with the
idea that our members would
purchase or sell 0, 000 Gift Stamps
during this school year, but our
original plan has mushroomed.
One county alone has already
taken more than the original
number of stamps we expected to
sell a) I year."
Since the programme was
launched experimentally in the
United States in December He50,
the value of the Gift Stamps
issued on consignment in that
country has mounted to the equi-
valent of about $ 120, 000 and the
Gift Coupons thus far sent to re-
1'ljHenl countries to a total 01 over
$ 40, 000. Ten national organi-
zations are among the large
number of educational, civic, pro-
fessional, religious and other
groups which are actively pro-
moting the scheme.
During the past year, twenty
state organizations of the De-
partment of Classroom Teachers of
the National Educational Asso-
ciation have adopted some $30. 000
worth of Gift Projects.
During the first half year of the
programme's operation in the
United Kingdom, groups in
England, Wales and Scotland
contribute Â£1, 070 for various
projects. Thus far, some twenty
different projects, each comprising
dozens of separate specified needs,
have been given assistance from
groups in the United Kingdom. A
big campaign is planned in
connexion with United Nations
nay on October 24 when pro-
minent national and international
personalities will visit schools.
universities, youth and adult
groups to describe the programme.
The most popular project among
United Kingdom donors thus far
has been Unesco's Arab Refugee
Schools in the Middle East.
Nearly fifty donations have been
sent in the form of Coupons to buy
basic school supplie, vocational
training and other equipment.
Other popular projects have been
the Village Adoption Scheme in
Greece, to which more than thirty
donations have been made, and the
School for Crippled Children in
Swiebodzin. Po) and, which has
received fifteen donations.
IN France, the programme hasalso caught the imagination of
schoolchildren and more than
100, 000 twenty-franc Gift Stamps
have been ordered by schools in
more than fifty French counties.
including those in North Africa and
Corsica. Coupons worth 1, 27>0, 00
francs have been bought. In the
Limoges region of Central France,
the Unesco Committee has been
particularly active, selling stamps
at the Limoges Fair as well as in
the schools. Coupons worth more
than 100, 000 francs, bought in the
Haute Yienne County, went to
Burma, Indonesia, India, Greece
and Ceylon. A half-dozen ele-
mentary schools in Corsica, includ-
ing tiny, one-room schools with a
dozen or so pupils, raised funds
varying from 1, 000 to 3, 000 francs
which were sent to the University
of Belgrade for French books, to
the Home for Crippled Children in
Sweibodzin, Poland, for occupa-
tional therapy materials, and, as
in the example cited previously, to
the Janata College in India for
sewing equipment.
L'nesco's Division of Yoluntary
International Assistance (VIA),
responsible for the Gift Coupon
Project, is soon to consolidate the
different Coupons which now exist
in doHar, franc and pound deno-
minations, into one unit of
currency. This is to be called
the L'NUM Gift Coupon. The
tel'm"CNTM"stand for"Cneseo
t'nit of Money". Each 1-UNUM
Gift Coupon will be sold for the
equivalent of five dollars in donor.
countries, and will avoid the
necessity of issuing new Gift
Coupons in national currencies as
additional countries join in.

HOW THE
SCHEME
WO RKS
Here is the procedure your
group should follow to partici-
pate in the Unesco Gift coupon
scheme :

ject. To do this, Unesco will of-
fer your organization the names
of a wide choice of schools,
universities, libraries, laborato-
ries and the like in over three do-
zen countries which have seriou
needs that can be met through
this plan.

When your organization hus
selected a project, Unesco will
send you, on consignment, Gift
Stamps worth 25 cents, sixpence,
20 francs or 20 pfennig. By
selling Unesco Gift Stamps to
finance a specific project your
membership not only collects
funds but helps. spread informa-
tion about the purposes of the
. UN and Unesco.
3
Each booklet of 40 Gift Stamp
sold pays for a Unesco Gift Cou-
pon worth ten dollars or one
pound. This is a special kind of
international money order bear-
ing the name of your organiza-
tion and of the recipient you and
Unesco have agreed upon. You
mail the Gift Coupons directly to
the recipient together with a per-
son-to-person letter. Your new
friends use the Coupons as
"foreign exchange"to buy the
specific items they need from
an approved supplier of their
choice. The supplier then sends
the coupons to Unesco to he
redeemed.
