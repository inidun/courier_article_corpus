The San José
Declaration
Regional Meeting for
Latin America and
the Caribbean
The representatives of the Latin-Amer¬
ican and Caribbean countries, meeting in
the city of San José, Costa Rica, from 1 8 to
22 January 1993, as part of the preparations
for the World Conference on Human
Rights, to be held in June 1993 in Vienna,
Austria,
1. We reaffirm our commitment to pro¬
moting and guaranteeing the full obser¬
vance of the human rights established in
the Universal Declaration and in universal
and regional human rights instruments,
through our own efforts and through
broad-based, non-selective and non-dis¬
criminatory international co-operation;
2. We reiterate that the World Conference
on Human Rights should be based on the
unconditional and indissoluble link
between human rights, democracy and
development;
3. We hold that the interdependence and
indivisibility of civil, political, economic,
social and cultural rights are the basis for
consideration of the question of human
rights, and therefore the exercise of some
cannot and must not be disallowed on the
pretext that full enjoyment of the others
has not yet been achieved;
4. We underline that respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms, the
strengthening of development, democracy
and pluralism in international relations
with full respect for the sovereignty, terri¬
torial integrity and political independence
of States, and the sovereign equality and
self-determination of peoples are the pillars
of our regional system;
5. We consider that the defence and
strengthening of representative democ¬
racy constitute the best guarantee of the
effective enjoyment of all human rights,
and stress that the rupture of the democ
ratic order threatens human rights in the
country concerned and has negative reper¬
cussions on the countries of the region,
particularly neighbouring countries;
13. We draw attention to the urgent need
to establish mechanisms and programmes
for the defence and protection of children
and adolescents, in particular, in relation to
abandoned and street children, and for
Governments to set up national commis¬
sions for the monitoring and follow-up
of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, made up of governmental and non¬
governmental organizations; we trust,
moreover, that the international concern
expressed at the situation of the children in
our region will translate into concrete
forms of co-operation with the pro¬
grammes and projects established at the
national level;
14. We reaffirm that Governments must
emphasize the implementation of actions
to recognize the rights of women, to pro¬
mote their participation in national life
with equality of opportunity, to eradicate
all forms of hidden or overt discrimination
on grounds of sex, race or social status
and, especially, to eliminate gender-based
violence, as well as all forms of sexual
exploitation. Wc recommend that the
World Conference promote the relevant
international instruments;
15. We welcome the celebration in 1993 of
the International Year of the World's
Indigenous People; we recognize the enor¬
mous contribution of indigenous peoples
to the development and plurality of our
societies and wc reaffirm our commitment
to their economic, social and cultural well-
being and our obligation to respect their
own initiatives and participation, recog¬
nizing the value and diversity of their cul¬
tures and their forms of social organiza¬
tion, without detriment to the unity of
the State;
16. We attach the utmost importance to the
observance of the human rights and fun¬
damental freedoms of vulnerable groups
and the elimination of all forms of dis¬
crimination against them, and to the devel¬
opment of norms which protect those
groups not yet covered by relevant instru¬
ments;
17. We attach the greatest importance to
consideration of the topic of disability and
human rights, and affirm that, in order to
ensure compliance with existing norms of
protection, there is a need to elaborate an
international convention that will provide,
on the basis of equality, for the full exercise
and enjoyment of the fundamental rights
of disabled persons, in order to incorporate
them fully into the active life of the com¬
munity, and to intensify efforts to prevent
disability;
18. We consider that efforts must be inten¬
sified to improve the situation of migrant
workers and their families according to
the principle of non-discrimination, and
we encourage Governments to adhere to
the International Convention on the Pro¬
tection of the Rights of All Migrant
Workers and Members of Their Families;
19. We express our commitment to pro¬
mote and protect all of the human rights
and fundamental freedoms of elderly per¬
sons, as established in national and inter¬
national instruments, and to guarantee the
full access of this vulnerable group to social
security benefits and to the specific pro¬
tection mechanisms recommended in the
Vienna International Plan of Action on
Ageing;
20. Wc recognize the need to respect the
princple of non-discrimination and to
guarantee the legal and social equality of
people infected with human immunodefi¬
ciency virus (HIV) and people with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(Aids), as well as their right to receive the
necessary treatment, and the need to take
public health measures to prevent the pro¬
liferation of this illness;
21. Wc reiterate our concern about, and our
condemnation of, the various forms of ter¬
rorism, including the activities of armed
groups that sow terror in the population
and of drug traffickers, who threaten the
exercise of democracy and arc serious
obstacles to the full realization of all human
rights and fundamental freedoms in our
region;
29. We stress that the promotion and
defence of human rights must be given
priority within the United Nations, and _ _
that this must be reflected in the distribu- ^t ¡S

A
*
tion of the Organization's budgetary
resources;
30. We stress the importance of strength¬
ening the Centre for Human Rights by
providing it with the necessary resources
so that it may expeditiously and effec¬
tively provide a wide range of human rights
advisory services, taking into account the
current historical, political and social sit¬
uation of requesting Governments;
31. We reaffirm the importance of incor¬
porating the topic of human rights issues
into the education imparted by States, and
recommend that its dissemination, both
theoretical and practical, be established
as a priority objective of educational
policies.
