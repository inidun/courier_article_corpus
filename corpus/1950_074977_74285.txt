Similar concerts will be held every
month ; programme notes will be
presented before each of the works,
and from time to time, the composers
themselves will discuss their works.
The history of this effort to make
new music known goes back two and
a half years ago, when the Radiodif-
fusion Fran√ßaise started what is
called in French"Le Banc d'Essai
des Jeunes Compositeurs". or"The
Trial Club"-a programme devoted
to works by young composers.
Then Unesco, in connection with
its efforts to stimulate the creative
activities of young artists in all
cultural fields, offered its co-opera-
tion to the Trial Club. As a result
the concerts were re-organized on a
broader and more professionnal
basis.
A committee of experts in touch
with all the public or private schools
of music throughout the world read
the musical works that reach them
from all countries. Each year, more
than fifty new works have been
made public.

A Better Chance For
YOUNG COMPOSERS
SOME composers meet with re-cognition-even fame-
when they are young. Two
centuries ago when Mozart was 13
his first opera was performed.
But despite the finish, elegance and
restraint of his work, and the
noble and royal patronage of his
day, he died in poverty. Most mu-
sicans have had to fight hard before
the public or the critics paid any
attention to their efforts. Many
received no real recognition until
after their death.
Unesco, working together with the
French Radio and the International
Music Council is now giving young
and unknown musical composers of
all nations a chance to have their
unpublished works performed before
critics and other people interested in
music.
On 1st February last a series of
regular monthly concerts of chamber
music and orchestral works by these
"unknowns"was started in the
Unesco House concert hall.
The first concert included quartets
written by five young composers :
Hector Tosare of Uruguay, Karol
