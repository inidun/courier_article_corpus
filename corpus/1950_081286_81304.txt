NEARLY 400 theatre groups
throughout the United
state, ranging from big
Broadway companies in
New York to small community
and school troupes in 45 states,
staged plays in March in
observance of International
Theatre Month. The celebra-
tion, sponsored by the Ameri-
can National Theatre and Aca-.
U. S. STAGE GROUPS OBSERVE
INTERNATIONAL THEATRE MONTH
demy in co-operation with the
U. S. National Commission for
Unesco, gave new and striking
proof that the theatre is a
living force for helping to pro-
mote understanding through
international cultural ex-
change.
The idea of a month devoted
to plays contributing to inter-
national understanding was
first suggested a. t last year's
U. S. National Conference on
Unesco. Planning is well-
advanced for a world-wide
observance next year of an
International Theatre Month
under the sponsorship of the
International Theatre Institute
(ITI) and Unesco.
Meanwhile, several countries
are already planning to hold
an International Theatre Week
later this year. In France, this
will take place in June to co-
incide with the holding in
Paris of the third ITI Congress.
Holland, Switzerland and other
ITI member countries also
plan to include theatre weeks
in existing art and music
festivals.
Last month's celebration in
America had a brilliant and
symbolic start in New York
with the world premiere of a
ballet with an international
flavour.
SYMBOLIC BALLET OPENS NAG
THIS new ballet,"Illumin-
nations", based on songs
by the French poet Ar-
thur Rimbaud was performed
by the New York City Ballet
Company. Three Englishmen
had co-operated in its creation
and presentation-Frederick
Ashton, the choreographer,
Benjamin1 Britten, the com-
poser, and Cecil Beaton, who
designed the sets.
Such major productions
formed only a part of the total
showings in 45 states plus
Alaska, Hawaii, the Panama
Canal Zone, Canada and
Japan. These were presented
by resident and travelling com-
panies, community theatres
and more than 120 university,
college, high school and
children's theatres
In Dads, Texas, theatre
audiences saw the American
premiere of"High Swing", the
first post-war comedy to come
to the United States from Ger-
majiy, written by Margo Jones
and translated by the English
playwright, AsMey Dukes.
At VMsar College, students
presented for the first time in
the United States Giraudoux's
"Electre".
Original plays, pageant,
ballets and radio and television
shows had been written by
American and foreign authors
especially for the national cel-
ebration. Each participating
group made its own choice of
the subject and form for its
presentation before its local
audience.
PROBLEMS OF UNUTO
"Home is to-morrow", a
drama hitherto un-
produced in America,
by the British author and
playwright, J. B. Priestley, was
presented in California, In-
diana, South Carolina and
Chicago. This play deals with
the problems of an imaginary
United Nations trusteeship
committee, UNUTO (United
Nations Under-developed Terri-
tories Organization).
It was J. B. Priestley who,
summing up the work of the
LT. L, once said :"A well
written play may do more
than fifty speeches by well
meaning politicians. A world.
in which an International
Theatre Institute is securely
established is a far safer and
more civilized world than one
in which the art of drama is
imprisoned between high na-
tional barriers,"
Last month's celebration
which enabled audiences from
Alaska to the Panama Canal
to fee performances ranging
from ancient Greek tragedy to
modern Shavian humour was
an outstanding effort to help
break down. barriers against
international cultural exchange
and world understanding.
