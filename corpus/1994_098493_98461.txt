SAYING THE ARAL:
THE DRAMA OF
CENTRAL ASIA'S
GREAT LAKE
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
In the wake oîperestroïka, banner
headlines such as "Aral Sea being
strangled to death" have brought
home to the world in the last few
years the scale of the ecological cat¬
astrophe caused by the gradual
drying-up ofthis vast lake wrongly
called a "sea" located in Central
Asia, in what used to be the Soviet
Union.
"For the first time in the history of
humanity", writes Professor Nikita
Glazovsky, First Deputy Director of
the Institute of Geography of the
Russian Academy ofSciences, "a lake
whose surface area is greater than
that of some countries is disap¬
pearing through human agency. The
deterioration of the environment is
responsible for declining health stan¬
dards among the population and the
growing child mortality rate. It is also
having a far-reaching impact on the
region's economic development."
Before 1960, theAral had a surface
area of66,000 square kilometres and
was the world's fourth largest lake,
but it has now slipped back to sixth
place. Following the collapse of the
Soviet Union, its catchment area is
now divided among five indepen¬
dent Republics Kazakhstan, Kyr-
gyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan. In the early 1960s, the
lake's average depth was 53.4 metres
and had notvaried by more than one
metre since the beginning of the cen¬
tury. Today it is no more than 38
metres. Thousands ofworkers were
employed in the fishing industry
and in 1962, nearly 40,000 tons of
fish were delivered to the canning
plants in the surrounding region.
Stockraising was also a flourishing
activity. The lake shore was girdled
by native forests, known as tungai,
and marshes whose flora and fauna
had adapted to the salinity of the
water. Now, its two former ports of
Munyak and Aral'sk are situated
some 40 kilometres inland. Their
fishing fleets, stranded high and dry
and rusting away, bear all the signs
of a ships' graveyard.
Soviet scientists started to sound
the alarm at the beginning of the
1970s, but the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet did not get around
to discussing the problem until
1986. It took twenty years for inter¬
national public opinion to get
moving. The geographer Monique
Mainguet, former head of the
Desertification Control Programme
Centre of the United Nations Envi¬
ronment Programme in Nairobi
(Kenya), has spent many years
studying the Aral. This is how she
describes the present situation:
"Because the water from the Aral's
two main tributaries, the Amu
Dar'ya and the Syr Dar'ya, has been
used for industrial-scale irrigated
cotton-growing, the lake's volume
has shrunk by 60 per cent and its
shoreline has receded by as much as
65 kilometres in some places. In
1942, its salinity level stood at 10
grams/litre, but it has now risen to
30 grams/litre and is responsible
for the disappearance of the original
flora and fauna. There is only one
remaining fish variety, and this is
unsuited to the once thriving fishing
All that remains of once thriving
fishing ports are rusting hulks
stranded on the sand.
and canning industries. As a result
of the emergence ofpart of the lake
bed above the water-line, salt par¬
ticles are picked up by the wind and
are carried for distances of hun¬
dreds of kilometres, polluting the
air and soil and both surface and
deep water deposits. The defects in
the irrigation systems responsible
for salt encroachment are com¬
pounded by the pollution caused
by the uncontrolled use of fertil¬
izers, herbicides, defoliants and pes¬
ticides. Drinking water and fruit and
vegetables have become toxic, par¬
ticularly for children".
A REGION INHABITED
SINCE THE OLD STONE AGE
Turania, the name by which geog¬
raphers often call Turkestan, is a
semi-desert plain covering an area
of 3.5 million square kilometres,
with a climate rather similar to that
of the sub-Saharan Sahel in Africa.
In their book on the Aral, Monique
Mainguet and the bio-geochemist
René Létolle explain the lake's role in
these terms: "Recent meteorolog¬
ical studies have shown that,
through evaporation from the lake
surface, the Aral created a sort of
mattress composed of moister air,
which varied with the seasons and
rose to an altitude of 9 kilometres.
The influence ofthis mattress used to

40
extend for distances ofseveral hun¬
dred kilometres southeast ofthe lake.
Through its local regulating effects,
Lake Aral gives rise to gende breezes
which are instrumental in creating a
milder climate well beyond the lake's
immediate shoreline". One of the
consequences of the drying-up of
the lake has accordingly been a
change in climate, which is gradually
growing harsher.
Even so, archaeological excava¬
tions have shown that the region
has been inhabited since the Lower
Palaeolithic era, in other words for
the past 100,000-300,000 years.
Although the arid plain is swept by
dust-laden winds, it forms a land
corridor in which a variety ofmodes
of production have been practised
at different periods. In the fifth mil¬
lennium B.C., agricultural settle¬
ments already existed in the
southern part ofpresent-day Turk¬
menistan. By the fourth millen¬
nium, cattle, sheep and goats were
being raised, and wheat, pome¬
granates and apricots were grown.
Irrigation was a very ancient prac¬
tice dating back to the eighth or
ninth millennia B.C., but owing to
its limited scale, it did not yet rep¬
resent a threat to the ecosystem.
COTTON-GROWING AND
AGRICULTURAL OVER-EXPLOITATION
The real danger came with mecha¬
nization. By 1843, there were already
more than thirty large canals and
an extensive secondary irrigation
network. "In 1918, during the
Russian Revolution," write Monique
Mainguet and René Létolle, "Lenin
signed a decree allocating 50 million
gold roubles to the development of
irrigation". In the agricultural sector,
priority was given to growing
cotton, for which there was a heavy
demand not only from the Soviet
textile industry but for use as gun-
cotton. Since a hot climate and
abundant amounts of water are
needed to grow cotton, the crop can
be said to be at the origin of the eco¬
logical disaster of the Aral.
In June 1993, Michael H. Glantz,
Alvin Z. Rubinstein and Igor Zonn
published a detailed study of theAral
in the magazine Global Environ¬
mental Change., inwhich theynoted:
"... in 1953 soil scientistViktorKovda
captured the spirit ofsocialist trans¬
formation when he wrote: 'the Party
. . . and the Soviet government are
doing everything possible to trans¬
form nature, to do awaywith deserts,
to attain a further big rise in agricul¬
tural productivity. . . . The grand pro¬
jects outlined by Stalin's genius . . .
will make it possible to master the
forces of nature in the U.S.S.R'.
Khruschev later reasserted a well-
known Soviet saying that his society
could not wait for nature to pro¬
duce benefits and that society must
extract those benefits from nature".
It was this short-sighted view of
things that was to cast such a blight
on the future.
It is true that, at the end of the
1980s, "modern" agriculture in
Turania supplied the former Soviet
Union with 95 per cent of its cotton,
40 per cent of its rice and 30 per
cent of its fruit. But at what a cost!
The figures for the agricultural
inputs responsible for pollution are
very impressive, ranging from 900
kilograms of fertilizer per hectare
for rice to 1,500 kilograms ofammo¬
nium sulphate, 100-200 kilograms
ofpotassium chlorate and 200-250
kilograms of superphosphate per
hectare for cotton and, to cap it all,
54 kilograms of pesticides per
hectare compared with only 3.5
kilograms in the rest of the Soviet
Union. Between 1960 and 1990,
118,000 tons of the highly toxic defo¬
liant known as "Agent Orange", used
by the Americans inViet Nam, were
sprayed in the Karakalpakstan
region south of the lake alone.
As a result of these practices,
there was a sharp decline in the
quality of the water in village wells
and ponds. People's health was
threatened: "the child mortality rate
of 51 per thousand is more than
double that for the former Soviet
Union, and 70 per cent of all adults
and 60 per cent of all children have
health problems". These figures
quoted by Monique Mainguet and
René Létolle are still increasing.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Professor Glazovsky ascribes the
drama of the Aral to the manage¬
ment errors made by Soviet officials,
who were paid according to the
number ofkilometres of canal they
built. Itwas therefore to their advan¬
tage to continue expanding an irri¬
gation network consuming vast
quantities ofwater. "One possibility
considered was to divert water to
theAral from Siberia or the Caspian
Sea. The same old mistakes should
not be made bypersisting in digging
more canals. The first step should
be to adopt legislation common to all
five Republics, but this will not be
easy because they do not necessarily
have the same interests."
Does the answer lie in action by
international organizations such as
the World Bank, the Global Envi¬
ronment Fund, or the United
Nations Development or Environ¬
ment Programmes? The Republics
concerned have appealed for inter¬
national assistance and nineteen
projects have already been put for¬
ward. The budget for the first stage
works out at some $50 million and
the second stage is expected to cost
$220 million. As the World Bank
acknowledges in its report of 26
April 1993: "Aside from the daunting
technical problems, the greatest risk
to the success of the proposed pro¬
grammes would be the failure of
the Republics to co-operate and
make the required sacrifices, in
terms of their financial contribu¬
tions and also in terms oftheir will¬
ingness to release a part of their
water allocations for improving the
environment of the deltas and the
Aral Sea disaster zone".
Will the appeal to save the chil¬
dren of the Aral region which a
group ofwomen scientists made in
October 1990 to the Presidents of
the Republics and the heads oforga¬
nizations of the United Nations
system be heard before it is too late?
