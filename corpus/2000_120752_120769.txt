By the time Itamar Franco was elected president of Brazil in 1992,the
country’s film industry had virtually disappeared.A year later, a new
broadcasting and cinema law lent fil m m a kers a lifeline: firms that decided
to invest in film production were given tax rebates of up to three per cent,
and investments could be recouped at the box office.
The Brazilian film industry at once leapt to life. Only two commercial films
were made in Brazil in 1992.In 1999,there were 33.Subjects have also
become more varied,and locations diversified.New talent has sprung up
not just in Rio de Janeiro, but also São Paolo, the northeast and the south
of the country.
A number of new films, such as Tata Amaral’s A Starry Sky, Beto Brant’s
B e l l y U p, Bruno Barreto’s Four Days in September, Sergio Rezende’s
Lamarca and Carla Camurati’s Carlota Joaquina,have addressed violence
and the country’s military dictatorships,while the sertão,or semi-arid nor-
theast of Brazil—which won renown in the classic Brazilian cinema of the
1960s through movies such as Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ Barren Lives
and Glauber Rocha’s Black God, White Devil—has been revived as a back-
drop.
“You can see in these new films the link between the new wave and tele-
vision melodrama, which grew in the 1970s and 1980s during a huge
surge in production,”says critic José Carlos A v e l l a r.Walter Salles’ film C e n -
tral Station, which won the Golden Bear prize at the 1998 Berlin Film Fes-
t i va l , illustrates precisely this connection through the story of a boy looking
for his father in the sertão with the help of a female teacher.
But economic crisis threatens this surge of creativity.“My new film didn’t get
a cent under the 1993 law,”says Salles, currently shooting in the sertão a Bra-
zilian version of Albanian writer Ismail Kadare’s novel Broken April.
“The 1993 law has shown itself to be shaky and inadequate,” says Paulo
C a l d a s, who has just made a documentary about city life, The Little Prince’s
Rap against the Wicked Souls. Over its first five years, $184 million went on
film production via the law and only $12.5 million on distribution and
marketing—a tiny sum in a market dominated by American films. ■
