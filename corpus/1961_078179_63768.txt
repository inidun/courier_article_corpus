FACE OF THE EDUCATOR
Education has great priority in all of
Africa's many newly Independent countries.
Educators, like this headmaster of a com¬
munity training centre (photo above), are
the men of vision and purpose who work
to establish and maintain the schools
which will train tomorrow's leaders.
FACE OF THE SCIENTIST
The great importance given to science in
the modern world has not been overlooked
by Africa's newly Independent countries.
Young scientists (photo above right), many
of them trained In their own universities
and technical schools, are taking their
places in government and private labora¬
tories in all parts of the continent.
FACE OF THE DOCTOR
Modern and well-equipped hospitals are
now staffed and run by Africans themselves.
Such up-to-date operating rooms as this
one (right) in the University College of
Ibadan, Nigeria, form a nucleus from which
young doctors and nurses now in training
will go out to take their full part In
raising the health standards of their people.

THE CHANGING
FACE
OF AFRICA
Most boundaries have remained the same, but
independence has brought new recognition to
African states. The map published on the two
following pages will assist you in pinpoint¬
ing the continent's twenty-two new countries.
How well do we know our African geogra¬
phy? Everyone could identify a map of
the world's second largest continent,
and with a little help from school days,
point out within a layman's distance such places
as Cairo, Dakar or Addis Ababa. Most of us would
have a vague knowledge of the continent's topo¬
graphy with the vast desert to the north, the
rolling grasslands of the far south and the dense
tropical forests which lie between.
But when it comes to political boundaries, our
knowledge fails. Only a few years ago, the school¬
boy, glancing at his map of Africa, would know
that the red areas designated a territory belonging
to this country, the yellow, to another and the blue
to still another.
Suddenly all that has changed. In the past five
years 22 new countries have achieved independence
in Africa. It is not that they have been moved
around or simply sprung up from nowhere, but
that up to now, we have been in the habit of think¬
ing of them as part of this territory, or that terri¬
tory, and not as separate political entities with
their own lawmakers, heads of states, courts of

THE CHANGING
FACE OF AFRICA
(Cont'd from page 17)
law, and, to be sure, their own representatives taking their
places in the world councils.
Political independence has changed the names of two
or three of these new countries, but the countries them¬
selves, their inhabitants, towns and villages did not
radically change overnight. Neither are their frontiers
entirely new. You'll find most of them in an old atlas.
Gabon, Congo, Nigeria, Senegal, Guinea, Togo and Came¬
roun are certainly not newcomers. There are a few
unfamiliar names such as Central African Republic
(which means exactly what it says), Mali and Ghana,
both romantic sounding names recalling great African
kingdoms of the past (1).
If we look at the continent as a whole, we are struck
by the pattern of its various boundaries. They are not
without significance and many of them have a story
to tell. Some boundaries have, of course, evolved naturally.
The island of Madagascar is an obvious example, and the
Republic of Somalia with its homogeneous population is
another.
But many of the boundaries appear to have been
worked out arbitrarily with T-square and ruler as if some
statesman or military leader had tried to avoid complic¬
ations. The sharp geometrical boundaries of Kenya, Chad
and the Sudan are examples.
It may be some time yet before we know what shape
the boundaries of east Africa between the Zambezi and
Congo rivers will take in the atlases of the future, but,
on the west coast the less regular jigsaw shape of
boundaries testifies to a chequered history. The legacy
of ancient alliances, kingdoms, and the influence of
successive dominant peoples have all left their mark.
The results of this penetration into the interior have
left their traces on boundary lines all along the coast.
From the Congo to Guinea, we find a dozen countries
lying side by side, each with its strip of coast, extending
inland to the humid forest, on to the shrub-covered
.grasslands and sometimes as far as the savannahs.
None of these countries on the Atlantic seaboard
stretches as far inland as the desert. There, the arid
Sudan region extends in a broad band from the Senegal
River all the way to the Nile. Shepherds and their flocks
have always moved freely through this part of Africa
as have the traders' caravans and many civilizations of
the past. This is also true of Mauritania which lies
between Senegal and the Atlas mountains.
There are virtually no impassable natural barriers on
the African continent. With the exception of those
majestic eastern ranges which extend from the Abyssian
highlands down to the snowclad peaks of Kilmanjaro,
and those in the Sahara region, there are no mountains
which compare with Europe's Alps or North America's
Rockies. Africa's mountains traditionally are neither
impassable barriers nor savage regions held in dread by
a peaceful population. On the contrary, the mountains
of Kenya and Guinea provide good pasture lands, and
those of the Cameroun are covered with lush coffee
and banana plantations. If there are some highland
areas which are sparsely populated it is not because of
geography but the plague of the tsetse-fly.
Even the deserts of Africa have not always been
regarded as natural barriers. They have been used for
centuries as highways of commerce and communication.
Nor have the great virgin forests of tropical central
Africa completely cut off the north from the south.
Dense though they may be in certain regions, they
cannot be compared with the impenetrable Amazon
jungle with which they are sometimes confused.
While the African continent has few natural barriers
which prohibit the movement of its population, it does
lack good, navigable waterways. Rivers are comparatively
few for such a large land mass. Whereas the Nile River
played a distinct role in the development of a civilization,
not only along its banks but for half the ancient world,
as did the Euphrates River in Asia Minor, one cannot
say that the Zambezi, Congo or Niger Rivers were essen¬
tial factors in the rise of the civilizations of central Africa.
The old empires of Ghana, Mali and Gao which lay
astride the Senegal and Niger River valleys brought their
Sahel culture from the savannah. The most stable king¬
doms of that era revolved around agricultural and
religious centres, seldom following the course of water¬
ways. One might even conjecture that this lack of
natural water highways long hindered the building of
great states in Africa.
Road and rail networks will be among the most im¬
portant developments in Africa's future. It is fifty
years since the first man-made highways and rail lines
began to criss-cross the continent and they are continually
being expanded.
As for maritime transportation, tropical Africa owes
its great ports to external factors. Dakar, Abidjan, Lagos,
Leopoldville and Nairobi were developed to a great
extent by the world's great merchant navies, industries
and more recently aviation. On the other hand, the-
great towns of the tropical region which are purely
African in origin grew up from regional market places,
often the site of huge fairs. They remain essentially
centres of agriculture and artisan trades. Ibadan is a
striking example.
I N addition to the geographic and political features of
Africa, we must not overlook the continent's vast eco¬
nomic resources and its complex pattern of peoples, tribes
and languages. In the field of resources we are on more
familiar ground.
Everyone knows about the gold mines of South Africa
and the considerable amounts of this precious metal
found in all regions north of the equator. Congo's copper
and uranium deposits are world famed. Diamonds bring
to mind Angola and Tanganyika ; iron-ore, Liberia, Mau¬
ritania and Guinea. Both Guinea and the Cameroun also
have large deposits of bauxite, the raw material from
which aluminium is made.
There are the phosphates of Senegal, the palm and
peanut oils, and that appetizing favourite, cocoa, a source
of prosperity for African planters in Ghana and the
Ivory Coast. Add to these, coffee pride of Ethiopia and
the famed cattle herds of the Masai and Peuhls in
east and west Africa.
Most of us know about these African resources, but
this knowledge can also be a bit embarrassing. It concerns
a phantom Africa which we identify with the produce
of its soil and the wealth of its mines. We never think
of the people of Europe, Asia or the Americas exclusively
in terms of their crops, mines and factories.
Each country has a special personality of its own,
shaped by its history, its role in world affairs and its
contribution to mankind. It is only now that we are
beginning to think of African nations in this same way.
Here is the very heart of the change which an inde¬
pendent Africa is having and will continue to have on
the face of that continent. Until now we have tried to
study, explore and explain Africa from the outside.
Henceforth, we must see her with new eyes and listen
to her new voice. Africa will write her own history, will
produce her own philosophy, will interpret her religions
and will unravel the tangled skeins of her many
languages. As a part of the international community of
nations, she will make her contribution to the fields of
science, economics, politics and art. She is ceasing for
all time to be an object of curiosity, of pity, of greed, of
special interest. She will, herself, make known the great
vital forces and human qualities which will bring a
change and a new significance to the map of Africa.
