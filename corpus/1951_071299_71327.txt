NEW ZEALANDERS are borrowingover three million more books a
year than they were in 1938. Yet
the number of public libraries has
hardly changed since that time, and
the total stock of books has not
increased to any large extent, accord-
ing to a census taken this year.
Public library membership, however
has almost tripled in twelve years,
rising from 93, 863 to 250, 125. This, in
a country with a population of two
million living in widely scattered areas,
shows a striking development in the
use of libraries. It is mainly due to
the work of a branch of the New Zea-
land library system known as the
Country Library Service. It was
founded in 1938 to improve and
broaden library facilities in country
districts by providing a national stock
of books which could be loaned to local
libraries.
In the country districts of New Zea-
land, where the people live on isolated
farms, the highlight of the week is
usually a trip to the nearest small town,
in a car large enough for the whole
family. The trip nearly always inclu-
des a visit to the library. For during
the long winter evenings from July to
November, the New Zealand farmer
and his family like to gather round
the open fire after their evening meal,
and read or listen to the radio before
going to bed.
SMALL TOWN SERVICE
ONE of the first aims of the newService was to create a group of
free lending libraries in these
small towns. It offered to give town
and borough libraries serving popul-
ations of less than 2, 500 fifteen books
for every 100 of population, on con-
dition that free library systems were
started. The service has since been
extended to cover all town and borough
libraries regardless of size of popul-
ation.
As a result of the Country Library
Service supply of books, nearly 90 town
and borough libraries now provide free
services. The books are changed at
least three times a year, and the Ser-
vice's large grey vans, accompanied by
skilled librarians, are a familiar sight
in the smallest towns and villages.
These public libraries in turn send
books to local hospitals and instit-
utions.
Apart from encouraging free libra-
ries, the Country Library Service also
lends about 60, 000 books each year to
small independent subscription libra-
ries which cannot afford to run a free-
lending system. Nearly 700 of these
libraries receive loans of books for
which they pay a small annual charge.
ANTIDOTE
TO ISOLATION
IN isolated places, such as valleys upin the mountain , w ere there are
only a few solitary farms, travelling
hampers of books are sent to groups of
readers for a small yearly subscription.
The books are passed around among
the inhabitants of the farms, and
returned periodically for exchange.
Lonely lighthouse keepers, coast guards
and others who are cut off completely
from any library service are supplied
free with books.
In the last few years, the Country
Library Service has been establishing
free libraries in the new towns and
settlements growing up round national
development projects, such as big hy-
dro-electric installations. In addition
to providing reading material for many
workers leaving the towns to live in
these settlements, a special request
service permits engineers and spe-
cialists on tne job to keep in touch
with latest developments in their
field,
Readers using any of these various
facilities can request special books
which will be supplied to them on
short-term loans either from head-
quarters stock or from other libraries.
The service also arranges for smaller
libraries to borrow whole collections or
books on particular subjects, such as
anthropology, industrial management,
etc., which gives their readers a chance
to see books which normally only
large-well-stocked libraries would keep.
In the country dis-
tricts of New Zea-
land and in ma-
ny other countries
where people live
on isolated farms,
the highlight of the
week is usually a
trip to the nearest
small town-and a
visit to the library.
Sometimes the li-
brary is housed,
like that shown
at right, in the local
grocery store.
Travelling libraries
-"bibliobuses"-
have done much to
solve the problem
of providing a re-
gular supply of
books for people
living in rural dis-
tricts or outlying
city areas. Here,
children choose
their books inside
a library on wheels.
