PAUL VALÉRY
Pupil of Degas
When in 1956 the Bibliothèque
Nationale in Paris held an
exhibition devoted to the works
of Paul Valéry, just 11 years after his
death, it gave a large section to the
many paintings, water colours, drawings,
and etchings which the great philoso¬
phical poet and French Academician
had produced during his lifetime. In
addition, two wax statuettes were shown,
one he had done of Mallarmé, the
other of Degas. Nine drawing books
were exhibited, the first done when he
was 17, the last when he was 71.
Valéry, in the "interior island" he had
created for himself had a veritable
passion for both art and architecture.
He was a pupil of Degas, copied the
Old Masters at the Louvre, and
deepened his knowledge of Italian art.
In the pages of his literary notebooks
and diaries one finds numerous drawings
full of fantasy which usually had
nothing to do with the subjects he was
writing about. Valéry did however
illustrate a number of his works himself,
amongst them The Graveyard by the
Sea (he was enchanted by what he
called "the sea eternally renewed" and
"the only intact and most ancient thing
in the world"). Valéry also did a series
of illustrations for his famous book
Monsieur Teste. Two of these, a water
colour and a wash drawing are repro¬
duced below and above. Left, a water
colour by Valéry of his study in the Rue
Gay-Lussac, in the Latin Quarter, Paris.
Wash-drawing (below) is owned by
Mme Paul Valéry, water-colour (above)
by Richard Anacréon, the author's
studio by Julien Cain.
