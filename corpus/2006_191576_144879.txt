When Water 
becomeS a Political challenge
         in an overwhelming majority vote, water was enshrined in uruguay’s constitution 
                    as public property - a world first. as a result, the state must now decide 
                what will happen to private concessions that managed the supply network 
                            before the vote, and also undertake the task of monitoring water quality.
In terms of water resources, Uru-
guay is somewhat blessed. Ac-
cording to the Second United Na-
tions World Water Development 
Report, published in March 2006, 
the country is ranked 26th for the 
quantity of water available per in-
habitant. 
224 billion cubic metres of rain 
water falls each year in the coun-
try. However, a third of this volume 
evaporates or is lost, almost 183

billion litres of water per day. 
In this South American country 
of three million inhabitants, this re-
source is used unsparingly. 6,000 
litres of water costs a family only 
six dollars per month. However, 
only 43% of drinking water pro-
duced by the company is billed, as 
shown in a report commissioned by 
the state-owned water utility OSE 
(Obras Sanitarias del Estado). Also, 
it is not rare for a damaged pipe to 
leak for days before the authorities 
deal with it. 
Yet it is now constitutionally en-
shrined that water belongs to the 
community. The result is that only 
state-owned companies can supply 
drinking water and sewage services. 
The Uruguayan voters decided 
this by an overwhelming majority 
(64.58% of the votes) in a referen-
dum in October 2004. Since then, 
a delicate process of negotiation 

has been underway to transfer the 
private concessions to the public 
domain.
Furthermore, the constitutional 
reform established that drinking 
water and the sewage system ‘are 
fundamental human rights’. Work-
ing on the assumption that water 
is property ‘in the public domain’, 
according to the amendment that 
was passed, Uruguay must now 
implement a national policy based 
on ‘sustainable supportive man-
agement’ of this resource.
User involvement
Another important new concept: 
this policy now requires the partici-
pation of users at ‘all levels of plan-
ning, management and monitoring’. 
‘Water cannot to be considered 
as private property, it belongs to 
all, to the community ‘, maintained 
lawyer Guillermo García Duchini, 
who took part in the drafting of the 
constitutional amendment, pro-
moted by the National Commis-
sion in Defence of Water and Life, 
a coalition including close to forty 
associations. 
‘It is inconceivable that this vi-
tal resource should be subject to 
speculation and profit. ‘In this re-
spect’, he continued, ‘we have had 
rather negative experiences in this 
country, both in terms of cost to 
users and of protection of the en-
vironment’. 
The lawyer recalled that the initia-
tive for the reform was born out of 
a meeting of inhabitants in the De-
partment of Canelones, in South-
ern Uruguay. At that time it was 
a response to worries among the 
local population that drinking wa-
ter and sewage services would be 
privatized in the future. 
The 2004 referendum, a world 
first, permanently ruled out this 
possibility. ‘In Uruguay, the consti-
tution can only be modified by refer-
endum’, explained García Duchini, 
hence the decision to resolve this 
issue by a vote.
Quality monitoring
The choice of the Uruguayans is 
surprising, to say the least, in a 
country that is liberally supplied 
with water, not only by rainfall but 
also by rivers and lakes. 
Waterways such as the Uruguay 
River and the Río de the Plata flow 
towards most of the costal regions, 
and almost half the territory of this 
country of 187,000 km² is situated 
above usable aquifer sources (the 
largest, the Guarani aquifer, is one 
of the biggest subterranean fresh-
water reservoirs in the world, oc-
cupying 58,000 km² of Uruguayan 
territory and extending into Argen-
tina, Brazil and Paraguay). 
Mario García, Professor of the De-
partment of Soil and Water at the 
University of Uruguay considers 
that water demand is currently low 
due to the enormous resources in 
the country. 
Nevertheless, ‘when a resource 
is abundant, little importance is at-
tached to it, and instead of opting 
for integrated management of the 
hydrographic basin, an individual 
strategy is applied’, he affirms. 
Those in favour of the new legal 
framework wish to avoid this pitfall 
by creating specially designated 
organizations to administer the ba-
sins, comprised of the authorities, 
technicians and users. 
However, according to Professor 
García, the main ‘risk of vulnerabil-
ity’ that Uruguay faces today is the 
deterioration of water quality due 
to the use of agricultural chemical 
products. Preserving the quality 
and not only the quantity of water 
is now a public concern in Uruguay.

The Río de La Plata is an enormous reserve of freshwater.

“Complete privatization 
of water services 
in developing countries, 
however, has not been able 
to meet expectations for 
improved and extended water 
supply and sanitation 
services. There is, thus, 
a need for improving dialogue 
on water between govern-
ments, civil society 
and the private sector…”
