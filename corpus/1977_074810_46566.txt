TELEVISIONS
ONE-WAY TRAFFIC
by Hifzi Topuz
THERE are about 1,000 million
televiewers in the world today.
The distribution-pattern of the
programmes which supply this vast
market reveals that the less-devel¬
oped countries are major importers
of TV programme material, obtained
from a number of rich countries.
The concept of the free circulation
of television material applies in reality

vision service at Ankara.
only to the wealthy countries which
are in a position to produce TV pro¬
grammes. The poor countries are
dependent on the rich countries for
much of their television programming.
Cost is a fundamental factor in de¬
termining the world-wide flow of tele¬
vision material. It is often cheaper
for a country to fill its air time by
buying elsewhere. For example, a
programme which may have cost
$ 100,000 to make might be bought
by a small country for as little as
$ 500, since the price is based on
the number of sets in the purchasing
country and not on production costs.

dorn, France, the Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many) towards the less developed
countries. The U.S.S.R. also exports
a substantial proportion of its pro¬
grammes, but this flow is more limited
and is directed for the most part
towards the other socialist countries.
The U.S.A. alone sells between
100,000 and 200,000 programme-
hours per year to television networks
in other countries. The second
biggest programme exporter is the
U.K., which annually markets be¬
tween 20,000 and 30,000 programme-
hours, followed by France (15,000
to 20,000 hours) and the Fed. Rep.
of Germany (5,000 to 6,000 hours).
Most countries import some tele¬
vision programmes, but the proportion
of imported material in their total
broadcast output varies widely, from
1 per cent to (in some cases) 100
per cent.
Among the countries which rely
to a very small extent on imported
material are China, Japan, the
U.S.S.R., France, the U.K. and
Italy.
Countries which are heavily de¬
pendent on foreign imports for their
television programming include: Saudi
Arabia (Aramco TV, 100 per cent;
Riyadh TV, 31 per cent); Guatemala
(84 per cent); Singapore (78 per
cent); New Zealand (75 per cent);
Malaysia (71 per cent); Iceland (67
per cent); Zambia (64 per cent);
Nigeria (63 per cent); Uruguay (62
per cent); Australia and Yemen (57
per cent); Kuwait, Chile and Israel
(55 per. cent); Ireland (54 per cent);
Iraq (52 per cent) ; Dominican Republic
(50 per cent); Canada RC (46 per
cent); Bulgaria (45 per cent); Egypt
(41 per cent); Hungary and Finland
(40 per cent); Mexico (Telesistema)
and Norway (39 per cent); Pakistan
and Portugal (35 per cent); Colombia
(34 per cent). .
One cause of the unbalanced flow,
as we have seen, is the wealth of
the exporting countries, which gives
them a powerful advantage as pro¬
ducers of television material.
The richer a country is, the more
self-sufficient it will be in terms of
television programmes. The poorer
it is, the more it will depend on
programmes from other countries.
Secondly, many of the developing
countries initially had neither a film
industry nor technicians capable of
building up a television network.
Consequently, they had to depend
on the major industrialized countries
for their equipment and know-how.
Their dependence is not limited to
the initial stages, but persists when
they introduce colour television.
There is no simple rule, however.
Such well-to-do countries as Austra¬
lia and New Zealand rely heavily on
foreign imports to fill their air time
(57 and 75 per cent, respectively).
By no means everyone is satisfied
with this lop-sided relationship be¬
tween the producers and the pur¬
chasers of television programmes.
Some see it as a threat to cultural
traditions. Others complain that
the exchange of programmes is gov¬
erned by commercial considerations,
that programmes are conceived as
products and are addressed to "cus¬
tomers" rather than "viewers".
It is also stressed that most of the
programmes which are exported and
which dominate the international
market were intended to entertain
viewers in their countries of origin
and that their contents do not corres¬
pond to the needs of the societies
which import them.
There are some encouraging signs,
however. The increasing activity of
regional broadcasting unions may
promote a more balanced flow. At
the same time there is a growing
tendency to exchange television news
within and between regions, together
with a greater willingness on the part
of- countries with different political
and social systems to engage in co-
production ventures.

programmes and news is thus an un¬
balanced one. Research has shown
that "television traffic" moves along
a one-way street.
In 1973 Unesco published a survey
and analysis by two Finnish university
teachers of the international flow of
TV programme material (1).
This study shows that one of the
main streams runs from the major
industrialized countries of the West
