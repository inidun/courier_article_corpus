Jobless young ethnics in several cities 
of the southwest US are finding a purpose in life
when they get together and paint murals

In the Arizona city of Tucson,100 km
from the Mexican border,1995 was a
record year for crime. Ninety-four of
its 667,000 inhabitants (29 per cent of
whom are Hispanic, 3.8 per cent blacks and
3.5 per cent Indian) were murdered.Most
of the victims were members of these mino-
rities.
One of them was Pete Va l e n z u e l a , a n
u n a g gr e s s i ve 15-year-old who didn’t belong
to a gang. He was gunned down in broad
d aylight while walking in the no-man’s - l a n d
b e t ween two ri val “ t e rri t o ri e s ” ,B a rrio A n i t a
and Barrio Sova c o. After his funeral,
h atreds intensified and Pe t e ’s friends swo r e
to avenge his death.
A Chicano mural painter named Julio
B e rn a l , and Martín Hern á n d e z , a commu-
nity organizer, realized it was urgent to
channel these dangerous emotions. T h e y
suggested painting a mural to commemo-
r ate the dead teenager and called it Por  V i d a
(In Favour of Life).The project attracted
about 40 young people aged between nine
and 17, who worked on it together for nine
months.To raise money to buy materials,
they washed car windows in the evenings
and at weekends.
“ Pete was like a brother,” s ays Gino
Molina.“I nearly went crazy after he died.
But mulling over our culture together,dis-
cussing what people feel about the family or
religion and trying to express all that on a
wall helped me a lot. I didn’t know any-
thing about art, but I just got on with it.If
I hadn’t, I would have gone on drinking. I
used to live in fear and I carried a gun.”
Today, 19-year-old Gino is f ather of a
baby and has just finished another mural
in memory of Pete which he painted by
himself on the wall of the local supermar-
k e t . There are now more than 130 such
murals in and around Tucson.

M e x i c o, Chicanos (Mexican immigr a n t s
and/or their descendants) are sizeable
m i n o rities which are still gr owing as a result
of immigration.It is hard for them to get a
foothold in American society and many of
them live in b a rri o s (Spanish for neighbou-
rhoods),either in the centre of big cities or
on their outskirts, away from areas where
there are jobs.These communities tend to
be self-contained and generate self-des-
tructive tensions and conflicts.Young Chi-
canos face many problems—dropping out
of school, violent gang rivalry, alcoholism,
d rug dealing and illegal gun possession—all
of which can lead to serious gang warfare
stirred up by agents of organized crime.
Defusing tensions
Walls in the b a rri o s are often daubed
with slogans and vicious gr a f fiti refle c t i n g
this violent wo r l d . But more and more
m a g n i ficent frescoes are appearing in this
urban landscape, reflecting a ve ry old
Mexican tradition of murals depicting
scenes from the past or aspects of modern
l i f e .After Mexico’s 1910 revo l u t i o n ,p a i n-
t e rs such as Diego Rive r a , José Clemente
Orozco and David A l faro Siqueiros
r e n e wed this form of expression and used
it to record the gr e at social struggles of
their time. In the 1970s, other artists took
over where they left off. In the United
S t at e s , a rt i s t s , s c u l p t o rs , p a i n t e rs and art

and raised hell at night, just for the fun of it. We all did.

For some young descendants of the Yaqui Indians chased out of Mexico at the turn of the century,
painting is a way of rediscovering their roots and expressing their identity.
place in A m e rican society through art and
highlighting their shared roots.
Pedro Flores, who is descended from the
Yaqui Indians who were chased out of
Mexico at the beginning of the century,got a
bad start in life. “I hung out on the streets
with a gang of friends for ye a rs ,”he say s.“ We
s p r ayed gr a f fiti on wa l l s , smashed window s
and raised hell at night, just for the fun of it.
We all did. In the end, I got into trouble with
the police because there are drugs eve ry w-
here here.” He did his first paintings duri n g
community events organized by two mural
a rt i s t s , Miguel Flores, also of Yaqui stock,
and A n t onio Pa z o s , a Mexican who has been
living in Tucson for more than 20 ye a rs.
“Their paintings, inspired by our culture,
reminded me who I was and where I came
f r o m .They helped me get a grip on my s e l f.
N ow I couldn’t imagine life without pain-
t i n g .”Pedro resumed his studies and fin i s h e d
high school. At 18, he is a counsellor in the
r e c r e ation department of the Yaqui tri b e ’s
Pascua Reservation (more than 5,000 Ya q u i s
l i ve in the Tucson area).He is organizing seve-
ral painting and mosaic projects for yo u n g
p e o p l e . On walls and movable panels, t h e y
h ave together depicted major aspects of their
c u l t u r e , such as the traditional “dance of the
d e e r ” ,which takes place at night and goes on
until sunri s e . Pedro in turn tries to help tee-
n a g e rs break the vicious circle of violence and
m a r gi n a l i z ation they are trapped in.
“Most families in our neighbourhood are
alcoholic,” says John Escalante, another
Ya q u i . “The fat h e rs and mothers drink and
the cousins and uncles sell dru g s.We aren’t
taught about our culture in school. I t ’s denied
and bu ried by white society. If I hadn’t done
the murals with the other Ya q u i s , I wo u l d
n e ver have made it, because my fat h e r ,d r ow-
ned in his booze, c o u l d n ’t care less.”
In 1996,Pa z o s ,who is assistant director of
Tu c s o n ’s El Rio Neighborhood Centre,d e c i-
ded to take up a major challenge: m a k i n g
peace between two wa rring groups of jobless
C h i c a n o s , one Hispanic, the other Ya q u i .H e
also wanted to gi ve them a taste for wo r k .H e
decided on repainting the dirty gr a f fit i - c ove-
red wall of a power station which marked the
frontier between a Yaqui neighbourhood (Bar-
rio Libre) and a Hispanic neighbourhood
(South Tu c s o n ) .The electricity company gave
its permission and even funded the project.
One day, Pazos began painting on the
wall.A boy soon appeared and asked what
he was doing. “This is our wall,” he said.
Pazos replied sharp l y :“Then it’s about time
you all got down here. I t ’s your wall and
there’s a lot of work to do.”Young people
poured in from the two neighbourhoods,
and Pa z o s , p l aying up his Mexican roots
and Yaqui blood, organized them into a
team to paint pictures of their culture and
its highlights.Things got dangerously tense
at one point, t h o u g h , because the yo u n g
Hispanic Chicanos did not want the cultu-
ral roots of the Yaqui Chicanos depicted on
the part of the wall nearest the Hispanic
Chicano neighbourhood.
With the help of neighbours , Pazos tra-
ced the history of the pre-Columbian civi-
l i z at i o n s.“I wanted to show them that we ’r e
all of mixed blood, t h at half of all Mexicans
have both Spanish and Indian blood.They
realized they were mixed too and that this
should be shown in the mural.So the first
b rightly-coloured communal wall painting
was born and the ri val gangs learned to get
to know and talk to one another instead of
killing each other.
Leaving gangs behind
The U.S.-Mexican border city of El Pa s o
and its 606,000 mostly Hispanic citizens have
one of the highest jobless rates of any U. S .
city—nearly 12 per cent compared with the
n ational average of 5.4 per cent. One we l l -

forces to ferret out new talent, gi ve yo u n g
people from poor families a sense of self-
esteem and train them in a skill to help them
find a job.
“I wanted to involve my students in
group-produced wall paintings to help them
d i s c over the history of the region and their
own history,” says Almeida. That chance
came last year with the 400th annive rs a ry of
the arrival in El Paso of its first Spanish
c o n q u i s t a d o r , Juan de Oñat e .Doing a mural
around this theme in the high school gr o u n d s
“changed the live s ” of several pupils.
“It opened up my mind and helped me
get beyond my problems and leave behind
the gangs in my neighbourhood,” s ays Misael
A rm e n d á ri z . “I feel prouder of my Mexican

This mural was painted by a group of Tucson teenagers in memory of a 15-year-old
who died a violent death.
roots and I express that in what I paint.”
Misael has already won several small pain-
ting commissions from the city authori t i e s
and will soon go to unive rsity to study art .
As a result of what he has learned while
organizing the painting, H e rnández has
rethought the stereotypes he has in his ow n
head and those of his community. “ We
decided to include in the mural people who
suffered at the hands of Oñat e — I n d i a n s
with hands and feet chopped off. History
sometimes gives its heroes shiny but false
images. A mural painter has a very big res-
p o n s i b i l i t y : o r d i n a ry folk don’t go to
museums but they do walk past outdoor
murals. So we have to paint the truth.”
M a ny other experiments are under way
in El Pa s o, where more than 150 wall pain-
tings now brighten up the city. Jesús Alva-
r a d o, a social worker in El Segundo, t h e
c i t y ’s poorest neighbourhood, runs city-
sponsored graphic art wo r k s h o p s.The most
recent murals show the struggle of the
Indians in Mexico’s Chiapas state.
These people,along with many others,
e x p e rience a kind of collective therapy
through the murals—intensive work which
a l l ows children and teenagers to find fulfil-
ment within their own culture as dignified
and respected human beings. n
