Luis Macas is one of the most prominent leaders
and thinkers in Ecuador’s indigenous people’s
m ove m e n t .I nva riably dressed in the distinctive l y
dark poncho and sombrero from his village of Sara-
g u r o, in the country ’s we s t e rn highlands, he manages
the Internet edition of a newsletter published by the
Institute for the Knowledge of Indigenous Culture.
Macas heads this Quito-based body, h aving serve d
stints as president of the Confederation of Ecuador’s
Indigenous Nationalities (CO N A I E) and as a nat i o n a l
deputy for the Pachakutik move m e n t .
The CO N A I E and its political wing Pa c h a k u t i k ,
which today has six deputies in the 123-seat unicameral
E c u a d o rian parliament, was one of the main gr o u p s
i nvo l ved in a popular uprising in Ja n u a ry 2000 that
shocked the world by seizing control of the gove rn m e n t
and parliament in Quito. Allied with a group of yo u n g
m i l i t a ry offic e rs rebelling against corru p t i o n , the indi-
genous groups forced the then President Jamil Mahuad
to resign and flee the country, though the insurgents
failed to secure one of their main objective s :s t o p p i n g
a bid to dollarize the economy, which wiped out the
n ational curr e n cy, the sucre, with the stroke of a pen.
Niches of local power
For Luis Macas, a restored sense of identity is not
only important for indigenous people, who make up a
third of the country ’s 12 million people, but for Ecua-
d o rian society as a whole. Once indigenous people
complete their period of “ s e l f - d e fin i t i o n ” t h r o u g h
s t ruggles for land and preservation of their ancestral cul-
t u r e , Macas argues, “ethnic differences can be super-
s e d e d ”and political plans drafted for the whole society.
Macas places gr e at hope in the niches of local
p ower won by Ecuador’s indigenous movement in
M ay 2000, when they romped to victory in 27 tow n
halls and five provincial districts out of 22—a totally
unparalleled event in recent Latin A m e rican history.
According to Macas, success at the ballot box needs
to be conve rted into better training for local indigenous
l e a d e rs and gr e ater democratic part i c i p ation by com-
m u n i t i e s :“there are two bases, the technical and the poli-
t i c a l , and we have to strengthen both,” he declares.

and political roles with ineffable skill is Mariano Curi-
c a m a .M ayor of the Guamote district in the province of
C h i m b o r a z o, which houses over 133 indigenous com-
m u n i t i e s ,C u ricama combines a long career as leader of
his people’s campaigns with an extraordinary manage-
rial dynamism.“ You’ll never find me inside my offic e ,”
he explains,“I’m always on the road.” Re-elected twice
since 1992, this Quechua from the country ’s central
highlands who started work as a builder at the age of 17,
has revolutionized his distri c t , promoting public part i-
c i p ation in local assemblies, and combining the m i n ga—
the Quechua people’s traditional community wo r k — w i t h
assistance from leading foreign organizat i o n s.The results
are there for all to see: r o a d s ,
d rinking wat e r , i rri g at i o n
c h a n n e l s , r e f o r e s t ation and
replenishment of the local fis h
stock in places where previous
g ove rnments sowed only pove rty and pat r o n a g e .A few
months ago he created the Indigenous Chamber of
C o m m e r c e , which local people hope will adve rtise and
sell their products within the country and abroad.
M a riano Curi c a m a , who has travelled to 14 countri e s ,
is not afraid of globalizat i o n : “If we don’t jump on this
c a r , we’ll be left by the side of the road,” he declares.
Miguel Lluco, a former national deputy and
n ational co-ordinator of the Pachakutik move m e n t ,i s
also convinced that his people’s horizons will have to
w i d e n : “Ecuador can’t be an exception in this process
of globalizat i o n ,” he say s. The bloodless uprising in
Ja n u a ry, he acknow l e d g e s , was “the inevitable refle c-
tion of a global situation that has been imposed on us
through dollari z ation and the globalization of cur-
r e n cy exchanges, and which threatens to disrupt the
d e velopment of our own political agenda.
“ T h at ’s why it’s so vital to build up links with people
who are campaigning and proposing altern at i ves across
the wo r l d . If we had stayed put in Ecuador with the
local land conflicts of the 1960s, when eve ry village
fought with its own landlord as if it were engaged in a pri-
vate bat t l e , we would never have made all this progr e s s
in indigenous people’s organizat i o n . People in the Firs t
World can provide us with a lot, while we can promote
our values and community vision.”
Until the age of 13, when on one moonlit night he
left the rustic house where he lived with his illiterat e
peasant family and headed to
the sugar cane plantat i o n s
on the coast, Miguel Lluco
knew nothing outside his
small corner of the A n d e s.
On the basis of his experience as a labourer, s h o e s h i n e
b oy, ice-cream salesman, c a rp e n t e r , union leader,
p o l i t i c i a n , d e p u t y, and indefatigable defender of the
“ i n t e gral human being,” as he likes to put it, L l u c o
weighs up the risks and opportunities of a globalized
wo r l d :“I see it in the same way as the course of my life,
from my village of Sacaguan, to discove ring the neigh-
b o u ring town of Guamote and its school, then on to
the situation of Ecuador and Latin A m e rica as a
w h o l e , until I started to wonder ‘ W h at do they think
in the First Wo r l d ? ,’ ‘ H ow do we build a form of com-
m u n i c ation and perhaps co-operat i o n ? ’ ”
The future of the first Latin A m e rican country to
abandon its own curr e n cy hinges on the answe rs that
Ecuador and the North gi ve to these questions. ■

“If we don’t jump on this car,
we’ll be left by the side
of the ro a d .”
