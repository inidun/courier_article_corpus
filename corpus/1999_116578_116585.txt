If the World To u rism Organizat i o n ’s forecasts are
on target, i n t e rn ational tourist arri vals will climb
from the present 625 million a year to 1.6 billion
in 2020. By this dat e ,t r ave l l e rs will spend over US$2
t ri l l i o n , (against US$445 billion today ) , m a k i n g
t o u rism the wo r l d ’s leading industry. T h e s e
projections are based on annual gr owth rates of
4.3% for arri vals and 6.7% for spending, well above
the maximum expected expansion of 3% per ye a r
in world GDP. Already in 1997, t o u rism receipts
accounted for a little over 8% of the wo r l d ’s export s
in goods and almost 34% of global services export s.
Electronic technology is fa c i l i t ating this gr owth by
o f f e ring access to fare and hotel inform ation and online
r e s e rvation serv i c e s. Despite a modest annual gr ow t h
r ate (3.1%), Europe will remain, by fa r , the most
popular destination (it can expect 717 million
i n t e rn ational arri vals in 2020, double the 1998 fig u r e ) ,
though its market share will decline from 59 to 45%.
G r owth on the continent will be led by Central and
E a s t e rn European countri e s , where arri vals are
expected to increase by 4.8% per ye a r. At the same
t i m e , almost half of the wo r l d ’s tourists will be coming
from Europe.G i ven this dominance,it is not surp ri s i n g
to find that six European countries count among the
top ten tourism earn e rs and spenders.The United
S t ates holds first place in both cat e g o ri e s.

With a 7% per annum growth in international
arrivals, the East Asia/Pacific region will overtake
the Americas as the second most popular destina-
tion, holding a 27% market share in 2020 against
18% by the Americas. But the industry will also be
doing its utmost to court the Asian traveller, since
East Asia /Pacific is forecast to become the world’s
second most important generator of tourists, with
a 7% annual gr owth rat e , pushing the A m e ri c a s
into third position. China is expected to become
the fourth largest source of tourists on the world
market, while it is not even among the first twenty
today. Both arrivals to and departures from Africa
(and especially Southern Africa), the Middle East
and South Asia are expected to grow by above 5%
per year.
While France has held its place as the top
d e s t i n ation throughout the 1990s, it will be
dethroned in the next decades, with China
(excluding Hong Kong) expected to top the list by
2020 even though it is not even featured on it today.
Also making an entry into the top ten are the
Russian Fe d e r at i o n , Hong Kong and the Czech
Republic.
Despite this gr owth forecast, t o u rism is and will
remain the privilege of a few:W TO forecasts that
only 7% of the world population will travel abroad
by 2020—that’s double the 1996 figure (3.5%). n
