Education systems need reinventing. From the courses being taught 
to the schools they are taught in. Author and award winning journalist
Reva Klein is the Chair of the International Consortium on School
Disaffection, which aims at making education
more humane, and more relevant
What do you mean when you speak
of disaffected students?
 They’re the ones who slam the
door on their education. Not just the
kids who walk away from school, but
also the those who drop out in their
minds. The young people who feel
alienated from the school
environment or the curriculum for
example and who switch off, who’re
not engaged with the syllabus, not
engaged socially. In the education
system, they take one of four routes.
Either they are pushed out – excluded
– or they truant persistently, fail their
exams or drop out before taking
them. Whatever direction they go in ,
they face a precarious future, dogged
by stigma, no qualifications and low
self-esteem.
You’ve looked mainly at the situation
in the United Kingdom, the USA 
How serious is the problem in those
countries?
 In the UK, according to official
figures, nearly 20 percent of 14 to 19
year-olds are out-of-school without
any qualifications. They’re not in any
sort of vocational training, and
they’re not working. They’re referred
to as a being at “status zero”.
Unofficially, their numbers are
probably much higher. 
At the same time, and even though
the government has committed itself to
social inclusion, the number of pupils
being shown the door has risen
inexorably over the past decade. In
1990/91, 2,910 children were excluded
from English schools; by 1996/97 the
number had skyrocketed to 12,700, and
1,600 of them were primary students. 
In the United States, an average 25
percent of 13 year olds fail to graduate
from high school. But this figure hides
big differences between states and
cities. In New York City and
Washington D.C’s public schools, the
figure is a staggering 45 percent. This

means that one child out of every four
in the United States leaves school
without that most basic of American
necessities, a high school diploma.
Who are the young people 
dropping out?
 There are no simple profiles, but
there are a number of factors that
keep cropping up. 
The home and social environment
and family circumstances are
obviously critical. The US
Educational Testing Service, for

example, reports that around half of
all families on welfare are headed by
early school leavers.
Race and ethnicity can also be major
hurdles. In the U.K. disproportionate
numbers of African Caribbean children
are doing badly – although they don’t
necessarily drop-out of their education.
Gypsy and Traveller children are
particularly at risk of failing and
dropping out, even though they, like
African Caribbeans, start their
schooling on a positive note. 
In the US, although the situation
for black children is still far from
acceptable, it has dramatically
improved over the last three decades.
The latest figures show that about 13
percent of young black students drop
out, as against 40 percent in the
1970s. On the other hand, the drop-
out rate for young Latinos in the mid
1990s was around 30 percent making
them the worst hit ethnic group for
dropout figures.
Gender is another indicator for
school disaffection and
underachievement. In the United
States, “special education” classes for
underachieving and disruptive
students ar-85 percent male.
Young people living in foster
situations or in the care of a local
authority are one of the highest risk
groups. In the UK over a quarter of
14 to 16 year olds in care are either
persistent truants or have been
excluded from school, and between
half and three quarters of those
leaving a foster or care situation have
no educational qualifications.
That’s not really surprising though.
Kids in underprivileged situations
have always faced these sorts of
difficulties. What’s new?
First, although they probably
make up the bulk of dropouts and
disaffected students, young people in
socially difficult situations are not the
only ones that don’t make it. There
are plenty of “mom and pop” kinds
of kids who’re also dropping out, or
are disaffected. 
Perhaps what’s new though is our
concern over the situation, and our
understanding of the high cost of
disaffection. As an example, almost
95 percent of boys in young offender
institutions in the UK have either
been excluded from school,
persistently truanted or dropped out
before reaching their 16th birthday
(and every young offender costs at
least £75,000 per year to keep in
prison). Girls who become alienated
from school run an increased risk of
getting pregnant. Britain holds the
worst records in western Europe for
teenage pregnancies at 33 births for
every thousand girls aged between 15
and 19: five times the rate of Holland.
There is now widespread
acceptance of the fact that education
is fundamental to a person’s

development, their capacity to
survive and lead a fulfilling life in our
so-called knowledge societies – where
knowledge is the key to a country’s
economic and social development,
but also the key to individual
empowerment, to a decent job, home
and lifestyle. 
That we still have such a significant
dropout problem in those countries
that supposedly have the capacity to
provide an education for all, means
that what we are providing isn’t good
enough. It means that schools are not
in tune with what young people need
and want today. It means that teachers
are not well enough equipped with the
understanding and skills to deal with
the problems and difficulties of young
people; that schools are not providing
the right environment for children to
develop as citizens.
What can be done to reconnect 
kids with education?
Clearly if the tide is to turn, so too
must policies, attitudes, structures.
The system must be more responsive
to the various needs, backgrounds
and abilities of all students while not
compromising standards and
expectations for the more able end of
the spectrum. The response must be
comprehensive in scope.
Concretely, that means designing
education systems that are more
flexible. It means making schools
truly democratic – and that goes
beyond the simple establishment of
school councils. We should be
striving for is real participation in the
classroom. We need to open schools
to the outside community and to
parents. And we need to pay much
more attention to individual children
and have mechanisms in place to get
them the expert help they need as
early as possible. Kids on the skids
need monitoring by properly trained
people. It’s been well established that
a “significant” adult in a child’s life
can turn them around.
Are there any examples that could
show us the way forward?
There are plenty. In Europe,
Denmark’s education system takes
top marks. The system is based on
mutual respect between teacher and
pupil and a culture of dialogue: the
teachers don’t just stand up in front
of the class – children work with
them and with each other in a
collaborative effort. There’s no
grading system, no high stakes
testing. It’s a system that also offers
strong vocational programmes to
students. Denmark’s drop out rate is
only 4.3 percent.
While the US is home to some of
the worst results and practices, it is
also where some of the best work is
being done. In New Haven
(Connecticut), a compulsory
programme of social and emotional
learning for children from six to 18 –
teaching skills required for decision-
making, peer relationships, problem-
solving, resisting drugs and alcohol,
stress management, self-control,
violence prevention and sexuality –
has reaped amazing results. Between
1992 and 1996, the numbers of sixth
graders having to repeat a grade was
cut by ten percent. The number of
fourth graders achieving good or
excellent results in tests of their verbal
and non-verbal skills jumped from 41
to 72 percent. Dropout rates,
suspensions and exclusions all fell, the
number of kids carrying guns to
school dropped by half.
In Australia, multi-agency
approaches are turning up good
results. Schools are linking up with
public and private welfare
organizations and community groups
to bring kids in difficulty the support
services they and their parents may
need, and opening up different
learning opportunities. 
Cooperation, collaboration and
coherence are also the pillars of a
model being used successfully in
Holland, which aims to help young
people in difficulty to overcome some
of the disadvantages – economic and
cultural for example, that may hold
them back. The main idea is that the
fewer the differences between the
ethos and experiences at school, at
home and in the community, the
greater the progress of children’s
development. And because of the
enormous resources available to
schools, it is there where the ultimate
responsibility for creating educational
opportunities lies.

Aren’t these rather piecemeal
solutions for a problem that is
becoming more complex and truly
international?
There are so many pedagogically
and psychologically sound approaches
being used in diverse corners of the
world to engage young people in their
learning that not a single spoke of yet
another wheel needs to be invented.
It’s all there for the taking, if we know
where to look for them and how to
adapt them to our particular needs. 
In an ideal world, for example, the
education system in Taiwan, say, will
admit that though it produces top
marks internationally in math and
science, the creative expression of the
children there has been sacrificed in
the process to their detriment. So it
will look to, for example, a school in
Tennessee (USA) using the Leonard
Bernstein Center model, in which the
curriculum is delivered through the
arts, and borrow some of the
methodologies from there. At the
same time, pre-school educators in
Britain will reassess the wisdom of
introducing literacy and numeracy to
four year olds and look at Hungary,
where children attain higher test
scores although they start reading
and number work two to three years
later. And in the same hour, a
secondary school in Caracas
(Venezuela) with a heavy caseload of
truancy, underachievement and
disruptive behaviour will look to the
multi-agency support systems
practiced in Western Australia. There,
no child is left to suffer or drift off,
because assessment of all students
ensures that a myriad of problems are
identified and dealt with in different,
student-friendly ways.
Children of the future, like those of
the present, will need to communicate
well, to interact at sophisticated levels
with others, to solve problems
creatively and to be flexible and
imaginative in their thinking. For that
to happen, schools need to see them
and treat them as individuals, helping
them to deal with the baggage that
they’re bringing in with them
everyday and stimulating them so that
they will want to learn. For unless
school learning is seen as part of a
continuum in the context of each
child’s life, it will remain stuck in the
19th century, where it remained for
most of the 20th.
