WHAT
CAN WE DO
ABOUT
MARINE
POLLUTION?

This dying guillemot
is a victim of marine
pollution. It was
trapped in an oil
slick and washed up
on the French coast.

muscles had been
irreversibly damaged
and it had only a
few hours to live
when the photo was

PERIODICALLY, the hue and cry
is raised that a sea is dead or
an ocean is dying. And, just
as often, authorities reply that there
is really nothing to worry about as
long as a few precautions are taken.
The fuss usually starts with a sud¬
den event like an oil spill, a tainted
fish catch or an accident in a chemi¬
cal plant, then dies away just as
quickly when the mess is cleaned up
so that we may go on doing things
more or less the same way.
But where does the truth lie ?
Who is right, the prophets of doom
or the voices that soothe? What
exactly are the dangers of marine
pollution ? How can we detect them
in time to protect ourselves and our
seas?
Such questions were part of the
brief given Dr. Edward D. Goldberg of
Scripps Institution of Oceanography
at La Jolla, California, one of the
world's foremost marine chemists,
when he set out to prepare a preli¬
minary report on "The Health of the
Oceans", which has just been pub¬
lished by Unesco, in Paris, on behalf
of its Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission.
What Dr. Goldberg stresses is not
so much the soiled beach or the lit¬
tered bay but much more subtle
effects. "Some of today's concerns
will be tomorrow's irrelevancies," he
writes. "It is probable that the
petroleum supplies of the world will
be exhausted before effective mea¬
sures to substantially reduce leaks
to the oceans are instituted. In the
future, the rising costs of heavy
metals will cause greater re-use and
less loss to the environment than is
now being experienced...
"On the other hand, the long resi¬
dence times of chemicals in the open
ocean may lead to the formation of a
toxic broth through the slow accu¬
mulation of man's wastes. There is
taking place today in the deep waters
of the open oceans a gradual but
continuous build-up of synthetic che¬
micals containing chlorine, and some¬
times fluorine, atoms, the so-called
halocarbons. Initially entering the
coastal ocean through sewer outfalls
and the surface waters of the open
ocean via the atmosphere as gases,
they are transferred by physical and
biological processes to the deep
ocean in less than a decade.
"Some of these chemicals are
known to interfere with metabolic
processes of living organisms. The
heavier compounds like DDT or the
polychlorinated biphenyls (the PCBs)
affect the calcium metabolism of
marine birds with the result that their
eggs have thin shells.
"Other chemicals such as the chlo-
rofluorocarbons, which are used as
aerosol propellants, may interfere
with the fermentation of micro-orga¬
nisms. As a possible consequence,
the breakdown of organic matter in
the normal biochemical cycles would
be inhibited. In addition, man's use
of fermentation, such as in sewage-
digestion systems and in the produc¬
tion of wines and beers, could be
affected adversely.
"Our concern is the haunting pos¬
sibility that levels of a toxic material
can rise so high that exposure of
organisms to such material in the
open ocean, as well as in the coas¬
tal ocean, may result in widespread
mortality or disease.
"For today there is no turning
back. The great volume of the open
ocean makes removal of a toxic subs¬
tance, identified by a catastrophic
event, an endeavour beyond man¬
kind's capabilities with" the techno¬
logies of today or of the foreseeable
future...
"The slow but continuous altera¬
tion of the open-ocean waters can
offer future generations the legacy of
a poisonous ocean. Today, we are
adding annually millions of tons of
synthetic compounds, such as halo-
genated hydrocarbons, to the ocean
system. If these substances mix
with the deep ocean, they will be
transferred within a decade to zones
below the mixed layer, where they
may remain for thousands of years...
At what level might they irreversibly
damage the ecosystem ?"
Dr. Goldberg remarks that surveil¬
lance of the state of the ocean's
health to ward off such a disaster is
beyond the economic and scientific ^
resources of any single nation. The r

problem is ocean-sized, yet there are
less than a dozen laboratories in the
world capable of measuring DDT or
petroleum components in sea water.
The number of laboratories analy¬
sing concentrations of elements such
as plutonium, is about the same and,
states Dr. Goldberg, the development
of nuclear-power plants in coastal
areas raises the possibility of a large
number of small leaks of waste mate¬
rials over long periods which can
eventually produce a dangerously
radioactive ocean.
Old approaches have been found
wanting. The first measurements of
DDT in the atmosphere were a thou¬
sand times too low because only its
particulate forms were being analy¬
sed. We now know that it moves
about the surface of the earth mainly
in the vapour state.
The general assumption that petro¬
leum is entirely biodegradable and
that bacteria in the sea are prima¬
rily responsible for its decomposition
does not seem to be entirely true.
What occurs in the laboratory does
not necessarily happen at sea.
What we can say at present is that
marine micro-organisms are capable
of degrading some components of
oils, but that the rates of decomposi¬
tion in the natural situation are poorly
known," Dr. Goldberg states.
In a tragi-comic vein are his des¬
criptions of litter in the sea. On one
60-mile stretch of beach near Am-
chitka, Alaska, certainly no densely-
populated hive, 24,000 plastic items
have been counted.
A survey of 12.5 square kilometres
of the surface of the central North
Pacific in 1973 revealed six plastic
bottles, twenty-two plastic fragments,
twelve glass fishing floats, four glass
bottles, rope, an old balloon, finished
wood, a shoebrush, a rubber sandal,
a coffee can and three paper items.
Clearly, a warning system is need¬
ed. Dr. Goldberg has proposed a
one-year baseline-sampling program¬
me as a starting point. It would
mean collecting and analysing one
thousand samples from the atmos¬
phere, the ocean currents, marine
organisms, rivers and continental
shelf areas, rain, glaciers and deepsea
sediments.
Since this would be admittedly
costly, he suggests as a first step a
"mussel/barnacle watch" concentra¬
ting on species known to concentrate
pollutants. It would analyse 100
samples annually for petroleum hydro¬
carbons, artificial radionuclides, chlo¬
rinated hydrocarbons and heavy
metals"those substances that have
been shown to jeopardize life pro¬
cesses in the ocean."
Dr. Goldberg thinks that the entire
programme could be underwritten for
less than $ 300,000. If he is right,
one can only ask not when the
"mussel/barnacle watch" will begin
but why it was not started long ago.
