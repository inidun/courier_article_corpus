ONE OF
GRANDEST VIEWS
OF CENTRAL
EUROPE
The dam construction engineer is closely bound up with
nature. His work is carried out not in the laboratory or
workshop but in wild natural surroundings, the beauty and
harmony of which he makes every effort to preserve. Although
a rising dam is inevitably accompanied by a mass of rubble
and sometimes unsightly disorder, the completed dam in
almost every case adds a touch of stylistic beauty to the majes¬
tic natural scene.
Aerial photograph, right, shows a remarkable view of three
recently-completed dams in their magnificent setting of the
Glockner-Tauern range in southern Austria's Tyrol : Llmberg
dam (foreground), Mooser dam (right) Drossen dam (left).
The summit of Mount Grossglockner, rising to 12,460 feet
(3,798 metres) nearby, affords one of the grandest views
to be had in Central Europe.
Before the last World War, the Austrian Alps were one of Eu¬
rope's chief remaining undeveloped natural resources. Today,
with dams and power stations dotting its mountain lakes and
rivers, Austria is well on the way to becoming the " Interna¬
tional Power Station" of Central Europe. Austria already
exports power to Italy and Germany, and other European
countries and the Ruhr are prospective future customers.
In I 947 all electric power companies in Austria were nation¬
alized, and the Austrian Electric Power Corporation (Ver¬
bundsgesellschaft) set up under government's auspices. With
its affiliated companies, the Verbundsgesellschaft and other
public corporations today operate almost 80 per cent of Aus¬
tria's total electric power. The World Bank has made five
loans to Austria for electric power development totalling
$56 million. These loans are helping to add 630,000 kilo¬
watts to the country's installed capacity.
One $12 million loan is for the great Reisseck-KreuzecTîla'nT
project, south of the Glockner-Tauern range. Four natural
lakes high in the Reisseck mountains will be made to serve
as reservoirs. The height of these reservoirs provides a head
on the turbines of some 5,500 feet, the highest in the world.

In I9S4, after 60 hours of continuous rain, the "gentle" Danube rose to heights rarely known in history, flooding several Austrian provinces. After
the last war, a multi-nation Danube Committee was set up for river development as well as flood control. The Jochenstein dam was completed by
Austria and Germany jointly in 1956. Fifteen dams are now planned by Austria's engineers on the 213 mile stretch of the Austrian Danube.
One of largest is World Bank-financed Ybbs-Persenbeug dam (left below), 80 miles from Vienna. Its six turbines will generate 192,000 kW. Also
Bank-financed is Lunersee project (above and below right), in western Austria which will divert water from a glacier to Luner Lake dam reservoir.

INLAND WATERWAYS AND CANALS are today the
backbone of Belgium's transport, accounting for one-third
of total freight traffic and carrying the bulk of the country's
coal and steel production. Though Antwerp lies many miles
inland it is the principal port having been made accessible to
the largest freighters. Canals serving evçry part of the country
radiate from the city. Every effort is being made to modernize
the canal network. The World Bank is helping with loans
totalling ?3 0 million. Above, a section of the Charleroi-
Seneffe Canal (linking southern Belgium with Antwerp and
Brussels) which will be straightened and widened to accom¬
modate large barges up to 1,3 50 tons. Photo on left
shows a giant lock nearing completion stage at Gosselies.
