I n and o u t of slavery
Do artists uphold prejudice or offer a novel way of looking at ourselves?
A few hints culled from the colonial era and beyond give a sense of how
art goes about telling the body’s history
1 . S H ATTERED IDEALS
W
hen visual artists represent the body,
whose body is being talked about,
and can that body stand for others
or only for itself? It would be
comforting to tell a story in which
people from the past misused the body, only for more
enlightened figures from our own time to set the
record straight.Like most stories with a happy ending,
this would be just a story.History is more complicated
and less reassuring. In trying to think about a history
of bodies, it is necessary to highlight certain themes
because the body is in a sense everything: m e d i c i n e,
w a r, s e x u a l i t y,“ r a c e,” g e n d e r,p e r f o r m a n c e,dance and
so on. On the other
h a n d , the body can be
treated as nothing, o r
as a commodity, t h a t
is to say, s o m e t h i n g
that is bought and sold
in slavery.
Slavery has been
defined as “ s o c i a l
d e a t h .” If humans are,
in Aristotle’s phrase,
“social animals,” t h e n
to be a slave is to be
d e fined by others as
simply a body, a dead
person who works.
B y looking at the
changing depictions
of the body in and out
of slavery, we get a
measure of how our
own bodies have
been evaluated over
time.
Some might think
that this is a
“politically correct”
t o p i c, detracting from
the impact of art.Th e
reverse can also be
a r g u e d : a failure to
understand the social
and historical context
in which artworks
were made reduces them to mere decorations. It is
precisely because art is so powerful that we need to
understand more about how it works. To take an
e x a m p l e, the brand-new Sainsbury gallery for A f r i c a n
art in the British Museum, L o n d o n , places the entire
continent in three galleries divided only by medium—
sculpture, fabrics, pottery. Here self-confident and
highly realistic 16t h-century bronze sculptures from
the powerful kingdom of Benin stand alongside the
tormented abstract minkisi power figures from the
Belgian Congo, as if both expressed something about
an eternal A f r i c a . In fact the Benin bronzes show so
powerfully what Africa was capable of before slavery
and colonization that 19th-century Europeans
assumed that they could not have been made by
Africans and theorized that perhaps refugees from
the lost city of Atlantis had been responsible.
The Cartesian
heritage
The m i n k i s i figures were made at the height of the
colonial terror in the Belgian Congo and were used
by a nganga, or operator, to call on the spirits of the
ancestors in the struggle against colonization. If this
seems to be evidence of a supposed A f r i c a n
“primitivism,” it should be noted that the Belgian
colonizers believed that the power figures worked
and did everything they could to capture them, w i t h
the result that many American and European
museums have fine examples. By trying to place
these figures into grand, abstract categories like art,
or even Africa, the curators missed the chance to
show how art tells the history of the body as one of
conflict and change.
The modern Western history of the body usually
begins with the separation by French philosopher
René Descartes of mind and body. Writing in the
mid-17th century, Descartes argued that the body
was only connected to the mind at the pineal gland—
which in fact produces hormones in response to
light—that became a point of interface between two
radically separate entities.In his view, the body simply
responded to the environment and to sense
p e r c e p t i o n s, whereas the mind reflected on those
perceptions and took decisions that might or might
not agree with them. For example, the eye sees a
perspective drawing as “ r e a l ,” while the mind knows

it is an illusion. By introducing doubt, D e s c a r t e s
broke the traditional continuum between mind and
body that saw both as natural and asserted a higher
status for the mind. Perhaps the body was something
that the European elite wished to distance itself from,
now that the trade in human beings across the A t l a n t i c
was in full swing.
The French port
of Nantes sent out
108 slavers to the
Guinea coast as
early as 1666,taking
on board 37,340
A f r i c a n s. Slavery in
the French colonies
was controlled by
the infamous C o d e
N o i r decreed by
Louis XIV. Th i s
separate legal code
for the enslaved gave
the slave owner the
same kind of power
on his plantation
that the king enjoyed
nationally—that is to
s a y, the power of life
and death.The king’s
body was uniquely
powerful, especially
as depicted in art.
For the king was held to have two bodies, one physical
and one spiritual.The spiritual body was the essence
of the monarchy that never died, slept or became ill.
That body was shown in portraits and statues around
the nation and the French colonies. By the same
token, the bodies of the king’s subjects were mere
o b j e c t s,whether that of a French peasant or a colonial
s l a v e. So the philosophical division of the person
into body and soul was complicated by the political
doubling of the royal body and haunted by the ghosts
of the enslaved.
Race takes
the stage
During the French Revolution of 1789, t h e s e
tensions burst into the open. At that time Santo
Domingo (now Haiti), the jewel in the Fr e n c h
colonial crown, received 1,587 ships, more than
France’s largest port, Marseilles. But beginning in
1 7 9 1 ,H a i t i ’s enslaved Africans joined the revolution
and overthrew the colonial regime.As the revolution
thought through the consequences of the Declaration
of the Rights of Man (1789) and the abolition of the
monarchy (1792), it became clear that slavery would
have to go. On February 3,1794,a group of Haitian
delegates to the Convention, the revolutionary
parliament, successfully proposed the abolition of
s l a v e r y. One of these men was Jean-Baptiste Belley,
a former slave who had been born in West A f r i c a .I n
1 7 9 7 , the artist Anne-Louis Girodet painted Belley’s
p o r t r a i t . It is a remarkable evocation of the tensions
of the period expressed through one person’s body.
Belley stands against a tropical landscape,
wearing the uniform of a Convention member. His
face is rendered in the traditional three-quarter style
used for nobles and monarchs.At the same time, h i s
body has an unusual twist to the hips, giving it a
somewhat feminine feel. His masculinity is
nonetheless asserted by a prominent bulge in his
trousers.
Belley rests on a bust of the abbé Raynal,who
had called for the abolition of slavery. The marble
whiteness of the bust and its classical straight
forehead contrast with Belley’s dark skin and a
prominently sloped forehead. In the period, t h i s
cranial angle, as it was called, was taken as a mark of
low intelligence. How should this portrait be
understood? The simple fact that an African was
painted in the royal style by a European artist marks
a remarkable shift, while the various markers placed
on his body by the artist tried to assert a new form of
superiority:that of race.
Revisiting The Jungle Book
Ironically the very success of the movement to
abolish the Atlantic slave trade engendered a new
form of distinguishing between human bodies as
belonging to different races. Under slavery people
were legally different. Now a new means of
classifying human bodies was devised. A n
extraordinary volume of scientific and artistic work
was produced in the effort to define and make visible
the supposed eternal differences of race.E v e r y t h i n g

from skin colour to the shape of the skull,nose and
b r e a s t s, and every aspect of culture was used as
evidence to prove that humans were biologically
d i s t i n c t .Art played an important role in the system,
from supplying evidence of difference in the
comparison of Greek statues to African bodies to
instructing young people how to make race visible
in images.While many radical artists were involved
in the struggles to abolish slavery, they were
exceptions to the mainstream rule.
The highest price paid for the work of any artist in
the 19th century was for Edwin Long’s 1875 T h e
B a bylonian Marriage Market.This painting showed a
slave auction in antiquity, with authentic historical
d e t a i l . In the foreground, facing the viewer, was a
racialized hierarchy of
enslaved women ranging
from a white woman at
left who looks at herself
c o n fidently in a mirror via
Asian women to an
African woman who
covers her face in
apparent shame.The main
action of the scene
showed a woman being
unclothed on the slave
block to the appreciative
gaze of a male audience,
who appear to be mostly
Je w i s h . This cornucopia
of stereotypes won Long
a position in Britain’s
Royal Academy and a
career as a portrayer of
the “ t y p e s ” that science
then assured everyone to
be real.
In the present, race is
a term whose very
meaning is uncertain.
Scientists have shown
that all humans share
9 9 . 9 percent of their
genes and the visible
markers of the body are minor variations of no
substantive importance. But racism has not gone
away as the recent wave of hostility to outsiders in
Western Europe clearly shows. In part that is because
race is no longer understood as it was in the 19th
century as science but as part of popular culture.
One of the first feature films was D.W. Griffith’s
1916 epic Birth of a Nation that tells the story of the
rise of Ku Klux Klan in the American South, using
white actors in black face to portray A f r i c a n
Americans in atrocious stereotypes. Throughout the
20th century, films like Tarzan of the A p e s p r e s e n t e d
Africans as primitive savages. When such subjects
were challenged by the civil rights movement and
d e c o l o n i z a t i o n , they were simply displaced to
cartoons like The Jungle Book (1966) that portrays
jazz as literally the music of monkeys.
A new generation of artists is challenging us once
again to rethink old means of imagining ourselves
and others.The controversial young African A m e r i c a n
artist Kara Walker has challenged the prevailing
assumption that all images of minorities in the United
States should show people engaged in positive and
uplifting activities. By contrast, her silhouette fig u r e s
cut out of black paper show both Africans and
Europeans in an extraordinary range of what might be
called perverse activities.
By using the 19t h-century silhouette format once
taught to polite Victorian ladies, Walker at once
reminds us that the leisure of such women was
enabled by the free or unfree labour of others and
suggests that not that much has changed since then.
Her work makes us realize that oppression really
functions to denature both the oppressor and the
o p p r e s s e d .While some critics have fiercely denounced
her work, Walker has already won a MacArthur
“genius”grant.
Another contemporary artist who sees the
Victorian past in the present is Nigerian Yi n k a
S h o n i b a r e, who recreates elaborate ball-gowns of
the period, correct in every detail, except that the
fabrics he uses are West African kente cloth, not the
sedate cottons and silks that Europeans of the period
once wore.These dresses make colour in all senses of
the term visible. In similar vein, the Ja p a n e s e
photographer Yosimasa Morimura photographs
himself in a variety of staged situations, often wearing
drag. Posing as the model for Manet’s 1865 painting
Olympia, Morimura completely alters the dynamic
of the image. Whereas the original showed a white
p r o s t i t u t e, whose sexuality was alluded to via the
figure of her African maid, the photographic
recreation forces us to reconsider the question of
what whiteness might actually be.
All these artists take the long view.They seem to
suggest that despite the advances of recent decades,
the historical legacy of slavery and colonialism is far
from played out.At the same time, the very fact that
artists from around the world are engaging in such a
reevaluation of history is itself grounds for a degree
of hope. One thing is certain:the body is going to be
a key subject in art for a long time to come. ■
