The seventh centenary of the birth of Dante in 1265 was marked last year by celebrations the
world over. In Paris, at the end of two sessions of round table discussions led by Profes¬
sor Vittore Branca of the University of Padua, Unesco organized a special commemorative
ceremony on the evening of October 28 to honour the great poet. In the presence of the Minis¬
ter of Education of Italy, Mr. Luigi Gui, leading personalities of the world of letters paid tribute to
the work of Dantei and his continuing influence across the ages: Marcel Brion of the Académie
Française spoke of four famous illustrators of Dante (Botticelli, Blake, Doré and Dali); the
Italian poet Eugenio Móntale spoke on "Dante, Yesterday and Today"; llya Ehrenburg on
"The Poet's Universality", and Mary McCarthy on "Dante's Paradise and the New World".
"If Dante seems so close to us today," Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu, said in
an introductory address, "it is partly perhaps because like our own generation, he lived in
a time of wars, fratricidal strife and persecution. What we particularly admire in Dante is
that amid the upheavals he lived through he maintained an unswerving faith in man, and suc¬
ceeded, misfortunes and calamities notwithstanding, in upholding the universal values
which all men at heart hold dear." And as Eugenio Móntale pointed out: "Dante is the only
great European poet of medieval times whose words have remained alive and meaningful even to
those without special literary training." It is precisely this universality of Dante's writings and
his relevance to our times that llya Ehrenburg stressed in his address, the most salient pass¬
ages of which are reproduced below.

DANTE
by llya Ehrenburg
the primacy
of poetry
he greatness of Dante is
evident, if only from the
enthusiasm his work arouses in
every part of our disunited world,
whether among the inhabitants of
inferno, real or imaginary, among those
who do not regard themselves as
living in purgatory, or among the illu¬
sory shades of paradise.
Reading is an act of creation: every
reader of the Divine Comedy brings
to Dante's text something of himself
a fragment, as it were, of his cen¬
tury. There are thousands of commen¬
taries lined up on the library shelves.
Dante is transformed into the hero of
his own Comedy and is written
about as freely as Hamlet is, or Don
Quixote. Some represent him as a
gloomy Scholastic, others as an im¬
passioned subversive figure bent on
the demolition of various dogmas,
others again as a visionary sage
whom the Popes, by some oversight,
failed to admit to the company of the
saints.
Dante Alighieri dreamed of posthu¬
mous fame, nor was he mistaken.
Never has he been forgotten, except
during a period which considered poe¬
try in bad taste; and in 1757, when the
Italian Bottinelli wrote slightingly of the
Divine Comedy, Voltaire declared
that he admired his daring in calling
Dante a madman, and his poem a
monstrosity.
With the advent of romanticism the
curtain rose anew on poetry, and
Dante's Comedy was "re-discovered".
Goethe, Novalis, Byron, Shelley and
Pushkin, found it an inspiration.
A torrent of commentaries poured
forth. One book in particular, publish¬
ed in the middle of the 19th century,
and dedicated to Pope Pius VII,
intrigues' me. The author, a devout
Catholic, was a certain Eugène Aroux,
and the very title "Dante, heretic,
revolutionary and socialist" bears
witness to the exuberance of his
imagination. But this is an exception.
Most commentators, while disputing
ILYA EHRENBURG is a world-famous
Soviet writer and poet whose works have
been translated in 60 languages. Among
his works in English are "The Fall of Paris"
(1942); "The Thaw" (1956) and "People
and Life" (1962).
amongst themselves, endeavoured to
claim Dante for their own faction;
Catholics, atheists, royalists and
republicans alike proclaimed him one
of themselves.
The controversy did not die. Those
engaged in it were not, for the most
part, lovers of poetry, but Scholastics
of all persuasions. The end of the
13th century and the beginning of the
14th was a period of transition, which
can be called either the late Middle
Ages or else the dawn of the Renais¬
sance; thus it is easy to represent
Dante looking to the past or to the
future.
The French historian, Jacques Le
Goff, in his recent book "La Civilisa¬
tion de l'Occident médiéval" (medieval
western civilization), calls the Divine
Comedy a sublime poetical summing
up of medieval learning and mentality,
but one turned wholly towards the
past; a magnificent monument of
"reaction". At the same time, dozens
of other literary historians and critics,
compatriots and contemporaries of Le

Guidotti. Rome
Goff, describe Dante as a "human¬
ist", a "philosopher of the Renais¬
sance" and "the father of individual¬
istic poetry".
In Soviet literature, we find similar
polemics going on. In the 1920s,
Vladimir Fritshe, one of the popular
exponents of Marxism, flatly called
Dante "an imperialist in the medieval
sense of the term" a judgement which
was contested by Anatole Lunacharsky,
who considered Dante "the greatest
poet of the early Renaissance." In
1965, a literary critic and poet wrote
that students of Dante in the Soviet
Union are interested in him mainly as
a "political thinker and a moralist";
yet a young Soviet political thinker and
moralist has written an essay on the
complexity, profundity and power of
Dante as a poet.
If I have noted all these disputes,
past and present, it is not because I
myself intend to stick a new label on
his portrait, or classify him in any par¬
ticular category. (Although Giotto, who
knew him, has left us a portrait of
Dante, I do not believe it is a true
likeness: Giotto doubtless protrayed
Dante in the same arbitrary terms as
Dante described Beatrice.. All that
remains is Raphael's conventional
profile of Dante, and the same des¬
cription of him occurs again and again
even in Alexander Blok's poem "the
shade of Dante, with the aquiline
profile." Not a word about his face,
only the nose resembling an eagle's
beak: a convention. Pushkin speaks of
"austere Dante"; Valéry Bryusov
calls him a "sombre hero of bygone
years".)
I have referred to the thousands of
commentaries, the controversies, past
and present, simply as a pretext for
speaking about Dante, not as a spe¬
cialist but merely as a reader and a
writer of the mid-20th century. Need
I say that I am drawn to Dante as a
poet, and as a poet alone? We look
at the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci
for the aesthetic experience and visual
pleasure, without reference to his work
on engineering or anatomy: as we read
Faust, we do not think of Goethe's
studies on colour.
What interests me in Dante is not
the feuds between Guelphs, Blacks
and Whites, not Pope Boniface VIII,

DANTE (Cont'd)
not what Dante knew about
compasses or his ideas on geo¬
metry, Euclidean or non-Euclidean;
not his dream of a universal monarchy,
his conception of celestial perfection
nor any of the many other subjects
about which all the Dante experts in
the world, including some in my own
country, have written and are still writ¬
ing. I believe in the force and vitality
of poetry and, though Dante's learning
is out-dated, his sentiments, true to
the eternal laws of art, are still abun¬
dantly alive, and have the power to
kindle our imagination.
Croce the philosopher, the poets
Eliot and Saint John Perse, the
Soviet poets, Ossip Mandelshtam,
Anna Akhmatova and Zabolotsky, have
all praised the poetic intensity of the
Divine Comedy. Dante himself thought
it unlikely his work could be translated,
and he was no doubt right.
Each generation has its own
approach, and each reads Dante's
Comedy in its own way. I would like
to speak of what our generation finds
most remarkable in the work of the
great Florentine, as corresponding to
our own excursions into inferno, pur¬
gatory and paradise.
The first point I shall make is that
he was not impartial; for this
is something for which we Soviet
writers have all too often been criti¬
cized. The term "committed" is applied
to our poets with just a suggestion of
mockery, and it is alleged to account
for the failure of Soviet literature in
the past forty years or so to attain the
heights reached by the great Russian
writers of the last century. But this
explanation is not valid.
I have had occasion to quote many
writers who far from being hampered
by their lack of impartiality, on the
contrary found it an inspiration as in
the case of Stendhal, Dostoevsky and
many others.
But the best example of this is Dante
himself. Not only did he not eschew
politics: for long years of his life,
indeed, he lived for politics, and it was
on this account that he suffered exile:
"Thou shalt make trial of how
salt doth taste another's bread,
and how hard the path to
descend and mount upon
another's stair" (Paradise, XVII
58-61).
It was during the years of struggle
that the Divine Comedy was begun.
Alighieri still continued to negotiate
with other émigrés, the White Guelphs
but, disillusioned, he turned increas-

'Masterpieces

ingly towards the Ghibellines, hoping
for the intervention of Henry VII. In
short, he never turned his back on
politics, and the Divine Comedy is
suffused with political passion.
And Dante's partiality not only
helped him to write the Comedy; it
infused many a canto with passion and
vitality. But who nowadays is really
interested in the struggle between the
Guelphs and the Ghibellines, except
perhaps the Dante specialists who,
though they have devoted their entire
lives to studies of the poet, neverthe¬
less miss the very essence of his
poetry?
What degrades art is not tenden-
tiousness, but the tendency to adulter¬
ate the essence of art. It is often
salutary to recall the old adage that
there is no point in using a violin for
knocking in nails with, if only because
it is better to use a hammer and
because violins may come in useful on
other occasions. Stendhal, who was
as committed as any man could be,
scribbled the following note in the
margin of his manuscript of Lucien
Leuwen: " I must be careful not to let
the man of politics eclipse the man of
passion. The man of politics will be
gone fifty years from now. All we
need of him is what history finally
judges interesting."
Dante succeeded in writing a poem
which still' stirs the hearts of its
readers not merely fifty, but six
hundred and fifty years afterwards.
What interests us are not the causes
of the feuds, but the passions involved.
I wanted to make this point because
there are many purists whose criti¬
cism, just or unjust, of modern writers
labelled "committed", is based on
these grounds alone. Yet the fact of
expounding a cause has not prevented
my contemporaries Mayakovsky,
Eluard, Brecht, Aragon and Pablo
Neruda from becoming great poets.
One of the questions of interest to
us today is that of the realism of
Dante, the poet. The word "realism"
may sometimes sound a trifle abstract,
like the use of numbers in the Divine
Comedy; it is disparaged or lauded,
anathematized or sanctified, by turn.

As Beatrice leads
Dante towards Paradise,
he contemplates the souls
of the blessed a drawing by
the Italian painter,
Sandro Botticelli (1444-1510).
At Unesco's commemoration
of the seventh centenary
of Dante's birth,
Marcel Brion, the French author,
analyzed the different ways
in which great artists
have illustrated the "Divine Comedy."
Botticelli, in his view, was
Dante's most faithful interpreter,
and conceived his drawings
"like the schema for a moving picture,
five centuries before
that art form was invented."

I would like first of all to point out
the error of certain historians who
treat changes in artistic forms in the
same way as if they were dealing
with social progress or developments
in the exact sciences.
Stendhal, in his book on Italian
painting, describes Giotto as a clumsy
precursor of the great art of the
Renaissance. Such was the generally
accepted view during the first decades
of the 19th century. Then came the
time when the merits of the Quattro¬
cento were recognized. First, people
became enamoured of Botticelli ; then
later Masaccio was "discovered" and
it is now claimed that the work of
this artist, who died young, contains
all the seeds of modern painting. The
same cannot, I think, be said of
Raphael But does this make his
frescoes any the less perfect?
HE attitude to the painters
of the past varies accord¬
ing to the particular tastes and aspi¬
rations of every epoch. Is Giotto to
be labelled primitive because he lack¬
ed the eclectic academic skill of Guido
Reni? What Giotto had to express
was very different from the learning
and the canons of the 17th century.
Can the simplified forms of Picasso
and Braque be attributed to inability to
depict the universe in terms of a series
of colour photographs?
The Western world was evolving,
the knowledge of geography, physics
and astronomy expanding. In the
13th century, the sculptors working on
the Gothic cathedrals produced an
encyclopedia, in plastic form, of the
learning of their age, so that some
of the figures in their bas reliefs may
make us smile. For all that, these
sculptors were no less skilled, indeed
they were more so, than many of those
working in the second half of the
present century.
Victor Hugo once wrote that science
progresses constantly by a felicitous
process of self-cancellation. Science,
he said, is a ladder ; poetry a winged
flight... Masterpieces are born eternal.
Dante does not cancel out Homer.
Hugo knew that the Earth revolves.
Our contemporaries have learned that
infinity is not an abstract conception,
but a reality. This invalidates Dante's
cosmogony and cosmography, but
detracts nothing from his poetry.
Realism in art stems from the feeling
of real life, nature and man; and in
this sense Dante, like all true artists,
was certainly a realist. We read his
Divine Comedy with supreme interest
even though the symbolism of
numbers, the sanctity of the divers
dogmas and Dante's dreams of a
peaceful and just monarchy leave us
cold.
The picture Dante draws not only
of inferno and purgatory but of
paradise as well is based on the
image of the Earth, on all that he
himself has seen and lived through.
It is true that the scenes he describes
are drawn from fantasy, but is not
fantasy, after all, part and parcel of
the real world of man? Are not
Gogol's "The Overcoat" and Kafka's
"The Trial" in their way realistic?
Dante's vision, permeating both the
spiritual nature of the poet and the
purpose of the Divine Comedy, may
be described as realistic fantasy. Goya
was endowed with stupendous fantasy,
and his war scenes have nothing in
common with the battle pictures
painted by his contemporaries. But
Picasso, in his "Guernica" gave us
something different a foreboding of
Hiroshima. Dante, wandering through
the world beyond the grave, has
constantly before his eyes familiar
scenes from life on Earth. He is a
living person among the shades of
the dead-
Dante is a humanist and a realist;
but he is, first and foremost, a great
poet capable of transcending the
bounds of both Christian dogma and
naive realism. We have perforce to
forgive him the incident of the
discovery of a second, unknown world,
for which Ulysses was so cruelly
punished; and must accept the fact
that Dante spent his life straying not
only through the streets of Italy, but
also through the subterranean maze of
obscure emotions.
In purgatory, Dante meets the sing¬
er Casella, whom he knew and loved
on Earth; and begs him timidly:
"If a new law take not from
thee
memory or skill in that song of
love
which was wont to calm my
every desire,
may it please thee therewith
to solace awhile my soul...''
(Purgatory II, 106-109).
Whereupon Casella sings the love
song from Dante's Convivio and the
dwellers in purgatory, together with
Dante and even the wise Virgil, listen
enchanted until the guardian of the
lost souls, Cato of Utica, the Stoic,
who slew himself with his own sword
after the defeat of the republican
party, hustles up to chide the shades
entranced by the sweet strains...
"What is this, ye laggard spirits?...
Haste to the mount". And drives them
back to their task.
WHAT now remains of the
feud between Guelphs and
Ghibellines, the religious dogmas, and
the doctrines of Aristotle or Plato?
Dante's Divine Comedy itself, the
power and the music of his poetry
with all due deference to Cato of
Utica and his like.
Historians have indeed a difficult
task. We feast on the miraculous
apples, while they have to analyse the
soil from which the apple-trees sprang.
The Divine. Comedy ends with the
famous line :
"...The Love that moves the
Sun and the other stars".
Every child now knows that Dante
was wrong in thinking that the Sun and
the other heavenly bodies revolve
round the Earth; but every modern
man with a spark of humanity in him
knows in his heart that Dante was
right, and that love indeed moves the
Sun and the other heavenly bodies, «-j
including this planet, not very large ¿\
it is true, but important none the less,
the one which we call the Earth.
