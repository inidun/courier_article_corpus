A look through the pages of the re¬
cently published Volume XIV of
"Index Translationum", the latest
edition of Unesco's annual international
bibliography of translations (*), confirms
some of the world's regular translation
patterns and also reveals some surprising
new trends in 1961 the period covered
by this volume.
In the first category we find that the
Bible still retained its place as the world's
most translated work in 1961 with 246
translations (258 in 1960) while Lenin was
still the world's most translated author
(185 compared with 240).
In the cases of some other authors there
have been some surprising fluctuations
from one year to the next. Tagore, for
example, was translated 101 times (30 in
1960) though this increase is easily ex¬
plained by the fact that 1961 was the
centenary of Tagore's birth and the anni¬
versary was celebrated in different coun¬
tries by the publication of translations,
poems, essays and other works.
Conversely there have been some sharp
reductions for authors in the top bracket
of translation lists: Shakespeare, 98 (134
in 1960); Jules Verne, 88 (122); Dostoiev¬
sky, 79 (79); Tolstoy, 115 (122); Chekov,

66 (108). Even so, these names remain
high up in the list. The reduction can
probably be explained by the fact that
works by these writers are by now more
or less universally known.
In other cases there have been increas¬
es. Translations of Mark Twain rose to
72 and those of the children's friend, Hans
Anderson, to 53. Authors of ancient times
who have maintained their position include
Aristotle (23) and Euripides (19). The
great 19th century novelists continue
their world-wide travels Balzac 61 trans¬
lations, Dickens, 58 while among the
modern authors, Simenon has 68 transla¬
tions, followed by Hemingway (65), Sho-
lokov (54) and Steinbeck (48). Jean-Paul
Sartre is also among the authors whose
works have crossed most frontiers during
1961: 42 translations compared with 19
in 1960. Graham Greene increased his
total from 58 to 60. Playwrights too have
been on the move: 11 translations for
Ionesco, 13 for Durrenmatt. Works of
philosophy translated included nine by
Father Teilhard de Chardin.
This latest "Index Translationum" (the
14th edition published by Unesco) listing
32.931 titles translated in 1961 in 77 coun¬
tries (31,230 in 1960) is a unique publica
tion revised and compiled each year
thanks to collaboration' between libraries
and bibliographical organizations through¬
out the world.
Information given for each work in¬
cludes the name of the author, the title of
the translation, the name of the translator,
the place of publication, the price in the
currency of the country of publication, the
original language in which the work was
written and its original title.
Titles of the translations, given by coun¬
try, are indexed under: General Works;
Philosophy; Religion and Theology; Law,
Social Sciences and Education; Philology
and Linguistics; Natural and Exact Scien¬
ces; Applied Sciences; Arts, Games and
Sports; Literature; History, Biography and
Geography.
History, Biography and Geography is
the only section in which there has been
a decrease compared with the previous
year (2,729 compared with 2,818). Great¬
est increase is found in the literature sec¬
tion: 511 translations more than in 1960
(despite a drop of 412 in the U.S.S.R.
2,479 against 2,891 in 1960). This de¬
crease is, however, more than compen¬
sated for by a general increase in this
category of translations found in Germany,
Austria, Bulgaria, France (1,042 compar¬
ed with 844), India, Iran and several other
countries.
In this astonishing switch from one lan¬
guage to another, Balzac turns up in Slo¬
vene, Oscar Wilde in Georgian, Shakes¬
peare in Chuvash, Thomas Mann in Lat¬
vian, Galsworthy in Esthonian, Pirandello
in Turkish, Garcia Lorca in Czech, Beau-
delaire in Swedish, Madame de Sévigné
in English, Edgar Allen Poe in Rumanian,
Conan Doyle in Arabic, Walter Scott in
Hindustani, Xenophon in Hebrew, Musa-
raki in French and Emily Bronte in Japan¬
ese.
Though literary works account for most
titles listed in "Index Translationum", some
countries have given preference to other
kinds of works. In the United Kingdom,
for example, out of 717 published trans¬
lations (411 in 1960), there were 211
works in theology and religion (an in¬
crease of 25).
