Freedom of the press:
an appeal by the Director-
General of UNESCO
On the occasion of the International Day for Freedom of the Press, 20 April
1991, the Director-General of UNESCO launched a worldwide appeal.
Throughout the world, it becomes daily more apparent that
freedom of the press ¡s a constituent of democracy and develop¬
ment. It is a constituent of democracy inasmuch as the pluralistic
expression of opinion necessarily favours openness, dialogue
and mutual respect among individuals, peoples and cultures;
a constituent of development inasmuch as the exchange of
know-how, technical information and ideas contributes to the
training of human resources, to the spread of knowledge and
to economic progress.
Unfortunately, freedom of the press is still flouted in all too
many countries. In 1990 some forty journalists were killed in the
exercise of their profession; 200 or so were imprisoned; while
others have been held hostage for years, and may already have
abandoned hope.
In addition to these breaches of the most elementary human
rights, many news organizations have been subject to censor¬
ship. For there are still those who think that by reducing people
to silence they can cover up the facts, prevent the spread of
ideas and shackle freedom of the spirit. This is gravely to
underestimate the force of the mind, the fertility of ideas and
the eloquence of facts.
Today, I call on people everywhere to defend this form of
freedom. Let each and every one of us, through individual or
collective action, demand or facilitate the release of those jour¬
nalists taken hostage or imprisoned and the lifting of politically
or economically motivated curbs on the press. Let governments
become aware of the wider implications of freedom of the press.
We shall then have won a guarantee of greater balance in the
future.
