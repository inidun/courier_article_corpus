For over a century Japanese society was welded together by a struggle to catch up
with the West. Now, as the old certainties fade away, Japanese youth faces
a complex and ruthless world.

It has often been said that Ja p a n ,u n l i k e
the United Stat e s , is not a country of
i m m i gr a n t s , and that for all practical
p u rposes it has a single religion and a single
l a n g u a g e .W h at ’s more, since their country
emerged from isolation in the Meiji Pe ri o d1
the Japanese have had one ove r w h e l m i n g
n ational aim: m o d e rn i z at i o n .The profound
desire for modern i z ation worked like a cen-
t ripetal force on the people to bring them
all into a single close circle of stability.To d ay,
t h at circle is disintegr at i n g .The modern i-
z ation of Japan ended in the 1970s.T h at
was when the gr e at national aim that had
existed since the Meiji period ceased to exist
and as a result the nat i o n ’s centripetal force
petered out. In eve ry fie l d , the communi-
t y ’s standards, the way things were done and
e ven communicated were called in ques-
t i o n . For previous generations of Ja p a n e s e
yo u t h , it was enough just to become part of
a ny highly ranked sector of the Ja p a n e s e
c o m m u n i t y. E n t ry into highly selective uni-
ve rs i t i e s , major industries and powe r f u l
bureaucracies brought with it the promise
of a stable life.
To d ay, in a Japan fully conscious that
m o d e rn i z ation is over and that we have
caught up with the We s t , we turn to our
youth and ask them not for the devotion that
s e rved us so well in the past but for fully
1 Meiji was the throne name of Mitsuhito (1852-
1912), emperor of Japan from 1867 to 1912.
During his reign Japan began a rapid process of
Westernization, industrialization and expansion in
foreign affairs.

k n ow l e d g e . I think that less than five per
cent of young people have actually regi s-
tered this message from society and are acti-
vely seeking an education that will provide
the necessary training.Whether this per-
centage falls to three or rises to eight is going
to be what makes or breaks Japan in the
future.
The gr e at number of young people who
have not got the message fritter away their
time as slaves to commercialism or fa l l
under the sway of some chari s m atic fa s h i o n .
The problem is that society has not made it
clear enough to them that to lead a full life
they now need specialized skills. So many
e l e m e n t a ry schoolchildren are still locked
into gruelling exam preparation schedules,
but no one is encouraging them to think
about what sort of training they are heading
for or how best to prepare for the future. I
think this is unfair.

p rising that we so often hear them say i n g
that they don’t know what to do next.
To d ay, so many Japanese have lost confi-
dence in themselves that the young have
become contaminated with it.This is unfor-
t u n at e . At the same time, m a ny consider
t h at the Japanese tradition of indirectness
in communication is no longer functional.
This is not so unfortunate.
From now on, Japanese youth will be
divided between the few who succeed and
the many who fa i l . For the large number
who are bound to fa i l , the future is uncer-
t a i n .To forget this uncert a i n t y, they delude
t h e m s e l ves with video games, m u s i c,

we leave them as they are, they will eve n-
tually seek revenge against a society which
did not give them clear advice when it was

se youth has gone over the 10 per cent mark,
but no adults here, politicians included,
seem to be worried. n

The prolific novelist, essayist and fil m - m a k e r
Ryu Murakami is a leading figure in the new
wave of Japanese literature that emerged in the late
1970s and the 1980s. He was born in 19 52 in Sasebo,
a city dominated by the nearby U.S. Navy base, and
the experience of growing up in the shadow of the
base underlies his views of America and Japan
and forms a major theme of his writing. Described
by another young Japanese novelist, Masahiko
Shimada, as “Japanese literature’s unpredictable
child”, he made a sensational debut as a novelist in
1976 with the semi-autobiogra p h i cal Almost Tra n s-
p a rent Blue, a best-seller which portrayed the lives
of young people immersed in a culture of sex,
drugs and rock n’ roll. Notable among his many
other novels, which have been widely translated, is
the award-winning Coin Lo c ker Babies ( 19 81), the
s t o ry of two infants abandoned by their mothers in
train station lockers. The ambivalence of his fasci-
nation with Western, and particular America n ,
popular culture can be seen in 69 ( 19 87), set in the
midst of Japan’s 1969 student unrest, and also in his
collection of essays American Dre a m ( 1985). Mura-
kami has directed film adaptations of some of his
novels. In 19 97, T i m e magazine named him one of
11 people who would revolutionize Japan. n
