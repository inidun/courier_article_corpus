MLASH, a town on the
Sea, in northern
Iran, has long been a centre for traffic
in artefacts of inestimable archaeolog¬
ical value plundered from sites in the
highlands of the Elborz mountains.
Objects in pottery and bronze, silver
and gold, stealthily excavated and
taken to Amlash, have found ready
buyers among antique dealers, and
have later been resold in Teheran,
Iran's capital, and abroad. This illegal
trading in cultural treasures has been
going on for so long and has reached
such proportions that merchandise of
this kind is now called "Amlash."
Iran's archaeological authorities,
anxious to put a stop to this illegal and
harmful traffic, decided that a neces¬
sary first step would be to carry out a
thorough archaeloglcal survey. As
part of a survey of the entire country,
work was begun late in 1961 in the
Rahmatabad of Rudbar area of the
province of Gilan. We chose this
area because we knew it was one of
great potential archaeological wealth,

Institute of Archaeology, University of
Teheran. He has written a comprehensive
account of the excavations at Marlik, "A
Preliminary Report on Marlik Excavations.

(text in Persian and English), which has
been published jointly by the Iranian Ar¬
chaeological Service and the Institute of
Archaeology, University of Iran.
but about which little was definitely
known. It was thus that we brought
to light historical remains of the long-
forgotten Kingdom of Marlik, dating
back over 3,000 years.
After several weeks, during which
we investigated many ancient mounds
and dug test trenches in those which
did not have sufficient surface remains
for identification, we entered the Gohar
Rud Valley, a rich green land of rice
paddies and wheat fields, dotted with
groves of olive and wild pomegranate
trees. There, on a barren, rocky hill¬
side called Marlik tepe (or Cheragh-Ali
tepe, after its last owner) we dug ano¬
ther test trench, the twelfth of our
survey.
The trench yielded, among other
objects, two small bronze figurines of
cows, two cylinder seals and fourteen
gold buttons. A thorough excavation
of the tepe was started and gradually
we came to realize that what appeared
to be simply a natural hill was a burial
ground containing a fabulous treasure
the royal cemetery of Marlik.
In all 53 tombs were uncovered, dug
into the crest of Marlik tepe by a
people who had inhabited the sur¬
rounding territory for several hundred
years during the late second and
early first millenium B.C. These tombs
constituted the only archaeological
layer on the hill. Nothing lay above
or below except for a few miscella¬
neous objects near the surface.

KINGDOM
The people who built these tombs
simply dug a hole, cleared the earth
away from the bedrock and construct¬
ed the tomb walls of broken stone and
mud mortar, incorporating the bedrock
wherever possible. Any spaces left
outside the walls were filled with dirt
and rubble. After the body had been
placed in the tomb with the accompany¬
ing funerary objects, it was covered
with a brownish-red earth different
from the natural soil of the mound.
Yellowish stones, again different from
the natural stone of the site, were
placed irregularly over the burial
chamber after it was filled.
Thus, when we reached such a heap
of stone, we knew a tomb lay beneath,
and when we struck the brownish-red
earth, the funerary objects were close
at hand.
A bewildering variety of objects had
been placed in these roughly construct¬
ed tombs from simple domestic uten¬
sils to elaborate ceremonial vessels.
There were also decorative and ritual
figurines, bronze weapons, personal
jewellery, pottery of all kinds, pieces
of textiles, cylinder and stamp seals,
toys and gaming pieces, small models
of various tools, and beautifully decor¬
ated bronze, silver and gold bowls.
The pottery at Marlik ranges from,
utilitarian objects to decorative vessels.
Either red or gray and unpainted, it is
sometimes burnished. Pots were

Several objects mounted on wheels, which may have been children's toys,
were discovered at Marlik. Below, group figurine in polished,
burnished red pottery depicts a charioteer, naked with a huge sword at his waist,
standing between a pair of horses, the whole mounted on four wheels.

A LOST KINGDOM (Continued)
Animal grace and vigour caught in clay
often decorated with impressed de¬
signs around the neck, shoulder or
handle. One beautifully proportioned
vase reproduces the graceful curve
of a crane's head and neck, a bird still
seen in the region. A motif based on
the wild pomegranate is common.
The pottery animal figurines have a
modern air because of their simple
abstract shapes, and in addition they
were functional, being for the most
part hollow with the muzzles formed
into a spout. Animals predominate,
but there is also a charioteer, naked
with a hugh sword at his waist, who
stands between a team of horses, the
whole mounted on four wheels.
Several other objects on wheels may
have been children's toys.
The pottery figurines representing
human beings are notably cruder than
the animal figurines, having flattened
and distorted faces.
Animals were also depicted in
bronze, but in greater numbers are
the many weapons fashioned from this
metal spears, daggers, arrowheads,
swords and maceheads. Among the
replicas of tools and equipment are
three models of hump-backed oxen
with yoke and plough.
The variety and artistry of the jewel¬
lery and decorative objects is extra¬
ordinary. A beautiful gold bracelet
has spiral butterfly beads and a pome¬
granate pendant. Among the pen¬
dants is a cage decorated with gran¬
ulation, a double-headed eagle and
a disk decorated with an abstract
design.
The most magnificent of the objects
found at Marlik are the gold ritual
vessels masterpieces of the gold¬
smith's art. One small gold cup de¬
picts mountain goats at rest with their
legs tucked under their bodies in the
Scythian fashion. On two small gold
bowls, decorated with eagles and
rams, the heads of the creatures pro¬
ject from the body of the bowl in full
relief, one of the special techniques
perfected by the Marlik goldsmiths.
Unicorns, griffons and winged bulls
are repeated motifs all ancient sym
bols of the Middle East, and developed
in a distinctive fashion by the master
artists of Marlik.
On one tall gold beaker the life
story of a mountain goat is portrayed.
Four rows of decorations, in which the
same motif is repeated around the
body of the beaker, show a young kid
being suckled by its mother, a young
goat standing on its hind legs and
eating from the Tree of Life, wild boars
apparently the enemy of the goat
and finally the carcass of the goat from
which two large vultures are plucking
the entrails.
A magnificent gold bowl, which we
have called "The Marlik Bowl", is
decorated with two pairs of winged
bulls standing on each side of the tree
of life. Their bodies are in profile and
their heads in full relief, projecting out¬
ward from the body of the bowl almost
two centimetres. The power and
strength of the winged bull is beauti¬
fully expressed here in figurines full
of vitality and life. This bowl is decor¬
ated on the bottom with a rosette, as
are most of the Marlik gold bowls.
Here the rosette represents the sun
surrounded by the leaves of the Tree
of Life.
We still have much to learn about
the Marlik people who they were,
where they came from, where they
went after the destruction of their
kingdom. It is apparent that Marlik
was the royal cemetery of a people
who controlled extensive areas of
northern and northwestern Iran 3,000
years ago. Their art clearly influenc¬
ed much vaster areas. The period of
the Marlik kingdom seems to begin
toward the end of the traditional
Mitannian art period and to end before
the formation of the New Assyrian and
Median powers. The influence of the
Marlik artists on Urartian, New Assy¬
rian, Median and Achaemenid art was
extensive and long lasting.
It seems probable that the Marlik
people and their culture played a direct
and major role in the formative stages
of the later empires of the Medes and
the Achaemenids.
