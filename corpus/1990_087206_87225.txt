The World Heritage Convention:
a new idea takes shape
44
I he "Convention concerning the
Protection of the World Cultural
and Natural Heritage" or World
Heritage Convention is a legal in¬
strument through which states
voluntarily commit themselves to
protect monuments and sites within
their territory that are recognized
to be of such outstanding value
that safeguarding them concerns
humanity as a whole. States parties
to the Convention also undertake
to respect the heritage of universal
value located on the territory of
other states and to make a financial
contribution towards safeguarding
this heritage in countries which
lack the means to do so.
One hundred and twelve
states are already parties to the
Convention.
1960, a decisive year
In the 1960s, there was a danger
that the monuments of Nubia
would be permanently submerged
beneath the waters of the Nile
following the construction of the
Aswan High Dam. The international
community became aware that the
disappearance of these monuments
would be an irreparable loss, not
only for Egypt and the Sudan, but
for humanity as a whole. It was dear
that the considerable resources re¬
quired to save the monuments
were beyond the means of the two
countries concerned. The idea of a
common heritageand of a com¬
mon responsibility to safeguard
ittook shape. On 8 March 1 960,
Mr. René Maheu, the Director-
General of Unesco, launched an
international appeal and some $30
million were eventually collected to
save the Nubian monuments.
Around this time more and
more voices were being raised in
defence of the environment and
for the protection of natural sites.
This movement, which has grown
constantly since then, has fostered
an awareness of the need to
respect the riches of nature which
are indissociable from the past and
future of humanity.
The World Heritage Conven¬
tion is a result of the meeting of
these two trends. By affirming that
the works of man and the works
of nature belong to a single
heritage, the Convention was a
profoundly original document
when ¡t was adopted by Unesco's
General Conference in 1972.
An inventory
of the world heritage
The idea was to identify the cultural
and natural properties within each
country whose protection would
be a matter of concern to the
international community as a
whole. The text of the Conven¬
tion describes these treasures as
properties of outstanding universal
value from the point of view of
art or history, science or natural
beauty.
States parties to the Conven¬
tion draw up an inventory of
properties which they consider to
fall within these categories and
then nominate them for inclusion
on the World Heritage List. The
World Heritage Committee, an in¬
tergovernmental committee com¬
prising representatives of twenty-
one states parties to the Conven¬
tion elected on a rota basis, studies
these nominations in the light of
detailed reports prepared by two
non-governmental organizations,
the International Council of Monu¬
ments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the
International Union for Conserva¬
tion of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN). The number of
dossiers studied each year is con¬
siderable, but only a handful of
properties are inscribed on the
World Heritage List.
The List currently comprises
322 properties located in 69 coun¬
tries. It is an attempt to create a
world inventory which will be as
comprehensive, representative and
coherent as possible.
The criteria for selection
The cultural monuments and sites
chosen should:
constitute a unique achievement
(the Fort and Shalamar Gardens,
Pakistan; the Château of Cham-
bord, France);
have exercised considerable in¬
fluence at a certain period (the
historic centre of Florence, Italy);
provide evidence of a civilization
which has disappeared (the Royal
Palaces of Abomey, Benin; Machu
Picchu, Peru);
illustrate a significant historical
period (Abu Mena, Egypt; the
historic centre of Salvador de Ba¬
hía, Brazil);
constitute an outstanding exam¬
ple of a traditional way of life (the
M'Zab Valley, Algeria; the village
of Holloko, Hungary);
be associated with ideas or be¬
liefs of universal significance (the
sacred city of Kandy, Sri Lanka; In¬
dependence Hall, United States).
Natural heritage properties
should:
illustrate a stage in the Earth's
evolution (the Galapagos Islands,
Ecuador);
represent ongoing geological
processes (the Hawaii Volcanoes,
United States; Los Glaciares,
Argentina);
constitute remarkable natural

formations or areas of exceptional
natural beauty (Kilimanjaro National
Park, United Republic of Tanzania;
Cape Girolata and Scandola Nature
Reserve in Corsica, France);
contain the natural habitats of
endangered species (Garamba Na¬
tional Park, Zaire; Wood Buffalo
National Park, Canada).
The properties inscribed on
the List very often meet several of
these criteria. Some of them are of
outstanding cultural and natural
value.
Threats
to the world heritage
Some of the problems facing the
world heritage are associated with
development and changing
lifestyles, demographic pressure on
natural resources, industrialization,
the modernization of urban
centres, or pollution. Others are the
result of neglect or lack of means.
Some sites are endangered by
mass tourism, the facilities created
to cater for tourism, and the cul
tural shocks that they may lead to.
In other cases, natural catastrophes
such as floods, earthquakes or cy¬
clones may cause serious damage.
The number and the gravity of
these problems are growing dra¬
matically and it is no exaggeration
to say that the entire world
heritage is to some extent at risk.
The role
of the Convention
The Convention only applies to
properties inscribed on the World
Heritage List, although the cultural
and natural heritage at large is
threatened. But the international
community primarily wishes to draw
attention to the most representa¬
tive properties and to organize
effective international co-operation
to ensure that they will be pro¬
tected and transmitted to future
generations.
Inscription on the World
Heritage List undeniably confers
new prestige on a property, but at
the same time it creates obligations
