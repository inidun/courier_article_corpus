MILITARY EXPENDITURES
In 1980, 110 dollars for every man,
woman and child on earth
WORLD military expenditure in 1980,
at current prices, amounted to
$500,000 million or approximately
$110 for every man, woman and child on
earth. Per capita military expenditure in the
developed countries taken as a group is an
order of magnitude higher than that in the
developing countries but, because the
disparities in overall income per capita are
even greater, the real burden of these
expenditures is heavier in developing
countries.
The global military effort represents about
6 per cent of global output, roughly the
same fraction as accounted for by the 340
million people living in Latin America or the
1,300 million people living in Africa and
South Asia.
Global public expenditure for education
has only recently overtaken military expen¬
diture, although if the developing countries
alone are considered the latter is still
predominant. Global public expenditure on
health remains considerably below military
expenditure and, again, the asymmetry is
particularly marked in the developing coun¬
tries as a group. The global arms bill is
roughly equivalent to the value of gross fix¬
ed capital formation in all developing coun¬
tries combined. If one combines regular and
paramilitary forces, there are still far more
people wearing military uniforms world wide
than there are teachers.
Military objectives remain by far the most
important single purpose of the world's
research and development effort, eclipsing,
for example, energy, health, pollution con¬
trol and agriculture combined. Indeed, it ap¬
pears that global military research and
development is at least six times as great as
all research and development performed in
the developing countries.
World military expenditure over the post¬
war, period has moved up in spasms follow¬
ed by a period of relative stability on a new
and higher plateau. In the past, each up¬
ward surge was closely associated with a
war or a major international crisis or the
perception of a serious asymmetry in
strategic nuclear capabilities. The present
upward trend is not associated with a
specific event. Rather, it appears to reflect a
widespread perception that circumstances
in general justify a gradual but sustained in¬
crease in military efforts. In this sense, the
latest upswing may prove more difficult to
reverse since there is no major war that can
be brought to an end, no single crisis that
can be defused and no particular gap in
relative capabilities that can be bridged.
The distribution of global military expen¬
diture remains very uneven although some
notable changes have occurred over the^

owing to differences in coverage and difficulties with currency conversion rates. Stockholm Interna¬

past two decades (see table this page).
. Generally speaking, there has been a signifi¬
cant decline in the NATO/WTO share
although the Member States of these two
military alliances still account for nearly 70
per cent of the total. Significantly, however,
the NATO/WTO share appears to be
stabilizing at this figure.
The offsetting increases have taken place
in virtually all regions of the world but,
again, the picture is a very uneven one.
China and, to a lesser extent, Japan, Israel
and South Africa account for nearly all of
the increases in the share of the other
developed countries. Among the developing
regions, the spectacular pace of militariza¬
tion in the Middle East is clearly reflected.
Even excluding Israel, this region accounts
for nearly one half of total military spending
by the developing countries. The share for
Africa has also increased particularly rapidly
although here, more than in any other
developing region, the trend has been in¬
fluenced by the emergence of new nations.
Other factors have been a succession of

wars over the past decade and an intensify¬
ing confrontation between the Black African
States and South Africa. While these
various qualifications are important, the
central fact remains that the distribution of
world military expenditure has been chang¬
ing in a quite systematic manner over the
past twenty-five years. In all the major
regions of the world, the average rate of
growth of military expenditure has at least
equalled, and, in most cases exceeded, that
of NATO and WTO combined.
Bearing in mind that governments in all
countries (particularly, perhaps, developing
countries), bear a major responsibility for
providing the basic prerequisites for
economic activity, these percentages are
significantly large. By 1977, the situation
had improved markedly compared to 1968,
but it is worth pointing out that the effects
of relatively greater diversion of government
resources to the military in the past are still
being felt today, in terms of education,
health, housing, transportation networks
and so on.
