Study of Brazilian
ethnic groups will
help Unesco to
fight race prejudice
THE history of European coloniza-tion in South Americ  is full of
countless tales of bloodshed.
Brazil is no exception. It has been
the scene of bitter fighting between
different ethnical groups which some-
times ended in appalling massacres.
Yet this hostility never assumed any
permanent, collective form. Brazil is
one of the few countries which has
never known those systems of legal
oppression practised by ruling whites
over the slave masses and known as
the"Black Laws". The abolition of
slavery, which created such grave so-
cial problems in the United States,
was effected in Brazil without inci-
dent. Racial prejudice, cause of
bitter conflict in so many parts of the
earth, is so slight that it is frequently
confused with class prejudice.
What is the reason for this ? It is
difficult to find a satisfactory answer.
Unesco is making a study of ethnic
groups in Brazil as part of its general
campaign against race prejudice,
which is such a serious threat to world
peace. At the last General Conference
at Florence a resolution was passed
to make researches into Brazilian
anthropology, sociology and social
psychology for the purpose of discov-
ering the reasons for this historical
development.
There is much more than scientific
interest in this undertaking. The
results which can be anticipated from
such a wide enquiry will probably give
precise details of the origin of racial
prejudice. Then it will be possible to
attack this problem at its source and
endeavour to eradicate conditions
favourable to its development.
