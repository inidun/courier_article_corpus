Science reigns tri u m p h a n t . N e ver has it been so powerful and influ e n t i a l . It has
conquered diseases which have decimated whole populat i o n s. It has abolished exhaus-
ting physical labour and wearisome repetitive tasks. It has vanquished distance and
pushed back the frontiers of our knowledge of the infinitely large and the infinitely small,
in both the inanimate and the living world.
In short, it has acquired the ability to shape our lives, to change life itself. But it has
also increased its capacity to destroy life.The strength of an army can rest on the number
and determ i n ation of its combatants but it is also, and chiefly, based on the technologi c a l
sophistication of their weaponry.The bombing of Iraq,and now of Serbia, are the latest
examples.
Yet science is wave ri n g . For the first time since the Enlightenment, the way science can
be used is being challenged.The link between scientific progress and social progress is we a-
kening and signs of obscurantism are appeari n g . Hiroshima sounded the alarm .Then the
c risis of the env i r o n m e n t ,t riggered by the dominant mode of deve l o p m e n t ,t u rned ques-
tioning of science into a worldwide issue.This form of development is inseparable from
a frantic and indiscriminate quest for technological innovation.Finally, advances in bio-
technology, which harbour many grave dangers for human dignity, are often too closely
bound up with the selfish interests of their promoters.
No one blames science for not knowing eve ry t h i n g . No one criticizes it because it has
not yet found a vaccine against AIDS or reached a conclusion about the theory of the Big
B a n g . It has never been claimed of science, as it has of history, t h at it has come to an end.
It must keep on tirelessly probing the enduring mysteries of life.
But science can no longer avoid—and nor can we—the basic question of what and who
it is for. In other wo r d s , are the we l fare and interests of the public being served by the pri o-
rities of researchers , the thrust of their wo r k , the ways in which they are organized, the fun-
ding they receive , and the circulation of their findings? Or are scientists looking mainly in
the direction of high-spending consumers at the expense of long-term basic research?
Because of the gr owing “ p ri vat i z at i o n ” of research, are we not tending to overlook essen-
tial and universal human needs which cannot immediately be met?
Those who are excluded from this new “ s c i e n t i fic powe r ” must make their voices heard.
For example, the inhabitants of the 600,000 villages which have no electricity or the wo r l d ’s
two billion people without access to drinking water have the right to ask science to find
solutions adapted to their ve ry meagre resources. Humanity also has the right to ask science
to gi ve pri o rity to research into processes of global disruption and ways of coping with them.
W h at ’s more, all citizens have the right to ask science to further our understanding of the
mechanisms of inequality and exclusion which are gradually undermining peace and demo-
cracy.
To move towards such a new contract between science and society, UNESCO and the
I n t e rn ational Council for Science (IC S U) are inviting scientists, p ri vate firm s ,g ove rn m e n t s
and other stakeholders to attend a conference which will be held in Budapest at the end
of June. One major purpose of this meeting will be to see that the benefits of science go
p ri m a rily to all those who have hitherto been unreached. Their conditions will only
improve if they have access to the mighty power of science. n
