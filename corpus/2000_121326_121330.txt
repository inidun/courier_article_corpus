JORGE WAGENSBERG
SPANISHPHYSICISTAND DIRECTOR OFTHE
LA CAIXA FOUNDATION SCIENCE MUSEUM IN BARCELONA
ome time ago I got into the habit of
leaving my office to eavesdrop on visitors
in every nook and cranny of the La Caixa
Foundation Science Museum that I run in
B a r c e l o n a .A lot of what they say proves
very interesting, and excellent food for
thought about what a modern science
museum should aim to be.
O n c e,I was hot on the heels of a young
father and his son of about seven. Th e y
paused in front of a mimosa pudica p l a n t
whose leaves recoil when you touch them.
Father:Did you see that?
Boy:What? What’s happening? Hey!
But is it real or not?
Father:It’s real.Don’t you see?
I lingered behind them as they
approached a model of the Amazon that
compresses a day’s life in the rainforest
into the space of 10 minutes, i n c l u d i n g
an electrically-generated storm, t o r r e n t i a l
rain and a rainbow. In the middle of the
s h o w, the entranced boy looked up to his
father and asked once again:“ D a d , is this
real or not?”To which his father replied:
“It isn’t real. . . Watch carefully!”
A few minutes later,at an underwater
archaeology exhibit with a giant aquarium
featuring a sunken ship and huge moray
fish swimming between the furniture in
the captain’s cabin, I heard another
exchange:
Boy:They’re real,aren’t they?
Father:Of course.You can see that.
Boy:And the furniture?
Fa t h e r : H m m . I don’t know. I think
some of it is.
The boy’s metaphysical obsession—
about whether things are real or not,
about the difference between experience
and theory, between a replica and “the
actual thing”—was much stronger than
his father’s.U n w i t t i n g l y, this young visitor
reopened a critical debate in our museum
over when to use a real-life object,when

Hands on: in this museum,
touching is the rule

to use a replica and whether the two can
be combined.
In any case it’s clear what a museum
must not do:namely boil down its exhibits
to excerpts from a book whose crammed
pages can be read by the long-suffering
visitors as they walk down a hallway into
rooms full of  scale models for
demonstrations and videos and
computers that look like shopfronts of
electrical stores. One of the most
elementary mistakes made by today’s
museums is to forget that the absolute
priority is to be real.
Just as classes, conferences and
seminars are based mainly on the spoken
word, cinema and television on images
and books and magazines on the written
word, museums and exhibitions should
focus on the real object or event.For it is
the prospect of encountering reality that
draws people to museums.
In recent years, science museums have
been at the vanguard in terms of changing
their collections, methods and
engagement with the public. Our slogan
these days is “please touch.” The old
concept of the display case has been
replaced by that of experience, and the
academic label has changed into a more
literary one. Above all, the former
highbrow attitude has been overtaken
by an effort to involve all five human
senses.
A careful mixture of
touch, feelings and thought
Another thing I’ve learnt on my
strolls around the museum is that we still
have a long way to go before youngsters
feel comfortable there. I recently came
across a little girl,no more than six years
old, throwing large stones at a wooden
open-air kiosk used in summertime as
an ice-cream shop. It was winter and the
kiosk was closed. I reached her just as
she was about to throw another stone.
As soon as she saw me,she dropped it and
looked down shamefacedly. I stood there
silently for a moment before she looked
u p, gazed at the kiosk, then turned to me
and asked:“Is that yours?”
To get our young visitors to treat
things in the museum with care, they have
to feel they have a stake in them.Th o u g h
it is not easy,one way is to try to stimulate
their senses. In a science museum, t h e
most effective stimuli are a careful
mixture of touch,feelings and thought.
L e t ’s take a few examples. Once I
quietly shadowed a boy of about 10 into
the museum’s big vivarium, which had
an exhibit called “Invisible Stillness.”At
first he saw nothing. But behind the glass
and amid dry leaves, earth and roots, l i v e d
three dozen stick-insects (E x t e t o s o m a
t i a r a t u m) . The boy was puzzled and
looked around,clearly annoyed.He must
have thought it was a joke or that the
exhibit was being repaired.
Then he spotted a notice saying:“ Th e r e
are 30 big insects in here.” With an
incredulous look, he seemed to be
wondering how so many insects could be
invisible in such a small space. Then he
saw them—one. . .t w o. . .t h r e e.“ H e y,now I
get it! There they are,” I heard him say as I
watched his face light up. His eyes had
been looking at the insects, but his brain
h a d n ’t seen them. That is emotional
i n t e r a c t i o n . The boy, like many other
v i s i t o r s, was enthralled by everything he
saw after that.
Next to the vivarium is a window in
which you can see a mass of scattered
dots with no discernible pattern. If the
visitor touches a lever, some of the dots
arrange themselves into the shape of an
a n i m a l . This is an example of genuine
manual interactivity:move the lever and
the animal appears; release it and the
creature disappears before your eyes.
It is a small trick that arouses the
imagination and makes the point that
many hunted animals stay absolutely still
when a predator is terrifyingly close to
t h e m . Applied in daily life (why do we
wave to attract the attention of a waiter
who pretends not to see us?), it explains
what mental interactivity means, a n d
allows the visitor to make comparisons
and even reinterpret previous experiences.
The main job of a modern museum
should be to go beyond preserving
h e r i t a g e, i n f o r m i n g, training and even
t e a c h i n g, and to generate this kind of
excitement through objects and real
p h e n o m e n a . People can then physically
experience the feelings of the scientist,
who is not seeking either good or evil but
simply trying, like anyone else, to come up
with as much knowledge as he or she can
about the world in an effort to make
h u m a n i t y ’s cosmic solitude bearable.
Th a t ’s why scientists do experiments—
they are endeavouring to converse with
n a t u r e.A museum should strive to make
visitors plunge like divers into the
s c i e n t i s t ’s quest.
For the best ideas,
tune into the young
Based on my experience as a museum
director and eavesdropper, I think we
should pay close attention to what
children say, because we might learn
something from youngsters who are
learning themselves. Our museum is for
people of all ages or education. But the
youngest visitors have what turn out to be
certain very good ideas.So we must tune
into their thoughts, like those of two boys
and their mother as they were coming
out of our large weather exhibition. O n e
boy was about 10 and the other about
five and had to run to keep up. The 10-
year-old seemed annoyed.
B oy, 1 0 : Mum! Mum! W h a t ’s in the
Amazon?
M o t h e r : O K , we’ll go and see. B u t
maybe you’ll be disappointed.
And then from somewhere behind me,
a little voice.
Boy, 5:Mum?
Mother: Yes dear?
Boy, 5:What’s disappointed? ■
