Hundreds of thousands of persons, mostly
belonging to hunting and fishing com¬
munities, are periodically made homeless
by heavy flooding of the Rio Parana. Many
are unable to return to their traditional way
of life on the banks of the river and are
sheltered "provisionally" in deplorable con¬
ditions. The project envisages "a solution
to this urgent problem, which will enable
flood victims to return to their localities and
work in a better organized, collective
fashion" based on a form of accommoda¬
tion which exploits the benefits of modern
technology yet also conserves the essential
features of the traditional structure. Built on
piles for protection against the floods, the
dwellings will be provided with modern
equipment such as biogas production and
storage facilities, windmills and charcoal
ovens. They will be constructed using local¬
ly available materials such as wood, straw,
osier rods and sand.

The setting for the project is Polesie
("cleared forest land"), the low-lying
marshland covering almost one-third of the
territory of the Byelorussian SSR. "The ob¬
jective was to create an agro-industrial
ecological structure harmoniously incor¬
porating dwelling, production and
maintenance units. The complex is equip¬
ped with an autonomous energy system
functioning on the basis of solar, wind and
hydraulic power and energy from bio¬
synthesis. The traditional Byelorussian
wooden peasant dwelling, the khata, was
taken as the prototype of the housing unit.
The project features industrial building
materials using industrial and agricultural
wastes... Each housing unit in the complex
has a vast terrace."

The aim of the project is to adapt the
grassroots rural community to present and
future changes in the construction of a
socialist society in the social, technical,
economic and cultural spheres... As a result
of these changes, "the differences bet¬
ween town and country will have been to a
large degree abolished. The countryman
will be a technician, a professional man or a
highly qualified worker. He will have full ac¬
cess to the entire cultural system and will
participate in social, political, cultural and
recreational activities." The project en¬
visages communities of from 2,000 to
5,000 persons, thus countering any trend
towards rampant urbanization. The
technology must be simple and adapted to
construction by the users themselves.
Locally available materials will be widely
employed. The urban structure will be
dynamic and capable of adapting to chang¬
ing needs. Facilities will include a biogas
plant, a wind-powered generator, a solar
energy unit, and a market garden to provide
for the needs of the community.

Project Aquapole ¡s a "megastructure for a
city of the sea". This mobile floating unit is
both a tool for exploiting the wealth of the
oceans and an autonomous city for 1 0,000
persons and their families created in accor¬
dance with the imperatives of the environ¬
ment. Aquapole's activities include
aquaculture, shell-fish cultivation, the ex¬
ploitation of metal nodules and hydro¬
carbons, the desalination of sea water,
petrochemistry, metallurgy and research.
The tubular structure consists of eight dou¬
ble pyramids, with activities on three levels:
at, above, and below sea level. In the upper
part of each of seven pyramids is a living
area for some 3,000 persons, divided into
"villages" with services, shopping and
leisure facilities. Solar energy panels are in¬
tegrated into the housing structures. There
is a three-tier transport system: elevators
and mobile platforms providing access to
the "villages" are linked to secondary axes
served by the main Aquapole transport net¬
work (aerotrains, heliports etc.). In order to
resist the salinity of the marine environ¬
ment, carbon fibres, optical fibres, syn¬
thetic resins and other synthetic materials
are widely used.

A development model for fishing villages on
Serui Bay, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. Most of
the members of these struggling maritime
communities live in a subsistence economy
and they are considered as marginal groups
to be relocated or persuaded to take jobs on
land. Clusters of structures built on piles in¬
corporate living units, sea-farming and
hatchery areas, a vocational school,
market-place, administrative and co¬
operative buildings. "Obviously, for the
Seruians the face of the future will not take
the shape of... megastructures designed
for the social and economic setting of
developed countries. And more important,
any progress made in the expression of the
physical environment (architecture) will on¬
ly be a small part of multi-dimensional com¬
munity development. Therefore in the
model development scheme proposed the
architectural expression could always be
changed from the physical configuration
designed for Serui Bay to a configuration for
a location with a different social and
economic setting."

"Suburban Green Community" is based on
the exchange between rural and urban
communities, harmony with the natural en¬
vironment, and the harnessing of advanced
technology. The long main structure is a
combined housing, training institute and
agricultural factory block. Farmers' dwell¬
ings are located on each side^of a "com¬
munity corridor" on the ground floor of the
three-storey building. Other buildings
house mink, chicken and earthworm farms.
Circular ponds at left of main building are
for growing water hyacinth and green algae
(chlorella). Fields and orchards surround the
community buildings. Energy conservation
is carried out by the use of solar and wind
power energy, production of methane from
wastes and biomass. The river (right) and
reservoir (top right) provide recreational
space, habitat, for wild life, and protect
against flooding. City dwellers can par¬
ticipate in work of the experimental farm on
weekends and vacations. Farmers sell
surplus products at a Sunday market.

The "modular rural dwelling" project envi¬
sages the reorganization of Mexico's scat¬
tered rural settlements while preserving the
traditional character of life in the country¬
side. It proposes the creation of cells of
from sixteen to twenty dwelling units, each
housing one family. The cellular conception
is based on the typical Mexican neighbour¬
hood in which dwellings are disposed
around a central patio. The modular cells
are designed in the form of windmill sails,
with separate access for people and ani¬
mals. At the centre of each cell is a nucleus
of sanitary facilities which will exploit natu¬
ral phenomena such as solar energy, wind
power, and rain. Groups of cells will form
barrios (quarters). The creation of a co¬
operative system will enable the modular
cells to be constructed cheaply.

A project for the development of Jenta
Adamu, a neighbourhood on the periphery
of the city of Jos. "It is officially designated
a slum mainly because it sprang up spon¬
taneously from the spilled urban growth of
Jos and identifies more with traditional
growth patterns than any predetermined
planning processes." The majority of the
people belong to the Hausa and Birom
ethnic groups, and the planning scheme
originates in the traditional Hausa concept
according to which the community has two
connected foci: in the past the market and
the palace, in this case the socio-economic
focus (community centre, etc.) and the
educational focus (vocational training cen¬
tre, recreation field, etc.) connected by a
pedestrian mall. Housing (for a population
of 2,736 persons) consists of clusters of
adobe brick dwellings built around the cikin
gida, a multi-purpose internal courtyard.

A project for a community of forty former
nomad families living on the shores of Lake
Issyk Kul in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist
Republic. "The sedentarization of the
Kirghiz nomads of Soviet Central Asia has
brought many changes to the way of life of
family and clan, to traditional forms of
leisure and communication. Nevertheless,
the tradition of living in families of three
generations is still dominant in the Kirghiz
house... The plan of this complex of forty
dwellings obeys the principles whereby the
Kirghiz nomad camp is organized, with the
yurts (skin tents) disposed in a horse-shoe
shape... On the other hand the traditional
sedentary village of central Asia was the
prototype for the use of different levels.
The 'carpet' of dwellings which follows the
folds of the relief is crossed by three
covered streets, in which there are shops,
services and a tea-house."

The project for the reconstruction of a
lakeside village specializing in flower-
growing near Hanoi takes into account
traditional experience and exploits new
hothouse techniques and geothermal
energy. The plan provides for combinations
of residential units, with a garden for each
family, a flower market. "Each apartment
will... serve the purpose of housing and
flower production... The ground floor will
be airy, the interior will communicate with
the garden outside. Collapsible bamboo or
wickerwork partitions will separate these
two areas during the cold season. The
ground floor will be a place of contact with
the cultural, social and economic environ¬
ment, a place for rest and recreation and
seedbeds... Salon and bedrooms will be on
the first floor... The space between the roof
and the first floor ceiling will be arranged for
use as a 'greenhouse' for fragile flowers
and the treatment of seedlings."
