SCIENCE.
TECHNOLOGY,
MAN
AND SOCIETY
NO one today can doubt that
science has acquired a politi¬
cal dimension. It stems from
the power that knowledge confers
upon the individuals, groups and
countries which possess it.
It is a characteristic feature of
today's world that some nations have
an infinitely greater share than others
in the activities which contribute to
the advance of knowledge. Modern
science is the product of the work of
a relatively small number of teams of
scientists in a limited number of
countries.
The vast majority of research pro¬
jects (95 per cent) are still confined
to the 25 most developed countries.
In the most powerful of these coun¬
tries, the greatest resources for scien¬
tific research have been allocated, in
the first place, to military projects or
to large-scale programmes which
combine the quest for prestige with
the pursuit of industrial power (nu¬
clear energy, space programmes) and,
in the second place, to economic ob¬
jectives (computer science, electro¬
nics, aeronautics).
Lagging behind in science and
technology, the developing
world is increasingly dependent
on the industrialized countries.
The transfer of technology has
proved both inadequate and
ill-adapted to local needs.
Unesco will spare no effort to
solve this major problem
through the promotion of
scientific education in
developing countries, through
help in preparing science
policies and through research
into the relations between
science and society. Opposite

These countries generally possess
between 100 and 300 scientists and
engineers for every 1 0,000 of their
inhabitants, together with a develo¬
ped industrial sector, a diversified
economy and a high rate of urban
development.
At the other end of the scale, where
the size of resources devoted to
science and scientific development is
concerned, are some 30 or so of the
world's least developed countries.
In these countries, whose economies
are more often than not predominant¬
ly agricultural, there are rarely more
than a few hundred scientists and
engineers for every million inhabi¬
tants.
Illiteracy is still rife and there is
relatively little demand for science.
For these countries the road to deve¬
lopment necessarily lies through the
application of the discoveries of
scientists in other countries.
The developing countries are at a
similar disadvantage where the edu¬
cation and training of scientists and
engineers are concerned. The ave¬
rage number of science degrees per
100,000 population in 1970 was
37 for North America and 13 for Eu¬
rope, but only 3 for the Arab States,
2 for Asia (including Japan), 1.4 for
Latin America and 0.2 for Africa.
THE industrialized countries asa
whole are estimated to pos¬
sess 90 per cent of the world's
scientists and engineers (i.e. ten
times as many as the developing
countries). It might take as long
as a century to redress this imbalance.
In consequence, the existing body of
scientific knowledge is in some
measure irrelevant to the problems
facing the modern world.
This being so, the application of
science and technology for the
benefit of man and society calls for
action on two fronts:
existing knowledge must be applied
to the solution of present-day pro¬
blems in agriculture, industry, com¬
munications and the other sectors of
economic life; the major difficulty
encountered here concerns the "trans¬
fer" of knowledge;
the necessary capacities must be
developed to enable the developing
countries eventually to take part in
the world-wide progress of science
and to cope with their own problems
as equal partners of the most advan¬
ced countries.
The fact that the developing coun¬
tries lag behind in scientific and tech¬
nological development has contribu¬
ted to their increasing dependence on
the industrialized countries.
This issue immediately leads to
another: how can existing technology
be transferred and how may alterna¬
tive technologies be developed out¬
side the mainstream of current tech
nological trends in industrialized
countries?
There are limits to the transfer of
technology. In the developing coun¬
tries, economic and social conditions
will often call for the creation of
technologies whose characteristics
(labour-intensiveness, energy require¬
ments, use of raw materials) differ
radically from those of existing tech¬
nologies. In practical terms, this
amounts to the development of alter¬
native technologies rather than adap¬
tation.
ATTEMPTS through aid pro¬
grammes and through sales
by multinational corporations
to provide developing countries with
similar or identical technologies so
that they can follow in the footsteps
of the industrialized countries have,
to say the least, not been entirely
successful. The widening techno¬
logy gap and the dependency resulting
from such attempts have led to greater
disappointment on the part of all
concerned.
This is not to say that the increas¬
ing availability of vaccines and phar¬
maceutical products, miracle seeds
and efficient synthetic fertilizers, and
the increased capacities for the disco¬
very and exploitation of natural
resources, have had no impact on
the developing countries; but at the
same time they have been penalized
by continuing injustices in the inter¬
national economic system, coupled
with their inability to choose and
master their own technologies.
It would be advisable, in the first
place, to select priority areas of
scientific activity or research which
would have a positive impact on the
global effort to improve the transfer
and adaptation of technology. Spe¬
cial emphasis should be placed on
the development of analytical tools
necessary for the planning and eva¬
luating of transferred or alternative
technologies.
Unesco's action will be primarily
concerned with the following mat¬
ters:
the evaluation of trends in science
and technology as they affect society;
the identification of the cultural and
moral problems posed by progress in
existing scientific disciplines;
the study of those human aspects
of science and technology which are
of particular concern to the develop¬
ing countries.
Education, and higher scientific
and technological education in parti¬
cular, is a first priority. It is essen¬
tial to concentrate the slender
resources available on a small number
of carefully selected key problems in
fields which are most vital to medium-
term developmentland and water
management, agriculture, cheap
forms of energyand rigorous selec
tion is the basis of scientific policy¬
making in the developing countries.
Such reasoning has led Unesco to
concentrate on the promotion of
endogenous scientific development
which, in most of the developing
countries, remains a more distant
prospect.
To this end, a general four-point
strategy has been adopted:
to promote science education for
everyone;
to assist in the training of speciali¬
zed staff and in the establishment
and operation of institutions concer¬
ned with higher education, research
and the provision of scientific and
technological services;
to encourage the formulation of
scientific and technological develop¬
ment policies;
to foster a better understanding of
the impact of scientific and technolo¬
gical progress on society.
WHAT is required in many
countries is a thorough¬
going reform of teaching
programmes and methods. This
should usually be accompanied by
an increase in the time devoted to
science and technology in primary
and secondary schools, so that pupils
are provided with a sound basis for
further studies in a particular branch
of science or technology.
In the developing countries, science
and technology students will, in the
course of their careers, have to as¬
sume direct or indirect responsibilities
in the scientific and technological
development of their countries. It
will thus be equally important to equip
them to understand how science and
society are interrelated.
A major obstacle to the extension
of technological education in many
developing countries has been the
resistance of pupils and parents to
manual and technical training, which
is considered as inferior to more aca¬
demic studies.
Moreover, in many countries, tech¬
nological education for girls has fallen
short of that offered to boys. Some
Member States are now overcoming
this resistance, partly through care¬
fully prepared campaigns by the mass
media in favour of legislation to make
technological education compulsory.
