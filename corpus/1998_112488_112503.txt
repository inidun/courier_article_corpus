‘T he deepest parts of the ocean are unk-
n own to us.W h at goes on in these remote
abysses? W h at creatures live beneath the
s u r face of the wat e rs? W h at is the constitution of
these beings? We can hardly imagi n e .
. . . if Nature still keeps secrets . . . nothing is more
admissible than to suppose the existence . . . o f
new species or even new genera.”
These prophetic words were uttered by
Professor A r o n n a x , the earnest marine biologi s t
who is the narr ator of Jules Ve rn e ’s novel 2 0 , 0 0 0
Leagues Under the Sea, published in 1870.
More than a century after Jules Ve rne pen-
ned these wo r d s , one of Nat u r e ’s deepest secrets
was revealed to lat t e r - d ay submari n e rs. In the
valley of a mountain range in the eastern Pa c i fic
O c e a n , where the heat of volcanism inexorably
d ri ves the separation of two oceanic plat e s , g e o-
l o gists discovered animals wo rt hy of nothing less
than science fic t i o n . I myself have seen the thic-
kets of giant tubewo rms with haemoglobin-red
plumes emerging from white tubes, ye l l ow mus-
sels huddled in gr e at piles over cracks in basalt,
clams with thick chalky shells lying exposed on
the sea flo o r. All of this and more, t h riving in the
n oxious chemical soup of what has come to be
k n own as one of the most productive habitats on
our planet and the environment where some
scientists think life itself may have ori gi n at e d :
deep-sea hot spri n g s.
Life in the abyss
New species and new genera are the least of the
d i s c ove ries at deep-sea hot spri n g s , though they
abound and already make up a lengthy list of
more than 400 novel Latin binomials. A whole
new style of living was revealed as biologi s t s
rushed to understand how a giant tubewo rm ,
taller than me and as thick around as my wri s t ,
A multitude of strange creatures inhabit parts of the
sea floor where, some scientists believe, life itself
may have originated.

Deep-sea hot springs are peopled with cre a t u res worthy of science fic t i o n .

could be sustained in an environment as scarce
in food as the deep sea. B a c t e ri a , both free-living
and symbiotic within host animal tissues, are the
k e y. Animals at deep-sea hot springs are sustai-
ned by microscopic bacteria that gr ow on simple
chemicals dissolved in the venting flu i d s.
D i s c ove ry of seafloor hy d r o t h e rmal vents and
their attendant communities stands out as a
spectacular example of how poorly we have
k n own our ocean. Scientists working in the soft-
sediments of the bat hyal deep sea tell another
c a u t i o n a ry tale wo rt hy of recollection should we
e ver become too sanguine about our know l e d g e
of marine biodive rs i t y. Working with sieve s ,
microscopes and tremendous pat i e n c e ,b i o l o gi s t s
h ave identified nearly a thousand species of
wo rm s , s n a i l s , and crustaceans in a small vo l u m e
of cold mud from deep wat e rs off the east coast
of North A m e ri c a . Our deep seas are repositori e s
of biodive rs i t y, with some estimates of the total
number of global deep-sea species reaching into
the millions, ri valing the celebrated dive rsity of
tropical rain forests. V i rtually nothing is know n
about their biology, their role in the ecosystem or
their potential useful at t ri bu t e s.
Dwindling divers i t y
Deep-sea work requires high-tech tools for
a c c e s s , but anyone with an old pair of canva s
shoes can explore the intertidal zone of coastal
wetlands and beaches. M a rine plants thri ve in
these sunlit wat e rs : r e d , b r own and green algae
c r e ate three-dimensional forests within which
l i ve incredible numbers of molluscs, c ru s t a c e a n s
and wo rm s. There are rich and dive rse littoral
h a b i t at s : rocky shores and sandy beaches, m a n-
gr ove swamps and salt mars h e s , coral reefs and
mud flat s , s h a l l ow lagoons and deeper bay s.
These are the habitats patently at risk from a
plethora of anthropogenic effects including pol-
l u t i o n , d e ve l o p m e n t , ove r - fis h i n g, t r aw l i n g, a n d
global wa rm i n g . As coastal habitats are compro-
mised or disappear altogether, whole suites of
species disappear as we l l .
Not long ago I read about the dwindling
p o p u l ations of horseshoe crabs that gat h e r
ritually on beaches at full moon on a spring tide
in June to mate and lay eggs. I used to haunt the
beaches where horseshoe crabs landed, a lway s
astounded by their fantastic numbers. T h e s e
animals are relicts of the Mesozoic, a time when
d i n o s a u rs ruled the eart h , but their long history
n e ver prepared them for the demanding econo-
mics of catfood and fertilizer production in this
m o d e rn wo r l d . Two decades ago they we r e
u n c o u n t a b l e . Are they to go the way of the pas-
senger pigeon, slaughtered to extinction in the
nineteenth century? 
For a va riety of reasons, h e a l t hy marine habi-

S n o r kel in sunny, warm tropical waters over the vibrant rainbows of coral heads and reef fis h e s
and your head goes dizzy with the magic of diversity. Over 90,000 species living in coral
reefs have been described,and the total number is at least one million.Why is the figure so
high? The microtopography of a growing reef is complex, creating abundant surfaces for
attachment and hiding places to accommodate small invertebrates and habitats for fis h .
Reefs are typically insular oceanic habitats. One can envision an always expanding species
pool as a reef is successfully invaded by the chance arrival of drifting larvae of a species
from some remote location.The inva d e r, isolated from its parent population,gradually adjusts
to its new environment and develops into a daughter species.Where there was once one spe-
cies, now there are two. Each one has some likelihood of invading other reefs and in such a
way diversity of coral reefs blossoms exponentially over geologic time.
This diversity is now threatened by the flash of dynamite of the myopic fisherman who
destroys the habitat that sustains the resource he seeks to gather. Coral reefs are victims of
many other unsound practices, with the result that as much as 10 per cent of them have
already been degraded beyond recovery. If unchecke d , loss of coral reef habitat will pro-
gress at a rate of 10 per cent per decade. Global warming is a particularly insidious danger.
Corals lose their algal symbionts when the seawater temperature rises just a degree or two
above normal,a phenomenon known as bleaching, which often results in death of the coral.
Disease hits harder when corals are stressed by warmer than usual temperatures. A sick
coral reef is dizzying only in the staggering loss of biodiversity. C. L.V. D. ■

s p e c i e s , and biodive rsity per se may not alway s
be paramount. R at h e r , as in terr e s t rial habitat s ,
it is loss of dive rsity that generates concern .
Because some marine habitats may nat u r a l l y
h ave relat i vely low dive rsity but a high abu n d a n-
ce of animals, loss of a single species can gr e at l y
modify the ecology of a system. A case in point
is Chesapeake Bay, the largest tidal estuary on
the east coast of the United Stat e s. Oyster reefs
once dominated the Chesapeake’s shallow
wat e rs.These animals feed by fil t e ring seawat e r ,
and not so long ago the equivalent of the entire
volume of water in the Bay was filtered within a
we e k . Oyster populations have declined due to
e x p l o i t ation and disease and what took one we e k
to filter now takes one ye a r. The effect cascades
through the water column as the part i c u l ate load
i n c r e a s e s , light penetration decreases, and a host
of other consequences transpire.
In terr e s t rial ecosystems, loss of chari s m at i c
mammals or the last remnants of virgin forest
results in a dramatic visual sensation as well as a
n u m e rical debit on the tally of species or habi-
t at s. Loss of marine dive rsity takes place out-of-
s i g h t , i nvisible beneath the wave s , yet the toll on
the planetary legacy we leave to our children is
the same.Wo rs e , r e m e d i ation of habitat damage
or restoration where habitat has been lost is a
difficult task at best in shallow wat e rs and all bu t
i n c o n c e i vable in deep wat e rs of bat hyal and
abyssal env i r o n m e n t s. ■
