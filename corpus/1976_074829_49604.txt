ANTIQUITY'S GREAT
REPORTER HISTORIAN
AMONG THE SCYTHIANS
modern archaeology
confirms the stories
of Herodotus
by
Yaroslav V. Domansky
AROUND the middle of the 5th
century B.C., a young man
named Herodotus left his
native city of Halicarnassus in Asia
Minor, and began the travels that
were to take him from the western
Mediterranean to Mesopotamia.
Vast distances lay ahead of him,
separating many different lands and
peoples : through the Aegean to the
islands of the Archipelago and the
towns of the Peloponnesus; east¬
wards to Babylon; westwards as far
as Sicily; southwards to Egypt and
the banks of the Nile; northwards
through the Balkan peninsula to
Thrace. And one day Herodotus
arrived in Olbia, one of the most
northerly of the Greek city-colonies,
on the shores of the Black Sea.
Founded a century-and-a-half
earlier on the estuary of the river
Bug, Olbia was thriving, and fully
living up to its name ("olbia", in
Greek, meant "prosperous").
But although he was usually
curious about everything, neither
Olbia's present nor its past parti¬
cularly interested the young man
from Halicarnassus as he stood on
the city walls. He was looking
outwards, over the vast plain which
stretched away into the distance.
Somewhere out there, beyond
the horizon, lived the Scythians,
the people who, after an exhausting
war, had finally humiliated Darius,
king of the Persians.
The Greeks themselves had resis-i
ted the Persian invaders for many!
YAROSLAV VITAL'EVICH DOMANSKY,
a leading Soviet historian and archaeologist,
is a senior member of the staff of the Her¬
mitage Museum in Leningrad. An authority
on the antiquities of the region north of
the Black Sea, about which he has written
a number of works, he has excavated many
sites along the lower reaches of the river Bug
in the Ukraine.

L years, and it was Herodotus' ambi-'
' tion to write the history of that war.
Obviously, the Scythians must come
into the story.
There were a great number of
people in Olbia who had spent their
lives in the steppes, who had tra¬
velled the length and breadth of the
lands north of the Black Sea, and
who had many a tale to tell about
the world of the Scythians, so dif¬
ferent from that of the Greeks.
Herodotus was an attentive listen¬
er, and the contrasts with the way
of life which he had known at home
fascinated him. He wanted to
write about all things unusual,
leaving nothing out, and so he col¬
lected all these talesincluding the
unlikely onesfrom his Greek and
Scythian informants, one of whom,
a certain Tymnes, had actually been
a man of confidence of the Scythian
king Ariapeithes.
What Herodotus saw for himself
in Olbia, and what he heard, formed
a colourful patchwork picture of the
Scythian world and Scythian ways,
in which the past and the present,
the important and the insignificant,
the possible and the highly improb¬
able jostled for space, and which
he would incorporate in the pages
of his History.
Thus, the first record of its kind,
by the man who has been called the
"Father of History", would contain
an account of one of the first peoples
identifiable by name to have inhabi¬
ted what is now part of the Soviet
Union.
Herodotus was in Olbia in or
about the year 450 B.C. Five years
later, he was reading parts of his
manuscript to the citizens of Athens,
who were so impressed that they
offered him a grant of money to
continue with his project.
Let us listen with them now to
the words of the narrator: "Their land
is level, well-watered, and abound¬
ing in pasture"... "Having neither
cities nor forts, and carrying their
dwellings with them wherever they
go; accustomed, moreover, one and
all of them, to shoot from horse¬
back; and living not by husbandry
but their cattle, their waggons the
only homes that they possess..."
Thus Herodotus describes the
nomadic life of the Scythians,
roaming in hordes over the "vastness
of the great plain" between the
Danube and the Don, women and
children in the waggons and the men
on horseback, ready at any moment
to defend their families and their
herds with their spears and with the
bows and arrows which they handled
with such skill.
Being "entirely bare of trees", the
land of the Scythians was "utterly
barren of firewood." They stuffed
their meat, haggis-wise, into the
stomach of the animal, and cooked
it in cauldrons over a fire made
with the animal's own bones. In
A PLEDGE
OF BROTHERHOOD
Like many pieces of Scythian
jewellery, this gold
ornamental plaque for
clothing reveals a custom
among the nomads of the
steppes. It shows two
Scythians making a pledge
of everlasting brotherhood in
a ritual also described by
Herodotus. They kneel nose
to nose, their profiles joined
together, and hold a single
horn-shaped vessel in which
they have mingled drops of
their blood with wine.
The symbolism whereby two
become one is also reflected
in the conception of the
plaque: when the two
profiles are viewed in
close-up (see enlarged detail,
opposite page) .they form a
single face. This technique
of "split representation" is
relatively common in
Scythian animal art (see
colour photo page 28) but
is rarely found applied to
the human face. A
remarkable example of the
Scythian goldsmiths'
virtuosity, this 4th century
B.C. plaque is less than
4 cms. high.

Mountain goats and rams frisking between flowers and palmettes
bordered by two twisted cords of gold (below) evoke the pastoral
life of nomad herdsmen who roamed the steppes 2,500 years ago in
an endless quest for water and pastureland. Detail shown here is
the central motif of a gold pectoral (breast ornament) unearthed
in 1868 in a burial crypt of the Great Bliznitsa tomb near the Sea
of Azov. This masterpiece was considered a matchless example of
Scythian jewellery until 1971, when an even more splendid
princely pectoral of similar style was discovered (see page 19).
this way comments Herodotus, "the
ox is made to boil himself, and other
victims also do the like."
Drinkers of mare's milk, the Scy¬
thians were also copious quarters of
imported wine, which they never
diluted with water. "Serve us in
Scythian style !" called the Greeks,
when the drink was flowing merrily.
True children of the steppe, the
Scythians were born herdsmen, al¬
though like their ancestors they also
hunted wild animals. Herodotus
was mainly concerned with the no¬
mads, but he also noted that some
Scythians were "engaged in hus¬
bandry".
"Abundantly provided with the
most important necessaries", they
were favoured with a land watered
by many rivers, including the Borys-
thenes (the Dnieper) which, he tells
us, "has upon its banks the loveliest
and most excellent pasturage for
cattle; it contains abundance of the
most delicious fish; its water is most
pleasant to the taste; its stream is
limpid... the richest harvests spring
up along its course."
This sounds idyllic, but the life of
the Scythians was in reality a hard
one. Their manners and customs
reflected a cruel age, and the "Father
of History" has left a detailed des¬
cription of the Scythians at war.
As pitiless with their enemies as
they were loyal to their friends, they
set great store by ritual oath-taking.
Parties to a treaty shed some of their
blood into a bowl filled with wine, and
then plunged into the mixture "a
sword, some arrows, a battle-axe and
a spear, all the while repeating
prayers", after which the allies each
drank from the bowl.
Herodotus noted with particular in¬
terest that the Scythians were not
much given to the use of "¡mages,
altars or temples", but he listed their
gods, identifying them with their
Greek equivalents and mentioning
their role in the order of things.
Tahiti, whom the Greeks knew as
Hestia, protected the household. Pa-
paeus (Zeus) was"very properly, in
my judgement", comments Herodo¬
tus charge of celestial affairs,
while his wife Apia dealt with more
earthly matters. The Greek god
Heracles, known to the Scythians as
Targitaus, was believed to have been
the first man ever to live in their
country, the father of their people.
The Scythians sacrificed domestic
animals, and horses in particular, to
all these gods, as well as to Ares,
the god of war, the only divinity in
whose honour they erected altars, in
the form of huge piles of brushwood
topped with antique iron swords.
The sacrificial victims included not
only cattle and horses, but also one
out of every hundred of their prisoners
of war.
Scythia had "an abundance of |
soothsayers, who foretell the future I
11

i by means of bundles of willow
; wands". When the king fell sick, it
was their task to identify the traitor
whose false oath by the king's hearth
had caused the illness, and who was
promptly beheaded. In doubtful
cases, the king sought a second opi¬
nion; if the accused man was ac¬
quitted, the unfortunate soothsayers
lost their own heads.
The Scythians were convinced
that there was a life beyond the grave,
picturing it as a continuation of what
had gone before. Herodotus gives
us a detailed description of the royal
funerals, when elaborate prepara-,
tions were made to ensure that the
king lacked nothing in his after-life.
After digging a deep, rectangular
grave, the Scythians placed the em¬
balmed body of their king on a
waggon, and took it on a royal pro¬
gress from tribe to tribe. The
mourners mutilated their own ears,
cropped their hair, lacerated their
arms, forehead and nose, and thrust
an arrow through their left hands.
Returning to the grave, they lower¬
ed the king into the ground on a
litter, which they surrounded with
a fence of spears. Then they built a
ceiling of beams over the tomb, and
thatched it with a roof of twigs.
In the open space around the king,
they buried one of his concubines,
first killing her by strangling, "together
with« his cup-bearer, his cook, his
groom, his lackey, his messenger,
some of his horses, firstlings of all
his other possessions, and some
golden cups..." Finally, says Hero¬
dotus, "they set to work, and raise
a vast mound over the grave, all of
them vying with each other and seek¬
ing to make it as tall as possible."
But this was not the end of the
affair. A year later, fifty of the late
king's attendants were strangled and
impaled on the backs of fifty slaught¬
ered horses. Firmly attached to
stakes and arranged in a circle, this
ghostly guard of honour was left to
protect the burial mound.
Every Scythian was bound to res¬
pect his gods, and betrayal was
severely punished. In Olbia, Herodo¬
tus heard the cautionary tale of Scy-
las, son and heir of the Scythian king
Ariapeithes, who "disliked the Scythie
mode of life, and was attached, by
his up-bringing, to the manners of the
Greeks." Scylas had installed one of
his wives, "who was a native of the
place", in a large house in Olbia, and
when he visited the city, as he did
frequently, he dressed in Greek clothes
and followed the Greek customs and
rites, even joining in the Bacchanalian
revels, which the Scythians consid¬
ered offensive.
Seeing him the worse for wear,
some kinsmen of Scylas told tales at
home, and the ensuing indignation
led to a revolt against Scylas, who
was obliged to decamp to Thrace.
But he soon fell into the hands of
his successor on the throne, and was
beheaded without further delay.
"Thus rigidly do the Scythians main¬
tain their own customs," wrote Hero¬
dotus, "and thus severely do they
punish such as adopt foreign usages."
The Scythians fascinated Herodo¬
tus in many ways, but there was one
matter in particular, to which he
frequently referred, in which they had,
he considered, "shown themselves
wiser than any nation upon the face
of the earth... The one thing of
which I speak, is the contrivance
whereby they make it impossible for
the enemy who invades them to
escape destruction, while they them¬
selves are entirely out of his reach,
unless it please them to engage with
him."
Herodotus' tale of the Scythians
contains a wealth of historical, geo¬
graphical and ethnographical material.
His colourful account of the campaign
of Darius is embellished with digres¬
sions which are irrelevant to the
main theme, but which reveal the
extent to which posterity is indebted
to the "Father or History" for its
knowledge of the ancient world and,
more particularly, of the structure of
Scythian society.
Herodotus could obviously not
have been expected to foresee that
this subject would be of such interest
to future historians, and to give the
matter more than a passing glance,
but his casual approach hasit must
be admittedplaced his successors
in a very difficult position.
So much of what he wrote about
the Scythians remains open to diffe¬
rent interpretations, and controversy
continues to bedevil any attempt by
modern scholars to understand his
writings and to relate them to other
sources.
According to Herodotus, the struc¬
ture of Scythian society was tribal,
and it is clear that ancient tribal links
could, on occasion, provoke united
action by all the kinsmen. But this
bond had lost its earlier, all-embracing
significance, and the patriarchal fa¬
mily had become the basic social unit.
The customs of the Scythians reveal
a male-dominated society, under the
authority of the chief, with women
in a position of dependence.
Scythian society was not egalita¬
rian, but on the contrary, relatively
class-ridden. Although most Scy¬
thians were free men, irrespective of
personal power or wealth, there was
also a slave class, whose existence
and activities are described by Hero¬
dotus, as well as a property-owning
and aristocratic minority, composed
of the leaders of the richest families,
the royal entourage and the warrior
chieftains, all under the supreme
authority of the king.
Scythia was ruled by tribal alliances.
At the time of the Persian invasion
under Darius, at the end of the sixth
century B.C., it was divided into
three kingdoms, under the overall
command of Idanthyrsus who had vir¬
tually unlimited power, whether in the
conduct of military affairs, the distri-

WHAT THE WELL-DRESSED HORSEMAN WORE
How Scythian horsemen of 2,500 years ago
dressed and the kind of equipment they used
is now known to the last detail (drawing right).
This knowledge came with the discovery of a
remarkably preserved set of accoutrements buried
with a 5th-century-B. C. warrior in a Ukraine
tomb (below). The conical helmet complete
with earflaps, the leather back-piece covered
with metal scales, the sword-belt of bronze
plaques and the breast-plate had all survived.
Some of this equipment is depicted on a stone
stele of the same period (left) as well as a long
sword, a sheathed dagger, a rhyton (horn-shaped
drinking cup) and a gorytus (quiver for bow and
arrows). The warrior's outfit also included
leg armour laced to trousers which were tucked
into flat-soled felt boots.

bution of booty or the destiny of
individual Scythians, who could be
pressed into service at will and whose
disobedience was punishable by
death.
We have already seen the fate
reserved for those who betrayed their
oath at the hearth of the king. In
The technical mastery with which
the Scythians embellished even their
everyday objects is seen in their
cauldrons, knives, perfume braziers,
lamps, amphoras, jars, stools and a
variety of other elegantly wrought
utensils. The three objects shown
at left are about 2,500 years old :
1 Bronze lamp to hold six wicks
(11 cms. high).
2 Bronze mirror (18 cms. diameter)
with fluted handle topped by a
panther.
3 Bronze meat-strainer or sieve
used for lifting boiling meat from
the pot. A wooden stick was
inserted in the hollow handle.
anticipation of the king's own demise,
a substantial stock of sacrificial
material, including slaves as well as
horses and precious objects, was kept
handy.
The Scythian king was above all a
military leader. War, as a source of
prosperity, enabling the aristocrats to
acquire riches and wealth, was a
regular activity, and the life of the
Scythians, who were constantly' in
arms, was permeated with martial
arts, traditions and customs.
This mass of warriors was capable
of bending the sovereign's will. A
primitive form of democracy from
earlier times survived, for example, in
the assemblies which united all the
men-at-arms in discussion of matters
of importance and whichas was pro¬
bably the case of the unfortunate
Scylascould decide the fate of the
king himself.
Scythian society was full of contra¬
dictions. With the exception of one
or two excursions into the past, Hero¬
dotus was writing about events in the
middle of the fifth century B.C., a
chapter of Scythian history which was
to be followed by many others. It
was a period of change in all respects,
but the old ways of life had not been
entirely abandoned, and would leave
their imprint on all that came after¬
wards.
Altogether, the Scythians occupied
the stage of history for some thousand
years, about as long as Ancient Rome,
living through a series of experiences
which left no trace behind them.
But the little that we do know reflects
a dramatic destiny, full of variety and
conflict.
There is no doubt that in the
seventh century B.C., the Scythians
were the scourge of the East. In
612 B.C., they had joined in sacking
the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. Three
hundred years later they were to
suffer defeat at the hands of Philip of
Macedón.
In the sixth century, they had
confirmed their independence by
routing Darius and his Persian army;
at the end of the second century, the
Greeks were to rout them in battle
after battle in the Crimea.
At the dawn of their history, they
had mounted almost unbelievable
raids as far as Egypt; as the sun set,
they would be confined to a small
area of the Crimean steppe, the
horses on which they had ridden so
proudly throughout their history ex¬
changed for the tools of farmers. w
Originally rejecting everything that f
13

reflected Hellas, they were finally to
mingle with the crowds in the Greek
trading-cities of the Black Sea coast.
Warriors who had smashed every¬
thing that lay in their path, they
would value artistic creation, and
become outstanding craftsmen them¬
selves.
And when, in the third century
A.D., Scythia and the ancient Scy¬
thians had ceased to exist, the once-
terrible name remained, and was
adopted by those who occupied their
former territories, including the early
Slavs.
Silence fell over the Scythians for
fifteen hundred years. And then, at
the turn of the eighteenth-nineteenth
centuries, the past became the future,
as their monuments began to speak.
All manner of Scythian relics awaited
the spades of the archaeologists; the
time was rapidly approaching when'
the truth of Herodotus' tales could be
put to the test.
The study of Scythian antiquities
began soon after the lands north of
the Black Sea became Russian terri¬
tory. Since then, a great number of
monuments have been investigated,
among the most important of which
are the famous burial mounds, or
kurgans.
Many of these mounds marked the
last resting-place of chieftains or
kings, and proved to be complex
constructions in the form of crypts or
catacombs, containing a great variety
of objects. Some of them had been
plundered long ago, but what the
robbers had rejected was of the great¬
est interest to the archaeologists.
The inventory of everyday objects
is a long one, and includes bronze
cauldrons and earthenware utensils;
gold rings, bracelets, necklaces, pen¬
dants and ornaments for the head;
costume jewellery in metalware
(usually stitched to the garment);
swords, battle-axes, spears, arrows,
quivers, scabbards and armour; har¬
ness for horses and ritual articles.
Various materials were used in
their production, ranging from gold,
bronze and clay to iron, silver, bone
and stone. The objects themselves
came from a variety of sources, some
of them being of local manufacture
and others imported from abroad
honestly purchased, looted by raiding-
parties or obtained through trade
with other tribes.
Excavation on the whole confirmed
Herodotus' account of life in the
steppes, at least as far as its material
aspects were concerned, and justified
his claim to be considered as the
founder of historical science.
With one or two inaccuracies or
omissions, what the archaeologists
discovered in the royal tombs matches
his descriptions of the funerals of
kings. The bronze cauldrons which
they unearthed correspond to those in
which, according to Herodotus, the
Scythians boiled their meat, and if
14
they found quantities of wood-ash,
ashes from the hearths of at least one
settlement indicate that bones did on
occasion replace firewood.
In 1830, a new page was turned in
the history of the study of Scythian
antiquities when excavations began
at the Kul Oba kurgan near Kerch, on
the straits between the Black Sea
and the Sea of Azov. Among the
many objects brought to light was a
unique collection of articles which
have attracted the attention of scho¬
lars ever since.
Under the mound was a stone
crypt containing three bodies, buried
in the fourth century B.C., together
with a quantity of gold artifacts dec¬
orated in a manner never seen before
and depicting scenes in the life of a
warrior people whose clothes, head¬
gear and general appearance in no
way resembled those of the Greeks.
A solid gold torque was decorated
with figures of horsemen, and gold
ornaments sewn to the clothing of the
dead people were embossed with
figures of bowmen firing arrows,
riders brandishing spears and soldiers
with quivers and bow-cases attached
to their belts.
Who were the warriors portrayed
in these scenes? The immediate
opinion of the archaeologists who had
unearthed these objects was correct.
They were Scythians, drawn, as it
were, "from life".
For the first time, scholars whose
only acquaintance with an ancient
people had come through the pages
of Herodotus and other writers found
themselves face-to-face with Scy¬
thian realities. What did they look
like ? How did they arm themselves?
What did they wear? How did they
behave? The answers were there,
before their very eyes.
Kul Oba was only the first in a
series of burial mounds to yield metal
objects portraying the Scythians. In
1 862, excavations began in the extra¬
ordinary Chertomlyk kurgan near the
Dnieper, which produced a gold and
silver vase decorated with a frieze of
sculptured human figures and horses
similar to those found on objects from
Kul Oba, and which is generally consi¬
dered to depict the horse-breeders
and horse-breakers of the Scythian
steppes.
In 1912-1913, the neighbouring
Solokha kurgan, which was also a
royal tomb, produced further objects
decorated with scenes from Scythian
life, including a golden comb portray¬
ing Scythian warriors in battle.
We have mentioned only a few of
the most significant discoveries made
in the late nineteenth and early-
twentieth centuries and illustrating
the "Scythian theme" in ancient art.
The most immediate impression
which they leave is one of artistic and
technical perfection. The golden
comb referred to above, for example,
is composed of a number of finely-

detailed elements cast separately, sol¬
dered together in a composite article,
and then carefully polished.
The battle scene, which is depicted
in relief, is treated with meticulous
attention to detail: the decorations on
the weapons and clothing of the
warriors, and even the curls of their
hair and beards, are engraved with
extreme accuracy.
Similar virtuosity is to be found in
the execution of the Chertomlyk vase,
the frieze in particular. All the fig¬
urines, of men and horses were
moulded separately and only arranged
in a composition when they were
soldered to the vessel.
The chief interest of the objects pro¬
duced by the jewellers of the northern
Black Sea coast lies in the themes
which they represent, and in the light
which they throw on this or that
aspect of Scythian life.
Finds from the burial mounds
teach us much about Scythian wea¬
pons, clothes and ornaments, but the
picture isso to speakunfinished
and lacking in depth. On the other
hand, the scenes in relief portrayed by
the metal-workers show the objects
found by archaeologists actually
48
being used, and thus provide a fasci¬
nating glimpse of the Scythians as
they really were, at different moments
of their existence.
There can be no doubt that all
these objects had their origins in an
ancient culture and, more specifically,
jn Greek craftsmanship. In style and
tradition, they were classically Greek,
and they could only have been pro¬
duced in a context of Hellenic notions
and capacities, which conditioned all
stages of their production. Even
their secondary details, such as the
ornamental motifs of palms, acanthus-
plants and wattled designs, were
essentially Greek.
Many of the objects in metalware
were, however, Greek neither in form
nor in function. The spherical vessels
found at Kul Oba closely resemble the
earthenware vessels of the earliest
Scythian culture, and were doubtless
used in religious ceremonies, while
the torques and the plaques used as
ornaments on clothing had Scythian,
and not Greek significance.
Thus, the majority of these articles
were Greek in execution, but Scythian
in form, while the ¡mages with which
they were decorated have for a long
time and almost unanimously been
considered by scholars familiar with
the history of the region north of the
Black Sea to represent the Scythians
themselves.
The Scythians were certainly
warriors, and many images show
them in battle or resting in the middle
of their campaigns. But the artists
also depicted more peaceful times,
and the Chertomlyk vase shows them
engaged in what may well have been
a typical nomad activity, roping and
hobbling their horses.
Hunting scenes were also depicted.
A silver vessel from Solokha shows a
group of Scythian horsemen, accom¬
panied by their dogs, at grips with a
fantastic lion-like creature with horns,
which has seized a horse by the leg.^
One hunter brandishes a spear, ano¬
ther is taking aim with his bow and
arrow, while their two companions,
similarly armed, join in the fray.
Some of the small gold plaques
used as decoration for clothing and
found in the kurgans of Kul Oba,
Solokha and Chertomlyk represent
scenes of a completely different kind,
doubtless related to religious cere¬
monies.

One of them shows what appears
to be a goddess (women rarely figured
in the imagery of the northern Black
Sea metal-workers) seated on a
throne, with a mirror in her hand.
In front of her sits a Scythian drinking
what is probably a magic potion from
a horn-shaped cup.
Other plaques feature a similar
drinking-horn, from which two
kneeling Scythians are drinking simul¬
taneously, in what is generally
believed to be a ritual oath-taking
such as that described by Herodotus.
By no means all the scenes which
decorate the metal objects found in
the Scythian burial mounds can be
so easily interpreted. More than a
few of them probably reflect preoccu¬
pations which lay at a deeper level
than the affairs of everyday life, and
it has been suggested they are ideo¬
logical or mythological in content,
illustrating the epics which nourished
Scythian society (see page 15).
But let us turn again to the outward
appearance of the Scythians, as they
are portrayed in these images. They
have regular features, and frequently
severe expressions, long, shoulder-
length hair andin the majority of
casesbeards and moustaches.
Their double-breasted jackets, or
caftans, are trimmed with what
appears to be fur and embroidered
designs. They wear soft, short
boots, strapped at the ankle, and
pointed, hood-like caps. They are
frequently portrayed bearing arms:
short swords, bows and arrows
carried in a case suspended from their
belts, spears, battle-axes and shields.
In a number of cases, they wear metal
helmets and armour.
The Greek craftsmen responsible
for these portraits were extremely
familiar with their subjects, and this
knovyledge is reflected in the smallest
details of the figures, scenes and
compositions.
All the objects we have mentioned
were produced largely in the fourth
century B.C., when the Scythians
occupied the whole of the area
around the northern coast of the
Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and
when their kings were at the zenith of
their power and wealth.
This was the period when they built
the impressive royal tombs discovered
in the vicinity of the Dnieper rapids.
which have also yielded many
examples of the precious metalware
objects which wealthy Scythians
commissioned from Greek craftsmen,
specifying that they should be execu¬
ted "in the Scythian style".
A final group of metal objects
appears to depict some of the Scy¬
thian divinities encountered in the
pages of Herodotus. Thus, for
example, one gold plaque (a horse's
decorated frontlet or forehead orna¬
ment) from the Tsymbalka kurgan
shows what appears to be the goddess
Apia in the form of a serpent-woman;
while the legendary hero Targitaus
is shown in combat with a monster
on a bronze crest found in the Bliz-
nitsa Slopovskaya kurgan.
The outstanding discoveries which
marked the dawn of Russian archaeo¬
logy were followed by others. In
very recent years, excavations in the
kurgans of the Ukrainian steppes have
yielded jewellery similar to that found
at Kul Oba, Chertomlyk and Solokha.
Will there be more finds? It is hard
to say but it is more than likely that
the earth still hides the key to further
episodes in the history of the ancient
Scythians.
