The future of a nation lies in the hands of the
yo u n g .For Indonesia, t h at is no ove rs t at e m e n t .
In May 1998, it was the students who caught
the wo r l d ’s attention by spearheading the dri ve to
u n s e at the nearly godlike figure of President Suhart o
from his more than thirt y - t wo - year presidency. B u t
after the jubilat i o n , the students woke up to find the
o ri ginal problems still there, with the economy col-
lapsing and politics getting murkier by the day.
“ W h at is the next move? Is this what you wa n t ? ”
a street vendor asks a student activist.Yet without a lar-
ger-than-life common enemy like the Suharto regi m e ,
students have too many wants and too few resources
to continue their move m e n t , in the absence of either
a nationwide organization or a shared agenda.
For the more radical students from the Ja k a rt a
City Fo ru m ,a loose gat h e ring of students from about
100 Ja k a rta unive rs i t i e s , a complete dismissal of the
parliament and gove rnment is in order.They want a
so-called Indonesian Pe o p l e ’s Committee to replace
the establishment and set up elections as soon as pos-
s i b l e .W hy? “Because we don’t trust all of the old ins-
t i t u t i o n s ,” yells a student leader.
Watching divergent desires polarize student lea-
d e rs and interest-led politicians lure student support

to their causes, the more dow n - t o - e a rth students are
r e t r e ating from the political arena, to regroup and
r e t u rn to their classes. “My students are going back
to campus to consolidate while keeping an eye on
the new gove rn m e n t ’s move s ,”s ays Sudart o, rector of
Airlangga Unive rsity in Surabaya .
But this consolidation is far from a reality.“ S p o n-
taneous student unity is close to impossible when
there is no political mainstream,” s ays Ismail, a now -
a p athetic former militant. And while the remaining
activists argue over competing agendas,o r d i n a ry stu-
dents have simpler desires. M a ri j o n o,a student from
Jombang in East Java say s :“ We do not want to be
fooled again, either by the gove rn m e n t , by the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund or by self-acclaimed refor-
m i s t s.”
He and others like him would prefer to see pro-
gress in a field closer to daily life: e d u c at i o n .“ E d u-
c ational improvement should not be ignored. It is
the way to enhance our quality of life,” s ays Dadang
Budiana from the Indonesian Student A s s o c i at i o n
for Intern ational Studies.
Less than 10 per cent of the total national bu d g e t
is allocated to educat i o n . Most state unive rsity stu-
dents come from the middle class, which can afford
the preparation courses for the rigorous national uni-
ve rsity entrance exam.P ri vate unive rsities are expen-
s i ve .L ower-income youths are essentially left out in
the cold, without access to higher educat i o n .“ Po o r
students will always feel inferi o r ,” s ays Budiana.“ To
get a scholars h i p, they must write a letter, a p p r ove d
by the local gove rn m e n t ,s t ating they are ‘ fin a n c i a l l y
i n c a p a b l e ’ .”
L ower tuition fees are a key demand,according to
B u d i a n a .“The gove rnment should slash the military
budget and reallocate funds from superfluous high-tech
d e velopment for the sake of educating the people.”
Z a i n a l , a student from a poor village in East Java ,
c o u l d n ’t agree more.“ Poor guys like me can’t afford
to pay the tuition any m o r e .”But even the rich students
n ow are feeling the cru n c h .The fall of the rupiah has
t ripled the prices of foreign textbooks. “I can’t bu y
books any longer.They are unbelievably expensive ,”
s ays Iwa n , a student from pri vat e l y - run Tri s a k t i
U n i ve rs i t y.
For Indonesia’s politically puzzled and scholasti-
cally troubled students, helping ove rt h r ow the pre-
vious gove rnment now seems a lot easier than for-
ging their nat i o n ’s–and their ow n – f u t u r e . ■
