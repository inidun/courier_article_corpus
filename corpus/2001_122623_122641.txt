Lee Smolin*: Cosmological evolution
“A key issue is understanding the fine-tuning of the universe: how did it
come to be that the parameters that govern elementary particles and their
interactions are tuned and balanced in such a way that a universe of such
variety and complexity arises? The probability that a universe created by
randomly choosing the parameters will contain stars is one chance in
10229.
The universe is improbable, and it is improbable in the sense that it has a
structure which is much more complex than it would be if its laws and
initial conditions were chosen more randomly. Thus we seek a kind of
explanation which is checkable, which is falsifiable, and which is based on
some hypothesis of natural phenomena. Broadly speaking, biology and
natural selection are the most successful examples of a theory that
addresses such questions.
In the case of the universe, this leads to the hypothesis of cosmological
natural selection:in other words, that our elementary particles are the way
we find them because they make the production of black holes, and thus
the production of new “universes,” much more likely.
If it is true that the big bang was not the beginning of the universe but an
event that came from another part of the universe, whether a black hole
or something else with a prior structure, then it’s very possible that
observations over the next few decades will help us—just as by studying
the ripples in water, you can measure the shape of the rock that caused
them.”
