While most people in the United Kingdom
e n j oy an adequate if not high standard of
living, many do not have a decent place
to live—or anywhere at all.
Though suffering from mental illness, G o r d o n
(not his real name) is responsible for looking after
his three-year old daughter. They lived in a damp,
c o l d , ru n - d own rented room riddled with wo o d wo rm .
Their lives changed when the local social serv i c e s
a g e n cy turned for help to Shelter, a British non-
governmental organization that defends the right to
h o u s i n g .The group negotiated with
social services to have Gordon
a l l o c ated a monthly sum and prov i d e d
father and daughter with a better
home.
Shelter estimates that an ave r a g e
of 470 families lose their homes in the
United Kingdom eve ry day, fin d i n g
t h e m s e l ves forced to wander the streets
in search of somewhere to live , if only temporari l y. I n
March 1998, at least one million people were living
in these appalling conditions.
C h ris Holmes, the director of Shelter, the largest
n o n - g ove rnmental organization of its kind in the
country, said it “exists for people facing these kinds
of situat i o n s. In our view, e ve rybody in society is
entitled to enjoy a proper, decent and safe home.”
Since 1996, S h e l t e r has been working to help and
s u p p o rt anyone living in dreadful conditions or on the
streets.
Shelter assists people in distress free of charge
through a network of 52 centres spread out ove r
almost the entire country. It also organizes frequent
campaigns to pressure the authorities into changing
the law and coming up with practical and fin a n c i a l l y
viable solutions. The gr o u p ’s 900 vo l u n t e e rs
p a rt i c i p ate in specific projects, field missions,
information processing and administrative work.
The results are plain to see. Holmes say s ,“ t h r o u g h
our action in 1997, 100,000 families and individuals
were gi ven advice and assistance and, in other cases,
were saved from eviction.” The different centres
p r ovide services ranging from informing people of
their rights to accompanying families when they move
into their new homes.
The organization has a budget of nearly $17
m i l l i o n .The bulk of the funds comes from individual
donations,private companies, schools and religious
gr o u p s. Shelter also raises money by conducting used
clothes drives and runs a network of shops that sells
the gr o u p ’s publications and garments bearing its
logo.
Homelessness undermines the dignity of the
individual, but Shelter points out that it also entails
considerable social and financial costs. On the basis
of statistical evidence, the organization repeat e d l y
s ays that the life expectancy of a pers o n
living on the streets is 42, c o m p a r e d
with the national average of 74 for men
and 79 for women.
Mindful that a roof is not the be-
all and end-all, Shelter is also interested
in people who have homes but live in
poor conditions. C a rri e , a 10-ye a r - o l d
gi r l , l i ves in a cramped studio
a p a rtment with her parents and baby sister. H e r
mother and father purchased the room before Carri e
was born.When they wanted to move to something
b i g g e r , housing prices had increased so much they
could not rent or buy anything else. C a rrie suffers
from serious asthma and has nowhere to play or do her
h o m e wo r k , which is affecting her performance at
s c h o o l .Her mother say s ,“There is just nowhere to put
a ny t h i n g . I am seeing a doctor for stress. I feel
constantly stressed out and that all I want to do is
murder somebody.”
Human tragedies like these inspired Shelter’s
l atest campaign,“Behind Closed Doors ” , which wa s
launched last March.The goal was to highlight the
s e riousness of such situations and raise the authori t i e s ’
awareness,thus encouraging them to treat cases like
C a rri e ’s as pri o ri t i e s.Louise Casey,the deputy director
of Shelter, s ay s , “a house is not a home if it is
dangerous and unhealthy and makes life a misery.
H aving a roof over your head does not mean you have
somewhere decent to live , and it should certainly not
disqualify people from getting help.” n
