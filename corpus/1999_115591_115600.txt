Around $700,000 are being invested eve ry year in
p r o grammes to bring disabled and non-disabled at h-
letes together in the same clubs. Stig Morten is him-
self now a member of an ordinary sports club. S p o rt s
clubs are also receiving money to improve access for
disabled people to arenas which were ori ginally bu i l t
only for the non-disabled.
In some sports such as shooting, disabled and
non-disabled athletes can perform on equal terms if
suitable arrangements are made. In many cases,
according to the association for handicapped at h l e t e s ,
it is only social barriers that keep handicapped and
non-handicapped apart.
“This is going to change, and it is ve ry import a n t
that it should.But I think it may take 10 or 15 years
before all the barri e rs come dow n ,” Stig Mort e n
says.
Another thing that helps to bring barri e rs dow n
and develop gr e ater tolerance, Stig Morten thinks,
is the fact that he trains in the pool with non-disa-
bled children and adults.
Stig Morten Sandvik has achieved success in the
swimming pool, and hopes to continue as a top-leve l
swimmer for a few more ye a rs.But he feels that his gr e a-
test achievement—one that can not be valued in gold,s i l-
ver or bronze—has already been wo n : s e l f - c o n fid e n c e
and the belief that he can do things that people who
d o n ’t have to use a wheelchair take for gr a n t e d . n

“ I t ’s thanks to sport that I’m so independent in
life. Sport has meant everything to me,” says
Stig Morten Sandvik, a 28-year-old Norwe-
gian political science student who trains for 12
hours every week to become a better swimmer.
Stig Morten, who lives at Bodoe, in Nordland
c o u n t y, was born with A rt h r o gryposis multiplex
congenita (AMC), a disease which affects the
muscles. This makes him dependent on a wheel-
c h a i r , although he can also move around using
crutches.
He was six when his mother first took him to the
swimming pool. He took to the water and soon
came to feel that swimming would play a big part in
his life.The gold medals he has won in World Cham-
pionships and the bronze medals he took in the
Paralympics in 1992 and 1996 prove just how
important it became.
But for Stig Mort e n , as for many other disabled
p e rs o n s ,s p o rt has far more to do with managing his
life than with winning pri z e s.“My sporting activity
made me a normal Norwe gian boy. I was able to do
something as well as all my fri e n d s ,” he say s. It also
made him very independent in his daily life.When
he was 16 and about to gr a d u ate from high school,
he chose to live alone. N ow he is moving in with his
girlfriend.
Bringing the barriers down
He is sufficiently independent to be able to
clean his apartment by himself. He cooks and goes
shopping on his own.“The only thing I can’t do is
change light bulbs,” he says.
In Norway most disabled people have their ow n
houses or apart m e n t s , and look after themselve s ,
sometimes with support from personal care assistants.
Ve ry few of them live in special institutions. S t i g
M o rten feels totally integr at e d , and few people eve n
comment that he has a gi r l f riend without a han-
d i c a p. He is also convinced that his sport gi ves him
a self-respect and self-confidence that disabled people
who don’t practice such an activity may lack.
Some 22,000 physically and mentally handi-
capped people are members of Norway ’s associat i o n
for disabled at h l e t e s. In 1996 the Norwe gian sport s
movement decided to make an effort to integrate
sport for disabled people and sport for “normal”
p e o p l e . This is in line with developments in the
rest of a society where disabled people are pro-
vided with facilities such as transport and pers o n a l
assistance to help their social integration.

something quick l y,
