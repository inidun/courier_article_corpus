Early this century, the German
sociologist Georg Simmel (1858-
1918) stated that "In big cities
the individual has a form and
degree offreedom that does not
exist elsewhere". Will this still be true
in six years' time, when it is expected
that halfofhumanitywill be living in
cities? Will cities still be "hot-houses
of civilization" or are they going to
destroy their inhabitants with high
pollution and low quality of life? "In
1900, there were sixteen cities world¬
wide with a population of one mil¬
lion or more," writes François Lapoix,
a specialist in urban ecology. "In 1950
there were seventy-one and today
there are 220, thirty ofwhich have a
population of more than five mil¬
lion." The third millennium will be
the age of the gigantic, sprawling
megacity. lohn Celecia, a specialist in 25

mini im «m future
Unesco's Division of Ecological Sci¬
ences, feels that it is important to
distinguish between the cities of the
industrialized world, whose inhabi¬
tants are in a position to be con¬
cerned about quality of life, and
Third World cities where sheer sur¬
vival is at stake. Nevertheless, all
cities face the same kind of prob¬
lems and issues: population influx,
the use of space, transportation and
public utilities such as water, elec¬
tricity and waste disposal.
When these problems are not
solved the health of city dwellers is
threatened. "Gases and dust are the
two leading causes ofbad air quality
in cities, and their detrimental effects
combine and cumulate," says Claude
Allègre, professor of earth sciences
and department head at the Institut
de Physique du Globe in Paris. "Such
gases as nitric oxide (NO) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur
dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide
(CO), ozone (03), tetraethyl lead,
methane and a variety of other
organic compounds of lesser impor-
26
tance have reached abnormallyhigh
levels in cities." These gases, which
are extremely toxic, can cause serious
illness and irreparable damage in
young children. Unlike gaseous pol¬
lutants, dust generated by burning
coal, industry and vehicles is not
usually the subject ofenvironmental
measures.
Why are New York, San Francisco
and Rome healthier places to live in
than Mexico City, Los Angeles or
Athens? A city's weather is deter¬
mined by its topography (e.g.
whether it is located in a basin or in
mountains), its average tempera¬
ture, and wind conditions. Mexico
City, like Grenoble in France, was
built in a basin. Rising hot air is
blocked by a layer ofcooler air above
that traps heat and pollution. In Los
Angeles, sizzling hot air from the
nearby desert lies motionless over
the city. Athens, which is partially
enclosed by mountains, has no ven¬
tilation that could disperse the
deadly nephos, or "smog". In New
York, San Francisco and Rome wind
disperses pollutants.
At the heart of the problem is the
automobile. In Mexico City, two mil¬
lion cars spew thousands of tons of
carbon monoxide into the air every
day. There are approximately 500
million cars in the world today, 80
per cent of which are privately
owned. In the last twenty years the
total number of vehicles has dou
bled, seriously damaging the air
quality in cities. "We're driving
dinosaurs	 Our cars are made for
the past, not the future. We have to
radically rethink a number of phe¬
nomena that our civilization has
produced, and car traffic tops the
list," says Frederic Vester, a German
biologist who has founded an insti¬
tute for the study ofbiology and the
environment in Munich. The twenty
car manufacturers who dominate
the world's automobile market now
have to take the environment into
account. Among the solutions to the
problem are the catalytic converter,
lead-free gasoline, "diester" fuel
(made with vegetable oil) for diesel
engines, compressed natural gas,
cars that run on solar energy and,
above all, electric cars. But though
the electric car offers an appealing
solution, it has drawbacks high
cost and low performance. About
100 kilos of lead batteries (the best
kind available) are needed to pro¬
duce as much energy as one litre of
gasoline, and after only 80 kilometres
the batteries have to be recharged.
THE PROBLEMS OF WATER AND
WASTE
Water is another big problem. In
Mexico City, drinking water is
increasingly difficult to obtain. Wells
1,500 metres deep have been dug,
and pipelines bring in water from
up to 100 kilometres away. The
poorest inhabitants ofPhnom Penh
in Cambodia and Abidjan in Côte
d'Ivoire have to buywater from street
vendors, who are in many cases
unauthorized. Unclean water can
carry cholera, typhoid, enteritis,
poliomyelitis, hepatitis and a host
ofparasites. Another consequence of

lack of water is lack of sewers. In
Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), an inade
quate sewage system has led to
serious river pollution.
The big cities of the South are
often hit by violent tropical rain¬
storms which wash away uncol¬
lected waste, and their most vulner¬
able inhabitants are people living in
shantytowns built on low-lying
ground that is subject to flooding.
They use sheet metal, palm leaves
and cardboard to build ramshackle
shelters on patches of waste land
where wells are often near latrines.
Figures published by the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) are eloquent. In 1992, 80 per
cent of the population of Addis
Ababa were living in shantytowns or
as squatters, 70 per cent in
Casablanca (Morocco) and almost
as many in Calcutta (India), 60 per
cent in Bogota (Colombia), 39 per
cent in Manila (Philippines) and 20
per cent in Bangkok (Thailand) .
The problem of waste, which is
closely linked to that of water, is
growing worse. "The metropolis is a
gigantic stomach," writes Michel
Giraud. "It consumes a lot and spews
out enormous amounts of waste."
Cairo produces 4,500 tons of refuse
every day, and only two-thirds of
Mexico City's garbage is actually
collected." Huge garbage dumps in
Dakar and Manila have become
polluted settlements for masses of
outcasts.
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
According to the Centre for our
Common Future based in Geneva
(Switzerland), "Informal settlements
and urban slums should be
upgraded to erase the deficit in
urban shelter. All urban areas need
such services as clean water, sanita¬
tion and waste collection, and
higher-income neighbourhoods
should pay the full cost ofproviding
such services."1 Several organiza¬
tions of the United Nations system
are also addressing urban problems.
Unesco's Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) programme, for example,
studies urban ecology and the
ecology of populations. Its primary
objective is to study how social con¬
ditions (the organization and struc¬
ture of a society, its industries, its
transportation, and its buildings)
affect the natural environment and
the quality of human life. Creative
thinking, sharp analyses, and a judi¬
cious comparison of solutions are
all necessary in the effort to rethink
the future of the city.
In 1879 Iules Verne wrote, "Why
don't we use our imagination to the
full and draw the plans for a model
city built on rigorous scientific data?
We would invite all the peoples of
the world to visit this city where life
is good." The question is still as valid
as ever.
