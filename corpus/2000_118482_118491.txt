An ecological disaster area, the shrinking Aral Sea generated a flood of assessment studies but
little follow-up. Humanitarian action is now an urgent priority.

“The health of women of child-
b e a ring age is steadily deteri o r at i n g
because of the bad quality of the dri n-
king water.There are as many pregnancies
as ever but the women either miscarry or
gi ve birth to stillborn or handicapped
b a b i e s.We have one of the highest infa n t
m o rtality rates in the wo r l d ,” s ays the direc-
tor of the mat e rnity hospital on the edge of
the Aral Sea in the port city of A r a l s k , i n
Kazakhstan.
Behind him, pregnant women lie on
r ows of hospital beds. They have been
brought in to ensure that they get clean
food and water for at least the last tri m e s t e r
of their pregnancies.The eyes of one wo m a n

she says, “I have yet to give birth to a live
child and I am frightened.” Similar situa-
tions exist elsewhere in this Central Asian
region.
Man-made
environmental disasters
The wo rsening health and env i r o n-
mental problems of people living in the
Aral Sea basin, which consists of parts of
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turk-
menistan and Uzbekistan, are the direct
consequences of man-made env i r o n m e n t a l
d i s a s t e rs in the region—the shrinking of
the sea and pollution of the rivers which
flow into it.
Experts say the disaster has left behind
a 36,000-sq.km sea bed covered with accu-
m u l ated salts, which the wind carries away
and deposits over thousands of square kilo-
metres of cultivated land. Pesticides and
f e rt i l i z e rs have also found their way into
water and irri g ation channels, p o i s o n i n g
food and drinking water affecting the lives
of about five million people.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991, i n t e rn ational donor agencies
rushed to the Central Asian region to
assess the environmental impact of the
s h rinking of the Aral Sea and to find way s
of restoring it to its ori ginal leve l . N ow,
almost a decade lat e r , after countless stu-
dies and reports have been wri t t e n ,e x p e rt s
s ay that restoration is impossible and
e f f o rts should now focus on avoiding a
h u m a n i t a rian cat a s t r o p h e .
Rescue missions
The Aral Sea,covering an area the size
of Lithuania, s t a rted receding in the
1960s after Soviet state planners diverted
its water sources,the Amu Dar’ya and the
Syr Dar’ya rivers, to irrigate cotton and
other crops.
From 1960 to 1990, the area of irri g a-
ted land in Central Asia increased from 3.5
million hectares to 7.5 million. Cotton pro-
duction soared, making the region the
wo r l d ’s fourth largest producer. But by the
1980s the annual flow of fresh water into
the Aral was barely one-tenth of the 1950
s u p p l y. The salinity level increased, d e s-
t r oying the sea’s flora and fa u n a . T h e
fishing industry suffered; all but two of the
30 species once found in the sea died out.
With no other means of water supply,
the sea started to recede, eventually losing
half of its former area and a third of its
volume. In 1989, it divided into a smaller
northern sea and a larger southern one.
The two main fishing ports, Moynaq in
Uzbekistan and Aralsk in Kazakhstan
were left high and dry, and fishing com-
munities found themselves 100 kilo-
metres or more away from the shore.
Today, drinking water in the region
contains four times more salt per litre
than the limit recommended by the World
Health Organizat i o n . This has caused
increases in kidney disease, diarrhoea and
other serious ailments. Tuberculosis has
reached epidemic proportions. In some
towns there are an estimated 400 cases
out of a population of 100,000.

s ays Antonius Lennarts of the World Bank,
in A l m aty (Kazakhstan).“There have been
lots of donor activity and promises but no
follow-up, and long delays because of the
huge funds involved.The money available
to solve a problem of this magnitude simply
isn’t available.”
In view of the gr avity of the situat i o n ,
the Nobel Prize-winning medical relief orga-
n i z ation Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF),
which is more usually associated with the
wo r l d ’s hot spots, has launched an emer-
g e n cy programme to save the people of Cen-
tral Asia from what it calls in a recent report ,
“possibly the wo r l d ’s gr e atest env i r o n m e n t a l
disaster and human tragedy.”

h ave been calling for help since Soviet times,
but after their countries became indepen-
dent at the end of 1991 their cries became
more urgent than eve r. I n t e rn ational agen-
cies including the World Bank,the United
N ations Development Progr a m m e
( U N D P ) ,U n e s c o,and the European Union
rushed to the region to offer help. I n i t i at i ve s
like the Aral Sea Basin Programme (ASBP),
the Intern ational Aral Sea Rehabilitat i o n
Fund (IFAS),and the Interstate Commis-
sion for Water Co-ordination (ICWC) we r e
launched to assess the problems and find
s o l u t i o n s. The activities they proposed
brought high hopes to the people of the
Aral Basin, who thought their problems
would eventually be solved.
So why after nearly a decade of rescue
missions does the Aral Sea remain on the
c ritical list of world environmental cat a-
strophes? According to expert s , it is a classic
case of too many players entering too late,
with too few resources but in many cases
with a huge stock of vested interests that
are not necessarily consistent with
environmental protection.
The intern ational aid agencies soon
gauged the enormity of the problem and
realized that the funds allotted were not
enough to rectify a disaster of this magnitude.
“Of course people here have been disap-
pointed by the international community,”
little direct humanitarian action in the area.”
MSF has some justific ation for lamenting
t h at so much has been spent in the last eight
ye a rs on talking about the Aral Sea and so
little has actually been done.But why has this
happened? “It could be because the problem
is just so huge and eve ryone wants to help bu t
m a ny agencies just don’t know where to
s t a rt ,” explains Barbara Britton of the United
S t ates A g e n cy for Intern ational Deve l o p-
ment (USAID), the biggest donor agency
i nvo l ve d , in Ta s h k e n t .
There is another major hurdle as well as
lack of funds—lack of co-ordination among
the five Aral basin nations. “They started
competing with each other to get interna-
tional aid rather than co-operating in solving
the problem,” says Professor J. A.Allan, a
water resources specialist at the Unive rs i t y
of London.
In the absence of the kind of federal
authority that existed in Soviet times, the
five states set up the Intern ational Aral Sea
R e h a b i l i t ation Fund (IFAS) in 1993 in
order to co-ordinate water and agri c u l t u r a l
projects. In 1995, their leaders attended a
UN-sponsored meeting in Nukus (Uzbe-
k i s t a n ) , which concluded with a resoun-
ding declaration saying they would co-ope-
r ate to resolve the human and
e nvironmental consequences of the A r a l
Sea cri s i s. B u t , according to Bri t t o n ,d i s t ru s t

between the states continued.
For example, when the Uzbekis were
given the responsibility for water manage-
m e n t , they were accused of producing a
p r o gramme that would irri g ate Uzbekistan
and not other countries.Then the Uzbekis
accused Kazakhstan of draining water away
from its southern neighbour by constru c t i n g
a dam across the northern Aral Sea.
Anatoly Buranov, technical director of
the Executive Committee of IFAS,admits
t h at the states could have done better.“ Pa rt
of the problem is that we were all excited by
independence and after so many years of
enforced togetherness we enjoyed the cen-
t rifugal forces which the collapse of the
S oviet Union allowed us. N ow, h owe ve r ,
we are realizing the importance of co-
operation.”
Ironically, the slow and delayed action
from outsiders and their governments has
had a positive effect on one Aral basin
country. Frustrated by years of unfulfilled
promises, the people of Kazakhstan raised
an astonishing $2.5 million and built them-
s e l ves a sand dam 14 kilometres long and 30
metres wide, c r e ating a lake in the nort h e rn
Aral Sea,close to Aralsk.
Kazakh officials say they also made
e f f o rts to draw less water from the Syr
Dar’ya than in the past and that the dam
contained the increased inflow into the
s m a l l e r ,n o rt h e rn A r a l .As a result, the wat e r
level rose by three metres for the first time
in 30 ye a rs , b ri n ging back gr e e n e ry and
birdlife to the desertified area.
As a result of increased inflow of fresh
water the salinity level in the nort h e rn A r a l
f e l l , reviving the hopes of the fishing
industry. Above all,the dam brought hope
to the people of A r a l s k , “a commodity
which until recently has been as scarce
around here as water,” says Aitbai Kuser-
baliv, the city’s mayor.
U n f o rt u n at e l y, Kuserbaliv explains, t h e
dam keeps breaking as a result of rainfall
and increased inflow into the sea.In 1998,
from three to five kilometres of the dam
were washed away and water flowed into the
s o u t h e rn A r a l . Officials say the project
cannot be sustained unless they get $15
million funding they have asked from the
World Bank to build a permanent stru c t u r e .
“I wrote to them several months ago and
they still have not got back to me,” s ays the
mayor.
With the survival of the reclaimed sea,
the efforts of dozens of dam builders and
the livelihoods of several hundred fis h e rm e n
at stake, the World Bank seems likely to
come up with some funds.“ We have agr e e d
that it is a highly necessary dam and the
money will be fort h c o m i n g,” s ays A n t o n i u s
Lennarts of the World Bank.
Even if the World Bank funds this pro-
ject it will save only the smaller part of the
Aral Sea. To maintain the present wat e r
l e vel of the bigger southern part , at least 20
cubic kilometres of water per year are
r e q u i r e d . Some grandiose schemes have
been proposed,including diverting waters
from Siberian rivers or from the Caspian
Sea, over 2,400 km and 500 km away res-
p e c t i ve l y, projects which could cost up to $8
billion each.The Central Asian countries do
not have the resources to embark on such
costly undertakings.
Another option would be to allow more
water to flow into the Amu Dar’ya river,
which means that agricultural patterns in

the regi o n , especially in Uzbekistan, t h r o u g h
which most of the river flows, would need
to be changed.This proposal could invite
stiff resistance from fa rm e rs in Uzbekistan
who heavily depend on the river for irriga-
t i o n . “It is a ve ry uneasy situation for them.
You cannot stop agri c u l t u r e . People wo u l d
lose their live l i h o o d ,” s ays Prof Ja n o s
Bogardi, senior water resources expert at
UNESCO.
The first priority:
saving people’s lives
There is no doubt that it would take
billions of dollars and decades to change the
a gricultural pat t e rn by introducing new
technology and less water consuming
p l a n t s. It is highly unlikely that Uzbekistan,
the second largest cotton exporter in the
world, would agree to shift from its prime
cash crop.
With the prospects of saving the sea
remote,experts and locals now seem to be
t u rning their attention to relieving the social
disaster. If present conditions persist,then
the southern part of the Aral is likely to
disappear in the next 25 ye a rs.The pri o ri t y
should be saving the lives of the people,
s ays Ve fa Moustafa e v, a UN E S C O wat e r
resources expert.
After a decade of research and assess-

ment report s , the intern ational agencies
h ave now started implementing some of
their projects to help the Aral basin popu-
lation, mainly by providing clean drinking
water and better health care facilities.The
World Bank has financed a project to esta-
blish 25 stations to monitor drinking wat e r
quality across the Central Asian regi o n .
The Bank also plans to fund projects to
i m p r ove agricultural practices which
consume a lot of fresh water.
E x p e rts say that the region may require
an estimated $20 billion for much-needed
d e velopment and environmental activities,
mainly to modernize agri c u l t u r e , to reduce
river pollution and provide clean drinking
wat e r.At present, the cash-strapped Central
Asian countries are in no position to raise
such funds on their own.
But the region is not without hope as fa r
as its natural resources are concern e d .W i t h
their enormous gas and oil reserves the
Central Asian states would be among the
major players in the global power sector in
the coming years. However, it is far from
clear what the consequences of oil and gas
exploitation would be for the Aral Sea.
“There is still lots of hope in the regi o n .
But the countries need to co-ordinate their
efforts,” says Bogardi. n
