This photo, taken near
Geneva on a misty day in
1925, records a meeting
between two great scientists
Marie Curie and Albert
Einste'n during a break
between meetings at the
League of Nations. In 1922
the Council of the League
of Nations unanimously
named Marie Curie as a
member of the Committee on
Intellectual Co-operation.
In this committee she worked
ardently to promote the
development of science
devoted to the service of
man (see text page 16).
THE WOM
by Marguerite Perey
Marguerite Perey, the distinguished
French woman scientist, was a re¬
search student of Marie Curie's and
later collaborated with her for some
years. Here she recalls the feelings
which Marie Curie inspired in all who
worked closely with her, and acknow¬
ledges the debt which her own career
in science owes to her illustrious
teacher. Five years after the death
of her "patronne", Marguerite Perey
herself discovered a new radioactive
substance, francium. Today she is
professor in the Faculty of Science at
the University of Strasbourg, where
she directs the nuclear research
centre (nuclear chemistry).
I N June 1929, as a shy
young student not yet
twenty, I had to face an interview
with Madame Curie, who had asked
the Chemistry School to choose a
new graduate to work with her.
I was shown into a cheerless little
waiting-room, where I was quietly
joined by a lady in black, very pale
and frail-looking, with a chignon of
curly grey hair and thick spectacles.
I at first took her for a secretary, but

AN WE CALLED LA PATRONNE
to my great confusion, I soon realiz¬
ed that I was face to face with
"Madame Curie". We talked for a time,
and I felt I was showing up very badly;
then she said, "I will let you know in
the course of the summer whether the
research fellowship has been granted
or not."
I considered this a most polite way
of dismissing me, and gave an
immense sigh of relief when I crossed
the threshold of the august institution,
for what was, I was convinced, the
first and last time: I had been struck
by the general dreariness and gloom,
and was delighted to think that I had
certainly forfeited any possibility of a
second visit. I went on holiday with
a light heart, until I received a letter
from the Institut du Radium informing
me, to my stupefaction, that the
fellowship had been granted, and I
was to join the Laboratory on
October 1, 1929. Such was the start
of my career in the Curie Laboratory.
Madame Curie herself, the friendly
atmosphere and the fascinating work
so completely won me over that the
few months' research work I expected
to put in stretched to twenty years.
In Paris, I first had to be initiated
into methods of work and scientific
problems of which I was totally
ignorant. The big chemistry room,
facing the redoutable waiting-room of
my first visit, looked full South
towards the garden on the other side.
It became a sort of wonderland for
me, thanks to the help and encou¬
ragement 1 received from all who
guided my first steps in "Radioactivity"
a field which embraced both
chemistry and physics.
Madame Curie loved to have a
happy, young and eager team around
her, although our eagerness might
sometimes break out in slightly noisy,
emphatic or surprising forms.
She loved to mix with us and share
our life. Our favourite meeting-place
was in the passage, facing her office
door, at the foot of the stairs. We
talked about everything under the sun,
whether or not it had any connexion
with our work; but I think the talk
opened up vast horizons for us. We
usually ended by discussing some
scientific article which had just
appeared.
The garden was another spot
beloved of Madame Curie, where
she liked to work with one of us or
bring us all together. "Her garden"
was a very modest affair, between
the "Curie Building" and the "Pasteur
Building", where she had planted
limes and rambler roses when the
Radium Institute was established. It
was furnished with spartan chairs,
benches and tables, and Madame
Curie planned any number of experi¬
ments with us in the garden, which
she preferred to her office.
Receptions for guests of honour or
new Doctors of Science were held
there when weather permitted. We
prepared everything ourselves, and
tea and ices were served in beakers
with glass rods.
Once I was acclimatized, I was
appointed as assistant to one of the
research scientists. We worked in the
"Little Building", and I spent years
behind its thickly-barred windows,
for this isolated building held the
precious, dangerous stocks of radium
and other concentrated radioactive
products.
Madame Curie would often tell me
what results she expected, but I had
to give her the exact results I had
obtained, after repeating each experi¬
ment several times. She prized inte¬
grity and enthusiasm above all else,
and as she trusted me, I very soon
had the immense privilege of work¬
ing with her.
Everything needed for a delicate
experiment had to be prepared under
her watchful eye, and nothing over¬
looked. It was marvellous training to
Work under her supervision and benefit
from her advice and commentary. It
was an ample reward for quickness
and skill when a substance of a high
degree of purity could be prepared
and used.
Marie Curie was the first woman
to be admitted as Professor at the
University. It was in 1906, after the
death of Pierre Curie, that she found
the courage to carry on her husband's
teaching at the Sorbonne, and pursue
their researches.
I only knew Marie Curie in her last ..
years, when radiation had already y X
taken its toll, and she was worn out.
Her classes made great demands on
her. If there was some special point

'LA PATRONNE' (Continued)
she wished us to understand, her
even tone would become resonant,
her deathly pallor would light up.
She was obviously most interested
in the experimental periods which
followed her classes; but it was with
her research team that she showed
herself a surpassing teacher. She
exacted fervent enthusiasm and
dogged persistence. Those who were
not imbued with the spirit of her
laboratory did not stay long.
I owe an immense debt of gratitude
to Marie Curie. If she realized, when
we were working together, that I had
lost the thread of her explanations,
she would go over the ground again,
and would tactfully "forget" to check
the relevant pages in my notebook.
But she made sure, during the next
few days, that I had worked at and
fully understood them, before going
on to the next step.
Marie Curie often brought us
together in the lecture-room, where
one of the team would explain his
work. In the early days, I found this
a most unusual and arduous exercise,
but Marie Curie could always breathe
life into it. She was close enough
to us to understand and feel our joy
at success, and our. disappointment
at failure.
To the very end, in spite of all
difficulties, she had the gift of wonder.
As she put it, "I am one of those who
see great beauty in science. A
scientist in his laboratory is not a mere
technician; he is also a child watching
a spectacle of natural phenomena
which move him as deeply as a fairy
tale. Nor do I believe there is any
danger of the spirit of adventure
dying out: the most vital force I see
when I look around me is that very
spirit of adventure, that indestructible
urge akin to curiosity."
In spite of every care, protective
measures were very inadequate at
that time, and the danger of certain
substances which we often manipu¬
lated was still not fully understood.
In June 1934, Madame Curie, already
very ill, was taken to Sancellemoz,
where she died on July 4. Her death,
which robbed us of "La Patronne,"
as we lovingly and deferentially called
her, was a cruel blow.
I have tried to keep faith with
Marie Curie, and continue research
in the field she opened up, as I pro¬
mised her. Before leaving for San¬
cellemoz, she told me to make all
preparations to obtain the emission
spectrum of actinium in Professor
Zeemars' Laboratory at Amsterdam,
which had all the necessary apparatus.
I had to get all the products and
equipment ready at Amsterdam, and
she was to be there for the experiment
when the day came . . . The following
autumn, with the help of the lab¬
oratory staff, we were able to carry
out this experiment by which
Madame Curie set such store, and
which was, I believe, the culmination
of her last experimental work.
