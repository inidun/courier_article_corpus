OF THE SURF

Balanced expertly on his surf board
(right), a Sydney (Australia) lifesaver
coasts shoreward on the crest of a Pacific
roller. Above, surf boats shoot homewards
during a surf carnival race near Sydney.
These lifesaving teams use the boats for
mass rescue operations and also to chase
away any stray shark which may come too
close to a beach. Man guiding the surf
boat with a 20ft. oar is called the "sweep",
a skipper and navigator rolled into one.

at the start of a race
between teams from
surf livesaving clubs.

ODAY more than 17,000
powerful young swimmers
keep Australia's beaches safe. They
make up one of the world's greatest
voluntary lifesaving organizations the
Surf Life Saving Association of Aus¬
tralia.
On a patrolled beach in Australia
people have a maximum guarantee of
safety... thanks to the lifesavers, the
men responsible for seeing the swim¬
mer's appetite for surf, sun and sand
is safely and fully satisfied.
The beach livesavers can look back
on a 57-year-old record whose most
impressive statistics are that more than
140,000 people have been rescued and
that the number of drownings has been
negligible.
The remarkable record of the surf
lifesavers has been achieved by a
combination of their own swimming
ability, the belt and lifeline, the surf
boat and the surf ski.
These young men compete in regu¬
lar surf carnivals which are major
events on the Australian sporting
calendar. With the surf boats crashing
through a turbulent sea, the beltmen
battling the surf, the precision march¬
ing as the club teams compete in the
"grand parade", the surf carnival is a
colourful spectacle.
Each of the hundreds who take part
proudly wears his bronze medallion
the surf lifesaver's badge of profi¬
ciency acquired only after hard train¬
ing developed by teams of experts
over the last half century and designed
to make the lifesaver proficient in all
phases of rescue, first aid and artifi¬
cial respiration.
These young men give up their
leisure time and even pay subscrip¬
tions for the privilege of belonging to
one of the surf lifesaving clubs. The
only rewards they seek are in competi¬
tion between themselves at the spec¬
tacular surf carnivals when there is
keen rivalry between the clubs in the
team events. These consist of the
drills used in actual rescues.
One of the most thrilling sights in
these competitions is the surf boat
crews battling their way through the
wildest surf. As the boat races shore-
wards, its five-man crew crowded at
the stern lifts the nose so that it slices
through the breakers. Balanced pre¬
cariously on the end is the powerful
"sweep" who needs superb timing
and judgement to steer the craft.
