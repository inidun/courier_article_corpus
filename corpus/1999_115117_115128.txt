What should the state do in a region where poverty is making a horrific comeback?
In 1960, the 20% of
wo rld populat i o n
living in the ri ch e s t
c o u n t ries had 30 times
the income of the
p o o rest 20%—by 1995
their income was 
82 times as much .

In the former Eastern bloc, strong central
g ove rnment virtually wiped out pove rt y
through wealth redistri bution mechanisms.
But as the region undergoes political transition,
the state is no longer up to the task,and poverty is
making a horrific comeback. E ven the form e r
middle classes now rank among the impove ri s h e d .
In the va s t , ethnically dive rse Fo rmer Soviet Union
(FSU) and Eastern Europe, the breakdown of central
planning and in many cases, the absence of effective
s t ate institutions to cushion the jolt, h ave led to the
most acute pove rty and we l fare reve rsals in the wo r l d .
Based on a daily four dollar benchmark—consi-
dered the minimum required to surv i ve — t h e
number of poor increased by over 150 million in
s e ven ye a rs , a figure gr e ater than the total com-
bined population of France, the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Since the 1998
financial crisis in Russia, the ranks of the poor are
estimated to have swelled by a further 20 million.
W h at ’s more, in this decade dollar-a-day pove rty has
made a comeback: in Romania and Bulgari a ,five per
cent of the population lives below that level.
E a s t e rn bloc transition countries were the only
ones in the world to have recorded a decline in
n ational incomes from the start of the curr e n t
decade up to the present.The declines have been as
gr e at as 60 per cent in some cases. A region that had
v i rtually no inflation under the previous system
suddenly experienced the most acute price instability
in the wo r l d , with prices rising in excess of 500 per
cent per year between 1990 and 1995.
It is also the only region in the world to have wit-
nessed a decline in men’s life expectancy, which in the
Russian Fe d e r ation fell from 64.2 to 57.6 ye a rs from
1989 to 1994, l ower than in Egypt, India and Bolivia.
Morbidity from syphilis, tuberculosis and AIDS has
increased dramat i c a l l y.And a system that once pri d e d
itself on having achieved near-unive rsal literacy has suf-
fered serious reve rs a l s. In Central Asian countri e s ,t h e
p ove rty of families has become a major impediment
to school at t e n d a n c e ,and research in several countri e s
suggests that there is a continued threat of illiteracy
e m e r ging amongst certain gr o u p s.
There have been many losers in the transition
process.
Wavering between gradualism 
and shock therapy
Children for one, with a massive erosion of
child allowa n c e s. In the Russian Fe d e r at i o n ,p ove rt y
rates among the under-15 group stood at 46 per
c e n t , compared to 35 per cent for adults between 31
and 60 and 22 per cent for pensioners. With the
decreasing number of child-care fa c i l i t i e s , m a ny
women have been forced to abandon work.
But what gives poverty in this region a qualita-
t i vely different profile from that of most deve l o-
ping nations is the slide into precarity of those who
once made up the professional middle class under
s o c i a l i s m . Large numbers of once prestigious scien-
t i s t s ,e n gi n e e rs and other highly educated specialists
e m p l oyed by public institutions have joined the
ranks of the poor, with little apparent chance of
transferring their skills to the market system and
becoming part of the entrepreneurial class. Once
s u p p o rt e rs of a democratic opening, this fru s t r at e d ,
m a r ginalized class is now more likely to be the firs t
to stand behind an authoritarian regime.
This general picture merits temperi n g . C e n t r a l
European countries (Czech Republic, H u n g a ry and
Po l a n d ) , which were independent at the time of the

breakup of the Fo rmer Soviet Union but had extensive
trade links with it—moved swiftly toward a market-
b a s e d , p ri vate-sector dominated economy, with rea-
sonably competent state institutions.These countri e s
still have the lowest levels of inequality in the wo r l d .
Social transfers in the form of pensions,u n e m p l oy m e n t
b e n e fits and child allowances increased relat i ve to
gross domestic product (GDP) or remained constant.
The economies of the Baltic Stat e s , initially disru p t e d
by the loss of energy subsidies from the USSR, r e g a i n e d
momentum after a relat i vely short period of hy p e ri n-
flation and declining output. A g a i n , p a rtly because
they came into the Soviet fold at a later dat e , their stat e
institutions remained competent and credible.
This has not been the case in the former Sov i e t
R e p u b l i c s. Most of these were unable to reach
consensus on the course of transition and wavered bet-
ween gradualism and shock therapy. In the Russian
Fe d e r ation and Ukraine, r e f o rm has been paralyzed
over such issues as property rights in agri c u l t u r e .
Public institutions, namely the law and order machi-
n e ry and the tax revenue serv i c e s ,h ave collapsed,v i r-
tually destroying the gove rn m e n t ’s ability to redistri-
bute resources.
The pendulum has swung too far
In Russia, taking advantage of a political va c u u m ,
the exe c u t i ve rushed through with a series of reform s
t h at further undermined credibility in state institu-
t i o n s , by providing generous underhand deals in the
p ri vat i z ation process and creating the conditions for
the mafia ’s gr ow t h , not unlike the situation in Italy in
the 19th century. In 1996, the richest 5 per cent of the
p o p u l ation controlled a share of income equal to
t h at of the bottom 60 per cent—and in many coun-
t ri e s , inequality has surpassed the troubling leve l s
found in Latin A m e ri c a .
From the all-intrusive state, the pendulum has
swung too far in the opposite direction. Often,the
i d e o l o gical inheritance dictated a rush to dismantle
the stat e .And ye t , as countries of Central Europe go
to show, the state has a key role to play in the tran-
sition process. E x c e s s i ve liberalization leads to
p ri vate monopolies, capital fli g h t ,u n p a l atable leve l s
of inequality and lack of trust in the market due to
financial fraud. Strong public institutions are
required that regulate financial markets and transfer
resources effectively to vulnerable gr o u p s. Last bu t
not least,reviving growth is the critical issue.
Many countries of the FSU were poised for a
t u rnaround when the 1998 Russian crisis set them
b a c k . S t i l l , the outlook is not comprehensive l y
b l e a k .M a ny countries have defined their economic
c o u rs e ,h ave we l l - e d u c ated populat i o n s , are inve s-
ting in retraining manpower and moving ahead
with we l fare reforms and institution-bu i l d i n g .N o t
including countries of Central Europe and the
Baltic Republics, there are some exceptional cases.
Azerbaijan will be an important test: thanks to an
easily exportable oil surp l u s , the country is likely to
b e n e fit from a boost in revenue (even with world oil
p rices as low as they are). But will it share the we a l t h ?
M a ny fear that wealth will stay concentrated in the
hands of a small oligarchy, a nightmarish scenari o.
A second group of countries (Uzbekistan,K a z a-
k h s t a n , Tu r k m e n i s t a n , B u l g a ria and Romania) is
b e ginning to post gr owth and take a more pro-active
stance towards the future.M a ny are making strenuous
e f f o rts to form trade and technology links other than
with Russia. But for a third group of countri e s —
Ta j i k s t a n ,G e o r gia (embroiled in an endless confli c t ) ,
A rm e n i a , the Kyrgyz Republic and Russia—the most
highly populated country of the FSU—the pros-
pects seem bleak. In Russia, it is conceivable that a
fairly coherent former Communist party gr o u p i n g
acting like a reformist state in China could shore up
public institutions without losing the momentum
of reform . In the wo rst case scenari o, the country will
simply print money, r e t u rn to hy p e ri n flat i o n , f u e l
social discontent and heighten political confli c t .
Clearly the Russians are aware of the leverage
they hold on the intern ational stage. They have
essentially defaulted on debt. Chaos in the region
is too great a threat to global security to be taken
m i l d l y, making it highly unlikely that We s t e rn powe rs
will pull back. On the contrary : the situation is
likely to engage the United States in the regi o n
more than it had ever expected to be.
I n t e rn ational agencies have an important role to
p l ay in strengthening public institutions in many
new areas and some traditional ones, such as health,
e d u c ation and the financial sector.Recognizing that
the transition process is a much more painful and sys-
temic process than initially conceive d , the Nordic
c o u n t ries are reviewing their aid policies towa r d s
the FSU, while the European Union is set to increase
its commitment in the months ahead. n
Since the onset of the
economic crisis, the shop

been nearly empty.

Excessive liberalization leads to
private monopolies, capital
flight, unpalatable levels of
inequality and lack of trust in the
market due to financial fraud
