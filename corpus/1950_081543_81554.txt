The world-wide mo-
yement of science
clubs covers many
aspects of the study 01
science. In Canada
there is a great
emphasis, for example.
on the protection 01
nature (described in
the article below).
Finland has, in many
respects,'been a
pioneer country for
science clubs. It was
the first country to
give science club
members free admis-
sion to the laboratories
and other facilities
of the universities
and technical schools.

IN Canada today over 100, 000 boysand girls are learning to combine
a knowledge of science with an
interest and respect for the natural
riches with which nature has endowed
their country.
They are members of Canadian
Science Clubs, whose general aim is to
keep young country people from leav-
ing the soil and to create an outlook
favourable to the protection of Cana-
da's natural riches.
As might be expected in a country
abounding with natural resources,
where the use of the soil, forests,
mines and fisheries plays an impor-
tant part in the nation's economy, the
work of the clubs has so far been
devoted to natural science.
A report on the activities of the
clubs specially written for Unesco by
the"Association Canadienne-Fran-
çaise pour 1'Avancement des Sciences",
reveals the rapid progress they have
made in the last twenty years.
A good example of this growth is
offered by the"Cercles de Jeunes
Agriculteurs"formed about forty years
ago with the aims of introducing
young country people to agriculture
and communal life, giving them prac-
tical knowledge of agriculture and do-
mestic economy, encouraging the use
of improved methods on the farm and
in the home and training boys and
girls to be good citizens.
The movement spread slowly at first,
but after the first world war it increas-
ed its membership rapidly until, in
1931, there were 21, 000 members in
1, 215 groups. Following the second
world war new impetus was given to
the movement and at the end of 1948
it reached the record number of 3, 478
groups with 45, 337 members.
Another active movement is wiles
Cercles de Jeunes Naturalistes"which
now comprises over 20, 000 members in
1, 148 groups. This movement for
young naturalists formed in 1931, has
; tread beyond the Province of Quebec
In addition to groups in Canadian pro-
vinces there are others in the United
States, France, the West Tnãies and
India.
Similar aims are pursued by another
group of Canadian clubs,"Clubs Audu-
bon pour les Jeunes", organized, on
the same basis as the American
Audubon Junior Clubs, under the
patronage of the Audubon Society of
Canada. At present, there are 1, 250
clubs in Canada with a total mem-
bership of 25, 000 boys and girls.
To make young people realize the
importance of forests as a source of
national wealth and the urgent need
to protect them, especially against fire,
is the main purpose of the"Clubs de
Jeunes Gardes-Forestiers" (Junior
Forest Wardens), a movement which
covers all parts of British Columbia.
It is estimated that over 20, 000 young
people have been trained by the clubs
and the present number of trainees is
5, 000.
The effectiveness of the work done
by the clubs'is shown by the fact that
some years, the Junior Forest Wardens
have discovered or helped to fight over
200 forest fires in British Columbia.
In certain districts there has been a
marked decrease in the number of
fires since the clubs have been oper-
ating regularly.
Similar work to that done by the
junior wardens in British Columbia is
carried out in Quebec by the 4-H
clubs founded in 1942 by the"Asso-
ciation Forestiere Quebecoise".
