ASIA TAKES A CRASH
COURSE IN EDUCAT I O N A L

Southeast Asia’s booming economy for decades masked deficiencies in educational systems. But
now, in the wake of financial crisis, the region is bent on getting smarter faster
launching its first computerized “ s m a rt
s c h o o l s ” .And Singapore has begun a cam-
paign to teach innovative thinking.
Despite differences among the Sou-
theast Asian countries,a few main threads
run throughout their approaches. F i rs t ,
these countries recognize the need for a
quantum leap in basic education and skills
standards in order for the labour force to
regain competitiveness. Second, rote lear-
ning is giving way to a new call for creative
t h i n k i n g . F i n a l l y, in Thailand and Indo-
n e s i a ,a u t h o rity over curricula and spending
is being decentralized to make education
more responsive to local needs.
Even before the crisis,it was clear edu-
c ational systems in many cases were laggi n g
behind economic development in Southeast
A s i a . For three decades these countries had
ridden the crest of export - o riented eco-
nomic growth. An important pillar of the
gr owth was cheap, unskilled labour.
H owe ve r , in recent ye a rs countries like
China,Viet Nam and India have undercut
the cost of labour in Southeast A s i a .This left
Southeast Asia less competitive in prov i-
sion of bargain-priced labour for basic
manufacturing. Meanwhile,skills training
was not keeping pace with the global
market,making it difficult for these coun-
t ries to compete in high added value indus-
tries such as information technology (IT).

this was apparent prior to 1997, g ove rn m e n t s

in late 1997,of eve ry Thai to 12 ye a rs of stat e -
paid education—compared with the curr e n t
average in practice of 5.3 ye a rs.
During the 30 years up to the financial
c risis that began in July 1997, as per capita
gross domestic product quadrupled in real
t e rm s ,p ri m a ry school enrolment grew from
around 70 per cent to 90 per cent.
Secondary school enrolment rose from 40
per cent to over 70 per cent.
But fundamental problems have pers i s t e d
with the education system, in which one in
e ve ry four children aged between six and 17 is
still not in school, and modes of teaching
appear increasingly outdat e d . Rote learn i n g
p r e vails and to the minds of altern at i ve
e d u c ationalists in T h a i l a n d , this cultivat e s
obedience to authority rather than stimulat i n g
independent thought. Most critically in the
e yes of economic planners , the Thai wo r k f o r c e
is under-qualified and lacks technical
e x p e rt i s e .

technology-based era.“We were reliant on

of non-formal education development.
According to a 1996 gove rnment surve y,
t h r e e - q u a rt e rs of the workforce aged over 21
ye a rs had no secondary educat i o n . At the
upper end of the educational scale there wa s
a dearth of intern ational-standard science
dragged their feet about addressing the
d e fic i e n c i e s. It was easier to put off much-
needed reforms then because the economies
were gr owing quickly, overall standards of
living were improving and there was little
pressure on gove rnments to undert a k e
i m p o rtant reform .M a l aysia and Singapore
h ave generally been forward-looking when
it comes to educat i o n .The fallout of the cri s i s
has increased their resolve to develop eve n
more sophisticated educational systems.
Thailand revamps its constitution

and economic models,” s ays Professor S.
G o p i n at h a n ,S i n g a p o r e ’s National Institute
of Education (NIE) dean, in reference to
his country ’s educational system. “ O u r
e c o n o my has been based on export - l e d
i n d u s t ri a l i z at i o n , which requires reasonably
e d u c ated and obedient labour, as well as
capital and markets. But the new economic
paradigm will be value-added in an entirely
different kind of way : the ability to use
knowledge and data.”
In Thailand an ambitious educat i o n

the most radical shake-up of the pedagogi c a l

This reality, d ri ven home by the cri s i s ,

the ministry of education was embroiled in
a scandal over the procurement of
c o m p u t e rs , which became a nat i o n a l
political issue.
M e a n w h i l e , giving more responsibility
to teachers for devising their ow n
c u rri c u l a — r ather than sticking ri gidly to
the national curriculum—should in theory
make education more sensitive to the needs
of local communities.This is a pri o rity for
the estimated 550,000 of the populat i o n
from hilltribe minorities living along the
mountainous borders with Laos and
M ya n m a r , whose education lags badly
behind that of lowland Thais.
H owe ve r ,e d u c ational experts wo rry the
c o u n t ry could be trying to embark on too
m a ny changes at once. “ I t ’s a massive task,
to streamline the ministri e s , to undert a k e
d e c e n t r a l i z ation of the system, to gi ve
j u risdiction to communities which have no
e x p e rtise in managing schools, and on top of

Indonesia decentralizes
In Indonesia, political reform since the
fall last year of the military ruler of 32 ye a rs ,
President Suhart o, has gi ven momentum
to changes in the education system. G a i n s
d u ring Suhart o ’s reign—when educat i o n
was the corn e rstone of development policy
and the proportion of the populat i o n
without pri m a ry schooling shrunk from
around three-quart e rs to one-third—are
under threat.
A 13 per cent contraction in the
e c o n o my in 1998, causing a sharp decline
in urban family incomes and their ability to
c over the modest expenses of stat e
s c h o o l i n g, presented education authori t i e s
with their own crisis—to prevent mass
dropouts.
The most wo rrying rise in dropouts has
been in urban areas, where they have tri p l e d
last year in secondary schools,particularly
among gi r l s. According to a World Bank
s t u d y, female enrolment in junior secondary
schools in Ja k a rta dropped by 19 per cent
in 1998/99.
In the cri m e - ridden Indonesian capital
there has been a clear increase in street
children cleaning windshields, b e g gi n g, a n d
selling newspapers. “ Jo c k e y s ” hang around
road intersections leading into the central
business distri c t , to earn cash by offering to
be passengers for car dri ve rs who risk a fin e

an empty ve h i c l e . “The overall effect, o f
c o u rs e , is that these kids are going now h e r e
near schools,” noted Stephen Hill, UN E S C O
representative in Indonesia.
In an effort to prevent mass school
d r o p o u t s , the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and the World Bank have pumped
over $300 million of loans into a five - ye a r

million students from poor families across

state funding.According to a recent World
Bank report , e ven before the cri s i s , m a ny
schools needed books, supplies and
substantial maintenance, with gove rn m e n t
grants to pri m a ry schools amounting to less
than $0.40 per pupil per year.
The scholarship scheme has been
s u p p o rted by a major state-backed “ S t ay in
S c h o o l ”c a m p a i g n , with adve rts on TV with
the catch phrase “aku anak sekolah”—“I’m
a schoolkid.”All funds are being dispers e d ,
when possible, directly to student and
school accounts held at post offices across
the country, in a bid to cut out on
administrative overheads and “leakage”.
E d u c ation minister Juwono Sudars o n o
has conceded in a recent interview that gr a f t
is a problem—and that from 10 to 15 per
cent of the funds are likely to be written off.
C o n c e rns have also been voiced about
delays in disbursement.
The ADB is upbeat about the
s c h o l a rship scheme, which it sees as lay i n g
the gr o u n d work for a radical
d e c e n t r a l i z ation of education financing in
the future. An official monitoring report of
the scheme concluded that 81 per cent of
the $2.50 per month scholarships have
reached the poorest students in the firs t
ye a r , and virtually all have received the
correct amount of money.
G ove rnment officials sound a more
cautious note, seeing the scheme as a stop-
gap measure. But the process of
d e c e n t r a l i z ation of authority for school
budgets and management appears

retaining control of the core nat i o n a l

remains hamstrung by a lack of local capacity
to go beyond the ri gid national curri c u l u m .
Malaysia and Singapore:
smart schools and creative kids
M a l aysia and Singapore have pressed
ahead with ambitious plans to change the
whole concept of schooling.
M a l aysia embarked this ye a r , a l b e i t
falteringly, on a “smart schools”project to
p r ovide the country with the innovat i ve IT
e x p e rts and computer-savvy wo r k e rs of
t o m o rr ow, in what the gove rnment is
touting as a unique part n e rship between the
state and private sector.
A consortium of 12 mainly
m u l t i n ational IT firms have been charged
with devising systems and software to equip
90 fully computerized schools. Some 30 per
cent of the designated schools are in ru r a l
areas.
“If we don’t go hi-tech and embrace
b r a i n - i n t e n s i ve industri e s , then Malay s i a
will be left reliant on labour-intensive
i n d u s t ri e s ,f o r e ver a developing country,”
declares Dr Rojani Abdul Hamid of the
Malaysian ministry of education
The idea is for the consortium to design
a “total solution” for computerized schools,
including electronic teaching mat e rials as
well as systems for student assessment and
a d m i n i s t r ation and management. C h i l d r e n
will be able to study at their own speed, a n d
take exams—accessed online from a
centralized database—when they are ready
t o. “ C o u rs e wa r e ” on CD Rom will be
p r ovided for four subjects: science and
t e c h n o l o g y, m at h s , English and Bahasa
M e l ayu (the national language of Malay s i a ) .
The ove rriding aim is to provide the
skills base for the planned Multimedia
Super Corri d o r , an IT industrial hub which
will stretch 50 kilometres south from the
c a p i t a l , Kuala Lumpur—the centrepiece of
Premier Mahathir Mohamad’s dri ve for
M a l aysia to achieve developed nation stat u s
by 2020.
Computer industry sources say the
economic crisis and problems of
c o o r d i n ating the pri vate sector consort i u m
has caused delays.The education ministry
has stepped into the breach, devising interi m
computer lesson plans and other teaching
m at e rials to ease the still-underequipped
schools into the IT era.
Singapore meanwhile has announced
plans to invest over $2.6 billion into bu i l d i n g
and upgrading 290 schools over the next
s e ven ye a rs , on its relentless quest to improve
an education system of already remarkable
e f fic i e n cy.The majority of children among
the Singaporean population of 3.5 million
pass through 10 ye a rs of state schooling.
But these achievements belie insecuri t y
about the innovat i ve ability of Singaporean
s t u d e n t s. Last ye a r , the NIE, which is
responsible for all teacher training, a d o p t e d
a new programme that represents a sea
change in the approach to classroom
l e a rn i n g .I t ’s called “teaching thinking” a n d
is designed to encourage what was once
taboo—students coming up with their ow n
i d e a s.
According to the NIE’s Professor
G o p i n at h a n ,Singapore has previously relied
on content mastery or the “pedagogy of the
wo r k s h e e t ” . But the global economy of the
future demands something more.“ We need
a learning environment that allows for
flexibility and collaborat i ve learn i n g,” h e
says. n
In Malaysia,schools are being equipped with computers through a state partnership with the private sector.
‘Decentralization is a must.
What the crisis has done is
speed up the process.’
