Hubble's Law
Edwin Hubble (1889-1953).

The application of spectroscopy to
astronomy coincided with the building of
a succession of giant telescopes at
Mount Wilson, in California and the ar¬
rival on the scene of the American
astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889 to
1953). Working at the Mount Wilson
Observatory, he showed that many
nebulae were, in fact, galaxies in their
own right, developed a classification for
galaxies that is still used today (see
diagram opposite page), and set about
measuring the distance to several of the
nearest galaxies.
Hubble soon noticed that galaxies are
distributed more or less evenly across the
sky and that all galaxies except our
nearest neighbours show a red shift in
their spectra. In 1 929 he announced that
his findings showed that the velocity of
recession indicated by the red shift Is pro¬
portional to the distance of a galaxy from
us. This became known as Hubble's
Law the direct proof that the universe is
expanding.
Since 1929, improved measurement
of distances to nearby galaxies has given
a more accurate value to the speed of
recession as related to distance the
Hubble Constant, as it is known. It is
estimated as between 50 and 100
kilometres per second per megaparsec
(3V4 million light-years). In other words,
for every 75 kilometres of measured
recession velocity, a galaxy is about
three and a quarter million light years
away from us. Hubble's Constant tells us
how quickly the universe is expanding,
and this in turn enables us to calculate
how long ago the Big Bang occurred. The
age of the universe, on this basis, is bet¬
ween 15,000 million and 20,000 million
years.
