Raw minerals are found in deposits which have accumula-
ted and concentrated over tens or hundreds of million of
years. Mineral extraction on land has not always been suf-
ficient to satisfy world demand, and so researchers and
industrialists have turned to the sea and the seabed,a rich
and promising but still little-known world.
Minerals under the sea come in several forms:
● Loose deposits come from three sources. Some are
detrital,like sand or gravel, or consist of “placer”deposits
containing tin, titanium, gold, rare earths, zirconium and
diamonds. Others are of biological origin,such as shells of
marine creatures which have turned into sand. A third
category originates from elements suspended in water,
yielding chemical deposits which produce, for example,
barytes or metal-rich sediments.
● Rock deposits, which are the undersea extension of
seams of coal, t i n , iron and other minerals.
● Deposits dissolved in sea wa t e r, such as sodium chlori-
d e, magnesium and iodine.
Offshore mineral extraction has grown to the point
that it now involves, or soon will,almost two-thirds of the
103 chemical elements identified in 1869 by the Russian
chemist Mendeleyev. Mineral sands, also known as beach
sand, come from the bedrock of continents worn away by
the weather and the passage of the seasons, especially in
tropical latitudes. The minerals are freed and carried away
by rivers, first to beaches and then to the seabed of the
continental shelf.
Extracting these minerals is important because they
have become indispensable to modern technology, w h i c h
depends heavily on titanium, zirconium and rare earths
(which include nine heavy minerals—radioactive thorium,
and eight lighter ones). Ti t a n i u m , considered a strategic
m e t a l , provides a white colouring for paper and plastic, a n d
plays an important role in the aeronautical industry and in
manufacturing golf clubs and tennis racke t s. Z i r c o n i u m ’s
refractory qualities make it useful in the thrust nozzles of jet
a i r c r a f t . Rare earths, which contain quartz or rutile (titanium
d i o x i d e ) , supply state-of-the-art technologies such as the
red colour in television pictures or the catalysis of engine
exhaust gases. Rutile has an amazing resistance. It does not
wear out and cannot be corroded by other chemicals. B u t
deposits of it are scarce and unevenly distributed. The big-
gest are in A u s t r a l i a , M a d a g a s c a r, C a m e r o o n , Ghana and
Sierra Leone.
Beach sand is mined using huge, s u p e r- p o w e r f u l
dredges which can scoop up as much as 2,500 tonnes an
h o u r. Between 90 and 98 per cent of the dredged material
is waste which, after the minerals have been separated out
by gravity, is put back where it came from. The most
conscientious mining companies try to leave the landscape
as they found it.They set aside topsoil, and later replace, f e r-
tilize and replant it.
