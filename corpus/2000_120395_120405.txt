I g o ro t s: in defence of home◗ Victoria Ta u l i - C o r p u z
In the mid-1970s, the Igorot people won fame for fighting the largely World Bank-funded
C h i c o River Dam pro j e c t . N o w, their survival is increasingly linked to changing the rules of
international tra d e, as a leading advocate explains
Ihad become a student activist after living in
Manila at the height of the anti-Vietnam Wa r
m ove m e n t , but I was firmly convinced that my
future lay in going back home to help organize my
n at i ve people, the Igorots1. Since martial law had
been declared in 1972, the only legi t i m ate way for
us to operate was through NGOs. Six ye a rs later I
c r e ated one to organize villagers and set up com-
munity-based health progr a m m e s.

1. The Igorots are indigenous people from six ethno-
linguistic tribes—the Ibaloy, Kankana-ey, Ifugao, Kalinga,
Apayao/Isneg and the Bontoc—living in the rugged
Cordillera region in the northern Philippines. All six tribes
share common traits, including religious beliefs based on
nature.The total population of Igorots in the region stands
at 1.2 million according to the 1995 census.
We raised the social and political awareness of our
p e o p l e , and mobilized them against the dictat o r-
ship of Ferdinand Marcos. We understood that we
were oppressed and discri m i n ated against as indi-
genous people, and that therefore we should stru g g l e
for self-determ i n ation and regional autonomy. I n
the 1980s, the gove rnment was finally forced to
cancel the Chico River Dam Project because of our
sustained opposition. This project would have dis-
placed around 300,000 Igorots.
At the time we could already see the value of
i n t e rn ational networking to gather support for our
s t ruggles against military rule in many of our com-
m u n i t i e s.We discovered the Unive rsal Declaration of
Human Rights, and used it to strengthen our cause.
Indigenous peoples also became active in lob-
bying the United Nations to address human ri g h t s

v i o l ations of indigenous peoples. Since the crea-
tion in 1982 of a UN Working Group on Indigenous
Po p u l at i o n s , indigenous peoples have regularly taken
p a rt in drafting minimum standards for the protec-
tion of their ri g h t s. I am, h owe ve r , a strong believe r
in the pri m a cy of local and national struggles ove r
i n t e rn ational action.Without strong resistance on
t h e gr o u n d , i n t e rn ational campaigns will fa i l .T h e
fa l l of the Marcos dictat o rship came about
p ri m a ri l y because of the protests of the poor majo-
ri t y, which had built up for more than 20 ye a rs
within the country. Only once the regime became
widely unpopular did the elite Filipinos and the
i n t e rn ational community start to withdraw some
s u p p o rt from it.
But I have also seen how decisions or agr e e-
ments reached by intern ational institutions like the
World Bank and the Intern ational Monetary Fund
( IM F) can erode gains achieved locally. From the
l ate 1970s to the 1980s, I helped to set up commu-
nity-based health progr a m m e s , only to see the stru c-
tural adjustment policies and programmes of the
World Bank and IM F lead to budget cuts in health,
while liberalization of our investment and trade law s
set back much of our progr e s s.
The struggle for ancestral land ri g h t s , for ins-
t a n c e , was undermined by the Mining Act of l995,
which allows foreign mining corp o r ations to have
100 per cent foreign equity and a 75-year lease on a
maximum of 81,000 hectares of mineral lands. T h e
Indigenous Pe o p l e s ’ Rights Act (IPRA), a new law
passed in 1998, r e c t i fied some of the damage but fa l l s
s h o rt of what we wa n t . The mining corp o r at i o n s
h ave neve rtheless filed a suit in the Supreme Court
questioning its constitutionality.
We were told that to deve l o p, we have to shift
from producing for our domestic use to producing
for the world market. But those who shifted to cash
crop production are now going bankrupt because of
the dumping of highly-subsidized, i m p o rted agri-
cultural products from foreign countri e s. C h e a p
r e a d y - t o - f ry sliced potat o e s ,c o rn , oranges and pears ,
frozen-dressed chicken and other foods are being
dumped in the country, d e s t r oying the livelihoods of
tens of thousands of fa rm e rs. The commitments of
the Philippine gove rn m e n t , p a rticularly relating to
a griculture as part of the Uru g u ay Round of the
General A greement on Ta riffs and Tr a d e , has allowe d
this to happen.
This situation is not unique to the Philippines.
Our Quechua sisters from Pe ru share a similar story.
Their potatoes are now left to rot in the fields because
they cannot compete with cheap, dumped processed
p o t ato slices from North A m e ri c a .I m p o rted maize or
c o rn has also destroyed the traditional corn produc-
tion of indigenous peoples in Mexico. Food insecu-
rity and the loss of livelihoods are wo rsening each day.
Of cours e , we argue that our gove rnments should
be blamed because they signed these agr e e m e n t s ,a n d
also because they push an unsustainable economic
model that is debt-dri ve n , e x p o rt - o riented and
i m p o rt - d e p e n d e n t .
In our own voice
But we are not blind to the powe rs of the Wo r l d
Trade Organizat i o n , the IM F and World Bank, a n d
bodies like the Organization for Economic Coope-
r ation and Development (OE C D) or the Group of
E i g h t . Those economies that do not fall in line
become pari a h s.The globalization of the production
and consumption systems of the few elite countri e s ,
c o rp o r ations and individuals is a threat to the conti-
nued existence of dive rse and sustainable indige-
nous live l i h o o d s.
This is the main reason why Tebtebba was set up
in 1996. After doing work on the local and nat i o n a l
l e ve l s , I felt that there was a gap. Global decisions
directly impact on our daily lives and can erode
gains achieved through ye a rs of hard wo r k . Yet we
h ave no chance to influence these decisions. O u r
absence in the global arena allows others to speak for
u s , and in many instances we are misrepresented.
Tebtebba is a Kankana-ey-Igorot term for discours e
and I thought this was an appropri ate name for an
Indigenous Pe o p l e s ’I n t e rn ational Centre for Po l i cy
Research and Educat i o n .
Indigenous peoples are pushing hard for the UN
to adopt the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Pe o p l e s , and are campaigning to slow down or halt
unfettered globalizat i o n . Tebtebba took the lead in
researching and writing on globalization and indi-
genous peoples. In Seat t l e , we adopted the “ S e at t l e
D e c l a r ation of Indigenous Pe o p l e s.” Among other
t h i n g s , this called for the removal from the WTO o f
the Tr a d e - R e l ated Aspects of Intellectual Propert y
Rights—a legal device allowing corp o r ations to
a p p r o p ri ate our dive rse biological and genetic
r e s o u r c e s , along with our traditional know l e d g e ,
and to patent life itself.
We still have a long way to go.We need all kinds
of part n e rs h i p s , e ven with gove rn m e n t s , to bri n g
about a world which allows us to exist as distinct
peoples and where social, economic and env i r o n-
mental justice reigns. ■
