South A f r i c a : blending 
t radition and change 
w Ferial Haffajee
In South A f r i c a ’s Herculean task of law re f o r m , w o m e n ’s groups are in the vanguard 
of the movement to adapt traditional law to post-apartheid society
When former President Nelson Mandela
m a rried Graça Machel last ye a r , their We s-
tern ceremony was simple and secret. But
their customary marriage in the verdant hills of
Xunu in the Transkei was treated like an occasion
of stat e . Machel was welcomed in traditional dress
by the elders of the Te m bu clan in a ceremony
beamed around the world. And Mandela’s elders
negotiated her bride price or lobola with Machel’s
Mozambican kin.
The event was significant for many reasons, ye t
above all, it moved traditional customs and laws
from the fringes to the centre of South A f ri c a n
s o c i e t y. It signaled a shift in power for customary law
which the apartheid state treated as common law ’s
“poor cousin”.
A gr o u n d swell of innovation is underway to
instill new authority, resources and dignity to cus-
t o m a ry law. Not only is the aim to correct histori c a l
i n j u s t i c e , but to rebuild trust in the criminal justice
system and respect for the rule of law.The challenge
lies in building a legal system which integr at e s
common and customary law in line with the new
c o n s t i t u t i o n , e n s h rining such fundamental pri n-
ciples as gender equality. “The old, unequal rela-
tionship between common law as the big brother
and customary law as the poor cousin is gone,”
says Professor Thandabantu Nhlapo of the South
A f rican Law Commission.“Both have to be judged
in terms of the constitution.”This harmonization
process marks a major step in South Africa’s Her-
culean task of legal reform . The first step lay in
repealing apartheid laws. Next came the need to
reconstitute the Law Commission, which was domi-
n ated by racist judges of the old regi m e .N ow it must
shape new laws to govern a new social order.
C u s t o m a ry law in South A f rica has suffered
similar travails to those of other African countries
with a colonial past.A f rikaner gove rnments inheri t e d
a dual legal system of common and customary law
from British colonizers. They codified this mixed
system into the Nat i ve A d m i n i s t r ation Act which in
1986 became the Black A d m i n i s t r ation A c t —
sculpted as a tool to divide, by fine-tuning the sepa-
r ate system of administration for blacks. Under the
A c t ,c u s t o m a ry law was tolerated so long as it wa s n ’t
deemed “ r e p u g n a n t ” to common law, in which case
it was nullified.
Swift, cheap justice
Yet customary law is probably the only form of
justice known to many South A f ri c a n s.About half the
p o p u l ation lives in the countryside where traditional
c o u rts  administer customary law in over 80 per
cent of villages.The court s , which are also found in
some urban tow n s h i p s , deal with eve ry d ay disputes
like petty theft,p r o p e rty disagreements and domestic
a f fa i rs—from marriage to divorce and succession.
(The courts cannot impose fines of more than $6 and
s e rious crimes are tried by formal court s. )
Justice is swift and cheap as the courts are run
with minimal formalities and charge less than a
dollar for a hearing.The judges use everyday lan-
guage, and the rules of evidence allow the com-
munity to interject and question testimonies.T h e s e
courts are close to the people who don’t have the
money or time to travel to towns for formal court s.
Yet the system is not without its cri t i c s — n a m e l y
wo m e n , who are barred from serving as judges and
often discri m i n ated against as litigants.Pa r a d ox i c a l l y,
wo m e n ’s gr o u p s , under the umbrella of the Rural
Wo m e n ’s Move m e n t , h ave been in the vanguard of
e f f o rts to recognize customary law and adapt it to post-
a p a rtheid society.Discussions about ways of elevat i n g
c u s t o m a ry law are intertwined with debates on making

it gender-neutral.Three issues top the agenda: t r a d i-
tional marri a g e s ,i n h e ritance rights and the status of
traditional court s.
Under apartheid, traditional or customary law
m a rriages were not legally recognized and only
regarded as “unions”.If a couple couldn’t afford a
common law marri a g e , the woman was considered
a “ m i n o r ” who wa s n ’t even allowed to open a credit
account with a local gr o c e r. Most rural wo m e n
raise their children alone as their husbands are
migrant workers in mines and industrial centres.
“The women couldn’t buy anything.They had to
wait for their husbands to return from the city in
order to sell propert y,” s ays Likhapa Mbatha of
the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS), a
legal think-tank.Thus, the Recognition of Custo-
m a ry Marriages Act was passed last year after close
c o l l a b o r ation between the SA Law Commission
and the women’s movement. For Mbatha, “It’s a
recognition that South Africa is in Africa.”
Reforming and recognizing
traditional courts
This first victory was about righting an apart h e i d
w r o n g : disrespect for customary law.The next step
lies in making it gender-neutral.According to cus-
tomary law, only males can inherit property and
we a l t h .N h l a p o ’s sub-committee has proposed bri n-
ging this law into line with the non-discriminatory
common law. Indeed, the proposal may not be as
radical as it appears. In a research project, CALS
found that many villages have informal ways of
ensuring inheritance to widows and daughters. A
p a r l i a m e n t a ry decision on the proposed changes is
anxiously awaited.
The third priority lies in reforming and reco-
gnizing traditional courts. South Africa’s common
law criminal justice system is buckling under the
weight of shrinking budgets and poor management,
according to the National Director of Prosecu-
t i o n s. Nhlapo sees a partial remedy in expanding the
o p e r ations of the traditional courts which have the
respect of the people—an essential ingredient in
reinforcing the rule of law. “ You must empowe r
traditional courts to dispense justice in a way and in
a language that people understand,” says Nhlapo,
“by bri n ging traditional courts in line with the
constitution and financially investing in them.”To
begin breaking down the gender barricades to jus-
tice, the South African Law Commission recom-
mends having elected councillors preside with tra-
ditional chiefs in their court s. H owe ve r , the wo m e n ’s
lobby does not fully trust the chiefs and headmen.
So instead of formally recognizing these courts or
expanding their powe rs , the lobby would simply like
to see them treated as local arbitration tri bu n a l s. N o t
surprisingly, the proposition has ignited an open
b attle with the traditional leaders , who want to
strengthen their courts.
The jury is still out on the traditional courts
s y s t e m .W h at e ver the outcome, it will be a milestone
in South Africa’s history and quest for justice. n
