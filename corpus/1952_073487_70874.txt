THINGS ARE
LOOKING UP IN
THE'FORGOTTEN
VALLEY'
by Tibor ME. NDE.
tn) 947. the Government of Haiti and Unesco inau-gurated a pilot project in fundamental education
- that is, education to achieve better living stan-
dards-in the Marbial Valley region of this island republic.
This year, the Haiti project became part of Unesco's
programme of technical assistance for economic develop-
ment. Now educators from Haiti and Unesco are
working to make it a laboratory where teaching methods
and materials can be tested under practical conditions
before they are placed into general use. In order to
get a first-hand picture of conditions in Marbial, Mr. Tibor
Mende recently visited the Valley during a trip to Cen-
tral and South American countries on assignment for
Unesco. The article published below is the first of a
series which will appear in the Courier on Latin America.

THE rain stopped, leaving thetropical vegetation which en-
veloped the wooden building
swollen with fresh water. Three
youngsters had been sheltering on
the verandah, talking seriously,
while the water dried up a little.
Now, we started to talk together,
their Creole resembling French as
much as my French their Creole.
Toulin Jeremi, a boy of 12, was
holding a piece of cow-horn in his
hands and Elid Daglin, a curly-
haired girl of nine, had her copy-
book. The third of the group,
Job Lerich, the tallest and oldest
of the three, stood by, listening
with all that aloofness of the most
experienced. After some hesita-
tion, they admitted that they were
talking of their plans for the
future.
The girl proved to be the most
communicative. They were talk-
ing, she said, of a store in the
Marbial Valley where they live.
She would be the couturier, taking
charge of dresses ; Job would make
sandals ; while Toulin was a born
merchant and would arrange mat-
ters very successfully. But Toulin
hastened to add that he too had
his speciality, and proudly showed
the cow-horn in his hand. With
the help of the instructor, he
explained, he had started to make
combs, and now he could finish one
in half-an-hour and sell it for
15 cents. Elid, with a bright
smile, interrupted him :"'He's
already selling them to the local
hairdresser, and even in Jacmel.
For this one, he has been paid in
advance...", and her little brown
face was shining with pride for all
three of them.
These three young Haitians
were children of the Valley. Their
parents and grandparents lived be-
tween the steep hills rising on both
sides of the Gosseline river. Tri-
vial as this chat with the three
children seems, there was some-
thing about it that was as new
and as startling in this sad valley
as if the denuded hillsides had
suddenly turned green again.
That something was hope.
Children in the Marbial Valley get lessons in Creole, the language which most Haitians speak.
This big noticeboard at the entrance of the Unesco Experimental Centre says, in Creole :
"Unesco Centre'Amikoiat'at Na Mago". Na Mago is a village on the road to Marbial.
The name of Marbial is little
known, even in the Caribbean area.
It is a forgotten valley. It has
neither villages nor hamlets, and
its people, living in their scattered
wooden huts, are no part of any
community : they are merely the
folk of Marbial. They have to
work hard to keep alive. A few
decades ago, as the older ones still
remember, life was much easier.
Since then tropical disease, soil
erosion and over-population have
combined to spread ignorance and
misery.
Trees have been cut down and
the once blossoming hillsides are
barren ; meat has become a rarity ;
children grow up illiterate and
their parents have to make almost
superhuman efforts to try to pay
off debts and feed their increasing
families. Most families own or
rent three to five acres of land, and
grow coffee for sale at the Jacmel
market ; but they must clear more
and more of the coffee groves
to produce maize and other
foodstuffs for themselves. While
the population of
the valley nears the
30, 000 mark and the
land is sub-divided
among the children
in ever smaller par-
cels, there is more
and more exhausted
land and the valley
has been lowly
dying.
In this picture of
desolation, the prac-
tices of Christianity
are but a thin ve-
neer over the old
African traditions.
The terrors of the
iupernatural world,
Jf voodoo and magic,
are still important
in the lives of the
people of Marbial.
But none of these
practices helps to
provide v'hat is so
deeply needed in
this atmosphere of deterioration
- hope.
There are some craftsmen among
the people of the valley, such as
leather workers, tailors and basket-
makers ; but their main job is on
the land, and their craftsmenship
only provides for the needs of the
neighbourhood. If Elid wants to
make dresses, Job to learn tanning
and make sandals, and Toulin to
make combs, there is nothing very
unusual in it. What is new is that
they are thinking of trade with the
town, of combining to create a
store, that they display an aware-
ness of things beyond the valley,
and that they are building plans
for the future. The new realiza-
tion of wider horizons beyond their
valley, the unconscious search for
something new for a better future
- these are new. They show that
these three young Haitians, in one
of the forgotten corners of their
country, have re-discovered what
their parents lost long ago : hope.
To reach the wooden verandah
where the three were discussing
their plans called for a rough jour-
ney of several hours in a jeep.
From Port-au-Prince the road leads
across plantations and forests, hills
and ravines ; often it disappears
under the thick tropical vegetation.
Or you can fly in a quarter-of-an-
hour from the capital to Jacmel,
where the plane lands on a meadow
studded with thatched cottages,
without a runway. From there,
along neglected roads, it is another
hour's drive to the Valley. After
the rains the river is often too
swollen even for the jeep, and the
traveller has to mount a horse to
cross it. Poor communication
have made it difficult to bring h'
to Elid, Job and Toulin.
When Unesco first decided to
"tart a pilot-scheme for basic edu-
cation in Haiti, the Marbial Valley
seemed the least promising place
for such an experiment. It was a
courageous decision to launch the
experiment among people bent
under the weight of a merciless

RESULTS HAVE BEEN SLOW BUT UNMISTAKABLE
nature, rather than taking the
easier road. It meant that no
quick or spectacular results could
be expected ; but it also meant that,
in case of success, it would provide
experience which would prove in-
valuable in a variety of other tro-
pical areas faced with similar
obstacles and difficulties.
Today, after barely three years
of work, the decision seems to have
been justified. The results have
been slow, but they are un-
mistakable and have probably been
achieved more quickly than was
generally expected. The verandah
on which the children's conversa-
tion took place surrounded the
project's centre : their confidence
was a small and symbolic indication
of what the project was achieving.
From a small solitary building,
the centre has grown into a group
of hutments, carrying out a va-
riety of activities, all in a modest
way. It now has a primary school
with two classrooms and meagre
equipment for its 105 pupils aged
between six and 16. A doctor
holds a clinic four times a week, a
dentist receives patients once a
week, and the people of Marbial
are getting used to the idea of qua-
lified medical aid. They accept
this as one more example of the
usefulness of the centre in their
daily lives, and on the morning of
the appointed days long rows of pa-
tients queue up between the bananza
plants in front of the doctor's
building.
There is a small stock-raising
station which gives practical de-
monstrations under expert guid-
ance of better ways of poultry and
pig-raising, thus showing the local
farmers how they could apprecia-
bly improve their living conditions.
Its vegetable nurseries and affores-
tation school meet a similar need.
The activities of the Unesco
experimental s. tation are discussed
in the adult educational classes
and the results achieved are made
known to the population by word
and picture, by pamphlets and
leaflets written in simple language.
In tiny workshops, under the guid-
ance of local specialists, groups of
students learn sisal and mat
making, tanning and basketry. La-
ter, pottery-making will be taught.
There is plenty of clay in the Val-
ley, but up to now nothing has
been done to utilize it, though
potteries could contribute to the
meagre income of the population.
The credit co-operative, launched
with the help of a small Unesco
loan, is making good progress. Be-
gun in June 1950, it already has
over a hundred members and, apart
from its practical benefits, its open
discussions help members to air
their grievances and encourage
them to take an interest in the
improvement of their community.
The co-operative's meeting, usually
attended by the local priest, is
convincing proof that the self-
reliance and resourcefulness of the
peasants can be improved with a
judicious appeal to their self-inter-
est as well as to their co-operative
instincts. More recently a regional
committee was organized, and it is
fast becoming a democratic discus-
sion forum where constructive pro-
posals are examined and analysed
by the very people who would carry
them out.
While the new building of the
social worker's centre is under
construction, 19 small centres in
the open air are in operation. The
shaded and simple wooden benches
of these"classrooms"are used by
over 800 people, with an average
attendance of 40 adult pupils for
each group. Twenty student-teach-
ers, selected by competition, get a
token salary of $10 a month, while
the others come voluntarily before
or after their daily work in the
fields. Conventional subjects like
arithmetic and history are taught,
as well as practical subjects such
as hygiene, soil improvement and
domestic economy. The pride of
the centre is Visciere Pierre, a
woman of 42 who learnt to read
and write there and, in her anxiety
to disseminate her newly acquired
knowledge among the people of the
valley, is busily preparing for her
new role as a social worker. She
goes around and talks to people
about the great work ahead and
encourages them to follow her
example.
Added to a variety of other acti-
vities-like the regular spraying
of houses with DDT, the building
of pit-latrines, the hygienic clean-
ing-up of markets and the con-
struction of an abattoir to prevent
the bleeding of slaughtered animals
into the river-the centre is mak-
ing progress in the Marbial Valley.
People are displaying growing
confidence in the centre. No longer
do they just regard it as another
"official"building to do things for
them ; they realize that the centre
is there to help and guide them to
achievements by their own efforts.
In growing numbers they come
to the clinic and to the dentist and
discuss their personal problems
with the members of the centre.
As a typical example, the female
equivalent of the medicine-man in
the valley, the woman who used to
help at child-birth, is now attend-
ing the clinic to comp) her'2du-
cation with a few bits of"real
medicine". More and more of
the people of the valley send their
children to the centre with confi-
dence and its gardens and build-
ings are gay the whole day long
with children in classes, or
workshops, or at table-tennis.
And now two merchants from
the neighbouring town of Jacmel
have decided to establish branches
in the valley."'This is the first
time a merchant of Jacmel has
taken any interest in us,"a volun-
tary worker boasted to me."What
is more, once a week a bus has
started to come to the valley..."
And so, what were originally
reticent and suspicious peasant
greetings have now turned into
friendly smiles when the people of
the valley meet someone from the
centre. A new feeling is develop-
ing among them ; the incredulous
growing belief that, after all, the
people of'"the forgotten valley"
are not abandoned.
