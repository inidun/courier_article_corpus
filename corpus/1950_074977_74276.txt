A'RAY OF SUNSHINE'
in the Laboratory
FOil the last four years abrave game f improvisa-
tion has been played in the
laboratories of war-hit schools
and universities in Europe and
t)) Far Eas.

Wicks dipped in alcuhol have
replaced bunsen burners andwith a little ingenuity burned
out electric light bulbs have
been converted for use as re-
torts. But there comes a time
when this pretence must end :
when instructors find it impo-.-
sihle to continue their work for
lack of real equipment : when
students despair of ever being
ahle to see in practice the expe-
riments they have learned in
theory.
Recognising this need, Canes-
co, as part of its educational
reconstruction programme, has
during the past few months
been making efforts to supply
laboratories with equipment
they must have for teaching
and research.
Just what the anival of badly
needed equipment means l√≤
instructors and to the students
who, for the first time are able
to use modern scientific instru-
ments is expressed in letters
which Unesco has recently re-
ceived.
Work Can Now
Go Ahead
ONE of these letters wasfrom Professor'O. Kralky,
of Graz University in Aus-
tria, who wrote :'
"I understand from your last
letter that the apparatus for
which I asked you has been
ordered. I can tell you that
this news is the first ray of
sunshine in the desolation that
our experimental research ser-
vices has experienced since the
end of end of the war. This appa-
ratus will help us  greatly in
our work, which we shall now
be able to organize on a new
be, busis. I feet profondly grateful
to Unesco, and I wish to concey
my warmest thanks for your
effort."
Another Austrian scientist,
Dr. L. Ebert. of the Chemical
Laboratory at Vienna Univer-
sity, wrote :
"I am happy to inform you
that the two Roentgen tubes 
made available to us by Unesco
hare arrived to-day. As I have
already told you, our old ones 
had become unusable, and it is
catively due to Unesco's genero-
sity that we are now able to
continue our laboratory work.
Please accept our sincere
thanks, and kindly inform all
those who contributed to this
grift how grateful we are".
Many simitar letters have
been received hv L'nesco. Some
of them express the thanks not
only of those who want to
teach, but also of those who
wish to learn-students who
have been able to hegin studies
that the destruction of labora-
lory equipment had previously
made impossible.
In its reconstruction ! pro
gramme, Unesco is helping to
give men and women one of the
first essentials of life-a future.
