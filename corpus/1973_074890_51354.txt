THE RUINS
OF PARADISE
Unearthed from Syrian sands
40 years ago, the ancient city
of Mari may now be doomed

I N the summer of 1933,
on a hillock known as Tell Hariri near
Abu Kemal, in Syrian territory, some
Arab peasants who were looking for
stones to cover a grave came upon
a battered, headless statue distinctively
"Sumerian" in character. A few
months later, a French archaeological
expedition was sent from Paris to
explore Tell Hariri.
After a month of digging, we had the
good fortune to unearth a shrine
packed with votive statuettes of male
and female worshippers.
Three of the statuettes bore inscrip¬
tions in cuneiform script. Each inscrip¬
tion consisted of only four columns of
characters, but from them we learned
a great deal.
We discovered that the temple was
dedicated to Ishtar, goddess of war
and fertility. The votive offerings had
been dedicated by Ebih-il, a steward,
a "miller" named Idi-narum and, above
all, by a certain Lamgi-Mari who styled
himself king of Mari.
This was all we needed to identify
the site. Hariri, which was the name
of an Arab poet, could obviously not
have been the name of the town in
in antiquity. But the name Mari is
mentioned several times in ancient

ANDRE PARROT, honorary director of the
Louvre and curator-in-chief of the National
Museums of France, is one of the world's
great authorities on the ancient Near East.
His excavations at Baalbek in the Lebanon,
Larsa and Lagash in Irak, and most signifi¬
cantly at Marl in Syria, have added enor¬
mously to our knowledge of the history of
ancient Mesopotamia. He has written over
thirty books on Oriental and biblical archaeo¬
logy including two celebrated works trans¬
lated into several languages: 'Sumer" and
"Assur", published by Editions Gallimard In
their series "The Arts of Mankind", of which
he is co-editor with André Malraux. (English
editions published by Thames and Hudson,
London, and Golden Press, New York)
When unearthed from the
sands of the Syrian
desert in 1936, this
"goddess with the flow¬
ing vase" was decapi¬
tated and in fragments.
Deity of one of the most
ancient civilizations that
flourished on the banks
of the Euphrates, the
human-sized statue was
buried for almost 4,000
years before its dis¬
covery on the site of
Mari, capital of a great
city-state with a history
dating back to between
3000 and 1800 B.C. With
both hands the goddess
tilts the aryballos or
vase, so arranged that
on certain occasions the
"life-giving waters of
fertility' flowed from a
hidden tank and issued
through the vase. Far

dess from which the
eyes inlaid with lapis¬
lázuli have been gouged.
The plaited hair, falling
to the shoulders like a
collar, still bears traces
of ochre colouring. One
of the most precious of
all Mesopotamian sculp¬
tures, the reconstructed
statue is now in the
Aleppo museum (Syrian
Arab Rep.).

texts, in particular as having been the
capital of a dynasty (the 10th after
the Flood) and at one point the great
rival of Hammurabi, King of Babylon.
It was recorded by the scribes that
in the thirty-fifth year of Hammurabi's
forty-three year reign, an important
military operation was carried out (it
was the custom, at that time to
distinguish years by the major event
occurring during the twelve-month
period) and that "on the orders of
Anu and Enlil (two of the major
Mesopotamian gods, of the sky and
the earth respectively) Hammurabi
destroyed the walls of Mari".
It would seem that Mari was a
formidable as well as a feared city,
for two years previously Hammurabi
had already congratulated himself on
his "victory" over Mari and Malgia.
Once the identification of Hariri
with Mari had been established, it
could be expected that the results of
systematic exploration would be most
impressive, and so they were, even
as described here in bare outline.
Fifteen temples dedicated to the
different gods of this polytheist
civilization were found, with all their
votive sculptures, and although most
of these were broken, it was possible
to piece many of them together again.
As well as the temples, a gigantic
palace was brought to light, covering
more than eight and a half acres,
containing 300 rooms and courtyards,
and dating back to the nineteenth and
eighteenth centuries B.C., the royal
residence of a dynasty whose last
representative was Zimri-Lim the
very king who fought Hammurabi.
The palace contained several
extraordinary features: the throne
room, the area where the functionaries
had their offices, private apartments,
bathrooms still with their terracotta
bathtubs, chapels; nearly life-size
statues, including that of the governor
Ishtup-ilum, lying on the floor of the
throne room where it had fallen from
a dais, and the "trick" statue of the
"goddess with a flowing vase" from
which, by a system of connecting
vessels, the water of fertility could
be made to gush on certain days;
mural p a i n t i n g s religious scenes
(sacrifices, investitures) and geometric
patterns older than those of Crete;
and a royal library containing the
diplomatic and economic archives of
the kingdom, 25,000 tablets in cunei¬
form script which are now being
deciphered by a Franco-Belgian team
under Professor Dossin.
This is only the merest outline, but
there was more to come. Beneath the
second millennium palace, two more
palaces unexpectedly emerged,

These photos sum up the problems of safeguarding the extraordinary
ruins of Mari, capital city of a Mesopotamian kingdom, discovered some
forty years ago. Above, aerial view of the huge site today. At top left
is the temple of Ishtar, goddess of fertility (3rd millenium B.C.), excavated
during the 1930s. At centre foreground is the palace of Zimri-Lim
(2nd millenium B.C.), a vast construction covering over eight acres. In
1936 the palace walls, still perfectly preserved, stood five metres high.
Today, the same walls (below) are eroded and In ruins after exposure

This 15 cm. high statuette of a grand-priestess
(left) was discovered in the temple of Ishtar
at Mari. The eyes are formed of shells
incrusted with lapis-lazuli and the remaining
traces of the arms indicate that the hands
were folded In an attitude of prayer. Below,
a worshipper, eyes similarly fashioned from
shells and lapis-lazuli, was found at another
temple at Mari. The carefully curled beard
does not hide the suggestion of a smile,
echoed on many 3rd millenium B.C. statuettes
unearthed at Mari.

obviously older than the first and
undoubtedly belonging to the "tenth
dynasty after the Flood" mentioned
by scribes. Here again we found
fantastic architecture, more rooms,
courtyards, shrines.
But an even more astounding
discovery awaited us. Whereas the
walls of the earliest known third
millennium Mesopotamian palaces, at
Kish and Eridu, were still standing
only to a height of one or two feet,
the palace walls which we uncovered,
being superimposed, rose to a height
of 20 feet. Being protected by the walls
of the second millennium palace of
Zimri-Lim, destroyed by Hammurabi
about 1770 B.C., they were in a perfect
state of preservation.
Although the palaces at present
being excavated are indeed, for
buildings of their age, of an
extraordinary height and in a
remarkable state of preservation, the
shadow of disaster hangs over them.
The palace of Zimri-Lim was also
magnificently intact in 1939, yet in
the twelve years when it was left
unattended (from 1939 until work was
resumed in 1951) it was seriously
damaged by erosion. The reason is
quite simple: it was built of unbaked
bricks, i.e. sun-dried clay, and as
Hammurabi's soldiers had destroyed
the roofs, everything was now exposed
to the open air and doomed to decay.
Exactly the same fate total des¬
truction awaits the third millennium
palaces excavated between 1964 and
1972 unless something is done.
In its day, Mari, in the Middle
Euphrates region, was one of the most
brilliant centres of Mesopotamian
civilization, the civilization which grew
up in the biblical "Garden of Eden",
a land watered by a river which "when
it left the garden branched into four
streams" (Genesis 2: 10), including the
Euphrates and the Tigris.
It is a civilization whose extraordinary
achievements have been revealed by
over a century of archaeological
research. Museums in the East and
the West alike are full of objects
which offer for our admiration not
only accomplished works of art but
the evidence of human activity in all
its forms.
These objects were the work of
artists and craftsmen whose names
since writing was not discovered
Above, badly mutilated
statue of a worshipper,

1952. It dates from the
first half of the 3rd mille¬
nium B.C. and introduces
a style of sculpture com¬
pletely new at the time.

earth the statue of Ishtup-
ilum, governor of Mari,
dating from the 2nd mill¬
enium B.C. It was found
in the throne room of the
palace of Zimri-Lim at the
foot of a staircase where
it had fallen during the
destruction of Marl by the
Babylonian king Hammu¬
rabi (18th century B.C.).

The eyebrows as well as

until 3000 B.C., must forever be
unknown. Different systems of
writing were evolved in different
countries, hieroglyphics in Egypt,
cuneiform script in Mesopotamia.
Beginning as pictograms, writing
became syllabic and finally, about
1300 B.C., on the eastern Mediter¬
ranean coast, alphabetic. The stage
was now set for great achievements.
The technical developments were
rapid. This is not a subjective view:
Mari was to be a convincing demons¬
tration and a perfect illustration of it.
The palaces of Mari are not only
monuments of Syria's past but also
part of the common heritage of
mankind. One of the aims of Unesco's
programme is to restore and protect
monuments, works of art and natural
sites of universal value threatened
with "deterioration and destruction"
two words which sum up exactly
the dangers which threaten the palaces
of the pre-Sargonid (third millennium)
period at Mari.
Something has to be done, and
done quickly; time is not on our side.
In this respect nature is a ruthless,
destructive enemy and vigorous efforts
must be made to protect the palaces
from its ravages.
