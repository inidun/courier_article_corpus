VENICE AND THE VENETIANS
OF TOMORROW
VE
ENICE is dying and not
only because the ground is sinking
and the sea rising, the trees decaying
and the frescos fading. The buildings,
too; are'slowly falling into ruin, exuding
the death smell of places long un¬
inhabited.
The insular situation that was once
the strength of Venice has become,
with time, a serious handicap. Over
the last two centuries the city has
gradually been deprived of its func¬
tions, first as a State capital, then
as the regional capital. While its
rivals in northern Italy were develop¬
ing with extraordinary speed, the
former Queen of the Adriatic seemed
to have missed the turning that led
to a modern economy, and to have
been immobilized within the confines
of an island grown too small. From
being a community of big land owners,
merchants and lawyers, it gradually
became a city of clerks and civil
servants.
Losing their importance in a world
where industrial production' is a prime
requisite, yet without becoming really
impoverished, the old aristocracy has
suffered, since the fall of the Republic
right up to the present day, from a
sense of having come down in the
world. Hence the temptation to
withdraw more and more, system¬
atically keeping up the traditions of
an illustrious past and rejecting
everything new.
"Venice," wrote Mary McCarthy,
"has always been a foster-mother to
the old." People might go to Venice
to die, but they die at an advanced
age. Titian was a hundred years old
at the time of his death, and even
then he succumbed only to the plague.
Even today, "it's a good place to
grow old in," say the senior citizens
of Venice, whose age it is impossible
to guess.
Venice's population statistics show
that, between ,1871 and 1951, the
In the last ten years the population of
Venice has dropped by 40,000. One
explanation for this exodus is that
Venetians "are fed up with getting their
feet wet every day" as a Unesco report
states. Left, pedestrians make their
way over a causeway of planks laid
across the flooded Square of St. Mark's.
population doubled. But it should be
noted that these figures refer to the
whole commune of Venice, which
includes not only the historic centre
and the islands of Murano and Burano,
but also the estuary and the mainland,
with Marghera and the old neigh¬
bouring communes attached to the
former Venetian Republic. During
this same period, while the population
of the mainland rose by 481 per cent,
and that of the Lido and Malamocco
by 654 per cent, the population of
the old historic centre rose only at
the modest annual rate of 1.2 per cent.
But from 1951 onwards the situation
altered completely. While the popu¬
lation of the mainland and the
estuary has continued to rise, that
of the islands is steadily falling. The
area comprising Venice proper and
the islands of Murano and Burano
shrank from 191,200 inhabitants in
1951 to 135,900 in 1966, representing
an average loss of 3,500 inhabitants
a year.
0
VER the last ten years the
total population of the commune has
increased by 31,000 while the old town
has lost nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Were this loss of population to
continue at an average rate of
2,000 inhabitants a year, the old part
of Venice would have no more than
97,800 inhabitants by 1981in other
words it would have lost over half
its population in thirty years. There
would be more old people than
children and more women than men.
Forty-four per cent of those leaving
the city centre are under thirty and
71 per cent under forty-five. The
emigrants therefore come mainly from
the younger sections of the population.
The effects of the aging of a commu¬
nity on its economic capacities are
only too well known. The proportion
of inactive old people to those gain¬
fully employed was 13 per cent in
the island centre in 1951. Today it
has risen above 19 per cent.
Where do the Venetians go when
they leave the old city? Seventy-eight
per cent stay in the commune and
settle on the mainland or at the Lido.
Today in 1968 about two out of three
Venetians live outside the island
centre either on the mainland or on
the coast.
The number of jobs in the islands
has not decreased in the last fifteen
years. Whereas there has been a
falling off in employment in all bran¬
ches of the primary and secondary
occupations (agriculture, fishing, in¬
dustry and the building trade), the
tertiary sector (commerce and ser¬
vices) has increased in importance.
The most noticeable development has
been in the retail trade, the hotel
industry, banking and insurance, and
various types of services. This in¬
crease is due mainly to the develop¬
ment of the tourist industry.
More foreigners go to Venice in
July, August and September than
during all the other nine months put
together and this seasonal concen¬
tration necessarily has a prejudicial
effect on its economy.
Moreover, as is well known, Venice
has to contend with serious com¬
petition from neighbouring resorts. The
city has too few hotel rooms in
summer; more than half its hotels are
closed in winter. The improvement
of hotel accommodation obviously
depends on the flow of holiday makers
being spread over the whole year.
And it is unrealistic to hope that
investments will be made while the
hotels are full only three months in
the year.
Contrary to popular belief, the
tourist trade is not Venice's mam
source of income. Its traditional crafts,
and the activities of its commercial
port have an equally important place
in its economy.
At first glance, the development of
sea traffic gives no reason for
concern. But the prospects are not
very reassuring. For 1,000 years,
Venice has been one of the most
active ports in the world. But today
the port of Marghera, on the mainland,
is the principal industrial port. Where¬
as the capacity of the old city's port
is 1,800,000 tons, that of the new town
is 15,000,000 tons.
Half the economic activities of the
Venetian commune as a whole are
linked with port activities. In the old
city itself, the livelihood of 20 to
30 per cent of men with families
depends on jobs connected with the
port. If the future of the historic
centre as a port were to be endan¬
gered, its demographic and social ^_
future would surely suffer, for a very jh
large proportion of its population *'*'
would be affected by this economic
transformation. So it is understand-

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS OF TOMORROW (Continued)
Behind the lovely facadea mass exodus
able, that many Venetians choose
to make their living on the mainland.
As the number of jobs in the island
centre has increased since 1951, and
the number of "employable" people
has gone down, there are at present
more jobs in the city (about 12,000)
than there are people to fill them. It
is the first time in their history that
the islands have been short of
manpower.
It is not therefore because they
cannot find work that Venetians are
leaving their ancient home. Nor is
it because they earn less there than
elsewhere wages are higher in the
old town than on the mainland, which
is why Venice manages to bring in
from outside, every day, the 12,000
extra workers that it needs. The main
reason for the gradual depopulation
of Venice is the housing situation.
When the exodus began in 1951, it
was estimated that Venice needed
16,500 new dwellings, apart from the
renovation of existing buildings. In¬
stead, only 2,700 homes were built
between 1951 and 1961. In the
meantime, over 6,000 families, tired
of the conditions in which they were
living, left Venice.
While the rate at which habitations
were being put up grew steadily
slower, the depopulation of Venice
continued. Repairs and improvements
to old dwellings practically ground to
a halt.
By 1966, the situation was com¬
pletely reversed: only 40,000 families
remained in Venice, and there were
too many flats. Venice became, in
this respect, one of Italy's most
privileged cities. One would think that
people would be glad to live there
but they are not. For, compared with
the general European standard of
housing, Venice is definitely under¬
privileged.
A survey made in 1957 showed that
conditions were as deplorable as
regards both the structural repair of
the houses and their sanitation and
habitabihty. Sixty-six per cent of the
housing blocks required major repairs.
Nearly 40 per cent of the dwellings
were either uninhabitable or over¬
crowded. Seventy-five per cent of
the flats had no bathroom. Central
heating was practically non-existent,
and in 60 per cent of the dwellings the
kitchen was the only source of heat.
Besides all this, there were the
disadvantages of poor natural lighting,
dampness and the general incon¬
venience of the premises. Rents are
also higher than anywhere else in Italy,
and maintenance and repair services
are very costly because of the city's
communications problems and diffi¬
culties in transporting materials.
All this is not calculated to en¬
courage people to remain in the old
city. The young complain about the
lack of recreational facilities, when
the space for sports grounds could
easily be found. Venetians accepted
such living conditions for centuries,
because they were no worse than
elsewhere. But they are worse now,
since new towns have sprung up
everywhere and the discrepancy
between housing facilities in island
Venice and on the mainland has re¬
cently become greater. It is the
houses of Mestre and the Lido,
commonplace but comfortable, which
for fifteen years have been attracting
so many Venetians.
The basic problem, therefore, is
that of restoring, improving and mod¬
ernizing existing dwellings. It is not
enough merely to save the palaces
and mansions from destruction; it is
equally urgent to make the town

of its narrow canals

problems of Venice and
its people. According to
the special study made
by Unesco, 47 per cent
of Venice's buildings are
in need of repair,
16 per cent are gravely
dilapidated and 50 per
cent are damp-infested.
The renovation of
housing in Venice is an
urgent task, but the
cost will be enormous.

Building the new image of Venice
habitable, not only for its citizens,
but also for the visitors it is seeking
to attract.
For several centuries Venice has
been a weary city, but she has never
given up the struggle. The people
are used to seeking for ways and
means of making up for the loss of
traditional sources of income wherever
they are to be found.
Obliged to offer services which
could not be found elsewhere Venice
finally adopted, in 1917, a formula
which was then new to Italy: that of
the industrial port. The idea, to quote
the originator of the project, was "to
bring ships to the factory doors."
Instead of being, like a merchant
port, a place where goods are kept
in bond or in transit, the new port was
to be a vast complex of factories.
And so Marghera was created. This
new Venetian town was not built on
the mainland proper, but on 550 hec¬
tares of barene (sand-banks) rein¬
forced with soil from the lagoon bed
and raised to a height of some eight
feet above sea level. Factories were
being set up even before the port
was finished.
The pressure of expanding industry
soon forced Marghera to breaking
point, and a second industrial zone
was begun, now to be followed by a
third, much more ambitious than the
other two. The ground on which the
third zone will be built is still being
consolidated. The new industrial,
commercial and oil ports will not be
functioning fully until 1980. But there
are already 21 1 companies in Marghera
employing 40,000 workers.
HI AS the old town benefited
appreciably up to now from the pro¬
gress made by industry on the main¬
land? The increase of traffic in the
port does not affect it, as this consists
mainly of supplies for industry itself,
and of oil, the unearned increment on
which goes to foreign investors. The
municipal budget has derived hardly
any wealth from the mainland.
The new town costs the municipality
more than it brings in, and improve¬
ments needed to schools, the road
system, public transport and cultural
amenities would cost quite as much
as the restoration of the historic part
of the city.
As a result, Venetians on both sides
of the lagoon complain of having to
pay heavier taxes than the inhabitants'
of other large towns. The modern
town was to be a fine example of
town-planning. It is nothing of the
sort. The traffic jams and parking
problems in Mestre are enough to
make the inhabitants pine for the quiet
calli of historic Venice. Water and
electricity supplies and the drainage
system present problems as complex
as those of purifying the water of the
lagoon, and the mainland itself is
periodically threatened by floods. The
destiny of Venice is indeed difficult
to shake off!
Legislation has it that the islands
and the mainland form a single
commune. But the necessary inter¬
communication between the old city
and the mainland still has to be
established. The Venetians hardly
know where their city begins and
ends. When we speak of the
depopulation of Venice, we are not
thinking of the commune, since its
population is increasing; and when
the inhabitants of Venice go to live
in Mestre, they have the feeling of
moving, not to another district, but
to another town. The mainland is
another country, another way of life,
another society.
Business concerns recognize this
Banks, insurance companies and
department stores know they would
lose customers among the mainland
population (that is, two Venetians out
of three) if they did not open branches
in Mestre, pending the transfer of their
headquarters there.
It is not only the people on the
mainland who feel they belong to a
different world. Most of the Venetians
in the old town feel that the industrial
development of Marghera does not
concern them. The initiative of the
money, the organization and the staff
of this industrial complex come from
Milan, they say, and the products are
not sold in Venice to the Venetians
but in Milan to the Milanese. Nothing
can convince Venice that the develop¬
ment of the mainland will not in the
end continue independently of the old
city, and even at its expense.
However much goodwill they show,
Venice and the mainland are bound
to separate sooner or later, unless
the island centre really needs
Marghera, and vice versa.
Cities everywhere in the world are
trying to decentralize their activities
and divide up work among their
different districts, so as to solve
zoning problems. They all aim at
becoming "polycentric." Venice al¬
ready is.
Better housing and easier and faster
means of communication are what the
Venetians most often demand. Some
innovators have proposed various
solutions to the water-traffic problem-
"waterbugs" (silent, electric mini-
taxis), amphibious buses and hydro¬
foils; but the effect of the waves
set up by such powerful craft would
probably be disastrous for the city's
ancient buildings.
Land transport has been, and still
is, the subject of heated argument.
Some say that a new bridge must be

Problems of urban
communication and the high
cost of transporting building
materials are serious
obstacles to the upkeep of
buildings in Venice, which are
falling into disrepair (right,
portico of a house which has
tumbled into the San Severo
canal, now closed because of
such hazards). The
40,000 families who live in
Venice would like to see an
improvement in their housing
and also a modernization of
communications within their
city and with the mainland
(above, a boat follows the
twisting channels between the
marshy banks of the lagoon
which appear at low tide).
Plans are being studied for
an underground railway to
link the various parts of the
city and to connect with the
mainland (top left, model of
the underground as it would
run beneath the Grand Canal).

built to take the increasing traffic
between Venice and the mainland.
Others say, on the contrary, that all
road and rail links ought to be cut,
so that Venice may preserve its island
character.
Plans for a motorway which would
run the whole length of the old city
have already been turned down by the
authorities. Instead, it has been
proposed that an overhead railway
be built on pylons almost 100 feet
(about 30 metres) high, with some parts
of the track disappearing discreetly
underground. However, the pylons
would still mar the beauty of the
lagoon.
For aesthetic reasons, consideration
has been given to a possible system
of underground communications:
tunnels under certain canals, dup¬
licating bridges and ferry-crossings,
and, the most ambitious project of all
an underground railway linking the city
centre to the mainland, with a possible
extension to Padua and Treviso.
The Italian authorities have closely
studied this project. It would, of
course, take years to carry out, but
it would help to save Venice by
reducing the congestion of water
traffic, particularly on the Grand Canal
and the Rio Nuovo, and would, at the
same time, do away with the water
turbulence that threatens the city's
buildings.
An effort to restore to Venice the
kind of vitality it enjoyed at other
periods in its history, and which would
satisfy the demands of the modern
world, should not merely seek to
preserve its population by providing
up-to-date housing and commu¬
nications, or to develop its commerce
and industry. Such a Venice would no
longer be Venice.
Development everywhere is as much
a cultural as an economic and techno¬
logical problem. The cultural life of
Venice will be significant and command
respect only if it reflects a genuine
physical, economic and social vitality.
Cultural development must always
set the pace.
For centuries now, the University of
Venice has been situated in Padua.
However, a number of people actively
concerned with cultural development
want to make the old city of Venice
an international centre of higher
education.
Such a project would involve the
setting-up of a number of univer¬
sity institutions; faculties of social
sciences, arts, the history of art, mari¬
time studies, institutes of town
planning and architecture and an
international university of traditional
crafts. The Venice city council has
already adopted a scheme for sett¬
ing up an international Centre for
Engineering Sciences, which would
occupy the Palazzo Fortuny.
The idea would be to make Venice
a modern version of ancient Athens,
where students, research workers and
thinkers from all countries would find
a place for reflection, work and
discussion. It is with this in mind
that 500 students from universities in
Canada and the United States are
being invited to study in Venice in
1969. This movement ought to develop
and spread, but if it is to do so,
young people from all over the world
must find in Venice young people to
welcome them.
The Venice Biennale illustrates the
city's traditional concern with cultural
enrichment. As early as 1895, the
International Exhibition of Modern Art
was revealing avant-garde talent, as
well as organizing retrospective
exhibitions of painting and sculp¬
ture. Since then the Biennale has
expanded to include an impressive
programme of events: international
drama and film festivals, concerts and
so on. There is obvious scope for the
development of such programmes in
the future.
As for the tourist trade, who can
deny that Venice needs it? And yet,
Venetian students have angrily
denounced tourism as an evil. There
is undoubtedly a form of tourism which
is scarcely more profitable to Venice
than to the tourists themselves.
Hordes of tourists invade Venice each
summer and take away little more
than photographs of pigeons.
Cultural development plans would
therefore aim to change the image
of Venice, to enable the city to give
of its best to all its visitors and not
only to a few sophisticates or to the
"jet set" members of international
society who seek amusement at balls
and in the casinos.
The cultural development of Venice
as a factor in the preservation of this
irreplaceable city will fail unless full
advantage is taken of future promise
as well as past glories.
Nothing is as yet settled; everything
is still possible even that Mestre may
one day become the regional capital,
with Venice as a dying suburb. Then
perhaps the very people who fought
for this isolation, and who resisted
change, will leave it in their turn.
And the work of men who chose to
consider man a danger will be handed
over to the old enemies, salt and
water, which will inexorably gnaw
away at the city's already crumbling
stones.
This is what would happen if daring,
ambition, eagerness to move onwards
in a word, youth were to leave
Venice and settle on the mainland,
as if in a foreign country. It will not
happen if Venice remembers what she
has been for the last 1,000 years an
incomparable centre of culture, a city
invigorated by its lust for life and
confidence in the future.
