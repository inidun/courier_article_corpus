In the aftermath of the explosion
of reactor no. 4 at the Chernobyl
(Ukraine) nuclear power plant on
26 April 1986, more than 4 million
people living in Belarus, Ukraine
and Russia were exposed to radia¬
tion. "The Chernobyl disaster is
now recognized as having been the
greatest technological catastrophe
in human history," writes Belaru-
sian geneticist V. K. Savchenko in
his recently published study The
Ecology of the Chernobyl Cata¬
strophe (see bibliography at end of
article).
More than 1.7 million persons
are estimated to have been exposed
to higher than normal levels of radi¬
ation; 850,000 of them still live in
the contaminated areas, and
280,000 should be relocated but
have nowhere to go. For ten days on
end burning graphite in the reactor
spewed radioactive gas and aerosol
particles into the atmosphere.
Nearly 50 million curies1 in all, or
77 kilograms of various radioactive
substances (the most lethal being
iodine-131, caesium-134 and -137,
stronlium-90 and pIutonium-239),
were cast over extensive distances
(from 300 to 400 kilometres),
while lighter air-borne particles
drifted to countries as far away as
the United States, India and
Kuweit.
'HALF-LIFE' WORSE
THAN 'NO-LIFE'
The full impact of the ecological
disaster can be measured by
studying the half-life2 of iodine-
131 (8 days), caesium-134 (8 days),
strontium-90 (28 days), caesium-
137 (30 days) and plutonium-239
(24,100 years!). The half-life of a
substance has to be multiplied by
an average of 10 or 15 to under
stand how long it will take for
radioactive substances to disappear
entirely from the environment.
Despite its short half-life,
iodine-131 is the most harmful ele¬
ment for the moment. The human
organism needs iodine, but unfor¬
tunately it does not distinguish
between the stable clement and the
radioactive one. Merely inhaled or
lodged in the food chain, it settles
in the thyroid gland where it can
cause cancer. Children and babies
arc especially vulnerable.
Because of their high solubility,
caesium-137 and strontium-90 are
the principal culprits in contami¬
nating soil and plants, which they
enter via the root-system. Concen¬
trated in the food chain, they settle
in the muscles (caesium-137) and
on bone surfaces (strontium-90).
Strontium-90 replaces calcium in
the bone marrow, thereby opening

the door to blood diseases such as
anaemia and leukemia.
Plutonium is, however, the most
dangerous element by far (the
intake of a single microgram is
lethal to human beings). The heav¬
iest of the elements released by
Chernobyl, it is not easily absorbed
by plants and is radioactive only
over a short distance. Its fallout
was minimal and affected the
immediate vicinity of the power
station, an area thereby condemned
to several tens of thousands of years
of dangerous sterility.
SURVIVING IN THE
CONTAMINATED AREAS
The disaster's ecological effects
apart from the harm done to human
life are still largely unknown.
Grassy plains and fields and flat, bare
ground are the kinds of terrain that
are most seriously contaminated.
Some 144,000 hectares of agricul¬
tural land and 492,000 hectares of
forest have 'been withdrawn from
normal use over a long period.
Radionuclides concentrated in the
sediment at the bottom of standing
water (lakes, swamps, reservoirs and
the like), are absorbed by animal and
plant life. In the forest radioactivity
concentrates in tree bark, moss,
lichen and mushrooms and in leaves
and pine needles, which contaminate
the soil when they fall to the ground.
In some areas it is forbidden to
gather firewood. When burned, the
wood contaminates ovens, and its ash
used as fertilizer contaminates soil
and crops.
A lot of pastureland is unusable.
Forage from the wet plains, which
is extremely contaminated, can only-
he used as a last resort. Dairy prod¬
ucts must not be consumed before
being specially processed. Around
Chernobyl milk is used as an indi¬
cator of the contamination level;
when milk is acceptable for con¬
sumption, other products from the
same farm can also be consumed.
In response to the thousand and
one questions asked by the stricken
populations, Belarus has produced
a 55-page booklet entitled Radia¬
tion: How to Survive in the Radia¬
tion Contaminated Areas. Potatoes
and grain crops are the food crops
least prone to contamination.
Among fruit and berries red and
black currants are more liable to
contamination than apples and
pears. The booklet strongly urges
people who grow their own produce
to use mineral (phosphorus and
potassium) and organic (manure,
guano and humus) fertilizers in
their gardens and orchards because
these seem to prevent the plants
from absorbing radionuclides.
The booklet gives a lot of down-
to-earth advice on the best
methods for washing, cooking and
preserving food. Salting and mari¬
nating meat, for example, is one of
the best ways to rid it of caesium-
137, which stays in the brine. Gen¬
erally speaking, poultry and cattle
may be consumed if they have been
penned in and fed only uncontami-
nated (imported) food for a month
or a month and a half before being
slaughtered. Meat and animal by¬
products must undergo a radiolog¬
ical test. A network of labs and
monitoring centres has been devel¬
oped for this purpose.
It is strongly recommended to
keep houses dust-free, to leave
working clothes outdoors, to wash
often with soap, not to wash clothes
in rainwater, to wear face-masks for

certain activities, to drink plenty of
diuretic and laxative infusions and
eat food rich in protein, vitamins
and mineral salts in order to
strengthen the body's defences. It
takes several months for the human
body to eliminate caesium.
MENTAL HARDSHIP
Obeying this advice is unfortunately
not possible for the 400,000 dis¬
placed persons who are now penni¬
less and jobless in a region they do
not know. They are tortured by the
fear that they are harbouring some
terrible disease caused by radiation.
Is their pessimism justified? Are
they right to fear the worst?
UNESCO'S CHERNOBYL PROGRAMME
Unesco has an ongoing programme to aid the countries
affected by the Chernobyl disaster by means of operations to
remedy its consequences and to promote economic and social
development in the areas concerned.
Twenty-nine Unesco Member States are taking part in the
programme, which has some 150 full-time employees working
in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The programme's financial
resources currently amount to more than $9 million.
In consultation with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, Unesco
has proposed more than 70 projects in its fields of compe¬
tence (education, science, culture, communication and social
science), some thirty of which are underway or have already
been completed.
Nine community development centres for social and psy¬
chological rehabilitation have been set up in the worst-hit com¬
munities. Since they were opened in 1993, they have received
nearly 160,000 visitors, the vast majority of whom have been
children (90,000) and young adults (almost 40,000).
Teaching materials on the themes of energy, the environ¬
ment and development incorporate lessons learned from the
Chernobyl disaster and highlight alternative energy sources.

To help Chernobyl victims cope
with psychological and social disor¬
ders triggered by the disaster, since
1991 UNESCO has opened nine com¬
munity centres for children and
adults in the resettlement areas
near the stricken region. A World
Health Organization (WHO) Con¬
ference on the health consequences
of Chernobyl, held in November
1995, noted that the increase in
psychological problems has been
accompanied by a marked rise in
thyroid cancer in children under-
fifteen in Belarus, (a thirty-fold rise
since 1986), and in Ukraine, where
the numbers of such eases have
increased at least ten-fold.
Scientists believe that the rates
of leukemia and other blood ail¬
ments, as well as breast cancer,
bladder cancer and kidney diseases
could also increase over the next
few years. Studies carried out in
Japan ten years after the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki showed a sharp rise in the
incidence of these diseases.
Although preliminary reports on
the state of health of the workers
(some 600,000 "liquidators")
brought to Chernobyl in the first
weeks after the accident show no
increase in death-rates, they do
reveal a big jump in the incidence
of common ailments, a high rate of
neuropsychological disorders and
premature aging.
GLACIERS: NATURE'S ARCHIVES
OF NUCLEAR ACTIVITY
The psycho-social effects experi¬
enced by the affected populations
were singled out for priority at the
WHO conference. "In particular,"
noted Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima,
Director-General of WHO, "these
have included anxiety over the pos¬
sible ill effects of radiation on their
health in the long term. Originally,
much fear and mistrust had
occurred because of the lack of
information immediately after the
accident, which caused many psy¬
chosomatic disorders". Headaches,
chest pains, intestinal disorders,
sleep disturbance, loss of concentra¬
tion, and alcohol abuse are common¬
place. Similar psycho-social effects
can be observed in the wake of
earthquakes, fires, floods and other
natural and man-made disasters.
According to psychologist Lubow
Ilorich, co-ordinator of the nine
rehabilitation centres, "People . . .
continue to be suspicious of most
information available". Fact-gath¬
ering in the nuclear field is hard;
tempers flare quickly; fact and fic¬
tion intertwine. Some people
believe, for example, that radioac¬
tive contamination is contagious;
others believe that red wine and
vodka neutralize radiation!
Chernobyl is the eighth nuclear
accident of which glaciologists have
found undeniable traces in glaciers.
Glaciers have also recorded all the
atmospheric nuclear tests carried
out by the major powers between
1954 and 1963. Snow and ice
imprison all radioactive elements
carried by air currents. Moreover, it
is impossible to confuse natural and
artificial radionuclides. Radioactive
fallout acts as a reference level for
glaciologists, enabling the different
layers of snow to be accurately
dated. This means that it is futile to
try to hide or minimize the facts:
nuclear safety goes far beyond mere
national boundaries.
