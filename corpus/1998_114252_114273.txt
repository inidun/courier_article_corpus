Internet users are among the world’s
most closely observed specimens of
h u m a n i t y.Consultants and marketing
e x p e rts scrutinize them, monitor their
desires and anticipate their reactions, f o r
they know the future of the inform at i o n
e c o n o my is in their hands. D ata about them
is everywhere.
But the character of the Internet (or
Net) user is changing all the time. In the
v i rtual wo r l d ’s Stone A g e , in the 1970s, t h e
Net was the preserve of a tiny, ve ry uniform
group of specialized researchers. G r a d u a l l y
it spread to a rather wider group of univer-
sity people and computer experts.
D u ring the “Bronze A g e ” , which ended
with the invention of the World Wide Web1
in 1992, the typical “netizen” was easy to
describe. He was a highly educated, com-
f o rt a b l y - o f f, English-speaking white male
around thirty years old,living in a town or
c i t y. This is still pretty much true today.
Netizens are still mostly young A n g l o -
Saxon adults with some kind of higher edu-
cation earning about $50,000 a year.
“This image is out of dat e ,” h owe ve r ,
says Frenchman Christian Huitéma, who
works for the US telecommunications firm
B e l l c o r e .“As time passes, the typical Inter-
net user is becoming more and more like
the average citizen.This trend is bound to
continue.”
S e veral recent developments confirm
his analysis. First there has been a tremen-
dous influx of women into cyberspace.At
the beginning of 1994, only five per cent of
I n t e rnet users were wo m e n . To d ay the
figure is 38 per cent, according to surveys.
Their initial absence is easily explained.
“The Internet first developed among engi-
n e e rs and technicians, few of whom are
wo m e n ,” s ays Huitéma. C h ristine Maxwe l l ,
of the Internet Society, says that “because
of the kind of work most women do, they
h ave less opportunity to connect to the Net
from their workplace.But they are logging
on more and more from home as computer
prices drop.”
This ye a r , according to several sources,
more women than men have become Net
u s e rs for the first time. Some 52 per cent of
people who have been connected for less
than a year are wo m e n . But the situat i o n
varies greatly around the world.In Europe

The major countries of the South, h owe-
ve r , seem to be advancing at top speed.T h e
c o m m u n i c ations group Saatchi and Saat c h i
Worldwide reports that the Internet is gr o-
wing twice as fast in Latin A m e rica than
a nywhere else: it grew by 788 per cent there
b e t ween 1995 and 1997, while globally the
Net is only doubling in size each ye a r.At the
end of October, the US market research firm
IDC admitted it was “ s u rp ri s e d ” at the
expansion of the Internet in China, w h i c h
by 2001 is expected to be second only to
Japan in number of people connected.
New languages 
on the Web
The entry of people from the South into
cyberspace has introduced new languages
to the We b , and this is an atttraction for
n o n - E n g l i s h - s p e a k e rs.All studies show that
people prefer connecting to sites in their
own language, e ven if they know English
we l l . At the start of the 1990s, E n g l i s h
dominated almost all the Web. Now it only
accounts for three-quart e rs of it, a c c o r d i n g
to a study by the Agence de la Francopho-
nie,which monitors use of the French lan-
guage.
S p a n i s h , Po rt u g u e s e , G e rm a n , Ja p a-
n e s e , Chinese and Scandinavian languages
are steadily gaining ground.Two big tech-
nological advances have helped along this
multilingual env i r o n m e n t ,s ays Ja p a n ’s To ru
Nishigaki, of Tokyo University. One is the
i nvention of an intern ational system of
coding characters, which has made it pos-
sible to use non-Latin alphabets.The other
is the gr owth of translation progr a m m e s
inside search engines.

and South A f ri c a , a quarter of all Net users
are women, compared with 25 per cent in
Brazil and New Zealand and 40 per cent
in the United States. In the Middle East,
the figure is only four per cent.The virtual
world closely mirr o rs the real one where
equality between the sexes is concerned.
But Maxwell thinks things will change:
“In Saudi Arabia, which has barely begun
to connect up to the Net, women are not
a l l owed to dri ve motor ve h i c l e s. But they’r e
d riving along the inform ation highway, a n d
that will change a lot of things.”
The Internet is also increasingly popu-
lar with young people. Student Monitor
m a g a z i n e , which does a survey each ye a r
of American students’ favourite pastimes,
s ays nearly three-quart e rs of those asked
said Net-surfing was the coolest thing to
d o. Up until now, their favo u rite activity
has always been beer dri n k i n g . In the coun-
t ries of the South, new Net users are yo u n-
ger than elsewhere. In the Middle East and
Asia, the average user is under thirty.
Americans a minority 
among Net users
The trend towards younger users goes
along with a slight fall in the level of edu-
c at i o n , especially in the United Stat e s.
There are fewer Master’s degrees and
Ph.Ds among Net newcomers than among
the “ e x p e rts”—those who have been on line
for more than four year s. The newcomers
also cover a broader range of activities:
fewer than one in ten works in computers,
compared with one in three in 1994.They
are also a bit less well off: only 30 per cent
earn more than $50,000 a year, as against
50 per cent four years ago.
These socio-economic shifts are cou-
pled with changes in the geography of the
Internet.The US research firm Emarketer
says 1998 was a landmark in the history of
cyberspace. For the first time, Americans
became a minority among Net users. I n
1 9 9 5 ,t wo-thirds of all Net users were A m e-
rican.
But Europe still lags behind and the
continent is not geared to catch up, s ay s
Fo rrester Research, a firm which predicts
t h at in 2001, only 13 per cent of Europeans
will be connected to the Net compared
with 40 per cent in the United Stat e s. I t
at t ri butes this big gap to the cost of tele-
A cybercafé in Moscow.
‘In Saudi Arabia, which has barely begun to connect up to
the Net, women are not allowed to drive motor vehicles.
But they’re driving along the information highway, and
that will change a lot of things’

Another change under way is the trans-
f o rm ation of the Net user into a cy b e r -
c o n s u m e r. Until now, he or she has been
mainly interested in finding inform at i o n
and contacting other people—witness the
huge success of discussion forums and chat
gr o u p s. N ow, people are starting to use the
Net to go shopping. In the United States,
more than a third of users have already
bought something on the Net, a c c o r d i n g
to Nielsen Media Research. A quarter of
all A m e ricans who want to buy a car have a
look at manufa c t u r e rs ’ sites and those of
consumer groups.
Net-shopping is getting to be a habit in
other countries too. S u rveys in France,
New Zealand and South Africa show that
b e t ween 60 and 80 per cent of Net users are
interested in it, e ven if only a few have
actually bought anything yet.Their hesita-
tion comes from doubt about the security
of payment methods, unwillingness to fill in
purchasing forms for fear of where the
information might end up, and reluctance
to have anything to do with goods they can-
not actually touch.



The domain 
of the wealthy
The “netizen”is becoming an unexceptio-
nal figure as the Internet reaches more and
more people. But the trend towards uni-
ve rsal Net access also increases cert a i n
i n e q u a l i t i e s , e ven in the United Stat e s ,
where computers cost less and it is cheap to
log on. The US Commerce Depart m e n t
r e p o rted in August that despite the gr ow i n g
number of people who own a computer and
h ave Internet access, l ow-income ru r a l
p e o p l e , single-parent families and those
with less than eight ye a rs of schooling have
little opportunity to connect to it. T h e
r e p o rt also said the ethnic gap was wide-
ning too: 40.8 per cent of white households
h ave access to the Net, compared with only
19.3 per cent of Afro-Americans and 19.4
per cent of Hispanics.
On a world scale,Africa is being sideli-
n e d . Its share of Net users (outside of South
Africa) fell from 0.025 per cent in 1997 to
0.022 per cent in 1998, according to the
World Bank.The typical A f rican Net user is
either a South A f rican or a highly-educat e d
rich man. Tom Butterly, head of the Zim-
b a b we firm Inform ation Management
Consultants,reckons that 700,000 of Afri-
c a ’s barely one million Net users live in
South A f ri c a .The connection cost of about
$65 a month—half a teacher’s salary — i s
still a disincentive. In the rich countries it
costs only about $20.
But Huitéma does not think the Inter-
net will be the domain of the we a l t hy for
much longer. “The Net is eventually going
to spread like television did. I remember
when television arrived in the small village
in Brittany (western France) where I grew
u p. It was a luxury. These day s , you fin d
television sets everywhere,even in shanty-
towns.” ■
