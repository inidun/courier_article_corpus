T HROUGH DOGON EY ES
◗ Text by Antonin Potovski
Long seen only through the lens of tourists, the Dogons have now started to photograph
themselves. Seven young villagers record their own people’s gentle daily lives
◗ Antonin Potovski has been working as a
photographer in Mali since 1996 and is preparing a
book entitled Les cahiers dogons (“The Dogon
Notebooks”). A forthcoming book prepared with
Bernard Faucon, La Plus Belle Route du Monde
(“The World’s Most Beautiful Road”), is soon to be
published by POL. The following photographs are
a selection from an exhibition taking place this fall
at the French record store Fnac.

In the Dogon villages at the foot of
the Bandiagara cliff, or perched on
the cliff-top overlooking the gr e at
plain that stretches to the Burkina Fa s o
b o r d e r , young people can always be found
busily writing letters to tourists who have
visited them.They fill small exercise books
with captioned drawings of the villages’
t o u rist trademarks: the masked dance, t h e
f u n e r a l s , the water bearers , the togouna
(the hut where villagers discuss their prob-
lems) and the separate storage caves for
men and wo m e n .
For three weeks in May 1999, a week in
September the same year and another one
in May 2000, I handed over my digi t a l
camera to two girls aged 13 and 15 and five
b oys between 15 and 29 so they could
extend their efforts at describing this wise
and gentle world to photogr a p hy.
Dogon teenagers rarely mess around.
From a ve ry early age, they are exposed to
the hard work crucial for surv i val in a
s e m i - a rid env i r o n m e n t . Since the villagers ’
well-being depends on them and their
i nvo l vement in a host of daily chores, t h e
classic problems encountered by urban
t e e n a g e rs are not felt here. If their pic-
tures seem mat u r e , poised and perfectly
framed—almost “ p r o f e s s i o n a l ” in appear-
ance—the reason lies in the thoughtfulness
and care they bring as much to the camera
as to their daily tasks.
The boys took the camera with them
on walks through the villages, or onto the
gr e at sand dune where in the evening they
practice wrestling for the festivities that
f o l l ow work in the fie l d s , at the end of the
r a i ny season.They also ventured up steep
p at h ways in the cliff, piercing through
openings in the rock, climbing up ladders
made of tree trunks notched with steps
and dangling over the void to reach the
storage caves and grottoes of the ancient
Tellem people (see box ) , where today the
Dogons bu ry their dead.These are sacred
places which strangers are not allowed to
v i s i t , but where Dogon children frolic hap-

being in charge of the camera for a whole
d ay.
These young villagers had no notion of
p h o t o gr a p hy aside from the touri s t s ’
l e g a cy : a few magazines cut out to decorat e
the earthen walls of their bedrooms, s o m e
t r avel books about tribal peoples in which
they feat u r e , and the sight of foreigners
aiming their lenses at the villages and its
i n h a b i t a n t s. An image they never saw,
unless the tourists in question posted a
few photos back to them as a memento of
their visit. G i ven that I was not around
when the pictures were taken, the only
advice I gave to the young photogr a p h e rs
was what I said as the photos were being
s o rted out. The ones we didn’t keep
because of a silly look on someone’s fa c e ,
a bad angle or the wrong light proved ve ry
useful in explaining how a better picture
could have been shot.
O ver the course of these miniat u r e
advice sessions, the seven photogr a p h e rs
s t a rted to pay more attention to angles,
framing and light, as in one picture
s h owing an assortment of items taken from
one photogr a p h e r ’s room and arr a n g e d
on a ye l l ow earthen step.The Dogons have
n e ver seen nor heard of still-life, so they
i nvented it to depict the colour of objects
i n s t e a d , they serve as a backdrop to much
more personal aspects of their live s.
T h e y take photos of their games, t h e
e n c o u n t e rs that pepper their daily live s ,t h e
long hours of enforced inactivity stretched
out on straw mats or on the scorching
rocks until the terri fic heat gi ves way to
n i g h t fa l l . Or their sorties to gather wild
f ru i t , brought down from the treetops by
t h r owing sticks, or hunting small animals
with home-made cat a p u l t s. E ve ry eve n i n g
I went through the photos, s u rr o u n d e d
by a dozen people peering into the
c a m e r a ’s tiny viewe r , and decided which
shots to keep and which to discard to make
room on our diskettes for the next day ’s
s h o t s. Out of 2,000 pictures taken, I kept
7 0 . The Dogons were more interested in
seeing the photos they had taken than in
the selection process. A b ove all, t h e y
e n j oyed wa n d e ring in search of ideas and
p i l y, p l aying with human skulls and bones,
and dressing up for fun in dance costumes
stored in the centuries-old cave rn s.
The girls did not venture as far afie l d .
They visited their female friends and we n t
for walks with them, taking photos of their
village and their school, where wader birds
and Dogon dancers are painted on the
classroom wa l l s.They also photogr a p h e d
a sandstorm that whipped up one eve n i n g
behind the high millet stems protecting
their storage caves before putting the
camera away moments later to protect it
from dust. M a ny of their photos were taken
in court ya r d s , which are much more the
domain of the village women than its men-
f o l k . Aside from the unhurried time spent
by the girls in the court ya r d s , taking shots
of their friends talking, teasing and
cracking jokes with one another, there is
little difference between the pictures taken
by male or female hands.
Until now, p h o t o graphic depictions of
Dogon life have concentrated on cultural
and social aspects, such as festivities,
building styles, crafts and religious activ-
i t i e s. But when the Dogons themselve s
take the pictures, they barely pay any at t e n-
tion to these feat u r e s.The special charac-
t e ristics of their culture are not the subject;
These young villagers 
had no notion 
of photography aside 
from the tourists’ legacy.

Scaling the cliffs where the Tellems once made their homes, hidden perilously high above the plains.
At play in the trees: the Dogons snap their everyday lives.

Hunting for prey with home-made catapults.
A ritual disguise for the rainy season festivities.
Gathering wild fruit, a favourite pastime for young Dogons.

and adobe, and to show the delightful sun-
light that streams into a room. And wa n-
d e ring in fli p - flops along barely discern i b l e
p aths through the rocks, or in the maze of
p a s s a g e ways where houses stand among
huge rocks fallen from the cliff, or in the
quiet of grottoes and court ya r d s , they also
i nvented the first photographic record of
the Dogons by the people themselve s. ■
“ T HE ONES 
WE FOUND ”
Around 700,000 people live in Dogon country ,
a vast region 50,000 sq. km in size that
stretches from the Burkina Faso border in the east
to the area of Sévaré in the west. The land extends
over the entire length of the 150 km Bandiagara
cliff, which rises at times to 300 metres in height.
The Dogon people hail originally from the
Manding mountains on the border between Mali
and Equatorial Guinea. As animists, the Dogons
refused to convert to Islam and were forced into
exile in the 18th century, moving up the Niger
delta until they reached the protection of the
plateau and the Bandiagara cliff. There, they
made contact with a people who lived in the
cliff-face and bequeathed their cultural legacy
to the newcomers before disappearing in mys-
terious circumstances. They were the Te l l e m s ;
or, as the Dogons call them, “the ones we found.” 
N owadays, cultural tourism has developed
along the great cliff. Encouraged by the Malian
government, this new activity has helped impov-
erished villages take concerted action against the
spread of the desert and work to improve health
and education, while simultaneously imperilling
one of humanity’s most extraordinary cultures.

Stifling days made hotter by desert wind can make life unbearable. For most, it is an imposed time of rest.
Inside the cliff grottoes, young explorers find ancient dance costumes from the times of the Tellem.

Photography was approached with the same care and dignity as any other daily task.
Young girls gently tease each other in the village courtyards.

Villagers gather around the baobab trees to savour the day.
A new school building, decorated with paintings of Dogon dancers, was inaugurated with a party for which the whole village chipped in.

A sandstorm darkens the sky.
To capture colour and light, the Dogons invented still-life anew. Objects sit on an earthen step.
