A TRICOLOUR T R I U M P H ?
France’s recent footballing successes have been hailed as victories over racism,
but discrimination lingers on
Writing in the liberal English national
newspaper The Guard i a n after the
French World Cup victory in 1998, N i c k
Fraser suggested that “no man or woman
really believed in a multicultural Fr a n c e …
French people probably merely wanted
foreigners to be more like themselves.”
His remark seemed to fly in the face of
Fr a n c e ’s cup-winning exuberance.Just as
major sporting tournaments offer some of
the last spaces in which notions of identity
and nation can be ritually expressed and
c e l e b r a t e d , victory can also seem to
b r e a c h ,or even dissolve, racial differences
within a country.And the French national
t e a m ’s achievements in winning the Wo r l d
Cup and Euro 2000 were widely credited
as such a triumph over traditional, c u l t u-
rally homogenous nationalism.
The French national team which
achieved these feats displays an incredible
d i v e r s i t y,with many of its stars born outside
of metropolitan Fr a n c e, including Marcel
D e s a i l l y,Patrick Vieira and Lilian Th u r a m .
Others like Youri Djorkaeff,Thierry Henry,
the talismanic Zinedine Zidane and the
Championship Final scorers Sylvain Wi l-
tord and David Tr e z e g u e t ,would qualify as
what Fr a n c e ’s Jean Marie Le Pen,leader of
the extremist National Front party,w o u l d
call “ Français de souche récente,” m e a-
ning that such players are not “ r e a l ”
Frenchmen because their parents were
recent migrants.
French Sports Minister Marie
Georges Buffet stated in the aftermath of
the Euro 2000 victory that the multi-
ethnic side proved France had created a
harmonious society “that could do great
things together.”The prominent presence
of Arab and black citizens among the
celebrating crowds in the capital
appeared to back Buffet’s point, e s p e-
cially given that the French had pre-
viously suburbanized urban poverty and
largely confined its immigrant popula-
tions to the desolate b a n l i e u e ring sur-
rounding Paris.
Notions of diversity, h o w e v e r, can still
be seen as little more than a style of natio-
nalism that assimilates (rather than
excludes) newcomers and insists on one
universal sovereign identity.What mattered
in the victory party was that Arabs and
black 
citizens were cheering for a France whose
identity had already been secured in their
a b s e n c e. Deeper patterns of discrimina-
t i o n had certainly not been resolved.
Paris’ racially stratified geography was
once again apparent the morning after,a s
the same Arab and black citizens lauded as
symbols of a new united France returned
to their homes on the outskirts of the city.
M e a n w h i l e, the multicultural band of
players who won the Euro 2000 trophy
have now returned to luxury homes in
I t a l y, England and Germany where they
play their club football—managed by
white coaches,paid by white directors and
watched by white spectators.
The enduring stereotype
of brain versus brawn
The pretext for these sporting hierar-
chies may well be the culture of Europe’s
former colonial powers, in which white
settlers ruled indigenous “ c o l o u r e d ”p o p u-
lations on the basis of the supposedly
greater rationality of white people as
against the sensuality, lack of emotional
restraint or intelligence of the “ n a t i v e.”
The continuing power and resonance of
such notions were reflected in the inter-
pretation of the outcome of Euro 2000
by the left-wing French daily, L i b é r a t i o n,
which claimed that “ Fr a n c e ’s victory, i t s
s e c r e t , is without doubt based on the win-
ning combination of two styles—physical
and technical.” S a d l y, the metaphor ‘ p h y-
sical = black, technical = white’ is o n l y
thinly disguised within such analyses,
which do little to move beyond the racial
differences implicit within the concept of
