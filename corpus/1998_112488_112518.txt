When international environmental policy
first became a widespread topic of dis-
cussion in the early 1970s, some people
suggested holding industry and states liable for
damage caused by marine pollution.L at e r ,F r a n-
ce’s first Environment Minister, Brice Lalonde,
grabbed headlines by declaring “the polluters will
p ay ” , and state invo l vement in env i r o n m e n t a l
issues was perceived as an encouraging sign.Yet,
25 years later,little progress has been made.
When people hear the words “ m a rine pollu-
t i o n ” , they usually think of accidental fossil fuel
s p i l l s. But most oil slicks are caused by intentio-
nal discharges from ships at sea, which wo u l d
r ather risk being caught in the act and fined than
p ay a special fee to use waste reception fa c i l i t i e s
in harbour. E x p e rience shows that this fee,
which cove rs the cost of waste storage, t r e at m e n t
and disposal, has a perve rse effect by creating an
i n c e n t i ve for tankers to empty their holds at sea
to avoid paying it. If it were automatically inclu-
ded in the overall harbour fee, the fin a n c i a l
i n c e n t i ve to dump at sea would disappear and
m a rine pollution would be reduced.This theory
was proven when a pilot project implemented
b e t ween 1988 and 1991 by German L ä n d e r w i t h
seacoasts led to a significant decline in the num-
ber of oil-coated birds, d e m o n s t r ating the mea-
s u r e ’s effective n e s s.
Without indulging in conspiracy theories,
environmentalists question the ties between the
so-called dirty industries and governments,
including intergove rnmental organizat i o n s.
The Intern ational Maritime Organizat i o n
(IMO), the United Nations agency that regu-
lates shipping, is a case in point. The dues of
IMO member States are determined by the
tonnage of their fleets, which gives countries
with the most super-tankers an obvious advan-
tage. As a result, some IMO delegations inclu-
de members of the oil industry who “repre-
sent” the countries that lend their flags at sea.
IMO says that the fund set up in 1971 to

THE UNESCO COURIER 57
“The Mediterranean is dying!”exclai-
med Captain Ja c q u e s - Y ves Cous-
teau in the late 1960s. His cry of
a l a rm and many others pushed the Mediterr a-
nean countries to try to reverse the degradation
threatening a sea that has cradled several civili-
z ations and intensive trading networks dat i n g
back thousands of years.
The Mediterranean Action Plan, which was
adopted in 1975, focuses on marine pollution.
But the problem originates with land-based
activities, and cannot be dissociated from the
speed of social and economic change and the
almost total lack of planned management of
coastal areas.
The Mediterranean is under gr owing pres-
sures that have increased needs in eve ry area.
The population of the countries around its ri m
is expected to rise from 400 million today to 550
million in 2025, with the eastern and southern
shores accounting for two-thirds of the gr ow t h .
Coastal areas are heavily built up and during the
same period the coastal population will increase
from 150 to 220 million. L a s t l y, t h e
M e d i t e rranean is the wo r l d ’s leading tourist des-
t i n at i o n . It attracted 100 million visitors in 1997
and the figure is set to double by 2025.
These concerns have led to the develop-
ment of a series of alternative scenarios. Some,
based on the continuation of present trends,
forecast a grim future. Alternative scenarios
suggest ways of reversing the damage and pro-
moting sustainable development. Regional co-
operation will be all-important, for the Action
Plan cannot succeed unless the countries on
the northern shores help their southern neigh-
bours. The European-Mediterranean partner-
ship programme launched in 1995 to turn the
basin into an area of peace and a free trade
zone by 2010 may be the first step towards
achieving this goal. ■
