ANALYSIS OF REPLIES
TO A UNESCO COURIER SURVEY



READER PROFILE
We have recently completed an analysis of replies to a
questionnaire that was sent out with the January 1991
issue of the UNESCO Courier to subscribers to the French
edition. The number of replies we received far exceeded
our expectations and in Itself demonstrates the
considerable interest our readers take in the magazine.
Those who took the time and trouble to reply have
provided us with a mine of detailed information about who
they are and what they expect of the Courier. This
information will be invaluable in helping us to further
improve all aspects of the magazine, while remaining
faithful to an editorial formula which readers strongly
endorse.
We hope you will appreciate the improvements we are
planning to introduce in the coming months. Meanwhile,
in response to a wish expressed by many readers who
answered the questionnaire, we are publishing below the
main results of the survey. They give a general profile of
subscribers to the French edition and their verdict on the
first twenty issues of the new formula introduced in 1989.
We should be happy to receive your comments as a reader
of the English edition.
