Revellers in ancient
Greece and Rome

If people who live in countries which
use the Gregorian calendar were
asked why they celebrate the New
Year, the chances are they would reply
that it is because the old year has
ended and they might as well ring in
the new one. Few among them would
be able to explain the real origin of
this deeply-rooted custom, though all
would agree that a new year "changes
something" and that January 1 -"calls
for a celebration".
There are many children who
firmly believe that the arrival of
January 1 means they will get to the
top of the class even without working
for it and even some grown-ups
subconsciously believe that their pres¬
ent troubles and problems will
disappear with the change in dates.
Though they hesitate to put it into
words, lovers often fear that the
change from one year to another cuts
them off from the days when their
love began and in some mysterious way
threatens it. All these people are
obeying instincts born of ancestral
customs going back into the dim and
distant past.
Six-day feast
Human beings have always seen
something fatalistic in the
changing of the years. At one
time or another, almost all peoples
have consulted oracles and the like in
an effort to pierce the future. For the
future suddenly seemed more frighten¬
ing or alluring simply because time
no longer appeared to be following
its normal course. Instead, it was
transformed into something called
"next year" even when this merely
meant "tomorrow". The time that
elapses between December 31 of one
year and January 1 of the next may
easily seem far longer than all the 365
days that have passed since the pre¬
vious January 1.
Just as all peoples have associated
with their celebrations of the changing
of the year the idea of the earth's
apparent death and rebirth, so, all of
them have been conscious of the hope
implicit in the thought of renewal.
All civilizations did not celebrate the
New Year at the same seasons the
Persians, Aztecs, Incas and early
Romans fixed theirs in the spring,
other peoples in January and others
again in midsummer but almost all of
them linked the change from one year
to another with the idea of joy and
hope.
The Persians, for whom fire was a
symbol of divinity, and who began the
year with the spring equinox, marked
this festival with a ceremony which
Herodotus, the Greek historian has
described.
Inside the royal palace the King
awaited the coming of dawn. Suddenly
a knock was heard on the palace door.
"Who is there ?" demanded the King.
"Open", replied a voice, "I am the
messenger of Ormuzd (the supreme
deity) and I bring with me the New
Year".
When the palace door was opened a
young man entered, followed by another
bearing a silver goblet containing
wheat, barley, peas, sesame, rice and
some newly-minted coins. The goblet
was presented to the King who then
sampled the food.
On a signal every door in the palace
was thrown open and the halls were
immediately thronged with people, who
came to celebrate for six days. During
this time, the King, who normally lived
a Spartan existence and who was
always separated from the common
people, was able to eat and drink and
mingle with the crowd. Herodotus
says that he was also allowed to get
drunk and on the first day alone to
dance. At the end of the sixth day the
palace doors were closed again and the
people returned to their homes and
work.
Satyrs and Maenads
Passing from the Persians to the
Greeks we find that in their tra¬
dition of proud independence,
even when as city states they were
linked together politically, they did not
synchronize their calendars. And even
though all of them reckoned in periods
or four full years, or olympiads, start¬
ing from the first full moon after the
summer solstice, each had a different
time for celebrating the first day of
the year.

began the year with the autumn equi¬
nox, the Thebians with the winter
solstice. The Athenians, after follow¬
ing for a time the same pattern as the
Thebians, opted for a new year which
would fall at the time of the summer
full moon during the month of Heca-
tombeon, corresponding to our month
of July.
The Athenians feted Dionysus, the
Olympian god of Nature who had come
from Thrace and Phrygia. He was a
being of many forms guardian of the
plants and trees, a magician who could
take on the form of a goat or a white
oull, coursing the mountains with his
attendant band of Satyrs and Maenads,
who with Dionysus indulged in myster¬
ious orgies. Little by little the cult of
Dionysus mingled with other cults,
became indentified with other gods and
was transformed into the symbol of
rest and re-birth of the soil and of the
migration of the dead from their home
in the underworld.
In the Athenian festival of the
During the banquets the guests
passed a myrtle branch from hand to
hand and recited improvised couplets,
called scolions. The festival continued
with rounds of drinks interspersed with
theatrical productions, songs and
dances. It concluded with a gigantic
torchlight procession through the
streets of Athens, staged as a triumphal
march for Dionysus with Pans and
Satyrs each carrying a gilded lamp and
surrounded by Sileni clothed in purple.
Following these dwellers of the plains
and forests came a youth carrying on
a banner the morning star, and
children clothed in white to symbolize
the new year.
Finally, at the end of the immense
procession came the chariot of the god
crowned with vine leaves. Throughout
the festival there reigned the spirit of
gaiety.
These were the only days throughout
the year when the oracle at Delphi
did not prophesy, because, as she

said, "Apollo, who speaks through me,
is himself taking part in the festival,
and has therefore ceased to inspire
me." But rejoicing ended as night fell
on this first day of the new year.
Things went on as before. "To your
work, slaves," said the free citizens to
their servants, and then, more softly,
us shadows, the Anthesteria is
finished". And the shadows of the
dead returned to their abodes in the
underworld.
Transformed into something much
more commonplace, the Greek festivals
were handed down to Rome, where
after Caesar, the new year was cele¬
brated on the first of January. With
the Romans everything became colossal.
The saturnalia which began on Decem¬
ber 19 and lasted for seven days,
became lost in other festivals, as in the
Rome of those times, there were no
DRAGONS at Luang-Prabang, in Laos and trumpets
in Times Square, where New Yorkers gather on
fewer than 182 obligatory holidays in
the year.
Rome, however, worked on the first
day of the new year as a sort of fore¬
taste of labour and effort. The new
consuls in their white togas consulted
oracles and soothsayers. Mounted on
white horses they paid homage to Jupi¬
ter, who had vanquished the shades of
the night and who was now starting on
his new course. At first cock crow the
people opened the garlanded doors of
their houses, and in each family the
first words spoken were those of good
wishes. Among the gifts and offerings
the Romans placed oak leaves ; a sou¬
venir of the past and of a once sacred
tree.
As in Greece the slaves were also set
free during the saturnalia. The gods
spoke of death and re-birth: the re¬
birth of the soil, barren and dead in the
middle of winter. But in Rome the

emperors were powerful. One day,
Tiberius, distrustful successor to Au¬
gustus, wearied of the new year festivals
with their presents, good wishes and
the tiresome seekers after favours who
gave them. He stopped all the festivi¬
ties, saying that they were a waste of
time. They were, however, re-estab¬
lished by Caligula.
However, not all peoples have cele¬
brated with joy the passing of the old
year and the arrival of the new. Be¬
fore their conquest by the Spaniards,
the Aztecs and the Incas, peoples with
an advanced civilization whose scorn of
death was legendary, viewed with fear
the end of the old year.
This fear was especially heightened
at two periods at the end of each fifty
two years cycle (their equivalent of our
century) and during the last five days
of the year which were considered

New Year's Eve. Each country and place cele¬
brates the birth of the New Year in its own way
'"useless" days since they were not in¬
cluded in the Aztec year of 18 months
each of 20 days.
At these times a terrible fear grip¬
ped the people, the kings and the
priests. What if the sun should fail to
rise again? On the last night of the
year, all fires were put out in the
Empire of the Aztecs. In their houses
the people waited, the King kept a vigil
in his palace and on the top of their
pyramids, the priests stood watching.
When the hour struck life stopped
for a moment throughout the country.
Would the fire light? A priest rubbed
two pieces of wood together above the
heart of a sacrificial victim. There
was a moment of suspense. But the
fire caught and the waiting crowd
spilled out carrying the fire and with
it the joy which was really nothing
more than relief from the danger of
this new year of the spring equinox.
