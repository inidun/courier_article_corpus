The conservation of water
and air quality and the pro¬
tection of plant and animal life are
causes that mobilize plenty of sup¬
port. Soil conservation is a Cin¬
derella in comparison. Little stud¬
ied, little known and neglected in
public policy-making, soil is per¬
haps too humdrum a subject to
attract attention. It is also a dis-
couragingly complex one.
When the earth was less popu¬
lated, its direct users farmers,
foresters and builders respected
this surface layer which is essential
for life. This is no longer the case.
All countries, developed and devel¬
oping alike, are experiencing vari¬
ous forms of land degradation. The
earth's surface is being eviscerated
by mining, pierced with oil wells,
churned up and concreted over. It
is treated with "unnatural" fertil¬
izers, herbicides and pesticides in
order to boost agricultural output.
Can we go on exploiting this nat¬
ural resource indefinitely?
Soil is the thin unconsolidated

to several metres thick) of the

its evolution and distribution,
appeared in the late nineteenth
century. But it is only in the last
fifty-odd years that we have
become familiar with this orga¬
nized environment which, by sus¬
taining ¡liants and animals, nour¬
ishes human societies and is the
basis of agriculture.
A LITTLE-KNOWN STRUCTURE
Soil is divided into three strata or
layers that specialists call "hori¬
zons". They are differentiated by
the proportion of minerals or
organic matter in their composi¬
tion, variations in colour, texture
and porosity, and hy their water
and carbon dioxide content.
The mobile top layer of litter is
easy to observe with the naked
eye. It consists of plant debris
(branches and leaves, pine needles,
dead grass, mosses, seeds and
fruit) and animal debris (corpses
and droppings). Below it is the
humus-rich horizon of brown or
blackish earth containing the

decomposed debris of the litter
and mineral particles brought up
from the deep layers by earth¬
worms. The quality of this hori¬
zon is crucial for plant growth.
While life is largely absent from
its compact parts, it is extremely
intense in channels formed by the
decomposition of dead roots and
holes dug by earthworms. The
third horizon is the interface
between the layer of humus and
the parent rocks. Lighter-coloured
than humus, it contains sand,
gravel, silts and clays.
Soil performs many functions,
but four of them are particularly
important, as French agronomist
and pedologist Alain Huellan points
out in his book Regards sur le sol.

tains many plant and animal
species and many biological cycles
transit through it.
A nutrition function: it con¬
tains elements necessary for life
such as mineral salts, air and water,
which it accumulates and puts at
the disposal of plants and animals.
In short, it plays "the role of a
larder which \ a ries in size and abun¬
dance; it also retains water which it
returns to ¡liants as they need it.
Much of what plants eat, drink and
breathe comes from the soil."
A filtration function: it is a
porous environment which acts as
a purifier and provides the water
(wells, springs, rivers) which passes
through it with its chemical and
biological qualities.
A material function: it provides
raw material for construction and
other activities (buildings, pottery,
ores, etc).
A BIOLOGICAL CARPET
An incredible diversity of under¬
ground animal and plant life pro¬
liferates away from curious eyes.
Yves Coineau, a professor at
France's National Museum of Nat¬
ural History in Paris ¡s a specialist
in soil microfauna. "Lots of people
have heard about the fabulous
mass of marine plankton," he
writes, "but do not know that when¬
ever they put a foot down they *

forming dense, varied and active
populations which are in many ways
reminiscent of plankton. Walkers
think they are tramping over an
inert mineral soil whereas in fact
they are moving about on a con¬
stantly changing biological carpet."
Pedozoology, the study of ani¬
mal life in the soil, is a recent sci¬
ence and it is far from having drawn
up a complete inventory of its field.
To get some idea of the difficulties
it faces, we should bear in mind
that examination of the living mat¬
ter in the first 15 centimetres
below the surface of the average
meadow reveals (per gram) a flora
of 100,000 algae, 600,000,000
bacteria, 400,000 fungi, and a
microfauna (per cubic decimetre)
of 1,551,000,000 protozoans (uni¬
cellular creatures), 51,000 meta-
zoans (creatures consisting of sev¬
eral cells) including 50,000
nematodes (worms). In I'aris Yves
Coineau has created the world's
first microzoo where vistors peer
through microscopes to see surre¬
alistic creatures, including his
favourites, mites (Acariña) and
springtails (Collembola). He tracks
them down not only in the soil but
in our beds, where they find a lodg¬
ing after going through an extra¬
ordinary process of adaptation.
THE PRESSURE OF HUMAN
ACTIVITY
We live in close interdependence
with the soil. "The Hebrew word
adâmah means soil," Alain Huel¬
lan points out, "and is the origin
of the word 'Adam', the first man."
In Japan there are shinto temples
dedicated to soil and the Japan¬
ese sign for "soil" symbolizes the
rooted plant. This veneration for
the soil reflects awareness of its
mystery and importance. Soil is
the very root of humanity. If it dis¬
appears, humanity disappears.
"It's all a question of balance
between the functional capacities
and renewability of soils and the
excessive pressure of human activ¬
ities," Huellan maintains. "All over
the world there are too many exam¬
ples of seriously modified soils, of
soils seriously wounded by
exploitation erosion of course but
also déstructuration, compaction,
impoverishment and decliningbio-
logical activities, excessive desic¬
cation, accumulation of toxic salts,
leaching of fine and nutritious ele¬
ments, and pollution."

According to the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), there are
an estimated 3,031 million
hectares of cropland worldwide,
877 million in (lev eloped countries
and 2,1 54 in the developing world.
Michel Hobert, of France's
National Institute for Agronomic
Research (INHA), has noted that
"the natural fertility of the great
tropical forests has always been an
illusion. In reality, they are a frag¬
ile ecosystem and as soon as they
are affected by deforestation
important and irreversible changes
take place; these concern more
than 1 1 million hectares each year
in tropical areas."
In the forest, there is consider¬
able soil stability and low erosion.
Hut mechanized clearance causes
the soil to become comparted and
impermeable. Water run-off and
erosion ensue. Krosion has many
causes, including overgrazing and
increased cropping to keep pace
with demographic growth, as well
as deforestation. Annual soil loss
is thought to affect between 5 and
7 million hectares a year, according
to FAO estimates; if erosion con¬
tinues on this scale, from 20 to 30
per cent of cropland will disappear
between now and the year 2000.
Soil should now be regarded as a
non-renewable resource, just like
peat, coal or oil. Nature needs from
100 to 400 years to create 10 mil¬
limetres of topsoil and from 3,000 to
12,000 years to form a soil laver
