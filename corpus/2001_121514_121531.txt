E d u a rdo Galeano:
the open veins of McWo r l d
lobalization
This is not a new
p h e n o m e n o n , but a
trend that dates back
a long while.
Globalization has
considerably
accelerated in recent
years following the
dizzying expansion of communications
and transport and the equally stupefying
transnational mergers of capital.We must
not confuse globalization with
“ i n t e r n a t i o n a l i s m ”t h o u g h .We know that
the human condition is universal, t h a t
we share similar passions, f e a r s, n e e d s
and dreams, but this has nothing to do
with the “rubbing out” of national
borders as a result of unrestricted capital
m o v e m e n t s. One thing is the free
movement of peoples, the other of
money. This can be seen very clearly in
such places as the border between
Mexico and the United States which
hardly exists as far as the flow of money
and goods is concerned.Yet it stands as
a kind of Berlin Wall or Great Wall of
China when it comes to stopping people
The Uruguayan writer
Eduardo Galeano likes
nothing better than to
unmask hidden truths.
In a wide-ranging 
interview with Danish
journalist Niels Boel, he
takes his scalpel to
globalization, memory,
cultural identity,
indigenous rights—
and football
G
Eduardo Galeano

The stomach is part of the human soul.
The mouth is the gateway
from getting across.
The right to choose one’s own food
The perfect symbol of globalization is
the success of firms like McDonald’s,
which opens five new restaurants around
the world each day. For me there is
something more significant than the fall
of the Berlin Wa l l . It was the queue of
Russians outside McDonald’s on
M o s c o w ’s Red Square as the so-called
“iron curtain”—which turned out be
more like a “mashed potato curtain”—
was coming down.
The “ M c D o n a l d i z a t i o n ” of the world
is planting plastic food in the four corners
of the planet. But the success of
M c D o n a l d ’s has at the same time
i n flicted a kind of open wound on one of
the most basic human rights, the right
to choose our own food.The stomach is
part of the human soul.The mouth is its
g a t e w a y.Tell me what you eat and I’ll tell
you who you are. I t ’s not about how
much you eat but what and how you
choose to do so. How people prepare
food is an important part of their cultural
i d e n t i t y. It matters greatly to poor or
even very poor people,who have little or
no food but who respect traditions that
turn the trivial act of barely eating into a
small ritual.
Against standardization
The best side of the world is that it
contains many worlds within itself. S u c h
cultural diversity,which is the heritage of
all humanity, appears in the different
ways people eat, but also in how they
think,feel,dream,talk and dance.
Th e r e ’s a very marked trend towards
the standardization of cultural behaviour.
But there is also a backlash by people
who endorse differences that are worth
p r e s e r v i n g. Emphasizing cultural
d i f f e r e n c e s,not social ones, is what gives
humankind its many concurrent faces
instead of just a single one. In the face of
this avalanche of forced standardization,
there have been very healthy reactions
alongside the odd crazy ones springing
from religious fanaticism and other
desperate attempts to affirm identity. I
d o n ’t think we’re at all doomed to live in
a world where the only choice is between
dying of hunger or dying of boredom.
Identity on the move
Cultural identity isn’t like a precious
vase standing silently in a museum
s h o w c a s e. I t ’s always moving, c h a n g i n g
and being challenged by reality that is
itself in perpetual movement. I am what
I am, but I’m also what I do to change
what I am. Th e r e ’s no such thing as
cultural purity, any more than there is
racial purity.
L u c k i l y, every culture is made up of
some elements that come from afar.Wh a t
d e fines a cultural product—whether it
be a book, a song, a popular saying or a
way of playing football—is never where
it comes from but what it is. A typical
Cuban drink like a daiquiri has nothing
Cuban in it: the ice comes from
somewhere else, just like the lemon, t h e
sugar and the rum. C h r i s t o p h e r
Columbus first brought sugar to the
Americas from the Canary Islands. Ye t
the daiquiri is considered quintessentially
C u b a n .The churro fritters of A n d a l u s i a
originated in the Middle East. I t a l i a n
pasta first came from China.Nothing can
be defined or derided on the basis of its
o r i g i n . The important thing is what is
done with it and how far a community
i d e n t i fies with something that symbolizes
its favourite way of dreaming, l i v i n g,
d a n c i n g, playing or loving.
This is the positive side of the world:
a constant intermingling that produces
new responses to new challenges. B u t
because of forced globalization, t h e r e ’s a
clear trend these days towards uniformity.
This trend comes largely from the ever-
greater concentration of power in the
hands of large media groups.
Hope for the future : the Internet and
community radio
Is the right to freedom of expression,
which is written into every country’s
constitution, being reduced to nothing
more than the right to listen? Is it not
also the right to speak? And how many
people have the right to speak? These
questions are very closely connected
with the battering that cultural diversity
is currently suffering.
Opportunities for independent
activity in the world of communications
have been greatly reduced. Th e
dominant media groups are imposing
doctored and distorted news along with
a vision of the world that tends to
become accepted as the only one
p o s s i b l e. I t ’s like reducing a face that
has millions of eyes to the standard two.
What does seem promising is the
dawn of the Internet, one of those
paradoxes that keeps hope alive. I t
sprang from the need to coordinate
global military strategy—in other words,
to serve the cause of war and death. B u t
it is now the forum for a myriad of voices
that were barely noticed before. Today
they are heard and networks can be
created using this new tool.
I t ’s true that the Internet can also
be used towards commercial ends or to
manipulate people. But the network has
definitely opened up very important
areas of freedom for expressing
independent views, which tend to be
ignored by television and the print
media.
Good things are happening in radio
t o o. The growth of community radio
stations in Latin America is encouraging
a much wider spectrum of people to
express themselves. Talking to people
about what is happening is not the same
thing as listening to their own voices
recounting their lives,when this is possible
and when freedom of expression is
r e s p e c t e d .
End and means
In Ancient Greece, knives were
convicted along with the murderer.Wh e n
a knife was used in a crime, the judges
threw it into a river.We must not confuse
the means with the end.Latin A m e r i c a ’s
misfortune is that the U. S. model of
At the border between Mexico and the U. S.

by virtue of the North A m e r i c a n
television model, anything that sells is
good and what doesn’t is bad.
The indigenous struggle
One of the great hidden strengths
and energy sources in Latin America is
the people, who have expressed
themselves through the revival of
indigenous movements and the
commercial television has taken root.
We ’ve learned nothing from the
European television model, which is
geared towards different ends. I n
countries such as Germany, D e n m a r k
and the Netherlands, television still plays
a very enriching and important cultural
role thanks to a degree of public
ownership—even though it’s not as
strong these days.Here in Latin A m e r i c a ,
tremendous force of the values they stand
f o r.These values are about harmony with
nature and sharing lives in communities
not focused on greed. They are values
drawn from the past but which speak for
the future and are relevant for all of us
t o d a y. They are widely shared because
they are values everyone needs to grasp
in a world where compassion and
solidarity have been seriously wounded
Beijing has not escaped McDonaldization.

Many indigenous people burnt alive for
idolatry were simply enviro n m e n t a l i s t s
in recent years and in some cases
d e s t r o y e d . Ours is a world focused on
s e l fis h n e s s, on a belief in “ e v e r y o n e
looking out for their own self.”
People and land
Five centuries ago, people in Latin
America were taught to separate nature
from Man—or so-called Man—which in
fact meant men and women.Nature was
placed on one side, human beings on the
other. The same divorce took place the
world over.
Many of the indigenous people
burned alive for worshipping idols were
simply the environmentalists of their time
who were practising the only kind of
ecology that seems worthwhile to me—
an ecology of communion with nature.
Harmony with nature and a communal
approach to life ensured the survival of
ancient indigenous values despite fiv e
centuries of persecution and contempt.
For centuries, nature was seen as a
beast that had to be tamed—as a foreign
enemy and a traitor. Now that we’re all
“ g r e e n s,” thanks to deceitful advertising
based on words rather than deeds, n a t u r e
has become something to be protected.
But whether nature is to be protected or
mastered and exploited for profit , i t ’s
still seen as separate from us.
We have to recover this sense of
communion with nature. Nature is not a
l a n d s c a p e, i t ’s something inside us,
something we live with. I’m not just
talking about forests, but about
everything to do with the reverence for
the natural that the indigenous people of
the Americas have and always have had.
They see nature as sacred in the sense
that every harm we cause turns against us
one day or another. So every crime
becomes a suicide.This can be seen in the
large cities of Latin America,which are
bad copies of those in the developed
world where it’s just about impossible to
walk or breathe clean air. . We ’re living in
a world whose air, water and soil are
p o i s o n e d . But most of all, our minds are
p o i s o n e d . I truly wish that we could
manage to summon up enough energy to
heal ourselves.

Even when he is compiling painstakingly
detailed accounts of social discontent, t h e
pleasure Eduardo Galeano takes in telling his
story is palpable. The Open Veins of Latin
A m e r i c a (1971) is a point of reference for
anyone who wishes to understand the past
and present of Latin America.It starts with a
p u z z l e : w h y, he asks, has this continent so
abundantly blessed by Mother Nature had
such an unfortunate social and political history?
The book,as gripping as a police thriller, tells
with passion, lucidity and indignation the
history of what he describes as the looting of
Latin America, first by the Spaniards and the
Portuguese, and then by the rest of the West
and the ruling classes of the countries
themselves.
Galeano fearlessly breaks through divisions
between literary genres. His books, in which
narrative and essays, poetry and reportage all
m i n g l e, assemble voices from people’s souls
and the streets to form a compound of reality
and reminiscence.
Galeano was born in Montevideo, U r u g u a y,
60 years ago.There he became editor-in-chief
of the weekly magazine M a r c h a and the
newspaper É p o c a. In Buenos A i r e s, he founded
and ran the magazine C r i s i s. He went into
exile in Argentina and Spain in 1973 and
returned to Uruguay in early 1985.His books
have been translated into various languages
and his journalistic output has also been
p r o l i fic . As well as The Open Veins of Latin
America, he has published:
Memory of Fire trilogy (Genesis, 1982; Faces
and Masks, 1984; Century of the Wind, 1986)
The Book of Embraces (1989)
Walking Words (1993)
Soccer in Sun and Shadow (1995)
Upside Down: a Primer for the Looking Glass
World (1998)
We Say No (1989),a collection of articles and
essays
Galeano received the Casa de las A m é r i c a s
book award in 1975 and 1978. His Memory of
F i r e trilogy won the American Book A wa r d
from the University of Washington  and was
honoured by Uruguay’s Ministry of Culture in
1989. ■

can pull you out again? You are taught
how to be brief, to summarize—an
interesting exercise for someone who
wants to write about so many things.
Yo u ’re also forced to come out of your
little world to face reality and dance to the
tune of others. You have to get out and
listen to people. But there’s a downside,
mainly the urgency.Sometimes when I’m
writing I get stuck on a word and spend
three hours looking for another. Th a t ’s
one luxury journalism couldn’t afford to
give me.
Dreams and vigilance
My only task is to try to reveal a
masked reality, to write about what we
see and what remains hidden. It is a
reality that comes from being on watch,
a false reality, sometimes a deceptive
o n e, but also one capable of telling
unknown or rarely heard truths.
Th e r e ’s no magic formula for changing

reality unless we start by looking at it as it
i s. To transform it, you have to begin by
accepting it.This is the problem in Latin
A m e r i c a .We still cannot see that.We are
blind towards our own selves because we
have been trained to see through the eyes
of others. The mirror only reflects an
opaque glint, and nothing more.
And football...
All Uruguayans are born shouting
“ g o a l ”and that’s why there’s always such
a tremendous racket in our maternity
wards. I wanted to be a football player
like all Uruguayan boys. I started playing
when I was eight years old but I was no
good at it because I was so clumsy. The
ball and I never got along. It was a case
of unrequited love. I was also a disaster
in another way.When an opposing team
played a good game, I ’d go and
congratulate them—an unforgivable sin
in the rules of modern football. ■
INTERVIEW BY NIELS BOEL
Memory as a catapult
In my book D ays and Nights of Lov e
and Wa r, I ’ve asked myself whether our
memories will allow us to be happy. I still
have no answer.Th e r e ’s a North A m e r i c a n
novel in which a great-grandfather meets
his great-grandson. The old man
remembers nothing because he’s lost his
m e m o r y. H e ’s senile. His thoughts are as
colourless as water.The grandson doesn’t
have any memories because he’s too
y o u n g. As I read the novel, I thought:
“ This is bliss.”
But this is not the happiness I’m after.
I want happiness that comes from both
remembering and from fighting against
r e m e m b e r i n g.A happiness that includes
the sadness,pain and injury of experience
but also goes forward. Not memory that
works like an anchor,but like a catapult.
Not a memory that you just arrive at,b u t
one that’s a launch pad.
Th e r e ’s an American indigenous
tradition found in the islands of the
P a c i fic, in Canada and also places like
C h i a p a s, in Mexico. It goes like this:w h e n
a master potter gives up his trade because
his hands are no longer steady and his
eyesight is failing, t h e r e ’s a ceremony at
which he presents his best pot, h i s
m a s t e r p i e c e,to a young potter just starting
o u t .The apprentice takes the flawless pot
and smashes it into a thousand pieces on
the ground. He then picks them up and
mixes them into his own stock of clay.
Th a t ’s the kind of memory I believe in.
Self-portrait
I find it hard to categorize any of the
books I’ve written.It’s difficult to draw
the line between fiction and fact.What I
like best is telling stories. I feel I’m a
s t o r y t e l l e r. I give and take, back and
f o r t h . I listen to voices and transform
them through the creative act into a
story, an essay, a poem,a novel.I try to
combine genres to go beyond the
standard divisions and convey a
complete message because I believe you
can create such a synthesis with human
language.
Th e r e ’s no divide between journalism
and literature. Literature is the totality of
written messages that a society produces
in whichever form it chooses. You can
always say what you feel like saying,
whether as a journalist or a writer. G o o d
journalism can also be fine literature as
José Marti, Carlos Quijano, R o d o l f o
Walsh and many others have shown.
I ’ve always been a journalist and want
to continue because once you enter the
