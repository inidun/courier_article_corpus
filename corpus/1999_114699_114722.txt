You like to say that life is a beautiful
sentence full of spelling mistakes.
Human lives are sentences written with lots
of love and inspiration but plenty of
m i s t a k e s , and mine is no exception.
However old and wise they are,people still
make mistakes.
You have said that people are the ro u g h
d raft of God. Would you compare God to
a writer who crosses a lot of things out?
I would be wa ry of comparing God to
a nyo n e , especially a wri t e r. God doesn’t
make mistakes,and I can’t imagine myself
p l aying the fool who would try and fin d
them. I don’t know whether God exists. If
he does, so much the better. If he doesn’t,
it’s not a tragedy.
As for people. . . . The other day, as I
was drinking my coffee and listening to the
r a d i o, I looked through my window and saw
a magpie looking after her babies in her
nest. And I said to myself, people are like
i n s e c t s. They are capable of looking in
different directions at the same time,
keeping one eye on the outside, the other
on the inside.
How do you see the world?
I’m convinced that disorder is the world’s
natural state.We’re the ones who make the
mistake of trying to set things straight.
People want to organize the universe while
they have enough trouble putting order into
their own lives.
Do you take the world seriously?
The world already takes itself seri o u s l y
enough without my putting my oar in.
E ve rything is extremely serious dow n
here—the committees, f o u n d at i o n s ,
i n t e rn ational organizat i o n s , p o l i t i c a l
r e gimes—not to mention the people who
gi ve themselves airs and believe in their
own gr e at n e s s. But when they ride on their
high horse we a ring a bowler hat , they forget
t h at all it takes is a gust of wind to blow the
h at away and all their gr e atness with it. I
hate anything that is deadly serious.
You have a marked taste for the absurd and
for paradox, which are the basis of your
approach to literature.
That is the only sensible approach in this
b o ring wo r l d .At the risk of shocking yo u , I
am convinced that humanity is bored.It is
ready to be entertained at the drop of a hat .
The mechanism is quite simple: just look at
the Monica Lewinsky affair in the United
S t ates! People all over the world feel
c o n c e rn e d , h ave got invo l ve d , h ave had a
good laugh. I tell myself that my readers
are bored and need to be entertained.So I
write for them what interests and amuses
m e . D o n ’t wo rry, my interests go beyo n d
Lewinsky and other affa i rs. I am fa s c i n at e d
by the peasant wisdom hidden behind the
apparent naivety of simple folk. I t ’s an
undercurrent in all my stories.
What do you think about current events?
News is like the fresh water that ri ve rs pour
endlessly into the ocean. It doesn’t make
the sea any less salty.
I have a strong feeling that the wo r l d
t o d ay is heading towards a prov i n c i a l i z at i o n
of mentalities,which are not developing at
the same pace as technology. I would even
s ay that things are moving backwa r d s.Ta k e
the A m e ricans again. They went to the
moon,much to their credit. But they have
made such a fuss over their president’s high
jinks that you can’t help wo n d e ring whether
the United Stat e s , despite all its modern
technology, is not somehow becoming one
of the world’s remote provinces.
The remote province is one of your 
favourite settings. Cherkaski, for example,

Bulgarian village in the middle 
of nowhere. Where did you get 
the idea for your series of books set 
in this village?
T h at was in the sixties. B u l g a ria was going
through a complex peri o d , to say the least.
I ’ ve always had a penchant for the
gr o t e s q u e .The Cherkaski that appears in
my stories is the result of this combinat i o n
of the complex and the gr o t e s q u e . But the
village really does exist. I t ’s near my
b i rt h p l a c e . I know it we l l . M a ny of my
c l a s s m ates came from there. They are
incredible people.They have n ’t changed.
In 1968 the local authorities arrested me
when I went back to Cherkaski to make a
m ovie based on my short story “ T h e
C a p t i ve Balloon”.
Why were you arrested?
Because I was doing something that didn’t
fit in with communist party ideals. M y
s h o rt story was banned almost as soon as it
was published, and the mov i e , which we
managed to finish after all sorts of trials and
t ri bu l at i o n s , was banned after the firs t
screening.The censors deemed my work a
s e rious attack on the dignity of the
B u l g a rian people. At the time literat u r e
either glori fied the system or it wa s
censored. My work had to be “heroic” in
order to be recognized.
It’s not easy to find “irreproachable
heroes” in the middle of Bulgaria—or
anywhere else, for that matter.
In Bulgaria, it’s not easy to survive unless
yo u ’re a hero. D i d n ’t you know that all
B u l g a rians are heroes? Didn’t you know
t h at we ’re the best? We ’ ve left all the vices to
our neighbours and kept all the virtues for
ourselves.We’re very proud of that. But to
tell the truth, I’ve noticed the same thing
just about everywhere in the world.
You’ve been criticized for creating
characters impervious to ideology.
At the time the authorities were incapable
of such subtle analysis. One of my
politically committed short stories is about
a man named Gotsa Geraskov, who makes
an imagi n a ry trip to Pa ris and arri ves there
on a public holiday. Disappointed to fin d
a city completely asleep, he turns around
and heads back home almost immediat e l y.
The censors noticed neither the political
dimension nor the criticism of the regi m e
t h at could be read between the lines. H a d
I written the same short story with
M o s c ow as the setting, there would have
been a harsh reaction. Fo rt u n at e l y, t h e
c e n s o rs took my work literally.
Your work is steeped in the
supernatural.Is that because it was
necessary to use coded 
language under the Zhivkov regime 
or was it a form of aesthetic
experimentation? Would you 
have written the same way in a
democracy?
I don’t like to express myself directly.
G r a n t e d , I have worked a bit like Aesop or
La Fo n t a i n e , but I would have written the
same thing in the same way under any
political system. Some critics have said
t h at I have drawn a gr e at deal of
i n s p i r ation from Bulgarian folklore. I t ’s
t rue that all my writing bears the impri n t
of the region where I was born . But it’s
also true that in the past what I wrote
wa s n ’t always understood in Bulgari a .
Sometimes the critics were hard on me.
My work didn’t meet with full acceptance
until Gabriel García Márquez’s books
were translat e d .
Your work has often been compared 
with his. Are you flattered or annoyed 
by that?
I’m not the least bit bothered by it.Critics
often compare wri t e rs when they don’t
know what else to say.
But García Márquez’s fiction is not 
peopled with the same kind of supernatural
beings as the tenets and verbludes that
appear in your work.
Did you invent these creatures or did you
borrow them from Bulgarian folklore?
The ve r b l u d e came straight out of my
i m a gi n at i o n , but the t e n e t s is a creature that
appears in Bulgarian folk tales.The name
m ay deri ve from the Russian word t e m,
which means shadow. An old belief has it
that if a cat hops over a corpse, the soul of
the deceased will never go to heave n . It will
remain earthbound and become a kind of
va m p i r e . But vampires are a Romanian
s p e c i a l i t y. Our t e n e t s are much nicer. N o t
only do they not drink blood, but they can
actually make themselves quite useful.T h e y
p l ay a positive role. One t e n e t s is said to have
finished weaving the rug of a woman who
had fallen ill.Another typed a short story
on my typewriter.
Maybe you don’t believe in them, but
the people who live in my region do. One
d ay, in the village where my mother wa s
b o rn , I asked an old woman if she had seen
a t e n e t s l at e l y. She answe r e d , “Oh no, we
haven’t seen any around here for ages, but

Economic data
Bulgaria was essentially rural before
1944. During the communist period it
specialized in the mechanical, electronic,
chemical and food industries. After the
fall of communism, more than half the
population fell below the poverty line. It
was not until 1997 that signs of
improvement began to appear.
GNP: $1,140 per capita (1997), almost
half the 1990 figure. ■
the other day they were talking about them
on the radio.” In fa c t , she was referring to a
broadcast of one of my stories!
The inhabitants of Cherkaski 
a re totally cut off from the outside 
w o r l d . For them, nothing 
is more exotic than Romania, on the
opposite bank of the Danube,
w h e re they have never been. Have 
their lives changed since the fall of 
the Berlin Wa l l ?
Ve ry much so.Television has arri ved in the
remotest corn e rs of the prov i n c e . It has
broadened hori z o n s ,s t i rred new interests
and kindled new desires. A while ago I
visited my cousins in a small town near
C h e r k a s k i . Their house was empty. A s
u s u a l , n e i g h b o u rs appeared to tell me they
we r e n ’t there. “ W h e r e ’ ve they gone?” I
a s k e d . I was surp rised because my cousins
are getting on in ye a rs and usually at least
one old grandma was always home.“ T h e y
all went off to the municipal reading

s h ow.”
You couldn’t say the change has not
been drastic! But that ’s not all. M o d e rn i t y
has totally transformed my village. I t ’s
been swa l l owed up and wiped off the map
by a dam! It’s as if it was intended to gi ve
me ideas for my stori e s. The march
We s t ward continues, as you might
i m a gi n e : the names of towns were changed
almost as soon as Zhivkov fell because, a s
e ve ryone know s , changes of that kind are
e s s e n t i a l . For example, the regi o n a l
c a p i t a l , M i h a ï l ov gr a d , has become
M o n t a n a , just like the A m e rican stat e .T h e
t ow n ’s name has been changed so often
no one knows what to call it any more.
Once it was called Ku t l ov i t s a .You have to
a d m i t , the name has a “ b a r b a ri a n ” ring to
i t . One day at the turn of the century, a
bearded man drove through the town in a
c a r.The rumour immediately spread that
he was King Ferdinand of Bulgaria in
p e rs o n . The village wo rthies called a
meeting and wrote a petition requesting
the National Assembly to change the
name of the village to “ Fe r d i n a n d ’s
Ku t l ov i t s a ” . It sounded much more
s t y l i s h !
How has Bulgaria changed? Where do you
think the country is heading?
For a ve ry long time I saw Bulgaria as a
white bear floating on an iceberg, all alone
in the middle of the ocean.We have n ’t come
down off the iceberg in the past few years,
but at least we pass other bears and wave to
each other. Soon we wo n ’t be alone any
m o r e . I think we ’re on the right track.We ’r e
no longer cut off and the world looks at us
in a different way. I have high hopes for the
future.
But Bulgaria still has problems, especially

new literary trends in Bulgaria?
Ye s , especially with young authors. B u t
again, permit me to voice some doubts on
the quality of the results. I’m not against
i n fluences that could be fruitful bu t , a s
Maupassant said,the best belly-dancing is
done in the Ori e n t . I don’t like pseudo-
i n n ovat i o n s. Call me old-fa s h i o n e d , but I
miss the days when 80,000 copies of a nove l
by Victor Hugo were published in Bulgari a
and all of them sold out! T h at ’s saying a lot
for a country with a population of eight
m i l l i o n . There was a tradition of reading
which is dying out nowa d ay s. As I said,
B u l g a ri a ’s famous reading rooms, w h i c h
h ave been around since the nineteenth
century, are being turned into nightclubs.
Many young Bulgarians have emigrated or
are thinking of doing so because of the
country’s severe economic and moral crisis.
Do you have a message for them?
I would be tempted to advise them to stay
at home.There’s no place like home.But I
am wa ry of persuading or dissuading
anyone.I can only speak for myself. In my
v i e w, people must draw water from their
own we l l s.The French have their we l l s ,t h e
G e rmans have theirs ,e ven if they draw beer
from them. . . .And I think eve ryone should
do the same. Look at wild animals.
W h e r e ver they roam, they always go back to
their lairs. Salmon swim to the Sargasso
Sea to die. Birds return home no mat t e r
how far they may have migrated. Can you
imagine that a little bird can be wiser than
a human being?
In view of the tragedies afflicting the
Balkans, do you think Balkan writers have a
special role to play?
W ri t e rs can decide to defend a cause
through their wo r k , or they can do the
o p p o s i t e .I t ’s a personal choice. I don’t have
a ny advice to gi ve on that because, as we
s ay back home, “if you want to do
somebody harm , then gi ve them advice.”
In the end, e ve rything depends on the
context of space and time.There might be
places in the world where writers may not
feel the need to become invo l ve d . I think
t h at ’s impossible in the Balkans. I n

economic ones. What is life like there?
I’m going to paraphrase a line from a short
s t o ry by Maupassant which goes something
like this, “ H ow lucky we are to die
surrounded by doctors in white coats!”
Your political commitment 
came late and seems paradoxical.
You were invited to the “dissidents’
breakfast” with French President François
Mitterrand in 1989, but were elected to the
National Assembly as a socialist deputy
during the first free elections two years
later.
At that time Ceausescu had just been killed
and Bulgaria was on the same track as
Romania. It looked as if it might drown in
a bloodbat h . I belonged to a group of
intellectuals who thought that if we rallied
around the socialist part y, we might be able
to channel the tension rising in the streets.
The French socialists had something to do
with that decision. I don’t regret the
experience, but I do consider it a mistake.
T h at said, I never set foot in parliament and
resigned.
Have these historic changes influenced your
work?

A prolific writer
Yordan Radichkov was born in 1929 at Kalimanitsi, a village in northeastern Bulgaria
which is today submerged beneath the waters behind a dam.
He has been a provincial newspaper correspondent, a scriptwriter with the national
cinema studios and a staff writer on several literary magazines.
In 1989 he was invited to a “ d i s s i d e n t s ’ b r e a k fa s t ” by French President François
Mitterrand, but two years later was elected as a member of the Bulgarian parliament on
a socialist ticket (see box p. 4 8 ) . Disenchanted by his experience of politics, he soon
resigned and once again became a full-time writer.
His literary career began in 1959 with the publication of a collection of short stories
and since then he has written some 40 books. In 1971 he won the Dimitrov Prize for
L i t e r at u r e , one of Bulgari a ’s leading literary awa r d s. He has also received many prizes from
other countries, including, in 1984, the prestigious Grinzane Cavour Prize for the best
foreign book published in Italy.
He has a notable following in the Scandinavian countries and in Italy,and has published
over a hundred titles in foreign languages. ■
W ri t e rs in the Balkans are divided by
t r a d i t i o n . The peoples of the region have
more or less conflictual relat i o n s h i p s. E a c h
w riter stays in his or her camp.T h at doesn’t
mean there isn’t a certain intellectual
s o l i d a ri t y. For example, one of my play s
banned in Bulgaria was first performed in
the Republic of Macedonia in 1988.With
few exceptions,writers have done nothing
to aggr avate conflicts but they have n ’t done
a nything to alleviate them either.
Macedonian and Greek intellectuals have
d r awn closer together in the past few
ye a rs—which to me seems like the most
sensible thing to do—but I don’t know of
a ny other similar initiat i ve s. I have taken
p a rt in a grand total of two meetings
b e t ween Balkan wri t e rs , and I don’t
remember them as being part i c u l a r l y
cordial.
In a way, t h at reflects the situation in
E u r o p e . I understand A m e ricans who
wonder how so many different peoples and
languages can exist in such a small space.
The fragmentation of Europe is even more
marked in the Balkans.
But the trend in Europe is toward s
u n i fic a t i o n . . . . The Portuguese writer
Miguel To rga said, “ U n i v e rsality is locality
without walls.” What do you think of
t h a t ?
I would say the same thing my s e l f.You see,
S o fia is located on the London-Calcutta
axis. Once, it was on the Silk Route.This
g e o graphic location has gi ven the city a
sense of openness, e ven though Bulgari a
has often been isolated since the fifteenth
c e n t u ry.Another route that crosses Sofia —
and to me it’s just as important as routes
taken by people—is the route taken by
migrating birds. It’s known as “the grand
route of A ri s t o t l e ” . The unive rsal core of
Bulgaria is to be found at the crossroads of
these two routes.
If you had to define universality in one
word, what would you say?
I would say: pain. As a writer, I am very
sensitive to human pain. It makes people
equal. Pain is the same for everyone and
doesn’t discriminate between races and
peoples. It makes everyone equal. The
English have a highly developed sense of
h u m o u r ,but that doesn’t mean they feel less
pain than anyone else when they have their
teeth extracted. ■
