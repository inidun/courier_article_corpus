The theatre of kings
by Manas Chitakasem
LIKE most Thai art forms. Thai
theatre originated in the court
under the patronage of ruling
monarchs who maintained actors,
dancers and musicians for kingly and
aristocratic pleasure. In addition,
dramatic texts were produced in the
royal court and the kings themselves
often took part in their composition.
Traditionally, theatrical perfor¬
mances and ancillary entertainments

(shadow play), the khon (mask
drama) and the lakhon (dance
drama).
The traditional performance of the
nang is known as nang yai (nang
means "leather", yai means "big").
According to the palatine law of the
Ayuthaya period (1458), nang yai
was an essential entertainment for
special occasions such as the cap¬
ture of a white elephant, the blessing

Nang yai and khon use the same
story, but in the khon the puppeteer,
instead of holding the puppet, puts
on a mask representing it and dances
out the story in front of the nang yai

Lakhon phan thang (dance-
drama in a thousand ways)
is a modern form of Thai
theatre which borrows
tunes and dance movements
from foreign sources and
whose principal ingredients
are adventure, romance and
melodrama.

in Thailand were associated with
court ceremonies. The generic term
for these entertainments is maho-
rasop, which means "grand spec¬
tacle". The Thai chronicles provide
us with an extensive list of the occa¬
sions on which they were organized:
coronations, royal marriages, the
ceremony of the royal tonsure, on
the capture of a white elephant, at
the site of a royal pilgrimage, at an¬
nual rites.
Thai classical theatre is generally
divided into three types: the nang

of soldiers and their arms and the
founding of a new city. Today nang
vat has lost its popularity but it has
been preserved and revitalized by the
National Theatre of the Fine Arts
Department.
Nang yai is usually performed in
the open air. The size of the screen is
9 x.16 metres, with a transparent
section of 8 x 1 5 metres in the mid¬
dle, leaving one metre for the sur¬
rounding red border. Behind the
screen ¡s a torch or more usually to¬
day an electric light bulb. Behind the
light is a circular white screen to pro¬
ject the light on to the front screen.
The puppeteer, who is also a dancer,
wears embroidered fabric and a
jacket with a high formal collar with
a sash around his waist and a head¬
band. During the performance the
male and female roles. By the mid-
nineteenth century, however, both
men and women appeared on stage
together. All players wear masks
save those portraying female roles.
The khon is renowned for its for¬
malized but vigorous action. Acting
and dancing are inseparable, each
movement having a definite meaning
regulated by the precisely defined
music for specific dance and action,
for example, walking, marching, cry¬
ing. Because khon performers wear,
masks and cannot speak, a narrator
and a chorus group sit with the ac¬
companying musicians and recite or
sing verses from the text to which
the actors mime.
The repertoire is entirely drawn
from the Ramakian (the story of
Rama the Famous) but favours

episodes involving combat and battle
scenes depicting a victory for morali¬
ty always triumphs over evil.
Costumes are elaborate and the main
characters are identifiable by the
dominant colours of their costumes
and masks. Rama wears deep green,
his younger brother yellow, and
Hanuman, the monkey-general,
white. In contrast to the costumes,
the khon stage is generally bare.
Like the khon, the lakhon is a
dance drama but performers do not
wear masks, except those playing
the parts of monkeys, ogres and
other non-human non-celestial be¬
ings. The lakhon was divided into
two types, the lakhon nai and the
lakhon nok (nai = inside, nok = out¬
side), a split which may have occur¬
red as early as the seventeenth
century.
Lakhon nai was performed inside
the palace using only female players.
Dancers for lakhon nai were original¬
ly the consorts and female atten-
character plays an important role,
provoking hilarity among the au-
dience. Stories for lakhon nok are
drawn from local legends and tales
together with many jataka stones
(stories of the former lives of the
Buddha).
In the mid-nineteenth century,
King Rama IV gave permission for
female lakhon to be performed out¬
side the grand palace. As a result
lakhon nai and lakhon nok acquired
some common features. The players
could be either men or women, or
both, appearing on stage together,
and performances could take place
either inside or outside the royal
court. Only the original purpose of
the two forms was preserved, the
lakhon nok being performed purely
for entertainment and amusement
whereas the lakhon nai was acted
primarily for its aesthetic beauty.
During the reign of King Rama V
(1868-1910), the steadily growing
impact of Western political and

dants of the king and, very likely,
they represented the celestial
dancers of the god-king. Lakhon nai
was therefore a royal prerogative
and performed exclusively for the
king. The music has a definite con¬
vention expressed in specific musical
tunes for specific actions or emo¬
tions. Thus a particular musical
theme will signal, for example, the
rally of an army, a march, a forest
scene or a love scene. The dance, the
music and the text are closely linked
through the medium of the chorus.
Outside the palace only lakhon nok
could be performed, and since
women performers were reserved
exclusively for palace dance drama,
the lakhon nok could only employ
men players. The dance, songs and
music tend to be quick and the comic
economic pressures caused the Thai
authorities not only to make a
positive approach to the threat by
pursuing policies of political and
economic adaptation and concilia¬
tion, but also to encourage apprecia¬
tion and understanding of the values
of their own culture in a far more con¬
scious way than had hitherto been
necessary.
The desire for a greater knowledge
of Thailand's own heritage was
strong and the process of reform and
modernization introduced by Rama V
had a great impact on development
and innovation in Thai theatre. There
was, for example, the revival of khon
and lakhon and a more general ex¬
pansion of dramatic literature. Most
significant, however, was the in¬
troduction of a new form of drama
under Western influence. Three new
types of lakhon emerged lakhon
rong, lakhon dukdamban and lakhon
phan thang.
The influence of Western opera
was evident in the lakhon rong (sing¬
ing dance drama) where, for exam¬
ple, the story of Madame Butterfly
was given the setting of Chiangmai,
a northern province of Thailand.
Whereas the essential elements of
the traditional dance drama were
preserved, there were innovations in
the music, dialogues, plots, dance
movements, costumes and set
designs. Actors sang their parts and
spoke the dialogues in prose.
Lakhon dukdamban (named after
the theatre where its first perfor¬
mance took place) is a classic exam¬
ple of a transformation of traditional
Thai elements into a more modern
form whilst preserving everything
essentially Thai, so that the new
form remains Thai. The stories for
lakhon dukdamban are taken from
the dance drama but condensed to
suit performances lasting one or two
hours. Costumes are traditional with
head-dresses and embroidered
garments but the poetic texts are
modernized with new tunes. Actors
sing and dance at the same time
without any chorus or narration. Im¬
portant innovations are the stage
settings, elaborate painted scenes
with realistic designs. New methods
and techniques of stage design, in¬
cluding Western perspective pain¬
ting of scenery, are among the major
contributions of lakhon dukdamban
to modern Thai theatre.
The third type of lakhon created
during this period was lakhon phan
thang (dance-drama in a thousand
ways). This type of lakhon inclines
towards adventurous romance and
melodrama. The plays often take
place ¡n foreign lands or in regions of
Thailand with romantic scenery and
local colour. It introduces many new
types of story from Thai and foreign
tales in orderto give an exotic flavour
to the lakhon.
When the absolute monarchy
came to an end in 1932, classical
theatre lost its royal sponsorship, but
it continued to survive under the
various post-revolutionary govern¬
ments. During the world wars,
theatrical productions were used as
propaganda, producing several
patriotic lakhon of various types. To¬
day, the pace of the dances, the sing¬
ing and the texts has quickened to
suit the rapid rhythm of modern life.
Significantly, the various dramatic
elements peculiar to the different
genres have become intermixed; the
khon, for example, now employs
many movements, musical airs and
songs from the lakhon, and many
songs written for lakhon dukdamban
are now used in khon performances
instead of the traditional script. Khon
stage and scenery have been moder¬
nized and the performances now
concentrate on dramatic action, in¬
terpretation of the text and lighting
effects as well as on the suitability of
dance movements rather than on the
traditional beauty and refinement of
the classical dance.
