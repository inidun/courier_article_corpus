What kind of world are we living in today?
The start of the 1990s saw the collapse
of a global system divided into two spheres
of influ e n c e , whose only merit was that it managed to
c i r c u m s c ribe conflicts geographically for almost half
a century. But the world of the 1945  Yalta A gr e e m e n t
was rooted in terror.
In 1989 and 1990, the geopolitical system
c h a n g e d , but no new planetary vision emerged to fil l
the resulting gap.Those who thought at the time that
communism would automatically be replaced
e ve rywhere by democracy were wrong. Instead it wa s
nationalism,containing the seeds of ethnic tension,
which thri ved in the ruins of the old system.T h e
result has been an increase in the number of confli c t s
whose perp e t r at o rs escape unpunished if their actions
happen to fit the interests of the main forces at wo r k .
For the old practice of double standards—a
m o d u l ated assessment of how basic human ri g h t s
are respected in different countries—has hardly been
affected by the upheavals of the late 1980s.The 1990s
h ave marked a geopolitical transition, but nobody
has been able to respond to the new imbalances by
replacing, as far as possible,the force of arms by the
force of law.
So human rights and democracy have not adva n c e d
ve ry far as a result of the change of scene.Despite more
and more declarations and seminars on the subject, t h e y
are still not an important factor in the conduct of
i n t e rn ational relat i o n s.You still do not  have to be a
d e m o c r at to be have friends in the We s t . Before 1990,
it was enough to be anti-communist to be one of our
a l l i e s.This meant that when communism collapsed,we
were landed with a number of “ f ri e n d s ”who were both
useless and unpresentable.
Then there was the “ a n t i - t e rr o ri s t ”l a b e l .Te rr o ri s m
e x i s t s , of cours e ,and it is dangerous,but it was enough
to proclaim oneself anti-terr o rist to become one of our
f ri e n d s. I r a q ’s Saddam Hussein, backed beyond all
l o gic because he was fighting a “ t e rr o ri s t ” c o u n t ry
( I r a n ) , symbolized this new blindness in the 1980s.
These days, to be a friend of the West, you just
need to apply the rules of good governance and the
market economy. The problem is that in each case
the condition for winning Western support may be
just,and even necessary, but it is never sufficient.
At the same time, we have come up with more
and more excuses for democracy supposedly not
being possible.This is seen, for example, by claiming
that Africa is too poor to be democratic or by giving
a stamp of approval,especially in Asia,to the alibi of
cultural relativism—something which is totally
contradicted by the facts.As soon as they are given a
c h o i c e , Asians behave like eve ryone else. In 1992,
the people of Myanmar voted overwhelmingly for
Aung San Suu Kyi and against the military regime.
The ultimate altar on which we are ready to
s a c ri fice what e ver necessary is that of stability, a much
more presentable notion than a straightforwa r d
defense of our economic interests.There again, the
West is prepared to hand out good conduct cert i fic at e s
to those who look as if they can guarantee this.War is
obviously a big obstacle to deve l o p m e n t , but bewa r e
of the stability of graveyards.
So we go on making sacri fices to “ r e a l p o l i t i k ” .

For an end to
double standard s
Emma Bonino, who was named a European Commissioner in 1995,
is active on many fronts. A human rights militant since the beginning 
of her political career, she advocates a new system of international 
relations that is a far cry from the prevailing cynicism

Only the excuses we make for it have changed—
ye s t e r d ay it was anti-communism, t o d ay it is good
g ove rn a n c e . But is this truly realpolitik? Are we not in
reality yielding to an authoritarian illusion by being
more attracted to strong leaders than to solid
institutions?
The best example of this perve rsion is found in the
attitudes we have long had towards the Asian “ t i g e r ”
c o u n t ries and which are based exclusively on their
economic perform a n c e . It is wrong to insist, as people
d o, t h at economic gr owth automatically leads to
d e m o c r a cy. In many Asian countri e s , the kind of
gr owth policies chosen have not only underm i n e d
the chances for sustainable development but have
also reduced the possibilities of a non-violent and
legal transition to democracy.
But we do not learn the lessons of history.We had
barely stopped fooling ours e l ves about the A s i a n
“ t i g e rs ” when we came up with A f rican “ l i o n s ” —
countries where nobody says a word about the fact
t h at these new friends of ours ban political part i e s
or that some of them have even developed the quaint
notion of “democracy without parties”.
Double standards are a vital tool in this conception
of realpolitik.Ye s t e r d ay ’s enemy can become today ’s
best fri e n d , as our pri o rities change. But to my mind
true realpolitik cannot be reduced to these kinds of
c o n t o rt i o n s.Only a diplomacy based on simple va l u e s
recognized by everyone—including democracy and
respect for basic human rights—can be conducted
in the long term and defended with any dignity before
the whole world.
“Realists” are wrong when they say we must
choose between realpolitik and idealism.If a policy
is to be sustainable, it must based on an ideal.
Taking into account the extent of our economic
and political interests, I am convinced that it is in
our interest to promote democracy. Development
of economic relations calls for stability. A n d
democratic institutions are infinitely more stable
than dictatorships.
So we have to come up with new ways of coping
with geopolitical and economic constraints.W h at we
in the European Union call critical dialogue allows us
to use a panoply of diplomatic tools without resort i n g
s y s t e m atically to sanctions and isolation in a va i n
attempt to bring certain dictat o rships to heel. A n
embargo on technology can be effective , but no
d i c t ator has ever been troubled by an embargo on
food or medical supplies. Such drastic embargoes
can in fact stir up nationalist resentment among the
people who suffer under them.
Sanctions are certainly an instrument in
international relations and should be used when all
attempts at dialogue have been exhausted,but only as
one of the last resorts,when a display of firmness is
needed as part of a dialogue.
Europe has withdrawn from Afghanistan because
a ny talks with the Taliban are fruitless right now.O u r
presence there was just an alibi for them from the
moment when humanitarian organizations we r e
p r e vented from working in the country.E l s e w h e r e ,i t
is not yet time to slam the door. Leaving a country
should be the very last step in our policy.
Such a process can get bad press because it can
n e ver be straightforwa r d . It is a method which
uses gradual steps and needs to be explained
thoroughly to be clearly unders t o o d . The other
p a rty or adve rs a ry, along with public o p i n i o n ,h a s
to be kept continually informed as to what stage
discussions are at .
This is the only way we can avoid being accused
of once again using a double standard by imposing
sanctions on some and not on others.The problem is
t h at our diplomatic practices and the absence of a
common European foreign policy means we have no
clear and effective positions on these matters.
The big challenge as the end of the century
approaches is therefore to change the meaning we
h ave gi ven to realpolitik. This would be a real
cultural revo l u t i o n . We shall not be able to do it
ove rn i g h t . If we were to break off relations with eve ry
c o u n t ry which violated human ri g h t s , we would no
longer have links with about three-quart e rs of the
wo r l d ’s gove rn m e n t s.We could even find reasons
to break off relations with some European
c o u n t ri e s.
Respect for human rights is something which
grows one day at a time.Unfortunately, the political
establishment in developed countries hardly considers
it a pri o rity and major political parties are deafeningly
silent on such issues.Their silence weakens democracy
e ve ry w h e r e , including in our own countri e s. It is time
for us to make a bigger place for the rule of law in
politics.
An intern ational policy based on respect for law s ,
a greements and rules is the only one possible. We
must know its intricacies so we can promote it with
e ve ry passing day. The journey is a slow one, bu t
progress is being made.
The two ad hoc tri bunals on former Yu g o s l avia and
R wanda have chalked up modest successes, bu t
successes all the same. Perpetrators of genocide and
other war criminals can no longer mock the
international community.As human rights activists,
we must draw strength from these achievements so we
can prove wrong those who favour a short - s i g h t e d
r e a l p o l i t i k . I am convinced there is no other way
forward. n
An international
policy based on
respect for laws,
agreements and
rules is the only
possible course
