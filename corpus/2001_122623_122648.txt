Weaving magic with
the spoken word
Storytellers in Latin America have gained a cult following in the
past decade. Some are delving into ancient traditions, others are
spinning stories with a distinctly post-modern edge
alfway through his performance, Diego
Camargo notices that he’s forgotten one
of his characters.He asks the audience for
permission to go backwards and finds the
rebel climbing a tree, crestfallen and
upset. To convince him to return to the
s t o r y, Diego promotes him to the rank
of main character, giving him the
assurance that nobody will ever drop him
halfway through a tale again.
To hear stories like this, fans turn up
in numbers every year to the
International Congress of Oral
Storytelling, an event held since 1995 as
part of the annual Buenos Aires Book
Fa i r. Last time round, over 800 people
flocked from Argentina and neighbouring
c o u n t r i e s, all keen to hear stories old and
new, but also to learn how to tell them—
those subtle tricks of timing and voice, o f
gestures and facial expressions.
Many were teachers eager to get
children to read by adapting stories from
world-famous authors, such as Isaac
Bashevis Singer and Ray Bradbury, and
telling them in the classroom.A c c o r d i n g
to Nora Fo n o l l o s a , a narrator and
researcher into children’s literature, p u p i l s
often go to the nearest library to look
for copies of a story they have heard, a n d
if they can’t find it,ask for another book
by the same author.
But this enthusiasm is not confined to
s c h o o l s. Juan Moreno, from A r g e n t i n a ,
stopped teaching literature 17 years ago
and began a new life telling stories and
legends from around the world in
t h e a t r e s,b a r s,universities and libraries. I f

Portuguese, German, Italian or Hebrew, he
tells them in the original language. He also
runs workshops for psychologists, lawyers,
housewives and grandmothers. What does
he teach to people from such different
walks of life?
“The value of the spoken word,” he
says.“Words that heal and restore, that
can give life but also take it away.”
Learning this is very important for a
lawyer involved in mediation,he says,
but also for social workers in
hospitals and senior
citizens’ homes. H e

what a
despairing wo-
man once told Dora
Pastoriza de Echebarne, t h e
pioneer scholar of oral storytelling in
A r g e n t i n a :“ When I heard you tell the story,
I didn’t feel sad any more.”

with spirits of nature
On a more material note, storytelling is
said to have its bonuses. I t ’s usually better
paid than acting in a theatre, and even
more enticingly, has lots of travelling
thrown in. Cuban storyteller Fátima
Paterson has already been twice to
L i v e r p o o l , in England, to tell stories
accompanied by her musicians. Every
y e a r, there are congresses, festivals and
s e m i n a r s, such as those in Bucaramanga
(Colombia),Monterrey (Mexico) and
Aguimes, in the Canary Islands.
After 15 years of slowly taking
r o o t , storytelling is now flourishing in
Latin A m e r i c a . According to
Argentine anthropologist A d o l f o
Colombres, the wave is not so much a
revival of Latin American narrative
traditions, but simply an enthusiasm
for oral communication. In countries
where few people read, “ o r a l
narration strangely enough
encourages people to write,” he says.

public places.” Does she feel she’s just
lending her voice and body to a tradition?
“Certainly not,” she retorts.“It’s not just
f o l k l o r e. I break with tradition because I
give my own version of a story. By telling
them in French, not just in the original
C r e o l e, I open up these stories to the
world in a novel way and place them in a
completely different context.”
Spreading this tradition is very
meaningful for Haitians, she believes.
When they listen to stories, h e r
compatriots come into close contact with
an ancient tradition that is part of their
h e r i t a g e. They feel proud of belonging
to a civilization that has invented such
characters and stories. For an
impoverished Haitian minority living in
French Guiana,for example, listening to
these stories is a mirror that can give
them a more positive image of
themselves.
For each place gives rise to its own
s t y l e. In Colombia, for example, a
movement of urban storytellers has
sprung up in several towns, despite a
t e n d e n cy to associate the form with
exaggeration and lies. Most of those
involved are university students between
17 and 35 years old. Although they do
not claim to be inspired by any special
t r a d i t i o n , they are hardly cultural rookies:
“ We always know something, w h e t h e r
i t ’s about music,fil m , theatre or literature,
and we take the story from there,” says
Carolina Rueda,one of the students.
The daughter of an impassioned
b u l l fighting fan, Rueda studied literature
and worked as a theatre actress. Fr o m
those experiences, she created a narrative
The continent’s storytelling traditions
are nevertheless very rich,a mingling of
three historically oral societies: t h e
indigenous Indian, the African and to a
lesser extent, the local Spanish. “ Th e
European tradition of witches, g o b l i n s
and fairy tales mix in with Indian and
African traditions of the spirits of water,
jungles and mountains,” says Bolivian
writer Victor Montoya.“ There are spirits
that defend nature and severely punish
those who harm it, such as Marimonda in
Colombia and Coipora in Brazil. Th e n
there are the ships condemned to sail the
seas forever, never reaching port, s u c h
as C a l e u ch e in Chile and the Barco Negro
in Nicaragua.And beautiful women who
seduce men but when you kiss them, t h e i r
heads turn into frightening skulls.”
Fortunately these
traditions are still alive.
Oral storytellers, s u c h
a s the Colombian Nico-
lás Buenaventura (see
n e x t article) and Mimi
B a r t h é l e m y, from Haiti,
are spreading them and
linking up with other
oral traditions.
Barthélemy was
born in Port-au-Prince
and gave up the
c o mfort able  l i f e  of
a  d i p l o m a t ’s wife to
compile traditional
Haitian folk tales and
make them better
known throughout the
country and beyond,in
Latin America and Europe. She travelled
to villages to listen to local storytellers
and read books on Haitian anthropology
in Washington libraries.
Kindling pride
in oral heritage
One of the stories she collected was
about the ogre Bakulu Baka, w h o
swallowed the sun and left the country in
darkness until a benevolent god arrived
with a machete and liberated it.“ When I
tell stories,” she says, “I mention Haiti
and how voodoo and Catholicism mingle
t h e r e. In one of my performances, t h e
gods of both religions join hands in
common cause.”
Telling stories is a political gesture
for her.“ When I’m before an audience, I
stop being somebody else’s lady. I become
M i m i , a modern-day woman speaking in
about bullfighting based on stories she
had heard since childhood, with some
extra help from books about the sport.
The structure of her show is rather like a
bullfight,with six parts, like the six bulls
that traditionally feature in an afternoon
performance.
Narrative tricks
The storytellers have dropped simple,
linear narration and delved into the
language of films and advertising. O n e
of them tells a half-hour story about a
3 0-second TV spot in which a drop of
tomato sauce falls from the 22nd floor of
a building and sets off a gun-battle in the
centre of Bogotá.
Diego Camargo, the storyteller
mentioned above who lost one of his
characters in the midst
of his performance,h a s
also written a tale in 174
two-syllable words. B u t
because it is difficult for
the character to kill
himself with three-
s y llable “b a l a zo s”
( S p a n i s h for bullets),h e
asks the audience to
allow him a bit of poetic
licence and ends the
story with a loud “p u m -
pum!”(bang-bang!).
Through such
narrative tricks, the new
movement is breaking
with tradition, c u l l i n g
inspiration from post-
modern authors such as
Italo Calvino and his I f on a Wi n t e r’s
Night a Tr a v e l l e r. The Colombian
storytellers have thus managed to capture
a media-educated urban audience for
their art, which is filling public squares
and theatres.
Using both ancestral and post-
modern tales, the storytellers are reviving
among Latin Americans the ritual of
listening to stories, those priceless
moments of communication that begin
for us all with the first stories we hear
from our parents and grandparents.Th e y
are occasions that can spark novel feelings
and reactions in a world ruled by the
