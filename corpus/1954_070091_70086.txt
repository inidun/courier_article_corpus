Scenes of a happy after-life
The Egyptians were not only
architects, sculptors and
craftsmen of genius; they were
also painters who were aware from the
beginning of the extent to which a
drawing or a carving in relief could be
improved by colour. The artists of the
Nile Valley made use of colour in every
field of art even in goldsmith's work,
where pigments were replaced by semi¬
precious stones or fragments of
coloured glass. Statues and archi¬
tectural motifs, too, were painted. In
speaking of painting, however, it is
natural to confine oneself to the bright-
coloured scenes which decorate the

walls of Egyptian temples and tombs.
Even this comparatively narrow field
offers countless examples.
The majority of scenes depicted in
the tombs, and an even greater
proportion of those shown in the
temples, were carved either in relief
or in hollow relief before being
coloured; but wall painting was also
used at all periods in the decoration
of tombs. Under the New Empire (1),
in the famous necropolis, at Thebes,
capital of the Empire, this process
predominated. It is from this necro¬
polis that most of the illustrations in
the Unesco Album Egypt: Paintings
from Tombs and Temples are drawn.
It was not, however, a considered
preference, but resulted from technical
necessity, since the rock was of poor
quality and unsuitable for carving; so

faulty was it that it had to be primed
before it would hold the colour.
The background colour of these
paintings varies. Under the XVIIIth
Dynasty, the most flourishing period,
it was usually white or blue-grey; the
same colours are found at a later
epoch, but light or dark beige and
yellow become increasingly frequent.
Apart from black and white, the
Egyptians used only four colours
yellow, red, blue and green which
could, of course, be mixed if desired.
The scenes, which were drawn and-,
corrected before being painted, were
aligned in horizontal bands across the
walls, and covered them completely,
save for a decorative frieze at the top
and a series of strips in different
colours forming a kind of skirting-
board below.
Egyptian drawings are governed by
a number of conventions which often
disturb the uninitiated, though spe¬
cialists, through familiarity, hardly
notice them. To begin with, although
the Egyptians knew perfectly well how
to show a subject .full face if they
wished, they could seldom bring
themselves to do so in wall paintings,
where they no doubt wished to abide
by a particular concept of graphic art.
They seem to have felt that the profile
was more typical of- the individual than
the full face. The details of the profile
are depicted realistically, except for
the eyes, which are shown more or less
as though seen from the front.
Complications did not arise except
where the whole body was shown.
The aim of the artists was to re¬
produce the different parts of the body
as fully as possible. To have drawn
the shoulders in profile would have
meant concealing, or almost concealing,
one arm; so it "may be concluded
despite a very few exceptions that the
Egyptians thought it essential to give
a front view of the shoulders, at any
rate in the case of a motionless figure.
When the subject is seen in action,
the position of the .shoulders varies,
within certain limits, according to the
nature of the movement. We are
given a side view of the bust and a
three-quarter view of the abdomen, the
navel being always visible. The legs
and feet are invariably shown in
profile; male figures, when in repose,
have the left foot forward, whereas the
females are shown with the legs
pressed together though in this latter
case the artist always contrives to show
the line of the leg which should be
hidden, slightly in front of the visible
leg. These rules cease to apply, of
course, when the body is in motion.
On first thought, it might seem
difficult to achieve a successful com¬
position in this way; but without
departing from these conventions the
Egyptians succeeded, owing to their
restraint and their feeling for sty-

lization, in presenting figures which
are elegant, well-proportioned, and
almost natural in appearance.
At the beginning of the Old King¬
dom, the scenes themselves were very
simple. With a few exceptions, the
best known of which are in the
Meidum necropolis, in northern Egypt,
the only portion to be decorated was
the stele used to simulate
the door separating the
world of the living from
that of the dead. Later, it
became customary to depict
figures bearing offerings on
the wall surrounding this
supposed .door; and finally,
from the Vth Dynasty on¬
wards, in the Mastaba tombs
of important officials, the
chapel walls were entirely
covered with illustrations.
This type of decoration
originated in a belief, which
persisted until the end of
the XVIIIth Dynasty, that
the after-life was modelled
on life in this world, that the '
dead had the same desires
and needs as the living. It ¡
is not a matter for surprise,
therefore, to find, on the
walls of the tombs, side by
side with illustrations of the
various funeral rites, secular scenes
which have provided us with a great
deal of valuable information about the
daily life of the ancient Egyptians.
Food naturally takes a very im¬
portant place, and the artists never
tire of showing the dead man alone
or with his wife seated at a table
spread with various dishes and re¬
ceiving servants who bring him
offerings and even, in some cases, live
animals. Poultry also seems to have
been highly appreciated and it is not
unusual to find butchers cutting up a
bullock. Amusements are also in¬
cluded, and the meal is often enlivened
by music and dancing. Moreover, a
prince is represented as still addicted,
in the other world, to the pleasures of
hunting and fishing, and as faithful to
all the obligations of his' earthly life.
Under the Old Kingdom, however, nö
allusion is ever made to the official
career of a dead man, but only to the
existence he led in his immense estates
in the Nile Delta probably because on
his own land he could really regard
himself as absolute master.
It was for him, and for him alone,
that the peasants laboured, that the
shepherds tended their flocks, and the
barges threaded their way through the

marshy channels. Craftsmen, too, are
often shown at work.
All these scenes continued beyond
the Old Kingdom, and are still found
in the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty.
At this period, however, a great change
took place, and the official aspect of
the dead man's existence is regularly
illustrated, side by side with more
pleasurable scenes taken over from
previous epochs. The master is still
fond of gliding along in a boat, past
thickets of papyrus, and hurling his
boomerang at unsuspecting birds.
When he tires of hunting he takes his
harpoon and turns to spearing the fish
in the Nile.
By this time life had become less
harsh. To the offerings customary in
earlier periods have been added fruits
and flowers, arranged with a strong
decorative sense, jewels, and cups of
wine; meals have developed into
banquets the master and his wife ,
receive their guests; charming servant-
girls, almost naked, pour wine, dress
the hair of ladies seated somet'mes on
the ground and sometimes on elegantly-
shaped chairs, or deck them with
jewels.
Another great change took place
under the XlXth Dynasty due, no
doubt, to the religious revolution of
Amarna. Life itself had certainly
not altered but, as a reaction against ,
the exaggerated realism of the Amar- '
nian period, secular scenes were no
longer depicted in the tombs. The
decoration was thus confined almost
entirely to religious and funerary
themes, drawn chiefly from large
mythological compositions illustrating
the ritual of the dead. As a result, it
more closely resembled that of the
royal tombs, for scenes of pleasure had
never been admitted to the mysterious
Valley of Kings, even during the period
when the joy of life provided the
dominant note in the burial-chambers
of private individuals.
The royal tombs, like the temples,
showed a god conferring life, stability
and strength upon the king, or the
goddess Isis spreading her wings
protectively over the dead sovereign, or,
kneeling on the emblem of gold, asking
protection for him from Gheb, the
Earth-god. Others represented the
reigning king, in priestly
vestments, performing the
,rite of "opening the mouth"
of his predecessor (in this
case the celebrated Pharaoh
Tutankhamen) .
The private tombs present
increasingly detailed versions
of the funeral scenes al¬
ready illustrated under the
XVIIIth Dynasty, but now
deliberately stripped of any
secular features; the dead
man's meal, for instance,
is once again a strictly
funeral rite. Many tombs
show the eldest son officiat¬
ing before his parents, the
dead man woshipping Osiris,
or the phoenix, symbol of
the Sun-god of Heliopolis, or
some other god whose pro¬
tection might be given him.
In one of the most graceful
of these solemn scenes the
dead man is shown kneeling beside a
palm-tree (see centre page in colour),
drinking the water of the river a
mysterious gesture the significance of
which is not quite clear to us.
All the scenes found in the tombs,
varied as they are, reveal one and the
same concern that of a happy after¬
life. From the earliest epoch until the
end of the XVIIIth Dynasty, the
attempt was made to beguile fate by
depicting that life as a pleasurable
affair and thus, by means of imitative
magic, to achieve eternal felicity.
From the XlXth Dynasty onwards,
the same purpose was pursued solely by
means of the performance of religious
rites and strict obedience to the divine
decrees. These two concepts are not
incompatible, for both emphasize the
great dread of death which was felt by
the Egyptians, thus bearing out the
opinion of Herodotus, who declared
that of all nations the Egyptians were
the most religious.
