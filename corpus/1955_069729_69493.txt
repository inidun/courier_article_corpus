The custom of maJking New Year
gifts has both a simple and com¬
plicated history. It is simple
enough if we merely think of the gene¬
ral meaning of the custom itself, and
examine, for example, Japan's
New Year wish, "O-ni wa soto
- fuku wa uchi" (Out, all
demons! Let good luck come
in). Just as the old year
should take ill luck away with
it, so the enrichment and
happiness brought by the ex¬
change of gifts on New Year's
Day are regarded as an omen,
almost as a magic spell, to
ensure that the New Year will
continue as joyfully as it has
begun.
From this point of view, the
Japanese saying is very like
those used by Ovid in the first
book of the Fastes, describing
Roman customs at the festival
of Janus. Today, this has
become our January 1, al¬
though for a long time, even
in Rome, the festival did not
coincide with the beginning
of the New Year. "What is
the meaning", the poet asks
Janus, "'of the dates, the wrinkled figs
and the light-coloured honey, offered
in a white vessel?" "It is an omen",
replies the god, "they express the desire
that coming events may be impregnat¬
ed with the same sweetness..." Ovid
also relates that on the first day of the
year, the Roman shopkeepers were
careful to open their shops for a short
while, in order to make a few sales as
a good omen for the rest of the year.
Curiously enough, this tradition has
been kept up in the French language,
in which the word for New Year gifts
is étrennes. Shopkeepers reverse the
meaning in the use of the verb
étrenner, which signifies to make the
first sale of the day.
It is more difficult to trace the exact
origin of the custom of New Year gifts
in the Western world. The ancient
Celtic Druids had a ceremony which
they performed on the day which cor¬
responds to January 1. They cut
mistletoe, which was considered to be
a magical plant with protective powers
from the oak trees, and distributed it
to the people. Hence the name given
in certain parts of France, until quite
recently, to New Year gifts: guy-l'an-
neuf, corrupted cometimes into agui-
gnette (from the French gui : "mist¬
letoe" and I'an-neuf: "'New Year").
In Rome during the second half of
December and the early part of Janu¬
ary, festivals took place at which
gifts were exchanged; those offered in
December were usually of two kinds
wax candles (which we have adopted
for our Christmas trees) and dolls made
of clay or some edible substance, which

HOW THE
GIFT IDEA
STARTED
by Claude Lévi-Strauss
Known for his studies and research at the University
of Sâo Paulo in Brazil and the Institute of Ethnology
in Paris, Professor CLAUDE LEVI-STRAUSS was for¬
merly Deputy Director of the Musée de l'Homme ¡n
Paris. He ¡s now director of research In the reli¬
gious science section of the Ecole Pratiaue des Hautes
Etudes and Secretary-General of International Council
of Social Sciences in Paris.
were given to children. There were
others, too, described in great detail by
Martial in his epigrams; Roman
chroniclers related that the patricians
received gifts from their plebeian de¬
pendents, and the Emperors from the
citizens. Caligula took possession of
his gifts in person and spent the whole
day in the vestibule of his palace for
this purpose.
Traces of their dual origin in pagan
customs and Roman rites seem long
to have been preserved by New Year
gifts. Why otherwise would the Church
throughout the Middle Ages have tried
in vain to abolish them as a bar¬
baric survival ? However, by then,
these gifts were not only a periodical
tribute paid by the peasants to their
overlord, in the form of capons, fresh
cheeses and preserved fruits; or sym¬
bolic offerings, such as oranges or
lemons, spiked with cloves, hung like
charms above jars of wine to prevent
it from turning sour, or nutmegs wrap¬
ped up in gilt paper. They were part
of a much larger scheme of offerings
under which, in certain parts of Eur¬
ope, even the livestock were benefi-
caries, being gratified with juniper
fumes and sprinkled with urine.
New Year gifts, as we know them
today, are not so much a relic of these
popular customs as the democratization
of an aristocratic tradition. Very early
in modern history sovereigns demanded
New Year gifts as a means of augment¬
ing their income and affording a
further opportunity for their subjects
to prove their loyalty. In France,
Henry III and the Duc de Berri were
in the habit of receiving New Year
gifts (what we would nowadays call a
"'luxury edition" is mentioned under
this heading in the inventory of the
latter's possessions). It is well known
that Elizabeth I of England relied on

her New Year gifts for her pocket-
money and the upkeep of her ward¬
robe ; the archbishops and bishops
each used to give her from ten to forty
pounds, while she received dresses,
skirts, silk stockings, garters, cloaks,
mantles and furs from her noblemen
and such presents as precious caskets,
pots of ginger, orange-flower and other
confections from her doctors and her
apothecaries.
During the European Renaissance,
metal pins became a favourite form of
present as they were then a great
novelty; until the fifteenth century,
women had used wooden pins to fasten
their clothing. As for New Year cards
with pictures and ornamental texts,
they are known to have been in use
from Europe to Japan. "Some in
golden letters write their love", says a
seventeenth-century English poet. In
France, illustrated New Year cards were
in fashion until the Revolution.

To understand why the practice of
exchanging New Year gifts is so per¬
sistent and so widespread we must look
beyond these entertaining details for
the underlying significance of the
custom. "The manner of giving is
more important than the gift", the
saying goes, and all peoples, "savage"
or civilized, appear to believe that it is
better to receive objects as presents
than to acquire them oneself, as if the
act of giving or receiving has added
to the value of the object. The Maoris
of New Zealand believed that a magic
power, which they called hau, entered
into the present and created a perma¬
nent link between the giver and the
receiver. Similarly, the Roman custom
of offering gifts seems to have grown
out of a like belief. It originated in
the offering of green boughs to the
Sabine king, Tatius, who shared the
royal power with Romulus. These
boughs were taken from the sacred
wood of the goddess Strenia, and were
thus called strenae in Latin, from
which is derived the French étrennes.
Strenia was the goddess of strength.
For the Romans and for the Maoris
alike, presents were objects endowed
with a special power through the act of
giving. From where did this power
come? By the exchange of gifts, often
of mere token value, people give ex¬
pression in outward and visible form
to the inner spirit of community life
spontaneous acceptance of interdepen¬
dence one with another. This .annual
New Year festival at which flowers and
sweets, ties and illustrated cards
change hands, is not then to be deri¬
ded. It is an occasion when all men
realize that the society in which they
live is based on this very principle of
give-and-take.
New Year echoes
round the world
THE Tamils and the Sinhalese
celebrate the New Year on the
first day of the month of
Chittirai, approximating to the
middle of Atfril in the western world.
No work of any kind should be
started after this day except at a
"lucky hour". When the hour has
been decided the work of cultivation
commences and the first basket of
manuib is carried to the field ready
to be dug in.
FRANCE has celebrated her New
Year on January 1 since the
Year 1564, before that the festi¬
vities took place on March 25.
ANCIENT Egypt also had parti¬
cular New Year customs. In
the tombs of the Pharoahs
small blue-glazed bottles, probably
scent flasks, were found bearing
inscriptions about flowers and the
coming New Year. Egyptian scarabs
with heiroglyphs, au ab nab, or all
good luck were also very probably
New Year presents. ,

midnight.
TN Egypt, the opening of the

are forbidden. The Coptic New
Year occurs during the latter
half of September.
VTARiED local customs are follow-

Year, the festival of Tet. The
festivities have a ritual and
mystic character : offerings are
made before the temple altars:
purification baths are taken
and the people cleanse them¬
selves for the New Year. The
Tonkingese fix branches of

errors of the Julian calendar
established by Julius Caesar in
45 B.C. In 1582, Pope Gregory
XIII directed that the day after
28

October 4 should become Octo¬
ber 15. It was immediately
adopted by all Roman Catholic
countries but was resisted by
both the Protestant and Eas¬
tern nations. For several centu¬
ries there was a difference of ten
days (and later even more) in
numbering the days. Great
Britain and its colonies adopted
the Gregorian calendar only in
1752. There was an enormous
outcry and people marched
through the streets with pla¬
cards marked "Give us back our
eleven days!". The new calen¬
dar was adopted bv Sweden in
1756, by Japan in 1873, by China
in 1912. The Soviet Union
adopted it in 1918 and the
Greek Orthodox Church in 1923.
The Russian Revolution of 1917
is generally spoken of as the
October Revolution but it is
celebrated on November 7 be¬
cause Russia has since adopted

American Indians, although the
times of the festivals varied.
For the Iroquois the New Year
began in February, for the Es¬

Hopi in November and for the
Californian tribes late in July.
Customs also varied from tribe
to tribe : for the Seneca (a
branch of the Iroquois) the
celebrations lasted a week. On
the first day of the year all the
fires were extinguished and the
ashes scattered. New fire was
kindled by the Keepers of the
Faith, and a white dog was
strangled and hung up, During
the following three days the In¬
dians in masquerade rushed
from house to house. On the
fifth day all sins were publicly
confessed, and the white dog
was carried on a slab of bark
to an altar and burned.

New Year practice among many
peoples. In England this used

by Oomancy (divination by

egg was let fall into water.
From the shapes which it as¬
