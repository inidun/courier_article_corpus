This dossier provides a brief glimpse of Unesco's activities in education, which are at the heart of its
mission to construct "the defences of peace in the minds of men". These activities have two fun¬
damental aims. The first is to make the right to education a reality for everyone on earth. The
second is to help Unesco's Member States construct and renovate their education systems to meet
the challenges of the 21st century.


WORLDWIDE ACTION FOR EDUCATION
Unesco's work is underpinned by three separate institutes: IBE and HEP deal with comparative
education and educational planning respectively. Lifelong education, literacy and adult education are covered by UIE.
THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF EDUCATION
(IBE)
P.O. Box 199, 1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland

The International Bureau of Education is a
study and information centre in comparative
education. Founded as a private organization in
Geneva in 1925, the IBE became the first inter¬
governmental organization in the field of edu¬
cation in 1929. In 1969, the IBE changed its
status and became an integral part of UNESCO,
while retaining broad intellectual autonomy.
The IBE prepares and organizes the Inter¬
national Conference on Education (ICE), which
is convened every two years in Geneva by the
Director-General of UNESCO. Each session of
the Conference deals with a specific theme and
leads to the adoption of an international recom¬
mendation on that theme addressed to Minis¬
ters of Education worldwide. The forty-fifth
session of the Conference will be held in 1996
on the theme "Strengthening the role of
teachers in a changing world".
The Bureau houses a documentation centre,
which contains more than 100,000 books, docu¬
ments, periodicals and microfiches. There is a
large collection of national reports on educa¬
tional developments and innovations.
The IBE organizes training activities in the
form of a scholars-in-residence programme,
workshops and brief courses on the tech¬
niques of librarianship.
It also publishes education studies and ref¬
erence works, such as the International Year¬
book of Education and the UNESCO: IBE Edu¬
cation Thesaurus, as well as newsletters and
periodicals. UNESCO's quarterly Prospects is the
IBE's main international review of comparative
education.
THE UNESCO INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATION (UIE)

The UNESCO Institute for Education was estab¬
lished in 1951 in Hamburg, Germany. It
focuses on adult and non-formal education
within the framework of lifelong learning, and
specifically on adult literacy and continuing
education. UIE's activities include research,
training and documentation dissemination on a
worldwide scale.
Decisions on programme activities and the
budget are made by the UIE Governing Board
and UNESCO's General Conference. The Insti¬
tute's financial resources are provided by
Unesco, the German government, the author¬
ities of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg and
other funding sources.
Currently, the Institute's main tasks include:
*" collecting and analysing information on
research in the field of adult education. Partic¬
ular attention is given to educational opportuni¬
ties for migrants, minorities and other under¬
privileged communities, to women and literacy;
conducting co-operative research projects
related to non-formal basic education for adults
and out-of-school youth, including projects on
the development of alternative learning
approaches for the latter, the use of mother
tongues and national languages in literacy and
post-literacy work in industrialized countries;
*" strengthening information exchanges and
the extension of networks in the field of adult
and continuing education.
The Institute houses a documentation
centre and a library specializing in literacy and
continuing education, containing over 50,000
publications and documents.
UIE publications include the International
Review of Education, handbooks and refer¬
ence works, studies on literacy in industrialized
countries, reports and a newsletter.
THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE
FOR EDUCATIONAL PLANNING
(HEP)

The HEP, which was established in 1963, is a
centre for advanced training and research in the
field of educational planning and administra¬
tion. It contributes to the development of edu¬
cation throughout the world, by expanding
knowledge and training professionals. It acts as
a focus for the exchange of ideas and concepts
in educational planning and administration.
It is financed mainly by a UNESCO grant-
in-aid, voluntary contributions from UNESCO
Member States and contract resources.
Training is the cornerstone of IIEP's oper¬
ations. The number of participants in its nine-
month Annual Training Programme has passed
the 1,000 mark, while over 3,100 people have
attended the intensive courses and workshops
which HEP organizes in a number of countries
and sub-regions.
IIEP's research and study programmes are
relevant to UNESCO's main priorities on basic
education for all and human resource develop¬
ment, and lead to the production of training
materials and modules.
Topics covered in the 1990-1995 period
included improvement of the quality of educa¬
tion; access to education for disadvantaged
groups and ways of reducing inequalities; man¬
agement of the transition from school to work;
planning science education for secondary
schools; new trends in technical and vocational
education; institutional management of higher
education as well as educational financing, man¬
agement and administration.
HEP disseminates new technical concepts
in educational planning through a large-scale
programme of publications and documenta¬
tion. Some 700 titles have been published so far.
The HEP Documentation Centre has a
stock of some 37,000 books and documents,
and subscribes to around 500 periodicals
dealing with educational planning and related
subjects.

REGIONAL ACTION
Two regional centres play an important role in the field of
post-secondary education: CRESALC for Latin America
and the Caribbean and CEPES for Europe.
CRESALC
Apartado postal 68394, Caracas 1062-A, Venezuela
Tel. (58-2) 283 1333, 284 5075 or 284 2175
Fax (58-2) 283 1411
E-mail: uhriv@unesco.org
Established in 1978 in Caracas (Venezuela), CRESALC pro¬
motes regional co-operation in higher education and assists
UNESCO Member States in Latin America and the Caribbean
in their efforts to develop and improve national systems of
higher education.
It also promotes the mobility of academic personnel,
serving as the secretariat for the application of the Regional
Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and
Degrees in Higher Education.
CRESALC is closely involved in the implementation of
UNITWIN (see this page). A UNESCO Chair in Human
Rights has been established in co-operation with the national
Council of Universities in Venezuela. It publishes a bi-annual
journal, Revista Educación Superior y Sociedad, and a quar¬
terly bulletin, Boletín CRESALC.
CEPES
Str. Stirbei Voda, 39, Bucarest, R-70732 Romania

The European Centre for Higher Education (CEPES) was
established in Bucharest (Romania) in 1972. It serves as a hub
for the collection and exchange of information and experi¬
ence, a forum and a centre for the promotion of research and
development in UNESCO's European region (which includes
Israel, Turkey and North America).
It is also a focal point for several specialized networks
connected with such issues as higher education research, staff
development and women's studies.
CEPES houses a library and documentation centre which
contains some 27,000 documents. Its capacity for co-opera¬
tion has been enhanced by the setting up of the UNICOM
electronic network.
CEPES publications include a quarterly, Higher Educa¬
tion in Europe (in English, French and Russian).
EDUCATION FOR PEACE
The Associated Schools Project (ASP) -
Since it was launched in 1953 the ASP network has sought to
strengthen the commitment of children and young people to
international understanding and peace.
Participating schools are invited to organize programmes
relating to education pilot projects on one of four main themes:
the study of world problems and the role of the United Nations
system in solving them; human rights; other peoples and their
cultures; the environment.
Associated Schools act as a springboard for the inclusion of
UNESCO's ideals and concerns in school curricula.
As of February 1996 more than 3,638 educational institutions
on all age levels in 129 countries belong to the network, with
numbers increasing every month.

THE REGIONAL PROGRAMMES
Expanding and reforming primary education
and promoting adult education
The building blocks of UNESCO's global action in favour of literacy and education for all are its
regional projects and programmes for literacy: the Major Project in the field of Education in
Latin America and the Caribbean; the Regional Programme for the Eradication of Illiteracy in
Africa; the Asian and Pacific Programme of Education for All; and the Regional Programme
for the Universalization and Renewal of Primary Education and the Eradication of Illiteracy in
the Arab States by the year 2000.
In addition, an information-exchange network based at the UIE facilitates co-operation
between industrialized countries faced with problems of "functional illiteracy", i.e. an inability to
read and write sufficiently well to cope with the challenges of life in complex modern societies.
The regional literacy programmes are based on two fundamental principles: technical co¬
operation between developing countries and the need to combat illiteracy through a global
approach combining the universalization and renewal of primary education with stepped-up
literacy work among out-of-school youth and adults.
All programmes give special attention to the education of women and girls and to literacy
follow-up activities designed to encourage the reading habit.
Progress towards regional goals evidently depends upon the success of national efforts,
but in many countries these efforts are faltering because of the economic crisis which has
severely restricted the development of education.
Fortunately, there is a growing realization that education is the key to development, and
the commitment of the international community has increased since the World Conference
on Education for All held in Jomtien (Thailand) in 1990.

A SPEARHEAD FOR HIGHER
EDUCATION
The UNITWIN/Unesco Chairs Programme
The key objective of this programme
launched in 1991 is to develop a spirit of
solidarity based on twinning, networking
and other linking arrangements among uni¬
versities throughout the world. More
specifically, it is designed to make full use
of North-South and East-West co-opera¬
tion in order to set in motion a process
leading to strong and durable links between
higher education and scientific institutions
worldwide, especially along the South-
South axis.
UNITWIN helps to establish sub-
regional, regional and inter- regional net¬
works of higher education and research
institutions (there are 46 inter-university
networks). The UNESCO Chairs (215 in
over 80 countries) are intended to provide
postgraduate students from the devel¬
oping countries with enhanced opportu¬
nities for advanced training and research
at centres of excellence in key disciplines
related to sustainable development.
Partnerships have been established
with other United Nations agencies, in
particular with the United Nations Uni¬
versity (UNU), inter-governmental orga¬
nizations, development aid agencies,
foundations, industry and non-govern¬
mental organizations in the higher educa¬
tion and scientific fields.

Education for all: making it work
At the World Conference on Education
for All (Jcrnticn, Thailand, 1990) 155
countries pledged to provide basic educa¬
tion for all children and adults.
The search for innovation and fresh
ideas has led UNESCO and UNICEF to
launch a joint project: "Education for All:
Making it Work". The project identifies
the latest innovations in school systems
and practice in Africa, Asia, Latin America
and the Arab states by a continuous on-
thc-ground search using networks and
partners in education ministries, teachers'
associations, the research community and
local educational authorities.
The project provides wide access to
these new ideas in education and shows
how they work, through booklets,
videos, databases, thematic portfolios and
workshops.
