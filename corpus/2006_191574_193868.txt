tal of Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
The urban community, not far from 
the modern city centre, is mainly 
indigenous Motuan and its typical 
houses are built on stilts above the 
water. Each day, Barbara walks 
into her preschool level class at 
the Hagara Elementary School to 
be greeted by 35 children speak-
ing to her in Motu. It’s their mother 
tongue, just one – out of over 800 
- of the small island nation’s aston-
ishing array of indigenous languag-
es. And even though English has 
traditionally dominated the PNG 
school system, Barbara teaches all 
her subjects - including language, 
counting, colors and shapes, cul-
ture and community living - in Motu. 
“In the language class,” says 
Barbara, “we teach children to 
read and write in Motu. Through 
the influence of early missionaries, 
we already have translations of the 
Bible and of Methodist hymns, and 
now there are also other books in 
Motu.” To get to know their cul-
ture, her pupils study the unusual 
Motuan calendar, which has 13 
months instead of the Western cal-
endar’s 12. “Children discover that 
in Motuan custom, the month de-
termines the people’s communal 
activities,” she continues. “For ex-
ample, in the early part of the year, 
they plant their gardens. Around 
September, most of the cultural 
activities take place, so we teach 
children about the different types 
of dances performed when people 
are celebrating.” 
The same preschool programme, 
required by the Ministry of 
Education and designed to pro-
vide children with two years of 
basic education in their vernacu-
lar language before they enter pri-
mary school, exists throughout the 
country. Fred Ngansia, a teacher 
in Umbukul, rural village on New 
Hanover Island, New Ireland 
Province, divides his time be-
tween giving his pupils lessons 
in Tungag, the local language 
spoken by about 20,000 peo-
ple, and instructing them in the 
ancestral life-style, including 
protecting the reefs that provide 
the community with fish and other 
marine resources.
A recipe for success
It’s a winning formula. Children 
achieve literacy in their mother 
tongue, explore the ancient tradi-
tions and develop their sense of 
identity. At the same time, experts 
have noted, they make the devel-
opmental, cognitive and academic 
progress necessary to succeed

in school. As Barbara Mea ex-
plains, “When children first arrive 
at school, they often feel lost. 
They’ve picked up the language 
within their own families - the for-
mal setting and structured learning 
are new and unfamiliar. But by their 
third year, when they start primary 
school and begin to learn English, 
the basic skills they’ve acquired en-
able them to grasp it more quickly.” 
Proving her point are children like 
eight-year-old Michael, of mixed 
parentage like thousands of his 
compatriots. His mother Stephanie 
Malun is Motuan, his father comes 
from Pidgin-speaking Manus. 
“Michael has learned Motu and 
Pidgin and is starting English,” tes-
tifies Stephanie. “He can speak all 
three languages quite well.” 
That’s the idea. English is one of 
PNG’s three official languages – 
along with Motu and Pidgin - but 
it’s a first language for only 50,000 
people. With an estimated 823 
languages still spoken by a popula-
tion of some 5.5 million and wide-
spread multilingualism, PNG is the 
country with the greatest linguistic 
diversity in the world. It intends to 
keep that distinction. This is one 
developing country determined to 
preserve its cultural and linguistic 
uniqueness. One significant strate-
gy is including vernacular languag-
es in the formal education system.
Scaling up multilingual 
education nationally
Yet PNG’s bilingual education 
policies are relatively recent. From 
1870 on, the first mission schools 
in PNG used the vernacular lan-
guages, but an English-only policy 
was adopted in the 1950s. Re-
viewed at independence in 1975, 
it was maintained under the 1976 
Education Act. 
Then, in 1979, it wasn’t the gov-
ernment that launched vernacu-
lar preschool education, it was 
a group of parents on Bougain-
ville Island in North Solomons 
Province, out of concern that their 
children were losing their language 
and culture. The community-
based Viles Tok Ples Skul (VTPS) 
(“village language school”) scheme 
was developed, later known as Tok 
Ples Pri Skul (TPPS) (“vernacular 
language preschools”). With lo-
cal funds and the help of NGOs, 
it quickly spread throughout the 
country. Finally, the programme 
was incorporated in the 1995 gov-
ernment Education Reform and is 
now the responsibility of the na-
tional formal education system. 
Having operated non-formally 
for more than 15 years, the pro-
gramme still leaves room for impro-
visation. Fred, for instance, learned 
to teach simply by observing more 
experienced teachers. “The most 
important thing,” he says, “is that 
I grew up in the village and went 
to school here before high school. 
So I know our way of life and our 
language.”
