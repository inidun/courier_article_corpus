HERITAGE
AXILA the cradle of Gandhara art
by Laurence Gourret
Afghanistan
Traces of several ancient civilizations of the north
Indus basin have survived in present-day Pakistan at
Taxila, a site that was included on the World Heritage
List in 1980
LThe archaeological site of
Taxila, which lies in a well-
irrigated, fertile valley forty kilo¬
metres from Pakistan's capital,
Islamabad, hears the traces of unin¬
terrupted human occupation
extending hack 6,000 years. It
emerged onto the arena of history
during the second millennium B . C . ,
when the snake-worshipping Takka
people chose it as the site for their
city, Takshasila (in Sanskrit, "hill
of Takshaka", the serpent-prince).
Its rapid development in the course
of the following millennium was due
to its exceptionally advantageous
geographical situation at the junc¬
tion of three great trade routes link¬
ing the Indian subcontinent with
central and western Asia, and to the
introduction of iron-working tech¬
niques in the Gandhara region, of
which it became the capital.
In the sixth century B.C., Gand¬
hara was absorbed into the Persian
empire of the Achaemenids. The
city drew great economic and cul-

tural benefit from this contact with
the West, among other advances
developing a system for transcribing
vernacular Sanskrit, later replaced
by the Brahmi script. Next, Alexan¬
der the Great's conquest of the Per¬
sian empire marked the beginning
of Hellenistic influence on the city,
which was to give rise to an original
art, that of Gandhara.
There were four decisive phases
in Taxila's development: the Indian
dynasty of the Maurya (c. 321-189
B.C.), the Greeks of Bactria (189-50
B.C.), the Parthians (50 B.C. -60
A.D.), and domination by the pow¬
erful Central Asian Kushan dynasty
(until c. 230 A.D.). Thereafter the
city's political decline, as a result of
dynastic quarrels, led on to its eco¬
nomic and cultural decline, which
was precipitated by the incursions of
the Huns in the fifth century.
Taxila , which was excavated by
British archaeologists in the latter
part of the nineteenth century and
the early years of the twentieth,
contains the vestiges of three suc¬
cessive towns and many small monas¬
tic sites, bearing witness to the
refined nature of the city's spiri¬
tual and cultural life during its hal¬
cyon days.
THE FIRST CITY: BHIR
Bhir was the first urban community
on the Taxila site (sixth to second
centuries B.C.). When Alexander
the Great arrived there in 326 B.C. ,
he found the main street badly
paved and unprepossessing and the
architecture rudimentary, the
houses built of stones bonded with
mud, the roofs flat and the walls
vividly painted but without windows
on to the street. The town had a
central refuse tip and a network of
open drains, but no wells. The
inhabitants drew water straight
from the river, which was where
they washed themselves and did
their laundry.
In the third century B.C.,
Asoka, the grandson of Chan-
dragupta, founder of the Mauryan
dynasty, converted to Buddhism.
He built the great stupa of Dhar-
marajika, placing therein the relics
of the Buddha in a golden casket.
Vandals many times mutilated the
sacred edifice as they vainly
searched for this casket. Over the
years, the stupa was enlarged by
the addition of large numbers of
other religious structures (small
votive stupas, chapels, etc.).

This monument was largely
destroyed by an earthquake in 30
A.D., but it was rebuilt and its
imposing mass (15 metres high and
50 in diameter) was shored up by
several retaining walls, which resem¬
ble the spokes radiating out from
the hub of a wheel and thus recall
the dharma-cakra (the wheel of
law), from which the site complex
takes its name.
The surrounding wall of the
stupa, embellished with painted
and gilded statues of the Buddha,
dates from early in the second cen¬
tury A.D. Further north, all that
remains are the ruins of a monastery
that had a hundred monks' cells.
It was completely sacked by the
Huns in 455 A.D.
THE PARTHIAN CITY: SIRKAP
Sirkap (second century B.C. to first
century A.D.), the second town on
the Taxila site, is half an hour's
walk north from the site of Bhir.
Excavations have brought to light
the city walls, dating from various
periods, including those built by
the Parthians in the first century
A.D., which were six metres thick,
had tall bastions and were in places
nine metres in height.
When Saint Thomas, who
brought the Gospel to India, vis¬
ited the Parthian king Gondophares
in 47 A.D., he found a flourishing
town where caravans from China,
India and the distant western lands
all met. Unlike Bhir, Sirkap was
built according to a plan, with
streets regularly laid out along two
perpendicular north-south and east-
west axes. Scattered among its
huge, rectangular dwelling-houses,
in the oriental style, with rooms
arranged around an open central
courtyard, were Jain stupas, Bud¬
dhist altars and private chapels.
Like Bhir, Sirkap had neither wells
nor mains drainage. The main thor¬
oughfare was lined by a large num¬
ber of open-fronted shops with
wooden stalls. Numerous Greek-
inspired objects have been exca¬
vated, including a silver head of
Dion) sos and a cornelian seal with
representations of Eros and Psyche.
One particularly remarkable
stupa, known as the shrine of the
double-headed eagle (first century
A.D.), provides a perfect illustration
of the fusion of Indian and Greek
styles: pilasters with Corinthian cap¬
itals, recesses decorated in a man-
nerinspired by Greek architecture,
and Bengali-style roofs. A similar
cross-fertilization of cultures is evi¬
dent in the sculpted representation
of the Buddha and bodhisattvas at
the foot of the votive stupas. The
way in which the robes hang, the
smiles and the facial features, exe¬
cuted in accordance with the stan¬
dards of the Hellenistic school, are
combined with the traditional med¬
itative poses of Buddhist art.
On the Jandial site, near the
northern gate, are the ruins of two
temples built by the Bactrian
Greeks. Pillaged by the Scythians
in the second century A.D., they
disappeared in the earthquake of
30 A.D.
THE KUSHAN CITY: SIRSUKH
Sirsukh (first to fifth centuries
A.D.), the last of the three fortified
towns on the Taxila site, was the
regional capital of the Kushan, who
originally came from Central Asia
and brought to Taxila their own
ideas of town-building and their own
construction methods. We have less
information about the life of the
inhabitants than in the case of
Sirkap since few excavations have
been carried out here. It neverthe¬
less appears that Gandhara art ben¬
efitted considerably from the con¬
tributions made by the Kushan,
who encouraged local sculptors and
promoted the development of Bud¬
dhist monasteries.
Taxila's decline, resulting from
internal dynastic dissension, began
at the end of the second century
A.D. The town seems to have

HERITAGE
escaped the Sassanid invasions,
although Sassanid influence may be
discerned, particularly in the
coinage. The preponderant influ¬
ence thereafter was Indian. The
Brahmi script came into use, Hindu
divinities like Shiva and Vishnu
made their appearance in local stat¬
uary art, and the influence of clas¬
sical Gupta art made itself felt in
that of Gandhara. Taxila 's economic
and cultural ruin was, however,
largely due to the Huns, who swept
into Gandhara in the middle of the
fifth century.
MONASTERIES
Taxila also became an influential
centre of Buddhism. It was said to
be here that the Buddha, emaci¬
ated by the long practice of asceti¬
cism, beheaded himself, as a sym¬
bolic gesture denoting the
renunciation even of thinking, in
order to attain illumination. Stu¬
dents came from all over northern
India to follow the many courses of
study on offer, which in addition to
Mahayana Buddhism included the
teaching of the Vedas, military sci¬
ence, medicine, law, political econ¬
omy, astronomy, mathematics, the
arts and letters. Among the students
was the celebrated Indian gram¬
marian Panini (c. 400 B.C.).
As well as the sites of the three
fortified towns, Taxila contains those
of many Buddhist monastic estab¬
lishments which testify to its reli¬
gious significance. Scattered about
beyond the walls of the three towns
but always built near to a spring,
most of them date back to the
Kushan and post-Kushan periods.
Dharmarajika is undoubtedly the
most important of them, but men¬
tion should also be made of the
monasteries of Khader Mohra and
Akhauri, which, with two others,
form the four corners of a vast
quadrilateral with sides measuring
between 400 and 500 metres. Prob¬
ably erected in the Kushan period,
these builldings show signs of a cer¬
tain evolution in monastic architec¬
ture. In three of them, the stupa is
separate from the monks' cells,
which are arranged around a central
courtyard, while two of them have
neither a refectory nor commons.
Kalwan ("the caves"), the largest
of the Buddhist sites at Taxila, also
dates from the Kushan period. It
comprises three groups of cells, each
built around a cloister, and a central
stupa encircled by smaller stupas and
by numerous shrines decorated, in
particular, with clay and stucco stat¬
ues of the Buddha and bodhisattvas.
The floors of theliving quarters were
of rammed earth, while the court¬
yards were generally cobbled with
stones from the river-bed. The roofs
were made of rough, clay-covered
beams. Water was drawn from an
enormous well nearly four metres in
diameter, with a stone lining almost a
metre thick at the mouth.
Among the many other monas¬
teries, Mohra Moradu has some of
the finest examples of stucco statu¬
ary, and Jaulian, built on a hilltop, is
Meditating Buddha
(2nd century A.D.). It
forms part of aseries
of reliefs adorning
the base of a stupa
at the Jaulian
monastery.
The main street of
Sirkap, a city on the
site of Taxila founded
by the Partisans in
the 2nd century B.C.
one of the best preserved in Taxila.
Excavations conducted here by Sir
John Marshall in 1912 uncovered
various buildings such as the com¬
mons, refectory, kitchens and store¬
rooms. The monastery probably
catered for many pilgrims and trav¬
ellers, which would explain its many
outbuildings and the fact that it had
three entrances. One of these
opened on to the southern slope of
the hill, where the wells providing
the monastery with water were sunk,
while the eastern entrance gave
access to the living quarters proper.
The northern entrance opened
directly into the lower courtyard in
which stood stupas decorated
around the base with many statues
of the Buddha. At the feet of these
statues was a stucco frieze depicting
allegorical scenes from his life and
showing him surrounded by bod¬
hisattvas, lions and elephants. In the
central courtyard stands the dome
originally gilded of the great
stupa, more than 20 metres high
and surrounded by a score of votive
stupas, all of whose bases are richly
decorated with animals, bod¬
hisattvas and columns in the form
of human figures. At the base of the
main stupa is a "healing Buddha"
which has a hole where the navel
should be: for centuries, believers,
while praying to be healed, put their
fingers in this hole. M
