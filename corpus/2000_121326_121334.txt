A s a child, I thought of windmills as
helicopters flying over the landscape of
my imagination. Their astonishing
shapes looked both archaic and
futuristic to me. They were strange,
timeless machines sailing on the elements: earth,
water and wind.
Sometimes my father, a hydraulic engineer in
northern Brabant, took me on a polder (land
recovered from the sea),where a humpbacked mill-
keeper taught me the “ l a n g u a g e ” of windmills: “ a
windmill with its sails puffed out walks ‘on its head,’ ”
the gentleman told me. “During a storm, it walks
‘ b a r e - l e g g e d .’ ”Windmills could be either “ h a p p y ”o r
“in mourning,”they could work alone in the solitude
of a polder or in couples on the banks of a b o e ze m
(the basin of a polder near a river and above its
water level). Each visit was an adventurous
expedition to a land of make-believe,a world made
up of still, dark water covered with white foam, o f
musty reservoirs, rustling wind and strong scents.
When I went to Kinderdijk-Elshout, l o c a t e d
northwest of the Alblasserwaard (“land on the
w a t e r ’s edge”), I joyfully discovered that it smelled
like the pumping stations of my childhood.A smell
of fresh water, cool stones, diesel fuel,
grease and tools. C u r i o u s, the first thing I
did was walk over to the plant. I wandered
around the big machines,and ended up in
the repair shop. The sight from the bay
windows took my breath away. Th e
p o l d e r, the dikes along two canals, t h e
broad bed of the Lek river, the waving
reeds in the two upper basins, the 19
windmills stretching out as far as the
h o r i z o n , proudly holding up a dark and
threatening sky, looked as if they had
been painted by Ruysbroeck,R e m b r a n d t ,
Mesdag or some other brush-wielding
m a g i c i a n . Only a distant grey building and an odd-
looking apartment complex shaped like a ferryboat
reminded me that I was in the present.
The A l b l a s s e r w a a r d , which lies close by the sea
and at the mouth of several swollen rivers, h a s
always been threatened by water. It has been
flooded at least 30 times. The last deadly tide
swamped the area in 1953, killing 1,800 people. B u t
the saddest,and most famous flood is still the one

Irrigating time with 
the Kinderdijk windmills
It’s impossible to picture the Netherlands without windmills,
but they have done far more than inspire the great 
Flemish painters. Without them, half the country wouldn’t exist

that occurred on the night of November 18 to 19,
1 4 2 1 ,when the water swallowed up some 60 villages.
Legend has it that a cat managed to keep a baby
rocking in its cradle in the middle of the roiling
w a v e s. The dike that the cradle landed on was
named Kinderdijk,“the child’s dike.”
Ready to serve if modern
equipment breaks down
Dutch history owes much to the windmills.Tr u e,
the western Netherlands could not have been built
without the dikes, but the windmills are what keep
the diked land habitable. Without them, half of
present-day Holland would not exist. The Dutch
would have ended up leaving the land,worn down
by their futile struggle against water.
“God created the world, but the Dutch created
H o l l a n d ,” said René Descartes. The Fr e n c h
philosopher was very familiar with the country for
having lived there a while, but he wasn’t entirely
r i g h t . More than 5,000 years ago, many places that
had been wrenched from the sea were already
i n h a b i t e d . The remains of a canoe and a female
skeleton (named Trijntje) were discovered during
work on the Betuwlijn, a new, highly controversial
railroad line.
The A l b l a s s e r w a a r d ’s earliest long drainage
canals were built in the 11th century. A hundred
years later, a dike already surrounded almost the
entire area and the basins of the two rivers that
flow across the Alblasserwaard,the Alblas and the
G i e s s e n , were developed.They became the districts
of the Nederwaard (“the low land”) and the
Overwaard (“the high land”). In 1277, Count Floris
V of Holland set up the district’s Water and Po l d e r
Administration,an organization in charge of dike
upkeep. But these efforts would not suffice. In the
aftermath of a major flood in 1726, it became
obvious that drainage mills were indispensable.
A first row of eight round,stone mills was built
in the Nederwaard in 1738. Two years later, t h e
same number of mills was erected in the Overwaard,
parallel to the first row, but this time they were
constructed of wood and had eight sides with
thatched roofs. As the years went by, this complex
grew with the addition of new mills, locks and
pumping stations. This innovative hydraulic
irrigation system acquired a reputation and became
known as “drainage by stages.” Fi r s t , the mills
drained water in the lower basins and polders.Th e n ,
they channeled it to raised reservoirs. Lastly, the
excess water passed through half a dozen locks
before draining into the river.
To d a y, the mills are kept in working order,r e a d y
to serve in the event modern equipment breaks
d o w n . And all of them are inhabited. A swing in a
little yard, vegetables in a garden, a fis h e r m a n ’s
rowboat moored between reeds provide a glimpse
into the occupants’ everyday lives. Just one mill is
open to the public during the summer. I n s i d e, you can
see not only the impressively-sized cogwheel,but also
picture the frugal life of a mill-keeper and his family.
Inside the mill itself, you feel as if you’re on a boat
in the middle of the sea.As it turns,all the ribs in the
woodwork creak. In the entrance, a dead muskrat
hangs in a cage.At the beginning of the last century,
the muskrats were imported for their fur from
America and the present-day Czech Republic, b u t
they soon became a veritable scourge for the
i n h a b i t a n t s ; their digging and scratching caused
major damage to the dikes. Even today, they are
hunted on a massive scale, cooked in wine sauce
and eaten under the more appetizing name of “ w a t e r
r a b b i t s.”
“I wouldn’t live in one of those windmills for

anything in the world,”says Henk Bronkhorst, w h o
manages them for the polder authority.“ Th e y ’re too
humid, too cramped and too inconvenient!” And
yet,he feels passionate about the mills and is glad
to see them on UN E S C O’s World Heritage List.“ Th a t
recognition will probably help us save them from
being torn down”,he says.
Wine and poetry for the
new windmill inspectors
I n d e e d ,Dutch windmills have suffered a terrible
f a t e. There were nearly 10,000 of them in 1860.
To d a y, just 900 remain. I n d e e d , it is nothing short of
a miracle that so many mills at Kinderdijk have
been preserved. In 1950, the Polder A d m i n i s t r a t i o n
was preparing to tear down all the mills that were
“out of service.” Replaced by diesel-powered
hydraulic pumps that could evacuate water much
f a s t e r, they were perceived as useless and too
expensive to maintain.But the worldwide renown
they have acquired will help to assure their future,
and Bronkhorst hopes it will be easier for him to
raise money for their restoration.“We really need
it.The stone of the round mills has become porous
over the years and a fifth mill is collapsing,” he says.
Managing the windmill area is no easy task. Th e
local communities,f a r m e r s,Calvinist ministers,b u s i n e s s
people and officials regularly quarrel over their upkeep,
the building of access roads and parking lots and the
cost of restoration projects.The site’s inscription on the
World Heritage List has spurred the creation of an
organization in charge of managing the interests of
all the windmills within the designated area.
At the entrance to Kinderdijk,west of the locks,
stands the Gemeenlandshuis, the community house.
This is where officials gather to assess the danger in
d i f ficult times and decide on
which measures to take.
During senior-level meetings,
they share a large meal in a
room adorned with paintings
by 17th-century masters.Th e
Overwaard inspection
authority used to welcome
its new high-level members
by serving them wine in cups
that could contain up to one
l i t r e.Each new member was
asked to drink it all in one
g u l p, before writing a poem
in the community house
b o o k .One of them goes like
t h i s : “the cup was offered to
my lips/with these words:
drink up, c o m r a d e / b e c a u s e
you took the risk/here we
push away water, not wine.”
The inspectors used every
means at their disposal in
their war against water—
even the muses!
I t ’s easy to reach the
Overwaard windmills from
the community house. The
closer you get to the central
dike, the further back you go in time.Automobiles
give way to peacefully grazing cows and sheep.Th e
only sounds you hear are the chattering of aquatic
birds such as bitterns,purple herons and sea martins,
the crowing of a rooster and reeds rustling in the
w i n d .You can smell the fragrance of ripe apples that
have fallen from the trees. I remain silent at the
sight of five moss-green umbrellas sheltering the
patience of a few old men fishing.The wings of the
mills turn stubbornly as gales can reach force six on
the Beaufort scale.
But what are the windmills draining? What are
they transporting from one place to another?
The Kinderdijk landscape symbolizes an
endangered species, the typical Dutch windmill.
But for the people of the Netherlands, it also
symbolizes their never-ending struggle to keep their
l a n d . “ The land is still sinking,” says Henk
B r o n k h o r s t ,“and the water level has risen in the past
few decades. We had to add another reservoir, a
sort of funnel, to the upper basin to be able to
collect more water, as well as an extra pump for the
locks.”
Weapons to push back the 
sea’s never-ending advance
Galloping on his nag Rocinante, Don Quixote
tried to attack the windmills. With windmills as
their only weapons, the Dutch are trying to push
back the sea’s never-ending advance.According to
some forecasts, in a few hundred years the
Netherlands will no longer exist because of global
warming. Water will take back from people what
they have taken from her.Time will tell if they will
have been as bold as the lord of La Mancha, Don
Quixote.

Being inside a windmill is not unlike stepping onto a boat rocked by the seas.
