Ten ye a rs ago, a commercial revo l u t i o n
began in U. S .c l a s s r o o m s.After a 1989
test ru n , Channel One debuted in the
spring of 1990 in 400 secondary schools
across the country. It was the brainchild of
Christopher Whittle,a brash media entre-
preneur from Tennessee who had built an
empire by dreaming up new ways to expose
Americans to advertising and marketing.
“Were this a perfect world, we would
agree that government, not commercials,
should provide this technology and pro-
gr a m m i n g,”M r.Whittle said at the time. H e
frequently quipped that students believed
“ C h e rnobyl is Cher’s full name”—proof
that they were in dire need of relevant cur-
rent-events programming.
Channel One wa s n ’t the first case of
a d ve rtising in the schools.A m e rican students
were accustomed to seeing athletic score-
boards sponsored by Coca-Cola or Pe p s i ,
a d ve rtisements in ye a r b o o k s , and newspaper-
i n - e d u c ation progr a m m e s. But the daily class-
room news show for teenagers was something
d i f f e r e n t , and it caused quite a stir.The basic
offer was this: Channel One provided schools
with a satellite dish, a videotape recorder,
w i ri n g,and a television monitor in each class-
room to show the 12-minute daily pro-
gr a m m e , which includes two minutes of
a d ve rt i s i n g . Schools signed a contract gua-
ranteeing that they would show Channel One
to most students virtually eve ry school day.
12,000 schools
The schools could use the in-school
video network for other purposes, such as
producing their own local student news
s h ow s , or to run educational documentari e s.
Critics called it a bargain with the devil.
Schools were ceding control of a small part
of their class time, and providing adve rt i s e rs
with access to students’ attention in unpre-
cedented fashion, they said.
Many educators did fight the concept.
V i rtually eve ry major education group in the
◗ In a venture modeled somewhat after
Channel One, a California company called
ZapMe! Corp. p r ovides schools with a pac-
kage of free computers and an Intern e t
connection as long as they agree to have stu-
dents use them at least four hours a day.
ZapMe! carries adve rtising targeted at stu-
d e n t s.
United States passed resolutions opposing
Channel One. Some states, such as New
York, banned it outright in public schools
while others threatened to withhold school
funding for the two minutes per day schools
gave over to advertisers.
But at the time, the United States was in
the throes of an education reform move m e n t
t h at favoured decentralized control and
school-based decision-making. And many
local school boards and school pri n c i p a l s
decided they would accept the video equip-
m e n t . Some found the news show inform a-
t i ve at a time when few teenagers picked up
a newspaper or tuned into network television
n e w s.And the commercials were rarely dif-
ferent from the ones students saw thousands
of times watching television at home.
Before long, Whittle Communications
had wired some 12,000 schools,and eight
million students in U.S. middle and high
schools were watching Channel One daily.
Although Channel One became profit a b l e ,
the classroom news show couldn’t save Mr.
W h i t t l e ’s crumbling media empire. He sold
Channel One in 1994 to K-III Communi-
c ations Corp. ,n ow known as Primedia Inc.
M e a n w h i l e , with the ground broken by
Channel One, A m e rican companies and
advertisers have come up with many new
f o rms of commercial messages in and
around schools:
◗ Major soda bottlers such as Pepsi and
Coca-Cola vie for exclusive beve r a g e
contracts with school districts,so they can
place logo-laden soda machines on cam-
puses and share revenue with the schools.
◗ Ti m e and N e w swe e k magazines and
The New York Times publish special news-
magazines for elementary and secondary
school classrooms, most of which carry
advertising.
◗ A mat h e m atics workbook published
by McGraw - H i l l , a major textbook publisher,
caused a stir last year because of its use of
product trade names and logos in word pro-
b l e m s. The publisher said it was trying to
make the texts more relevant to students.◗ Associate editor, Education Week (USA)



USA: COMMERCIALS 
IN THE CLASSROOM 
◗ Mark Walsh
Channel One has survived a decade of criticism over a daily TV show for schools in the U.S., 
where advertisers are ready to pay premium rates to reach youthful audiences

Channel One’s news content comes in
for heavy scru t i ny. The tone of its daily
s h ow has see-sawed over the ye a rs betwe e n
an emphasis on hard news and seri o u s
topics and what some educat o rs deri d e d
as a too light, pop culture orientation. In
recent ye a rs ,h owe ve r , the show has empha-
sized social issues of interest to teenagers
and world report s.“I think that if you we n t
back to the early 1990s what you wo u l d
h ave seen is more of a headline approach,”
said Paul Fo l k e m e r , Channel One’s exe-
cutive vice president for education. “Our
present strategy has a more in-depth look,
with more of a teaching side to it.”
The January 4, 2000, programme was
fairly typical. Fresh into the new millen-
nium, Channel One offered an extended
r e p o rt on the surp rise resignation of Russian
President Boris Ye l t s i n . It interv i e we d
n ational security experts and dug up video
of a 1997 visit to Russia by its own corres-
p o n d e n t , including shots of Russian citizens
selling their belongings in the streets. O t h e r
elements of the day’s show included a pop
quiz, a regular feature designed to engage
students in the classroom, a report about the
conclusion of an airliner hijacking in India,
and two commercial breaks. Among the
a d ve rtisements on this day were one for
J u i cy Fruit gum and two “public serv i c e
a n n o u n c e m e n t s ” : an anti-drug message
and one wa rning young people about poten-
tial dangers on the Internet.
“I have a role eve ry day in the discussion
of what we are going to air. I ’ ve tried to link
all of our materials to national education
s t a n d a r d s ,” explains Dr. Fo l k e m e r , a form e r
school principal. Dr. Folkemer considers
himself Channel One’s equivalent of a

used.The United States has no federally
m a n d ated curriculum standards, but gr o u p s
for virtually all school subjects have deve-
loped vo l u n t a ry standards. D r. Folkemer has
emphasized several initiat i ves that show up
on Channel One. Teaching the News, f o r
e x a m p l e , helps educat o rs identify which
subjects the Channel One news report will
relate to on a given day.
Another initiat i ve is The Power of One,
which includes a series of stories that stress
the difference that one individual can make.
Last Nove m b e r , for example, Channel One
f e atured a V i r ginia high school student who
s t a rted a project to raise money to prov i d e
g o ats for families in stri f e - t o rn Rwa n d a . A
Channel One report e r , Tr a cy Smith, t r a-
veled to Rwanda last year to report on the
receiving end of the charitable project. H e r
r e p o rt also explained the background to the
c o n flict among Rwandan ethnic gr o u p s.
Such foreign reporting forays are a staple of

Channel One, and some observe rs gi ve the
n e t work credit for its emphasis on wo r l d
n e w s. In 1998, B ri l l ’s Content, a nat i o n a l
magazine of media cri t i c i s m , lauded Channel
One for providing a more substantive report
on the Indonesian political crises than NBC
Nightly News, one of the major nat i o n a l
news progr a m m e s , did on the same day.
But William Hoy n e s , a professor of socio-
logy at Vassar College, c riticizes the news
c o n t e n t .An analysis of 36 programmes found
t h at only about 20 per cent of airtime wa s
d e voted to coverage of news stori e s , with the
rest of the time filled with a news quiz, we a-
t h e r , s p o rts and Hollywood gossip. H i s
r e s e a r c h , conducted with a media expert ,
concluded that the channel’s “real function
is not journalistic but commercial.” H oy n e s
also criticizes the channel’s reporting style.
“The anchors are cast as adve n t u r e rs who tra-
vel the world for a good story,” he said. “ I t
focuses the news and the drama on the indi-
vidual personalities instead of the issues and
e ve n t s. . .Channel One news serves as a pro-
motional vehicle for itself and for youth cul-
ture and style,”H oynes added.This approach,
not incidentally, promotes a friendly env i-
ronment for adve rt i s i n g,he believe s.
Reaching 
the teen market
Without a doubt, the presence of adve rt i s i n g
remains the most controve rsial aspect of
Channel One.The advertising debate had
appeared to quieten down until early 1999,
when several prominent A m e rican conser-
vat i ves joined with longtime liberal critics of
commercialism in schools. This coalition
successfully lobbied a U. S . S e n ate com-
mittee to hold an ove rsight hearing on
school commercialism that was focused
almost entirely on Channel One.
Although there was no serious prospect
of federal legislation on the issue,the May
1999 hearing was nevertheless a dramatic
c o n f r o n t ation between Channel One’s pro-
ponents and its legion of critics. Despite
their decision to co-operat e , liberals and
conservatives have distinct concerns. The
latter tend to focus on the contents of the
programme, objecting to a variety of pop
culture references such as a riff of music
from the shock rocker Marilyn Manson or
ads for R-rate movies, restricted because
they contain sex or violence. P hyllis Schlafly,
the president of the Eagle Fo ru m , and a pro-
minent conservat i ve activist, called Channel
One a “devious device to enable adve rt i s e rs
to circumvent parents.”
The liberal attack on Channel One is
from the perspective of consumers versus
advertisers and big business, arguing that
c o rp o r ate adve rt i s e rs should not be able to
buy access to children’s minds in school
and that public schools should not abdicat e
control of class time to commercial interests.
Ralph Nader, an A m e rican liberal icon,
called Channel One “the most brazen mar-
keting ploy in the history of the United
S t at e s.” The programme conveys a mes-
sage of mat e ri a l i s m ,M r. Nader said, and it
“ c o rrupts the integrity of schools and
d e grades the moral authority of schools
and teachers.” A year ago, C o m m e r c i a l
A l e rt , a consumer organization affil i at e d
with Mr. N a d e r , wrote to all the major
a d ve rt i s e rs on Channel One, u r ging them to
end their sponsorship of the show.
The letters cited four main concern s :
Channel One forces children to watch the
a d s ; it wastes valuable class time (in 1998,
t wo researchers asserted that the two minutes
of time devoted to commercials in Channel
O n e ’s 12,000 schools was costing those
schools some $300 million in lost time); i t
wastes taxpaye rs ’d o l l a rs for educat i o n ;a n d
its content is under the control of its produ-
c e rs and not of parents or elected school
b o a r d s. Most adve rt i s e rs did not eve n
respond to the letter, much less agree to
drop their adve rt i s i n g . One company that did
respond was Nabisco, which has adve rt i s e d
Bubble Yum gum on the show.“Our decision
to adve rtise on Channel One was made only
after a thorough review of the progr a m m i n g
and its benefits to schools and school chil-
d r e n ,” the company wrote to Commercial
A l e rt .“ We do not believe evidence support s
the charge that two minutes of daily adve r-
tising is putting our children’s future at ri s k .”
A d ve rt i s e rs such as Nabisco, Pe p s i ,
Proctor & Gamble (with ads for Clearasil
skin cream and Pringles potato chips),
movie studios and the U.S.Armed Forces
(for recruitment) pay premium rates (up to
$200,000 for a 30-second spot) to reach
Channel One’s audience of eight million
s t u d e n t s. As the channel’s adve rt i s e m e n t
to media bu ye rs puts it, the show “is viewe d
by more teens than any other programme
on television.” Another industry adve rt i s e-
ment refers to the channel as “the smart e s t
place to reach twe e n s.”Tweens is a Madison
Avenue term for children 9-14 years old, a
coveted demographic group. “Many chil-
dren and especially teens are difficult for
a d ve rt i s e rs to reach,” said Gary Ruskin,
the director of Commercial Alert. “So the
product hawkers are going where the kids
are—where they are forced to be, in school.”
New outlets
Channel One exe c u t i ves paint the adve rt i s i n g
c ritics as a loud but small group that is pushing
tired old arguments.“I don’t know of anyo n e
who is an advo c ate of simply commercia-
l i s m ,” said Andy Hill,Channel One’s president
of progr a m m i n g .“The debate has been about
t wo minutes of adve rtising and not about 10
minutes of good progr a m m i n g . Our cri t i c s
tend not to be people in schools.”R oy Lewis,
a teacher in Californ i a , a s s e rted that “ w h at
Channel One does so beautifully is prov i d e
b a c k gr o u n d .”But critics point out that there
are other ways of bri n ging news into the
s c h o o l :CNN has developed an ad-free news-
cast for the classroom, but the cable stat i o n
does not offer schools the equipment to go
along with it.
N ow Channel One’s journalism is
m oving beyond the classroom. It recently
began submitting twice-monthly reports to
a morning television news show on CBS
t e l e v i s i o n . It has similar projects in the wo r k s
for the MTV cable channel and a new
wo m e n ’s cable network called Oxygen.
Channel One is developing a media literacy
c u rriculum for schools, and its we b s i t e ,w h i c h
has long supplemented the TV show with
additional inform at i o n ,q u i z z e s , and the like,
is getting an infusion of spending.
P ri m e d i a , which publishes such maga-
zines as S e ve n t e e n, Soap Opera Dige s t, a n d
A u t o m o b i l e, does not disclose revenues for
Channel One. But Simba Inform ation Inc. ,
which tracks spending on educational media,
e s t i m ates that Channel One and a sister unit
t h at sells documentaries to schools had reve-
nues of $118.5 million in 1999.
Primedia recently sold off some of its
e d u c ational propert i e s , including the ve n e-
rable A m e rican classroom magazine, M y
Weekly Reader.There has been speculation
that the company wanted to divest itself of
Channel One as we l l , but the company has
a new chief executive officer,Tom Rogers,
who came from the NBC television net-
wo r k . M r. R o g e rs seems to be intent on
keeping Channel One and fitting it into a
media future in which television, t h e
I n t e rn e t , and education are expected to
merge in new forms. ■
