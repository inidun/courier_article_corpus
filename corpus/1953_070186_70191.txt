THE visitor who crosses the borderfrom saxon England to celtic
Wales cannot fail to realize
that he has entered the Land of
Music. Here everyone sings. Song
is as natural in Wales as ordinary
conversation on the other side of the
river Usk. Perhaps this results
partly from the fact that life is often
hard and austere, and partly because
the Welsh are a people devoted to an
ancient tradition of song and poetry
that can be traced back to the rites
of the Druids and the Gathering of
the Bards.
This tradition of the Bards has, in
fact, never quite died out. Today it
flourishes in the form of the National
Eisteddfod, a festival held each year
in a different town or village, alter-
nately in North and South Wales.
All the year long, musicians and poets
prepare themselves. The miners of
the Rhondda Valley spend their
evenings practising in the male
choirs that are the glory of Wales ;
in the high, sheep-farming lands, in
Caernarvon and Merioneth, men and
women trudge for miles by night
from their isolated farms to join in
the singing of the great choruses
from the"Mes-
siah", the"Eli-
jah"or songs
by local com-
posers. ash
over the coun-
try, people are
hard at work
at the poem-
written in the
t. traditional
Welsh metre which is one of the
most ancient and difficult verse
forms-that will perhaps win the
supreme recompense of the Bardic
Chair. Even the children spend most
of the year busily preparing for the
junior singing and dancing competi-
tions.
Last year, the Eisteddfod was held
at Aberystwyth and the little town,
as well as the neighbouring villages
in a radius of nearly twenty miles,
was packed with visitors. Some of
them had travelled from Canada,
from the United States, from South
Africa-for these people are great
travellers, given to emigrating, but
eternally homesick for their own
country. There were the London
Welsh too, come to encourage their
own choir, and Bretons from France
- Celtic cousins, speaking a language
sufficiently similar to make them-
selves understood.
The Eisteddfod is essentially a
manifestation of local patriotism and
it is a point of honour that only
Welsh should be spoken. Each year
there are a few practical-minded
people to point out that many more
tourists would come from England,
and some of the Committee's finan-
cial difficulties would be solved, if
a part of the judging were to be in
English. But the motion is always
voted down. There will always be
someone ready with a courteous
translation for the visitor from over
'the border, but the Welsh insist that
this festival should remain the living
proof of the vitality of the Welsh
language.
In the same spirit, preference is
given to works by local composers.
The Mixed Choir event was won last
year by the Skewen Choir, singing
... THE WELSH
EISTEDDFOD
by Cecily Mackworth
Arwel Hughes'Gweddi, while the
winning Male Voice was Treor-
chy (the mining village that is one of
the leading centres of music in the
country) singing a Welsh version of
the Twenty-Third Psalm. On the
other hand, the cup for the finest
solo voice was won by a farmer from
Penmaenfach, R. H. Rees, with the
bass solo from the Messiah,"Why do
the Nations..."
Competitors of these events know
that they are singing before a terribly
severe audience. Musical culture
here is not confined to specialists or
even to the more educated classes.
It is innate in the average workman,
agricultural labourer, miner, and the
slightest fault is instantly noticed
and commented on. Indeed, one of
the most curious things about the
Eisteddfod is the violent and highly
technical discussions among the pub-
lic that are heard after each item.
The judges of the GOTsedd (the
group of Bards) are severe, too, and
fast year they refused to award the
Eisteddfod Crown for the best poem
in modern metre. There were plenty
of other awards, however, for the
Eisteddfod though chiefly concerned
wnn music ana
poetry, covers
every branch of
culture.
But the great
moment, the
apotheosis of
the Eisteddfod,
comes with the
Chairing of the
Bard. Twenty-
thousand people waited last year in
breathless excitement for the Chief
Druid to name the man whom all
Wales will revere, for the next twelve
months, as her leading poet. Flank-
ed by the blind, ninety-two year-old
ex-Chief Druid, by the Hecorder and
the Keeper of the Sword, all in their
long white robes and veils ; with the
green-clad GOTsedd of Bards behind
him, the Chief Druid began his allo-
cution.
E'oquence is one of the leading
traditions here, and a great Weal. 4h
preacher must be able to play on the
emotions of his audience as a musi-
cian plays on the instrument of his
choice. As the tension mounted, the
cries of Hwll ! broke in tribute from
the body of the hall. At last the
name was proclaimed : John Evans, a
school-master from Llanegryn, for
his ode on Dwylo (Hands). Then the
thousands of voices broke into the
National Hymn,"Land of my Fa-
thers", while the procession of Druids
and Bards wound its way through the
crowd to fetch the victor and carry
him in triumph to the stage, where
he was enthroned in the Bardic Chair.
Eisteddfod week finished with a
performance of"Carmen", translatedmto Welsh by a local scholar and
performed by the Welsh National
Opera Company. Then it was all
over. Audience and competitors were
back at work next day-down in the
mines, tending their beasts in the
mountains, teaching in the little
country schools. One Eisteddfod is
finished, but another is in sight and
already the choirs are at practice on
Saturday evenings, the harpists, the
poets, the players of penillion, are
dreaming of success... next time.
A historic moment during a Welsh National Eisteddfod : H. M. Queen Elizabeth
is invested as Honorary Ovate of the Gorsedd of the Bards of Wales, at a ceremo-
ny at Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, in 1946, before she succeeded to the throne.
