| | all the social and natural crises we 
humans face, the water crisis is the one 
that lies at the heart of our survival 
and that of our planet earth.” So said UNESCO Director 
General Koichiro Matsuura on the occasion of the launch 
earlier this year of the World Water Development Report*, 
a comprehensive state-of-the-resource document jointly 
compiled by the 23 United Nations agencies, programmes 
and commissions dealing with water. 
Depending on factors like population growth and policy 
choices, between two and seven billion people, in as many 
as 60 countries, will face water scarcity by the middle of 
this century. And while 6,000 children are now killed each 
day by water-borne diseases, water quality will steadily 
worsen in the years ahead as a result of the two million tons 
of waste currently dumped into rivers and lakes every day. 
Presented on the eve of the third World Water Forum 
(Kyoto, Japan, March 2003), the World Water Development 
Report stigmatized the political inertia surrounding the 
looming crisis. Of all the targets set to improve water 
management by a long list of international conferences 
“hardly any,” says the report, “have been met.” 
UNESCO, which together with the UN Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs is leading system-wide efforts 
in this the International Year of Freshwater, sent a strong 
signal of its determination to help developing countries 
to strengthen their capacity to address critical water 
issues with the creation last March of the UNESCO-IHE 
Institute for Water Education in Delft, the Netherlands. 
Long established as a world-class scientific institution, 
the Institute will become the hub of a global network of 
UNESCO-related regional centres, UNESCO Chairs, networks 
and partnerships in water education and capacity building 
serving the Organization’s 190 member-States. 
Inform, educate, train professionals, build up capacity: 
It’s a question of survival.
