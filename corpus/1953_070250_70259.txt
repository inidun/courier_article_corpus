THE BOOKMOB) LE
COMES TO TOWN
I WAS very lucky one year when Itaught in a rural school in Iowa.
Not far away was a town library,
and every two weeks I trudged back
and forth-with a big armload of
books for my pupils. The other six
years of my teaching in country
schools neither I nor my pupils were
so fortunate. No library was within
reach of horse and buggy or Model
T, and we had to be content with
the dog-eared, age-yellowed reading
material that youngsters had read
for several generations. It was
indeed a red-letter day when funds
from a money box social added new
books to the school"library".
That was twenty-odd years ago.
Memories of those days came back
poignantly tame nat lang agO'when
I took a one-day trip in a bookmobile
in Woodford County, Illinois.
I met the librarian-whom all
the children call the Bookmobile
Lady-and the driver at Metamora,
the headquarters of the Illinois
Prairie District Library. They told
me that the working book collection
of the district is more than 35, 000
volumes. In the bookmobile we had
4, 000 books from which youngsters
and adults could select reading for
one month.
This bookmobile visits twenty-one
schools, thirteen of which are one-
room schools. The teacher receives
a notice of a visit one week in
by Gladys Skelley
advance. Then the children start
their anxious wait for the day, which
they encircle in red on their big
schoolroom calendar.
As we journeyed over the country
roads to the six one-room schools
we were to visit on that first day of
bookmobile trips for the school
year, I learned how this library
district was established.
Teachers and principals, the local
banker, a former school-teacher, a
local clergyman, and farm folk in
the area saw the need for bringing
public-library service to Woodford
County.
Seven townships of the county
were vitally interested in the de-
monstration service that the Illinois
State library provided. They held
an election and formed the Illinois
Prairie District Library. The book-
mobile is on loan from the Illinois
State Library. Within a few years
the district will purchase its own
bookmobile, and build up its own
collection of library materials, sup-
plemented by State library material.
The district finances the library
by a maximum library tax of six
cents on every $ 100 of assessed
property valuation.
Five collections of books, besides
the one at Metamora, are maintain-
ed in the district. These branch
libraries have collections of different
sizes, depending on the number of
book borrowers in the community.
Before the formation of the district
library, there was only one small
library in the seventownship area.
It is now co-operating with the
district library.
Usually each pupil or adult
borrows six books a month. He is
responsible for their return. The
youngsters'books are placed on a
school bookshelf for use by all the
pupils.
That shelf of books holds a variety
of interests, too, as the year swings
into its seasons. In spring, it's bird
and flower books, SO the children can
identify the birds and flowers they
see on the way to school. During
the winter there are volumes on
games to play indoors, things to make
for parents for Christmas, or books
on plays and"pieces", to help out on
the school programme. Maybe it's
a book about how to identify the
different animal tracks for the
hunters in the group. The teacher
can be expected to ask for just about
anything which will help her in her
daily work.
The bookmobile librarian also
drives a jeep, which carries a
thousand books. Those she takes
to sections of three nearby counties.
They are serviced on contract by the
Illinois Prairie District Library.
After travelling in the bookmobile
for some miles, we came to our first
stop of the day. It was an honest-
to-goodness one-room, little red
schoolhouse. There was a royal
welcome there, for, besides the
youngsters who came bounding out
to the bookmobile when it rolled into
the yard, two mothers and their
small children were on hand for the
event.
The genial bookmobile driver
immediately took a new job. He
pulled down a table top from the
wall, got library cards in order, and
whirled his seat around. He was
now the clerk for those book-hungry
friends. He helped the youngsters,
some of whom could only print their
names, to fill in the library card
which held them responsible for the
books selected.
A busy woman was the Bookmobile
Lady. Animal stories seemed pop-
ular for all ages. The tiny folk,
with mouths open as they entered
the bookmobile for the first time,
asked their teacher or the Lady for
stories about dogs, kitties, or cow-
boys. They. had a hard time select-
ing books, for everything was so very
wonderful to them-so many
beautiful books in one little room !
The mothers, with tiny babies in
their arms, chose several books
about homemaking, cooking, and
sewing. They also asked the Lady's
advice on the newest books of
fiction. The eagerness with which
they took their books from the book-
mobile revealed that they were as
happy as the children because of the

THE REGULAR VISIT OF THE BOOKMOBILE IS AN EXCITING EVENT IN THE LIFE OF A TWO-ROOM COUNTRY SCHOOL. (Unesco photo)
"R EADING,"said the American writer andpublisher Bennett Cerf,"is like
eating peanuts : once you begin you tend to
go on and on."But many people are appar-
ently missing the rich rewards and
pleasures that come from a good bite into
tile'''peanut bag."
Recent statistics show that while practic-
ally every adult American listens to the
radio at least 15 minutes a day, and about
80 or 90 per cent read newspapers more or
less regularly, half the population of the
United States does not read even one book
a year. Less than 25 per cent read a book
a month.
With figures such as these before them,
a hundred or so librarians, teachers, writers,
puhlisher√∞, editors and booksellers came
together at a symposium in Washington,
D. C. in 1951, to talk about reading, and after
talking, to do something to encourage more
people to read. One of the important
things they did was inspire the publication
or. a volume, just published, entitled"Thewonderful world of Books."
Dedicated"to those who bend twigs-the
librarians of America, teachers, extension
workers, leaders-and to the twigs them-
selves,"the new book offers a delightfullv
varied and helpful guide to the joys and
benefits of reading."Books as Friends,"

bookmobile's visit to the neigh-
bourhood.
At the second school we visited
there were two circles around the
date for the bookmobile visit. It
was an extra-special event : the
schoolhouse is located on a road
that is almost impassable in winter.
Thus, the bookmobile makes only
two visits-in spring and fall. The
jeep delivers and collects
the books at other times.
The Oak Dell school
was our last stop for the
morning. Here we ate our
lunch on the school
grounds with the pupils
and their teacher.
Between bites of food,
they talked to their
teacher and the Lady and
driver about books they
could get on the next trip.
Before we left, the boys
got the driver to pitch in
their softball game.
At the first school in the
afternoon, a man was
waiting at the gate for us.
He was a busy farmer,
eager to borrow the new
books in the travelling
library. His enthusiasm
was as great as the
youngsters'.
"You got any books on
railroading or poetry I
haven't read ?"he asked
the Lady. They plunged
into animated conver-
sation on authors and
railroads and writing. She
had for him this time
Robert Frost's Collected
Poems and Cowboy songs
and Other Frontier Ballads
by John and Alan Lomax. Next
time she promised to bring Archie
Robertson's Slow Train to Yesterday.
"This is a wonderful thing-this
bookmobile,"he remarked to the
driver as he signed his card at the
desk. A quiet, serious man, he real-
izes (I gathered from my talk with
him) what treasures the bookmobile
is bringing to his daily living and
to the life of his community.
We stopped at a fourth school.
There sixteen excited children came
to the road to choose their books for
the month. Some of the girls asked
for"true stories,"which they like so
well-biographies of famous persons.
They also enjoy the new teen-age
romance stories, mysteries, and
"funny"stories, as do all the girls
'The Wonderful. World of Books'
on the bookmobile route. Boys
from fourth grade up enjoy sports,
mystery and cowboy stories and
science fiction.
Our last visit of the day was to
the largest school on the route. The
older children came out to the book-
mobile First. They selected their
books in orderly fashion. Then the
little folk came with their teacher
and hovered around her
in expectancy and wonder ;
a new, strange, wonderful
experience was unfolding
for them. As I watched
these children it struck me
with force ; you cannot
measure the value of the
bookmobile, in dollars and
cents, any more than you
can so measure the value
of a new scientific disco-
very, or a new system of
philosophy, or the life of
a good man and a good
woman. These good, new,
attractive, interesting
books that these little ones
were picking out for the
first time and these eager,
smart minds-they would
fuse, strike fire, open a
new vista, and bring deeper
ambition and awareness of
life and people.
How I wished my pupils
in my rural Iowa schools
could have had a book-
mobile-that all school-
children could have them !

The role of public libraries is considered
from many aspects in a section titled
"Libraries Are for You."Starting from a
historical surf. key of the growth of libraries
from American Colonial times, and especially
since the American Library Association
began its activities three-quarters of a
century ago,.'The Wonderful World of
Books"show readers of all ages and
inter. ests how they can use libraries more
effectively and how libraries can serve the
public better.
The book offers practical suggestions to
those who would like to read more but who
do not because"of lack of time,"and gives
the librarian, the teacher and group leaders
an important tool for encouraging and
directing better reading among those with
whom they work.
