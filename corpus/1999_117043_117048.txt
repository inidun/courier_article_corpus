Uncharted terra i n
on tomorro w ’s genetic map
w Sophie Boukhari and Amy Otchet
In the post-genomic age, medical science’s good intentions could lead us
to the frontier of new forms of eugenics
In about three ye a rs , we should have the keys
to decode our biological “ e g o ” .Through the
Human Genome Project, thousands of resear-
c h e rs from about 50 countries are putting the fin a l
touches to a map identifying all of our roughly
100,000 genes.This inform ation will open the way
to developing a large number of innovat i ve treat-
ments and techniques to cure and prevent disea-
s e .
At the beginning of this “genetic age”, we can
expect an extensive bat t e ry of DNA tests which
p r o s p e c t i ve parents will use to gain an extraordi-
n a ry picture of their embryo ’s genetic make-up.
These tests may be used in utero to reassure parents
as to the health of their child-to-be. On the other
h a n d , signs of disease or handicap might also lead
to the decision to abort .This same bat t e ry of DNA
tests will also be used for preimplantation diagnosis,
in which prospective parents sift through and then
select in vitro (“test tube”) a fertilized egg (or eggs)
before implantation in a wo m a n ’s wo m b. Both of
these screening approaches are part of “ g e n e t i c
c o u n s e l l i n g ” , a term used to describe a ve ry sen-
s i t i ve process in which people basically decide what
kinds of individuals are born .We already see this
selection process at work with health policies in
some countries encouraging women to take pre-
n atal tests for Dow n ’s Syndrome.
In the next phase of genetic research, g e n e t i-
cists will develop a range of treatments for genetic
d i s o r d e rs , including gene therapy,n ow just in their
ve ry early stages.This research is raising wild hopes,
from the ability to cure certain cancers to comba-
ting the 4,000 to 5,000 genetic illnesses identifie d
so fa r. Some geneticists are already dreaming of
g e rm-line therapy in which genetic changes are
passed along to future generat i o n s. Indeed scien-
tists like A m e rican Lee Silver foresee the rise of a
new discipline:“ r e p r o g e n e t i c s ” which will com-
bine cloning and genetic engi n e e ring techniques
to one day “ e n h a n c e ” in vitro embryos (pp. 2 7 -
2 8 ) . Enhancement could take a va riety of form s :
from improving resistance to disease to modifying
b e h avioural or physical traits with a view to pro-
ducing the “child of parents’ d r e a m s ” .

For now, these scenarios are not only techni-
cally impossible but legally prohibited: r e p r o d u c-
t i ve cloning of humans (pp.32-33) and germ - l i n e
therapy are forbidden.But they are wa rning signs
for those who fear that medicine will be used as a
way of selecting and controlling “ g o o d ”and “ b a d ”
g e n e s.“ We are on the verge of a new eugenic age,”
wa rn the serried ranks of philosophers ,p ri e s t s ,
human rights campaigners and anti-abort i o n
gr o u p s.Their cry has sparked a major bioethical
d e b ate on two fronts.The first revo l ves around the
ve ry definition of eugenics (see glossary ) , an emo-
tionally charged word closely associated with the
h o rr o rs of Nazism (pp. 2 2 - 2 3 ) . S e c o n d l y, w i l l
a d vances in genetics gi ve rise to new forms of euge-
n i c s ?
Asian countries (pp.30-31) and Arab Gulf stat e s
already have laws denying the disabled the right to
be born .According to Noëlle Lenoir, f o rmer pre-
sident of UNESCO’s Intern ational Bioethics Com-
mittee (IBC),“in societies already plagued by  dis-
c ri m i n at i o n , genetics could become another
i n s t rument of exclusion.” Can any society claim
t h at it is untainted by this social ill? Certainly not
those which deem girls inferior (p. 2 9 ) .
What is normality? 
The debate over eugenics reminds us that there
is no such thing as a “ p e r f e c t ”b a b y.The human
gene pool cannot be “ c l e a n e d ” up  because, a s
scientists point out, new genetic anomalies deve-
lop with each generat i o n . B e s i d e s , genetic engi-
n e e ring is an inherently risky endeavour because
it is impossible to predict which genes our des-
cendants may need in the future.
A host of fundamental ethical questions also
a ri s e .Tests to detect late onset diseases raise the
problem of defining a life wo rth living. A genetic
disease like “ H u n t i n g t o n ’s chorea usually deve-
lops between the ages of 38 and 45,” s ays French
geneticist and bioethicist A xel Kahn.“ Yet think of
all the gr e at artists and musicians who died befo-
re reaching 40.We see here the difficulty in say i n g
t h at a life isn’t wo rth living if it ends or suddenly
d e t e ri o r ates at a certain age.”
Another thorny question lies in defining “ n o r-
m a l i t y ” . I m a gine the discri m i n ation directed
t owards handicapped people in a society accusto-
med to the idea of eliminating genetic “ d e f e c t s ” ?
M a ny bioethicists such as IBC president Ryuichi
Ida also see gr ave dangers potentially arising from
the “genetic enhancement” of embryo s.To begi n
w i t h , new inequalities would develop between those
who could afford such “ t r e at m e n t ” and those lac-
king access to it (pp. 2 7 - 2 8 ) .
We must also ask whether parents have the ri g h t
to “ d e s i g n ” the child of their dreams? “A child is
a separate and complete individual who cannot be
reduced to the expectations of his or her parents,”
s ays Kahn.“Being a parent is supposed to be about
l oving a child as he or she is.Parenting is not about
r e q u i ring a child to be as you would like him or her
to be. In this respect, children are in danger.”

Yet brandishing the spectre of eugenics is sim-
plistic and dangerous, insist many scientists, b i o-
technology exe c u t i ve s ,b i o e t h i c i s t s , and feminists.
F u rt h e rm o r e ,a n t i - a b o rtion groups might mani-
p u l ate the debate to curtail women's hard-wo n
rights to control their own fertility (pp. 2 2 - 2 3 ) .
There may also be a positive side to “ l a i s s e z
fa i r e ” or “ u t o p i a n ”e u g e n i c s — t e rms which are
sparking a flu rry of discussion in affluent We s t e rn
c o u n t ri e s. M a ny bioethicists and scientists main-
tain that these new forms of eugenics simply des-
c ribe the choices individuals—not the state or the
community—will be able to make about the kind
of children they want to bring into the wo r l d .B u t
h ow will commercial pressures and interests dri ve
these decisions? “With sufficient adve rt i s i n g, t h e
biotechnology market will make parents feel guil-
ty if they don't consume” all the genetic tests and
s e rvices ava i l a b l e ,s ays Lori A n d r e w s , an A m e ri-
can legal expert in the field (pp. 2 8 - 2 9 ) .
As geneticists point out, science and medicine
h ave always advanced by violating social taboos.
Scientists should not be penalized for the ways in
which society uses their discove ri e s.The ethical
p ath lies in giving people time to reflect on the
consequences of scientific progr e s s.
“Individuals eve rywhere are faced with more
and more ethical dilemmas,” s ays Lenoir.“In some
way s ,i t ’s easier when you live in an authori t a ri a n
or religious society.The rules are laid out before
you (pp. 2 4 -2 6 ) . But in culturally dive rse and secu-
lar societies, where people have access to info rm at i o n
and can stand up for their ri g h t s,i t ’s much harder to set
g u i d e l i n e s.This is wh at gave birth to bioethics.” n
