While London was still being battered by the
air raids of World War II (right), ministers of
education of the Allied Governments met there
in 1942, to study common problems of educa-
tion. In November 1945, shortly after the war
ended, a meeting in London attended by rep-
resentatives of 44 countries drew up the C. ons-
titution of Unesco. On November 4, 1946, fol-
lowing its acceptance by 20 states, this docu-
ment became the official birth certificate of
Unesco. Below we reproduce the Preamble and
Article I of the Constitution. Lower right,
