School is an ideal place to make young people aware of the danger of A i d s. But the
topic is delicate and all the harder to handle with precious few re s o u rc e s

Ed u c ating schoolchildren about Aids is some-
thing ve ry recent in developing countri e s —
when it happens at all. M a ny politicians, s c h o o l
p rincipals and teachers are trapped by sexual taboos
and believe Aids education encourages young people
to have sex. Only in 1997 did a report by UN A I D S
(entitled E f fects of sex education on young people’s
sexual behav i o u r) come out showing there was no
such danger at all.
The situation is finally beginning to change.
M a ny developing countries have now taken the
plunge and Aids education is part of their school
c u rri c u l a .S o m e t i m e s , subterfuges have to be used.
I n d o n e s i a , a Muslim country, has chosen to talk
about “reproductive health education” instead of
sex education.Many countries have followed suit.
Senegal’s pioneering 
programmes
In West and Central Africa,the subject is tack-
led in “family life and population education” pro-
grammes which offer a multi-disciplinary mix of
b i o l o g y, home economics and health, civic and
moral educat i o n .H owe ve r ,d i f ficulties lie not just in
devising programmes but also in teaching them
e f f e c t i ve l y. In most countri e s , the programmes have
not yet been endorsed by the government.
Senegal is a pioneer in the field and family educa-
tion is even taught in pri m a ry schools there. S i n c e
1 9 9 4 , a Senegalese NGO, Group for Research and
D e velopment on Po p u l ation and Education (GE E P)
has set up 140 family education clubs, i nvolving 52
per cent of the country ’s secondary schools. In 1997,
three such clubs were started at Dakar Unive rs i t y.
So far more than 2,000 pupils, a third of them
gi r l s , h ave completed training as group leaders.
Their job is to make their fellow students, as well as
young people not in school, aware of Aids through
cultural day s , fa i rs and holiday camp activities.Te a-
c h e rs help them by looking after administrat i ve
m at t e rs. D u ring the 1997-98 school ye a r , their wo r k
involved about 45,000 young people,representing
32 per cent of all secondary school students.
In A s i a , the situation va ries widely from coun-
t ry to country.T h a i l a n d ,C a m b o d i a ,L a o s ,Viet Nam
and Sri Lanka have well-established prevention pro-
grammes which are part of formal educat i o n ,w h i l e
Nepal, Pakistan,Bangladesh and the Maldives are
only just getting start e d . In India, an Aids awa r e-
ness campaign is supposed to be part of phy s i c a l
e d u c ation and courses in “social useful productive
wo r k ” . But often teachers do not even know such
p r o grammes exist, so they have to make do by them-
s e l ve s. In the most remote parts of India and elsew-
h e r e , t e a c h e rs with little knowledge of Aids are
expected to initiate an open discussion about sexua-
lity with classes of 50 to 80 pupils without the help
of books on the subject.This is asking too much.
Teachers: overcoming
their own inhibitions
“One of my students asked me a question about
Aids which I just didn’t know how to answe r , so I said
it wa s n ’t the subject we were dealing with,” a d m i t t e d
a history teacher in A f rica during a seminar in Lomé
( Togo) in A p ril 1999. “But I had the feeling it wa s
the first time the child had dared to ask the question
and I fear he wo n ’t dare ask it again.”
The teachers , t h e m s e l ves inhibited, do not
k n ow how to tackle the subject. In West A f ri c a ,o n l y
Guinea has arranged for Aids education at the
N ational Te a c h e rs ’C o l l e g e , while Burkina Faso and
3 The classro o m
and beyond

Togo are focusing on secondary school teachers.
The other countries have made little headway.
Te a c h e rs also need to have access to interactive
teaching methods so they can create an at m o s p h e r e
of confidence to encourage young people to voice their
c o n c e rns and learn to protect themselve s. But tea-
ching mat e rials are seriously lacking.At the begi n n i n g
of the 1990s, UN E S C O and the World Health Organi-
z ation (WHO) published some manuals for school
c u rriculum planners suggesting activities for pupils
and how teachers might approach the subject (see
b ox ) .S e veral thousand of these well-produced guides
were pri n t e d , but there are 55 million teachers in the
wo r l d . More recently,Togo put out a brochure for
s c h o o l c h i l d r e n , but it was distri buted only pri vat e l y.
Reach children 
when they’re young
Even when appropriate tools are available,tea-
chers do not always make use of them.Experience
shows that young teachers,who adapt much more
easily to new approaches, are the ones to rely on.
As a ru l e , nobody is really prepared to talk to yo u n g
people about sex.Parents do not feel up to the job
and pass it on to the teachers who in turn pass it
back to the family or the church.This is especially
so in majori t y - C atholic countri e s , mainly in Lat i n
A m e ri c a , where condoms are still sometimes regar-
ded as “an instrument of the devil.” S u rveys by
UNAIDS show that when young people are we l l -
i n f o rmed about the disease, they protect themselve s
more effectively than adults. In Chile, Brazil and
Mexico, boys between 15 and 18 are the most fre-
quent users of condoms.
But education authorities still balk at preve n t i o n
p r o grammes and do not like to recognize that yo u n g
people are sexually active .E ven though premari t a l
sex is frowned upon, it is common among teenagers ,
who change part n e rs more often than adults.This is
w hy about half the new cases of infection are found
among people between 15 and 24. So they must be
wa rned about Aids as early as possible.
The ideal age to start preve n t i ve education is
about seve n , according to expert s. Children of that
age do not have inhibitions, express themselve s
openly at school and freely pass on what they learn
to the rest of their family and are thus excellent
agents of communicat i o n . It is too late to begi n
introducing this education in secondary school
because between a quarter and a half of all school-
children in developing countries drop out of school
after five ye a rs. P r o grammes outside school are the-
refore vital to combat A i d s. There are some, bu t
not enough progr a m m e s , which mainly reach chil-
dren in big towns.
So there is a great deal of work to be done.But
people are clearly becoming aware of the problem.
After two decades of silence, the issue of Aids has
finally reached the horizon of the classroom. n
