Considerations
of a Soviet
demographer
by Boris Urlanis
BORIS URLANIS is one of the Soviet
Union's leading demographers and statis¬
ticians. Professor of demography at the
Institute of Economics, U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences, he has written many books
and studies, and in particular on the
theory of statistics and on the relationship
between war and the population of Europe.
His latest book, "War and Population" , is
shortly to be published in English, French
and Spanish by Progress Publishers,
Moscow.
OMEN are generally re¬
garded as being the "weaker sex",
and in terms of physical strength this
is true. But demography has shown
us that In 'reality it is men who are
the weaker sex.
This weakness is apparent right
from birth. Soviet demographers
have noted, for example, that of the
2,175,000 boys born in the U.S.S.R.
in 1966, 63,000 (29 out of every 1,000)
died during their first year. Of the
2,066,000 girls born the same year,

MEN DIE EARLIER
THAN WOMEN
48,000 (23 out of every 1,000) died
within a year. The difference, as we
see, Is considerable.
Yet the early development of baby
boys differs very little from that of
baby girls, and boys are not the
victims of maternal neglect since
mothers lavish affection on all their
children, regardless of sex.
This being the case, what is the
real reason for the higher death rate
among baby boys? The obvious
explanation would seem to be that
girls are constitutionally stronger than
boys, thanks to the greater biological
resistance of the female organism, a
resistance which has developed over
a period of hundreds of thousands
of years. Nature seems to have
recognized that the lives of women
are more important for the survival
of the human race than those of men.
Without disputing the findings of the
biologist, let us see what we can
learn from the studies of the demo¬
grapher. How do the death rates of
men compare with those of women?
In 1968, the U.S.S.R. Central
Statistical Office published mortality
figures for the Soviet Union classified
by sex and age. These showed that
the death rate of male teen-agers
(15 to 19 age group) Is twice as high
as that of female teen-agers. This
"mortality gap" widens In the higher
age groups. The death rate of men
aged between 25 and 29 is two and
a half times that of women in the same
age group. Thereafter the death rate
for men twice as high as for women
remains constant until extreme old age.
There Is no simple biological
explanation for this "mortality gap",
but there are other causes which we
can identify and study.
A,IS far back as 360 years
ago it was known that six per cent
more boys were born than girls.
Unfortunately, this preponderance of
male births, which might have ensured
the numerical equality of the sexes,
rapidly vanishes during the years of
infancy, childhood and adolescence.
Both sexes are about numerically
equal in the 20 to 24 age group, after
which women begin to move into the
lead, and the difference increases with
age. According to the latest U.S.S.R.
census, women In the 20 to 24 age
group outnumbered men by 230,000,
and in the 25 to 29 age group by
350,000. This difference grows stead¬
ily and rapidly in the older age groups.
But supposing things were different.
It is easy to imagine the tremendous
benefits that would be enjoyed in every
sphere of life if there were as many
adult men as women.
Let us first look at the economic
advantages. Each person can be
considered as a sort of "accumulator"
of resources such as food, upbringing
and education which are provided by
the family and the community. It Is
not difficult to calculate the total of
these "Investments" since we know
the costs of bringing up children and
teen-agers.
Having reckoned up all the money
spent on a person until he begins to
work, one Is tempted to think of him as
"capital" and everything he produces
throughout his working life as the
return on this capital. But as we all
know, a man's life cannot be expressed
in terms of money. Man himself is
not a "capital"; he creates capital by
leaving behind him the fruits material
and spiritual of his life's work.
Since it is during the most pro¬
ductive period of a man's working life
that his death rate rises to two and
a half times that of a woman, it is
easy to imagine the economic loss
suffered by the community.
The higher death rate among men
is also responsible for much disruption
of family life. The death of a husband
creates a terrible gap. If a mother Is
left to bring up her children alone, the
life of everyone in the family suffers.
The life of a widow Is generally
difficult. Her chances of re-marrying
and bringing into the family a step¬
father for her children are slight.
Statistics show that there are many
widows, but few widowers. A man,
however, very often remarries fairly
soon after losing his wife.
Remarriage for a woman in the
U.S.S.R. is difficult for several reasons,
the main one being the dispro¬
portionately lower number of men.
And it is particularly so for women who
are no longer young and have children
to look after. "Men do everything
they can to make sure that there
won't be enough of them to go round,"
complains the heroine in one play.

The shortage of men, due to their
higher death rate, has distressing
repercussions on many aspects of life.
It explains why there are hundreds of
thousands of "broken" families and
why countless women are deprived of
the benefits of a normal family life.
One might think of war as the
decisive factor in the high rate of male
mortality, but this is not the case.
Almost all men at present under the
age of 42 In the U.S.S.R. took no part
in the Second World War. Moreover,
the male death rate for the age group
30 to 40 exceeds the female .death
rate by a greater percentage than that
of other age groups. The cause,
therefore, is not war and all its
consequences, but the fact that we
pay considerably less attention to
preserving the health of men than that
of women.
What can be done to "equal the
chances" of longevity? Firstly, we
can see to it that everyone clearly
understands the risks they run through
the abuse of alcohol and tobacco or
the use of drugs. Alcoholism and
drug addiction cause serious losses
to society and the economy, sow
dissension in the home and increase
the number of divorces. Men in
particular are victims of alcoholism,
which undermines their health and
causes many cases of alcohol
poisoning, cirrhosis of the liver and
heart disorders.
s,IMOKING is also a harm¬
ful habit. Yet the consumption of
tobacco is increasing rapidly, espe¬
cially among adolescents. Men gener¬
ally are heavier smokers than women,
and the sale of cigarettes has risen
during the last few years to the point
where an average of almost one
packet per man smoker or not is
smoked every day. Undoubtedly this
increase in smoking is multiplying the
number of deaths caused by lung can¬
cer and other illnesses due to the
consumption of tobacco. A full-scale
campaign against smoking should be
launched without delay. But to be
effective, it will need to do far more
than merely lecture people on "the
harmful effects of tobacco."
In the Soviet Union, the average life
expectancy is 66 for men and 74 for
women. However, throughout the
world the average life span varies
greatly from country to country,
particularly for men. Studies on
longevity based on statistics from
75 countries show that in only five of
them is the average life span greater
for men than women. Four of these
are Asian countries India, Pakistan,
Cambodia and Ceylon and the fifth
is Upper Volta in Africa.
In the remaining 70 countries women
have a greater life span than men.
The extent of this difference is shown
in the following table:

Each year, millions of new vehicles
pour out of the world's automobile and
truck factories. In North America
alone, sales of automobiles will top
the 10 million mark in 1969.
Road accidents, as we know, are
responsible for a high proportion of
all deaths due to accidental causes,
and it is also a fact that most of the
world's road vehicles are driven by
men.
Greater emphasis on safety in car
design steering columns that collapse
on impact, safety belts as standard
fittings, rear head supports, etc.
would help to safeguard millions of
men against the threat of sudden and
premature death during the most active
and productive period of their lives.
In this article I have wished to draw
attention to the problem of lengthening
the life span of men. One often reads
books and articles in which it is said
that people can and should live to
be 100, 120 and even 150. There are
of courses cases of people living to
such a ripe old age, but they are
exceptions to the rule.
So when certain authors proclaim
that man's life span can be almost
doubled, they are really only "building
castles in the air," or inventing their
own fantasies. I make no comment
about science fiction elucubrations
that man will one day live forever.
To return from these fantasies to
the sad realities of the world, one
must realize that the problem of
lengthening man's life span really boils
down to shortening the gap between
the life span of men and women. Of
course, this does not stop us from also
working for a long life span for
everybody, including a longer life span
for women.
But we should face the fact that in
the more developed countries we have
gone almost as far as we can in this
domain with our present knowledge
and techniques.
By saying that the life span of men
and women should be the same, I in
no way wish to diminish the importance
of women. Women, who often carry
the double burden of working all day
and running a home as well, deserve
our admiration, as do men who work
long hours and have many community
and family obligations. Nevertheless,
from the demographical point of view,
men remain "the weaker sex".
