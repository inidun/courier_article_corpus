KARL VON FRISCH
TO BE AWARDED
KALINGA PRIZE
Karl von Frisch,
famed for his find¬
ings on the "lan¬
guage" of bees and
considered' the most
distinguished living
investigator of the
sensorial physiology
of insects and fishes,
will be awarded the
£1,000 Kalinga Prize
for the populariza¬
tion of science on
March 26, at Unesco
House in Paris.
Professor von
Frisch is the author
of over a hundred
scientific works, the
most remarkable of
which deal .with his research into the world
of bees (Dancing Bees: an account of the life
and sßnses of the honey bee, 1955; Bees, their
Vision, Chemical Senses and Language. 1951).
. The studies, written in a simple, non-technical
style, helped to solve the mystery of how
insects as Well as birds possess such an
uncanny sense of direction. Von Frisch
showed that the eyes of bees see polarized
light in the sky, thus enabling them to
distinguish zones of different shades by which
they can orient themselves. Most startling of
all, he revealed that bees, after discovering
a good source of nectar, return to the hive
and perform a ballet dance to communicate
the distance and direction of the food to the
other members of the hive.
Born in Vienna in 1886, Professor von Frisch
studied medicine and natural science in his
native city and in Munich. Successively
director of the zoological institutes of the
Universities of Rostock, Breslau, Graz and
Munich, he retired last April and now lives in
Munich. His other books include You and
Life (A . Modern Biology for Everyman),
Memoirs of a Biologist, and works on the
sense of hearing and the colour-sense of
fishes.
The Kalinga Prize is awarded by the Kalinga
Foundation (State of Orissa, India). Its
winner is chosen annually by an international
jury appointed by Unesco; its purpose is to
offer recognition to leading interpreters of
science and also to strengthen links between
India and scientists of all nations. Last year
the prize was awarded to Lord Bertrand
Russell of the United Kingdom. (See The
Unesco Courier February 1958.)
