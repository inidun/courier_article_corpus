Chile’s two-track therapy
Ultra-liberal economic measures strongly backed up by state intervention
have reduced poverty, but there are still glaring inequalities
n
Chile is the only country in Latin A m e ri c a
where pove rty has substantially diminished
over the past decade.The United Nations Eco-
nomic Commission for Latin A m e ri c a , based in
Santiago de Chile, says the trend began in 1987
under the Pinochet dictat o rs h i p, t wo ye a rs before the
return of democracy.
In that ye a r , 39 per cent of Chileans lived below
the poverty line. By 1996, the figure had almost
halved, to 20 per cent. Chile’s president, Eduardo
Frei,says two million of his country’s 14.5 million
people have emerged from pove rty since 1990 and
that the incidence of poverty has fallen by half.
There seem to be three major reasons for this:
sustained economic gr ow t h , increased social spen-
ding and the launching of several job-creation pro-
grammes. All the politicians claim credit for it, of
course.The right wing, pointing out that poverty
began to decline towards the end of military rule,
claims it was largely the result of ultra-liberal eco-
nomic policies applied since 1978.
General Augusto Pinochet brought in econo-
mists from Milton Fri e d m a n ’s “Chicago school”
of monetarists and Chile became the first Lat i n
A m e rican country to rigorously deregulate and pri-
vatize its economy, open up markets and cut taxes.
I n f l ation was tamed, gr owth began again and
foreign inve s t o rs flocked to Chile, which became
k n own as “the jaguar of the South” in the lat e
1980s.
The “Chicago Boy s ” had promised exceptional
p r o s p e rity and an automatic decline in pove rt y.
But the ranks of the poor shrank only slowly. And
as street protests grew with the approach of the
1988 and 1989 elections, the regime came up with
a raft of social measures.
President Pat ricio Ay lw i n , elected in 1989, a n d
his successor, Eduardo Frei, who has been in powe r
since 1994, took deliberate steps to reduce pove rty and
counter the negat i ve effects of ultra-liberal policies,
which had tolerated a high rate of pove rt y.At the same
t i m e , gr owth remained strong—an average of 7 per cent
a year between 1991 and 1997 until it slowed down last
year from the effects of the Asian financial cri s i s.
In 1996, 71 per cent of all government expen-
diture went to the social sector and minimum wa g e s
rose 55 per cent in real terms between 1989 and
1996, which was faster than labour productivity.
Business was called upon to share the cost of this
dramatic switch and did not object overmuch to
paying taxes on their increased profits. However, a
supertax on the rich would have set off a storm of
protest,so was out of the question.
Along with this effort to redistribute wealth as
p a rt of President Ay lw i n ’s “ fair deve l o p m e n t ”p r o-
gramme, steps were taken to encourage new busi-
n e s s e s. Utilities like electri c i t y, t e l e p h o n e s , d ri n-
king water and adult education were subsidized.
Other programmes sent young professionals off to
the country ’s poorest regions to stimulate deve-
lopment there using local labour.
The Solidarity and Social Investment Fund
(FOSIS) has also played a big part and today
finances more than 18,000 production projects put
together by rural fa m i l i e s , fis h e rm e n ,r e p r e s e n t at i ve s
of Indian peoples and small bu s i n e s s e s.The seve n -
year-old fund also has a budget to train people for
these projects.
But there is still a “social debt” which Chile
has not yet been able to wipe out:the gap between
the ve ry rich and the ve ry poor. A recent Wo r l d
Bank report shows that Chile is one of the world’s
ten countries where inequalities are most pro-
nounced.The richest 10 per cent of its population
have incomes 30 times bigger than the poorest 10
per cent.This huge gap is Chile’s challenge for the
future, despite the great progress made so far in
reducing poverty. n
