“ We owe 38 ye a rs of sporting achievement to the
unconditional backing Cuban sport has receive d
from the revo l u t i o n a ry Gove rnment and especially
from our commander-in-chief Fidel Castro,”s ays Hum-
b e rto Rodríguez, President of the National Institute
for Sport ,P hysical Education and Recreation of Cuba
( I N D E R ) , founded in 1961.The results speak for them-
s e l ve s. With only 11 million inhabitants and despite
s e vere economic cri s i s ,Cuba came fifth in the Olympic
medal rankings at Barcelona in 1992, and eighth at
Atlanta in 1996. At the Pa n - A m e rican leve l , it ranks
s e c o n d , after the United Stat e s.
“Mass invo l vement in sport and highly effic i e n t
s t ructures have made it possible for big stars to emerge,”
s ays Norge Marr e r o,n ational commissioner for row i n g .
Cuba has 31,700 physical education instru c t o rs , one for
e ve ry 458 inhabitants, compared with one teacher for
e ve ry 42 pers o n s , and one doctor for eve ry 170. Fo r
1 9 9 9 , the budget for sport is 125 million Cuban pesos
(the same figure in U. S . d o l l a rs at the official rat e ,
although the semi-official rate is 20 to the dollar), w h i c h
is equivalent to the budget for culture and science.
“ S p o rt is part of the people’s culture,” M a rrero adds,
“because people have learned that sport means quality
of life and health.”
H i g h e r ,s t r o n g e r , faster . . . and more revo l u t i o n a ry.
Outside the sports arena, a Cuban athlete may be
t r e ated as a prince or a villain, depending on an ima-
gi n a ry borderline traced by his own loyalty to the
s t at e .The boxer Te ó filo Steve n s o n , Olympic champion
in 1972, 1976 and 1980, was admitted to the “revo-
lutionary hall of fame” because he rejected lucrative
professional contracts abroad. A different fate has
awaited other eminent sportsmen and wo m e n ,
mostly baseball players, who, having opted for the
t e m p t ations of professional status and for exile,
have had their names struck off the official roster.
Desertions are a thorn in the revolution’s side.
But according to Rodríguez,Cuban sport “ c a n n o t
ignore a century marked by globalization and neo-libe-
r a l i s m ” . The champion of amat e u ri s m , it has been
forced willy-nilly to wade into a sea of professionalism
and excessive commercializat i o n .After the collapse of
its main partner and backer, the Soviet Union, C u b a
has begun a process of cautious transform at i o n ,o p e-
ning the door to certain aspects of the market economy.
As a consequence of the hard ye a rs of crisis (1989-
1 9 9 3 ) , when gross domestic product (GDP) fell pre-
cipitously by some 37 per cent, most of the island’s
11,000 sports facilities suffered serious deteri o r at i o n
and even the nutritional system in its training centres
was affected. In order to find a way out, Cuba has
devised a complex system that enables it to obtain eco-
nomic resources through Cubadeport e s , an enter-
p rise set up in 1991 under the authority of INDER.
Drumming up funds
The chief function of Cubadeportes is to seek
funding for Cuban sport .At present its main source
of income, the amount of which is not publicly dis-
closed, is provided by some 600 trainers who are
spread over four continents. It has also introduced
a new scheme whereby leading Cuban sports fig u r e s
are prepared to take up temporary contracts in vo l-
leyball clubs in Italy, basketball clubs in Argentina
and handball clubs in France and Hungary.
F i rst-class athletes are considered privileged com-
pared with the run of the populat i o n .They can win
p rizes in dollars or in kind (cars and apartments) in
exchange for a contri bution to the state for its support
in terms of training, board and lodgi n g .There are no
o f ficial figures for the income of sportsmen and
wo m e n , but it is reckoned that a member of a nat i o n a l
team is paid about 500 Cuban pesos a month ($25 at
the semi-official rat e ) , while the average monthly
wage of a Cuban worker is about $11.
J u d ging by the results achieved in intern at i o n a l
c o m p e t i t i o n s , Cuban muscle serves the ideals of the
r e vo l u t i o n .S p o rt is a jewel that is proudly shown to
the outside world and acts as an incentive within the
c o u n t ry. In the words of Rodríguez, its challenge is
“to enhance the role of the individual, by prov i d i n g
a better grasp of patriotic values and of national
identity”. n
