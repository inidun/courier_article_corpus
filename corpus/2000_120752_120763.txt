the cinema will carry us
Cinema was authorized by the Islamic Republic for propaganda purposes, but a new
generation of directors is offering the world a very different image of Iran
2.NEW WAV E S
In Iran,cinema did not become legitimate (in
the eyes of believers) until the revolution of
February 1979. Before that political upheaval,
which stemmed from widespread dissatisfac-
tion with the Shah’s regime and resulted in an
“Islamic Republic” headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the seventh art had drawn thundering
condemnation from the clergy.
Movies first appeared in Iran at the start of the
twentieth century, and Muslim clerics voiced their
opposition to the new art form as soon as the first
theatres opened in Tehran in 1904.Several cinemas
were burned down, with sometimes tragic conse-
quences:in August 1978,400 people lost their lives
at the Rex in the city of Abadan.Mullahs believed
the movie theatre to be a symbol of the godless
West and a competitor to the mosque, thus making
it a direct threat to their power.F u r t h e r m o r e,m o v i e s
were considered blasphemous because they fea-
tured images of women without veils and, l a t e r,
scenes of dancing accompanied by music.
Fanatical believers could not tolerate the icono-
graphical portrayal of humans: God alone is the
“ C r e a t o r ” and the “ C r a f t s m a n ” of living beings.
Mosque decorations, especially in Iran, contain no
figurative representations, and for centuries the
power of words dominated Iranian society.Wi t h o u t
any tradition of visual artistic expression (with the
exception of miniatures in the 14th and 15th centu-
r i e s ) , “ i m a g i n a t i v e ” representation became the
domain of writers and, above all, p o e t s.
Between 1930 and 1979, approximately 1,100
feature films were shown in 420 theatres,but not one
of them met with the ayatollahs’ approval. R i g i d l y

Iranian director Moshen Makhmalbaf with his youngest daughter. A former supporter of the Islamic regime, his views have been transformed by cinema.

Muslim parents even beat their children for going to
the movies. But when Khomeini took power, a
strange reversal occurred. O v e r n i g h t , the cinema
became of interest to everybody, including the cle-
r i c s.As in other areas, the new regime took control
of everything.It confiscated images and made its own
visual style omnipresent on television,in newspapers,
on walls and in movie theatres. The blessed and
p u r i fied seventh art had won its legitimacy, t h o u g h
foreign cinema, which flies in the face of Islamic
v a l u e s, was banned. As a result, the national fil m
industry had no competitors on Iranian soil.
During his exile in Fr a n c e,Ayatollah Khomeini
had become aware of the image’s role as an effec-
tive political propaganda tool. Back in Tehran, he
saw Dariush Mehrjui’s film The Cow (1969) on
television. The film, with a style close to realism,
focuses on the troubled lives of impoverished far-
mers in a remote village,where one character iden-
t i fies with his dead cow, the only property he owns.
This movie inspired the religious leader to make a
speech on the educational role of film.
Setting the wheels 
of dissent in motion
As early as the first year of the revolution,all parts
of the state worked hard to create an “ I s l a m i c
c i n e m a ”that would move in “the right direction.”A t
the very same time, a rival style of cinema, d r a w i n g
on the tradition of high-quality filmmaking from
before 1979, was also born. A few fil m m a k e r s
managed to create a language that skirted around the
relentless censorship,drawing inspiration from eve-
ryday life (through a fusion between documentary
and fiction) and from Persian poetry.The freshness
and innocence of their films struck a chord with the
p u b l i c. The film directors also learned to play one
state body against another,especially as the various
appoined officials changed position frequently.
The new cinema’s leading representative,A b b a s
Kiarostami, who also co-founded the filmmaking
department at the Institute for the Intellectual
Development of Children and Young Adults in
1 9 6 9 , uses his camera to challenge Khomeini’s cine-
matic precepts. As Iran and Iraq braced for a par-
ticularly murderous war (1980-1988), the new
regime, after just a few months of nascent demo-
c r a cy, took a much harder line. In this grim context,
Abbas Kiarostami made at the end of 1979 Alter-
native 1,Alternative 2, an indictment of informers
that lays bare the ineptitude of various social classes,
including the clergy. The movie was banned and
never approved for release. But Kiarostami, who
says that he is a secular director,had set the wheels
in motion of a form of filmmaking that would prove
a formidable adversary to the regime.
K i a r o s t a m i ’s films criticized the mullahs’ hold
over society. In H o m e w o r k ( 1 9 9 0 ) , he attacked the
brainwashing of children.Th e n ,with Taste of Cherry
( 1 9 9 7 ) ,he focused on suicide,which is against Islamic
l a w, and whose causes must be sought in people’s
despair over Iran’s rigid social structures. A n o t h e r
barrier fell with The Wind Will Carry Us ( 1 9 9 9 ) ,
which casts doubt on the existence of an after- l i f e.
Kiarostami is not the only director to have chal-
lenged Iranian society. In B a s h u ,The Little Stranger
( 1 9 8 7 ) ,Bahram Beyzaï condemned the terrible conse-
quences of the holy war against Iraq.So did Mohsen
Makhmalbaf in Marriage of the Blessed ( 1 9 8 9 ) .A m i r
Naderi focused on the authorities’ attitude towards
soldiers missing-in-action at the beginning of the war,
which he gave an alternative account of in the as yet
unreleased S e a r ch 2.With The Runner ( 1 9 8 5 ) ,N a d e r i
became the first director since the revolution to give
leading parts to children, who went on to become
some of Iran’s most popular movie “ a c t o r s ” .
This is noteworthy because
Iran is undergoing a demographic
b o o m .The population has nearly
doubled in the past 20 years, a n d
almost half of all Iranians are
under 20. Film directors noticed
that the authorities were failing
to take these figures seriously,
and—drawing on the saying that
words of truth come from the
mouths of babes—they cast chil-
dren to explore facets of everyday
l i f e.
From a whimsical cinematic
style partly based on Egyptian
and Indian B-movies, Iranian fil m s
made the transition to something
between “Italian neo-realism” a n d
“ French new wave,” s h a t t e r i n g
taboos and washing Iran’s dirty
laundry in public. Worst of all in
the mullahs’ eyes, this new cinema
captured the imagination and the
talent of the regime’s apologists.
The most stunning example of this
is Mohsen Makhmalbaf. A pure
product of the protests that
marked the end of the Shah’s rule,
he spent four years in jail before
being released in 1979. He was
fully committed to the new regime
and directed the Islamic A r t i s t i c
Theatre Centre, a propaganda
o r g a n i z a t i o n , before gradually moving towards
c i n e m a .With the complete trust of the authorities,h e
then directed The Pe d d l e r ( 1 9 8 7 ) , which caused a
sensation by openly criticizing the regime and
denouncing the “lies of the mosque.”When journa-
lists asked him, “ M a k h m a l b a f, what have you
become? Are you stepping out of line?” he replied,
“ I ’ve discovered cinema,and it has changed the way
I look at the world.”
On a trip to Europe, Makhmalbaf was so deeply
moved by Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire that he
made blasphemous remarks on his return to Iran.“ I f
God must send a new prophet, his name will be
Wim Wenders,” he declared. He then made a film

challenging the dogma of Islamic society, Time of
L ov e ( 1 9 9 0 ) , about an affair between a married
woman and her lover. Contrary to all expectations,
the movie was shown at the Tehran film festival
the same year, where it drew huge crowds in just a
few screenings (though it was not cleared for general
release). That event, in part, cost Makhmalbaf his
position at the Ministry of Culture, which at the
time was headed by none other than the current pre-
sident,Mohammad Khatami.
The 1990s marked a turning point.The West was
surprised to discover a different Iran at film festivals,
with Iranian movies addressing themes such as friend-
s h i p, tolerance and togetherness.A time of honours
and awards had begun. “ O n c e, Iran exported oil,
rugs and pistachios.Now it can add movies to the list.
Iran exports its culture, which is a good thing,” s a i d
K i a r o s t a m i , who won the 1997 Golden Palm at
Cannes for Taste of Cherry. In 2000, three Iranian
filmmakers won prizes at Cannes, including Makh-
m a l b a f’s 20-year-old daughter,S a m i r a , the youngest
award-winner in the festival’s history, for B l a ck-
b o a rd s. Bahman Ghobadi, m e a n w h i l e, won the
Golden Camera award for A Time for Drunken
H o r s e s and Hassan Yektapanah for D j o m e h.
Iran is a veritable breeding ground for fresh
cinematic talent.To d a y, around 20 gifted directors,
including Kiarostami,M a k h m a l b a f, Ja l i l i ,M e h r j u i ,
B e y z a ï , Fo r o z e s h , Naderi and Panahi, make 15 per
cent of the 60 films that the country produces each
y e a r.The limits of this cinema, which is shattering
the last taboos, are still unknown.
For the first time,a feature fil m ,The Circle,w h i c h
reaped the Golden Lion at the 2000 Venice Film Fe s-
t i v a l , deals with prostitution, a topic that had pre-
viously been totally off-limits in the Islamic republic.
Fo r t y - y e a r-old Jafar Panahi, who had already won
the Golden Camera award at Cannes in 1995 for T h e
White Balloon, made this outstanding film without
even submitting the script to Iran’s censorship com-
m i t t e e.A willingness to test the regime’s limits can also
be witnessed among writers and journalists, some of
whom were killed or imprisoned in 1999. A r r e s t s
have continued since the beginning of the year.
Female directors have encountered even more
h u r d l e s, but they too have found a place behind
the camera in making films about the condition of
w o m e n . For example, Rakhshan Banni-Etemad,
Tahminé Milani and a dozen or so others are making
names for themselves in Iran’s “ m a c h o - I s l a m i c ”
s o c i e t y. Young Iranian exiles who studied in the
West are also going back home,bringing a different
vision of Iran with them. For example Babak
P a y a m i , who directed the remarkable A Day More,
a film about love, lived in Canada.
Iran has adopted the modern imagery coined by
films. Whether in documentary or fiction, Iranian
cinema has liberated itself and become part of peo-
ple’s day-to-day lives. All Iranians are now spell-
bound by images,“whether it is a just image or just
an image,” to borrow the expression of Fr e n c h
director Jean-Luc Godard. ■
