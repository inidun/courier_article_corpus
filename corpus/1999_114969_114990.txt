n e w s p a p e rs. Chantal is 41 and has “a lot
to get off her chest”.Her story is that of a stri c t
French upbri n gi n g, dropping out of school
and plans thwa rted by her parents. “I wa s
crazy about wild animals and hors e s ,” s h e
s ay s. “I always wanted to train animals. A n d
n ow look at me. . . .”
Chantal had a breakdown in 1996 after
failing an exam to become a nursing assistant.
“I wanted to kill my s e l f,” she say s. “But one
d ay I met an old friend and poured my heart
out to her. She brought me to my senses and
advised me to sell street newspapers.”
Since then, Chantal has been selling
L’ I t i n é ra n t to trave l l e rs on the Pa ri s
underground. She buys her copies for the
e q u i valent of 50 US cents each and re-sells
them for three times that , making betwe e n
$350 and $700 a month.This supplements
the minimum assistance benefit of about
$430 that she gets from the state.

Thousands of marginalized people like
Chantal live from selling street newspapers in
the big cities of rich countri e s. But unlike

Malin Speace,who runs Swe d e n ’s only street
p a p e r , the monthly S i t u ation Sthlm, w h i c h
s t a rted publication in 1995.The paper pri n t s
15,000 copies and employs 120 of the city’s
5,000 or so homeless.
“Selling the paper keeps them occupied
d u ring the day,” s ays Speace. “ We actually
steal their time, to keep their minds off dru g s.”
The paper is also a halfway house betwe e n
“ e x c l u s i o n ” and belonging to society. Two
e x p e rts help the ve n d o rs through the maze of
social serv i c e s , which include projects ru n
by non-gove rnmental organizat i o n s ,s t ate aid
and detox progr a m m e s.
The social usefulness of S i t u ation Sthlm
seems undeniable.At the ve ry least, it helps the
homeless and the unemployed to be less cut
o f f. At best, it helps them to find somewhere
to live , some training or a job.
For the past decade, street newspapers
and magazines have gone from strength to
s t r e n g t h .The first one, Street News, s u r fa c e d
in New York in 1989, recalls Tim Harri s ,
president of the National A s s o c i ation of Nort h
A m e rican Street Newspapers. The paper,
which depended heavily on corp o r at e
d o n at i o n s , was founded by rock musician
Hutchinson Pe rs o n s , and had “ s o m e w h at
right-wing libert a rian politics,” s ays Harri s.
The movement then spread across Nort h
A m e rica and to Europe, and is now gr ow i n g
e ve rywhere except in France, where street
p a p e rs have faded after getting off to a bri s k
s t a rt in 1993.
E l s e w h e r e , there are over 150 in a score of
c o u n t ri e s , mostly focusing on social issues
and funded by a mix of pri vate donat i o n s ,
a d ve rtising reve n u e , income from sales and
public subsidies. Canada has a dozen and
the United States more than 40.The biggest
ones in the US—S t r e e t W i s e ( C h i c a g o ) ,S p a r e
C h a n ge (Boston) and Real Change ( S e at t l e ) —
sell between 20,000 and 120,000 copies a
m o n t h . But most are run on a shoestri n g,
p rint about 20,000 copies each and barely
manage to  break eve n .
Tessa Swithinbank, i n t e rn ational editor
of the British street paper The Big Issue,
counted 70 titles in Europe in 1997, half of
them in Germ a ny. As in North A m e ri c a ,

copies a month to the nearly 300,000 sold

third favo u rite paper of young Bri t o n s

in London in 1991 by a wo r k i n g - c l a s s

The Big Issue was created to be “ a
prosperous publication with considerable
resources that would offer substantial resources
to the less fort u n at e ,” s ays the Montreal street
paper L’ I t i n é ra i r e.M a ny North A m e rican street
p a p e rs are much more cri t i c a l . Most of them
are run and edited by the homeless themselve s
and fight for the existence of this kind of media
voice in a country where it is rare.
They criticize the eye - c at c h i n g
p r e s e n t at i o n , the management style and the
“ c o m m e r c i a l ” content of the British paper and
accuse it of trying to set itself up as the norm .
The arri val of The Big Issue in Los Angeles last
A p ril has fuelled the debat e , especially as it
t h r e atens to kill off the street paper M a k i n g
C h a n ge, based in nearby Santa Monica.
“ We ’re ve ry vulnerable,” s ays Je n n i f e r
Wa g g o n n e r , who runs Making Change. “ We
only have 20 ve n d o rs and our receipts barely
c over printing costs.”But Wa g g o n n e r ,h e rs e l f
a homeless pers o n , has a business sense to
m atch the competition and is negotiat i n g
with the ri val paper for technical help and for
e x c l u s i ve rights to sell the two papers in the
we s t e rn Los Angeles area.
H a rris is careful not to take sides in this
turf war and in ideological disputes. “It all
depends on your pri o ri t i e s ,”he say s.“If they’r e
p o l i t i c a l , you include the poor in the process
of producing the paper and gi ve them a vo i c e .
If you think money’s more import a n t , yo u
t u rn over of more than $20 million, it has
four regional editions in Britain and three
abroad—in A u s t r a l i a , South A f rica and the
United Stat e s.
Speace says street papers are eve n
s t a rting to spread to countries of the South.
N O S was launched in Brasilia at the end of

sell tourists a paper called C o n c e rn. Plans for
street newspapers are afoot in India and
Japan.Wo r l d w i d e , “about 30 million copies
of street newspapers are probably sold eve ry
year and the number is gr owing all the time,”
s ays Mel  Yo u n g,who runs the Scottish edition
of The Big Issue. B u t , he say s , “there is some
d i s a greement within the move m e n t .”
Ethically correct
The main point of discord is over the
p u rpose of street newspapers. Should they be
the mouthpiece of militant community
o r g a n i z ations or should they be profit a b l e
social enterp rises? The Big Issue has chosen the
second option.Bird thinks it is possible to be
both profitable and “ethically corr e c t ” .I n d e e d ,
putting out a quality publicat i o n , p r o d u c e d
entirely by professionals, is essential for social
e f f e c t i ve n e s s ,he say s.The paper highlights the
t wo or three thousand homeless people who
l i ve by selling it and points up the services it
o f f e rs , such as help with finding somewhere
to live and getting training.
