Rasaiah Yoganathan, a 40-year-old Sri Lankan
Tamil,arrived in Marseilles last year without
valid immigr ation papers after fleeing his
c o u n t ry ’s ethnic confli c t . H owe ve r ,Yo g a n at h a n ’s
efforts to explain his tenuous situation to the local
a u t h o rities proved futile, as he could not speak
French.
A month passed and Yo g a n athan decided to
w rite to the Intern ational Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) in Geneva explaining his plight.T h e
ICRC responded to his request and asked him to
provide documentary evidence justifying his case.
Unfortunately, the reply was in French and Yoga-
nathan was unable to understand it.
It was then that he came upon a Tamil radio
broadcast from Pa ris in which there was a phone-in
p r o gramme addressing issues related to obtaining a
s t ay permit or refugee status in France.Yo g a n at h a n



Sri Lankan expats 
find a guardian angel

immediately called to seek their help. He received

Yo g a n at h a n ’s case is not an isolated one. Fo r
more than half a million Sri Lankan Tamils—most of
them refugees—living in we s t e rn Europe, the Pa ri s -
based Tamil Radio and Television (TRT) netwo r k
not only functions as a news source and an enter-
tainment channel but most importantly helps them
to better cope with living abroad. Because the conti-
n e n t ’s mainstream media takes little interest in their
a f fa i rs ,Tamils also say that T RT has gi ven them a
voice and an identity in their adopted countri e s.
Started in January 1997 as a limited company
by journalists and professionals from the Ta m i l
community in Europe, T RT focuses mainly on
news and current affa i rs. There are hourly news
bulletins in Tamil devoted pri m a rily to the Sri Lan-
kan situat i o n ,f o l l owed by current affa i rs in the sub-
continent and other parts of the world.The radio
channel was an instant success among Tamils in
E u r o p e , who until then had no other daily source of
information about their homeland.
Wanting to feel
at home
T RT is more than a traditional news prov i d e r. I n
a weekly programme called “U d h av u vo m a” (“Can we
h e l p ? ” ) , it invites experts to answer queries in Ta m i l
on how to obtain work permits and on other admi-
n i s t r at i ve issues. “They don’t just ask about immi-
gr ation problems; they are often looking for infor-
m ation about mat t e rs ranging from divorce to school
a d m i s s i o n ,”s ays Sagadeva n ,an expert on French legal
a f fa i rs who hosts this weekly progr a m m e .
On the lighter side, the channel also airs inter-
views with Sri Lankan and Indian celebri t i e s , l i t e-
r a ry reviews, s p o rts and popular cultural pro-

Sri Lankan refugees who arrived in western Europe in the early 1980s often found it difficult
to adapt to life in countries they knew little about.

gr a m m e s. L i ve coverage of community cultural
e vents and festivals organized in Europe is at t r a c-
ting a gr owing number of listeners.T RT also made
a rrangements with a local Tamil radio station in
Canada so that its programmes could reach the
100,000-strong Tamil community living there.
“The overwhelming support from our people
encouraged us to start a 24-hour television channel
six months after we launched the radio,” s ays Guha-
n athan Sabapat hy Suppaiah, director-general of the
TRT network.
S t a rted with an investment of $5 million in June
1997,TRT’s television channel today boasts over
7,000 subscri b e rs , mostly Sri Lankan Tamils living
in we s t e rn Europe. Its programmes are beamed
across Europe as well as to South A f ri c a , M a u ri-
tius and the island of Réunion where there is a
sizeable Tamil expatriate population.TRT officials
claim they have an estimated viewing audience of
b e t ween 50,000 and 60,000 people.The channel is
free-to-air in places like Mauritius and Réunion.
An alternative
to Western films
and serials
Unlike radio, T RT television charges its sub-
s c ri b e rs in Europe about $25 per month, mostly to
meet operating costs. At the Pa ris headquart e rs ,
there are about 20 full-time staff members and
some 50 freelancers working round the clock.T RT
has its own correspondents in the Ta m i l - d o m i n at e d
n o rt h e rn and eastern parts of Sri Lanka, in sou-
t h e rn India and in major west European cities,
where there is a substantial population of Sri Lan-
kan Tamils.The television channel also has a pro-
duction unit in India.
W h at prompted such a large-scale ve n t u r e ?
“Our pri m a ry objective is to inform our people
about what is happening at home and to address the
problems of our community now scattered in
various parts of Europe,” says Guhanathan.
S ri Lankan Tamil refugees started arriving in
Europe in the early 1980s after fleeing the ethnic
conflict in their country. Britain, France and Ger-
many took in most of them.Making a livelihood in
the host country was their prime concern .T h e n
came wrangling with officials for visas and wo r k
p e rmits for family members. Without any know-
ledge of the area or the country in which they were
living, they often found it hard to become accusto-
med to conditions there. Their first community
n e w s p a p e r , E e l a n a d u, was published in 1991 in
Paris and carried news reports about Sri Lanka as
well as local community events.
To attract the younger generation,TRT intro-
duced popular feature fil m s , classical music and
soap operas produced by Indian television chan-
nels as well as Tamil pop and rap music. V i e we rs
can ask to hear their favo u rite songs or pose a ques-
tion to an actor or actress during phone-in pro-
gr a m m e s. T RT also regularly broadcasts pro-
grammes produced by the Madras-based Sun TV
c h a n n e l . “Previously we used to ask our parents
about our music and dance traditions. N ow we
often watch them on T RT,” s ays A m i rt h ava rs h i n i , a
university student living in Paris.
The channel also provides the younger gene-
r ation with an incentive to learn Ta m i l . “Until T RT
came along, my cousins, who were born here, we r e
not interested in listening to Tamil songs and
m ov i e s. N ow they are regular T RT viewe rs. As a
r e s u l t , they have also picked up the language,” s ay s
5 5 - year-old Fe rnando T h o b i a s , who works at the
Hotel Méridien in Pa ri s.Among other things,T RT
o f f e rs an altern at i ve to We s t e rn films and seri a l s ,
which Tamils sometimes find offensive . “They we r e

ture which T RT now prov i d e s ,” s ays Siva b a l a n ,
who has been living in Pa ris for the last 15 ye a rs
and often takes part in the channel’s literary pro-
gr a m m e . In addition,T RT ’s phone-in progr a m m e s
help displaced Sri Lankan Tamils to get back in
touch with their friends and relat i ves living in dif-
ferent countri e s.
Community 
support
Some might wonder why it took so long for the
Tamils to start up their own radio and television
channel.“We came here as refugees. At that time,
survival was our first priority,” says TRT’s Guha-
nathan.“It’s only recently that some of our people
h ave started to branch out into different areas,
which has given us a greater sense of confidence.”
TRT mainly depends on Indian satellite channels
for its film-based programmes and most of those
n e t works were started after 1992. It was perfect
t i m i n g, since by then the Tamils were in a posi-
tion—both technically and financially—to start up
and operate their network.
But T RT is not without its problems. C o m-
mercials are not generating sufficient revenue to
run the netwo r k , which costs about $800,000 a
ye a r. But T RT officials stress that their aim is not to
make a profit but pri m a rily to serve the commu-
n i t y. They are confident that once the subscri b e r

base enlarges,they will be able to generate enough
revenue to run the network.
Although T RT officials maintain that their net-
work provides only news and cultural progr a m m e s ,
c ritics assert that some of the content support s
Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka.
During the conflict that raged late last year in
the Wanni region of nort h e rn Sri Lanka, T RT
appealed to its viewe rs to help the thousands of dis-
placed Tamil refugees.There was an ove r w h e l m i n g
response from the channel’s audience in Europe as
well as in Canada: d o n ations added up to about
$400,000 and were sent to the displaced populat i o n
in Sri Lanka.
With overwhelming support from the commu-
n i t y,T RT now has ambitious plans to build “ b r o a d-
casting bridges that reach out to Tamils around the
wo r l d .”As Thulasi Mageswa r a n , a 14-year-old stu-
dent from London, puts it,“I feel proud to tell my
n o n - Tamil friends that this channel exists and espe-
cially that it is run by Tamils.” ■
