DROUGHT
KNOWS

FRONTIERS
by Gordon Ash
H URRICANES, volcanic
eruptions, earthquakes
and floods are natural disasters which
make a dramatic impact on the public's
mind; they are tragic events which
immediately make headline news. But
what of drought? An examination of
the position in India and Africa today
provides a very direct answer. When
the rains fail, this does not hit the
headlines; but the consequences of
drought are certainly disastrous and
hundreds of thousands of people are
faced with the threat of famine.
In a developed country, when a
spell of drought is experienced, the
natural resources have been exploited
to such a degree that the economy
suffers little damage. However, in
a developing area where water may
well be one of the most valuable natu-

ral resources but remains unexploited,
suffering on a large scale is inevitable.
India has concentrated on harnes¬
sing water power and her many river
projects have provided irrigation for
vast acreages. With further improve¬
ments in agricultural methods, particu¬
larly in making extensive use of ferti¬
lizers to increase yields, she can
step up production in an endeavour to
defeat the problems created by popu¬
lation growth.
The reverse applies in areas of Afri¬
ca where perennial drought conditions
have been experienced. For example,
Basutoland has great water resources
and in Bechuanaland there are areas
where water courses could be exploit¬
ed. This is also true of Matabeleland
(Rhodesia), parts of Kenya and other
African countries. Surely now is the
time for an urgent examination of the
position and, no doubt, large-scale
hydrological surveys should be insti¬
tuted without delay and development
should be actively pursued so that
there will be an absolute guarantee
that when the next bad drought cycle
hits Africa, India or any other areas,
possibly at present producing man's
greatest hazard, they should be so
equipped as to take such an eventu¬
ality in their stride.
AN will find it hard to fight
against "established" des¬
erts although this is a subject worthy
of constant examination but it is
surely admitting failure in the twentieth
century if we are prepared to sit back
and permit desert encroachment on
any scale.
During an extensive tour which I
made of the drought-stricken areas of
southern, central and eastern Africa
last year, the huge dust spirals rising
from the parched land provided a cons¬
tant reminder that the long spell of
drought in some parts over five or
more years had not only caused
human suffering and cattle losses on
a large scale, but had wrought heavy
damage to the land, increasing the
dangers of extensive erosion. In the
forests, a soft wood tree would
collapse at the touch of a mere
finger-tip; the loss of vegetation in
the water courses is equally serious.
One agricultural expert in Bechu¬
analand, referring to an area in the
northwest of the country, was not wide
of the mark in suggesting we would find
areas of petrified forest.

a survey on behalf of the Oxford

Committee for Famine Relief, generally
known as OXFAM (1), provided many
shocks: the extreme cases of malnu¬
trition and the obvious signs of the
protein deficiency diseases like kwas¬
hiorkor and pellagra. In Bechuanaland,
100,000 persons a fifth of the popula¬
tion were destitute; crops had failed
and staggering cattle losses were being
experienced. It is estimated that herds
previously totalling 1.3 million head
will be reduced to something like half
a million by the time the next rains
are due in September.
Although heavy rains have recently
been experienced, they came too late
In most areas to counter the crippling
effects of the long drought. It is esti¬
mated that by next July, 360,000 will

be destitute in this country (the total
population is 540,000) and famine relief
feeding will have to continue to some
degree until June 1967.
ATTLE are so desperate
for fodder that when the
rains arrive and green shoots appear,
many die from scour through consum¬
ing sand whilst attempting to graze.
Althrough the British Government has
provided funds to keep some breeding
stock and trek oxen alive, this is a
blow from which Bechuanaland (which
will become independent as Botswana
in September) will take years to
recover.
Conditions in the mountain areas of
Basutoland were fairly desperate and,
added to drought, the people were
facing a severe winter with sub-zero
temperatures. Since my visit, relief
supplies have been reaching these
remote mountain fastnesses.
Recently, heavy rain has filled the
dams and flooded roads but this has
not saved the bulk of the maize and
sorghum on which the people depend
for their staple food. So the Ministry
of Agriculture has launched a crash
programme to persuade farmers to
plant winter wheat and peas for food,
and barley, rye or oats for fodder.
Though there has also been heavy
rain in some areas of Rhodesia, the
worst affected region, Matabeleland,
will need several good rainy seasons
to give it a chance to recover from
five years with drought conditions.
The number of people dependent
on famine relief as a result of the
effects of last year's drought in Kenya
has fluctuated between 313,000 last
November and 230,000 in January. The
present forecast is that there will still
be 163,000 people needing famine relief
between April and September this year.

so that the "short rains" maize crop
is not up to standard. The main maize
crop which depends on the "long
rains" beginning in March, will not be
harvested until July onwards.
Meanwhile Kenya, as In the case of
Basutoland and Bechuanaland, will be
relying on food supplies provided un¬
der the United Nations World Food
Programme. Last year, the planning
involved in mounting this exercise, due
to communications and transportation
difficulties, was tremendous. I had the
pleasure of meeting one U.N. official
in Gaberones, capital of Bechuanaland,
who was faced with the problem of
arranging for shipments to be un¬
loaded in South African ports to be
railed up to points in Bechuanaland.
Needless to say, he found the answer.
Last year OXFAM spent some
£97,000 in the drought areas of Africa
and its grants included contributions to
feeding schemes, to the costs of dis¬
tributing supplies, boreholes, earth
stock dams and help with the provision
of seeds for Bechuanaland and Kenya.
The United Nations, individual govern¬
ments and the missions and voluntary
agencies all made every endeavour to
alleviate human suffering.
I was greatly moved by the fund-
raising efforts being made in each
country. Despite their serious cir
cumstances, considerable sums were
raised and devoted to relief program¬
mes. Africans and Europeans were
sitting down together to plan emerg¬
ency measures. Surely, co-operation
will continue to pay handsome divi¬
dends if the attack is maintained ruth¬
lessly. Famine relief has been pro¬
vided and will be necessary for some
time to come but famine prevention
measures must be stepped-up in the
fight against the world's most cruel
enemy: hunger.
O XFAM likes to act quickly
in providing relief following
man-made and natural disasters, but at
the same time the main part of its
programme is devoted to schemes
designed to help people to help them¬
selves in achieving better living stand¬
ards.
An agricultural demonstration farm in
the mountains of Basutoland, financed
by the organization is a certain pointer
to a better way of life for a remote
people. Outside the capital, Maseru,
it has helped the Department of Agri¬
culture to conduct experiments with
fishponds so that this activity can
safety be multiplied to provide a valu¬
able source of vital protein. Assistance
has also been given to agricultural

training schemes in the lowlands to
equip the local farmers to improve
their production.
Swaziland has a much better chance
-of achieving a viable economy but in
this country, too, assistance is being
provided for agricultural schemes and
I was much impressed by the success
of the small unit African farms.
Projects being supported in Bechu¬
analand are proving that the country
can be better equipped to fight against
future drought cycles. There is a need
to exploit water resources, improve
farming methods, control grazing, con¬
quer the tstetse fly, undertake re¬
afforestation and so on. At an agri¬
cultural training centre in Mahalapye, I
saw one practical attempt to train
Africans to teach better methods of
farming and animal husbandry.
Since 1962, OXFAM has spent over
£500,000 in these three countries alone
In helping them to eradicate the root
causes of poverty, disease and igno¬
rance.
However, a year In which OXFAM
was concentrating on providing emerg¬
ency aid for Africa ended with its
attention moving to another area facing
the threat of famine: India. In Decem¬
ber, as part of a crash programme to
increase food production in Mysore
State, it approved a project involving
the shipment of 5,300 tons of fertilizer
costing £105,000. This will enable far¬
mers to plant 10,000 acres of land irri¬
gated by the Tungabhadra Dam with
a quick maturing hybrid maize which
will produce an output four times
greater than the normal yield. About
30,000 tons of grain, which will provide
food for 600,000 people for six months
on a famine ration of 8 ounces per head
per day, will be produced together
with 100,000 tons of needed fodder.
This scheme will be conducted in co¬
operation with the University of Agri¬
cultural Sciences at Bangalore. Apart
from providing an additional supply
of food and fodder, it will help the
farmers concerned to demonstrate the
value of fertilizers. The farmers will
buy the fertilizer and the repayments
in rupees will be used to provide any
assistance that may be required else¬
where in India. The first shipments of
fertilizer have already arrived in
Mysore State.
As a voluntary agency, OXFAM can
only provide aid which is small when
weighed against the world's total
needs. But as the Mysore State pro¬
ject shows, it has great significance
and is complementary to the large-
scale assistance which governments,
through the United Nations or indivi¬
dually, can provide.
