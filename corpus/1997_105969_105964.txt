H E R I T A G E
THE ISLAND OF OZAM BIQUE
by Patrick Lagès
Arab, Indian and Portuguese architectural influences are blended in the port
of Mozambique. Once a trading post on the sea route from Europe to the East
Indies, this island harbour was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List
in 1991.
The church of Our Lady of Mercy (17th century) is
the only one still used for worship on the island.
The little island of Mozam¬
bique, which lies four kilo¬
metres off the coast of Africa just
opposite Madagascar, was for hun¬
dreds of years a major centre of
intercontinental maritime trade. It
was occupied hy Aral) mendiants
from the tenth century until the
end of the fifteenth, and in the six¬
teenth century became a port of
call on the route from Europe to
the East Indies opened by the Por¬
tuguese navigator Vasco da Cama.
In 1507, the Portuguese built a
fortress on the island where the
Customs House stands today. A
later fortification that lias survived
is the fort of St. Sebastian, which
was built between lüöü and 1620
and is inspired by Italian Henais-
sanee military architecture.
Mozambique harbour grew
rapidly during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. 1 ts business
houses stood on the sea front, along
a rocky licit where boats with a
shallow draught could land at high
tide. ()\cr the years a town of twist¬
ing streets lined with flat-roofed
houses took shape around a cen¬
tral square.
The town as it appears today has
a strongan hitcctural homogeneity

the centuries of the same building
materials, mainly limestone from
quarries in the south of the island,
and wood for beams and framework.
The decorativ e style of the façades,
with their cornices, high rectangu¬
lar framed windows and rows of
pilasters, is equally homogeneous.
The fiat roofs, designed to collect
rainwater and compensate for the
island's lack of freshwater springs,
and a rectangular ground plan in
which space is divided into six
square rooms also uphold a general
impression of unity which encom¬
passes the smallest houses roofed
with palm leaves the macuti that
constitute around a quarter of the
city as well as the most luxurious
residences. The preponderant
architectural influence is that of
southern Portugal, although there
are undeniable Arab and Indian ele¬
ments.
THE COLONIAL TOWN
Alter crossing the three-kilomctre-
long bridge that links the island to
the mainland, the \ isitor comes to a
cemetery surrounded by white
walls. There is a white chapel, and
a child's white tomb in the form of
a sailing ship stands out among the
other funerary monuments, nolablv

the Muslim tombs, which are more
unobtrusive. Some distance away, a
nineteenth-century Hindu temple,
and crematorium illustrate the
island's cultural pluralism.
Arab and later Portuguese,
Mozambique island was visited by
such exceptional men as the trav¬
eller Fernao Mcndes Pinto, who
stopped off there in 1 5 ,'i 7 , and the
poet Luis de Camöes, who lived
there between 1567 and 1570
while completing his epic, The
Lusiads, a hymn to the great Por¬
tuguese explorers of his time. His
statue stands in a small square by
the sea. Hut Mozambique's colo¬
nial splendour, victim of the vicis¬
situdes of time and history, is today
no more than a memory. The aboli¬
tion of slavery, which gradually
brought a lucrative trade, to an end,
then the opening of the Suez Canal,
which moved the East India route,
northwards, inevitably condemned
the town to decline.
Apart from the ancient fortifi¬
cations, only half of the town is
stone-built. The visitor's eye is
immediately drawn to the hospital,

In the old town.

H The perfectly preserved St.
Paul's palace, with its walls of red
ochre with while edging, has claims
to be the island's most beautiful
monument. A Jesuit school founded
in 1610, it was destroyed by fire
sixty years later and rebuilt in
1674. From 1763 until 1935 it was
used as the residence of the island's
governors. It was converted into a
museum in 1969 and today houses
a fine collection of European and
Indian furniture of different peri¬
ods so that it looks for all the world
like a roy al dwelling. It is connected
to the sea front hy a small square
with Art Nouveau street-lamps
where two-coloured paving stones
evoke the undulations of the ocean
swell.
A MICROCOSM OF HUMANITY
On the sea front, the colonial town
slowly gives way to fishermen's
houses. On the shore the people
from the poorer neighbourhoods
go about their business. Women
and girls queue beside a fountain
for a little fresh water. Children
run around and always end their
games hy diving into the sea shout¬
ing with joy. Mozambique's popu¬
lation has increased by over 50 per
cent since 1968, largely because
of the war and the refugees dis¬
placed by it. The town market is
one of the island's liveliest spots.
A rigorously symmetrical quadri¬
lateral, with small towers rising at
each corner, it was built in 1887.
Its wares are mainly fruit and small
fish set out on trestle tables. Under
the shady porches of houses a cen¬
tury old, street vendors sell indi¬
vidual cigarettes, biscuits, sweets
and fizzy drinks to passers-by.
At the other end of the island,
between two beaches of white
sand, the fort of St. Sebastian now
only defies imaginary fleets. Its high
dark walls, built on the coral of the
island, plunge sheer into the sea.
The wind is the only guest in this
desolate spot, sweeping the white
terraces, groaning in the gigantic
reservoirs of rainwater dug in the
basement and whistling through
a majestic neo-classical building
constructed in 1877 and recently
repainted white, with a garden dec¬
orated with ponds and fountains.
For many years it was the biggest
hospital south of the Sahara.
VANISHED SPLENDOUR
Behind the half-open doors of pros¬
perous town houses can be seen
neglected but once well-tended gar¬
dens. In a Mediterranean-style café
with chequerboard iloor tiles,
superannuated fans churn the air in
a vast room where a handful of cus¬
tomers sit around tables with inlaid
chessboards. The menu, painted
on the wall by a local artist, never
varies: fish, mixed grill, salad.
Opposite, the church of Our Lady
of Mercy offers its immaculate
façade to the sun. Built in 1635 on
the ruins of an earlier church
destroyed by a Dutch bombard¬
ment in 1607, it is one of the oldest
buildings on the island. It houses
a small museum of sacred art, and
during the services the singing of
the faithful is punctuated by the
insistent beating of tom-toms.

the old church. Birds nest in the
muzzles of cannon which still point
to the horizon. At the sheerest
point, on a bastion of the fortress,
is the chapel of Our Lady of the
Ramparts. Built in 1522, it is
thought to be the oldest European
building south of the equator. Be
that as it may, it is certainly the
oldest in Mozambique and is
thought to he the only building
outside Portugal built in the early
sixteenth-century Manueline style.
In the musty interior, the pre¬
vailing obscurity is barely dissi¬
pated hy dim rays of light that pen¬
etrate through cross-shaped
openings in the walls and east a grey
light on tombs that have been
sealed to the floor and contain the
remains of travellers and con¬
querors who died of fever and
wounds. The muffled sound of
waves beating on distant rocks can
be heard, as if the sea were trying
to efface all trace of human life.
In vain. These bodies mingled with
the land of Africa are forever part
of the history and life of the island
of Mozambique. I
