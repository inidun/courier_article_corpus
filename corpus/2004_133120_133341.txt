This 
groundbreaking 
work was the 
first aiming to present 
the entire history of the 
African continent, cradle of 
humanity. The collection 
sheds light on the pre-
colonial era and interweaves 
Africa’s destiny with the rest 
of humanity’s, examining 
its interaction with other 
continents and the role of 
Africans in the dialogue 
between civilizations.
“General History of Africa” 
opens with the beginning of 
the human race, and follows 
its evolution, with early forms 
of agriculture and artistic 
expression soon appearing 
(Volume I). In the northern 
civilizations, Egyptian and 
Ethiopian, as well as those 
to the South, particularly the 
Indian Ocean islands, ancient 
Africa reveals its riches 
and its construction, from 
Neolithic times to the seventh 
century of the Christian era 
(Volume II). Around the first 
millennium, the continent 
is marked primarily by the 
birth and dissemination 
of Islam in the north and 
Bantu expansion in the south 
(Volume III). From the 12th 
to the 16th century, Africa 
experiences the spread of 
Islam, increasing international 
exchanges particularly with 
Europe, and the founding of 
great empires and regional 
kingdoms, notably Mali, 
Songhay and Almohades 
(Volume IV). Between the 
16th and the 18th century, 
African kingdoms decline 
and disappear, traditional 
societies are transformed, and 
Europeans establish the slave 
trade (Volume V). Then, 
until around 1880, exchanges 
with the rest of the world 
intensify, the slave trade is 
abolished, and new states

People writing their 
own history
 UNESCO began early on to publish histories of the world’s main regions. Instead of just tracing the 
past of nations, these collections aim to provide a greater understanding of civilizations. 
Through this broad perspective, readers gain a global understanding of the evolution of societies, flourishing of cultures, 
major currents of exchange and interaction with other parts of the world.
These collections also aim to provide a culturally relevant perspective. They provide the point of view of the populations 
concerned, whose past has often been distorted, discredited or treated as peripheral to the history of the colonizers 
and the dominant nations – those who usually write history. The idea here is to rediscover a people’s consciousness 
and the vision it develops of its own destiny. This shift in perspective is reflected by the significant number of 
local historians, with impeccable academic credentials, who contributed to these collections as editors and authors.

and organizations emerge 
in the midst of an economic 
transformation (Volume 
VI). At the end of the 19th 
Century, the continent is 
profoundly changed by 
European colonization 
which gives rise to African 
nationalism and the 
anticolonial movements that 
follow (Volume VII). Finally, 
at the end of World War II, 
contemporary Africa emerges 
from a difficult decolonization 
process, the apprenticeship 
of independence, and a new 
economic and political life 
(Volume VIII).

General History of Latin America
S
ome 240 historians 
and experts 
contributed to this 
exceptionally far-
reaching work. Five out 
of nine volumes have 
been published so far 
in Spanish (UNESCO 
Publishing/Trotta).
Volume I analyzes Latin 
America’s primitive 
populations and their 
social structures. 
Then, after Columbus 
and throughout the 
following century, 
colonization shatters 
local societies, setting off 
waves of epidemics and 
evangelization, while 
forcibly introducing a 
slave population from 
Africa (Volume II). From 
1550 to 1770, mores, 
culture and art evolve 
within a consolidated 
colonial society (Volume 
III). In the 18th century, 
the colonial policies of 
Spain and Portugal lead 
to their own collapse 
(Volume IV). In the 19th 
century, struggles for 
independence break out 
across the sub-continent 
(Volume V). 
A volume concerning the 
rise of Latin-American 
nations is now underway 
and will be followed by 
a detailed examination of 
national projects between 
1870 and 1930. A final 
tome explaining the 
work’s methodology will 
complete the collection.

General History of the Caribbean
S
ix volumes will cover the 
history of the islands of 
the Caribbean islands, east of 
the Central American coast. 
The islands are home to 
diverse populations – 
indigenous (Amerindians), 
Europeans (Spanish, British, 
French, Dutch) and Africans 
(victims of the slave trade) – 
who clash, cohabit, mingle 
and influence each other.
Four volumes have already 
been published in English 
(UNESCO Publishing/
Macmillan). The history of 
indigenous societies (until 
the arrival of the Spanish) 
goes back almost 10,000 
years, according to the latest 
archaeological findings 
(Volume I). The European 
colonial conquest throughout 
the 16th century installs a new 
society and gives rise to Creole 
culture (Volume II). A more 
detailed examination of the 
impact of slavery is provided 
in the third volume, followed 
by another presenting the 
methodology used to compile 
the collection. 
Titles to come will examine 
the 19th century with the 
abolition of slavery and 
the emergence of national 
movements (Volume IV), and 
the 20th century characterized 
by decolonization but also 
continued dependence on the 
West (Volume V).

T
he “History of 
Civilizations of Central 
Asia” presents in six 
volumes the rich past and 
cultural heritage of the crossroads 
of civilizations that incorporates 
Afghanistan, northeast Iran, 
northern India, western China, 
Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan.
Volume I, covers the period 
from the Paleolithic era to circa 
700 BC, and describes the first 
societies based upon agriculture, 
the early signs of urbanization and 
the history of nomadic peoples. 
From 700 BC to the middle of the 
3rd century of the Christian Era, 
nomadic and sedentary civilizations 
coexisted in the steppes and oases. 
Various competing or succeeding 
empires and kingdoms (Persian, 
Macedonian, Greek, Scythian, 
Parthian and Kushan) emerge in 
the region, a religious syncretism 
appears blending Zoroastrism, 
Greek cults and Buddhism, and 
trade flourishes along the Silk 
Roads (Volume II). From the 3rd 
to the 8th century, Central Asia is 
a prosperous melting-pot, where 
followers of Buddha, Zoroaster, 
Mani, Jesus Christ and the shamans 
coexist, as do the Muslims 
arriving after the Arab conquests 
(Volume III). The following 
seven centuries, are marked by 
the spread of Islam. The first 
part of Volume IV examines the 
roles of the Turks, the Kitans 
from southern Manchuria and 
the Mongols (Genghis Khan) in 
Central Asian history; the second 
focuses on religions, cultures 
and artistic expressions of this 
time. The period from 1500-1850 
(Volume V) marks the decline of 
the last medieval empires and the 
beginning of colonial domination. 
It also marked the decline of 
nomadism, and, in the religious 
sphere, the Shiite triumph in 
Iran, the conversion of Mongols 
to Buddhism, and the growth of 
the Sikh religion in northwestern 
India. The upcoming sixth 
volume will cover 1850 until 
today, as the region enters the 
modern era.

The Different Aspects
of Islamic Culture
In this collection, 
Volume II, “The 
Individual and Society in 
Islam”, has been published in 
French, Arabic and English. It 
focuses on the fiqh, or what 
is lawful or unlawful 
according to the Koran. This 
jurisprudence forms the basis 
of Islamic legal decisions, 
collective attitudes and 
individual behaviour. With a 
lively style, the authors 
analyze the creation of norms 
and values in Islam, without 
sidestepping the differences 
in interpretation and leaving 
room for colourful details. 
They give particular attention 
to contemporary issues such 
as the emancipation of 
women, contraception, 
human rights and the status 
of minorities, as well as the 
Islamic approach to 
economics, government, 
justice and ethics. 
Two other volumes have been 
published in English. Besides 
mathematics, astronomy 
and physics, “Science and 
Technology in Islam” (IV) 
covers technology and 
medicine, as well as advances 
made by Muslim scientists 
in cosmology, geology, 
mineralogy, zoology and 
botany. “Culture and Learning 
in Islam” (V) examines art, 
the human sciences, science, 
philosophy, mysticism, 
language and literature.

History of Humanity
W
ritten by the most 
distinguished scholars, 
“History of Humanity” recounts 
humankind’s extraordinary 
voyage through time, from its 
first faltering steps three million 
years ago. Every known culture is 
represented in this monumental 
overview.
The first volume covers 
prehistory, a period of millions 
of years that represents 99.8% 
of humanity’s past, from the 
emergence of the earliest “homo” 
beings to the invention of writing 
and the birth of the first states 
about five thousand years ago. 
The collection is divided into two 
major parts, corresponding to 
the periods before and after the 
start of food production. While 
some chapters present a global 
vision, others focus on specific 
periods in different regions. 
The development of prehistoric 
science and its methods are also 
examined.
The second volume (from 3000 
to 700 BC) focuses on the rise 
of the first states, science, the 
great religions, architecture, 
urbanization and cultural 

exchange. The appearance of 
writing, an essential aspect 
of civilizations, allows us to 
understand the philosophical 
ideas, the poetic dreams and 
myths of ancient humans. The 
first of the volume’s three parts 
is thematic and covers such 
issues as the birth of scientific 
thought, the measure of time, 
metallurgy, the making of the 
great empires, the development 
of long-distance commerce, 
the first writings and linguistic 
families, religion, architecture 
and different art forms. The 
second part is devoted to regions 
for which written sources are 
available, and the third to those 
for which only archaeological and 
anthropological evidence exists. 
Each continent is portrayed with 
its wealth of extraordinarily 
diverse components.
The history of humanity then 
takes on speed, an acceleration 
reflected in the tighter 
organization of the next five 
volumes, the first four of which 
have been published in English.
