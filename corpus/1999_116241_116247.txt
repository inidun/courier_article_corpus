G u a t e m a l a :motivation 
and multispeed learning

n At firs t , some parents didn’t like the new
system at the “Queen of Holland” s c h o o l ,
138 km north of Guatemala City, b e c a u s e
their children didn’t bring homework back
with them.They thought their offspring must
be learning less. But their doubts soon
disappeared when they saw the progress their
sons and daughters were making. N ow they
u n d e rstand that the “ h o m e wo r k ” has to do
with the ongoing life of the community.
Ipólito A l va r e z , who is 11, helps his
craftsman fat h e r , but he is still learning eve n
though his hands may be caked with mud,
“ my homework is to ask my parents about
the village and its history,” he say s.
The school, in the village of Santa
Marta,near San Jerónimo, in the province
of Baja Verapaz, is one of the 2,084 rural
schools which are part of the N u e va Escuela
U n i t a ria (New Unitary School) project.
The programme, run by the Guatemalan
e d u c ation ministry and based on the
Colombian model, began in 1991 and now
i nvo l ves 3,500 teachers and about 113,000
children.
T h i rt y - f o u r - year-old Oscar Guerrero has
taught for 12 ye a rs in unitary schools, six of
them under the new system. “ B e f o r e , t h e
children were passive , timid and didn’t
p a rt i c i p ate much,” he say s.“ I ’d gi ve my daily
lesson in front of the class and they just
l i s t e n e d .When I asked them if they had any
q u e s t i o n s , no one raised their hands although
I knew they hadn’t unders t o o d .”
N ow things are quite different.The same
children will pipe up with a question. Fo r
e x a m p l e , after following the instructions in
their guide and observing a plant, I p ó l i t o
will come and ask about photosynthesis.
M e a n w h i l e , the other children are
discussing among themselves what they
have seen.
The shelves in the library carry about 15
b o o k s , with three copies of each.The pages
are all dog-eared from being constantly used
by the children year after ye a r. As in
C o l o m b i a , the school’s 32 pupils have
organized their own student gove rn m e n t ,
which is chosen using the same system as the
one used in national elections, with vo t e r
r e gi s t r at i o n , electoral cards and a campaign.
The school has two classrooms, e a c h
measuring six metres by eight and divided
into sections according to subject and age-
gr o u p. On one wall is a map of the
community drawn by the children on the
back of an adve rtising poster.To save paper,
before they start using notebooks,the first
and second grade pupils learn how to draw
shapes and marks in the sand.
The children are allowed to learn at their
own speed, so their education does not clash
with the harvest season when they have to go
with their parents to the coast. If the school
year ends and they have n ’t reached the
required leve l , the teacher just marks their
school report with the words “in process of
l e a rn i n g ” . n
