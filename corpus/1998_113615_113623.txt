‘A tendency towa r d s
t y ranny and mutual
oppression is an innate
part of human nature.’
Ibn Khaldoun,
1332-1406, North Africa
Bosnia,1995: refugees from
Srebrenica arriving in Tuzla. Be t ween the Leninakan earthquake in
December 1988 and the Gulf War in 1991,
the world seemed to have undergone a
fundamental change. A global society was said to
be emerging with a “new intern at i o n a l
h u m a n i t a rian order”.The United Nations General
Assembly adopted its earliest resolutions on
h u m a n i t a rian assistance just a few days before
the first intervention of this kind on Soviet soil after
the deadly tremor in A rm e n i a .The following ye a r
opened a new era, with the fall of the Berlin wa l l ,
the rising number of pro-democracy move m e n t s
in A f rica and Security Council resolutions
imposing the help of humanitarian organizat i o n s
to save the Kurds of Iraq.The end of the Cold Wa r
was supposed to usher in an epoch of peace and
d e m o c r a cy made possible and strengthened by
the inform ation revo l u t i o n .
The possibility of “ s e e i n g ” world events unfold
l i ve on television fulfilled the dream of both post-
war peri o d s. As in 1918 and in 1945, the cry
“ n e ver again” rang out in the 1990s. But it did
happen again. E ven as intern ational organizat i o n s
were celebrating the advent of a world re-united,
fascistic militias began dismembering Yu g o s l av i a
along ethnic lines while a racist gove rnment in
R wanda unleashed death squads, setting off a
frenzy of genocidal killing. Then there were the
deadly implosion of Somali society, civil strife in
p o s t - S oviet Afghanistan and the war that has
r avaged southern Sudan for 15 ye a rs , to mention
just a few of the most deva s t ating conflicts.
Could the new world order prevent these crimes
from reoccurri n g — c rimes against humanity which
the intern ational community had long thought
banished at Nuremberg after the Second World Wa r ?



Televised genocide 
Fifty years after the Second World War, the
international community is watching crimes
against humanity in Rwanda and Yugoslavia
Certainly not, unless we assume that they were just
consequences of the East-West conflict or the results
of obscure misunders t a n d i n g s. These assumptions
ignore the central importance of local political fa c t o rs.
And yet this is precisely the illusion maintained by a
We s t e rn conception of the world which is constantly
presented as universal.
This same denial of politics continued,although
in different form s , in the crises of Bosnia and Rwa n d a .
These conflicts were not a local stage for a global
p ower stru g g l e .They were about battling tribes dri ve n
by obscure ethnic impulses that seemed to date from
another age. They were no longer represented as
geopolitical conflicts in which peoples were held
hostage in a ri va l ry that had nothing to do with them.
I n s t e a d , they were presented by images of chaos and
f u r o r , in which tribes in the grip of pri m i t i ve passions
slaughter each other for enigmatic gains.
However,this perspective forgets that the world
wars started as fires ignited and stoked by Europe to
the point of suicide. Other people’s wars,like those
r a ging today, are always considered insane. It also
forgets that technology, including communicat i o n
technology, is morally neutral.In other words,it can
be used for high-minded as well as evil purp o s e s.
Lastly, it also disregards the fact that while Western
c o u n t ri e s , and more broadly the intern ational powe rs ,
cannot be held accountable for all the horrors of the
world,they bear part of the responsibility—one that
this metaphysical and moralizing vision conve n i e n t l y
avoids.
We live in virtual and widespread proximity due
to technological progress that has supposedly
t u rned the world into a “global village”. E ve ryo n e
is eve ryone else’s neighbour. But the possibility of
l e a rning about our contemporari e s ’ m i s f o rt u n e s
as they happen seems to be more overwhelming than
s t i m u l at i n g, probably because it insidiously
u n d e rmines our capacity for indignat i o n . Pe r h a p s
most import a n t l y, it underscores our we a k n e s s
all the more cru e l l y.We are simultaneously “ gi a n t s ”
in terms of inform ation and “ d wa r f s ” in terms of
a c t i o n .
The utopian dream of a world made transparent
by technology as well as the pseudo-realism
underlining the political actions and reasons of
s t ates represent two symmetrical ways of deny i n g
p o l i t i c s. We need to move beyond these two tactics
used to retreat from the wo r l d . E ve ry day, we must
r e - i nvent politics in constructing a common wo r l d
and a forum for deliberat i o n .This is by no means a
recipe for overcoming destru c t i ve impulses, but the
only way we can predict and prepare for them. I t
m ay also be called responsibility. n
