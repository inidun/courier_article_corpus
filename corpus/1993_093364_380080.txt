After heavy
felling, a few
beleaguered
trees are left in
this badly eroded
area around
Kenya's Lake
Nakuru.
'ELLINGTON Ojuok, a sixty-
five-year-old farmer at
Maseno in the Kenya high¬
lands nodded at his unu¬
sual crops: long rows of
young green corn plants
alternating with rows of short,
bushy trees.
"This corn is doing better than
the corn without the trees, " he said.
"But it's a lot of work to cut the
branches. I want to see more results
before I plant trees in my other
fields." He gestured at the corn
growing on six hectares below his
compound of houses.
Within sight of Lake Victoria and
a stone's throw from the equator,
Ojuok and fifty-one other farmers in
his region began an agroforestry
project eighteen months ago to
improve their soils. They planted
rows of leguminous trees between
rows of corn. A special feature of
these trees is their capacity to "fix"
atmospheric nitrogen in the soil,
making this important nutrient
available to other plants.
Two or three times a year, the farm¬
ers cut the trees' leafy branches
and place them on the soil around
the com as "green manure" fertilizer.
The leaves release nitrogen to the
crop as well as other nutrients that the
trees capture deep in the soil. The
leaves also provide a high-protein
feed for livestock and the branches
make good fuel for cooking.
The experiments on Ojuok's farm,
and on dozens ofothers throughout
Africa, are part of an international
effort to discover and implement
agroforestry technologies combin¬
ing trees 

with crops and livestock

to Stop agricultural and environ¬
mental degradation.
Farmers in Kenya, as well as in
many other countries, face the
problem of depleted soils and
decreasing harvests. (Each year
more than 25 million tons of topsoil
disappear from the world's culti¬
vated fields.) In the past, Ojuok and
other farmers in western Kenya
used to have little problem with soil
fertility, because they had enough
land to fallow so the soil could rep¬
lenish itself and to raise cows that
provided manure to fertilize the
crops. But as the population
increased, farm sizes decreased.
"Now there's no land to fallow
and not enough to raise cows for
manure," said Eva Ohlsson, an agro¬
nomist with the Agroforestry
Research Station at Maseno, where
scientists from the International
Council for Research in Agroforestry
(ICRAF) work with colleagues from
the Kenya Agricultural and Forestry
Research Institutes.
Agroforestry emerged as an inte¬
gral part of modern agricultural
development in the 1970s when it
became clear that the Green
Revolution would not help many of
the world's poor farmers. Those
who could not afford pesticides, fer¬
tilizers and irrigation were still
doomed to eke out less and less
from their land. Agroforestry pro¬
mised to provide a sustainable
approach in which small farmers
could grow food, wood fuel and
building materials for themselves
and fodder for their animals.
After ICRAF was founded in 1973
in Nairobi, scientists travelled
through Africa, India, southeast Asia

Well-tended ^nd Latin America to find out what
farmland in the the farmers' problems were and the
Kisli highlands of solutions they had found that could
northwest be shared with farmers in other
Kenya. parts of the world. At the Maseno
field station promising trees from all
over the world were tested to deter¬
mine which ones grew best in the
area. A species originating in Mexico
and further developed in China was
particularly promising. The soil fer¬
tility improvement that resulted
in increased corn yields was so
dramatic that researchers decided
in 1990 to begin a four-year trial
with farmers, 

with funding from the
Rockefeller Foundation.
However, good results from
controUed experiments may not
always look the same when the
work is taken to the real world.
ICRAF researchers found that farm¬
ers, since they could not risk a
decrease in their crop yields, chose
thé worst land for their test plots.
Some branches were not cut often
enough because the women, who
do most of the farming, were over¬
burdened by the tasks of feeding
and caring for their families.
On Ojuok's farm, the cows don't
like the leaves. On other farms, one
of the most serious problems has
been that livestock and wild ani¬
mals are so eager to eat the leaves
that they wreck the experiment.
Although Ojuok's cattie are fussier,
he has noticed that the rows of trees
are controlling soil erosion.
But although agroforestry shows
great promise for reclaiming lands
starved ofnutrients and supporting
agriculture on a sustainable basis, it
is no panacea. The soils on Serfina
Ouko's farm, for example, are
severely damaged by erosion and
bad ploughing. "I'm not sure if this
approach will be enough," said Rob
Swinkels, an agricultural economist
with ICRAF, shaking his head as he
looked at knee-high corn that
should come up to his waist and
the yellowed leaves on the trees.
In Kenya, 16 million people on
small farms produce 60 to 70 per
cent of the country's food. Typical of
these farmers, Ojuok wants another
season or two to evaluate the pros
and cons of agroforestry. The
income from increased corn yields
and other benefits must balance
the land taken by the trees and the
extra effort required to cut their
branches. In the long term, what
hangs in the balance is the viability
of smaU-scale agriculture and a-
whole nation's food supply.
