Initiated in 1992 in Bio de
Janeiro (Brazil) at the United
Nations Conference on Environ¬
ment and Development, Green
Cross International (GCI) was offi¬
cially launched in Kyoto (Japan) in
1993 by its president, Mikhail
Gorbachev. It is an open, net¬
working forum of decision-makers
and grassroots movements con¬
cerned with implementing the
Action 21 Programme that issued
from the Bio Conference.
In November 1994 the Director-
General of UlNKSCO, Federico
Mayor, and Mikhail Gorbachev
signed a three-year contract of
agreement to co-operate in the
areas of sustainable tourism and
water resources management and in
creating a data bank on the envi¬
ronment. Today, eighteen countries
in Africa, the Americas, Asia and
Europe already have national GCI
branches and are ready to develop
a variety of original projects.
Green Cross Bolivia, for
example, has used Bolivian Army
radio to broadcast nationwide all
kinds of practical information and
ideas on environmental issues. At
the same time 400 high-ranking
officers have taken environmental
education courses and then
trained 500 sergeants, who in turn
taught 15,000 soldiers. In a year's
time more than 30,000 conscripts
aged between eighteen and
twenty-one from all over the
country will have been informed of
the environmental problems in
their home regions. Military bases
can also be used to protect
national parks and biosphere
reserves. Ulla Ulla National Park,
where a training centre was
opened in August 1995, is a case
in point.
GCI is also concerned about
the aftermath of the Cold War. Its
Legacy Programme, now well
underway, seeks to encourage

efforts in both East and West to
inventory and destroy stockpiles of
chemical and nuclear weapons.
Working groups are already
engaged on this task in the United
States, Bussia and Western
Europe. Experts have met, and
two pilot projects have been insti¬
gated in Bussia.
Although it is active on all envi¬
ronmental fronts, GCI attaches
particular importance to data-

gathering and education. Its
FACT information network
enables teachers all over Bussia
who are concerned about the envi¬
ronment to have e-mail access to
an education resource centre in
Moscow. In Argentina a school spe¬
cializing in environmental ques¬
tions offers a three-year training
programme, held after school
hours and during the summer hol¬
idays, to students aged 18 to 25.
Theoretical teaching goes hand in
hand with practical workshops
and on-the-ground training
courses. GCI has also opened an
Internet forum called Green
CrossBoads which is currently
focusing on international trade and
sustainable development.
