Life below ground
by J acek Rewerski
Troglodyte communities down the centuries
have created a little-known form of
architecture that demonstrates exceptional
versatility and resourcefulness
'Strictly speaking, troglodytes are
! CB9 people who live in caves hollowed out
by human agency. The earliest of them lived
in the New Stone Age, when societies aban-
doned hunting and turned to farming and
animal husbandry. Unlike their ancestors, the
hunters of the Old Stone Age who took tem-
porary refuge in natural caves against bad
weather or attack, troglodytes (the word is
derived from the Greek trogle, hole, and
dunein, enter) used a favourable geological
environment (soft but not friable rock) to
create areas that could be used as dwellings
and for economic activity as well as for wor-
ship, burial and defence.
It is simpler to hew a shelter out of rock
than to build one, but considerable under-
standing of the natural environment is called
for, as well as a remarkable capacity to adapt to
it. Contrary to what is often thought, the
underground dwelling is not a backward
form of architecture but rather a more eco-
nomical way of living, above all in regions
where building materials such as wood are
rare. As a result, most troglodyte dwellings
are found in arid regions, where the big dif-
ferences between day-time and night-time
temperatures and the frequency of sand-
storms are an incentive to search for service-
able shelter.
Hewn from the living rock
To a greater extent than natural caves,"artifi-
cial"underground dwellings are designed on a
human scale to meet human needs. The eco-
nomic and ecological advantages of this ancient
form of habitat, especially stability of temper-
ature, have attracted the interest of modern
architects, who believe that it holds rich possi-
bilities for the present and the future.
The oldest known troglodytic site is at
Beersheba in Israel, where thirty-odd under-
ground dwellings dating from the fourth mil-
lennium B. C. were excavated in the 1950s. The
dwellings, which could house between 200
and 300 people, are positioned at intervals
along a two-kilometre-long site on the banks
of a stream. At the neolithic site of Banpo, in

remains of hollowed-out dwellings which pre-
figure settlements that appeared in China later
on. The prehistoric site of La Madeleine in the
Perigord region of France, which has given its
name to an important culture of the Old Stone
Age, is interesting on two grounds. Firstly, it
shows how troglodytism began in rock shel-
ters that were first used by hunters and then
extended by digging. Secondly, it was inhab-
ited over an extraordinarily long period which
lasted, with interruptions, from the Mag-
dalenian (10, 000 B. C.) to the sixteenth century.
Troglodytism belongs to a very ancient
and widespread tradition which still con-
tinues to be practised. There are more than
40 million troglodytes in China today. In
Tunisia, ancient dwellings hewn vertically out
of the rock have been transformed into
attractive hotel complexes. Remarkable
examples of cave-dwelling communities still
exist in Spain, Italy and France. In the Saumur

region of France, near the river Loire, many
cave dwellers enjoy the same amenities as
householders who live above ground. At the
same time many troglodytic sites have been
abandoned, many are deteriorating and will
soon be beyond repair, and others have dis-
appeared entirely, even if some are being ren-
ovated thanks to tourism. Is troglodytism
merely a survival from a bygone age which
will one day be forgotten ?
As an original way of life and form of
architecture, troglodytism is part of the
world's cultural diversity. But the traditional
systems to which it belongs and which have
functioned for thousands of years now seem
doomed gradually to disappear under the
pressure of growing standardization. Both the
ancient and the modern forms of the heritage
are in danger. Troglodytism is little known
and tends to be a source of suspicion, largely
because of the ambiguous image of the
underground world, regarded in many cul-

tures both as the home of the dead and a place
of renewal, tomb and matrix. It is a source of
both attraction and repulsion.
Sanctuaries and refuges
One of the most spectacular forms of this
architectural tradition is sacred troglodytism.
Underground temples, monasteries, burial
vaults and catacombs hewn out of the rock
constitute a vast heritage designed for wor-
ship or burial, showing how the human imag-
ination regards rock as an impregnable form
of shelter. To bury one's dead in a rock-tomb
is to stake an eternal claim to that place.

The tomb-temples of Petra in Jordan, the
Buddhist temple-monasteries of Ajanta and
Ellora in India, the burial vaults of Lycia and
the rock churches and hermitages of Cap-
padocia in Turkey are outstanding examples
of troglodytic sanctuaries. Some of them,
such as the rock churches of Lalibela in
Ethiopia, are still used for worship. These
forms of sacred architecture hewn from the
living rock are highly sophisticated. Carving a
sanctuary from the block, like sculpture,
allows no room for error.
People who live in caves become invisible
and inaccessible to the outside world, and

cave-dwelling has been practised as a defen-
sive ploy on every continent by individuals
and communities. Many of the villages con-
structed by the Dogon people along the steep
sandstone Bandiagara cliffs in Mali contain
refuges in crannies in the rock to which the
villagers could retreat when attacked. In the
West of the United States are sites where for-
tified villages were built amidst a multitude of
granaries and food-stores hewn out of the
rock. People living in these villages clinging
to canyon walls could cut themselves off
from outsiders by removing the ladders that
gave access to them. In Cappadocia, thou-
sands of people could take refuge with stores
of food and livestock in the extraordinary
troglodyte settlements of Kaymakli and
Derinkuyu.
There are large numbers of underground
civilian and military fortifications in Europe,
ranging from Roman and medieval refuges to
the buried parts of twentieth-century defen-
sive systems such as the Maginot Line.
Poland, a land of plains which has been
invaded many times, is particularly rich in for-
tifications which in many cases have an under-
ground section as their main feature. Highly
interesting specimens of underground archi-
tecture have also survived on old battlefields.
During the First World War, the German
army built a network of dugouts in old quar-
ries on the Chemin des Dames in Champagne
(France) and joined them by means of tunnels
and railways. These underground installations

equipped with electricity and telephone

and chapels. On most First World War battle-
fields, men stationed for long periods under-
ground produced forms of art-graffiti, sculp-
tures, poems carved on the walls-which are
by no means negligible.
Architecture
by subtraction
In spite of its wealth, diversity and beauty, the
underground heritage does not enjoy the same
prestige as that built on the surface. Improving
its status is not easy. The conservation of so-
called"natural"habitats is a new departure. We
must try to understand how they blend into
the environment and how to preserve them
from erosion, the risk of which is increased by
their fragility, which is caused by digging and
is inherent in the very principle of this"sub-
tractive"form of architecture. Conserving a
cave dwelling is a totally different activity fro m
conserving a building made of"dead"stone
removed from its environment. A cave
building lives, changes and ages with the earth
of which it is a part.
This multi-faceted heritage-monu-
mental, archaeological, ethnographic, urban,
rural, industrial-illustrates to an exceptional
degree the ways in which human settlement
can blend with the environment. It is per-
fectly suited for inclusion in UNESCO's
World Heritage policy, which takes into
account both the cultural and natural dimen-
sions of sites. Some major troglodytic sites
registered on the World Heritage List
(described elsewhere in this issue) are now
strictly protected, but many others are still
awaiting the necessary national and interna-
tional recognition. They must be saved from
ruin and from oblivion.
With the growing popularity of environ-
mentalism more and more people are inter-
ested in getting"back to the earth". At the
same time, infrastructures in towns and cities
are increasingly being buried underground as
a result of demographic pressure. Troglo-
dytism is being rediscovered.

Sauvegarde) is an international
multidisciplinary research group for
the study and promotion of the
rock-hewn heritage. It is affiliated o
the International Council on
Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).
We should like to contact
people with specialist ornon-
specialist knowledge of the
underground and rock-hewn heritage
who may be interested in working
with us. We are anxious to find out
what is being done in this field
throughout he world and to
discover new sites. We should also
like to assemble as much
information on the subject as
possible and create an
internationally ccessible data bank.
HADES would be pleased to
hear from any person, institution
or business interested in
contributing toan original project
on behalf of this unusual and little-
known heritage.
