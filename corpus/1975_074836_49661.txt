Male chauvinists
are made not born,
concludes a
sociologist after a
continent-wide
inquiry
by Hernán San Martin
I T may appear to be stating the
' obvious to say that a woman is
a person in her own right just the
same as a man is. Yet in a great
number of contemporary societies,
where the long-standing myth of the
inferiority of women and the superio¬
rity of men still persists, this fact is
not easily accepted.
HERNÁN SAN MARTIN, Chilean sociolo¬
gist now living in Paris, has taught in a number
of universities in Latin America and Africa and
has worked in Asia as a U.N. specialist on
higher education. Among his many pub¬
lished works are " Salud y enfermedad en

Machismo
LATIN AMERICA'S
MYTH-CULT OP MALE SUPREMACY
Most of the traits which at any
given epoch have been considered to
be natural biological characteristics
of womanhood are in fact acquired
through the assimilation of customs,
traditions and myths as to the social
roles or functions men and women are
expected to carry out.
In other words, genetically speaking,
one is born male or female, but the
social roles of a woman or a man are
learned; they are a cultural acquisition
specific to each society. It is from
this situation that an abundant myth¬
ology regarding masculinity and femi¬
ninity has developed.
Most present-day societies expect
a woman to fulfil her feminine role
through marriage, as a lawful wife and
mother. However, she can just as
well become a mother without getting
married, and there would seem to be
nothing shameful in that. But society
sanctions the woman who steps out of
line by making her motherhood un¬
pleasant for her.
There are no such sanctions for the
man who fathers an illegitimate child,
though. So it is not surprising that
marriage should have become the aim
of most women in societies, in the
majority today, where an independent
life is not nearly so easy for a woman
as it can be for a man.
The situation of women in these so¬
cieties is made more difficult by the
fact that their upbringing is entirely
oriented towards the goal of marriage.
Not that we have anything against
marriage as such, but it happens to
have become the focal point of a num¬
ber of myths which have gained the
status of social imperatives.
They include the myth of femininity
the myth that marriage is inevitable,
the myth of spinsterhood, of virginity,
etc., and, on the other side of the coin,
the myth of "machismo", of male
supremacy, which is in fact the myth
of woman's "inevitable dependence"
on man and that of man's "natural
authority" over woman. In other
words, of man's superiority in all
things.
How much truth is there in all this?
The tremendous influence of culture
on what the Western Christian world
has held as "natural" in the behaviour
and prerogatives of the sexes has
been demonstrated beyond all ques¬
tion.
On this subject of "male" and "fe¬
male" behaviour and attitudes, the fa¬
mous American anthropologist Marga¬
ret Mead, in her remarkable study of
three New Guinea peoples in the Pa¬
cific (1), has this to say :
"We found the Arapesh both men
and women displaying a personality
that, out of our historically limited
preoccupations, we would call mater¬
nal in its parental aspects, and femi¬
nine in its sexual aspects. We found
men, as well as women, trained to be
co-operative, unaggressive, responsive
to the needs and demands of others.
(1 ) " Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive
Societies " (Morrow and Co. Inc., New York).
29

^- We found no idea that sex was a
powerful driving force either for men
or for women.
"In marked contrast to these atti¬
tudes, we found among the Mundu-
gumor that both men and women
developed as ruthless, aggressive,
positively sexed individuals, with the
maternal cherishing aspects of perso¬
nality at a minimum. Both men and
women approximated to a personality
type that we in our culture would find
only in an undisciplined and very vio¬
lent male.
"Neither the Arapesh nor the Mun-
dugumor profit by a contrast between
the sexes; the Arapesh ideal is the
mild, responsive man married to the
mild, responsive woman; the Mundu-
gumor ¡deal is the violent aggressive
man married to the violent aggressive
woman.
"In the third tribe, the Tchambuli,
we found a genuine reversal of the
sex-attitudes of our own culture, with
the woman the dominant, impersonal,
managing partner, the man the less
responsible and the emotionally de¬
pendent person."
One could give many other exam¬
ples to show that women are quite
capable of fulfilling not only the roles
attributed to them as women, but also
those assigned to men. There is no
doubt that training, or the lack of it,
and specifically-oriented education
have had a great deal to do with the
way people distinguish between mas¬
culine and feminine roles.
This differentiation began long ago
when work in ancient communities
was allocated according to age and
sex. The practice took root and even¬
tually came to be considered as part
of the natural order of things.
In time the distinction between the
roles of men and women became even
more sharply defined, culminating in
hierarchic societies divided into eco¬
nomic and social classes where the
goal of life was, as it still is, to accu¬
mulate wealth and power.
During the European Middle Ages
women were included among material
possessions as the property of men,
which buttressed the myth of an in¬
trinsic difference between the roles of
men and women so solidly that even
today there are those who use a
variety of irrational arguments in main¬
taining the theory of man's biological
and intellectual superiority over
woman.
In analysing the ideology and beha¬
viour associated with "machismo",
one also needs to examine the myth
of women's dependence on men.
"Machismo", the myth of the supe¬
riority and inborn authority of men
over women, is not only part of tradi¬
tional customs and beliefs in Latin
America, but is very much alive in
modern stratified societies, in many of
which male social supremacy has
been built into laws or has become an
accepted institution.
"Machismo" has become an op¬
pressive ideology expressed in many
different attitudes and forms of beha¬
viour, especially in economic life, em¬
ployment and sexual life. The supe¬
riority of the "macho" (sometimes
translated as "all man" or "he-man"),
which is the essence of the myth,
reveals itself in these and many other
fields, in which the archetypal male
appears as a mythical figure: strong,
dominant, authoritarian, brave, aggres¬
sive, paternal, self-confident, the great
seducer, polygamous and, naturally,
unfaithful.
The counterpart of this myth is the
myth of docile femininity, based es¬
sentially on the idea of woman's social
dependence on man, with the woman
seen as a gentle, submissive, self-
sacrificing, maternal, wifely, obedient
and faithful creature, who must be
respected even while being mistreated
in every sense of the word.
Table published below summarises
the major characteristics of this dual
mythology, as revealed by studies we
have carried out in various countries
of Latin America. A book presenting
the findings of our inquiry is to appear
shortly in Mexico City (El Hombre y
sus comportamientos: respuesta a
Konrad Lorenz [Man and his Behav¬
iour: a Reply to Konrad Lorenz] by H.
San Martin and Sarella Henriquez.)
These characteristics are consider¬
ed "normal" and "natural "by people
in Latin America. In fact they are both
real and mythical. Real because they
are part of the daily existence of men
and women, though of course to dif¬
ferent degrees. Mythical because they
are considered "natural" or innate,
whereas in point of fact they are a
cultural acquisition.
Obviously, this mythology is expres¬
sed in ways which vary from one coun¬
try to another according to its culture
and its social and economic structure,
and the influence of factors such as
religion or cultural exchange between
different ethnic groups living side by
side.
However, the myth is invariably
linked to and dependent on social and
economic structures, even in situations
which have no apparent connexion
with them. For example, the use of
the terms "stronger sex" and "weak¬
er sex" is not ungrounded, in view
of the fact that basically Latin Amer¬
ica's social system sets a higher va¬
lue on men as productive workers than
on women. Completely different open¬
ings are offered to men and women
on the labour market, and the situa¬
tion is scarcely different with regard
to access to education.
This mythology and these social dis¬
criminations lead most Latin American
women, in all but two or three coun¬
tries, to accept marriage as their so¬
cial objective. This is one conse¬
quence of the structure of society, ex¬
pressing the dependence of women
and the oppressive ideology imposed

by men, whose sense of possession is
extended to wife and family.
The man is the head of the family in
all respects. One of them, which is
of great importance In Latin America,
is the role assumed by the honour of
the family. This has given rise to sub-
myths, such as that of "purity and vir¬
ginity", which always applies to wives
and daughters, but never to men or
boys. This situation was legalized by
the "Indian Law" introduced in Latin
America by the Spaniards in colonial
times.
We find a similar interpretation of
the "purity" of women among the
castes of Sri Lanka and the Malabar
Coast in India, where girls are married
at an extremely early age, before pu¬
berty, perhaps with the aim of defen¬
ding this "purity" through a commit¬
ment to arriage and fidelity. In these
places a well-known proverb affirms
that "men's honour is preserved
through their womenfolk."
Latin America and Asia are by no
means the only places where this kind
of situation is found. Sociologists
have studied the concept of "honour"
in Mediterranean rural communities of
Europe, and have noted that the func¬
tion of "honour" is similar to the
Latin American idea, particularly to
the concept as it still exists in Mexico
and Colombia, for example.
The important thing is not to lose
sight of the fact that these mytholo¬
gies relating to the sexes are oppres¬
sive and discriminatory. The family
and social institutions tend to pro¬
duce a man or a woman rather than
a person. In other words, the roles
of male and female in society are attri¬
buted even before the child's persona¬
lity is sufficiently developed to assume
them. Children accept these roles un¬
consciously, though they may reject
them later on as adults when the my¬
thology is exposed for what it is. It is
at that point that women begin to de¬
mand their emancipation.
The influence of these myths can
also be clearly seen in the reasons
given by men and women for wanting
to get married. In a survey carried
out in Chile between 1968 and 1970
we obtained, among others, the fol¬
lowing results:
Reasons for marriage:
Chilean women
To get away from home and
be free	 19 %
Loneliness 14 %
Fear of becoming an old
maid 13 %
Because she thought she
was in love 	 13 %
Parental pressure 	 12 %
Because she was really
in love	 11 %
To have and run her own
home 7 %
Because she needed sup¬
port	 6 %
Because she wanted chil¬
dren 5 %
Reasons for marriage: Chilean men
To affirm his masculinity . . 27 %
To father children, thus
proving his virility 	 21 %
To have a companion to
help him in his home life . . 14 %
For economic advantages
and social prestige 	 14 %
Sexual attraction 14 %
Love	 7 %
Other reasons 	 3 %
So we can see that the Chilean
woman's main reason for getting mar¬
ried is to free herself from parental
control, although in fact she imme¬
diately becomes dependent, economi¬
cally and in other ways, on her hus¬
band. We also find given here as rea¬
sons for marriage other characteristics
of the feminine myth: fear of becoming
an old maid, submission to her parents'
wishes, her need for support and pro¬
tection because she feels unable to
stand on her own feet.
As for the Chilean man, he clearly
reveals his own mythical concept of
his personality when he declares that
his main reasons .for marrying are to
set up a family and have children, thus
affirming his masculinity and proving
his virility to the world at large. Only
then does he refer directly to his fu¬
ture wife, but merely as someone to
do the housework and look after the
children.
It is no mere chance that love
comes low down on the list of reasons
given by both men and women for get¬
ting married. This shows to what ex¬
tent the social system can influence
such highly personal decisions and
behaviour. It also reveals how male
possessiveness and other mythical
concepts carry more weight than what
should be the real basis for marriage:
a spontaneously loving relationship
between a man and a woman.
But, one may ask, what are the
social and historical realities out of
which this myth has grown and flou¬
rished?
The main characteristics of Latin
America's social systems today are
economic dependence, social under¬
development, a rigidly hierarchical
social structure, inequality of oppor¬
tunity between different groups, and
a system of values which, like the
male mythology, is handed down, pro¬
pagated and imposed through a syste-

matic education, the family, the mass
media, and so on.
People are living in a state of alie¬
nation, unable to make use of Latin
America's natural resources for human
development. The unending struggles
for freedom In the continent are proof
of the alienating situation in which the
great mass of the population is living.
In social conditions such as these
and with a system of values which
discriminates in favour of men, women
are obviously in a precarious situation
and this is everywhere apparent in
education, work, social security, the
university, civil rights and so on.
And yet according to a world survey
carried out some years ago by Unesco
(2), no country has laws obstructing
the access of women to education,
employment or a full social life. This
may be so in theory, but in practice
things are quite different.
Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Uruguay
are the Latin American countries
where women have fullest access to
all levels of education, to employment
and to civic life. Yet even in Chile,
for example, only about 25 per cent of
women of working age are actually
employed, and whereas in 1952 the
number of women with jobs totalled
25.3 per cent of women of working
age, this figure had dropped to 22.4
per cent by 1970.
The drop in the percentage of work¬
ing women, a general tendency throug¬
hout Latin America today, is due to
a failure to develop means of produc¬
tion and to the social stagnation resul¬
ting from economic dependence.
Other factors must also be taken
into account. The fact that a woman
works does not necessarily mean that
she is emancipated or enjoys equa¬
lity of opportunity with men, since
women are still under submission to
their husbands and there is a differ¬
ence between the kind of jobs open
to men and women.
Similar inequalities exist in educa¬
tion and the professions. Enrollment
statistics for women students in Chi¬
lean universities over the last ten years
show that the majority of women were
studying for four professions; educa¬
tion, pharmacy, the social services
and nursing. Similar findings emerge
with respect to non-professional work.

and women to technical and vocational

i>> in Chile are employed in "women's
jobs": in the textile industry, shops,
the services sector and foodstuffs.
And so it is clear that the problem
of women's economic dependence
and the whole mythology of their in¬
feriority to men is directly linked to
the economic activity and structure of
the country in which they live and has
nothing to do with the fact that they
are women.
If women play no part, or at any rate
too small a part, in society, it is be¬
cause they have been prevented from
doing so by social factors and not
because of their biological or psycho¬
logical characteristics. The world-wide
revolt of women and young people
today is a reaction to a historical
situation created by the "society of
the adult male."
Today women and young people are
claiming their rightful place in society.
This is not a conflict between genera
tions or between the sexes, still less is
it an aggressive attack on adults, as
Konrad Lorenz claims; it is simply the
legitimate outcry of a large section of
the population which has hitherto
been deprived of its responsibilities
and its rights.
What adds confusion to the situa¬
tion is the fact that we are witnessing
a pseudo-emancipation of women: cer¬
tain superficial aspects of the male-
female mythology are, it is true, being
demolished, but genuine freedom has
yet to be achieved. This is because
there can be no real emancipation of
women until men too have been fully
emancipated.
Women will not achieve their free¬
dom simply by leaving their parents'
home to get married, or by working in
offices and factories, only to find their
household chores waiting for them
when they get home.
On this subject the noted American
philosopher, Herbert Marcuse, has
made the following comment: "If this
is supposed to mean that all women
should get out of the house and find
a job, I don't see how it can be called
liberation. There would simply be
thousands upon thousands more sec¬
retaries having to sit for over eight
hours a day in an office taking idiotic
dictation from idiotic bosses on idiotic
matters, or standing for eight hours
a day in front of a conveyor belt. This
is not liberation."
Women can be free only in a society
that is free, and this cannot happen
unless men too are free. Women have
the same social problems as men.
Consequently, the liberation of both
sexes from dependence, from situa¬
tions created by myths, and from alie¬
nation, must be treated as a problem
of mutual concern which they must
solve together.
