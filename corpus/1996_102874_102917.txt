FRANCE BEQUETTE
is a Franco-American
journalist
specializing in
environmental
questions.
When some 2,000 years ago
the Greek geographer
Strabo described how the priests
of Crocodilopolis in Egypt waited
for the arrival of Roman "tourists"
before they began the ritual animal
sacrifice to feed the sacred croco¬
diles of the god Sebek, little did he
know that tourism was destined to
become so popular that one day
half a billion people would be vis¬
iting the earth's most beautiful
places.
World Tourism Organization
(WTO) forecasts indicate that by
the year 2000 international tourist
arrivals will total approximately
661 million, an annual growth rate
of 3.8 per cent. The hundreds of
millions of tourists who each year
travel in their own countries can
be added to this figure. How can
environmental protection, the bal¬
anced exploitation of natural
resources, equitable access to
the world heritage major chal¬
lenges of our time be reconciled
with the expansion of the tourist
industry?
A CHILD OF PROSPERITY
Tourism is undeniably a powerful
tool for development, but the forms
it has taken so far have often been
criticized for such negative
impacts as excessive use of land,
water and energy, the production
of was te, and heavy pressure on the
social environment and the historic
and cultural heritage.
The Council of Europe
Europe is the world's most impor- '
tant region for "generating" and
receiving tourists considers that
one reason for these negative
impacts is lack of planning and
management. Whether tourism has
good or bad effects will hinge at
least partly on what management
initiatives are taken by the tourist-
generating and receiving countries.
The major advantage of tourism
is that it brings in currency. In 1992
the turnover from tourism was
some $3.1 trillion, and the tourist
industry employed around 130 mil¬
lion people, or one in fourteen
workers worldwide. In a recent
study entitled Tourisme et envi¬
ronnement en Méditerranée
("Tourism and Environment in the
Mediterranean Region") Robert
Lanquar notes that tourism is pri¬
marily a social phenomenon. "In
comparison to the main traditional
areas of economic activity, tourism
is not a response to people's basic
needs but to a lifestyle made pos¬
sible by the prosperity of broad
social strata in the industrialized
nations. It is a recent historical
phenomenon."

The days of "real journeys"
offering what the French anthro¬
pologist Claude Lévi-Strauss called
"a spectacle in all its splendour, not
yet spoiled, contaminated and
ruined" are over. We must accept
the fact that there are no more
unvisited places on earth and that
everyone has the right to go any¬
where. But that is no excuse for
turning the Himalayas or the Sahara
into rubbish tips, for tour organizers
to advertise religious ceremonies in
Bali as tourist attractions or for cre¬
ating an amusement park in the
heart of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's
complex of sacred temples.
Of course many tourists steer
clear of the concrete holiday mega-
centres that disfigure the coasts of
France, Spain, Mexico and Thai¬
land. But even off this well-beaten

track, too massive an influx of visi¬
tors can harm the plant and animal
life and even the social fabric of the
regions they frequent. "Too many
of the people, companies and even
politicians involved in tourism," says
the Council of Europe, "are only
interested in maximizing short-term
profits . " All too often they succeed
in circumventing the laws protecting
the environment. Such "dispensa¬
tions" pose an extremely difficult
problem.
THE RIGHT CHOICE
The world's natural and cultural
heritage is an inalienable posses¬
sion that should be transmitted
intact to future generations. Many
states that lack exploitable nat¬
ural resources depend on tourism
for a considerable percentage of
their income. But tourism must be
carefully planned and controlled
if it is to be sustainable.
The mountain kingdom of
Bhutan, and the Maldive Islands in
the Indian Ocean have been studied
by Edward Inskeep for the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP). Bhutan, which is located
high on the eastern slopes of the
Himalayas and has a Buddhist cul¬
ture, possesses a chain of fortified
monasteries and palaces. In 1995
only 5,500 tourists from non-neigh¬
bouring countries (exclusively in
organized groups) were allowed into
the country. Their average stay was
nine days, and they spent a min¬
imum of 200 dollars per day and
per person. Tourists in Bhutan stick
to carefully planned routes , and new
buildings made to house them must
comply with the canons of tradi¬
tional architecture and be equipped
to treat sewage. In 1987 a commis¬
sion investigated the negative influ¬
ence of tourists on the religious
practices of young people and made
a number temples out of bounds to'
foreigners.
The Maldives, a small chain of
islands in the Indian Ocean, is a
Muslim country with a limited land
area. Income from tourism repre¬
sents nearly 20 per cent of Gross
National Product. Holiday instal¬
lations for tourists have been set
up on uninhabited islands to pre¬
vent the social and cultural life of
the local population (less than
200,000 people) from suffering.
THREATS TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN
Almost one third of the world's
tourists are visitors to the Mediter¬
ranean countries, where the growth-
rate of tourism in some coastal
areas has been spectacular. Malta is
a case in point. In 1993, this small
island (with an area 316 km2 and
350,000 inhabitants, it has one of
the world's highest population den¬
sities) received 1,063,069 visitors
who spent an estimated $542 mil¬
lion.
The increase in numbers, espe¬
cially in the summer months,
imposes considerable strain on the
supply ofwater, which is very scarce
on Malta it has been estimated
that tourists use twice as much
water as the permanent residents.
Desalination plants consume a great
deal of energy, and a new power sta-
tion is being built to meet the.
increased demand. Most of the
sewage is flushed untreated into the
sea, and some sandy beaches often
risk becoming polluted. Tourist
pressure on historic sites and local
communities is also very strong. The
city of Mdina, for example, is vis¬
ited by an average of 1 ,500 tourists
each day, a high influx that is
causing various kinds of harm.

The Maltese government has
taken steps to plan tourism devel¬
opment and manage access to sites
and monuments in order to respect
their carrying capacity, a concept
defined by the World Tourism
Organization as "the level of vis¬
itor use an area can accommodate
with high levels of satisfaction for
visitors and few negative effects on
resources."
A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
UNESCO is aware of the need to
strike a balance between tourism,
culture and development, and
encourages study and action in four
areas: defence and promotion of
the cultural heritage and cultural
identity; protection of the natural
environment against inroads from
tourism; encouragement of a form

of tourism that respects the social,
cultural and natural environment
and provides a basis for develop¬
ment; extension of cultural tourism
activities that may generate income
and jobs, especially for young
people in developing countries.
A World Conference on Sus¬
tainable Tourism, whose sponsors
included UNESCO, via its Man and
the Biosphere Programme (MAB)
and World Heritage Centre, was
held on 27 and 28 April 1995 in
Lanzarote in the Canary Islands
(Spain). The 500 participants
adopted a Charter for Sustainable
Tourism which emphasizes that
"tourism is ambivalent, since it can
contribute positively to socio-eco¬
nomic and cultural achievement,
[but also] to the degradation of
the environment and the loss of
local identity, and should there¬
fore be approached with a global
methodology".
Beautiful places are bound to
attract visitors. Everyone involved in
tourism must act responsibly. Oth¬
erwise the only solution will be to
close threatened sites and monu¬
ments to visitors and make copies of
them, as France has done for the
prehistoric caves of Lascaux or
else to organize virtual-reality
tourism with computer-generated

Tourism for peace
A
t a time when Israel, Palestine and
their Arab neighbours are involved in
I a peace process, it is vital that the
heritage of these countries, among the
richest in the world, should become a factor
in cultural, economic and social development
and a pivot of understanding and exchange
for people all over the world."
These words were spoken in October
1994 by Gilbert Trigano, until 1993 presi¬
dent of the internationally known tourist
organization Club Méditerranée, when pre¬
senting to Heads of State at the Middle
East-North African Economic Summit a pro¬
ject for a university of tourism and culture for
peace. The Summit, held in Casablanca under
the presidency of Morocco's King Hassan,
gave the project an enthusiastic welcome.
In all probability, the first two branches of
the university will be located in Israel and
Palestine.
The project was endorsed by King
Hassan, and Tunisia, Italy and France have
already expressed a desire to take part. A
three-year course involving 900 hours of
coursework per year will be offered to stu¬
dents via satellite television links, which will
considerably reduce costs. Teachers will visit
each branch campus in turn so as to make
personal contact with their students. Theo¬
retical studies will alternate with paid training
periods in the tourist industry totalling three
or four months a year.
The first year will concentrate on the basics
common to all jobs in the tourist industry and
will emphasize the importance of the cultural role
of tourism. The second and third years will con¬
centrate on the main fields of activity in the
industry, with the final semester being devoted
to the goal of "becoming an entrepreneur". The
television equipment is being tested this spring,
and the university will "open for business" in
September.
In recognition of the fact that this ini¬
tiative is in line with Unesco's goals, on 25
June 1995 Director-General Federico Mayor
signed a convention-of co-operation with the
"Association en faveur du Tourisme et de la
Culture pour la Paix" (Association of Tourism
and Culture for Peace), which was also ini¬
tialled by the Secretary-General of the World
Tourism Organization, Antonio Enriquez Sav-
ignac. Gilbert Trigano feels a mixture of hope
and anxiety. Anxiety because this is the first
interstate operation of its kind; hope because
of its potential for promoting understanding
and peace.
