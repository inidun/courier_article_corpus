‘It ’s your first trip offshore, i s n ’t it?”The ques-
tion needs no formal response. Only a new-
comer to Conoco’s Viking B gas plat f o rm
could get lost in a dreamy gaze to the horizon or take
a hesitant step on the metal gr ates of the decks,
m e s m e rized by the sight of the North Sea rolling
t h i rty metres below.
For offshore initiat e s , the sea appears to be a
n o n - e n t i t y. The waves just fade into the back-
ground framing daily life.The closest you come
to actually feeling them is when the crane
rumbles to unload cargo—the vibrations gently
rocking the plat f o rm perched on giant metal legs
140 kilometres off the coast of Lincolnshire
( U K ) . Outside of a power fa i l u r e , you wo n ’t
e ven hear the waves roll above the hum, gri n d
and whine of the equipment that keeps about six
million standard cubic metres of gas surgi n g
daily through pipelines lining the seabed to
s h o r e .
“At firs t , yo u ’re just fa s c i n ated by the sea,”
s ays Vera Swa n , one of the few female employe e s
on the cat e ring staff looking after the crew of
s e venty-odd men. “ You get worked up over sun-
sets and stand quietly with the others. But after
six ye a rs , I forget that I am out to sea.”
“I’m new out here,” s ays Steve Slinger. “ S o
the sea is still a novelty for me. I thought the
N o rth Sea was grey but it can be a beautiful tur-
quoise blue. I’m still in the phase of looking out
and thinking ‘ Wow ! ’ But that will probably
p a s s ,” he say s. “The hard part is not being able
to go for a long wa l k .You feel penned in by the
wat e r. But I didn’t come offshore to admire the
wave s. I came because the money is good. A t
f o rt y - five , I ’ ve got no formal qualific ations but a
lot of work experi e n c e . Where I come from in
S c o t l a n d , you are doing quite well by making
£15,000 [$25,000] per ye a r.” S a l a ries offshore
range between £28,000 [$45,000] and £70,000
[$115,000] for senior managers.
Money-making clearly surpasses sea-fa ri n g
as the main offshore at t r a c t i o n . H owe ve r , it is
the routine of plat f o rm life which seems to
d r own out any romantic notions of life at sea.
“ I t ’s just not the same as when yo u ’re on a ship
and you actually go somewhere,” s ays Hank
R aw l i n s , who has worked offshore twe n t y - t h r e e
of his fif t y - five ye a rs. On the plat f o rm , e ve ry-
thing is progr a m m e d . After two weeks of holiday
at home, crew members arri ve by helicopter for
f o u rteen days of twe l ve-hour work shifts, e s s e n-
tially spent adjusting, testing and maintaining
the machinery used to measure and compress
the gas piped in from five remote-controlled
fields nearby. The slightest adjustment requires
c o n s u l t ation with a superv i s o r. “ You can feel like
a robot,” quips crew-member, Mick Draper,
“until you realize just what you are sitting on.
Remember how easy it is to light your gas hea-
ting system at home and consider that out here,
the gas pressure is 1,500 times that .”
But once the shift is ove r , the biggest decision
m ay be whether to have rice pudding at dinner or
a work-out in the gym. For Viking life is surp ri-
singly civilized. S t e wardesses make the beds
e ve ry morn i n g, with fresh laundry folded at the
door and meals waiting in the mess hall.
E venings are spent flipping through the daily
tabloids (delivered by helicopter) or the televi-
sion channels.While alcohol is strictly forbidden,
smoking is perm i t t e d . And home no longer feels
so far away with free telephone calls ava i l a b l e .
Yet for all the creature comfort s , the sea still
sneaks up on the plat f o rm .The sea is so much a
p a rt of daily life that people stop seeing it. Fo r
e x a m p l e , you start preparing for a possible plun-
ge into the fri gid waves (2-60C) before even lea-
ving the coast. C r e w - m e m b e rs and visitors alike
actually practise finding their way out of heli-
c o p t e rs which have crashed and spun upside
d own in the murky, cold water of special pools.
Once offshore, no one dares walk the deck
without donning a bright red suit. If anyo n e
does slip off, a surveillance team can spot and
scoop them up with a “mother ship” and her
“ d a u g h t e r ” constantly patrolling the plat f o rm
p e ri m e t e r.
With so much attention paid to the lives the
sea may take, it is easy to overlook what it gi ve s.
Fishing was a favo u rite pastime until the heli-
copter pilots began complaining about the
smells of dinner-packages taken home. B i r d s
literally drop in, exhausted by the North Sea’s
The sea is so much a part of
daily life on a North Sea gas
platform that you almost forget
it’s there.

d i m e n s i o n s. Suddenly another day spent adjus-
ting machinery gi ves way to tenderness and
c u ri o s i t y, as crew-members flock to the lost
c r e at u r e s , feeding them, c h a rting their arri va l
and even taking them ashore by helicopter.
More import a n t l y, “ you find confid e n c e ,”
s ays June Cerey, who does V i k i n g ’s laundry
d u ring the night shift. After raising her sixteen-
year-old son, she decided at the age of thirt y - five
to carve out a new life for herself offshore. A f t e r
getting past the usual jitters of walking the gr a-
ted decks and feeling a “ wee bit scared” of the
h e l i c o p t e r , the real challenge lay in wa l k i n g
through the mess hall during dinner. “ I ’d get so
e m b a rrassed at being the only wo m a n . T h e y ’r e
not the ‘rough and ready’ guys I expected, bu t
real family men. S t i l l , it takes some confid e n c e .”
“There is also a real sense of freedom,” s ay s
Bob T h o rp e , one of V i k i n g ’s two superv i s o rs.
“Out here, you concentrate on your wo r k
without eve ry d ay wo rries like a broken wa s h i n g
m a c h i n e . You get job sat i s fa c t i o n . Then you go
a s h o r e , and you focus on your home and fa m i l y.”
A b ove all else, the sea imposes self-reliance.
“If there is an emergency, you cannot call an
a m bulance or fir e m e n ,” s ays T h o rp e . “ We rely
on ours e l ve s. This is why you don’t find the ste-
reotypical macho guy out here. Men like that
tend to be ri s k - t a k e rs , thinking they’re ‘too big’
to follow safety procedures. They just don’t last
long because the rest of the crew wo n ’t accept
t h e m , especially since Piper A l p h a .” This is the
name of another North Sea plat f o rm which
exploded ten ye a rs ago, killing 167 of the 226
c r e w - m e m b e rs. A lethal mix of major design
flaw s , poor safety planning and incompetent lea-
d e rship set off the fir e .The sea proved to be the
final escape. The sole surv i vo rs were those who
jumped ove r b o a r d .
Besides the gi ve and take, the sea also
demands respect, which may have been long in
c o m i n g . When the North Sea drilling industry
first began in the 1970s, e nv i r o n m e n t a l
c o n c e rns were non-existent. To d ay companies
like Conoco can no longer ignore them.
According to the ru l e s , the only thing to be
dumped off Viking is human wa s t e . C h e m i c a l s ,
f u e l , bits of broken tools are carefully collected
for disposal onshore.Yet despite all the precau-
t i o n s , gas leaks, p ri m a rily into the at m o s p h e r e ,
c o n t i n u e , e ven though they are a far bigger pro-
blem on drilling plat f o rm s.
On a more personal leve l , it is the sheer force
of the sea which captures the crew’s imagi n at i o n
and respect. “I have been offshore for about ten
ye a rs ,” s ays Paul Preston. “I can walk past the
waves in the morning without really seeing
t h e m . But I am still taken by the sea. D u ring a
s t o rm , you see the strength of it and imagine the
violence it can do. T h at ’s when I realize what a
minuscule dot we are on. M aybe you need to
forget that you are surrounded by the sea.
Because if you began thinking about all that can
go wrong, you could never work out here.” ■
