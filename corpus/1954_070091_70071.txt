Triumph in Wood
Norway's Stavkirker (stave chur¬
ches) are medieval masterpieces
in wood which never fail to
surprise visitors from abroad.
These all-wood churches take their
name from the staves massive
upright timbers which are a basic
part of their construction.
But what really impresses the new¬
comer to the Norwegian scene is the
strong resemblance these churches
bear to giant trees. The "stave
church", wrote Anders Bugge, a Nor¬
wegian art specialist,* "stands rooted
in the floor of the valley, with all the
majestic isolation of a huge fir, with
the dragon head carvings reaching out
like branches and the spire, to crown
all, pointing to the sky, while weather¬
ed shingle, like layers of branches one
above the other, encloses the holy
shrine."
Built entirely of wood and having a
form so suggestive of a tree, the stave
churches could serve as a symbol of
Norway itself, with its vast pine and
spruce forests. Wood is available
there in almost unlimited quantities
and has always been a widely used
building material one which Nor¬
wegians have always known how to
treat with the virtuosity of master
craftsmen, in their architecture and
carvings.
There was once a particular exam¬
ple of Norwegian wood carving which
the rest of Europe came to know
and to fear in early medieval
times. This was the drakkar, the
carved dragon's head prow on the
ships of the Vikings who set out from
the Scandinavian lands Norway,
Sweden and Denmark and learned
to penetrate all the greater waterways
of Europe well before the end of the
9th century A.D.
Well organized and equipped, these
Vikings raided England, Ireland,

long, lean ships swept down to Spain
and even as far as North Africa. And
these expeditions were only prelimi¬
nary to wider voyages through which
at last even the New World became
known for a time to men of Scandi¬
navian birth.
The Vikings sailed up rivers and
attacked cities; they occupied lands
and established settlements. So great
was their prowess as warriors that a
special prayer"From the fury of the
Norsemen, Good Lord, deliver us" was
inserted in some of the litanies of the
countries of the West.
monsters
It was difficult to re¬
sist the onslaughts of
these sea-going war¬
riors. They were raid¬
ers who sailed out in
quest of glory, who
made a fetish of cour¬
age and who disdain¬
ed death because their
Valhalla only prolong¬
ed the hotblooded life
of a Viking hero.
They even took poets
with them in their
vessels to write the
sagas of their wars.
A Europe imbued with
its Roman heritage met
the civilization of an
unknown land. Though
the clash was violent,
both Norwegians and
Western Europeans
alike profited by it.
The Vikings and their 3
ships terrified entire
peoples and left the bitterness of sack
and pillage in their wake, but they
also brought the first Norwegian con¬
tribution to European culture.
It was a contribution of craftsman¬
ship in the form of jewellery, golden
spurs and arms inlaid with silver, for
the Vikings looked upon their smiths
as artists practising a noble profes¬
sion. And literature was enriched by
the sagas and legends from the
northern lands.
This sudden expansion of the Vik¬
ings into other parts of Europe also
had its counterflow, especially follow
ing the introduction of Christianity
into Norway around 1 000 A.D. when
King Olav (St Olav) was working for
a united and Christian country. The
new religion brought with it the ele¬
ments of an ancient civilization until
then unknown in Norway.
Medieval art in Norway, therefore,
was influenced by the opposing cur¬
rents of national and foreign trends,
of old traditions and new ideas. And
we could hardly find a better exam¬
ple of this struggle than the stave
churches. These have been called
translations of Gothic churches into
wood. As it happens they were pre¬
cursors of Gothic in several techni¬
cal aspects, and even if there was
an element of "translation" involved,
the churches are nevertheless true
examples of a national art.
Their general form of construction
may have come from abroad but it
was adapted to the character of the
country and conceived and executed
with traditional techniques and ma¬
terials to harmonize perfectly with
the country's established customs
and ideas. What was basically new in
the churches was the introduction of
figure painting and sculpture, which
had not previously been practised in
Norway despite the great wood-working
skill of the people.
It is not surprising that the stave
churches are so little-known in other
countries, for they were only "disco¬
vered" by the Norwegians themselves
in 1826 when Professor J. C. Dahl, a

painter and teacher at the Fine Arts
Academy in Dresden, returned to his
native country after a long absence
and was struck by their beauty and
masterly craftsmanship.
He told of his enthusiasm in a pub¬
lication which he entitled in German:
Denkmale einer seher ausgebildeten
Holzbaukunst aus den frühesten Jahr¬
hunderten in den inneren landschaf-
ten Norwegens. This long and des¬
criptive title expressed exactly what
Dahl had discovered in his travels
monuments of a highly perfected ar¬
chitecture in wood, the heritage of
early centuries, discovered in outlying
areas of Norway.
But it so happened that 1826 was
the time of Romanticism, and the
"scale covered monsters" (a contem¬
porary term for the stave churches)
were unappreciated. Dragon heads
reared up from the gables of these
churches, the same dragon heads
which had witnessed the heroic past
of Norway from the prows of Viking
ships, and the same monsters who
proudly raised their necks above the
first stone churches in 1300.
Unfortunately, Dahl's discovery
came somewhat late. Through indif-

ference or incomprehension, a good
many of the stave churches which had
weathered the years and remained in
excellent condition had nevertheless
been demolished. Between the 11th
and 12th centuries, more than 1,000
staves churches were constructed, but
today- only a handful remain.
Later stone churches appear aus¬
tere alongside these wood structures
with their elaborate interlaced carved
motifs of slender serpents entangled
in ferocious battles as they were on
the bows of the Viking ships. Another
motif, the acanthus leaf, only made
its appearance in the 12th century,
borrowed from the holy books brought
by English missionaries. Though of
foreign origin, this motif was incor¬
porated into the animalistic style, and
it fitted into the rhythm and the
aggressiveness inherited from the he¬
roic days of the Norsemen, and be¬
came an element in a purely Nordic
style.
This animalistic
style is the very
essence of tradition¬
al Norwegian art.
Its origin goes back
to the era when
men engraved the
image of the stag
on the walls of
their cave homes.
The Norwegian art¬
ist found inspiration
in mountains, in
forests and in water¬
falls. He was representative of a
warlike people battling cold and dark¬
ness, but whose art was softened by
the magic half-light of summer nights
in the Far North. When Christianity
arrived the animals of a pagan faith
were not forgotten as artists carved
works to the glory of a new divinity.
Writing of Borgund, the most repre¬
sentative of existing stave churches,
Anders Bugge evokes the atmosphere
which must have existed in those far-
off days :
"From a window in the west gable
and from small apertures placed high

above in the walls of the raised mid¬
dle section, the daylight filters in fit¬
fully, filling the space beneath the
lofty arched rafters with a chiaros¬
curo, bright enough for us to see with
surprising clarity. This half-light must
have increased the effect of the glit¬
ter from the candles on the altar,
which in the Middle Ages could be
glimpsed through a choir opening
much narrower than the present one.
The flickering light glancing over the
rich vestments of the clergy and the
gleam of holy vessels, must have
provided an enchanting and dazzling
setting for the solemn service enacted
in the choir within."
Authorities consider that Norwe¬
gian medieval art reached its flower¬
ing under the reign of
King Haakon Haak-
onsson (1204-1263). But
by 1349, the year of
the "Black Death" this ,
rich era came to an
end. Some books speak
of a "decadence" in
the period that follow¬
ed, but it was only a
relative one, for the
old native themes were
taken up by secular
art and gave birth to
new masterpieces. To¬
day these old themes
continue to inspire new
generations of Nor¬
wegian artists.
For centuries, Nor- ¡
way's wooden churches i
have braved the
assaults of wind and
weather. We begin to
understand why, when
we read an account left
by Professor Lorentz
Dietrichson who lived
from 1834 to 1917.
He wrote: "Up in the
mountains the weather
was clear. The sun set
the tufts of heather
aglow and the morning
air was vibrating with
light as I entered the
shadow of the old stave
church to take mea¬
surements and to make
notes. But during the
morning the weather
changed and a storm
broke suddenly outside.
"The walls of the old
church creaked as if
they were ready to
cave in. It seemed as
if each plank was
about to tear lose from
its place, break away
from its fixed frame of
pillars and beams and bring down
everything under the shaking columns.
The entire building seemed to be
oscillating and, in fact, it was.
"But little by little the creakings
seemed to become more regular and
rhythmical. Despite the howling of
the storm growing even stronger, the
noise around me diminished it was as
if the planks had slipped back into
their grooves. The entire building
regained its equilibrium and its calm.
"Although the storm, instead of
abating, became even more violent, I
soon heard neither the slightest noise
nor the least creaking from the walls
of the stave church. The entire build¬
ing had settled: from now on, it would
stand hard and fast in the midst of
the torment around it."
And today, though reduced in num¬
ber through man's indifference, the
stave churches of Norway stand as
firm to meet future storms as they
have since the day when master ar¬
chitects and craftsmen first con¬
structed them.
To reveal to art lovers throughout
the world these masterpieces of Nor¬
dic art a volume entirely devoted to
them is to be published early in 1955
in the Unesco World Art series. It
will contain many reproductions in
colour of the superb wall and altar
paintings, as well as black and white
illustrations showing the unique archi¬
tectural character of these buildings.
