G l o b a l i z ation looks ve ry different when it is seen, not from the capitals of the We s t , bu t
from the cities and villages of the South, where most of humanity live s. Four examples
taken from my own country, Pe ru ,i l l u s t r ate how the paradoxical forces shaping glo-
balization look when seen from the other side.
In October 1999,28 schoolchildren died in Taucamarca,a remote village in the high-
lands of Peru,after drinking water and powdered milk mixed in a vat that had contained
a powerful insecticide. Nobody could read the label on the vat and the children we r e
poisoned.The insecticide in question has been banned in practically every industrialized
nation;its sale continues only in places like my country.
S e c o n d l y, an important annual event recently took place in Cajamarca, in the nort h
of Pe ru . Po t ato gr owe rs gather there to exchange the best seeds they have produced in the
last ye a r. It is an act of pride for communities to share with others seeds that will help
i m p r ove the production of potat o e s. In 1999, t r a n s n ational corp o r ations attended the fes-
tival and are now working to patent the genes of these traditionnal foodstuffs in order to
sell them at profit.
Pe ru ’s macro-economic indicat o rs are excellent. In the offices of investment ban-
k e rs , you will be told that Pe ru is a gr e at investment opport u n i t y.The situation is not so
rosy howe ve r , when considered from the pers p e c t i ve of Pe ru v i a n s. Fifty per cent of the
population have been living below the poverty line for the last ten years.Twenty per cent
of the population are living below the critical pove rty line: their income is insufficient to
pay for even minimal nourishment.Two-thirds of the workforce is unemployed or under-
employed,and between now and 2005,more people will enter the labour market in Peru
than in the whole of the European Union.
A distinguished North A m e rican political scientist, D r. Benjamin Barber, r e c e n t l y
pointed out that in the United States democracy had degenerated into bri n ging one gr o u p
of rascals in for four years,and then throwing them out and replacing them with another
group of rascals for four ye a rs. From the pers p e c t i ve of the South, t h at looks ve ry good!
In a context where rascals manipulate elections and stay in power for fifteen or sixteen
years,I would appreciate the chance to throw them out through peaceful elections every
four years.
T h u s , the complaints of the North are often the aspirations of the South.P r o gress in indus-
trialized nations can be a threat to developing countries.
Ten ye a rs ago, in the euphoria of globalization and the expansion of services and fin a n-
ce that followed the fall of the Berlin Wa l l , I advanced the idea that we were entering a frac-
tured global order. G l o b a l i z ation brings us into contact with one another, but it also streng-
thens profound divisions and fractures in terms of societies and income, and most
i m p o rtantly in our capacity to generate and utilize know l e d g e .O ver the last ten ye a rs ,t h e
concentration of wealth and power has greatly increased both within and between socie-
ties.
There is a real risk of two civilizations emergi n g, with two ways of viewing and relat i n g
to the world:one based on the capacity to generate and utilize knowledge;the other pas-
sively receiving knowledge from abroad and deprived of the ability to modify it.
The world now faces the prospect of this Knowledge Divide becoming an unbri d g e a b l e
a b y s s.We need the intern ational community to return to the basic principles of intern a-
tional co-operation and introduce the idea that a minimum level of science and techno-
l o gical capability, including access to the Intern e t , is an absolute necessity for deve l o-
ping countries and should be the subject of international solidarity.
This can be achieve d . H owe ve r , c o n t r a ry to the situation of 20 ye a rs ago, n at i o n a l
g ove rnments are no longer the major playe rs in the game of science and technology.W h e-
ther we like it or not, the pri vate sector and the intern ational community of scholars must
be invited to the table with gove rnments from the North and South to begin discussing
an agenda for the mobilization of science and technology for deve l o p m e n t. UN E S C O, t h e
only United Nations agency with a mandate for the development of the sciences, has a spe-
cial role to play in the revitalization of intern ational co-operation in this fie l d . n
