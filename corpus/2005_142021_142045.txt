Born to Cure a Brother or Sister
 Brought into the world to save a member of their family, the “life-
saving babies” raise a number of ethical issues.
Six-year-old Ian* suf-
fers from a serious 
blood disease. To save 
him, his parents, from 
Leeds in the United 
Kingdom, had only 
one option: to con-
ceive another child 
with the same cell tis-
sue as his. Th e tissue 
is removed at birth 
from the umbilical 
cord, or later from 
the bone marrow. 
Ian’s mother became 
pregnant, but the 
fetus was carrying the same disease. She did not 
keep the baby. A second child was born and its 
tissue was compatible with Ian’s.
To avoid the risks inherent in genetics, it is 
now possible to select the embryo of the “life-
saving baby” that could save Ian. In 2001, the 
Human Fertility and Embryology Authority 
(HFEA), the government body that supervises 
clinics conducting in vitro fertilization, author-
ized pre-implantation diagnosis. A group called 
Comment on Reproductive Ethics (Core) 
immediately took the case to the courts. Aft er 
several more twists, Britain’s highest court, the 
Law Lords, fi nally confi rmed the HFEA’s deci-
sion in April 2005.
Core is still furious. “We think it is funda-
mentally wrong to conceive a child just to help 
another, regardless of how serious a disease 
they have,” said its director and founder, Jose-
phine Quintavalle. Her fear is that it will lead to 
“the creation of babies who are the right sex and 
have the right hair colour.”
“Th e use of such technology is morally justi-
fi ed when it is strictly regulated,” retorts the 
doctor who treated Ian. Th e HFEA stresses that 
it grants permission for pre-implantation 
 diagnosis only on a case by case basis. And it 
points out that 80% of Britons are opposed to 
choosing the sex of babies without a medical 
reason. ◆
