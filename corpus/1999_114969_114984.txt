d o m i n ated city gove rnment last month. The tax
has been introduced under World Bank pressure in
r e t u rn for loans to help refurbish the city’s
hydrological infrastructure.
The new tax will be applied to all bu i l d i n g s
four or more storeys high—the kind of residential
buildings popular amongst the middle class. It will
in effect cover an extra 10 per cent of city residents
and will hopefully raise $5 million a ye a r , helping to
plug the municipal government’s $17.5 million a
year water systems budget deficit. Currently, only
f i ve per cent of domestic users pay water tax.
Commercial users account for 95 per cent of the
annual $2.4 million now raised from the water tax.
A cutback
on public taps
M e a n w h i l e , to cut down on waste due to leakage
through antiquated pipes, the gove rnment will close
600 of the 12,000 public water taps. For Calcutta’s
1.2 million poor, these public taps are the only
form of access to water. The cutback on taps has
raised serious concern among slum and pavement
dwellers. “Today I have to wait for hours to get a
bucket of water. If they close the tap in my slum
where shall I go?” asks Mohammed Saleem, who
lives in Entally slum in east Calcutta.
The gove rnment reckons that the public’s
c riticism of the water tax is the price it has to pay for
the water system to be improve d . In return for its
tough tax reform s , the gove rnment hopes to get
World Bank help to revamp the city’s entire water and
s e werage system. C u rrently the World Bank is
u n d e rtaking a $ 2.5 million feasibility study for a wat e r
systems overhaul which could cost $200 million.
H o p e f u l l y, the new tax revenues will help the city
i m p r ove water quality as well as quantity. “It is
unsafe to drink water directly from the pipes in
Calcutta,” says Arindam Ghosh, a scientist at the
N ational Environmental Engi n e e ring Research
Institute. According to Ghosh, the existing water
t r e atment plants in the city cannot remove
hazardous chemicals dissolved in the water, taken
directly from the heavily polluted Ganges. As a
result, water-borne diseases are common. n

Will the poor

The travails of Das and Mukherjee in their daily
