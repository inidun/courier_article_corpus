THE CITY OF TEN THOUSAND
by Louis Frédéric
V,_ ENICE is falling prey to the
harsh fate awaiting all old cities. It is
slowly dying of precisely those things
it gives life to. The past is being
sacrificed to the present to satisfy the
requirements of modern life. In place
of XVIth century Venice, the Venice
Sansovino knew with its orchards and
kitchen-gardens, Venice is already
little more than a heterogeneous
collection of lovely buildings, slums,
factories in other words, a mixture
of the sublime and the hideous.
Unless we are watchful, the
ceaseless struggle nature wages
against the works of men looks like
leaning in the former's favour and
depriving mankind soon of part of his
artistic and cultural heritage.
On a site that was unhealthy at the
outset' but admirably well-protected,
lying between sky and sea, arose' the
most harmonious artistic and archi¬
tectural entity in existence, even
though this underlying unity may not
be immediately apparent at all levels
to the hurried traveller.
There is a critical tradition which
complacently stresses the variety to
be found in Venetian architecture.
The fact that whole dynasties ' of
sculptors and builders, such as the
Bons or the Lombardis, linked their
genius- and combined . their craft
traditions when working in the white
stone of Istria or in marble, and that
certain complete units were left to
the care of a single creative genius
such as Sansovino, who designed the
Piazzetta di San Marco at the
beginning of the XVIth century is not
adequate to explain the profound unity
of Venice.

point near the granite pillars of the

Many Venetian sculptors and craftsmen

breakwater, loved to read all about
him "those stone chronicles recorded
by time and the arts" and to identify
at a glance' nine centuries of archi¬
tecture to which all the regions of
Italy had contributed.
And, indeed, Venetian architecture
may be seen as being made up solely
of compromises, of an accumulation of
elements from the Italian, Arabic,
Byzantine, Gothic, Renaissance and
Baroque styles. But therein lies the
miracle; Venice as a .whole has
succeeded in reconciling the apparent
contradictions in these various styles.
The disparity, which is particularly
noticeable in the uneven lines of the
façades, vanishes in the overall
prevailing light and in the reflexions
of the canal waters that flow beside
palaces and houses; a rhythmic
repetition of a single theme which, in
terms of the city as a whole, restores
the unity which may not be found in
buildings taken singly.
This basic pattern, founded on three
constantly recurring elements the rio,
the ponte, and the calle (1) by
repeating itself over and over and
spreading concentrically out from the
original nucleus of the Rialto bridge,
has conditioned the shape of Venice,
and is further emphasized and made
more harmonious by restrictions on
the height of buildings. This pattern
is admirably fitted to the omnipresent
element of water with the 180 canals
spanned by 378 bridges. Nowhere
else in the world is the marriage of
stone, sky and water so pronounced.
Whether you are entering the
Palazzo Ducale, the Ca d'Oro, a little
church or an old house, the impression
is the same, though naturally on
differing scales. One feels that if a
carving were missing from a façade,
a fresco from a church, or a balustrade
from a house, we should sorely feel
the loss, for the absence of a single
detail, however small, would destroy
that unity that delights us.
And the same applies to the interior
decoration, which goes, logically and
inevitably, hand in hand with the
outside, and is indispensable to the

artistic balance of the city. Inside we
have a series of frescos covering walls
and ceilings, stucco motifs along the
overhang of upper storeys, trompe-
I'ceil painting carrying on where stone
architecture leaves off, works of
Veronese at San Sebastiano, Tintoretto
at the Scuola di San Rocco, Tiepolo
at La Pietà and the Gesuati, religious
paintings as well as decorative friezes
all this is subordinate to the
architectural effect and, like it, has
a unity and coherence that springs
from its very diversity.
Spiritual heir to the San Marco
mosaics, the interior decoration of the
buildings has always retained some¬
thing of the ornamental role it had
played from the start. This goes back
to the rich splendour of the Venetian-
Byzantine style, with its brilliant
display of marble and gold, for the
Venetians held the view that painting
should be "above all decorative, a
thing for the eye, an expanse of colour
on the wall," as English novelist and
critic Walter Pater said.
This decoration emphasizes the
continuity in the overall look of Venice.
Even the pieces of interior decorative
art statues, easel-paintings, pyxes or
lecterns form an integral part of the
buildings to which centuries of
common history have indissolubly
associated them.
The Venetians have, from the earliest
times, been concerned with the moods
of the lagoon and the periodic
variations in the level of its waters.
However, as time passes, the cumu¬
lative effects of high water result
in increasingly great disasters with
each successive "flood." Sooner or
later, they are bound to affect the very
existence of Venice.
Humidity, which was further in¬
creased and became more penetrating
as a consequence of the "high water"
of November 4, 1966, is directly or
indirectly affecting all Venice's works
of art. In the church of San
Sebastiano, containing masterpieces of
Veronese, seepage has occurred
through the walls up to more than

twelve feet above the paving, as well
as in the church of the Terese.
The fate of works of art and the
future of architectural structures are
further threatened by the eroding
action of the canal waters which are
laying the foundations of buildings
bare and submitting the walls to slight
but continual vibrations. The living
organisms in the water eat away at
the piles: salt, which is a strong
corrosive, attacks all stonework and is
now gradually wearing down what
was once raised thanks to the pros¬
perity of the salt industry. Salt crusts
that form on the surface of façades,
of murals, and of easel-paintings, are
a constant worry to curators. But this
is not the only threat to Venice's art.
As in all modern cities, there is a
great deal of atmospheric pollution,
which causes "stone disease" and
affects pictures badly. We need only
reflect that each year, simply in
the nearby small industrial town
of Marghera, the quantity of fuel
burned releases over 15,000 tons of
concentrated sulphuric acid into the
atmosphere, from which it returns in
the form of rain.
Again, while the pigeons are one
of the attractions of the Piazza San
Marco, they are also a mortal danger
to the city's works of art. Without
mentioning the damage caused by their
droppings to façades and sculptures,
these droppings have throughout the
years accumulated dangerously in the
roof timbers of the palaces, whose
floors are sagging beneath the weight
of layers of guano inches thick. At
San Moise, whose roof was blown off
by the high winds that accompanied
the floods in November 1966, more
than ten hundredweight of droppings
were found on the back of Nicolo
Bambini's "Moses and the Eternal
Father" when the picture was taken
from the ceiling for restoration.
These are the more obvious kinds
of damage that anybody can see.
Although their importance should not
be underestimated, they should not
cause us to overlook a number of

WHEN
TITIAN
PAINTED
THE WALLS
Venice at the peak of
its wealth and renown
could call on the
greatest artists to
embellish its palatial
buildings. Master
painters such as Titian,
Giorgone and Veronese
did not consider it
beneath them to
decorate the outside
walls of these noble
structures. But today
most of these outdoor
paintings are damaged
or completely effaced.
Atmospheric pollution
is increasingly
responsible for their
deterioration (15,000
tons of sulphuric acid
are showered over
Venice annually by
factories at nearby
Marghera). This 16th
century work by Titian
in the courtyard of the
Fondaco dei Tedeschi
was removed for
preservation in 1967.
Forty years earlier it
could have been saved

In Venice nothing is spared, not
even the bronze horses above the
central entrance of the basilica of San
Marco. We need only mention certain
names, representative of many other
similar cases of diseases affecting
the whole of Venice:
there are cracks in the Porta
dei Fion of the basilica and the
columns and capitals are liable to
collapse any day;
the Contarini column (XVIIth
century) on Murano is crumbling;
the Gothic sculptures of the
Frari are weathering as a result of
atmospheric corrosion and are dis¬
appearing beneath pigeon droppings;
mould is growing on the mural
paintings (by Fabio Canal) in the
church of San Martino di Castello;
the overhanging triptych and
the angels of the Tulho Lombardo
altar (late XVth century) and the
panelling in the chapels are falling
into decay;
the paintings displayed in church
sacristies are blackened and in a
pitiable state:
The San Canciano altar-place,
Giovanni Bellini's "Madonna" (1507),
the "Virgin Enthroned" by Negroponte
(c. 1450), the "Saint Nicolas in Glory"
at San Giovanni in Bragora (XVth
century), the "Scene from the Hebrew
Passover" by Pietro Malombra and
Antonio Vassilacchi (I'Aliense, XVth
century) at San Pietro di Castello, the
painted ceiling by Antonio Fumiani
(some thirty years' work, from 1680
to 1704) at San Pantaleone, the paint¬
ings of Veronese at the Palazzo
Trevisano, on Murano, those of Tie-
polo, the San Sebastiano frescos.
the monumental sculptures of
the Salute are liable to fall at any
moment (one broke away in 1966);
the Ca d'Oro, Santa Maria dei
Miracoli (late XVth century), the
church of the Terese...
And the list is far from complete:
there are more than. 10,000 mon¬
uments and works of art in Venice
classified as being of historic interest.
Each of these sets a problem of its
own sometimes several at once
which must be solved. Nowhere else
in the world is there such a high
concentration of masterpieces or
works characteristic of a particular
period or style.
Behind the mask of its charming
façades, Venice, when examined
closely, is severely disfigured. Cor¬
rosion and pollution which may either
have begun long ago (when the city
was founded in fact) or have started
recently, and now often progressing
at an alarming rate, are attacking the
city's walls and decorative elements.
The unfortunate thing about Venice
is that it contains all the conditions
bound to bring about rapid and ines¬
capable decay. Venice is gradually
subsiding into the mud of its lagoon.
Protected from the sea as it is, by
its offshore bars, this would not be
too serious: a thousand years from
now Venice would still be afloat.
But even so the hydrographical be¬
haviour of the lagoon must be
watched and not disturbed by breach¬
ing the bars without proper precaut¬
ions (as has already been done for the
improvement of the Malamocco
channel) and an attempt should be
made simultaneously to lower the
water level by erecting dams.
A, S regards structural decay
and the diseases of stone, the causes
have been scientifically identified and
the appropriate treatment is known.
We have learnt how to fight the for¬
midable "thiobacillus" and the nitri¬
fying bacteria, how to treat the
leprosy of marble and granite, how
to clean and protect paintings and
how to dry and restore frescos.
And yet in spite of that, each year
Venice loses 6 per cent of its marble
works, 5 per cent of its frescos, 3 per
cent of its canvas paintings and
2 per cent of its wood paintings.
This is an enormous proportion. At
this rate, in thirty years' time there
will remain barely half of what makes
present-day Venice a "peerless gem."
This does not include libraries, arch¬
ives and craft products or church
collections, which are disappearing at
a similar rate.
The preservation and restoration of
all Venice's works of art set many
problems for experts, whether archi¬
tects, hydrographers or town-planners.
Many works have already been saved
(canvases have been removed from
their supports, rolled and restored,
frescos have been dried, houses
consolidated, and so on) by the
Departments of Monuments and Fine
Arts. But there is still an immense
amount of work to be done: more
than 450 palaces or old houses, more
than 200 places of worship and
churches are in jeopardy.
Apart from the purely technical
aspects of saving this artistic and
cultural heritage, there are problems
of finance, expropriation, rehousing,
taxation, town-planning and admin¬
istration.
Venice, however, has no wish to
be merely a museum. Its population
is not made up solely of aesthetes
and museum curators. The needs of
modern life call for constant improve¬
ments in housing, in the setting up
of industries (to provide work for the
people and to keep the city alive),
in transport and communications.
This museum-city, the "città nobi-
lissima e singolare" of Sansovino,
does not wish to be behind the times.
There can be only one answer to the
proposed alternative of saving the
stones or saving the inhabitants:
Venice must remain true to itself and
develop without disowning its past.
Venice without its inhabitants would
no longer be Venice. Venice without
its monuments and its setting would
no longer be Venice. Neither alter¬
native is acceptable. But how can
its heritage be saved while respecting
the requirements of development?
This is the greatest and most impor¬
tant problem for Venice to overcome.
Looked at from a narrow viewpoint,
the problems that Venice has to face
might appear to be a painful accu¬
mulation of natural factors and of
human failings. Yet in fact they are
simply the result of the gradual evol¬
ution of an environment. Man's action
takes place against the background of
this evolution. To attempt to solve
these problems, all the elements of
Venetian life must be analyzed, and
the skills of specialists in all the
necessary branches be combined
with those of the Venetian experts.
But co-operation is not only of value
for the purposes of study and
research: it is also essential in
reaching decisions and in making use
of the resources made available.
Imagination will likewise be needed,
for new techniques will have to be
found: techniques to harness the
currents without letting the lagoon
silt up; to kill the micro-organisms in
the water without poisoning it; to
counteract the effects of storms
without disfiguring the city or the site;
to consolidate Venice without having
to demolish and then rebuild it; to
preserve it for dreamers without there¬
by losing touch with reality. This
will need something more than know¬
ledge or imagination it will require 0 |
positive genius. It would be too much '
to expect this from one man or even
from a single group of experts.

10,000 MASTERPIECES (Continued)
More than 4,000 square metres of the domes, vaults and walls of
St. Mark's Cathedral are covered by brilliant mosaics (see also
pages 10 and 11). Mosaics, some dating from the early 11th century,
are the dominating form of decoration throughout, picturing the story
of the Creation, the fall of man and the Redemption, the miracles of
Christ and the legends of the saints, all enshrined in a glowing
golden background.
Nor is it any use saving marbles
and frescos if they are condemned to
disappear beneath the waters; nor
building sluices without first setting
up a meteorological station able to
forecast squalls and to close the
gates; nor damming the approaches
to the lagoon without also building
sewers; nor reinforcing foundations if
walls are allowed to collapse; nor
improving the housing without provid¬
ing adequate communications; nor
building an underground railway sys¬
tem if nobody wants any longer to
come to Venice the Venetians be¬
cause they find the city uninhabitable
and old-fashioned, others because it
has been "over-renovated."
If the choice of measures is left
solely to curators, they would, no
doubt, consider it safer to turn the
historical centre into a museum, which
will mean the end of Venice, since
Venice, for those who love it, is not
a lifeless record of a vanished civiliz¬
ation but a place where they like to
come and live out their dreams. If,
on the other hand, the choice is left
to the technocrats, they will rely on
"decision theory" and choose the
most economically viable solution.
And they may not be too far wrong,
either, if it costs a fortune to build
dikes, and Venice does not have, or
is unable to raise the necessary
money. Loans are made only to the
rich. The ancient city of Venice must
be able to recover its former prosper¬
ity if is to avoid the risk of being
abandoned to its fate.
Modern constructions must not be
condemned, however sacrilegious they
are, if they bring prosperity to Venice.
Modem civilization is without doubt
disturbing the behaviour of the lagoon
itself, poisoning the water, filling the
air with smoke and spoiling the beauty
of the site. ' But it is also providing
the resources necessary to remedy
the very damage it causes, though
perhaps not in the immediate future,
or even perfectly. But the situation is
the same the whole world over.
Saving Venice means keeping it
intact for the happiness of the men
of our time, to ensure that the men
of the future can, in their turn, dream;
it does not mean relegating it to the
realm of mythology.
