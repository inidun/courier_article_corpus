Alongside state-run radio and large-
scale private broadcasting networks
there is another world of community
radio stations, owned, run and editorially
controlled by the public they serve.These
“alternative” radio stations may not have
a range beyond the slum, village or island
from which they broadcast. Many of them
are shoestring operations staffed by local
volunteers.
Unlike commercial radio, which makes
money from adve rt i s i n g, community radio
s t ations are not profit - o ri e n t e d — t h o u g h
sometimes they accept a little adve rt i s i n g
in order to surv i ve .They are there to serve
the local populat i o n . Because of their
c o n t ri bution to a culture of peace and the
gr owth of democracy, they are making
h e a d way on eve ry continent.
With the development of democrat i c
m ovements and the emergence of new
pri vate and public pressure gr o u p s , c o m-
munity radio has taken root all over the
wo r l d , though on different scales and with
d i f f e ring effects. This is largely due to new
and better technical equipment, c h e a p e r
FM transmitters and the gradual disappea-
rance of public broadcasting monopolies.
When recognized by the gove rn m e n t
and protected by law—as in the United
S t at e s ,Australia and Canada, for example—
they coexist uncontentiously with com-
mercial stat i o n s. A number of European
c o u n t ries have followed the example of
F r a n c e , where the law was changed in 1982
to legalize “ p i r at e ” or “ f r e e ” radio stat i o n s.
In Africa and Asia, the growth of local
radio has been spectacular.The most stri-
king case is South Africa where, accor-
ding to the Media Institute of South
Africa (MISA), community broadcasting
has great potential. On these continents
community radio is helping to roll back
illiteracy, promote education and provide
information about health, the environ-
ment, farming, democracy and hot issues
like landmines. But in one part of the
world, Latin America, it is under attack.
Fewer voices
Community radio stations involved in
e d u c ational broadcasting or speaking out
for trade unions, u n i ve rsities or indigenous
peoples have been operating in Latin A m e-
rica for more than half a century. “They’ve
been used to announce all kinds of things,
from prices down at the local market to
s o m e o n e ’s horse that has gone astray,” s ay s
José Ignacio López Vigil,the Latin Ameri-
can and Caribbean representat i ve of the
World A s s o c i ation of Community Radio
B r o a d c a s t e rs (AMARC). “ T h e y ’ ve also
taught thousands of people to read and
thousands more how to figure out where
their employe rs have cheated them of their
wa g e s. T h e y ’ ve helped to make sure that
children were va c c i n ated and they’ve
encouraged ordinary people to speak up.”
There are probably more than 2,000
community radio stations broadcasting in
Latin America; 400 of them are affiliated
to AMARC, twice as many as three years

ago. But while their number keeps on
growing, the stations are having problems
obtaining legal recognition.
Until recently, Latin America’s local
radio stations coexisted with commercial
stations without too much trouble. But
the concentration of the media over the
past few years has tended to push non-
profit radio and smaller stations in gene-
ral out of the picture.This has inevitably
led to fewer voices being heard on the air.
Most of Latin A m e ri c a ’s community radio
s t ations are waiting to be assigned a fixe d
f r e q u e n cy or else official permission to broad-
c a s t . H owe ver they are not defined by their
legal status but by their goals.Whether regi s-
tered as public or pri vate companies (linked
to unive rs i t i e s ,r e gions or tow n s ) , their defin i n g
f e ature is that they are non-profit organizat i o n s
without any political axe to gri n d .
Strong programmes,
weak transmitters
The fact that they are linked to the local
community does not necessarily mean they
are small or ill equipped. In fact existing sta-
tions are trying to upgrade their technical
r e s o u r c e s , and new ones, such as Radio Tri-
nidad FM in Pa r a g u ay, t ry to start up with the
best possible fa c i l i t i e s. M a ny stations have
weak transmitters but make up for it by
h aving computers in the newsroom. S o m e
e ven broadcast via the Intern e t .
Nor does their community spirit mean
that they put out boring programmes with
poor-quality sound.The kind of intermi-
nable discussions and across-the-block
denunciations that characterized commu-
nity radio in its early days has given way
to more open-minded and witty pro-
grammes which cover all aspects of life.
In Europe a distinction has always been
made between profit - o riented commercial
radio and public-service broadcasting desi-
gned to play a socio-cultural role.In Latin
A m e ri c a ,h owe ve r , this distinction has been
b l u rred because stat e - owned radio and tele-
vision stations have been largely used as
political tools and have had little or no
social or cultural value.
In El Salvador, a recent telecommuni-
cations law gave clear advantage to profi-
table private firms and established regula-
tions which favour big capital, to the extent
t h at even the country ’s second biggest tele-
vision stat i o n , which is pri vat e , was in
danger of closing down.In Uruguay, radio
operating licences have to be approved by
the defence ministry, and broadcasters
without a licence risk a prison sentence. I n
Chile,the power of a transmitter is limited
to one watt. In Brazil and Argentina, new
l e gi s l ation is looming which would concen-
t r ate radio ow n e rship even further and thus
narrow the public’s choice.
In Pe ru , one of the few countries in
L atin A m e rica where community radio sta-
tions can operate without too many legal
p r o b l e m s , a new law passed in March 1998
banned non-profit stations from accepting
even the very small amount of advertising
which could ensure their surv i va l . S i n c e
they receive no state subsidy or support,
they are doomed to close, and this means
that several sources of criticism of the pre-
sent government will fall silent.
Closing doors
Their staff have appealed in vain to
the national ombudsman (D e fensor del
Pueblo), and press freedom officials of the
O r g a n i z ation of A m e rican States have
approached the government without suc-
cess. If the law is applied, dozens of sta-
tions may have to shut down.
One of them is Radio Cutivalú, which
has about 400,000 listeners in the north
of the country and is the region’s main
medium-wave station.The station, which
is named after a pre-Inca Indian leader,
won a United Nations prize last year for
its “successful efforts to fight poverty”.

Most of Latin America’s
community radio stations
are waiting to be assigned
a fixed frequency or
official permission to
broadcast

It is also the only station attached to
Propuesta Regi o n a l, a “ d e velopment foru m ”
whose participants include professional,
university and religious associations inde-
pendent of the gove rn m e n t . It played a key
role in helping the population survive the
rains and flooding brought by the El Niño
weather phenomenon.
L i s t e n e rs say their favo u rite pro-
grammes are the station’s competitions to
encourage writing inspired by local tales
and legends, which have attracted more
than 1,300 amateur writers from towns
all over northern Peru. Equally popular
are regional song festivals sponsored by
Panasonic and other firms, which give
dozens of self-taught authors and compo-
sers a hearing they would never have
enjoyed on commercial stations.
Cutivalú is not the only Peruvian radio
station whose future hangs in the balance.
The same goes for Radio Marañón, which
broadcasts from Ja é n , in the A m a z o n
region.At the other end of the country, in
Puno, near the Bolivian border, Radio
Onda Azul is in danger of losing its net-
work of rural correspondents because it
can no longer afford to pay them.
All these laws violate constitutional
rights and go against current internatio-
nal guarantees of freedom of expression.
Community radio stations, which are by
definition poor, have taken all kinds of
legal steps to defend themselve s. I n
Argentina and Paraguay, they have mana-
ged to survive because they have won
their case. In Ecuador, they successfully
challenged a law before the country’s
constitutional court. Ombudsmen in El
Salvador and Peru have made strong sta-
tements defending the stations’ rights.
Fair shares
on the air
What is at stake in Latin America is
very clear. Will the airwaves, which are
part of overall human heritage, be mono-
polized by commercial firms, or will be
they also be available, as they are everyw-
here else in the world, to communities,
educational groups and non-profit orga-
nizations, in other words to the full spec-
trum of civil society exercising its right to
free expression?
What lies ahead for community radio
stations? They defend the right to free
speech, help to create the diversity of opi-
nion which is an essential feature of
democracy, and encourage local develop-
ment,a culture of peace, the protection of
the environment and other civic causes
which cannot be measured in terms of
financial gain.
The history of the right to speak on
the air began at the beginning of the cen-
tury. Its defenders around the world have
had to wage many struggles and make
many sacrifices. Today it is more impor-
tant than ever to ensure there is room for
everyone on the airwaves. n
