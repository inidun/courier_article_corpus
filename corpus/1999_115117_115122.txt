A new d e a l for 
the poor
Collapsing national economies, natural disasters and political storms have
dragged millions of people below the poverty line in the 1990s. Meanwhile, in
many parts of the world, vast proportions of the population have been living
in misery for years without any solutions yet in sight. Against such a
backdrop, a new approach is emerging on ways to fight poverty. No longer
are open markets, government or the poor seen separately as the key to
eradicating poverty. Instead, a dominant view these days is that all three
need to be brought together in a concerted attack. In short, a new deal is
being offered to help the world’s poor. But is it enough? 
Our dossier looks at the prospects and problems in the three-pronged battle
against poverty.

In a west Bucharest public housing estate that
has seen better days, Liliana tries to prepare a
casserole for dinner.“But without meat.Meat
would be a luxury,” s ays the 41-year-old high school
t e a c h e r , who was once middle class but now counts
h e rself amongst Romania’s “new poor”, p a rt of the
fallout from the collapse of the state in the former
Eastern bloc.
Half way around the wo r l d , in Ja k a rt a , w h e r e
l u x u ry cars , designer labels and sky-high aspira-
tions once symbolized an economic boom, a recent
financial crisis has ove rnight deflated the economy
and plunged huge swaths of Indonesian society into
p ove rt y. In the middle-class Bumi Serpong Damai
housing complex, for example, children scave n g e
through the garbage looking for used bottles and old
n e w s p a p e rs , while adults often take to more extreme
m e a n s. “They are easily tempted to steal,” s ays a
s e c u rity guard at the complex.
M e a n w h i l e , in the fishing village of Cabique
on the shores of the Caribbean in southeastern
H a i t i , an entire community is sinking steadily deeper

into poverty as a result of environmental misma-
n a g e m e n t .D e f o r e s t ation means that the pounding
tropical rainstorms break up the earth and sweep
into the sea tonnes of sole which choke the coral
where the fish feed. As a result, the fish that once
supplied a livelihood for this village have moved on.
“It’s been 10 years now that I’ve done absolutely
nothing because there’s nothing to do here,” says
V i c t o r , 3 5 , a former soldier and a father of two
children,who picks up spare cash working in local
harvests.
E l s e w h e r e ,m a ny are locked in a vicious circle of
poverty that has existed for generations and seems
likely to pers i s t . In the village of Mimetala, 30 kms
from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, 80-year-old
M a rie Biloa has been unable to work since a car acci-
dent 15 ye a rs ago. There is no state aid for the
u n e m p l oye d , but she did receive a payout from a pri-
vate insurance company.When her son-in-law stole
t h at money and ran off, she was left without a
means of support . To d ay Biloa dreams of going
back into her former business of selling snacks at a
street stall, but she lacks the $18 needed as a start-
up investment. Neither can the rest of her family
help. Biloa’s daughter has been abandoned by her
h u s b a n d .B i l o a ’s 20-year-old grandson is ill, with a
sickness that has not yet been diagnosed because the
family cannot afford to take him to hospital for
tests. And so Biloa is forced to exist on handouts
from villagers while a local charity gi ves her medical
help free of charge.
Like a disease that has gone into remission bu t
l ater strikes back with a ve n g e a n c e ,p ove rty has ove r
recent ye a rs resurged in places that once seemed to
be on the mend. As the Romanian, Indonesian and
Haitian vignettes illustrat e , the root causes range
from a political vacuum left in the wake of form e r l y
a u t h o ri t a rian regi m e s , to the collapse of fin a n c i a l
markets that once seemed to be the surest remedy for
p ove rt y, to natural disaster and environmental mis-
m a n a g e m e n t .The impact of these fa c t o rs has been
b r e at h t a k i n g : in the last two ye a rs alone, tens of mil-
lions of persons have been added to the lists of the
wo r l d ’s poor in Southeast A s i a . In the Fo rmer Sov i e t
Union and Eastern Europe, the number of poor has
swelled by some 170 million during this decade.
Meanwhile,as in the case of Biloa, among vast
stretches of humanity poverty lingers as it has for
decades without any immediate hope of a cure.
But how can pove rty be alleviated? In the 1980s,
the so-called “ Washington consensus”—an approach
built around the tri c k l e - d own economics of multi-
l ateral lending institutions headquartered in the U. S .
c a p i t a l — s aw the market as the saviour of the poor.B y
e n s u ring the efficient functioning of markets, e c o-
nomies would flo u rish and eventually wealth wo u l d
make its way down to the impove ri s h e d .T h at at
least was the theory. H owe ve r , markets have prove n
to be fickle fri e n d s.
In our special focus on poverty, Rubens Recu-
p e r o, S e c r e t a ry-General of the UN Conference on
Trade and Development, looks in greater detail at
an emerging new consensus on tackling pove rt y
(page 20). No one pretends to have all the ans-
we rs , but there does seem to be general agr e e m e n t
t h at a multi-faceted approach is vital: m a r k e t s ,
governments and poor people themselves need to
work in concert to find solutions to poverty.
Our section on the market shows that trade
and capital flows are still seen as vital ingredients in
the fight against pove rty but are not panaceas.
Poverty is like a disease that has
gone into remission but later
s t r i kes back with a vengeance
The human
development index
Traditional economic indicators
such as per capita gross national
product, give an incomplete idea
of the real socio-economic
conditions in a country, and to
provide a fuller picture the United
Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) created the human
development index (HDI) in 1990.
The HDI takes into account three
types of data:life expectancy;
educational attainment (adult
literacy and combined primary,
secondary and tertiary
enrolment); and standard of living
measured by real purchasing
power.
The index is a scale between
1 (the highest) and 0 (the
lowest).High human
development is regarded as
comprising HDI values of 0.8 and
above;medium comprising values
of 0.5 to 0.799;and low
comprising values below 0.5
Some 1.3 billion people
l i ve on less than $1 a
day and almost 3
billion on less than $2
a day.Almost 11% of
the inhabitants of the
i n d u s t ri a l i zed countri e s
l i ve on less than $11.4
d o l l a rs a day.*

A new deal for the poor
I n d e e d , the financial crisis in Southeast Asia (pages
23 and 24) has demonstrated that faith in eco-
nomic growth as a way out of poverty has led to
neglect of safety net-building to help the poor
during times of trouble.
Pa rt two of this dossier demonstrat e s , by looking
at the United States, the former Soviet bloc and
Tunisia (pages 24 to 31), under what circumstances
the state can play a constru c t i ve role in the fight on
p ove rt y, and why in some cases the state has prove n
i n e f f e c t i ve in finding solutions.The theme ru n n i n g
through this section is that the state must play a vital
part in the war on poverty, knowing when to inter-
vene and when to stand aside.
F i n a l l y, in recent ye a rs analysts, politicians and
n o n - g ove rnment aid organizations have increa-
singly discovered that poor people may themselve s
possess analytic and other abilities that can be ins-
trumental in grappling with poverty (pages 32 to
3 6 ) . Making use of the skills and cultural at t ri bu t e s
of the poor is proving to be much more important
than was imagined a decade ago. But  local cultures
can also be an impediment to improvement. n
