TUBERCULOSIS
Still 3 million
deaths a year
"At least 15 million people suffer from infectious
tuberculosis today. The disease still claims more
than three million lives each year... in nearly all
economically-developed countries, the number of
sufferers has not declined as nearly as rapidly as
the number of deaths, and tuberculosis remains a
grave problem. In the world as a whole, between
two and three million new cases occur each year..."
These warning words by Dr. M.G. Candau, Director-
General of the World Health Organization, explain
why the theme chosen for World Health Day 1964
(April 7) is "No Truce for Tuberculosis". On the
following pages The Unesco Courier retraces
the long history of tuberculosis and the efforts
to find curative and preventative medicines. Also
described are the powerful new drugs and infection
control methods which can be used to defeat tuber¬
culosis and eliminate it as a public health problem.
Because, as Dr. Candau has also pointed out, "for
the first time in man's history we now possess
effective weapons with which to fight tuberculosis."
Five years ago Tunisian doctors met in the
Public Health Office, one of the government
ministries in the Kasbah at Tunis (right) to plan
a war on tuberculosis. As a prologue to this
national campaign, a pilot experiment into
the use of drugs for preventative treatment
was carried out jointly by the Tunisian Govern¬
ment and WHO. The test zone was the Djebel
Lahmar (below) a community of 25,000
people whose homes are one-storey mud
dwellings grouped on the outskirts of Tunis.
