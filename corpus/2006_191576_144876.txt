                     the congo river, whose flow is the greatest in the world after the amazon, 
       possesses an exceptional hydroelectric potential for the democratic republic of the congo (drc). 
                 While estimates boast that it could satisfy the electrical needs of the entire african continent, 
       the access rate for inhabitants in the drc is paradoxically one of the lowest in the world.  
the PromiSe 
of the riVer congo
ne must simply have a look from 
the banks of the river wharf or 
“beach” in the country’s capital 
Kinshasa to capture the power of 
the river that irrigates the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo. In 
testimony to the strengh of Congo 
River, the speeding current of mud-
dy water sweeps along tree-trunks 
and forms whirlpools of foam, her-
alding the first rapids downstream 
of the capital. 
This force is also apparent in 
figures: with an average flow of over 
40,000 m3/s, it is an exceptional 
source of energy. It is estimated 
that this river represents around 
13 % of the world’s hydroelectric 
potential, and its force alone could 
satisfy the electricity requirements 
of the entire African continent. 
In theory, this is its potential. The 
paradox is that electricity con-
sumption in the RDC is one of 
the lowest in the world. The rate 
of households with access to 
Inga and its rapids.

“... rapids, riparian vegetation 
and wetlands 
can all disappear 
when river flow 
is altered by damming.”
Second UN World Water Report

electricity is less than 6%, one of 
the lowest levels in sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
Yet infrastructure does exist. Ex-
isting power sites (named Inga I 
and II) are situated on the lower 
reaches of the river, around 400 
kilometres from the capital. These 
sites were brought into operation 
in 1972 and 1982, and have the 
potential to supply electricity to a 
large part of the region. 
However, in many rural areas of 
the country today, petrol genera-
tors are still the only source of elec-
tricity. At nightfall, it is not rare for 
some popular districts of Kinshasa 
to be plunged into darkness, forc-
ing the residents to use candles or 
hurricane lamps.
Ageing 
installations
It must be said that at first, priority 
was given to the mining industry to 
the detriment of households. Ray-
mond Chikuru, who is an expert at 
the Ministry of Energy, states that 
‘electrical energy was above all de-
veloped to facilitate mining and the 
transformation of mineral ores’. 
There is another problem: these 
installations operate at a very slow 
pace. They are dilapidated and suf-
fer from a serious lack of mainte-
nance. There is also a flagrant lack 
of spare parts, and breakdowns are 
commonplace. Professor Laurent 
Kitoko (University of Kinshasa), 
Director of Planning and Devel-
opment at the Societe nationale 
d’électricité (SNEL), blames these 
shortcomings on the ‘budget-de-
vouring nature’ of the hydroelectric 
industry. 
The installations should have 
been rehabilitated in the 1990s, 
but the country was unable to 
meet the cost of the work, which 
was estimated at 15 million dollars 
for each of the two turbines in Inga 
I and II. The war that ravaged the 
DRC in the late 1990s, and led to 
the suspension of international co-
operation, only worsened the situ-
ation.
The return to peace in the country 
and the resumption of international 
cooperation, has brought new de-
velopment projects. There is now 
a plan to renovate Inga I and II and 
build a third dam.
A huge project
 The final stage in the development 
plan is “Grand Inga”, an enormous 
dam that will harness the entire 
flow of the river, and in turn sup-
ply a large part of Southern Africa 
(and even some countries in 
Southern Europe) with electrical 
energy in ten years’ time. The esti-
mated 50 billion dollars cost would 
have to be covered by international 
funding (the World Bank, the Afri-
can Development Bank, etc.), and 
by private partners, like Eksom, 
the South African electricity utility 
company. 
Grand Inga could become the 
cornerstone of electrical produc-
tion on the continent, and give ex-
ceptional leverage to the country’s 
economy, as long it also benefits 
its inhabitants. 
Voices are already being raised 
to question this project, especially 
among environmental watchdogs. 
‘One big unknown is the effect 
on fisheries and the river ecol-
ogy’, says the Uruguayan associa-
tion World Rainforest Movement 
(WRM), in a December 2003 
document (1). WRM especially 
fears that fish migration will be in-
terrupted, and that such a dam will, 
in the long run, damage silt flows, 
a phenomenon crucial to the river’s 
ecosystem.
