The old town of Banská Stiavnica,
in the heart of the Carpathian mountains, was
once a nucleus of the European mining industry.
Its remarkable architectural and technological
monuments earned it a place on the World
Heritage List in 1993.
Why visit an old mining
I town? I imagined houses
lined up in rows like matchboxes,
a handful of dull office buildings,
a soulless school, an unexceptional
church and a few scrawny dogs.
Emile Zola came to mind. What
was the point? Slovakia, a moun¬
tainous country covering 49,000
square kilometres in the heart of
Central Europe, has more than 1 50
medieval fortresses, Romanesque
chapels and Gothic cathedrals,
Renaissance palaces and Baroque
residences; I was much more inter¬
ested in these. Yet when I finally
made up my mind to head down a
road winding through forests and
between emerald-green lakes, I
was completely taken aback when
I suddenly beheld a little archi¬
tectural jewel cradled in the hills.
This was the once-flourishing town
of ISanská Stiavnica.
Legend has it that a goatherd
guarding his flock one day saw a
lizard covered in flakes of gold
and immediately spread the news
of this extraordinary sight. At
that time the local people lacked
the technical skills and resources
necessary for extracting the gold
and silver buried deep in the,
mountain, and the mines, some of
which were on the surface, were
probably first worked by the Celts
a century or two before the mod¬
ern era. The Celts even minted
coins known as biatecs, weighing
16 grams each. A large number of
these have been found at some fif¬
teen sites, especially in the coun¬
try's western regions. The Slavs,
who arrived in the region later,
continued extracting the precious
metals and traded in them.
A twelfth-century document
shows that the Banská Stiavnica
region, in Slovakia's heartland,
was known as the "land of min¬
ers". After having settled in the
Carpathian Mountains for over a
century, the Hungarians incorpo¬
rated Banská Stiavnica into then-
kingdom, which eventually
extended to the shores of the
Adriatic. They were quick to
grasp the benefits they could reap
from mining the rich veins of gold,
silver and copper that stretched
for kilometre after kilometre.
In order to work the mines
intensively, they brought in Ger¬
man settlers, whose expertise in
the field was famed throughout
Europe. To make sure they
stayed, King Bela IV allowed
them a series of privileges, espe¬
cially the freedom to trade, which
he set out in 1238 in a special
charter granted to Banská. A few
years later, when the area was dev¬
astated by the Mongols, the Ger¬
man and Slovak inhabitants were
given permission to build fortifi¬
cations to protect themselves from
future attack. Mindful of their

rulers built a fortified enclave for
themselves in the upper part of
the town, the remains of which
are still visible today. It was here
that they collected taxes and
received their due share of the
proceeds from mining.
PIONEERING
TECHNOLOGY
By the Middle Ages Banská
Stiavnica was producing 20 per
cent of the sih er circulating on the
world market, as well as large
quantities of gold for export to var¬
ious parts of Europe, especially
Germany and Flanders. Two cities
further north, Gremnica and Ban¬
ska Bystrica, also rich in precious
metals, flourished at the same
time. Growing ever richer, the Ger¬
man colonists and the Hungarian
nobility began building Catholic
and Protestant churches and
stately palaces and mansions that
were the glory of the kingdom.
After the Battle of Mohaes in
1526 in which the Magyar army
was defeated, the Turks occupied
Buda and began making armed
forays into the interior of Slova¬
kia, then known as Upper Hun¬
gary. Even so, they were never able
to lay their hands on the gold and
silver mines. With support from
the forces of Count Nicholas
Pallfy, the inhabitants of Banská
Stiavnica succeeded in repelling
the foreign invaders in 1593 only
a few kilometres from the town.
In 1627, explosives were used
(for the first time for such a pur¬
pose in Europe) to extract ore from
the mountain. In the seventeenth
century two local engineers per¬
fected a mechanical pumping sys¬
tem which improved the silver
extraction process by creating some
sixty artificial lakes to drain off the
water that was forever threatening
to flood the mines. About twenty of
them still exist, and the Slovaks
bathe in them during the summer
months. In the eighteenth century
Banská Stiavnica became the Euro¬
pean centre of mining technology
and expertise. In 1762, Maria
Theresa, Empress of Austria and
Queen of Hungary, founded a Min¬
ing Academy there. The first of its
kind in the world, it attracted cel¬
ebrated teachers from all over
Europe. One of the founders of
modern chemistry, Antoine Lau¬
rent de Lavoisier, gave it his sup¬
port. The Academy's reputation
was such that it served as a model
for the Ecole Polytechnique in
Paris.
However, by the end of the nine¬
teenth century the mines were no
longer profitable. Today there are
a mere 10,600 people living in Ban¬
ská Stiavnica, and only a few of the
region's slender gold and silver veins
are still mined. Despite wars,

earthquakes and (ires, the town's
prestigious past largely survives
in the monuments and buildings
that were erected over the cen¬
turies. These form an architec¬
tural complex that is a blend of
the Romanesque, Gothic, Renais¬
sance, Baroque and Neo-classical.
Every community Slovak, Ger¬
man and Hungarian has added
its contribution, making Banská
Stiavnica a unique site and war¬
ranting its inclusion on UMCSCO's

This blend is perhaps one of the
reasons w hy it is not easy for people
to find their way around the tow n's
steep, winding maze of streets. The
only easily identifiable landmark is
Trinity Square (Namestie s v. Tro-
j ice) in the heart of the city. Boast¬
ing a quadruple eighteenth-cen¬
tury Baroque colonnade sculpted
by Italian artist Dionyz Stanctti, it
was built in memory of the plague
victims of 1710 and 1711. Similar
colonnades, of varying degrees of
quality, exist in several other Slovak
cities.
Gothic or Renaissance style
houses stand on either side of the
triangular square that slopes
steeply down to the old low n hall.
At number 12 a modern art
gallery bears the name of the
painter JozefKollár (1899-1982),
who was horn and died in Banská
Stiavnica. His works are impres¬
sionistic in style, and apart from
his portraits he is best known for
his Z Povuzia ("Along the River
Vah") and Ziinmy trh v lianskeuj
Stiavnici ("The Winter Market in
Banská Stiavnica").
IN SEARCH
OF THE PAST
Two medieval churches 500
metres apart symbolize the exis¬
tence side by side of the town's
two communities. One is St.
Catherine's Church (Kostol sv
Katariny), also known as the Slo-
vakian church because mass was
celebrated there in the Slovak lan¬
guage from the seventeenth cen¬
tury onwards. The other is the
Church of the Blackfriars, once
known as the German Church.
Neo-gothie in style since its recon¬
struction at the end of the nine¬
teenth century, St. Catherine's
houses a polychrome wooden
sculpture of the Madonna dating
from 1506. The mortal remains
of wealthy Banská Stiavnica nota¬
bles and burghers lie in the crypt.
An ancient Roman basilica with
three naves, the Blackfriars
church was rebuilt in 1806 and
contains a remarkable nineteenth-
century organ.
The partly ruined Old Castle
(Stary zamok) is visible on the
heights above the town centre. It
is surrounded by sixteenth-cen¬
tury ramparts and was the enclave
of the Hungarian kings. Facing it
on another hill is the New Castle
(Novy zamok), which was built as
part of a complex of fortifications

by the inhabitants of Banská
Stiavnica from 1564 to 1571 to
protect them from the Turks. It is
now the most interesting of the
town's historic buildings. The
whitewashed structure, endowed
with four bastions, is both mas¬
sive and elegant in appearance.
Several of its floors have been fit¬
ted out to house a museum
devoted to the region's history,
especially the struggles against
the Ottoman army. It also contains
many mementoes from the six¬
teenth and seventeenth centuries.
Other churches, chapels,
stately mansions, abandoned
mines and old, narrow paved
streets where motor traffic is pro¬
hibited confer a somewhat unreal
feeling on the centuries-old mining
town. Yet three thousand stu¬
dents a year attend its School of
Mining and Industry, which is
located in a park overlooking Trin¬
ity Square and is one of the best in
Central Europe. Between classes
the students can he seen strolling
through the nearby alleys lined
with houses and gardens, as if in
search of the past.
Vestiges
of an
industrial
past
Banská Stiavnica, Slovakia's oldest mining
town, lies on the steep slopes of the Glanzenberg
in the Paradajz Mountains.
Its ores have been worked since the Bronze
Age (lOth-Sth centuries B.C.) and mining only
ceased at the end of the 19th century.
The city and the technical plant in the
surrounding area illustrate a remarkable
symbiosis between the urban environment and
the natural habitat.
State-of-the-art technology
In the 17th century Banská Stiavnica saw a large
number of technological advances. Gunpowder
was used in the mines for the first time. In the
fi eld of hydraulic energy, a system of dams and
weirs was built in the 18th century to wash the
ore. This system was adopted all over the world
and remained the most advanced of its kind right
into the 19th century.
Reservoirs and dams
About 20 reservoirs have survived, the oldest of
which, Velkà Vodárenská, was built in 1510.
Three others date from the 16th century and two
more from the 17th century. Most of them were
built in the 18th century, a period of intense
mining activity in the town.
There is also a series of damsthe longest of
which is nearly 775 metres longand water-
collecting channels.
Factories and mines
Two remarkable drainage galleries still exist: the
Beiber, begun in the 14th century, is the oldest
known example of its kind. The Voznicka gallery,
which is over a kilometre long, was the world's
longest when it was inaugurated in 1878.
There are also several surface ore deposits.
The mine building and the Mayer machine room
(begun in 1805) are still standing.
Also still standing is a silver and lead smelting
plant which dates from the first half of the 17th
century and was modernized in 1872. It was one of
the buildings belonging to the world's first factory
producing machine-made metal cable (1837). Last
but not least, the mine museum houses a number of
items of equipment from the region.
