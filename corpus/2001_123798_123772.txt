INTERVIEW BY RENÉ LEFORT
DIRECTOR OFTHE UNESCO COURIER



C o n t e m p o rary art:
who calls the shots?
Despite the international veneer of the art market, research by French sociologist Alain Quémin
shows that a handful of rich countries dominates the scene
ow has contemporary art been affected by
globalization?
Contemporary art lovers and
professionals believe that it’s becoming
increasingly internationalized. A n y
gallery director, art critic, m u s e u m
curator or exhibition commissioner
would more or less agree that it would be
absurd to take nationality or country of
origin into account when judging an
artist’s  work.All that matters, they say,
is whether or not he or she is good. In
other words,an artist’s fame and market
value should have nothing to do with
n a t i o n a l i t y. As proof, those in the art
world point to the fact that exhibitions
and biennales are scattered around the
planet2 (they are even held in Havana,
Taipei and Dakar), and to the rise of
Asian artists after the Eastern European
wave of the early 1990s. In contemporary
a r t , globalization and its corollaries in
the art world—cultural mixing and
relativism—are taken for granted.
But do these claims match what is actually
happening on the art market?
To answer that question, I have
developed or compared several
i n d i c a t o r s, including rankings of
“ r e p u t a t i o n ” by experts (those who
contribute to an artist’s fame or “name
recognition”),the composition of large
private and public collections,
acquisitions by large museums,
participation in major fairs and biennale
e x h i b i t i o n s, sales on the international
m a r k e t , and so on. These indicators
sometimes give different rankings, but
they reveal a very strong geographical
hierarchy (see box). The most famous
artists and those whose works have the
highest market value are from the
United States. Several countries in
Western Europe form the second group,
sometimes equal to or outdoing the
United States, especially at fairs and
biennales.
But the ranking in this group is very
m a r k e d . Germany is far ahead of the
United Kingdom, Fr a n c e, Italy and
S w i t z e r l a n d .After them,the contribution
from other nations, including developed
countries such as Spain, the Nordic
c o u n t r i e s, Japan and South Ko r e a , i s
i n s i g n i fic a n t . The third world is at the
very bottom of the list.
In art as in many other fie l d s, there is
obviously a gulf between a “ c e n t r e,”
made up of only a few countries that are
themselves ranked in a very rigid
hierarchy, and a huge “periphery.”
But artists from the periphery, as you call
i t , have achieved a certain degree of fame
and their works have attained a very high
market value…
That may be true, but the proportion
is very small.And how long will it last?
Artists from Eastern Europe, who were
very fashionable in the early 1990s, h a v e
now fallen into oblivion in the Western
art world.And there’s nothing to indicate
that the Asian or African artists currently
in vogue will not in their turn be as
“disposable as Kleenex”themselves.
In any case, how should they go
about getting known? There are
practically no exceptions to the rule:
they must be exhibited in a country at the
centre or  go there to live in the hope of
finding their place in mainstream
contemporary art.
But hasn’t this inequality always existed?
Without going too far back,didn’t France
occupy this “monopolistic”position from
the late 19th to the mid-20th century?
Ye s,but the big difference is that this
dominant position was recognized and
fully accepted in the name of France’s
contribution to art history.To d a y, on the
c o n t r a r y, contemporary art circles cannot
recognize America’s supremacy in this
field because they simply don’t “see”it.
In the artistic fields where this supremacy
is recognized,it tends to be stigmatized
because the United States is considered

at Marne-la-Vallée university (Fr a n c e ) ,

entitled “The role of buyer countries on the
market and in the contemporary art
world”

a latecomer on the art scene.
So why is there this contradiction between
image and reality?
I ’ll answer with another question:
why would the contemporary art world
be an exception to the dominant
globalization credo, according to which
e v e r y o n e, wherever they are, has a
chance as long as they have talent? A n d
more specifically, why would it be free
from two contradictory movements that
are part of globalization? On the one
h a n d , you have an endless search for
i n n o v a t i o n , which sometimes goes as
far as including the periphery. On the
o t h e r, the tendency to minimize risk,
especially financial risk, ends up
boosting the value of artists from well-
established art centres, who are
therefore the easiest to promote.
But playing the devil’s advocate, can’t we
say that  “ g o o d ” c o n t e m p o rary artists
simply wouldn’t choose to live in places
w h e re their work cannot be pro p e r l y
exhibited or sold?
To d a y, artists from the periphery
have a growing number of opportunities
to aid them. For example, fine arts
schools are now more open to the
w o r l d . H o w e v e r, these artists rarely
make it on the international scene. Is
that because they might be “naturally”
worse? Let’s take a sporting metaphor.
For decades, people thought you had
to be Scandinavian to be a champion
middle-distance runner.Then they came
from Eastern Europe. N o w, a t h l e t e s
from North and East Africa are winning
all the races.And each time, the success
of these different groups is considered
“ n a t u r a l .” At the very least, t h e
geographical concentration of
contemporary art hampers the
recognition of the artistic potential that
exists outside the United States and in
some European countries. ■
1. Experts sometimes disagree, but they
generally define contemporary art as an
i n n ovative form of creation that
emerged after 1960.The main media
are painting, sculpture, photography,
video, montages and installations.
2. Fairs are events where art works from
galleries chosen by the organizers are
sold. The most famous one is in Basel,
S w i t ze r l a n d . In contrast, biennales are
non-commercial art events (exhibitions)
that display works selected by
c o m m i s s i o n e r s. By defin i t i o n , they are
held every two years.The most recognize d
biennales take place in Venice, Italy and
Kassel,Germany.
Without calling them by their name, Beninese artist Georges Adeagbo, 59,had been doing installations for
over 20 years when Frenchman Jean-Michel Rousset came scouting around the capital Cotonou in search
of new artistic talents for a big collector. By chance, he fell upon Adeagbo’s home and discovered his work
(above picture).That was back in April 1993.A few months later, Adeagbo’s pieces went on show in France
for the first time. At the beginning of this year, works by the Beninese artist were exhibited at the
prestigious P.S.1 museum in New York.
