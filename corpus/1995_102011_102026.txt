China : when loess means more
by Jean Paul Loubes
An original solution to
the challenge of living
in a semi-desert
climate, the dug-out
villages of the Yellow
River offer many
advantages to their
inhabitants
More than forty million Chinese still
live underground, most of them in the
Huang Ho (Yellow River) basin in the
country's central provinces of Gansu, Henan,
Shaanxi and Shanxi.
Climate, geography and geology have
encouraged the development of this kind of
architecture. With low rainfall and an aridity
that increases the further one travels north-
westward, the climate of these continental
regions is subject to wide swings in tempera-
ture between night and day, summer and
winter. The land has been extensively
sculpted by the 4, 800-kilometre-long river

and its tributaries. Throughout its long his-
tory the giant Yellow River has left in its
lower basin deposits of materials detached
from the land in its upper reaches, deposits
that have been shaped by its wandering
course.
Geologically speaking, the middle basin of
the Huang Ho forms the world's largest area
of loess, a silt deposit made from an accumula-
tion of dust carried by the wind during the ice
ages. Highly consistent, the soil is easy to dig
and, with sufficient irrigation (since it does not
retain water), it can become fertile cropland.
Such conditions have traditionally attracted
human settlement, and these loess regions
were the cradle of Chinese civilization in very
ancient times. A variety of forms of cave
dwelling developed here, confirming that
troglodytism is an advanced form of architec-
ture that has developed over time, just like
surface building. All the different possibilities
of cave design, vertical and horizontal, are
found in the Yellow River region.
Wells of heaven
Here, on flat ground, entire villages consist of
dwellings built around vertical shafts. The
layout of the dwellings follows rigorous prin-
ciples. A shaft approximately fifteen metres
square is dug vertically into the ground to
form a courtyard. This area, around which
the different rooms are built, is the equivalent
of the central courtyard known as the"well
of heaven"which is a feature of the traditional
dwellings of northern China. It is usually six
metres deep, which explains why the tem-

perature is stable and why each shaft is
sound-proofed from the next. Rooms are
dug sideways into walls facing south, east and
west. Each wall contains two or three
rounded or pointed arches. The north-facing
side of the shaft is taken up by entrances and
sometimes a storage chamber.
The main rooms-bedrooms, the room
for the ancestors'altar and the living room-
are dug into the south-facing side. As in the
traditional Chinese house, each one is
equipped with a kang, a stove under a
rammed earth bed. The screen-wall, or
yingbi, of the dwelling is another feature that
is also found in houses built above ground. It
stands in the courtyard facing the entrance,
and its main purpose is to prevent evil spirits,

the house. Screen walls are about two metres
high, and are made of rammed earth, adobe
or fired brick, topped with tiles. In the
middle of each wall is a small niche containing
a divinity.
Each house is reached by a sloping path
made of rammed earth, in some cases shaped
into a staircase with a smooth ramp beside it.
When the slope is particularly steep the ramp
may tunnel through grain stores, tool sheds,
or sometimes even a well. In some cases the
site of the dwelling is indicated on the surface
by a built entrance marking the beginning of
the ramp. Once again, the design of these
entrances is the same as that found in tradi-
tional houses built on the surface.

examples of a form of housing design that
combines the heating advantages of under-
ground conditions and the climate outside.
The central shaft is the key structural factor. It
organizes and defines the living area and lets
in light and warmth from the sun. With
dwellings located beneath the soil and fields
at ground level, the land is used twice over.
In these villages private and public space
is divided into two levels with just a few
metres between them. At any point in this
urban fabric the two levels communicate.
This original system combines two qualities
that do not usually coexist in traditional
housing : the dwelling is extremely isolated
and yet the public space and the social life that
goes with it are just above the doorstep.
Dug-outs
and built-up areas
Caves hewn from the hillside are especially
well adapted to the hilly country of Henan,
Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, making skilful
use of the topography and the resources of
indigenous architecture.
Caves are dug laterally into loess cliffs.
This is the most widely used technique
because it is the most straightforward way of
attacking a hillside facing south or southwest.
The rubble is generally used to make a flat
area in front of the entrance to the dwelling,
which eventually becomes the courtyard.
Packed-down loess is an extremely homoge-
neous material and enables symmetrically
shaped arches-pointed, rounded or other-
wise-to be made.
The extensive Chinese heritage of dug-out
dwellings ranges from the simplest four-by-
six-metre rooms to layouts of extreme intri-
cacy. In addition to the rooms dug out of the
hillside, the courtyard may be used as a site for
constructed houses, for troglodytic dwellings
are often combined with other forms of archi-
tecture. Some highly elaborate troglodytic
dwellings are built on terraces on different
levels and consist of a complex of buildings and
artificial caves. These caves have the same
shape as excavated vaults but are made of
stone masonry. Entirely made by human
agency, they have all the advantages of natural
caves, especially their constant temperature.
Their thick walls and massive earth roofing
provide a mild and stable temperature.
This blend of excavation and surface
building is typical of Chinese architecture. N
