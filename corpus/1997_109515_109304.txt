heritage has been
hard hit by recent
events in that
country.
Here Ylljet Aliçka,
Chief of the Foreign
Affairs Department
of the Albanian
Ministry of Culture,
Youth and Women's
Affairs, talks to
Jasmina Sopova.
The pictures coming out of
Albania since March 1997 show a
country in turmoil. The media
report army barracks being
sacked, automatic rifles being
freely toted around, curfews
being imposed, European soldiers
being landed for Operation Alba,
snap elections being called and so
on, but not a word about culture.
Ylljet Aliçka: In times of trouble,
unfortunately, culture is not
regarded as a priority inside the
country any more than it is out¬
side. The damage that is being
inflicted on Albania's culture is per¬
haps less serious than the economic
harm it is suffering, but it is
irreparable: in time the economy
will recover, but artefacts bearing
witness to centuries of culture will
have disappeared forever.
What is the bill for the damage?
Y. A.: It is hard to say with any cer¬
tainty at present, just as it is hard to
say what is the motivation behind
it: is it wanton destruction or delib¬
erate looting? The estimated cost of
damage to cultural property amounts
to around $800,000. Many municipal
buildings, cinemas and museums
have been wrecked. The Tirana Fac¬
ulty of Agriculture, which was par¬
ticularly well computerized, has been
plundered, and some 400,000 books
have gone up in flames.
Is there a parallel here with
what happened to the Sarajevo
library?
Y. A.: No, the books were not
burned for the same reasons. In Sara-
jevo the aim was to destroy a cen¬
turies-old heritage that was shared
by the different communities, to
wipe the slate of history clean. In
Albania, where the different ethnic
groups have historically lived
together in harmony, I would say
the burning of the books led on
from the street fighting. The books

in the municipal libraries were
destroyed together with the library
buildings, and the Faculty of Agri¬
culture's huge collection disappeared
together with its computers. There
was no political motive behind the
destruction of the books.
What about the museums?
Y. A.: The Dürres Archaeological
Museum was seriously damaged and
eighty objects dating from the Illyr-
ian period were stolen, but the
inventory was preserved and will
perhaps make it possible to track
the objects down later, when the
country has dealt with its most
urgent problems. The case of
Butrinti, on the other hand, is far
more serious: this ancient site,
which was included on UNESCO's
World Heritage List1 in 1992, was
ransacked, its museum looted and
its records burned, so that no inves¬
tigation is possible. Being in the
south of the country, the site is for
the time being inaccessible to the
authorities.
So the looting will go on. . . .
Y. A.: Maybe, but the public is
starting to react, which is a very
encouraging sign. While some peo¬
ple are plundering and devastating
everything they come across, others
risk their lives to save whatever can
still be saved: a well-known film¬
maker, for example, personally
stood out against the attack on the
Tirana Cinematographic Centre,
and a librarian was killed when she
tried to protect the books in the
Berat municipal library. In both
Berat and Korcha men and women
took up arms to defend the
medieval icon museums, and many
of the icons arc now under protec¬
tion in private hands.
We do not, however, have the
resources to establish a strategy for
the protection of our cultural her¬
itage, which is why we have just
appealed for support to the Coun¬
cil of Europe in Strasbourg and
why we shall shortly be turning to
UNESCO and other international
institutions.
