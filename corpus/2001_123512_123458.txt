Can genetically modifie d
o rganisms feed the world?
The controversy over biotechnologies is raging. Advocates claim they’re the only answer
to malnutrition, while opponents warn that drought-resistant millet and vaccinated yams will only
increase poverty
ear A f r i c a ’s mighty Niger River, f a r m e r s
are anxiously waiting for rain to fall
before they sow millet or sorghum,then
h o e, h a r v e s t , feed their families and
replenish their granaries. M e a n w h i l e,
researchers in Ja p a n e s e, C h i n e s e,
P h i l i p p i n e, European and U. S.
laboratories are making strides in
sequencing the 12 chromosomes and
50,000 genes composing rice, the matrix of
all grains and a staple for three billion
human beings. In five to ten years, they
hope to know enough to genetically
modify not only rice, but millet, s o r g h u m ,
manioc and sugar cane as well.The aim is
to make them “ n a t u r a l l y ” resistant to
drought,soil salinity, viruses, blights and
other scourges.
Will these genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) really guarantee
“food security”in the short term for the
w o r l d ’s 826 million undernourished
i n d i v i d u a l s ?1 Will they help the small-
scale farmers cultivating the Niger’s
b a r r e n , powdery soil to feed their
families? The controversy is raging. In its
2001 report, the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) says
they will, emphasizing GMOs’ “unique
potential”to feed the world.In 50 years,
the Earth’s population will have soared to
nine billion— three billion more than
today.2 And most of the newcomers will
increase the already overwhelming
pressure on the southern countries’ much-
depleted soil.The alarm has already been
sounded for sub-Saharan Africa where,
unlike India and China, the population
growth rate is still sky-high and the

barely declining. GMO supporters say
only a major,revolutionary “ t e c h n o l o g i c a l
l e a p ” will enable the planet to feed all
its children.
Experimenting with
miracle seeds
But others strongly disagree,a r g u i n g
that low food production is not what
causes malnutrition. There is enough to
eat in the southern countries, they say.
But the world’s poorest people, t h o s e
with neither money nor land, living in
d i s i n t e g r a t i n g,w a r-torn countries, s i m p l y
have no access to food. They argue that
land-use conditions must change, p o o r
people must have access to credit and
local markets and small land-owners must
be freed from money-lenders.Better use
could be made of traditional seeds instead
of importing high-risk technology with
unpredictable consequences, most of
whose patents belong to giant
multinationals.
Advocates of the GMO revolution
work in biogenetics laboratories,
multinational seed and agrochemical
companies, genome research,American
foundations and some UN agencies,w h i l e
most skeptics are out in the field.A case
in point is Kanayo Nwanzé, a Ph.D. i n
agronomy who heads Adrao (Association
for the Development of Rice Growing
in West Africa) in Bouaké,Côte d’Ivoire.
“Are GMOs being developed for the
needs of small-scale farmers or
multinational corporations?” he asks.“ I f
we manage to negotiate with these
patent-holding multinationals a
technology that meets the needs of small-
scale farmers and that’s not under license,
then ‘ Ye s ! ,’ GMOs will have a role to
play in A f r i c a . But their impact will have
to come under careful scrutiny and the
r e g i o n ’s countries must have safety rules
and the means to enforce them.”
Adrao researchers have experience
with miracle seeds. With international
f u n d i n g, they have developed a
revolutionary variety of rice called Nerica.
Genetically unmodifie d , it is the result
of a conventional cross between a high-
yield but fragile variety of Asian rice and
a local variety that has had 35 centuries to
adapt to Africa’s stressful environment.
Nerica offers tremendous possibilities. I t
reaches maturity in 90 days instead of
the usual 120 to 150, resists insects, y i e l d s
three tonnes per hectare with neither
fertilizers nor irrigation—compared with
1.5 tonnes for traditional varieties—and
grows like a weed. I d e a l l y, it should
improve life for hundreds of thousands of
small-scale farmers who practice pluvial
rice farming on plots of land ranging in
size from 20 to 200 square metres and
help West Africa’s countries drastically
cut their rice imports, perhaps even to
export the grain.
Fear and red tape
H o w e v e r, this breakthrough is having
d i f ficulty leaving the laboratory. Th e r e
are approximately 3,000 variants of
N e r i c a , and for four years Nwanzé has
been trying to involve small-scale farmers
in selecting which ones to market.But in
the summer of 2001,only a thousand Côte
d’Ivoire farmers grew this “miracle rice”
on a total of just one hectare. . . . R e d
t a p e, administrative delays and lack of
communication between ministries and
farmers, seed-certification organizations
and rural credit institutions are to blame.
A “technological leap” is not likely to
help matters much.On the contrary.“If we
offer a farmer genetically modified seeds,
he’ll say ‘no thanks, I don’t want to kill
myself!’”says the head of Adrao.
Several A f r i c a n , Asian and South
American countries have already passed
laws regulating GMO production. B u t
can they enforce them? Wh i c h
laboratories will monitor the changes in
biodiversity that might result from
unforeseen crossbreeding between
GMOs and related wild species? A n d
with what funding? Who will see to it
that pollen from GMOs capable of
transmitting their defense mechanisms
against insects and viruses do not spread?
Researchers retort that it would be a
mistake to focus on first-generation
G M O s, which are necessarily flawed.
“Soon we’ll see the appearance of the
s e c o n d , third and fourth generations,
which will meet developing countries’
needs better,” says Jean Claude Prot, w h o
is currently dissecting rice’s 12th
chromosome at the Development
Research Institute,a French public outfit
affiliated with the International Rice
Genome Sequence Project.
Biogenetics makes it possible, f o r
example, to insert an insect’s gene into a
plant or vaccines into bananas or
potatoes. To create a variety of rice that
needs no more water than a camel

The United States alone harbours 70% of the
world’s transgenic crops, followed by Argentina
(14%) and Canada (10%). Soya (used for oil and
flour for animal feed) accounts for 54% of these
cultivated areas, ahead of corn, colza and
cotton.

necessary to produce one kilo), or again,
to enrich plants with vitamins and
minerals and develop others that
revitalize acidic soil devastated by over-
f a r m i n g. So why not carry out the wildest
projects?
It is easy to understand the
enthusiasm of certain researchers and
philanthropic institutions. For example,
the Rockefeller Foundation sees what it
calls the biotech-driven “second Green
Revolution”as a way to make up for the
first one’s mistakes and tragedies.Tr u e, i n
the 1960s, the Green Revolution helped
double food production by creating high-
yield varieties of wheat and rice, k e e p i n g
pace with the world’s population growth.
But these seeds, which need
plentiful inputs (irrigation,
f e r t i l i z e r s, herbicides and
p e s t i c i d e s ) , have primarily
b e n e fited farmers who could
afford to invest. Africa and
the poorest areas in Asia and
Latin America were left out.
M o r e o v e r, the results for
beneficiaries, such as China
and Vi e t n a m , are mixed:
traditional varieties have
v a n i s h e d , irrigation has
increased soil salinity, a n d
farmers have over- u s e d
herbicides and pesticides to
the detriment of their health
and the environment.
Great 
expectations
Supporters of the “second Green
R e v o l u t i o n ”say GMOs should spark an
explosive increase in yields without
inputs and in extreme farming conditions.
But will they benefit the poorest farmers?
Until now, multinational agrochemical
companies converted to the “ l i f e
s c i e n c e s ” have focused all their
investments on intensive crops with close
connections to industry and built a wall
of prohibitively-expensive patents
around their discoveries. Only publicly-
funded research has taken an interest in
indigent farmers living in tropical areas.
Strapped for cash,the public sector has
been forced to sign cooperation
agreements with the private sector at the
risk of losing its independence.
Major biotech companies are
a c c u s e d , of producing “ Fr a n k e n s t e i n
f o o d ,” especially in Europe.They quickly
caught onto the image-enhancing
advantages of helping to develop GMOs
for the Third Wo r l d . In 2000,amid a blaze
of publicity, biotech heavyweights
granted the free use of 70 patents to help
develop a genetically-modified variety of
rice enriched with beta carotene. Th e
grain was heralded as a “miracle rice”
capable of conquering Vitamin A
d e fic i e n cy, which kills one to two million
children each year. But so far, t h e
“golden rice” has fallen far short of
e x p e c t a t i o n s. The publicly-funded,
Philippines-based International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) estimates that
it will take five to ten years before seeds
can be distributed free to farmers with
annual incomes of under $10,000, in line
with the agreements signed with industry.
F u r t h e r m o r e, it is still unclear how much
of the rice has to be consumed to make
up for a Vitamin A deficiency.
For non-governmental organizations
campaigning to protect the environment
and preserve biodiversity, such as the
Rural Advancement Fo u n d a t i o n
International (RAFI) network,this deal
“could kneecap other, low-tech and more
cost-effective solutions, such as re-
introducing the many vitamin-rich food
plants that were once cheap and
available.”
Lessons
from the past
Will GMOs help wipe out
malnutrition? The golden rice episode
has set the tone for the debate.A d v o c a t e s
say it would be utopian to wait for a better
world while existing technology can help
solve the problem here and now.“Some
argue that lack of food is simply a
problem of unequal distribution.
If poor people were not poor, t h e y
could buy the food they need,” s a y s
Rockefeller Foundation president
Gordon Conway. “ This is true, b u t
o v e r s i m p l i s t i c. There are no signs the
world is about to engage in a massive
redistribution of wealth.”
Adversaries of the “ G M O
r e v o l u t i o n ” have diametrically opposed
priorities:equity first,technology later.
Otherwise, they say, the same mistakes
that were made during the 1960s will
be repeated. The Green Revolution
“increased production and the number
of poor people at the same time,” says
Jean-Pierre Roca, director of France’s
Institute for Training and Support to
Development Initiatives.“ Where there
i s n ’t a credit system, middlemen and the
powerful are the ones who
appropriate improved seeds
and the use of pesticides.Th e
poorest farmers must go into
debt and sell their land to
wealthier ones. GMOs are
hazardous if measures aren’t
taken to go along with
them.”
A pragmatic Nwanzé says
that “GMOs aren’t a priority.
First it is necessary to improve
the conditions of agricultural
production and soil
m a n a g e m e n t , keep the
ground from getting hard
after clearing and decrease
rice imports by impoverished
West African countries. All that can be
achieved without GMOs, which run the
risk of impoverishing biodiversity.” ■
