Germany:
Ge rman students took to the streets thirt y
ye a rs ago in a bid to ove rt u rn the “ b o u r-
g e o i s ” social order. N owa d ays the mood
could not be more different. G e rm a ny ’s 1.8 mil-
lion-plus students are learning to live in an era of high
unemployment and dwindling subsidies.
“ M a ny students are under the illusion that if
they work hard enough they’ll get a job,”s ays Carola
S c h m i d t , a fourth year history student at Berlin’s
Humboldt University.“But it’s not like that.Often
there are just no jobs.”
In the autumn of 1997,students staged a series
of strikes and protests to try and focus nat i o n a l
attention on their plight and the crisis ove r w h e l-
ming Germ a ny ’s institutes of higher educat i o n .T h e y
called for more money to be spent on upgr a d i n g
teaching and laboratory equipment,a comprehen-
sive review of government support for students as
well as reform of the country ’s higher educat i o n
system and moves to cut class sizes. Claudia Boege,
a student representat i ve at Frankfurt ’s Unive rs i t y
of Applied Science,b e l i e ves that public unive rs i t i e s
are facing the same difficulties as other parts of the
country’s social system.The problem is, she says,
“The politicians don’t have any new funding ideas.”

Lost illusions
The movement largely ran out of steam, l e av i n g
behind a trail of frustration and anxiety about the
f u t u r e .“The mood among students today is,‘ well we
c a n ’t change the process, so we had better make the
most of it’,” s ays Herbert Dieter, a political scientist
with the University of Duisenberg.
Despite considerable media coverage of the
s t rikes and widespread public sympat hy towa r d s
the students’ c a u s e , Dieter believes that the pro-
blems of education in Germ a ny remain. In part i-
c u l a r , he says that underfunded German unive rs i t i e s
are not offering their students much hope of fin-
ding a place on an increasingly competitive job mar-
ket.With classes so full that there is often just one
professor for eve ry 600 undergr a d u at e s , s t u d e n t s
s ay they have virtually no contact with their tea-
chers.
If finding a job after unive rsity is the key issue for
G e rman students today, s u p p o rting themselve s
during their years of study has also become a high
priority for many of them.Higher education might
be free in Germany, but students still have to make
ends meet to pay for the rent and other expenses.
Students have also been demanding increased
g ove rnment financial support .The number receiving
income from the state has fallen in recent ye a rs and
is now down to about 17 per cent in the we s t e rn
part of the country, compared with 37 per cent 15
ye a rs ago. A similar picture emerges in the east,
where the number of students receiving gove rn-
ment support has dropped over the last four years
from 55 per cent to about 32 per cent.
As a consequence, the number of students wo r-
king and studying at the same time has risen in recent
ye a rs , while the percentage of undergr a d u ates from
l ower income families has fallen from 23 per cent in
1982 to 13 per cent last ye a r.Working while studying
also tends to exacerbate another problem facing Ger-
man higher educat i o n ,which is the number of ye a rs
spent in the halls of academia.This often means that
m a ny students do not take their first steps towards a
full-time career until they are about thirty ye a rs old.
Holding down a job while studying is also impor-
tant because the lifestyle of today’s students is less
f rugal than that of their predecessors of three decades
a g o. According to a survey of German undergr a-
duates published in May 1998,six out of ten had a
car and four out of ten had their own apartments.
“ To d ay ’s students,” s ays Schmidt,“like to have more
fun and to live an easier life than those of 1968.” ■
