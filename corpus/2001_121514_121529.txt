Chugging along on
E u ro p e ’s literary ex p re s s
What happens when one hundred writers spend a month without books on a tra i n , d e b a t i n g
in more than 40 languages and stopping along the way to meet the crowds? For one
t ra v e l l e r, the Litera t u re Express Europe 2000 did not live up to its dream of cultural dialogue
ne hundred writers on the same train.
Aw e s o m e. U n p r e c e d e n t e d . The train
started in Lisbon and was called the
Southern Express until it reached Paris.
Then it went to Berlin,Saint Petersburg
and Moscow, for which it was rechristened
the Northern Express.For the purposes of
the entire trip, t h e r e f o r e, it was the North-
South Express. A legend comparable to
the Orient Express was born.
I boarded the train without any
preconceptions. It was enough for me to
know that in Germany, where the idea
was invented, it was called
Literaturexpress Europa 2000 and in
other countries the Comboio da literatura
europa 2000, the Expreso da literatura
europa 2000, the Literaturtrena europa
2000 or Literaturas ekspresis eiropa, a n d
so on.A train with many names that all
said the same thing but had a different
ring each time. In that sense, it was lyrical;
what more could poets ask for?
And by the way, what would a train
like this be like without cellular phones,
cameras and other substitutes for male
virility? A n s w e r : it would be worthless.
Cellular phones, extensively used during
the trip by serious-looking passengers,g a v e
the train a distinctive feel.They were to our
train what the six-shooter is to the western.
At fir s t , there was just a train.Only as
time went by did it become our train, f o r
all of us writers,attendants and journalists.
Much to my surprise, the journalists were
very polite.They belong to our big family.
We accepted them and that put them at
e a s e.We didn’t mind the situation, for not
only were the questions they asked very
different from the common ones,but they
also took a more original approach to
photographing us. They were our
t e a m m a t e s, in the noble sense of the term.
Our train is on the Internet:
w w w. l i t e r a t u r e x p r e s s. o r g. We travelled
across Europe at top speed, but our souls
did not follow. But we are on the Internet,
therefore we are.
We represent a vast potential: t h e
European intelligentsia on rails. All of
us travelled quietly in the same direction,
in first-class. If the train disappeared in
D ü r r e n m a t t ’s1 t u n n e l , many books
slumbering in our guts and minds would
never see the light of day, and many
poems would be swallowed up by
d a r k n e s s. O h , dearest locomotive,
whether you look like the mouth of a
c r o c o d i l e, a shark or a laughing
c o r m o r a n t , beware of the Dürrenmatt
tunnel! The publishers, who love us the
same way that pimps love their

p r o s t i t u t e s,would never forgive you your
trespasses.
The women and men of letters were
received by the former French prime
minister and deputy mayor of the city of
B o r d e a u x ,Alain Ju p p é ,who invited us to
attend a reception held in our honour at
city hall. He did not show up and sent a
delegate to read his speech, which was
probably drafted by his secretary. A f t e r
the first three sentences, translation into
English and German began,which slowed
the process down considerably, t h o u g h
the more the sentences were put through
the translation mill, the shorter they
b e c a m e. To be honest, they should have
been translated ad absurd u m, until the
machine ground up all our languages.Th e n
the last language should have been
translated into Fr e n c h ,which would have
given us a completely new text. That is
how money gets laundered in my country
I tell myself.
Bordeaux is the city of the three Ms. I f
that brings to mind McDonald’s, t h e
symbol of the Mercure hotel chain or, i f
you are familiar with Switzerland, t h e
MigrosMarkt logo, your way of thinking 
is most definitely down-to-earth. For

Bordeaux is in fact the city of the
writers Montaigne,M o n t e s q u i e u
and Mauriac.
Q u e s t i o n : “ What do you
think of the train?”the journalists
a s k . We asked each other the
same thing.This idea is already a
reality for us. For the sake of
literature we have already
embarked on an adventure that
no longer has anything to do with
l i t e r a t u r e. The train is nothing
more than an outlandish event,
by dint of which it is also a classic
short story, like a slight
earthquake in Chile, the monster of
Kaliningrad or God knows what else. O n
top of which,no one expects us to present
our works.Our books are not on the train.
No one—strictly no one—asks us for our
t e x t s. That is what makes this train so
s p e c i a l .We travel naked,authors without
b o o k s. A library car designed to house
our writings in every European language
never got beyond the planning stage.
Until Kaliningrad, we would have been
best off reading a book entitled T h e
Critique of Pure Illusion.2
Trick question:other people are always
the ones asking the questions. Now it’s
our turn. What do you think of our
literature? Why haven’t you read our
books? Why aren’t you interested in what
we wrote before and after 19913, and in
what we are going to write in the future?
Whether we’re going to continue licking
the boots of the president of the Republic
or ruthlessly continue throwing everything
we think into his face? You don’t know
anything about what we write and you
c o u l d n ’t care less.Yo u ’re only interested in
us because we make you look good.
“ Why did you join this trip?” a
journalist asks me at the Gare de l’Est in
Paris. Or was it the Gare du Nord or the
Gare Saint Lazare? I really don’t know
a n y m o r e. All those train stations start
looking the same after a while. Let’s get
back to the question.The journalist asked
what I think of religions. Damn! Th a t
wasn’t it. It was, “Why did you join this
t r i p ? ” Or something like that. It didn’t
m a t t e r, just so long as the answer was
clever and well-founded.
Here you go then: I am on this trip
because I wanted another chance to
escape from my mountains and my native
l a n g u a g e, R h a e t o - R o m a n i c, which is
spoken by a mere 40,000 people,almost all
of whom know each other.We sometimes
feel cramped and would like to get out
into the so-called wide world to hear and
speak other languages. This journey
seemed like a godsend to satisfy that basic
n e e d , though I will not conceal the fact
that it was also inexpensive and accessible.
I also wanted once and for all to answer a
crucial question that every mountain-
dweller asks and that Schiller,who was not
a mountain-dweller but a poet,put in the
following terms: Fa t h e r, are there
countries where there are no mountains?
I left, fully aware of the risk that this train
could turn into a nightmare, into a train of
m a d n e s s. The reasons that led me into
taking this trip are so to speak, p r a c t i c a l
and cognitive at the same time.
A look back: Madrid is astounding;
Paris takes itself seriously; L i s b o n ,
destroyed by the 1755 earthquake, is by
far Europe’s most disillusioned city. It is
the only one that has not repressed its
past.It has the oldest soul.
What will be left of all these cities
one day? Wind.
A preliminary summing-up: in a train


Born in 1959 in Rabius
(Grisons,Switzerland), Leo
Tuor is a philosopher, writer
and translator in the winter,
shepherd and cow-herder in
the summer. A great
defender of his native
language, between 1994
and 1999 he published a
critical edition of six
volumes of works by the
Rhaeto-Romanic poet and
historian Giacun Hasper
Muoth (published by
Octopus in Chur). His last
book published in French
was Giacumbert Nau,
Lausanne, L’Age d’Homme,

c o m p a r t m e n t , five Te r t u l l i a n s4 a r e
discussing in Spanish,Rhaeto-Romanic,
O c c i t a n , French and Catalan whether
Europe is only made up of cities and
p o l l u t i o n .The discussion started with the
fall of the west (that is why this train of
“ w e l l - b e i n g ” is rolling east), then shifted
to the skirt-chaser who answered to the
name of Picasso, street brawls between
hooligans in Brussels, the poor
organization of the literary train and the
exasperation of many of our fellow
writers who have had more than enough
of wasting their time and would like to be
taken more seriously. L a t e r, the little
group took a close look at the concept of
literary freedom before coming to the
overall conclusion that only a writer who
does not depend on any publishing
company can claim he or she is free.
On the approach to Dortmund, w e
organized a group prayer session to ask
for a hotel that was a little more
presentable than the pigsties where we
stayed in Brussels. And our prayer was
a n s w e r e d . In this magnificent German
city, we were put up in lavish suites. For
two nights we felt like Nobel Prize
winners, considerably lifting our spirits,
which had been sagging since Paris.
At the Hanover Expo2000, we were
caught in a sudden downpour. Th e
t h u n d e r, lightning and wind were a
deliverance after the torrid heat of the
d a y. My shirt sticking to my skin, I ran all
the way to the Schweizerpavillon (the
Swiss pavilion), which attracted me so
irresistibly that this was my fifth visit.
For once, Switzerland was illustrated
neither through cows nor Alpine horns.
There was no facade, but an open maze
with 50 entrances that doubled as exits.
An open Switzerland.
Hanover was our last stop in the west.
It was also the longest day.
Our encounter with the east: on both
sides of the presidential palace gate, m e n
of steel were holding their semi-automatic
rifles planted in front of them like heavy
c a n d e l a b r a . They stared and never
b l i n k e d . We found that idiotic but got
used to it. We walked between the steel
men and through the house before
reaching the garden to drink and chat.
The thoughtful president delivered his
e u l o g y. For the occasion, we were the
d e a d , invited to an umpteenth reception.
A whisper was on everyone’s lips: t h e
president is said to be a writer himself.
On the train the dissidents were few
and those who played the game many,
shaming the memory of all the writers who
have died in camps and wars. This train
had its share of those who had adapted
Time to spare:heading to Dortmund in the former dancing car of the Görlitz, a 50-plus train.
their principles to suit the circumstances,
knuckled under to regimes and now were
at war memorials laying wreaths that had
been given to them. Their servility is
d i s g u s t i n g, something to cry over.
S o m e w h e r e, at a certain point, t h e
train had to turn into a political train, t o
the dismay of a great many passengers,
since we were supposed to be taking part
in a kind of official mission. We were
g u e s t s, or even diplomats, who were not
supposed to give anybody lessons, e v e n
when we travelled across dictatorships
where some of our colleagues had been
i m p r i s o n e d . Our train was not supposed to
degenerate into a train of resolutions or
p r o t e s t s.Wh a t ’s more, the train’s guardian
angels bent over backwards trying to
prevent it from turning into a dragon.
Dragons are unpredictable… ■
