TRUTH BEHIND THE VEIL OF FACTS
28
FOR centuries and centuries
the sidereal facts of this
world were set clear before
the eyes of humans ; yet what
those facts meant, what they pre¬
sented to man, what they made
evident to him was by no means a
reality, but quite the opposite an
enigma, a profound secret, a prob¬
lem before which man trembled
in terror.
Facts then, come to be like the
figures in hieroglyphic writing.
Have you ever noted the para¬
doxical character of such figures?
There they are, holding up their
clean profiles to us so ostenta¬
tiously ; but that very appearance
of clarity is there for the purpose
of presenting us with an enigma,
of producing in us not clarity, but
confusion. The hieroglyphic figure
says to us. "You see me clearly?
Good now what you see of me is
not my true being. I am here to
warn you that I am not my own
essential reality. My reality, my
meaning, lies behind me and is
hidden by me. In order to arrive
at it, you must not fix your atten¬
tion on me, nor take me for reality;
on the contrary, you will have to
interpret me, and this means that
by José Ortega y Gasset
In order to arrive at the true and
inward meaning of this hieroglyph,
you must search for something
very different from the aspect
which its figures offer."
Science is the interpretation of
facts. By themselves, facts do not
give us reality; on the contrary,
they hide it, which is to say that
they present us with the problem
of reality. If there were no facts,
there would be no problem, there
would be no enigma, there would
be nothing hidden which it is ne¬
cessary to de-hide, to dis-cover.
The word which the Greeks used
for truth is "aletheia", which means
discovery, to take away the veil
that covers and hides a thing.
Facts cover up reality ; while we
are in the midst of their innumer¬
able swarmings we are in chaos
and confusion. In order to dis¬
cover reality we must for a mo¬
ment lay aside the facts that surge
about us, and remain alone with
our minds. Then, on our own risk
and account, we imagine a reality,
or to put it another way, we
construct an imaginary reality, a
pure invention of our own; then,
following ¡n solitude the guidance
of our own personal imagining, we
find what aspect, what visible
shapes, in short, what facts would
be produced by that imaginary
reality. It is then that we come out
of our imaginative solitude, out
from our pure and isolated mental
state, and compare those facts
which the imagined reality would
produce with the actual facts which
surround us. If they mate happily
one with another, this means that
we have deciphered the hiero¬
glyph, that we have discovered the
reality which the facts covered
and kept secret.
That labour is what science is.
As you see, it consists of two
different operations: one purely
imaginative and creative, which
man produces out of his own most
free substance; the other a con¬
fronting of that which is not man,
of that which surrounds him,
the facts, the data. Reality is not
a datum, not something given or
bestowed, but a construction
which man makes out of the given
material.
