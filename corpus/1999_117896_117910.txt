Law and social j u s t i c e
w Kerry Rittich
Law reform in the service of democracy must find ways 
of protecting the vulnerable 
Legal reform and “good gove rn a n c e ”h ave va u l t e d
to the top of the development agenda. I n t e rn a-
tional financial institutions and influ e n t i a l
d o n o rs continually stress the importance of the ru l e
of law, a healthy regulat o ry environment and strong
and consistent enforcement of rights to successful
economic deve l o p m e n t . In the new world order, t h e
s t at e ’s role is to fa c i l i t ate pri vate activity rather than
guarantee the we l fare of its citizens.
But there is gr owing concern that market reform s
and globalization are connected to gr e ater social stra-
t i fic ation and economic inequality. W h at is often
overlooked is that legal reform may enhance rat h e r
than alleviate this strat i fic ation and inequality.
It is important to see legal reform as a key part
of a broader set of policy, legislative and institutio-
nal reforms which are designed to create not simply
rule- and norm-based societies but particular types
of market economies.There are no “free”markets;
functioning markets depend upon a legal infra-
s t ructure and a commitment to the rule of law.T h e
gr owing interest in legal reform indicates nothing if
not the widespread recognition of this fact.
Tradeoffs between
efficiency and equity
Respecting the rule of law and protecting ri g h t s
h owe ver does not mean that there is any one best set
of law s ,e ven in a market economy.Yet legal reform
projects in developing and transitional countries have
become inseparably associated with the idea of a
s i n g l e , optimal path or model. C u rrent projects
emphasize strong protection for property ri g h t s ,t h e
consistent enforcement of contracts and, i n c r e a s i n-
g l y, financial sector regulation as the foundation of an
i nve s t o r - f riendly legal infrastru c t u r e . At the same
t i m e , s t ates in transition to markets have been dis-
couraged from adopting or retaining “ e x c e s s i ve ”
r e g u l at i o n s , including protective labour market poli-
cies that might impede gr owth and effic i e n cy.
M a r k e t - o riented legal reforms can affect the for-
tunes of different groups in at least three different
way s.The first is through the types of reforms that are
i m p l e m e n t e d . Because legal reforms allocate ri g h t s
and entitlements, different rule structures may we l l
b e n e fit different groups in different way s. In some
i n s t a n c e s , there may be tradeoffs between effic i e n cy
and equity. Strong  property rights will protect
ow n e rs and entrepreneurs but may contri bute to the
d i s a d vantage of renters and wo r k e rs ; e nv i r o n m e n-
tal and consumer protection laws protect the public
at large but impose costs on bu s i n e s s e s.
S e c o n d , people can be affected by the absence of
p a rticular law s.Labour standards and laws authori-
zing collective bargaining, for example, h ave been
c rucial in industrialized societies. If they are weak or
missing as they are in many developing countri e s ,o r
if they are indefinitely postponed because pri o rity is
gi ven to implementing laws and regulations which
fa c i l i t ate economic transactions, vast numbers of
people can find themselves wo rse off than they need
be in the market for labour. Pa rticular groups may
also be harm e d .Women with caregiving obligat i o n s
are likely to be systematically disadvantaged and shut
out of better work opportunities without market
r e g u l ations which ensure that part of these costs are
b o rne by others.This is especially likely where social
p r o grammes and subsidies are reduced or eliminat e d
at the same time, as has occurred in many parts of
Central and Eastern Europe.
Open debate
Finally, where legal reforms follow a “standard
f o rm ” or are designed by experts from afa r , a com-
mon experience in transitional stat e s , the risk is
that local history and priorities will be ignored or
displaced and democratic control over decisions
about basic social organization is weakened.
To avoid aggravating inequality and worsening
the position of those who are frequently already
vulnerable in the reform process, three conditions
need to be met.
F i rs t , c o n flicts of interests—between wo r k e rs
and entrepreneurs , for example—as well as the
necessary tradeoffs that legal reforms often entail
should be acknowledged openly, r ather than hidden
behind the veil of efficiency. This will allow coun-
t ries to debate more openly the political and distri-
butive choices that legal reforms involve.
S e c o n d , donor countries and intern at i o n a l
financial institutions need to rethink the position
t h at state “ i n t e rve n t i o n ” is usually or necessari l y
the enemy of economic development.
T h i r d , d e veloping states need much more
space, indeed they should be actively encouraged,
to accommodate distri bu t i ve , equity and social
concerns not only through social programmes and
t r a n s f e rs but through the processes of legal and
r e g u l at o ry reform as we l l .This would allow gr e at e r
attention to labour market concerns and environ-
mental protection as well as to poverty alleviation
and gender,racial and ethnic equity. nw Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto
