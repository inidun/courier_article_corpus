Was there really
a
BIG BANG?
by Jayant V. Narlikar
WHAT do we know about the
origin of the Universe? If
today an opinion poll were
to be conducted on this question, a
great majority of astronomers would
agree with the view that the Universe
came into existence in a gigantic explo¬
sion that took place some 10 to 15 thou¬
sand million years ago.
This conventional view, commonly
known as the "Big Bang" theory, has
it that at the moment of origin the
Universe was infinitely dense and in¬
finitely hot but as it expanded in all

directions, it cooled and became less
dense. Soon after the Big Bang, there
formed from its debris the basic
building blocks of matter which later
developed into large astronomical units
that we recognize today as stars, galax¬
ies, clusters of galaxies and so on.
Although the Universe is still
expanding as a result of that initial Big
Bang and all the galaxies are moving
away from one another, the ferocity of
the initial explosion is no longer present
now, nor is the universe very hot or
very dense. Its overall temperature is
estimated at about 270 degrees Celsius
(Centigrade) below zero, while an
average cubic volume of a million
kilometre size is believed to contain no
more than about one kilogram of visi¬
ble matter.
Cosmology is the branch of science
concerned with the study of the large
scale structure of the Universe, its
origin and its evolution. Like other
parts of astronomy (and of science in
general) cosmology has its share of
controversies and, if history is any
guide, the majority view has not always
prevailed. For, in the last analysis
speculations, however popular, have to
give way before hard facts.
The Big Bang scenario described
above has grown over the years out of
a series of plausible speculations based
on a comparatively few hard facts. But
do we have the guarantee that in this
scenario we have at last found the
answer to the ultimate question that
man has been attempting to grapple
with since time immemorial? Have we
reached the level of sophistication
needed to understand the origin of the
Universe?
Opinions differ amongst scientists
on this question. There are those who
feel that with the unification of all the
basic forces of nature in sight, the "end
of physics" is not too far away. For
them the cosmological problem is also
near its solution. I share the more
pessimistic (and more realistic?) assess¬
ment of English astronomer Sir Fred
Hoyle who said in 1970:
"I think it is very unlikely that a
creature evolving on this planet, the
human being, is likely to possess a
brain that is fully capable of under¬
standing physics in its totality. I think
this is inherently improbable in the first
place, but, even if it should be so, it is
surely wildly improbable that this
situation should just have been reached
in the year 1970".
With these reservations in mind one
can ask if the presently popular Big
Bang scenario is the only plausible one
for the origin and evolution of the
Universe.
The discovery that the Universe is ex¬
panding was made by the American
astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889-1953)
in 1929. Hubble's original observations
have since been repeated with greater
accuracy and out to greater distances,
and these have confirmed the view that
the space in which the galaxies are
embedded is expanding. The rate of ex¬
pansion of the Universe at any given
epoch is measured by a constant H,
commonly known as Hubble's
constant.
Given the fact that the Universe is
presently expanding we need a dynamic
theory to tell us what it did in the past
and what it will do in the future. Ein¬
stein's General Theory of Relativity is
the simplest and most suitable theory
available today for this purpose.
Models of the Universe based on this
theory lead us to the concept of the Big
Bang origin. According to these models
the density of the Universe and the
Hubble rate of expansion would be
found to be higher and higher as we
probe the history of the Universe fur¬
ther back in time, so much so that at an
epoch a finite time ago both these
quantities were infinite. This is the Big
Bang epoch.

Age of the Big Bang Universe - minimum 6.6
Age of the Big Bang Universe - maximum 13.3
Age of the Earth 4.6
Ages of Galaxies 15
Ages of Globular Clusters 18 Ages expressed in 1,000 millions of years
Because of the present uncertainties in
the value ofHubble 's constant, the age of
the Big Bang universe Is believed to lie
between 6,600 million and 13,300 million
years. This age range can accommodate
the age of the earth but not of the older
galaxies or globular clusters.
Physicists normally become sus¬
picious of the validity of their
theoretical framework if it leads them
to infinities like this. Einstein's theory
makes the situation even worse because
it links the density and the motion of
matter with the geometrical properties
of space and time. At the Big Bang
epoch, therefore, it is impossible to
define these properties. This total
breakdown of physical and mathe¬
matical descriptions has led to the Big
Bang epoch being called a "singular"
epoch.
The appearance of this singularity is
more a reflection on the in¬
completeness of our understanding
than a description of physical reality.
The singular epoch is identified with
the origin of the Universe. The law of
conservation of matter and energy
breaks down at this epoch since all the
matter (and radiation) present in the
Universe would have to be created at
this time.
Cosmologists define the age of the
Universe as the time elapsed since this
epoch and this has been worked out by
using the reciprocal of Hubble's con¬
stant (in other words by "working the
sums out backwards") to calculate how
long it would take for the Universe as it
is now to contract back to the time of
the Big Bang.
Although astronomical observations
today cannot give the value of
Hubble's constant accurately, the
model universe currently most
favoured by cosmologists and particle
physicists working together gives an
upper limit for the time elapsed since
the Big Bang of between twenty thou¬
sand million and ten thousand million
years.
These calculations are based on an
idealized model of an empty universe.
The presence of matter, however, tends
to slow down the expansion of the
model universe and to reduce its age. If
there is enough matter in the real
Universe to slow down its expansion to
a momentary standstill followed by
contraction (as the most widely ac¬
cepted version of the Big Bang theory
predicts), then its present age cannot be
more than two-thirds of the theoretical
calculation of the time elapsed since the
Big Bang. In other words, the age of the
Universe must be somewhere within the
range of 13.3 to 6.6 thousand million
years.
Large though this age is by human
standards, it is not so large in the
astronomical context. The age of the
Earth is 4.6 thousand million years.
The age of our Milky Way Galaxy is
variously estimated at 10 to 15 thou¬
sand million years. The ages of certain
large clusters of stars, called the
globular clusters, are even higher, at 17
to 18 thousand million years. It
therefore seems that if all matter were
created in the Big Bang it is simply im¬
possible to accommodate most of these
astronomical systems within the time
span available.
It is clear that these problems arise
because of the so called "origin" of the
Universe. Are there models of the
Universe without an origin, models in
which the Universe is infinitely old?
For such models one has to go beyond
the more conservative framework of
Einstein's general relativity.
In 1948 Hermann Bondi, Thomas
Gold and Fred Hoyle proposed a new
model of this kind. Known as the
"Steady State" model, it described a
universe which is ever-expanding,
without a beginning and without an
end. As its name implies, the density of
matter in this model is held at a steady
value. How can a system expand and
yet retain the same density? This result
is achieved in the Steady State model by
the injection of new matter continuous-

In the expanding steady state universe
galaxies like A, B, C, D, move apart when
observed from an earlier to a later epoch.
Newgalaxies (filled circles) are created to
fill the space generated by expansion so
that the universe as a whole does hot
change from the earlier to the later epoch.

ly. It is possible to give a mathematical
formulation of the creation process
without violating the law of conserva¬
tion of matter and energy.
Despite its many attractive features
the Steady State model came under a
cloud in 1965 with the discovery of a
radiation background in microwaves,
by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson.
The challenge to the model posed by
this observation does not appear so for¬
midable today as it did in the late 1 960s,
however. In fact, as I propose to show
below, the interpretation of this radia¬
tion as the relic of the Big Bang has
come up with some unexpected
difficulties.
The Penzias-Wilson discovery of
microwave radiation was hailed as the
strongest proof that the Universe has
come out of a hot Big Bang. The
reasons for this belief were: (i) the
observed radiation is extremely
smoothly distributed and hence does
not show any patchiness which would
be expected had it come from a large
number of isolated sources; (ii) the
radiation appeared to have a spectrum
very similar to that of the idealized
black body. [A black body is an
enclosure containing objects which
emit and absorb radiation continually,
with no radiation escaping from the
enclosure or entering it from outside.
Theory tells us that such a system set¬
tles down to a definite pattern with
prescribed intensity of radiation at
prescribed wavelengths.]
Both these features were expected
from the Big Bang models of the
universe. The radiation therefore came
to be recognized as the relic of the early
hot era in the history of the Universe.
There are, however, some difficulties
with this interpretation.
One difficulty is that the observed
spectrum is not exactly that expected
from a black body. There are small
departures from the black body spec¬
trum which cannot be ignored. This
result was pointed out by D.P. Woody
and P.L. Richards in 1980, and has re¬
mained an awkward point for the Big
Bang model ever since.
The second difficulty lies in the ex¬
traordinary smoothness of the back¬
ground itself, and it shows up in two
ways. The first problem is concerned
with smoothness on a small scale. If, as
is advocated, the radiation is the relic
of an early hot phase, then it should
show some imprint of the changes that
the Universe went through after that
phase. As we mentioned right in the
beginning, an important change that
took place in the composition of the
universe was the formation of galaxies.
Thus the matter distribution developed
dumpiness and some of it should have
been reflected in the background radia¬
tion. That no such dumpiness is seen
after repeated searches is a worrying
matter for Big Bang cosmologists.
The second way in which smoothness
poses a problem is known as the
horizon effect. When we survey the
universe out to large distances we see it
as it was in the past: because light, by
which we see distant objects, travels
with a finite velocity. Thus if the
universe is ten thousand million years
old, we can see objects out to distances
of ten thousand million light years (1
light year is the distance travelled by
light in one year). However, the radia¬
tion background formed when the
universe was hardly 300,000 years old.
At that time regions separated by more
than 300,000 light years would not have
been in contact with one another since
their fastest means of communication,
(the light ray) would not have been able
to bridge the gap between them. The
present large scale smoothness of the
radiation background on the other
hand implies that such remotely
separated regions were very similar in
structure and behaviour. Without
physical contact how was this similarity
achieved?
While the Big Bang cosmologists
engage in theoretical speculations
about the early history of the Universe
to figure out these mysterious proper¬
ties of the microwave background, I
cannot help feeling that the solution
may lie in an entirely different direction
and that the microwave background
may not, after all, be of relic nature.
The Universe is indeed full of radia¬
tion backgrounds at all wavelengths,
ranging from radio waves right up to
X-rays and gamma rays. With the ex¬
ception of the microwave background,
all are known to be of relatively recent
origin, with no possible connexion with
the hot post-Big Bang era. Why single
out the microwaves?
Fred Hoyle, Chandra Wickrama-
singhe, V.C. Reddish, and others (in¬
cluding this author) had argued in the
late 1960s and the early 1970s that the
microwave radiation could be a recycl¬
ed form of other radiation mainly com¬
ing from stars. Dust grains in the in-
tergalactic space, if present in very
modest proportions, would be able to
do the recycling. N.C. Rana has recent¬
ly worked out the details of how such a
process would operate. Indeed, if a
plausible explanation of the microwave
background can be found along these
lines, the case for a Big Bang
cosmology is considerably weakened
and the Steady State theory can be
revived.
This is one of the possible unconven¬
tional alternatives to the Big Bang
scenario, and I mention it here to em¬
phasize the fact that the cosmological
problem is far from being settled yet.
Just as better telescopes early in this
century expanded man's view and con¬
ception of the Universe in an unex¬
pected direction, so I hope, the observ¬
ing techniques of future years will fur¬
ther widen the cosmologist's vista
dramatically.
