W
hen I was young I used to think that
most people were beautiful. Th i s
belief does not reflect an excessively
benevolent view of humanity, o n l y
the fact that I am blind. I assumed
that the majority of people around me must be
beautiful because I could see nothing wrong with
t h e m . But to have nothing wrong is to be merely
a v e r a g e,o r d i n a r y,p l a i n .Beauty is rare,and like most
rare things, desirable and precious.
Although I still don’t know what beauty looks
like, I now know a lot about it; at least I know the
things people say. I gather that youth is generally
assumed to be more beautiful than age, and that
regular features and symmetrical forms are prized.
And the eyes are always crucial, always the focal
point of the ideal look.But it is not enough just to
have youth, symmetrical proportions and lovely
e y e s. Every culture in every age admires certain
traits and disparages others. Particular body types
and body parts are esteemed; the size and shape of
facial features, and the colour of skin, hair and eyes
are all assigned relative values.An American beauty
today might have less appeal in A s i a , and probably
would have been considered too thin a century ago.
Even within the same culture,individual preferences
play a role. On numerous occasions I have heard
friends debate the relative beauty of common
acquaintances and public figures, and have always
been struck by how rarely everyone agrees.
Beauty is easy to recognize and hard to define.
People spend a lot of time talking about it, and a lot
of money and energy trying to achieve it.And the

Beauty and the blind
A blind writer offers a piercing look at our penchant for staring at
“beautiful people” and wonders why we so rarely agree on who 
belongs to this club
3 . ESCAPING DESTINY
Reading society’s gaze.

blind are not exempt . From childhood we, and our
caretakers, are bombarded with advice about the
need for good grooming,physical fitness and tasteful
a t t i r e. But for us the goal is not merely to make the
most of whatever attractions we might possess, b u t
to make ourselves visually appealing to others in
order to dispel the expectation that the blind are
always indigent and helpless. In other words,we are
encouraged not to become more beautiful, but to
look less blind. I recognize that new clothes or a new
haircut will make me feel good about myself. This
will show in my face and may counteract the
discomfort my blindness rouses
in others.
Inviting attention
S t i l l , in a world where
the vast majority of the
blind are
u n d e r e d u c a t e d
and under-
e m p l o y e d , I
think that
p e r s o n a l
a p p e a r a n c e
should be t h e
least of our
w o r r i e s. All the
advice we
r e c e i v e a b o u t
our looks only
r e i n f o r c e s the idea that blindness
is unsightly, best kept concealed in
homes and institutions.
Once I met a blind man who
always wore extremely vivid colours,
school bus yellow, safety orange,
electric green. I knew this because,
like many blind people, I have
some residual vision, i n c l u d i n g
colour perception. This man
however was totally sightless, with
no direct experience of the colours
he wore. It was his mother who
chose them for him when he was a
child so he would be more visible to motorists.As an
adult he continued the practice because,as he said,
“if people are going to stare anyway, I might as
well make it worth their while.”
It is no secret to the blind that people stare at us.
We can hear the hush that comes over a room when
we enter. We can feel heads turn, then turn away,
then turn back to stare. People believe they can
stare at us with impunity because we cannot see
their fixed gaze and thus will not be offended by
their scrutiny. People also stare at the beautiful,
and in a sense get away with it, because beautiful
people seem to invite the attention.Does this mean
that the blind are beautiful? 
Certainly, blind women in movies are usually
b e a u t i f u l :Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark a n d
Uma Thurman in Jennifer Eight, to name only two
e x a m p l e s.But their friends seem to feel that beauty
is wasted on the blind woman because she is so
unconscious of it.She cannot see her reflection in the
mirror or the impact her appearance has on others,
so her beauty is somehow muted or effaced. True
b e a u t y, at least in movies, is not merely on the
surface but is enhanced and magnified by an inner
awareness of others’ admiring gaze.
In fact, I have observed that people have a way
of letting me know they’re beautiful even though I
c a n ’t see them. They project a self-assurance
that shows they have always been
accustomed to attention and favourable
t r e a t m e n t .This quality does not feel
the same as vanity or arrogance; I
have met beauties who were
quite modest. They do not
necessarily take credit for
their beauty,but bear it with
the good grace of the
recipient of a surprise gift.
Nature’s freaks
S t i l l , beauty remains a mystery
to me.A person can have all the
prescribed characteristics and
still not be beautiful. Beauty
requires something extra, a n
element of surprise, even
n e a r- v i o l e n c e. B e a u t y
arrests the gaze,
catches the breath
and stops the
h e a r t . Beauty is
an anomaly, a n
improbable freak
of nature that so
many idealized
qualities should
occur in a single
i n d i v i d u a l .
Beautiful people complain that potential friends
a n d l o v e r s are intimidated by their looks and that
potential employers doubt their intelligence.
They should spend more time with the blind
because we have much in common.We too know
what it’s like to create a sensation when we walk
down the street. We know how it feels to be
judged for our appearance alone. And while we
cannot display the admiring gazes the beautiful
have come to expect, we also will not detect the
pimples and wrinkles they fear will spoil their
b e a u t y.And our view of them will remain constant
long after the rest of the world tells them they’r e
