Montreal’s netizen news-vendors
The Quebec newspaper L ’ I t i n é r a i r e offers homeless
people an e-mail address in a former hairdressing
salon which has been turned into a cybercafé. I t ’s an
annexe of the Café sur la Rue (The Café on the Street),
which has been open for the homeless and other needy
people for more than a year.The vendors of the monthly
L ’ I t i n é r a i r e— C a n a d a ’s first newspaper for street people,
which was launched in 1994 and focuses on social
issues—go there for a cheap bowl of soup and to pick
up their copies.The “ c a m e l o t s,” as they are called, b u y
them for 65 cents each and sell them to the public for
double that.
The Café sur la Rue opened its Internet annexe last
October—a kind of high-tech office with a dozen
computers. A few homeless people are quietly busy
there but most of the customers are people from the
neighbourhood or hard-up students. One is typing out
his CV, others are playing games, replying to e-mail,
taking part in an online discussion or looking for a job
on the Web.
The place is nicely decora t e d . On its sandy-coloured
walls are literary quotes such as “Greed starts where
poverty ends”by the French writer Honoré de Balzac,a n d
coloured drawings including a long blue wave breaking
at eye-level.

with donations—of time by decorators from Radio

F i f t y - f o u r- y e a r-old Lise has been on welfare for
the past 25 years. “It does me good to come here,”
she says. “ The day goes by more quickly.” Th e
computers scared her at first, but now she loves
them.So much so that she comes every day to clean
the place up and greet new customers. When her
“volunteer job”allows her the time, she sends an e-
mail to a friend or reconstructs the “puzzle”she has
created in the computer around a photo of her
daughter and granddaughter.
An Internet course for beginners
“ The hardest people to attract in here are the
h o m e l e s s,” says Langlais. New technology frightens
t h e m , even when free training is offered to the least
educated among them.“Street people are not necessarily
uneducated and uncultured,” he says. “Despite their
personal problems,t h e y ’re interested in lots of things.Th e y
want to know what’s going on, in politics or sport, f o r

Watchdogs for the homeless
Like Harri s ,m a ny of those who run street
n e w s p a p e rs have chosen a middle way. In St.
Pe t e rs bu r g, for example, the fortnightly N a
D nye (in Russian, The Lower Depths, f r o m
the title of Maxim Gorky’s play) tries to
combine professionalism and political
s t ru g g l e .“ To attract young readers and boost
s a l e s ,which fell after the rouble was deva l u e d ,
we carry news about trendy clubs, music and
a rt ,” s ays its founder,Va l e ry Sokolov.
The paper has a page for articles wri t t e n
by homeless people, and two-thirds of its
space is taken up with social issues. “ L a s t
N ove m b e r ,we exposed the fact that the police
were expelling homeless people from the
c i t y,” he say s.“ E ve ry  Tu e s d ay and  T h u rs d ay,
they took groups of 20 or 30 about 40 km out
of town and dumped them in the forest where
the temperature was minus 18°C. We have
asked for an inquiry into this.” B e t ween 2,000
and 4,000 of St.Pe t e rs bu r g ’s 50,000 homeless
people die eve ry ye a r.
“With such dreadful things going on,
our differences seem trivial,” says Young.
“ We have to act in concert to attack abu s e s
and set up a worldwide watchdog to defend
the rights of the homeless.” n

At the Bonneau Reception Center,which serves hot
m e a l s,“they gave an Internet course for beginners,”h e
s a y s. “Since then, a Romanian guy has stopped by
regularly to get news about his country from the Net.
Another homeless person, who wasn’t interested in
a n y t h i n g , developed a passion for online newspapers.”
The cybercafé’s goal is the same as that of the
newspaper, which gets some financial help from the
g o v e r n m e n t . It aims to demarginalize the poorest
p e o p l e, m a ke them feel wa n t e d , give them some
training and some experience of voluntary or paid
work,in the hope it will lead them back into society.
Some American psychologists say access to new
technology can be a kind of do-it-yourself therapy for
people who are depressed and can help them to
regain their self-confid e n c e.The cybercafé also helps
to build in street people and the unemployed a “ s e n s e
of belonging” to the “big family” of L ’ I t i n é r a i r e, s a y s
the paper’s editor,Alain Demers.
But the river that divides this sheltered environment
from the job market is still hard to cross. Only rarely
does anyone really manage to cross the divide. n
