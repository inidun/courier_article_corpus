Oceania
A Unesco travelling exhibition
reveals the creative talent
of the Pacific islanders
The "Unesco Courier" presents
on the following pages different
aspects of "The Art of Oceania",
the eleventh travelling exhibition
organized by Unesco in its pro¬
gramme for the international cir¬
culation of cultural works. The
exhibition, a vivid artistic "por¬
trait" of the enormous scatter of
islands in the Oceanic zone of
the south Pacific, will be display¬
ed in different parts of the world
after being first shown in Sydney,
Australia, in May 1975. It was
compiled by the author of the
article published here. New Zea¬
land anthropologist Dr. Roger S.
Duff, Director of the Canterbury
Museum, Christchurch, New Zea¬
land, in association with Stuart
Park, Director of the Otago Mu¬
seum, Otago, New Zealand. The
Unesco exhibition was designed
by the Austrian graphic artist
Freimut Steiger, who has also ex¬
ecuted the layout of these pages
devoted to the art of Oceania.
Oceania's
10.000 islands
The power and beauty and variety of
the applied arts of Oceania are an
expression of the creative genius that
can be shown by even the smallest
and most isolated of human commu¬
nities.
No one who has studied the region
can fail to be impressed by the
settlement of the successive zones of
Oceania, which was essentially a series
of one-way voyages Into the outer
space of the world's greatest ocean.
The region is divided here into three
great cultural areas: New Guinea-Mela¬
nesia, from West Irian to New Cale¬
donia; Micronesia, from Palau to the
Gilberts; and Polynesia, so vast that
Its west-east axis runs from Fiji to
Easter Island, its north-south axis from
Hawaii to New Zealand.
Throughout the region there was
"no sort of iron" (to quote Cook, the
British explorer, referring to the Poly¬
nesian Tahitians of 1769), and we
constantly marvel at the technical
achievement of Oceanic material cul¬
ture in a world without metal.
Pottery was absent over the greater
part of Polynesia and Micronesia, re¬
maining viable only in or within reach
of the chain of the continental rock
clays of Melanesia. In those many
atolls without stone the basic carpen¬
ter's adze blade had to be ground
down from the shell of the giant reef-
clam.
Agriculture was at the pre-cereal
stage, without plough or oxen, and
husbandry was without grazing animals
of any sort. The coconut had originally
to be brought in by canoe and planted
out along the barren strand. So too
was the breadfruit, the paper mulberry,
the banana, the sugar cane, the taro
lily, the sweet potato, the Lagenaria
gourd and others.
It might be said that the Oceanic
peoples were "castaways", miraculous¬
ly able to survive on desert islands.
In the world context the cultures of the
islands of Oceania are seen to be an
extension of the Austronesian Neolithic
of south-east Asia in the second or
third millennia B.C.
The Malayan language complex
remains as the most enduring evidence
of this expansion today, representing
the world's largest cultural area of a
common language, linking Madagascar
(Malagasy), Malayo-Indonesia, the Phi¬
lippines, Formosa, Melanesia, Micro¬
nesia and Polynesia.
While excitingly vtried and of often
macabre artistic power, the applied
arts of New Guinea-Melanesia reflect
the assumed Austronesian prototype
somewhat fitfully. For this we need to
turn to the two remaining areas, Micro-

k nesia and Polynesia, where the original
Austronesians found their way to empty
islands, on which they could establish
viable cultural offshoots.
The word which most adequately
characterizes New Guinea-Melanesia
is "diversity" in language and in way
of life. In New Guinea alone there are
some 500 entirely different languages,
one-sixth of all the languages spoken
in the world. In some parts a group
would be unable to understand the
speech of their neighbours in another
valley only thirty kilometres away.
From island to island, from coast
to highlands and from valley to valley,
the dress, housing, art and ideas of
the people can differ markedly. Yet in
all this diversity, one finds certain
themes and Ideas which are wide¬
spread: the importance of pigs as a
food item, a source of wealth and of
prestige; the attitudes to the dead, who
are believed to play an important role
In the lives of the living; and the conti¬
nual struggle for power, whether this
be through warfare, through oratory
or through the acquisition of wealth.
The earliest human occupation in
New Guinea has been dated to around
25,000 B.C. The earliest dated expan¬
sion of peoples into the other Mela-
nesian islands comes at about 3,000
B.C.
Most of the archaeological work
in Melanesia to date has concentrated
on the study of pottery, and especially
on a particular type of pottery known
as "Lapita" ware, after the site in New
Caledonia where it was first excavated.
Lapita pottery has usually been recog¬
nized by the distinctive style of
impressed decoration it bears, but the
fabric of the ware itself can be distin¬
guished from other types of pottery,
so that it is possible to recognize
"plain" Lapita.
Archaeologists have been particu¬
larly interested In the makers of Lapita
pottery because it is believed that they
are responsible, at least in part, for
the origin of the Polynesians. They
seem to have moved through the Mela-
nesian island chain between about
1200 and 200 B.C., living in coastal
areas or on offshore islands.
There is still considerable schol¬
arly debate over the exact route taken
by the settlers of Polynesia. While
the Lapita potters are certainly ances¬
tral to the later Polynesian peoples,
there is also very strong evidence that
people bearing elements of Polynesian
culture entered the Pacific by means
of the northerly route through Micro¬
nesia.
Because the great majority of the
islands are small coral atolls, Microne¬
sia is properly called the cultural area
of "small islands". Life in the low
atolls was a constant struggle for exis
tence, made tolerable only by the main¬
tenance of trade contacts through the
development of the fastest and most
advanced sailing canoes in Oceania.
The key lay, of necessity, in the
absence of timber large enough to
sacrifice for a dug-out hull, in lashing
small planklike pieces edge to edge
in carvel style to produce a knife-edged
hull. This, with an outrigger float to
windward and a balance platform to
leeward, needed only the reversible
sail rig to become the fastest sailing
platform in the world.
The same skills of precision joinery
were applied to the houses of Micro¬
nesia. Dwelling-houses were roomy
and functional, while the ceremonial
houses of Palau and the western
islands could seat several hundred
people. The handsome Palau club¬
houses (rubak-bai) set on foundations
and framework of adzed beams, had
front and back porches protected by
shaped and painted boards. Boat-
houses were an important third class
noted for spaciousness and elegance.
One of the most distinctive cultural
links between eastern Micronesia and
Polynesia is the legend of the culture-
hero Maui, the ancestor of "a thousand
tricks", who fished up Islands. What
was thought to be his original fish¬
hook was the subject of dispute by
the ¡slanders. Polynesian fish-hooks
and harpoons undoubtedly came from
Micronesia.
The name Polynesia ("many Is¬
lands") is hardly adequate to describe ^
the enormous scatter of islands within r

Pacific island canoes
Polynesia. Suspended in the void of
the Pacific Ocean, its western and
eastern borders equidistant from Asia
and America respectively, its southern
boundary midway between equator and
pole, the Polynesian "triangle" with its
scattered Islands occupies the most
inaccessible part of the habitable world
and the last to be settled by man.
As in Micronesia, this settlement
was made possible only with the dev¬
elopment in south-east Asia of stable
sailing canoes, with a sail rig enabling
them to' beat Into the prevailing trade
winds, which, for that majority of Poly¬
nesian groups lying south of the equa¬
tor, blow from the south-east.
This northern ocean highway could
well have been the route of entry of
those cultural complexes exclusively
shared by Micronesia and Polynesia,
shown in canoes and navigation, fish¬
ing devices, houses and house furnish¬
ings, canoe sheds, tattooing, basic
costume styles of breech-clout and kilt,
and in austerity in applied art.
For pottery, which became perma¬
nently established in Fiji and which
was present in Samoa as early as the
first millennium B.C. and in use for a
thousand years in Tonga, we must look
to the earlier island-hopping route, the
southern route skirting the northern
borders of New Guinea and Melanesia
to the Santa Cruz group now seen to
be emerging as a key staging-point,
and with Fiji as the point of entry into
Polynesia.
All skilled craftsmanship, from
house-building to tattooing, was car¬
ried out by a class of experts known
as tohunga (or the dialect variants of
this New Zealand Maori term).
In the more favoured groups of high
islands in tropical Polynesia, elegant
houses were built on a pole-and-thatch

fabrication. Everywhere boat-sheds
matched the dwelling-houses. Houses
were set aside as schools of learning
(whare wananga) in the Cook islands
and New Zealand.
While dwelling-houses were small
and low in New Zealand to keep out
the winter cold, community houses
were built on a grand scale, of adzed
planks, the wall plates carved in relief
effigies of ancestors, the rafters painted
in decorative volutes. House furnishings,
were confined to head-rests, bowls forr
Polynesian and Micronesian fish-hooks
commemorating a legendary hero, Maui,
who fished up islands out of the sea.

The mast-head and steering paddles
of Fijian canoes of the early nineteenth
century recall the double-canoes: up
to thirty-five metres long, with mast of
eighteen metres, steering oars eleven
metres long and deep enough for men
to walk upright between hold and deck.
They took up to five years to build and
needed a boat-shed as large as the
hangar for a jet passenger plane.
Through centuries of life on the
sea, Polynesian pilots (Tohunga Tau-
tai) had developed surprising skill in
navigation, based largely on star know¬
ledge, notably of zenith stars, which
enabled them to fix latitude. Cook's
Tupaea could at command, on a clear
night, indicate the position of Tahiti,
then thousands of kilometres distant.
The loom was absent in Polynesia:
it found a counterpart in the remarkable
development of bark cloth from the
inner bark of the paper mulberry
(Broussonetia papyrifera) and bread¬
fruit (Artocarpus), original imports
from south-east Asia which were
carefully cultivated in all Islands where
they would grow. For the cloth,
a favourite West Polynesian decorative
device was to produce a colour rub¬
bing by placing the plain material over
a design tablet with detail in relief, and
one illustration from Tonga shows an
early-twentieth-century version of a
phonograph.
In body decoration, the practice of
tattooing (known to the world from its
name of Tatau) was virtually universal
in Polynesia, body coverage being
greatest in the Marquesas and New
Zealand.
With a people as preoccupied by
genealogical descent as the Polyne¬
sians, various efforts were made to

The word tattoo is of
Polynesian origin and the
practice of tattooing the body
was once virtually universal
in Polynesia, the pigment
being pricked into the skin
in a variety of patterns with
bone-chisels tapped with a
light mallet. In Samoa
youths are still tattooed
today on attaining manhood.

preserve the mortal likeness of the
deceased. Maoris succeeded in pre¬
serving the hair and features by steam,
heating the head in an earth oven.
Marquesans covered the skull with
bark cloth, painted to represent the
tattooed face. Easter Islanders repre¬
sented ancestors by sculptured wood¬
en figurines representing emaciated
men and women past child-bearing
and the sole wooden sculpture known
from the Chatham Islands emphasizes
the ancestor's protruding ribs and col¬
lapsed stomach.
Rivalry among clan and family
groups in erecting commemorative
sculptures of ancestors seems one
reason for the giant images of Easter
Island, which have attracted world
attention and given rise to theories of
an introduction from South America. A
more cautious theory is to regard the
practice as an elaboration of the East
Polynesian complex of the courtyard
temple (marae) found in all tropical
groups from the Cook Islands to
Hawaii.
Under population pressure the
needs of competing tribes inevitably
led to warfare, which became endemic
in Fiji, New Zealand, Easter Island and
the Marquesas in particular. Chronic
warfare was associated with canniba¬
lism, head-hunting and the use of the
enemy bones for fish-hooks and utili¬
tarian utensils.
To meet the preference for hand-to-
hand combat, weapons comprised
wooden spears, a class of spear-clubs
used like a quarter-staff, two-handed
clubs, wooden daggers and the one-
handed stabbing club (patu) of New
Zealand and Easter Island.
By tacit agreement the bow was
outlawed in warfare; it was used in
Tahiti only in archery sport and in
Samoa for shooting birds and .rats.
The unwieldy size of the standard club
from the Marquesas reminds us of the
frequently ceremonial nature of Poly¬
nesian warfare, where nominated cham¬
pions decided the issue in single com¬
bat before an audience of dancing
supporters.
