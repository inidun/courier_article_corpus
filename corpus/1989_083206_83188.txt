LIBRARIES TO
MANUSCRIPTS are unique and
fragile things, which are still far
from being protected as part of
the national heritage, despite the fact that
they are the focus of widespread interest.
Although their importance may be ac¬
knowledged, the resources allocated to
safeguard them are in many cases slender.
And yet collections of manuscripts are
surely just as much a part of any nation¬
al heritage as the monuments which states
pay large sums of money to preserve, as
the works of art amassed by museums,
and the areas of outstanding natural beau¬
ty which are protected by their status as
national parks.
Seeing the creative impulse
at work
The literary, scientific, social or po¬
litical history of a people can only be
written objectively if it is based on the
original sources, and those sources are
manuscripts or archival documents. In¬
deed, one meaning of the word "source"
is precisely that of "original document".
Manuscripts are the lifeblood of history.
In them it is possible to trace the develop¬
ment of writers and their work, the lives
of statesmen, the manifold activities of
peoples. Their value is impossible to cal¬
culate, and even if it is perceived as rela¬
tively slight in the world context, within
each culture and each country it is
absolute.
National libraries have long under¬
stood the importance of this heritage, es¬
pecially since manuscripts constitute
natural additions to their holdings and
form part of their mission to acquire,
preserve and provide access to printed
works. Although not all national libraries
possess a manuscripts department as such,
most wish to acquire private archives and
to safeguard them as far as their means
permit.
Such collections enable those engaged
in literary research to consult in one place
the documentation on a writer, ranging
from drafts and manuscripts to printed
editions of his or her work, as well as
reviews in newspapers and magazines, ra-

This late 2nd-century manuscript of the Book
of Isaiah (detail above) is one of the famous
Dead Sea Scrolls. With several other
remarkable biblical manuscripts, it was
dio and television interviews, records, let¬
ters, notes of all kindsin order to follow
the evolution of a work or its creator, and
to see the creative impulse at work. These
primary sources are particularly in¬
dispensable because only they are entire¬
ly reliable, since secondary sources are
too often marred by errors which are
then repeated and multiplied from one
edition to the next. The French political
philosopher Montesquieu wrote in his
Lettres persanes (Persian Letters, 1722) : "I
have a little room full of very precious
and very dear manuscripts; although I
ruin my eyesight reading them, I much
prefer to use these rather than printed
works, which are less reliable...". Final¬
ly, the existence of complete collections
of manuscripts makes possible the prepa¬
ration of critical editions and the discov¬
ery of unpublished material.

Faced with such confusion, a second
question springs to mind: what role can
and should be played by national
libraries? From the legislation which
created them and from the nature of their
mission, it is clear that these institutions
enjoy a stability and permanence that,
theoretically, guarantee the sound
management of the heritage of printed
works entrusted to them. However, na¬
tional libraries, like other institutions, are
at the mercy of the fluctuations of the
economy. But conservation remains their
primary purpose and is generally en¬
shrined in the legal provisions of their
mandate. This is why budget cuts or staff
reductions have less impact on conserva¬
tion policies than on other library
activities.
The task of conservation necessarily
leads national libraries to hire highly
qualified staff and acquire highly special¬
ized equipment to ensure that their col¬
lections will withstand the ravages of
time. Their activities include rigorous
control of atmospheric conditions, the
deacidification of books and documents
and of their containers, the reproduction
in facsimile or on microfilm or
microfiche of those which are at most
risk of deteriorating, and the elimination
of external threats.

Qumran, on the site of a monastery destroyed

The role of national libraries
The importance of public archives
has long been widely taken for granted.
If we accept that private archives are
equally deserving of preservation, then a
fundamental question arises: who should
be responsible for preserving them? So
far, few countries have come up with a
very satisfactory solution to this problem,
as indicated by the number of manuscript
collections that are still dispersed. Regret¬
tably, conflicts even arise between nation¬
al archives and national libraries,
university libraries and public libraries,
and the private libraries of foundations
and associations.

As well as taking these costly and es¬
sential measures, national libraries must
acquire manuscripts to complement their
collections of printed works. It is small
wonder, therefore, that they have always
taken a keen interest in the development
of manuscript collections, even setting up
special departments for the purpose. This
trend was, and still is, part of the logical
evolution of their responsibilities, a path
from which they cannot stray without
detrimental consequences both at the na¬
tional level and worldwide.
This does not necessarily mean cen¬
tralization at all costs. Modern technolo¬
gy provides long distance and virtually
instantaneous access to the reproduction
of a document and to information relat¬
ing to it. Data banks that can be consult¬
ed at any time have become part of daily
life, as has the transmission of images or
texts. This new technology should allow
national libraries to accept an even greater
measure of responsibility for
manuscripts, since their primary aim is
to encourage consultation and even co¬
ordination among depositories of private
archives. They should act as advisers to
other libraries and provide technical and
financial support where necessary, so that
the national collection of manuscripts,
even if dispersed around a country, may
be preserved in the best possible condi¬
tions, and be well catalogued and univer¬
sally accessible.
Through their direct or indirect con¬
nections with the government, to which
they are largely accountable, national



libraries should also try to make the
authorities aware of the value of the writ¬
ten heritage, and induce them to adopt
appropriate legislation and regulations.
Much still remains to be done in this
direction, if only in the form of tax con¬
cessions granted by several countries to
donors, legatees or even sellers of
manuscripts.
A universal heritage
Bodies such as the International Fed¬
eration of Library Associations and Insti¬
tutions (IFLA) cannot, for their part,
abdicate responsibility for national collec¬
tions of manuscripts, which are all too
often threatened. Like areas of outstand
ing natural beauty, these collections
represent riches that all humanity has a
duty to preserve; together, they consti¬
tute a world heritage on whose behalf
Unesco and its member states should
adopt the measures that are urgently
needed.
Manuscripts should be recognized
forthwith as part of our universal
heritage, and countries should sign a
declaration undertaking to provide the
legislative, financial, human and techni¬
cal support necessary for their preserva
tion. Each national library should
establish its priorities and defend them in
its relations with governments and inter¬
national organizations.
