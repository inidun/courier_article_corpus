Rw a n d aÕs collective a m n e s i a
◗ Benjamin Sehene
Christianity tried to destroy the collective memory of Rwandans. 
After independence, ethnicity became the yardstick of identity and the Tutsis we re
d e m o n i zed. Then came the horrors of genocide.
I
n Kigali, they are known as b a f u ye bahaga ze— t h e
living dead.They are the hundreds of thousands
of surv i vo rs of genocide who have psychologi c a l
p r o b l e m s. In September 1994, I met one of them—
a little girl called Élise, the only member of her
family who had survived. She was just under five
years old,the same age as the civil war in Rwanda,
which went on from 1990 to 1994.
Élise suffered from loss of memory and had a ve ry
l ow attention span. She could never remember my
first name. She had no recollection of anything that
had happened more than 20 minutes before—it wa s
as if she was trying to protect hers e l f. One evening I
found a way of getting her to remember my name.
She wore ove rsized pyjamas and I said,“Think of the
word ‘ p y j a m a ’e ve ry time you see me—pyjama-Ben-
j a m i n .”W h e n e ver she saw me after that , she wo u l d
happily shout:“ H e y, wa i t ,i t ’s pyjama-Benjamin!”
Like that little girl clinging to an image,Rwan-
dans should perhaps look for a common symbol
which could unite them around their lost memory.
For centuri e s ,R wandan civilization rested on a
pyramidal power structure which was rooted in
my t h s. It shaped the economy and conditioned
social relations. It built (and still builds) a tyranny
based on hierarchy, but a hierarchy imbued with a
sense of restraint.In an atmosphere of self-censor-
ship and silence, things are left unsaid—betwe e n
parents and children, husbands and wive s , s h e bu j a s
(bosses) and their b a ga ra g u ( s e rvants) and betwe e n
Tutsis, with their sense of superiority, and Hutus,
who feel inferior.
Severing links with the past
But the establishment of Chri s t i a n i t y, w h i c h
began with the arri val of missionaries in 1900, d e s-
t r oyed Rwa n d a ’s collective memory. In 1931, t h e
Church deposed Musinga, the Tu t s i s ’ last divine-ri g h t
m o n a r c h , when he refused to be conve rt e d .C o nve r-
sion to Christianity would have undermined his legi-
t i m a cy and destroyed the meaning of the magical and
r e l i gious functions of the monarchy, the pillar of
R wandan society.All the traditions which made up the
c o u n t ry ’s social and spiritual fa b ric were dubbed
pagan rites and banned, despite the fact that they fos-
tered social cohesion by bri n ging together the three
ethnic gr o u p s — H u t u s ,Tutsis and Twa s.
The abolition of the A b i ru s, the royal committee
of wise men that was the official guardian of the
s o c i e t y ’s collective memory and its esoteric ri t e s ,
marked the end of the only high-level institution
that acted as a counterweight because it was made
up mostly of Hutus. A proverb in the Kinya r wa n d a
language was coined to describe this break with the
esoteric past:Kerezia ya kuyeho kizira (the Church
has forbidden the forbidden).
After independence in 1962, the new republic of
R wanda tried to ove rt u rn the traditional pyramid-
shaped power stru c t u r e ,d e s t r oyed even more of the
traditional sense of national identity and wiped out
the nat i o n ’s collective memory.The republic defin e d
its identity by abolishing the old order,which it regar-
ded as being too strongly marked by centuries of Tu t s i
m o n a r c h s , and by basing its legi t i m a cy on the majo-
rity ethnic gr o u p, the Hutus.
E ve rything with a Tutsi connotation was ban-
n e d .Thousands of words rooted in Rwa n d a ’s his-
tory and social organization were struck out of the
l a n g u a g e .The ethnicization of the stat e ,s u p p o s e d l y
to create a “social balance”, led to a quota system
which limited the proportion of Tutsis in higher edu-
cation and the civil service to nine per cent.It was
based solely on numbers. Pe o p l e ’s ethnic affil i at i o n
could be checked from their identity documents.
The new ru l e rs said they were redressing the social
balance after centuries of feudal domination.
In the vacuum left by the collapse of the tra-
ditional collective memory, ethnicity became the
only point of reference.This eventually led to the
demonization of the Tutsis in order to justify their
exclusion from society. The Tutsis were dehuma-
nized and dubbed inyenzi (cockroaches), just as
the Nazis had called German Jews “vermin”.
Many terms of abuse were used to indicate they
were unwanted parasites. It is easier to crush a
cockroach underfoot than to kill a person.
The “social revolution”which gave birth to the
new Rwandan republic began in 1959 with a
bloody revolt by the Hutus, involving the terrible
massacre of 20,000 Tutsis and the flight of thou-
sands of others into Burundi and Uganda.This irr e-
parable act was the first step towards the descent
into amnesia.But a past that is forgotten is bound
to repeat itself because forgetting invo l ves a refusal
to admit wrongdoing. In Rwanda, amnesia led to

The country lived for 35 years in a
state of growing amnesia,
dominated by the law of silence,

c o l l e c t i vely re p re s s e d

s u c c e s s i ve pogroms against the Tutsis which began
in the 1960s and ended in the genocide.The coun-
try lived for 35 years in a state of growing amnesia,
d o m i n ated by the law of silence, of the unspoken, o f
m e m o ries collectively repressed. Silence inevitably
gave rise to impunity and impunity made amnesia
acceptable.
I had a hard job interviewing Tutsi survivors in
1994 because the genocide divided Rwandans into
two camps—Hutus and Tutsis,the perpetrators of
genocide and the rest. In Rwanda today, you are
forced to be on one side or the other; there is no
h a l f way house. Just after the genocide, the Tu t s i s
who returned were suspicious of Tutsis who had
e s c a p e d , presuming they had collaborated with the
enemy to save their skins.
If you were a Hutu, you were automatically guilty
of genocide, just as the Tutsis were from 1959 to 1994
considered guilty just because they happened to be
Tu t s i . The genocide was a crime committed bet-
ween neighbours ;k i l l e rs and surv i vo rs of the at r o c i-
ties still live side by side today.The exterm i n ation of
a million people in 100 days with crude weapons like
m a c h e t e s ,c l u b s ,a xes and hoes,could not have taken
place without the part i c i p ation of a massive number
of people.A third of all Hutus are thought to have par-
t i c i p ated in one way or another.
Fear of reprisals
About 135,000 people suspected of invo l ve m e n t
in genocide are languishing in ove r c r owded jails, a n d
the legal system, which was destroyed in the pro-
v i n c e s , is finding it hard to get the trials underway.T h e
I n t e rn ational Criminal Tri bunal for Rwanda (the
A rusha Tri bu n a l ) ,which has scant resources, is not get-
ting ve ry far either.All this is keeping Rwandans from
the task of remembering their past, especially since
s t at e - e n d o rsed ethnic attitudes still condition the
Hutu killers to think they killed their historic neigh-
b o u rs to ensure the surv i val of their own ethnic gr o u p.
To d ay, the guilty flatly deny there was any genocide.
So in one of A f ri c a ’s most densely populat e d
c o u n t ri e s , the surv i vo rs see their torm e n t o rs return i n g
to live peacefully on the hillsides because there is not
enough evidence to bring charges against them. In the
first months after the genocide witnesses spoke freely,
but they have become tight-lipped since a number of
s u rv i vo rs have been murdered by unknown killers.
“ W h at ’s the use of giving evidence?” one victim
asked me. “ T h e y ’re not being punished any way.”
All Rwandans live in an atmosphere of ethnic mis-
t ru s t . Fear of reprisals is still ri f e .
The new Rwandan authorities may want to curb
individual score-settling and encourage nat i o n a l
r e c o n c i l i at i o n ,but the ragtag soldiers who carried out
the 1994 massacres are still lurking in the forests of
n e i g h b o u ring Congo and have not gi ven up their
plans to exterm i n ate the Tu t s i s.As long as the threat
of a new genocide hangs over Rwa n d a , the present
r e gi m e ’s pri o rity will be to defend national frontiers ,
as shown by the on-going war in Congo.
The present is still barring the way to memory.
