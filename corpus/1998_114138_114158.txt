One of India’s most celebrated and controversial
film-makers is driven by an obsession with creative
freedom
You were born in India, studied in the
United States and now live in South Africa.
Where is home?
I left India when I was eighteen ye a rs
old and then divided my time between the
United States and India for about ten ye a rs
before meeting my husband in Kampala,
Uganda, during the shooting of Mississippi
Masala. Now we have been living in South
Africa for the last two years. I travel a lot
due to professional reasons but I make my
home where the family is, where my
husband and child are.
Why did you decide to go into cinema?
Your films seem fired by a strong sense of
social justice.
I was not one of those people who knew
they would be making films from the age of
eight. I fell into cinema, and then became
possessed by it. I started as an actor,
committed to fairly radical experi m e n t a l
t h e at r e , street protest theatre and relat e d
t h i n g s. I was also a good student, a n d
suffered under the illusion I might have
become an academic. I received a full
s c h o l a rship to study at Harvard Unive rs i t y
when I was eighteen and went to purs u e
my interest in theat r e . But once there, I felt
the theatre at the unive rsity was too
conventional, too staid,compared to what
I had done in India. I also grew impatient
with the lack of control one has an actor.
Actors are always at the mercy of directors
and their vision of the wo r l d . I wanted to be
the one in control—telling the story,
controling the light, the gesture and the
frame. Creative freedom is imperative for
me.
Making independent films is an
o b s e s s i ve task—having an idea, w riting the
s c ri p t , finding fin a n c e , c a s t i n g, s h o o t i n g
and editing. Then comes the big stru g g l e
to make sure the film is distri bu t e d
throughout the wo r l d . All of this could
easily take one or two ye a rs. In order to live
with a project eve ry day for two ye a rs I have
to be obsessed by it.I can only make films
about subjects that get under my skin and
make my heart beat faster. I am not in the
business of producing films which offer a
pleasant way of filling a Sunday afternoon.
T h at is for others to do, and I don’t dismiss
i t . But I am attracted to ideas that will
provoke people and make them look at the
world a little differently—stories that come
from my part of the world.
I do have a pri vate agenda, I suppose, t o
resist the cultural imperialism of
H o l l y wood by putting people like ours e l ve s
on screen. It is an enormous validation to
see people on screen who look like us in
India or elsewhere in the South. We must
tell our own stori e s , because nobody else
is going to do it for us. I must say I enjoy the
responsibility of exploring and portraying
these stories through fil m - m a k i n g .After all,
fil m , unlike academia, reaches millions.
This is another dimension of my wo r k
which I really enjoy—the ability to reach
so many people. Yet at the same time, I
d o n ’t forget or underestimate the individual
viewer in the audience.
Why focus on communities and individuals
living in exile and what have you learned
about cultural identity and racism? Why do
Indian communities in exile, for example,
feel the need to keep to the fringes of
society?
I seem to be getting some sort of
reputation for making films about exile. I
d i d n ’t choose this, it chose me. D i s t a n c e
from a community is something which used
to confuse me but now I use it as a tool for
my films.
I suppose I understand that state of
b e i n g, and know what it feels like to look
outside a motel window in Mississippi and
see my garden in Kampala. You can fin d
yo u rself on the other side of the world and
yet still find a reminder or link to home.Ye t
I don’t suffer from nostalgia or
h o m e s i c k n e s s. I think of myself as someone
with a huge appetite for the world and as a
gr e at lover of people. I find this gr e at
commonality between people.Yet ignorance
and fear—the two hallmarks of racism—
blind us to it.
W h at was especially moving about
being in Mississippi to shoot my film was
t h at I found black families—with their
closeness and church and singing and
b a r b e c u e s — were actually so much like the
Indian families that seemed so remove d
from that community even though they
l i ved just across the highway. The Indian
community was doing the same things,
believing in similar values to those of the
black community.Yet the Indians imagi n e d
the blacks to be not quite as human or the
same as them.
Indian communities living abroad form
their own circle, perhaps to maintain a
c e rtain cultural and sometimes religi o u s
p u ri t y. In the process, they become more
frozen in their “ I n d i a n n e s s ” than those
living in India. By doing so, they also
s y s t e m atically exclude themselves from
i n t e gr ation with the local communities.
When I went to Kampala to make
Mississippi Masala, some Indians we r e
s u rp rised to see that I am not as “ I n d i a n ”a s
they expected.
Your films explore paradoxes by 
showing how, for example, the slave
becomes the master. Wh e re does this
insight come from? Do you draw on your
observation skills as a documentary 
fil m - m a ker or on your intuition?
I have an eye and ear for paradox.That
is life.The grey area where no one person is
less or more virtuous than the other. Fo r
me the truth is far more interesting, fa r
more strange,than fiction.
This is where cultural specificity comes
i n . You do extensive research about a
theme, feel it and then create a story that
I can only make films
about subjects that get
under my skin and make my

could become unive rs a l . Ty r a n ny is the
absence of complexity, as Gide said. A n d
complexity is interesting to explore in film
instead of constantly looking for the lowe s t
common denominat o r. I believe in
i n t u i t i o n . I follow my intuition absolutely in
finding and developing stories to tell. For
m e , there are subjects which just seem
obvious to explore. For example, I once
made a documentary called Children of
Desired Sex, an Indian euphemism for
people wanting only male children, t h e
desired sex. The documentary set out to
explore how amniocentesis,the procedure
i nvented to test the genetic balance of a
c h i l d , was being abused in a horri fic
manner in India as a test for women to
ascertain the sex of their unborn child. If
the foetus was female,they would abort.
Mississippi Masala: an Indian family migrates to the United States.
The censorship problems
aside, I do believe that
women film-makers have
access to some people and
subjects which men do not
But finding a subject is not enough.T h e
trick is to create a work situation in which
intuition is allowed to reign.
Many people who spend years abroad
benefit from a certain distance when
returning to their countries of origin.
They are able to critically observe their
native societies, without necessarily
passing judgment. Perhaps this distance
helps to explain the clarity in films like
Salaam Bombay! Yet it may also bring you
opposition. How do you respond to
accusations that you are trying to sell
India’s poverty? 
I choose subjects which touch me. I am
not the first one to be accused of selling
I n d i a ’s pove rt y. The gove rnment accused
e ven the renowned film-maker Sat yajit Ray
of the same thing. After seeing S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! I don’t think anybody can say that
it is a film that gr atuitously shows the
depression and misery in India.The mov i e
c e l e b r ates the surv i val of the human being in
the face of all the odds. In day to day life, a n
individual does not notice such things.A l s o,
m a ny of us in our lives—instead of coping
with the inequities of existence here—
become blind and numb.Yet looking away
from reality does not make it disappear.
The same thing happened with K a m a
S u t ra. I didn’t hide sexuality behind veils or
d a n c e s. Indian commercial films are alway s
filled with sexual innuendoes and obscene
songs about “ w h at is under the blouse”. I n
fa c t , sexuality in Indian cinema is cloaked
in rape and violence. In my fil m , I wa s n ’t
t rying to shock but tell the story straight,
without hiding behind illusions or pretence.
The irony is that we come from a culture
which had regarded love and sexuality as a
link to the divine. It was an art to be learn e d
and yet to be treated as a matter of fa c t .
Do you think Kama Sutra generated
even more controversy because
it was made by a woman? What
possibilities or pitfalls face a female 
film-maker?
Films port r aying sexual subjects are
bound to attract problems with the censors.
But you cannot imagine the troubles that lie
in wait if a woman director attempts to
focus on them. Before making the fil m ,
e ve ryone told me that I would have
problems but I never imagined that I wo u l d
be dragged through the courts for almost
two years! After going through all kinds of
legal battles with the Indian censors h i p
board and gove rn m e n t , I knew that the
attacks were particularly vehement because
I am a woman.
The censorship problems aside, I do
b e l i e ve that women fil m - m a k e rs have
access to some people and subjects which
men do not. For example while making my
film India Cabaret which dealt with the live s
of female stripteasers in Bombay, I could
enter their lives in a rather comprehensive
way. I even managed to visit the houses of
the men who frequented these cabaret
joints and talk to their wives.
Kama Sutra felt like an experiment. Was it
an attempt to shift from being a
documentary film-maker to being an art
film-maker?
While I was working in documentary I

The ‘tough sister’
nMira Nair took the film world by storm
with her first feat u r e , Salaam Bombay !, i n
1 9 8 8 . Coming from a country which
produces more feature films than any other,
she proved that even art movies can be
commercially successful. Her film career,
which started in 1979, has brought her
global accolades and at the same time fie r c e
criticism at home.
The youngest of the three children of a
civil serva n t , Nair was born in 1957 in the
city of Bhubaneshwar in eastern India.
Although watching movies at the local
cinema was one of her early interests she wa s
p a rticularly captivated by theat r e , which she
studied (along with sociology) at the
U n i ve rsity of Delhi. In Delhi she became
i nvo l ved in political street theatre and
p e r f o rmed for three ye a rs in an amat e u r
drama company before setting out for the
United States on a fellowship in 1976 to
study drama.
Disillusioned with the conservat i ve
theatre programme at Harvard University,
she was soon drawn to documentary film-
m a k i n g . Her decision gave her the
o p p o rtunity to work with three leading
fil m - m a k e rs , Alfred Guzzeti, R i c h a r d
Leacock and  D. A .Pe n n e b a k e r. S e ven ye a rs
after gr a d u ating she had made four
documentaries exploring ‘‘the culture and
traditions of India and their impact on the
lives of ordinary people.’’
G r e atest recognition came with S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! a film which, she say s , ‘‘ p o rt r aye d
the reality of children who are denied a
c h i l d h o o d , children who surv i ve on the
streets with resilience, h u m o u r , fla m b oya n c e
and dignity.’’ Before shooting, Nair and her
s c ri p t w ri t e r , Sooni Ta r a p o r e va l a , a college
f riend and a nat i ve of Bombay, conducted a
three-month workshop with 30 street
c h i l d r e n , all of whom then performed in the
f e ature fil m . Salaam Bombay! won 23
i n t e rn ational awards including the Caméra
d’Or and the Prix du Public at the 1989
Cannes Film Fe s t i va l . In the same year it
r e c e i ved an A c a d e my award nomination as
Best Foreign Language Film. Nair is proud
of it. ‘‘Especially for our children and for
I n d i a , since it’s the first nomination we ’ ve
had since 1957, the year I was born .’’
The “ Kuskoo Didi” (tough sister), a s
the street children called her, made sure
they get long-term benefit from S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! She put the bulk of their salaries in
a bank account,and with some of the fil m ’s
profits she and her colleagues established
“Salaam Balak Tru s t ” , a non-profit
o r g a n i z ation that provides homeless
children with educat i o n a l , medical and
vocational services.
After making Kama Sutra :A Tale of Love
( 1 9 9 7 ) , she battled with the Indian censors
for eighteen months before it could be
released and shown in cinema halls across
the country. ‘‘The censor board wanted to
cut out eve rything vaguely sexual, cut it
beyond recognition.I had to go all the way
to the Supreme Court of India to release
my film.’’
Nair now lives in Cape Town (South
A f rica) with her husband Mahmood
M a m d a n i , a political scientist, and their
young son Zohran. Her interest in the
themes of identity, culture and exile
c o n t i n u e s. Faithful to her own pers o n a l
tradition she is currently preparing for yet
another trans-continental move. n

Filmography 
Nair’s key productions:
My Own Country (1998): The story of an
Ethiopian-born Indian doctor treating A i d s
and HIV patients in eastern Tennessee in the
mid-1980s comes to realize that the
epidemic is a spiritual as well as a medical
emergency.
Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love ( 1 9 9 7 ) : A
sumptuous exploration of the friendship and
r i valry between a princess and her serva n t

teachings of the Kama Sutra, an ancient
treatise on love and sexuality, as weapons
in their complex relations and the men in
their lives.
The Perez Family (1995):Romantic tragi-
comedy about the Mariel boat people who
left Cuba for Miami,USA,in 1980.
The Day the Mercedes became a Hat

Salaam Bombay! ( 1 9 8 8 ) : The director’s
first feature film is also her most famous.
Detailing the lives of Bombay’s street

the characters were portrayed by children
living on the streets, including Chaipu who
played the lead.
Documentaries include:
Children of a Desired Sex ( 1 9 8 7 ) :
explores the conflicts facing pregnant
women who decide to undergo abortions
after learning that they bear female foetuses.

lives of female strippers in a seedy Bombay
nightclub.
So Far From India (1982): examines the
s e p a ration between an Indian newspaper
seller living in New York City and his wife

Jama Masjid Street Journal ( 1 9 7 9 ) :
N a i r ’s first film was part of her student thesis
project and draws on her personal
experience of exploring life within a
t raditional Muslim community in Old Delhi
from the perspective of a Western-educated
Indian woman.
often became impatient when I had to wa i t
for something to happen and then not
h aving it happen like I hoped it wo u l d . I
wanted to have a lot more control ove r
gesture and drama. So I shifted to feature
films.The challenge in a feature film is to
capture the sense of the instantaneous
moment of a documentary. D o c u m e n t a ri e s
h ave a certain edge as events seem to unroll
before the camera. This is difficult to
convey in the controlled environment of a
feature film.
My gr e atest challenge in Kama Sutra
was to be faithful to myself and to make a
film about strong women who are not afraid
to celebrate their sexuality and have found a
way to love fully. Another challenge was to
c r e ate a world that felt real. Not to creat e
one mired in exotica and anthropology, bu t
one that felt so local that it became unive rs a l .
I wanted to address the lack of
u n d e rstanding or thought about what is
genuinely Eros and how we should be
prepared to handle Love . I think I succeeded
in showing how Eros perm e ates eve ry d ay
l i f e .
The film is not targeted at any
p a rticular audience. I t ’s for the wo r l d .
Perhaps this ambitious goal proved to be a
problem for me, but it was a good lesson.
Although I achieved what I wanted to in
the visual and sensual qualities of K a m a
Sutra,I felt that the story suffered.
Film-making is a journ e y, like any other
work of art.You make films and hope that
the end product is what you wa n t e d .
Sometimes you achieve that and sometimes
you end up with something different.
How did Indian women viewers respond to
Kama Sutra?
When the movie was released in India
last year I made contractual obligat i o n s
with the distributors that there should be
m atinee screenings thrice a week for
women only. In Indian cinemas, 90 per cent
of the audience are men. I did not want my
female audience to be harassed or
i n t i m i d ated by men’s presence, so I insisted
on these all-women screenings. It made
women feel safer and made it easier to see
my message.
It is a myth that Indian women do not
want to know about intimate love. In fact,
the film was a gr e at hit and wo m e n
frequented the theatres all over the country.
It was among the top three commercially
successful movies in India last year.
How do you find finance in a developing
country where there is hardly any support
for art movies?
I am lucky that my films actually make
money for those who invest in them. For me the
most important thing is to have complete
independence while making a mov i e .Yet it is
ve ry difficult to find finance for my kind of wo r k
in India. T h at ’s why I rely on a mix of
i n t e rn ational distri bu t o rs , mostly from Ja p a n ,
Europe and some in India. I don’t take the whole
sum from one person or company because that
would invo l ve a lot of constraints and
d e p e n d e n c e . I would have to make a mov i e
according to the needs and interests of the
financier instead of making a film that is mine. I
think you have much more freedom with $6
million raised independently than $50 million
from a single studio.
Do you consider film-making to be a cultural
industry or an art form justifying and requiring
state support?
As an art form , films do need support . Fo r
e x a m p l e , it would not have been possible for me
to make my first feature film without support
from India’s National Film Deve l o p m e n t
C o rp o r at i o n .We get to see lots of good mov i e s
from Australia where the state supports the
i n d u s t ry. Ideally speaking, a movie should be able
to support itself,but I still believe in some form of
assistance or subsidies, especially for first fil m s.
India produces the largest number of commercial
films in the world, with 
its own version of Hollywood referred 
to as Bollywood (Bombay). Yet the 
country fails to produce good art film directors.
Why? 
I wo u l d n ’t say that Indian directors lack
talent. It is simply that they lack opportunities.
Basically you have to struggle for yo u rself to fin d
finance for your movies in India. Unless the
financier is sure about making profit s , he will
not support the project. Second, there is a big
problem in distri buting fil m s. I know many cases
where movies are made but never seen because
there aren’t any distri bu t o rs for art fil m s. I t ’s not
t h at Indian audiences aren’t interested in seeing
independent films.The problem lies in the lack
of theatres committed to showing them.
What next?
I am now working on a movie called B o m b ay
2 0 0 0, which I suppose I could call my firs t
B o l l y wood fil m , but on my own term s. I t ’s about
a city going global, about the relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween a mother and daughter and an
A m e rican hustler who enters their live s. T h e
mother was a legendary film actress in the old
B o l l y wood and now dubs Bay watch [an
American television series] into Hindi.And her
daughter is a starlet in current super-slick
Bollywood films. n
