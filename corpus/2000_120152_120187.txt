“Without mobile phones, violence would
have been rampant in Senegal during
the presidential election,” according to observ e r s
who monitored the poll in February and March
2000.
This may seem an excessive claim. And yet
mobile phones had already won their spurs in
the battle over the results of local elections in
November 1996. Senegal’s interior minister was
caught out when he admitted in a low voice near
an open mobile phone that there had been fra u d .
As a result, President Abdou Diouf was forced to
annul the election.
In the presidential election in 2000, mobile
phones forced the two candidates, President Diouf
and Abdoulaye Wade, to accept the results that
were announced almost instantaneously by private
radio stations.
The two main stations, Wal Fadjri FM and Sud
FM, had sent reporters to cover polling stations all
over the country. Equipped with mobile phones—
a new work tool which is largely replacing the
tape-recorder—they were able to announce the
results as soon as the votes had been counted. The
presence of reporters was boosted in key con-
stituencies with a large number of voters or where
there was a particularly hard-fought contest.
This organized presence of journalists and the
speed with which the results were announced
facilitated the peaceful handover of power from
Diouf to Wade. No fraud was possible. The out-
going president conceded defeat very quickly for
an election in Africa. This defused the tension that
had built up before the second round of the
election and the much-feared clashes betw e e n
supporters of the two political leaders were
avoided.
And, by the way, the Sud FM reporters had to
buy their mobile phones on monthly credit. ■
