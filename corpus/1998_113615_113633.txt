Should drugs be tolerated, legalized or prohibited? The debate takes on
new proportions with the growing use of illicit substances
The war on drugs is a fa i l u r e .D e c l a r e d
by the United States in 1983 and
taken up by the intern at i o n a l
community in 1989, the objective was to cut
off the consumer countries of the North from
the producers of illicit drugs in the South,
which are the targets of an increasingly
e x p e n s i ve crackdow n . The United Stat e s
alone increased funding for this war from
$4.7 billion in 1988 to $12.3 billion in 1993.
Yet the participants in the United Nat i o n s
General Assembly Special Session on the
World Drug Problem, which took place in
New York from 8 to 10 June 1998,came to the
conclusion that never before have such vast
amounts of illicit substances been on the
market at such low pri c e s , which are reliable
i n d i c at o rs of ove rp r o d u c t i o n . Repression that
focuses exclusively on supply—cultivat i o n ,
production and trafficking—is a continuat i o n
of a Cold War mind-set that viewed the wo r l d
as divided into “good guys”and “bad guys”.
The blatant failure of that approach has led
to the search for new strategies. Nowadays
e ve ryone more or less agrees that drug users
are at the heart of the problem, but solutions
remain to be found.
The special session in New York was an
o p p o rtunity for renewed debate betwe e n
advocates of prohibition and supporters of
l i b e r a l i z at i o n . Such discussions among
e x p e rts are often difficult for the public at
large to fat h o m , especially because of the
confusion between the two major concepts
involved:decriminalization of drug use and
legalization of drugs themselves.
The three United Nations conventions on
n a r c o t i c s ,which provide a framework for the
i n t e rn ational prohibition system, l e ave room
for interp r e t at i o n .The authors of these accords
h ave always contended that , unlike measures
t h at target drug supply, steps to curb dru g

Drugs: surveillance

“ u s e ” — fall within the sovereignty of each
member stat e .The 1997 World Drug Report
produced by the United Nations Drug Control
P r o gramme (UNDCP) stated that ,“None of
the Conventions requires a party to conv i c t
or punish those who commit such offences
[ a c q u i ri n g, possessing or consuming dru g s ] ,
e ven when they have been established as
p u n i s h a b l e ; a l t e rn at i ve measures may also
substitute for criminal prosecution.” In line
with this,s i g n at o ry countries to the conve n t i o n
h ave developed a wide arr ay of responses to
d rug use. In some countries of the European
Union such as France and Luxe m b o u r g, f o r
e x a m p l e ,p e rsonal drug use is against the law,
while others , such as Spain, only prosecute
d rug use in public places and possession with
intent to sell.D rug abuse or addiction should
increasingly be dealt with not by putting users
behind bars but by court-ordered rehabilitat i o n
( w h at might be called a therapeutic injunction)
within the framework of treat m e n t
p r o gr a m m e s. But major differences pers i s t
b e t ween drug rehabilitation systems. At the
same time, l aw enforcement officials
overwhelmed by the scope and increasing
s o p h i s t i c ation of drug trafficking are often
tempted to crack down on casual users in order
to achieve tangible results, thus filling pri s o n s
without disrupting the illicit trade.
This is the context in which the advo c at e s
of decri m i n a l i z ation are increasingly making
their voices heard. They recommend
l e g a l i z i n g, instead of prosecuting, t h e
possession of small
amounts of dru g s
intended for pers o n a l
u s e . The idea is gaining
ground in the European
Union, but in the rest of
the world the trend is
towards a harder line on
possession and use to try and stem the ri s i n g
tide of drug addiction, especially in the South
where it is a recent phenomenon.S o m e t i m e s
u s e rs are even sentenced to death for the
possession of a few gr a m s. Its support e rs say
that decriminalization is just one part of an
overall risk reduction policy.They argue that
it would be futile to try to eliminate the use
of illegal dru g s , which is inherent in our
s o c i e t i e s , without getting at the roots of such
problems of the modern world as loneliness,
u n e m p l oyment and other forms of economic
and emotional distress.
A b s t i n e n c e ,which is the aim of prohibition,
must therefore not be the main goal bu t , i n
the words of Dutch specialist Henk Jan Va n
V l i e t , “the final objective in a hierarchy of
o b j e c t i ve s.”The highest pri o rity is to implement
a policy that would help users kick the habit
when they decided to, not just when a judge
ordered them to.Such an approach,s u p p o rt e rs
a r g u e , would minimize the margi n a l i z at i o n
and health hazards stemming from drug taking.
The emergence of Aids and the spread of HIV
infection among heroin addicts,who inject the
d ru g, is a major argument in favour of this
a p p r o a c h .M a ny gove rnments with repressive
policies have been compelled to allow ove r -
the-counter sales of needle kits before setting
up drug substitution
p r o gr a m m e s.S w i t z e r l a n d
and the Netherlands are
e ven experimenting with
the distri bution of heroin
i t s e l f, as a way of keeping
a d u l t e r ated and dubious
products off the market
while breaking up the relationship betwe e n
user and dealer.
Another basic argument in favour of ri s k
reduction is the distinction between soft and
hard dru g s. The form e r , p ri m a rily the
cannabis deri vat i ves hashish and mari j u a n a ,
are not considered very harmful.The latter,
including heroin, c o c a i n e , a m p h e t a m i n e s
and other synthetic dru g s , c a rry
“ u n a c c e p t a b l e ” ri s k s. At present, T h e
Netherlands is the only country with
l e gi s l ation based on that distinction,a l t h o u g h
a scientific report handed in to France’s junior
minister of health in June 1998 made
headlines by asserting that “cannabis has no
n e u r o t ox i c i t y ” and “from that point of view,
is completely different from alcohol, c o c a i n e ,
ecstasy and psychostimulants.”
The Dutch exception is a model for ri s k
reduction advo c at e s. C o n t r a ry to popular
b e l i e f, the possession of drugs for pers o n a l
use is against the law in The Netherlands.B u t
the possession and sale of less than 30 gr a m s
of cannabis deri vat i ves has been tolerated since
1 9 7 2 .T h at has gi ven rise to the 200 or so
coffee shops where users can legally purchase
and consume hashish or mari j u a n a .The last
point is exactly where the risk reduction
p rinciple encounters the fiercest opposition.
The UNDCP stresses that “most of the
arguments advanced in the name of ri s k
reduction are compatible with a flexible
i n t e rp r e t ation of the prohibition policy.” B u t
in the case of  The Netherlands, the step
t owards de facto legalization of cannabis seems
to have been taken.This is a step the United
N ations refuses to recommend.
The legalization of drugs would simply
consist of allowing substances that are today
illicit to be freely sold. A c t u a l l y, it would be
difficult to find an anti-prohibitionist who
would advo c ate such a radical solution.A more
a c c u r ate term to describe what they favo u r
would be controlled legalizat i o n . In other
wo r d s , narcotics production and distri bu t i o n
would come under state control along lines
t h at could be compared to the way opium wa s
produced and distri buted in the form e r
European colonies.The pro-legalization camp
includes figures as va ried as liberal economists,
legal expert s , d o c t o rs , p s y c h o l o gists and
s o c i o l o gi s t s. They do not advo c at e

c o n s u m p t i o n ,but contend that adopting their
position would help fight cri m e .
They reason that drugs must be legalized
to limit the enormous costs of repression as
it is currently carried out; to depri ve
c ri m i n a l s , p r o h i b i t i o n ’s only benefic i a ri e s ,
of a substantial source of reve n u e ; and to
reduce public health costs by guaranteeing
the quality of the
products and by raising
t a xes that would be used
to fund dru g
r e h a b i l i t at i o n
p r o gr a m m e s.
The advo c ates of
prohibition reply on
technical and moral
gr o u n d s. H ow would the legal sale of dru g s
be organized? Who would sell them? Doctors ,
who would become “ d e a l e rs in white coat s ”
and prescribe products that have no
therapeutic value? To whom would they be
sold? If only to adults, then how would we
p r e vent a black market intended for minors
from developing? Should cannabis be the only
legalized drug? Organized crime networks are
so adept at switching from one illicit substance
to another,depending on trends and markets,
t h at all drugs would have to be legalized.L a s t l y,
they argue,the organized suicide and poisoning
by a state of its citizens would be an admission
of powe r l e s s n e s s.
C l e a r l y, the debate over anti-drug policies
raises extremely complex questions.And the
arguments voiced do not even take account of
the narcotics market’s global dimension.T h e
extremely inadequate data that fuel the debat e
only take into account the situation in we a l t hy
c o u n t ri e s.But the South cannot be left out.I t
would be hy p o c ritical to talk about legalizing
the consumption of
cannabis in Europe while
c riticizing a producer
c o u n t ry for not doing
a nything to eliminat e
illicit crops that prov i d e
a livelihood for entire
p o p u l at i o n s. And how
can we talk about
consumption while ignoring the millions of
new users who have appeared in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries in recent ye a rs? Lastly, “ ri s k
r e d u c t i o n ” cannot be mentioned without
tackling the relationship between the explosion
of the Aids epidemic in southern A f rica and
the abuse of alcohol, the We s t ’s “legal dru g ” .
One thing is clear: the time has come for a
widespread debate based on rational studies
r ather than prejudices and taboos that , in the
final analysis, help romanticize drugs and,
c o n s e q u e n t l y,boost their power of at t r a c t i o n .
