Right after South A f ri c a ’s second democratic elec-
tions in June 1999, the newly elected President
Thabo Mbeki appointed eight women to minis-
t e rial positions,double the number in the first gove rn-
m e n t . The country ranks seventh in the world in
t e rms of women parliamentary representat i ves (25 per
c e n t ) , while the South A f rican constitution and the
A f rican National Congress (ANC) gove rnment have
entrenched gender equality as a key political va l u e ,
s i g n i ficant achievements on a continent where wo m e n
are all too often regarded as secondary citizens.
The moral support of leaders such as Oliver Ta m b o
and Nelson Mandela notwithstanding,wo m e n ’s gains
result from a we l l - a rt i c u l ated strategy that took shape
within the ANC well before its 1994 electoral victory.
With a transition to democracy in progress in the early
1 9 9 0 s , this strategy focused sharply on representat i o n
i s s u e s. In 1991, women within the ANC demanded a
quota of seats on the National Exe c u t i ve Committee.
They fa i l e d , but in 1994, the ANC was the only part y
to adopt a 30 per cent quota of women on its electoral
l i s t s.When the ANC started drafting the Reconstru c-
tion and Development Progr a m m e , the backbone of
its electoral manifesto,wo m e n ’s groups within the part y
lobbied hard for it to address their concerns regarding
e m p l oy m e n t ,health and land ow n e rs h i p.This lobbying
was bolstered by a powerful grassroots movement that
shared the aim of making South A f rica a non-racial,
but also a non-sexist democracy.Women from all wa l k s
of life formed a National Coalition in 1992, which tur-

ned gender representation into a multiparty concern .
A c c o m p a nying the dri ve to get women into power wa s
an emphasis on getting them out to vote through tar-
geted campaigns.
Opposition from traditional leaders
Once in government, women were influential
in drafting the constitution, adopted in 1996.The
task was not always easy. Even though the coun-
try touted itself as a non-sexist democracy, in
pushing for the insertion of an equality clause,
women ran into strong opposition from several
traditional leaders, including some within the
political fold of the ANC, who argued that it
conflicted with the protection of custom and tra-
dition.Strong political lobbying efforts by women
MPs such as Mavivi Manzini, Baleka Mbete and
Thenjiwe Mtintso undercut the arguments of the
traditional leaders.Women MPs were also instru-
mental in getting clauses included on reproducti-
ve rights as well as socio-economic rights.
Most women who entered Parliament in 1994
were committed to advancing the rights of South
A f rican women—an inevitable source of tension
when their positions came into conflit with those of
their respective part i e s. S t i l l , a number of routes
were pursued to break through this ‘ l oya l t y ’d i l e m m a .
By far the most successful structure for adva n c i n g
wo m e n ’s rights has been the Joint Committee on the
I m p r ovement of Quality of Life and Status of Wo m e n .
Grouping women from across party lines, this par-
l i a m e n t a ry committee consults with wo m e n ’s orga-
n i z ations in civil society and has played a cri t i c a l
role in proposing and fast tracking legi s l ation so that
it is put on the roll for debat e .Had it not been for this
c o m m i t t e e , it is more than likely that several fa r -

women would not have been passed. In part i c u l a r ,t h e
Te rm i n ation of Pregnancy Act provides women with
access to abortion under significantly broader and
more favourable conditions than in the past. T h e
Maintenance Act of 1998 substantially improves the
position of mothers dependent on child support
from their former part n e rs.Free health services have
been provided for pregnant women and children
under the age of six.The 1998 Domestic Violence A c t
was important in sensitizing the judiciary to the fa c t
t h at violence within families was a public mat t e r.
The committee has also stood behind a budget ini-
t i at i ve which analyzes how different ministries allo-
c ate resources specifically to benefit wo m e n .
These gains are laudable. But despite the
significant number of women in cabinet—many
of whom come from an activist background —
they have been unable to oppose cutbacks in
social service spending or increases in arm s
expenditure (the deputy minister of defense is a
Quaker and head of the ANC’s women’s parlia-
mentary caucus). And although health minister
Dr Manto Tshabalala is a woman and longtime
gender activist, she has not supported women’s
organizations’ demand for the HIV/Aids drug
AZT to be offered to pregnant women and rape
survivors.1 The government has argued that the
option is unaffordable, a position not necessarily
held by women within the ANC, nor, for that
matter, by the opposition.
Securing leadership positions
in political parties
In the 1999 election campaign, no party ques-
tioned the principle of gender representation.
Instead, the focus shifted to specific policy issues
such as violence against women, unemployment,
housing and health care, with national television
and radio allotting air time to debate the positions
held by the competing parties. Women activists
pointed out that despite the formal commitments
to gender equality, political parties failed to outli-
ne policy positions on key gender issues. For
example, not one party had a policy with regard
to dealing with violence against women despite
the fact that South Africa has one of the highest
incidence of rape in the world.
These interventions during elections highlighted
the need for women to become significantly more
organized within political parties and to hold lea-
d e rship positions within them.This will gi ve wo m e n
MPs the support they need to become even more
e f f e c t i ve within the legi s l at i ve arena, but also ensure
that internal party mechanisms exist to hold them
accountable to women members and not just part y
leadership. Joyce Piliso-Seroke,chairperson of the
Commission on Gender Equality, has commented
t h at a long climb remains. The gove rn m e n t , s h e
s a i d ,“talks the talk of gender equality, without wa l-
king the walk.The Domestic Violence and Main-
tenance Acts will remain just so many words unless
i n f r a s t ructure and human resources are provided to
make them effective.” ■
