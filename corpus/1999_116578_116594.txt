Ve n i c e: coping with 
c u l t u re vultures 
w Antonio Paolo Russo
Inundated with visitors,Venice is now trying to scare some of them off.
But there are better ways of rescuing the city from tourism
Beauty bears its bu r d e n s , and in tourism no
place illustrates this more clearly than Ve n i c e .
So popular a destination has it become that
t o u rism has created a crisis of economic, s o c i a l ,
demographic, but perhaps above all, cultural pro-
portions. However,it need not be so.
For ye a rs now,Venice has in many ways failed to
l i ve up to its romantic image. The centre is so
c r owded one can hardly move , shops offer low qua-
lity at high prices,and street vendors add an extra
decimal place to the price for a Korean tourist sear-
ching for a made-in-Korea carnival mask.
Things are not much better for the local
p o p u l at i o n .As services from schools to hospitals are
forced out of the city to make way for more cost-effi-
cient operations like fast food restaurants and sou-
venir shops,Venice is less and less able to hold on
to its citizens.The city’s population has now sunk to
about 68,000,only slightly more than a third of what
it was in 1951.This is understandable when one
c o n s i d e rs the disadvantages of living in Ve n i c e .R e s-
taurant meals are very expensive.The purchase of
a necessity like spectacles can invo l ve an hour’s
journey to neighbouring towns. If one happens to
c r ave French cheese, the excursion could stretch to
two hours.

Venice is thus a ve ry good case of unsustainable
t o u ri s m . W h at ’s under threat in Ve n i c e , which 250
years ago was one of the most powerful and most
p o p u l ated cities in Europe, is culture in the broadest
s e n s e .Ye s , the issue is heritage preservat i o n . But in
a d d i t i o n , both citizens and visitors presumably
want the city to remain a living entity, and not be
transformed into an empty stage,where the sterile
r e p r e s e n t ation of an act of consumption—tou-
rism—is performed
One approach is to scare off some of the tou-
ri s t s , n a m e l y, the day - t ri p p e rs who, n u m b e ri n g
some seven million per ye a r , pass a few hours in
the city, contribute to congestion at the main tou-
rist at t r a c t i o n s , add to transport at i o n , s a n i t at i o n
and other problems and spend only a minimal
amount of money in the city. To this end, Ve n i c e
recently hired Oliviero Toscani, the photographer
behind Italian clothes-maker Benetton’s contro-
ve rsial adve rt i s e m e n t s , to produce a negat i ve publi-
city campaign feat u ring images of garbage and dead
pigeons.
Smart cards to attract 
high spenders
H o p e f u l l y, by reducing the number of day - t ri p-
pers, the city will not only cut down on associated
costs, but also hold greater  allure for tourists pre-
pared to stay a few days—and thus put real money
into the local economy. H owe ve r , r ather than
shooing tourists away, a more durable solution is to
i m p r ove the supply side of the tourism industry
equation by creating a cultural tourism system.
This approach is based on the recognition that
Ve n i c e ’s cultural offering is so vast that it can sat i s f y
the demands of a public with quite different
p r e f e r e n c e s. H owe ve r , gr e ater efforts need to be
made to publicize this offering. Perhaps the most
expedient method is to set up an inform ation tech-
nology infrastructure allowing visitors to access
details about city sites as well as eve n t s , and to
make advance bookings.
This strategy could include the issuance of a
m u l t i - s e rvice “ Venice Card” o f f e ring tourists oppor-
tunities not available to those who do not book: f o r
example, the right to jump queues; discounts on
museum entry and transport fares, at restaurants
and in shops; and inform ation about special eve n t s.
The card could be delivered, at no charge, to the
overnight-stay tourists when they book a hotel.
In this way, s e rious cultural tourists get a better
deal because they can more easily discover what is
on offer, and then arrange their itineraries expe-
diently and benefit from discounts. M e a n w h i l e ,
the city is better off because it attracts relat i vely high-
spending tourists who add to its profits from tou-
rism.
Diversifying 
the economy
I n f o rm ation systems such as these will be gi ve n
a test run during the Jubilee 2000 celebrat i o n s ,
when Italy expects an enormous inflow of tourists.
The A L ATA part n e rship of nort h e a s t e rn Italian
cities will use an inform ation system designed to
manage and distri bute visitor flow by telling pil-
grims how heavily booked  cities are. If a city’s
hotels are  full, the system will redirect tourists to
other localities for accommodat i o n .This is an emer-
gency measure aimed at coping with celebrations
r ather than providing incentives for certain types
of cultural tourism. But it is a first attempt to use
m o d e rn telecommunications technology to full
advantage.
At the moment, within the Venice city adminis-
tration,the idea of “soft controls”seems to be gai-
ning support. Pilot projects are underway for the
creation of a network connecting cultural institu-
tions. Much more needs to be done.
But Venice needs not only to manage its touri s m
b e t t e r , but also to dive rsify its economy. In a review
of sustainable development options for Ve n i c e ,
s c h o l a rs Enzo  Rullani and Stefano Micelli suggest
that Venice could become the capital of a metro-
politan area specializing in producer serv i c e s ,f r o m
d ata processing to software design and finance;
cultural industries such as musical and theatrical
productions; and other activities from research to
p r oviding convention serv i c e s.This requires a system
of fast transport to reconnect Ve n i c e , an island that
is relatively difficult to get to and from, to the rest
of the region.
Another vision is that of Venice as the capital of
hi-tech and data processing, overcoming its phy s i c a l
i s o l ation through electronic accessibility.W h at e ve r
approach is used, it is now recognized that if the
culture of Venice is to remain a living entity the
city needs to be refashioned into a place that exists
for more than tourism. n
Rain or shine, Venice is a crowd-puller, but the city is trying to cut down on day-trippers.
