The Song ofLawino by okot p'Bitek
My husband read much, with the Whites,
He has read everything, in depth,
He is as learned as the Whites,
But reading
has done for him.
It has cut him off from his people,
He is like a trunk
Without roots.
He runs down everything Acholi,
He says
That the customs of the Blacks
Are black
Because his eyes have burst,
And he wears black glasses,
And at his house
It is as black as in a forest!
My husband's house
Is a forest of books!
Some of them are immense,
As big as
Tido trees.
There are old ones
Whose bark is falling off,
And which smell strong,
There are thin, soft ones,
And others whose backs
Are as hard as the rocky trunk of the Poi tree.
Some are green,
Some are blood red,
Others black and oily,
With spines that shine
Like the poisonous ororo snake
Coiled at the top of a tree.
Some have pictures on their backs,
Dead faces of men and women who look like sorcerers,
Unshaven, proud, pot-bellied men,
Or hollow-cheeked, sullen and vengeful-looking,
Pictures of men and women
Long dead.
My husband's desk is covered
With a frightening pile of papers.
They look like the giant climbing plants of the forest
Or the Kituba tree
That smothers other trees to death.
Some stand on end,
Others lie on their backs.
They are all mixed together
Like the legs of young people
Dancing the orak,
Or the feet of planks
In a goggo fence.
They are jumbled together
Like the legs of giant climbing plants
In the impenetrable forest.
My husband's house
Is an immense forest of books.
It is dark, everything is sodden.
A hot, thick, poisoned vapour
Rises from the ground
And mixes with the penetrating damp of the air
And the raindrops gathered on the leaves.
You smother
If you stay there long.
It ruins your nose and your tongue,
So that you can no longer
Savour the refreshing odour of sesame oil
Or the taste of malakwang.
