INTERNATIONAL WORK CAMP VOLUNTEERS BRING
HELP-AND NEW HOPE-TO A FRENCH VILLAGE
EVERYONE looks forward to
his or her annual holiday
as a time of relaxation and
it is rare to hear or read of
people who voluntarily give up
this leisure time to work for
others.
This summer, 120 young people
from sixteen different countries,
met in two international work
camps in the French Landes, set
up by Jeunesse et Reconstruction
and Service Civil International
under the auspices of the French
National Commission for Unesco
which provided the funds. These
young people gave up their month's
vacation to help the people of
Saugnac, a village whose popula-
tion had dwindled from 1, 800 to
650 as the result of repeated forest
fires in the region.
Using scythes and spades, they
dug mile after mile of fire breaks
to check future forest fires. They
tilled the soil and made it ready
for crops. They cleared land
which was charred brush as a
result of past fires. They lived
in tents and primitive shacks
where they did their own cooking
and washing.
At the end of the day, they
gathered around wooden tables to
talk and to deepen friendships
begun while they worked side by
side in the fields. It was an
enlivening and stimulating expe-
rience for these young folk who
came from all walks of life-
students, workers, sailors, teachers,
dancers and journalists-and
whose homes lay as far apart as
Yugoslavia and Chile, Finland and
New Zealand.
In their leisure time they read
books from the Unesco Library set
up in the camp, or exchanged per-
sonal experiences. All the while,
they were gaining an insight into
the life of their new friends from
other lands and an affection for
the"Landais"whose soil they were
helping to bring back to fertility.
They left many friends behind
them in the village of Saugnac et
Muret. The work done by these
international work camps gave the
villagers fresh heart and confidence
for the future.
