Just one teaspoonful is all it takes.
Trouble is, the herbicide also brings a slow

A 1996 Greenpeace study says that
managers of rubber and palm oil planta-
tions in Malaysia, including some owned
by Western companies, were using and
over-using paraquat and many other high-
ly toxic substances. When inhaled or
absorbed through the skin, they can
damage the liver, kidneys and lungs and
cause nosebleeds, miscarriages, sterility,
cancer, and neurological and behavioural
disorders.
In the southern countri e s , they are
often sprayed excessively by poorly-infor-
med fa rm wo r k e rs who lack protective
e q u i p m e n t . They can be found in markets

in harmless-looking boxes that do not
make the slightest mention of their harm-
ful effects.
D avid Pimentel, a specialist at Corn e l l
U n i ve rsity in the United Stat e s , s ays that
each year pesticides kill 220,000 people
and make another three million sick.
“Eighty per cent of all pesticides are used
in the developed countri e s ,” he notes, “ bu t
f e wer than half the poisoning deaths occur
t h e r e .” In all, 25 million wo r k e rs are at ri s k
in developing countri e s.
An expanding marke t
O ver- and carelessly-used pesticides not
only kill people. They endanger the future
as we l l . Pimentel says their indiscri m i n at e
use “causes $100 billion wo rth of damage
to the environment eve ry ye a r ,” i n c l u d i n g
$8 billion in the United States alone.
Among other things, pesticides kill the
n atural enemies of certain pests, b o o s t
those pests’ resistance to chemicals, d e s-
t r oy pollinating insects, fish and birds and
c o n t a m i n ate food, water and soils.
M e a n w h i l e , business is booming. T h e
world pesticides market has gr own steadily
over the past decade. In 1996 estimat e d
sales amounted to approx i m ately $30 bil-
l i o n , according to Barbara Dinham of T h e
Pesticides Tru s t , a London-based non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n . “The pesti-
cides trade,” she say s , “is dominated by ten
major agrochemical companies who
control 80 per cent of global sales.”
E u r o p e , the United States and Japan are
the main export e rs ,f o l l owed by deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries such as India, C h i n a , M e x i c o,
South Korea, I n d o n e s i a , Brazil and
C o l o m b i a .The market is gr owing at a bri s k

Europe is no better, but Dinham says it is
“ u n f o rt u n ately not possible to pin a num-
ber on European exports because there are
no details concerning them in customs
r e c o r d s.”
Tightening the rules
So fa r , legal curbs on the trade are only
local or vo l u n t a ry. In late 1989 FAO draf-
ted a “ p rior informed consent” p r o c e d u r e
( P I C ) , asking countries exporting “ e x t r e-
mely hazardous” products to obtain per-
mission from importing countri e s. B u t
only the European Union has made the
procedure mandat o ry. A convention on
trade in pesticides and hazardous chemi-
cals that will be signed in Rotterdam this
September aims to make it unive rsally bin-
d i n g . But no one can say how effective it
will be.
After more than two ye a rs of negotia-
tions sponsored by the FAO and the

P L A N E T
16 THE UNESCO COURIER
United Nations Environment Progr a m m e
( U N E P ) ,n i n e t y - five countries agreed on a
draft last March. It says that the products
c o n c e rned—so far only twe n t y - t wo pesti-
cides and five other industrial chemicals
t h at are banned or strictly regulated in two
c o u n t ries in different regions—can only be
e x p o rted with the importing country ’s
explicit consent.
W hy not ban the trade outri g h t ?
“There is no global consensus,” s ays Pa u l
W hylie of Ja m a i c a ’s Pesticides Control
A u t h o ri t y. He argues that “the Conve n t i o n
is another means of putting pressure on
m a n u fa c t u r e rs because they have to go
through heavy procedures.” But that still
does not mean they will be used.
“ G ove rnments will not reject a pesticide,
e ven a ve ry hazardous one,” Dinham say s ,
“if the country makes heavy use of it,
unless they have a substitute that costs the
s a m e .” Carl Smith of FASE adds, “I don’t
think the PIC agreement will reduce the
trade in chemicals. But it’s a step in the
right direction” which shows that gove rn-
ments are at least willing to share inform a-
t i o n . The stakes are high. “ D ata does
e x i s t ,” Smith say s ,“ but it is generally guar-
ded by industry as ‘ c o n fidential bu s i n e s s
i n f o rm at i o n ’ . Without a clear picture of
w h at the countries part i c i p ating in the PIC
process are importing and export i n g, it will
not be possible to know if the parties are
abiding by the conve n t i o n .”
Troublesome re s i d u e s
FAO estimates that there are more than 100,000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides in developing coun-
tries, including 20,000 in Africa.Stocks in the Near East countries are put at 5,000 tonnes. Several
countries in Asia and Eastern Europe have stocks in excess of 5,000 tonnes each.Due to the absen-
ce of environmentally sound disposal facilities stocks are constantly increasing. Some are over 30
years old.
Disposal costs vary from $3,500 to $5,000 per tonne. Costs of disposing of pesticide stocks in
Africa alone are estimated at over $100 million. The best disposal methods is high-temperature
incineration, according to FAO. None of the developing countries—except for a few newly indus-
trialized nations—have facilities for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of pesticides.
Without financial support from agro-industry, governments and aid agencies, this environmental
problem cannot be solved.
FAO has published guidelines in English, French,Spanish and Arabic on the accumulation,sto-
rage and stock control and disposal of bulk quantities of obsolete pesticides.

PIC does not provide for sanctions on
ru l e - b r e a k e rs , and there are plenty of ways to
get around the agr e e m e n t . Especially since
production of most outdated hazardous che-
micals is increasingly located in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s. For example, India manufa c t u r e s
DDT and China produces chlordane and
a l d ri n . If these countries see economic bene-
fits in producing hazardous pesticides, t h e y
will most likely continue producing them.
This raises an ironic possibility. In the end,
the developing countries that the conve n t i o n
is intended to protect could become the lea-
ding export e rs of chemicals on the PIC list.
F u rt h e rm o r e ,W hylie adds,“A pesticide may
be shipped as a consumer chemical, l i k e
p h a rmaceutical products and cosmetics,
which are not subject to PIC procedures.
Hazardous substances can always trave l
under those labels.” And then there’s the
black market. “The convention doesn’t
address illegal trafficking,” s ays Fat o u m at a
N d oye of the Gambia’s Hazardous
Chemicals and Pesticides Control and
Management Board. “Our borders are
p o r o u s.We need resources for the training of
customs officers.”
But at a time when development aid is
d w i n d l i n g, no additional funding to train
people how to handle, inspect and control
hazardous substances is planned. Yet that
m ay be exactly where the efforts should
b e gi n .
The organic alternative
If fa rm wo r k e rs knew how to use pesticides
p r o p e r l y, consumption would be cut in half,
Pimentel say s. In some countri e s , such as
S we d e n , consumption has already plumme-
ted by over 50 per cent. L i k e w i s e ,I n d o n e s i a
has slashed the use of pesticides on rice by
65 per cent while boosting the crop yield by
12 per cent. B u t , adds Pimentel, “ p e o p l e
use more of them than they should because
pest control is a complex technology.”T h e y
are spurred on by aggr e s s i ve chemical
i n d u s t ry adve rtising campaigns and easy
access to chemicals, which are sometimes
i m p o rted to southern countries as part of
d e velopment aid progr a m m e s.
Smith says the intensive use of pesti-
cides is just one link in a food production
chain that few call into question.
“ C h e m i c a l - i n t e n s i ve , e x p o rt-based agri-
culture has one clear benefit : cheap food
for citizens of developing countri e s. It is
also clear that fa rmland has been degr a-
d e d , ecosystems polluted and the va riety of
subsistence crops diminished.The number
of landholders is decreasing and profit s
from agriculture are concentrated in fewe r
h a n d s. These trends create a climate that
encourages the marketing and use of pesti-
c i d e s. Organic methods are more time-
i n t e n s i ve and may require more wo r k e rs.
In the short ru n , an organic approach
might seem less profit a b l e .” For whom? ■
