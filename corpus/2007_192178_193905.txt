Dialogue must be based 
on rational discussion.

I Dialogue is not just  
an exchange of ideas
Philosophers need to argue not 
only the necessity for dialogue but 
also explain its nature. Dialogue is 
not just the exchange of ideas. A 
quarrelling group may be actively 
exchanging ideas, but will be far 
from dialogue; so would a group 
indulging in mutual admiration. In 
both cases the discussions are 
not dedicated to acquiring knowl-
edge about truth or goodness for 
the sake of desirable human rela-
tions. These, then, are necessary 
conditions of dialogue. But there 
are other necessary conditions. 
Dialogue must be based on ratio-
nal discussion. Such a discussion 
is impossible unless the parties 
acknowledge the possibility that 
they might be wrong and the other 
right. We all know this attitude of 
mind does not come easily. 
One of the severest impediments 
deally, philosophy is both a criti-
cal and reconstructive discipline. 
Being critical does not just mean 
being apt to criticize the beliefs 
and reasonings of other people; 
it also means being self-critical, in 
dialogue with oneself. This implies 
also being in dialogue with others, 
be they members of one’s culture 
or one’s school of thought or of oth-
er cultures or schools of thought. 
In today’s world, dialogue be-
tween people of different cultures 
and schools of thought is an ur-
gent necessity. Dialogue is need-
ed not necessarily to bring about 
agreement but at least to bring 
about an understanding of the 
plurality of belief and non-belief 
and respect (not just tolerance) 
for them in principle. Just think of 
the consequences of the absence 
of dialogue in international and 
intra-national conflicts in the world 
today.
to dialogue is dogmatism, and it is, 
or ought to be, the role of philoso-
phers to find an antidote to it. Dog-
matism is not just holding a belief 
with a strong conviction; rather it 
is holding it with a conviction so 
strong that it rules out the possibil-
ity of error. It can be encountered 
in all spheres of human thinking, 
including philosophy (in the broad 
acceptation of this term). And rid-
ding human thought of dogmatism 
is one of philosophy’s objectives, 
in the strict conception of the dis-
cipline.
An antidote  
to dogmatism
As matters stand now, conflict-
ing dogmatisms fight interminably. 
When, for example, contending 
parties armed with mutually incom-
patible divine ‘revelations’ as to 
the nature of the good life engage 
each other, the refractory character 
of the situation is due in large mea-
sure to a shared sense of infallibility.

                       if the logical independence of morality from religion 
             were to be generally understood, some of the ferocity of current conflicts 
                      might be reduced, says Ghanaian philosopher Kwasi wiredu.

There are at least three layers of 
error here. 
First, allegedly infallible individu-
als are not supposed to have any 
need of dialogue among them-
selves, and the fallible, presumably, 

have no standing before the infal-
lible. But Philosophy has the duty 
and ability to dismantle the preten-
sions to infallibility, for the claims 
here are human, all too human. 
And the fact is that “To err is hu-
man.” 
Second, a great many of these 
conflicts arise when the contingent 
customs of one group’s life-style 
are made into universal laws of rec-
titude mandatory for all. To gene- 
rate an adequate appreciation 
of this distinction would be half 
the battle of intercultural under- 
standing won. This, to be sure, is a 
philosophical task. 
The third layer of error is the 
most difficult to deal with. It is the 
subordination of morality to religion, 
known in contemporary Western 
philosophy as the divine command 
theory of morals. In sum, it says that 
what is morally right is, by defini-
tion, what is commanded by God. 
Socrates in Plato’s Euthyphro tried 
to discourage such a conception 
by pointing out, in his dialectical 
manner, that it involved the absur-
dity that an action’s moral quality 
has nothing to do with its nature. 
On this score, Socrates has been 
generally persuasive among phi-
losophers, but not among some 
leaders of opinion. 
Even though the subordination of 
morality to religion is not unchal-
lenged in the Western world and 
is, in fact, non-existent in some 
non-Western cultures, such as in 
at least some parts of Africa, phi-
losophy still has plenty of work to 
do in this matter. Perhaps, if the 
logical independence of morality 
from religion were to be generally 
understood, some of the ferocity of 
current conflicts might be reduced.
