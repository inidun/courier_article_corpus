INTERVIEW BY ASBEL LÓPEZ
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST


C o l o m b i a : “a culture built on
illegality and forc e”
In the absence of a legitimate state, guerrillas, paramilitary forces and
organized crime have each managed to lay down their law, says
Colombian economist and philosopher Libardo Sarmiento 
RENÉ LEFORT
DIRECTOR OF THE UNESCO COURIER

Violence in Colombia claimed 38,000 lives
last year and created 10 times that number
of refugees. What is the Colombian state
doing about this?
Colombia does not have a classic state where
rule of law prevails, as is known in We s t e r n
democracies. Neither is there any agreement over
what kind of state is needed to get out of the present
c r i s i s.What exists is a skeletal state, run by an elite,
and a few state projects. We’re a country adrift in
the wind.

Is that because eve r yone is working at cross-
purposes?
In the last few years, the country has been
arguing over two opposing models. One is a classic
state that could implement a set of neo-liberal
policies—in other words, a small, e f ficient state
aimed at strengthening private capital. A p p l y i n g
this model over the past decade has caused a deep
crisis in agriculture and industry as well as a
progressive decline in living standards.
On the other side are those who want to build a
state which would entrench the social rights
established in the 1991 constitution and feature a
degree of decentralization and citizen participation.
It would be a more interventionist state, one that
would guarantee not just civil and political rights but
s o c i a l ,economic and cultural ones. It would be more
environmentally conscious, and would lead the way
to a genuine participatory democracy, not just one
where power is delegated.
The clash between these two visions has
generated huge polarization right in the middle of
a civil war that has sharply escalated since 1995. S o
far, neither model has managed to come up with
institutions that would usher in a law-governed
state. As a result, the state has become very weak
and now has precious little legitimacy.
What are the implications?
In the absence of the state—or rather because
of the perverse way the state behaves—parallel
authorities have sprung up with the aim of
controlling political,social,economic and military
life over great swathes of the country, t h u s
“ b a l k a n i z i n g ” the national territory. Th e s e
authorities or groups settle disputes and impose
their own binding rules. All this, of course, l i e s
outside the country’s legal institutions. P a r a m i l i t a r y
forces and left-wing guerrilla groups control vast
areas of land, while organized crime holds sway
over parts of the big cities. In some places these
groups set up a real “state within a state,” with all
that the notion implies: they make and enforce
l a w s, collect taxes from business people, i n d u s t r i a l i s t s
and landowners, and even regulate people’s daily
l i v e s.The result is a completely fragmented country
with no connection between state and nation.
You have argued that “the Colombian state
does not enforce any binding rules.” What do you
mean by this?
Each citizen follows his or her own code of
conduct and rejects those held by other people.
Someone who is honest but has no links with
powerful people cannot survive. This happens at
all levels, even when you queue up to sort out a
simple piece of paperwork.So in Colombia’s case,
I think the problem is not just drug smuggling but
also institutions and a culture built on illegality and
f o r c e, sometimes armed force.Today the issues are
trafficking drugs or people and embezzling public
funds, but tomorrow it could be any other illegal
activity that leads to easy money.

“Carrobomba”by Colombian artist Fernando Botero depicts an all-too familiar occurrence.

So Colombia is not a nation-state either?
No, and I don’t think it can be under present
circumstances because of the high level of
fragmentation and lack of state legitimacy.
According to the classical concept of a nation-state,
the state must serve the national interest. But in
Colombia the state has always served the ruling
class, except for a brief period in the middle of the
19th century. There’s no shared political sense of
n a t i o n h o o d . Because of the history of the
provinces—notably the constant clash between the
interests of local and central governments and the
weakness of institutions—a nation-state built
democratically from below, from the local and
regional level,has not emerged.
E ven in the most advanced democracies, t h e
state is expected to play a mediating role between
p owerful pre s s u re groups. Does it do this in
Colombia?
In our country,government policies are closely
linked to corporate and private interests. Th e
powerful groups—economic, political, military or
even some trade unions, such as that representing
civil servants—use the state for their own purposes.
As a result,p o l i c i e s, laws and public spending do not
cover the entire range of Colombians’ interests. I t ’s
not a state with a broad democratic or collective
interest in the common good.
Although that might seem very theoretical, it
n evertheless has serious effects on Colombians’
daily lives.
I n d e e d . People find it extremely hard to get any
kind of business or work going because they cannot
rely on the social capital of trust. A citizen also
starts from the assumption that he or she cannot
count on any real support from the state and knows
it will not defend any constitutional rights.
Can you give us some examples?
Th e r e ’s no security for opposition political parties.
In the last 15 years,more than 3,000 members of the
left-wing Patriotic Union party have been murdered.
About 90 percent of all crimes go unpunished.Th e
judicial system is also profoundly class-biased:m o r e
than 50,000 poor Colombians are languishing in
p r i s o n ,while powerful people involved in corruption
cases are simply put under house arrest. All the
politicians mixed up in the scandal surrounding the
election of President Ernesto Samper (1994-98),
whose campaign was funded by drug barons, c l e a r l y
p r o fited from this elitist system of justice.
What has kept the country together despite all
this?
It might seem odd, but the one thing that has
acted as a lifeline for national institutions amid
these conflicts is the use of the state budget as a kind
of cake to be sliced up, as spoils of war to be handed
out to regional politicians.
So it will be a big job for Colombians to estab l i s h
a social democratic state...
We have the same pressing needs as any modern
globalized society though we have not managed to
build either a state or a nation. Nor have we carried
out major democratic reforms to entrench basic
freedoms and civil, p o l i t i c a l , s o c i a l , e c o n o m i c,
c u l t u r a l , environmental and indigenous people’s
rights.The society has many conflicting groups but
no centre or shared agenda.
Human rights and peace with social justice must
underpin any such shared agenda. P a r t i c i p a t o r y
d e m o c r a cy and local and regional autonomy are
indispensable for the reconstruction of a Colombian
state and nation fit to cope with the new demands
of a globalized society. The other big challenge is
education—building institutions dedicated to the
common good, bringing about a culture of
democracy and modern citizenship. ■
