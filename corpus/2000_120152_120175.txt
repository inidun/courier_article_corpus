DJ democra c y :
made in Ja p a n
◗ Kenji Gamon
In the past decade, c o m p u t e r-operated musical
devices have been replacing the human musi-
c i a n ,while hard-drives and portable digital record-
ing gear are making tape-based recordings obso-
l e t e.These increasingly affordable digital tools are
reaching a new breed of musicians who previously
had little or no chance of breaking into the main-
stream music industry.With Japanese companies
l i ke A k a i ,Roland and Yamaha churning out the lat-
est in DJ gadgetry, there is no better place to wit-
ness the revolutionary changes in digital music
than To k y o.
The “Made in Ja p a n ”l a b e l ,which was hitherto
seen only engraved on the back of these electronic
i n s t r u m e n t s, is now proving to be a marke t a b l e
cultural export product as well. In fact, Japan is
enjoying a sort of pop-culture renaissance as DJs
l i ke Ken Ishii, T s u y o s h i , Fumiya Tanaka and DJ

Krush find success in the European and A m e r i c a n
music marke t s.
Ken Ishii, 3 0 , is the most famous of these rising
s t a r s.About ten years ago, Ishii sent a demo tape
to the Belgian techno label R&S, which immedi-
ately signed him on with a contract,not only shin-
ing an international spotlight on the young mae-
stro but also enabling him to gain recognition in
his own country for the first time.H o w e v e r, I s h i i ’s
now blossoming career (currently fuelled by the
powerful marketing muscle of Sony Records in
Japan) represents only one side of the cyberpunk
artist-turned-Cinderella story.
In the quiet urban sprawl of Tokyo’s Komaba
d i s t r i c t ,Kisei Irie,2 8 , and Takashi Saito, 2 4 ,are try-
ing to follow in the footsteps of their rising techno
gods. In Irie’s one-bedroom apartment,the duo
are cranking out a fervent mix of techno grooves
under the name A / F + BAD KARMA. These two
bedroom DJs cashed in years’ worth of savings
(about $2,000) to press 300 vinyl copies of their
four new tracks at a Czech record plant.
But producing the music is only one step in
the struggle. Distribution is a veritable battle as
the growing number of “bedroom DJs” c o m p e t e
to get local record stores to purchase and dis-
play their vinyl creations. “Sure Japan has prof-
itable stars like Ishii, but that doesn’t mean the
i n d u s t r y, record stores or clubs are trying to cul-
t i vate new talent,” says Irie.“Guys like us have to
start at the bottom.”
M e a n w h i l e, the skyrocketing number of DJs
has yet to trigger an explosion in creativity.
“Everybody sounds the same,” says Zatiochi
Nakano, 35,a studio engineer and digital instru-
ment expert. “But that’s the case everywhere
because kids want to create ‘cool’ sounds to
please as wide an audience as possible.” Fo r
Nakano, the new digital instruments are revolu-
tionary because they allow the musically
untrained to create their own material. H o w e v e r,
the personal pleasures of creativity should not
be confused with talent. As Nakano concludes,
“Good music requires good creators and that’s as
old as the hills.” ■
