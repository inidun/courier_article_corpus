WHEN FAMINE STRIKES FIRST VICTIMS ARE USUALLY THE
Th
1 or most of us, a famine is a
news item, a row of statis¬
tics, a collecting box label. In the
West it is difficult to grasp the
concrete reality of famine, without
first hand experience.
In actuality a famine is a hollow
stomach flapping like an empty
sack, a mouth dried like a brick¬
yard kiln, unwholesomely pale
lips covered with slime, and
deepset hollow eyes ., beneath a
shrunken forehead. It is sharp-
pointed knuckles projecting from
under a transparent, mottled skin,
bony, over-accentuated kneecaps
and an unprotected ribcage.
It can be a sick and weary
mother crouching in the dust,
spitting saliva into the mouth of
her dying child ; it is always the
pathetic, hollow bleating and

lowing of dying livestock. I once
saw it in the shape of three women
cutting up and eating the skin of
a three months dead horse. And
it has been groups of half-crazed
peasants cooking human flesh.
I know a little what it is like to
be in a famine. I once saw one.
Imagine a fertile province in
India where I once lived, with its
cultivated fields, tiny villages and
thriving cities. Here the rythmn of
life beats to the tempo of the
cicadas in the trees, with their
legs crossed as though in a gesture
of devotion. Day and night there
is the tinkling of the bells on the
bullock carts forever rumbling and
lurching along the deep rutted
roads. The temple conches signal
the passing of the day, and the
year's festivals come and go.
As the hot weather progresses,
the rivers and streams dry up and
become children's playgrounds.
Work is carried out only in the
early mornings and in the cool of
the evenings, and people sleep
away the heat of the middays and
afternoons.
The river, beds crack and the
banks of the streams crumble, but
that is usual and life goes on as
ever. There is water in the village
well and each morning and
evening the women of the village
gather to draw up their supplies
and gossip.
It is a large, bricklined well,
twelve feet in diameter, and
protected by a low wall. It is all
of one hundred feet deep, and a
row of projecting bricks form a
circular staircase right down to
the water level. The depth of
water can be calculated by
counting the number of bricks
showing above the water.
That is how it was the year of
the famine. As the hot weather
neared its end we began to wonder
whether the monsoon would be
late or early. It was the normal
topic for that time of the year.
The monsoon is the season of the
rains that sweep across India in a
curved path from the Bay of
Bengal and drop their last
pourings over, the Arabian Ocean.
Sometimes the rains do not come.
That spells famine in India.
Gradually that year
it became evident that
the monsoon would
be late. When the
time came to plant

THE RAINS FAILED
(Continued)
VILLAGE FLIGHT FROM HUNGER AND DEATH
the thin rice shoots in the paddy
fields the rains were very late
indeed, and we men, who normally
met at the barber's shop in the
village square, began to visit the
emptying well along with the
women.
The swelling sun gleamed and
glittered like a huge brass bedknob.
Wc kept constant watch for the
first tiny ball of cloud that would
herald the break in
the weather and re¬
lief from the eternal
heat and flies. All
that long and arid
season however, the
sun and sky remain¬
ed hard and immacu¬
late.
By then the women
had all begun to
talk of the emptying
larders. The rice
chatties were depleted
and maize was scarce.
Some of the shops in
the bazaar no longer
opened and their clos¬
ed shutters were a
sign of what was to
conic. At that stage
it would have been
sensible for us to have
made plans for the
evacuation of the
young and the old.
But human nature
being what it is, all of
us in the village were
loath to consider leav¬
ing our tiny plots of
land and few cattle.
And so, each day at
the well, where far
too many steps were
now showing, we
loudly proclaimed our
faith in the imminence
of the monsoon. "It's
bound to arrive to¬
morrow" we told each
other. But it never
came.
Distrust and aggres¬
sion crept into our
midst. Each family
began to be very
secretive about food.
And one evening I
suddenly realized that
the famine was among
us. It had very swiftly and se¬
cretly infiltrated into the village
without any of us being aware.
That is the awful facility of a
famine.
I discovered the famine one
evening while I was out for a
walk. I always walked along the
banks .of our river, where the
cracked fissures lay on the hard,
baked surface of the bed like
immense, black starfish. I passed
the burning ghats where the Hin¬
dus burned their dead, and that
evening, as a huge, spinning red
sun set unevenly, like a coffin
being lowered into a grave by
bearers of ill-assorted sizes, there
were six funeral pyres, and clus¬
tered around each were young
parents. The young and the very
old are invariably the first casual¬
ties. There had been no cholera,
There was water in the village well and each morning and evening the women
gathered there to draw up their supplies and gossip. But as weeks passed
the water level dropped until there was just a foot or so of muddy liquid.
or smallpox or typhoid that year,
so I knew these must be victims of
hunger.
The tears of the women were
bitter and arid symbols of our
frustrated hopes.
From that moment life took on
a new meaning. Shops no longer
opened at all, and the wealthier
shopkeepers left. There was a
spate of rumours about the
monsoon and its approach, and
about government grain supplies
on the way. But the food chatties,
were scraped clean and every tiny
store of food hoarded and guarded.
We all began to walk about in
a trance, and as the days passed
there was soon just a foot or so
of muddy liquid at the bottom of
the well. It became impossible to
think, or even feel anything. The
funeral pyres increas¬
ed in number each
evening, but soon
there were no tears
during the rites. Yet,
secretly, we all of us
clung to the hope
that the drought
would still break.
Then the first refu¬
gees from villages to
the east of us hurried
through in family
groups, each group
carrying the young
and bundles of house
hold effects and be¬
longings that they had
already begun to cast
away by the time
they had reached us.
By then too, they were
in a desperate state,
and the men of our
village had to fight
with some of the
stronger of them, who
tried to take what
water we had left.
And then in ones
and twos and threes
and fours, our fami¬
lies packed up simi¬
lar bundles of pos¬
sessions and joined
the scrambling stream
of refugees trekking
westwards to the hills
and deep jungles of
Hazaribagh and the
hoped-for land of
promise that lay just
beyond, but which
always remained just
beyond the next range
of hills, and which
we never did find.
The old and the infirm
we left behind. It was
what they would have
wanted had we given them a
choice, but there was no choice
and they lay there on their char-
poys in the gloomy interiors of the
abandoned houses, until death
came to deliver them.
Of the nine hundred and seven¬
teen people in our village, there
were only four hundred and eighty-
six there next, year to meet at the
well and wait for the monsoon. But
lhat year it did come.
