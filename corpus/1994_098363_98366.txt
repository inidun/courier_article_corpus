íí^^ropical forest" is the
common name for what
specialists call "rainforest",
a term coined in 1898 by the
botanist Andreas Schimper to des¬
ignate forests that grow in a per¬
petually humid environment,
receiving more than 2,000 millime¬
tres of rain per year. In these condi¬
tions trees with smooth trunks can
grow to more than sixty metres high.
Their tops join together in what is
known as the canopy, a roof of thick
vegetation that keeps out the light.
Like a scarf girdling the equator,
rainforests cover about 9.5 million
square kilometres. The largest single
tropical forest zone is in South
America. Only five million square
kilometres ofrainforest now exist in
tropical Asia and central Africa. A
report published by Unesco in 1991
reveals that Côte d'Ivoire has lost 75
per cent of its forest since 1960, and
Ghana 80 per cent. In 25 years the
Philippines have lost 15 out of 16
million hectares. By the year 2000
the forests ofViet Nam may well be
no more than a fond memory. As
British ecologist Edward Goldsmith
noted in his Report on PlanetEarth,
published in 1990, the Food andAgri¬
culture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) estimated in the early
1980s that 100,000 square kilome¬
tres ofrain forest were being lost each
year. TheAmerican Academy ofSci¬
ences was far more pessimistic,
deploring the loss of twice that area.
The situation in Brazil seems to sup¬
port the Academy's claim, since
Brazil lost 48,000 square kilometres in
1988 alone.
Lowland forests, by far the
biggest and the most easily acces¬
sible, have suffered most from
human exploitation. Although less
developed because of lower tem¬
peratures, rainfall variability and
poorer soil, highland forests still
play a very important role in pre¬
venting soil erosion and lowland
flooding. Mangroves are a kind of
rainforest growing in the salt-water
and silt-rich coastal regions and
along the banks of rivers flowing
through forests. The mangrove
forests in the Sundarbans region of
the Ganges delta are the world's
largest.
WHO IS TO BLAME?
Although they cover only 7 per cent
of the earth's surface, rainforests are
the home of more than half of the
planet's plant species. With massive
media support, international orga¬
nizations are rightly insisting on the
need to preserve biodiversity, which
is threatened from all sides, most
notably by competition from agri¬
culture. Again according to FAO,
some 250 million farmers live in rain¬
forests around the world. In search of
land for crop-growing and livestock-
raising, they occupy forest areas
owned by the state, which is often
unable to control access to it. These
farmers have no recognized right to
the areas they occupy. Alain Karsenty
and Henri-FélixMaître ofthe forestry
department of France's Centre for
International Co-operation in Agro¬
nomic Research for Development
(CIRAD) in a report to the Xlth Direc¬
torate of the Commission of the
European Communities published
in 1993 stress that "recognition of
property rights (not necessarily in
the Western sense of the term 'prop¬
erty') for local communities is one of
the necessary (but not sufficient)
conditions for joint management of
the forest with those who live in it."
Peoples who have lived for a long
period in these zones are well
adapted to their environment, but
this is not the case with the new
arrivals who grow cash crops such
as cocoa and coffee. They follow the
roads and trails gouged out by the
loggers, thereby infiltrating the
dense forest where, mainly by using
fire, they create "frontiers" which
push back the forest. "This inter¬
relationship between exploitation

THE DIMINISHING OZONE
LAYER
The World Meteorological Organiza¬
tion (WMO) reports that in 1 993 low
ozone levels were measured over most
of South America. Ozone concentra¬
tions fell by 7% above Sao Paulo and by
3 to 4% above Rio de Janeiro. In March
and April 1994 the depletion of the
ozone layer above Europe, Siberia and
the adjacent polar-ocean areas was
more than 1 0% below long-term mean
values.
FUEL FOR KANGWANE'S
FIRES
An American reader, Suzy Lieben¬
berg, former co-ordinator of Ecolink's
environmental community develop¬
ment programme, has written to tell
us about an interesting project in the
eastern Transvaal lowveld of South
Africa, where members of the rural
community of Kangwane are growing
Leucaena trees around their homes
and in their vegetable gardens. The
species grows quickly and produces
many stems from ground level rather
than a single trunk. This makes it ideal
for coppicing, which involves cutting
a few stems from each tree annually,
thus ensuring renewable supplies of
wood. Tree seedlings are provided at
a reasonable cost to the villagers and
are planted to act as windbreaks and
to provide shade and slow down
evaporation in vegetable gardens. Leu¬
caena is a legume, and its root nodules
contain bacteria that extract nitrogen
from the atmosphere and improve
soil fertility by producing nitrates.
Community members are encour¬
aged to plant 52 seedlings because in
a 3-to-5-year period, 52 trees would
supply enough fuel for a year. It also
relieves women of having to carry
heavy loads for great distances.
ON THE SCENT OF THE
MUSK DEER
The musk deer (Moschus moschiferus),
a small hornless ruminant that lives in
mountainous regions of Central Asia,
China, eastern Korea and Siberia, is
out of luck. The musk gland of the
male is coveted both by Asian medi¬
cine and the Western perfume
industry. Consisting of sexual hor¬
mones, cholesterol and a waxy sub¬
stance, musk gives out a strong odour.
Although musk can be collected from
farm-reared specimens without killing
the animal, as is done in China,
poachers do not hesitate to defy mea¬
sures to protect the musk deer.
According to World Wide Fund for
and agricultural colonization," says
Alain Karsenty, "makes it difficult
to apportion the responsibility
borne by each activity in deforesta¬
tion processes."
Edward Goldsmith has no time
for those who condemn farmers for
clearing land by fire, for this process
has always been used, even in
Europe. Its disadvantages become
apparent when the population
grows and the land is not left fallow
for long enough, thus preventing
the forest from regenerating itself
between two burnings.
Crops are greedy devourers of
forest. In Ethiopia vast plantations
have replaced trees: 60 per cent of
the land is now given over to cotton-
growing and 22 per cent to sugar
cane. CentralAmerica has seen two-
thirds of its forests sacrificed to live¬
stock-raising. Numerous devel¬
oping countries that once exported
timber Nigeria, for example, but
above all the Philippines, once a
major exporter now import it. Of
the last thirty exporters in the Third
World today, only ten will still be
exporting by the end of the century.
Another factor in deforestation is
the timber industry. Until now Suri¬
name on South America's north¬
eastern coast has been 90 per cent
covered by virgin rainforest. But the
government has just granted a con¬
cession of 150,000 hectares to an
Indonesian logging company and
is considering throwing in two mil¬
lion hectares more. Ernie Brunings,
a member of Suriname's National
Assembly, was quoted by Time mag¬
azine as saying bluntly, "We cannot
have these riches and keep them
for their beauty ifwe have children
dying of hunger, as we have here."
This is the crux of the matter. The
logging industry creates jobs, and
however low the wages may be, they
provide a basic minimum.
LAND-HUNGRY FARMERS
Sustainable management of rain¬
forests on a planetary scale is essen¬
tial. This is what the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP),
the World Bank and the World
Resources Institute (WRI) are trying
to achieve via an ongoing process
known as the Tropical Forestry
Action Plan (TFAP). This is not a
new plan but it is still relevant,
although there has been some crit¬
icism that state authorities and
sources of finance have a bigger say
in it than the populations directly
concerned.
"Is it possible," Alain Karsenty
wonders, "both to preserve vast
multifunctional forest ecosystems
(protectors of biodiversity, homes
to local communities, bulwarks
against erosion and regulators of
climate) and to allow logging activ¬
ities on an industrial scale?" He goes
on to ask, "How can we reconcile a
business rationale that thinks
largely in the short term with nat¬
ural forest regeneration, a process
that extends over dozens ofyears?"
Forest space is in high demand.
Not only by logging companies
but once the loggers have pulled
out by large-scale livestock-raisers
and cacao and rubber planters, who
are always ready to clear the land.
Forms of exploitation vary from
region to region. In Africa, where
highly-prized wood like mahogany
is found and logging is very selec¬
tive, only one tree per hectare is
felled on average. This may not be
much, but to reach logging sites,
trails have to be cut, sometimes as
much as one hundred kilometres
long, and this opens the way to
land-hungry farmers. In tropical
America, the opposite happens. The
farmers go in first and are followed
by loggers. Deforestation problems
in southeast Asia result from inten¬
sive, often devastating, clear-cut¬
ting. The pockets of remaining
forest are vulnerable to fires, as has
been seen in Borneo.
SUSTAINABLE POSSIBILITIES
Several proposals for preserving the
rainforest have been put forward.
One is to limit the time period of
concessions granted to logging com-
panies and making their renewal
dependent on "good behaviour".
Logging companies might aiso be
obliged by states to build on-site saw

mills, as is done in Cameroon, to
prevent them from clearing out once
they have cut down all the valuable
trees. The value of concessions could
also be reassssed by taking account
of their true commercial value and
granting them on a competitive
basis. Skid trails must also be laid
down, for, according to the World
Bank, from 15 to 35 per cent of the
damage to forests is caused by trac¬
tors foraging randomly in search of
felled trees. Felling techniques could
also be improved so that falling trees
cause less damage to their neigh¬
bours. If their operating costs could
be brought down and their safety
ensured for both men and forest,
helicopters and blimps could even¬
tually lift timber vertically out of the
forest.
The preservation of the rain¬
forest depends above all on the
political determination of states.
Either states tolerate tree-felling
and impose taxes on it, or they
define regulations for using and
managing the forests that interna¬
tional organizations like the FAO
and the World Bank are prepared
to support.
Some states, such as Indonesia,
prohibit the exporting ofunprocessed
wood. In the process of industrial¬
izing, they have sought to add value
to their timber and create jobs. Is
this a solution? In Indonesia there
are 500,000 jobs in plywood mills
and about three million jobs in the
wood industry overall. To function,
the industry requires 50 million m3
of unprocessed wood per year, but
the country can no longer supply
this amount. Wood must be
obtained at any price thus encour¬
aging illicit practices or the mills
will have to be closed down, which
is politically impossible.
German, Dutch and American
ecologists have proposed that the
developed countries should boy¬
cott tropical wood unless it carries

the "green label" awarded to wood
from forests that are exploited sus-
tainably. Even this plan is not
without drawbacks. What is to pre¬
vent timber companies from
reaping maximum profits before
the restriction becomes universal? It
might also speed up the conversion
of forests into huge cacao and coffee
farms that are supposedly more
profitable. Or states may simply
cease to manage and develop their
forests, inthebelieftheywillnotbe
able to make money out of them.
Preservation and exploitation
are not incompatible. In the tropics
as in Europe, a forest that is not
taken care of is a dying forest. But in
managing these renewable natural
resources, we must be satisfied with
reaping the interest without touching
the capital.

SHRIMP IN CAGES
Since 1992, France's Research Insti¬
tute for Exploitation of the Sea
(IFREMER) has been co-operating
with Brazil on a pilot project for
farming shrimp in cages. The project
is designed to increase production
and to study the impact of aquaculture
on the environment. In Ecuador,
IFREMER is co-operating with the
National Centre for Aquaculture and
Marine Research (CENAIM) on the
immunology and pathology of shrimp
grown on farms. But while the cage
technique is simple, the high-tech
facilities being used in Ecuador have
been strongly criticized by the British
ecologist Edward Goldsmith on the
grounds that their products are too
expensive for the needy.
FIRE-LOVING FLOWERS
A rare flowering plant, the Peter's
Mountain mallow (lliamna core/), has
made a remarkable comeback thanks
to a prescribed burning programme in
a Nature Conservancy Preserve in
Virginia (U.S.A.). Only four such plants
were known to exist when scientists
discovered a large amount of dor¬
mant but viable seeds surrounding
the plants. The fire-dependent plant
was brought back from the brink of
extinction when over 500 seeds
sprouted after a controlled burn was
conducted in the preserve.
THE GREEN BUSES OF
BRUSSELS
Last March, Belgium's Ministry of
Public Works and Communications
and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Bel¬
gium launched 20 new buses in Brus¬
sels that run on compressed natural
gas (CNG). Although they cost almost
$30,000 more than diesel buses to
buy, maintenance costs are halved
and a ministry subsidy keeps CNG
prices even with those of diesel fuel.
New York, Toronto and several other
European cities including Utrecht
(Netherlands) and Ravenna (Italy)
already power public transport vehi¬
cles with natural gas. WWF-Belgium
has sent education packs explaining
the link between transportation and
urban pollution to all secondary
schools in Brussels. While the world
waits for a miracle-fuel, CNG remains
the least polluting of all.
