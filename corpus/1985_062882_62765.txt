The Lenin Library
THE Lenin State Library is the most important library
in the Soviet Union. It is the keystone of the coun¬
try's unified library system, in which it acts as a
depository for all publications, a co-ordination centre for
library science and bibliographical work, a scientific and
methodological centre, and a centre for inter-library loans.
The library was founded in 1862j Its nucleus was the
library of Count N.P. Rumantsev, an early nineteenth-
century Russian politician and scholar for whom it was
named. In 1918, when the Soviet Government was transfer¬
red from Petrograd to Moscow, the Rumantsev public
library became the National Library. In 1921 it was function¬
ing as a State depository for all books published in the coun¬
try, and in the same year began to extend its holdings
through the acquisition of works of foreign literature, a pro¬
cess which has continued regularly ever since. An interna¬
tional exchange service was inaugurated. On 6 February
1925, by a decree of the Soviet Government, it was named
the Lenin State Library.
On 1 January 1984 the holdings of the Lenin Library
amounted to 331,243,000 titles. Each year a million new
works are acquired, 600,000 non-periodical publications and
400,000 periodicals. The Library has almost 300,000 readers.
Each year 2,215,000 entries are recorded, including
1,202,000 to the scientific reading rooms.
The Library publishes 500 titles each year. Its lending
facilities serve 3,500 libraries in 110 countries. As part of
inter-library exchange facilities, it receives approximately
125,000 books and supplies 210,000.
In 1987 the Lenin Library will be celebrating its 125th
anniversary.
