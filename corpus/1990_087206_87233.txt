Manuscripts from the Corvina library:
Above left, page from a commentary on Cicero's works on rhetoric by Calus
Marlus Vlctorlnus. Prior to 1462.
Above, The Fount of Knowledge of St. John of Damascus. Florence, 1485-1490.
Above right, page from a Gradual (book of plalnsong for Mass), 1480-1490,
decorated with the arms of King Matthias and Queen Beatrice of Hungary.
vehicle and preserver of the literary
and scientific heritage of classical An¬
tiquity. As efforts were made to copy
as much of this heritage as possible,
and collect everything relating to it
that had survived, libraries became
the workplace of scholars and centres
of intellectual activities and debate.
Although printed books, or in¬
cunabula, were starting to circulate
through Europe by the second half
of Matthias's reign, they were far out¬
numbered in his library by hand¬
written books or codices. Such
manuscripts were the result of pains¬
taking work by scribes who had not
only to be proficient in Latin, the lan¬
guage of medieval literature and
science, but also had to decipher a
host of abbreviations which authors
used to save time and space. Their
work was physically as well as men¬
tally exhausting. "Three fingers write
and the whole body toils," they often
wrote when they came to the end of
a volume.
Styles of script changed from
time to time in accordance with the
dictates of fashion. In the Corvina
manuscripts four basic styles are
represented: Gothic textura, Gothico-
antiqua, Humanist rotund and
Humanist cursive. The script is
meticulously executed on high quality
vellum. The manuscripts' most beau¬
tiful feature, however, is their hand-
painted ornamentation and illumina¬
tion. The codices made or acquired
for the Corvina in the 1460s and
1470s were decorated in the relatively
glctuu poftu Ih foyer inc. '
simple style of the age, bordered with
scrolls of white foliage on a coloured
background. Later, in its heyday, the
library acquired quintessential Renais¬
sance masterpieces adorned with roy¬
al emblems and, in some cases, with
portraits of Matthias and his queen.
But superb though the Corvina
manuscripts may have been as ob¬
jects, it was the wealth of the library's
holdings that won it the acclaim of
contemporaries and of posterity. We
have no direct evidence of the size of
the collection at the time of Matthias's
death, but it is thought to have con¬
tained between 2,000 and 5,000
volumes. Works by classical Greek
authors in Greek and in Latin trans¬
lation were strongly represented.
Extrapolating from the surviving
manuscripts, of which 216 are
known to exist scattered around the
world in libraries and private collec¬
tions, it may be assumed that about
two thirds of the collection was secu¬
lar in content with the remaining
third being devoted to theology.
The Corvina treasures were not
merely for show. The codices were
consulted by the king, who also guid¬
ed acquisitions and attended sympo¬
sia of leading scholars that were held
at the library. Every field of science
and literature was represented:
poetry and drama, philosophy and
theology, astronomy and medicine,
geography, rhetoric, grammar, ar¬
chitecture, military science and
mathematics. In addition to works in
Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the first ef¬
forts of the budding Hungarian liter¬
ature also found their way to the
Corvina.
By the close of Matthias's reign,
the Corvina was at the height of its
fame. On his death it slowly began
to decline, and in 1526 when Buda
was overrun by the Ottomans the
great library was destroyed. 49
