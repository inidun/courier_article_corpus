What is an
Arid Zone ?
EXTIiE ; \IE ARID ZONE : An
area in which at least 12
consecutive months without
rainfall have been recorded,
and in which there is not a
regular seasonal rhythm of
rainfall. Aden, at the
southern end of the Red
Sea, Thamed near its nor-
thern end, and several
places along the Egyptian
coast of this sea are among
the zones which fully com-
ply with this rigorous defi-
nition. Hurghada, on the
west coast of the Red Sea,
had no rainfall during
four years of observations.
In the United States, a few
areas in the Colorado desert
and Death Valley also fulfil
these requirements. The
longest dry period recorded
in the U. S. was at Baghdad
(California), where during
the three-year period from
February 1917 to January
1920 the total rainfall
amounted to a tenth of an
inch. Over 23 years, Bagh-
dad's mean annual precipi-
tation was 2. 28ins.
ARID ZONE : From on agricul-
tural point of view, the arid
zones are those in which
the rainfall over a given
piece of land is not enough
for crop production.
SEMI-ARID ZONE : Rainfall is
sufficient for certain types
of crops, and grass is an
important element of the
natural vegetation, unless
overgrazing has replaced it
with brush.
PRECIPITATION : The essen-
tial characteristic of an arid
zone-and it is the one on
which all other things
depend-is its small rainfall.
There is no general rule'
indicating just how small
this must be to place a
climate in the desert or
steppe category. Taking a.
specific annual rainfall
(such as 13. 8ins as the
outer limit of the arid, or
29. 5ins as the outer limit of
the semi-arid) is often mis-
leading. A given amount
of rainfall which dries up
quickly is of less value to
plants than the same
amount which evaporates
more slowly and so can be
used by animals over a
longer period.
TEMPERATURE : The right
amount of heat, as well as
of water, is essential for the
growth and ripening of
plants. Thus perennial
plants are limited in distri-
bution by the coldness of
winter, and annuals by both
the cold season and the hot.
While the date flourishes in
even the hottest deserts, the
common European grains
such as wheat, rye and oats
will not germinate at tem-
peratures over about 85°F.
But it is not so much the
mean monthly temperature
that affects life as seasonal
extremes-and this applies
especially to the arid zones.
The map alongside there-
fore indicates the average
for the. coldest and warmest
months.

A third of Mexico and
U. S. are arid ; for Ca-
nada, figure is a tenth.
Most arjd zones of U. S.
and Canada resemble
those of Iran, Turkes-
tan and Upper Ara-
bia. Small area bor-
dering Gulf of Call-
fornia and parts of
Arizona and California
resemble hot Sahara
climate. Great Plains
of U. S. and Canada are
similar in climate to
the Russian steppes.
North. East Brazil's
Caatinga (scrubland)
has semi-arid and even
genuine, arid tropical
areas in about latitude
of Somaliland. Two-
thirds of Brazil's goats
are found here. North
Venezuela and Curaçao
have a similar climate.
Patagonia's - stony
windswept dry plateau
rises from 30 to 5, 000
teet between coast and
Andes. Central Andean
plateaus are chilly de-
sert linking western
and eastern dry lands.
About one-third of the
Argentine is arid land.
Atacama is not just
world's driest desert,
but paradoxically Chi-
le's greatest wealth. It
contains the only large
nitrate deposits (used
for fertilizers!) and
largest copper ore re-
serves in world. Rain
would dissolve nitrate.
DISTRIBUTION OF
ARID CLIMATES
FOR more than 2,000 years
scientists have been con-
cerned with the classific -
tion and world distribution of
climates. Of the many classi-
fications devised, the one that
has been used the most was de-
veloped in the fourth century
B. C. by Aristotle. His Meteoro-
logica divided the earth up
into five zones of latitude cor-
responding to three types of cli-
mate-tor id, temperate and fri-
gid-based n the different in-
clination of slant of the sun's
rays at dif nt latitudes. Our
word climate comes from the
Greek klimata, coined out of
the verb klinein, meaning
"to incline". Much later scien-
tists realized that latitude was
not he only basis for climate ;
that temperatur does not vary
only because of latitude, and
that such things as rainfall and
wind correspond even less to la-
titude. By 1879, climate special-
ist had broken away from the
ancient Greek concept, and in
1900 a German scientist, W. Kop-
pen, made the first attempt at a
modern map of world cli tes.
Since then, other factors ha
been discovered to be equally
important, such as the degree to
which rainfall is lost to the land
through evaporation.
When Unesco's arid zone pro-
gramme was set up, one of the
first things scientists needed
was an accurate, up-to-date
map of the world's dry climates.
Dr. Peveril Meigs, chairman of
the Arid Zone Committee of
the International Geographical
Union in Washington, was asked
to prepare it. Dr. Meigs's maps,
published on this and the fol-
lowing pages, are based on the
most recent information today
available and on the various
factors which are now studied in
connexion with aridity. They
represent the most accurate
world maps of the arid zones
available today. For this issue,
the maps have been slightly
simplified for the non-technical
reader, but their essential con-
tents remain unaltered.
Deserts have different degrees
of dryness. Terms such as arid,
desert, semi-arid, semi-desert,
and extreme desert are still used
in many ways by many autho-
rities. Mr. Meigs found it ne-
cessary, therefore, before deli-
miting the zones, to define the
terms he was going to use to
classify them.
On the opposite page are the
definitions used by Dr. Meigs for
his classification of extreme
arid, arid and semi-arid zones,
which are shown on the maps
as "E", "A" and "S". The dry
climates are shown to occur in
five great regions separated
from one another by oceans or
by wet equatorial zones. The
largest is the North Africa and
Eurasia dry province. The other
dry provinces are the North
American, the South African,
the Australian and the South
American. In each of these a
core of desert, partly surround-
ed by semi-arid lands, borders
the west coasts of the contin-
ents and extends inland and
toward the pole.
It is interesting to note that
narrow strips of coastal desert
border all five of the world's
dry regions. The west coastal
desert-widely found in North
and South Africa, North and
South America and Australia-
is cool for its latitude, and in
many areas is marked by fre-
quent fogs from the sea. The
east coast type, along the Red
Sea, Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf
and Gulf of Oman, has very
high humidities along with in-
tense heat.
The Unesco maps are very im-
portant for the fight against the

desert. First they show the lands involved in the
"arid zone"and at the same time suggest some of
the principal differences and similarities between
different parts of the zone. Here is an example of
how a scientist can use them.
Suppose an arid zone specialist wants to know
what results other areas with a similar environment
have had with certain new plants or with different
methods of land development. He can find on the
maps the other localities of êhe world which have
broadly similar climates. Having narrowed down
his search to areas of general similarity, he can
then, if he wishes, look into the climatic records of
the individual regions for more details of tempera-
ture and rainfall, as well as, other factors such as
winds, clouds and humidity.
For instance, a scientist in northern Venezuela
finds his climate is classified as Sb33. Looking over
the map, he sees there are similar rainfall and
temperature areas in North-East Brazil, a corner of
Ecuador, North Yucatan, near Dakar, parts of East
Africa, and North-East Australia. If further detail-
ed investigations showed these areas to be similar
in other respects too, he could safely introduce the
same or similar plants or animals bred in those
regions with success.
The Unesco map, while useful for general world-
wide comparisons, cannot show the numerous local
variations of climate, particularly in mountainous
areas where climate differs greatly in short dis-
tances. More detailed local maps are still urgently
needed on such factors as humidity, cloud, fog,
wind intensity and solar radiation, in order to add
to science's knowledge of the climate resources of
the arid zones.
According to a list prepared by the International
Geographical Union and revised by the Unesco Ad-
visory Committee on Arid Zone Research, the fol-
lowing countries have arid and semi-arid areas.
Groups I and II list countries in which extreme arid
and arid land together comprise more than one-
third of the total land area (semi-arid not being
taken into account). Groups III, IV and V con-
tain countries in which extreme arid and arid land
together comprise less than one-third of total area
and in which semi-arid land has also been taken
into account. Countries are grouped in descending
order of magnitude of percentages :
I.-Extreme arid and arid totalling 67 per cent
or more : Spanish North Africa, Egypt, Libya, Aden,
Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan,
French North Africa, Iraq, Jordan.
II.-Extreme arid and arid totalling from 33 to
66 per cent : Somaliland, Iran, Israel, French West
Africa, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, South-West Africa,
Afghanistan, Eritrea, Australia, Chile.
III.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
33 per cent or more : Syria, Bechuanaland, Ethio-
pia, Kenya, Mongolia, Union of South Africa, Ar-
gentina, Mexico, French Equatorial Africa, India,
China, Turkey, United States.
IV.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
from ten to 33 per cent : Spain, Bolivia, Nigeria,
Angola, Tanganyika, U. S. S. R., Madagascar, Peru,
Mozambique.
V.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
less than ten per cent : Southern Rhodesia, Brazil,
Cameroons, Canada, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Domi-
nican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Venezuela.

, From northern Africa across the Middle East
to India, Pakistan and Mongolia stretches a
dry belt larger than all the other dry areas of
the world combined, The great Sahara is the
world's largest single desert. It is made
up not only of the extremely arid stretches
where practically nothing grows but also of
arid areas which have some vegetation and
animal life. To the south is the semi-arid
tropical belt of the Sudanese Sahel. The east
African offshoot includes the intensely hot
"horn"area where Lugh Ferrandi, in Italian
Somaliland, has the highest mean annual tem-
perature of any weather station in the world.
f)
IThe map shows that most the Middle East is
extremely arid or arid. The Mediterranean
coastal area and Iran are characterized by mild
or cool winters while northward and eastward
are the vast deserts and steppes of U. S. S. R.,
Chinese Turkistan and Mongolia with sub-
freezing winters and warm or hot summers.
) The South African dry area consists chiefly ofthe narrow elongated coastal desert of the
Namib in South-West Africa and Loanda in
Portuguese Angola, as well as the Karroo and
Kalahari deserts. Two other dry areas, often
omitted from world climatic maps, are found
in Madagascar and Mozambique. Dry cli-
mates with cold winters are not represented
in any of the continents south of the equator.
IThe entire island continent of Australia, com-
prising just under three million square miles,
is dry except for small fringes along the coast.
The central one-third of the nation has less
than ten inches of rain a year and only the
peripheral zone (a quarter of the total area)
has sufficient rain to grow crops. The semi-
arid zone in between is a great grazing area.
