P OL ICE AG A INST RACISM
◗ Asbel López
Training schemes in several European countries are getting to grips with the stereotyping and
prejudice that all too often influence police behaviour
■
In a vast salon in Monceau Castle
( B e l gi u m ) , 13 policemen from
Charleroi,a town in the centre of the
country, have been divided into teams
and are absorbed in a boisterous card
game.The officers, unarmed and wearing
civilian clothes, are all men in their for-
ties. Today, in early October, they are
taking part in the fourth session of a
workshop against racism and xenophobia
run by the Centre for Equal Opportunity
and the Fight Against Racism, a Brussels-
based public institution founded in 1993.
Laughter erupts from the policemen
and the Centre’s two instructors when the
w i n n e rs of each game go on to the next
round of the contest.This time they will be
playing a game according to rules none of
them will know.
A game with unknown rules
Jean,who has spent half his 42 years in
the police force, s ays this is what happens to
i m m i grants when “they arri ve in a country
without knowing the rules and when the
rules they have back home are no use
because they don’t work in the new society.”
For example,he says, rules for women
in Islamic countries are ve ry different from
those in the We s t .L ater on, d u ring a review
of the session, Jean says he has never had the
chance to talk about such things or discuss
the relationship he has with immigrants in
the course of his work.
The workshop is one of 11 projects that
nine European countries are carrying out
under an international programme called
NGOs and Police Against Prejudice
(NAPAP), set up by the European Com-
mission in 1997 to fight racism and xeno-
phobia through workshops for members of
the police.
Each country has its own pri o rities and
m e t h o d s. As part of the British project
m e m b e rs of minority ethnic groups are
invited to take part in the training courses.

The Catalans hold day courses for their
police run by local immigrant gr o u p s.
France stresses the social integr ation of
i m m i gr a n t s. In Germ a ny emphasis is laid on
making police more aware of the problems
that arise in a multicultural society.
In recent years racism and xenophobia
h ave increased in many European coun-
t ri e s , especially because of economic cri s i s ,
u n e m p l oy m e n t , a rise in the immigr a n t
population and anti-foreigner propaganda
by extreme right-wing parties who are get-
ting more and more vo t e s1. In this situat i o n ,
police forces are in a particularly exposed
position.
The Centre, which records and pur-
sues cases of racist behaviour, says that in
Belgium more complaints about discrimi-
n ation based on the ori gin of an individual
are laid against the police than against any
other gr o u p2.The situation is also troubling
in other European countries. In Britain, a
report by a former High Court judge, Sir
William Macphers o n , said in early 1999
t h at there was “institutionalized racism” i n
L o n d o n ’s Metropolitan police force. I n
G e rm a ny, an official survey showed that
police violence against foreigners was “ n o t
just a matter of isolated cases”. Amnesty
I n t e rn at i o n a l ’s 1999 report detailed abu s e s
by the police in France, S p a i n , Greece and
Switzerland against immigrants and mem-
bers of ethnic minorities.
In a democratic system, such things
should not happen and the police should
respect the principle of equal rights for all
citizens. To ensure such respect, the first
thing to be done is to see that stereotyping
and prejudice do not affect the professional
b e h aviour of the police. This is not easy
because police opinions and attitudes are
developed at first hand in the front line of
social confli c t , and are usually the result of
an accumulation of personal experiences,
frustrations and misunderstandings.
The workshops run by the Belgi a n
centre are special because they feature gr o u p
work drawing on personal experience and
incidents the policemen agree to talk about.

Just speaking freely and openly about these
issues is already a big step, she say s ,b e c a u s e
“putting things into words and talking about
them allows you to be more objective about
t h e m , to realize their seriousness and impor-
tance and to start thinking about them.”
This was not happening when she
s t a rted the Centre’s workshops six ye a rs
ago. At that time, training focused on the
immigrant, not the police.The aim was to
throw light on the culture of immigrants’
countries of origin, how they had come to

ficance of religious festivals like Ramadan or
practices like we a ring the chador, the shaw l

But the Centre’s officials soon noticed

only failed to make the police aware of cul-
tural diversity but was even counter-pro-
d u c t i ve .The policemen got the impression
t h at by explaining how immigrants live d ,t h e
i n s t ru c t o rs were trying to justify behav i o u r
that to them was unacceptable.They felt
they were being made fun of and this gene-

The starting point of the six-day course is
not a lecture on tolerance or study of the
U n i ve rsal Declaration of Human Rights, bu t
c o n t ri butions from the policemen duri n g
activities including card games, r o l e -
p l ay i n g, and looking at photos and fil m
e x t r a c t s.
M a risa Fe l l a , an instructor at the
C e n t r e , s ays these “apparently simple”
e xercises encourage serious reflection by the
policemen about their professional beha-
v i o u r. She remembers one occasion when
solving a puzzle opened up the subject of
c o m m u n i c ation and aggressivity and eve n-
tually turned into a debate about police
b ru t a l i t y.“They discussed their own violent
b e h aviour as policemen, when and why
they had been violent or not violent, a n d
h ow they dealt with violence by offic e rs
under their orders.” A “ f o rum for talking
and thinking” was opened and allowe d
them to distance themselves from their
j o b s , something which can be hard to do
when you are in the thick of things.
A forum for talking and thinking
Bit by bit,as confidence is built up, the
participants stop using official jargon and
begin to recognize nuances. For example,
when one policeman said he could not
accept the position of women in Islam, t h i s
was already a step forwa r d , because he wa s
b e ginning to distinguish between whole-
sale rejection of Muslims and his disap-
proval of one aspect of their culture.
Fella says the most heartening aspect of
her work is to see that “behind the uni-
f o rms there are human beings who ask
t h e m s e l ves questions about their profes-
sion and about how they do their jobs.”
t ru c t o rs think we ’re ignorant and therefore
r a c i s t . . . .They gi ve us nice little talks about
i m m i gr a n t s , as if they’re all nice and
f ri e n d l y, but they’ve never patrolled the
streets like we have.”
These days, such resistance has disap-
peared or at least has subsided.The door to
change has opened. But problems still exist.
The police say they do not know exactly
h ow to put into practice what they have
l e a rned in the workshops about confli c t
management, non-verbal communication
and handling aggression when they are back
doing their job, which nearly always invo l ve s
speed, stress and confusion.
Another big problem is the progr a m m e ’s
lack of resources.The Centre has just five
instructors, three of them full-time. Only
about 300 of Belgium’s 36,200 police and
gendarmes attended workshops like these
between 1994 and 1998. A medium-term
proposal to overcome this is to have the
current instructors train new ones.
Another weak point is that it’s senior
officers who ask for courses to be held for
their men, who are not necessarily stat i o n e d
in places where the incidence of racial dis-
c ri m i n ation is high.W h at ’s more, the entire
staff of a police station rarely attends the
course, and this causes friction when they
go back to work.
But despite everything, those who take
p a rt agree that the process of exchange and
discussion between instru c t o rs and police is
encouraging.
Long-term effects
One instructor tells a group that five
vo l u n t e e rs are needed for a role-play i n g
game in which three policemen will play the
part of young immigrants and two others
will be the police.The first volunteers are
those who want to play the immigrants.
When the two policemen pass the gr o u p
of “ i m m i gr a n t s ” , the policeman playing the
p a rt of Fa b i o, an 18-year-old Belgian citizen
of Mediterranean ori gi n , calls them “p o u l e t s”
(chickens) a French slang word meaning
“ c o p s ” . The two policemen immediat e l y
t u rn round to arrest the yo u t h s , while their
f riends laugh at a nickname that , as police,
they have all been called at one time or
another.
When this episode is discussed after-
wa r d s , some of the policemen say they
would have just kept on walking and not
a rrested anyone for “such a trivial mat t e r ” .
Another notes that a few ye a rs ago, t h e
youths would have had their ears boxed.
The instructor uses the episode to show
how the idea of what constitutes an insult
can change over the ye a rs , pointing out that
this is not just a subjective matter and that
Sensitive issues are discussed in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
‘Behind the uniforms 
there are human beings
who ask themselves
questions about their
profession and
about how they do
their jobs’

the students gradually come to see the
connection between what they learn in the
classroom and real-life situations.
Before continuing, one of the instru c t o rs
explains to the police that they were called
“ c h i c k e n s ” because Pa ris police headquar-
ters is built on the site of an old chicken
fa rm .“ R e a l l y ? ”m u rm u rs one of them who
had no idea of this, while his colleagues
laugh.
François Delor, a psychiatrist and ins-
t ructor at the Centre, thinks this reaction is
i m p o rtant from a methodological stand-
p o i n t .“ L a u g h t e r ,” he say s , “is a way of avo i-
ding confrontat i o n . Laughing together is
sharing a kind of intimacy and that makes
it possible to work together in a climate of
trust.”
The instructor’s job is to monitor eve-
rything that is said and done during the
sessions and also to spot certain expres-
s i o n s , put them in a broader context and use
that to break down prejudices.
Fred,who has spent 17 of his 40 years
as a policeman, tells how he was once gi ve n
what he thought was a “stupid” order to
a rrest all the Gypsies in the market in C h a r-
l e r o i . But a colleague supported the order,
s aying that “regular checks, especially of
G y p s i e s , will curb cri m e .” Fred retort e d
t h at “ my job isn’t to arrest Gypsies just
because they’re Gypsies” and said it wo u l d
be better to deploy plainclothes police
who could catch thieves red-handed, w h e-
ther they were foreigners or Belgi a n s.
F r e d ’s story about the clearly xe n o p h o b i c
aspect of an order is more effective in
c o m b ating racist attitudes than any speech
because it does not come from one of the
i n s t ru c t o rs but from a fellow policeman.
Amid jokes and friendly chat in a conv i-
vial at m o s p h e r e ,s e n s i t i ve and serious sub-
jects are raised quite easily. But how can we
be sure these policemen will incorp o r at e
into their professional lives some of the
things they have seen and heard in these
workshops and behave more fairly towa r d s
immigrants in general?
Delor is firmly convinced that exchanges
like these have positive effects which may
some day influence the minds of these men
and change the way they act. “Words and
exchanges which seem unimportant some-
times have surp rising effects in the long
term.” He adds that people tend to absorb
as a “potential cognitive resource” s c at t e r e d
elements whose utility may not be obvious
at the time.
This seems to be confirmed by Chri s t i a n
Raes, an assistant police commissioner in
B ru s s e l s. In an interview in the Belgi a n
daily newspaper Le Matin in July 1999, he
said that during the training at the Centre
“bonds were forged between members of
the group and something of that has
remained. I haven’t changed dramatically,
but sometimes I look at things in a different
way and also try to spend a bit more time lis-
tening to my men.”
The Centre’s workshops are undoubtedly
helping the fight against racism and xe n o-
p h o b i a .But changing behaviour pat t e rns that
are deeply rooted in a society is a long-haul
job whch depends,as eve r ,on the enthusiasm
and determ i n ation of eve ryo n e . ■
Group work drawing on personal experience is a key feature of the Belgian police training courses against racism and xenophobia.
