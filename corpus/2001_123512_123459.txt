New Zealand:
the right medicine
Rich or poor, no country is spared from a literacy problem. In New Zealand, caregivers
in a retirement home have gained a new grasp on their job thanks to Workbase, one of this month’s
International Literacy Day prize-winners 
hen Julie Ahloo was first employed as a
rest home caregiver four years ago, she
hardly spoke to her work mates.She kept
quiet to hide her difficulty with reading
and understanding the medical terms on
patients’ care plans. The 34-year- o l d
Samoan woman did not have the courage
to ask for help either, in case her poor
literacy skills caused her to lose her job.
At the time, Julie Ahloo was not the
only caregiver in this position at
Au c k l a n d ’s Mercy Parklands Hospital
and Retirement home.The 94-bed private
i n s t i t u t i o n ,owned by the Sisters of Mercy,
had noticed rising inaccuracies and lack
of detail in patient care plans, on which
caregivers are supposed to record a
r e s i d e n t ’s food and liquid intake and
other issues relating to their health.M a n y
of the 45 caregivers, employed to feed,
dress and bath patients,were also having
problems reading basic flow charts and
detailing a patient’s weekly activities,
including dates and times.
Overcoming shame
“ We thought the flow charts were
quite simple to understand,but we started
to realize that many of our workers
c o u l d n ’t understand basic math,” s a i d
Jacki Richardson, the chief executive of
M e r cy Parklands. In an effort to improve
the business’ day-to-day operation, M e r cy
Parklands decided to offer its staff on-site
l i t e r a cy and numeracy programmes, w i t h
the incentive of being paid to improve
their skills. Richardson said the business
also wanted to boost the confidence of its
caregiver staff members,who were largely
unqualified Maori and Pacific Island
women.Most spoke English as a second
l a n g u a g e. M e r cy Parklands was also
committed to running community
outreach projects, which could benefit
staff and their families.“ We really wanted
to improve staff morale...the caregivers
didn’t feel like they had anything to say,
but we wanted their input into the
business,” she said.
M e r cy Parklands employed
Wo r k b a s e,New Zealand’s national centre
for workplace literacy and language, to
design a programme to help any non-
q u a l i fied staff who wanted to improve
their skills.
Established in 1996, Workbase is a

Programmes are tailored for Maori,who tend to be at the low end of the literacy scale.
I N T E R N ATIONAL LITERACY DAY

partnership with business, the education
sector and the government to improve
English language, l i t e r a cy and numeracy
skills in the workplace. New Zealand’s
participation in the OECD’s
International Adult Literacy Survey
(1998) found that 40 percent of people
employed in New Zealand businesses are
below the minimum level of literacy
competence required for everyday life
and work.
Today there are about 40 Workbase
l i t e r a cy programmes running in New
Zealand businesses, operating across a
range of sectors, including manufacturing,
forestry and construction. Th e
p r o g r a m m e s,which predominantly reach
Maori and Pacific Island people, a r e
designed to build literacy skills
concurrently with the technical skills and
knowledge needed within a particular
w o r k p l a c e. Since 1997,more than 20 staff
at Mercy Parklands have attended weekly
sessions with a Workbase tutor. Twelve
caregivers have just completed National
Certificates in Support of the Older
Person.
All of them started out learning basic
l i t e r a cy, n u m e r a cy and oral
communication programmes, accredited
by New Zealand’s national qualific a t i o n s ’
framework.“When they started,some of
them were too embarrassed to show me
their answers,” said tutor Andi McNish.
“Now they’re a really feisty bunch,with
heaps of confidence and ideas.” S p e n d i n g
around 30 minutes with each caregiver
once a week, McNish designs personal
study programmes for each caregiver,
including homework and assessments. S h e
also has the help of a part-time registered
nurse from the hospital, who has been
trained as a tutor to assist the caregivers.
Moving up
in the world
“Everything has been tied in to their
w o r k . For example, if we were doing
r e a d i n g, then we would look at the in-
house staff newsletter,” said  McNish,
who works with several other companies
as a Workbase tutor. M e r cy Parklands,
which spends more than $30,000 a year
running the programme, has been
rewarded with fewer mistakes and a more
confident and motivated workforce.
Morale has soared.
Caregivers take greater interest in
the operational side of the business and
are not afraid to offer suggestions about
patient care, according to senior staff.
Richardson said the quality of
d o c u m e n t a t i o n , required by health
a u t h o r i t i e s, had improved dramatically.
“They are much closer to the patients
and are able to advocate for their needs
much more. Because they [the
caregivers] have achieved something,
t h e y ’re so much more confid e n t .I t ’s like
working with a completely different
group ofstaff.”
Four years after beginning a basic
n u m e r a cy and literacy programme
through Workbase, Julie Ahloo has just
earned her first qualification — a National
Certificate in Support of the Older
Person. She has received a pay rise and
helps her young children with their
reading and writing homework after
school.
“I’m a very different person now,”
she said.“I used to have low self-esteem,
I wanted to speak up but I couldn’t.But
I’m very assertive now, I’ve got so much
more confidence,” said Ahloo, who left
school at age 14 with no qualifications.
Today she is making plans to study
nursing. ■
