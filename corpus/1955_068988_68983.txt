STRANGE FACTS ABOUT
NEPTUNE'S REALM
E
VERYONE knows that fish breathe
through their gills but not so
many people know that there are fish
which have both gills and lungs and
can live either in water or on land
according to circumstance. These fish
are known as dipnoi and it may be
that the transition from aquatic to
terrestrial existence was first made by
animals of this type.
Walking on the sea
In the Sargasso Sea in
the North Atlantic
ocean a sea slug spends much
of its time crawling under
the waves, much as flies
walk on the ceiling. The body
of the slug clings to the sea's
surface by capillary action.
It is admirably camouflaged
as the upper part of the body
which is turned to the sky is
blue and, therefore, birds
cannot distinguish it. The
underside is white and is
thus unseen by fish. Were it
not for this protective co¬
louring it would not survive.
Tree-climbing fish
The anabas, or climb¬
ing perch, lives in
the swamps of South Asia
(India, Malaya and Indo¬
china). This strange fish
can crawl over dry land for
several hours and can climb
trees with the help of its fins.
Cure for malaria
Two types of fish, cal¬
led the guppy and
the gambusia, feed mainly
on mosquito larvae which
they find on the surface of
the water. As they devour
enormous quantities of larvae
they have been acclimatised
in many parts of the world
to help in clearing mosquito
infected areas.
Longevity champions
The age of a scaly fish can be
determined by examination of
its scales, in much the same way as
the age of a tree is calculated by the
number of concentric rings in a sec¬
tion. Contrary to popular opinion it
seems that no fish reaches the age of
100. Carp may live from 25 up to a
maximum of 50 years and two sheat-
fish were known to have lived for more
than 50 years in England. The pike is
also a long-lived fish. On the other
side the stickleback, a European river,
fish, lives for less than two years.
Wanteda Jonah
This strange piece of research
was conducted with a view to
discovering a new method of preserving
whale meat. A British physiologist
decided that the only sure way was to
swim up to a whale which was prepar¬
ing to surface for the last time and
plant a metal recording thermometer in
its stomach. This odd task was
successfully accomplished and it was
found that when sea water was allowed
to enter the body of a whale the meat
was oetter preserved and the flavour
improved. The method was later
adopted by whaling crews.
Duels in the deep
When the sperm whale, which
may weigh anything up to 70
tons, hunts the giant squid a conflict
develops which, for size, is unmatched
Ibs^
by François Le Lionnais
in the world. The squid is sometimes
over 30 feet in length and its tentacles
measure another 20 feet. It usually
lives 1,500 feet below the surface of the
ocean and the sperm whale plunges to
this depth to hunt and fight it. No
man has ever witnessed the undersea
duel between these two monsters, but
when sperm whales are caught, the
scars of wounds inflicted by the squid's
suckers are often seen on their backs
and fragments of squid are found in
the whale's stomach.
A male gives birth
The sea horse is a curious little
fish which has a hçad like a
horse and a body resembling a cater¬
pillar. It belongs to one of the few
species of living creatures !"*. which
pregnancy is the function of the male
and not of the female. At the moment
of impregnation the female lays her
eggs in a pocket situated in the
stomach of the male. The gestation
period is two months and to judge by
the contortions which accompany it the
confinement of the male sea horse is
apparently as painful as for any other
female.
Fertility record
The fertility of certain fish is
phenomenal but there can be
no question that the record holder is
the turbot which can lay up to 12 mil¬
lion eggs at one time. Obviously the
majority of this offspring cannot hope
to find food and are thus
condemned to disappear be¬
fore they can reproduce
themselves. However, if the
world turbot population were
a hundred times greater than
it is there would be an ap¬
preciable addition to the hu¬
man food supply.
Sexual habits
Differences between
the sexes are fre¬
quently more striking in fish
than they are in mammals.
For example the male cera-
tiae can only exist by at¬
taching himself to the sides
or the head of the female.
Eventually the male becomes
firmly fastened to the female
and cannot be removed
without tearing the tissue.
Usually each female carries
two or three males. A simi¬
lar phenomenon is found
with the deep sea fish, the
photorynus spiniceps, where
the male spends his entire
life attached to the female
like a small horn on the
forehead.
Sexual differences are even
sharper in the lower animal
species such as the bonellia,
a worm which is found off
the European coasts. The
female may attain, when
extended, a length of over
six feet. For a long time in¬
vestigators were unable to
discover any males of the
species, but about the middle
of the nineteenth century it
was found that the male,
which only measured from 1/25 to
1/12 of an inch in length entered the
mouth of the female, made his way
towards the middle of her body and
lived thereafter as a parasite inside
his mate.
Seas and oceans : a few figures
The seas and oceans occupy
approximately 72 % of the
surface of the globe. In terms of
statistics the overall area is about
200,000,000 square miles of which the
land mass occupies some 56,000,000
square miles (including rivers and fresh
water lakes) and the seas and oceans
take up the remainder. The average
depth of the seas and oceans of the
world is something like 12,000 feet, but
this can only be an approximate
figure as large ocean areas in the Arctic
which lie under the ice have not been
systematically explored in depth.
Although only 2 per cent of the land

surface of the globe rises two and a
half miles above sea level almost 50 %
of the ocean bed lies the same distance
below the surface of the sea. The
world beneath the seas is greater than
the world above them.
Upside-down mountains
The highest mountain in the
world, Everest, rises to a height
of 29,034 feet, but in the Pacific Ocean
near the island of Mindanao in the
Philippines the sea plunges to a fan¬
tastic depth of 35,530 feet. This figure
is the world's record for ocean depth.
At this same point in the Pacific, the
Snellen in 1930 plumbed the greatest
known depth by line. A piece of red
clay was brought to the surface from
the ocean bed 33,000 feet below.
World's tidal contrasts
The Bay of Fundy on Canada's
Nova Scotian coastline has the
distinction of having the largest tides
in the world. Twice every day 100,000
million tons of sea water are swept into
the Bay causing tides which reach a
height of nearly fifty feet. By way of
contrast to this gigantic inrush of
30
water the Mediterranean is practically
tideless.
Ocean wave globetrotters
O cean waves are great travellers
and it has now been discovered
that some will begin their life in the
southernmost seas of the world and
after that traverse a quarter of the
circumference of the globe, some 6,500
miles, before they disappear and die.
Meteorologists are now studying the life
of waves and wave motion and record¬
ing their results. This information has
made it possible to predict in advance
the arrival of hurricanes and storms.
Herrings in History
Throughout the Middle Ages
the herring played an im¬
portant part in the economic
and political life of Europe. In the
thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries the herring shoals were
concentrated in the Sound and the
Belt, the narrow passages between the
North Sea and the Baltic. Ports in
Denmark and Southern Sweden owed
their prosperity to this fact and one
of the reasons for the establishment of
the famous Hanseatic League of North
German towns was the determination of
its members to enter into competition
with Denmark in the herring fishing.
But in the fifteenth century the herrings
were displaced from their usual feeding
grounds and driven into the North Sea.
The reason for this migration is still a
mystery but it is thought to have been
caused by powerful submarine currents
which followed a period of very high
tides. The departure of the herrings
weighed heavily on international
relations at the time as the ports
of Southern Sweden, Denmark and
Northern Germany were impoverished
and the ports in the Low Countries
became prosperous. It has been said
that at the time the Dutch abandoned
agriculture for herring fishing and
thereby improved their shipbuilding
and navigation.
I
Deep Sea Voices
t used to be assumed that silence
was to be found in the ocean
depths but it has now been
proved that they are actually as noisy
as a farm-yard at feeding time. Fish
utter piercing cries. They groan,
cackle and trumpet so that the deep is
filled with a cacophony of sound.
During the 1939-45 war the US Navy
made a systematic study of the noises
made by fish for two very particular

Unesco Courier. Nr 5. 1955
reasons. The acoustic mines which
were then being brought into use were
exploded by the vibrations caused by
the noise of ships motors but it was
feared that the sounds made by fish
might also explode these mines. Ultra¬
sensitive microphones had been sunk
deep in the sea near the US coastline
to pick up the noise made by submarine
motors but it was found that these
were also picking up the noises of the
undersea world, thus making it im¬
possible to distinguish the sound of the
submarines. Special electrical filters
were constructed to eliminate the
undersea noises but retaining the
noises made by ships engines.
The study of sounds made by marine
animals is only in its infancy, but
although many mysteries remain to be
solved it is possible to gain a fair idea
of the whole strange . phenomenon.
Fish do not possess vocal cords and so
they produce noises by grinding their
teeth, oscillating their air bladders,
rubbing their bones together and
jerking their heads. It is of some
interest to note that while" the human
muscle can produce only 36 vibrations
per second that of certain fish can
produce up to 2,332.
In old age the "voices" of fish, both
of the male and female, tend to become
lower in tone. In those types which
produce sounds by means of their air
bladder this fact is explained by the
elongation of the bladder with the
consequent lowering in pitch of the
sounds made.
It is now possible to distinguish
certain types of fish by their "voices".
However, this study has not proved as
easy as it was thought at first as when
fish are taken into captivity for the
purpose of recording the sounds which
they make, it is found that they do not
produce the same amount of sound as
when they are at large in the ocean:
some even become quite dumb.
Fish are not the only marine animals
capable of producing sounds. One type
of round shrimp makes a frying noise
by knocking its claws together. This
sound, when made by one shrimp is
practically imperceptible, but it is quite
noticeable when there are some
hundreds grouped together on a rock.
Aircraft made of sea water
Sea water contains between
350,000 and 400,000 tons of mag¬
nesium per cubic mile. In 1941
scientists devised a method of extract¬
ing the metal directly from sea water
by means of a chemical process. One
aircraft contains on an average half a
ton of magnesium and it was due to the
extraction of magnesium from sea
water that aircraft production was
expanded so rapidly during the course
of the Second World War.

Gold not worth the taking
very ton of sea water contains
about three quarters of a grain
of gold and if all the gold were extract¬
ed from the seas and oceans of the
world there would be available 77,000 lbs
of gold for every single person. Unfor¬
tunately the cost of production of this
gold comes to more than it would be
worth.
Killed by their own weight
Large whales can weigh anything
up to a maximum of 100 tons
and this enormous weight when
suspended in water is consequently re¬
duced in conformity with the principle
of Archimedes. Normally, therefore,
whales are supported by the water and
the muscles which they use for
breathing have no need to be par¬
ticularly strong. But once caught on dry
land their soft underbodies are pressed
down so hard on the unyielding ground
by their own weight that it becomes
impossible for them to breathe, and in
the matter of an hour or so they have
been smothered, not for lack of air, but
for lack of strength to expand their
lungs against their own enormous
weight.
