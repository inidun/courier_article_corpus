Save that 
swamp! 
To create more agricultural land, governments 
have drained marshes and swamps — 
thus losing a key element in water recycling 
and bio-diversity 
etlands have often been seen as 
wastelands, with governments seeking to 
drain them, whether to eliminate malaria 
and other water-borne diseases or to create more 
land for agriculture or development. 
But now the world’s swamps, bogs and marshes 
are coming back into their own as scientists discover 
the vital role they play in regulating water quality 
and quantity, providing a critical habitat for plants 
and animals and influencing the local climate. 
Wetlands capture and retain rainfall, and prevent 
valuable sediments from being washed into lakes 
and rivers. They add moisture to the atmosphere, 
which falls as rain and cools the environment. They 
can even be used as sewage-treatment plants that 
require little technology or maintenance. 
About half of the world’s wetlands, ranging from 
the fast-disappearing mangrove swamps in East 
Asia to the environmentally challenged Jamaica Bay 
marshes, a few miles from downtown New York, 
have disappeared in the last 100 years. Many of 
those that remain have been fragmented with dams, 
sluices and canals. 
Mostly the wetlands have receded under pressure 
from growing populations and urban sprawl. But 
sometimes they have been deliberately eradicated 
as in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein’s regime drained 
most of the vast marshlands that have stood between 
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers since the dawn of 
history, and turned much of its population into 
refugees. 
Patrick Denny, a wetlands scientist at the IHE-Delft 
Institute for Water Education (Netherlands), has spent 
much of his career in Uganda, the second country in 
the world after Canada to grant official protection to 
its extensive wetlands by constitutional law. 
For Professor Denny a good wetland acts both as a 
sponge and a filter. 
“It holds water, and allows a river to be released 
more slowly,” he says. “It keeps the rivers flowing.

In the dry season it keeps the streams trickling. It 
gives time for the water to recharge the aquifer and 
keeps the water table up.” 
Without this sponge function, rivers flow faster 
and carry off valuable nutrients, soil and organic 
matter from up-stream. Not only is this an economic 
waste, but the nutrients can damage lakes and kill 
fish by promoting an explosive growth of algae and 
reducing the oxygen at deeper levels - a process 
known as eutrophication. 
The effects of neglecting wetlands can be seen 
in the world’s largest tropical lake, Lake Victoria, 
which is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, 
and is a source of livelihood, food and employment 
for more than 30 million people. 
The once astonishing diversity of fish species 
in the lake has been depleted not only by the 
introduction of aggressive non-native species but 
also because of the runoff of pollution and silt from 
the catchment. 
Protection of the lake’s environment was 
one of the reasons that prompted the Ugandan

is that wetlands are 
wastelands,” says 
Professor Denny. “I can 
think of nothing further 
from the truth. If water p

and wetland systems are 
well managed, then health 
issues are not as serious 
as one might believe. 
Disease usually comes 
from poorly managed systems in which human 
beings themselves have changed the balance of 
nature. In a naturally functioning system with good 
biological diversity, you are not likely to have many 
mosquitoes because of the amount of fish, insects 
and birds that eat the larvae.” 
Wetlands act as a natural purification. It is also 
possible to create small artificial wetlands to treat 
the sewage output of a village or clean the effluent 
from conventional sewage plants, which in Africa 
frequently fail to function because of electricity cuts 
and poor maintenance. 
Seeded with fast-growing papyrus, which has 
many economic applications, the marshes not only 
filter out the impurities but recycle nutrients as well. 
This produces food for the invertebrates, which in 
turn provide nourishment for fish and birds. 
“If you have more diversity, there is a greater 
chance that the people who live in those systems 
can have a sustainable way of life,” says Professor 
Denny. “Riparian people can ensure a supply of 
fish by helping nature by digging ponds where fish 
collect. The ponds remain flooded in the dry season: 
the fish are fed on domestic waste and can grow fat.” 
Even industrialized nations, he says, are starting 
to undo some of the hard engineering of rivers 
and lakes and allow water to occupy natural flood 
plains with beneficial effects for the people, the 
environment, for biological diversity and for the 
aquifers.
