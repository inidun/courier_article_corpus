ness 01 Luxembourg school children who
contributed towards the cost 01 the camp,
these youngsters repaired and decorated a

Luxembourg.
THIS summer one of the most
beautiful buildings in
Luxembourg, the castle of
Sane , at Esch-sur-Alzette,
became for one month, a
Europe in miniature. Forty children- all war victims-aged between
14 and 17, arrived there and set up
an international, self-governing camp.
Among them were Dutch, Germans,
Italians, Swiss, Belgians, French and
English.
Thev came from some of the child-
ren's communities which have sprung
up all over Europe in the past few
years. In these com mum ties live
boys and girls whose parents have
been killed or deported children who
have become delinquents for lack of
proper home life, and who have been
taken off the streets and out of
unhealthy slums to be given the
chance of becoming self-respecting
and respected members of a commu-
nity.
On the invitation of the Luxem-
bourg Teachers'Federation, the camp
was organized under the auspices of
Unesco and the FICE (Federation
Internationale de Communaut√©s d'En-
fants). The castle of Sanem was
loaned to the FICE by the Commune
of Esch-sur-AIzette and contributions
from Luxembourg school-children
provided the up-kecp of their guests
from other countries.
As a token of thanks to their hosts,
the children attending the camp, re-
paired. and decorated a room in the
castle, which is now being turned
into a permanent community for the
children of Luxembourg.
Excursions were arranged so that
the children could learn about their
host country. Living and working
together, they wrote and produced
plays in five languages and composed
songs and verses.
One result of this mingling of dif-
ferent nationalities was an appeal
drafted by them and addressed to all
children's communities. It called
on the Communities to unite in efforts
to :
"present new wars from setting the
youth of the world against each
ocher" ; and,
"improve the spirit of responsibility
and constructive work in all commu-
nities and collaboration between
them"."
The Sanem camp also provided an
opportunity for educationists to
observe the psychological and physi-
cal development of the children, most
of whom have suffered mentally and
physically from their experiences
during and since the war.
Before they left the Sanem camp
last month, the children decided to
organize and finance a similar-camp
next year and formed an internatio-
nal secretariat, in which they invited
FICE to join. In the meantime, they
intend to publish their own periodi-
c&1 review. A member of the Re-
naissance Community in Rome will
assemble and edit the material and
send it to OdenwaLdschute in Germa-
ny for printing. From there it will
go out to children's communities-
each contribution being printed in its
original language.
