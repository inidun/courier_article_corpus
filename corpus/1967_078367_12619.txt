ECHOES
FROM
OUR NOISY
WORLD
New techniques to reduce the noise
of building construction have recently
been introduced. But little has been done
to muffle the demolition operations that
often precede work on a new building.
Here, rubble from old buildings thunders
to the ground under the impact of
sledge-hammers and bulldozers. People
in nearby apartments try to live with
the din, and hope that the building
operations will be less disturbing.

Dogs, cats and flying bats.
Many animals have far more per¬
ceptive hearing than man. Dogs have
a remarkable "auditory memory" and
can recognize a change of even an
eighth of a tone in a signal taught them
weeks earlier. Canine noise recepti¬
vity extends two octaves above that
of a human being (a cat's only one
octave). As they fly, bats give a
continuous cry so high pitched as to
be inaudible to man. When these
supersonic waves strike obstacles in
the path of the bat they echo back
to its sensitive ears and enable it to
take avoiding action. With this remark¬
able "radar" apparatus bats can fly
in pitch darkness without danger of
collisions. Experiments reveal that
salt water fish hear only deep-toned
sounds whereas fresh water fish hear
high-pitched ones.
A noise 'cure' good
for everyone
The growth of motor transport in
the past 20 years has led many coun¬
tries to revise their traffic codes
sometimes in the face of public opin¬
ion. The decision to forbid the use
of motor horns in Paris was one such
controversial move, and motorists in
particular predicted that street acci¬
dents would increase. In practice the
measure was remarkably successful.
With a show of self-restraint that
surprised the Parisians themselves the
honking and blaring of horns was stil¬
led from one day to the next. Paris
now wonders how it ever managed to
endure such a futile and nerve-racking
din.

8 DECIBELS TOO
MANY. Tokyo, with its
11 million inhabitants,
wages an incessant
campaign against
unnecessary and
excessive noise. At
the entrance to
the Nishi-Ginza
underground station,
for instance, a big
hoarding indicates
the local noise level.
It shows the
number of decibels
allowed 50 in
residential areas;
70 elsewhere and
above in large
luminious figures
the actual number
of decibels being
recorded, here 78.

International agreement on noise
levels for new vehicles and a pro¬
gramme for reducing such levels
would be a step forward in the cam¬
paign against traffic noise, says a
report by the Council of Europe. The
car industry would have an incentive to
seek greater improvements in the re¬
duction of vehicle noise. So far, notes
the report, the industry has devoted
much attention to acoustic performance
such as mechanical and body noise,
whereas silencers for successive
models with increased engine perfor¬
mance are designed so as to avoid a
large power loss. "Though efforts
are directed to perfecting more effi¬
cient silencers." says the report, "mo¬
torcycle manufacturers find that the
greater demand is not for the more
silent types."
Noise a killer
Laboratory experiments have dem¬
onstrated that sound with an intensity
of 150 to 160 decibels is fatal to
certain animals. The animals suffered
from burns, spasms and paralysis
before dying. Recent ecological stud¬
ies have shown that rats exposed
to loud noise exhibit a marked decline
in the pregnancy rate.
Sound outpaced
Passengers on tomorrow's super¬
sonic flights will not be bothered in
flight by the noise of the aircraft's jets.
At supersonic speeds an aircraft out-

paces most of the sound made by its
engines.
Repressing
a portable nuisance
Many countries have passed laws
imposing limits on noise from advertis¬
ing and entertainment. In particular
the use of loudspeakers and transistor
radios is restricted. France forbids
the playing of transistor radios on rail,

A PIECE OF NOISE. This iceberg-shaped
model is what sound would look like
if it were solid instead of vibrations
in the air. It was constructed by a
New Jersey (U.S.A.) laboratory during
research into the nature of sound and
human ability to perceive and translate
sound into knowledge stored in
the brain. The goal of this research
is improvement of communications
by telephone, radio and television.

bus and metro transport as well as in
streets and public places such as
parks and beaches. Nor is their use
tolerated in restaurants and similar
establishments.
'White noise' or
'acoustical perfume'
The humming of air conditioners and
the throbbing roar of "heat pumps",
whose large fans fill houses and
apartment buildings with heated air in
winter and cooled air in summer have
created two new forms of 'noise pollu¬
tion'. Ironically, however unwanted
the sounds these machines make, the
hiss of air inside a conditioned build¬
ing is a useful sound. Sound en¬
gineers call it "white noise" or "acous¬
tical perfume" and they use it widely,
especially in offices, to blanket dis¬
tracting sounds that spring out of
silence into disturbing acoustical relief.
Don't slam the door!
New York City has a law requiring
walls soundproof enough to reduce
any airborne noise passing through by
ULTRASONIC
'SCARECROWS'.
Ultrasound broadcast
by bats as they seek
insects for food puts

45 decibels. In Geneva, Switzerland,
it is an offence to slam a car door too
loudly. France confiscates automo¬
biles that repeat noise violations.
Rubber, plastic or leather guarded
garbage cans are now used in many
cities. Bermuda has instituted the
quiet motor-bike. Outboard motors
are losing their bark; truck mufflers that
kill the roar are now available.
How to build quietly
A New York skyscraper completed
last year proved that buildings can be
constructed quietly. People working
in offices near the new 52-story office
building reported that power lawn
mowers buzzing around their surbur-
ban homes were more disturbing than
Peoples of the Ancient World were intrigued by the intelligence
of dolphins and surrounded these playful, friendly creatures with myth
and legend. Modern science, taking a closer look at these small
relatives of the whale, has found that they emit ultrasonic noises
and use the echos from them as a kind of radar guidance device.
Photos taken during tests show (right) a dolphin "blindfolded"
and (left) the same dolphin skilfully navigating between poles in the
test tank, with the help of echos reflected back from these obstacles.

the construction job. Blasting was
muffled by special steel mesh blankets
weighing several tons each. Spread
over the blast site by cranes, they
absorbed most of the sounds of the
explosions, and also kept flying debris
safely within a confined area. All the
joints on the 14,000 tons of steel in the
frame were welded silently to eliminate
the hideous, shattering racket of con¬
ventional riveting or bolting.
Deafness
an occupational hazard
Industrial deafness caused by noise
exposure is not a new occupational
disease. It first appeared with the
( advent of steam power and the steam
boiler. It affected workers who made
riveted boilers in such numbers that it
was termed "boilermakers' disease".
The hazard of damaged hearing due to
noise is now recognized as a disabling
possibility in almost all industries and
trades. In U.S.A. it is estimated that
approximately 1,000,000 workers have
serious hearing loss due to high noise
levels in their places of work. The
potential cost to U.S. industry through
compensation for hearing loss due to
this cause is estimated at $500 million,
based on the assumption that only ten
per cent of the 4,500,000 persons who
work in areas of intense noise will
develop and file claims for compen¬
sation.
Racket in the kitchen
Measurement of noise levels in a
test apartment in a large U.S. city
showed that the kitchen is the noisest
room (generating 100 decibels or
more) when a fan, dishwasher and
garbage disposal machine are all going
at once. The living room was found
to be a satisfactory 50 decibels.
Running a vacuum cleaner raised the
level to 73 db when the nozzle was
on the rug. With the nozzle raised
the level rose to 81 db (60 db is con¬
sidered tolerable for a sports arena).

Silent power
The British Hospital Authorities use
more than 650 battery-powered electric
vehicles within hospital grounds. Their
first requirement is for a quiet running
vehicle which will not create a noise
problem for patients. Comparative
tests taken at normal town speed bet¬
ween commercial electric vehicles and
similar capacity petrol and diesel
trucks showed the following results:
Diesel: 81 decibels; petrol: 80 deci¬
bels; electric: 60 decibels (a figure
lower than for most private cars).
A little energy
can make a lot of noise
The noise of a crowd in a sports
stadium would scarcely boil a saucepan
of water, reports a conference on
"The Control of Noise" organized by
Britain's National Physical Laboratory.
Other facts from the report: The noise
of a 200,000 h.p. jet engine would
produce about 20 h.p. One 10,000th
part of the energy of this jet engine
escapes as noise. To reduce the noise
to a comfortable level, the engine
would have to be modified so that
only one part in a million of its energy
escapes as noise. To reduce it to
inaudibility, escaping energy would
have to be reduced to one part in ten
million.
A far 'buzzier' place
Even without supersonic aircraft, the
sky of the future will be a far busier
and noiser place than it is today. In
the U.S.A. alone, the 90,000 privately
owned planes of today will have
increased to 150,000 by 1975, and the
112 U.S. airports now equipped for
jets will number 300 within four years.
Electronic 'ears'
aid the deaf
Deaf people have benefitted im¬
mensely from this century's progress
in science and technology. Since 1876,
when Alexander Graham Bell's in¬
vention of the telephone was inspired
by his work with devices for the deaf,
increasingly effective hearing aids
have helped to consign the ear
trumpet to the rubbish heap. Elec¬
tronics and miniaturization (thanks to
the transistor) have given deaf people
better and more inconspicuous hear¬
ing aids (worn behind the ears or
hidden in spectacles). Improved med¬
ical equipment has brought better
understanding and diagnosis of hear¬
ing defects and in many cases modern
surgical skills can restore certain
kinds of faulty hearing to an almost
normal level.

OF THE PNEUMATIC DRILL
With their "rash" of building construction sites
and street repairs, modern cities resound to the
terrible clatter of pneumatic drills. Even "zones
of silence" around hospitals are not spared
this din (below right). People try to joke
about it (below left), but the disturbance
it causes has driven people to seek solutions.
Above, six workers use their pneumatic drills
inside a wooden shelter during an experiment
to screen a London hospital from nearby road works.
