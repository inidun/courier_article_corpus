For three hundred years the port
of Brouage on the Atlantic coast
had been one of France's greatest
harbours rich in peacetime, powerful
in wartime, and known throughout the
world. All that ended several centuries
ago. Brouage became a ghost village
almost deserted, almost derelict.
Two years ago, however, sixty
students from ten countries came to
Brouage to try to restore it to life.
The students all belonged to the inter¬
national voluntary work camp move¬
ment. Brouage was their latest assign¬
ment in the "pick and shovel" interna¬
tional co-operation for which the mo¬
vement is famous.
One of France's greatest scholars at
the time of the Renaissance, Nicolas
Alain, described the Brouage of his day
in these terms. "Right in the centre
of this plain," he wrote, "you see a
great arm of the sea reaching into the
land, forming a port which is famous
throughout Europe." Alain pointed out
that access to Brouage was as easy as it
was safe. And he added: "Vessels come
here from Germany, Flanders, England
and other countries to load salt which
is produced here in enormous quanti¬
ties."
That was the Brouage that existed
until about three centuries ago a
major Atlantic port and a famous city

Going abroad?
Persons wishing to combine their summer vacations with an
educational experience should read Unesco's latest edition of
" Vacations Abroad ". It gives details in English, French or Spanish
of nearly 800 courses, study tours or work camps up to Octo¬
ber 1955. Activities in 67 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and
America are listed. There is a section on special travel rates for
students and young people going abroad for their vacations.

that occupied an important place in
French history. It was, for instance,
the birthplace of Samuel Champlain,
the founder of Quebec in French
Canada. Most important of all, Brouage
played a key role in the struggle waged
by Cardinal Richelieu during the
Seventeenth Century Wars of Religion.
To counterbalance a hostile La Ro¬
chelle to the north, Richelieu ringed
Brouage with a mile of ramparts that
stood thirty feet high, crowned by
tall watch-towers. At one time four
thousand men were garrisoned inside
its walls, and ships-of-the-line rode at
anchor in the harbour.
But then history turned against
Brouage. Richelieu's enemies sank
ships in the harbour mouth. Gradually
the sand accumulated and the great
natural inlet sil¬
ted up. Ships
found other
ports. The people
left and the
houses fell to
ruins. Inhabi¬
tants of sur¬
rounding villages
used Brouage as
rock quarry to
build their homes.
Moss and ivy
overgrew what
was left of the
ramparts.
Today, the tra¬
veller will search
in vain for this
historic harbour.
The sea has
retreated long ago
and Brouage nas
become an inland
village. Where
there once lived
thousands of peo¬
ple, today only
two hundred and
fifty r e m a i n
mostly oyster
fishermen and
their families.
However,
Brouage still has
friends anxious
to see it preserv¬
ed as an histo¬
rical site. One
of them made
its plight known
to Concordia, a
French organiza¬
tion set up to
help direct inter¬
national camp
activities on French soil. Before long,
Brouage was assigned ' to the inter¬
national volunteers as a new project
that needed their help actually as
one ,of the more than nine hundred
projects taken on by the work camp
movement in 1953 throughout the
world.
In July 1953 tents went up outside
Brouage for the first time in three
centuries. The tents housed a peaceful
army of sixty students. Some came
from France and nearby countries.
Others came from as far away as India,
Togoland, and Viet Nam. Together the
students got down to work. They
stormed the ancient ramparts with
ladders and mountain-climbing gear
and began to restore them. They
attacked the encroaching sand dunes
with shovels, and they hacked away at
the unsightly underbrush. Once all
this preliminary work had been com¬
pleted, the French Historical Monu¬
ments Office was able to go ahead with
the delicate job of restoring the watch-
towers and the other ruins.
Brouage's inhabitants quickly adopted
the campers. The fishermen took the
foreign visitors out to the famed oyster
beds and showed them how a French
fishing village works and lives. For
both campers and fishermen, the whole
scheme was a great success a fine
experiment in international co-opera¬
tion. And the officials of Concordia,
the sponsoring organization, were so
pleased that they organized a new work
camp in 1954 to continue the job of
restoring the almost-forgotten town a
task which will be carried forward
again this year by a new group of
students.
The work camp at Brouage is only
one of hundreds of projects organized
in all parts of the world by the inter¬
national work camp movement. Re¬
cently, reports on such projects were
made at the Eighth Conference of
Organizers of International Voluntary
Work Camps, sponsored by Unesco, and
held at Marly-le-Roi, near Paris.
They showed that 69,283 young people
took part in 1859 work camps organized
during 1954. Almost half of them
(31,780) worked in village development
schemes in India: digging wells, build¬
ing roads, improving sanitation and
irrigation.
Seventy-seven camps were organized
to assist in the construction of youth
centres playgrounds or sports fields and
2,527 volunteers in 36 camps assisted
in reconstruction work after the earth¬
quakes in Greece and Algeria, the
avalanches in Austria and the floods in'
India.
