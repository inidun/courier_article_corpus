Under the guise of 'security',
collective suicide?
HEAD-SPUTTER
FOR EINSTEIN
Albert Einstein was once
asked what weapons
would be used in the
catastrophic event of a
third world war. He
replied that he had no idea
but that in a fourth world
war the only weapons
would be stone axes.
SINCE World War II, the total des¬
tructive power of the weapons
in the world's arsenals has increased
many thousandfold. In today's world,
the potential for organized violence
has assumed grotesque dimensions
so grotesque as to be beyond an
individual's comprehension.
The total explosive power of the tac¬
tical nuclear weapons stationed in Eur¬
ope alone is equivalent to more than
30 times the TNT expended in World
War II, the Korean War and the Viet-
Nam War put together. Few of these
weapons are less powerful than the
Hiroshima bomb. If nuclear war came
in Europe, the societies there would
SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute) is an independent
institute for research into problems of peace
and conflict, particularly those of disarma¬
ment and arms control. Financed by the
Swedish Parliament, which founded it in
1966 to commemorate Sweden's 150 years
of unbroken peace, it has an international
staff, governing board and consultative
scientific council. Since its foundation
SIPRI has worked closely with Unesco.
SIPRI publishes many studies on problems
of disarmament and authoritative Yearbooks
describing the situation of the world's
arsenals during the year. To promote
greater awareness of these issues, SIPRI.
under its Director. Frank Barnaby (U.K.)
is currently producing a series of booklets
specially written for the general public.
The articles on the following pages are
based on material published in three of
these booklets: Disarmament or Destruction ?,
Nuclear Disarmament or Nuclear War? and
Preventing Nuclear-weapon Proliferation,

Armaments and Disarmament.
cease to exist. Even so, these
weapons account for a mere fraction
of the total destructive power available
to the nations.
Several times in the past three
decades, mankind has approached the
brink of oblivion. How many more
times can this happen before we go
over the brink? Yet the efforts to
control the mad momentum of the
arms race have produced no significant
results. On the contrary. Military
technology advances as rapidly as
human ingenuity and skills allow.
Yesterday's science fiction becomes
today's reality.
Nuclear deterrence, a genocidal
doctrine, has become an article of
faith. And mutual assured destruction,
the most morally indefensible strategy
ever devised, is the established policy
of the big powers an official ideology
legalized by treaties. Policies de¬
signed to guarantee "security" are
more likely to guarantee nuclear
suicide.
We have learnt to live with nuclear
weapons. We have become mentally
paralyzed by the rhetoric of the arms
race, in which horror weapons are
given innocent sounding names like
Bambi and Hound Dog, euphemisms
for nuclear missiles. We have become
inured to violence impersonal, auto¬
mated violence.
Our moral judgement has been
impaired by the apocalyptic calcu¬
lations of scholars and strategists

"acceptable" in a nuclear war, how
much more megatonnage is needed
for superiority, and so on. We have
been misled by absurd statements
about the possibility of a "limited"
nuclear war, of "winning" a nuclear
war, of "damage limitation", of the
political "value" of overkill, and so on.
Can anything be done to move
towards a saner, less barbaric world?
The politicians say they have tried.
If they have, then they have failed.
It is now up to the public. To live in
a peaceful, disarmed world is a uni¬
versal desire. Can public opinion be
mobilized to press reluctant politicians
to pursue policies to this end before
it is too late? Mankind's survival may
well depend on the answer.
How much is spent on arms?
Each year the world spends an
enormous amount of money on arma¬
ments $210 billion in 1974. This
is about equal to the entire national
Income of the poorer half of mankind.
And it is about 15-20 times the total
amount of aid given to the develop¬
ing countries.
Since 1900, but excluding the years
of world wars, the world has spent
roughly $7,500 billion on armaments at
today's (1975) prices. This sum is
equivalent to about $2,500 per head of
the present world's population or a
lifetime's income for the average
Indian, for example.
Not only is the absolute amount of
money spent on armaments very large,
but the rate of Increase of military
spending is high. Even after taking
into account the decreased value of
money, the amount spent has doubled
since 1950. But the rate of increase
has not been a steady one. Through¬
out this century military expenditure
has escalated during wars and major
crises. Each such event has been
followed by a period of relative stability
but at a substantially higher level of
expenditure.
Which countries are
the big military spenders ?
For many years now the United
States and the Soviet Union have
accounted for the vast majority of the
money spent on armaments. In 1974,
for example, these two powers spent
60 per cent of the total. The two
major alliances, NATO and the Warsaw
Treaty Organization, together spent
80 per cent in 1974.
But over the past 15 years or so,
the concentration of military power has
shifted. This has happened because
the average rate of increase has
differed from country to country. In
particular, the developing countries
have, over about the past 20 years,
increased their military spending at a
higher than average rate. The most
dramatic examples are, not surpris¬
ingly, the Middle East countries. In
this region, military expenditure has
increased on average by 20 per cent
per year over the past decade a
staggering rate of increase indeed.
The rate of increase of expenditure
of the four major military spenders of
the post World War II eraU.S.A.,
U.S.S.R., UJK. and Francehas been
somewhat slower than that of most

other countries. Thus the combined
military expenditures of these countries
fell from about 82 per cent of the world
total in 1955 to about 70 per cent in
1974. But this does not mean that
their military capability has declined.
Instead, it has happened because of
the rapid expansion in the level of
armaments elsewhere. The entire
world is becoming more and more
militarized.
Where does
the money go?
An analysis of the military spending
of the 12 countries which together
account for three-quarters of world
military expenditure shows that about
30 per cent of military money is used
to pay for uniformed personnel.
Another 30 per cent goes to buy
weapons and equipment, and a further
30 per cent to construct, operate and
maintain the weapons and equipment.
The remaining 10 per cent is used for
military research and development.
Perhaps surprisingly, nuclear
weapons and their delivery systems
account for a relatively small fraction
(about 10 per cent) of the total
resources devoted to military, uses.
Even in the nuclear-weapon countries,
the bulk of the money spent on
weapons is used to procure conven¬
tional rather than nuclear weapons. It
is an extraordinary fact of modern life
that the capability to destroy totally
human civilization costs just a fraction
of 1 per cent of the world's annual
output.
Military research
and development
World expenditure on military re¬
search and development is, and has
for some time been, running close to
$25 billion annually about four times
the money spent worldwide on medi¬
cal research and is increasing stead¬
ily. The relative share of military
expenditure absorbed by research and
development has risen dramatically
since the interwar years from less
than 1 per cent to the present value
of about 10 per cent.
Over 400,000 scientists and engi¬
neers roughly half of the world's total
scientific and technical manpower are
now employed on improving existing
weapons and developing new ones.
Thirty years ago, only five countries
U.S.S.R., U.K., Canada and
Sweden were major weapon pro¬
ducers and weapon innovators. But,
by the early 1950s, some developing
countries started producing arms and
since then the number of them doing
so has been, and still is, increasing.
The establishment of a sophisticated
armaments industry is a costly under¬
taking and the diversion of scarce
resources to military production by
underdeveloped economies obviously
has very adverse effects on the rate of
development of the civilian sector.
