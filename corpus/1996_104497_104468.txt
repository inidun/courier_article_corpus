The last days of
han Chán
by Alfredo Pita
On the sandy reaches of Peru's
northern coast, lost in the wilder¬
ness a few kilometres from the
Pacific Ocean, lie the slumbering
vestiges of Chan Chán, a huge and
history-packed city built of adobe,
which for centuries has withstood
sea winds, earthquakes and rains,
which are uncommon but destruc¬
tive in this arid region of the sub¬
tropical zone.
But the greatest destruction of
all has been wrought by people in
search of building materials and
treasures. Intruders and plun¬
derers have gradually destroyed
the temples, disfigured the houses
and desecrated the tombs of the

former capital of the Chimú
Empire, which after its decline fell
into the hands of the Incas and the
Spanish, before finally being aban¬
doned. Nothing, then, remains of
Chan Chan's past splendours,
except a huge expanse of ruins cov¬
ering almost 20 square kilometres.
The name Chan Chán appar¬
ently comes from the Mohica term
jang-jang ("sun-sun"). Little is
known of what life was like there
in ancient times. But the modern
visitor, after tarrying a while in the
dead city, waiting for nightfall and
forgetting the distant roar of the
motorway, may feel the past spring
to life and sense the throb of the
thousands of people who lived,
worked and dreamed there.
It is not hard to imagine them
strolling through the city's well-
organized network of narrow
streets, entering little houses,
palaces and temples, tilling the
land, harvesting the produce of
their orchards and kitchen gar¬
dens, and observing the stars in the
hope of learning the truth about
the future and getting an answer
from the distant worlds they
thought they had come from. Like
the founder of their city, Tacay-
namo (a mysterious figure who
arrived there by sea in the eleventh
or twelfth century), the inhabi¬
tants of Chan Chán thought they
were descended from four stars of
the "Pata" constellation, which is
known to us as Orion.

And the visitor who feels
weary and falls asleep beneath a
tamarind tree may dream of the
people of ancient Chan Chán and
see them looking up at the skies
by torchlight these two young
men, for example, who have sud¬
denly stopped walking along the
sea shore and are scrutinizing the
starry heavens to find out what
the future holds in store and how
much further they have to go to
reach their destination, Chan
Chán, the capital.
Premonitory dreams
The two men are called Alentec
and Malakán. One is a prince and
administrator, the other a sculptor
and potter. But they have both
come from Paramonga, a war-torn
area on the furthermost reaches of
the kingdom. They bear bad tid¬
ings. The fortresses that were
holding back the advancing Incas
have been falling one after another.
Disaster looms unless major rein¬
forcements are sent immediately.
They know the city is not far
away now, but they have been
travelling along the shore for
nearly three days with hardly any
sleep. The following day they are
to appear before their lord, Min-
chancamán (the Chimo-Cápac). In
order to present him with a clear
report of the situation, they first
need some rest. They walk into
the dunes and, covering them¬
selves with their light coats, lie
down on a bed of warm sand.
They sleep fitfully. Their
dreams are haunted by the same
images their aproaching fate,
the end of time, the collapse of
everything that has made their
lives what they are. They belong
to different social classes but
have been friends since child¬
hood. Alentec is a nobleman,
while Malakán is of humble
origin, though he comes from a
family of artists which in a sense
makes him a nobleman: no one has
objected to the pledges of love he
has exchanged with Tsel, his
friend's young sister.
All this, and their whole world,
is now in mortal danger. The terri-
fyingly efficient army of the Inca
Pachacútec has been taking strong¬
holds and cities in the south one
after the other, and also threatens
to swooj) down on the kingdom
from the east. These are the tidings
they are bringing home: that the
lords of Cuzco have enough troops
and weapons to bring down for good
the proud Chimú Empire, which
has refused to hand over its riches
and is preventing them from
invading its vast and prosperous
coastal lands.
The Great Chimú Empire had
slowly grown up around the city in
the Moche valley where Tacay-
namo, founder of the city and the
kingdom, had arrived centuries ear¬
lier. He did not arrive alone: noble
warriors and other personages
accompanied him on great rafts.
They found a land devastated by
war and the ruins of the dying
Mochica kingdom, which had
known greatness centuries earlier.
Now the Quechua of Cuzco were
about to seize the country, just as
Tacaynamo had done in his time;
and the Chimú, if they survived,
would have to wait upon and pay
tribute to a sovereign other than
Minchancamán.
The great prince Minchan¬
camán, a descendant of Tacaynamo
and, like him, a son of the stars and
the sea, has brought the kingdom
to the height of its glory. A federa-
tive rather than a conquering

power, the Great Chimú Empire
now stretches from Paramonga and
Huarmey in the south to Tumbes
and Guayaquil in the north. The
cities and minor lordships pay
tribute to the great prince. Their
finest children and artists live in the
capital. Depending on their origins
and the art they practise, they
inhabit a district in the ten
"citadels" (or palaces) which, clus¬
tering together like an enormous
beehive, make up Chan Chán.
"It has always been so, and
maybe it will always be so as long
as time continues on its course, driv¬
ing the clouds, the river waters and
the sea," says Malakán. And his
friend replies: "if Suari, the old
woman who sells delicious chicha
(maize beer) at the market in the
gardeners' quarter is to be
believed, it has been prophesied
that within one or two generations
other founding fathers will arrive
dressed in glittering garments.
They will be the sons not of the
stars, but of the sun or the volcano,
for they will belch fin:. They will
arrive in huge ships; they will
defeat and subjugate all the peo¬
ples in this part of the world,
including the proud inhabitants of
Cuzco." "If that is true," says the
potter, "and if the Incas enter the
great city and take control of it,
then our descendants will ally
themselves with these new gods and
we shall again be free and masters
of our land." "We shall help them
so we can take revenge," Alentec
adds. "But the vanquished have no
rights before the victors. They owe
them submission."
A world on the march
With alarm, Alentec and Malakán
see in their dreams all the cities
they have known, with their tem¬
ples and their fortresses. They can
feel themselves becoming children
again, racing one sunny afternoon
through Chan Chan's narrow
streets and up and down its steps,
beneath the city's trapezoid walls,
which are as high as five or six tall
men. They know every nook and
cranny of its rectangular citadels,
of the walls marking the dividing
line between the fishermen in the
north and the farmers in the south,
between the potters and the brass-
founders. The capital has only one
entrance gate, giving straight onto
its narrow streets. This makes it
easier not only to control the popu¬
lation but to defend the city: even
the most seasoned troops will find
they have fallen inextricably into a
trap if they try to invade Chan
Chán. Alentec thinks: "This
defence system should safeguard
our future." But his friend, as
though reading his thoughts,
retorts: "Think again. We are
already being devoured from
within, just as the sweet, fleshy,
snow-white fruit of the eherimoya
tree is eaten by the worm."
Alentec knows what Malakán is

referring to. When faced with their
Inca invaders, the inhabitants of
the southern cities have already
been tempted to change sides. And
certain generals in control of border
fortresses are also beginning to
wonder whether it is worthwhile
resisting.
What, then, is going to
happen to all those people in the
hustling streets of Chan Chán,
who squeeze their way past herds
of llamas laden with maize to
make chicha and other mountain
produce, and men carrying huge
baskets full of glistening fish
back from Iluanchaco. Alentec
and Malakán walk in silence
through squares surrounded by
neatly aligned dwellings inhabited
by humble folk. They go into the
great market, wide-eyed with
curiosity and wonderment at
everything they see.
In the craftsmen's quarter, they
admire the pottery made by
Malakán's father. His jugs are the

same black colour as those of his
fellow potters, but they bear the
stamp of his personality and tem¬
perament. The neck of one of the
jugs represents the head and head¬
dress of a male figure solemnly
making love to a woman. Children
burst into laughter because they
think the figures portray the
potter's neighbours. His pots, on
the other hand, are a natural red¬
dish colour obtained by oxidization.
Malakán also uses these techniques,
but there is nothing light-hearted
about his version of realism, and his
sculptural compositions amaze both
connoisseurs and laymen with the
way they describe the joys and sor¬
rows of Chimú men and women, not
forgetting the animals that are their
faithful companions.
The two men then enter a
temple while a religious ceremony
is being celebrated and look in
amazement at the finery of the
dignitaries as they file before the
high priest. The highly sophisti¬
cated art of the Chimú gold¬
smiths is abundantly evident in
the gold and silver used for wor¬
ship, and in the masks, breast¬
plates and bracelets worn by the
nobility. The officiating priest
raises above his head a huge gold
tumi (ceremonial knife), with
turquoise inlays and a handle rep¬
resenting the divine figure of the
founding father. The knife is half
as high as a man and so heavy that
the priest finds it difficult to hold
aloft. The Chimo-Cápac wears a
gold mask and gauntlets, as well
as a diadem with pendant fig¬
urines that probably tell a story.
lie is followed by a procession of
men and women wearing head
bands decorated with feathers.
Their faces and clothes are cov¬
ered with gold and precious
stones: small discs, nose orna¬
ments, earrings, rings, pearl neck¬
laces and gold chains decorated
with human or animal figurines.
Alentec and Malakán are
excited by the brilliance of all this
gold and jewelry hut in fact it is
the fire of the rising sun that rouses
them from their slumbers. The
sun's rays will soon strike the bas-
reliefs and stuccoed paintings in
Minchancamán's Palace. The two
men look for the waters of the huge
canal which has enabled the engi¬
neers of the Great Chimú Empire
to enlarge the Moche Valley and
turn it into a vast orchard. After
washing themselves and taking a
few sips of water, they return to
the road that will lead them to the
palace. Their news is not good, but
it is a magnificent day and what dis¬
turbed their sleep was perhaps no
more than a bad dream. There
might still be a way out, a road to
salvation they do not know about,
but which the Chimo-Cápac does.
In an hour's time they will be
before him. They shout out to
announce their arrival, and sentries
answer them from the top of the
city walls. They can hear the sound
of voices and dogs barking. As soon
as they pass through the palace
door, members of the sovereign's
household will run up to welcome
them in the main courtyard.
History is certainly waiting for
them on the other side of the
door in that very courtyard
where a modern visitor lies
dreaming in the cool shade of a
tamarind tree.

CHAN CHAN IN BRIEF
The great pre-Inca metropolis of Chan Chán is
located on the right bank of the Moche 5 km from
the town ofTrujillo, on the road that leads to the
port of Huanchaco in northern Peru (La Libertad
department). It has been on Unesco's World her¬
itage List since 1986.
Chan Chán, which was the capital of the Great
Chimú Empire, is the largest pre-Hispanic city in
Latin America: it extends overan area of 20 km2 and
had about 35,000 inhabitants.
According to legend, the city was founded
in the 11th or 12th century by a mysterious figure
who arrived by seaas in the case of other peo¬
ples and nations of Latin America.
The Spanish conquistadors and their chron¬
iclers Cabello de Balboa in about 1586,
and Carlos Marcelo Come between 1604 and 1610,
collected legends that evoked its past splendour.
Archaeological evidence sugests that the Chimú
civilization succeeded the Mochica culture in
about 1200, on the very spot where that culture
had developed since the 4th century.
At the height of the Great Chimú Empire, the
Moche Valley (or the Santa Catalina Valley) became
the nerve centre of a vast empire. A highly sophis¬
ticated irrigation system diverted the river waters
along a canal about 80 km long and watered the
arid region around Chan Chán, rendering it fertile
toa degree that is difficult to imagine today.
