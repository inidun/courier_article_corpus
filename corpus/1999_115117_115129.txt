u n d e rstanding and respect for local culture. H owe ve r ,
this respect should not dive rt us from the ultimat e
g o a l : to reduce pove rt y. In my experi e n c e , l o c a l
culture is more often than not the cause of pove rt y.
From The Gambia to Nepal, it is not hard to iden-
tify cultural practices that limit the potential of
wo m e n , children or ethnic gr o u p s. The dominant
culture is structured to keep certain individuals or
groups in the service of others. It perp e t u ates their
p ove rt y.
I am not suggesting that the role of the outsider
is to arrive in a community with a list of “needed
changes”.Every community, no matter how poor,
has individuals with ve ry lucid understandings of the
cultural dynamics at play.These people have plans
and ideas on how to improve their condition. It is
the job of the outsider to understand the local
culture well enough to find these people and offer
support.
Gaining access into a community means gaining
p e o p l e ’s trust—a formidable challenge, p a rt i c u-
larly when it comes to the very poor.These people
are “ i nv i s i b l e ” . They are never the ones to gr e e t
you at the village gates but that doesn’t mean they
a r e n ’t wat c h i n g .The challenge of gaining their tru s t
becomes twice as difficult if you are seen staying with
the relat i vely we a l t hy or powerful villagers. T h e
poor will never trust you if you frequent the homes
of those considered responsible for their poverty.
A lot of time
and a little trust
Ironically, one of the most telling signs of the
ve ry poor is their silence. Organize a public meeting
to discuss the needs of the community and yo u
can be certain that those who speak the most need
your help the least.The ve ry poor are either shocked
by the idea that someone is asking them to make
demands or completely fatalistic about the chances
of their lives changing.
A lot of time and a little trust can overcome some
of this fatalism. I remember working in Sindhu-
p a l c h owk district of Nepal, where after six months
of meetings, a man finally felt comfortable to recount

In the hills of we s t e rn Nepal, a poor dairy
farmer may have little more to offer his kids
than milk to dri n k .Cut-off from the markets of
Kathmandu, these farmers must barter and trade
with middle-men to earn a mere pittance.About two
years ago, a group of local and international non-
g ove rnmental organizations decided to try and
widen the fa rm e rs ’ financial hori z o n s. To g e t h e r ,
they set up a string of collection points along the
h i g h way leading to the capital so that fa rm e rs could
drop off their milk daily, with the state dairy cor-
p o r ation looking after the supplies’ d e l i ve ry and
s a l e . Before long, they ran up against a major road-
b l o c k : the people manning the collection points
refused to accept the milk of the Dalits—the untou-
chable caste which is forbidden to handle the wat e r
or food of upper castes. By not recognizing this
d i c t ate of the local culture, they had unwittingly set
up a pove rt y - e r a d i c ation project which rejected the
poorest people.
W h at were the altern at i ves? Accept the local
culture and try to set up an alternative market for
the Dalits? Or try to break past the cultural barri e rs ?
In the end,they broke through with the support of
human rights activists who streamed in from the
capital to put pressure on the local authorities.
I tell this story to highlight a dilemma often
ignored in discussions concerning poverty-eradi-
cation: how can we respect local culture without
accepting the status quo? Local culture has become
something of a sacred cow for “ i n t e rn ational deve-
lopment experts” in the last ten years or so. This
reaction is understandable gi ven all the wa s t e d
resources and harm resulting from attempts to
“ i m p o rt ”d e velopment projects from one situat i o n
to another. In short , just because a project “ wo r k s ”
in one country or region of a country, it will not
n e c e s s a rily reap the same success in another. S o m e
of the failed plans now appear as pure folly:telling
A f rican women to stop breast-feeding their babies,
neglecting to teach children to write in their mother
tongues and trying to convince fa rm e rs to gr ow
crops their communities didn’t want to eat.
A successful project clearly requires a solid

a bit of his past.This very poor farm labourer was
once relat i vely we a l t hy. He traced his problems
back to the year his father died.According to local
custom of the Tamang ethnic group, a family must
spend a tremendous amount on a funeral,with a vil-
lage feast lasting several days and gifts of clothing
given to neighbours.This man and his wife sold a
few animals to cover the costs. The next year, his
mother died and they sold eve rything but their
house to pay for the funeral.
This man had a plan.With just one female bu f-
falo, he could earn money by breeding the animal
and selling its milk to buy back his wife’s gold jewe l-
lery which was sold to pay for the last funeral. By
building on these assets, his son would then be
able to pay for his parents’ funerals without going
into debt. In short , his solution to a better life lay in
preparing for death.
Seeing through
a cultural cloud
This man clearly understood the cause of his
p ove rt y.He had a sound financial plan for improv i n g
his condition. But cultural conceptions wo u l d
continue to reinforce his fa m i l y ’s pove rt y. My role wa s
clearly not to tell him to change his religious beliefs.
But discussions continued and broadened to include
other villagers and community gr o u p s , and before
long they decided to work with the Lamas, the reli-
gious leaders , to curtail the influence of local customs.
This “ p a rt i c i p at o ry approach” is not just a way
of changing a community’s foundations but of bu i l-
ding on its “social capital” or solidari t y. From A f ri c a
to Asia, the poorest communities have set up their
own systems of mutual assistance. Basically, each
household contributes money or material to a col-
l e c t i ve fund. The group then meets regularly to
give that money to the family most in need. The
challenge lies in building on this solidari t y : to move
from a safety-net to a means of improving the com-
m u n i t y ’s live l i h o o d . The same co-operation can
build a collective forestry project, a literacy pro-
gramme or a new irrigation system.
For some expert s , this solidarity is engrained in
the “culture of the poor”. I would like to think that
poor people are somehow more caring and
concerned for others’ well-being. But I don’t.The
s o l i d a rity seems to have stronger links to live l i h o o d
needs than culture.This may sound like academic
quibbling over wo r d s , but there is a tendency to let
the wa rm glow of culture cloud our vision of the tru e
causes of pove rt y. For example, I remember my
initial contact with a Dalit community in western
N e p a l . I was taken by the strong and intri c ate bonds
between these people. But there was no mystery
i nvo l ve d .G e n e r ations of collective margi n a l i z at i o n
forced the community to turn inwards. The chal-
lenge lay in developing this solidarity so that the
