T The political dimension mustn’t be 
forgotten either. ‘It is much less a 
problem of resources than one of 
governance’, he adds. Corruption, 
which costs millions of dollars every 
year, also takes its toll on the supply 
of water. The report quotes a sur-
vey carried out in India which stated 
that 41 % of the people questioned 
had paid bribes to falsify their water 
meter readings. 
But governance does not just 
concern developing countries. 
‘Hurricane Katrina showed just how 
unprepared the United States was 
to face such a catastrophe. The 
different levels of government did 
not work together enough’, analy-

oday, one in five people doesn’t 
have access to safe drinking water. 
The report shows that bad quality 
water kills. Diarrhoeic diseases and 
malaria caused more than three mil-
lion deaths in 2002, mostly among 
children under five. 
Already, it is estimated that certain 
regions like sub-Saharan Africa will 
not reach the Millennium target that 
aims to cut in half the proportion 
of people without access to safe 
drinking water by 2015. 
The short-term prospects are 
quite worrying. As a rule, demo-
graphic growth leads to a drop in 
the how much water is available per 
inhabitant. It is forecast that 55 % 
more food will be needed to feed 
the planet in 2030. However, cur-
rent irrigation demands already rep-
resent nearly 70 % of freshwater 
consumed. 
Freshwater is not just a technical 
issue. ‘It is not only about digging 
wells or improving the water mains. 
Water must be tackled within in a 
much wider framework. It concerns 
not only science and technology but 
also cultural and social aspects’, ex-
plains Andras Szöllösi-Nagy, Director 
of UNESCO’s Division of Water 
Sciences.

This is a crucial issue since natural 
catastrophes are becoming more 
and more frequent, with 90% of 
them being linked to water.
Reasons for hope
Nevertheless, there are signs of 
hope. There appears to be a ris-
ing level of public awareness of 
the issue. If alarmist warnings from 
experts went unheeded for a long 
time, this is no longer the case. 
Since the end of the 1990s, water 
has figured prominently on the inter-
national political agenda. The adop-
tion by the United Nations General 
Assembly in 1997 of a resolution 
dealing with water became a turn-

ing point. At the same time, more 
and more private citizens are facing 
up to the issue. 
In some Latin American countries, 
like Argentina or Bolivia, abuses 
linked to the privatisation of water 
services have given rise to signifi-
cant protest movements. Uruguay-
ans even voted a referendum to 
have water enshrined in their Con-
stitution as public property. 
‘In the Nile basin, we have also 
seen the creation of groups of citi-
zens who are very active in issues 
linked to water’, adds Richard Me-
ganck, Director of the UNESCO-
IHE Institute for Water Education in 
Delft (Netherlands). ‘The participa-
tion of people is absolutely vital if 
we want to implement sustainable 
and efficient management meth-
ods.’ 
Furthermore, certain good prac-
tices are being developed, like the 
practice in certain regions of India 
of collecting rainwater and storing 
it in underground reservoirs. 
Mechanisms for mediating con-
flicts linked to water, like the Water 
Court in Valencia, already exist and 
could be spread. 
In addition, approaches are being 
explored to improve supply tech-
niques. One of these consists in 
continuing the 20th century prac-
tice of building dams. Enormous 
projects are underway, like Grand 
Inga, which is planned for the Dem-
ocratic Republic of the Congo in 
ten years’ time. 
These projects, which have a se-
rious impact on ecosystems, also 
give rise to many doubts. 
A possible alternative for arid 
coastal countries may be to de-
salinate seawater. This technique, 
which is very costly, is already in 
use in Persian Gulf countries like 
Kuwait. 
However, these technical solutions 
will not be enough. In the future, it 
will also be necessary to consider 
water as an exhaustible resource.
