HARVESTS FROM PLANT LIFE IN THE SEA
ALL food is made by plants,
for plants alone have
mastered the process of
manufacturing certain
basic chemical substances from
which every kind of food must
come. Any type of animal,
whether it feeds directly on
plants, or only indirectly through
the flesh of other animals, must
thus depend on plant life for its
continued existence.
One of the chemical miracles
wrought by growing things is
their production of sugar from
water and the carbon dioxide gas
present in the air. It is the
action of sunlight on the green
colouring matter of plants that
brings about this so called
photo-synthesis, which is the
source of most of mankind's
energy-giving foods.
A further unique ability of
plants is the making of sub-
stances called proteins-complex
chemicals that are necessary
constituents of all living cells,
both animal and vegetable. Pro-
teins are essential to the growth
of living tissues, and while we
may get much of our protein
foods from such animal products
as meat, milk and eggs, the true
source is the growing things
upon which animals feed.
From prehistoric times man
has tapped those vast food re-
sources of ocean, lake and stream
by fishing. Is it not possible,
however, to use the plant life of
the earth's waters more directly ?
This has. indeed been done in a
limited way, for edible seaweeds
are known, and other forms of
by ire M. Freeman
sea growth have long been used
as fertilizers for land farming.
In Western Europe alone, mil-
lions of tons of seaweed are used
for this purpose each year. But
just in the last few years an
even more direct and promising-
way of garnering food and other
useful products from the vege-
table life of the sea has been
intensive ! y investigated. The
method makes use of the class
of simple organisms called algae.
These tiny plants form the fami-
liar green, slimy masses seen
on the surfaces of ponds and
lakes (some varieties are red,
others are brown).
Algae are able to use the
energy of the sun's rays to syn-
thesize proteins that serve not
alone as food, but for many
industrial uses such as manu-
facture of paints, varnishes
and plastics. Moreover, they are
able to do this much more effi-
ciently than plants grown on
land. For example, agriculture,
even under the best circum-
stances, can convert only about
three-tenths of one per cent of a
year's solar radiation into useful
organic materials ; the algae, on
the other hand, are able to do
fifteen to twenty times as well.
There is a disadvantage, how-
ever, in depending on natural
beds of algae, since a pond is able
to sustain only slightly more than
one kilogram of these plants for
each million litres of water. For
this reason, investigators in
various parts of the world have
devoted their efforts to growing
algae under controlled laboratory
conditions in an effort to in-
crease the rate of production.
The weight of protein that could
be obtained from a given area of
a) gae cultivation would be more
than sixty times the weight now
obtained from the same area if
devoted to soy beans-the most
productive agricultural c I'0 P
known.
In the United States of Ame-
rica the (Carnegie Institution is
at present supporting a number
of research projects aimed at
investigating the conditions
under which algal plants can be
grown most abundantly under
controlled conditions. The expe-
rimenters work with a particu-
lar form of one-celled algae call-
ed chlorella. Some workers
grow the plants in solutions of
chemical nutrients in tall glass
tubes. Carbon dioxide gas is
bubbled through the solution,
and the tube is exposed to sun-
light or to the light from a set of
electric lamps. As the algae
colony grows, parts are drawn
off and processed to obtain the
protein. This is then used for
feeding laboratory animals in
order to check on its usefulness
as a food. It is found that by
changing the nature of the
nutrient solution, the fraction of
the product that is in the form
of protein or of fat can be alter-
ed to a remarka. Me degree. For
food purposes a high protein
content is wanted, whereas for
the manufactured of paint or oils
a high fat content is desirable.
In order to grow a successful
and continuously productive
co ! ony of algae, it is found
essential to draw off portions of
the crop at precisely the proper
rate, so that the colony does not
strangle itself by overcrowding.
One of the foremost research
workers in this field, Dr. Pau) M.
Cook of the Stanford Research
Institute in California believes
that"it is not difficult to visua-
lize a system where constant
conditions can be maintained in
a continuous system permitting
the most efficient use of land,
sunlight and equipment. By
continuously harvesting at the
rate at which the algae increase,
and supplying the necessary raw
materials, the optimum condi-
tions may be maintained and the
maximum possible production
realized."
Chlorella is but one of a large
number of types of algae, and
further research may show that
other species are even more pro-
mising. Alga breeding tanks,
row upon row, could become a
common sight in the sunnier
areas of the world. For the pres-
ent, the important fact is that
photo-synthesis has been used
and controlled, with the promise
of new ways of using the energy
of the sun in the fight against
famine.
