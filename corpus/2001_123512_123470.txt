How many child soldiers are there?
More than 300,000 children under 18
are fighting as soldiers with government
armed forces and rebel groups in 41
countries worldwide. A d d i t i o n a l l y,
thousands of under-18s stand
ready for combat in 87
c o u n t r i e s. While most child
soldiers are 15 to 18, t h e
youngest age recorded is
seven.
A re children recruited because
t h e re is a shortage of adult
s o l d i e rs? Or is this a more
deadly form of child labour? 
The more protracted the
c o n f l i c t , the more likely
children will participate.
Children are cheap, m o r e
g u l l i b l e, and easier to
condition into fearless killing
and unthinking obedience
than adults are.We ’ve heard
stories of children who have rushed into
g u n f i r e, not realizing that the bullets
could kill them.During the border war
with Eritrea in 1999-2000, E t h i o p i a n
government forces reportedly press-
ganged [forcibly recruited] thousands of
students from marketplaces and villages,
some of whom were used in human wave
attacks across minefields.
What pushes children into combat? 
Many who have experienced or
witnessed abuse by state authorities  join
to feel secure or to protect and feed their
families, which rarely works. Ethnic and
indigenous children are often targeted,a s
in Guatemala during the civil war.They
are also trafficked across borders—
children from Rwanda and Uganda have
fought in the Democratic Republic of
C o n g o, while Pakistani children have
been used in Afghanistan.
The rebel Tamil T i g e rs group has used girls
as suicide bombers in Sri Lanka because
they are less likely to arouse suspicion. D o
you know of any similar examples of
female recruitment? 
S i g n i ficantly more boys are recruited,
but in some confli c t s, as many as a third of
the child soldiers are girls.They have been
abducted in large numbers in northern
Uganda and Sierra Leone by resistance
groups and used for combat duties and as
sexual slaves. They were also used in El
Salvador during the civil war.
What is the impact of soldiering on
c h i l d ren? Besides the obvious physical
r i s k , do they ever get over the
psychological trauma? 
The impact is dramatic. I ’ve spoken to
former child soldiers who have fla s h b a c k s
and nightmares about their combat
e x p e r i e n c e s, and get nervous simply
being approached from behind.They are
always on the alert,ready for an attack.
Children have been through years of
military experience, but don’t know how
to read and write, and have no skills that
can be used in a civilian economy.
What can be done to ensure that these
c h i l d ren aren’t written off even though
they are generally illiterate and have no
job skills? 
If they have support and are given a
second chance at education or vocational
t r a i n i n g, they can become
very successful members of
s o c i e t y. I t ’s important to
have long-term
programmes in place. I n
L i b e r i a , there was a very
rapid demobilization of
child soldiers followed by
very few rehabilitation
p r o g r a m m e s, so many
children ended up being re-
recruited or joined criminal
gangs. In other places like
Angola or Sierra Leone,
conflicts erupt again.
Ongoing programmes
have worked well in
Mozambique and in
northern Uganda. The best
ones involve the community and combine
modern psychology and child
development with traditional custom and
r i t u a l . This could involve the use of
cleansing rituals to help children feel that
they are putting their war experiences
behind them.In Mozambique and Sierra
L e o n e, children visited families of
individuals they had harmed or killed and
contributed labour or built schools as
restitution.Donors are committing more
resources to this critical area of peace-
b u i l d i n g, but a more consistent
commitment is needed if this problem is to
be effectively addressed. ■
