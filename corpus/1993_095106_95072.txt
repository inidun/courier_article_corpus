THE U NES C O COURIER - O C T O B E R 1993

BY MICHEL BATISSE
Just twenty-five years ago, in
September 1968, an important
conference organized by
Unksco was held in Paris. Its full
title, the "intergovernmental
conference of specialists to study
the ideas of modern science on the
rational use and conservation of the
resources of the biosphere", was
something of a mouthful, and for
the sake of simplicity it became
known as the "Biosphere Confer¬
ence". It was, incidentally, on this
occasion that the scientific term
"biosphere" (sphere of life), which
until then had been rarely used out¬
side the writings of the Russian geol
ogist Vernadsky and the French
philosopher Teilhard de Chardin,
began to be more widely used.
A few months before, notably in
France and the United States, stu¬
dent movements had challenged
the consumer society and heralded
the entrance of environmental
issues on to the political stage. Fully
four years before the big United
Nations Conference on the same
theme was held at Stockholm, the
biosphere conference was the first
occasion on which these issues were
considered scientifically at inter¬
governmental level and their world¬
wide dimension was recognized.

Above all, however, it showed for Urdaibai
the first time that there was a desire (Spain),
to reconcile the imperatives of the
use of natural resources with those
of their protection. In other words,
at that early date the biosphere con¬
ference launched the concept of
what is today known as "sustain¬
able development".
Under the dynamic presidency of
François Bourlière, former presi¬
dent of IUCN (World Alliance for
Nature) and the International Bio¬
logical Programme, over 300 dele¬
gates from some sixty countries and
international organizations (such
as FAO, WHO and WMO') assem¬
bled for the discussions. In the près- Isle of Rhum
ence of such great pioneers of the (UK)
environmental movement as Carlos
Chagas (Brazil), René Dubos
(United States), Viktor Kovda
(Russia), Théodore Monod (France)
and Barton Worthington (United
Kingdom), they thrashed out all the
issues, both practical and theoret¬
ical, concerning the relationships
between human activities and the
terrestrial and aquatic environ¬
ments of the planet.
PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
However, the conference did not
limit itself simply to debates. Since
the participants were official repre¬
sentatives ofgovernments, it was able
to adopt formal recommendations
26
on all the subjects dealt with. The
range and relevance of these recom¬
mendations are striking even today.
The first recommendation called
on Unesco to prepare "an interna¬
tional research programme on man
and the biosphere". This programme,
soon to be known worldwide by its
English acronym, "MAB", was natu¬
rally based on the work of the con¬
ference. It therefore adopted an
interdisciplinary approach, linking
the social sciences with the physical
and biological sciences, and it took
into account the specific problems of
developing countries. It would also
provide a practical follow-up and
give a worldwide dimension to the
International Biological Programme,
which had just entered its final stage.
Thus the biosphere conference gave
birth twenty- five years ago to the
research and training programme
that is still at the heart of Unesco's
activities relating to sustainable
development.
The Man and the Biosphere Pro¬
gramme is governed by an intergov.-
ernmental co-ordinating council
composed of representatives from
thirty countries, elected in rotation,
and from the international organi¬
zations concerned. Each country
participates in the programme
through a national committee whose
members are representatives ofoffi¬
cial bodies, universities and research
centres. During more than two
decades ofoperational activities, the
scientific content of the MAB pro¬
gramme has naturally evolved, but it
has retained its primary orientation,
namely to seek the most judicious
ways ofusing each country's natural

resources while ensuring their long-
term conservation.
A NEW IMPETUS
Whether it is concerned with
tropical forests or semi-desert
regions, mountain or coastal areas,
pastureland, islands or even urban
areas, the MAB programme seeks a
comprehensive understanding of
the processes triggered by the
impact of human activities on the
various elements of the biosphere,
and tries to minimize their harmful
effects. To a large extent, MAB's
operations in the field are concen¬
trated in some 300 "biosphere
reserves" established in over eighty
countries, where efforts are made
to combine the conservation of
biological diversity with sustain¬
able ways of using natural
resources that will benefit the local
populations. These biosphere
reserves provide the programme
with some of its most original and
important inputs.
At its most recent session, in Jan¬
uary 1993, MAB's co-ordinating
council stressed that the pro¬
gramme constituted a "pre-adapted
response" by Unesco to the recom¬
mendations set forth in Agenda 21 ,
the action plan adopted by the
United Nations Conference on Envi¬
ronment and Development held at
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1992. So, as
it celebrates its jubilee, MAB is more
necessary than ever and is being
asked to take out a fresh lease on
life, deploying its wealth of experi¬
ence and its considerable volume

of results, only some ofwhich have
so far been analysed in depth.
One thing is very clear: the
sapling that was planted by the bios¬
phere conference with its key¬
words of globality, interdiscipli-
narity, systemic and prospective
approaches, problem-oriented
research, concern for the future and
for future generations will long
continue to bear fruit.
