The time has come to negotiate a new social contract between science and society.
At its heart: the notion of science as a public good, especially in countries of the South.
Science for c i t i z e n s
V.V. Krishna*

H i r o s h i m a , C h e rn o b y l , the Bhopal chemical
plant disaster . . . the twentieth century bears
many tragic scars to remind us that the pro-
gr e s s i ve and emancipat o ry role of science and tech-
nology cannot be taken for granted.
Such terrible eve n t s , together with loss of life due
to disasters in mines, fa c t o ries and transport systems
h ave triggered public disenchantment with science
and technology. I n d i c at o rs of these anxieties are the
rise of anti-nuclear and environmental move m e n t s
in the West and the growing influence of people’s
science movements (PSMs). In India, for example,
PSMs such as the Kerala Shastra Sahitya Pa ri s h a d
(KSSP) are struggling to inculcate such scientific
values as sceptical questioning, to improve peo-
ple’s scientific literacy and to relate the results of
science and technology to the basic needs of people.
For many, this disenchantment is fuelled by
other trends.The problems are particularly acute in
the developing countri e s ,which account for less than
10 per cent of world expenditure in science and
technology research.
As part of the globalization process, the concep-
tion of science as a “market good” has spread to
these countries as a result of policies based on eco-
nomic liberalization and pri vat i z at i o n . This new
conception of science, in which market-based cri-
t e ria are applied to eva l u ate and regulate research,h a s
challenged the prevailing mode of science as a public
g o o d , and there are clear signs that research serv i n g
the ideal of “science as a public good” is stagnating or
being cut back.This is a serious problem in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries like India where over 80 per cent of research
and development is funded from public sources.
In these countries,science academics and pro-
fessional societies have a major social responsibility
to safeguard science from commercial interests
d ri ven by the logic of knowledge as pri vate propert y.
The state should sustain science as a public good
until these societies are able to absorb the shocks
generated by market forces.
Some advances in science and technology chal-
lenge widely held ethical values. The information
r e volution has impinged on personal pri va cy, and the
possibilities unleashed by the biological revo l u t i o n
interfere with the uniqueness and natural processes
of human beings.
There are also signs that some scientific and
t e c h n o l o gical innovations have a disturbing capacity
for harm . In agriculture chemical pesticides and her-
bicides bearing long-term risks to human beings are
used on a mass scale. Violent experiments are
conducted on animals to test safety devices and
chemical hazards. As the Indian scholar and envi-
ronmentalist Kamla Chow d h ry has observe d ,“ t h e
kind of technologies that the major nations of the
world have been developing in the military, agri-
culture and consumer industries have led to ‘vio-
l e n c e ’ , accompanied by loss of values such as com-
passion,helpfulness, reverence and spirituality.”
Closely associated with the violent and hege-
monistic aspects of modern science and technology
are questions of equity and sustainable consump-
t i o n .The idea of sustainable development cannot be
d i vorced from the structure of consumption pat t e rn s
in modern societies.The crucial issue here is whe-
ther developed countries are ready to cut down the
consumption levels which are draining non-rene-
wable resources.
All these issues lead to a single question: what
can be done to ensure that science and technology
meet the basic needs of society today, particularly
in low- and medium-income countri e s. I believe that
a new social contract needs to be made between
science and society through the democratic process.
There are four key ingredients in this process.
D e c i s i o n - m a k i n g. This should not be monopolized
by a scientific and political elite, often joined by pri-
vate corporate interests. Decision-making systems
should be enlarged to include representatives of a
wide range of interest gr o u p s , p e o p l e ’s science
groups and other social stakeholders.
Since the welfare of the majority and the equi-
table distribution of resources are fundamental to
d e m o c r a cy, the democrat i z ation of technical change
and the establishment of priorities in science and
technology call for new forms of part i c i p at o ry
decision-making and the creation of institutional

“safety nets”. For example, i s o l ated tribal commu-
nities in the developing world should be repre-
sented on official regulatory commissions on sub-
jects such as biodiversity and biotechnology. The
relevance of international regimes like those pro-
posed by the United Nations Conference on Env i-
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992 and the Convention on Biodive rsity should
be re-examined from the perspective of such com-
munities. In developing countries, where a major
p r o p o rtion of the research effort favo u rs the
demands and needs of privileged sections of their
societies, governments should foster participatory
decision-making systems. G ove rnments should also
increase research expenditure related to safety by
both the public and the private sector.
Social contro l . In order to control the adva n c i n g
forces of technological determinism more should
be done to educate people about the impact science
and technology will have on their live s. Science acti-
vist groups like those which have gr own up in India
h ave an important role to play in this process and
g ove rnment support should be gi ven to their activi-
t i e s.
The “neighbourhood effect”. In the deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s , there should be questioning of the process
whereby academic research is dominated by themes
t h at are prevalent in the We s t .M a ny of these themes,
though important for advances in scientific know-
l e d g e , h ave no immediate relevance to the real pro-
blems of developing countri e s. M e a n w h i l e ,only resi-
dual attention is gi ven by science laborat o ries and
u n i ve rsities to problems confronted by people in their
i m m e d i ate neighbourhood, such as malnutri t i o n ,
p ove rt y,p o l l u t i o n , and industrial hazards.To enhance
their “neighbourhood effect”, science laborat o ri e s
and unive rsities should allocate part of their research
e f f o rt to solving these problems,when necessary in col-
l a b o r ation with social scientists. R e p r e s e n t at i ves from
local neighbourhoods could well become invo l ved in
such part i c i p at o ry research in formal institutions.
D e m o c racy and the scientific spirit. There is a close
link between the values of science and democracy.
If societies are to benefit from democracy their
m e m b e rs must develop the “ s c i e n t i fic temper”, i . e .
qualities such as scepticism and doubt,respect for
facts and dat a , and the questioning of assumptions
in their approach to public issues. n
