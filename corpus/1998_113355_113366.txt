Wa n t e d : a new deal  

Higher education must meet new
demands in order to turn out well-trained
professionals instead of unemployed
graduates
We are living through a period of profound
h i s t o rical change, marked by an on-going
k n owledge revo l u t i o n . Society is chan-
ging far more quickly than the structures it has crea-
ted and the unive rsities are lagging behind these
c h a n g e s.T h e y, and the educational system in gene-
r a l , continue to teach the use of static processes,
forecasting models based on historical experience
and the memorizing of solutions to already solved
problems.
Higher education systems in both North and
South are in crisis,both quantitatively and qualita-
t i ve l y. N aturally the developing countries are the
hardest hit, both in terms of available resources and
levels of student enrolment (see box page 27).
Is the crisis due to a shortage of funds alone?
Does the fact that the countries of the North inve s t
ten times more per student than those of the South
mean that graduates from the former are ten times
better trained? Common sense says ye s. But in most
cases the answer is no. Generally speaking, univer-
sity education has failings all over the wo r l d , in some
c a s e s because it is an offspring of a wasteful society,
indifferent to the resources with which that society
provides them.
The missing link between
education and the world of work
In the United Stat e s , for example, m a ny teachers
and researchers come from developing societies
which should theoretically have gi ven them a less
sound training than that prov i d e d by the
immense academic and financial resources of the
United States system. But this is not the case:
they compete professionally and scientifically,
with no major problems. In many areas the
results of unive rsity training are comparable.
Professionals move around because they need
jobs and want to work in the best possible working
conditions.There are,for example, almost 30,000
A f rican Ph.Ds working in Europe and North A m e-
rica, and thousands of Latin American and Asian
professionals working in the United States. By the
b e ginning of the 1990s about a million professionals
had emigrated to the developed countries over the
previous three decades,and the figure has increased
considerably in the last five ye a rs.While the number
of opportunities and access to them are uneve n ,
there is little difference between North and South as
regards quality;nor is the availability of funding the
only basis for improving the system.
The problem is that post-secondary training
t o d ay is diploma-dri ve n . It is based on ri gi d
study programmes and is changing at a rat e
which takes little or no account of the speed of
k n owledge accumulat i o n .This is despite the fa c t
t h at today ’s gr a d u ate professional needs to have
f o l l owed a flexible curriculum and must be a
problem solve r , extremely adaptable to new pro-
cesses and technologi e s , generously endowe d
with creativity and firmly inclined towards life-
long learn i n g, as is clear from the studies on
skilled labour done by industrialized countri e s
and from numerous OECD studies.
A recent study of the relationship betwe e n
higher education and the labour market observe s
t h at there appears to be no connexion betwe e n
the increase in professionals’ l e vel of know l e d g e
and changes on the labour market. Although the

market undoubtedly demands basic skills and
k n ow l e d g e , it is attaching increasing import a n c e
to the emotional and psychological attitudes of
future employe e s. In Belgium and Swe d e n , t wo
of the countries with the lowest gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment levels (2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent
r e s p e c t i ve l y ) , potential employe rs consider that
although unive rsity gr a d u ates are ve ry hardwo r-
king and possess an excellent knowledge of their
s p e c i a l i z at i o n , they are ill prepared for conditions
in the real world and show few signs of creat i v i t y,
adaptability and flexibility. This view has been
expressed in other countri e s , including Germ a ny,
Ja p a n , New Zealand, N o r way and the United
K i n g d o m .
Although post-secondary education is clearly
a s s o c i ated with higher personal incomes, l owe r
u n e m p l oyment and gr e ater opportunities to
climb the social ladder, u n e m p l oyment rates for
people with higher education qualificat i o n s
continue to be high in both North and South.
G r a d u ate unemployment in Europe, f o r
e x a m p l e , va ries between 1.4 per cent and 16.6
per cent depending on the country.W h at ’s more,
m a ny gr a d u ates are working in jobs outside their
field of training.The increase in gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment in the developing countries is largely
due to the drastic fall in demand from the major
e m p l oyer of gr a d u ates–the state–as a result of
i n t e rn ational competition and new political and
economic approaches.The pri vate sector is in no
position to absorb the supply of surplus gr a-
d u at e s. World Bank studies carried out in A s i a ,
the Middle East, N o rth A f rica and certain Lat i n
A m e rican countries show that gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment is increasing: in Egypt it rose in barely
five ye a rs from 9.6 per cent to 16 per cent; i n
Venezuela it went from 4 per cent to 10.3 per
cent between 1981 and 1990. The picture is
similar in many of the former countries of the
communist bloc as a result of rapid pri vat i z at i o n .
All the same, higher education cannot be held
wholly responsible for gr a d u ate unemployment nor
for the corr e l ation that should exist between training,
The North-South g a p
In the last decade alone, the gap in
higher education enrolment rates has
widened by 6.7% in favour of the most
developed countries. A f r i c a , the region
with the highest annual increase in uni-
versity student numbers (7.5%), has a very
low enrolment rate (2.5%), while North
A m e r i c a , which has the lowest growth in
student numbers (1.6%) has the highest
enrolment rate (77.3%).
Perhaps the most marked disparities are
in student costs. A student in the North
costs far less in relation to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) than a student in the South.
In absolute terms, h o w e v e r, the latter costs
only $651, as opposed to $6,520 for the
f o r m e r.
On average, an investment by a poor
country of $651 in higher education
requires twice as big a sacrifice as an
investment of $6,520 by a rich country. I n
other words, the poorer the country, t h e
higher the relative cost per student and
the greater the national budgetary effort.

study programmes and
demand for labour. It is often
said that higher education is
failing to provide training in
the activities required by the
m a r k e t , but the market is often
incapable of adequately anti-
c i p ating the type of professio-
nals it is going to need.
A survey conducted in
F l o rida (USA) among mul-
t i n ationals in the high-tech
and services sectors revealed companies that
were unable to identify the professional qualities
t h at would be required within ten ye a rs and, i n
m a ny cases, within five ye a rs. This is not surp ri-
s i n g, in view of the spectacular rise of the Inter-
net between 1994 and 1998 which caught many
h a r d ware and software firms unawa r e s. It is in
i n f o rm ation technology that redundancies and
high unemployment levels are occurri n g, b e c a u s e
systems are constantly changing and because of
s t r at e gic mergers between the major companies.
Another example of the difficulty of making
reliable predictions concerns those made by the
European Community and the US Gove rn m e n t
regarding the types of jobs that would be needed at
the beginning of the new century.These predictions
were inaccurat e : w h at had been forecast to occur
after 2001 actually came about in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
It can be said,h owe ve r ,t h at professional training
over the coming ye a rs will focus on areas such as
high-tech electronics, i n f o rm ation technology,a q u a-
c u l t u r e ,a gr o - e n e r g y, biotechnology and energy phy-
s i c s. Jobs in inform ation and communication systems
will require new qualific ations which will have to
be continually updat e d .The service sector will expe-
rience spectacular gr owth in the field of leisure and
r e c r e ation because of the reduction in working hours.
New professions in the human sciences such as
“ l u d i c a d o l o g y ” , i n c o rp o r ating psychology, p e d a-
g o g y, i n f o rm ation science and the technology of
e d u c at i o n , p l ay and creativity progr a m m e s , w i l l
replace the old single-discipline approach.
In short , the gr e at occupational change looming
ahead will call for increased interdisciplinari t y, r e v i-
t a l i z ation of the disciplines related to ethics and aes-
thetics and sweeping changes in the attitudes of tea-
c h e rs and students: for the professional of the future,
education will be a lifelong process,and education
and work will go hand in hand.
The gr e at challenge will thus be to create a stable
relationship between higher education and society


through strat e gic alliances with the production sys-
tem designed to promote part i c i p ation by all sectors
of the economy in the unive rs i t y ’s basic and applied
research programmes and by production-sector spe-
cialists in university teaching.
The problems of the unive rsity are also those
of society, and so are the responsibilities. T h i s
raises the question of the unive rs i t y ’s specific cul-
t u r e , especially the teacher-student relat i o n s h i p.
Planning is currently based above all on the tea-
ching staff, which is more corp o r atist than aca-
d e m i c. P hysical spaces, s a l a ry scales, c u rri c u l a ,
s t ructures and timetables are more closely geared
to the needs of the teacher than of teaching.T h i s
is the case all over the wo r l d .
More serious still, this teacher-centred culture is
giving way to one that is even more dangerous for the
s u rv i val of unive rsity educat i o n : an administrat i o n -
centred culture.This would mean an education sys-
tem dominated by bu r e a u c r ats and the kind of mana-
gement structures which would place an institution
whose function is to produce and disseminate know-
ledge on the same footing as a detergent factory or
a multinational travel agency.
But no strategy for change can work unless
higher education adapts to the challenge of the
k n owledge explosion. It is vital that cours e
content should be geared to what learn e rs “ m u s t
k n ow ” and not to what teachers “ k n ow ” o r
“think they know ” .This will force teachers into a
p e rmanent renewal of theori e s , techniques and
p r o c e s s e s , keeping up with knowledge produced
both inside and outside the unive rs i t y. H i g h e r
e d u c ation is evolving towards a model in which
l e c t u r e rs and students will be permanent lear-
n e rs and where curricula will be drawn up on
the basis of innovat i o n , fresh knowledge and the
l atest teaching and learning technologi e s. A b ove
all the unive rsity must teach people to think, t o
use common sense and to gi ve free rein to the
c r e at i ve imagi n at i o n . ■
