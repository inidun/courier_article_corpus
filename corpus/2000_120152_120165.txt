A Maori warrior claims 
new territory
◗ Kerry Buchanan
Dean Hapeta launched New Zealand’s political hip-hop scene by linking the force of Maori
c u l t u re with the struggle of black nationalism to fuel consciousness and contro v e rs y
“Ni g g e r ! ” The biker’s insult blindsided the
e i g h t - year-old boy, s h at t e ring his vision of
both Maori and pakeha (white) society in
A o t e a r o a , the ori ginal name of New Zealand. T h e
verbal attack sharpened the boy ’s awareness of his
s o c i e t y ’s colour lines.A f t e r wa r d s , he couldn’t stand the
sight of his fellow Maori cast as the peaceful but sub-
o r d i n ate nat i ve . Nor could he look up to indigenous
gangs in his working-class neighbourhood of Upper
H u t t ,outside the capital We l l i n g t o n .Tu rning to white
s o c i e t y, he felt oppression. So the boy began to look
i n wa r d , to imagine a “new breed”—proud of his
M a o ri past and committed to a radical break with the
l e g a cy of colonial dominat i o n .
To d ay, at the age of 34, Hapeta will refer to him-
self as “one bad nigger” in reference to his hardcore
politics as a rapper. Here lies Hapeta’s strength and,
for some,his we a k n e s s : the ability to we ave Maori cul-
t u r e , language and political demands—from land and
fishing rights to economic equality—within the style
and context of black A m e rican hip-hop.Indeed Hapeta
and his group Upper Hutt Posse (UHP) have influ-
enced a generation of hip-hop bands and fans across
the country. Before these “ wa rri o rs ” s t o rmed the
s t a g e ,M a o ri music was generally marginalised like an
exotic trinket of the past used in the “ ri t u a l ”of enter-
taining touri s t s. By rapping in their language and
i n c o rp o r ating the sounds, values and history of their
p e o p l e ,Hapeta and like-minded artists shatter stereo-
types of what it means to be Maori .

H a p e t a ’s political consciousness did not flow
from the “cultural awa k e n i n g ” of the 1970s when the
M a o ri middle-class rediscovered its roots.He followe d
the learning curve of the streets, his wh a k a p a p a ( “ t h e
place where one belongs”).Tuned into the liberat i o n
music of Bob Marley, Ja m a i c a ’s legendary reggae
m u s i c i a n , the songs of resistance rang true in his
d i s a d vantaged neighbourhood, where police con-
f r o n t ations were a rite of passage. By va l o u rising the
h i s t o ry of former slaves and colonised peoples, t h e
music enabled Hapeta to discover “black outern a-
t i o n a l i t y ”or the collective struggles of the oppressed.
The impact of Malcom X
In fa c t ,H a p e t a ’s group UHP began in 1985 by
p l aying reggae inspired by the political message of Mar-
l e y, considered a ve ritable saint. But then a new set of
prophets landed in A o t e a r o a : U. S .r a p p e rs like A f ri k a
B a m b a ataa and Grandmaster Flash. B r e a k d a n c i n g
and rapping with crews in the street, Hapeta began
mixing a homegr own message with two major ingr e-
d i e n t s :e x p e rience and inspirat i o n .Landing a job at the
Justice Depart m e n t , he scoured the country to hear
M a o ri land gri e va n c e s.The second element flowe d
from ove rseas via The A u t o b i ogra p hy of Malcom X.
“The book knocked me out,”he say s.“It was gr e at
i n s p i r ation … that pride in the self and the ability to
do something about it.”The life of the black nat i o n-
alist—a cultural hero for his radical defence of racial
p ride in the 1950s and 60s—led Hapeta to see him-
self as a leader with hip-hop as a movement against
racism and a political plat f o rm for Maori interests.
I r o n i c a l l y, Hapeta was soon approached by the son
of Elijah Muhammad, the man who banished
Malcom X1 from the Nation of Islam, an influ e n t i a l
and controve rsial black militant gr o u p. To u ri n g
A o t e a r o a , Rasul Muhammad invited Hapeta and
his posse to perform in Detroit and meet the Nat i o n ’s
l e a d e r , Minister Louis Fa rr a k h a n , whose antisemitic
remarks and infla m m at o ry views on racial separat i o n
h ave sparked heated debat e .
In many way s , the trip reflects Hapeta’s ongoing
dialogue between Maori culture and A f rican A m e r-
ican influ e n c e s. At firs t , the balance was tipped
overseas. But with time Hapeta struck an equilib-
rium. For example, he recalls that “meeting Far-
rakhan was like going to the mountain-top.”T h e r e
was also the thrill of performing in Detroit and
New York and even being interv i e wed inside
H a r l e m ’s Apollo T h e at r e , where nearly all the gr e at
A f rican A m e rican musicians have playe d . B l a c k
audiences were apparently amazed by the fluency
and force with which Upper Hutt drew links
between Malcom X and Maori leaders like Hone
H e k e . Praise in the homeland of hip-hop helped to
legitimize Hapeta’s own sense of authenticity.
But back in A o t e a r o a , the fie ry brand of Maori
n ationalism has fuelled consciousness and contro-
ve rs y. In part i c u l a r ,his no-compromise stance on land
rights rattles more conciliat o ry activists and,at times,
Polynesian groups ori ginally from the Pa c i fic Islands
of Samoa, Nuie and To n g a . For example, at a 1990
c o n c e rt , Polynesian fans told Hapeta “to go home”
after he announced that Aotearoa was the land of the
M a o ri .The same ye a r , Hapeta successfully sued for
d e fa m ation the newspaper A u ckland Star over claims
t h at Upper Hutt Posse had barred two p a k e h a yo u t h s
from a concert .I r o n i c a l l y, the political talks pepper-
ing Hapeta’s shows are generally well accepted by
p a k e h a a u d i e n c e s.
Inner peace
Today, Hapeta is working as a solo artist under
the name Te Kupu (the word) instead of the form e r
D Wo r d . Two ve rsions of his latest album Ko Te
M atakahi Ku p u (or The Words that Pe n e t r ate) we r e
released in January:one entirely in Maori and the
other in English.These changes reflect Hapeta’s per-
sonal evo l u t i o n . Before the evils of society appeared
to dominate his work.Now, Hapeta seems to have
found an inner peace in his reliance on his culture.
Within the Maori community, he is respected as a
political leader for his dedication to Te Rao (M a o ri
language) and culture. But the wa rrior is still alive ,
staking claims in new terri t o ry : mainstream society.
“Promote it [Te Rao],push it into the mainstream.
Use its concepts of caring, social concern as a way
of changing at t i t u d e s ,” s ays Hapeta, who is pushing
for more than just space for his albums in record
shops and on radio stat i o n s. His words are intended
to penetrate mainstream society.
Hapeta’s horizons widen as he travels interna-
tionally to check out the local political plat f o rms of
other “conscious rappers ” in the UK, for example.
“I’m learning from all struggles,getting out of my
skin and [coming] back to share, as an ambassador
for the Maori people.” In many ways, this mission
r e flects the advice of the gr e at Maori leader, Sir A p i-
rana Ngata. In 1897, he wrote of the need to har-
monize one’s conflicting ideas while daring “ t o
wander in moments of the greatest exaltation and
wildest imaginings.” ■

on February 21, 1965 while
addressing his followers in

of the Nation of Islam were
convicted of the crime.
