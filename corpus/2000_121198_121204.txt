Buoyed by mounting criticism of public education,
the business world is investing in this new field with 
a managerial mindset and enterprising spirit
1 . C O R P O R ATE A M B I T I O N S
As the winds of liberalization blow
onwards, a new vocabulary is running
through education  plucked straight
from the corporate universe.P r i n c i p a l s
step into the shoes of managers, p a r e n t s
become choosey customers while schools compete
and innovate, striving to offer an efficient,quality
service, which at the end of the day yields a  profit
and turns out graduates fit for the job market.
Tacitly supported by governments,the movement
is gaining legitimacy worldwide, fuelled by the grass-
roots and corporate interests,both of which have taken
aim at public education’s tarnished report card.
In the mid-1990s, the European Round
Table of Industrialists,which gathers
prominent CEOs, pointed its
finger at “an ever- w i d e n i n g
gap between the education
that people need for
t o d a y ’s complex world
and the education
they receive.” Th e
Merrill Lynch bro-
kerage fir m
laments that
“ t w e l f t h - g r a d e r s
in the U. S. in the
most recent inter-
national compari-
sons finished dead
last and next to last
in math and science
r e s p e c t i v e l y.”P a r t i c i-
pants at the Wo r l d
Education Forum in
Dakar in April 2000
deemed it “unacceptable that
more than 113 million children
have no access to primary education
… and that the quality of learning and
the acquisition of human values and skills fall
far short of the … needs of societies.”
As Motoyo Kamiya from the OECD’s Centre
for Education Research and Innovation notes, e d u-
c a t i o n ,which typically represents 25 to 30 percent of
public spending,“is becoming more politicized and
controversial both at the national level and locally,
because of decentralization.”Accounting for roughly
20 percent of total education spending, the private
sector has always provided services, textbooks or
schooling via missions, NGOs or other channels.
But now, following the dismantling of state mono-
p o l i e s,the whole public sector is deemed ripe for libe-
r a l i z a t i o n .For advocates of  this process, h e a l t h c a r e,
along with education—a market worth two trillion
dollars—are the last bastions to be overrun.
Critics attack public education’s ineffic i e n cy and
b u r e a u c r a t i c, often overly-centralized, outmoded 
s t r u c t u r e s. Pointing to the principles that have made
many a business prosper, they argue that schools need
market incentives and competitive pressures to
improve and innovate, and that these can be created
through various forms of  privatization.As the Euro-
pean Round Table of Industrialists puts it,“the whole
situation could be turned around if school education
underwent the same transformation as the workplace.”
Struck by funding cuts,higher education is at the
vanguard of more commercial reforms,from weaving
closer ties with industry to tapping the online learning
m a r k e t .But despite the latter’s bullish forecasts, t h e
burgeoning of the private sector cannot be pinned to
technology alone. As Kamiya notes, a broad public
sector reform movement is underway, in which
market-oriented approaches are the backdrop. I n
the U. K .and the U. S. , the publication of league tables,
test scores and rankings,accompanied by hefty media
p u b l i c i t y, is “putting schools under pressure to attract
students and hence funding.” In many countries,
rules are being loosened up over the right to set up
s c h o o l s, while the running of public schools is being
entrusted to private outfit s.
Answering the pressure from below
Taking this process one step further, schools are
becoming business enterprises in their own right. I n
western A f r i c a , retired teachers are opening their
o w n , while elsewhere in the developing world full-
fledged private school chains are attracting growing
n u m b e r s. Under pressure to cut spending, g o v e r n-
ments are loosening regulations and providing incen-
tives to the private sector. In Côte d’Ivoire, 60 per-
cent of secondary schools are now in private hands.
The trend seems set to stay.“ Wh a t ’s really pushing
the for- p r o fit sector is parental demand for better
and different education,”says the World Bank’s Harry
P a t r i n o s.“ N o w,in relatively poor countries,people are
demanding English, t e c h n o l o g y.They know it’s out
there and that some countries are benefiting greatly
from it. They see that the private sector is able to
gear its product to those demands.” ■
