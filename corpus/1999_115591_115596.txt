Indigenous peoples and env i r o n m e n t a l
groups have often been at loggerheads.
But in A u s t r a l i a , one group of A b o ri-
gines has teamed up with env i r o n m e n t a l i s t s
in a dispute over a uranium mine.
In 1996 the Australian gove rnment gave
p e rmission for the mining company Energy
Resources of Australia (ERA) to begi n
work at the Jabiluka mining site, with ura-
nium reserves estimated to be worth more
than $8 billion.
The decision touched off a national and
i n t e rn ational controve rsy over Ja b i l u k a ,
which lies in the middle of the Kakadu
N ational Pa r k , listed as a World Heri t a g e
Site by UNESCO.
In  a report last December, UN E S C O c a l-
led on the Australian government to put a
stop to the mining project, saying Jabiluka
t h r e atened the environment of Kakadu and
the cultural heritage of the A b o ri gi n e s. A
UN E S C O committee will decide this July
whether to put Kakadu—habitat for hun-

dreds of species of wildlife and Australia’s
oldest sites of human occupation dating as
far back as 60,000 years ago—on its list of
World Heritage Sites in Danger.
The Australian gove rnment says the
UN E S C O r e p o rt contains err o rs of fa c t ,l aw,
science and logi c. ERA says the report ’s
recommendations do not make “environ-
mental,social or legal sense.”
Lobbying and demonstrations by a coa-
lition of 3,500 environmentalists and the
M i rrar A b o ri gi n e s , the traditional ow n e rs of
the site, was  a contri buting factor in
prompting UN E S C O to inve s t i g ate the
impact of mining on them and their envi-
ronment.
Kakadu Aborigines remain split on the
mining issue. There are only 28 Mirr a r
among the 500 A b o ri gines at Kakadu.
Many Aborigines hope for Jabiluka’s com-
mencement on economic grounds.
At present the Jabiluka project is conti-
nuing. n
