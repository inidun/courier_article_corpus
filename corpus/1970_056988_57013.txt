TUNIS-A JEWEL
OF ISLAM
T
VWENTY- EIGHT centuries
of civilization standing layer upon layer
and covering an area of barely
60 square miles: a site Carthage ; a
city Tunis.
Carthage is a name that has fasci¬
nated the great of literature from Vir¬
gil to Flaubert, and which can be con¬
jured up by a few brief images: the
genius of Hannibal with his Numidians
from northern Africa, Jiis Gauls and his
elephants, his "immortal" yet short¬
lived victories. Then the Romans in
Africa; the aging Cato "Delenda est
Carthago" (Carthage must be destroy¬
ed). In 146 B.C. it was well and truly
destroyed, its remains razed to the
ground and its site declared accursed.
But economic necessity, it seems, is
more powerful than a conqueror's cur¬
ses. The Roman colony of Carthago,
founded on the ancient site in 44 B.C.,
took less than a century to become a
large and powerful city of 300,000 in¬
habitants, dealing, like its predecessor,
in oil, wine and purple and importing
Greek statuary.
The new Carthage was built with the
Roman town-planner's geometric pat¬
tern of streets, with aqueducts and
forum, apartment buildings and villas,
and complete with circus, theatre,
odeon, temples and baths the famous
Antonine Baths which were the most
luxurious in the world outside Rome.
This was truly a city to dream of for
the Italian merchants and their Punic
counterparts, for the orators and scho¬
lars, the bishops and generals of the
Roman colony and later for the Van¬
dal chieftains with their own retinues
of orators and bishops; and later still
for the Byzantine admirals.

TUNIS (Continued)
Birth of a capital
at the Mosque of the Olive Tree
Carthage was a city dreamed over,
renewed and remodelled during the
course of seven centuries. When the
city was captured by Hassan Ibn
Noman in 698 A.D., still arrogant and
still confident in its power, Pompeii by
then had slept so long in its bed of
lava that it had been forgotten.
Carthage, less fortunate than Pom¬
peii, had no volcano to wrap it in a
winding-sheet to await the century of
enlightenment and the scholars and
students of antiquity. Like London,
Treves, Lyon, Nîmes, like Rome it¬
self, it became little more than a
quarry. But the quarrymen who fil¬
ched its stones, unlike those who
demolished the monuments of these
European cities, built nothing upon the
sites of its abandoned temples.
Hassan and his successors used its
stones to build elsewhere as far away
as Kairouan. Not just for one year,
nor even ten, but throughout thirteen
centuries they took pillars and capitals
for the mosques, palaces and souks,
statues to feed the lime-kilns, sarco¬
phagi to pave the streets. None of
this was done maliciously life must
go on, and this is how each wave of
civilization builds upon its predeces¬
sors. However, some monuments
were still standing, at times providing
shelter to enemy forces. In 1270, fol¬
lowing the crusade led by Saint Louis,
the sultan, El Mostaneir, gave the order
to destroy the last remains.

ET the traveller who wand¬
ers along a coast not yet seriously
disfigured, climbs the partly-defaced
hills and threads his way between the
villas and their tiny gardens still
comes face to face with the old
Carthage. For here and there a few
columns still point to the skies, marble
and mosaics peep out from the grass,
and overthrown buildings, whose buri¬
ed walls lie flush to the ground, seem
to thrust upwards, piercing through
sand and rubble, a bleak reminder of
the once orderly plan of the ancient
city.
The hill of Byrsa, on which stood the
fortress-sanctuary, last refuge of the
Punic gods and their defenders, has
never been explored. The bare spa¬
ces, still awaiting excavation, cover
more than 370 hectares (900 acres).
Like a newly deciphered language,
ancient Carthage could be re-discover¬
ed, restored to life, given new mean¬
ing and depth. But first, those who
love Carthage and who are responsible
for the city will need the means and
determination to resist the invasion of
the villa constructors before it is too
late, before the population squeeze and
housing boom have covered every¬
thing with a thick coat of plaster.
They will need the help of administra¬
tive and legal measures no less than
financial resources. But once they have
the legal powers, there is little doubt
that the funds they need will be forth¬
coming.
It may seem strange that an article
dealing with cultural rescue should be
concerned with both an ancient, anni¬
hilated city and a strongly flourishing,
exuberant capital. Carthage finally
perished in giving birth to Tunis, but
the heart of Tunis is threatened by a
superabundance of life. Only cities
whom history has passed by escape
this paradoxical fate. But Tunis sim¬
mers with history in the making. The
administrative, industrial, commercial
and tourist centre of a country of five
million inhabitants, Tunis js
ing a period of great expansion and,
as we say of teenagers, is suffering
from growing pains.
I
IN 1925, Tunis had a popu¬
lation of 186,000in 1966, 470,000.
But for some years now the directors
of the urban development plan have
been aware that it would be pointless
to consider the city alone without plan¬
ning for the surrounding communities
of the residential suburb near the sea.
Four years ago this "Greater Tunis"
had a population of nearly 800,000 and
by the end of the century it is esti¬
mated that it will have risen to two
million.
Yet these figures fail to tell the
whole story. Although they indicate
a rate of growth that to some must
appear colossal, they reveal nothing of
the fundamental aspects of this urban
growth. Yet even a brief outline of
the history of the city provides a
glimpse of these aspects. It gives us
an idea of the pressures and impera¬
tives, the interplay of poverty and
development, the dangers of routine
solutions and the horizons that can be
opened up by clear-sighted decisions.
At the foot of a small hillock, on a
narrow strip of land between a marsh
and the big lake which separates it
from the sea, lay a small village as old
as time. It was this country market¬
place and caravan crossroads that Has¬
san and his successors chose first as
the setting for the Djama Zitouna, or
mosque of the olive-tree, and then as
the site of a town.
From this great house of prayer a
river of brick and stone spread out
to the north, the south, the west and
the south-west, spawning market
streets, great men's houses, hostel-
ries, cisterns, wells, warehouses, work¬
shops, schools, sepulchres, gardens.
Two suburbs, protected by ramparts
linked to the fortress that soon came
to overshadow the great mosque,
offered a welcome to caravans and
farmers.
The domes and square minarets
(later to be replaced by fine octago¬
nal towers) of other mosques reared
their heads to the sky. The bright
terraces of the closely-huddled hou¬
ses looked out to sea or over the
sacred hills, shielding the patios of
these vast, secretive dwellings which,
from century to century, retained the
inward-looking Roman style as adapted
by Moslem Egypt.
The history of Tunis, as one disco¬
vers with relief, is less a saga of gen¬
erals, of messianic dictators, of sheiks,
deys and beys, than a fairy tale for
architects. It is the history of the slow
growth of a hive, the patient multipli¬
cation of honeycomb cells, inter¬
mingled and interdependent like the
cells of a living organism. There were,
of course, enough party rivalries, sie¬
ges, brawls and free-for-alls to satisfy
connoisseurs of old style drama, if
any still exist. But the impression
remains that the real history of Tunis,
of the Medina of Tunis, wisely placed
in the hands of the builders and confin¬
ed to the 760 acres within its walls,
unfolded over eleven hundred years
quite apart from these colourful but
trivial occurrences.
It is true that this capital of theolo¬
gians, jurists, craftsmen and mer¬
chants, peaceful by inclination and by
repute, did not entirely escape the
hand of violence. In about 1050 came
the invasion of the Beni Hilal Bedouins,
let loose, according to the historian Ibn
Khaldoun, like a swarm of voracious

PLEASURES
OF THE CHASE
Hunting is a recurring theme in
Carthaginian mosaics of the Roman
period. In the 2nd century A.D.,
influenced by emperor Hadrian's passion
for hunting wild beasts, the sport
became the favourite pastime of the
Roman aristocracy. Above right,
fragment of a hunting scene from a
5th century Carthaginian mosaic. Below
right, a perfectly preserved 6th century
mosaic baptismal font decorated with
hunting scenes. Dedicated to Saint
Cyprian, one of the fathers of the
Christian church who lived in the
3rd century, it indicates that hunting
had been taken up by the Christians
of Carthage.

TUNIS (Continued)
The Medina: 11 centuries
of architectural splendour
locusts by the Caliph of Egypt. And
three centuries later came the occupa¬
tion by the Merinids, another nomadic
tribe, this time from Algeria.
Then, in 1534, followed Khairad-Din
Barbarossa's Turkish soldiers, syste¬
matic pillagers like Charles V's Spa¬
nish soldiery a year later. The end
of the 17th and the beginning of the
18th centuries saw further Algerian
incursions, but these were less serious
and more quickly forgotten.
All in all there was little destruction,
no vengeful sacking, sacrilegious
demolition or fanatical incendiarism.
Warfare, generally the repercussion of
the wars of other nations, periodically
halted, for brief periods, the city's
growth and embellishment. After these
intervals, masons, carpenters, sculp¬
tors,- tilers, plasterers and glass-
blowers resumed their toil.
Almost all their works are there, and
in this town, still shut in by its invisible
walls (the vanished ramparts still leave
their imprint on the boulevards), the
shortest walk becomes an endless pil¬
grimage through street and alley, souk
and cul-de-sac, leading not only to
palaces and places of worship (or even
to mere facades and arches or the
pure volumes of the skyline), but also
to the very vision of their builders who
seem close at hand and ready to wel¬
come the visitor.
Yet if, today, it were suddenly to be
announced that bulldozers were ready
to raze these wonders to the ground,
it would surprise but few; too many
examples can be quoted of European
FLORAL GEOMETRY
Complicated floral decorations (left) are
a motif typical of Tunisian faience and
are to be seen on many of the walls
of Tunis's Dar Hussein palace, built
in the 19th century. Today the palace
houses the National Institute of
Archaeology and the Arts, and the
Arab-Islam Museum. For long merely
a suburb of Carthage, ancient Tunis
became the capital after the Arab
conquest in the 7th century AD. The
old quarter contains a multitude of art
and architectural treasures. From
Babylon the art of faience spread to
Persia and was taken up by the Arabs
who carried it to North Africa and the
West. To this day it provides a vehicle
for some of the most delicate
decorative work in Arab-Islamic art.

cities, once the cradles of art, that are
being openly destroyed at this very
moment by hard-headed building pro¬
moters, deaf to the helpless cry of
"culture", to be replaced by their me¬
diocre modernism.
Indeed, some enthusiasts for Public
Works have already put forward plans
for the disembowelling of Tunis, point¬
ing to the traffic problem, which this
kind of surgery would anyway do little
to solve. The good sense of the
local authorities has restrained them.
However, words such as "pilgrimage",
"visitor", "enclosed city", deliber¬
ately used above, hint at another kind
of danger. Is the Medina of Tunis
then no longer a town like any other?
Is it reserved for the curiosity seek¬
er? What has happened?
In about 1860, the Christian European
merchants, whose "fondouks" (ware¬
houses) had crowded in upon each
other over two centuries in the lower
part of the town near the sea gate,
also called the Porte de France, moved
out and installed their warehouses and
dwellings outside the town walls. They
settled themselves in an agreeable
disorder that was harmless enough,
yet which heralded the great trans¬
formation of Tunis and, it has been
said in moments of pessimism, the end
of eleven centuries of peaceful history.
Twenty years later came the French
Protectorate. But it was not destruc-

MAGIC SYMBOLS
THAT ENDURE
,'/''
The mother goddess Tanit finally displaced Ba'al
Hammon as undisputed head of the Carthaginian
pantheon towards the middle of the 4th century
B.C. On stelae erected in sanctuaries dedi¬
cated to her, two of the signs used to symbo¬
lize the divine presence are the open hand with
outward facing palm (top of photo left), and,
(centre photo) the "sign of the bottle" sur¬
mounted by a crescent with tips turned downwards
(see also page 33). The modern Tunisian orna¬
mental clasp (below) incorporates both the cres¬
cent and the open hand and signifies good luck.
Today in much of the Mediterranean world this
motif is known as "the hand of Fatima" and
demonstrates how ancient magical symbols per¬
sist although their religious significance may have
long been forgotten.

tive. On the contrary, the French
were builders and modernistic build¬
ers. Starting with the scattered ware¬
houses beside the Porte, the colonists,
at no great cost but with a certain
pride, built a colonial town conceived
in grandiose style.
Facing away from the old Tunis,
henceforward no more than an Arab
quarter, the straight avenues, the right-
angled streets, the plain chequer-board
of the military camp of the new town
spread out beside the lake. Year by
year new administrative buildings,
banks, houses, shops, apartment
houses, cafés, hotels, theatres and
cinemas were added.
In 1970, the lake is still not entirely
surrounded and the avenues stretch
out to north and south, a skyscraper
has sprung up, new centres are
appearing, smoke rises from a few fac¬
tories and a multi-storey hotel domi¬
nates a cluster of luxurious villas.
The hotel also overlooks, on the
other side, a newly built and regret¬
table shanty-town, but this subtracts
nothing from the charm of Tunis, a
modern "European" city that no one
would wish to find fault with. In fact,
it has a great deal of charm, like 19th
century Milan or the suburbs of Tou¬
louse.
But in thus displacing the administra¬
tive and business centre, in changing
radically the criteria of modern urban
life, in giving a new orientation to its
evolution, the heart of the town has
been unwittingly drained of life.
T
HE Medina held out for
some time. Retaining its intellectual
prestige it remains, indeed, the reli¬
gious centre. But most of its leading
citizens, the descendants of great
families, have left their palaces which
brought life to whole sections of the
town, and have rented them to the
impoverished migrants who come from
the country districts, in an unending
stream, lured by the mirage of the
capital.
Far away in their modern apartments
they have no inclination to bother
themselves with the dirt of the slums
that have developed under their ances¬
tral roofs. And no doubt they have
no time to worry about this constant

influx or about the occasional exploi¬
tation of these landless peasants or
the crowds of unemployed.
Luckily there are others who are
concerned about this trend, who rea¬
lize that the Medina of Tunis is one
of the finest in North Africa which
means one of the finest in the world
and that it provides an example of an
astounding continuity of architectural
development, the unsullied fruit of
eleven hundred years of creation.
Above all, they know that with its
suburbs, despite the defection of some
wealthier citizens, despite abuses and
indifference, it retains a highly original
life, a captivating mixture of tradition
and adaptation to the present age.
Knowing all this, these Tunisians
who are now responsible for their
town have refused to accept the role
of placid defenders of "old stones",
content to restore a few monuments
here and there and to turn a district
or two into museums and empty shells.
This would be a cheap way to appease
their consciences.
They understand clearly that they
will have to take care of the whole
Medina in its relationship to the capi-

factor in Tunisian life; some 16,000 to 20,000 craftsmen and
artisans keep alive the old skills and traditions which have
been handed down for generations.
tal as a whole: Tunis and its suburbs.
The dangers which beset the historic
heritage and which are sapping it from
within arise from social and economic,
from human causes which are just the
ones that any urban development pro¬
gramme worthy of the name should
tackle.
If these causes are forgotten, the
Medina, behind its austere facades, will
house nothing but shanties, famous
schools debased, mausoleums trans¬
formed into cattle-sheds, while at the
same time Carthage will be covered
with motorways, with villas for middle-
class executives, with tourist "palaces"
and supermarkets. This would, with¬
out doubt, be the easy solution.
It is a solution that must be rejected.
And perhaps such crimes will never
be committed. In 1969, prompted by
the Association for the Protection of
the Medina and the National Institute
of Archaeology and the Arts, the Tuni¬
sian government launched a pilot pro¬
ject for the safeguarding and restora¬
tion of the country's heritage of monu¬
ments in the Tunis-Carthage region as
part of its plans for economic develop¬
ment, and asked for help from Unesco
under the United Nations Development
Programme. Final approval of the
scheme by the UNDP is expected in
January 1971.
The resources in men and materials
to be deployed would be derisory if
the intention were to excavate the site
of Carthage and to put its ruins on
display in a fitting manner, or to buy
up the palaces in danger in the Medina
and restore their woodwork, marble
and stucco facings.
However, the immediate objective is
less spectacular yet no less ambitious.
A team made up of international
experts and representatives of UNDP
and Unesco, will first study and ana¬
lyse the problems of Tunis and Car¬
thage in economic as much as in
archaeological terms and propose the
best solutions and an order of priority
for the work of restoration.
Under the auspices of an inter-minis¬
terial committee, the team has a pri¬
ority task to provide the Tunisian
authorities with a scientifically based
plan for coherent and co-ordinated
urban development of the region. It is
only within this context that one can
hope, and there is already ground for
hope, that generous international aid
will be forthcoming for the safe¬
guarding and restoration of the mo¬
numents and sites.
A few months ago, a leading town-
planning specialist wrote in a French
newspaper: "Paris is in danger. She
seems to be following a path of self
destruction, destroying those very
facets that give her her character and
value. No one, it seems, is aware of
the danger and nothing is yet being
done to halt the process."
Other newspapers in Europe and
elsewhere could equally bewail the lot
of many other cities. It would indeed
be a great achievement if Tunis, the
capital of a country in which the annual
revenue does not exceed 100 dollars
per head, should give the lead that
reason demands; should give the lead
because its leaders have become
aware in time of the destructive
process of haphazard urban develop¬
ment and because its lovers of history
and archaeology have quickly and
clearly grasped the fact that in
order to safeguard stones one must
first see to the needs of men and
women.
