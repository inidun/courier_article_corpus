The collapse of the two-bloc world system
brought to an end a long period of immobility.
However uneasy and unpredictable the
current situation may be, it is more open to
individual human effort, especially on the part of
remarkable personalities who, through their
commitment to peace, have given new
momentum to situations that seemed
to be at a standstill. On the following pages are
thumbnail sketches of some of these
peacemakers who have been awarded
Unesco's Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize.
