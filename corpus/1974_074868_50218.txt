HE use of geothermal
energy for large-scale heating of
houses was pioneered in Iceland, which
is natural since it has a climate
requiring the heating of houses for
330 to 340 days a year. No fossil
fuel sources are available except
limited reserves of peat and lignite.
But there are a multitude of hot springs
and a number of major geothermal
steam fields.
The first attempts at heating single
farmhouses were made in the begin¬
ning of the 20th century. Around 1925
hot spring water was used In the first
hothouses for vegetables.
A major step forward was made
when the first boreholes for hot water

were drilled in the vicinity of Reykjavik,
in 1928, yielding 14 litres per second
of 87 °C. hot water. A 3 km. long
pipeline to the city was constructed,
feeding a pilot district heating scheme
comprising 70 houses, an enclosed
swimming pool, an open-air swimming
pool and a school.
This venture was quite successful,
and as a consequence more extensive
drilling for hot water was started in
1933 at the Reykir thermal spring area
some 18 km. outside the city. This
yielded about 200 litres per second of
86 °C. hot water, and in the years 1939
to 1943 a new district heating system
was constructed, serving 2,300 houses
with about 30.000 people and public
buildings of the town.
The system included an 18 km. long
transmission pipeline, pumping stations,
8,000 cubic metre water storage tanks
and an underground distribution net¬
work in the streets of the town. This
system was commissioned on Decem
ber 1, 1943 and Is still operating quite
satisfactorily.
An extension of the system was built
in 1949-50. A total of 72 boreholes
were drilled producing a total of
330 litres per second of 86 "C. water.
The boreholes vary in depth from about
300 m. to 770 m.
The Reykir fields have now been
producing continuously for about
35 years, and the total production over
this period is of the order of 300 mil¬
lion cubic metres of water without
any drop in temperature or decrease
of the production rate.
A survey of the area within the
limits of the city of Reykjavik de¬
lineated a thermal area where deep
drilling (700 to 2,200 m.) was started
in 1958. The steady yield of this field
is now 300 litres per second of 128"C.
water, and more recently another
thermal area has been discovered and
developed on the eastern periphery of
the city.

Iceland is endowed with a natural hot water system which
provides heating for over 40 per cent of the population.
Hot springs abound in this land of volcanoes, the most
famous of them being the Geysir which has given its name
to similar hot springs throughout the world (see also page
16). Geysir spouts very seldom nowadays but even at
rest it gives off a thick cloud of steam (below). The
nearby Strokkur (butter-churn) spouts fairly regularly and
photos left show three phases, from left to right: the
boiling water bubbles up, pressure increases till the bubble
bursts, and finally a jet of water and steam is thrown
high in the air.

The district heating system has been
greatly expanded on the basis of these
new thermal sources and 8,700 houses
with 72,000 inhabitants were connected
to the system by the end of 1969.
This represents about 87 per .cent of
the houses in the city, and the goal of
connecting new residential quarters to
the heating system as soon as they are
b'jilt is nearing realization.
The city of Reykjavik has developed,
owned and operated the system from
the very beginning. It has been
highly successful technically and
economically and Is perhaps more
highly regarded by the inhabitants than
any other public service. This has
contributed to the general concept in
Iceland that, where thermal resources
are available, a district heating system
is a necessary and normal public
service, just as much as a cold water
supply, an electricity supply or a sewer
system.
The town of Olafsfjördur in northern
Iceland, with 1,000 Inhabitants, built its
first district heating system in 1944
using hot water of only 48 °C. produced
by drilling in a thermal area about
3 km. away. Deep drilling in 1961
yielded additional water at 56 °C. The
system comprises all the houses of
the town, and it has been quite
successful.
The town of Selfoss (2,200 in¬
habitants) In southern Iceland has a
district heating system which was built
in 1948. It heats the whole town
comprising 154,000 cubic metres of
flats and 75,000 cubic metres of public,
commercial or industrial buildings.
The village of Hveragerdi in southern
Iceland with 820 inhabitants and thera¬
peutic baths capable of handling 140
patients, is one of the main hothouse
centres for growing flowers and
vegetables. A district heating system
serving all houses in the village and
supplying heat to 30,000 square metres
of hothouses has^feesttein operation
since 1953. This is the only district
heating system in Iceland that uses a
high temperature field (180°C.).
Since about 1930 elementary and
secondary boarding schools in the
rural areas of Iceland have whenever
possible been sited at locations where
geothermal energy is available. In
these centres the school buildings and
living quarters for the pupils and staff
are geothermally heated. They are also
as a rule equipped with a swimming
pool, and are self-supplying with
vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, cau¬
liflowers, etc.) grown in their own
hothouses.
There are now many such schools
in various parts of the country, and
quite often they are used as tourist
hotels during the summer holidays.
At the end of 1969 a total of almost
80,000 people, or about 40 per cent of
the population of Iceland (204,930),
were living in houses heated with geo¬
thermal energy.
