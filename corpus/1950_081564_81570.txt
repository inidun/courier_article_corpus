IN 1945, education in Korea was almost entirely the product of forty years
of Japanese rule. Japanese was the only language taught in primary schools
and in Universities. Administrative personnel, principals, head teachers
and inspectors were nearly all Japanese.
In both South and North Korea, radical changes have been made since 1945
to increase and improve education and restore its national character.
In South Korea, the proportion of national funds spent on education has risen
from 3. 6 per cent to about 10 per cent ; the primary school enrolment has
increased from 1, 500, 000 to 2, 500, 000 ; the number of Koreans attending middle
schools has risen from 62, 000 to 225, 000. The Imperial Japanese University
has been re-organized and combined with a number of other Colleges into the
new National University of Seoul, with an attendance, since 1945, of 8, 000
students. It possesses a library of half a million oriental books and about
150, 000 western volumes. Korea University, a private Foundation, which has
an enrolment of about 1, 000, received University status in 1946.
There are also a number of Christian and Buddhist Colleges and Seminaries
in Seoul ; higher education has always been concentrated in the Seoul region,
where, about 85 per cent of the country's educational facilities exist.
Similar progress is reported to have been made in North Korea where uni-
versal elementary education was introduced in 1947 and where, at the end of
1948, there were 720 secondary schools and 11 higher educational institutions
including a University established at Pyongyang. An extensive campaign
against illiteracy was begun in North Korea in 1946.
In five years, throughout the whole country, important progress had been
made. Instruction is now given everywhere in Korean, and illiteracy has been
reduced from 50 per cent to 20 per cent.
There are, however, very serious deficiencies, particularly a shortage of
teachers (the majority of whom in 1945 were Japanese) and a lack of text-
books in Korean. There is a shortage of school buildings and most of the
existing ones are poorly equipped. Technical and vocational training is
practically non-existent.
Considerable progress had been made to improve education in Korea during
the past five years-but most of it has almost certainly been destroyed by the
material losses, social chaos and economic dislocations caused by three short
months of the present conflict.
