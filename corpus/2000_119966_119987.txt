S w e d e n : court battles 
for e q u a l p a y
◗ Elisabet Ornerborg
Even in the country with the world’s highest number of female cabinet ministers,
the gender gap is not closed in the workplace 
Despite an Equal Opportunities Act  passed in
1 9 7 9 , S wedish women earn 15 to 20 per cent
less than men. F i ve ye a rs ago, an economist
won her case, p r oving that she took home less than
her male counterp a rts in the same borough,
although her responsibilities and education we r e
i d e n t i c a l . But when it comes to comparing different
jobs deemed of equal value, the task is much more
complex.
In 1995, almost 400 Stockholm area nurses lod-
ged a wage discri m i n ation complaint with their
Equal Opportunities Ombu d s m a n . Because cases
are dealt with on an individual basis, three different
proceedings were filed in the Labour Court . A fourt h
was filed separately in 1996 by two midwives from
Orebro county council,in southern Sweden.
F i ve ye a rs down the line, none of these cases has
been resolve d .The nurses and midwives claim that
their work is of equal value to that of male medical
t e c h n i c i a n s ,but that their wages are about 15 per cent

l owe r.The former look after hospital apparatus and
require less educat i o n .
The case has revo l ved around job eva l u at i o n s.T h e
m i d w i ve s ’e m p l oye rs maintain that there is no salary
gap between the two work cat e g o ries since they receive
c o m p e n s ation for night shifts and work four hours
l e s s.The medical technicians work days only.T h e
O m budsman has argued that basic monthly wa g e s
should be compared, not those taking compensat i o n
for shift work into account.The Labour Court turn e d
to the European Court of Justice in Luxe m b o u r g,
which ruled in A p ril that basic salaries should be com-
p a r e d , taking the case back to the Swedish court .
“The most significant thing about these cases
is that they are all focusing on the difference in pay
b e t ween different professions, one dominated by
women,one by men.How do you prove that work
is of equal value? There is no precedent in our court
about this,” explains Raija Lounava a r a , of the Equal
Opportunities office.
If the nurses and midwives win their respective
c a s e s , their employe rs will be held liable for damages.
It does not follow that the 400 nurses who filed com-
plaints in 1995 will benefit .“But rulings stating that
these persons have been discri m i n ated against will
send a ve ry important message to trade unions and
e m p l oye rs ,” said Lounava a r a . N e ve rt h e l e s s , t h e
n u rs e s ’ union does not support the court cases which
break with the Swedish tradition of collective agr e e-
m e n t s. It argues that wages are best set through nego-
t i ation and by relying on market forces, gi ven the
s h o rtage of nurs e s. Since 1995, the union has streng-
thened this negotiating process and obtained the
s h a rpest wage hikes on the labour market. ■
