illitEracy  
costs more than literacy
               we cannot abandon adult literacy under the pretext that children 
                 are being educated, when we know the crucial importance 
                        of the home environment. literacy has often been associated 
               with one-off campaigns when sustained investment over time is needed.
he donor community has played 
quite a negative role by reducing 
the EFA agenda to primary school-
ing. The World Bank in particular 
has quite actively argued against 
investment in adult literacy. We 
are a very far cry from the post- 
independence era when adult 
literacy was a national priority in 
many countries. 
Sometimes past practices are at 
fault: adult literacy has often been 
associated with quick, one-off cam-
paigns whereas you clearly need 
sustained investment over time. 
National policy makers respond 
to national evidence, but there is 
a lack of good quality evaluations. 
A first priority is for governments 
to understand the scale of the chal-
lenge. Kenya’s recent national liter-
acy survey is an excellent example. 
It used direct testing of adults and 
graded results along a spectrum. It 
found that literacy challenges were

much higher than anyone had pre-
viously thought and this discovery 
is leading to new engagement on 
adult literacy. 
Second, there is an urgent need 
to build up good quality trained 
professionals to work in the sec-
tor. Third, there is a case for put-
ting together national documents 
that look at the history of literacy 
in the country, and pooling what 
has worked from the effective pro-
grammes.
Renewed 
momentum
Governments’ role is to put together 
policy frameworks and galvanize 

resources. It is now widely accepted 
that the most effective literacy pro-
grammes are those run collabora-
tively, across multiple government 
agencies, with civil society, and 
decentralized to a district level so 
that learning is relevant to the liveli-
hoods of the learners. 
There has been renewed momen-
tum over the past year around the 
UN Literacy Decade. Many big 
African countries, including Kenya, 
Nigeria and South Africa, are begin-
ning to take literacy seriously again. 
Brazil is doing extremely interesting 
work. Donors need to send out the 
message that they are willing to 
support adult literacy. We need to 
put pressure on them to support 
education plans that include adult 
literacy (as happened, for example, 
with the Fast Track Initiative’s en-
dorsement of Benin’s education 
plan which included adult literacy), 
otherwise governments will con- 
tinue to neglect it. 
The cost of not achieving literacy 
is immense. You can’t abandon 
generations of adults under the 
pretext that it is enough to educate 
the next generation of children. 
All literature shows the incredible 
importance of the home environ-
ment. A child from a non literate 
household will struggle at school. 
Women’s literacy in particular 
empowers the whole house-
hold. Adult literacy is the invisible 
glue for achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals.
