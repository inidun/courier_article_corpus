l oved football,” Mahnaz Amir Shaghaghi, w h o
coached the training session, s ays with a hint of
p ri d e .
Female enthusiasm for football really took off in
N ovember 1997 during the qualifying matches for
the 1998 World Cup.When the Iranian team unex-
pectedly scored a narrow victory over the Austra-
l i a n s , who were playing at home and were in tip-top
f o rm , the whole country exploded with joy, from the
capital to the smallest villages. Millions of men and
women poured into the streets.
A welcome for the returning heroes was set for
a week later at the Azadi Stadium, south of Te h e r a n .
The authorities made it clear on radio and television
t h at women would not be allowed into the sta-
d i u m , but to no ava i l .F i ve thousand women forced
their way in past astonished police, an event unseen
since women were banned in 1992 from attending
all-male sporting events and vice versa.
The same delirium seized the country when
the Iranians beat the U.S. team 2-1 in the French
city of Lyons during the World Cup on June 21.It
led to many appeals for women to be officially
a l l owed to play football.The popular young Iranian
actress Shifteh Farahani said she “ p r e f e rred play i n g
football to watching films.” Faezeh Hashemi, a
member of parliament (and daughter of form e r
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani),
who has done much to promote women’s sport,
finally persuaded the authorities to give in, to the
delight of female football fans. “Women had been
allowed to play basketball, but not football,” says
Shaghaghi. “But whether you touch the ball with
hand or foot,it’s the same.”
Before the Revo l u t i o n , all sports were open to
women but they only featured at national and
i n t e rn ational level in four of them—vo l l e y b a l l ,b a s-
k e t b a l l , athletics and sw i m m i n g . S p o rt swo m e n

football. But whether

1 9 7 9 , you had to choose between sport and the
ve i l ,” s ays Hashemi.
From the start of the Revolution, the govern-
ment tried to curb wo m e n ’s sport s. “The hard-
liners had a reactionary reading of religion,” says a
j o u rn a l i s t .“It all boils down to the way you interp r e t
the scri p t u r e s.” But even the moderates were against
women we a ring sports gear in front of men.This wa s
only allowed amongst other women.
These days there are women active in 25 sport s ,
including skiing, vo l l e y b a l l , b a s k e t b a l l , s h o o t i n g,
r ow i n g, k a r at e , judo and gymnastics. The stri c t
s e gr e g ation of men and women has had some posi-
t i ve effects. “ M a ny women have been trained in
recent ye a rs as referees and coaches—about 16,000
of them, in all sport s ,” s ays Shaghaghi. Iran now has
56 intern at i o n a l - l e vel women trainers for vo l l e y b a l l
and six for fencing, for example. And in recent
months, women have been taking part in motor-
racing. “Theoretical and practical courses began
three months ago and have been a great success,”
says a reporter on the daily newspaper Zan (which
means “woman” in Persian).
“The separation of the sexes has encouraged
many traditional Iranian families to allow their
daughters to play sports,which they hadn’t up till
then,” says Jilla Amiri, who played football during
the time of the Shah. Sport is also more open to
young women from the middle or lower classes.
But equipment and facilities are very meagre.
“Most sports centres are reserved for men,” says
Amiri.“We don’t have a tenth of the facilities they
h ave . Radio and television never report on wo m e n ’s
s p o rt s , not even championship mat c h e s. Pictures of
such events cannot be shown and this is a serious
block to the development of women’s sport.”
The wo m e n ’s daily Z a n is an exception. I t
reports on women’s sports and encourages its rea-
d e rs to play up to professional leve l .The paper is ru n
in fact by Faezeh Hashemi, who managed to get a
cycle path built in a park south of the capital where
boys and girls could ride their bikes together.
E ven more signific a n t l y, she has pushed the
idea of an Islamic Wo m e n ’s Games, of which two
h ave since been held in Iran. In 1993, 11 coun-
t ries took part , with a total of 345 women in
eight sport s , including shooting, table tennis,
handball and basketball. In 1997, nearly 1,000
women from 21 countries came to Teheran t o
compete in 13 sport s , including tennis, c h e s s ,g y m-
n a s t i c s , k a r at e , swimming and equestri a n i s m .
C o u n t ries invo l ved included Syri a , B a n g l a d e s h ,
Tu r k m e n i s t a n , A z e r b a i j a n , K a z a k h s t a n , In d o n e s i a
and Ku wa i t . The events were shown on televi-
s i o n , but were filmed from a distance. E ven these
broadcasts were cancelled after objections from
c o n s e rvat i ve s.
Such occasions gi ve Iranian women a chance to
compete against foreign teams, even if they them-
s e l ves are not so skilled. For higher profile intern a-
tional eve n t s , the ban on showing themselves in
s p o rts gear, especially short s , in front of men remains
a sizeable obstacle. But a woman was in the nat i o n a l
shooting team at the last Olympic Games and an Ira-
nian woman skier won a bronze medal at the A s i a n
Games at the end of last ye a r.These are two sport s
that may well attract growing numbers of Iranian
women in times ahead. n
