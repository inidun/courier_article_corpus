A t the end of the academic year in June 1998,
some 4,000 people with postgr a d u at e
d e grees and 18,000 other unive rsity gr a-
duates arrived on Morocco’s labour market.Many
of them are likely to join the 200,000 graduates of
institutions of higher learning who are already loo-
king for work and have beleaguered every govern-
ment in Rabat since the early 1990s.
The problem actually dates back to
the eighties.The structural adjustment
p r o gramme implemented then at the
urging of international financial ins-
titutions helped restore financial sta-
b i l i t y, but at the cost of severe belt-
tightening measures by the state.
The result has been that the num-
ber of gove rn m e n t - c r e ated jobs has
plummeted from 28,000 a year in the
early 1980s to 12,000 a year in the
past decade.The pri vate sector, w h i c h
e m p l oys 90 per cent of Morocco’s
wo r k f o r c e , c r e ates only 100,000 to
200,000 jobs a year,while the unem-
p l oyment rate stands at 18 per cent,according to offi-
cial figures.
As early as 1990, the casualties of budget cut-
backs began fighting back.In 1991 they decided to
put pressure on the authorities by forming an Unem-
p l oyed Unive rsity Graduat e s ’ A s s o c i at i o n , w h i c h
n ow has 120 branches throughout the country.
Jobless unive rsity gr a d u ates know how to make their
voices heard better than other unemployed people,
and the response was not long in coming.The King
of Morocco set up a National Council of Youth and
the Future (CNJA), on which all the country ’s eco-
nomic players are represented, and asked the new
body to find solutions to the thorny problem. I n
1993 the council’s diagnosis of the situation led to
the passage of a law that exempts companies from
p aying employe rs ’ social security contri butions if
they hire gr a d u ates as trainees at a modest salary
r a n ging from 1,600 to 2,600 dirhams ($166 to
$ 2 7 0 ) . In 1994, a job promotion fund was set up
to help young graduates start their own companies
and obtain loans.
These measures were unsuccessful, so a
“ youth training and employ m e n t ” p r o gr a m m e
was set up in October 1997. The goal is to place
20,000 recent unive rsity gr a d u ates in pri vat e
companies eve ry ye a r. The firms that hire them
are entitled to all the advantages granted by the
l aws of 1993 and 1994, and in addition, half the
s a l a ries paid to the new recruits are reimbu rs e d .
The programme has a 1,710-million-dirham
($176-million) budget spread out over four ye a rs.
F u rt h e rm o r e , ten “job inform ation and ori e n t a-
tion centres” h ave opened where employe rs and
p r o s p e c t i ve employe rs can meet, and soon there
will be twice as many. But in 1997 they helped
only a thousand or so gr a d u ates find wo r k .
None of these measures has solved the problem.
Is it because liberal arts and law school graduates
account for 60 to 70 per cent of the associat i o n ’s
m e m b e rship while science gr a d u at e s
make up only 20 per cent? In any
c a s e , jobless gr a d u ates were on the
m ove again when a new gove rn m e n t
was formed in May 1998. D u ring his
f i rst television appearance, t h e
g ove rnment spokesman and minis-
ter of employment announced that
the new team’s priority was to bring
d own unemploy m e n t , and that his
d e p a rtment alone was going to creat e
187 jobs. Much to his surp ri s e ,
u n e m p l oyed gr a d u ates immediat e l y
held a sit-in in front of his ministry’s
headquarters. Since then,they have
besieged the employment and fin a n c e
m i n i s t ry by turn s , while jobless agronomists have tur-
ned their attention to the agriculture ministry.
U n e m p l oyed gr a d u ates also blocked the gates of
parliament while the deputies inside discussed the
1999 finance law.
The gove rnment is counting on economic reco-
ve ry to settle the problem, at least part i a l l y. In theory,
each additional point of growth represents 20,000
new jobs,so graduates still have reason to hope. ■
