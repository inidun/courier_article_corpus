THE KING OF THE BAMOUNS AND HIS ALPHABET
THE rich complexity of
civilization in advanced
countries is frequently
advanced as an argu-
ment to demonstrate the basic
superiority of the"white
race"in character and intel-
ligence."Have the Negroes
or the Indians produced a
Plato, a Shakespeare, a Des-
cartes, a Newton ? is the
question which has greeted
even the most convincing
scientific evidence of the ba-
sically equal abilities of all
branches of the human family.
To compare such varied cul-
tures in order to prove that
the Negroes or Indians are
congenitally inferior to the
whites is a process of reason-
ing without V"e. The fun-
uaiiientl discoveries oh 7.'hich
our whole civilization has
been built-fire, weaving,
pottery, agriculture, rearing of
stock-were made by men
whose skin pigmentation is
today unknown, but whose
stage of development was
certainly far behind that of

writing and instructed his
people in its use, should help
ill-informed sceptics to over-
come their doubts about the
creative spirit of the Negro
race. The details of the
following story are taken from
an article written for a scien-
tific journal by the French
scientist Maurice Delafosse.
In 1899, when the Germans
occupied his kingdom, Njoya
needed to communicate with
his village chiefs and with
those of his people attached to
the German Command, but he
; jid not want the Germans to
know what'was in his letters.
He therefore decided to invent
a writing that the Europeans
could not understand. Call-
ing together his head men, he
explained his plan and asked
their assistance in finding
signs for each of the words of
thus creating a syllabic writ-
ing.
These signs acquired a pu-
rely phonetic and conventional
value, instead of suggesting
objects or ideas. For instance,
a calabash (ka) was first
shown by the drawing of a
gourd ; later this same but
simplified drawing was used
to signify the syllable"ka..
which forms part of many
words.
In a few years, Njoya had
advanced from picture-writ-
ing to a phonetical system-
achieving what the Egyptians
accomplished, and then in a
very imperfect fashion, only
after centuries of stumbling
efforts. For a time, King
Njoya's system of writing re-
mained half-pictorial, h a I f-
phonetic, yet all the while the
syllabic side was nevertheless
being perfected.
Five yes. later, the king,

vations made in a missionary
school, introduced a new re-
form by giving his system a
purely alphabetic character.
rica. One may even say,
without wanting to sound
paradoxical, that a savage
living in an isolated region
and provided with few cultural
advantages, required far more
genius to discover the bow or
the boomerang than inventors
today in their work to split
the atom and to perfect the
machines which are the pride
of this modern age.
Each new discovery is the
product of people engaged in
simultaneous research, who
frequently arrive at identical
results at the same time. La-
boratories and research wor-
kers collaborate so closely in
this twentieth century that
individual discoveries are be-
coming increasingly rare and
difficult to achieve. The pro-
g r e s s of our civilization
indeed relies on this vast
network of reciprocal contacts
and on this collective research
performed by teams of experts.
To evolve a new technique
from nothing, as one might
say, is obviously a much slower
and more difficult process.
The Unknown lit-roes
C CENTURIES ago, a poetsadly recalled the her s
who had died unknown,
because there was no Homer
at that time to record their
valorous exploits for future
generations. One could spe-
culate on the number of great
men who lived among the pri-
mitive races but of whom we
know nothing simply because,
lacking the written word, all
remembrance of them has
been lost. If we study ancient
chronicles, missionary ac-
counts, books of travel and
works of modern ethnogra-
phers, we can discover an
amazing gallery of talented
men, even men of genius,
among the so-called"inferior
races", who have been so
lightly dubbed"the white
man's burden".
A man's accomplishments
are limited by his cultural
background. The story of
King Njoya of the Bamouns,
in the Cameroons, who invent-
ed, by himself, a system of
the local language.
The system of writing de-
vised by the king in collabo-
ration with his counsellors,
began as a picture language
in symbols, each sign repre-
senting either the drawing of
a definite object or"the ma-
terialised shape evoked by an
abstract idea". Each s i g n
thus corresponded to a word,
but without relation to the
number of syllables in this
word.
A Stroke CM Genius
SEVERAL years later, Njoyaconceived an idea that
was truly a stroke of
genius. Words were no longer
to be represented by drawings,
but the same drawings were
to represent groups of sounds,
He decided to keep only 80 of
the 350 original signs, and
those that represented the
first ten numbers. He stipu-
lated that"each of the alpha-
bet signs should represent one
sound only, the numerical
signs keeping, in addition, the
value of figures".
Frankly speaking, this last
step towards alphabetic writ-
ing was by no means perfect.
The royal phonetician did not
succeed in breaking entirely
free from syllabism, so the
phonetic value of the 80 signs
was not always clearly shown.
Aware of the faults in his
system, he made several
attempts to simplify it. In
1916, the year when his writ-
ing-method was the subject of
the story here outlined, his
system seemed well on the
Native kings. such as this West African ruler, must exercise judgement

way to becoming purely alpha-
betic. The signs bore less and
less relation to primitive pic-
ture-symbols and became let-
ters with increasingly simple
outlines.
A Royal Teacher
ONCE having evolved amethod of writing, this
wise man launched a
large-scale campaign to teach
the alphabet to his people.
He bought slates from the
whites and personally taught
pupils who, in turn, became
teachers. The period of ins-
truction over, the king conti-
nued to correspond with them
and this interchange of letters
kept alive their interest. By
the middle of 1907, more than
600 of his subjects knew how
to read and write. Njoya
formed offices of administra-
tion, a public records depart-
ment and a Registrar of re-
ceipts and expenses.
Attempts may be made to
belittle the genius of Njoya by
stating that he probably ob-
tained the idea of writing
from the Arabs or the whites.
But this in no say detracts
from the significance of his
discovery. He may have
known that the whites used
written symbols to communi-
cate with each other, but he
certainly could have known
nothing of the method. His
own system originated out of
his native intelligence and in-
itiative. Let us also remember
that cutting through time and
tradition he achieved results
in a few years that other sys-
tems of writing known to us
today took centuries and even
thousands of years to attain.
About the middle of the
19th century, another Negro,
Momuru Doalu Bukere of the
Vai tribe in Liberia, invented
a system of writing which won
a certain fame. Based on the
pictorial writing used by his
tribe, he gave a phonetic value
to the signs. Today, thousands
of natives still use this system
invented by the"noble and
modest"Momuru Doalu Bu-
kere.
The story of King Njoya was
deliberately chosen for this
article because documents are
available, and a study of them
enables us to follow Njoya's
line of reasoning. Many
examples of talent, sometimes
of genius, could have been
cited among primitive tribes.
A great deal could be said of
the Maya Indians of Central
America, who, entirely removed
from outside influences, had
already-between two and
three thousand years ago-
discovered the zero and given
a positional value to figures.
The so-called"savage"or
"barbarian"state does not
originate from any congenital
inability. It is simply one
transitory form of culture
among others, equally trans-
itory. Neither primitive nor
advanced civilizations have
explored the full possibilities
of mankind. One thing that
seems certain, however, is the
statement in the Declaration
on Race published by Unesco,
which affirms that :"the
range of mental capacities in
all ethnic groups is much the
same."
