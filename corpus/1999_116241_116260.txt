Relying on the sole efforts of volunteers, P roject Gutenberg has been
launching the world’s literary heritage into cyberspace for nearly 
30 years while conducting a crusade against copyright re s t r i c t i o n s

When Michael Hart , a student at the
U n i ve rsity of Illinois, was gi ven a free
I n t e rnet account, he spent an hour
p o n d e ring the potential of the gi f t , then typed
in the A m e rican Declaration of
Independence and sent it to eve ryone on the
n e t wo r k s. Project Gutenberg had just been
b o rn .
T h at was back in 1971, when only 23
c o m p u t e rs in the U. S . were online and
computer memories were small. B e l i e v i n g
t h at the gr e atest value created by computers
would be the storage and retri e val of library
m at e ri a l s ,H a rt continued his project with the
U. S .C o n s t i t u t i o n , the books of the Bible and
S h a k e s p e a r e ’s play s. As computer powe r
i n c r e a s e d , he launched into book-length
m a n u s c ri p t s ,b e ginning with a popular classic,
Alice in Wo n d e rl a n d. To d ay, there are 160
million Internet accounts globally and
Michael Hart ’s free cy b e r - l i b r a ry just posted
its 2,000th title: C e rva n t e s ’ Don Quixote, i n
S p a n i s h.While the majority of titles are in
E n g l i s h , the library also comprises a handful
in French, Italian and Lat i n .
Idealistic and utilitarian
Although he claims he’s never read a
computer manual, H a rt , the son of a
professor specializing in Shakespeare and a
m at h e m at i c i a n , is a child of the inform at i o n
a g e , a recluse who prefers to communicat e
via e-mail from his home in Urbana, I l l i n o i s.
“I started the project because I am idealistic
and utilitari a n ,” s ays Hart , a self-descri b e d
blue-collar rebel.
“Michael Hart should be as famous as Bill
G at e s ,” a s s e rts C h i c a go Tri bu n e c o m p u t e r
columnist Jim Coat e s. But Hart has neve r
t ruly reaped the mat e rial reward from being
the first to post texts on the net. P r o j e c t
Gutenberg is a non-profit enterp ri s e ,e n t i r e l y
funded through donat i o n s. Its first grant came
from A p p l e , and others followed from such
outfits as Hewlett Pa c k a r d , IBM and
M i c r o s o f t , whether in the form of super
s c a n n e rs or dollars.
“ We don’t have a budget of any kind,”
a s s e rts Hart flat l y. The project, w h i c h
averages 36 new books a ye a r , relies on some
1,000 vo l u n t e e rs. Nor is there an editori a l
c o m m i t t e e .Vo l u n t e e rs are encouraged to
choose books they’d like to add to the library,
as long as they fall into the public domain,
which restricts the selection to pre-1923
wo r k s.They scan and proof the books before
sending them to Hart , who puts them on-
line in Plain Vanilla A S C I I , the most
widespread code for inform ation interchange.
H a rt ’s technique has its cri t i c s. I n
E n g l a n d , the Oxford Text A r c h i ve compri s e s
over 2,500 online titles specifically geared to
the academic community. Hence the
i m p o rtance of enriching the raw text with
footnotes and choosing the most widely
respected edition of a wo r k . Such details are
far from Hart ’s chief concern . In his wish to
make classics available to the masses, h i s
gr e atest crusade is against copyright law.S i n c e
the launching of Project Gutenberg, the time
p e riod of copyright in the U. S . has been
extended twice, which according to Hart ,
“ e l i m i n ated two million books from lists we
could be using.”H a rt has been threatened by
dozens of law s u i t s ,r e p o rtedly for digi t a l i z i n g
editions of books that are still covered by
c o p y ri g h t .
M a ny publishers claim that the Gutenberg
project is no threat to bu s i n e s s.N o rt h we s t e rn

from Project Gutenberg. “This is public
domain mat e ri a l ,” s ays Nicholas We i r -
W i l l i a m s ,director of Nort h we s t e rn Unive rs i t y
P r e s s. “The Melville mat e rial on the we b
d o e s n ’t damage our sales.” “ You could put
full texts of eve ry book you publish on the
n e t ,” adds Walter Lippincott, director of
P rinceton Unive rsity Press,“and it wo u l d n ’t
h u rt sales. I don’t think anybody wants to read
ve ry much online.And who wants to sit there
and print out hundreds of pages?”
On the contrary, H a rt predicts a bri g h t
future for e-texts, if only for ve ry simple
r e a s o n s.“Most people don’t have 2,000 books
in their entire home,”he say s.“ You can now fit
t h at many books on one disk, for free.” B u t
p e e ring into his crystal ball, he also foresees
public domain copyright laws extending on.
“If this is, i n d e e d , the inform ation age, I ask:
‘the inform ation age . . . for whom’?” n
