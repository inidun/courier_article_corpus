SCHOOLS THAT TRAVEL ON CAMELBACK
by Andr√© BLANCHET
OUTWARDLY there was nothingabout the brown-coloured
goatskin tent to distinguish it
from the others in the Saharan
nomad encampment I was visiting.
But when I stepped inside I found
myself in a well-equipped classroom.
All the basic materials were there-
a blackboard, the china ink pots, a
teacher's cupboard (a reduced model
about the size of a suitcase) and
even a school timepiece, which in
this case was an alarm clock
showing the official time of the chief
town in the region.
There were other similarities
between this nomad school in Mau-
ritania (French West Africa) and
those in Marseilles or Paris. Subjects
on the list of assignments which was
posted up would have been familiar
to most French children. But the
homework had a distinctly local
character.
I was able, for instance, to hear
one of the boys give an informed
account of camel raising. For the
following day he and. his companions
were asked to write a short essay on
the grinding of millet. Again, as I
leafed through their notebooks I
found that arithmetic had also
absorbed some aspects of the way of
life of these Bidanes (the name
means literally'white-skinned
people'). Exercises and problems
were expressed in terms of camels,
young goats and cups of tea.
In short, everything in the school
had been conscientiously adapted to
the surroundings, even down to the
hours of attendance which had been
arranged so as to fit in with Moslem
customs. The children only start
French classes in the morning after
they have had the traditional Kora-
nic teaching, and lessons begin again
in the afternoon after the second
prayers of the day are over.
The most original and studied
adaptation to local conditions,
however, was made in the setting up
of the school itself. A tent is used
because the school must be able to
travel with the tribe, and the tribe
itself is dependent upon the vagaries
of wells and pasturelands. In other
parts of French West Africa, parti-
cularly around the Niger, boarding
schools have for long been opened
for children of nomads, but these
are permanent buildings, not tra-
velling tent schools.
In Mauritania, a few camels are all
that is needed to carry the desert
school with its classroom and its
specially adapted equipment.
Instead of benches, children use
individual stools. The teacher's
cupboard has two handles to facili-
tate transport. As for the desks,
they take to pieces easily and are
drilled with holes so that they can
be lashed firmly to the swaying
back of a camel.
Pupils are therefore able to work
under normally comfortable condi-
tions as long as the nomad schools'
one merciless enemy, the wind, does
not whip up great clouds of sand.
When this happens school has to
stop for the day.
The wanderings of these Maurita-
nian schools depend upon the habits
of individual tribes. The Adrar
school travels as much as 500 miles
a year, but there are others that
move only every four or five months
and then only for a few miles.
Yet, thanks to an official who
probably is the only one of his kind
in the world, these schools do not
move across the desert like drift-
wood on the ocean, abandoned and
unguided. As the schools have
managed to adapt themselves to the
nomad way of life, so a teacher has
found the way to adapt himself to
the task of inspecting them, and to
do so has traded his traditional
master's cane for a camel-driver's
switch.
If you ask him what his needs are,
he will tell you that he only requires
a camel. Incidentally, he is alloted
one from the herd maintained by
the educational service of Maurita-
nia, which is probably the only
educational body in the world to
include a herd of camels on its
inventory.
'"Director of Camp Schools in Mau-
ritania"-this is the official title
of Marc Lenoble, the inspector who
is always on the move. Very few of
the 800 Europeans living in Mau-
ritania-less than one every 400
square miles-have ever crossed his
path. And they, have little chance
of seeing him in St. Louis, the capital
of the territory. Monsieur Lenoble
spent the entire school year of 1951-
52 without once going there.
He is always on the move because
some of the schools which he
inspects are as much as 220 miles
apart-220 miles of desert. From
Adrar to Trarze, from Krakna to
Tagant, Monsieur Lenoble travels
across Mauritania at the majestic,
rolling pace qf his mount, usually
Marc lenoble, the nomad school inspector of Mauritania, spends two weeks out
of every four on camelback journeying between his desert schools. Some of
these are more than 200 miles apart and travel as much as 500 miles each year
Having a tent classroom, the desert school is able to travel with the tribe whose moves depend
on the vagaries of wells and pastures. At the traditional feast that is offered to him, M. Leno-
ble will try to pursuade a chiefto allow the children of the tribe to attend school. During the
discussions, blue-veiled women dance in his honour before the tent (photons Eric Schwab.)
accompanied by an escort provided
in turn by each encampment he
visits.
So it is easy to understand why,
when he goes on leave after spending
nine months gazing at the Saharan
landscape, the wheat-fields in cen-
tral France look green to him even
at harvest time.
On the job, he mounts his camel,
wearing a huge blue turban, wound
as dexterously as that of any Btdane.
If it weren't for his spec-
tacles, there would be no
way of telling he was a
European. His clothing
consists of two garments
- a black, sleeveless
Mauritanian shirt with
the shirt-front and back
held together by loop
rather than seams, and a
white serouel, the flaring
Saharan trousers whose
generous folds form a
omfortable cushion on a
saddle.
This young teacher
has adopted the nomad
life completely. His only
piece of furniture is his
leather saddle, as deep
and comfortable as an
armchair and lavishly
decorated. The only
luggage he carries is a
long, shapeless bag, also
of leather. A guerbe-
a goatskin waterbag-
the most precious pos-
session of any nomad,
because it means the
difference between life
and death, completes his
equipment which, like
his food supply, includes
nothing European. In
his bag, he carries only
dates, tea and sugar, the
standard menu of the
Sahara.
Desert hospitality,
however, breaks the mo-
notony of this austere
diet. When the inspec-
tor visits the chief of a
tribe or camp, he is
doing so as a sort of
ambassador. In the pres-
'nt stage of education
in Mauritania, his job
calls just as much for
persuasion as it does for
inspection and organization. While
he can check up on the standard of
a school in a single morning, he may
spend many hours or even days in
long discussions before he convinces
a chief that the tribe's children
should be in school.
During the interminable meals
that are offered to the desert tra-
veller he will delicately broach the
subject, while servant girls wearing
blue veils dance in his honour before
the tent. Seated cross-legged on a
pile of cushions next to the chief,
he waits patiently while the long
succession of traditional dishes are
placed before them.
Hours go by. They eat, sleep and
talk. The chief reminds him that
the ambition of a Bidane father is
to prepare his daughters for mar-
riage. They are not required to
work and seldom leave their tents.
But Monsieur Lenoble would like
to see some young Bidane girls in his
camp schools. At present, the only
girls going to school in Mauritania
are some 40 in a class at Boutilimit,
the real educational centre of the
territory, (it has a teacher's training
school and nine teachers). There,
the girls live together, far from the
family tent.'
Insistence on the part of Monsieur
Lenoble finally brings from the chief
the promise that, starting the next
day, he will send his own daughters
to the camp school. After all, you
cannot refuse anything to a guest.
But Monsieur Lenoble cannot be sure
that, the next time he passes by, he
will not have to begin the same
conversation all over again, seated
on the same cushions with more
glasses of boiling hot tea in front of
him.
This change from a quiet, pro-
vincial schoolroom in France to the
life of a nomad in the Sahara is now
taken as a matter of course by Mon-
sieur Lenoble.
Summing up his work, he says :
"One of the guiding principles of
education in this territory is that
the child or the adolescent must not
be separated from his social envir-
onment but must be trained to
serve it."This principle, applied
throughout the'camp schools'will
inevitably become a source of
strength to the Saharan mmad
communities.
