Intricate geometric and floral designs on the plaster foot and hand
seen here are typical examples of the art of mehndi (henna) painting,
a form of body decoration that holds an important place in Indian art
and culture. Powder from ground henna leaves is made into a
coloured paste which women, particularly those of the Vaishya community
in Rajasthan, use to paint symbolic designs on their hands and feet.

A FOR HAPPINESS
idi" art of symbols for all seasons
IN India, religious beliefs often
inspire traditional folk arts. In
Rajasthan State, southwest of
Delhi where the famed Rajput forts
and palaces dot the fertile plains, the
art of Mehndi or hand painting for
women is integrated with the region's
festivals and ceremonial occasions.
For centuries, women in India and
the Middle East have used mehndi or
henna for decoration, but the women
of the Vaishya community in Rajasthan
are noted for using it to cover their
palms, fingers and feet with artistic
designs. These decorations vary
according to the occasion, whether
it is a marriage, childbirth, or festi¬
vals such as Holi and Gangour.
Mehndi or henna is widely culti¬
vated in Africa and southwest Asia
as an ornamental and dye plant. Its
uses include dyeing hair and some¬
times animals and hides. It is also
used as an astringent against skin
diseases, burns and bruises.
From Biblical times, Egyptian and
Indian women dyed their fingernails
and parts of their hands and feet an
orange red colour with henna paste
in order to enhance their beauty.
The colour would last three or four
weeks.
Mehndi art holds an important
place in Indian art and culture and
is described among the So/ah Sringar
(sixteen adornments of a woman).
Maharisi Vatsyayan also included
mehndi as one of his 64 arts for
women, which include painting the
teeth, dyeing cloth and staining the
body with sandal wood, saffron and
myrtle.
It was believed that mehndi pain¬
ting came to India with the Muslims,
but it actually began long before the
Gupta period (350 A. D.). The
ancient Ajanta-Ellora cave murals
depict scenes relating to mehndi
decoration. In one mural, a princess
of Pataliputra reclines half-asleep
under a tree while her girlfriends
busily paint her hands and feet with
mehndi designs.
But the use of mehndi became
common at the beginning of the
Mogul period during Muslim raids on
villages to kidnap young virgins. The
raiders would also often take young
married women. In order to distin¬
guish themselves from unmarried
women, married women used mehndi
because it faded much more slowly
than the tumeric or saffron with which
they were usually anointed.
Today this body adornment has
evolved into intricate geometric and
floral designs, which still flourish as
an essential decoration that has be¬
come lost and forgotten in other
countries.
Mehndi in the form of henna leaves
is ground into a powder and mixed
with lemon juice, candy water and
a few drops of kerosene to produce a
paste of deep, long lasting colour.
Hands and feet are washed well with
besan (gram flour) or soap.
A matchstick or thin wire or even
just an index finger is used to apply
the beautiful patterns. The paste is
put on in the form of a thin thread
without allowing the applicator to
touch the skin. When the design is
completed, it is left to dry and stain
the palm.
Etching lime paste on the red
mehndi produces the "batik" method,
or white designs on red background.
To maintain the deep red colour,
sesame or mustard oil is rubbed on
the hands and then washed off with
water. The designs can last two or
three weeks. Although ready-made
designs also exist and can be applied
quickly, they fade much more
rapidly. Both time and devotion are
required for the task involved in
applying these designs (four to eight
hours in the case of brides).
Mehndi is a symbol of good luck
in married life. It is believed that the
deeper the red colour of mehndi on a
woman's palms, the more herhusband
loves her. As a symbol of lasting
love between husband and wife, only
married women are permitted to
practice the art of mehndi and women
consider it a sign of wifehood.
Unmarried women and widows are
not allowed to wear mehndi designs,
although dead women are decorated
like brides with mehndi. Unmarried
girls and boys are not allowed to stain
their feet with mehndi as it is a bad
omen. A pregnant woman cannot
use mehndi.
It is believed that Lakshmi, the
goddess of luck and happiness, dwells
in mehndi designs. If a dot of
mehndi stains the forehead of a man
or woman, it is considered to be a
sign of luck. Mehndi is also a
symbol of good luck offered to gods
and goddesses to appease them and
request favours and to ward off evil
spirits. Thus religious, luck-seeking
women all over India love to wear
mehndi.

MEHNDI'S MANY MEANINGS. Mehndi designs like the one
being applied with artistic skill (above) are used to mark numerous occasions
and events, including the seasons, festivals and ceremonies, and they are
especially linked with marriage and happiness in married life. Motifs in the
mehndi paintings on these pages include flowers (for happiness), scorpions
(symbol of love), and sweetmeats (long married life). The art of mehndi has
also evolved with the times. In "old mehndi" style (right) designs are drawn
within a square or rectangle covering the whole of the palm. "New mehndi"
design (above right) is done within a circle leaving enough space around
the central motif to highlight its beauty.

are essential decorations for a mar¬
riage ceremony. Another Hindu
custom named hathleva where the
bride and groom in front of the
sacred fire, hold each other's hand
in which a ball of mehndi has been
placed, also symbolizes their union.
Their palms both become stained and
it is believed that the deeper the
tint of mehndi, the happier their
married life will be.
Arranged marriages where the
bride and groom first meet at the
marriage ceremony are still common
in India. The philosophy that love
germinates with the consummation
of marriage and grows with time is
expressed in a folk song in which
mehndi plays an integral part:
Bana (the groom), you are rich in
colour like mehndi,
I keep you in my closed fist.
Bana, you are beautiful like colly-
rium,
I keep you hidden in my
eyelids.
Bana, you are beautiful like the sun,
I keep you in my flower vase.
Bana, you are lustrous like a pearl,
I keep you threaded in my
nose-ring.
Bana, you are rich in colour like
mehndi,
I wear you lovingly in my
beautiful palm.
In another sentimental Rajasthani
folk song, a man remarks on the
beautiful mehndi coloured palms of
his beloved:
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
Put thy hand on my heart;
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
I make an offering of rubies
and jewels;
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
Mehndi designs can be classified
according to the following divisions:
seasons, festivals, ceremonies and
miscellaneous. Miscellaneous de¬
signs supplement the specific and
rather limited designs for festivals
and ceremonies. Many local folk
customs and beliefs are represented
in these designs.
Blcchu, the scorpion, is a symbol of
love and a popular design, especially
in the summer. The parrot is also an
important symbol in Rajasthani folk
songs as the heroine's messenger.
The peacock, noted for its beauty and
multicoloured appearance, is the be¬
loved companion of wives who have
been separated from their husbands.
Other daily objects depicted are
sweetmeats, clothes, flowers and
objects used in games, such as cha-
karis (a whirling toy like a pulley).
Keri (unripe mango) and water
chestnuts are also often drawn, as
well as lotuses. Designs with the
sun, moon, stars and keri repre¬
sent perfect, continuous married life.
Flowers symbolize happiness, unripe
mangoes signify virginity and the
coming of summer, and the peacock,
parrot and scorpion symbolize love.
Indian seasons are summer, rains
and winter. The summer and rainy
seasons last from the Holi to the
Deepava/i festivals, or from March
to October. Mehndi is suitable for
the summer because it produces a
cool, soothing effect on the hands
and has medicinal properties which
are also appreciated during the rainy
season. Hundreds of varieties of
bijanis (fans) are a popular and appro¬
priate motif for summer as they
symbolize air and relief from heat.
During the rainy season, the designs
are more abundant, elaborate and
exuberant than during the summer
and even more so than in the winter.
Mehndi designs reach their height of
beauty and magnificence during this
time. They include keri and cho-
par, which is a game resembling
backgammon. Lañaría, which is an
ocean wave or river's ripple, repre¬
sents surging human emotions of joy
and excitement and reflects the pre¬
vailing mood of the season. It is
also the season of mela or fairs, festi¬
vals and swings when women spend
their time holidaying and swinging in
the qarden. The emotions expressed
in brilliant garments with both rain¬
bow colours and laharia and keri^ mo¬
tifs have been transferred to mehndi
designs. Ghevar, a variety of sweet¬
meat presented to sisters by brothers
during a festival, provides the inspi¬
ration for another common mehndi
design.
Winter is the least auspicious
season for mehndi due to its cooling
effect and therefore there are fewer
designs.
SPECIFIC designs are used for
certain festivals such as Kajjali
Tija. Holi ana Gangour. Many
ceremonies and festivals are meant
for the well-being of male members
of a household. But the Tija festival
honours married women who decor¬
ate their palms with house designs
to wish for increased material wealth
for their husbands.
Holi, one of the most colourful
festivals in India, honours the impor¬
tant historic period of Vedic religious
feuds. During this time, women
draw two of the oldest musical instru¬
ments on their palms. These are
used only for songs relating to this
festival.
Gangour, a marriage festival, is
one of the most significant for mehndi.
On the last day, unmarried girls
hoping to find a suitable husband put
32 marks of mehndi on the wall.
-Married women hope for an eternal
married life by drawing designs of
various sweetmeats.
Mehndi designs are only loosely
classified according to various cere¬
monial occasions such as first pre
gnancy and suraj (childbirth). How¬
ever, in marriage ceremonies, kalasha
(pitcher) and the swastika are signi¬
ficant symbols on the bride's hands.
The pitcher is significant in all reli¬
gious ceremonies while the swastika
symbolizes the well-being of the
future. The bride's hands are also
decorated with mehndi on the occa¬
sion of her leaving her mother's house
for that of her mother-in-law and vice
versa.
EHNDI designs are never
static but change with
time. Just as new ideas
keep folk songs and tales up to date,
so are new lines added to the mehndi
art.
In "old mehndi," the designs are
drawn within a square or rectangle
and the whole palm is covered from
the wrist to the fingertips so that
there are few bare surfaces. In
"new mehndi," the designs are done
within concentric circles and cover
only the centre of the palm, with
empty spaces scantily covered with
small motifs.
"Old mehndi" tends to crowd the
least available space with heavy
motifs, but "new mehndi" leaves
enough space around the central
motif to highlight its beauty, a trend
which follows modern painting. Now
the trend is for floral designs.
Mehndi customs also prevail in the
states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal,
Orissa, Gujarat, Kashmir and Haryana
which borders Rajasthan. . These
states have their own folk songs
which express mehndi's importance
in daily life. Mehndi also became
part of Muslim tradition when thou¬
sands of Hindus converted to Islam
during the Mogul period and took
their customs, including mehndi,
with them. Muslims call it Muhar-
ram but the variety of their designs
is not as great as those of Hindu
women.
Mehndi has been deeply woven
into the fabric of folk life and has
infiltrated proverbs. The "mehndi
stained hand" proverb refers to those
who shirk their work. It is also said
that "mehndi only gives colour when
it is ground on stone with a pestle,"
meaning that only when a person
undergoes hardship can he or she
gain some experience from life.
Mehndi presents a true picture of
folk life and a window on the folk way
of thinking. Two meaningful lines by
an Urdu poet express the beauty,
romance and richness of the mehndi
tradition:
"Now I have decided to write my
heart's desire on mehndi leaves. So
when she comes to pluck mehndi
leaves, she may lay her hand upon
them and read my secret message."
