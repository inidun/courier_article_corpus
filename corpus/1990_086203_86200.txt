It seemed like a dream come true.
Two chemists had come up with a
cheap, simple, clean and virtually in-
. exhaustible source of energy. If it had
been true, and could have been
made to work, it would have solved
the energy problems of humankind
for far into the future.
But science does not usually yield
such easy solutions, and this case was
no exception. It is fairly certain now
that the so-called "cold fusion"
phenomenon was not the break¬
through it was initially claimed to be.
No one is yet certain what the
phenomenon ¡s or even if there is a
phenomenon at all, but the events
that have surrounded it since last year
hold many lessons for those who
practice science.
Martin Fleischmann of
Southampton University and Stanley
Pons of the University of Utah, both
respected scientists in the field of
electrochemistry, announced on 23
March 1989 that they had achieved
nuclear fusion in an electrolytic cell.
They had filled the cell, similar to a
glass beaker, with a solution made
from heavy water, in which the
hydrogen in the water molecules is
a rare form known as deuterium.
They immersed In this solution two

electrodes, one of platinum and one
of a metal called palladium. They
passed an electric current through
the solution by connecting the elec¬
trodes to a battery. After some time
they found that a large amount of
heat was being produced in the cell,
much more than that generated by
the power of the battery.
Their explanation was simple:
passing an electric current through
the solution freed the deuterium
from the heavy water molecules and
it was then absorbed into the palladi¬
um electrode. Once inside the elec¬
trode, they claimed, deuterium atoms
fused together to form larger atoms
of helium and released energy in the
process. This nuclear reaction is the
same process as that which fuels the
sun and other stars as well as provid¬
ing the destructive power of the
hydrogen bomb.
It was ¡n the 1920s and 1930s,
when scientists were probing the
atomic nucleus and piecing together
its structure, that they realized that
reactions between nuclei could
release large amounts of energy.
Nuclear fission is the reaction where
a large heavy nucleus splits apart into
two or more fragments. A working
fission reactor was first demonstrated

in 1 942, and in 1 945 fission was put
to lethal use over Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
Nuclear fusion is the binding
together of small light nuclei and is
the basis of the devastating hydrogen
bombs developed in the 1950s.
Scientists have been trying for the last
thirty years to harness nuclear fusion
as a peaceful source of energy, but
the methods they have been using are
still probably decades away from suc¬
cess. Fusion has certain advantages
over fission as a source of energy: it
produces little in the way of radio¬
active waste and its fuel is deuterium
and another heavy form of hydrogen
known as tritium, both of which can
be extracted in great abundance from
seawater.
The problem in achieving fusion
is getting the nuclei close enough
together for them to fuse. Nuclei are
composed of protons, sub-atomic
particles which have a positive elec¬
tric charge, and neutrons, which are
neutral. Nuclei thus have a net posi¬
tive charge and, like similar poles of
a magnet, two positive nuclei will
repel each other. This repulsion,
known as the Coulomb barrier, is very
strong, and scientists have tried to
overcome it using huge fusion reac¬
tors about the size of an office block.
There are a number of such reac¬
tors in the United States, the Soviet
Union, Europe and Japan. They are
used to heat up a plasma, a charged
gas, of deuterium and tritium to enor¬
mous pressures and temperatures,
comparable to conditions in the in¬
terior of the sun, and they confine the
plasma with strong magnetic fields.
Under these conditions, nuclei collide
together with such force that fusion
reactions do take place, but in cur¬
rent machines the amount of ener¬
gy put in to create the reaction ¡s
greater than the energy prod.uced by
the fusion so they are not yet feasi¬
ble as sources of energy. There are
a number of alternative methods
such as bombarding small pellets of
fusion material with powerful laser or
particle beams to produce brief bursts
of energy.

Considering all the time, effort
and money that has been put into
pursuing traditional "hot" fusion
research, it is not surprising that there
was some disbelief when Fleisch¬
mann and Pons announced their
breakthrough with cold fusion in
something akin to a test-tube. Much
of the disbelief was reserved for the
method the discoverers chose to
announce their discovery. Scientific
advances are usually announced by
submitting a paper to a specialist
journal or conference. Before publi¬
cation or presentation to the confer¬
ence, the paper is refereed by other
experts In the field and often changes
are made to ¡t as a result of their
comments. First reports of cold fusion
appeared ¡n London's Financial Times
and New York's Wall Street Journal.
The same day Fleischmann and Pons
held a press conference at the Univer¬
sity of Utah and that evening cold
fusion was on the national television
news.
The search for signs
of fusion
The two Utah chemists were not
the only people who were ex¬
perimenting with cold fusion. Just 75
kilometres from the University of
Utah at Brigham Young University,
Steven Jones, a physicist, had been
working for years on exotic ways of
achieving nuclear fusion. He had de¬
tected signs of fusion in electrolytic
cells similar to those of Fleischmann
and Pons. The two research teams
were aware of each other's work and
had agreed to submit their results
simultaneously to the British journal
Nature on 24 March. When Jones
heard about the press conference at
Utah University on 23 March he went
ahead and sent his results to Nature
only to discover that Fleischmann and
Pons had submitted a paper to
another publication, the Journal of
Electroanalytical Chemistry, on 11
March. The two chemists then went
on to submit a paper to Nature but
when asked to make some altera¬
tions they said they were too busy
with new work and withdrew their
paper.
After publication of a scientific
breakthrough, it is common practice
for other researchers in the same field
to repeat the experiment to confirm
or refute it. Dozens of teams around
the world tried to do so after hearing
the press reports about cold fusion
but they were hampered by lack of
information. Even when Fleischmann
and Pons's paper was published a
couple of weeks after the announce¬
ment, the technical detail was scarce.
The most obvious way to identify
that fusion is occurring is the detec¬
tion of heat. But this is not a simple
matter in an electrolytic cell where
there are many other factors affect¬
ing the heat content of the cell. Other
possible by-products of a fusion reac¬
tion include neutrons, gamma rays
and tritium. Detection of one or more
of these would be strong evidence.
Fleischmann and Pons claimed to
have detected in their original experi¬
ment large amounts of excess heat
as well as gamma rays and neutrons,
but gamma rays can be produced
naturally by rocks, and some neutron
detectors are notoriously inaccurate.
In the weeks that followed the an¬
nouncement, research teams around
the world declared that they had
found heat, or one of the by¬
products, ora combination, but many
found nothing. One of the main dis¬
crepancies in the chemists' claim was
that for the amount of heat they
observed, the number of neutrons
detected was far too low.
Meanwhile, on 26 April, Fleisch¬
mann and Pons appeared before the
Science, Space and Technology Com¬
mittee of the US House of Represen¬
tatives to explain their work. They
requested $25-40 million to set up a
cold fusion institute at the Universi¬
ty of Utah. Their request was refused
but a centre was set up in August
with money from the state of Utah.
Government interest was such that
the Department of Energy set up an
expert panel to investigate the
matter.
The debate among scientists
continued to rage. At a meeting of
the American Electrochemical Socie¬
ty in Texas in early April, Fleischmann
and Pons were hailed as heroes. By
the time of the American Physical So¬
ciety Meeting at the beginning of
May, however, there had been a
growing number of negative ex¬
perimental results. The consensus at a
specially convened meeting at Santa
Fe in late May was ambiguous, with
virtually equal numbers of results for
and against.
The number of unfavourable ex¬
perimental results continued to grow
during the course of the year. On 12
November the Department of Ener¬
gy panel published its report and its
conclusions were unequivocal: "the
experimental results... reported to
date do not represent convincing evi¬
dence that useful sources of energy
will result from the phenomena at¬
tributed to cold fusion... No special
programmes to establish cold fusion
research centres... are justified".
One year after the original press
conference at the University of Utah,
cold fusion still refused to lie down
and die. The new National Cold Fu¬
sion Center in Utah held its first an¬
nual conference and dozens of
papers were presented in support of
the phenomenon. Many reputable
research groups around the world
were still claiming to have detected
one or more of the key signs of cold
fusion. But just one week before the
conference, Nature published a paper
by scientists from the University of
Utah who monitored Fleischmann
and Pons' own electrochemical cells
for five weeks and found no trace of
any unusual nuclear radiation.
The negative paper ¡n Nature has
in some sense polarized the debate.
Some see it as the final nail in the
coffin of cold fusion, while believers
see it as strong evidence that a
strange, unknown type of fusion is
occurring since the production of
heat in the cells cannot be denied. It
seems possible that an interesting
phenomenon is at work, just not the
kind that will solve all the world's
problems.
It could be said of the events sur¬
rounding cold fusion that the scien¬
tific establishment seemed actively to
try to discredit the breakthrough just
because it was so revolutionary. But
the success of the recently discovered
high-temperature superconductors
shows that revolutionary science can
gain recognition. It has also been said
that the cold fusion story gave the
outside world a glimpse of how the
world of science works. In reality, it
gave a very distorted ¡mage of
science: science under extreme stress,
trying to come to terms with some¬
thing that is new and unexplained.
What the world did see was an ex¬
ample of science that was not some
form of miracle cure, nor an ominous
threat to humankind. It was simply
wrong, and with that somehow more
human.
