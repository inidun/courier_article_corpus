Cardiovascular
diseases
30
Cardiovascular diseases are major
killers in highly developed countries.
In 1967, a WHO study of 23 industrializ¬
ed countries showed heart diseases
as the leading cause of death; heart
diseases and "strokes" were res¬
ponsible for more than 45 per cent of
all deaths. With the rise of the stan¬
dard of living, developing countries
may soon be confronted with similar
problems.
Some cardiovascular diseases are
found everywhere, others only in cer¬
tain geographic areas or among iden¬
tifiable groups of people. Comparative
studies are under way in Jamaica, in
the Polynesian islands, in Peru, among
people living at high altitudes, and
elsewhere.
WHO also studies spontaneously
occurring conditions in animals com¬
parable to cardiovascular diseases in
humans. Certain primates are excel¬
lent models for human atherosclerosis
of the aorta and coronary vessels while
some birds develop lesions similar to
those in humans.
Cancer
According to WHO, the number of
deaths from cancer throughout the
world increased from 2,175,000 in
1950-62 to 2,623,000 in 1958-60
an increase of some 20 per cent.
Cancer is the second leading cause
of death after cardiovascular diseases
in highly developed countries. The
number of persons now living who have
cancer (before, during and after treat¬
ment) is over 5 million. For every new
case of cancer found in mass screen¬
ing programmes, there are 3 to 4 cases
with a pre-cancerous condition.
In an attempt to find causes, WHO
initiates comparative studies; for
example, to discover why Norway and
Finland, alike in so many ways, differ
greatly in the incidence of lung cancer.
WHO created the International Agency
for Research on Cancer in Lyons,
France, in 1965, which is particularly
concerned with the causes and epi¬
demiology of cancer. In addition, WHO
established a world-wide network of
international reference centres for
classifying and studying tumours.
Mental
health
Mental illness rates rise as man goes
to live in the city. Suicide is among
the first ten causes of death in many
countries and the rates for attempted
suicide are increasing. A survey of
85 countries revealed a critical short¬
age of psychiatrists. Eight had none
at all and in another 35, with a total
population of 890 million, there was
less than one to 200,000 people.
There is also an alarming increase
in alcoholism and drug abuse involv¬
ing depressants, stimulants and hal¬
lucinogens such as LSD. The trend is
toward a combined approach to the
problems of dependence on alcohol
and other drugs; a WHO Expert Com
mittee pointed out the similar ties in
cause and treatment as well as the
frequent transfer from one drug to
another.
Venereal
disease
This is on the rise and has reached
post-World War II levels in some coun¬
tries. There are about 60-65 million
new cases of gonococcal infection each
year. Syphilis is also increasing and
a careful U.S. survey discovered that
only about 11.3 per cent of cases of
infectious syphilis were reported.
WHO has provided direct assistance
to strengthen VD control in 40 coun¬
tries, granted training fellowships and
research grants. In 1966 reference
strains of gonococci were distributed
to national laboratories from the newly-
established WHO Reference Centre for
Gonococci in Copenhagen.
International
quarantine
Of the six quarantinable diseases,
two, typhus and relapsing fever, seem
to present no longer any international
danger and may soon be dropped
from the list of diseases subject to
quarantine. The situation for the four
others is:
Plague, after declining in the late
fifties, is on the upswing; the Repub¬
lic of Viet-Nam is the hardest hit
with 4,532 suspected cases reported
in 1967. No vaccine has yet been
developed as an effective preventive
measure. The plague does not seem
to be spreading internationally, but
vigilance is necessary.
Yellow fever still
occurs in tropical
Africa and America;
an outbreak in
Ethiopia caused over

3,000 deaths in 1961. Yet yellow
fever vaccine affords complete pro¬
tection.
Smallpox seems to be rising again.
Here again proper vaccination is effec¬
tive and WHO is tightening up the
regulations. The International Certifi¬
cate of Vaccination against smallpox
now requires vaccine up to WHO
standards and the origin and batch
number of vaccine used; a doctor's
signature is also needed.
Cholera is on the march and in Asia
it has been reported from the Philip¬
pines in the East to Iran and Iraq in
the West. Vaccines are only partially
effective.
International
sanitary
regulations
WHO constantly reviews the Inter¬
national Sanitary Regulations in an
attempt to keep them abreast of world
conditions. The new health regulations
for international trade and travel will
go into effect, if approved by the World
Health Assembly, as of May 1968.
They will extend medical health ser¬
vices not only in international ports
and airports but inland wherever large
movements of population occur. The
object remains to speed trade and tra¬
vel while safeguarding health.
Tuberculosis
Some 15 million people still suffer
from active tuberculosis and may infect
some 50 million children and adoles¬
cents. More than three-quarters of
these cases are In developing coun¬
tries. Each year two or three million
new cases appear and between one
and two million people die of this
disease. Yet the past 20 years have
seen a quiet revolution in dealing with
this disease. New knowledge has led
to new techniques which now offer
hope to poorer countries fighting tu¬
berculosis.
Each effective immunization with
BCG costs as little as 10 to 20 cents.
The discovery of INH (isoniazid)
allowed a major change in treatment.
Today, patients can leave hospitals
and by taking this medicine return to
a more normal life in the community.
A WHO Expert Committee stressed
new techniques which through com¬
plete immunization and ambulatory
chemotherapy could reduce tuberculo¬
sis to a minor public health problem
within the next two or three decades.
Malaria
Malaria is on the retreat: 1,304 mil¬
lion or 78 per cent of the people liv¬
ing in originally malarious areas are
now protected from the disease. Ma¬
laria has been eradicated from very
large parts of the Americas and all
of continental Europe. By 1967, 90
per cent of India's population was liv¬
ing in areas freed from the transmis¬
sion of malaria. Yet trouble areas
remain.
Malaria is still the major health
problem in Africa south of the Sahara;
more than half the children under
three and virtually all of the population
over that age is affected.
There have been setbacks and re-
introduction of malaria in various re¬
gions. Resistance to DDT has been
observed In mosquitoes. Some prog¬
rammes have slowed down or stopped
for lack of funds. Yet success must
be total since even one case can
start the cycle of re-infection again.
Increasing productivity and decreas¬
ing the amount spent on medicine and
lost through illness may prove to be
the best investment the world com¬
munity has made.
Quinine for malaria used to cost
Greece $1,300,000 a year; fighting
disease with DDT in the 1950s only
$300,000. Results: since 1960 no
deaths have been reported, land has
been reclaimed, labour is more produc¬
tive and the rate of malaria has
dropped to zero.
Since 1955, WHO has embarked on
the first disease eradication venture
¡a history and man's largest public
health project world-wide malaria
eradication. Regardless of how 'long
it takes, WHO goes ahead with its
world-wide programme for eliminating
malaria.
Smallpox
Smallpox can be eliminated: Yet up
to 100,000 cases are still reported
annually. Seventy per cent of the
world's cases reported in 1966
occurred in South-East Asia and the
disease remains endemic in all coun¬
tries in Africa south of the Sahara and
many other countries.
Three areas remain free of small¬
pox Europe, North and Central Ame¬
rica and the Western Pacific.
Individually, in co-operation with
others, and now under a world-wide
programme launched by WHO in 1967,
nations are fighting smallpox and they
are pushing it back. Burma, for exam¬
ple, began eradication in 1962 and by
1966 did not have a single case to
report. India and Pakistan have mass
campaigns well under way already
producing results.
Jet injectors, pistol-like machines
which project vaccine at high pres¬
sure, already in use in Africa and
Brazil, allow up to 1,000 vaccinations
in an hour. WHO has set up an emer¬
gency stock of vaccine and jet injec¬
tors in Geneva which can be flown in
a few days to any disease-free area
menaced by the re-introduction of
smallpox.
Smallpox-free countries are helping
with gifts of vaccine, particularly the
U.SA and the U.S.S.R., but 1,100 mil¬
lion people run the risk of smallpox
and about 2,000 million vaccinations
and revaccinatiohs are needed for the
ten-year period.
Polio
and measles
Although poliomyelitis has practi¬
cally disappeared from one half of the
world in 16 countries in Europe with
good immunization campaigns the
average annual incidence of polyomye- Q1
litis from 1961-64 dropped by about 01
99 per cent it may be increasing in
the other half as environmental con-

ditions in the developing countries
change. The use of vaccines in such
countries has brought to light problems
of organization and also of the effec¬
tiveness of vaccine which have not
been solved. Polio vaccine seems
to be less potent under tropical con¬
ditions.
Measles vaccine, though effective,
costs too much for most of the coun¬
tries where measles still represents
an important cause of death in child¬
hood.
WHO has been actively associated
witn the development and testing of
poliomyelitis and measles vaccines,
two of the most effective immunizing
agents yet produced. More work will
be necessary to adapt them to the
difficult climatic and economic con¬
ditions that affect more than half of
the world's population.
Leprosy
About 11 million
cases in the world
yet the number or
registered patients
is only a little more
than 2.8 million and
of these about
1.9 million receive
treatment. Almost
four million people are disabled by the
disease.
Water, basic to life
Contaminated water spreads many
diseases, directly and indirectly through
breeding insect-carriers. Typhoid,
cholera, amoebic and bacillary dysen¬
tery are some of the illnesses trans¬
mitted by dirty water.
In the developing countries infectious
and parasitic diseases rank as the
principle cause of death. Chief among
them are diseases of the gastro-intes¬
tinal tract which account for a majority
of diagnosed deaths in most of the
17 countries studied by WHO in Africa,
South and Central America and Asia.
It is estimated that one out of four
hospital beds in the world may be
occupied by someone suffering from
such water and filth-borne diseases;
they are also one of the chief killers
of infants and children in developing
countries.
WHO is the executing agency for a
number of United Nations Development
Programme Special Fund projects
which draw up engineering and feasibi¬
lity reports covering sewerage and
ratepaying as well as water supply; the
plans for Accra-Tema in Ghana, where
a rapidly growing urban and industrial
area of 500,000 inhabitants is expected
to reach 1.5 million by 1980, are a good
example. Work is also going ahead
on master plans for Calcutta, Istanbul,
Kampala and Malta; in 1967, there
were 207 WHO-assisted projects in
83 countries.
If only clean water could be supplied
to everyone, diseases which kill and
sicken millions could be eliminated
without medicine, without mass cam¬
paigns or wonder drugs.
Parasitic
diseases
An estimated 200 million people are
affected by shistosomiasis (bilharzia-
sis), 190 million with filariasis (which
may cause elephantiasis), 450 million
with hookworm, 50 million with oncho¬
cerciasis (river blindness) and seven
million with Chaga's disease (a form
of sleeping sickness confined to the
Americas).
Trypanosomi¬
asis (African sleeping
sickness) makes
agriculture and
stock-raising impos¬
sible over more than
ten million square
kilometres of fertile
land in Africa.
WHO tries to apply the most modern
medical and scientific findings to
control parasitic diseases and prevent
their spread. Unfortunately, labora¬
tory and field research is hampered by
the scarcity of trained national staff.
Therefore, their training in the use of
effective new techniques is receiving
high priority.
Trachoma
The world's most
common cause of
blindness affects as
many as 400 million
people.
On guard
against pollution
WHO is helping to establish world¬
wide networks to monitor air pollution
and to check the levels of radioactivity
to which populations are exposed;
longterm effects of low doses of radio¬
activity are also being studied. Water
pollution is another major source of
concern and activity.
Children
in peril
In developing countries Infant mor¬
tality may be ten times higher than that
in advanced countries; rates for mor¬
tality may be ten times higher than that
may be thirty to forty times higher.
