Shaking 
the ivory tower
Universities have changed radically to keep pace with modern life.
Now where are they heading in this high-speed age?
In the past half century higher education has
been transformed from a privilege conferred on
social and political elites to a mass activity ava i-
lable to whole populat i o n s.This process began in the
United States in the 1940s and 1950s, spread to
most of We s t e rn Europe and many other deve l o p e d
c o u n t ries during the 1960s and 1970s and in the
past two decades has become a global phenome-
non.In the next half century it will accelerate,lea-
ding perhaps to the replacement of “higher educa-
t i o n ”(still an elite-ish cat e g o ry despite its expansion)
by extended systems of “lifelong learning”.
The key to this transform ation has been the expan-
sion of secondary educat i o n .For example, in all bu t
t wo countries of the OECD (Organization for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development) at least two -
thirds of young people now complete upper secondary
e d u c at i o n , and so are eligible to enter higher educa-
t i o n .The result has been a dramatic increase in enrol-
ment rates in higher educat i o n . In Chile the total
number of students has gr own from 131,000 in 1978
to 235,000 in 1988 and to 343,000 in the mid-1990s.
E ven in the United Stat e s , the pioneer of mass-access
higher education where ve ry high secondary educa-
tion completion rates had already been achieve d
before 1970, the student population has continued to
gr ow, from 11 million in 1978 to 13 million in 1988
and now to more than 14 million.
Two forces have dri ven up completion rates in
upper secondary education and enrolment rates in
higher educat i o n .The first has been democrat i z at i o n .
As late as 1945 high levels of social, and hence edu-
c at i o n a l , inequality persisted even in democratic coun-
t ri e s , and much of the world remained in the grip of
colonial and totalitarian powe rs. In North A m e ri c a ,
We s t e rn Europe and Australasia democrat i z ation typi-
cally took the form of the development of “ we l fa r e
s t at e s ” , in which there was an increase in public expen-
diture on educat i o n ,h o u s i n g,health and social secu-
rity that was sustained over more than three decades
after the end of the Second World Wa r.
More recently, as renewed emphasis has been
placed on the market even in social policy, the rise of
c o n s u m e rism has continued to fuel demands for
increased higher education opport u n i t i e s.The older
idea of education as a civic entitlement has been com-
pounded by newer notions of free access to the edu-
c ation marketplace.Far from arresting the advance to
mass higher educat i o n ,c o n s u m e rism has accelerat e d
it in most developed countri e s.As traditional form s
of social differentiation based on class,gender and eth-
nic ori gin have been eroded by democrat i z ation and
by market forces, new forms based on educat i o n a l
c e rt i fic ation have become more import a n t . In many
d e veloped countries the middle class and the “ gr a-
d u ate class” h ave tended to coalesce.
In much of Asia and A f rica democrat i z ation took
the form of decolonizat i o n . In newly independent
c o u n t ries the energy ori ginally generated in libera-
tion struggles against the colonial powe rs was direc-
ted into a wider struggle to create fairer and more
equal successor societies. E d u c ation was central to
this stru g g l e .The result has been a rapid increase in
higher education enrolment–for example, in Tu n i s i a
from barely 2,000 students at the time of indepen-
dence to more than 100,000 today.T h at process conti-
n u e s.
H owe ve r , the relationship between democrat i z a-
tion and the development of higher education has
been less straightforward in developing countri e s.
Despite ve ry rapid rates of expansion the “ m e t r o p o-
l i t a n ”i n fluences of the former colonial powe rs have
lingered more stubbornly in higher education than at
other levels of educat i o n .This is partly due to the
continued influence of associations between unive r-
sities in the British Commonwealth as well as those
b e t ween francophone unive rs i t i e s.
Pa rtly because of these lingering “ m e t r o p o l i-
tan”models and partly because levels of participa-
tion are still lower than in developed countri e s ,m a ny
African or Asian universities have remained more
elite institutions than higher education institutions
in North America and Europe. Also, as economic
conditions have wo rsened in some developing coun-
tries,the competition between primary and higher
e d u c ation sharpened in the post-independence ye a rs
as both were seen as equally important priorities.
This competition was often reinforced by the inter-
vention of the World Bank.
The second force driving up higher education
enrolments has been the changing nature of the
labour market.Traditional occupations have become
c o m p a r at i vely less signific a n t , while new serv i c e
o c c u p at i o n s , which often require gr a d u at e - l e ve l

skills,have become more important.
Skill requirements have become more sophisti-
cated. Jobs once done by unskilled or semi-skilled
wo r k e rs are now undertaken by technicians; a n d
those which as recently as the 1980s were taken by
technicians are now likely to be filled by graduates.
The capital invested for eve ry worker has more than
doubled in the past 20 years. Even in occupations
where there is less evidence that skills contents have
changed signific a n t l y, u n i ve rsity gr a d u ates are now
e m p l oyed in much larger numbers ,p a rtly to enhance
the social status of these occupations and partly to
compete in a graduate-dominated labour market.
Healthcare is a good example. Once doctors were the
only graduates;today, many para-medical workers
are also trained in higher education.
The second form taken by the economic driver
has been the growing conviction that national suc-
cess now depends on economic competitive n e s s
w h i c h , in the context of a knowledge-based eco-
n o my, depends in turn on an adequate supply of
human capital. Knowledge is now seen as the key
economic resource.
This analysis may be exaggerat e d ;r aw mat e ri a l s
are still ve ry important in national economies and the
global economy. But it has become pervasive–and
persuasive.The naïve and linear theories of human
capital popular a generation ago which postulated a
direct link between investment in education and
economic growth may have been challenged;some
f o rms of higher education are now as likely to be
labelled consumption as investment goods. Never-
t h e l e s s , the discourse of the “ K n owledge Society”h a s
become even more powerful.
The impact of democratization and economic
c o m p e t i t i veness on higher education has been
immense.First,the expansion of student numbers
has made the cost of higher education a significant
element within national budgets for the first time.A
number of important consequences has flowed from
this–the opport u n i t y, and incentive , to compare the
value of investing in different levels of educat i o n ;
increasing demands that unive rsities are run as effi-
ciently as possible (compromising their traditional
a u t o n o my from the state–and the market); l owe r
unit costs as budgets have been trimmed (which
may have undermined higher education’s claim to
represent academic excellence). S e c o n d ,higher edu-
c ation systems have emerged that embrace not only
traditional universities but also non-university ins-
t i t u t i o n s.Two effects have been produced. One is that
the ethos of the traditional university has been ero-
ded; it no longer stands in glorious isolation.The
other is that institutional differentiation has been
e n c o u r a g e d , whether through active state planning
or in response to markets for teaching and research.
The prospects for the next half century are for an
a c c e l e r ation of both dri ve rs–to include access to higher
e d u c ation among the basic entitlements enjoyed by citi-
zens in democratic societies;and to “put knowledge to
wo r k ”in order to generate wealth and to improve the
quality of life.The prospects for higher educat i o n
d u ring the same period are also relat i vely easy to pre-
dict–increased efficiency (which is likely to include
gr owing pressure to make students contri bute more to
the cost of their higher educat i o n ) ; gr e ater accounta-

b i l i t y, although more probably in a “ m a r k e t ” than a
“ p l a n n i n g ”mode as even the state redefines its role as
the purchaser of higher education serv i c e s ; more dif-
f e r e n t i at i o n , both between and within higher educa-
tion institutions, as they struggle to identify market
n i c h e s ; a n d – p o s s i b l y – gr owing demands that higher
e d u c ation become more relevant as instru m e n t a l
c o n s i d e r ations triumph over idealistic ones.
H owe ve r ,the future may be more complex than the
p a s t . In the second half of the 20th century the encoun-
ter between higher education and society has been
c o m p a r at i vely straightforwa r d . Although dynamic,
society has presented a familiar enough fa c e . It was cha-
r a c t e rized by a combination of bu r e a u c r atic rat i o n a-
lity and secular (and liberal) individualism.The bene-
ficence of science and technology was uncontested.T h e
dominant economic model was of large-scale indus-
t ry, or analogous organizations in the corp o r ate and
public sectors. Although rapidly evo l v i n g, c o n c e p t s
and cat e g o ries like “ c a r e e r ” and “ p r o f e s s i o n ”r e m a i-
ned va l i d .Higher education too was familiar enough.
Despite the gr e at expansion of student numbers and
its adoption of novel roles, the unive rsity continued to
be recognizable as such. Other types of higher edu-
c ation institution have been deeply influenced by uni-
ve rsity values and practices.
In the first half of the 21st century both society
and higher education may become problemat i c a l
and so contested categories. Some of these uncer-
tainties are already emerging.Once firm demarca-
tions between public and pri vate domains, w h e t h e r
in terms of the balance between the state and the
market or between social “spaces” and individual
d e s i r e s ; b e t ween producers and users ; b e t we e n
i nvestment and consumption; b e t ween work and
leisure are becoming increasingly fuzzy in the emer-
ging post-industrial society.Wealth is being generat e d
by the production of “ s y m b o l i c ” as well as–or more
t h a n – m at e rial goods. Value is created by design,
s a l e s ,m a r k e t i n g, s e rvice rather than by pri m a ry pro-
d u c t i o n . Institutions of all kinds, civic and corp o r at e ,
are being challenged by the rise of adaptable and
flexible organizat i o n s ,made possible by advances in
communications and information technology.
The force of globalization amounts to much
more than round-the-clock round-the-world fin a n-
cial markets or an emerging intern ational division of
l a b o u r; it is not only undermining nation states bu t
also reconfig u ring time and space to produce global
intimacies, again with the help of the information
r e vo l u t i o n . Social identities are no longer moulded
by the “givens”of religion, class and gender,or by
positions within the occupational stru c t u r e , as they
have been since the advent of the industrial revolu-
tion in Europe two centuries ago. Instead they are
being subsumed by a process of individualizat i o n
in which life-styles rather than life-chances predo-
minate.
The superi o rity of science is now being underm i-
ned by the gr owth of what the German sociologi s t
U l rich Beck has called the “ risk society”, in which
ri s k s , especially environmental threat s , seem to be
a c c u m u l ating faster than the benefits produced by
social improvements and technological adva n c e s.T h e
i n s t rumental rationality on which We s t e rn notions of
m o d e rn i z ation depend is being challenged by what
B e c k ’s French colleague Alain Touraine has term e d
“new modern i t y ” in which Reason and Subject are
recombined in the form of new social move m e n t s.
Higher education will have not only to continue to
s atisfy the predictable demands for democratic entit-
lement and socio-economic utility with which it is
fa m i l i a r , but also to cope with the consequences of
these new uncert a i n t i e s.These may include:new cur-
ricula that emphasize style and images at the expense
of skills and inform at i o n ; r e c at e g o ri z ation of higher
e d u c ation as a play f u l ,e ven selfis h ,a c t i v i t y ; a tighter
link between experience of higher education and social
e s t e e m ; submergence of the unive rs a l ,but also part i-
c u l a r ,values characteristic of the traditional unive rs i t y
by anomic globalizat i o n ;t h r e ats to the scientific tra-
dition and methods, from the “ risk society”, from sub-
j e c t i v i z ation and from demands that other know l e d g e
traditions are accorded equal respect.
The universities of the 21st century, therefore,
may have to face two ways.They will have to conti-
nue to pay attention to the democrat i z ation and the
“ k n owledge society”a g e n d a s , which are likely both
to be subsumed in a larger “lifelong learn i n g ”
a g e n d a . Their ability to sustain current levels of
public funding and to satisfy their student-custo-
mers will depend on their success in this respect.It
will not be easy.There is a danger that the essence
of higher education will be lost if it succumbs to
unconstrained populism. If this happens, the “ q u a-
l i t y ” of the unive rsity will disappear–and with it per-
haps its distinctiveness and so its utility and mar-
k e t a b i l i t y. Similarly in the Knowledge Society of the
future the unive rsity will face new ri vals because all
organizations will need to become “learning orga-
n i z at i o n s ” .These ri va l s ’ strength will be increased if
the superiority of universal science is successfully
challenged.
But unive rsities will also have to address the new
agendas–of the “ d e at h ” of work (and gr a d u at e
c a r e e rs ? ) , of new social movements (and the erosion
of individual enlightenment?), of globalization and
v i rt u a l i z ation (and the undermining of academic com-
m u n i t y ? ) ; of “ a l t e rn at i ve ”k n owledge traditions and,
