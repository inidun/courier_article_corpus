Is the Internet really the democratic force it is made out to be?
For much of the 1990s journalists have tended
towards Mark Twain’s wry observation, “I’m
all for progr e s s ,i t ’s change I don’t like.” But the
rapid development of the Internet has forced
changes,like it or not,in newsroom behaviour.
While some changes are breathing new life into
n e w s g at h e ri n g, o t h e rs are less we l c o m e .L o n g - s t a n-
ding notions of accountable, reliable and quality
j o u rnalism are under intolerable pressure in the
hothouse atmosphere of global competition.T h e r e
is little evidence yet that the long-heralded empo-
we rment of users is going to alter the balance of
power in favour of consumers.
Many celebrate the Internet as the vanguard in
the dawning of the new media age, offering inter-
a c t i v i t y, the end of inform ation scarcity and ins-
t a n t ,i n e x p e n s i ve , global communicat i o n .There are
of course great advantages.
Thousands of the nearly four million web sites
now in existence have been developed by traditio-
nal media. Traditional media organizations have
t u rned to the web to establish inform at i o n - ri c h
intranets for internal office use—many of them with
access to collections of public records or back-
ground information on timely subjects.
Pe rsonal computers and digital editors enable
r e p o rt e rs to digest and revise data on spreadsheets, t o
m a n i p u l ate images, to edit sound and image for
b r o a d c a s t , to insert , c u t , a d d , and to check out
i n f o rm ation with virtual librari e s ,public records dat a-
bases and numerous online ency c l o p e d i a .L a b o ri o u s
ve ri fic ation of the past can be done in seconds.
Huge databanks enable rapid and solid
r e s e a r c h .At the same time networks for global soli-
darity ensure that dissidents in China are not for-
g o t t e n , opposition radio in Belgrade stays on the
air in the face of Serbian censors h i p, and thousands
of protesters are mobilized to embarrass the
bureaucrats of the global economy in Seattle.
But there is a dark side of the inform ation revo-
l u t i o n . Much of the inform ation available on the
I n t e rnet is dull, unreliable and tri v i a l .The reality of
using the Worldwide Web for millions is endless
waiting, unintended disconnection,an abundance
of unwanted inform ation and high telephone
c h a r g e s. Discussion gr o u p s , much admired for pro-
viding access to information and diverse opinions,
are in reality hotbeds of rumour and gossip where
c o nve rs ation about issues can swiftly degenerat e
into rude, offensive and tasteless discourse. Tech-
nical questions often elicit inaccurate answers.
Jo u rnalists have to be on their guard in the ru s h
to meet deadlines not to absorb the unsavo u ry pre-
judices of crackpots or be taken in by the bogus
information that swills around the Internet.
At the same time,the radical edge of the Inter-
net is in danger of being blunted by the restructu-
ring of the wider information and communication

i n d u s t ry. Increasing deregulation of the inform a-
tion market and the gr owth of global media corp o-
r ations add to a widespread sense of unease over the
suffocating spread of advertising and sponsorship
across the Internet.
Although there are new online news serv i c e s ,
traditional press agencies and mainstream media
leaders—CNN,the BBC,and every major quality
newspaper on the planet—are already established as
key inform ation prov i d e rs. The advantage of low
production and distribution does open the door to
a l t e rn at i ve inform ation serv i c e s , but the Intern e t
increasingly is becoming the domain of media
brand names that are linked to the major playe rs of
the global media market.An unprecedented wave of
m e r g e rs and acquisitions among global media
giants has created ten colossal ve rtically integr at e d
media conglomerates. Six of them—News Corpo-
r at i o n ,Time Wa rn e r ,D i s n e y, B e rt e l s m a n n ,V i a c o m
and TCI—are already able to mix and match a full
range of media serv i c e s , including Internet outlets.
Media conglomeration and commercialism in
media content are driving down standards of jour-
nalism and reducing the range of ideological and
cultural output. Some eminent personages from
within the media world itself complain that media
are increasingly self-serv i n g, v u l g a r , biased and
m a l i c i o u s. N e w s p a p e rs and television are ever more
profit-centred, while journalism is intrusive, inac-
curate and shallow with the dramatization of half-
truths and the promulgation of information from
unidentified sources.
These criticisms were particularly pertinent to
media coverage of the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky
saga where, according one British media cri t i c
“press excitement was too intense for ordinary pro-
fessional standards to preva i l .”1 I r o n i c a l l y, it wa s
this story that provided the first clear evidence of
the Internet’s arrival on the world news scene.The
dramatic online publication of the Kenneth Starr
r e p o rt on President Clinton’s relationship with
Lewinsky wa s , according to United States media
critic Jon Katz,the event that “ratified the Internet
as A m e ri c a ’s premiere means of rapidly dissemina-
ting critical civic information”.2
It certainly generated interest. This 120,000-
word text file was seen by almost 28 million people
in the first two days it was online—gr e ater than the
combined circulation of A m e ri c a ’s top 50 daily
newspapers.
Although Starr proved that the Internet is a
perfect place for breaking news, the event also
u n d e rscored just how important journalism is to the
process of understanding the world around us.W h i l e
millions of surfers had direct access to the Starr
r e p o rt in its tedious entirety, old style media scored
highly by making sense of it. N e w s p a p e rs and tele-
vision ratings soared.
People will always turn to a professional filter to
make sense of massive amounts of raw dat a . B u t
they also appreciate depth in reporting to better
understand what is going on. Too often, however,
m o d e rn news organizations gi ve themselves no time
for inquiry beyond trite and superficial reporting
and analysis.
Sound-bite journalism
In the age of instant news, j o u rnalists are urged
to compress complex and difficult issues into sound
bites. There is no room for detailed research and
b a c k ground report i n g . News organizations are not
in the business of taking risks as they compete
f u riously for market share in the burgeoning media
m a r k e t . Cuts in editorial bu d g e t s , p a rticularly in
the field of inve s t i g at i ve journ a l i s m , m ay explain
w hy so much low-quality reporting finds its way
into media both on and offline.
N e ve rt h e l e s s , the values of editing, of profes-
sionalism and ethical journalism remain the quality
benchmarks for media. But these standards are not
enforced in the online wo r l d .While complaints rage
around the heads of traditional editors , online jour-
nalism is largely unchallenged. In most countries
media content is regulated through transparent
s t ru c t u r e s , often administered by media themselve s.
M a ny people are sceptical about the effectiveness of
Press Councils and broadcasting authori t i e s , bu t
e ven these watchdog bodies are missing in the
online world.
It is clear that the differences between new
i n f o rm ation services and traditional media are
disappearing at a rapid rate. But some journalists
remain unconvinced that the creation of a new
media landscape will succeed in creating better
u n d e rstanding or widening the democratic process.
That will only happen if the traditional mission of
j o u rnalism and media to serve wider public and
democratic interests is restored as the central and
p ri m a ry goal of communication and inform at i o n
policy.
Absurd early predictions of the imminent deat h
of traditional journalism have given way to a reali-
z ation that people suffering from inform ation ove r-
load and drowning in information are starving for
the truth.As much as ever the public needs skilled
news gatherers to sort through the confusion and
chaos of the inform ation society, to put inform at i o n
in context and to present it in digestible chunks.
S o, the future of journalism should be secure.A f t e r
all,software robots will never overtake the work of
journalists.Technology can do many things,but it
cannot yet seek out and then elegantly speak the
t ru t h .Technology is only a tool and it should not be
confused with talent. ■
