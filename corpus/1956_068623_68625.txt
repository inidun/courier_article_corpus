The sleep that kills
by J. Ford

miasis Research and Reclamation Organization
From the southern edge of the Sa¬
hara Desert to Zululand in the
Union of South Africa the peo¬
ples of tropical Africa are afflicted by
a number of diseases carried by
tsetse flies (Glossina).
These insects infest -about four and
a half million square miles of land.
In much of this vast area (half as
great again as that of Australia)
their bite may infect man with a mi¬
nute protozoan organism, a trypano-
some, which produces the fatal sleep¬
ing sickness. Over all of it tsetse
flies transmit other trypanosomes
which are fatal to cattle and other
domestic animals.
This means that the African, even
if he is fortunate enough to live in
an area free of sleeping sickness, may
be deprived of much needed animal
protein in his diet, while his agricul¬
tural activities suffer both from lack
of fertilizing manure and of draught
animals.
Further, there is, naturally, a ten¬
dency for the human population, with
its cattle, to crowd into the relatively
small areas which are free of tsetse
fly. The result is that the land is
overworked and over-stocked and
suffers accordingly.
In short, the tsetse fly, through the
diseases it transmits, affects directly
or indirectly, the whole economy of
tropical Africa and there can be no
doubt that the poor situation of the
African can be attributed very large¬
ly to this terrible scourge.
There are twenty-three known
species of tsetse fly, some living in the
rain forest, some in the vegetation
fringing laikes and rivers, others in
the woodlands and bush of drier

of this dreaded disease. (1) In the second
stage of the disease the sick man becomes
weak, anaemic and more and more emacia¬
ted. He begins to sink into a coma which
becomes so deep that he dies of exhaustion
and starvation. (2) Villagers wait to be
weighed and vaccinated. (3) A young
mother and her baby are given injections of
lomidine. (4) An entomologist classifies
and counts pupae of tsetse flies brought

with tsetse flies. The flies feed off the
guinea pigs until they are needed for dis¬
section and analysis.

areas, but all requiring the shade of
trees or bush to survive.
They vary in size from that of a
large blue-bottle to about that of a
common house fly and all feed only
upon the blood of animals.
Many of these animals, the wild
game of Africa, carry in their blood
the parasitic trypanosomes which to
them are harmless. When the tsetse
fly feeds it may suck up these try¬
panosomes, which develop in it so
that it becomes itself infected and
infective.
In the normal course of events it
is likely to feed again only on wild
animals and no harm is done, but to
man or to cattle its bite may bring
death.
Just as there are several kinds of
tsetse fly, so there are several kinds
of trypanosome.
Two species cause sleeping sickness
in man. In West Africa, the Congo
and as far East as Lake Victoria the
disease is generally in the form
known as Gambian Sleeping Sickness.
It is transmitted by tsetse flies living
along rivers so that dangerous foci
tend to develop where the people go
to draw water or to bathe.
Although these riverine tsetse may
feed very largely on reptiles, there is
much evidence that man himself is
often the only host of the trypano¬
some of Gambian Sleeping Sickness.
In the afflicted territories millions
of people are subject to the risk of
this disease and in the past there
have been appalling epidemics, for
example, in Uganda between 1896 and
1906 when it was estimated that
200,000 people died.
The other form of the human, dis¬
ease, Rhodesian Sleeping Sickness,
is largely confined to East and Cen¬
tral Africa.
Here there is much evidence sug¬
gesting that the wild game form an
important reservoir of the disease
which is largely carried by a tsetse
infesting vast areas of dry woodland
and not confined to rivers. The Rho¬
desian Disease is more acute than the
Gambian and, untreated, kills much
more quickly.
Some twenty-five years ago a drug
(Bayer 205 or Antrypol) was produc¬
ed in Germany which could cure the
early stages of both diseases and
somewhat later the Americans discov¬
ered another drug (Tryparsamide) ef¬
fective in more advanced cases of the
Gambian disease.
During the war other drugs (diami-
dines, especially pentamidine) were
developed in the United Kingdom
which not only provided a useful cure

in the early stages, but also showed
marked prophylactic effects against
the Gambian disease.
But it is only very recently that yet
another group of drugs has been pro¬
duced which offers hope to sufferers
in the later stages of Rhodesian
Sleeping Sickness.
Because in Western Africa the
tsetse carrying sleeping sickness come
much into contact with the human
population, the human problem re¬
ceives more emphasis than the prob¬
lem of cattle trypanosomiasis.
Mass diagnosis
The French, Belgian and British
Governments of the West Afri¬
can territories maintain large
sleeping sickness services, which,
increasingly during the last few
years, have succeeded in reducing the
incidence of the disease to very low
. levels.
Something of the scale of their
operations may be judged by noting
that in French West Africa some
four-and-a-half million people are
examined annually. In Nigeria, of
four million people examined between
1931 and 1943, 11 % were infected.
This "mass diagnosis" and treat¬
ment of infected cases resulted in a
marked decline in the infection rate
which in 1950 was only 0.37% in over
800,000 people examined.
The East and Central African areas
infested with Rhodesian Sleeping
Sickness present a different kind of
problem.
Partly because the disease is more
acute and so more dangerous, partly
because most of the area involved is
not, in any case, suited to dense
settlement, far fewer people are in
danger of infection.
The practice, therefore, is either to
remove people entirely out of the
tsetse-fly belts, or, where this is im¬
practicable, to gather them into
"sleeping sickness settlements" in
which, by combined efforts in agri¬
culture they can create islands of
land in which, because the trees have
been cut down, the tsetse cannot live.
Vast empty spaces
Bad though the effects of sleeping
sickness may be, it is possible
that if we could fully understand
the whole situation created by the
presence of tsetse flies, we might
well conclude that cattle trypanoso¬
miasis is an even greater hindrance
to African welfare and development.
Undernourishment and deficiency
diseases are now recognized to pro¬
vide perhaps the greatest barriers to
African progress and these might
well be overcome if the vast areas
now denied to cattle by the tsetse
could be reclaimed.
Up to about 1945 there were only
two basic methods of eliminating
tsetse flies, although there were a
variety of ways in which they could
be applied. These were either to kill
off the wild game animals which pro¬
vide the tsetse fly with its food or to
cut down the forests and woodlands
which provide its home.
In recent years, however, first DDT
and later other insecticides have
added a very valuable weapon against
the tsetse fly, but the battlefield is
vast and progress is slow.
A great deal of research into the
problem has been and is being done,
largely at the expense of the metro¬
politan governments administering
tropical Africa and there are only
one or two insects such as the mal¬
aria carrying mosquitoes, about which
more is known than about the tsetse.
Why, with so much knowledge, can
we not go faster?
The reasons these methods are not,
and cannot be, applied rapidly are
two. First, the vast size of the areas
involved, areas sometimes of 100,000
square miles or more, prevents them
being tackled as single units.
The second reason is that unless an
area so reclaimed can be occupied by-
forms of land utilization which per¬
manently make them unfit for the
tsetse flies to live in, these insects will
invade once more from other areas.
Research is directed towards the
prevention of disease in man and
stock and the reduction of cost of
reclamation of land from the tsetse
fly.
But the end lies with the African
himselfby using intelligently and
vigorously the new knowledge that is
being given to him, to occupy pro¬
ductively Africa's vast empty spaces.
LIVINGSTONE GAVE HIM
THE MISSING CLUE
ON one of his journeys into Cen¬
tral Africa, David Livingstone ar¬
rived one day in 1857 at the
confluence of the river Tamunak'le.
There he came up against a barrier he
could not cross. "We were informed,"
he wrote, '"that the fly called tsetse
abounded on its banks. This would
have brought our wa¬
gons to a standstill in
the wilderness, and we
were reluctantly com¬
pelled to retrace our
steps." Like others
before him, Living¬
stone was stopped by
the tiny yellow-barred
blood - sucking insect
which is today con¬
sidered one of the
greatest scourges of
man and animals in
tropical Africa. "Its
peculiar buzz once
heard," he said, "can
never be forgotten by
the traveller... When
cattle are bitten, they SIR DAVID
become ill in a few
days, then gradually
weaken, and it is perhaps months later
before they die."
The story of the discovery of the
cause of sleeping sickness begins with
this description by Livingstone of the
tsetse fly. In 1895 a fatal cattle dis¬
ease called nagana was raging in
North Zululand. An Australian-born
British Army doctor, Major David
Bruce, who had shown which organism
caused Malta fever, was called in.
Setting up a laboratory in a wattle and
daub hut, he examined blood samples
from sick animals and spied a "rapidly
moving object... lashing about among
the red corpuscles." This he soon iden¬
tified as a trypanosome, a parasite
known to cause disease in animals. He
assumed it was the cause of nagana.
But how did the trypanosome get into
the cattle's blood? He then recalled the
books by Livingstone and other tra¬
vellers. Might there be a link? He sent
down two oxen into the tsetse fly-infest¬
ed plains nearby. They caught nagana
and their blood swarmed with trypa-
nosomes. After endless experiments
Bruce conclusively proved that the
tsetse fly disease and nagana were the
same. So far though no one suspected
that human sleeping sickness and na¬
gana might be linked through the
tsetse. When a sleeping sickness epi¬
demic flared up in
Uganda in 1902 Bruce
joined two other scien¬
tists near Lake Victoria
where 20,000 Africans
were dead or dying.
Soon he found that not
only did the trypano¬
some cause sleeping
sickness but that it was
carried from man to
man by the same insect
that carried nagana
from beast to beast.
By collecting specimens
of tsetse flies from all
over the territory
(where they were called
kiou) Bruce marked
BRUCE out a tsetse location
map. It agreed exactly
with the distribution of
sleeping sickness in the same region.
Still unsatisfied, he. put tsetses in
muslin cages, fed them on sleeping
sickness patients and then let them feed
on healthy monkeys. The monkeys
caught the disease. He took tsetses
from sleeping sickness areas and fed
them on healthy animals. Again the
animals developed the disease symptoms.
Although there are many varieties of
tsetse fly and trypanosomes, Bruce had
discovered the cause of sleeping sickness
and the way it spread. For his work
he was later knighted. He did not
find a cure but he suggested ways of
preventing infection, recommending the
killing of wild game which act as
"reservoir hosts". And it was he who
persuaded a Uganda chief to move his
people 20 miles back from a lake shore
in the tsetse infested country in 1902
thus saving their lives. Much was still
to be done and is still to be done, but
Bruce had opened the way for effective
attacks on the scourge of the tsetse.
