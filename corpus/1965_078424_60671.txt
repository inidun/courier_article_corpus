Majestic and forbidding,
this massive head once
stood on the bare slopes
of Easter Island
in the Pacific.
Carved from volcanic rock,
it measures no less
than 1.55 m. (5 ft.)
The ancestors of
the present Polynesian
inhabitants hewed out,
perhaps only three
or four centuries ago,
an enormous number
of colossal statues
(some weighing
as much as 20 tons).
With their backs
to the ocean
these figures stood
like sentinels
over the mausoleums
along the seashore.

T first, the boldness of
of the South
Sea Island artists shocked Western
taste. Based as they were on artistic
canons completely alien to those we
were accustomed to, their works were
long regarded as curious, amusing,
even grotesque and hideous these
words appear again and again in the
accounts of the early explorers of the
Pacific. It was not until the narrow
confines of our aesthetic standards
had been burst apart by such revolu¬
tionary artistic movements as fauvism,
expressionism, cubism and, more espe¬
cially surrealism, which was drawn to
the art of the South Sea Islanders
above all for its astonishing wealth of
invention, that we came to appreciate
its true beauty.
Attention concentrated mainly on
the sculpture, as being more acces¬
sible and consequently easier to
study than other forms of art. The
paintings, many of them executed on
immovable supports such as tree
trunks or rock faces, are still little
known, as are also the dances and
music, by nature ephemeral.
Travellers to Oceania cannot help
being impressed by the innate sense
of beauty of its peoples. It is clearly
visible in their everyday life and in
the harmonious layout of their villages.
In New Guinea, the dance square,
the centre of community life, is sur¬
rounded by luxuriant vegetation

forming a setting for the majestic
house of the menfolk, with its high
gable decorated with carvings of fan¬
tastic, symbolic paintings. In former
times, the houses in New Caledonia
were ranged on either side of a long
tree-lined avenue leading up to the
imposing dwelling of the chieftain, its
entrance flanked by massive bas
reliefs, its roof topped by a ridge pole
ornamented with carved shapes sil¬
houetted against the sky.
The artistic taste of these people is
evident even in the humblest domestic
objects, of finely burnished material,
beautifully designed and decorated.
For decoration is something more than
mere adornment: it is an adherent
part of the object, contributing in an
important degree to its efficacy. Thus
the Melanesian warrior believes that
it is the ancestral ¡mage on his shield
that defends him from enemy blows;
and it was the protective figures fore
and aft, no less than their nautical
qualities, that inspired the crews of
the big New Zealand boats with confi¬
dence in their vessels.
The image, in this part of the world,
has lost nothing of its evocative
power; it is closely associated with
the being it represents. A man
fashioning a statue of his ancestor
thereby imparts to him material form
and a certain measure of physical
existence. When the spirit, hitherto
invisible and intangible, has been en¬
closed by means of an appropriate
formula, in the tangible symbol repre¬
senting it, it will be more approachable,
more accessible to prayers and
offerings designed to solicit its help
and protection.
A statue must be an object of
beauty; but it has, in addition, a reli¬
gious significance.

To fulfil its religious function, a
work of art must obey certain laws gov¬
erning not only the mode of produc¬
tion, but the design as well; it must
conform to a traditional model which
has been handed down from gene¬
ration to generation, and proved its
worth. The origins of any innovation
in this field have to be vouched for.
Significantly, dreams are regarded as
one of the main sources of inspiration.
During sleep, the soul is believed to
leave the body and it may in the course
of its wanderings enter the world of
the dead and the realm of the gods.
The art of Oceania sets out to inter¬
pret a familiar world, and more espe¬
cially the world of living creatures.
Animals and the human form are its
favourite subjects. Curiously enough,
hardly any use is made of the decora¬
tive forms suggested by plant life,
except in a few areas under Islamic
influence.
From the outset it appears that the
artist bases his design on a concrete
example from real life. We watched
a Melanesian mountaineer drawing a
design that appeared to derive from
his imagination; but he protested this
was not so no design could be invent¬
ed, he said, and this one was to be
found on the shell of an insect. It is
quite possible that the geometric de¬
signs so typical of the westernmost
Polynesian island groups were original¬
ly stylized versions of natural forms.
Traversing these islands from east to
west, we see the classical frieze, re¬
presenting small dancing figures with
arms and legs bent, becoming gra¬
dually simplified until it is reduced to
a broken line.
The artist of Oceania does not seek
to make an exact copy of his model.
The statues fashioned for funeral cere¬
monies in New Ireland are clearly
indicative in this respect. The tradi¬
tional effigy does not bear the features
of the dead person, but is adorned
with the totemic emblems, known only
to his relatives and intimates, the idea
being that the effigy cannot then be
used by ill-intentioned persons in order
to harm the dead man's soul. Maoris,
so as not to give the deity too human
an aspect, depict him with a three-
fingered hand.
In Oceania, the artist strives to pro¬
duce a significant ¡mage by stressing
those particular physical, psychic and
social attributes he thinks most impor¬
tant. On the ridge poles of New Cale¬
donia, keen-sightedness is represented
by a protruding feature under prominent
eyebrows. In the valley of the river
Sepik, the long nose, regarded as a
sign of beauty and virility, is exalted
and so magnified as sometimes to
resemble the long beak of a bird.
A sculptured statue is not so much
a portrait as a symbol, into which the
soul of the dead man can enter.
The main theme of South Sea Island
art is the ancestor god; he it is who
has inspired so many outstanding
works of beauty which are for us a
source of unending pleasure.
