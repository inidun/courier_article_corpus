Top : at the keyboard of a photocomposing
machine, the operator selects a fresh type
by moving a control on the auxiliary panel.
Centre: the latest electronic equipment is
increasingly used to direct and speed up
photo-composition processes. Bottom: hun¬
dreds of characters cover this glass disc. As
it rotates the image of each character selected
is projected by a light and recorded on film.

NTIL recently the two great advan¬
ces in book printing were the use
of movable type composed by hand and the
introduction of metal type-casting machines
in the 19th century. Today, a new era in
printing has begun with the use of photo¬
composition, or filmsetting, which produces
texts directly on film that can be used for
engraving and printing, thus eliminating the
use of raised type.
Book publishers can expect to benefit in
terms of faster production and lower costs
from this new technique as it becomes com¬
bined with new discoveries In electronics.
Since the first photocomposing machine
was devised about 40 years ago a dozen or
more different types have been developed.
One ultra-modern one which Is largely elec¬
tronic in operation looks like an ordinary
metal office desk with a built-in typewriter.
The operator types texts on this central key¬
board and selects the kind and size of type
required on an auxiliary control board.

In modern book
publishing, top-
quality illustra¬
tions are not only
found in works on
art and de luxe
editions but have
also become a fea¬
ture of low-priced
publications.
Every effort is
made to attain the
highest standards
of reproduction.
Left, colour illus¬
trations are given
an extra-close
scrutiny. Below, a
final check of
pages composed
directly on film.
A machine of this kind can compose texts
directly on film or can record them in code
on perforated tape. This can be stored and
later fed into an electronically-operated pho¬
tographic unit which, automatically sets type
on film in response to the information on the
tape, working faster than human hands.
At some future time book publishers may
deliver all their copy to the printer on tapes.
Electronically-controlled machines will then
decode the tapes and in a single operation
produce film prints of the book pages ready
for engraving and printing.
A big advantage of photocomposing ma¬
chines Is their compactness. An installation
covering 50 square metres can do the work
of present equipment needing ten times this
space. In one machine a rotating disc
bearing nearly 1 ,500 characters replaces over
one and a half tons of lead matrixes needed
in metal type casting.
Photosetting may also solve problems
created by the intricate forms, vowel accents
and, in some cases, the sheer volume of
characters in some of the world's complex
writing systems, for which metal type has
often been found inadequate. Research has
shown that photocomposing machines could
do the job. A machine for the Chinese lan¬
guage, for example, would need only twenty-
six signs on Its basic keyboard to select
any of the thousands of known characters.
