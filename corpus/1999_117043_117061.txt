IS COP Y RIGHT ON THE 
W RONG TRACK ?
w Mireille Buydens
Efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights are posing a challenge 
to their original purpose—striking a balance between the protection 
of individual property and the public interest
n
W h at is the purpose of intellectual pro-
p e rty rights? Ori ginally they were based
on the principle that creat o rs should be
granted exclusive rights to exploit their
wo r k s , in order to ensure they were properly
r e m u n e r ated and, in addition, to encourage
c r e at i ve activity. But in the interest of the
community and of future artists and inve n-
t o rs , those exclusive rights were limited in
time:when the term of protection ran out,
the works fell into the public domain, a
c o p y right-free space that encourages crea-
tion and competition.They could then be
used as raw mat e rial and a kind of “ s u g g e s-
tion box ” by fresh generations of creat o rs.
A balance between the protection of indi-
vidual property and the general interest wa s
guaranteed.
To d ay that balance has been destroye d .
The founding principles of intellectual pro-
p e rty seem to be threatened by an ill-consi-
dered increase in the number of pri vat e l y
held exclusive rights at the expense of the
public domain.
Counterfeit software
and designer clothes
The main factor hastening these deve-
lopments is a change in the economy, w h i c h
focuses increasingly on products with “ i n t e l-
lectual added va l u e ” , such as new softwa r e ,
the selection and presentation of informa-
t i o n , specialized computer serv i c e s , c u l-
tural and entertainment products,biotech
p r o d u c t s , and other applications of cut-
ting-edge technologi e s. Control of ideas,
f o rm s , images and brands is a cru c i a l
element in this so-called “immaterial eco-
nomy”.
While it is difficult to steal a consign-
ment of steel gi r d e rs or a cargo of bananas,
it is child’s play to copy software or manu-
facture counterfeit designer clothes. It is
easy for intellectual added value to be illicitly

a p p r o p ri at e d : it cannot be “put under lock
and key”.Those who want to exploit it for
their own profit simply need to be able to
reproduce it. P i r ates in this field can market
copied products at a lower price than the
originals,since they do not have to pay the
cost of creating or adve rtising the product.
By doing this, they distort competition.
International negotiations
To protect their industries against piracy
and counterfeiting (see box), the member
c o u n t ries of GATT (General A gr e e m e n t
on Ta riffs and Tr a d e , which gove rned inter-
national trade from 1947 to 1994) set out
to strengthen intellectual property ri g h t s
within the GATT framewo r k .G AT T ’s main
c o n c e rn was to protect companies from
u n a u t h o rized copying and unfair competi-
t i o n , thus ensuring they would get a return
on their investment.
When GATT concluded its first agr e e-
ments, intellectual property was not very
high on the agenda. In the immediat e
postwar years,products put on the market
still consisted of atoms of mat t e r , not bytes.
It was not until the Uru g u ay Round of talks
s t a rted in 1986 that the issue came to be dis-
cussed at the intern ational leve l .T h at round
of talks resulted in the signing, on April 15
1994, of the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
( T R I P S ) . Like the multilateral agr e e m e n t s
on trade in goods, the text was included in
an appendix to the Marrakesh framework
agreement that set up GATT’s successor,
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
TRIPS,which has a global application
(most countries in the world have now sub-
s c ribed to it), c o n f i rmed the economic
importance of intellectual property rights.
It requires member states to protect all
f o rms of creat i o n :l i t e r a ry and artistic wo r k s
in the broadest sense (including maps and
press photos), computer progr a m s , d at a
b a s e s , sound recordings, radio and television
b r o a d c a s t s , d r awings and models, i nve n-
tions of products and processes in eve ry
technological field, the lay-out designs of
integrated circuits,and so on.
The agreement was a milestone in the
h i s t o ry of intellectual propert y. F i rs t , i t s
scope of application is unprecedentedly
w i d e :a nything created in the fields of tech-
nology, software, news or culture can and
must be protected by an intellectual pro-
p e rty ri g h t , in such a way that it exclusive l y
benefits rights holders, who alone decide
h ow it should be reproduced and distri-
buted. Secondly, for the first time TRIPS
requires contracting states to organize pro-
cedures and sanctions that enable ri g h t s
holders to ensure that their rights are res-
p e c t e d .Those states are for example obliged
to allow persons or companies whose ri g h t s
h ave been infringed upon to go to court
and obtain damages. Such duties are chiefly
incumbent upon the developing countri e s.
Most of these countries do not possess the
human or financial resources that wo u l d
enable them to develop their own produc-
tion, and they have tended to become the
p r e f e rred locations of the copying industri e s.
In this general move towards compre-
hensive protection of products with intel-
lectual added value, the European Union
has not lagged behind. In the course of the
past 10 ye a rs , it has been ve ry active in
introducing new legislation.According to
the directive of May 14, 1991, computer
p r o grams are protected by copyright at
European Union level. Similarly, the defi-
nition of copyright content has been tigh-
t e n e d ,p a rticularly as regards the copyri g h t
of works put on the Intern e t . In this connec-
tion, a proposed directive on “the harmo-
n i z ation of certain aspects of copyright and
n e i g h b o u ring rights in the inform at i o n
s o c i e t y ” was examined by the European
Parliament on February 10, 1999, with a
view to its adoption.The directive contains
p r ovisions for authors or their rights holders
to control the distri bution of their works on
the Net or to forbid it. Any copy of their
sound or visual works available online will
entitle them to financial compensat i o n ,
even if the copy is made solely for strictly
private use.
A new right to protect investment
The protection of data bases by copy-
right has also been confirm e d . For the firs t
time in the European Union, it was even
extended to their contents by a directive of
March 11 1996. Until then, it had been
accepted that a compilation of data pos-
sessing the characteristics of an ori gi n a l
creation could be protected by copyright.
But this protection covered only the selec-
tion and arrangement of the data, in other
words the structure or container of the
base,not its content.The raw data, on the
other hand,were not covered by copyright
and could therefore be used by anyo n e .O n
this occasion, the European legi s l at o r
stressed that data collection could, irres-
pective of the creation of the data base’s
a r c h i t e c t u r e , represent a substantial inve s t-
m e n t . He concluded that the content of
the data base should also be protected.
Clearly departing from the traditional ru l e s
g ove rning intellectual propert y, which in
t h e o ry concern creat i ve contri butions alone
(products with intellectual added va l u e ) ,
he established a new right designed to pro-
tect financial inve s t m e n t .Those who make
a “ s u b s t a n t i a l ” i nvestment are prov i d e d ,
de fa c t o, with an exclusive right to the bene-

fits of their inve s t m e n t , e ven if there has
been no intellectual creation.
Financial interests again have now
prompted the European legi s l ator to
consider the adoption of a directive on the
protection of biotechnological inventions.
The move was motivated by two factors:
f i rs t , “the protection of biotechnologi c a l
inventions will certainly be of key impor-
tance for the Community’s industrial deve-
l o p m e n t ” ; s e c o n d l y, “research and deve-
l o p m e n t , notably in the field of genetic
e n gi n e e ri n g, require a considerable degr e e
of high-risk investment which cannot be
profitable unless there is adequate legal
protection”.
Financial terminology—talk of profit a-
bility and an attractive “return on invest-
ment”—is invading the sphere of intellectual
p r o p e rt y. The notion of intellectual pro-
perty used to be a way of protecting intel-
lectual added value; it has now become an
instrument for turning invested capital to
good account. Is this a necessity or is it
r e grettable? The question is wo rth deba-
ting.
It is true that in the field of biotechno-
logy, for example, creation requires consi-
derable investment.This is something that
i n d u s t rial companies cannot accept unless
they are sure of being able to make it at least
p a rtially profit a b l e . On the other hand, o n e
m ay reasonably wonder whether there is
any point in creating a new monopoly on
i n f o rm ation contained in data bases, e ven if
a great deal of time and money has gone
into creating them.The idea here is not to
r e ward an intellectual creat i o n , h owe ve r
s l i g h t , but merely to repay an investment in
time and money.This trend could well jeo-
pardize the sharing of know l e d g e . T h e
notion of intellectual property here seems to
h ave departed from its basic purp o s e ,w h i c h
was to ensure a balance between pri vat e
and public interests.
This change of direction is one of the
f i rst perve rse effects of the exponential
increase in the amount of space occupied by
intellectual propert y. More fundamentally,
it has been engineered by a society that
tends to make legal and mat e rial protection
the keystone of its ethos: all property and
a nything else of value needs to be protected
against ri s k . Accident preve n t i o n ,s e c u ri t y,
insurance and protection have become man-
tras in developed Western societies. It has
reached the point where those societies
sometimes seem to have forgotten that ri s k
is an inherent aspect of life and freedom.
The second perve rse effect of the boom
in intellectual property—the broadening
of its scope as well as of its duration—is
equally wo rry i n g . In 1993, for example,
the duration of copyright in the European
Union was increased from 50 to 70 years
after the author’s death.
On many occasions over the last ten
ye a rs , l e gi s l at o rs and courts have also
a greed to an unlimited extension of the
scope of copyright protection. O ri gi n a l l y
designed to protect works of art , c o p y ri g h t
has been extended to cover eve ry sphere of
human creat i o n , from the design of car
b o d y work or ties, m e t e o r o l o gical photo-
graphs and the instruction manuals of
e l e c t rical household appliances to dat a
bases and recipes. Since eve ry t h i n g
belongs to someone, an authori z ation from
the owner is required for eve ry t h i n g . I n
practice it has become extremely diffic u l t
to create a multimedia wo r k , to shoot a
fil m , to compose a piece of music, or to
publish an illustrated book without in
some way having to use elements that are
protected by copyri g h t , and therefore
h aving to request a detailed authori z at i o n
from copyright holders and to pay them
financial compensat i o n .
In the short term , this increase in the
number of exclusive rights will be a threat
to economic activity itself. C o m p e t i t i o n ,
after all, boils down to offering the same
product as someone else. N ow if that 
product and all its va ri a n t s , ve rsions and
components are protected by intellectual
c o p y ri g h t , copying—in other wo r d s ,
making a competing offer—becomes an
extremely hazardous exe r c i s e . If limited
e x c l u s i ve ri g h t s , which used to form part of
the ori ginal spirit of intellectual propert y,
protect companies against illicit copying,
d i s p r o p o rt i o n ate exclusive rights quite
simply wipe out competition altogether.
As for the extension of the duration of
c o p y ri g h t , it means that the community’s
right to make free use of a work after it has
fallen into the public domain will be a
theoretical possibility rather than a fa c t .
The present duration of copyright protec-
tion often exceeds the period during which
the created work is in fact usable. After 70
ye a rs or more, an old computer program is
of no use to anyo n e .
S i m i l a r l y, the European directive on
d ata bases theoretically restricts their pro-
tection period to 15 ye a rs. But it stipulat e s
t h at if a data base is modifie d , notably by a
large number of additions, deletions or
changes which show there has been sub-
stantial further inve s t m e n t , the durat i o n
can be extended by 15 ye a rs.T h u s , a regu-
larly updated data base can be protected
for ever and will therefore never fall out of
c o p y ri g h t .T h at contravenes the most fun-
damental principles that underlay the
notion of intellectual property ri g h t s. n
