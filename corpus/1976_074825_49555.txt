We present here and overleaf drawings and
captions by the French architect and urban
planner Yona Friedman. They featured in
a retrospective exhibition of Yona Friedman's
work entitled " Une Utopie Réalisée "
(A Utopia Made Real) held at the Museum
of Modern Art in Paris in 1975. Yona Friedman's

help design their future homes, so long as
they have a clear idea what the result will be.

doing his own
planning. But

He is only one
user among
many. His plans must not upset
those of other people. He must
learn to explain his own plan
to others. So communication
between users is the first step
in real "do-it-yourself planning".

it is impossible for each one
to explain what he wants...
