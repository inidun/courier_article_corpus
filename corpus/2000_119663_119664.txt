A traveller weaves his way through streets and alleys 
crowded with memories ■
I was a child when I first discovered
C a i r o, one morning when I had
t r avelled from my nat i ve Upper
Egypt on the famous midnight train. I
stayed with my aunt on my father’s side,
who lived in the Fostat quarter [name of
a city founded in 641 by the Muslim
conqueror Aman ‘bn Al ‘Ass] on the outs-
kirts of Old Cairo. The air was filled with

an acrid, p e n e t r ating smell from a nearby
t a n n e ry.
On the first evening, I went to the nea-
rest mosque, d e d i c ated to the memory of an
extremely pious man named Sidi A b d u l
S a o u d . From an adjoining house came the
sound of wo m e n ’s vo i c e s ,c ri e s , and beat i n g
t a m b o u ri n e s ,m e r ging into a kind of incan-
tation. I could not resist. Trying not to be
noticed,I slipped into the courtyard of the
house.
A group of common women, clad in
long black dresses, were dancing in a
circle, keeping pace with an increasingly
quick, breathless beat. Their bodies mer-
ging into a single whole, their hips rocked
by a movement they could no longer
control, projected an irresistible sensuali-
ty.
A young man with hair as long as the
wo m e n ’s and we a ring a tight gown wa s
standing in the middle of the circle and
b e ating the rhythm with small cy m b a l s.
Some of the women dancing around him
were playing tambourines.
It was a zar ceremony—a ritual held
to remove a spell.The women had gone
into a collective trance to expel from their
bodies the demons that had possessed
them. It had become so intense that some
had collapsed and lay prostrate on the
ground.The young man leaned over each
one and whispered mysterious words into
their ears and revived them.
I shall never forget that scene.It unex-
pectedly introduced me,as if I were a tres-

passer, into the very heart of Old Cairo.
If you take the road that today leads
from Fo s t at to the intern ational airp o rt ,
you come to the foot of the great plateau
and the overlooking Citadel built by Saladin
in 1176.The impregnable silhouette of this
symbol of power abutting the Moqat t a n
hills rises above the capital and keeps wat c h
over it day and night. When Bonapart e
entered Cairo in the last days of the 18th
c e n t u ry, it was here that he installed his
a rt i l l e ry. It was from here that he shelled the
rebellious poor neighbourhoods.
Before the time of the illustrious French
g e n e r a l , the Citadel was the place where the
Turkish gove rn o rs representing the Sublime
Porte were inducted in great splendour. It
was here too that Mohammed Ali, seeking
to take the reins of power in the early 19th
century, invited all the Mameluke lords to
his son’s wedding—and then had them
slaughtered to the last man.
One of the Citadel’s gates leads to the
Fatimid city, in other words the ori gi n a l
C a i r o, Al Qahira, founded by Gohar the
S i c i l i a n , who commanded the troops of the
dynasty that conquered Egypt in 975.
The jewels of the Muslim city can be
found there: Al Azhar Unive rsity and the A l
Hussein mosque, s u rrounded by dozens of
other mosques that are lit up and come alive
at night, calling to one another with the ebbing
and flowing of the vast Cairo crow d .D u ri n g
R a m a d a n , the month of fasting and of feasting
t o g e t h e r , circles of believe rs chant praises to
their Creator in harm o ny. And mystic bro-
therhoods from all over Egypt meet to sing
and dance their love of God until daw n .
I never tire of we aving my way with
friends at night through the latticework of
streets and alleyways in this neighbourhood
where the soul of Cairo never sleeps.

I never tire of weaving

the latticework of streets 
and alleyways in this
neighbourhood where the soul

politely turned him dow n . “It is top quality,”
he insisted.Why on earth should I want to
buy oil I didn’t need in the middle of the
street? But I was intrigued by the gaze of
t h at man who, while talking about oil,
seemed to have something else in mind.
When at last I figured out that he was talking
about hashish, I ran away as fast as my legs
could carry me. But that did not keep me
from noticing other young people seated
behind little tables offering passersby the
same sort of oil.
All that happened a long time ago.
This first visit to Cairo was followed by
m a ny others. For a long time, I dreamed of
living in the Al Ghourieh quart e r.The seve r e d
head of Touman Bey,E g y p t ’s last Mameluke
s u l t a n , was hung over the gate to this neigh-
bourhood after the Ottoman Turks killed
him in the 16th century. A year earlier his
fat h e r , Sultan Al Ghouri , had been killed
resisting the new conquerors.The quarter has
b o rne his name to honour him ever since.
Al Ghouri e h ’s elusive charm lies, I think,
in the omnipresence of the past.The we i g h t
of history can be felt in each narrow street
a n d ,e ven more so, in the faces of the people
who live there, which express, often uncons-
ciously, the tranquil certainty that this has
a lways been and always will be their home.
I really discovered this neighbourhood
when I visited three artists who in the 1970s
represented the creative genius of Egypt’s

common people: the blind composer Sheik
I m a m , the poet Ahmad Fuad Negm and the
l u t e - p l ayer Muhammed A l i . In their public
p e r f o rm a n c e s , these three men dared to
voice the anger of the poor, the outrage of
students and the dreams of a better life
t h at were embodied in those days by Ho Chi
Minh and Che Guevara.
They lived in a shack that seemed in a
state of imminent collapse.You had to be
very careful where you put your feet.You
might be invited to have a cup of tea, but
c e rtainly not a dish of grilled chops. I n s t e a d
you had to settle for the smell that wafted in
from a nearby stall.
Such a neighbourhood can hold a
strange at t r a c t i o n . Something in the close-
knit fa b ric of the bu i l d i n g s , in the vibra-
tions of the passing crow d , excites the
i m a gi n at i o n . You can almost guess what
the interi o rs of the houses look like, e n t e r
the alcove s , share amorous e m b r a c e s ,
follow the silent gaze of women behind
the musharabiehs.1
Fo rt u n at e l y, the women now go out
into the street, often draped in wide black
veils that are supposed to conceal their
bodies from intru s i ve eyes but actually
emphasize their shapely curves.There is a
language in the undulations of the female
body that I never tire of learning.
Al Ghourieh leads into a street named
after Al Hakim Bi Amr Illah (“He who
g ove rns by divine decree”), the illustri o u s
Fatimid caliph whose mystic personality has
a lways baffled histori a n s. In this street you can
e n j oy all the scents of the East, from per-
fumes to medicinal plants. Here traditional
remedies for most known physical and psy-

work allowing one to see without being seen.

c h o l o gical ailments can still be found.
This street crosses another wo r l d - fa m o u s
t h o r o u g h fa r e , Khan Al Khalili Street, w h e r e
t o u rist coaches pour forth their passengers all
year round. H e r e , E g y p t ’s most skilful
craftsmen display a dazzling arr ay of hand-
made products in gold, s i l k , g l a s s , wo o d ,
copper and ivo ry. All kinds of things are for
s a l e — e ven dresses for belly-dancers.
A visit to the celebrated Al Fichawi cafe,
where they provide you with a royal hookah,
is a must for anyone who wants to claim they
really saw Old Cairo.This coffee-house is a
microcosm of street life, an endless stream of
newspaper ve n d o rs , shoe-shine men, b e g-
g a rs , street peddlers—as well as poets,n ove-
lists and journalists of eve ry stri p e .
L a s t l y, this neighbourhood was long the
home of Egypt’s national glory, our coun-
t ry ’s first Nobel Prize-winner for literat u r e ,
Naguib Mahfouz. His best-known novels
take place in this spellbinding maze of
narrow streets and dead-ends, where the
h e a rt of the city beats and is haunted by his
larger-than-life pers o n a g e s. From the
immense fresco of characters in his nove l s ,
w hy am I tempted to recall only the f u t u wa?
They were men who, with panache, mas-
culine generosity and effic i e n cy, enforced a
c e rtain order, e ven a certain justice, in their
n e i g h b o u r h o o d s. They formed a sort of
p e o p l e ’s police who stood up for the needy
and the weak in the name of a chivalrous
code of honour.
To d ay, they have disappeared.And with
t h e m , a whole wo r l d — t h at of Naguib Mah-
fouz himself—which gave Old Cairo its
soul is disappearing from our lives.
As you will have guessed, I am uncon-
solable. ■
