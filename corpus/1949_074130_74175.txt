THIRTY men and women students,t representing nve continents,
gathered round a table in one of
the rooms of Unesco House, d'uring the
progress of the Fourth Session of the
General Conference, to learn about the
"know-how"of Unesco. This study
group, or seminar, had been inspired
by the World Federation of United
Nations Associations (WFUNA), whose
business it is to spread knowledge to
young and old'about the behind-the-
scenes mechanism of Unesco and other
United Nations Specialized Agencies.
An important purpose of WFUNA
in convening this seminar was to give
the young people concerned, who are
preparing for political, economic and
international careers, a chance of be-
coming acquainted with the technique
of a large international conference.
The Federation had made similar
arrangements for doctors to attend
the WHO Assembly in Rome and the
same opportunity will be given at the
Economic Commission for Europe
meeting in Geneva, next May.
