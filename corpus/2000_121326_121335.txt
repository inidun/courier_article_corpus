The tre a s u res 
in Mauritania’s
d u n e s
Once, Mauritania’s ksours were thriving
centres of trade and learning. Today, the
country is struggling to save them from
sand, wind and oblivion

Waves of white, beige and red sand
incessantly blow from the north and
s o u t h , crashing against the purplish
mass of the A d r a r,a mountain range
that crosses Mauritania between the
Majabat El Koubra and Aouker deserts.The dunes
conceal four jewels:Ouadane and Chinguetti in the
n o r t h ,Tichitt and Oualata in the southeast.These old,
stone-built cities date back to the 12th and 13th
centuries and were once very prosperous,but today
they only barely survive in such a hostile
e n v i r o n m e n t . O u a d a n e, C h i n g u e t t i ,
Tichitt and Oualata may be drawing their
last breath, but they are essential to
understanding the history of this area,
whose fate was closely linked to the water
table and the trade routes that span the
M a g h r e b, the Sahel and black A f r i c a .
These cities, known as k s o u r s— o f
which Chinguetti was probably the most
famous—were located on major caravan
r o u t e s, and over the centuries turned
into metropolises of trans-Saharan trade,
especially in gold and salt. Th e
Chanaguita [inhabitants of Chinguetti]
were skilled merchants who established regular
contacts with the Maghreb, Egypt and Arabia to the
n o r t h , and Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria to
the south,playing an important part in the spread of
both Arabic and Islamic culture. Trade caravans
from Chinguetti sometimes employed over 30,000
camels carrying salt, w o o l ,g u n p o w d e r,d a t e s,m i l l e t ,
wheat and barley. They returned from the south
with gold powder, slaves, ivory, animal hides and
ostrich feathers. These goods were subsequently
resold in Cairo, S i j i l m a s s a , Fez and above all
T l e m c e n , where Venetians and Genoese traders
stocked up in the two f o n d o u k s that were specially
set aside for them.
According to some sources, the origins of
O u a l a t a , which means “shady place” in Berber,
probably date back to a period preceding Islam. B y
the 13th and 14th centuries, Oualata had become
such an important trading centre that its name
appeared on European maps. A great Muslim
f a m i l y, the Maqqaris,had built a warehouse there for
gathering goods from the south and storing
merchandise from the north before they were
resold.Oualata was also where pilgrims from west
Africa assembled before travelling on to Chinguetti,
a departure point for the annual caravan to Mecca.
This pilgrimage had made the city so famous that for
a long time Mauritania was known as Bilad
Chinguel—the land of Chinguetti.
Libraries and schools
guard priceless manuscripts
A major trade route connected Oualata with
O u a d a n e,which was a very prosperous city,e s p e c i a l l y
between the 14th and 18th centuries.But trade was not
its sole source of wealth. Learning has always been
extremely important to Mauritanians. S u n n i t e
Muslims of the Malikite rite, they turned their k s o u r s
into renowned intellectual centres that attracted
many foreign students.To this day, their libraries and
m a d r a s a s [ Koranic schools] have jealously preserved
some 40,000 priceless manuscripts.At one time up to

40 scholars lived on the same street in Ouadane,or at
least that’s what people say.And if the etymology of
the city’s name is any indication,that was most likely
t r u e, since it means “the city of the two wadis”: t h e
wadi of the palm trees and the wadi of knowledge.
Benefiting from its location on the route
between Oualata and Ouadane,Tichitt grew into a
m a g n i ficent city.The town’s multi-storied houses—
with blind walls on the ground flo o r, a door for
only opening to the outside and façades built of
coloured stones—are fragile remnants of typical
Mauritanian architecture.
The buildings’ subdued polychrome stands in
sharp contrast to the exuberant façades in Oualata,
where the doors, porches, vents and windows are
trimmed with white drawings against a reddish-
brown undercoat. The rosettes around the lustral
stones are especially beautiful. People living here
brush their fingers over them before performing
ritual ablutions with water that has often been in
short supply in a town whose narrow streets are
stifled by sand and dust.
But Oualata’s most famous paintings adorn the
walls of inner courtyards. Composed of simple,
endlessly repeated designs, these arabesques show
the stairs, d o o r s, w i n d o w s, alcoves and openings off
to their best advantage. They are usually painted
with a substance made of brown ochre, c h a r c o a l ,
gum and cow pat.
Children’s laughter replaced by
the stubborn whistling of the wind
These decorations are typical of Oualata. I n
O u a d a n e, on the other hand, the houses were built
of pink or grey sandstone and a mortar made of
clay and straw.All the walls in the city were covered
with clay to protect them from the scarce rain,g i v i n g
them an extremely sober,r e fined appearance.To d a y,
this coating only remains in places, testimony to the
decrepit state that the entire city has fallen into.
The laughter of children running through the narrow,
astonishingly angular streets and up cramped stairs
between two blocks of houses has faded away.Th e
teeming throngs have vanished forever. A single
sound now breaks this realm of silence: the whistling
of the wind as it stubbornly blows against ghostly
f a ç a d e s. O u a d a n e ’s families have moved to a small
part of the “upper town,” deserting all the other

Defying time: the entrance to a mosque in Chinguetti.

s a n d . Legend has it that seven towns have been
superimposed on this site, and the one that has
come down to us today is irretrievably sinking
beneath the dunes. Only the upper stories of a few
houses are visible—the rest has been swallowed
by the sand.As recently as a century ago, this oasis
was farmland that produced enough food to feed a
population of several thousand inhabitants.To d a y,
the few wind-battered palm trees are dying, half-
buried in sand.The final blow came last year, w h e n
torrential rains destroyed 80 percent of the town.
L u c k i l y,the splendid mosque and its square minaret,
the most beautiful building of all,survived.
Musicians still sing the glory
of life in the ksours
Although Mauritania’s old towns have lost
ground to the Sahara in the north and the Sahel in the
s o u t h , along with suffering a devastating, d e c a d e s -
long drought,they refuse to go quietly into the night.
The creative genius of ancient civilizations is still
the driving force behind Mauritanian culture. Th e
designs on Oualata’s walls are the same as those still
drawn on the hands and feet of Mauritanian women.
They can also be found in jewelry, leatherwork and
w o o d w o r k , the embroidery on men’s garments, t h e
dye of women’s veils,the weave of traditional carpets
and even the bills of the nation’s currency, t h e
o u g u i y a. The melodies of Va l a , a famous musician
from Chinguetti who has become an emblematic
figure of Mauritanian music, are still played on the
t i d i n i t, the Moorish lute. Other traditional
c o m p o s i t i o n s, such as the a w d i d , which was once
performed as the Tichitt caravans were being loaded,
immortalize the various aspects of life in the k s o u r s
when they were at the height of their glory.
Thus tradition is passed down from one
generation to the next, like the beams that still
pump water from old wells in the small farm plots
and nonchalantly bow up and down across the
centuries. ■

Intricate designs adorn the interior of a house in Oualata.

n e i g h b o u r h o o d s. And if a few buildings are still
standing in the rest of the city, it is thanks to the
foresight of their builders,who provided them with
ledges to protect them from rain and wind erosion.
In Chinguetti too the sand has slowly invaded
the courtyards of abandoned houses, to the point
that the floors of formerly inhabited rooms lying
under collapsed stone walls are now more than one
metre below street level. But this city remains “ t h e
soul of the country,” and population loss has been
less severe than in Ouadane, Tichitt and Oualata.
The square minaret of its famous mosque, which was
the national symbol of Bilad Chinguel for a long
time, is still afoot and defying time.
By contrast, Ti c h i t t , located in a basin at the
foot of the Adrar, is much less protected from the
