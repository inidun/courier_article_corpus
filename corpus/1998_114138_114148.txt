No major industrialized country can in good faith
d e ny the contri bution of immigrant labour to its
prosperity, not even “impenetrable” Japan with its
some 300,000 clandestine workers. Hardly any of their
construction projects could have materialized without
i m m i grant labour. N e ve rt h e l e s s , despite today ’s fast pace
of globalizat i o n , increasing migr ation movements and
the accelerating tendency towards cosmopolitan
s o c i e t i e s , i m m i grant wo r k e rs are still perpetual and
universal scapegoats, no more shielded in this respect
than their predecessors a century ago.
The intensity of exploitation and rejection may have
diminished in certain countri e s , but as always the
i m m i grant worker is only admitted to so-called “ h o s t
c o u n t ri e s ” in order to satisfy labour demand and lat e r
d i s c a r d e d , ve ry often like a paper handkerchief which has
s e rved its purp o s e .E ven people of immigrant ori gin may
take part in this rejection; those who have once been
exploited can themselves become formidable exploiters.
The human reality of immigr ation continues to be
n e g l e c t e d . The migrant worker is seen as nothing more
than “human capital”, and more as “ c a p i t a l ” t h a n
“ h u m a n ” .This is so both in developing countri e s ,l a r g e l y
because of the present economic cri s i s , and in the
i n d u s t rialized countri e s , including former sending
c o u n t ri e s , because of the upsurge of nat i o n a l i s m .
Since the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia began
in mid-1997, Thailand has expelled some 250,000
i m m i grant wo r k e rs , South Korea has “ l e n i e n t l y ”a l l owe d
50,000 illegal immigrants to leave the country instead of
fining or imprisoning them, and Malaysia has already
deported some 50,000 Indonesian workers, granting a
t wo-month amnesty as from 1 September 1998 for
illegal workers to leave the country voluntarily or face
s a n c t i o n s. These numbers do not include those who
m i gr ated intern a l l y, from the rural areas to the cities,
and have now been forced to return to their villages.
Vulnerable and ‘different’, immigrants are easy targets when their host
countries experience hard times
I m m i grant wo r k e rs in A f rica have not been
spared.One of the more recent examples is that of
South A f ri c a , which after having succeeded in
putting an end to the apartheid regime,intensified
its fight against clandestine immigrants whose
labour was no longer required.Between 1992 and
1 9 9 5 , South A f rica expelled almost 400,000
A f rican wo r k e rs , mainly Mozambicans whose
government had played such an active role against
apartheid.(See pages 28-29).
Contributing more
than they receive
In industrialized countri e s , g l o b a l i z ation has
p r ovo k e d , inter alia, the development of
nationalism, supported largely by those who have
become margi n a l i z e d , unable to keep up with
increasing competitive n e s s. Faced with an
increasing mass of discontented citizens, p o l i t i c i a n s
in search of electoral themes choose the easy way
out. It is more difficult to get across to the public
c o m p l i c ated explanations of economic theory,
global trade and financial markets than it is to to
attack new arri va l s , d e p riving them of access to
social security programmes so that “savings” thus
made may be used to aid the poor nat i o n a l s.
M e a n w h i l e , in all the industrialized countri e s ,
i m m i gr a n t s ’ c o n t ri butions to social protection
systems are higher than the benefits they receive.
Once considered to be the exclusive capital of
the far ri g h t , the use of immigrants as scapegoats is
n ow tempting other parties across the spectru m ,
from the right to the left. The United Stat e s , t h e
wo r l d ’s most powerful industrialized nat i o n , w h i c h
owes its prosperity and ve ry existence to the arri val of
waves of immigr a n t s , is not exe m p t .The situation is

Eternal scapegoats Antonio Cruz*
Indonesian immigrants look out through the port-holes of a ship on their way back to their country after being deported from Malaysia.

i m m i gr ation located in the A s i a - Pa c i fic regi o n ,w h e r e
the immigrant scapegoat is designated by his or her
colour and ethnicity. Pauline Hanson’s anti-
i m m i grant party does not point the finger at
European immigr a n t s , mostly of modest
b a c k gr o u n d ,but rather at Asians who have generally
poured substantial investment into the country and
at A b o ri gines whose ancestors lived in Australia we l l
before the arri val of immigrant settlers , i n c l u d i n g
the ancestors of Ms Hanson’s support e rs. (See art i c l e
page 33). H owe ve r , the target may not only not be a
f o r e i g n e r , but be of the same “ c o l o u r ” and “ e t h n i c
gr o u p ” as his or her at t a c k e rs : in June 1989 a
s o u t h e rn Italian was beaten to death in Verona by a
group of nort h e rn e rs. Ve ry often, in A f rica for
e x a m p l e , there is nothing physical or cultural to
distinguish an attacked immigrant from his or her
at t a c k e rs.
The mechanism is immutable and implacable:
a culpri t — e ven an imagi n a ry one—for the
difficulties afflicting a country must always be
found.When there is no foreigner to fit the bill,the
mechanism acts against those who are considered
different (see the history of Jewish communities)
or vulnerable (wo m e n ) . But immigrants are easy
targets because they are particularly vulnerable as
well as being “ d i f f e r e n t ” . They are generally not
a l l owed to vo t e . In developing countri e s , s h i f t i n g
the blame on immigrants is easy because of the
weakness or absence of democratic institutions to
uphold their rights. In industrialized countries it is
no more difficult to incite public opinion against
i m m i grants by invoking the right of freedom of
e x p r e s s i o n , despite the fact that exercise of this ri g h t
may jeopardize their fundamental rights.
Steps towards progress in the social field and
in fundamental and legal rights of immigrants now
seem to have come to a halt, and the timid
achievements realized so far are threatened.After
ten ye a rs of arduous negotiations within the United
Nations,its General Assembly finally approved on
18 December 1990 the new Intern at i o n a l
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
M i grant Wo r k e rs and Members of their Fa m i l i e s
(Resolution 45/158). This is the firs t - e ve r
i n t e rn ational instrument with a broad definition of
the rights of migrant wo r k e rs which offers some
means to ensure compliance with the provisions by
contracting states.
Twenty states must ratify the convention before it
can come into force. Almost eight ye a rs lat e r , o n l y
nine states have done so (Bosnia and Herzegov i n a ,
Cape Verde, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco, the

t wo (Chile and the initiating stat e ,Mexico) have only
signed it.Not one “host country ” is on the list. In the
m e a n t i m e , m i grant wo r k e rs may rely essentially on
t wo limited instruments of the Intern ational Labour
O r g a n i s at i o n , namely the Migr ation for Employ m e n t
C o nvention (Revised) of 1949, r at i fied by fort y - o n e
s t at e s , and its supplementary provisions approved in
1 9 7 5 , which have been rat i fied by eighteen stat e s.
A return ticket
for the baker
A we l l - k n own cartoon shows a Frenchman who
accused foreign workers of “stealing the bread”of
French people and was unable to buy bread one
m o rning because his baker, of immigrant ori gi n ,
had returned to his home country. This once
actually happened in the French city of
Montbéliard.
In 1979-1980,about 35 per cent of the foreign
wo r k e rs living in Montbéliard’s twe n t y - t h r e e
s atellite tow n s , affected by the declining automobile
industry, accepted the French Government’s offer
of a “ r e t u rn premium”. N owhere else in France
was the acceptance rate so high and the
consequences were disastrous: schools had to close
d own because of insufficient pupils, and many
s h o p s , restaurants and other businesses had to stop
trading for lack of clients. This example clearly
s h ows that foreign wo r k e rs are not merely prov i d e rs
of labour. They and their familities are also
indispensable components of the society in which
they live and have their own role to play. n
