The first contribution of Claude 
Lévi-Strauss to the delibera-
tions of UNESCO goes back to 
1949: he participated then in the 
international commission of scho-
lars entrusted with drafting the 
first UNESCO declaration on race, 
published consecutively in 1950. 
In the same year, he was commis-
sioned by UNESCO to carry out an 
inquiry into the state of social 
sciences in Pakistan. In 1951, he 
sat on the committee of experts 
convened to set up the Interna-
tional Social Science Council, of 
which he was the first Secretary-
General, from 1952 to 1961. In 
1952, on the request of UNESCO, 
he wrote Race and History, which 
was to become a classic of antira-
cist literature. In 1971, invited to 
inaugurate the International Year 
for Action to Combat Racism, 
Lévi-Strauss gave a lecture entit-
led Race and Culture. This lecture 
was not in keeping with the doc-
trine of the Organization, and it 
undermined the relationship. 
There has, however, been reconci-
liation in recent years, as was

These vicissitudes show the 
parallel development, over half a 
century, of the thought of Claude 
Lévi-Strauss on one hand, and of 
the doctrine of UNESCO on the 
other. The main topic with which 
both dealt was the biological and 
cultural diversity of mankind. 
Agreements… 
In his twenties, Claude Lévi-
Strauss was a committed political 
activist belonging to a circle of 
young socialist intellectuals, who 
were profoundly affected by the 
catastrophe of the Great War, 
which they had not participated 
in. They were all virulently paci-
fistic and anti-nationalistic. The 
revolution to which they aspired 
would have to be made without 
violence, by a radical transforma-
tion of the moral conscience, 
which would lay the foundations 
of a new humanism, necessary to 
build an egalitarian, fair and 
peaceful society. They wanted 
relationships between peoples to 
be placed under the responsibility 
of international author it ies, 
which would be able to resolve 
conflicts between States without 
recourse to war. These ideas were 
close to the programme of the 
International Institute of Intel-
lectual Cooperation, which already 
pref igured the pr inciples of 
UNESCO’s future doctrine in the 
1920s and 1930s. It was therefore 
natural for Lévi-Strauss to res-
pond favourably in 1949 to the 
invitation to participate in the 
activities of the Organization, 
whose programme embodied his 
own convictions so well.
After the disaster caused by 
Nazism, one of the priorities was 
to delegitimize  … 

6 … the ideology of the ine-
quality of races. UNESCO intended 
to promote the ideas that had 
previously been disputed by 
Nazism: the unity of mankind, the 
arbitrary nature of racial classifi-
cations, the equality of humans, 
the harmless effects of miscege-
nation and the instinct of coope-
ration as an essential property of 
humans. Such was the main mes-
sage of the first UNESCO declara-
tion on race (1950). 
Following this text, several 
brochures for the general public 
were quickly published, conceived 
by UNESCO’s Division for the Study 
of Race as an instrument of an 
“educational of fensive”. The 
contribution of Lévi-Strauss was 
Race and History. Its interest was 
to offer an argument that could 
remedy a major defect of UNESCO’s 
anti-racist doctrine. What good 
was it – as Lévi-Strauss said – to 
establish that no biological data 
confirmed the idea of the inequa-
lity of “races”, if one allowed 
the belief in inequality in its 
cultural dimension to endure, 
by which the conviction that 
societies are not able to make 
equivalent contributions to the 
common heritage of civiliza-
tion remained intact? The solu-
tion proposed by Lévi-Strauss 
consisted in showing that the 
ability to make cultural pro-
gress was not linked to the 
superiority of one society com-
pared to others, but rather to 
the aptitude of everyone to 
establish mutual exchanges 
with others. Thus, by making 
exchanges the fundamental 
condition for progress, Race 
and History was in perfect har-
mony with the ideology of coope-
ration, whose propagation UNESCO 
wished to promote.
… and disagreements
Nineteen years later, when he 
was invited to deliver the inaugu-
ral lecture of the International 
Year for Action to Combat Racism, 
Claude Lévi-Strauss had a much 
more critical view of UNESCO’s 
doctr ine than in 
1952. He confessed 
that he doubted that 
“ the  sp read  of 
knowledge and the 
development of com-
munication among 
human beings will 
some day let them 
live in harmony, 
accepting and res-
pecting their diver-
s it y”. The f ight 
against racism had 
proved ineffective – 
he concluded –, 
because the initial diagnosis, 
which was at the root of the 
Organization’s  programme, was 
erroneous right down to its fun-
damental principles: the racial 
form taken by intolerance was not 
a result of false ideas about race; 
it had a much deeper basis, whose 
ideas were just an ideological dis-
tortion, deployed to conceal the 
conflict that, according to Lévi-
Strauss, resulted from the demo-
graphic saturation of our planet.
The paradox is that Lévi-Strauss 
conceived this vision of the 
 harmful impact of demographic 
growth when he was led to take 
an interest in demographic ques-
tions at the International Social 
Science Council, where he had 
taken the initiative to organize 
several seminars on demography. 
Following the lecture, the disa-
greement with UNESCO’s doctrine 
became manifest. Lévi-Strauss felt 
that UNESCO was going astray by 
wanting to reconcile two opposed 
tendencies: civilising progress 
leads to growth in populations, 
which encourages cultural exchan-
ges, but the latter  …

their exchanges and keep their 
distance from each other. 
If the ideas that were conside-
red scandalous in 1971 could 
receive a warm welcome at UNESCO 
in 2005, it is because the doctrine 
of the Organization had changed 
during the quarter of a century, 
coming closer to the vision of 
which Claude Lévi-Strauss had 
been one of the first defenders. 
The founding project of UNESCO 
planned to deploy educational 
action on a worldwide scale, with 
the intention of achieving social 
progress and constructing a “new 
human unity”, to use an expres-
sion commonly used in the book 
Basic Education, Common Ground 
for all Peoples (1947): in fact, this 
programme consisted in wanting 
to impose the same cultural model 
everywhere, a model principally 
conceived by Westerners. At the 
end of the 1940s, such a unifying 
movement was held to be revolu-
tionary, progressive and redee-
ming. In 2005, the perspective of 
UNESCO had reversed by compari-
son with this initial conception. 
Unification now had … 
Lévi-Strauss, commenting on the 
incident and the reactions that it 
caused in 1983, in the preface to 
The View from Afar, in which the 
text of Race and Culture was inclu-
ded [published in English by Basic 
Books].
Diversity: a precious 
heritage to preserve
And yet, twenty-four years later, 
Claude Lévi-Strauss once more 
climbed onto the dais of the great 
auditorium of the UNESCO Buil-
ding, invited to make a speech on 
the occasion of the sixtieth anni-
versary of the Organization. This 
time, the lecture caused a reac-
tion that was diametrically oppo-
site to the previous one: the 
audience rose to its feet in a long 
and enthusiastic ovation. Parado-
xically, in 2005 Lévi-Strauss said 
more or less the same things as in 
1971. He repeated that the demo-
graphic explosion is a catastrophe 
that is responsible for our ills; 
that it leads to an impoverish-
ment of cultural diversity; that to 
maintain this diversity, it is 
necessary for peoples to limit 
… lead to the obliteration 
of cultural diversity, while at the 
same time demographic satura-
tion causes its inevitable share of 
intolerance and hostility towards 
peoples that have become rivals. 
In this situation, Lévi-Strauss 
came to maintain the right of 
every culture to remain deaf to 
the values of the Other, or even 
to contest them. This amounted 
to replacing the conception – 
defended by UNESCO – of humans 
spontaneously open to the Other 
and brought to cooperate with 
their fellow humans, by a concep-
tion of humans naturally inclined 
to be if not hostile, then at least 
reserved towards the Other. 
Xenophobia – in the very 
moderate form that Lévi-Strauss 
gave to it, that of insensitivity to 
the values of the Other – is here 
transformed from a fact of modi-
fiable culture into a fact of inera-
dicable nature. As a result, for 
Lévi-Strauss the UNESCO project 
became partially ineffectual, as 
one cannot hope to change unal-
terable human nature by action 
taken on its social element, 
through education and the fight 
against prejudice. 
These words shocked the liste-
ners. One can easily imagine how 
disconcerted UNESCO employees 
were, who, meeting Lévi-Strauss 
in the corridor after the lecture, 
expressed their disappointment at 
hearing the institutional articles 
of faith to which they thought 
they had the merit of adhering 
called into question. René Maheu, 
the Director General of UNESCO, 
who had invited Lévi-Strauss to 
give this lecture, seemed upset.

… the grim name of “globa-
lization”, and was seen as a threat 
to diversity, which was no longer 
perceived as an obstacle to pro-
gress, but as a  precious heritage 

to be preserved. Claude Lévi-
Strauss had been defending this 
point of view for decades. At the 
beginning of the twenty-first 
 century, he could note that 
UNESCO had joined him in this 
conviction. The humanist stance 
of the anthropologist and the mis-
sion of UNESCO have found a new 
 resonance. 
