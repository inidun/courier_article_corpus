Nothing short of a  small revolution occurr e d
d u ring President Bill Clinton’s visit to India last
M a r c h . In the rural heartland of  Rajasthan, a
dozen village women sat around on plush blue sofa s ,
in resplendent dress, to discuss issues of democracy
and power with the U. S .p r e s i d e n t . F i rst they intro-
duced themselve s : all are elected representat i ves of their
village councils (p a n c h ayat s) . Together they run a
wo m e n ’s dairy cooperat i ve and have initiated seve r a l
small credit and loan schemes for poor, l a n d l e s s
women in their communities. They had discarded
the age-old custom of hiding their veiled faces behind
home wa l l s.N ow, they explained, they had to go to the
bank to draw and desposit money, and to their distri c t
h e a d q u a rt e rs to attend monthly meetings.
E ven as they spoke in their nat i ve tongue, t h e
women freely used English words such as ‘ l o a n ’ ,
‘ c r e d i t’ ,‘ I n t e rn e t ’ ,‘ p u b l i c ’ and ‘no confid e n c e ’ .T h e y
complained about the lack of jobs for their educat e d
s o n s , spoke about the need to open a school close by
for their adolescent daughters , and their ongoing fig h t
for drinking wat e r , better roads, seeds and fa rm i n g
tools for their villages.
A lingering debate
Some might like to dismiss this meeting as a cleve r
act of ‘ f e e l - g o o d ’ politics on the part of the President
or as a showcased stunt on the part of the Indian
g ove rn m e n t .But the meeting was really about wo m e n
e n t e ring politics and staying on. Along with some
million others across the country, these women are the
d a u g h t e rs of the 73rd and 74th amendments of the
Indian Constitution.Passed in 1993, these two amend-
ments oblige all states to reserve one third of seats in
the three-tiered system of local gove rnment (village,
block and district leve l s ) — k n own as p a n c h ayati ra j—
to wo m e n .Elected directly by and from among the vil-
l a g e rs , the p a n c h ayat s can make decisions concern i n g
a wide range of fie l d s , from agriculture to health,
e m p l oyment and pri m a ry educat i o n .
In a short time, women have shown their potential
to wield power effectively at the village level and chal-
lenge feudal traditions.According to some observe rs ,
this is one of the reasons why the passage of the
Wo m e n ’s Reservations Bill, which seeks to reserve
33 per cent of all seats in the national parliament and
s t ate assemblies to wo m e n , has been repeat e d l y
blocked in the parliament.F i rst put forward in 1996,
the bill was reintroduced in 1998 but lapsed follow i n g
the gove rn m e n t ’s fall the same ye a r. It was resur-
rected in December 1999 but has continued to creat e
h avoc in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the par-
l i a m e n t .There are only 43 women MPs in the curr e n t
Lok Sabha,out of a total figure of 543,and the majo-
rity are from the elite.
Opponents of the bill,which include the Rashtri ya
Ja n ata Dal and the Samajwadi Pa rty (both centre-left),
along with some constituents of the ruling coalition,
led by the Hindu nationalist Bharat i ya Ja n ata Pa rt y
( B J P ) , claim that the bill should include a sub-quota
for Other Backward Classes1 and Muslim wo m e n .
Otherwise they argue,the quotas will only promote the
interests of the elite.The debate has been characteri z e d
by an ugly display of male muscle and lung powe r: i n
one instance, the Speaker had to adjourn the House,
in another,opposing law m a k e rs grabbed the bill off  his
d e s k .M e a n w h i l e ,C o n gress (I) president Sonia Gandhi
staged a walkout with her party members protesting
against the delay in the bill’s passage.
As the debate lingers ,a number of organizations are
intent on highlighting the success of women in the p a n-
c h ayat s.They are also working hard to build up lea-
d e rship among the most marginalized gr o u p s ,n a m e l y
Dalit and Tribal communities, and to gi ve women a
better understanding of their powe rs and rights at
the local leve l .The Society for Pa rt i c i p at o ry Research
in Asia (PRIA) for example, helps to groom wo m e n
c a n d i d ates for elections through education and trai-
ning and gi ves p a n c h ayat r e p r e s e n t at i ves the oppor-
tunity to meet with their counterp a rts from other
s t at e s.At another leve l , these organizations are seeking
to mobilise women to vo t e , and if need be, stand up
against election malpractices, such as giving bribes or
d i s t ri buting liquor to win vo t e s.
A recent study prepared by the Multiple A c t i o n
Research Group (MARG), a Delhi-based NGO,
concluded that the constitutional amendments have
indeed acted as a catalyst for gr e ater part i c i p ation by
women in gove rn a n c e , but the legi s l ation now needs
to be fin e - t u n e d : women should be gi ven more than
a single term in a reserved constituency to make a real
d i f f e r e n c e ,and eve ry effort should be made to prov i d e

1 . Other Backward Classes account for 52 per cent of India’s
p o p u l at i o n .They belong to kinship groups that are entitled to
c e rtain benefits because they are considered disadva n t a g e d ,
although less so than ‘scheduled castes’ (previously referred to
as untouchables) and ‘scheduled tri b e s ’ .
In a short time, women 
have shown their potential 
to wield power effectively 
at the village level and challenge
feudal tra d i t i o n s

them with literacy training.A separate study conducted
in three states on the gove rn m e n t ’s behalf by the
Centre for Wo m e n ’s Development Studies also high-
lighted the fact that the reservations had benefit e d
women from the Other Backward Classes.
Despite this, the barri e rs to part i c i p ation remain
s i z e a b l e . Rural areas are plagued by illiteracy and
p ove rt y, and pat ri a r c hy remains deeply entrenched.
Practices such as wife beating and dow ry deaths are still
p r e va l e n t .F u rt h e rm o r e ,as Ela Bhat t , the founder of the
S e l f - E m p l oyed Wo m e n ’s A s s o c i ation (SEWA) points
o u t , rural women do not represent a unified gr o u p.
C a s t e , clan and family considerations still ove rs h a d ow
political and gender-based pri o rities for large numbers
of women in rural areas. As such she say s , wo m e n
p a n c h ayat m e m b e rs are easily manipulat e d ,coerced and
coopted by their male counterp a rt s.A l s o, d r e s s ,e l e c-
tion campaign meetings and strat e gies for women are
still often decided by male members of the fa m i l y.
Reaching a critical mass
Feminist economist Devki Jain feels that political
e m p owe rment through affirm at i ve action is essen-
tial for women to ‘break this hard-rock of pat ri a r c hy.’
There has been much debate in the country about
whether illiterate rural women have the skills to stand
for elections and take offic e .The late Gita Mukherjee,
a Communist Pa rty of India member and six-time MP
from West Bengal, who headed the special parlia-
m e n t a ry committee on the Reservations Bill, r e p e a-
tedly asserted that the first step was to allow wo m e n
to break into politics; their awareness would auto-
m atically ri s e .The p a n c h ayati ra j i n s t i t u t i o n s , she said,
are to be valued as the real nurs e ries of political lea-
d e rship  for wo m e n .Pove rty and violence, she stressed,
can only be fought against effectively if women form
a critical mass in all decision-making bodies, from vil-
lage p a n c h ayat s to the parliament.
It may seem ironic that Madhu Kishwa r ,an activist
and editor of the Delhi-based feminist journal M a n u s h i,
is one of the bill’s cri t i c s.She argues that party leaders
will merely flood the reserved constituencies with the
“Bibi (wife) Beti (daughter) bri g a d e .” With the Fo ru m
for Democratic Reform , an umbrella organization of
wo m e n ’s gr o u p s , she has proposed an altern at i ve bill
t h at would make it legally binding for political part i e s
to present women as one third of their total candidat e s
and to gi ve proport i o n ate tickets to those from Dalit and
B a c k ward Classes. H owe ve r , M u k h e r j e e ’s long time
a s s o c i ate Bidya Munshi has criticized the proposal,c l a i-
ming that women are likely to be relegated to seat s
where political parties are unlikely to win.
S t i l l , despite entrenched pat ri a r c hy, there are
obvious signs of change,e ven if they seem anecdotal.
The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, D i g v i j ay
S i n g h , recently organized a meeting with women in
B h o p a l .C h a i rs were laid out for the ministers and high
o f ficials and mats on the floor for elected wo m e n
r e p r e s e n t at i ve s. As the meeting began, R e m m e b a i , a
t ribal woman stood up and questioned the chief
m i n i s t e r: “ You keep talking about wo m e n ’s equality
and reservations for wo m e n .We are in politics now, t h e
people have elected us. Is there a shortage of chairs in
your city?”A hundred ye a rs ago Remmebai and her
family would have been hung from trees for their
a u d a c i t y. But the chief minister thanked her humbly
for raising the issue and the next day all of them sat on
similar chairs. ■
