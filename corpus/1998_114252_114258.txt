Sugarcoating  
An educational programme in Cairo’s ‘garbage villages’ attracts
girls with promises of income while teaching literacy and self-
esteem along the way
■
The trick is to get them in the door.
Only then can the learning and social
change begin.
T h at ’s the strategy employed by the
Association for the Protection of the Envi-
ronment (APE), a non-gove rnmental orga-
nization which for more than ten years has
worked to improve the lives of girls and
young women living in the garbage collec-
tion communities that skirt the edges of the
Egyptian capital, Cairo.
The mission of the APE project was to
offer educat i o n , l i t e r a cy training and social
e m p owe rment to young girls living in an
e nvironment where all three were often in
s h o rt supply. But the project’s ori gi n a l i t y
(and the key to its success, according to its
f o u n d e rs) was the inform a l ,n o n - t r a d i t i o n a l
way that it went about achieving those goals.
Young girls came to the project seeking
nothing more than a chance to earn a little
side money for their families by we av i n g
rags into rugs and tapestri e s.Along the way,
they found themselves learning unexpec-
ted lessons on literacy, hygiene, child care
and self-sufficiency.
“They come here to make money and
they learn unconsciously,” s ays long-time
p r o gramme volunteer Samara A bu Seif. “ I t
works because it’s a part of their world—
not just something imposed on them by
well-meaning outsiders.”
Life in the garbage villages (see box )
o f f e rs women few educational or social
o p p o rt u n i t i e s. Running the garbage collec-
tion routes is pri m a rily the domain of fat h e rs
and sons, while mothers and daughters
manually sort the garbage and clean and
prepare the recyclable wa s t e .Young girls may
a c c o m p a ny their fat h e rs on collection routes
p rior to pubert y, but at that point cultural
n o rms dictate that they stay at home.T h e y
usually receive little or no formal educa-
t i o n — families who can afford to send their
children to school send the boy s. Girls are
often married off at the age of fifteen or
yo u n g e r , with little or no say in the process,
and are expected to begin bearing children
i m m e d i at e l y.“ E m p owe ring girls here is ve ry
d i f f i c u l t , because they’re not used to say i n g
‘ n o ’ or acting in their own interests,” s ay s
APE volunteer Shadia Iskander.
APE chose to frame its educat i o n a l
e f f o rts within the context of an income-
g e n e r ating activity. “When a girl bri n g s
back a part of the family income hers e l f,
she has more personal pride and has earn e d
a gr e ater say in her own life,” s ays A bu Seif.
The organizers focused on young unmar-
ried girls,reasoning that it would be easier
to implement mental and emotional change
before they become bound up in the child-
bearing and work cycle.The first group of
r e c ruits for the ru g - we aving school we r e
selected from gr a d u ates of a literacy school
attached to the local church. Later pupils
‘ When a girl contributes to the family income, she has more
pride in herself and has earned a greater say in her life’
were selected more randomly from among
adolescent girls found squatting on their
haunches and sorting garbage manually.
Some mothers baulked at letting their
daughters take part in this mysterious pro-
gr a m m e , but the organizers emphasized
they would have the opportunity to bring in
up to 40 Egyptian pounds (US $12) per
m o n t h , and that the flexible progr a m m e
schedule would allow them to continue
their household garbage separation duties.
“At first we had a lot of trouble convincing
families to let the girls come here,” s ays A bu
Seif. “Now we have a waiting list.”
When they joined the progr a m m e , gi r l s
found themselves presented with multiple
learning opportunities.The importance of
p e rsonal hy giene and appearance wa s
emphasized.“We told them from the start,
‘Come each day clean.We aving a clean ru g
means coming in clean clothes and wo r-
king in a clean env i r o n m e n t ’ ,” A bu Seif
Cutting with scissors provides handy training for
using pencils in literacy lessons.

says.
L e a rning how to we ave the rags (scraps
d o n ated from dress fa c t o ries) required ini-
t i at i ve and independent thinking.Wo r k i n g
the loom encouraged patience and discipline.
Quality control inspectors made deductions
from a gi r l ’s pay if there were any imperfec-
tions in the ru g — e n c o u r a ging precision and
attention to detail.E ven the choice of colours
for the rugs stimulated creativity and pers o n a l
e x p r e s s i o n . “The manipulat i ve skill of using
s c i s s o rs to cut the rags proved to be vital as a
p r e p a r ation for the use of pencils in literacy
c l a s s e s ,” s ays founding project member Dr.
Laila Iskander Kamel.
Patience and
discipline
L i t e r a cy and basic arithmetic classes we r e
o p t i o n a l , but the programme organizers we r e
adept at presenting incentives to encourage
the girls to at t e n d . “ We would tell them to
measure an eighty-centimetre piece of cloth,
and they wo u l d n ’t know what eighty wa s ,s o
we ’d say ‘ Well we have these classes ove r
h e r e ’ , ” A bu Seif remembers. “In order to
r e c e i ve their wages they had to sign their
n a m e s , and if they couldn’t do that , it meant
another lesson.”
There were plenty of financial incentive s
to learn to read. Rugs with words on them
can be sold for more money at hotels and
t o u rist bazaars , so girls are paid extra for each
l e t t e r — t wo Egyptian pounds for English let-
t e rs , three pounds for more difficult A r a b i c
l e t t e rs.“Local sales events held in fa n cy hotels
and pri vate gardens were perceived as a big
o u t i n g,” s ays Dr. K a m e l . “Girls who could
not read the price list could not look after the
stands at such eve n t s.Thus literacy,or at least
the ability to read the price list,became a goal
with a tangible rewa r d .”
Education 
against excision
The girls also received lessons on
female hy gi e n e , excision and the benefit s
of waiting until they were at least seve n t e e n
or eighteen before having children.
In its ten-year existence, p r o gr a m m e
o r g a n i z e rs estimate they have trained more
than 700 gi r l s , about a quarter of whom
have achieved functional literacy. Surveys
of the graduates, according to Dr. Kamel,
reveal important shifts in their social atti-
t u d e s. Sixty-four per cent of the wo m e n
said they were practising family planning
and 70 per cent of the single girls said that
when they got married they would not sub-
ject their daughters to excision.
The ori ginal ru g - we aving progr a m m e
has since been expanded to include other
business ve n t u r e s : a paper recycling opera-
tion and a patchwork quilting programme
that focuses on older,married women.
Perhaps the surest sign of the progr a m-
m e ’s success is that the ru g - we aving school is
not only self-sufficient, but run almost enti-
rely by a staff of programme gr a d u at e s.A P E

But changing the thinking of young gi r l s
in Mokattam is only part of the equat i o n .A
d a u g h t e r ’s new-found literacy and empo-

duce serious discord, unless her family goes
along with the progr a m m e . For this reason,
APE wo r k e rs make sure the families are kept
i nvo l ve d . Like the literacy progr a m m e ,
potentially unpopular ideas such as delay i n g

c h i l d b i rth until the gi r l ’s body can handle
the strain are sugarcoated in financial incen-
t i ve s.Y vonne Azer tells how the progr a m m e
often collects funds for a 500-pound “ gi f t ”
for young girls who wait until they’re eigh-
teen before having children.
APE vo l u n t e e rs and alumni acknow l e d g e
t h at a handful of literacy classes and some
looms may not be enough to overcome social
n o rms that have existed for generat i o n s. B u t
they have their eye on the future, not only of
the programme gr a d u at e s ,but of their daugh-
t e rs and gr a n d d a u g h t e rs.
“ E ven if we don’t change the gi r l ’s
situation within her own family,” says one
s t a f f e r ,“ we know they’re going to take these
new ideas to their new families when they
get married and pass them on to future
generations.” ■
