Sacred mountains
by Edwin Bernbaum
Mount Everest,
the world's highest
peak (8,846 metres)
is located in
Sagarmatha
National Park
(Nepal), which
shelters several rare
animal species such
as the snow leopard
and the lesser panda.
(Natural site, 1979).
Sacred mountains are the
World Heritage sites that
enshrine the highest physical and
spiritual values. For many the sight
of a distant peak looming over
lowlands, floating above the clouds,
reaching towards the stars, awakens
the spirit, evoking intimations of
divine mystery and splendour. As
the highest features of the land¬
scape, mountains have naturally
become associated with the highest
values and aspirations of cultures
and religious traditions around the
world.
Sacred mountains on the World
Heritage List range from the wild,
uninhabited glaciers of Mount St.
Elias on the remote border between
the Yukon and Alaska to the densely
populated buildings and streets of
Jerusalem centred around the Temple
mount. Cultural monuments such
as Angkor and Borobudur in

Southeast Asia are based on architec¬
tural representations of a mythical
mountain at the centre of the uni¬
verse in Buddhist and Hindu cos¬
mology. Two of the first three
World Heritage sites to receive the
new designation of Associative Cul¬
tural Landscapes landscapes whose
natural elements have powerful reli¬
gious, artistic or cultural associa¬
tions are sacred mountains: Uluru
in Australia and Tongariro in New
Zealand.
Sacred mountains highlight
some of the most impressive natural
landscapes on the World Heritage
An amazing urban
creation of the Inca
empire at its height,
Machu Picchu
(Peru) was built
2,430 metres above
sea level in the Andes
on a site of
outstanding beauty.

site, 1983).

Ayers Rock
(Australia), the
sacred mountain of
Australian
Aborigines. This
spectacular monolith
in central Australia
is part of Uluru-Kata
Tjuta National Park,
which also contains
another exceptional
geological
formation, Mount
Olga, and several
unique desert
ecosystems. (Natural
and cultural site,
1987, 1994).
< Mount Athos (Greece), a rocky
promontory jutting into the Aegean Sea
from the peninsula of Chalcidice has
been a centre of Orthodox Christian
spirituality since the 11th century. Today
the "Holy Mountain" consists of some 20
monasteries and 700 houses, cells and
hermitages. Its school of painting
influenced the history of Orthodox art.

the largest isolated rock in the
world, to the summit of Mount
Everest, the highest point on earth.
Mountain sites such as Nanda Devi
National Park in India, Kilimanjaro
National Park in Africa and Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park contain
some of the most diverse environ¬
ments and ecosystems found any¬
where on the planet: rivers, lakes,
jungles, forests, deserts, grasslands,
tundra, lava flows and glaciers.
Many sacred mountains on the
World Heritage List preserve cul¬
tural as well as natural treasures.
Orthodox Christian monasteries

Mount Tai (or

above sea level) in
China's Shandong

venerated for over
3,000 years. The
monuments on its
slopes blend

of other World Heritage mountain



sites function as the equivalent of
sacred scriptures, recording the
actions of deities and heroes who
created and shaped the world. The
volcanic cone of Ngaurohoe in
Tongariro National Park tells the
story of a priest who came to New
Zealand with the divine ancestors
of the Maori people and whose ser¬
vant froze to death on the spot.
Sacred mountains have also
played important roles in history,
literature and art. People who revere
them feel deeply motivated to make
sure they are protected. Some of
these sites have become important
centres for preserving traditional
knowledge about the environment
and valuable gene pools for replac¬
ing plant and animal species lost
elsewhere. The protection of sacred
mountains associated with impor¬
tant traditional values and identities
also strengthens the societies that
venerate them.
The modern environmental
movement owes much of its origin
and continued vitality to the idea
of preserving pristine mountain
areas as places for people to seek
spiritual and physical renewal.
