On paper, the world is governed by
sovereign states, each exercising exclusive
control within its own territory. In reality,
millions of people live in a political vacuum
in which the state exercises little or no
meaningful authority. This “sans État”
condition includes ungoverned urban slums,
forgotten rural communities, a n d , m o s t
d r a m a t i c a l l y, the growing zones of state
c o l l a p s e.
Observers rightfully point to this trend
with alarm.They cite the spread of “ c h a o s ”
as a global security threat—a breeding
ground for lawlessness, organized crime,
w a r l o r d i s m , humanitarian crises, a n d
unchecked disease. I n d e e d , this crisis of
governance is an underlying source of much
of the misery of underdevelopment and
violent crime that many of the world’s
poorest people endure.
Fo r t u n a t e l y, the communities living in
these zones of state retrenchment are not
p a s s i v e. Their towns and neighbourhoods
are usually far from anarchic. From rural
Somalia to the urban slums of Haiti, t h e s e
stateless communities are devising
innovative ways to organize themselves to
provide a variety of basic services.The most
ambitious of these spontaneous forms of
self-governance even conduct quasi-
diplomatic relations with the external world.
International development agencies know
this well—local polities have become
important partners at the grassroots level
where the state is unable or unwilling to
exercise authority.
This trend poses a broader historical
q u e s t i o n . Is the retrenchment and even
collapse of some states a temporary
phenomenon related to the end of the Cold
Wa r, or is it the beginning of the end of the
era of state-centric global politics itself? It
has often been argued that sovereign states
were an inappropriate, western imposition
on the colonized world. What we are now
w i t n e s s i n g, these critics add, are local
communities shrugging off this failing
colonial legacy, remaking polities and
indigenous systems of governance which
better match local realities and meet local
n e e d s. Others add that the forces of
globalization are also accelerating the
erosion of state authority and sovereignty.
Does this imply that the state is actually
being replaced by these institutions of self-
governance? Here one must proceed with
c a u t i o n . In most cases, they are very limited
and fragile institutions, located in slums and
war zones.S e c o n d ,despite its irrelevance as
a functional polity in some parts of the
w o r l d , the state is likely to remain with us for
a very long time.It remains the cornerstone
of the current international political system;
international organizations and law are
s t a t e - c e n t e r e d , and personal travel
documents are state-based. The world at
large is simply not equipped formally to
interact with and recognize alternative
p o l i t i e s.The irony, t h e n , is that for some of
the world’s people, the state is
simultaneously irrelevant and indispensable.
I n s t e a d , we are witnessing a trend
toward a two-tiered system of political life
in parts of the Third Wo r l d . On one level,
there will be “paper states”—thin, f o r m a l ,
and weak juridical structures—which will
continue to lay claim to a sovereignty they
cannot actually exercise, but which the
international community requires and will
continue to recognize.Beneath the surface
of the paper state, a second tier of political
life—a messy, flu i d , i n n o v a t i v e, o f t e n
informal mosaic of local polities—will
continue to evolve, and will provide at least
some of the public goods which
communities desire.They will include local
non-governmental organizations, r e l i g i o u s
m o v e m e n t s, neighbourhood groups,
business associations, clans and mafia ,a n d
will often draw extensively on international
r e s o u r c e s. The challenge to the external
world will be learning to work constructively
with this increasingly complex political
development in some Third World settings.
