21st century renamed itself 14th century.
INTERVIEW BY LOUISE CORRADINI
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST



Rise of a new watchdog 
in Latin A m e r i c a
Buoyed by the spread of democracy, Latin America’s press is fast gaining in influence, boldness and
credibility, says journalism professor Mario Diament1. The technology revolution stands to make the
process irreversible
L atin America has been through
quite a few profound political
t ransitions over the past two
d e c a d e s. What part has the
p ress played in this process?  Is
t h e re a kind of regional model that defin e s
its relationship with political power?
You can’t really talk about a
“regional model,” but of similar
e x p e r i e n c e s.According to conventional
wisdom,the more democracy you have,
the more press freedom there is, but this
still varies from one country to the next.
In the past, a sizeable part of the Latin
American press had close ties to political
and economic interests through its
owners. Those interests routinely took
precedence over journalistic impartiality.
But during the 1970s, journalists became
very politicized. Many became
subversive and partisan writers,
distorting the role of the press and badly
undermining its credibility. However in
the 1980s, as democracy spread across
the region and a new generation of
journalists less marked by past events
came to the fore, a very refreshing and
positive change took place.
Can you give a few examples?
Mexico and Guatemala are two of
the most interesting cases.The Chiapas
uprising in Mexico had the effect of
cutting short press allegiance to the
ruling party, the PRI, which went hand-
in-hand with rampant corruption.
Chiapas came on so suddenly that the
government of President Carlos Salinas
d i d n ’t have time to put together a media
strategy to deal with the situation.As a
result,part of the Mexican press began
reporting very openly on events. I think
i t ’s safe to say that to a large extent, t h i s
new attitude on the part of the press
sounded the death knell of one-party
domination and opened the way for
Vicente Fo x ’s victory in the presidential
elections in 2000.
In Guatemala, during the short-lived
seizure of full powers by President Jo r g e
Serrano on May 25,1993, censorship was
imposed and the press defied the
government for the first time. Th e
newspaper Siglo Ve i n t i u n o ( 2 1 s t
Century) renamed itself Siglo Catorce
(14th Century) and ran black columns in
the place of censored material, e x p o s i n g
the government’s attempt to stop the
press from reporting on events.
Colombia should also be mentioned:
many journalists have and continue to
risk their lives there reporting amid
threats from guerrilla forces,p a r a m i l i t a r y
groups and drug-lords.
In the past,the Latin American press has
often been submissive and engaged in
s e l f - c e n s o rs h i p, sometimes to the point of
complicity with the powers in place.Why
has this changed?
In my eyes, the two most important
factors are the return to democracy and
the revolution in technology.The South
American dictatorships of the 1970s
created a spineless and obliging press, b u t
as these regimes began to crumble, the
media became more independent.Wi t h
the return to democracy, j o u r n a l i s t s
became even more daring and
inquisitive.
In some places, such as A r g e n t i n a ,
the press’ credibility and influence grew
as political parties became discredited.
During the 1989-99 rule of President
Carlos Menem, the Argentine press
published a remarkable series of
investigations into corruption and
money-laundering that shook the
g o v e r n m e n t .At one point, opinion polls
showed that the public trusted the press
more than any other institution in the
country, including the Catholic Church.
The revolution in technology, which
began with photocopies and faxes and
moved onto satellite TV and the
I n t e r n e t , has diversified information
sources to the point that nobody can
seriously hope to impose any kind of
c o n t r o l . The relative cheapness of the
technology has made the spread of
information more democratic than ever
before. ■
