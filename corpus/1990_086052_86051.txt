U
HOW YOUNG PEOPLE SEE UNESCO TODAY
Thirty young people
from twenty-three
countries took part in a
seminar on Unesco and
its work held at
Unesco's Paris HQ from
2 to 13 October 1989
(see box page 50).
We publish here
extracts from a letter
which they wrote
to the Director-General
of Unesco,
Mr. Federico Mayor. TV^
These two weeks have given us
the chance to learn much about
Unesco. There is no doubt that our
work in the different youth organi¬
zations to which we belong will
benefit greatly. At the end of this
seminar we should like to draw in
broad outline our picture of Unesco
as it is today.
An intergovernmental organiza¬
tion. By definition, Unesco brings
together a large number of states
and provides a forum for dialogue
and the exchange of ideas and infor¬
mation with a view to carrying
out the objectives defined in its
Constitution. But inherent in the very
diversity of Unesco's objectives and
constituency there is a risk that a
bureaucracy may emerge and come
between the different parties
involved. We feel that there is the
danger of a breakdown in commu¬
nication between the populations of
the member states and the Unesco
secretariat. We therefore think it
essential that the Organization should
maintain close contact with its grass
roots.
Neutrality. Unesco cannot intervene
directly in the affairs of member
states in order to achieve its aims. But
we feel that this neutrality should not
prevent the Organization from pro¬
testing when it is evident that the
¡deals which it defends are not being
respected by a member state. To
maintain its credibility, particularly in
the eyes of oppressed populations,
Unesco must continue to point the
way towards a just and humane
society, independent of the vicissi¬
tudes of world politics.
The commitment of member
states. The resolutions taken within
Unesco do not always seem to be ap¬
plied by member states. We should
like to see the member states as
enthusiastic and involved as the 49

Unesco secretariat, and especially
that they should be active in the
promotion and teaching of human
rights. We should like a more effec¬
tive follow-up and a more stringent
evaluation of the action taken by
member states in connection with
programmes drawn up by Unesco
experts.
A very ambitious programme. An
extremely wide range of tasks is as¬
signed to Unesco by its Constitution
and the Organization's programmes
are very comprehensive. There is a
danger that resources will be spread
too thinly. Some of us would prefer
Unesco to concentrate its efforts
more, while others think that all
Unesco's tasks are important and that
none should be abandoned. In any
case greater efficiency should be
sought, for example by strengthening
co-operation with non-governmental
organizations, a potential source of
energy which is far from negligible.
Youth. Unesco is an international
organization which gives a hearing to
young people. But most young
people are unaware of the existence
of an international secretariat which
is interested in their activities. We
should like young people of all
countries to have access to more
information about those Unesco
activities which concern them. We
should also like to see regular con¬
tact between Unesco and young
people. Finally, we should like to
see the development of structures
within which young people can take
part ¡n regional, national and inter¬
national activities. Unesco should
encourage the development of a
social conscience among young
people of all countries, so that they
will consider themselves to be citizens
of the world.
Information. Unesco has a very
important role to play in the dissemi¬
nation of information. We should like
to see a greater media coverage of
Unesco's many activities so as to
familiarize the public with the ideals
of the Organization. This public infor¬
mation effort should be carried out
both in the developing countries and
in the industrialized countries, as the
latter seem to us to be relatively
unaware of Unesco and its work. We
also feel that the wealth of documen¬
tation produced by Unesco experts
could be more widely distributed.
People in all parts of the world should
have access to it.
Finally, we realize that carrying
out such a complex task is bound
to be difficult. However, we believe
that the task is worthwhile and
full of promise. We all believe in
it and undertake to further it through
our work with the young people
whom we represent. We wish to
assure you that we sincerely appreci¬
ate the opportunity to take part
in this seminar, and should like to
thank all the Unesco staff who have
given us a warm and friendly
welcome.
