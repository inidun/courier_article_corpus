International campaigns to safeguard
the cultural heritage of mankind
BY ABDELKADER BRAHIM ERRAHMANI
FcOLLOwiNG the rescue of the temples
of Abu Simbel in Upper Egypt, the
greatest archaeological salvage oper¬
ation of all time, and the reconstruc¬
tion of the great Buddhist sanctuary
of Borobudur in Indonesia, Unesco
is now campaigning for the safeguard
of twenty-four other groups of monu¬
ments and sites which form part of
the universal cultural heritage.
Some of these campaigns are
already far advanced. One of them
is that for the restoration of Venice,
which was subsiding into the waters
of its lagoon. Tourists can still admire
the celebrated Byzantine horses rear¬
ing on the outside gallery of St.
Mark's Basilica, but they are
reproductions of the originals, which
have been restored and are now
sheltered from the rigours of the
Venetian climate.
For over fifteen years, painstaking
work has been carried out at the site
of ancient Carthage, where ar¬
chaeologists from all over the world
have been helping their Tunisian col¬
leagues to unearth the ruins of the
ancient Roman city and Punic capi¬
tal, once thought to have been com¬
pletely destroyed.
In Pakistan, much progress has
been made in a long-term project to
protect the site of Moenjodaro, the
"City of the Dead" of the ancient
Indus civilization, from flooding and
corrosion by salts.
Off the coast of Senegal, restora¬
tion work has been going on for the
past ten years on the island of Gorée,
once a "centre of the slave trade. Today
the lustre of its colonial architecture
can once again be admired in streets
edged with bougainvillea.
Ouadane, Chinguetti, Tichit and
Oualata, four medieval cities on an
ancient caravan route through
Mauritania, are threatened by desert
encroachment. They are fighting to
survive as testimony to seven centu¬
ries of civilization.
In Haiti, efforts are being made to
preserve three monuments, La
Citadelle de la Ferrière, the Sans
Souci Palace, and the Ramiers site,
historic witnesses to a resolute desire
for independence.
In Sri Lanka three sacred places
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruva and
Kandyare being restored, together
with the ancient city of Sigiriya,
famed for its rock paintings.
The first royal capital of Thailand,
Sukhothai ("dawn of happiness"),
is gradually recovering its serenity.
International solidarity is supporting
efforts to restore over 800 endan¬
gered monuments and sites in
Nepal's Kathmandu Valley.
Other extensive safeguard opera¬
tions involving the preservation of
historic sites and districts and their in¬
tegration into the fabric of modern
urban life are being carried out at
Istanbul, Turkey; the Plaza Vieja in
Havana, Cuba; the holy city of Fez,
Morocco; the old cities of Sana'a (the
"pearl of Arabia") and Shibam, and
the Wadi Hadramaout valley in the
Republic of Yemen; the site of An¬
tigua in Guatemala, once a centre of
the Maya civilization; and San Fran¬
cisco de Lima, one of Peru's finest ar¬
chitectural ensembles of seventeenth-
century colonial architecture.
Hue, the ancient capital of Viet
Nam and witness to the country's cul¬
tural and artistic creativity, has
suffered from the ravages of both
time and warfare.
Other safeguarding campaigns
concern the rock-hewn churches of
the Göreme Valley in the heart of
Anatolia, Turkey, and Kotor in Yu¬
goslavia, which is the site of Mon¬
tenegro's most outstanding historical
monuments and was seriously
damaged by an earthquake in April
1979.
On the borders of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay, efforts are
being made to save the artistic
heritage of the Jesuit Missions of
the Guaranis which date from Span¬
ish and Portuguese colonial times.
The site of the Acropolis in Athens,
Greece, is threatened by industrial
pollution.
Malta, a crossroads of cultures, is
committed to saving its citadels,
towns, medinas, tombs and
catacombs from the ravages of time
and from damage caused by man.
The Buddhist temple of Paharpur
Vihara and the Mosque City of
Bagerhat in Bangladesh are also in
need of international assistance.
An appeal for international solidar¬
ity has been launched for the
safeguarding of four Ethiopian sites
and monuments: Tiya and its stelae,
the last vestiges of a mysterious and
little-known civilization of 6,000 years
ago; Aksum, the African Babylon;
Harare, the fortress of the Red Sea
sultans; and the rock-hewn churches
of Lalibela, traditionally thought to
date back to the reign of Menelik I,
legendary son of Solomon and the
Queen of Sheba.

Finally, in Egypt there is a project
to construct two museums: a museum
of Egyptian civilization in Cairo, and
a museum in Aswan for the master¬
pieces of Nubian art.
How campaigns
are launched
An international campaign originates
in a resolution adopted by Unesco
member states during a General
Conference.
The Unesco Secretariat then carries
out technical studies for use in
drawing up a plan of action which
defines the safeguard, restoration
and presentation operations, and
their cost.
This plan of action is submitted for
approval to Unesco's Executive
Board, which then authorizes the
Director-General to launch an appeal
to international solidarity. Such ap¬
peals solicit technical and financial
support from member states, govern¬
mental and non-governmental or¬
ganizations, foundations, public and
private institutions, and from intellec¬
tuals, artists, writers and the general
public.
The Director-General's appeal is
accompanied by promotional activi¬
ties designed to inform the public
about the specific problems involved
in each campaign and encourage
people to contribute. All contribu¬
tions are voluntary. There is no pro
vision in Unesco's budget to finance
major infrastructure work. Local and
international experts form a joint
committee or working group respon¬
sible for the implementation of the
plan of action and the allocation of
funds received as a result of the
Director-General's appeal.
The twenty-four current campaigns
call for national and international
investment estimated at US$1.5
billion. This indicates the scale of the
challenge to international solidarity.
The challenge does not end there.
Safeguarding campaigns give rise to
a wide range of social and economic
problems involving the development
of sites and the redefinition of the ar¬
chitectural functions of buildings and
their place within the urban frame¬
work. Far more than aesthetic inter¬
vention is involved. Safeguarding
campaigns lead inevitably to the res¬
tructuring of human settlements,
since newly-restored ancient build¬
ings must be integrated into the
fabric of modern life, and allotted
new functions which preserve their
essential character while meeting the
needs of the communities of which
they form a vital part.
