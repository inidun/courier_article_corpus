Th i r t y - five years after it was founded,O b j e-
tivo has grown into one of the most thri-
ving educational enterprises in Brazil,w i t h
over 400 schools located all around the
country and a university.Wh a t ’s the secret?
Objetivo’s aim is to see that students get through,
and in this the company succeeds. Fewer than one
percent of pupils at the primary and secondary
level repeat a year, far below the national average,
which stands at 21.3 percent in primary school and
40.1 percent at the secondary level, according to
Education Ministry figures.
While the share of students in the private sector
is declining  (10.5 percent in 1996 to 8.2 percent in
2 0 0 0 ) , Objetivo reaches close to 500,000 pupils from
kindergarten to university level. Besides its own
schools (13 in São Paulo alone, where its head-
quarters are located), the company has franchises in
places as far apart as Brasilia, G o i a n i a , M a n a u s,
Campinas and Bauru.
O b j e t i v o ’s pedagogical coordinator,Alfredo Fe r-
n a n d e s,attributes the company’s success to the sound
reputation it has built over the years.“ Th e r e ’s a posi-
tive atmosphere in our schools,w e ’re always open to
a dialogue with students and society at large,”he says.
What has become a national network began in
1965 as a preparatory course for the entrance exam
required by Brazilian universities.This notched up
a pass rate of almost 90 percent and its fame quickly
g r e w. In 1970, spurred by the good state of its
finances, Objetivo founded a regular school,since
university entrance coaching was not part of the
national education system. “ We wanted to offer
quality education so we came up with our own acti-
vities and methods,” says Fernandes.
Objetivo grew rapidly. In 1972, its first faculties
were inaugurated,and sixteen years later, it was offi-
cially recognized as a full-fledged university (UNIP),
which today counts 53,000 students. In 1975 Objetivo
set up its first kindergarten and primary schools.
The schools accept both good pupils and those
with learning diffic u l t i e s.“After much discussion,w e
decided to go for an open school with no strea-
m i n g, where everyone had a chance to express
themselves,” says Fernandes.“This openness is the
main difference between us and other private
schools.”
Ironically, Objetivo is criticized because it has
no entrance exam.“Because we made it easy for
children to get into our schools and stay there, we

O b j e t i v o : b rand-name schooling
A Brazilian chain of for-profit schools prides itself on a national network,
a pioneering use of technology and a high pass rate

were accused of having purely commercial inten-
t i o n s,” he says. In a country with widespread poverty,
Objetivo’s fees (between $215 and $355 a month
depending on the level) are certainly a sizeable
obstacle for many parents.
The high cost of tuition and the fact that the
project was started by people from outside the edu-
cation world made many experts suspicious of the
s c h o o l s. “I’m very much against commercializing
e d u c a t i o n ,” says Dermeval Saviani, professor of phi-
losophy and education history at the State Univer-
sity of Campinas.“Education is a social need that is
by nature incompatible with the private sector.”
Objetivo is a good example of this, he argues.
“ With the profits it makes from higher education, i t
has the money to  provide low-cost schooling.But this
is not happening. Because maintaining all its infra-
structure calls for major investment,Objetivo ignores
the poorest people.” He says this is a common failing
of all profit-making private schools, which are only
accessible to middle and upper-class children.
With an annual turnover of approximately $400
million,the company has a long tradition of inves-
ting in technology. It had the first school in Brazil to
use interactive video for teaching, and was the fir s t
to introduce computers in the classroom. N e a r l y
all its schools have computer rooms, libraries and
sports fie l d s, and offer extra-curricular activities
such as judo, music and visual arts.
“ This means we can escape from the routine
and learn more,” says 14-year-old Bianca Sgai
Fr a n c o. As well as having it own teaching mate-
r i a l s—t e x t b o o k s, computer software and CD-
R o m s—some schools are carrying out pioneer pro-
j e c t s.Two of them are linked to the environment:t h e
Sea School at Angra dos Reis, near Rio de Janeiro,
was founded in 1988 and offers courses in marine life
to pupils and teachers,while the Nature School,d e e p
in the Amazonian jungle, is run on similar lines.
Another attraction is the Talent Encourage-
ment Programme for children with exceptional
s k i l l s.A parent or teacher can ask for a gifted child
to be tested in order to take special classes in both
the social and natural sciences. “I enrolled my 11-
y e a r-old daughter in an Objetivo school because of
this programme,” says Maria Cecilia Novaes
Au g u s t o. “Now she’s doing robotics, t e c h n o l o g y
and art.It’s a very good programme.”
Tereza Cristina Matteis pays about 1,200 reales
($650) a month for the schooling of her three sons.“ I t ’s
a forward-looking educational system that keeps very
close contact with the children’s families,”she says. S i l-
vana Da Costa,who attended an Objetivo school and
now has three of her children there, says “ i t ’s very
open to the parents.” Given that her husband’s job has
meant living in eight of Brazil’s states, O b j e t i v o ’s
nationwide network has proved an invaluable asset.
Fe r n a n d e s, the chain’s pedagogical coordinator,
says the key difference between the schools and
the state system is the level of teacher training.“ I t ’s
a very serious problem in Brazil,” he says.Which is
why Objetivo offers all its teachers regular refresher
c o u r s e s.“Each year we organize at least five regional
meetings with teachers from other states,” s a y s
Deborah Cristina Catarinacho,who has taught Po r-
tuguese for the past 12 years. Quality control is also
s t r i c t ,with teachers around the country required to
use the course materials in exactly the same way.
“Objetivo draws you in,” says Adriana Ve n t u r i ,
a preschool teacher. “ We ’re a family where eve-
ryone encourages each other to go forward.” ■
