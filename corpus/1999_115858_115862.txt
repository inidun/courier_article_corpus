“ W h at ’s good for science is good for humanity.”
Until the end of the Cold Wa r , few people
dared challenge this dictum originating in the
p h i l o s o p hy of the Enlightenment and gi ven gr e at e r
force after the Second World Wa r. Despite the threat
of the nuclear holocaust which it had made possible,
science was widely seen as a beneficial force. I n
both East and West, it was invested with a sacred
mission—to guarantee the security and prosperity
of nations.
In the United Stat e s , the we a l t hy leader of the
“free wo r l d ” , the idea took root after 1945 that
people should trust the state and the scientists, a n d
t h at spending on basic (and military) research should
be unlimited. It was argued that pure science wo u l d
inevitably have applications that would contri bute to
p r o gress and social we l fa r e .U n i ve rsities and major
sources of funding, such as the National Science
Fo u n d ation and the va rious branches of the arm e d
f o r c e s , were left to decide on research pri o ri t i e s.

For many years, the political leaders and scientists of the
g reat powers called the shots in science. “Leave it to
u s,” they said to citizens. “ We ’ re working on your behalf,
for your security and your pro s p e r i t y.”
This tacit contract between science and society has
had its day. On the world economic battlefie l d , re s e a rc h
is increasingly geared to the market and technological
i n n o v a t i o n . The fro n t i e rs are becoming blurred between
l a b o ra t o r i e s, both public and private, and corpora t e
m a r keting services. In a situation in which science is
i n c reasingly re g a rded as a commercial re s o u rc e, how can
it yield benefits for all?

In France, people were also expected to trust the
a u t h o ri t i e s , which opted for a more diri gi s t e
a p p r o a c h .The state decided policy and chose stra-
tegic areas, and then administered and funded on
an ad hoc basis executing agencies such as the
N ational Centre for Scientific Research and the
Atomic Energy Commission.
These two models, which had the advantage
of leaving scientists with a degree of independen-
ce, were widely followed elsewhere in the world.
They boosted basic research, which produces
new knowledge with a wide range of applications.
But they also served to rubber-stamp massive
public spending for military and civil purposes.
And in this tacit agreement between scientists
and society there was a geographic and democra-
tic deficit, in the sense that science developed lar-
gely in a few urban centres as part of a national
f r a m e wo r k , and ordinary citizens were neve r
consulted. The direction of research was largely
decided by political and scientific elites and the
“ m i l i t a ry - i n d u s t rial complexe s ” of a few big
powers.
But the last 20 years have seen major changes
in the world of research. The state has lost its
capacity for initiative. Belief in progress is giving
rise to doubts and controversies. The prestige of
science,like that of state technocracies, has faded.
Its main preoccupations increasingly take
account of  private-sector interests, which these
days fund and carry out two-thirds of all research
in some industrialized countries.
This new situation has several causes. In the
1 9 7 0 s , the benefits of science and technology began
to be challenged, mainly by the env i r o n m e n t a l
movement and in the developing world. After the
Cold War ended, the strategic interests which had
accounted for huge gove rnment expenditures
changed and military spending dropped sharply.

Then the United States noticed with alarm that
Japan,where research was dominated by industry,
was scoring in advanced sectors such as inform at i o n
technology, electronics and new materials. As eco-
nomic interests came to the fore, the idea that bu s i-
ness was much more effective in ensuring people’s
we l fare than the political and scientific establishment
became widespread. In this struggle for competiti-
v i t y, science lost its supremacy to technologi c a l
“innovation”(pages 20-24).The main goal was to
come up with new products and innovatory pro-
duction methods.
The power of a nation now depends on its eco-
nomic performance—and therefore its capacity to
innovate.All stakeholders, including the state and
the unive rs i t i e s , are supposed to strengthen this
capacity. Research facilities have been rejigged to
t u rn out new products more quickly and more
cheaply (page 27). Scientists are valued less for
their disinterestedness than for their feel for market
e f fic i e n cy. B a rri e rs between public and pri vate sec-
tors have become blurred.Bridges have been built
b e t ween the two which scientists cross in increasing
n u m b e rs (page 20).The difference has also become
fuzzy between basic and applied research, which
now interact continually (page 23).The synergy is
especially close in high-tech companies, w h i c h
account for 40 per cent of private sector industrial
R&D in the rich countries.
These trends, which have developed with the
g l o b a l i z ation of world trade, h ave strengthened the
grip of the big three—the United Stat e s , Europe and
Japan—on research (pages 28-29). Some A s i a n
countries, such as China (page 32), are boosting
their capacity for innovat i o n , but whole regions are
being left out.Science outside the big three coun-
t ries registered significant advances at the begi n n i n g
of the century—in medicine, agriculture, natural
sciences and economics—and then grew strongly in
new independent stat e s. In the past few ye a rs ,
research activity has diminished in some Lat i n
American countries. It has collapsed in the former
Soviet bloc countries and is subject to “desertifi-
cation” in black Africa.
Meanwhile,research is being partly globalized
itself as international co-operation grows (again,
mainly between the big three and between Asian
c o u n t ri e s ) , if only because gove rnment spending on
research has been cut in each country (page 30).
The upheavals which have affected the world’s
4.5 million or so scientists and engi n e e rs have set off
lively debate. By trying to make science serve the
m a r k e t , is there not a risk of depriving most of
humanity of its benefits? By forcing unive rs i t i e s
and state-funded laborat o ries to increase their pro-
fit a b i l i t y, might we not kill off basic research, w h e r e
the public sector plays a key role? How can we
fight abuses of pat e n t i n g, which is no longer limited
to protecting the applications of research but now
extends to “privatizing”certain discoveries?
H ow can we fight the emergence of a culture of
s e c r e cy which threatens the free flow of know l e d g e
(pages 25-26)? How can we prevent whole areas of
research from being neglected, with only a few
“ t e c h n o l o gical pat h way s ” being explored, w h e n
more and more firms are trying to establish mono-
polies by imposing their standards? In the era of
genetics and the virtual, how can we build ethical
safeguards and reconcile the precautionary pri n c i p l e
with that of maximum profitability?
All these questions should spur intern at i o n a l
d e c i s i o n - m a k e rs to once more promote truly unive rs a l
s c i e n t i fic activity (see box above ) .They should also
d r aw public opinion into a debate that must be held
about the funding and aims of research (pages 35-36).
But before that can happen, people need to know
w h at ’s really happening. n
