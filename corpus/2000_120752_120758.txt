“For the past few years,people in all the
settlements have supported and
valued schooling,” says a representative
of local school parents.“ Things are chan-
ging and our nomadic culture seems to be
e v o l v i n g.”
The pupils at the little schoolhouse at
I m b a s s a s s o u t è n e, south of Ti m b u k t u ,
include Peul and Tuareg nomad children.
Its six classes offer both primary and secon-
dary education, catering to students from
six to 18. In the evening, l i t e r a cy classes
are held there for adults.
Not all schools in the region boast such a
r e c o r d .The school at Djebok,40 kms east
of Gao, counts 254 children enrolled in
four primary classes,but only 25 in its fiv e
secondary grades. Mohamed ag Hama-
d i d a , the headmaster, says about 15 per
cent of the children drop out each year.Th e
r e a s o n s : some settlements are far from the
s c h o o l , while tradition stipulates that loo-
king after cattle is more noble and wor-
thwhile than attending what is known as
“the French school.”
The children are taught by the “ c o n v e r-
g e n t ”m e t h o d , which mainly relies on using
Ta m a z i g h t , the Tuareg mother tongue,
when they start school.The first year,t h r e e
quarters of the lessons are in Ta m a z i g h t .
Fr e n c h , M a l i ’s official language, takes on
increasing importance to become the only
one used by the time the children reach
their sixth year.
Education in its “ m o d e r n ” form was intro-
duced during the French colonial era and
coldly welcomed by the Tu a r e g s.The tribal
chiefs refused to let their sons go to school,
sending children taken from serf families
i n s t e a d . After independence, d i s t r u s t
remained towards an institution that was
foreign to the traditional culture and threa-
tened to force nomads into adopting a
sedentary lifestyle.
But recent events have revolutionized the
lives of the Tu a r e g s. Major droughts in
1973 and 1984 and then armed rebellion in
the early 1990s1 and subsequent repres-
sion caused large migrations. The peace
agreements in Mali (1992) and Niger
(1995) allowed the displaced people to
return with the help of the UN High Com-
mission for Refugees, but not until 1996.
Many parents then changed their attitude
and concluded that going to school could
help their offspring find jobs away from the
world of nomadic cattle-herding.E d u c a t i o n
had also proved useful during the peace
negotiations and later to help Tu a r e g s
secure government jobs.
Many partners are involved in the educa-
tion of Tuareg children, including the Wo r l d
B a n k , the Organization of Petroleum-
Exporting Countries (O P E P) , U S A I D, 


t h e
Islamic Development Bank, the Fr e n c h
group Volunteers for Progress and Dutch
and French government aid bodies.
The host countries contribute too.E m m a-
nuel Sagara, director of basic education
for the Gao region, held a seminar in the
Chadian capital, N d j a m e n a , in Ja n u a r y
2 0 0 0 , that brought together education
experts and officials from Burkina Fa s o,
M a u r i t a n i a , N i g e r, Chad and Mali. Po l i-
cies vary widely from country to country.
Chad has travelling schools, whose tea-
chers move with the nomads. Niger has
opted for a mixed system, with children
spending six months in a school and the rest
of the year tending animals. Mali has
chosen to set up a series of “ s i t e s ” w h i c h
include a school and a nearby well to attract
and accommodate the nomads.
Sagara says school attendance by 6-12-
y e a r-olds is 36 per cent in the Gao
region,with girls accounting for 18 per cent
of the total. But there are no figures on
how many nomad children are among
them because language and ethnic origin
are not seen as relevant.
Souleymane ag Mehdi,who runs T é l o u é t ,
an NGO specialized on economic deve-
lopment in northern Mali, also notes a
change of attitude among the Tuaregs that
he attributes to a post-rebellion re-eva-
l u a t i o n . Despite the risk of educated young
Tuaregs becoming assimilated,he stresses
the role that the most enlightened of them
could play in avoiding this outcome. Th e
key is to support Tuareg culture, n a m e l y
through publishing,n e w s p a p e r s,m u s e u m s
and research and documentation centres.
So far, none of the above exist. ■
1. Fo l l owing an armed rebellion and ethnic strife in
northern Mali between 1990 and 1994,over 150,000
Malians fled the country. By mid-1995, due to the
implementation of a peace agreement, and efforts
by the Malian authorities to secure national recon-
c i l i a t i o n , stability has been re-established in nor-
thern Mali.
