Disc jockeys have been spinning records for
decades. But when in the 30-year history of
electronic dance music did they rise to
become highly influential cultural icons? Not only
h ave club DJs become gat e k e e p e rs within local
music industries;some are now cast as highly paid
musical ambassadors , t r aveling around the globe
to spread the latest musical trends.
Is this because club DJs know best how to cast
a spell on a danceflo o r ,h ow to “ wo r k ” a record in a
way that makes it seem at once familiar and excit-
ingly new, how to bring a crowd to a peak not just
once during an evening, but several times? Or is it
simply because DJs are finally being paid hand-
somely and enjoying the celebrity status that comes
with money and media exposure?
The answer probably is “all of the above ” o r
“somewhere in the middle.”The place to go look-
ing for the roots of DJ culture are the urban centres
long known as hotbeds of
musical creativity. Places like
New York City. E ven a bri e f
h i s t o ry of club deejaying must
b e gin here, in the pre-disco
era of the late 1960s and early
1 9 7 0 s , at the crossroads of
A f rican A m e rican expressive
culture and collectively real-
ized gay sensibilities which
together form the core of con-
temporary social dance culture.
Dance music culture, whether associated with
disco, club,or house music, has its roots in the Big
A p p l e . New York became the disco capital of the
world by the mid-1970s, thanks to a vibrant under-
ground dance culture with local African American
and Latino gay men at the helm. The city’s leg-
endary discotheques,such as Sanctuary,The Loft,
Better Day s , Paradise Garage, among others ,
emerged from the fusion of three distinct types of
social dance environments prevalent in the 1960s,
which featured recorded music with or without a
D J. The first precursor was based on the French
d i s c o t h e q u e ,e xe m p l i fied in Manhattan by exclusive
establishments such as Le Club, and later Arthur
and Cheetah.Their design and clientele reflected
the post-war idea of a disco as an exclusive wat e ri n g
hole for a jet-set clientele.
This elitest conception changed, h owe ve r , i n
the late 1960s and early 70s as the discotheque
absorbed the social changes transforming A m e ri c a n
society at large. Most import a n t l y, young urban-
i t e s — p a rticularly ethnic minori t i e s , women and
g ays—who had been (or felt) pushed to the margi n s
of A m e rican society, became increasingly vo c a l .
These groups included anti-establishment pre-
Woodstock hippies, s t ruggling poets, m u s i c i a n s ,
a c t o rs , and other art i s t s , as well as a mix of wo r k i n g -
class Caucasians,African Americans and Latinos.
Though they did mingle to some extent, t h e y
tended to frequent separate dance establishments,
based mainly on their sexual orientation.
Heterosexual crowds gathered at clubs like
E l e c t ric Circus or Zodiac, where DJs played an
eclectic repertoire of rock, rhythm & blues (R&B)
and early forms of what is now marketed as world
m u s i c. In contrast, young gay men and wo m e n
socialised at neighbourhood clubs or bars , e i t h e r
legal or unlicensed, generally in ethnically homo-
geneous areas like Harlem,
the Hispanic barrios of
Harlem or the Upper We s t
S i d e . While the music
pumped from either a juke
b ox or a DJ set, older men
(sometimes in drag) often
acted as initiat o rs and at times
p r o t e c t o rs of younger gay s
into “the Life” (a socially and
sexually active , yet often
secret,life).Some of these local gay bars were reg-
ularly raided by police,a practice which ended with
the legendary Stonewall Riots of Greenwich V i l-
lage on June 28, 1 9 6 9 .T h e r e , for the first time, g ay s
fought police harassment collectively and success-
fully, to the extent that after Stonewall, many les-
bians and gays began to see social dancing not sim-
ply as a pastime but also as a powerful means of
building a sense of communal identity.
While the first gay disco in New York State wa s
probably in Cherry Grove on Fire Island, the firs t
urban venue that made disco notori o u s ,f o r b i d d e n ,
and at t r a c t i ve all at once was the Sanctuary on Man-
h at t a n ’s West 43rd Street, which in 1970 became
the model for later underground gay discos. T h e
S a n c t u a ry also gave birth to the first club DJ as pop
s t a r. D a n c e rs and groupies alike flocked to see and
hear DJ Francis (Grasso), who had mastered a new
i n s t ru m e n t , consisting of two turntables and a mixe r ,
and a new stage: the DJ booth with its controls of

sound and light to fire non-stop, wa l l - t o - wall danc-

By 1973, national magazines such as Billboard
and Rolling Stone and NYC radio stations began
featuring “disco” hits and programmes. Fans who
c o u l d n ’t hear enough of the music on the radio and
in clubs began buying records in numbers that
forced recording companies to pay attention to
music they’d been ignori n g . Like their forebears on
radio in the 1950s, club DJs became influ e n t i a l
enough to “break”or introduce new records to the
p u b l i c. This rising status enabled them to have
direct input into the records themselve s. For exam-
p l e , New York DJ David Todd introduced R&B pro-
ducer Van McCoy to a Latin dance called the Hus-
t l e , leading to the production of an epony m o u s
record which became a big hit for McCoy while
Todd went on to develop the disco department at a
major company, RCA Records.
Fighting off
“the death of vinyl”
B e t ween 1975 and 1985, the lines between stu-
dio producers , e n gi n e e rs , s o n g w ri t e rs and DJs
became increasingly fuzzy. Instead of just spinning
records at clubs, DJs ventured into the recording
s t u d i o s ,b ri n ging the same workplace concepts and
techniques of mixing music, c r e ating new sounds
and re-mixing songs.As remixe rs , they used the tech-
n o l o gical tools in ways their designers never dreamed
o f. For example,a simple synthesizer/sequencer, t h e
Roland T B - 3 0 3 , marketed in 1983 for rock musi-
cians looking to emulate a bass guitar, became the
staple of the acid house sound. DJs didn’t just use the
little box but “ p l aye d ” its pitch, a c c e n t , r e s o n a n c e
and frequency controls, similar to the way they
“ p l aye d ”r e c o r d s. By adding sequencers and dru m
m a c h i n e s , they not only increased and dive rs i fie d
their own club repert o i r e s , but produced new tracks
and ve rsions to be sold to the public. In the process,
disco became house music.
As this transfer of technologies and aesthetics
b e t ween the recording studio and the DJ booth
i n c r e a s e d , so did dance music’s profit a b i l i t y. S i n c e
the rise of tapes and compact discs, DJs have been
the main economic force in fighting off the “ d e ath of
v i ny l ” ( r e c o r d s ) .The main institutions of the dance
music industry—the independent label, the record
pool (companies distri buting promotional records to
DJs who in return issue feedback sheets), the under-
ground club, the specialty retail store—tend to be
staffed by DJs who base their activities on an eve r -
expanding  concept of their art and skills as musicians
and perform e rs.The increase in status from record-
spinner to remixer and record producer has trans-
f o rmed the club DJ from cult figure to cultural icon.
Dance music is now a global phenomenon, t r ave l i n g
with a set of DJs who have spun their own ve rsion of
the worldwide we b : the “ I n t e rnet of dance music” i s
made up of axes linking local dance cultures.
For New York DJs, the first major axis ran through
other U. S . cities with vibrant or emerging local dance
c u l t u r e s. From New Yo r k ,D a n ny Tenaglia moved to
Miami where he spent his form at i ve ye a rs as a DJ
before returning to Manhattan where he is now one
of the most in-demand remixe rs (creating new ve r-
sions of old tracks by other art i s t s ) .Another New Yo r k
D J , Frankie Knuckles,m oved to Chicago, f o l l ow i n g
an inv i t ation to become the resident DJ at the Wa r e-
h o u s e , a gay black club. N o t e wo rt hy is that both

Tenaglia and Knuckles continuously traveled back
and forth to New Yo r k , b ri n ging back new sounds
while stocking up on local records. They also have
since returned to the Big Apple to live and work as DJs
and remixe rs.
New tradewinds
The second axis leads across the Atlantic, from
Chicago through New York to London. A r o u n d
1 9 8 6 / 7 , after the initial buzz surrounding house
music in Chicago, it became clear that the major
recording companies and media institutions were
reluctant to market this music, associated with gay
African Americans,on a mainstream level. House
artists turned to Europe, chiefly London but also
cities such as A m s t e r d a m , B e r l i n , M a n c h e s t e r ,
Milan,Zurich,and Tel Aviv.The rest is the history
of what became rave culture, a European yo u t h
dance phenomenon which is still going strong.
A third axis leads to Japan where,since the late
1 9 8 0 s , New York club DJs have had the opport u n i t y
to play guest-spots to audiences who are as much
r e m oved geographically and culturally from
African\American and gay sensibilities as are their
European counterparts. Still, local dance cultures
f o rmed and continue to expand in To k yo and other
major Japanese cities. At the turn of the millen-
nium, the tradewinds of the DJ are reaching new
d e s t i n at i o n s , like Sao Pa o l o, Mexico City and
African capitals like Dar Es Salaam.There, a new
generation is enriching a tradition which so far has
no textbook or manual, nor has it received com-
p r e h e n s i ve documentat i o n . R at h e r , it is carri e d
f o rth orally, by DJs who learned from those who
came before them.Keep on! ■
