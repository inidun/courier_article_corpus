RENE MAHEU
international co-operation
and the struggle
for development
by Paulo E. de Berrêdo Carneiro
RENE Maheu was sworn in as
Director-General of Unesco
on 14 November 1962, and I
was President of the 12th Session of
the Unesco General Conference when
he took the oath to abide by the
principles of our Constitution.
I had the privilege of being René
Maheu's friend and associate from
the time of Unesco's creation, and I
was able to see him at work during
the finest years of his life.
At the time he became Director-
General, René Maheu had been with
Unesco for just over 16 years. "I
often feel nostalgia for those far-off
days,"he said in his inaugural speech,
"not only because I was younger
then and my responsibilities were less
onerous, but also because there was
then within the Organization a feeling
for ideas and intellectual quality for
their own sakes: of course it was
sometimes naive, or makeshift from
the administrative point of view, but
still it imbued the Secretariat with a
sort of youthful vigour full of original
thought and enthusiasm."
"I wonder ¡f I can convey to you,"
René Maheu said later in this inaugu¬
ral speech,, "the depth of the feelings
aroused ¡n me by everything that
Unesco stands for... as a teacher
coming from a family who were all
teachers themselves, I have spent the
major part of my life concerned
solely with the austere and noble
vocation of education. If I listen to

when he was teaching
humanities and English at the
Muslim College in Fez (Morocco).
He also taught philosophy at the
French lycée in Fez. Five years
later, in 1946, he joined Unesco,
of which he was to be Director-
General from 1962 to 1974. René
Maheu died in December 1975.
a ,discussion about the fight against
illiteracy, my heart immediately evokes
memories of my paternal grand¬
parents, with whom I spent my
childhood and who were themselves
illiterate.
"...Yet it was from them that I
learned the things which I consider
to be truly fundamental to my cha¬
racter and beliefs; first and foremost
the thirst for education amongst
humble people, and their passionate
desire for social justice. Because of
this I was not surprised ¡n later years
when I witnessed the upheavals which
rocked colonized nations throughout
the world, ousting even the oldest,
proudest and most firmly-rooted ruling
powers.
"I recognized in this irresistible
movement the same search for en¬
lightenment and dignity, the same
thirst and the same passion, as had
been experienced by those who had
created my own heart and blood, but
were now being manifested on the
greater scale of humanity as a whole.
And since I have found in Unesco so
many personal raisons d'être and
potentials for achievement within a
framework of universality, it is right
that I should today commit myself to
Unesco without reservations."
Indeed, no commitment has ever
been honoured more faithfully.
As Unesco grew ¡n his hands, René
Maheu grew with it. Personal exper¬
ience had taught him that Unesco,
concerned as it was with things of
the mind, had to be an intellectual .
and spiritual reality itself if it was to
be truly effective.
His contacts with every kind ofr
23

person throughout the world had
been a living proof to him of the
unity of the human race. Humanity
is a single being composed of past
and future generations; thus if harm
is done to one of its members harm
is done to all.
Neither disapproval nor political
prejudice ever prevented René Maheu
from proclaiming Unesco's universal
vocation, nor from opening its doors
to welcome all those countries who
were ¡n the process of freeing them¬
selves from colonial domination.
When Vittorino Veronese, then Di¬
rector-General of Unesco, appointed
him as Deputy Director-General in
November 1959, René Maheu dis¬
played a flawless knowledge of
Unesco's means of action, the pro¬
blems it faced, the resources it re¬
quired and each of the many aspects
of a programme designed to meet
the needs of all its members, whether
great or small, rich or poor, in the
fields of education, science and cul¬
ture. Already at that time, no one
was better qualified to lead Unesco
than René Maheu.
When the six years of his mandate
were up, Unesco's member states
(whose numbers had increased con¬
siderably following the accession of
many African countries to indepen¬
dence) unanimously re-elected him to
office on 19 October 1968.
This was a just reward for the
results that he had achieved with
equal success in the two domains
intellectual co-operation and aid for
development which he had always
striven to render complementary.
In years to come, when a historian
examines Unesco's archives, he will
find the documents bearing witness
to René Maheu's twelve years of lea¬
dership to be of Inestimable value in
understanding the intellectual and
political problems of our time.
René Maheu anticipated this, and
the care he took to depict the truest
possible image of Unesco in his writ¬
ings and speeches is the best proof
of his respect and love for the Orga¬
nization.
The anthology which contains a
large part of his works, under the
expressive title of Civilisation de l'Uni¬
versel, makes it possible for all those
who share the hopes and fears of our
century to participate in the efforts
being made by Unesco to create a
new social order based on the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights.
René Maheu was proud to devote
the most important part of his life, his
thoughts and actions to the search
for a way of creating a peaceful
world devoid of divisive cultural and
economic inequalities in which each
individual would be consciously aware
that his share of happiness formed a
part of happiness on a universal
