What came b e f o re
Do the secrets of the universe lie within the atom? Could a 27-kilometre tunnel
reveal the deep truth?
1 . SCIENCE AT THE LIMITS
R
everse the film of our universe’s history,
and things seems to get mighty strange in
the last reel. What began in physical
h a r m o n y, propitious for planets, h u m a n s
and domestic appliances, has reverted to
h e l l :temperatures hotter than the sun’s core, an exotica
of hysterical matter, forces rupturing asunder. N u d g e
the reel a bit further on, and the image abruptly
switches from fury to a vague and peaceful nothing.
It is not an ending—or rather a beginning—that
s a t i s fies too many people.Though little headway has
been made exploring this peculiar transformation of
nothing into hot and very excited everything, t h e
issue has not been absent from scientific minds. I f
only to combat the allure of a “God particle” bent on
generating the cosmos, science has searched for an
alternative:not just a history of before the big bang,
but some deeper reason for why, out of unfathomably
chaotic stuff, should emerge a place where a hair-
dryer works.
Gabriele Veneziano is one of those who believes
an answer may have been found.According to this
leading Italian theoretical physicist,a deeper reality
lies “under”the one we perceive. Superstrings, to be
p r e c i s e, vibrating away in 10 or 11 dimensions,c r e a t i n g
and composing the entire universe from their
minuscule shudders.
Deciphering his account of how the universe
came to be reads like an odyssey through 20t h c e n t u r y
p h y s i c s. Superstring theory,and its many cousins in the
domain of elementary particle physics, are offshoots
of the two great theoretical inventions of the century’s
first decades—general relativity and quantum
m e c h a n i c s. On the basis of the fir s t , a convincing
picture of the universe could be drawn back to an
initial point, or “ s i n g u l a r i t y,” of massive, p o s s i b l y
i n finite density. Through the quantum world, v a s t
leaps could be made in penetrating the atom, t h e
components of the atom (protons, neutrons and
electrons),and then,colossal equipment and minds
p e r m i t t i n g, the components of the components of
the atom.
Slam and see
At that point, the two theoretical roots join as one.
Assuming the universe is created in a blazing,
primordial soup, then clearly the most basic units of
matter will be those that prevail. Finding out what
rules govern them is then the golden bridge towards
understanding how the universe was made.
Until the end of last year, a palm-sized pipe
wrapped in potent magnets and circling beneath the
Franco-Swiss border was the world capital for such
i n v e s t i g a t i o n s.Along this 27-kilometre pipe, a pair of
electrons would pass 11,000 times a second—close to
the speed of light—before hurtling to a splintering
c o l l i s i o n . Such is CERN, the European laboratory
for nuclear research. The principle is simple: s l a m
and see.
Behind the principle lies a very basic formula,
Einstein’s E=mc2, which establishes an equivalence
between energy and mass. Accelerate a subatomic
particle like an electron or proton, crash it into a
p a r t n e r, and the energies accumulated in its light-
speed dash will be scattered into more massive, very
short-lived particles—exactly the sort of particles
that reigned in the early universe before gluing
together as space cooled.
The appetite of scientists has naturally not abated.
1. Another target for re-
s e a r ch might also usher
in a new unity. T h i s
branch of theory, known
as supersymmetry,
speculates that a
fundamental balance
exists throughout the
quantum realm,and that
at high energies the
“ s u p e r p a r t n e r s ” of know n
particles will flit into
Inside the atom (left) lies the nucleus;inside the nucleus,
neutrons and protons; inside each of them (top right),
three quarks.The search for elemetary matter continues.


By 2005,a new accelerator is due to be operating at
C E R N : the Large Hadron Collider, armed with a
magnetic field 100,000 times that of the earth,
interspersed with six-storey high detectors and able to
take subatomic conditions back to those which held in
the universe’s first picosecond (10- 1 2 s e c o n d s ) . “ We
are going to be able to probe distances inside matter
which are perhaps ten times smaller than we’ve seen
before,” explains John Ellis, a senior physicist at the
laboratory.
Through theoretical work and experiments at
this and other accelerators, scientists have already
disaggregated the atom and the forces that rule its
movements into a menagerie of over 60 particles.A
story of the universe has emerged:a tale of descent
from high to low energy, in which primitive forces split
(creating electricity), and unstable fundaments of
matter convert their mass into the astonishing
energies inhabiting every atom.
The staircase of universes
But the story is far from complete. It may be very
well to enumerate and calculate the powers of quarks
and spins of photons, yet how could such an
encyclopaedic set of characteristics sprout so level-
headedly from a meltdown? Perhaps more
importantly, where does gravity fit in? Its supposed
f o r c e - c a r r i e r, the graviton, has never been observed.
The force itself appears alien to quantum theory.
And its strength for each atom is derisory compared
to the belligerence of the nuclear and electromagnetic
forces:how else could a chair buttress you from the
entire gravitational attraction of the planet?
In search of an answer, the scientific community
has appealed to the notion of unific a t i o n .The deeper
one gets into the interstices of matter, they argue, t h e
more sweeping and elegant the formulae may become.
The lust for a unified theory behind nature has
prime targets in sight. In a last gasp of CERN’s old
a c c e l e r a t o r, the first experimental indications emerged
of the so-called Higgs field,an arena of force like the
electromagnetic field with which species of particles
interact (or do not) and win their very unique masses.
“Imagine you’re cooking pasta,”says Ellis,“and you add
olive oil. When it cools, the olive oil separates out.
What we’re trying to do in the new collider is boil the
water so that we can see the differences evaporate.”1
Yet this still leaves the gravitational conundrum
unresolved. John March Russell,a physicist at CERN,
enthuses over one mind-bending possibility: that gravity
is so weak in comparison to other forces because much
of it is swallowed into other dimensions. Should this be
the case, he says, the new collider may reveal more
than just new particles:energy might be sucked away
into the nether- w o r l d ,or even more radically, tiny black
holes may form for a fraction of a second.
Such extra dimensions would appear to make
elementary particles that bit more baffling, but the
opposite is probably true:it may offer the first proof
that strings exist.“ Th e o r e t i c a l l y, the gravity problem
and string theory fit together very nicely,” a r g u e s
March Russell.
But what precisely are these magical strings? Fo r
around 30 years, theorists have laboured over rival
sets of formulae explaining how string-like
p h e n o m e n a , around 10- 3 2 cm in length and thus
invisible to all possible experiments, generate the
entirety of known particles and forces, i n c l u d i n g
gravity. If true, it would be the deepest theory ever
e n c o u n t e r e d : the overarching law breathing form
and function into the universe.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y, their infinitesimal size and
supplementary dimensions have given the theory an
air of high abstraction,but Ve n e z i a n o, also of CERN,
is undaunted. For him,the epoch of creation might
have to be rewritten.“I see the big bang as a way to
put string theory to the test.When you get very close
to time zero, strings simply cannot fit into space.”
The results are revolutionary. No infinitely dense
singularity could exist at the start of the universe
because of the strings’ irreducible size.I n s t e a d , a “ p r e -
history” must be sketched in.“This could be a very
long pre-history starting with an almost trivial, i n fin i t e
universe filled with gravitational waves that barely
interact at all,” says Ve n e z i a n o.“ The beginning of the
process ending in the big bang is the occurrence of an
overdense region leading to the formation of a black
h o l e.”Within this hole, trapped waves start to interact
in the form of strings. An early relative of gravity
causes a lightning expansion of space, and at some
critical and obscure moment,the era of strings cedes
to the big bang, thus begetting the era of particles,
planets and us. “What we have for most of the time
before and after the big bang is a classical evolution,”
he says.
Major problems remain,above all in explaining
why the underlying strings (or any other fundamental
theory for that matter) do not lead to an utterly
different set of physical laws. But the thought is still
a giddy one—that reality migrates along a staircase of
u n i v e r s e s, each step recumbent on the one before.“ I n
the world today,the castle is destroyed—it’s a heap of
