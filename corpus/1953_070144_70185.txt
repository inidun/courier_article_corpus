ITS HEAD IS IN THE TROPIC SUN,
ITS FEET AMID ANTARCTIC SNOWS
THE vast, dry desert region in the north
of the country is the source of Chile's
greatest source of wealth-nitrates.
In fact, rain in Chile's Atacama desert
1t'ould wash away the world's largest
nitrate deposits. Nitrates are used
mainly to produce fertilizers, but they
give a number of important by-
pl'oducts, especially iodine, of which
Chile produces 75 per cent of the
world's needs.
*
NINE-TENTHS of the people of Chilelive in the fertile central region.
Nineteen of the 26 towns having popu-
lations of over 10. 000 are situated there.
*
AT Punta Arenas, in the extreme south,there are 17 hours of daylight each
day during December and January.

No one knows exactly how Chile gotits name. Some think it comes from
a quechua Indian word meaning
"snow"or"eoM". Others believe that
it it was originally the name of a valley
which the conquistadores later applied
to the entire country. Another Iheor'l
is that this two-syllable word stems
from the name of a native bird. Or its
origin may be from Aymara Chilli.
1cllich means"the place where the land
ends".
WITH "its head burning in the
tropical sun, while its feet are
freezing", Chile is one of the longest
countries in the world - 2.800 miles,
or more than half the entire length of
the Latin American continent. In width,
however, it rarely exceeds 200 miles -
and in places less than 40 miles.
*
THE Araucanian Indians have anextraordinarily rich musical folklore.
In fact, they have a song appropriate
to every occasion. There are songs for
children, and choruses and ritual songs
which are used in religious and social
ceremonies. Their music has remark-
able rhythm and melody.
*
CHILE has one of the best school
systems in Latin America, with
kindergartens, provision for vocational
training, and other features of modern
education.  One of the oldest pro-
fessional training colleges in America is
the School of Art and Commerce in
Santiago.
*
CHILE has given Latin America one ofits greatest poets : Gabriela Mistral,
winner of the Nobel Prize for literature
in 1945. A diplomal and form/'
teacher, she won her first success in
1914 when she was awarded a poetry
prize. Now her works take an
honoured place in anthologies of Latin
American verse.

FOR a number of years, university
groups have led the movement to
give Chile a high standard of drama.
Not only does the National University's
experimental theatre present high
quality productions of both classical and
modan plays in Santiago, but also
sends its troupe throughout the country,
to appear in schools, military camps,
tmde union building and rural centres.
In 1945, this theatre set up a school off
dramatic art. In addition, it runs a
library and provides scholarships for
study abroad. To encourage literary
activity, an annual experimental theatre
prize is also atvarded.

DURING the war between the Spaniardsand the recalcitrant Araucanian
Indians, a young captain named Alonso
de Ercilla wrote verse on scraps of
paper, on bits of teather- on anything
he coulrt lay his hands upon. When
he went back to Spain, he made these
up into a long poem, the first part of
which was published in 1569. La
Araucana, which deals with the early
days of Chile as a nation, was to
become one of the greatest sources
of inspiration to Chilean writers
throughout the 16th and 17th centuries,
and is one of the foremost epics in
llispano-American literalure.

CLAUDIO ARRAU. one of the greatest
pianists in the world today, is a Chi-
lean. Since his first audition in the United
States in 1924, he has been acclaimed
wherever he has played. Other famous
Chilcan pianists include Arnaldo Tapia
Caballero, Armando Palacios, Alfonso
Montecino and Oscar Gacilua.
A trainload of nitrates from the northern deserts of Chile wends
its way through the country's steep mountain slopes bound for a
seaport. The refined nitrates are shipped to all parts of the world.
Juan Fernandez stand, west of Valparaiso, was the scene of an
adventure that inspired the story of Robinson Crusoe. An 18th
century Scottish sailor was stranded there for over four years.
Santiago de Chile is a fine, modern capital, with 1, 200, 000 inha-
bitants-a fifth of the country's population. It is the fourth largest
city in South America, and was founded just over 400 years ago.
For Chile the sea was the earliest and is still the most service-
able highway. Some 30 ports, like Puerto Montt, shown
here, are visited by ships engaged in international trade.
Separated from Punta Arenas-the world's most southerly town-
by the Straits of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego remains the homeland
of a number of Indian tribes who live in the most primitive way.

ON THE THRESHOLD OF A MAJOR
TRANSFORMATION
worse, for there were
already insufficient
schools for all the
hildren entitled to
free and compulsory
education.
The Chilean people
knew that as long as
25 per cent of its
members were handi-
capped by illiteracy,
many plans for indus-
trialization and pro-
gress would remain
unfulfilled. Spurred
by the need for urgent
action, the Govern-
ment therefore em-
barked on a large-
scale educational pro-
gramme, which is now
showing good results.
The situation which
existed in Chile at the
end of the Second
World War was not a
reflection on the ef-
forts made in the
educational fields.
Chile has, in fact,
one of the best school
systems in Latin Ame-
rica, with kindergar-
tens, provision for
vocational training,
and other features
for modern education.
Education is free and
compulsory for all
ODAY Chile stands on thethreshold of a major trans-
formation. In the last few
decades the nature and extent of
the country's hidden wealth have
been more and more seriously ex-
plored. Chile is full of potential
wealth, for it possesses immense
deposits of minerals. Alone among
South American countries, it has
both abundant mineral ore and
native coal. As the existence of im-
portant mineral resources has been
revealed, so industrial development
has forged ahead.
New installations which have shot
up include enormous nitrate and
copper plants. New industries have
begun to develop around Santiago
and in the South. One of the most
important events in this expansion
was the opening of one of South
America's two steel producing plants
at Huachipato near Concepcion, one
of Chile's four main industrial cities.
Even though it is
estimated that 40 per
cent of Chileans still
derive their living
directly from the land,
the industrial way of
life has already made
a strong penetration
into the country. On
a per capita basis, the
new urban Chile now
makes use of more
energy supplied by
water, oil and coaj
than any other Latin
American country.
And as they begin
their march towards
a new industrial fu-
ture which they hope
will mean better
homes, more food and
happier and healthier
lives, Chileans have
not overlooked one of
the basic require-
ments for this trans-
formation-adequate
education for all.
The full realization
of their educational
problem was revealed
to the people of Chile
by a post-war stock-
taking of the nation's
resources, which
showed that some-
thing like one quarter
of the nation's
6, 000, 000 p o p u I a-
tion was illiterate.
With an annual po-
pulation increase of
100, 000, and a total of
25000 children reach-
ing school age each
year, the situation
was bound to become
children betwen the ages of 7 and 15.
But this law is difficult to enforce
because the people in some regions
are widely scattered and funds, due
to fluctuating economic conditions,
have frequently been inadequate.
As far back as 1840, when only
13 per cent of Chile's 1, 500, 000 peo-
ple were literate, the Chilean Repub-
lic was organizing classes at mili-
tary barracks, and opening libraries
where citizens were provided with
free instruction in health and sani-
tation, as well as being taught
reading and writing.
Despite the efforts that were made,
the literacy rate, for a population of
2, 500, 000, was still only 32. 8 per cent
in 1895. Forty-five years later, in
1940, 48 per cent of the population
of 5, 000, 000 could read and write.
It had been hoped that the
introduction of compulsory primary
education in 1920 would remove the
need for adult education, but this
assumption proved to be raise. And
by Tibor MENDE
the revision of ideas about the need
for adult education came simul-
taneously with the opening up of
broader economic horizons for Chile.
The nation was shocked when
Senora Amanda Labarca, head of
seasonal schools and extra-mural
studies, declared in 1939 :"Of every
10, 000 Chileans, 2, 219 are illiterate
adults ; 2, 168 are of school-going
age ; 588 are enrolled in primary
schools ; 61 complete their schooling ;
47 enter secondary schools ; nine
complete their secondary education ;
three enter universities ; only one
receives a degree."
Of all these statistics, the one
which showed that only 61 out of
every 10, 000 Chileans completed
their elementary education produced
the greatest effect. It meant that
in 1939 there were still 250, 000
children who should have been
receiving free and compulsory
elementary education, but who did
not attend classes, either because
their parents needed their services to
help raise the family budget, or
simply because there were no schools
within walking distance of their
homes.
Of the 191, 000 children who
entered elementary schools in 1939,
only one-seventh went through all
the six forms. In reality, a total of
468, 000 children did not get any
schooling at all, despite the compul-
sory education law.
The Government took action to
change the situation revealed by
these statistics. In 1942 it set up the
Anti-Illiteracy and Adult Education
Section (Seccion Alfabetizacion y
Educacion de Adultos) and placed it
under the immediate control of the
Director-General of Primary Educa-
tion.
To increase the number of adult
education schools-then only 38-
many obstacles had to be overcome.
It was difficult to work out a nation-
wide plan, as the Chilean provinces
had educational autonomy. Equip-
ment was lacking, and there was no
administrative machinery for carry-
ing out a large-scale campaign.
The money available seemed
totally inadequate. The amount for
each adult to be educated was only
a fraction of that spent on each child
of school-going age.
Southern Chile possesses many watercourses and a labyrinth of fiords with steep rocky margins.
Large ferries, like this one at Carahue, are used to transport livestock and produce across rivers.
However, thanks to the energy and
enthusiasm of the officials and
educators in the Anti-Illiteracy
Section, a programme was drawn up
and put into action, and it soon led
to an energetic campaign in all parts
of the country.
By the middle of 1951, the number
of adult education schools had grown
to 387, or over ten times the 1942
figure. They were set up for both
general and specific studies. Some
gave instruction in reading and
writing, others taught applied
science, and still others provided
instruction on subjects of practical,
everyday use.
Of the total, 309 ran evening
classes for people over 16. A further
42 were organized in prisons, while
nine were held in hospitals and
sanatoria. Some were begun as
experiments to meet special local
needs. Five of these, for instance,
were mobile schools, two were
devoted to the dissemination of the
arts, and two more taught domestic
economy.
In addition, a symphony orchestra
of teachers was formed, and between
1942 and 1950 it gave 361 concerts in
various parts of the country to over
250, 000 people. Moreover, 223 li-
braries were organized within the
adult education schools, and over
350, 000 readers have taken advantage
of the facilities they have offered
during the past five years. A recent
innovation is a travelling cultural
exhibition which is to visit all parts
of the country.
The adult education classes them-
selves were organized on a three-
term basis. Students who passed
through all three were given a
special certificate so as to increase
their chances of obtaining suitable
employment.
But as fewer than 900 teachers
were provided, all these results could
not have been achieved without
volunteer help. A magnificent res-
ponse came from the general public
to an appeal asking them to take
part in the education of the illiterate
hiembers of the community.
Volunteers came forward in large
numbers. They taught without pay,
and took an active part in a nation-
wide collection of books, educational. aids and equipment which were
then distributed locally by municipal
authorities.
Altogether, over 21, 000 volunteer
teachers came to the aid of the
literacy campaign between 1945 and
1950, nearly half of them being
professional teachers prepared to put
in a few hours'extra teaching each
evening. The remaining 11, 000 were
students and private individuals
who had been inspired by the aims
of the campaign.
The results were encouraging. In
1945, the first year, over 5, 000 people
learned to read and write. Of these,
only 755 were taught in classes, the
remainder being helped by volunteers
at home. These numbers doubled in
the second year of the campaign,
and were trebled in 1947. Altogether,
over 88, 000 people became literate
between 1945 and 1950, thanks to the
educational drive.
However encouraging these results
may be, they are still not sufficient
to solve Chile's illiteracy problem.
The Anti-Illiteracy Section recently
stressed this fact in a poster which
reminded Chileans that the number
of illiterates still equalled the popu-
lation of Santiago, the capital. The
addition of illiterate children under
15 to this figure brings home the
problem more forcefully.
So the campaign is being
expanded, and the radio and cinema
have been mobilized to publicize and
stimulate interest in it. To keep up
their present progressive tempo, the
organizers must rely on help from
teachers'colleges, be allocated in-
creased funds and receive continued
volunteer co-operation. With such
help and resources they are likely to
go far in the next few years towards
their ultimate target, which is to
enable the Chilian people to take full
advantage of their country's econo-
mic possibilities-possibilities which
are now almost within their reach.
The Catholic University of Chile, whose facade is shown
above, is one of the country's four institutions of higher
education, the largest of which is the National University.
Most of Chile's high schools and technical institutes
are situated in Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepcion.
