IN ail pastoral societies in which live¬
stock are central to the economic
and cultural life of the community, a
relationship that is both practical and per¬
sonal develops between the men and the
animals in their charge. This relationship
is expressed in calls, either vocal or
instrumental, wordless tunes, onoma¬
topoeic noises, songs, or even incanta¬
tions used to control the herds.
On a more subjective level,- the herds¬
men can express a variety of feelings in
this way. Poems, songs and calls in which
the human voice or the horn are the
chosen instruments of communication
between man and beast are found in the
Rundi pastoral societies of Central
Africa, among the shepherds of the Bal¬
kan plains and the Lapps of the Far
North, on the Argentine pampas, and
among the cowboys of the American Far
West.
In Switzerland, in the cattle-breeding
communities of the Pre-Alps and the
Alps with the exception, however, of
the outlying Graubünden (Grisons), the
Valais and the Jura the ranz des vaches
is a working song which is part of the

universal oral tradition of pastoral music.
Published for the first time in 1545 in a
German book, it has been transmitted in
various forms, scholarly and otherwise,
collected by travellers, musicians and,
later, musicologists. Over the centuries it
has become imbued with symbolism and
cultural significance that extend far
beyond its original purpose in pastoral
society.
Initially, the ranz des vaches was prob¬
ably a melody or tune played on the
alphorn (see page 29), which was used to
call the herds of cattle scattered through
the mountain pastures. The words came
later; the few versions that we have are all
dated later than 1750.
Characteristic of the ranz des vaches
are its varied rhythms and a highly spe¬
cific tonal feature of traditional music,
the F of the alphorn. This is a note mid
way between F natural and F sharp, to
which the modern ear is no longer
accustomed, and which has disappeared
from most of the learned transcriptions
that have come down to us. In fact, the
modern ranz des vaches is no more than a
distant echo of the music that once rang
out in the Alps.
One example of the traditional ranz
des vaches is that of Appenzell in north¬
east Switzerland. Transcribed around
1750, it seems very close to the early
model whose words and music had a
three-part structure.
The call: The herdsman (or the
alphorn) lets the herd know that it is milk¬
ing time, or time to return to the cow¬
shed, or to go up to the high pastures. The
key word is Lobe in German or Liauba in
French. This is a term of uncertain origin,
possibly onomatopoeic, which designates
a cow.
The roll-call of the herd: This is an
individual call to the cattle. Each cow is
singled out by its name, which may be
picturesque, descriptive or affectionate.
The Appenzeller herd of 1750 consisted
of twenty-seven head of cattle, with such
32

names as: "the Old Woman", "the
Limper", "Hairy", "the Flibbertigibbet",
"Fat Belly" and "the Dazzler".
Narrative: The singer sprinkles this
working song with comments on life in
the high pastures and the difficulties of
the herdsman's life. "Since taking a wife,/
I'm out of bread ;/Since taking a wife ,/I'm
out of luck", recalls the anonymous com¬
poser of Appenzell. Obviously, each
singer had his own personal frame of
reference and there was no standard text
as is the case today.
Since 1813, when it was transcribed by
P.C. Bridel, the ranz des vaches of
Gruyère has been the basic model which
most Swiss people know and which fea¬
tures in the repertoire of popular and
"serious" music in many countries.
In the early decades of the nineteenth
century, in Switzerland, in neighbouring
countries and even in England, musicians
and poets began to draw inspiration from
the ranz des vaches in composing Alpine-
style neo-folk music in which the themes
and images of Romanticism recur. The
many composers who used the ranz des
vaches as a source of rural colour include
Beethoven (in the Pastoral Symphony),
Berlioz (in the Symphonie Fantastique),
Robert Schumann (in Manfred) and
Wagner (in Act 3 of Tristan and Isolde).
Many operas also contain allusions to the
ranz des vaches, including Rossini's
William Tell and the Swiss composer
Gustave Doret's Les Armaillis. In 1828,
at the Royal Opera House in Covent
Garden, London, Sir Henry Rowley
Bishop, the author of the well-known
song Home, Sweet Home, produced a
work entitled Home! Sweet Home! or The
Ranz des Vaches, in which the old Alpine
tune is cleverly blended with his work.
Franz Liszt also composed many varia¬
tions on the ranz des vaches based on
versions which he had heard during his
travels in Switzerland.
For the Swiss, the ranz des vaches has
always had a very special meaning. It has
long been a reminder of the past, a
Rousseauist "memory marker" of a
golden age in the heart of the Alps, as
well as a poetic image of nature in which
people lived their lives in freedom.
Today, it is a mythical evocation of a cer¬
tain vision of Switzerland and the pas¬
toral folklore associated with it.
GUY METRAUX is a Swiss historian and a for¬
mer Unesco staffmember who served as Secre¬
tary-General of the International Commission for
the publication of a History of the Scientific and
Cultural Development of Mankind and as editor
of the international journal Cultures. He is the
author of Le ranz des vaches Du chant des
bergers à l'hymne patriotique (1984, "The ranz
des vaches From the Herdsmen's Song to the
Patriotic Hymn").
