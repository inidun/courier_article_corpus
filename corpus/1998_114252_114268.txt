Brazil: a three-tier system
■
To keep the smart car’s price about the same
as its ri va l s , despite its advanced technology, t h e
vehicle’s “configurators” have, among other
t h i n g s , altered the standard process of car design and
manufacture.
S u p p l i e rs whose role was once limited to
making small parts designed by the car-maker,h ave
become partners in the car’s conception and pro-
duction to the extent that the biggest among them
now turn out whole sets of parts in the assembly
plant itself.
This kind of amalgamation is ve ry unusual
because the ve rtical division of tasks and the hierarchy
it creates are still the rule in the automobile industry,
e ven if things are less ri gid than they once we r e . I n
B r a z i l , for example,where an investment of $20 billion
is expected to produce three million vehicles in 2003,
there is a kind of three-tier manufa c t u ring system.
The big multinational car-makers simply assemble
vehicles locally using parts supplied by sub-contrac-
t o rs belonging to the second and third tiers of the sys-
tem—some firms manufacture the parts and others
m a n u facture components for those part s.
g e t s , from the moment of purchase and progr e s s i ve l y
thereafter special access to a range of public and pri-
vate transport to make up for the car’s limitat i o n s
where distance and passengers are concern e d .T h i s
includes trains and planes,as well as cars for a larger
number of people to make the occasional long tri p.
And that ’s not all. H ayek is dreaming of an eve n
cheaper car than the “ s m a rt ” (which costs about
$10,000)—one that pollutes less, has more mechani-
cal innovations and can be used in an even more revo-
l u t i o n a ry way. He wants to start a kind of joint ow n e r-
ship system, or car-shari n g, where the owner only
uses it for ve ry brief periods when he or she really
needs it.
In fa c t , potential purchasers are being asked,
according to the advertising, to “drop old habits”
which are still so cumbersome, in fact give up the
idea of car-owning in the traditional sense,with all
the social significance of ow n e rs h i p, and to just
acquire a serv i c e .M e r c e d e s , the colossus, d i s a gr e e d
with Haye k , the inve n t o r , about that , and they
recently parted company. ■
One spare parts manufacturer is PRW A u t o-
m o t i ve , an A m e rican multinational with a $360-
million annual turnover and 2,900 workers spread
over eight plants in Brazil.“Our parts are designed
in association with the car-maker,” s ays Helder
Boccaletti,the firm’s marketing director. “We take
p a rt in project deve l o p m e n t , we design the part and
then pass on instructions to our components sup-
plier at the tier below.”
Metalpó is one of these suppliers which comes
into the picture at the end of the chain of com-
mand, far from the point of design.It is one of the
ve ry few companies which surv i ved the opening-
up of the Brazilian car market to foreign competi-
tion in the early 1990s. At its factory in São Paulo,
it has 200 wo r k e rs who produce an $18-million
annual turn ove r , only 10 per cent of which is
exports. Fifteen years ago, two-thirds of its custo-
m e rs were car assembly firms and the rest we r e
p a rts manufa c t u r e rs.To d ay the proportions are the
other way round. ■
