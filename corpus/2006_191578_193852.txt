The Courier looks back
since it began publication, the unesco courier has devoted many articles to desertification. 
it also explored other aspects of the desert environment, for example, as the natural setting 
of a world heritage site, or as an inspiring force for the human soul and the artistic spirit. 
or even as a challenge to ingenuity. here is a glimpse at some of them.
Issues
Deserts
January 1994  
This issue looks at the many facets 
of the desert – as a source of inspiration 
for artistic creation, a place of 
enlightenment for ascetics and mystics, 
or a sought-after provider of precious water 
which challenges man to create master-
pieces of hydraulic engineering. 
a halt to desert advance 
July 1977
What causes deserts to advance? 
How helpless is man faced with the  
ravages of desertification? These are only  
two of the disquieting questions raised 
in this issue, published on the occasion 
of the first UN Conference 
on Desertification in Nairobi (Kenya). 
sahel – land of no return? 
april 1975  
Years of disastrous drought have left 
destitute many of the nomad peoples 
in the Sahel. The fragile balance between 
man and the environment which enabled 
these herdsmen to subsist appears 
to have been destroyed. 
The issue examines their tragic plight 
and uncertain future. 
conquest of the desert
august/september 1955 
The mystery of how the camel can go for 
so long without water has been solved 
by a UNESCO-sponsored research team 
in the Sahara. This issue reviews 
the present status of the campaign to make 
the desert habitable and extend man’s 
realm to the driest regions of the planet. 
pushing back 
the desert frontiers 
July 1952 
The nine scientists in UNESCO’s 
new advisory committee on arid zone 
research see two major difficulties in the 
struggle to make arid zones productive: 
lack of information on what is being 
done and insufficient research 
on the international level. UNESCO 
seeks to fill in this gap.
