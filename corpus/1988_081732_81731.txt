THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Facts and figures
AUSTRALIA is the only nation to occupy an entire continent.
With a surface area of 7,682,300km2, it is nearly as large as the United States excluding
Alaska and Hawaii and almost twice the combined areas of India and Pakistan. The coastline
measures 36,735km.
It is the flattest continent. The average elevation is less than 300m, compared with
the world's mean of about 700m. Only about 5 % of the continent is more than 600m above
sea level. The highest peak is Mount Kosciusko (2,228m).
It is also the world's driest inhabited continent and vast areas are arid or semi-desert,
unsuitable for settlement. As a result it is sparsely populated, with an average of 2 persons
per km2.
Australia is one of the most urbanized nations : most of its 1 6 million people live in cities
and towns on the coastal fringes.
The climate ranges from tropical in the north to temperate in the south. Summer is from
December to February, autumn from March to May, winter from June to August, and spring
from September to November.
Immigration has played an important role in Australia's development since the earliest days
of European settlement. In the 4 decades since World War II, 4.2 million people from more
than 120 countries have settled there. Today, relative to population size, the immigration
intake (a projected 140,000 new arrivals for 1988) is larger than that of any other country. In
1986 one in every five Australians (3.4 million) was born overseas.
By origin the population comprises the following elements :
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (approx. 1 % of total population);
People from United Kingdom and Ireland backgrounds of 3 or more generations ago
(approx. 60 %);
People from non-English-speaking backgrounds of 3 or more generations ago
(approx. 5 %);
First and second generation Australians from an English-speaking background
(approx. 14 %);
Second generation Australians from a non-English-speaking background (approx. 8 %);
First generation Australians from a non-English-speaking background (approx. 12 %)
Some 15 % (1 .7 million people) of Australia's population aged 15 and over have a language
other than English as their first language. Major groups of non-English-speakers and their
numbers are asfollows: Italian: 440,776; Greek: 227,167; German: 165,633; Dutch: 110,540;
Polish: 86,016; Chinese: 85,000; Arabic: 77,565; Croatian: 65,882; Maltese: 60,000; Spanish:
56,500; Serbian: 27,000; Vietnamese: 27,252*. None of the 150 Aboriginal languages still
spoken has more than 3,000 speakers.
Comparison of trends between the censuses of 1976 and 1986 reveals that there has been
a significant increase in the number of speakers of Chinese, Arabic, Macedonian,
Vietnamese, Filipino languages, Spanish, Maltese, Portuguese and Polish.
During 1987 the Australian Government adopted a national policy on languages which has
as a major goal the encouragement of widespread bilingualism.
