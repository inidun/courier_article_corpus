1562 million women in the world
gainfully employed
The "Unesco Courier"
presents here and
on page 14 two
articles based on an
important world-wide
study carried out
by the International
Labour Office.
Entitled "Equality
of Opportunity and
Treatment for Women
Workers," (*) the
study was prepared
as a basis for a
general discussion on
this question at the
International Labour
Conference to be
held in Geneva in
June 1975.

WOMEN make up more
than a third of the wold's
economically active population and 46
out of every 100 women between 15
and 64 years of age are employed.
It is estimated that of the world's
1,637 million persons employed in
1975, about 562 million are women.
The female labour force in the more
developed regions some 187 million
in 1970 may be expected to increase
by some 20 million each decade and
to number about 254 million by the
year 2000. In the less developed
regions, the female labour force has
been estimated as reaching over
603 million in the year 2000.
The percentage of women in the
total labour force in the major areas
of the world varies considerably. The
lowest figure is found in Latin America
with about 20 per cent; Africa, South
Asia and Oceania have about 30 per
cent, while in Europe and Northern
America about 35 per cent of all
persons in the labour force are wo¬
men; East Asia has a rather high per¬
centage (about 39), while the U.S.S.R.
has the extremely high level of around
51 women for every 100 persons in
its labour force.
The available statistics indicate,
however, that in certain areas women
make up less than 12 per cent of the
total percentage of persons at work
(North Africa, Middle America [main¬
land], tropical South America, Poly¬
nesia and Micronesia), and in others
between 12 and 21 per cent (Southern
Africa, the Caribbean, temperate South
America, Middle South Asia, South
East Asia and Southern Europe).

In the United States women made
up 38 per cent of the total workforce
in 1972 as against 30 per cent in 1950.
In Canada the number of working
women rose from 27 per cent of the
total labour force in 1962 to over 33
per cent in 1972. Australia and New
Zealand have also both registered
considerable increases in women's
employment.
In Japan there has been a dramatic
rise in women's employment. In 1972
women workers represented 38 per
cent of the entire labour force and
48 per cent of the female population
of 15 years of age and over.
In Eastern Europe women continue
to play a highly important role in
economic life. In Hungary women con¬
stituted 42 per cent of the workforce
in 1971 (as against 38 per cent in
1963); in Czechoslovakia 47 per cent
in 1969 (as against 43 per cent in
1955); in Poland 40 per cent of the
labour force in 1972; and in Bulgaria,
at the end of 1971, women in employ¬
ment comprised 46 per cent of the
total active population. In Romania
and the German Democratic Republic
they represent nearly 50 per cent.
In the less developed countries the
great bulk of the female labour force
is still in agriculture (e.g. over 90 per
cent in some countries in Africa). In
most of the industrialized countries
the percentage of women in agricul¬
ture is low (under 10 per cent in many
cases and between 1 and 2 per cent
in the United Kingdom and the United
States).
With some exceptions (e.g. Asia),
women form a large part of the total

A high proportion of Asia's medical
students are women : 41 per cent in
Japan in 1970, 81 per cent in the Phi¬
lippines, 89 per cent in Jordan. The
same is true of Latin America (60 per
cent in Chile, 54 per cent in Paraguay
and 48 per cent in Cuba) and Eastern
Europe (76 per cent in Poland and
56 percent in Hungary and the U.S.S.R.).
In Africa, though facilities for medical
studies are still limited, the number of
women students of medicine is fairly
high in comparison with other subjects.

than half (51 percent) of South Korea's
students of medical sciences (medi¬
cine, dentistry, midwifery, pharmacy,
etc.) are women, though women only
constitute 24 per cent of all students
in higher education.

The percentage of women social science
students varies widely throughout the
world, ranging from under 16 per cent
(Fed. Rep. of Germany, Spain, Lebanon
and Turkey) to over 60 per cent (Bul¬
garia, U.S.S.R.). Between 1960 and
1970 there was a spectacular increase
in the number of women students, the
percentage doubling in Egypt and
Iraq (from 14 to 37 per cent and from
14 to 25 per cent respectively), almost
quadrupling in Indonesia (from 9 to
32 per cent), and actually reaching
53 per cent in the Philippines. In Latin
America, apart from Panama (46 per
cent) and Cuba (42 per cent), women
social scientists are still a small minority

^ labour force in the professional and
technical category, in some cases
actually outnumbering men (largely
because of the predominance of
women in educational and health
services). They comprise only a small
proportion of administrative, executive
and managerial workers. On the
other hand, they make up a large part
of the clerical workforce in many
countries, particularly in the more
developed ones, and form a high
proportion of the sales force in some
countries. In most countries they are
only thinly represented in the ranks of
craftsmen, production workers and
labourers.
In most countries women continue
to be concentrated in a limited number
of occupations in most instances at
relatively low levels of skill and
responsibility.
In this connexion it should be
pointed out that there is a clear
correlation between the education and
training of women and their partici¬
pation in economic activity. The
general rule appears to be that the
higher the levels of education the
greater the woman's commitment to
work, whether with or without short

T GEOLOGIST

natural radiation during a field survey.
In Egypt, 34 out of every 100 students
of the exact and natural sciences are
women. In Eastern Europe (Bulgaria,
Poland, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia
and Czechoslovakia) women constitute
at least -half of all science students.
The proportion is 20 per cent or less
in the Netherlands, Norway, Fed. Rep.
of Germany and Greece. In Asia the
proportion of women science students
is also low, except in Indonesia (32 per
cent), the Republic of Korea (42 per
cent) and Thailand (43 per cent).
Unesco's recent study reveals that
Latin America has the highest percen¬
tages of women enrolled in science
courses: just over 50 per cent in
Argentina and Ecuador, while Para¬
guay and Guatemala have twice as
many women science students as men.
interruptions for childbearing and
rearing. There is no such direct link
between the level of education and
the economic activity of men.
Another factor which influences
women's participation in economic life
far more than men's is the number and
age of their children. As long as in
most countries it continues to be
assumed that the mother bears the
principal responsibility for the care of
young children, and as long as the
social infrastructure in respect of child
care remains inadequate for the
demands made upon it, the presence
of preschool and primary-school
children will tend to have a limiting
effect on the labour force participation
of married women.
The increase in the number and
proportion of employed married
women has been accompanied by an
increase in the number and proportion
of working mothers.
In the United States, between 1940
and 1972, the number of working
mothers increased more than eight¬
fold. It is estimated that in Canada
1 million children have mothers who
work. In Western Europe and the Nor¬
dic countries the proportion of work-

the world there is a very high and cons¬
tantly increasing percentage of women
students in the arts and humanities (his¬
tory, literature, archaeology, languages,
psychology, etc.). In 1970, more than half
the arts students in 15 European countries
and most Latin American countries (81 per
cent in Argentina, for example) were
women. Asia too has a high proportion of
women arts students : 86 per cent in Thai¬
land, 61 per cent in Japan (as against
37 per cent in 1959), 46 per cent in Iran.

ing mothers with small children is
constantly increasing. In the Federal
Republic of Germany, more than a
quarter of the economically active
women have at least 1 child under
15 years of age.
In France, in 1968, among mothers
aged under 35, 51 per cent of those
with 1 child were at work. In Austria
the 1969 micro-census showed that
46 per cent of mothers with children
under 15 were working.
In the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe
a very high proportion of the women in
employment have dependent children.
In Poland about half of all women
workers had children under 16 years
of age in 1973.
Part-time employment has also con¬
tinued to increase. Although part-time
employment is not for women only,
the bulk of the part-time labour force
is made up of women. In some
countries the number of women
employed on a part-time basis is
considerable.
Some economists have advanced a
theory on a three-phase life for
women: the initial period of work com
ing before marriage and up to the birth
of the first or second child; the second
phase comprising withdrawal from
employment until the last child has
grown up; and the third phase being
the return to employment until the
normal age of retirement. This theory
has been contested on the basis of
facts brought out in recent studies of
the pattern of women's work and home
life in a number of countries.
In some of the more developed
western countries there is evidence of
a trend towards a continuous working
career as against the three-phase life-
work cycle; this sometimes takes the
form of full-time employment, with
sometimes some years on a part-time
basis, but there is a continuity of work.
There is also evidence that women's
commitment to work varies with the
level of education. In the socialist
countries the educational and social
system and policy presuppose an
almost continuous working career on
the part of the vast majority of women.
On the other hand, non-participation
after marriage remains a common
pattern among married women in some
of these countries, at least until the
children have grown up.
In many developing countries
women whether by necessity or by
choicetend to remain at work and
the cycle of their work life is largely
continuous. This may be traced partly
to family poverty, partly to the high
rate of women's participation in agri¬
culture and partly to other factors,
including the tradition of working hard
(as in Asia and Africa) and their
primary responsibility for family main¬
tenance.

percentage of students of education
throughout the world are women. In
17 European countries women consti¬
tute more than 50 per cent of all
such students and the figure reaches
70 per cent in Portugal, Hungary,
Italy, Sweden, etc. In Asia (Bangla¬
desh, Japan and Lebanon, for example)
the percentage of women education
students is at least twice as high as in
other disciplines. In Latin America,
the figures are 87 per cent for Argen¬
tina and 77 per cent for Brazil, but the
percentage of women education stu¬
dents in the continent dropped slightly
between 1960 and 1970. In Africa the
proportion of women studying educa¬
tion is higher than in other fields.
