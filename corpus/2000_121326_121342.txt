When computers chip
away at our memories
Galloping advances in information technology promise to give us instant access to all the world’s
knowledge. But how will human memory fare against the rise of the super-machine?
f the architects of technology’s next great
leap forward are to be believed, a l l
knowledge may soon be shrunk to
vanishing point. N a n o t e c h n o l o g y, o r
computing carried out at the scale of
a t o m s, is their byword for the future.Wi t h
its awesome potential,scientists at IBM
have recently argued,around 11 million
400-page volumes—the entire contents,
s a y,of Fr a n c e ’s National Library—could
be stored and primed for instant viewing
on a device the size of a human palm.
The ink may still be fresh on these
b l u e p r i n t s, but the elixir of portable
omniscience no longer seems so far away.
Seemingly cast-iron laws of ever
increasing computer power, along with
the rise of powerful new technologies,
appear to point to a horizon where all
that can be known and remembered can
be transferred to machines with which
human beings then interact at will.And it
is a future that for some is already spelling
big trouble for the brain.
Surveys point to yawning gaps
in general knowledge
“Computers not only distract us from
contemplation of deeper values; t h e y
discourage us from contemplation itself,”
declares Stephen Bertman, a classics
professor at Canada’s University of
Wi n d s o r, and author of the recent book
Cultural A m n e s i a. In his opinion, s o c i e t y ’s
love affair with fast and far- r e a c h i n g
machines—online computers, p a l m - t o p s
and mobile phones, all just for starters—
leads inexorably to memory loss rather
than gain.
As surveys repeatedly show,k n o w l e d g e
of history, l i t e r a t u r e, geography and even
current affairs seem to be on a steep
d e c l i n e : 60 percent of adult A m e r i c a n s
cannot recall the name of the president
who ordered the dropping of the fir s t
atomic bomb, just as 77 percent of young
Britons are perplexed by the words Magna
C a r t a .The day of the nano-shrunk library
could soon come,but will any of its users be
able to remember a single line of poetry?
The connection between these
yawning gaps in general knowledge and
information technology is by no means
e s t a b l i s h e d , but a host of thinkers in
different fields are sure the issue is one
that will shortly become all too pertinent.
“External support for our memory has a
direct effect on our memory,”argues Je a n -
Gabriel Ganascia, a leading neuro-
scientist based in Paris’ Pierre et Marie
Curie University.“At the same time as it
helps us and extends our physical
c a p a b i l i t i e s, it diminishes our individual
f a c u l t i e s.This is a vital question,one which
has been around for a long time. E v e n
Plato speaks in the P h a e d r u s of writing
being both a good and an evil for our
m e m o r y.”
Good or evil,writing has nevertheless
formed one of the main tools in the
evolution of human memory. Indeed it
is civilization’s unrelenting hunger for
placing memory in external stores—cave-
p a i n t i n g s, then manuscripts, l i b r a r i e s,
printed works and finally computers—
that has supported the entire march of the
s p e c i e s. As the Canadian
neuropsychologist Merlin Donald has
o b s e r v e d , each of these new technologies
has helped humans “ o f f - l o a d ” t h e i r
m e m o r i e s. Pre-literate societies, f o r
instance, depended on oral tradition for
their expertise—a practice undermined
by the flaws of overworked brains, t h o u g h
fertile ground for epic poetry.Through the
written word,memories were freed from
the head:knowledge could be stored for
retrieval in books,and then recrafted into
the sort of novel and complex codes on
which modern society is founded:
“examples might include the servicing
manuals for a rocket engine, t h e
equations proving the Pythagorean
t h e o r e m , a corporate income tax
handbook, or the libretto and score for
Eugene Onegin,” states Donald.
Becoming good
memory managers
The benefits of storing memory
outside the brain are unquestionable,b u t
the invention of printing over 500 years
ago followed by the post-war onset of
computing have added a new note to the
process:that of thundering acceleration.
One simple equation has come to
embody this. Known as Moore’s Law
after its inventor Gordon Moore, the co-
founder of Intel, it stipulates that
computing power—defined in terms of
capacity and speed per unit cost—doubles
every two years.The trend has held for the
last 40 years. Should it continue as
expected to around 2020, a personal
computer by that year will have exactly
the same processing power as a single
human brain.Add the promised marvels
of nanotechnology, optical and quantum
c o m p u t i n g, and machines might reach
utterly daunting proportions. “ O n e
penny’s worth of computing circa 2099
will have a billion times greater
computing capacity than all humans on
E a r t h ,”breezily announces Ray Ku r z w e i l ,
an American supremo of artificial
i n t e l l i g e n c e, in his book The Age of
Spiritual Machines.
Kurweil may well be too confident in
his predictions,but the quandary remains:
if computers become so quick, so mighty,
According to 
Moore’s Law,
computing power 
doubles every 
two years.

power as a single

so cheap, then where will the relatively
impoverished human mind fit in? Three
years ago, I B M ’s Deep Blue computer
beat the world’s finest fle s h - a n d - b l o o d
chess player , Garry Kasparov, over the
course of six games. If human functions
ultimately resemble moves of chess, t h e n
must the brain and its stores submit to the
superior wisdom of the microchip?
For many cognitive scientists, r e l a t i o n s
between mind and machine are already
undergoing drastic reconfiguration.
“Distributed intelligence” is the new
m a x i m , encapsulating all systems in which
individuals and computers mesh to carry
out a collective task,whether it be landing
an aircraft or tracking share prices. The
Internet is so far the crowning glory—a
system that in principle might combine
individual users into a potent “ g r o u p
m i n d .” For Norman Johnson from the
Symbiotic Intelligence Project at the Los
Alamos Laboratory, New Mexico, t h e
collective power unleashed by such a
system could solve problems far beyond
any individual’s capacity.
All of this may sound abstract,but the
effects on memory are being felt now.
Facts and figures no longer take pride of
place in school curricula. Within the past
two years, South Ko r e a , Singapore and
Hong Kong—havens of rote learning—
have debated plans to axe huge swathes of
standard classroom study. Experts in
education stress that students must learn
to be adaptable, skilled in manipulating
s y m b o l s, able to respond to new situations;
in short, ready to deal with the new
e c o n o m y, a realm where the computer is
k i n g.
“ We will need a lot of new skills,”
declares the neuro-psychologist Donald.
“ We have to become good memory
m a n a g e r s — w e ’ve moved away from
managing a lot in our heads to managing
memory devices.We have to devote more
space to this executive control and less to
rote memory storage.”
Nurturing imaginative 
thinking at school
As he acknowledges, the result is an
inevitable reduction in “ i n d i v i d u a l
presence.” It is a form of mental life that
has unsurprisingly earned bitter
r e c r i m i n a t i o n s. Earlier this year the
Alliance for Childhood joined the fray by
publishing a report entitled Fool’s Gold
attacking the numbing effects of
computers at school, above all primary
s c h o o l : “A heavy diet of ready-made
computer images and programmed toys
appears to stunt imaginative thinking.
Teachers report that children in our
electronic society are becoming
alarmingly deficient in generating their
own ideas and images.”
While proponents of the electronic
future insist on the liberating, e l e v a t i n g
potential of machines—Kurzweil even
suggests that we could “ p o r t ” our minds
onto super-powered computers for an
intellectually and sensually richer life—
suspicion continues to fester.As Ganascia
o b s e r v e s, human memory is much more
than simple information processing.Th e r e
a r e, for instance, at least five systems of
human memory, making up an
inordinately rich web of self-refle x i v e,
interweaving recollection that no
computer has even come close to imitating.
But if memory is increasingly stored in
machines that we then manage for our
l e a r n i n g, work and leisure, then how will
these systems in the brain fare? And how
will imagination, intelligence and
understanding—all of which depend on
an efficiently functioning memory—be
affected? The simple answer is:we still do
not know.
Yet one image stalks the debate. It is
not the old science fiction fear of a
malevolent computer (the HAL of 2 0 0 1 :
A Space Odyssey p e r h a p s ) ,but of a citizen
without a personal memory to speak of.
B e r t m a n , for one, is convinced that
