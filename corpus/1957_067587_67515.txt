FISH STALKING WITH T
\K llllons of people need more protein in their diet an
they could get it from fish. But the seaa vast
storehouse of food and mineral resources covering I 39 million
square miles, or two and a half times the world's land area
has hardly been tapped to meet the needs of Man. Today,
however, scientists are aiding fishermen to make bigger
catches (fish production is now about 11 million tons annually
compared with 22 millions tons in pre-war days) by provid¬
ing better equipment for locating and catching fish and by
devising more efficient operating methods. Photos on
these pages show some ways in which science is working
with the fishing industry. (I) School of menhaden (largest
of shadows in water is made by about 250,000 fish) is spotted
from the air. (2) Catching vessels directed to the school
by radio set their net around the fish. Remaining photos
show equipment used by scientists at Woods Hole Océano¬
graphie Institution, U.S.A., to delve into the ocean and study
plant and animal life. (3) Acoustical view finder for photo¬
graphing sound scattering animals whose presence is record¬
ed on an echo-sounder. Light is supplied by electronic flash
(lower left). (4) Underwater TV camera used by research
vessel Bear. (5) Biologist demonstrates on dead tuna his
tagging method. By marking many large tuna this way
scientists hope to learn more about their migration and
growth. Unesco aids development of océanographie research,
has set up an International Advisory Committee on Marine
Sciences. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's
Fisheries Division works to increase fish production. It has
given aid and advice in construction of new fish harbours,
exploitation of fishing grounds and has helped to introduce
better fishing methods and equipment in many countries.
