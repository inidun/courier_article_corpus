                                      young children in a rural kenyan community thrive 
                               thanks to “Loipi” community learning centres 
                                         that are culturally adapted to their needs.
Playing unDer the fig trees 
in Kenya
  oipi” means shade in the lan-
guage of the Samburu, traditional 
pastoralists who live in northern 
Kenya. In this hot, arid land, the 
precious area under the shade of 
trees plays an important role in 
people’s lives. Samburu men make 
community decisions in the shade 
of a tree specifically designated 
as the site of the council. And 
grandmothers, the time-honoured 
caregivers of Samburu children, 
traditionally feed the community’s 
cherished youngest members, 
teach them songs and tell them 
folk tales in a shady space under 
a large tree. 
Appropriately, the word associ-
ated with shade and gathering in 
Samburu now also refers to a cul-
turally-friendly educational initiative 
that ensures children are prepared 
for formal schooling. As partici-
pants in the Loipi Project, part of 
Kenya’s nationwide Early Child-
hood Care and Education pro-
gramme (see box), Samburu chil-
dren spend their days in communal 
enclosures called Loipi, playing 
and learning under fig trees with 
other children their age. 
“They grow up socializing in-
stead of in isolation,” says Mariam 
Lapukuyum, mother of six children. 
“We cannot assure a school edu-
cation in the city (Nairobi), but at 
the centres they are given a good 
foundation about life and every-
thing they may do when they grow 
up.” Adds another mother, Wilkis-
ter Murairu, “They are being taught 
things we never had the opportu-
nity to learn.”
There at least 85 Loipi in the 
sprawling Samburu district, and 
children from different communi-
ties gather at the closest one. In 
keeping with the project’s non-
intrusive approach and emphasis 
on tapping community resources, 
most materials used in the Loipi 
are locally made and produced 
and caregivers include mothers, 
grandmothers and other commu-
nity members. The programme is 
designed for children up to the

Samburu children.

age of four, after which they are 
encouraged to enroll in pre-school, 
if there is one. If not, activities for 
older children are incorporated 
into the Loipi. 
At one Loipi near the district 
headquarters of Maralal, about 
280 kilometres (175 miles) north 
of the capital, children listen to sto-
ries about humanity’s origins. They 
learn to wash their hands before 
eating. They sing, guess riddles 
and play football with cheap plas-
tic balls. Lessons are given using 
familiar objects - balls, pebbles, 
bottle tops and sticks. As one 
trainer explains, “At this stage, it’s 
rather complicated to use books. 
We teach using what the children 
like playing with. Unlike children 
raised in urban areas, they have no 
access to modern toys or Disney 
cartoons.” 
Games and other activities blend 
modern techniques to stimulate 
learning with traditional child-rear-
ing practices. “We let the children 
play, rest or sleep,” says Maria 
Kibasia, a centre volunteer. Adds 
instructor Martin Olanga with a 
smile, “We let them cry. We give 
them the freedom to understand 
life from a very young age.” Olanga 
was trained in government-spon-
sored early-childhood education 
seminars, during which, he says, 
teachers learn how to motivate a 
child’s “delicate mind”: “You let it 
do what it wants, but in a guided 
and safe way.” 
The Loipi children also receive 
other benefits, such as basic medi-
cal treatment and immunizations. 
On those days, parents are en-
couraged to come in with their chil-
dren to learn about health, hygiene 
and development. “For example, if 
a child needs to take medicine out-
side centre-hours, you must work 
with the parents,” says Kibasia. 
“Parents are becoming increas-
ingly cooperative, especially about 
the children’s health. This is en-
couraging.”
Improving chances 
for a brighter future
The results of the Loipi project are 
encouraging in many respects. First 
and foremost, “It helps children 
develop communication skills, im-
prove their social skills and develop 
physically,” said Gilbert Momanyi, a 
sociology lecturer at the University 
of Nairobi. In addition, the kids also 
learn about clean water, food secu-
rity, hygiene and communal values. 
These integrated interventions ben-
efit an estimated 27,000 children 
and their families in Samburu dis-
trict, according to a recent study 
entitled “Influencing and Develop-
ing Good Policy in Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) among Pasto-
ralist Communities in East Africa.” 
As a result, though they belong to 
one of the poorest communities 
in Kenya, 54 percent of Samburu 
children are enrolled in pre-school 
compared to a national average of 
45 percent. 
Rooted in the community, the Loipi 
project also empowers it, as centres 
become focal points for nutrition, 
health and wider community educa-
tion. Joseph Mwaura, a local admin-
istrator, describes how the centres 
create links to helpful NGOs, main-
tain children’s medical records and 
have gained government approval 
and support. The education minis-
try helps with educational materials 
and teachers; the health ministry 
supplies vaccines and medicines. 
And no wonder, says a Kenyan ed-
ucation ministry official: “Talk about 
killing several birds with one stone. 
Who wouldn’t want to support that 
project, which makes life so much 
easier?” 
The goal now is to extend the 
project to other countries facing 
similar challenges, where tradi-
tional nomadic pastoralist commu-
nities are in transition to sedentary 
settlement. According to Oxfam’s 
2005 statistics, between 25 and 
40 million school-age children in 
the world live in nomadic pastoral-
ist societies, and only 10 to 50% 
attend school. The Loipi model is 
now being implemented in Kenya, 
Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nigeria 
and Namibia.

Localizing 
early Childhood 
education
In Kenya, an experimental 
programme for early childhood 
education started in the early 
1970s with teacher training 
and curriculum development. 
the government established 
the project on national level 
in 1983, with support from 
the Dutch bernard van Leer 
Foundation, which specializes 
in early childhood education 
programmes.
In the 1980s the state-run Kenya 
Institute of Education and  
the Christian Children Fund (CCF) 
formed a partnership to improve 
the lifestyle in the Samburu region, 
which sits in the dustbowl of Kenya. 
In 1995, experts came to 
the Samburu district and carried out 
a study on child rearing practices 
among the community called 
“Influencing and Developing Good 
Policy in Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) among 
Pastoralist Communities in East 
Africa.” The main reason for the study, 
experts say, was to revive 
and enhance child rearing practices 
that had been strained by hardship, 
poverty and inter-tribe wars. 
“This led to a completely 
new atmosphere with the parents 
and communities, because the study 
directly involved them and drew on 
their knowledge and experience for 
the first time,” Tanja van de Linde said 
in the study. Now, for example, 
children are taught in their mother 
tongue in the Loipi.
