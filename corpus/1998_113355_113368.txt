Turkey: a course for   t
Specialization, proliferating courses, regionalization 
and privatization are key trends in Turkey’s changing
university system
nigh impossible to pass the exams without pri-
vate tuition, which became a big part of the edu-
c ation system, draining candidat e s ’ resources and
swa l l owing up eve ry year the equivalent of 40 per
cent of the national higher education bu d g e t .
The “ s u rv i vo rs ” of this rigorous selection
process have no problem getting jobs afterwa r d s ,
but the fact remains that of 100 children ente-
ring pri m a ry school, only 11 reach unive rsity and
only 17 per cent of them leave with a degr e e .
This ye a r , h owe ve r , things will be much easier
due to a switch from a two-stage exam to a single
o n e . But no one is expecting any miracles. Tu r-
key has a long way to go before it reaches its goal
of a 35 per cent enrolment rate in higher educa-
t i o n .
Yet Turkish higher education has come a long
way since 1923, when the republic was proclai-
m e d . Then the country had only 5,000 schools,
with 360,000 pupils and 12,000 teachers. We s-
t e rn-style schools had begun to appear in the
eighteenth century, but education had remained
largely in the hands of clerical and Koranic ins-
titutions which refused to train students to be
open-minded and think for themselve s. I n d e e d
they were one of the reasons for the collapse of
the Ottoman Empire. When the modern - m i n d e d
Kemal A t atürk came to powe r , the education sys-
tem was drastically reform e d . The country ’s

Change is in the air as the 1998-1999 Tu r-
kish academic year begi n s. The focus is
on the entrance exams, reputedly so
tough that students often have to retake them
t wo or three times before passing, or else gi ve
u p, with the luckiest going off to study abroad.
The selection process up to now has been in
t wo stages. In the first exam, with a more than 50
per cent failure rat e , c a n d i d ates had to get 20
points before they could go on to the second,
which determined which unive rsity they went to.
Students who got 105 of the 120 possible points
in this exam won the right to take an extra-mural
d e gr e e . So they had to stick at it. It was also we l l
The University of Istanbul 
became a modern institution 
in 1933.

oldest unive rs i t y, I s t a n bul Darülfünun, a bastion
of conservatism which shied away from the
s c i e n c e s , was turned into a modern secular insti-
tute of higher education in 1933 and renamed
I s t a n bul Unive rs i t y.
It openly welcomed Jewish academics fle e i n g
the Nazi exterm i n ation and completely transfor-
med itself. A t at ü r k ’s passion for science encou-
raged the founding of other unive rsities along the
same lines, notably the Istanbul Technical Uni-
ve rsity (ITU) in 1944 and the Unive rsity of
Ankara two ye a rs lat e r. The second big educa-
tional reform came in 1946, when unive rs i t i e s
won an independence which, despite poor wo r-
king conditions, made them the envy of many
u n i ve rsities in the We s t .Two other major reform s
f o l l owe d , in 1961 and 1981.
The number of unive rsities had meanwhile
gr own to twe n t y - s e ve n , each with its own sta-
tutes and way of operat i n g . This hasty and ill-
thought-out expansion caused many problems,
especially in harmonizing cours e s. The army
cited the chaotic situation in education to justify
its seizure of power in 1980 and
cut back unive rsity autonomy, c a u-
sing many lecturers to flee abroad.
The higher education law of 1981
i nvo l ved co-ordinating and stan-
dardizing the stru c t u r e s , duties and
responsibilities of all institutes of
higher education and linking them
to each other. All were to be at t a-
ched to unive rsities and a new
council for higher educat i o n
( YOK) was put in charge of plan-
ning and co-ordinating the reform s. The YO K
was ve ry controve rsial at the begi n n i n g, but it
still exists today, though with different powe rs
since the mid-1990s.
Some schools, k n own as “other educat i o n a l
i n s t i t u t i o n s ” , do not come under YOK bu t
va rious gove rnment ministri e s. For example, o n e
which teaches “health sciences” is attached to
the health ministry. Another teaches “ i n t e rn a l
s e c u rity serv i c e s ” i nvolving military colleges and
the police academy.
More and more higher education institutions
are spri n ging up, largely due to pri vat i z at i o n .T h e
f i rst pri vate unive rsities were founded in the
1960s but closed a decade later because of
p o o r l y - c o n s t ructed courses and degrees of little
va l u e . The 1981 reform law allowed only chari-
table foundations to set up pri vate unive rs i t i e s.
By 1988, 32 of the 33 existing unive rsities we r e
s t at e - ru n . To d ay there are 72 unive rs i t i e s , 18 of
them pri vat e l y - o p e r at e d . In Istanbu l , there are
six state unive rs i t i e s , but 12 pri vate ones.
The pri vate institutions, which generally have
a good reputat i o n , help the gove rnment avoid the
o u t flow of curr e n cy caused by a wholesale depar-
ture of young people to study abroad. They are
also a ray of light for hundreds of thousands of
high-school gr a d u ates who cannot get into stat e -
run unive rs i t i e s. The snag is that tuition fees are
ve ry high, e ven though the gove rnment subsi-
dizes up to 40 per cent of the cost for some stu-
d e n t s.
As well as being pri vat i z e d , higher educat i o n
has also been regi o n a l i z e d . In A t at ü r k ’s day, t h e
goal was to set up a secondary school in each
p r ov i n c e . The aim today is a unive rsity in each
o n e . This has produced many institutions whose
existence owes more to electoral politics than
academic considerat i o n s , along with abnorm a l i-
ties like faculties with only one teacher. G r a-
d u ates from these unive rsities find jobs, but not
the best ones.
The labour market is increasingly deman-
d i n g . Although education is divided up into four
s t a g e s – u n d e r gr a d u at e , gr a d u ate and masters
(each requiring from two to four ye a rs of study),
and then a doctorate–the only qua-
l i f i c ations employe rs are really
interested in are master’s degr e e s
or doctorat e s.
But the number of subjects on
offer at each stage is gr owing all
the time. More than a dozen new
d e gree courses were offered in
1997 alone and drew a large num-
ber of students, though this gi ve s
no real indication of whether the
c o u rses teach skills which enable
students to get jobs afterwa r d s. They may be
more of a fallback for students who failed to get
into the unive rsity of their choice because they
did not score well enough in the entry exam.
U n i ve rsity places are in demand, so exam results
d e t e rmine which students go where.
S p e c i a l i z ation and the proliferation of cours e s
are the broad trends. This is particularly true of
p ri vate courses at master’s leve l , where no fewe r
than 16 new subjects have been created in the
past academic ye a r , including wo m e n ’s studies,
r o b o t i c s , aerospace studies, s e i s m o l o g y, fa m i l y
medicine and gerontology.
At this rat e ,Turkey will have plenty of expert s
at the start of the new millennium. But there are
still big problems to sort out. More than two -
thirds of the country ’s 1,400,000 students are
m a l e , which is not surp rising since a fifth of Tu r-
kish women are illiterat e . A l s o, the average time
a Turk spends in school is still only betwe e n
three and six ye a rs. ■
