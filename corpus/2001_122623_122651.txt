t r a n s a c t i o n s

the description of
economists?
N o. Th e
economists’ myth tells us that exchange
f u l fills a simple instrumental function.
You live in a community that produces
yams and I live in a community that
raises pigs, so we enter into an
exchange in order to vary our diets.
One fine day, to facilitate our
t r a n s a c t i o n s, we invent a system of
equivalence between our products—
money—and there you have it. B u t ,a s
anthropologists have shown us, M a r c e l
Mauss in particular, the main form of
exchange in so-called “ p r i m i t i v e ”
societies is the gift, which cannot be
reduced to economic rationality.
that makes this point: “ Your own
m o t h e r, your own sister, your own pigs,
your own yams,you may not eat.Th o s e
of other people,you may eat.” If you eat
your own yams,your neighbour is liable
to think they’re better than his, a n d
your relationship could turn
acrimonious.
Even if my yams are just like his?
Even then, there could arise what
the thinker René Girard (see inset)
calls a mimetic rivalry, based on
reciprocal imitation. The neighbour
who sees you feasting on your yams
will want to do the same as you, that is,

We don’t even know their

anthropologist Mark
Anspach1, the market
economy has not succeeded
in ridding us
of sacrifice. And yet, its
rationality was supposed to
distance us from ritual
violence and those who
practice it
You mean to say that people did not
invent exchange in order to satisfy their
material needs?
In “ p r i m i t i v e ”s o c i e t i e s, families may
be quite capable of producing what is
necessary for their subsistence. A n d
y e t , they will still enter into exchanges.
Why? For the sake of exchanging—of
forging relations with others and
participating in the circle of positive
reciprocity on which social life is
f o u n d e d .To refuse to exchange, to keep
what one has for oneself, amounts to a
kind of incestuous indulgence, a s
Claude Lévi-Strauss observes. H e

he will want to eat your yams. Wh a t
seems to be desirable to you becomes
desirable for him. But if he tries to
appropriate your yams for himself, y o u
w o n ’t want to surrender them. Wh a t
is desirable for him becomes equally
desirable for you. In this manner
people can easily come to blows over
n o t h i n g. Ritual prohibitions serve to
prevent rivalries of this kind.The incest
t a b o o, for example, keeps men from
fighting for the women who are closest
at hand, those who belong to the same
f a m i l y.A crime of passion could trigger
a general crisis. It is hard for us to
conceive just how dangerous the
slightest dispute can be in a community
with no police or judicial system. A s
with a hemophiliac, any bloodshed
could prove fatal. If you kill your
neighbour when he tries to grab your
yams, his relatives will come after you
n e x t . Each act of violence must be
avenged by a new act of violence, and
the ensuing chain reaction can
ultimately engulf the entire community.
Doesn’t this approach betray the belief
that human beings are fundamentally
violent?
People are not fundamentally
violent,they are fundamentally social.
Once they have satisfied their material
instincts—eating and reproducing—
they still sense a lack. They desire
something more, but what? Since
Fr e u d ,we assume that desire is the most
i n d i v i d u a l ,most intimate thing there is
about a person. For René Girard, this is
a romantic myth. On the contrary,
people do not know what to desire, it is
something they must learn.And they
learn it in the same way they learn all
the essential things in life: by observing
and imitating others. Humans are
incomplete beings who are born
radically dependent on others. It is no
wonder they show themselves to be
fascinated by others. But it is precisely
p e o p l e ’s fascination with each other
which brings them so easily into confli c t ,
and can sometimes embroil them in the
worst forms of violence.
All your explanations presuppose a
universal human nature.
I believe one should stand firm on
this point: y e s, there is a universal
human nature. That does not mean
that people everywhere are identical.
Since people do not know instinctively
what they want to do in life, t h e i r
culture must offer them answers.
O b v i o u s l y, the range of answers varies
from one culture to another. It is not
such and such a model of behaviour
that is universal,it is the need to have
m o d e l s. If people do not know what to
desire, if each person tends to desire
what others desire, the culture must
channel desires in such a way that they
do not constantly converge on the
same objects.It must defuse the vicious
circleof reciprocal desire, where each
wants what the other wants, or risk
descending into reciprocal violence.
The paradoxical law of revenge
commands the killing of the killer.A n d
the killer’s killer? Here one falls into a
new vicious circle.
And is there any way out?
What interests me is precisely to
see how the shift is made from vicious
circles to virtuous ones, from the
negative reciprocity of violence to the
positive reciprocity of the gift. Wi t h
v e n g e a n c e, each person responds to an
offence committed by the other, each
reacts to what the other has already
d o n e. This comes down to letting
oneself be dominated by the past. I n
gift exchange, on the other hand, one
turns toward the future and anticipates
the desire of the other. Instead of
waiting for your neighbour to come
steal your yams, you offer them to him
t o d a y, and it is up to him to do the same
for you tomorrow.Once you have made

a gift,he is obliged to make a return gift.
Now you have set in motion a positive
circularity.
One which makes it possible to escape
the circle of violence?
Ye s, but through one last act of
v i o l e n c e. By killing a “ s a c r i fic e a b l e ”
violent reci- procity of the gift.
But how does market exchange come
to take the place of the gift?
First let’s see what distinguishes
t h e m . When you offer me so many
sheep, or shells, or shields, you make a
display of your prestige, and I must at
least match your generosity with a
return gift. On the contrary,a monetary
payment nips the relationship in the
b u d : it relieves one of any return
o b l i g a t i o n .A market transaction leaves
the seller and buyer free of any ties.
Just as the gift breaks the circle of
vengeance, money breaks the circle of
the gift. I asked myself how such a
transaction could arise within a ritual
c o n t e x t . In Vedic writings from ancient
India, we see that monetary payment
begins with the compensation of the
s a c r i ficial priest, a b r a h m a n who carries
out a dangerous task and whom one
prefers to keep at arm’s length.In the
Greek world, money is associated with
the figure of the tyrant.He is a usurper,
a king whose legitimacy does not derive
from traditional structures. To get
around the system of reciprocal
obligations which he challenges, h e
must resort to employing mercenaries,
whom he pays off with money. War, a
ritual activity, becomes a professional
o n e. In our monetary economies, a l l
transactions involve this distancing
mechanism which originally targeted
those charged with carrying out ritual
v i c t i m , meaning one
whose death will not
trigger further acts of
vengeance within the
g r o u p : a slave, a n
imprisoned enemy, an
animal.… In a peace
ritual described by
a n t h r o p o l o g i s t
Raymond Jamous, the
murderer leads his
people to the territory
of his victim.His hands
bound and a knife in
his teeth, he offers
himself as a new
v i c t i m , he anticipates
the desire for revenge
of his adversaries. But
rather than killing the
murderer as they
would if the cycle of
vengeance were to
c o n t i n u e, they take the
knife and sacrifice an
animal in his stead.To
seal the end of
h o s t i l i t i e s, t h e
members of both camps join together
in eating the animal.Not only will this
victim not be avenged,but it provides
the feast which launches a new cycle of
positive reciprocity.The rite which puts
an end to a vendetta facilitates the
transition between the reciprocal
violence of vengeance and the non-
Abraham and Isaac:the birth of an “anti-sacrificial”consciousness.

“If your neighbour is h u n g r y, you have
n o o b l i g a t i o n to feed him”
violence.
So you trace market exchange back to
sacrificial rituals?
In these examples we already see
the beginning of an impulse to thrust
away the operators of sacrifice. Later,
s a c r i fice itself will be banished.All our
history is a long process of awakening
an anti-sacrificial consciousness.Fi r s t ,a n
animal replaces the human victim, as in
the story of Abraham and Isaac. Then
the day comes when people hesitate
even to butcher the animal. R e n é
Girard attributes the origin of this
awakening of consciousness to the
Biblical texts, the Gospels in particular.
One may also find anti-sacrificial
messages in other traditions, i n
Buddhism for example. But one does
not have to be Christian to
acknowledge the force of René Girard’s
analyses, or to follow him in reflecting
on where the decay of religious myths
and rituals may lead.If sacrificial rites,
while producing victims, made it
possible to avoid even greater violence,
what will happen in the absence of
rites? We know that human progress
has always been fragile, with steps
backward accompanying every step
f o r w a r d . I believe it is important,
n e v e r t h e l e s s, to defend the notion of
p r o g r e s s. Even if we continue to
persecute victims, we are now ashamed
to do so:that is progress.
We have learned to recognize the victims.
But our morality adapts quite well to
the market economy, which also
produces victims of another sort.
Monetary transactions sever the
bond between exchange partners; t h e y
eliminate all obligations of reciprocity.
If your neighbour is hungry, you have
no obligation to feed him; if he is
evicted from his home and freezes to
d e a t h ,you have no obligation to avenge
h i m . As Canadian philosopher Paul
Dumouchel observes, the elimination of
the obligation of revenge keeps
violence from spreading from one
individual to the next,but at the same
time it universalizes the category of
“ s a c r i fic e a b l e ” v i c t i m s, those whose
death will not result in vengeance. In
this sense, we continue to sacrifice
anonymous victims. In his book L e
sacrifice et l’envie (“Sacrifice and
E n v y ” ) ,French philosopher Je a n - P i e r r e
Dupuy shows the extent to which the
spectre of sacrifice haunts the thinking
of the major theorists of the market
economy.
Why not set ourselves the objective of
returning to the gift?
We have not completely left it,
f o r t u n a t e l y. G i f t s, including services
within the household, still hold an
important place. In Fr a n c e, by the
conservative estimate of one economist,
Ahmet Insel, gifts are of a magnitude
equivalent to about three-quarters of
G D P. We should aim for a balance
between the gift sector and the market
sector. But this balance is threatened
today by the imperialism of market
l o g i c. It is that logic therefore which
must be questioned. O b v i o u s l y, we will
not go back to archaic forms of
e x c h a n g e. These presuppose a ritual
framework which has vanished.A new
religion cannot be made to order.
But hasn’t the market economy take n
the place of religion?
The ritual framework of primitive
exchanges entails the presence of
invisible mediators. The spirit of the

gift obliges the recipient to make a
return gift,Marcel Mauss tells us.A d a m
S m i t h , the father of liberal political
e c o n o m y, likewise invokes a hidden
spirit when he talks about the invisible
hand of the market. Of course, h e
means this as a simple metaphor: the
market is supposed to be self-
r e g u l a t i n g, functioning best without
visible intervention on the part of the
S t a t e. But nothing guarantees that, l e f t
to itself, the market will converge on a
satisfactory equilibrium. History tends
rather to prove the opposite. In this
s e n s e, the doctrine of the invisible hand
does depend on quasi-religious faith. I t
serves mainly to absolve people of the
consequences of their actions.
When a jumbo jet falls to the
g r o u n d , there is an investigation to
determine who is responsible.But every
day, the number of people who die of
hunger in the world is equivalent to
the number who would perish if several
hundred jumbo jets crashed. N o
investigation is needed: the market is
r e s p o n s i b l e. Which is another way of
saying nobody. Nobody is individually
responsible for a violence which is
collectively accepted, just as the
violence of sacrifice is collectively
accepted.
The opponents of market globalization
advocate the establishment of “ f a i r
t ra d e.” Isn’t this a contradiction in terms,
if the market is by nature irre s p o n s i b l e ?
Why not develop fair trade? In
r e a l i t y, the partisans of market
globalization claim that they themselves
want to promote the interests of poor
w o r k e r s.This is a good illustration of the
ethical progress we were talking about:
everybody recognizes the central
importance of the victims. But the alibi
is pretty flimsy because poor workers
are perfectly able to determine what is
in their own interest. Their union
representatives could organize an
international summit to negotiate a fair
framework for trade themselves—at
Davos, for example. Just as war is too
serious a matter to be left to the
generals, trade is too serious to be left
to the captains of finance.
Montesquieu said that the natural effect
of trade is to lead to peace.Your analyses
do not seem to confirm this adage.
Globalization means the
development of market exchange
among nations. N o w, despite the
existence of the United Nations, t h e
international arena still displays one of
the essential features of primitive
s o c i e t y : the absence of the State. In true
primitive societies, where gift exchange
p r e d o m i n a t e s, one sometimes finds
transactions quite similar to market
e x c h a n g e. These transactions are
practiced solely with foreigners towards
whom no duty of solidarity exists.Wi t h
them,one has the right to cheat,steal,
or wage war. Lévi-Strauss alludes to
markets of this type where buyers and
sellers are ready to fight at the slightest
provocation and goods are offered at
s p e a r- p o i n t .That reminds me of a N e w
York Times journalist, an advocate of
globalization, who explained that the
invisible hand of the market must be
accompanied by an iron fist. I am
skeptical about the idea that an
expansion of international trade leads
to peace.The same idea was expressed
the last time a comparable level of
economic integration between
countries was reached, early in the last
century.
And?
And then the First World War came
along and dispelled this illusion.
