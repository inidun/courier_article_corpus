Set up by UNESCO in 1960, the Inter-
governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)
is the only United Nations body with responsibility for
basic oceanographic research. Its mission is to coordi-
nate international research programmes aimed at
improving ocean management and to advise its 125
Member States. The Global Ocean Observing System
(GOOS) and the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific
are two notable IOC endeavours. GOOS, set up after
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is the super-
watchdog of the seas. Using information collected by
thousands of coastal satellite stations, planes, drifting
buoys and ocean research vessels, it seeks to unders-
tand and predict trends in the marine environment.
The purpose of the Tsunami Warning System in the
Pacific is to avoid tragedy by forecasting tsunamis,
giant seismic sea waves which took 2,000 lives and
wreaked a billion dollars in damage between 1992
and 1996.
