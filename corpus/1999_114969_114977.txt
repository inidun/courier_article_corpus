We now have less than half the amount of water
available per capita than we did 50 years ago. In
1950,world reserves, (after accounting for agricultural,
industrial and domestic uses) amounted to 16.8 thousand
cubic metres per person. Today, global reserves have
dropped to 7.3 thousand cubic metres and are expected to
fall to 4.8 thousand in just 25 years.
Scientists have developed many ways of measuring
supplies and evaluating water scarcity. In the maps at right,
“catastrophic”levels mean that reserves are unlikely to
sustain a population in the event of a crisis like drought.
Low supplies refer to levels which put in danger industrial
development or ability to feed a population.
Just 50 years ago, not a country in the world faced
catastrophic water supply levels. Today, about 35 per cent
of the population lives under these conditions. By 2025,
about two-thirds will have to cope with low if not
catastrophic reserves. In contrast,“water rich”regions and
countries—such as northern Europe, Canada,almost
everywhere in South America,Central Africa,the Far East
and Oceania—will continue to enjoy ample reserves.
The sharp declines reflect the soaring water demands of
growing populations, agricultural needs and
industrialization.In addition, nature has been far from even-
handed.More than 40 per cent of the water in rivers,
reservoirs and lakes is concentrated in just six countries:
Brazil,Russia,Canada,the United States, China and India.
Meanwhile just two per cent of river, reservoir and lake
water is found in about 40 per cent of the world’s land
mass.
As a result,in 2025 Europe and the United States will
have half the per capita reserves they did in 1950, while
Asia and Latin America will have just a quarter of what they
previously enjoyed. But the real drama is likely to hit Africa
and the Middle East, where available supplies by 2025 may
be only an eighth of what they were in 1950. n
