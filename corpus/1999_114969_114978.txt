Colin Green:“Water as an economic 
resource” is generating tremendous
controversy and discussion.
What does this mean in practical terms?
John Briscoe: Two things. F i rs t , there is a cost
a s s o c i ated with providing services like water supply
or irri g at i o n .As with other serv i c e s ,u s e rs should pay
for the cost of those services to ensure among other
things accountability to users and financial
sustainability. In developing countries, it is often
claimed that services must be subsidized to protect
the poor.Yet in virtually every case, the influential
or powerful people benefit from the subsidy, while
the poor don’t receive formal services and end up
p aying water ve n d o rs about ten times more than the
cost of the serv i c e .There is broad agreement on this.
The second point is more subtle and
c o n t e s t e d — w h at economists call the “ o p p o rt u n i t y
cost of water”.Imagine a basin where all the water
is already used.By using one cubic metre of water
(even if it is free),I impose a cost on everyone else
who is denied the opportunity to use that wat e r. I n
technical term s , the highest value of the use denied
is called “the opportunity cost”.The controversy
stems from how to deal with this cost.In the past,
the general solution has been that “ g ove rn m e n t
will allocate wat e r.” But it has become painfully
clear that gove rnments are not ve ry good at this task.
There are several altern at i ve s : one is to charge users
a price and thus ration a scarce resource.This is
strongly resisted by current users , with good reason,
since it is really an abrogation of an existing form a l
or informal property ri g h t .A more creat i ve approach
has been to assign property rights to users and then
allow them to trade those rights.This is not a “free
m a r k e t ” . I n d e e d , it requires a gr e at deal of
r e g u l at i o n . I n f o rmal markets have long existed
w h e r e ver there has been water scarcity. But in recent
d e c a d e s , there has been enormous progress in
establishing formal markets in places like Californ i a
in the United States,Chile,Australia and Mexico.
Bernard Barraqué:Water is first a natural resource,
and in some cases it becomes both a social and
economic good. In Europe, we tend to think that a
price should not be attached to water in its natural
e nv i r o n m e n t . C o nve rs e l y, the cost of installing
technology to make this water useful should be at
least partly covered by users.
Under European water laws, people can take
small amounts of water directly from the source for
free.The general trend in the public water system
is for consumers to pay a small flat fee for the
connection or for a basic allowance of wat e r.B e yo n d
that,they pay for what they use.
In the case of non-domestic users fully or ove r -
exploiting a basin, I think that there should be
abstraction levies, p a rticularly for irri g at i o n .A ve ry
small levy on irri g at o rs can liberate a lot of water for
other users. H owe ve r , it is important to unders t a n d
that these economic incentives (levies) are more
e f ficient when they are set up by “ u s e rs ’b o a r d s ”t h a n
by central regulators.
Colin Gre e n : Is the water crisis really a food crisis? Is
the problem the availability of water for irrigation?
John Briscoe offers a similar response to that of
Bernard Barraqué: I rri g ation is the wo r l d ’s biggest
user (of water) because water is not only abstracted
but also evaporates, meaning it does not return to

Colin Green: Economists have developed a variety
of ways to assess the value of natural resources.
But for some people, a resource like wetland has an
intrinsic value which cannot be measured in dollars.
How do we include these moral concerns in
economic analyses?
John Briscoe: I would not call a wetland a “ m o r a l
c o n c e rn ” . It is something people value or wa n t
because it provides a va riety of ve ry import a n t
services,including aesthetic ones and even just so
t h at it will exist. The logical approach is to fin d
ways of getting stake-holders to manage
c o m p r e h e n s i vely the wetland and the entire aquat i c
ecosystem.
Bernard Barraqué: Some suggest that by pricing
the “services” flowing from that wetland, we can
ensure that people value and respect that resource.
I don’t agree with this. Economists have not yet
found a way of truly eva l u ating all of the assets of a
resource like a wetland.
Colin Green: Many economists believe that all uses
of water should be charged at the price equal to
the costs of making that water available. Are prices
really effective in reducing the use and waste of
water?
John Briscoe: Water pricing and metering are
c e rtainly effective in reducing demand. It isn’t hard
to see why this should be the case, since it is true for
everything else we consume.
Bernard Barraqué: Water supply systems are cheap
to run but expensive to bu i l d . This is basically why
d e veloping countries installing a water supply scheme
must rely on heavy subsidies and cheap loans, just as
d e veloped countries did in the past. Once the initial
systems have been completed, then it becomes possible
to raise the prices to cover long-term maintenance of
the systems, as is the case in nort h e rn Europe.
Water meters don’t necessarily lead to reduced
c o n s u m p t i o n . Most European studies have show n
t h at consumption of water for indoor purp o s e s —
d ri n k i n g, c o o k i n g, and bathing—does not va ry
according to the price charged. C o nve rs e l y, o u t d o o r
uses—like filling swimming pools, washing cars and
wat e ring gardens—are more sensitive to pri c e s.So we
h ave to be careful about making blanket stat e m e n t s
c o n c e rning meteri n g . There is another point to be
m a d e . While there is a lot of talk about domestic
m e t e ri n g, little attention has gone to the savings that
could result from metering large irri g ation schemes.
Colin Green: Some economists argue that rights to
abstract water should be made tradable. This
requires that individuals have a legal right to
abstract water, which implies a sense of ownership.
Should existing laws be changed to create that
right?
John Briscoe: Where there is wat e r , there are
implicit rights to that water and conflicts over those
ri g h t s. By formally defining these ri g h t s , we can
establish clearer and more efficient ways of dealing
with a problem that is intrinsic to human existence.
The “trading system”in question has proven to be
a success in places like Californ i a , where laws we r e
passed authorizing fa rm e rs to sell their water ri g h t s
to cities during a drought.The economic and social
benefits of this system are clear.
Bernard Barraqué: In Europe,“ p ri vat e ” wat e rs are
declining in import a n c e , but this does not mean that
they have become “ g ove rn m e n t - ow n e d ” .E u r o p e a n s
generally consider water to be a common propert y,
which can be used but not ow n e d . In most cases, t h e
s t ate does not assume the role of direct manager of
the resources but acts as a kind of guarantor that
different kinds of users share the resources according
to equity, equality and ethical pri n c i p l e s. T h i s
balanced system allows more flexibility than
p ri vat i z ation of resources, and what ’s more it can be
accompanied by monetary compensat i o n .
Colin Green: Is the argument for privatization a
practical one or is it essentially ideological?

John Briscoe: B o t h . This is a big subject, w i t h
many red herrings! No one has truly “privatized”
water services except England and Wa l e s.We more
commonly find what French colleagues call
“ d e l e g ated management”, in which ow n e rs h i p
remains public while pri vate operat o rs are
responsible for a va riety of tasks which they do
better than public operat o rs. There is no magi c
r e g u l at o ry solution to the monopoly problem in
which water is either a public or a private domain.
I strongly believe that a mixed system in which
public operat o rs look over their shoulders at pri vat e
c o m p e t i t o rs , and vice-ve rs a ,o f f e rs the best hope for
getting people good services at a reasonable cost.
Bernard Barraqué: I agree with John that mixed
systems are in fact superi o r.There is a wide arr ay of
p a rtial pri vat i z ation schemes across We s t e rn Europe.
In practice, “ p ri vat i z at i o n ”o c c u rs when the public
system fa i l s. There is a general feeling that
p ri vat i z ation is the only choice. But there are
a l t e rn at i ve s. For example, some countries might
find it advantageous to tie together different kinds
of services like gas, electricity and water in a more
efficient system of financing and billing.
Colin Green: Public participation is considered a
critical ingredient to sustainable development. How
can we combine increased public participation with
privatization?
John Briscoe: Astute observers have argued that
the gr e atest benefit of getting the pri vate sector
involved is precisely that it brings greater public

scrutiny, openness and accountability. In England
and Wales (considered by some to be a model of
water pri vat i z at i o n , but a model I am personally not
a fan of), the local community, p r e s s , and public at
large are much more invo l ved than they were before
privatization.
When people are faced with unresponsive and
unaccountable bureaucracies, they tend to resign
t h e m s e l ves to inefficient serv i c e s.They don’t vo i c e
their demands.With pri vat i z at i o n , people are pay i n g
for a service,have a clear view of the obligations of
the provider and will not accept poor services. In
m a ny countries which have experi e n c e d
p ri vat i z at i o n , we find people beginning to make
the same demands of publicly provided services.
This may prove to be the gr e atest benefit associat e d
with private water management.
Bernard Barraqué: I disagree with John concern i n g
public part i c i p ation in England and Wa l e s.
P ri vat i z ation led to an adve rs a rial form of
p a rt i c i p at i o n . In France also, people tend to have less
c o n fidence in pri vate management.This might be a
good reason to keep some role for local gove rn m e n t .
P ri vat i z ation is ideologically based on
“consumerizing” a service. In the process, people
assume the role of a customer, not a citizen. As a
c i t i z e n , an individual might feel a civic responsibility
to cut down on water use especially during a
d r o u g h t .A customer, on the other hand, expects the
service paid for,no matter what.
It takes a lot of information about how water is
u s e d , for example, to run an efficient system. P u b l i c
p a rt i c i p ation offers this inform ation and so
u l t i m ately lowe rs the system’s running costs. A t
the same time, a more informed consumer may
also be a more demanding citizen. For example, i n
France people complain about high water prices.
They insist on having individual meters even when
those meters aren’t really effic i e n t .S u r e , the meters
will tell them how much water they used. But those
people still aren’t going to see that their water bills
are covering costs to clean up industrial pollution
connected to public sewe rs , for example, or to clean
up nitrates from agri c u l t u r e .With more inform at i o n ,
those same people might start demanding a more
sustainable water policy. n
