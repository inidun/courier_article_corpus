BROADCASTS FROM THE STARS
ESSENTIALLY all of ourInformation concerning the
surrounding universe comes
to us through the medium of
light waves. Astronomy thus
began as a visual science, with
observations made directly by the
eye alone or In conjunction with
the telescope. With the develop-
ment of photography, more per-
manent records became a possi-
bility. but visible and near-visible
light waves were still carrying the
message. Later, when photogra-
phic plates could be made sen-
sitive to infra-red radiations
much too long for the human eye
to detect, additional information
was gathered from the skies-
information about stars too cool
to send out appreciable amounts
of visible light, but still lavishly
pouring forth the longer waves
beyond the red.
When the physicist speaks of
"radiation"he intends the term
to include not only visible light
but all the ranges of shorter
waves (including the ultra-violet.
X-rays and the even shorter and
more penetrating rays from radio-
active materials), and longer
waves too (such as the infra-red
and radio waves). An incan-
descent body, such as a star, must
radiate some of all of these
varieties of waves, the relative

perature. There Is little hope of

ing its way through the earth's
atmosphere ; but longer waves.
including the radio range, could
find their way to earth and so
tell us things about the stars and
the spaces between them that
would never be revealed to the
eye.
BIRTH OF RADIO

but was unsuccessful In detecting
such radiations. It was in 1932
that Dr. K. G. Jansky of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories tin the
United States first tuned In cos-
mic radio signals while attempt-
ing to detect"static"from a
thunderstorm. He used a radio
antsnna which could be swung
about to pick up signals from one

or another direction in the sky.
and he noticed that even when
atmospheric disturbances were
absent, weak signals could be
detected, apparently coming from
various places in the direction of
the Milky Way. Thus was the
science of radio astronomy born.
The Milky Way is the central
plane of our galaxy, or local
group of stars, visible on a clear
night as an irregular, faintly
luminous band. stretching across
the sky. The stars that abound

some other direction.
About five years after Jansky'e
first observations. Grote Reber.
an American amateur scientist,
bu1lt a huge hollow reflector for
sweeping the sky, and a group of
English workers took up the
search as well. It was soon found
that strong radio signals were
received from several concen-
trated points In the Milky Wayregion, but that these centres did
not coincide with any of the
brighter stars. Rather, the source
seems to be the vast clouds of gas
and dust that are known to
occupy the huge spaces between
the hundreds of millions of mil-
lions of stars In our system, and
the origin of radiation is thought
to be the motion of electrons In
these regions.
SIGNAL FROM THE
"tSLND UNtVERSE"
By tuning the radio receiverattached to the radio teles-
cope, the experimenters are
able to make maps of the distri-
bution of the radiant material In
space. Thus far with observa-
tions in both the northern and
southern regions of the sky,

signals is this large hollow deflector, which can be turned to any direction
in the sky. A detecting device is placed at the point where the radio waves
are concentrated by the reflector.
about one hundred locallsed
sources of radio waves have been
discovered, but only two or three
seem to be connected with any
visible stars. Australian workers
have observed that one interest-
ing radio source coincides with
the famous Crab Nebula, a prodi-
gious mass of hot gases resulting
from a nova, or stellar flare-up,
that occurred in 1045 AD. Mean-
while. just a few months ago.
British observers were able for
the first time to detect radio
emission from an object outside
our own galaxy, the great Andro-
meda Nebula. This"ISland uni-
verse", our nearest neighbor In
space, is so distant that light-
which travels 300, 000 kilometres
per second-takes nearly three-
quarters of a million years to tra-
verse the distance. Andromeda is
not only a neighbour but a close
copy of our own galazy in many
ways. and 80 it must be concluded
that we. too, broadcast a stream
of radio waves into surrounding
space.
The sun, which supplles us so
lavishly with visible radiations.
also sends out barely detectable
amounts of radio waves. On
certain occasions, this output
flares up to a hundred or a
thousand times its normal value,
and these bursts are sometimes
connected with sunspots and
with brilliant solar eruptions
known as flares. Because these
sudden bursts of radiant energy
may affect long-distance commer-
cial radio reception on earth, they
are being studied Intensively ; but
what radio astronomers learn
through such investigation will
undoubtedly tell us much about
the fundamental physical nature
of the sun as well.
