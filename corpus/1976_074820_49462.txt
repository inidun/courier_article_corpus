PAULO E. DE BERREDO CARNEIRO of
Brazil has been associated with Unesco since
1946 when he was Brazil's representative on the
Unesco Preparatory Commission in London. He
is a member of Unesco's Executive Board and
was its Chairman during 1951-1952. Permanent
delegate of Brazil to Unesco Arom 1946 to 1965,
he led his country's delegation to many sessions
of Unesco's General Conference, of which he
was President in 1962. He has been chairman
of the Executive Committee for the Interna-
tional Campaign to Save the Monuments of
Nubia since 1962. For many years he direc-
ted the work of the International Commission
set up by Unesco to prepare the multi-volume
History of Mankind-Cultural and Scientific
Development (See page 15). A member of
many scientific and cultural institutions, including
the Brazilian Academy of the History of Science
and the Institut de France (corresponding
member, he taught chemistry at universities in
Brazil and other countries and has lectured and
written widely on philosophical, historical and
literary subjects.
consciousness of the unity of mankind
and the need to co-ordinate efforts
towards cultural and social progress
on a world-wide scale."
It is in these words that Julian
Huxley describes in his autobiography,
Memories, the aims of the first pro-
gramme for Unesco which he was
called on to prepare in 1946 as
Secretary of the Organization's Pre-
paratory Commission.
Few indeed, in 1946, were those who
could have taken charge of as bold
and pioneering an enterprise as the
United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
Called on by the educators, scien-
tists and scholars who had created
Unesco, Julian Huxley accepted the
challenge to make the new organization
a living reality. His previous studies,
his work, the whole course of his life
had, in fact, prepared him to perform
the task with brilliant success.
As a schoolboy at Eton, Julian Huxley
was equally attracted to scientific
research and literature. Latin and
Greek interested him as much as
animal life and behaviour, and he
divided most of his free time between
writing poems in these languages,
dissecting insects, and bird-watching.
At 18 he won a scholarship in
zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, By
now he was spending all his spare
time roaming through fields and woods,
notebook and binoculars in hand,
observing the different kinds of birds,
noting their songs and jotting down
descriptions of their nests, their eggs,
and the distinctive characteristics of
their behaviour.
As a young student at Baltic ! he
made the acquaintance of distinguished
Oxford figures in addition to the
teachers with whom he studied exper-
imental embryology, comparative anat-
omy and zoology. While at Oxford he
also won the university poetry prize,
the Newdigate, and bought his first
microscope with the prize money.
In 1909 Julian Huxley attended an
important international gathering held
at Cambridge to celebrate the centen-
ary of Charles Darwin's birth. During
the ceremony, as he tells us in his
autobiography, he thought of his grand-
father, the famous biologist Thomas
Henry Huxley, who had vigorously
defended Darwin's work against the
religious prejudices of those earlier
times.
He resolved there and then to
approach all his studies in a Darwinian
spirit and to devote his major work to
evolutionism, on which he threw much
new light through his own research.
In the same year he published his
first scientific paper, concerning a
protozoan parasite in a freshwater
shrimp, a survivor from the carbon-
iferous epoch 300 million years ago,
which had been found in Tasmania.
Soon afterwards, he was awarded a
scholarship at the Naples Marine Bio-
logical Station, where he was delighted
to discover almost limitless possi-
bilities for research. His first piece
of work, on the tissues of sponges,
was immediately published in the

As a broadcaster, lecturer and the author of some 40 books-scientific books based on original
research and others on travel. religion, science and politics, popular science, natural history
and poetry-Sir Julian Huxley became known to a wide public. His ability to interpret scientific
and philosophic ideas in a livery style and easily understood terms earned him the award of
the Unesco Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science, in 1953, (See also footnote
page 38). Photo shows Sir Julian at the Kalinga prize-giving ceremony at Unesco's
Paris H. Q. With him (on right) is Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former
chairman of Unesco's Executive Board who later became President of India (1962-1967).
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society. He next turned his attention
to a rare Foraminiferan [a tiny marine
creature] which lived in mud and whose
reproduction process he was the first
to describe. Each individual of this
species divides up into about 500
miniature organisms, each resembling
the parent except that their bodies
are ovoid instead of elongated.
But his most important work at the
Naples Institute concerned Clavellina,
an Ascidian [a jelly-like animal] which
lives attached to rocks in the sea.
When its thorax is cut and left in a
container, it shrinks into an opaque,
formless mass. Only its heart-beat
continues as evidence of normality. If
this formless mass is replaced in clean
water, it redifferentiates, not into a
new thorax but a norma) whote
individual. This remarkable experiment
was the starting point for many others
of a similar kind.
Julian Huxley's stay at the Naples
Institute was an extremely fruitful
period for his biological work. It also
brought him into contact with two
distinguished scientists, Otto Warburg
(later a Nobel Prizewinner) with whom

stages in his long career.

As Secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942)
Julian Huxley transformed the London Zoo. One of his projects was
to set up a special children's zoo. In photo above, taken in 1938,
a sea lion seems to listen attentively as Julian Huxley chats to
a London zoo-keeper.
After serving as Secretary
of the Preparatory
Commission for Unesco
in 1946, Julian Huxley
was elected Director-
General of the Organization
at its first General
Conference held in Paris
in 1946. Photo right
shows Julian Huxley and
his wife Juliette at a
Unesco function in Paris
in the same year.
 Huxley later worked in his laboratory
at Heidelberg, and E. G. Conklin, an
embryologist at Princeton University.
Huxley now returned to Oxford to
take up a lectureship at Ba) ! io) and a
demonstratorship in the university
Department of Zoology. He gave free
rein to his interests as a naturalist and
spent most of his time in scientific
bird watching.
His first descriptions of the court-
ship ceremonies of certain birds such
as the great crested grebe were
published in 1914 and had a major
impact. Having been struck by the
formalized nature of some of the male
bird's actions, he concluded that they
served to establish an emotional link
between the couple. Julian Huxley's
work on these courtship rituals make
him a pioneer of ethology and a pre-
cursor of Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas
Tinbergen.
In the autumn of 1912 he sailed for
the United States to attend the opening
of the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas
where he had been appointed to the
chair of biology. This appointment
which he took up the following year
gave him the opportunity to get to
know the United States, its universities
and its scientists.
In New York his first visit was to
the famous"fly-room"at Columbia
University, where T. H. Morgan and his
team had just completed their first
great piece of research on Drosophila,
the fruit-fly. One member of the team
was H. J Muller, a future Nobel Prize-
winner, who was to become Huxley's
assistant at the Rice Institute. During
this period he met many noted
American biologists, including E. B. Wil-
son, S. Flexner, Peyton Rous and
Rosa Harrington.
A year after his arrival in Houston,
the First World War broke out. In the
early summer of 1916, Julian Huxley
returned to England to join the army.
His service with the armed forces,
first in England then in Italy, lasted
until the end of the war, when he
retarnu ed to Oxford to take up a fet) ow-
ship in Zoology at New Collage.
Here he continued his research
and teaching, numbering among his
students many who were destined for
a brilliant future in science.
In the time he could spare from his
scientific activities, Julian Huxley read
philosophical and religious works. His
study of Abelard, St. Thomas Aquinas,
St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi and
other saints, mystics and theologians
laid the foundations for the work he
wrote later on the role of religion in
present-day society, Religion without
Revelation.
Immediately after his return to
Oxford at the beginning of 1919, Julian
Huxley proposed to Juliette Baillot, a
charming Swiss girl he had met two
years before. She accepted."This
provoked a whirlwind of happiness in
my heart", he wrote in Memories,"and
I spent much of my time writing to all
my friends and relatives telling them

One of Julian Huxley's
most remarkable
biological discoveries
was made when he
studied the bristle-worm
SBbellB (right) at Lough
Ine (Ireland) in 1934.
His research showed that
headless fragments of
the worm's thorax would
regenerate a complete
thorax and abdomen,
whereas it had previously
been supposed that the
brain and its nerves were
needed for this process.
of my good fortune."This happiness
was to last a lifetime.
About this time, Oxford University
prepared to send a scientific ex-
pedition to Spitzbergen in the Arctic
Ocean. Julian Huxley was one of the
organizers and in addition to him, the
expedition included botanists, a geogra-
pher, a geologist and an ecologist.
Julian Huxley's task was to study
Arctic birds and describe their habits.
To his delight he saw species such
as the grey phalarope and the purple
sandpiper for the first time and ana-
lysed their sexual behaviour. Each of
these two species is distinguished by
the reversal of roles between the
sexes : the hen (brightly coloured in
the case of the grey phalarope) takes
the initiative in courtship while the
protectively coloured male broods the
eggs and looks after the young chicks.
The Spitzbergen expedition led to the
foundation of the Oxford Exploration
Society, the first of the British uni-
versity exploration clubs.
In 1925 Julian Huxley left Oxford
to become professor of Zoology at
King's College in London. This move
coincided with a turning point in his
research and his career as a writer.
His mind now turned increasingly to
social problems, to which he applied
the scientific methods which had
proved their worth in his biological
research.
The biologist became a sociologist,
a humanist, an educator anxious to
serve a world in disarray. His
approach was that of a man of science
who recognizes the need for free-
ranging imaginative solutions in dealing
with complex social problems.
The population explosion of modern
times became one of his favourite
themes as a writer and thinker. He
returned to this problem again and
again, demonstrating its gravity and
its implications for mankind. He
expounded his views on family planning
in newspaper articles, lectures and
radio broadcasts which won a wide 
audience.

) n 1930 he played an active part in
the World Conference of Anglican
bishops at Lambeth Palace in London,
where family planning was a major
topic of discussion. In its final report,
the conference recognized the danger
of over-population and left the practice
of birth control to the conscience of
the individuals concerned.
From a very early age, Huxley had
no belief of any kind in the super-
natural. He thought it possible to
establish a moral system which was
purely scientific in inspiration and
which would be capable of uniting
mankind. In his view, love of God
should be replaced by love of nature
and love of Humanity. His concept
was of a religion without revealed
dogmas, without deities, without heaven
or earth.
To expound his main thoughts on
this subject, he wrote in 1927 a book
of major philosophical importance,
entitled Religion without Revelation.
Apart from his biological works this
is undoubtedly his most important
book. In a collection of lectures entit-
led What Dare I Think ? published in
1931, he returned to many of the
fundamental points he had raised in
the earlier book :"Religion, in the
light of psychological and anthropo-
logical science is seen not as a divine
revelation, but as a function of human
nature... God in the current sense in
which they use the word, is the
creation of man... Almost without
exception, the elements and practices
of the existing world-religions could
be utilized by a religion which, aban-
doning the interpretation in terms of
God, has adopted the scientific out-
look as basis for its theology.
"[This new religion]... can help to kill
fear and to achieve freedom from
the sense of sin. It can reveal to
its adherents unexpected richnesses,
possibilities of their own nature of
which they were ignorant... But it
will never be a real force in human
affairs, unless, in addition to providing
spiritual refuge and solace and the
opportunity of doing miscellaneous
good works, it makes some bold appeal
to the moral sense and the imagination
of humanity...
"Thus, whether looked at from the
human or from the scientific point of
view, a new religion cannot be a
religion of negation, of death, of
asceticism, of resignation. It must be
religion of life... From the point of
view of the individual's inner life, its
message will be that life can be sa-
cramental.
"The apprehension of truth or
beauty ; suffering or sacrifice ; simple
joy and simple health ; love, spiritual
and physical alike ; ecstasy and disci-
pline ; self-surrender and self-control
- the most widely differing aspects of
life can become tinged with transcen-
dent emotion, whereby we feel that
we are greater than we know and
come to experience a new value in
existence... [This religion] can also
help to give life a purpose beyond
itself... Who can doubt that the mo-
tive of work for the continuation of the
race and the increase of its capacities
for achievement and enjoyment could
be charged with religious emotion ?"
This scientific humanism is based
on the evolutionism of Darwin, but in
my view, it has a much closer affinity
with the philosophy of Auguste Comte
and his religion of humanity.
In 1927 H. G. Wells invited Julian
Huxley to join him and his son G. P.
Wells in compiling an encyclopedic of
biology, to be called The Science of
Life. Huxley was to be responsible

Observation of nature and the animal world preoccupied Julian Huxley from his
schooldays to the end of his life. Devoted to the question of conservation of
wildlife and natural habitats, he studied these problems in Africa where he
carried out several missions for Unesco between 1960 and 1971 (see"Unesco
Courier", September 1961). Below, perching happily on one leg, a crane cleans up

Julian Huxley's concern
for scientific
investigation as a
biologist and zoologist
was matched by his
talents as an educator
and an interpreter of
science. His account of

JULIAN HUXLEY
SCIENTIST, HUMANIST AND LOVER OF NATURE (Continued from page 12)
for most of the scientific work. He
therefore resigned his chair at King's
College, London and devoted himself
full time to preparing and editing the
far-ranging encyclopedia.
The formidable work took three
years to complete ; but it gave Huxley
an opportunity to deepen his know-
ledge of a vast range of subjects-
and also to display his descriptive
powers. From then onwards he was
asked increasingly often to use his
undoubted gift as an interpreter of
scientific subjects, for which many
years later, he was to receive the
Kalinga Prize awarded by Unesco (1).
AFTER such a long period ofconcentrated writi he felt the
need of a break. So he packed his
notebooks and instruments and set off
for Africa. He had been asked to
inquire into the state of nature conser-
vation there and also to report on the
role of biology teaching in African
schools. Africa View, the book he
wrote after this journey, records his
impressions and observations of wild
life and human problems in this vast
region.
Near Nairobi he met the young
paleontologist Louis Leakey, who al-
ready believed that primitive man had
first appeared in Africa, a hypothesis
he was to prove thirty years later when
he found the famous fossil skull of
Zinjanthropus. Huxley went on safari
with his wife Juliette in the Belgian
Congo (today Zaire), and studied there
the great fauna of equatorial Africa
in their natural habitats.
When he returned to the United
Kingdom in January 1930 he presented
a report that included a scheme for
setting up nature reserves for the
wild animals of the entire region, but
it was some years before his propo-
sal was accepted.
After the African trip, Huxley paid
a brief visit to the U. S. S. R. This gave
him material for another travel book,
A Scientist among the Soviets. On his
return to London he resumed work on
a major study dealing with the differ-
rences in growth of different parts of
the body. This was published in 1932
under the title Problems of Relative
Growth.
As soon as he finished it he began
another ambitious project with his
former pupil, Gavin de Beer ; the
preparation of Principles of Experimen-
tal Embryology. This book took two
years to complete. When it appeared
(1) Prize of f1, 000 for the popularization of
science, created by Unesco in 1951 through
the donation of an Indian industrialist, Bijoya-
nandPatnaik. The prize is awarded by an
international jury chosen by Unesco. There
have been 24 Kalinga prize-winners to date.
in 1934 it had an immediate success,
and for many years was widely used
by teachers and researchers.
The 1930s saw a vast wave of pro-
paganda concerning racial myths that
falsely claimed to be scientific. It
provoked a vigorous reaction from
Julian Huxley. He wrote a stinging
counter-attack to the Nazi slogans,
dismantling the theories of racial su-
periority point by point and showing
they had no more weight than a house
of cards. His book, We Europeans,
was published in 1935. It demon-
strated that there was no such thing
as"pure race"anywheçe in the world
and that the qualities and achievements
of each so-called race or ethnic group
were determined mainly by environ-
ment and cultural history.
But these many activities never de-
flected Huxley from his vocation as
a dedicated naturalist. During the
same period he began a new venture,
with film director Alexander Korda. To-
gether they made a marvellous docu-
mentary on seabirds, shot on a small
offshore island, and called it The
Private Life of the Gannet.
When the film was finished Huxley
went off to southwest Ireland, near
Lough Ins. Here he studied a lake-
worm, the Sabella, whose body show-
ed a remarkable and completely un-
expected ability to achieve new growth
after amputation. He discovered that
headless fragments of thorax would
regenerate a complete thorax and
abdomen, though it had previously
been supposed that the brain and its
nerves were necessary for the process.
M N 1935 Julian Huxley agreed tot become Secretary of the London
Zoological Society, a post he was to
hold until 1942. In his autobiography
he writes at some length about this
phase of his long career, a period
marked by the convulsions of Wohd
War II and the bombardment of London.
In the midst of much work and worry
Julian Huxley nevertheless found time
to produce one of his most important
books : Evolution, the Modern Syn-
theses. It appeared during the war,
in 1942, soon after he had resigned
from his post at the London Zoo."It
is perhaps the work I am most proud
to have achieved", he notes in his
autobiography.
Soon after war broke out the British
Broadcasting Corporation invited Ju-
lian Huxley to join the Brains'Trust-
a weekly programme in which a small
group of distinguished figures discuss-
ed various questions submitted by the
public. He also wrote a number of
articles and a booklet, Reconstruction
and Peace, in which he stressed the
need to look ahead to the post-war
world and to prepare fair peace terms
and material aid, not only for the
occupied countries but for Germany
herself, so that she too could rise from
ruin and defeat.
On the suggestion of the Confer-
ence of Allied Ministers of Education,
Britain, France and the United States
invited the countries which had fought
alongside them to meet for discussions
on the setting up of an international
organization concerned with education,
science and vulture. The conference,
held in London in November 1945, set
up a Preparatory Commission and
Julian Huxley agreed to become its
Executive Secretary.
The proposals he made concerning
this ambitious project reveal the bold
and broad sweep of his vision. Re-
reading them thirty years later, as he
presented them at the first General
Conference of the new organization in
a paper entitled Unesco, its Purpose
and its Philosophy, one is struck by
his inspired foresight.
Regrettably, at that time the
delegations did not share his insights
and felt unable to adopt the proposal.
The plan was shelved, but by degrees
a good many of its features have come
to figure in Unesco's programme. The
extracts of this remarkable document
published elsewhere in this issue
(page 14) will enable readers of the
"Unesco Courier"to judge the true
significance of his proposal,
With equal ease Julian Huxley dis-
cussed and analysed questions con-
cerning education or information, the
natural sciences and the human
sciences. The opinions he expressed
at meetings of Unesco's Executive
Board or at its General Conferences
always sparkled with intelligence, and
often with humour. A natural frank-
ness gave his ideas a sincerity that
imposed respect, even from his most
determined opponents.
Placed at the service of Unesco,
his universalist spirit opened unlimited
horizons which reveal Julian Huxley's
tremendous contribution to inter-
national co-operation, to cultural de-
velopment and to the cause of peace.
Unesco is soon to publish a com-
plete bibliography of his writings.
The scientist, philosopher and apostle
will gradually take his rightful place
among the illustrious figures of our
century. Posterity will remember him
as much with admiration as with
gratitude, and will fully endorse his
own judgment of himself."If I am
to be remembered", he wrote,"I hope
it will not be primarily for my special-
ized scientific work, but as a genera-
list ; one to whom, enlarging Terence's
words, nothing human and nothing in
external nature was lien."
