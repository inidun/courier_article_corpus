DUCATION fulfils the twin functions of social
reproduction and innovation. It helps to
ensure the transmission of the sum of know¬
ledge, experience and values of each society while
at the same time it inculcates the individual and col¬
lective aptitudes necessary to social progress. Thus
its purpose is to encourage social renewal while
respecting the unique features of each society.
Nowadays education must also face up to two
fundamental challenges posed by the realities of our
time: to match itself to the world-wide scope of the
increasingly complex problems of today, and to
achieve the democratization necessary to enable it
better to respond to the needs and aspirations of
people of all ages.
The future of each community is henceforth be¬
ing shaped in a planetary context. Reciprocal in¬
fluences are becoming ever more numerous, accen¬
tuating the interdependence of our destinies, the
mutual interpénétration of our cultures and the
of our problems. At themultidimensional nature

variety of activities. Education must become more
and more in tune with these decisive aspects of
contemporary reality.
Furthermore, education has to respond to one of
the major developments of our time: the universal
recognition of the equal worth of all individuals,
whatever their social situation or their views, and

of knowledge and skill, particularly in the case of
the elderly, the handicapped and the most disad¬
vantaged workers.
In addition, real equality must be afforded to girls
and women; there must be an extension of educa¬
tional facilities for the inhabitants of rural areas,
who are far less well provided for than city-
dwellers. In fact, the majority of the world's 824
million illiterate adults and the 121 million children
of school age who do not attend school live in the
rural areas.

Unesco takes particular pride in the fact that, in
conformity with its Constitution which enjoins the
Organization "to advance the ideal of equality of
educational opportunity", it has opened up many of
the paths along which education has begun to travel
in the service of all mankind. The democratization of
education, which is the common denominator of
Unesco's activities in the educational field, now has
a consistent programme devoted to it within the
framework of the Organization's Second Medium-
Term Plan for the period 1984-1989.
It is to be hoped that this issue of the Unesco
Courier will give readers throughout the world a
broad overview of the efforts Unesco is making in
this field and contribute to the strengthening of the
ideal of justice, peace and individual and collective
progress, which is the aim and finality of all
