A progressive new water management policy designed to provide
all South Africans with guaranteed access to water
South Africa: water for everyone
n
Among the many stories of depri vation told by
o r d i n a ry South A f ricans during three months of
n ation-wide pove rty hearings last ye a r , one eve n t
still stands out. In a village in nort h e rn Kwa z u l u -
N at a l , crocodiles had reportedly killed a handful of
women who went to a ri ver to collect water for their
basic needs.
As that event graphically testifie s ,water pove rty is
literally a life and death matter in South A f ri c a ,w h e r e
about a third of the country ’s 36 million people lacks
access to adequate supplies of potable wat e r , a n d
almost two-thirds lack basic sanitat i o n .The domino
effects are seve r e .The pove rty heari n g s , organized by
n o n - g ove rnmental organizations and churches, we r e
filled with accounts of children missing school because
of wat e r - r e l ated illness, and women kept out of the
p r o d u c t i ve labour force to take care of them.There is
also the ecological damage caused by lack of sanitat i o n
fa c i l i t i e s , which leaves ri ve rs flowing with disease.
But change is underway as South Africa enacts
w h at many consider one of the wo r l d ’s most
progressive water management policies.
Learning to share
The first part of this new policy invo l ves installat i o n
of collective pumps to ensure that by 2004 eve ry
South A f rican has ready access to at least 25 litres of
clean water a day within 200 metres of home. I n
a d d i t i o n ,e f f o rts are being made to install more pri vat e
taps and to improve sanitation—an undert a k i n g
which is proving difficult as many communities have
trouble paying for these new serv i c e s.
The second part is more ambitious: to dismantle
an apartheid-era system that reserves the precious
resource for a rich minori t y.Black townships are a sorry
sight of people lugging buckets or pushing ri c k e t y
w h e e l b a rr ows filled with water containers.Yet the
n e i g h b o u ring suburbs are a lush haven where an
average home has at least two bathrooms and a kitchen,
while garden-hoses are left on for hours to keep the
grass green in a city like Sowe t o.
In the country s i d e , women in Kwa z u l u - N atal are
killed by crocodiles while fa rm e rs in the same area
i rri g ate their crops almost for free. Not only do the
l atter have ri p a rian rights to water on,under or adjacent
to their propert y,but also they tap into sources locat e d
f u rther away thanks to infrastructure subsidized by the
s t at e .I n d u s t ries like forestry and mining also benefit
from these subsidies. These sectors “ h ave the lion’s
share of water allocation at the moment,” s ays Mike
M u l l e r , Director General of the Water A f fa i rs
d e p a rt m e n t .“There will have to be some shari n g .”
The right to collect water 
for subsistence
This is where the new National Water Act comes
i n .A p p r oved by parliament in 1998,it is now becoming
l aw.The old ri p a rian rights will be replaced by licenses
granted for water uses that bring social benefit s ,s u c h
as job creation and economic empowe rm e n t .L i c e n s i n g
preference will go to new actors ,p a rticularly emergi n g
black fa rm e rs , while a review board will hear appeals
from those who lose out as a result of the act.
The act entrenches the individual’s right to collect
water at the source for subsistence.“In many senses
this is about liberating water from the tyranny of the
l a n d ow n e r ,” s ays the Water A f fa i rs Minister, K a d e r
A s m a l .
Under the current system,rich and poor families in
S owe t o,for example,both pay about 60 cents per cubic
metre regardless of whether they use that water to fill a
swimming pool or cook a meal.Under the new system,
different rates will apply for different uses.The poorest
people relying on collective pumps will pay about 80
cents per month—a fraction of the true costs—per
cubic metre.When it comes to pri vate taps,e ve ryone will
r e c e i ve a basic supply of water at a minimum,s u b s i d i z e d
p ri c e .For supplies above basic needs,about $1.60 pe r
cubic metre will be charged,with an even higher rate for
l u x u ry uses like filling pools.Steep rates will also be fixe d
for large landow n e rs and industri a l i s t s.
The mere idea of wat e r - p ricing has set off a
political explosion. Pa rties representing the poor
and black constituency, the A f rican Nat i o n a l
C o n gress and the Inkatha Freedom Pa rt y, s u p p o rt the
a c t .Yet opposition is virulent from the ri g h t - w i n g
Freedom Front representing white fa rm e rs , t h e
D e m o c r atic Pa rty favo u ring business interests and the
more broadly-based white Nationalist Pa rt y. n
