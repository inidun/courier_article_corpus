INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES
THROUGH ART EDUCATION
Y Ol' : \'G children are endowedwith the gift of seeing the
\vor) d about them intuitively,
with an innocent freshness as yet
unaffected bv the rational dictates
of experience. One of the chief
concerns of any mode of education
must therefore be to retain as much
as possible this natural awareness
in the child and yet provide a
method of training that will truly
educate.
The purpose of education is not
only, in the famous words of Franz
Cizek :"to let the children grow,
develop and mature."It has also
to be a mode of initiation so that
each person may be as well
equipped as possible for living his
own life and for contributing to
the good life of others and of the
community.
It is in this respect that education
by means of the arts is so valuable
because it fosters the whole
development of the personality,
uniting intellectual activity with
physical skills, but fusing them in
a creative process that is in itself
among the most precious attributes
of man.
From its inception Unesco has
recognized the value of education
through art as a means of enriching
the individual development of
young people and for promoting
international understanding.
When in 1949 art education
specialists came together to discuss
Unesco's programme for art educ-
ation, they laid the greatest emphasis
on the need to foster international
exchanges of all kinds-exchanges
of information, techniques, ideas
and beliefs, exchanges of art
teachers and of the art work done
by children in different countries.
That principle of exchange and
inter-communication has since
characterized much of the work
of Unesco in this field.
For example, letters requesting
help in arranging exchange activ-
ities reach Unesco from all parts
of the world. Typical of many
requests is the following :"I am a
teacher in an elementary school
and although I am not a specialist
in art and have to teach all subjects
in my class, we are doing what I
think is very interesting work in
arts and crafts. I would like very
much to be able to exchange some
of the work done by my children
with that done in a school in
another country."
A brown paper package
A few weeks ago, a large brownpaper'pack e arrived at
Unesco from a group of
children and their teacher in
Africa."Children's Paintings-
Free Gift"read the description
on the Customs declaration form.
Inside the package was a collec-
tion of delightful paintings and
pictures and a letter which began :
"Dear Friend, We do not know
you but we are sending you these
drawings so that you can know
us as your friends. You can see
what we look like and the place
where we live and what we do..."
Just a week before, a similar
parcel had come from children in
Guatemala and Austria, and a few
months ago others had arrived
from schools in Germany, Den-
mark, Egypt and Mexico. In a
school in the United States the
teacher and children made a set of
miniature slides in colour to
illustrate the kinds of art work they
were doing and sent them to
Unesco in Paris.
From countries all rover the world
small collections of children's art
are now being sent to Unesco.
Small selections from these
drawing and paintings have been
sent on loan for exhibitions in
different countries. More frequent-
ly, however, Unesco links one
request for exchange with another
so that works of children's art can
be inter-changed directly between
schools and countries.
Recently, the president of the
Japanese Association for Promot-
ing Educational Arts sought the
aid of L'nesco in arranging ex-
changes of chHdren's paintings with
some 20 Member States of Unesco.
About 400 drawings were exchang-
ed as a result between Japan and
each of the 20 countries. Thus a
total of some 8, 000 pictures created
by 8, 000 children travelled across
the world to carry images not only
of aesthetic and educational value
but of goodwill and understanding.
The same Japanese association
Recently an international competi-
tion was organized by the Danish
Section of the International Union
for Child welfare in which
children were asked to illustrate
stories written by Hans Christian
Andersen.
For some time past the Indian
illlustrated journal, Shankar's
Meekly, has arranged an annual
international competition, publish-
ing an illustrated issue of the
journal entirely devoted to the
literary and artistic work of
children. Similarly, the Sunday
Pictorial in the United Kingdom
arranges an annual competition
and exhibition for which the prizes
are in the form of scholarships to
study at one of the art schools.
All these exhibitions and ex-

has now produced a portfolio of
colour reproductions of pastel
drawings by Japanese children
which Unesco is sending to each
of its Member States as a gift from
the Japanese National Commission
for Unesco and the Japanese Asso-
ciation for Promoting Educational
Arts. (FOUl'of these pastels a1'e

what has been done in Japan is
but one of many examples of the
actin and practical monments
which are a striking feature of art
educational developments on an
international basis in recent years.
International exhibitions of child
art have been arranged under
Unesco auspices or by its National
Commissions in Australia, India,
Ceylon, Guatemala and Italy.
Many others have been organized
priyately or nationally in other
countries.
For manv vears one of the best
organized schemes for exchanges
of children's art and music work
has been sponsored jointly by the
National Art Education Association
of the United States and the
International Junior Red Cross.
changes, like the comparable
schemes for the international ex-
change of correspondence and
yisits between children, contribute
to the building of a world-wide
network of understanding and
communication between peoples.
The most significant fact is that
here is international exchange and
cultural diffusion'which exists on a
large scale, which has extended at
an astonishing pace in the past few
years, and which seems to have
originated spontaneously in many
different places, symptomatic of a
widespread and genuine need and
desire.
It may not be apparent to one
or two teachers in a particular
country or to a few in another
country, but when the evidence
from many places is taken together
and viewed as a whole, there are
clear signs of an almost revolution-
ary change of attitude to art
education in the past decade.
One of the most significant
ennts of the past two years was
the Seminar on the Teaching of the
visual Arts held in Bristol,
England, which brought together,
through Unesco, teachers and spe-
cialists from many countries who
were directly concerned \vith
practical problems of art educa-
tion. They experienced the value
of international exchange for
themselves, they recognized the
necessity for it and decided to set
up the necessary organization for
its promotion.
They have founded the Inter-
national Societv for Education
through Art (INSEA) which is
open for membership to national
groups and individuals. One of
its tasks will be the organization of
exhibitions of original works by
children and kodakrome slides for
circulation internationally.
A world survey
THE founders set forth their basicbeliefs in the Preamble to the
Constitution of the Society in the
following terms :
"Art is one of man's highest
forms of expression and communi-
cation ; Creative activity in art is
a basic need common to all people ;
Education through art is a natural
means of learning at all periods
of development of the individual,
fostering values and disciplines
essential for full intellectual emo-
tional and social development of
human beings in a community.
"The association on a world-wide
basis of those concerned'with
education through art is necessary
in order that they may share exper-
iences, improve practices and
strengthen the position of art in
relation to all education."
Next year a regional seminar on
the teaching of the arts and crafts
will be organized by Unesco in
Tokyo, in co-operation with the
Japanese National Commission
and other authorities.
Meanwhile, Unesco has just
published a volume which may
well be unique in this domain
of education. Entitled I"Art and
Education : A Symposium" (1),
this 250-page book-one of
Unesco's most attractively-present-
ed volumes-contains 45 essays
surveying the field of visual art
education, the basic theories, the
variety of techniques and materials
which are in use, the problems of
training and administration, the
role of the amateur and the special
needs of art education for youth
groups and for adults.
A notable feature of the volume
will be the illustrations which
have been selected so as to
present in vivid pictorial form the
main theme of the nature of art
education. Over 100 black and
white and 28 colour plates show
children at work and examples of
their drawings, paintings and
modelling. There is also an illus-
trated plan for an art room.
Art teachers, parents, leaders of
youth groups, organizers of art
clubs, and those concerned with
general education, child guidance
and child psychology will find the
scope of the publication extremely
valuable. The book will also
appeal to the general reader
interested in culture and in chil-
dren not only because of its subject
matter but also for the quality and
character of the illustrations.
The articles published in this
special issue of the"Courier"will
appear in unabridged form in the
new Unesco volume. The photos
in this number are taken either
from this publication or from col-
lections sent to Unesco's centre of
information for art education.
