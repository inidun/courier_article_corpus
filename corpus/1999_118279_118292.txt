Russia: an unfinished j o b
◗ Alexis Bere l ow i t c h
Russians looked back in anger when p e re s t ro i k a re vealed the full scale of Stalinist massacre s
and re p ression. But current difficulties have largely halted this re a p p raisal of the past
The body of a dictator is buried and dug up
s e veral times in Georgian filmmaker Te n gi z
Abuladze’s 1986 movie Repentance. Stalin
had a similar fate: he was symbolically exhumed
d u ring the political “ t h aw ” of Nikita Khru s h c h e v ’s
r e i g n , hidden away during the Brezhnev ye a rs ,
d i s i n t e rred again during p e r e s t r o i k a and is today
more or less out of sight.
These ups and downs show how hard it is for
Russians to perform acts of remembering and
m o u rning as a prelude to accepting and coping
with what happened in the dark days of Stalinist
terror.
D u ring the thaw ye a rs ,b e t ween 1956 and 1964,
Soviet society was confronted with its past for the
first time when Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s
c ri m e s. But the denunciation only went part of the
way, and a thoroughgoing reappraisal of Stalinism
was not possible. From the mid-1960s on, all refe-
rences to Stalin were censored. D u ring the Brezhnev
years, the dictator was quietly rehabilitated as the
architect of the victory over Nazi Germany.
But while the Soviet establishment offic i a l l y
t ried to play down or make people forget about
S t a l i n i s m , the most radical wing of the liberal
i n t e l l i g e n t s i a , the dissidents, continued their scru-
t i ny of the Stalinist era. The high point of this
s t ruggle to remember came in 1974 with the
p u b l i c ation in the West of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s
The Gulag A r c h i p e l a go.
In the grip of
a reading frenzy
When p e r e s t r o i k a a l l owed people to speak freely,
from 1985 on, the first thing the intelligentsia did
was to turn to the past and try to make sense of it.
In 1986 and 1987, h i s t o rical novels which had
been written decades earlier and had either been
unpublished in the Soviet Union or published only
in the West turned the spotlight back onto Stalinism.
Nearly 10 million copies were printed of the most
popular of these nove l s ,A n atoly Rybakov ’s C h i l d r e n
of the A r b at. All the key moments and events of the
Stalinist era were now dealt with—the 1930s,col-
l e c t i v i z at i o n , the Second World War and stat e - s p o n-
sored anti-semitism.
In 1988, Vassili Grossman’s gr e at novel L i fe
and Destiny, which had been published in the West
in 1980, appeared in Russia, followed in 1990 by
The Gulag A r c h i p e l a go.The circulation of the maga-
zine Novy Mir in which these works appeared rea-
ched two million.The whole country was gripped
with a reading frenzy.
When the Soviet people discovered the scale
of the disaster it came as a terrible shock. A sense of
shared responsibility spread throughout the country.
People wondered whether the whole society should
repent,and there was a call for a Nuremberg-type
trial of Stalinism. It was no longer just a matter of
contrasting an evil Stalin with good communists and
comrades of Lenin, as had been done during the
1987 rehabilitation of the victims of the Stalinist
show trials, but of asking what it was in Russian
society that had made Stalinism possible. E s s ays and
a rticles by historians took over from literat u r e .
Most authors belonging to the liberal intelligentsia
looked for the causes in Russian history — i n
serfdom, the absence of a civil society and demo-
c r atic practices, and the huge size of the state sector.
E s s ays and articles by historians took over where lite-
rature left off.
Waning interest
in the past
The duty of remembrance was performed by
groups which painstakingly sought out the names of
the victims, as the young historian Dimitri Yu r a s ov
did,or looked for mass graves.
This movement led to the founding in 1987-
1988 of a Moscow-based human rights associa-
tion called Memori a l , with member groups all ove r
the Soviet Union. It drew a map of the labour
camps,set up a museum and compiled lists of vic-
tims. In 1989, the Leningrad newspaper Vecherny
published day after day the names of people who had
been shot.
At first Memorial was a mass organizat i o n
which planned to put up a monument to the vic-
t i m s. But which victims? The victims of Stalinism
or eve ryone who had been persecuted by the Sov i e t
r e gime? From 1988 on, c riticism was levelled not
only at the Stalinist period but at the entire socia-
list regi m e , and this encouraged the adoption of the
second defin i t i o n .
But just as the monument project was being
discussed,public opinion began to lose interest in
the past. In 1996, the inauguration of a memorial
called The Mask of Sorrow in the Kolyma region,
where the most terrible labour camps had been,
passed largely unnoticed.
There seem to have been several reasons for
this public loss of interest. F i rst the economic
disaster and its social consequences are leading
Russians to gi ve pri o rity to the present.They are also
making people question the ve ry validity of the
d e m o c r atic project. M a ny Russians feel nostalgic for

the Soviet era and about a quarter of them hanker
after what they call the most “glorious” era, when
the USSR was feared and respected, d u ring Stalin’s
rule.
The sense of national humiliation Russians have
felt in the 1990s has weakened their desire to delve
into the darkest ye a rs. Opinion polls show more and
more people think there is too much talk about
Stalinist crimes. For some Russians,as the French
historian Maria Ferretti has shown, the desire to
forget this period of the past has sprung from a
rejection of the whole Soviet period as an unfortu-
n ate interlude in Russian history and from the glo-
ri fic ation of pre-1917 Russia. To d ay ’s Russia is
coming to be seen as the direct heir of T s a ri s t
R u s s i a , passing over the black hole of socialist ru l e .
So the Stalinist experience has now been erased.
The dictator remains the least popular figure in
Russian history—though those with favourable opi-
nions of him rose from eight per cent in 1990 to 15
per cent in 1997, while his disapproval rating fell
from 48 per cent to 36 per cent in the same peri o d .
The proportion of the population which listed the
mass repression of the 1930s among the main eve n t s
of the 20th century fell from 38 per cent in 1989 to
no more than 18 per cent in 1994.
This new situation has not stopped inve s t i g at i o n s
into Stalinism and its cri m e s , but it has gr e at l y
changed their nature.During perestroika, research
was a joint effort and a central part of daily life, bu t
n ow it is confined to professional scholars. M e m o-
rial has became mainly a research centre. H i s t o ri a n s

working on the Soviet period are devoting most of
their efforts to publishing official archive s ,p r ov i d i n g
people with a less romantic and increasingly accu-
rate view of what went on.But the task of remem-
bering for society as a whole has again been inter-
rupted before Russians have been able, at last, to
reconcile themselves with their own history. ■
Files on thousands of prisoners of the Gulag are kept in the archives of Memorial, a Moscow-based association.
