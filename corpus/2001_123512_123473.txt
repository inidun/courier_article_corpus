Te m p t a t i o n - f re e
television for childre n ?
Advertisers spend millions to reach children via television, but how gullible is this young audience?
The debate over whether TV advertising aimed at children should be banned or regulated is in full
swing
n 1932, the American psychologist
Edward Chace Tolman said,“Give me a
child from any background and I’ll turn
him into anything you want—a scientist,
politician or even a criminal.”A l t h o u g h
the theorist of manipulative education
never achieved convincing results, t o d a y
his methods are discretely emulated by
big-name brands and advertising
agencies that use television to try and
turn children into consumers.
Children are an ideal target,simply
because they are avid television viewers.
A survey of seven to 12-year-olds in
France and Switzerland by the
newspaper Journal de Genève s h o w s
that they spend an average of two and a
half hours in front of their sets every
d a y. Little Germans watch less, w h i l e
American children consume between
four and five hours of television every
day! Fo o d , t o y, clothing and record
companies already invest millions of
euros to win them over. In the United
S t a t e s, the Consumers’ Union says each
child sees 30,000 commercials a year.
Their behaviour shows it: t h e y
choose what they consume, insist on
their favourite brands and influ e n c e
their family’s choices.“More than ever,
children are making decisions and
voicing their desires at an increasingly
early age,” says Claude-Yves Robin,
general manager of the Fr e n c h
c h i l d r e n ’s cable television network
Canal J. In an interview with the Fr e n c h
daily Le Monde, Moeata Melard, a
c h i l d r e n ’s market specialist with the
MSM Marketing Research agency,
Talking straight to children,who increasingly choose what they consume.

claimed that “over half” of innovations
such as electronic games, CD-Roms and
multimedia products “reach households
through children.” In more than 50
percent of families, parents are said to
agree to their offspring’s requests
simply to avoid an argument.
C h i l d r e n ’s exposure to television
advertising is hardly a new debate.
“Many studies have shown that
children under eight cannot tell the
difference between a programme and
a commercial,” reports the American
Academy of Pediatrics, which has
taken a clear stance:“ We consider that
advertising aimed at children is
d e c e p t i v e.” In the U. S. , m a n y
psychologists criticize advertisers’
m e t h o d s, arguing that they sometimes
border on mind control.
Just one-third of the European
U n i o n ’s member states have passed laws
in the framework of the Te l e v i s i o n
without Frontiers directive (see box),
but most of them are quite loose.
Sweden is the only one that has adopted
strict regulations.
A hard sell for
the Swedish model
Erling Bjürstrom, a communications
professor whose research was used to
draft the law,says that children under 10
are incapable of telling the difference
between a commercial and a
p r o g r a m m e, and cannot understand the
purpose of a commercial until the age of
1 2 . In light of those fin d i n g s, S w e d e n
banned all advertising during children’s
prime time in 1991, when private
networks started broadcasting.
F u r t h e r m o r e, commercials featuring
characters children are familiar with are
prohibited until 9 p.m.during the week
and 10 p.m.on weekends.
Standing by its policy, Sweden would
like other European countries to follow
s u i t . In May 2001, when her country
held the rotating European Union
p r e s i d e n cy, Culture Minister Marita
Ulvskog held a conference on the issue
with her European counterparts. Th e
debate is timely because the Television
without Frontiers directive is up for
revision in 2002. Several states—Greece
and Portugal in the south, Great Britain,
Denmark and the Netherlands in the
north—have already come out in favour
of strengthening European regulations,
while the others are satisfied with the
status quo, which lets each country
decide on its own measures.
Since the item is on the European
Union agenda, c o m m u n i c a t i o n
professionals have been girding
themselves for battle. Their first
argument is globalization.“Nothing will
keep thematic networks from
broadcasting advertising aimed at
c h i l d r e n ,” says Robert Gerson, t h e
former head in France of Mattel, w h i c h
m a k e s, among other things, Barbie dolls.
The exponential growth of satellite
multi-channel packages in Europe, a
powerful springboard for A m e r i c a n
networks such as MTV, Disney Channel
and Nickelodeon, would make it
impossible to enforce such a Europe-
wide ban. In Sweden,TV3 and Kanal 5,
two private networks broadcasting from
Great Britain, simply operate outside
the law.
The second line of defence is that
bombarding children with advertising
is harmless.The Advertising Education
Forum—an organization whose board of
directors includes advertisers,
broadcasters and communication
consulting agencies—has just published
the findings of a survey of 5,000 parents
in 20 European countries. Some 85
percent of those polled said that
advertising has little or no effect on their
offspring.
In the past few years, Je f f r e y
G o l d s t e i n , a researcher in the
communications department at the
University of Utrecht (the Netherlands),
has conducted four surveys for the
European Commission in Sweden,
B e l g i u m , the Netherlands and Great
B r i t a i n .“ There is no convincing proof,”
he wrote, “that advertising affects
c h i l d r e n ’s values, eating habits, s m o k i n g
and consumption of alcohol… Children
are more influenced by their parents
and playmates than the media.”And he
concludes that “people exaggerate the
power of advertising simply because it is
omnipresent.”
Bringing up
critical consumers
Goldstein has just completed a
separate report for the European
Commission as part of its revision of
the Television without Fr o n t i e r s
d i r e c t i v e. “He appeals to advertisers’
sense of responsibility,” says Daniel
Aboaf, vice-president of the European
Toy Industry (ETI), a manufacturers’
o r g a n i z a t i o n .“Self-regulation based on
simple guidelines is better than
prohibitive measures.”
To prove that their influence on
children is weak,advertisers also stress
the price argument. They claim it costs
three times less to reach a child than an
adult through advertising. The new
generation is more diverse, thus harder
to target and create brand loyalty.
Although they are influenced by
w h a t e v e r ’s new, advertisers claim it’s
more difficult to capture their attention.
In May, the Swedish culture minister (centre) rallies support at an EU meeting.

In a study requested by the European
C o m m i s s i o n , Reinhold Bergler, a
university professor in Bonn, shows that
33.6 percent of children under six
express scepticism with regard to
advertising’s credibility.
Defenders of the status quo, t h e n ,
argue that despite the substantial
amounts of money poured into
advertising that targets children,it has
little effect on them. Pushing the
paradox further, they emphasize that
children have a strong critical sense.
And a sense of responsibility. Rather
than deprive them of advertising, i t
would be better to teach them how to
watch it.“ I t ’s up to parents and teachers
to teach children the realities of the
commercial world. Just like they teach
them how to cross the street,” says the
British magazine The Economist.
Bound by 
money
Television networks and producers
have also taken sides in the debate,
pointing out that children’s advertising
creates jobs. In the European Union,
revenues from this business have
reached between 670 million to one
billion euros  ($620 and $930 million) a
y e a r. In countries that have imposed
quotas to encourage the development of
home-grown entertainment, that income
finances domestically-produced shows
and curbs imports of series and cartoons
from the United States and Ja p a n .
France, for example, is now the world’s
third-leading producer of cartoon series.
But with just 300 hours, that country is
still far behind the two world leaders.
But regardless of whether one
prefers European series to their foreign
counterparts for reasons of style or
c u l t u r e, their purpose remains the same.
Whenever advertising finances
p r o g r a m m i n g, the main aim is to attract
an audience, preferably a specific one,
towards the product. Television and
business are unabashed about their
incestuous relationship. As soon as a
series is successful, the characters are
licensed to sweet-makers, fast food
chains and service stations, w h i c h
duplicate them ad nauseaum.A case in
point is the Japanese series Pokemon.
“Any prohibition or additional
restrictions on children’s advertising in
Europe would have a devastating effect
on television production,” says Cindy
R o s e, a lobbyist for the Walt Disney
group in Brussels. Her concern is not
limited to defending artistic creation
and the jobs that go with it.In addition
to selling programmes to television
networks, the Eurodisney park,movies
and countless derivative products also
fuel the company’s prosperity in Europe.
Production and advertising feed off one
another.
Companies in
the classroom
Whatever their future on television
n e t w o r k s, advertisers are already active
in other areas.The increased presence of
companies in schools is a worrisome
trend for many childhood specialists.
Fast food,s o d a , sports shoe and clothing
brands do more than distribute samples
and advertising kits with the quiet
complicity of teachers. “ P r o d u c t
managers think that each cafeteria, e a c h
classroom…is a serious opportunity to
chase after whatever’s cool,” w r i t e s
Naomi Klein in No Logo ( P i c a d o r,
2 0 0 0 ). The government in Britain has
had no qualms about asking private
companies to rescue public schools with
dwindling resources.
Even in this area,television plays a
r o l e. In the United States, the private
Channel One network,which broadcasts
educational programmes to an
estimated eight million children in
12,000 schools, charges advertisers twice
as much as general interest networks.
The paradise of childhood is green,the
colour of the dollar. ■
Children are a prime influence on household purchases of multimedia products.
