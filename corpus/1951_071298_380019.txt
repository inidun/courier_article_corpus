- Thanks To Unesco's Desert Schools
..
40, 000 MIDDLE EAST REFUGEE
CHILDREN HAVE CLAIMED HEIR RIGHT
to EDUCATION---.----'
ON a road that stretches across
the Sinai desert, there lies a
small town called K h a n
Younes (Jonah's Inn). Once it
was a busy centre of Arab Pales-
tine's border life, the first stop for
motorists travelling from Egypt to
Palestine. But, just over two years
ago, war flowed and ebbed over
Khan Younes ; and only now has
the town, at present in Egyptian-
occupied territory, returned to
normal life.
Some of its citizens have been
able to resume an almost normal
existence. But many thousands
of men and women are still suffer-
ing from the tragic effects of
war. And the visitor who comes to
Khan Younes for the first time, is
struck by most pathetic sights.
Scores of tents pitched in the
desert sand shelter refugees and
their families. A short distance
from these rather primitive living
quarters are a dozen isolated tents
which are used for several hours
each day as schools for a few
hundred refugee children, who,
forgetting their misfortunes, crowd
into the tents to receive an elemen-
tary school education.
Of the children attentively fol-
lowing the lessons, some are seated
on small, narrow benches ; others
stand or squat on the ground. The
teachers, using empty UNICEF milk
cases as desks and large stones as
chairs, go to endless pains to make
their pupils understand the ele-
ments of reading and writing.
An Image Comes Alive
IN one tent, the children arelearning to recite and chant
the Koran. A few steps away,
a group of boys are learning to
count on their fingers. Nearby, a
small crowd of children are gather-
ed at the entrance to a large
tent. One by one the children
enter and as each walks in, he is
given a tin cup full of milk. Then
he takes his seat alongside mothers
feeding their babies. Plates of
porridge and malted rice are
handed round. This is the midday
meal-an extra ration provided
by UMCEF.
At Nuseirat, these Arab boys are building their own school out of mud bricks.
Raw materials-water, sand and sun-are plentiful and the work goes with a
swing for the boys'enthusiasm is boundless.
Such sights as these greeted
Jaime Torres Bodet when he visited
the Arab refugee children in the
Gaza area early last month. The
Director-General of Unesco was
accompanied by Mohamed Shafik
Ghorbal Bey, Under-Secretary of
State, Egyptian Ministry of Educa-
tion, and a member of Unesco's
Executive Board, as well as by Sir
John Maud, Under-Secretary of

State, British Ministry of Educa-
tion and former chairman of Unes-
co's Executive Board. They had
flown from Cairo to El Arish,
across the Suez Canal and motored
down to Gaza.
Khan Younes was their first
stop. The tent schools that Unesco
had helped set up in the desert
for Arab refugee children had
until then been only an image in
their minds. Now, however, the
picture had come to life. Khan
Younes shows what a tent school
means ; shows that although the
most essential school equipment
has now been provided, there is
still much to do.
Schoolboy Builders
WHEN M. Torres Bodet, Ghor-
bal Bey and Sir John Maud
reached the tent schools of
Nuseirat, a few miles away in the
vicinity of Gaza, they saw that
further progress had been achiev-
ed. Children looked healthier and
better clad, vocational training had
been started ; and though some
classes were still under tents, the
children had at least the comfort-
ing sight of more permanent
quarters rising nearby.
Only the outside walls of the
building have been completed, but
the rest will soon be ready. This
the children know, for they are
building the schools with their own
hands, out of bricks made with the
raw materials-mainly water, sand
and sun-found on the spot. The
work is easy ; the enthusiasm
boundless.
Sports have greatly helped in
raising the morale and the hopes
for the future of these children.
Between classes, they have a
vast playground-the desert. But
when the school bell-sometimes
a present from a faraway school
in England or France-is heard,
they return as eagerly to their
tents.
In Gaza itself, the children are
housed in proper schools untouched
by the fighting. They have expe-
rienced teachers and secondary
education is available to them.
Vocational training is given in two
large sheds where scores of boys
begin training as binders, carpen-
ters and weavers.

Chief Asset-Enthusiasm
-UNESCO'S work of educational
assistance for Arab refugee
children began early in 1949
when schools were set up in a few
camps. By December 31st, 1950,
over forty thousand were attending
Unesco schools. Of 24, 500 pupils
in the Gaza area, representing 43
per cent of refugee children in this
zone, twenty thousand go to
Unesco schools, 1, 200 to Egyptian
Government schools and 3, 300 to
private schools. They are looked
after by 409 teachers-all of them
refugees. Some have been trained
in teachers'colleges and have also
acquired experience in the schools
set up in Palestine under the Bri-
tish mandate.
In the Unesco schools, the chil-
dren learn reading and writing in
Arabic and arithmetic and in most
cases, elementary history and geo-
graphy and sometimes agriculture
are taught.
Most of the Unesco schools had
to be set up with makeshift means
in tents or in the open air. A
serious handicap in the early
stages was the absence of seats,
tables, chairs, blackboards, exercise
books, pencils and textbooks. And
today there are still refugee
"schools"where these essentials
are lacking and where the chief
working asset is the enthusiasm of
the teachers.
The understandable desire of
the refugee population to give
their children education, ele-
mentary though it be ; the per-
sistent efforts of voluntary organi-
zatioI1s to give the refugees some-
thing more enduring than the bare
means of subsistence ; and lastly,
the work of Unesco, which has
championed throughout the world
the rights of refugee children to
education-all these factors have
combined to bring about a steady
increase in the number of schools
and their attendance.
The educational assistance pro-
gramme is now operated jointly by
Unesco and the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA). The latter organiza-
tion is responsible for administra-
tive questions and is bearing a
major part of the financial burden.
A tremendous amount of work
still lies ahead. There is still in-
sufficient school equipment. Ac-
cordingly, the General Conference
of Unesco last year renewed its
appeal to the United Nations, go-
vernments of Member States,
National Commissions and private
organizations, for generous assis-
tance so that the education of
these children might be carried on.
There is every reason to hope
that the programme of educational
assistance for refugee children in
the Middle East-inspired by the
right of those children to educa-
tion, initiated with the help of so
many organizations and carried
out in a most constructive spirit
of collaboration-can be conti-
nued until the problem of the Pa-
lestinian refugees is finally olved.
