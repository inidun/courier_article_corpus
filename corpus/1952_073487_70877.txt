WHY THERE IS A
NEWSPRINT CRISIS
INSUFFICIENT
BEFORE the war, the annual outputof newsprint-7, 000, 000 metric
tons-was just about equal to
the demand. The United States con-
sumed nearly half the world's supply,
while Britain used one sixth-more
than the whole of the rest of Europe
combined (excluding the USSR).
Canada was the main producer of
newsprint with the United Kingdom,
the United States and the Scandina-
vian countries well behind her.
The post-war situation. however.
was very different. Production had
fallen far behind the world's needs.
Although the United States was now
using more newsprint than ever
before, circumstances resulting from
hostilities had resulted in a sharp
drop in European countries.
What is the present situation ?
The most recent statistics-thosf
of 1950-show that world produc-
tion has increased by more than
2, 000, 000 metric tons over the 1938
total. Once again Canada has been
in the lead : production there has
risen from 2, 624, 000 to 4, 788. 000 tons.
In comparison, the United States'
increase has been small-180, 000
tons. United Kingdom production
has dropped by 300. 000 tons, and
that of Germany by 160, 000.
But, at the same time, consumption
in the United States has gone up by
2, 300, 000 tons-in other words, the
United States has more than absorbed
the rise in world production. Mean-
while, while the countries of the
European continent more or less
maintained their 1938 level of con-
sumption, Britain has had to drop to
about half her pre-war figure-from
1. 261, 000 tons to 653, 000.
In summing up the present situa-
tion, therefore, (leaving out the ques-
tion of needs) the United States
having absorbed the world's great
increase in production and the Conti-
nent of Europe's consumption having
remained stable at its pre-war level,
the dominant factor is the reduction
in the United Kingdom's consumption
of newsprint.

This state of affairs is, however,
only partly a matter of supply diffi-
culties. The main problem is one of
foreign exchange faced by countries
outside the dollar area. Thus, it can
be seen that the two essential ele-
ments in the present newsprint crisis
are an inadequacy of production,
accompanied by a rise in prices.
It may seem at first glance that
talking about inadequacy of produc-
tion is not entirely accurate, since
world production has gone up by a
third in the period between 1938 and
1950. But the demand for newsprint
has also soured : and only in the
United States. and perhaps in Canada
and other producing countries, has it
been satisfies.
It must. however, be borne in mind
that the demand for newsprint has
increased all over the world, and not
only in the United States. If such
factors as wartime restrictions, econo-
mic recovery and austerity pro-
grammes explain some of the limita-
tions on the use of newsprint, they do
not indicate a healthy or lasting state
of affairs, and certainly not one that
should be encouraged. The problem
is far more than merely technical or
economic. New and constantly
expanding markets for newsprint are
being created by the growing use of
mass communication and means of
information ; by the awakening of
interest in national and international
problems among millions of human
beings ; by the vital importance for
every one of us of the problems that
face governments and influence
public opinion ; by the first results of
emancipations recently achieved by
certain peoples and of sovereignty
newly acquired by a number of
States ; by the great can : paigns which
are being waged against illiteracy.
Yes, there is certainly room for
more newspapers (and bigger ones,
for in most European countries they
have greatly diminished in size) if
only the paper were available-and
if it could be obtained at prices which
potential users could pay..
HIGH
PRICES
But there are two difficulties, which
do not apply only to newsprint, but
are particularly applicable to it. One
is that most of the available news-
print is in the dollar area, and must
be paid for in dollars. Thus, on a
free international market, consumers
outside the dollar area have an
obvious disadvantage. The other dif-
ficulty is that prices have soared. A
recent study by Unesco revealed that
the price of a home-produced ton of
newsprint in the United Kingdom rose
from'$84. 40 in January 1950 to
$163. 80 in March 1951. In Belgium,
between the same dates, the increase
has been from $112 to $205.
The figures for imported newsprint
were equally alarming. In Belgium,
the cost of a ton of imported news-
print has gone up from $124 in
January 1951 to $280 in March 1951,
while in Egypt the rise was from
$140 to $336. And since this survey
the figures have risen still higher.
In other words, the many-sided
problem of newsprint Ã©alls urgently
for remedial measures on an interna-
tional level. But, even if the prelimin-
ary recommendations of Unesco and
of the Economic and Social Council
of the United Nations are accepted
and carried out ; even if the produ-
cers succeed in increasing their out-
put rapidly ; even if the main consum-
ers give a good example of unsel-
fishness and international solidarity
by agreeing to cut their consumption
slightly-there will still be a need
for energetic action in the matter of
prices if the situation is to be made
normal and the urgent needs satisfied.
Failing such action, the newsprint
crisis will continue to worsen in those
countries which feel the need most
acutely to provide their people with
free, plentiful, varied and easily
accessible information.
It is hard to say who or what would
benefit from such a situation, but it
is quite easy to name the victim why
has already begun to suffer from the :
present state of affairs. The victim
is democracy.
Photo shows that a newspaper weighing almost 2 Ibs requires over 5 tbs of wood, coal and chemical substances
in its production : 3 tubs of spruce wood, 1 ounce of sulphur, 1 ounce of bleaching powder, 1. 5 ounces of unslacked
lime, and red and blue dye. These are converted into enough stock for one newspaper by about 2 Ibs of coal.
