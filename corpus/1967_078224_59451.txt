Three centuries of demography
JOHN GRAUNT'S
OFFSPRING
by Boris Urlanis
A
nniversaries of prominent
scientists are usually fairly easy to
establish, but the birthday of a branch
of science is often hidden in the
depths of time. Demography is a
fortunate exception, for its birthday
has been established beyond all
reasonable doubt January 1662, when
John Graunt, a London businessman,
published his Natural and Political
Observations Made Upon the Bills of
Mortality. This book was the world's
first piece of research in the field now
known as demography.
Five years ago demographers cele¬
brated the tercentenary of their trade;
be it said to the honour of Soviet
scholars that they set the ball rolling
by reading a paper on the subject at
the 33rd Session of the International
Statistical Institute in Paris in the
summer of 1961.
The writer Stefan Zweig once used
the term "the astral hours of man-
to describe moments of great human
spiritual uplift, when the genius in
man is being awaked. Out of millions
of human beings only one genius is
born, he wrote, only one provides
mankind with a truly historic astral
hour.
Such an astral hour struck when
John Graunt the successful business¬
man in London, sitting before a warm
fire scanning the weekly Bills of Mor¬
tality in London, conceived the brilliant
idea of subjecting these Bills, with
their mass of figures, to a scientific

BORIS URLANIS is one of the Soviet
Union's leading demographers and statistic¬
ians. Professor of demography at the Ins¬
titute of Economics, U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences, he has written many books and
studies, and In particular on the theory of
statistics and on war and the population
of Europe.
analysis. His book was the outcome
of this fireside contemplation. In this
way the bright ideas of John Graunt
led to the birth of demography in
London.
Graunt had many followers, promi¬
nent among them William Petty, a
close friend, who took demography a
step forward by a number of interest¬
ing calculations and the conclusions
drawn from them. He calculated, for
instance, that 3,000 people had died
in the biggest Paris hospital solely
because the hospital was badly
organized. It is true that some of his
assumptions later proved to be un¬
founded; for example, he computed
that the population of London would
continue growing only until 1800, whe¬
reas it actually increased eightfold bet¬
ween 1800 and 1950.
Following in the footsteps of Graunt
and Petty, the English astronomer
Edmund Halley made a big contribu¬
tion to the new science. He used
data from the city of Breslau (now
Wroclaw) to compile the first mortal¬
ity table which was published in 1693
by the Royal Society (the oldest scien¬
tific society in Great Britain, founded
in 1660).
In the 18th century demography
made its way to the European conti¬
nent, where many of the best minds
had begun to take an interest in popu¬
lation problems. The German pastor
J. P. Siissmilch made a further impor¬
tant contribution in 1742 with his book
Die göttliche Ordnung in den Ver¬
änderungen des menschlichen Ge¬
schlechts. (The Divine Ordinance
manifested in the Human Race through
Birth, Death and Propagation.) A
wealth of demographic data was
gathered for this book from which
some significant conclusions were
drawn.
It was about this time that demo¬
graphy was first taken up in Russia.
Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian scholar
of exceptional versatility physicist,
chemist, poet, geographer, economist,
statistician... and demographer was
the first Russian scientist to raise the
question of demography. He did so
on the grand scale, outlining his ideas
on the subject in a letter written on
November 1, 1761 to his friend Count
Shuvalov, a favourite of the Empress
Elizabeth.
The letter was a remarkable treatise
on population policy. Lomonosov
referred to "the preservation and in¬
crease of the people". He spoke of
the various factors hindering the
growth of the population and suggest¬
ed ways and means of overcoming
them. He called attention to the differ¬
ences in the ages of husbands and
wives, to the very high level of infant
mortality, to the effect of alcoholism on
the death rate, etc. He also spoke of
emigration and called Russians who
left their native land "living corpses".
Shortly after this, Count Shuvalov
lost favour at court and so Lomono-
sov's letter (which was addressed to
the Count) had no immediate results.
But it is important to know that in
Russia the question of a rational demo¬
graphic policy was raised just over 200
years ago.
At the end of the 18th century, a
slim work written by an anonymous
author and entitled "An Essay on the
Principle of Population" was published
in England. It put forward the view
that the poverty of the mass of the
population was due simply to the
sexual instinct of reproduction and
was not a consequence of the econo¬
mic and political systems of that time.
The author of this work was an English
clergyman, Thomas Robert Malthus.

JOHN GRAUNT'S OFFSPRING (Continued)
"A maximum increase in population
is not a blessing among all peoples'
In the 19th century the development
of demography continued, although it
was not baptised until 1855 when the
French scholar Achille Guillard used
the word démographie in the title of
his book Eléments de statistique
humaine ou démographie comparée.
As a scientific term, therefore, "demo¬
graphy"" is little more than 100 years
old.
In the 20th century demography
began to attract greater attention:
institutes of demography were found¬
ed, special journals appeared, congres¬
ses were convened and demography
was added to many university sylla¬
buses.
In the U.S.S.R. and other socialist
countries demography has been very
widely developed as a prerequisite of
economic and social planning and the
general improvement of living stand¬
ards. Take housing for instance.
About ten million Soviet people move
into new apartments every year, and
architects want demographers to tell
them what the future size of families
will be so as to build apartments
of the appropriate size. Those who
plan sports grounds and stadiums,
hospitals, theatres and other public
buildings want demographers to esti¬
mate the composition of the commu¬
nity by age groups.

LANNING bodies in gene¬
ral have to know what sex and age
groups will make up the population at
any future date. To plan nurseries,
kindergartens, day and boarding
schools it is essential to know how
large each group of children is likely
to be in future years, which means that
the probable percentage of births for
each age group of women has to be
computed as accurately as possible.
The bodies that plan retail trade
also need population forecasts. They
need to know the number of children so
as to plan the output of toys, or the
number of those reaching manhood so
as to plan the output of razor
blades and electric shavers. The cloth¬
ing and footwear trades know that a
young man of 18 requires suits, shirts
and shoes of certain sizes; but this is
not enough they must know how
many young men will be needing these
articles next year and the year after.
The sex-and-age analysis of the
population is of even greater impor¬
tance in the sphere of employment.
Young people of the rising generation
should have the chance to make the
best use of their skills and energy.
In this respect it is important to ration¬
alise population movement so that
young people may know in which part
of the country they are most needed.
Lenin once said that science is one
of the ways of serving the people.
This is probably truer of demography
than of any of the kindred sciences.
The people themselves are the very
subject of demography. In our age,
the age of democratic development,
demography thus acquires particular
significance.
The authors of an article on history
in the Encyclopedia of Social Scien¬
ces (1) shrewdly remark that genealogy
" ...has seen itself gradually replaced
by demography, a newcomer, which
seems to have delayed its entrance
into the world of history until the king
of former times was replaced by
demos, the sovereign of today, the
modern object of the study of histo¬
rians."
Analysis of demographic data may
have results that influence the health
of the population; it may improve,
prolong and enrich the lives of millions.
It is this sort of active demography
that must replace passive contempla¬
tion, the mere recording of facts, with¬
out drawing conclusions, making
recommendations or explaining causes.
To paraphrase Marx, one might say
that until now demographers have
described reality, whereas the impor¬
tant thing is to change it. Demography
should not replace the natural scien¬
ces, but should work with them to
help fulfil man's ancient dream the
abolition of premature death and the
assurance of a long, happy and active
life.
How can demographers help to
increase man's life span?
In countries with developed statistic¬
al services every death finds its way
into statistics. Every death is register¬
ed, a form is filled in and the facts
are then summarised and become part
of the statistics of mortality. These
statistics are a vital source of infor¬
mation on all questions connected
with life expectancy.
0 NE anatomical theatre
bears the inscription: "Here the dead
teach the living". Something similar
may be said of mortality statistics the
dead teach their descendants, in the
mortality statistics the dead again
acquire a voice. This explains why
many scholars have long been study¬
ing mortality figures.
About a hundred years ago the Bel¬
gian statistician, Lambert Adolphe
Quetelet, said that we know less about
birth statistics than about mortality
figures, because man is obviously less
interested in how he entered life than
in how he may leave it. For him the
laws of birth have only a relative
interest compared to the crucial ques¬
tion of his chances of life and
death (2).
Mortality statistics are tremendous¬
ly instructive. We learn little from the
individual death that can help us in the
battle for longevity. The death of each
individual organism has its own specific
causes. But side by side with these,
other causes related to general condi¬
tions of human life are also operat¬
ing.
In each case death results from
joint action by general and individual
causes. It is thus impossible to
distinguish the effect of the general
causes in each death, but this becomes
possible when information is available
on a large number of cases taken
from statistics covering the population
as a whole. When observations are
made on a mass scale, everything inci¬
dental due to partial causes is remov¬
ed or neutralised, or is mutually
compensated; then a law emerges to
reveal the operation of common
causes and conditions.
A NOTHER big task for
demographers is the study of the birth
rate. In the Soviet Union, the radical
changes that have taken place in the
social position of women, their partici¬
pation in production side by side with
men, have reduced the size of families.
The Central Asian peoples, the Ar¬
menians and the Azerbaijanians still
keep up the tradition of big families,
but since these peoples represent only
ten per cent of the population of the
U.S.S.R. they do not greatly effect the
overall national figure.
Family planning of the number of
births is causing a steady reduction
' in the birth rate. Ten years ago the

We completely disagree with Quetelet's
attitude to birth records. They are not
merely interesting, as Quetelet believed;
they provide us with a picture of the future
of peoples and nations. (Author.)

coefficient for the whole Soviet Union
was 26.6 per cent but by 1965 it had
fallen by more than a quarter to 18.5
per cent. This reduction in the birth
rate is largely due to the war of 1941-
45; in those years there was a sharp
drop in the birth rate, and twenty
years later, when girls born in the war
years began to marry, the annual mar¬
riage rate dropped from 12.1 per 1000
(1960) to 8.5 per 1000 (1964).
The reduction in what demographers
call the fertility rate does not seem
to affect women up to 25 years of
age, since most young married women
want to have at least one child. In
the next age group, 25-29 years, there
has been a regular reduction in fertility
more than 10 per cent in the last six
years. The decrease is even more
marked among older women so that the
percentage of young mothers has
increased in recent years.
Although the birth rate has dropped,
in the U.S.S.R. it is still high enough
to ensure an increase in the popula¬
tion with each generation.
Today a scholar cannot confine his
studies to his own country. The demo¬
grapher is interested in world popula¬
tion problems, especially the problems
of the developing countries. A maxi¬
mum Increase in the population cannot
be regarded as a blessing in all coun¬
tries and among all peoples. In some
developing countries the labour force
is not fully employed, and this only
serves to retard their economic
growth.
Many of these countries possess
large areas of unused land, and their
crops have small yields, but larger
investments than these countries can
afford are required to increase the per-
acre yields or to extend the area under
crops. Thus, statements made by some
scholars to the effect that our planet
can feed a population thousands
of times greater than at present
(13,000,000 million has been mention¬
ed) are merely abstract speculation. It
is unfortunate that such fantastic
statements are printed and publicised.
In European and North American
countries the lowering of the mortality
rate has been accompanied by a lower¬
ing of the birth rate. It seems clear
that in a number of developing coun¬
tries, too, the problem of reducing the
birth rate must take its place along¬
side industrialization, social reform
and cultural growth if a sound basis
for economic progress is to be
assured.
In some of these countries the birth
rate will be reduced to a certain
extent as a result of women's participa¬
tion in production, a higher level of
culture and the development of indus¬
try. In certain countries, however, a
demographic policy specifically aimed
at smaller families may be of great
significance. The example of Japan,
where the birth rate has been halved,
is particularly instructive.
Recognition of the advisability of
reducing the birth rate in a number of
countries has nothing in common with
malthusianism. Malthus's theory of the
two progressions has not withstood
the test of time his assertion that the
output of food increases in arithmet¬
ical progression has no foundation in
fact. Equally untrue is his assertion
that population, increases follow bio¬
logical laws. Actually the determining
laws are socio-economic laws, since,
in the final analysis, the cultural level
and the implementation of certain
social measures determine the rate of
population growth.
The spread of the idea of family
planning makes for a richer spiritual
life for women and at the same time
helps to keep population growth at an
optimum level. In other words, each
country must search for conditions
that are most expedient from the point
of view both of the economy and of
population growth rates. It is for de¬
mographers to ensure that the most
rational rates of population growth are
maintained.
The demographer's task is not one **
of passively recording population /
phenomenahe must be active and
help achieve the maximum "per capita
happiness" of the people.

If the first man and woman had been born at the start of
the Christian Era, and if the world's population had since
increased at its present rate (doubling roughly every 40 years),
there would now be
250,000 times more
people in the world.
A city like Paris
would have
1,500,000,000,000
inhabitants.

A country such as
Japan would have
25,000,000,000,000
inhabitants - 54
per square yard.
