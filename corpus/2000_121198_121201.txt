WHERE THE RICHES LIE
The preservation of forest areas can only be funded through regulated and sustainable 
use of the rest of the Amazonian jungle
At stake are not just the millions of
square kilometres of jungle or the
14,000 million cubic metres of timber gro-
wing in the region, or even the fact that it
is a biological reserve that contains a third
of the world’s plant and animal species.
Behind the dispute that has set off so
many debates in parliament over much of
the past year are advocates of two very dif-
ferent models of development.
Rural landowners naturally want to
continue chopping down trees to clear
land for cattle or agriculture. E n v i r o n-
mental organizations want to protect spe-
c i fic areas of tropical forest as agents of cli-
mate regulation, a source of future
m e d i c i n e s, a place for scientific research
and home to many indigenous tribes,w h i l e
leaving the logging industry to use the
rest of the jungle in a sustainable fashion.
The economic feasibility of the lan-
downers’ stance has already been chal-
lenged by the facts, while the ecologists’
plans are only feasible if accompanied
by a myriad of other measures. Ecotou-
rism is one possible source of revenue, a s
is use of the jungle’s pharmaceutical or
biotechnological re-
sources.
But the region’s main
income would still come
from logging. There has
been significant progress
in this activity, such as the
planting of a million hec-
tares of trees for timber
in the past seven years.
A score of A m a z o n i a n
sawmills have pledged to
rotate their use of forest
areas and allow the
forests to regenerate.
One such company, Mil
M a d e i r e i r a s, w a s
awarded a quality certifi-
cate by the Forest Ste-
wardship Council (FSC),
the chief monitor of sus-
tainable forestry deve-
l o p m e n t , after dividing
55,000 hectares into 30
lots with a rotation
system to ensure that each lot was only
touched every 30 years.The firm also has
a 25,000 hectare reserve which it pre-
serves permanently.Another 17 compa-
nies are willing to follow the example of
Mil Madeireiras and hope to get certifi-
cates from the FSC.Among them is Cikel,
the region’s biggest sawmill.
But “ c e r t i fie d ”companies such as these
are still rare among hundreds of semi-legal
c o m p e t i t o r s. Most of the 1,600 sawmills 
in the Brazilian Amazonia are small or
medium-sized outfits that account for 70
percent of total production. “Illegal 
timber will always be cheaper,”says A d a l-
berto Ve r í s s i m o,a biologist with the Insti-
tute of People and the Environment in
A m a z o n i a . He is
counting on two
government measures
to speed up regulation
of logging.
The first is the
National Forestry Pro-
gramme being drawn
up by the Environ-
ment Ministry to
encourage new tree
plantations and pro-
tect existing ones.Th e
other is to make com-
panies bid for logging
p e r m i t s. Ve r í s s i m o
says the government
will have more
control over felling if
it is done on publicly
owned land.
Apart from logging, the possibility of
planting new areas that will act as carbon
sinks (in an effort to limit climate change
in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol),
has sparked the interest of several of the
r e g i o n ’s landowners. A pilot project is
under way on the island of Bananal, in the
far south of the region, sponsored by a
foundation linked to the U.S. electricity
multinational American Electric System.
This aims to preserve 200,000 hectares, a s
well as plant 240,000 saplings and recover
800 hectares each year.
Biotechnology is the region’s third big
investment opportunity.In the coming year,
a centre for research into the A m a z o n
r e g i o n ’s resources will open in Manaus.Th i s
is urgently needed because foreign labora-
tories are already developing thousands of
drugs based on the traditional knowledge of
Amazonian tribes.One of the best examples
is a cure for high blood pressure,C a p o t e n ,
made by scientists (at the pharmaceutical
company Bristol-Meyers Squibb) from the
venom of the j a r a r a c á s n a k e.
A couple of years ago the government
asked a group of scientists to focus their
work on A m a z o n i a . One of the group’s
main conclusions was that the region
could support all kinds of activity, f r o m
agriculture and logging to extracting
natural resources. Even the much-criti-
cized pasture lands were said to be tole-
r a b l e. According to Roberto K i s h i n a m i ,
head of Greenpeace-Brazil, “the best
thing would be to designate commercial
and ecological areas
and see which ones
should be protected
and at what cost.”
Two of Brazil’s A m a-
zonian states, R o n-
donia and To c a n t i n s,
are moving in exactly
this direction.
Early next year,
when the Brazilian
parliament takes up
the amendments to
the forestry regula-
tions again, t h e
country might clearly
identify what kind of
activities should be
allowed in A m a z o n i a .
The parliamentary
debates will coincide
with publication of the annual defores-
tation figures by the National Institute
for Space Research,INPE—figures that
will tell whether ecologists or rural lan-
downers have won the war of percen-
tages.
But another problem will remain:h o w
to make the transition from a world of
symbolic victories and defeats, of laws
which are not obeyed,to one where the
government manages to convert symbols
into reality. ■
