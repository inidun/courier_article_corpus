BOROBUDUR
The colossal Javanese sanctuary,
the world's largest ensemble
of Buddhist reliefs
threatened by imminent destruction
by Bernard P. Groslier
Co/our page
Top, on the three upper terraces of the
great temple of Borobudur (Indonesia)
stand three symetrical rings of stupas
(bell-shaped shrines) with perforated walls,
the whole encircling a single giant stupa
(seen on right of photo). Each of the
small stupas enshrines a statue of the
Buddha in - a pose of eternal meditation.
But down the centuries many statues
have been damaged and even decapitated
by vandals. The buddha in foreground
no longer has a stupa to protect it from
the elements. Bottom, one of the 1,460
bas-reliefs covering six kilometres of
terrace walls on which unfolds the rich
imagery of Buddhist cosmology.
Encroaching mosses and lichens, erosion
and shifting of stonework, seen in photo,
threaten to destroy the entire temple.

BERNARD P. GROSLIER is in charge of
archaeological research at the Ecole Fran¬
çaise d'Extrême-Orient at Siem Reap, near
Angkor, Cambodia. As chief custodian of
monuments at Angkor, he has directed the
vast restoration and conservation pro¬
gramme at this world-famous site for many
years. This year he led a Unesco mission,
in collaboration with the Dutch geologist
Caesar Voute, to Borobudur to survey the
damage In the great temple, and elaborated
a detailed plan for rescuing it from des¬
truction. He also studied other important
sites in Central Java and has put forward
a project for their restoration and develop¬
ment. Two of his books have been trans¬
lated into English: "The Art of Indochina",
Methuen, London, 1962 (republished under
the title "Indochina" by World Publications,
New York, and Müller, London, '1967); and
"Angkor, Art and Civilization", Praeger,
New York, J 966.
I N the heart of Java, sur¬
rounded by volcanic peaks that rise
up beyond the clouds like thrones
for the gods, stands Borobudur, a
reminder to men of Buddha's eternal
message of compassion and serenity.
Borobudur was the greatest sanc¬
tuary in the world in the closing years
of the 8th century, when it was built
by the powerful Sailendra kings who
reigned over the island empire of the
Southern Seas. And to this day it
represents the climax of the extraor¬
dinary odyssey of Buddhism, which
was born in India, spread through¬
out the whole of Asia and finally dis¬
appeared from its native soil at the
very moment when its most noble
monuments were being raised in coun¬
tries where it had become the living
faith.
Perhaps no other temple is so literal¬
ly an "act of faith" as Borobudur.
From its base, 1 1 7 metres square, rise
four terraces, identical in design but
each smaller than the preceding one,
forming a pyramid. The supporting
walls of the base and those of the
rectangular terraces are covered in
bas-reliefs.
Along the edge of the walk which
encircles each terrace stands a high
balustrade decorated on both sides
with sculptures and crowned by a
series of niches containing statues of
the Buddhas, masters of the four points
of the compass.
When a pilgrim climbs the narrow
stairway between the terraces and
walks along these open-air galleries,
with nothing above him but the sky, he
is completely cut off from the outside
world and its temptations, and can
meditate more deeply on the message
carved out by the sculptor. But the
pilgrim looking up from ground-level
sees only the Buddhas, rising into the
sky as the first symbols of hope.
Once he has completed this long
spiritual journey, the pilgrim reaches
the three upper terraces, perfect
circles and entirely undecorated, on
which stand like a triple crown of
jewels the seventy-two stupas, through
whose delicate stone tracery he
glimpses statues of the Buddha in
meditation.
Crowning Borobudur is a GreatStupa,
its apex 40 metres above the ground.
Sealed, hollow and empty, the stupa
enshrines the Supreme Truth Nirva¬
na inaccessible to all since it can be
perceived only at the instant when the
Sage renounces his quest to attain it.
Step by step, the pilgrim is guided
and upheld in his spiritual quest by
this rosary of stone. The base of
the pyramid was originally ornamented
with reliefs depicting worldly desires
and pleasures. These have been hid¬
den by a second foundation of heaped-
up stones, which has never been
finished and whose purpose is still a
subject of controversy.
Some see it simply as a reinforce¬
ment made necessary, even in those
times, by an ominous subsidence of
the building. For others it is a ritual
"screen" to hide the actual evocation
of sin from the eyes of the monks,
yet reminding them of the presence of
the reliefs as symbols of the ali-
pervasive threat of evil. Another pos¬
sible explanation is that a later ruler
"reappropriated" the sanctuary, wish¬
ing to embellish and enlarge it and
thus acquire on easy terms the merit
due to the founder of such a monu-
Many such examples are to be found J -I
in Asia and I am inclined to agree
with this last explanation. Whatever
the reason, this later addition has

deprived us not only of a very fine
series of sculptures but, above all, of
the original architectural design, which
was infinitely more powerful than the
one we see today. It would be no
mean achievement if a rebuilding of
Borobudur restored it to its original
majesty.
On the walls of the four rectangular
terraces unfolds the story of Gautama
Buddha, episodes from his previous
existences that were to shape his
destiny, events from the epic story of
his life. Then, for further meditation,
comes the example of the Bodhisatva
Sudhana visiting the greatest Sages,
the sublime visions of Maitreya, who
is to be the future saviour of mankind,
and finally the thirty-two Buddhas
attaining' Nirvana.
After this long journey along the
paths of self-discipline, the pilgrim
emerges transformed into the "pure
lands" of the upper terraces, a world
without form and consequently with¬
out desires. He is in mid-air. The
path he has just followed is completely
hidden from him by the subtle patterns
of the architecture, a,nd he is isolated
from the world.
A sea of light surrounds him and
his gaze encompasses the great chain
of volcanic peaks rising on the horizon.
Close at hand, yet still out of reach
in the half-light of the fretted stupas,
he can just distinguish the meditating
Buddhas. Before him, dominating the
universe, the central stupa encloses
the inaccessible truth.
A labyrinth of stone leading to sal¬
vation in an admirable synthesis of
form and image this is Borobudur: the
largest and most complete ensemble
of Buddhist reliefs in the world, un¬
surpassed in artistic merit.
The material used is andésite, a
bluish-grey volcanic rock, porous and
rough like cinders. And yet the Java¬
nese sculptors have succeeded in
carving it with astonishing dexterity.
The line is incisive and clean, even
sharp, for every tiny roughness in the
surface catches the light.
But the subtle curves of the reliefs
breathe life into the bodies and the
lips. The sculptors have noted the
smallest detail of clothing or orna¬
ment with the precision of an ethno¬
grapher. Yet the composition has
immense simplicity and grace: a few
figures skilfully grouped like a scene
from a shadow-theatre, with a tree, a
bird or a flower to suggest the setting.
The ritual and the conventional
themes of Buddhist iconography de¬
picted along these hundreds of panels
could easily have been monotonous.
But with inventive genius and limit¬
less verve, the sculptors have produc
ed infinite variations on these themes,
whose interplay of pose, gesture and
facial expression makes each scene
an individual masterpiece.
Borobudur is in all respects the
largest, the most ancient and most
beautiful monument in the Southern
Hemisphere, and ranks among the
finest in Asia: Sanchi and Ajanta in
India, Angkor Wat and the Bayon in
Cambodia; the Great Wall of China
and the Kondo of Horyuji in Japan. It
is no less the peer of the finest master¬
pieces of its kind in the West, from the
Pyramids to Persepolis, from the Par¬
thenon to the Pantheon, from Saint
Sophia to Chartres and Saint Peter's.
Yet Borobudur is threatened by
imminent and inescapable destruction.
It is true that since its rediscovery at
the beginning of the 19th century it
has been protected, notably by major
restorations carried out between 1907
and 1911. But time has revealed their
inadequacy; and the process of decay
has accelerated so much during the
last few years that Borobudur Ls
doomed unless steps are taken at
once to save it.
Built on a hilltop a far from ideal
foundation the temple consists of ter¬
raced walls built of small blocks of
stone fitting perfectly together, but
not held in place by mortar or other
forms of bonding. The inside of the
temple is simply a great hard mound
of earth, piled up gradually during the
building.
The rains, which are particularly
heavy in this equatorial climate, seep
through the joints of the façades and
especially through the paving-stones,
into the central mound and wash away
the earth. Once the earth is loosened
in this way, the walls bear down on
the weakest spots, settle and lean out¬
wards, all the more rapidly for having
to carry the weight of the balustrades.
Obviously these movements go
through the whole structure, gathering
force as they go down, like a cascade.
Today the lowest terrace is on the
point of collapse, and would have
already given way, had the Indonesian
Archaeological Service not lightened
the load on it by dismantling some of
the balustrades. Needless to say, if
the bottom terrace collapses, like a
dam, Borobudur will come down in an
appalling avalanche of earth and
sculptures.
Not only is the structure of the
building threatened in this way, but
also the finely-chiselled ornamenta¬
tions. The water seeping through into
the inner mound cannot flow away
naturally into the earth and tends
therefore to rise again and evaporate
through the joints, and even through

Borobudur, undoubtedly the largest and
most significant monument in the
Southern Hemisphere, was built 1,100
years ago around a hilltop in
Central Java. It has been calculated
that tens of thousands of labourers,
craftsmen and artists must have
worked for scores of years to hew,
transport and place in position its
two million cubic feet of stone, carve
its 504 Buddha ¡mages and 2,500
square metres of reliefs and decorative
panels. Below, model of temple
showing basic architectural features:
four terraces with richly sculptured
galleries, triple crown of 72 perforated
stupas around the central stupa,
40 metres above ground level. Here
we see how the circle (symbolizing
the heavens) and the square
(symbolizing the earth) are
combined in the ancient design of
the temple.

Bas-relief of "celestial musicians" on second storey terrace
of Borobudur bears blemishes of damage and decay.
Large black patches show where rain water has seeped
into the inner mound and then eroded the stone. Carving

BOROBUDUR (Continued)
the stone itself, which is particularly
porous.
The moisture has set off a series
of physical and chemical changes,
which disintegrate this friable material,
especially the reliefs. A growing blan¬
ket of mosses, algae and lichens, and
vast colonies of bacilli flourish in the
damp and are hastening the process
of disintegration. Already, complete
sets of bas-reliefs have been badly
damaged and even if the rest miracu¬
lously escape collapse, they will perish
in the same way.
However immense the undertaking,
Borobudur must be saved. Experience
already gained in the restoration and
protection of stone and the success
of similar and equally vast enterprises
now being completed in different parts
of the world prove that the operation
is feasible.
It is certainly a colossal task, for
the only solution is to dismantle the
temple and reconstruct it stone by
stone. It will be rebuilt on a sup¬
porting structure of reinforced con¬
crete, designed to distribute the weight
evenly over the whole foundation and
to compensate for every kind of
movement, even that of earthquakes.
At the same time this structural frame
will stop water seeping into the cen¬
tral mound and consequently into the
stone. Morever, an adequate drain¬
age system will catch most of the
rain and channel it away before it
can do any damage.
In short, Borobudur will be treated
like an earth-fill dam, properly cov¬
ered by a water-tight shell. Once
the task is finished, none of these
protective works will be visible and the
temple will regain its true grandeur,
and even its original magnitude if the
first foundation-wall is cleared and the
reliefs uncovered. It is certain that
existing techniques for the protection
of stone surfaces will make it pos¬
sible to reduce the effects of climate
to a minimum.
The project to save Borobudur is
technically and scientifically feasible,
given the determination and adequate
means to see it through.
The Republic of Indonesia and its
highly qualified Archaeological Survey
Service recognize that Borobudur is
doomed, and despite the substantial
efforts they have made, they have had
to call, through Unesco, for the aid
and support of the international com¬
munity.
There can be no doubt that effec¬
tive means will be found to preserve
one of the most ¡Illustrious and mov¬
ing messages from1 our past, for sel¬
dom has mankind been called upon
to respond to a nobler or more un¬
selfish cause.

PRECARIOUS
SLANT
These photos clearly reveal the
tragic plight of Borobudur where
serious dislodgement of the
stonework threatens to bring
down the temple in an. appalling
avalanche of earth and sculptures.
Along the first terrace (left and
right) walls lean dangerously,
and stones in the magnificent
sculptured reliefs are splitting
and shifting. Large-scale
remedial measures are, urgently
needed to halt this process of
disintegration. Buddha figures
facing the wall have been
removed from niches and put
here In temporary security.

On each of the four sides of -the
temple, a stairway leads directly to
the summit and the Great Stupa
enshrining the Supreme Beatitude. As
the visitor mounts the stairway under
the gaze of the Buddhas in their
niches, he passes all the phases of
the Buddhist Way of Salvation,
symbolized by the architectural plan
of the temple and its myriad sculptured
decorations. From the sphere of
earthly existence and desires (the
foot of the base terrace) one passes
to the sphere of forms or ecstatic
visions (the four galleries with their
Buddhist reliefs) and finally to the
highest heavens of the future Buddhas
(the crowns of fretted stupas).
