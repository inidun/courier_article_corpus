IN MUNICH PINOCCHIO
AND B A B A R ARE
LANGUAGE TEACHERS
TODAY some of the oldest publiclibraries can look back on
more than a century of service
to the community. The children's
library movement, however, dates
back barely more than 50 years
when recognition of the many ser-
vices that a children's library can
offer was marked by the opening
of special children's corners in sev-
eral of the world's libraries.In this development the libraries
of the United States played an
important role, offering an example
for other countries to follow. In
1911, after a visit to the children's
room of the New York Public
Library, a distinguished Danish
author remarked :"I was prepared
for everything else I have seen in
America, but these children's libra-
ries are amazing. They surprise
and delight me... I should like to
spend a long time in this beautiful
room just reading in the company
of children. It is to become a
child again-a child with a new
freedom."
Today the idea is commonly
accepted and children's libraries
have become an. integral part of
the library system, their develop-
ment having gone hand in hand
with the rapid expansion of branch
libraries in the cities of many coun-
tries.
Many of the early ones were
inspired by the American example.
Thus, in 1911, after touring Ameri-
can libraries, Dr. Valfrid Palmgren
founded the Children's Library of
Stockholm, the first of its kind in
Europe.
In Paris and Brussels, children's
libraries under the name of
L'Heure Joyeuse were equipped by
Americans with assurance of main-
tenance by the municipalities. And
in London in 1920, a children's
library was created in the former
home of Charles Dickens. A staff
of boys and girls administered this
service under the direction of a
young American clergyman who
had discovered this"'Tiny Tim of a
House", and had seen in it a chil-
dren's library of unique possibili-
ties.
young in heart
SEPARATE buildings solely for theuse of children are, however,
still few even today. Of those
that do exist probably one of the
most unusual is the International
Youth Library in Munich, Germany,
which is dedicated to the task of
"furthering sincere understanding
among the young generations of
the world through children's and
youth books."
It might well use for its motto
the idea expressed by Jean Coc-
teau, who once said that all adults
must keep something of youth in
their hearts for only in this way
could they hope to understand
their own children. To this the
International Youth Library adds,
"And only if the children of the
world understand one another, can
we hope for a peaceful and undi-
vided world."
The idea of starting the Library
came from Mrs. Jella Lepmann,
who had organized an Inter-
national Youth Book Exhibition
in Germany in 1946-47.
Today, in the building on the
Kaulbachstrasse in Munich, which
was given and repaired by the Ba-
varian Government, there exists a
remarkable collection of the world's
"best youth books". Since 1949,
when the library was opened, this
collection has grown from 8, 000
volumes, coming from 23 countries,
to over 18, 000, representing the
gifts of publishers, official organi-
zations, libraries, schools and indi-
viduals in 35 countries.
What does such a library offer ?
In the first place it serves as a
point of contact for libraries,
schools and children in all parts of
the world, and not only for Ger-
man children and young people,
but also for German schools, li-
brarians, publishers and authors.
Within a year of its opening it
had already been visited by classes
from 40 different schools, and these
included not only Germans, but
Americans, English, French, Scan-
dinavians, Italians and the children
from displaced persons camps.
These refugee children were always
thrilled when they found books in
their native languages there.
Childrcn's paintings
BECAUSE of the accent laid onlanguage teaching in their
schools'curriculum, many
German children are able to read
books in English and French by
the age of 12 and 13. So the
Library organizes special study
groups with the books it posses-
ses... Winnie the Pooh, Ferdinand
the Bull, Pinocchio, Little Nils
Holgerson and the Elephant Babar
become the language teachers of
their nations. And, more impor-
tant still, the children are not
only learning the actual language,
but something about the mentality
of the different countries, about
their way of life and thought.
Another outstanding activity has
been the book discussion groups in
which boys and girls aged from 11
to 17 years take part regularly.
The guidance and evaluation of
these discussions are in the hands
of experienced librarians and other
specialists.
Children's paintings, which speak
an international language, are
another special feature of the
Library's work. The Library open-
ed with an International Exhibi-
tion showing the work of children
in 24 countries, which later toured
many German and other European
cities. Since then many schools
have held monthly exhibitions in
the Library, which has organized
an active children's painting group.
The Library is also doing in-
valuable work in developing a basic
international list of the world's
best books for children and young
people. In this connection it works
with publishers, writers, illustrators
and-most important of all-
with the educators of the new
generation. Specialists in all
these fields-a total of 250 people
from 9 countries,-met at the
Library in 1951 to discuss how
international understanding can be
aided by children's books.
Wo"'d pattcrn
WITH the help of scholarshipand exchange funds which
it is hoped will be estab-
lished by all library associations,
it can offer excellent exchange
possibilities. During 1951, for the
first time since its creation,
foreign guest librarians from
Sweden, England and Switzerland
did practical work in the Munich
Library. Their temporary co-ope-
ration helped it to supplement its
collection from their countries and
the visits enabled the librarians to
study the Library methods and to
consider how these could be applied
in the libraries of their own coun-
tries. This also highlights the
possibilities of using the Interna-
tional Youth Library to develop a
basic pattern for similar centres
throughout the world.
