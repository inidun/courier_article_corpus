Matches
The first version of a match was invented in the year 577 AD by impover¬
ished court ladies during a military siege, in the short-lived Chinese
kingdom of the Northern Qi. Hard-pressed during the siege, they must
have been so short of tinder that they could otherwise not start fires for
cooking or heating.
Early matches were made with sulphur. A description is found in a book
entitled Records of the Unworldly and the Strange written about 950 by
Tao Gu:
"If there occurs an emergency at night it may take some time to make a
light to light a lamp. But an ingenious man devised the system of impreg¬
nating little sticks of pinewood with sulphur and storing them ready for
use. At the slightest touch of fire they burst into flame. One gets a little
flame like an ear of corn. This marvellous thing was formerly called a
'light-bringing slave', but afterwards when it became an article of com¬
merce its name was changed to 'fire inch-stick'."
There is no evidence of matches in Europe before 1530. Matches could
easily have been brought to Europe by one of the Europeans travelling to
China at the time of Marco Polo, since we know for certain that they were
being sold in the street markets of Hangzhou in the year 1270 or there¬
abouts.
