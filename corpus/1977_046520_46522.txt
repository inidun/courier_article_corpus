This 19th-century portrayal of St. George slaying the dragon forms part
of an ensemble of 18th- and 19th- century paintings in the sanctuary
of Ura Kidané Mehret church on the island of Zeghie, in Lake Tana
(Ethiopia). The church's walls are covered with a vast profusion
of paintings depicting some 3,000 biblical figures.



THE PAINTED CHURCHES
OF LAKE TANA

ETHIOPIA, the birthplace of di¬
verse ancient cultures, has had
a continuous existence as a
nation for no less than 2,000 years,
but many aspects of its cultural past
are still obscure. Even quite recently,
Ethiopia's abundant cultural and
artistic achievements since the begin¬
ning of the Christian Era were a closed
book to all but a few specialists.

Slaughter
of the innocents
The church of Rema Medhani
Alem, on the now-uninhabited
island of Rema, is traditionally
thought to have been founded
by a monk, the brother of a king
of Ethiopia. On the walls of the
"maqdas", the square sanctuary
characteristic of Lake Tana's
churches, an unbroken expanse
of paintings narrate the life of
the Virgin Mary, as well as
depicting saints, martyrs and a
dream which revealed to Herod,
slaughterer of the innocents,
his own true nature (left).
The dream (enlarged detail at
right) is a symbolic representation
of Herod as a serpent, symbol of
evil, crushing a mass of human
beings in its coils. The pictures
are executed in the traditional
colours of Ethiopian painting:
yellow, red, green and black.

Crowning
of the Virgin
Another image from the
sanctuary of Rema
Medhani Alem depicts
the coronation of the
Virgin Mary. The two
figures in the lower
frieze, seeming to float
weightlessly in the air,
curiously accentuate
the serene harmony
of the composition above.

Texts in a sacred
language
Illuminated manuscripts from
the 14th and 15th
centuries have been
discovered in the monasteries
of Lake Tana. Many of
these outstandingly
beautiful works are preserved
in two important libraries,
one on Kebran island, the
other on Tana Quircos, which
today contains some 50
manuscripts. Left, an
Ethiopian priest reads one
of the precious manuscripts
written in Ge'ez, the sacred

^ After the Second World War the
art and monuments of this immense
country, situated like a wedge on the
eastern flank of Africa, increasingly
aroused the curiosity of a growing
number of visitors. However, much
of its age-old heritage of architec¬
ture and paintings had seriously deter¬
iorated and the task of preserving it
was all the more difficult since these
cultural treasures were scattered
over a vast area. About ten years
ago the Ethiopian government asked
Unesco for help in saving these pre¬
cious works of art.
In 1968 the Ethiopian government
and Unesco began to work out a pro¬
gramme of preservation and restora¬
tion of sites and monuments along
the "Historic Route". This runs
through Axum (capital of ancient
Abyssinia at the beginning of the
Christian era) to the holy city of
Lalibella with its 13th-century mono¬
lithic churches hewn from the natural
rock, and the city of Gondar, founded
in the 17th century when it became
Ethiopia's capital, finally reaching the
falls of the Blue Nile and Lake Tana.
The "Historic Route" thus in
itself offers a voyage of cultural dis¬
covery through Ethiopia, a country
which was a great African empire
before the Christian era and where
in the 4th century Christianity brought
an element of unity to peoples of dif¬
ferent ethnic origin and cultures. Over
the centuries Ethiopia was exposed
to a wide range of influences, through
its contacts with southern Arabia,
Byzantium and Coptic Egypt, mo¬
nastic Syria, Armenia and Jerusalem,
medieval and Renaissance Europe
and eastern Asia, particularly India.
And yet a totally original art flower¬
ed in Ethiopia, finding expression
in both painting and architecture, the
most outstanding examples of which
are the churches and monasteries of
Lake Tana.
Lake Tana, Ethiopia's biggest lake,
through which flow the waters of the
Upper Blue Nile, is located in the
west of the rugged Ethiopian
highlands, over 1,800 m. above sea
level. The heart-shaped lake (some
80 km long and almost as wide) is
dotted with 38 islands some of
which were for centuries important
centres of art and culture.
The churches of Lake Tana are
circular in form, with a square sanc¬
tuary in the centre. They have doors
corresponding to the cardinal points
of the compass and conical roofs
covered with thatch. Their walls
are covered with paintings stretching
over dozens of square metres. In
the 18th-century monastery of Narga
Selassie paintings embellish an area
of no less than 350 square metres.
The ornamental paintings of Lake
Tana, none of them older than the
1 7th century, have a style, in terms
of composition and colours, that is
quite unique. Their subjects are the
traditional images of Christian icono
graphy, depicting Christ, the Virgin
Mary, the saints, the apostles, the
archangels and the serpent in the
Garden of Eden. Their vivid hues,
geometric forms and haloed faces
with wide staring eyes have an
obvious affinity with the 14th- and
15th-century illuminated manuscripts
in the same Lake Tana monasteries,
to which Unesco devoted an out¬
standing album of colour reproduc¬
tions in 1961 (1).
No less than 3,000 figures from the
scriptures are depicted in one church
on the island of Zeghie. But many
churches of this period contain, in

addition to such vast compositions,
smaller pictures in some cases no
bigger than playing cards, but exe¬
cuted with the same wealth of artistic
virtuosity.
Many of these art treasures are
today in urgent need of restoration.
Water seeps through dilapidated
thatch roofs. The paintings are
fading and in some cases virtually
hanging in rags. In some churches
pigeons are destroying paintings by
pecking to pieces the mud and dung
plaster on which they are mounted.
A systematic inventory of Ethiopian
works of art has still to be completed.
Theft and vandalism are rife in aban¬
doned churches and monasteries
where for two centuries monks
created the outstanding composi¬
tions which make the islands of Lake

Churches and pictures alike must
be restored. Work is being carried
out by the Ethiopian government
through its Organization for Research
and Conservation of the Cultural
Heritage. This body, which is atta¬
ched to the Ministry of Culture, Sport
and Youth, is training young Ethio¬
pian specialists in restoration.
Unesco is providing technical assis¬
tance and the International Centre
for the Study of the Conservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property,
based in Rome, is collaborating on
the restoration of the paintings. This
rescue operation will save the heritage
of centuries of monastic art in
Ethiopia.
