The British novelist Alan Sillitoe once wrote
t h at “ s p o rt is a means of keeping the nat i o n a l
s p i rit alive during a time of so-called peace. I t
prepares the national spirit for the eventuality of
wa r ” .
Some have argued otherwise, maintaining that
s p o rt can be invaluable in bri d ging gaps of intern at i o n a l
u n d e rs t a n d i n g . C e rtainly there can be little doubt
t h at sport tends to bring together athletes of otherwise
hostile nations or communities. D u ring the Cold Wa r ,
ice hockey playe rs of the Soviet Union and the United
S t ates had a sincere affection for each other, d e s p i t e
their fierce ri va l ry on the ri n k .But does sport also bri n g
together the communities to which the sport s m e n
belong or does it rather reinforce longstanding hosti-
lities and ri va l ri e s ?
W h e n e ver there is a cricket mat c h* b e t ween India
and Pa k i s t a n , for example, the fans on both sides fin d
it difficult to separate national pride from an aesthetic
a p p r e c i ation of the game. For these two postcolonial
cousins have fought three wa rs in the fifty ye a rs since
they became free and neighbouring nat i o n s.At the pre-
sent time they fight a shadow war over Kashmir,a ter-
ri t o ry claimed by both. H ow fa r , if at all, do these
deep political hostilities spill over into the cricket fie l d ?
C ri c k e t , a game of British ori gi n , has a passionat e
f o l l owing in both countri e s.With the possible excep-
tion of the cinema, c ricket reaches out to more
people than any other form of entertainment in
the subcontinent. E ve ry match played by the
n ational team is followed by hundreds of millions of
fa n s , and the playe rs themselves have iconic stat u s.

h ave played each other at cricket much less frequently
than they have other countri e s. B e t ween 1961 and
1978 they did not play any matches at all. B e t we e n
1978 and 1989 there were regular exchanges of cri c k e t
t e a m s ,with India and Pakistan each touring the other
c o u n t ry three times. Since 1989 they have chosen to
p l ay against one another only on “ n e u t r a l ”t e rri t o ry —
the Gulf emirate of Sharjah,A u s t r a l i a ,e ven Canada.
F i n a l l y, early this year a tour of India was planned by
the Pakistan cricket team.
The visit was bitterly opposed by the extremist
right-wing politician Bal T h a c k e r ay, whose Shiv Sena
p a rty rules the city of Mumbai,generally considered
the home of Indian cri c k e t .T h a c k e r ay claimed it
would be “ u n p at ri o t i c ” to allow Pakistan to play
c ricket on Indian soil while that country was spon-
s o ring “ t e rr o ri s m ” in Kashmir.The Shiv Sena dug up
the pitch at Delhi, where a Test match was to be
p l aye d , and issued threats that they would phy s i-
cally attack the Pakistani cri c k e t e rs if they came.
Despite this opposition, the tour went ahead.Te s t
matches were played at Chennai in southern India
and in Delhi, with tight security and massive crow d s
in attendance, and without any incident. Pakistan
won in Chennai and India in Delhi.T h e n ,h owe ve r ,
the two teams moved on to Calcutta to play the firs t
m atch of an Asian Test Championship (in which the
third part i c i p ating team is Sri Lanka). In a closely-
fought contest, Pakistan wo n , but only after a
c o n t r ove rsial decision by the umpire had ru l e d
against the brilliant Indian cricketer, Sachin Ten-
d u l k a r.This led to an outpouring of protest from the
c r ow d , the throwing of bottles onto the field and the
suspension of play. The last stages of the mat c h
were played before an empty stadium.
Great expectations
On the field and off it, the cri c k e t e rs of Pa k i s t a n
and India are brought together by a shared lan-
guage (Hindustani) and a shared regional culture.
When they play for a World XI, the Indian and
Pakistani cri c k e t e rs room together.Among the fa n s ,
t o o, the genuine cricket lover appreciates fine bow-
ling or batsmanship by the other side. W h e n e ve r
Pakistan play England,or any other third country,
Indian cricket love rs tend to support Pa k i s t a n .T h u s
when India were knocked out early in the 1992
World Cup, and Pakistan went on to win, m o s t
Indians felt “at least the Cup came to Asia”.
All the same, there is little doubt that when the two
c o u n t ries play against each other, s p o rt is made to carry
the baggage of pat ri o t i s m .P r o fic i e n cy at sport ,e s p e-
cially cri c k e t , is made to stand in for failure in other
s p h e r e s. India and Pakistan are both poor countri e s ,
but victory on the sporting field can, in the minds of
the insecure pat ri o t , make up for that . In the light of
present trends, India and Pakistan have little hope of
joining the league of the wo r l d ’s prosperous nat i o n s.
But they might again be world champions in cri c k e t ,
as India was in 1983 and Pakistan was in 1992.At the
individual level too, each country has produced some
of the wo r l d ’s finest cri c k e t e rs.
In both India and Pa k i s t a n , the cri c k e t e rs themselve s
are made to bear the brunt of an intensified nat i o n a l i s m .
When India won against Pakistan in the quarter fin a l s
of the 1996 World Cup, the defeated team went back
home in fear.The home of their captain,Wasim A k r a m ,
was attacked by angry fa n s.Questions were asked in the
Pakistani Parliament alleging that the loss was delibe-
r at e ,t h at the playe rs had been bribed to lose.The cri c-
k e t e rs had of course tried their best,but on the day the
other team played better.
These feelings are replicated amongst émigr é
communities too. For more than a decade now the
Gulf emirate of Sharjah has hosted a cricket tour-
nament in which both India and Pakistan part i c i p at e .
For the last three years the two countries have also
annually played a series of five matches in Toronto.
It has been well documented that patriotic feelings
are often exaggerated among diasporic communities,
who yearn for their homeland as they do not com-
pletely assimilate in their country of residence. C e r-
tainly the cricket fans in Sharjah and Toronto bear
ample testimony to this.
Sequel of Partition
W h at are the roots of this nationalism? Hindu and
Islamic chauvinists on either side, as well as some
We s t e rn commentat o rs , tend to represent the confli c t
in religious term s. I would stress that its roots are
p ri m a rily terri t o rial rather than religi o u s. A l t h o u g h
Pakistan is an Islamic stat e , India also has a substan-
tial Muslim populat i o n .I n d e e d , some of India’s fin e s t
c ri c k e t e rs have been Muslims, including the present
captain of the national team, Mohammed A z h a-
ru d d i n .The genesis of confli c t , on the cricket field or
e l s e w h e r e , must be explained otherwise.
On the Pakistan side, it is the fact that India is seen
as the huge and sometimes ove r b e a ring Big Bro-
ther of the region, a country that throws its weight
around. On the Indian side, it is the memory that
Pakistan ori gi n ated in a movement for secession,
t h at in the ori ginal vision of Indian nationalism both
lands were to be part of one nat i o n . Independence in
August 1947 also meant Pa rt i t i o n .Through cri c k e t ,
t h e r e f o r e , the smaller nation of Pakistan can hope to
challenge the political weight of India. Indian nat i o-
nalists, for their part, have never completely recon-
ciled themselves to the existence of Pakistan as a sepa-
r ate political entity.They thus tend to see in cri c k e t i n g
v i c t o ry an affirm ation of the illegi t i m a cy of the
demand for breaking up India.
So should there be further cricketing contacts bet-
ween India and Pakistan? Is cricket a means of taming
n ational tensions,or is it rather a way of stoking the fir e s
of aggr e s s i ve nationalism? One cannot,a l a s ,a n swer this
question unambiguously either way.For sport unites bu t
it also divides, and in this case cricket is made to carry
the burden of national expectat i o n . I n e v i t a b l y, t h i s
becomes more intense when Pakistan and India play
one another.A section of the fans cannot forget the poli-
tical animosities, and take a mere game far more
s e riously than they should. n

* C ricket is a game played by
t wo teams of 11 playe rs on a
field with a wicket at either
end of a 22-yard pitch.T h e
object is for one team to score
runs by hitting a ball while the
other tries to dismiss them by
b ow l i n g, c atching or ru n n i n g
them out. E d i t o r
“ S e rious sport 
has nothing to do 
with fair play.
It is bound up with
h at re d ,j e a l o u s y,
b o a s t f u l n e s s,
d i s re ga rd of all ru l e s
and sadistic pleasure 
in witnessing 
v i o l e n c e : in other
wo rds it is war minus
the shooting.”
