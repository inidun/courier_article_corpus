The Year of   
International Court of Justice at The Hague.
Dismissing the appeal eight months later, the
Court upheld the Franco-Portuguese agree-
ment of 1960 and asked both parties to agree
on a border between their respective exclusive
zones.
Guinea Bissau went along with the offer of
b i l ateral talks and eventually accepted the
C o u rt ’s ve r d i c t . In 1995 the two countries set
up a joint body called the Management and Co-
o p e r ation A g e n cy (AG C ) , for the joint deve l o p-
ment of resources located between azimuths
268° and 220°, s t a rting from Cape Roxo on the
land frontier between the two stat e s.
The countries agreed on an equitable share-
out of fishing resources, but not of oil.In accor-
dance with the decision of the International
Court of Justice at The Hague, 85% of oil pro-
fits will go to Senegal and 15% to Guinea
Bissau. If new oil reserves are discovered, the
20-year agreement will be revised accordingly.
Senegal and Guinea Bissau have realized
that they are better off getting along with one
another than prolonging the dispute.The batt-
le of Dôme Flore will not take place. ■

Morocco- European Union
C o - o p e ra t i o n in choppy waters
For the past ten years,the question of fishing
rights has been a stumbling block in rela-
tions between Morocco and the European
Union (EU). With a coastline of nearly 3,500
k i l o m e t r e s , Morocco offers major possibilities
t h at have kindled a keen interest on the part of the
E U. F i ve hundred Spanish vessels fish in Moroc-
c o ’s exclusive economic zone—95% of the
Union’s fishing fleet operating in the area.
Three four-year agreements have been suc-
cessively concluded, largely concerned with
granting the EU fishing rights in Moroccan
waters in exchange for financial compensation.
The first agreement, signed in March 1988,
was brought to a more or less successful
conclusion. The second, signed in May 1992,
was revised midway through before being cut
short. Morocco’s fishing resources were deple-
ted, so that in view of the need to preserve
stocks, the two parties agreed to scuttle the
deal one year before it was due to run out.
Nine months of tough negotiations ensued
before a third agreement was signed in
November 1995, which is still in force. The
accord entitles the EU to new fishing rights off
the Moroccan coast in return for a total of 500
I n t e rn ational Year of the Ocean (IYO ) , which has
been proclaimed by the United Nations for 1998
and for which UNESCO is the lead agency.
I YO activities are designed to achieve three
o b j e c t i ve s : to make people aware that mari n e
resources are not inexhaustible and that the
ocean cannot absorb indefinitely all the pollu-
tion caused by uncontrolled deve l o p m e n t ; t o
p e rsuade gove rnments to gi ve the oceans the
p ri o rity they deserve ; and to develop a more
e f f e c t i ve system of global scientific co-operat i o n
to improve our understanding and management
of marine ecosystems and ocean resources.
EXPO ’98 is the most spectacular of the
wide range of IYO activities, but there are
many others. On IOC’s initiative, an Ocean
Charter has been drawn up.This is not a legal-
ly binding document but a declaration of com-
mitment in which the signatories—governmen-
tal authorities and private bodies—pledge to
initiate and respect co-operative actions to pre-
serve the oceans and coastal areas. UNESCO
is also preparing an ocean education package
and a beach clean-up project. IOC is preparing
an overview of current scientific knowledge,
the first phase of which will be published by the
end of the year. Also in the works are an ency-
clopaedia and an electronic atlas. Many coun-
tries are contributing to IYO, most important-
ly by holding high-level scientific conferences
on ocean-related matters.The calendar and the
themes of these conferences are featured in the
I YO website (http://www. u n e s c o. o r g / i o c / i yo /
iyohome.htm). Research and training cruises
are taking place aboard Russian, Norwegian,
Chinese, Indian, Korean, Indonesian, Cana-
dian, Malaysian and other vessels, which use
their ports of call to draw public attention to
the need for marine conservation. ■
