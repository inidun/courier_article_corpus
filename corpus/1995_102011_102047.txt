Italy : rocks in a hard place
During its chequered
history the ancient
rock-hewn town of
Matera withstood
many waves of
invaders. The
pressures of 20th-
century ! ife proved
harder to cope with...

Pierced into the soft limestone cliffsideof a deep ravine in th  high hills of
southern Italy is a complex of troglodyte
dwellings that has existed for thousands of
years. Known as the Sassi (rocks) of Matera, it
bears traces of human activity dating from as
far back as the Old Stone Age, although it was
not until neolithic times that the site began to
be occupied. At that time the high plateaux of
the Basilicata region in which Matera is situ-
ated were inhabited by semi-nomadic tribes
who found the gravinas or deep canyons
etched into the limestone hills ideal places in
which to halt during their seasonal wander-
ings in search of grazing land.
Stones and time
When man began to use metal tools, it
became easier to dig into the soft stone.
Tombs and underground ritual chambers
with central pillars left after the excavation of
rocky rubble, date from this period. The first
scattered rock dwellings were hewn around
water reservoirs. Water became an object of
worship, for it is rare in this region of
scorching summers and icy winters, where
annual rainfall amounts to no more than 500
millimetres.
In time these early human settlements
began to coalesce into urban centres.
The rugged topography of the region,
with its inaccessible rocks and hidden valleys,
enabled its inhabitants to withstand many
waves of invaders down through the cen-
turies. The Greeks in the eighth century B. C.
were followed by the Romans (fourth and
third centuries B. C.), the Byzantines (fifth
century A. D.), the Lombards (sixth and sev-
enth centuries), the Saracens (ninth century),
the Normans (eleventh century), the Slavs
and the Hungarians (eleventh century) and
finally the Aragonese (fifteenth century). The

aridity of the land helped to strengthen its
people's spirit of independence, and ancient
traditions continued to be observed even as
they were renewed and invigorated by new-
comers.
The region's ancient agricultural and pas-
toral culture provided favourable conditions
for medieval monasticism. Hundreds of
churches, chapels, crypts and rock-hewn
cathedrals adorned with frescoes were hol-
lowed out in Matera. More than monasteries,
caves and caverns became retreats and
refuges for religious bodies which engaged in
experimental attempts to create ideal com-
munities and supported and promoted local
agriculture and the local economy.
Medicinal plants were harvested on the
high plateaux, which were rich in aromatic
shrubs. The caves, where saltpetre, lichens
and moulds could be found, were converted
into storage rooms and laboratories where
miraculous elixirs were produced. According
to one sixteenth-century chronicler, a sub-
stance found in Matera called bolo (an
ochreous clay formed by dissolution of the
limestone) was even dubbed"holy earth"at
the court of the Medicis where it was
observed to have healing properties and to be
an antidote to poison.
An object-lesson in ecological
management
The organization of life in the Sassi was deter-
mined by five factors : the scarcity of
resources, the need to use them collectively,
the interplay between soil and water, and
knowledge of the laws of mechanics and
fluids.
Blending perfectly into its natural setting,
the town of Matera climbs vertically up the
steep sides of its gravina, the location and dis-
tribution of its dwellings determined by the
rocky layers laid bare by the canyon. Two
natural amphitheatres formed by two gullies
known as grabiglioni ("small crevasses")
were subjected to intensive excavation and
terracing. The dispersal and collection of

water runoff via a network of channels, cis-
terns and caves protected the slopes against
the destructive effects of erosion and pre-
served the stability of the terrain.
When it rains, water runs helter-skelter
over the clay surface of the high plateau, cre-
ating ponds and marshes. During dry periods,
the clay cracks and springs dry up. On the
plateau and slopes, which are rich in red, fer-
tile soil (bolo), were woods and fields. The
dwellings with their deep subterranean
chambers were built lower down along the
grabiglioni, blending in with the rocky cliff
face. Grouped into units, they open out onto
terraces and hanging gardens. Each unit forms
a vicinato (neighbourhood), a remarkable
example of community organization.
The dominant architectural forms are
cave-like. The basic element (the lamione) is a
single barrel-vaulted room which may be the
nucleus of a large structural complex. The
terrace outside can be used as a communal
courtyard, and beneath it is a communal cis-
tern used for storing water that runs off roofs
carefully designed for this purpose. Stairways
serving as vertical axes of communication
follow the course of diagonal water run-off
channels. The horizontal drainage system,
used to channel water into the terraced gar-
dens and to fill cisterns deep inside the caves,
provides a framework for paths leading to
the vicinati.
The vertical development of the city in
medieval times integrated earlier construc-
tions, used the law of gravity to facilitate water
distribution and afforded protection against
the wind. Two districts, known as Sasso
Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, grew up around
the two grabiglioni, which provided humus-
rich land for cultivation. In the centre was a
fortified area, the civita. Craftsmen's work-
shops and shops were built on the edge of the
high plateau, where the large cisterns and
rock-hewn grain storage silos were located.

Upsetting the balance
This complex and harmonious urban system,
based on the drainage, control and distribu-
tion of water, survived intact until the eigh-
teenth century. Then, in the nineteenth and
especially the twentieth centuries, the ability
to manage environmental resources in a spirit
of community died out. The modern city of
Matera extends above the run-off slopes to
places where the builders of the old city
never dared to venture. The filling in of
drainage areas for use as roads and the
destruction of the capillary network of water
collection brought to an end time-honoured
constraints that had to be observed in order
to strike a balance between urban develop-
ment and scarce natural resources. The urban
network became denser and reached satura-
tion point. As the dwellings became increas-
ingly tightly packed, the system whereby life
in them was organized began to break down.
Deteriorating hygienic and environmental
conditions in the 1950s led to a decision to
transfer the population of the old town to new
quarters. When the evacuation project from
the Sassi began, 15, 000 people-two-thirds of
Matera's population at the time-were living in
2, 997 dwellings, 1, 641 of which were consid-
ered to be troglodytic. Since then the caves
have remained virtually empty, but for visitors
they document a unique architectonic experi-
ence, the creation over centuries of a remark-
able urban area where people managed natural
resources with great economy and skill, t
