The wealth ofa nation
Facts and figures
Rural development
Agriculture. Despite rapid industrial expan¬
sion in the last few years, agriculture still plays
a vital role in the Brazilian economy, corres¬
ponding to around 14 per cent of Gross
National Product (GNP), 47 per cent of ex¬
ports (including semi-manufactured goods),
and employing 44 per cent of the total work¬
force. Two-thirds of agricultural production
comes from crops, one-quarter from cattle,
and the remainder from forestry.
In spite of extensive modernization in re¬
cent years, agriculture still provides only a low
level of revenue in relation to capital invest¬
ment. Increased production is the result of an
increase in the amount of land under cultiva¬
tion, rather than higher productivity through
the use of machinery, or better quality seed or
fertilizer. Low productivity has always been
due to an excess of labour combined with
outmoded technology, and to restrictive sys¬
tems of land ownership, where the ground is
worked by primitive, often destructive,
methods.
However, Brazil has considerable agri¬
cultural potential: in addition to vast regions
suited to agriculture, there are the advantages
of a varied climate in a country which extends
from the tropics to the temperate zone.
However, only a third of this land is currently
exploited, and of this only a small part is
cultivated.
Agriculture provides for the vast majority
(95 per cent) of the country's food re¬
quirements. In this respect Brazil is practically
self-sufficient, except in the case of wheat.
Besides providing Brazilians with their
basic foodstuffs, agriculture produces an im¬
portant share of the country's export re¬
venues. Sugar, the first foodstuff to be used as
an international currency, is still a valuable
commodity. The main crops in Brazil today
are coffee, maize, soya, cotton, sugar cane,
manioc, rice, citrus and tropical fruits, cocoa
and potatoes. The major exports from the
agricultural sector, other than coffee, are
soya, sugar, maize, tobacco, cotton and fruits,
including fruit juice.
In 1974 Brazil dethroned Cuba as the chief
world producer of sugar, with an output of 6.9
million tonnes. Almost 40 per cent of this was
produced in the Northeast, and 60 per cent in
the Southeast. In 1978, exports amounted to
1.9 million tonnes, valued at $352 million. In
the same year, the export of sugar by-prod¬
ucts stood at 850,000 tonnes of treacle.
Although coffee is no longer the main
strength of the Brazilian export trade, it is still
one of the pillars of the economy and Brazil
remains a major world producer, with a crop of
2,589,343 tonnes in 1979. In that year coffee
exports amounted to 1 1 .2 million sacks (each
sack weighs 60 kg) of green and soluble
coffee.
Just over twenty-five years ago, Brazil did
not produce soya on a commercial scale, and
even in 1965 total production was no more
than 500,000 metric tonnes. In 1975, soya
became the country's most valuable export
and, with an output of 12.6 million tonnes in
1 977, Brazil caught up with China, the second
world producer, and is today competing
seriously with the United States (which pro¬
duces nearly four times as much soya) on
international markets.
Stockbreeding. Stockbreeding, and espe¬
cially cattle-rearing, is an important factor
affecting land distribution in Brazil. With 1 00
million head in 1978, the country ranks fourth
among the world's cattle-producing countries,
after India, the United States and the Soviet
Union.
Landdistribution. More than half of Brazilian
farms are minifundia (holdings of less than 1 0
hectares), and less than 1 per cent are latifun¬
dia (estates of over 1,000 hectares). Gener¬
ally speaking, minifundia are more common in
the Northeast and in the southern colonial
zones, while latifundia are found throughout
Amazonia and in the Centre West. In terms of
area, the latifundia are by far the most signifi¬
cant. The minifundia only occupy 3.1 per cent
of all arable land, while the latifundia, although
representing less than 1 per cent of all hold¬
ings, occupy 37 per cent of the land.
Fisheries. Fishing has become an important
industry in Brazil. Crabs, prawns, crayfish, all
kinds of crustaceans, sardines, turtles, mol¬
luscs and other aquatic animals abound in
Brazilian waters. The coast can be divided
into two sections: the Northeast, where fish
and shellfish of very high commercial value
are found; and the South, where shoals of
more ordinary fish are common. Abundant
quantities of crayfish are found in the North¬
east, on the coast of Pernambuco and Para-
iba. The fishermen use the jangada, a balsa-
wood raft equipped with a small triangular sail
and an oar serving as a rudimentary tiller, to
hunt for fish on the open sea. The South has
motorized fleets for tuna and whale fishing.
The pirarucu, or freshwater cod, specimens of
which can weigh up to 250 kg, and which is the
normal diet of river-dwellers, is found in the
interior, in the States of Para and Amazonas.
In 1979 the total fish catch amounted to
977,000 tonnes. ^

Industry
Säo Paulo then and now
A Brazilian who lived in Säo Paulo around
1850 would not recognize the city as it is
today. The two illustrations above show
the striking contrast between then and
now. Top, View of the City of Säo Paulo, an
oil painting executed by the German artist
Eduard Hildebrandt In 1844. Above, the
city as It is today, with its forest of sky¬
scrapers. The figures which chart this
urban explosion are just as dramatic. In
1850 Säo Paulo was a town ofsome 25,000
inhabitants, and by 1890 its population
was still less than 100,000. The situation
began to change dramatically In the first
decades of the 20th century with rising
coffee production. Immigration from else¬
where in Brazil and from other countries
first from Italy, Spain and Portugal, then
after the Second World War from Ger¬
many, Poland, Hungary and Japan
reached such proportions that by 1950 the
city's population was more than 2 million.
During the next three decades the popula¬
tion grew even faster, rising from 8.1 mil
lion inhabitants in 1970 to 15.9 million in
1985 (figures for greater Säo Paulo).
According to United Nations projections,
by the year2000 this Brazilian megalopolis
will be the world's second biggest city,
with 24 million inhabitants, just after Mex¬
ico City (26.3 million). Intensive indus¬
trialization has accompanied rampant
urbanization, and today Säo Paulo is Latin
America's leading industrial centre. The
Säo Paulo "explosion" has caused econo¬
mic, socialand human problems on a mas¬
sive scale. Its ecological consequences
have been particularly serious and have
been aggravated by the economic crisis of
recent years. In collaboration with the
Brazilian Government, Unesco's Man and
the Biosphere (MAB) programme
embarked in 1985 on a project called "Eco¬
logical Studies of the Urban System ofSäo
Paulo", which will be carried out in tandem
with another project for the training of
specialists in urban ecology relating to the
whole of Latin America.
Since the end of the Second World War,
industry has been the most dynamic sector of
the Brazilian economy (31.1 per cent of GNP
in 1978). Industrial expansion in Brazil in the
last thirty years has been remarkable by any
standards.
Mining. Iron ore deposits rank second in the
world, and bauxite deposits probably first.
Also abundant are lime, beryls, rock crystal,
gypsum, ilmenite, magnesite, manganese,
phosphates, rare elements such as thorium,
niobium, zirconium and uranium, as well as
extensive recently discovered deposits of tin,
nickel and copper. Brazil's hydroelectric
potential sets it among the four world leaders,
and its forests constitute one-tenth of the
world total. In addition, Brazil supplies 90 per
cent of the world supply of aquamarine, topaz,
tourmaline and amethyst.
However, despite its immense size, Brazil
does not possess everything it needs. Pet¬
roleum deposits found to date are insignifi¬
cant, and Brazil currently has to import almost
80 per cent of her oil requirements, making a
serious inroad on currency reserves. Coal is
not very plentiful, and of poor quality, although
the discovery of 1 7,600 million tonnes of good
coking coal in the Rio Grande do Sul should
help to reduce imports.
Brazil has been one of the world's leading
diamond suppliers ever since colonial times.
The most important diamond-producing dis¬
tricts are in the north of the State of Minas
Gerais, along the Rio das Garças and the
Araguaia river, in the State of Mato Grosso
and of Goiás, and the island of Marajó, in the
north of Para State.
Despite Brazil's rich mineral potential, the
mining industry still only accounts for a frac¬
tion of the country's trade. In 1978, for exam¬
ple, total Brazilian mineral exports, including
unrefined petroleum and natural gas,
amounted to $1 ,095 million, or 8.6 per cent of
total exports.
Hydroelectric power. Between 1964 and
1 978 Brazil's electric capacity almost quadru¬
pled, from 6,800 MW to almost 25,400 MW,
reaching an estimated 30,000 MW in 1980.
Thirteen large hydroelectric power stations
are being built. They include the Itaipú project
on the Paraná river, which with a capacity of
12,600 MW, will be the world's biggest, and
will supply a fifth of all Brazil's electricity
needs.
Forestry. Almost two-thirds of Brazil is co¬
vered with forest, which can be divided into
three main zones according to the types of
timber they produce. Three-quarters of build¬
ing wood is found in the Amazon region,
where there are 400 varieties of valuable com¬
mercial timber. Hardwoods also predominate
along the Atlantic coast, and only the southern
States Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio
Grande do Sul produce the softwoods
known by the name of Paraná pine.
Alcoholas fuel. To offset her low oil produc¬
tion, Brazil has embarked on a programme to
increase production of fuel and industrial by¬
products. In 1974 an Ethanol Technology
Programme was launched, using raw mate¬
rials such as sugar cane, manioc, saccharin
sorghum, wood, babassu and sweet potato.
The aim was to create and develop the tech¬
nology to produce ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, in
order to replace oil-based fuels. The program¬
me was the first step in the creation in 1 975 of
the National Alcohol Programme (Proalcool),
which had the objective of producing 10,500
million litres of anhydrous or hydrous alcohol
44

by 1985 to satisfy the needs of 1,700,000
vehicles, manufactured in Brazil and adapted
to this new method of combustion.
Iron andsteel. Brazil produces more iron and
steel than any other country in Latin America
and ranks thirteenth in the world.
Motor industry. Brazil is the world's eighth
largest vehicle manufacturer. This relatively
new industry is now the fifth most important in
Brazil, employing 215,000 people. Two-thirds
of the motor industry is owned by foreign
firms. Among those who have investments in
Brazil are Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz,
General Motors, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo,
Toyota and Fiat. Almost all these firms, like
the two Brazilian makes of Puma and Lafer,
are situated near or in Sao Paulo.
The petrochemical industry, Brazil's
newest, already ranks tenth in the world and
employs 9 per cent of the country's industrial
workforce. Petrochemical plants are concen¬
trated in two regions, Säo Paulo and Bahia,
but a third centre is under development in the
State of Rio Grande do Sul.
Shipbuilding. After developing with aston¬
ishing speed since 1 958, Brazil's shipbuilding
industry now dominates Latin America. In
1 959 the industry only employed 1 ,000 work¬
ers, by 1980 it employed 180,000, and this
figure is bound to rise as expansion plans are
implemented. Brazilian shipyards delivered
around 801,230 million net tonnes of new
ships in 1980, compared with 319,720 tonnes
in 1974.
Textiles. Since 1964, the Government has
been engaged in a programme to re-equip the
textile industry and provide technical training.
Productivity has risen and the Brazilian textile
industry, concentrated in the Southeast, the
South and the Northeast, today ranks tenth in
the world. The main producer and exporter is
the State of Säo Paulo, with 2,700 mills and an
active workforce of 1 78,000 people.
Food. Heavy investments are being made in
the canned food industry, in which citrus fruits
constitute a particularly important commodity.
Other canned goods include tomatoes,
peaches, peas, palm kernels, maize, green
peppers, quinces and guava. Two canning
factories at Sao Paulo and at Pernambuco
account for 70 per cent of production, most of
which is consumed by the domestic market,
although an increasingly large proportion is
now being exported. Soluble coffee is es¬
pecially profitable. Although a relatively new
industry in Brazil, 348 million dollars' worth of
soluble coffee was exported in 1978. The
biggest factory in the world producing this
type of coffee is in the heart of the coffee-
growing region, at Londrina in the State of
Paraná.
Other industries. Other important sectors of
the Brazilian economy are the electrical and
electronics industries, cement and tobacco.
Import-export. The United States was for
many years Brazil's biggest export market,
but since 1969 the European Economic Com¬
munity (EEC) has held first place. Together
these two markets have absorbed more than
half of Brazil's exports. The United States has
always been Brazil's main supplier, but in
1973 and 1974 the EEC was a source of
imports almost equal in value to those from
the United States. Figures for 1978 showed
that the United States accounted for 22.4 per
cent of Brazil's export business, and 20.9 per
cent of its imports.
