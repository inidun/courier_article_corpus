Since the Soviet collapse, the demand for
Russian courses in Bulgarian schools has
plummeted, leaving many teachers jobless
Bulgaria’s overdose
of Russian profs
In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin wa l l
and communist regi m e s ,B u l g a rians could hardly
i m a gine what lay round the corn e r. A p a rt from
the need for economic reform , they had to face swe e-
ping changes in ways of thinking and learn i n g .“ We
had to rewrite all our textbooks, from pri m a ry school
to unive rsity leve l ,” s ays a history teacher at the uni-
ve rsity of Sofia .The first thing to be done was to
purge the national education system of the dead
weight of ideology and of compulsory Russian classes.
The history of Russian language teaching in Bul-
g a ria goes back to 1878, when the Czar’s arm i e s
freed the country from the Ottoman yo k e .As a token
of gr atitude to the “ l i b e r ating brothers ” from Russia,
it was decided that Russian would be taught in secon-
d a ry schools. Under the communist regi m e , R u s-
sian became compulsory in pri m a ry schools, a n d
was even taught in kindergart e n s.By the late 1980s,
c o u rses were being taught entirely in Russian in
t wenty secondary schools, and Bulgaria had 4,000
Russian teachers.
In 1992, the wind of democratic reform swe p t
through the education system. Marxism and com-
p u l s o ry Russian disappeared from
c u rri c u l a .But the decision was taken
without much thought for the conse-
q u e n c e s , especially for teachers.
School number 133 in Sofia,
where 1,300 students start learn i n g
Russian in the first year of the pri-
m a ry leve l , is the only holdover from
the old system. It receives so many
requests for admission that only one
in four applicants can be enrolled.“ We have sixteen
Russian teachers , but many colleagues had to be
r e t r a i n e d . I know of quite a few who went back to uni-
ve rsity to learn English or to become pri m a ry school
t e a c h e rs. O t h e rs left to sell books on the sidewa l k ,”
explains the pri n c i p a l ,L y u b ov Micheva .
Two thousand Russian teachers found them-
s e l ves without a job after the reform , s ays Letelina
K ru m ova ,a specialist on the issue at the ministry of
e d u c at i o n . In 1993 she started a programme to
retrain “ h i g h - risk gr o u p s ” , including jobless Rus-
sian teachers. “But the amount of money required
t u rned out to be exorbitant, so we soon gave up on
the idea and asked the people concerned to manage
on their ow n ,” s ays Kru m ova . At the unive rsity of
S o fia ,a sound two - year cur-
riculum has neve rt h e l e s s
helped many of them earn
an English teaching degr e e .
One expert say s ,“in the end
it was the right choice,
because nowa d ays the Rus-
sian-English combinat i o n
is one of the most highly sought-after.”
T h at was then. Four ye a rs ago the Bulgari a n
Socialist party was voted back into power and the
retraining courses were abolished.The succeeding
g ove rn m e n t , which has been in power for a ye a r ,i s
h aving a hard time managing a cumbersome legacy.
Hostages to the education system reform ,w h i c h
itself has been buffeted by political squabbles and
c h a n ging gove rn m e n t s ,m a ny teachers have left tea-
ching altogether for business careers.
S vetla Djivreteva has started raising silkwo rm s.
“It wa s n ’t exactly my calling in life,” she say s ,“ but I
had to make a living somehow.”A gr a d u ate of the uni-
ve rsity of Veliko Ta rn ovo near her home village of
D r a g a n ovo in Bulgari a ’s heart l a n d , she started out
studying to be a Russian teacher. B u t
by the time she finished the reform s
had been implemented. S vetla deci-
ded to follow her husband to Ruse, a
t own near the nort h e rn border,but fa i-
led to find a job there. “I had to teach
B u l g a rian literature in a village twe n t y -
five kilometres from home,” she say s.“ I
got up at five - t h i rty in the morning to
c atch the bu s. In winter there wa s n ’t
a ny wood to heat the school and the children tried to
w rite with their gloves on.”
After a ye a r ,S vetla was sacked and replaced by
a friend of the pri n c i p a l . She moved back into her
p a r e n t s ’home near her alma mat e r , where she enrol-
led on a pri m a ry school teacher training cours e .W i t h
her new diploma in her pocket, she is currently unem-
p l oyed but has her eye on a job in the village school.
In the meantime, S vetla surv i ves by going each
month to the nearby silk mill where she is gi ven a large
jar of silkwo rm s.This thankless job brings in 100,000
l e va (slightly over $50) a month. She wants to go
back to teaching, but in the meantime all she can do
is wait and raise wo rm s. ■
