THE WORLD OF
PREHISTORIC
by Nino Frank
To think in terms, of geography
is to think in terms of the
universe, someone has said.
In our day, when we are ever
more oriented to thinking in
world terms, the teaching of geogra¬
phy has become a matter of major
concern. It is not »that scientific study
and school teaching are to be con¬
fused, nor should we attempt to make
every schoolchild into an infant geo¬
grapher. But geography, treated as
a genuine study of the world, can be
used more effectively than other
subjects as a means of laying the
foundations of International under¬
standing.
A glance at the school curricula
of most countries, however, shows
that the subject of geography is
almost invariably cut to the minimum
and treated as an adjunct to his¬
tory. One hour a week is usually all
the time allotted to it, and indeed in
some schools (North America, Aus¬
tralia and Japan) it is often merely
combined with social studies or the
study of family and community life.
Yet, great new perspectives are
now open to the student of geo¬
graphy through television and
films. Aerial photographs taken
from helicopters and more recently
from artificial satellites have brought
"the whole world within reach".
Teachers of geography are now better
equipped than ever before to bring
their subject to life and to broaden
the horizons of their pupils.
Let us take only one area of new
geographic knowledge, the study of
prehistoric times. Now, as never
before, it is possible to describe the
life of prehistoric men who lived far
back in the mists of time. Only a
few years ago they were shadowy
figures compounded of legend and
guess work, but we now know so
much about their lives, surroundings
and migrations that we are able to
form a precise picture of them.
Historians and geographers now
have all kinds of research techniques
at their disposal which give them
reliable evidence on which to base
their studies of prehistory. These
are made up of a combination of
facts about climatic cycles, the evo¬
lution of animal species and of man,
as well as his cultural development.
Stratigraphy, or the study of soils,
pollen analysis and palaeonto¬
logy are all used to reconstruct
a picture of the past. Dating
has long been possible through the
study of tree rings (dendrology to
the specialist) such as the basic
research work first carried out with
the centuries-old Sequoias of Cali¬
fornia. Another method of dating
is the time-scaling of the gradual
retreat of the great Scandinavian ice
sheet since the end of the last ice-
age. But dating by these means has
never been precise enough.
During the last twelve years or so,
it has been possible to devise a more
accurate method by measuring the
radio-activity of certain elements
contained in the soil. This method is
based on the properties of carbon-14,
an isotope of carbon which develops
in every living thing when exposed
to the effects of cosmic rays and, on
its death, enters on a cycle of disin¬
tegration.
All that is needed in this process
is to discover a site where well-pre¬
served carbon is in evidence (wood
charcoal from a hearth, or carbonized
bone) and the state of disintegration
provides the clue to the precise age
of the material. This has made it
possible to reconsider the whole
subject of prehistory and to revise
estimates of the geographical areas
inhabited by man in earliest times.
A new branch of geography has

only just come into being which
estimates and describes the inhabited
regions of prehistoric times. Today,
800,000 years and perhaps even a
million years after early man first
began to grope his way across the
globe, science has found a way to
reconstitute the geographical world
our ancestors knew.
Professor L.R. Nougier of the Uni¬
versity of Toulouse, and director
of the French Institute of Pre¬
historic Art, has published what
appears to be the first survey of Hu¬
man Geography in Prehistoric Times
(1). The book, well-illustrated with
maps and drawings, records the
achievements of geographers and
scientists in many fields, from which
the author is able to date, list and
describe the peoples and cultures of
prehistoric times with more than a
hypothetical degree of accuracy.
His method is based on the num¬
ber, character and location of palae-
ontological deposits, aerial surveys,
the use of radio-activity for dating
and other new scientific research
methods.

Aerial photographs shed new light on the study of prehistoric limes. Photo abovo
is a striking example, showing the alignment of huge stones, 982 In number, set
up by a megalithic civilization many thousands of years ago near Carnac, Franco.
Using this approach, Professor Nou-
gier presents a veritable geographical
panorama of life in Western Europe
(France, in particular) from Palaeoli¬
thic times down to the "Neolithic
Revolution". During the period of
time he covers, the configuration of
the continent remained virtually the
same as we know it now.
Professor Nougier takes us back to
the first food gatherers who used
chipped-stone axes and flake-tools
and did not reach the peak of their
development until the advent of
hunting some forty thousand years
ago. In the time of these earliest
food gatherers, it is roughly estimated
that there were not more than
20,000 inhabitants in the whole of
lower Palaeolithic Gaul.
It was a time when the area around
what is now Paris was the ha¬
bitat of rhinoceroses and elephas
antiquus, where wild fig and Judas
trees grew in abundance. Men used
natural caves for shelter, and fed as
they could on the meat of sick or
wounded game. This was the ecu-
mene of the last glacial period before
the time of Neanderthal man.
After the food gatherers came the
hunters of the carved and painted
caves of the Upper Palaeolithic age.
They invented a magic art of extra¬
ordinary poetic power, only to forget
it later for a reason which remains
one of the unsolved riddles of pre¬
history. Their period ranged from
30,000 years to 8,500 years before the
first Christian era. During that time
the population of the whole of France
was not more than 50,000 inhabitants
according to Professor Nougier.
The nomadic tendency of early
prehistoric men gradually gave
way to settlement in fixed and
densely populated areas. It was
in that way that the prosperity of the
valley of the Lolng, an important
route to the north, came about.
Countless palaeontological remains
have been found there. The valley
leads directly to the Paris region.
Although Paris recently celebrated
her two thousandth birthday, there
is evidence that settlement of the
region dates back centuries before
that time. Traces of past cultures
have been found in the region, parti¬
cularly at the confluence of the Seine
and the Bièvre where there was once
a rocky spur, dating back to the mists
of antiquity.
Somewhere between ten and twen¬
ty thousand years B.C., the first of
the new men arrived, bringing with
them their marvellous secrets agri¬
culture, domesticated animals, per¬
haps even the knowledge of how to
construct megalithic monuments.
This period a forerunner of the
"Neolithic Revolution"was first her¬
alded by the gatherers of shell fish
and wild berries, and later by men
who set out to conquer the mighty
forests.
Thus the earliest forest farming
civilizations were born, developing
their particular round huts and their
herds of cattle somewhere about
8,500 B.C., and marking the dawn of
the Neolithic age (this occurred
much later in the West than in the
Middle East and North Africa).
Between 3,000 B.C., and 2,000 B.C.,
came the thousand-year era of
the Neolithicthe great "Neo¬
lithic Explosion" which saw an
amazing Increase in human popula¬
tion not only in France but in all of
the inhabited regions of the globe.

millennium, Increased in the course
of ten centuries to five millions.
This twentyfold increase was made
possible by man's changed attitude
towards nature, by abandoning his
mere parasitic existence for the sys¬
tematic exploitation of the earth's
resources. Professor Nougier esti¬
mates that, at this time, the total
population of the Inhabited world
was around 200 millions. Such an
amazing increase was not to occur
again for at least five or six thousand
years, that is, the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution.
Geography really began when
prehistoric man first asked the ques¬
tion "Where?" Where is such and
such a river. Where Is the large
uninhabited cave? Where is the
reindeer's plateau? This need of
some graphic representation of a
place, however rudimentary, was the
first step in developing geography.
Of course, primitive man's know¬
ledge of geography was confined
to a few rudimentary notions of
topography and to an area of a
few square miles. This was still the
time of wandering peoples with their
fabulous tales, and he could not yet
know the immensity of the terra in¬
cognita which his children would
inherit.
The earliest signs of geographical
Interest so far discovered are the
petroglyphs, or rock carvings, found
both in Brittany and in Scandinavia.
They indicate that even men of the
Bronze age had been wondering about
the particular region in which they
lived. Neither the Sumerlans nor the
Hittites who came later left any
evidence of geographical curiosity,
but we do know that the Pharaohs
of the Middle Kingdom had made a
cadastral survey of all the lands and
plots of land under their rule.
It was inevitable that having begun
by placing things, man sooner or
later would wonder just why things
were as they were. So it was that
having started to explore the earth,
men began starting to explain it.
In effect, the term "geographical"
applies to any fact that answers the
double question "Where?" and "Why
there?".
All geography from the time of the
Ionians and Pythagoreans to that of
Henry the Navigator, Mercator and
Varenius, swings back and forth be¬
tween empirical investigation and
learning confined to measuring and
listing. It Is as if man was, and
still were, the lord of a manor not
yet well known, and In which he re¬
mained a stranger.
It was not until the eighteenth
century, thanks to contributions made
by such other sciences as botany,
zoology and geology that the geogra¬
pher's awareness broadened. Kant
first regarded the relationship bet¬
ween man and nature as an essential
part of geography. After him came
Ritter and Humboldt who proclaimed
the principle of the interdependence
of all natural phenomena, of which
man is merely one.
This planet approach to geogra¬
phy, exemplified by the "human geo¬
graphy" of P. Vidal de La Blache and
his followers, involves constant refe¬
rence to other branches of science.
"Geography, as the meeting-place of
the physical sciences and the huma¬
nities", writes Professor R. Clozier,
"calls into play a wide variety of
concepts. These can be broken down
into facts and if taken singly or in
isolation belong to other sciences.
But geography puts them back into
place in the natural scheme of
things."
The question "Why there?" has
become paramount. Its influence is
particularly apparent in one of the
most active fields of geographical
research, world monographs, and
cross-sectional studies of some iso¬
lated factors such as "man and
forest", "honey cultures", and the
"geography of stock-breeding". One
geographer, Josué de Castro, has em¬
barked on a "Geography of Hunger"
which a colleague describes as "even
more important than a geography of
shelter." And what better name to
give the detailed research on arid
zones now being carried out at
Unesco's instance than a contribution
to the "geography of thirst".
Another study of great importance
today is oceanography. It is
true that we know less about
the seas than we do about the
moon. With men of the future ever
more in need of extra food supplies,
food from the ocean depths (as well
as zones no longer arid) will be in
great need. But though one result of
océanographie research may provide
much needed food for future genera¬
tions the geographers will be bound
to reap the first benefits.
A number of congresses on broad
geographical themes were held last
year in the Scandinavian countries
at Copenhagen, Helsinki, and Stock¬
holm. These meetings, on the ini¬
tiative of Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Geographical Union, discussed
oceanographical, geodesic and geo¬
physical research. Useful results
have been achieved. Special mention
should be made of the work done by
the Commission on Geography
Teaching in Schools at the Geogra¬
phic Union Congress in Stockholm
for improving the teaching of this
subject as the basis for a new type
of humanism.
The thousand million years or
more which have passed in the
history of our planet since the
first forms of life made their
appearance seem to us so astro¬
nomical and overwhelming that
to distinguish eras and dates is
almost impossible. We, who
think in hours, days and months,
need a convenient yardstick.
Professor Louis-René Nougier in
his book "Human Geography in
Prehistoric Times" has provided
one (below) by condensing the
history of life into one year. THE
UNESCO COURIER'S graphic re¬
presentation of this condensation
is shown on the opposite page.
"Man is a late arrival in the world's
long biological development, though
his existence extends over thou¬
sands of years. We can show this
by a simple transposition of the
scale of time. Let us suppose that
the major events of the biological
evolution on our planet were con¬
densed into a single calendar year
and that January 1 represents the
first appearance of life in the world.
We must wait until the end of July
to find the first marine vertebrates.
The great reptiles and first mam¬
mals do not appear until the second
half of October. December 13 marks
the beginning of the Tertiary Age
with the first ape-like creatures.
Not until 2 p.m. on December 31 do
we enter the Quaternary Age, the
last of the vast geological periods in
which man appears. At 5.30 p.m.
the pre-hominids (Pithecanthropes
and Sinanthropes) arrive, but the
first vestiges of " homo sapiens "
are still to come. Swanscombe Man
and Fontéchevado Man enter the
scene about 8 or 9 p.m., and the
many traces of the Neanderthal
Race appear about 11.40 p.m.
"It is not until ten minutes to
midnight that homo sapiens defi¬
nitely comes on to the stage... Now
we must count only in seconds.
The Neolithic Revolution explodes
in the West at six minutes to twelve,
15 seconds. The Bronze Age begins
at one minute to twelve when record¬
ed history is barely a few seconds
old, and somewhere in the Orient
man has invented writing. At just
fifteen seconds before midnight the
Princess of Vix is buried at the foot
of Mount Lassois with her enormous
funeral chariot. At midnight our
condensed year ends. And, in 2000
A.D., forty years from now, we will
have spent only one full minute of
the new year on this reduced scale."
