In Hong Koitg,
one of the world's big
cities with
3,800,000 inhabitants,
shortage of
water has long
been a problem.
In 1963 a fleet of
water tankers
was needed to bring
12 million gallons daily to
the drought-stricken
city. Since
then large scale
reservoir construction has
improved the situation.

HONG KONG
A THIRSTY CITY
by W. H. Owens
ITIES all over the world,
faced with huge popul¬
ation Increases that are expected to
double the rate of water consumption
within the next 20 years, are now
much concerned with the expansion
of their water supplies. Man's fast
growing demand for more water
everywhere, and the consequent need
to develop new sources of supply, is
the reason behind the International
Hydrological Decade, a world-wide
ten-year programme of scientific re¬
search launched by Unesco last year.
Many cities, of course, are fortunate
in being able to draw on virtually
unlimited sources of water from major
rivers or abundant underground
springs close at hand. But for many
others, situated in drought areas, it
means the construction and main¬
tenance of costly pipeline and conduit
systems to bring water across desert
or parched bush country from the
distant rivers and lakes. For all cities,
however, there must be increasing
expenditure on larger storage re¬
servoirs, more pumping and purifica¬
tion plants, and the wider extension
of water distribution mains to new
housing and industrial estates on city
outskirts.
Water is a most precious commodity
to the 3,800,000 people who live in
Hong Kong, the small, densely popul¬
ated island city and mainland territory
off the south coast of mainland China.
Shortage of water has been a perennial
problem there from the early days of
the trading port to its present status
as a highly industrialized centre of the
Far East, which lives by selling
manufactured goods all over the world.
It Is ironical that the great economic
and social advancement in Hong Kong
of recent years has made the water
supply problem much more acute.
Since the first reservoir was built
about a century ago, Hong Kong's
water storage capacity has been
vastly Increased. But the population
grows so fast that before one new
reservoir is completed, another and
larger one is required. With no major
rivers or large lakes within the
territory, its water supply depends
mainly on the annual rainfall, three-
quarters of which falls during the
monsoon season between May and
September.
This rainfall is by no means depend¬
able, however, and all too often the
monsoon period has passed with in
sufficient water stored, so that
additional restrictions on its use have
had to be imposed through the long
winter months. Indeed, over the past
thirty years it has only rarely been
possible to provide a constant
domestic water supply in Hong Kong.
Every available space suitable to
catch rainwater on the main island
has been turned into a reservoir. So
Hong Kong's biggest water storage
scheme so far the gigantic Shek Pik
reservoir completed in 1963 had to
be built on the smaller outlying island
of Lantau, from which the water is

30,000 million gallons
of fresh water by 1968
brought to the city through a sea-bed
pipeline eight miles long.
The Shek Pik reservoir lay empty
for many months, however, because
the 1963 rains failed and Hong Kong
suffered one of the worst droughts
ever. For the third time in the
territory's history, water had to be
brought from mainland China by tanker
vessels. At great expense, because
drastic action was needed, the Hong
Kong Government chartered a fleet of
water-carrying tankers which brought
some 12 million gallons daily to the
drought-stricken city from the Pearl
River.
During the year the tanker shuttle
service made a total of 1,371 round
trips, bringing 4,228 million gallons
or almost one-third of the whole water
consumption during the period. Even
so, for more than twelve months the
city was strictly rationed to only four
hours of water supply every fourth
day.
Then, when the rains finally came,
in May 1964, there were typhoons of
great violence, and on a single day
no less than eleven and a half inches
of rain fell. As water poured into the
reservoirs, supply restrictions were
eased to every other day. But while
the heavy rains relieved one great
anxiety, the typhoons caused very
extensive damage and loss of homes
costing several hundreds of lives be¬
fore their fury was spent.
While the drought was at its height,
Hong Kong celebrated the completion
of the Shek Pik water scheme one
of the most advanced in South-East
Asiawhich cost £15 million ($42 mil¬
lion) to construct. The vast reservoir
can hold 5,400 million gallons of water,
bringing the territory's total storage
capacity to almost 16,000 million
gallons. In other words, it has
increased Hong Kong's available
water by about 50 per cent. Mile upon
mile of catchment channels surround
the Shek Pik reservoir to ensure that
the maximum amount of rain is
collected, and the drainage area
extends across more than 8,000 acres.
The Shek Pik Water Scheme was
something much more than a remark¬
able and complex feat of engineering.
It has changed the social and
economic standards of the people of
Lantau Island, where the primitive
way of life and barren landscape had
remained unchanged for centuries. It
has brought the villagers new homes,
schools, medical clinics, communic¬
ations and public utilities, including a
piped water supply.
Two small villages Shek Pik itself
with 200 inhabitants, and Fan Pui with
62 inhabitants lay in the way of the
new dam. The Shek Pik villagers
elected to move into new shops and
apartments at Tsuen Wan on the
mainland. But those of Fan Pui, who
wished to stay in the area, were
provided with a completely new
village with modern amenities just a
few miles away from the old and
primitive one.
Vast as the Shek Pik scheme is, it
is still not adequate to meet the long

term future water needs of Hong
Kong. Engineers are therefore already
engaged on what is by far the largest
and most ambitious water storage
project yet attempted. At Plover Cove,
in the New Territories on the mainland,
a sea inlet of the coast is being
enclosed by a main dam, one and a
half miles long, and two subsidiary
dams. When these are completed, the
trapped sea water will be pumped out
and the inlet converted into a fresh¬
water lake.
By 1968 Plover Cove will, be ready
to hold 30,000 million gallons of
water five or six times as much as
the Shek Pik reservoir. Moreover, by
heightening the enclosing dam at a
later stage, its capacity can be
increased to 40,000 million gallons, a
figure which makes interesting com¬
parison with the 16,000 million gallons
total storage capacity of Hong Kong's
present fifteen reservoirs.
When the Plover Cove scheme is
fully completed, it will take the form
of a circle of tunnels 25 miles long
round the edge of Tolo Harbour, with
a connecting sea bed pipeline across
the entrance. Water from streams
overhead will be diverted into the
tunnels by a series of drop shafts
and branch tunnels. By means of a
complex system of weirs, gates and
pumping stations, the water can be
passed in two directions, either to a
treatment works feeding new service
reservoirs for the city or, during
floods, to a large storage reservoir at
Plover Cove.
For some years the governments of
Hong Kong and mainland China have
had an agreement by which Hong Kong
has drawn water from the Sham Chun
reservoir in Kwangtung Province just
over the border. This supply proved
unreliable, especially at times when
Kwangtung itself suffered drought. So
in 1964 a new agreement was made
under which Hong Kong buys a
guaranteed 15,000 million gallons a
year from the East River. This is
brought south into the territory from
mainland China by overland pipeline.
With this Chinese supply and her
own gigantic reservoir schemes
together with further projects which
are still in the planning stage the
long standing water shortage in Hong
Kong should be overcome within the
next decade and all future water
supply requirements in the territory
assured.
