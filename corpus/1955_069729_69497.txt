HAPPY NEW YEAR
IN BALI
The gifts to the gods
a re eaten by mortals
Each year in Bali lasts only
2 1 0 days. The date of the
" Galungan ", or Balinese New
Year, thus changes annually.
The festivities are spread out
over a ten-day period during
which it is believed that the
departed ancestors return to
earth to receive offerings and
bring happiness. Before the
festivities, houses and temples
are freshly decorated and the
offerings carefully prepared.
Many of these "constructions"
are more than six feet tall
and are made of straw, inter¬
laced with yellow, red or
white rice and ornamented
with frangipani flowers and
palm fronds (See cover photo
and photo No. I on this page).

ficient animal dear to the
hearts of all Balinese, makes
its appearance (2). This dra¬
gon-like animal is'manceuvered
by two dancers who weave
their way along the island
paths. The leaps and capers
of the Barong delight old and
young alike, the more so as they
symbolize the fight between
the forces of good and evil.
Work in preparing the ancestor
offerings lasts more than two
weeks. Once ready they are
taken to the temple (4) where

pigs are killed, cut into small pieces and, after being heavily spiced,
impaled on sticks. A different fate awaits the suckling pigs which
are first of all roasted on a spit. The meat is chopped up and
mixed with fresh blood spiced and flavoured with edible flowers.

Preceded by the women carrying
multi-coloured offerings Balinese
men follow in procession with large
bamboo platforms on their shoul¬
ders, on which are carefully-built
scale model houses representing
the dwellings of their ancestors

the Galgungan festivities, ancient
custom requires the Balinese to
carry these model houses to cer¬
tain holy places fixed by the priests.
they remain on view for some
days. After this period, the
Balinese, a realistic people full of
common sense, come to collect
them, for they realize that
although the offerings are made
for the gods, they can only
be eaten by human beings.
