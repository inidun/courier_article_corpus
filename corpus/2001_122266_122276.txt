Afghan heritage: 
time for exile?
Despite unanimous indignation, the Taleban destroyed the statues of
Bamiyan. The international community now has the responsibility
to save what it still can
O
n February 26, 2 0 0 1 , Mullah Omar,
t h e Ta l e b a n ’s self-proclaimed emir,
ordered the destruction of all fig u r a t i v e
monuments and art works on A f g h a n
s o i l .This unprecedented step touched
off a unanimous international reaction.
Why such an outcry? Why has it fallen on deaf
ears? If the Taleban regime had helped to ease
the plight of Afghanistan’s people in one area or
a n o t h e r, I think their iconoclastic wrath would not
have sparked such an uproar.Of course,the cultural
vandalism has mobilized public opinion. But in
this specific case, worldwide indignation was fueled
by concern about all the hardships imposed on
the A f g h a n people before crystallizing over the
issue of heritage.
Since the Ta l e b a n ’s 1996 seizure of power in
K a b u l , the regime’s unfathomable scorn for the
Afghan people has taken many shapes. First, dis-
crimination against the Shiite minority.Then requi-
ring women to wear netted chadors and outlawing
school for girls upwards of eight years old. Hun-
dreds of thousands drought-stricken farmers have
been forced to leave their land and homes, while
poppies are grown in the eastern and southern parts
of the country. One single feature sets the destruc-
tion of the heritage apart from such other acts of vio-
l e n c e : this time, the message is addressed to the
international community, and it has been heard.
Investing statues 
with fearful powers
In 1989,a few weeks after Soviet troops pulled
out of A f g h a n i s t a n , a group of Hezb-i-Islami fig h t e r s
ransacked the Buddhist monastery of Hadda in the
eastern part of the country and destroyed its outs-
tanding art works without sparking any interna-
tional reaction.These same fig h t e r s, who have since
joined the Ta l e b a n , laid the groundwork for fur-
ther destruction based on ideological motives.
Mullah Omar’s edict gives a formal under-
pinning to these acts. It demonstrates more than a
theoretical scorn for the culture of other commu-
n i t i e s, especially Buddhist culture: the Ta l e b a n ’s
rejection is so radical that they want to wipe it out
because they still invest the statues with magical,
malevolent and fearful powers.
The earliest depictions of the Buddha occurred
in present-day A f g h a n i s t a n .And since the artists of
the first-to fifth-century Gandhara civilization were
influenced by Hellenistic sculpture, they gave him
the face of A p o l l o. Ja p a n , Sri Lanka,C h i n a ,B u r m a ,
South Korea and Thailand view Afghanistan as the
Athens of Buddhism.
L a t e r,during the 15th century, H e r a t , in western
A f g h a n i s t a n , was the Florence of Muslim painting.
Several centuries earlier,advocates and adversaries
argued over whether Islam permitted the depic-
tion of human figures. The caliphate of Damascus
settled the dispute, forbidding the depiction of God,
but authorizing the portrayal of princes and their
“A crime against culture,” according to  UNESCO’s direc
In times of war
and instability,
the cultural
heritage of these
countries was
exposed to
severe
destruction and
robbery. We can
only conclude
that peace and
stability are the
fundamental
factors for
preserving and
protecting
heritage.

power.
The miniatures and illuminated manuscripts
that flourished at the court of Herat were heirs to
that tradition and determined the canons of the
genre, which spread from Istanbul to Agra in the
18th century.Most of these masterpieces were taken
to Persia after the kingdom’s annexation in 1510,
while others accompanied Kabul’s Timuride princes,
cousins of the Herat court, when they conquered
India and set up the Moghol dynasty there. Th e
latest figurative illuminated manuscripts kept in a
library north of Kabul were burned after 1996.
Moving this heritage outside its area of origin some-
times has positive effects!
Making inventories of 
plundered collections
In the 20th century, a l l
Muslim countries, w i t h o u t
e x c e p t i o n , like all other
states, adopted the principle
that preserving and en-
hancing archaeological
heritage is vital for building a
modern nation and repre-
sents a base for cultural iden-
t i t y. As all the European
powers did after Po m p e i ’s
discovery in the 18th century,
they turned their backs on
the holy terror that works of
a foreign religious tradition
had inspired until then. The
archaeological past had to
b e preserved as a basis for
k n o w l e d g e, independent of
the religious charge it had ori-
ginally carried.
In 1919, an independent
Afghanistan invited archaeo-
l o g i s t s — first Fr e n c h , then Ita-
l i a n ,R u s s i a n , Ja p a n e s e,A m e-
rican and, more recently,
British and Indian—to undertake excavations,a n d
to train Afghan counterparts in return for agree-
ments on distributing the fin d s. In 1979, the war
put an end to these exchanges. Yet it was not until
after the Soviet withdrawal that the threat to heri-
tage reached an alarming intensity, as I can attest.
In autumn 1994, I walked into a Kabul museum at
the same time as General Massoud’s troops. For two
y e a r s,a faction independent of the central government
had controlled the quarter. The building had been
damaged by rocket fire and the collections plundered
out of sheer greed. Massoud agreed to place a cordon
of troops around the museum and guarantee its pro-
t e c t i o n .Within 24 hours, Carla Grissmann, a member
of Spach (Society for the Protection of the Afghan
Cultural Heritage, based in Peshawar), started an
inventory of the remaining collections.
The same year,Afghan archaeologists told me
they were worried.They said that the Rabbani and
Massoud government in Kabul would soon fall,
and that when Islamic extremists entered the capital,
they might destroy the collections.This emergency
situation prompted Najibullah Po p a l , the museum’s
c u r a t o r, to suggest creating a temporary storehouse
in a distant country. I consulted with diplomatic
representations and organizations for the protection
of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. Unfortunately,
none of them took action.
Foreign invitations
Since then, several projects in the same vein
have seen the light of day. Paul Bucherer-Dietschi,
a Swiss collector of Afghan manuscripts, says that
the Taleban as well as Rabbani asked him to house
what was left of A f g h a n i s t a n ’s heritage in his
museum in Bubendorf (Basel canton).After Mullah
Omar’s fatwâ, the Metropolitan Museum of New
York offered to house the pieces that had been
spared. If the move is still
p o s s i b l e,and whatever the
destination chosen, i t
should occur under the
supervision of a suprana-
tional authority. UN E S C O
would be the most legiti-
mate choice.
During the 1937 siege
of Madrid, S p a i n ’s repu-
blican government asked
Switzerland to give the
Prado collections asylum.
They were not returned to
Spain until after the Second World War. The cir-
cumstances in Afghanistan are different, but the
intensity of the crisis is comparable. That is why
the notion that cultural heritage belongs to all
humanity must replace the idea of national cul-
tural heritage. O t h e r w i s e, we must accept that
A f g h a n i s t a n ’s pre-Islamic and Muslim art will
vanish. ■
