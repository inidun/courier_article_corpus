crowd of people gathered on
the canal, standing on vessels. Silk
parasols were everywhere to be
seen. The boats themselves were ad¬
mirably painted." In these words the
great Arab traveller Ibn Battuta, who
spent thirty years journeying through
the Islamic world of his time,
described the great city of Hangzhou
in southern China, in the mid-
fourteenth century.
On 23 October 1990, there was a
similarly colourful scene at St. Mark's
Basin In Venice, terminus of one of
the routes along which the Chinese
silk noted by Ibn Battuta was for
centuries brought to Europe. While
crowds watched from the quayside,
a flotilla of historic boats gathered
to celebrate the departure of the
Omani ship Fulkal-Salamah, or "Ship
of Peace", on a journey that will
retrace the ancient maritime silk
route from Europe to the Far East.
The vessel has been loaned by
Sultan Qabus of Oman as the flag¬
ship of an international scientific
expedition that marks a high point in
Unesco's Integral Study of the Silk
Roads: Roads of Dialogue project.

Also moored in St. Mark's Basin for

Although It is only three years old,
the traditional lateen-rigged wooden
dhow and the traditional costume of
the envoys from Oman who mingled
with the international delegations
were reminders of the historic Venice
depicted by Carpaccio and other
Venetian painters, of the days when
ambassadors, travellers and mer¬
chandise from the whole of the then
known world converged on "the
most serene city" and took part in
ceremonies presided over by the

Flying the flag of the United Na¬
tions, the Fulk al-Salamah will carry
the Unesco expedition from Venice
to Osaka in Japan, where it is sched¬
uled to arrive on 3 March 1991. Over
fifty scientists and journalists on
board will be calling at some twenty-
one ports in sixteen countries, where
symposia, visits and other events will
be held as part of the research
programme.
The aim of the Unesco project is
to study the ancient channels of
communication between Orient and
Occident from different viewpoints
and disciplines. The term "Silk
Roads" Seidenstrassen was
coined by the German geographer
Ferdinand von Richthofen, himself a
great traveller in the nineteenth-
century tradition, to designate the
vast network of exchanges and in¬
fluences which stretched across Asia
as early as the second century BC
and helped to shape its spiritual and
material history. Many scientific
disciplines above all the human
sciences are represented on the
"Ship of Peace". Among them are
economics, archaeology, the history
of technology, the history of
religions, sociology, linguistics, ge¬
ography and philosophy. The very
name of the ship is a symbol of a
desire to understand and recreate
the dialogue between Orient and
Occident of which Venice is the
incarnation.
The quest of Marco Polo
The most celebrated Venetian of all
time was Marco Polo, the traveller
and merchant whose account of his
adventures in central Asia and China
in the late thirteenth century first set
Europe dreaming exotic dreams
about the Orient. "I think it pleased
God that we should come back, so
that people should know the things
that are in the world.... Never has
man, neither Christian, nor Saracen,
nor Tartar, nor pagan, made such a
quest across the earth as that of
Messer Marco, nephew of Messer
Nicolö Polo, noble and great citizen
of the city of Venice." These are the
last lines of the Tuscan version of his
book The Travels of Marco Polo,
which he dictated to his fellow-
captive, Rusticiano of Pisa, after he
had been made prisoner by the
Genoese in 1298.
There began an episode without
precedent in the history of literature.
Marco Polo's story of his adventures,
variously titled Le Livre des Merveilles
du Monde, Imago Mundi, Divisament
dou monde, and translated into
several romance languages, spread
throughout Europe. It inspired many
armchair explorers and some real
ones, the most famous of the latter
being Christopher Columbus who,
when he sighted the coast of Cuba
in 1492, thought he had reached
Marco Polo's Cathay. It has been said
that Marco Polo discovered China in
his lifetime and America after his
death. This is historically false, but
poetically true.
It had long been known in Europe
that there was a country in the East
which manufactured sericum (Latin
for "silk" from si, the Chinese word
for silk). When this mysterious and
prestigious fabric reached Rome In
the second century BC, little was
known about it except that it came
from the country of the Seres, a
fabulous place where, according to
the Greek satirist Lucian, people lived
to be 300 years old.
The many routes along which silk
was brought westwards varied over
the centuries, creating a network of
contacts some of whose traces can
still be followed in space and time.
Few men crossed the vast Eurasian
continent from end to end. It was not
until 98 AD that the first Chinese em¬
bassy arrived in the West, and in 166
AD what is known as the embassy of
the emperor Antoninus reached
China. In point of fact the "ambas¬
sador" was an adventurous mer¬
chant and not a representative of
imperial Rome.
Several centuries would pass be¬
fore the Far East came into more fre¬
quent contact with western Europe.
The first European explorers set out
for China in the Middle Ages, most
of them by overland routes, some by
sea. The majority were missionaries
such as Jean de Montcorvin, who
sailed from Venice in 1288 and ten
years later built the first Christian
church at Kanbalik (Beijing). Some,
such as Giovanni Loredan, entered
the service of the Mongols. The
Vilioni family, who may also have
been Venetians, were also great
travellers who left traces of their
presence in the Far East. One
member of the family is known to
have made his will at Tabriz in 1264,
and at Hangzhou is the tomb of a
Catherine Vilioni who died on 2 June
1342.
Who knows how many other Euro¬
peans set out for the East and
travelled at least part of the way
along the Silk Roads? The first stage
of the journey from Europe was most
likely to be a sea voyage. The classic
route was from Genoa, Brindisi or
Venice to the east coast of the
Mediterranean, where an adven¬
turous overland journey would begin
at Alexandria, St. Jean d'Acre or
Istanbul. In 1340 the Florentine Fran¬
cesco Balducci Pegolotti wrote in his
Pratica della Mercatura, the first
travel guide for European merchants,
that it took more than seven months
to travel from the Sea of Azov to
Hangzhou. The journey by sea took
even longer.
Venice occupied a key position in
the Western approaches to this Silk
Road. It was known, after all, as the
gateway to the East. Marco Polo was
the first Venetian to reach China, but
the city of the Doges had long held
sway over the Mediterranean basin.
Fortified by its political system (a
Republic which lasted eleven centu¬
ries without a break), its navy, its
colonies, its diplomats and mer¬
chants, Venice became the in¬
dispensable intermediary between
Orient and Occident. Until the six¬
teenth century, it was the European
port famed for precious Eastern mer
chandise such as silk, spices, carpets
and porcelain.
The secrets of paper
Oriental communities driven from
their homeland by war found asylum
In Venice, and in the fifteenth and six¬
teenth centuries the city was
thronged with foreigners who
brought with them their customs,
crafts and trading enterprises. Jews,
Armenians and Greeks had their own
neighbourhoods. And there is a fun¬
damenta oí the Ormesini in Venice,
a street of the people of Hormuz.
The foreign colonies which be¬
came established in Venice enriched
the Republic with new technologies.
In addition to their mastery of silk and
velvet weaving, the Chinese held the
secrets of paper manufacturing,
which also reached the West by
stages. When printing was in¬
troduced to Venice, it spread rapidly,
its development boosted by the city's
heterogeneous community. Many
Greek, Hebrew and Arabic texts were
printed. 49

In general, intellectual influences
travelled only short distances along
the Silk Roads. No Chinese poet be¬
came known in the West, no Greek
or Latin author crossed the Great
Wall. Buddhism long remained
unknown in the West, and the Chris¬
tian missionaries who set out for the
Far East never really implanted their
doctrine. Only after the Jesuit mis¬
sions began in the sixteenth century
did Western Christianity become es¬
tablished in some parts of the Orient.
Islam alone expanded in the East. It

was not until the late seventeenth
century, and even more in the eight¬
eenth, that the West really became
interested in what others thought
and in studying their history.
Once the concept of the Silk Roads
had been established by von
Richthofen, attempts were made to
locate them with precision. Routes
followed since the second century
BC were retraced. Explorers visited
towns which had been staging posts
on routes through steppe and desert.
They journeyed from Calcutta to
Balkh and followed the paths
whereby Buddhism had spread. They
sailed from Alexandria and through
the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the
Sea of Oman, the Indian Ocean and

the China Sea to Osaka. Great interest
was taken in the trading centres
caravanserais, post systems, Venetian
trading houses. A mass of informa¬
tion about the Silk Roads began to be
accumulated. The experts involved
in the Unesco project are seeking to
bring together and make sense of all
this scattered knowledge.
But let us not forget that there are
also imaginary journeys, evoked in
myths and fabulous stories. From
travellers' tales to major works of
literature, the Silk Roads still weave
a magic spell.
As we set sail in the Fulk al-
Salamah, the thoughts of many of us
on board turned irresistibly back to
Marco Polo.
