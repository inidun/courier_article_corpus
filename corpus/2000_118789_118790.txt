Thanks to ingenious and inexpensive surgery, a Nepalese doctor has brought vision 
to thousands of people in Tibet, which suffers one of the world’s highest rates of cataract
blindness

While staying at a small hotel in Meta-
gonga about four hours east of Lhasa en
route to T i b e t ’s famous Ganden monas-
t e ry,D r.Sanduk Ruit had a chance, four ye a rs
a g o, to savour one of the sweeter fruits of his
wo r k . It was on that occasion that a we l l - d r e s-
sed woman in her early 40s approached him
o f f e ring the traditional k a d h a (white scarf)
and c h h u rp i ( d ried cheese).
As it happened, she was the same wo m a n
upon whom Dr. R u i t , a Nepalese opthal-
m o l o gist who has caused a stir in T i b e t ,h a d
o p e r ated two ye a rs previously. At that time,
she had been totally blind as the result of a

of the eye . Her husband had left her when
she had become totally blind and she wa s
living like an animal. D r. R u i t ’s operat i o n
had enabled her not only to regain her vision,
but also to regain her dignity and fin a n c i a l

was now back with her fa m i l y.
Over the past 15 years,45-year-old Dr
Ruit has performed 20,000 cataract ope-
rations, each time replacing the damaged
natural lens with a plastic intraocular lens,
an approach dating from the 1980s when it
was popularized by Australian eye surgeon
Fred Hollows,Dr. Ruit’s teacher.

in Kathmandu where Dr.Ruit works today,
H o l l ows developed high quality intraocular
lenses for an affordable $7 each, m a k i n g
the operation economically feasible in deve-
loping countries.
The development was a godsend for
T i b e t , an autonomous region of China that
nestles on the border with Nepal.Tibet has
perhaps the wo r l d ’s highest incidence of cat a-
r a c t s ,p a rtly because Tibetans live in one of
the wo r l d ’s highest inhabited regi o n s.As alti-
tude increases, so does exposure to ultra-vio-
let radition that is harmful to the eye s.T h e
incidence of cataract blindness in Tibet is
about six times that found elsewhere in China.
Operating on the roof
of the world
Dr. Ruit always had a fascination with
T i b e t , from where his own ancestors set off
three centuries ago to settle in eastern
N e p a l . Finally it was in 1994, with the
financial help of New Zealand Rotary
Clubs and at the inv i t ation of the T i b e t
D e velopment Fund (TDF), a non-gove rn-
mental organizat i o n , t h at he was able to
make a foray on to the “roof of the world”.
During Dr. Ruit’s first visit, members
of the TDF asked how many operat i o n s
could be done during a four-day session at
C h u s u , a village between Lhasa and its air-
p o rt . They gaped with surp rise when Dr
Ruit replied that going on past experience
in Nepal, some 200 operations would be
possible in that time. In T i b e t , only 150
cataract operations had been done throu-
ghout the whole of the previous year.
D r. Ruit performs his operations within
five minutes. It is actually a ve ry simple surgi c a l
procedure which can be performed by eve n
a neophyte doctor in half an hour. F i rst the
e ye is wa s h e d , then a local anaesthetic is
applied below the lower eye l i d .The clouded
i n t e rior of the lens is removed through a tiny
i n c i s i o n , and finally the intraocular lens is
i n s e rted into the empty lens capsule.
For centuries, until around the 1950s,
Tibetans are believed to have practised cou-
ching, an operation which involves remo-
ving the clouded part of the lens but which
provides no replacement.
With Dr. R u i t ’s surgery, which is vir-
tually painless, bandages cove ring the eye
can be removed  within a day. From being
able to see only vague outlines of objects at
firs t , within weeks patients are able to enjoy
full eyesight. ■
