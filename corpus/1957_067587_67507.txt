THESE COOKS DID NOT
SPOIL THE BROTH

'TELL ME WHAT YOU EAT and I will tell you what you are", wrote Brillât-Savarin, the French gastronomist. The art of cooking has built
up countless melodies on a universal theme from a savoury stew bubbling on a stove in Morocco to the gastronomic masterpiece of a Paris chef.
If, as has been said, the art of
cooking is to combine the flavours
of different foodstuffs so as to
blend or to bring out their contrasts,
the process sounds simple enough to
have been discovered by any one of
the world's peoples. Yet this is not
the case. It is not possible to com¬
bine different ingredients unless they
are easily and simultaneously to
hand nor can their flavours be ming¬
led and harmonized without a know¬
ledge of cooking that goes further
than the mere heating of food.
Even the method of boiling food
in an earthenware pot is not univer¬
sally employed. Some peoples, who
have no pottery, bring food to the
boil by putting it into a vessel made
of wood or bark filled with water and
than dropping in heated stones. To
other peoples, boiling is not known at
all; they dig ovens in the ground and
line them with hot stones, the food
roasting slowly between layers of
green leaves which give off moisture.
Yet another method is to use the food
as its own container, by stuffing the
animal's body, or a flour-paste, with a
12
mixture which cooks while this outer
cover grills or roasts.
All these methods represent dis¬
coveries to which the human race
attained only gradually. Even now
certain very primitive tribes, like the
Nambikwara of Central Brazil, just
thrust the food they kill or gath¬
er (small animals and wild root-
vegetables) indiscriminately into hot
embers. The ashes that stick to it
provide the necessary mineral salts.
This primitive cooking is fatal to the
sense of taste, for the palates of the
Nambikwara cannot cope with any
strong stimulus; they have a horror
of salt, and even of hot food; when
I offered them a boiled and boiling
hot dish, they drenched it with cold
water before eating it. True, this
archaic attitude is exceptional. Many
peoples, however, suffer not from
want of cooking ability but from a far
more serious lack that of the means
of production as a result of which
they can hardly ever rely upon more
than one type of food at a time.
Ethnologists such as E.E. Evans-
Pritchard and Audrey Richards have
described how, in certain parts of
Africa, the physical health and men¬
tal outlook of the native population
are affected by the periodicity of
foodstuffs. Many communities have
enough to eat during only part of the
year, when manioc, millet or rice is
available. After these "'fat months"
come the "lean months," when the
people have only what they can col¬
lect at random. The daily meal
shrinks in size and, still more impor¬
tant, a diet rich in carbohydrates is
suddenly replaced by one consisting
almost entirely of such vegetables as
marrows and melons.
We, with our well-assured food-
supply, can hardly imagine the inten¬
sity of the sensations resulting from
this substitution. The feeling of re¬
pletion abruptly gives way to hunger-
cramps. Violent diarrhoea succeeds
the contrary discomfort of flatulence
and intestinal fermentation.
The native population thus finds
that both their bodies and their
spirits are radically affected by
changes in diet. As Audrey Richards
has said with so much insight, it is

not surprising that such communities
regard food as perilous stuff, charged
with every sort of magic influence.
They therefore associate the sensa¬
tions engendered by food with feelings
to which we attribute a different
origin ; the inner glow produced by
alcohol is for them a sign of anger,
whereas they connect fasting with
the highest spiritual emotions. "I
feel like a young girl again, I'm so
lighthearted!" exclaimed one old Afri¬
can woman, on a day when she
chanced to have eaten her fill.
In the history of the human race
there is a memorable, yet unknown
day: the date when man discovered
how to keep two different sources of
nourishment at his disposal all the
year round and, by
combining them, over¬
came the two great
dangers to his nour¬
ishment scarcity
of food, and its insi¬
pidity.
For to eat one's fill
'is not enough. As a
French proverb has
shrewdly put it, one
must not lose "the
taste for bread". The
whole history of cook¬
ing is the story of a
search for means of
making bread tasty,
of creating and fost¬
ering the appetite for
a basic foodstuff-
bread, rice, millet,
maize or manioc, ac¬
cording to the re¬
gion which supplies
energy but has little
flavour. Meat came
later; for a long time
it was, and in many
parts of the world it
still is, a luxury re¬
served for the privil-
eged. The real
foundation of cooking
throughout the world
is carbohydrates en¬
livened by a condi¬
ment. Bread and
onions, chapattis and
chutney, rice and
sauce made from
fermented fish;
millet, maize or mani¬
oc with pimentos
all these are simply
variations on a uni¬
versal theme, «on
which the art of cooking has built up
, countless melodies.
The difficulties attending this quest
for flavours are illustrated by the
great sea voyages of the 16th century,
undertaken with what today seem
the most trivial motives. Only some
400 years ago, Europe was organizing
these tremendous expeditions chiefly
for the purpose of obtaining spices.
This marks the birth of cooking in
Europe and, perhaps everywhere else
as well, since no culinary style seems
able to do without certain prod¬
ucts of American origin, unknown
. elsewhere in the world before the
discovery of the New World potatoes,
tomatoes, peanuts, chocolate, vanilla
and pimentos. A whole chapter of
ethnology, in fact, remains to be
written. It would describe the char¬
acter and geographical distribution
of the rules some very simple, others
incredibly complex for obtaining,
treating, associating and mingling
the various basic foodstuffs. It
would reveal the Polynesians as the
inventors of soil-less agriculture, for
some of these islanders succeeded in
cultivating gardens on their coral
reefs, in trenches filled with putrefied
refuse; it would show that certain
tribes, though extremely primitive in
other respects, have performed the
extraordinary feat of producing basic
foodstuffs from poisonous plants such
as manioc and acorns.
It would also show that certain pri¬
mitive peoples have developed cooking
that is full of subtleties. In one of
his books on the Kwakiutl (inhabi-

tants of Alaska, to whom hunting and
agriculture were alike unknown), the
distinguished American ethnologist
Boas gives no less than 156 recipes for
preparing various kinds of fish, fruit,
and wild root-vegetables. One of
these, chosen at random, consists in
beating up snow until it has the
consistence of whipped cream and
then mixing it with fish-oil, molasses
and uncooked berries.
Under the descriptive title Zuni
Breadstuffs, a book by another ethno¬
logist, Cushing, gives a fascinating
account of the production and prep¬
aration of food in this Pueblo Indian
tribe of New Mexico. A feast consists
of 14 courses rolls and wafers of
maize in six different colours, various
kinds of meat, offal, mutton sausages
and blood pudding. All these are

stiff-bristled affair
nately thrust into
sucked clean.
The consumption of food is a dis-
stinctly social affair. There are very
few peoples who, like the Paressi of
Central Brazil, take their meals in
"solitary confinement", so as to con¬
ceal the "indecent" act of eating.
Writing on the Kwakiutl, Boas des¬
cribes the etiquette of a ceremonial
feast the culinary preparations, the
arrangement of the different kinds of
vessels and mats, the despatch oi
messengers with the invitations
(which must be refused several times
before final acceptance), the songs in
honour of the guests, and the bestow¬
al on each of them of a specially
selected portion, be¬
fitting his rank.
There is nothing to
surprise us in all this;
Kwakiutl etiquette is
not so very different
from our own formal
dinners. We too hon¬
our our guests with
embroidered cloths,
silver plate and with
choice dishes. But our
cooks, unlike the tri¬
bal ones, have for¬
gotten what was once
an essential rite that
of doing honour to
the animals about to
be eaten, so that their
species may not van¬
ish from the earth.
Thus we sometimes
come across discon¬
certing instructions in
native recipes, such
as the following (ori¬
ginating with the
Tsimshian Indians of
the northwest Pacific
coast), which I offer
as food for thought
to housewives, on
concluding this brief
introduction to culin¬
ary ethnology.
When fat is to be
extracted from
olachen, the fish are
first dried in the
open air. They are
then boiled in vessels
filled with water into
which stones heated
in the fire are
dropped, the fat being
skimmed off as it
rises to the surface. The remainder
of the fish is afterwards spread on
a sieve above some recipient, and an
old woman presses it to her naked
breast as hard as she can, to squeeze
out the rest of the fat (men are
strictly forbidden to perform this
degreasing operation).
The cakes of fish are then heaped
up in a corner of the hut, where they
lie rotting until they swarm with
maggots. Despite the intolerable
stench, they must not be thrown
away.
Moreover, none of the "cooks"
concerned is allowed to wash; every¬
one must remain covered with filth
until the end of the proceedings,
which may last for two or three
weeks. Otherwise the fish would be
"ashamed" and would never come
