Chinese courts get a hearing
w Katherine A r m s
In an increasingly confli c t - p rone society, o rdinary Chinese are shunning g u a n x i— p e rs o n a l
connections—and granny patro l s, and calling their lawyers instead
The sort of skulduggery to which the 80 wo m e n
l a b o u r e rs fell victim is now so common that
the case might well have escaped public notice.
Four years ago the women,from a poor area of
inland Hebei prov i n c e , came to the country ’s capi-
tal to work at the Huayi Clothing Mill,a fully Chi-
n e s e - owned bu s i n e s s. G i ven a slow d own in the eco-
nomy, the women considered themselves lucky to
h ave jobs. U n f o rt u n at e l y, h owe ve r , the clothing mill
didn’t pay its workers for more than a year.
The women complained to local authori t i e s ,
but to no avail.Finally, as a last resort they applied
to the Centre for Women’s Law Studies and Legal
Services in Beijing for help.
Recently, they won their lawsuit and have been
awaiting a decision on damages.Their lawyer esti-
m ates that a total of between $120,000 and
$230,000 will be awarded to the 80 wo m e n .
Amounting to between $1,500 and $2,900 per per-
son,that may not sound like much, but compared
to the average per capita income in China it repre-
sents a small fortune.
What is perhaps most amazing about this story
is that the women bothered to turn to the courts at
all given that the judicial system has such shallow
roots in both pre- and post-revolution China.
Though the legal system is in its infa n cy and, a c c o r-
ding to human rights activists, is subject to gove rn-
ment interference in the case of sensitive political
i s s u e s , it is neve rtheless being taken increasingly
seriously.
In imperial times up until the beginning of this
c e n t u ry, China didn’t even have law ye rs. R at h e r ,
it had scri b e s , commonly known as “ l i t i g at i o n

The quest for r u l e of lawMaking t leap to a    
t ri c k s t e rs ” ,w ho might launch appeals on behalf of
people who felt they had been wronged. E n g a ging in
this practice was potentially dangerous. “ H a b i t u a l
l i t i g ation tri c k s t e rs ” could be exiled to the “ m a l a-
rial regions”of the south.
After the 1949 communist revo l u t i o n , the pri o-
rity of the judicial system was to serve socialism, a
p rinciple which often worked against protection of
i n d i v i d u a l s ’ ri g h t s. Things got wo rs e . D u ring the
Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Mao Zedong
wiped out legal institutions in favour of “ r e vo l u t i o-
nary justice”.
Coping with
a judicial vacuum
In this vacuum, ordinary Chinese people have
had to depend on informal neighbourhood com-
mittees, commonly run by elderly, retired women
wo r k e rs forming a sort of gr a n ny pat r o l , or on part y
or gove rnment leaders to intervene in disputes.
I nva ri a b l y, the politically well-positioned have used
g u a n x i , the Chinese term for personal connections,
to sway arbitrat o rs. M e a n w h i l e , those without good
g u a n x i h ave often had no choice but to suffer in
s i l e n c e , or make a desperate journey to Beijing
where they camp outside the State Council’s peti-
tion office for days or weeks hoping that some
g ove rnment official might gi ve them a sympat h e t i c
ear.
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution and the
b e ginning of economic reform in the late 1970s, t h e
Chinese leadership has gradually been rebuilding a
legal system.This ye a r , for the first time, the gove rn-
ment amended the national constitution to declare
China a country gove rned “according to the law ” .
This may seem banal,but legal experts say the
clause is import a n t .Although reference to a “ rule of
l aw ” is not made as such,“ b a s i c a l l y, the spirit is the
s a m e ,” s ays Wang Chenguang,a s s o c i ate professor of
law at Hong Kong’s City University.
One underlying reason for the switch to reliance on
l aw is that the old party and community stru c t u r e s
can no longer cope. In big cities, where high rises now
house significant swathes of society, m a ny of them
recently arri ve d , n e i g h b o u rs no longer know each
other as they did,say, two decades ago when govern-
ment restrictions on movement made it virt u a l l y
impossible to switch abodes. Local committee elders
are reluctant to interfere in the lives of people they
d o n ’t know, and residents are unwilling to counte-
nance interference, s ays Wa n g, a former member of
Beijing University’s law faculty and practicing lawyer
in Beijing.
Corruption and regionalism
At a practical leve l , Beijing now sees the legal sys-
tem as a possible solution to two of its biggest hea-
daches:corruption,which President Jiang Zemin has
called the single biggest threat to the future of the
Communist Pa rt y ; and regi o n a l i s m , in which local
o f ficials gi ve preference to local companies, o f fic i a l
bodies and other entities,a trend which many central
g ove rnment officials believe undermines nat i o n a l
unity.
M e a n w h i l e , s ay other expert s , society is simply
becoming increasingly confli c t - ridden as the rapid
change to a free-market economy presents all sorts of
new opportunities for disputes. For example, s i n c e
China abandoned co-operat i ve fa rming and turn e d
towards free enterprise, more and more people have
flocked to cities and towns to find wo r k .The poor and
u n e d u c ated are frequently victimized by greedy or
abusive bosses.
There are now in China some 140,000 law ye rs ,
still a small number in a country of 1.2 billion people.
But with free enterp rise gr owing law is increasingly
popular amongst students as a lucrat i ve vo c at i o n .
Since the Centre for Wo m e n ’s Law Studies opened
in 1995, six staff law ye rs have assisted more than 7,000
people, according to Guo Jianmei, a lawyer and the
centre’s director. She says they have tried more than
400 cases and have won more than half. Guo credits
the UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing in 1995 with giving the centre a big push.
“Many people from foreign countries came here
and they asked us, ‘Do you have legal aid?’ and we
told them we didn’t.It started the whole discussion,”
she says.
Spreading the word about basic legal rights is a
fundamental necessity. In 1993, Xie Lihua founded
R u ral Women Knowing A l l, the first publication for
m i grant wo m e n . She was interested in the plight of
rural women in big cities without money and exploi-
ted by employers.There are an estimated one million
migrant women in Beijing alone,many of whom have
no idea they have ri g h t s , s ays Xie, whose magazine
has a circulation of 220,000 and an estimated reader-
ship of 14 million.
“It used to be:‘I order you to do this’without any
q u e s t i o n ,” s ays Xie. N ow “ we are moving from a plan-
ned economy to a market economy and with this move
our laws have to change as well.” n
Some 30 investors outside the Beijing municipal government office in April 1998 call 
for the justice system to enforce contracts they had signed.
