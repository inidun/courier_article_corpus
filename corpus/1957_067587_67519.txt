AIRBORNE CATERING has had a new look since efficient aircraft ovens were developed
about ten years ago. Today on major airlines like Belgium's Sabena and Britain's B.O.A.C. (above,
left and right) and America's P.A.A. (below) main meals are served from shining, modern galleys.

GARGANTUA
of the skies
As a child, Gargantua giant hero
of Rabelais' satire was nourish¬
ed with the milk of four
cows ; reaching manhood, he drank
his fill from a hogshead holding 500
gallons, and his redoubtable appetite
was more than equal to the roast
oxen which his cooks set before him.
Today in many large cities there
are groups of chefs facing pretty
much the same problem as Gargan-
tua's kitchen staff. They too have
to satisfy the appetite and please
the palate of a giant, one whose size
increases at a phenomenal rate each
year the airline passenger.
The cooks, working in the kitchens
of Air France, at Orly Airport, Paris,
for example, last year used up 40
tons of meat, 80 tons of poultry,
nearly half a million eggs and over
70 tons of sugar in the meals they
prepared for passengers to eat on
airliners leaving this airport.
Five years from now, the Gargan¬
tua of the Skies at this same air¬
port then a seasoned traveller in
jet airliners will need 170 tons of
sugar to sweeten his coffee and his
pastries, 200 tons of poultry, 90 tons
of meat, a million eggs and (this
being France) two and a half tons
of pâté de foie gras. Today the
Catering Service of Air France at
Orly handles 36,000 items of cutlery
and crockery each day. By 1962 it
will be using well over 80,000.
Plans have already been made and
action taken to cope with the Titan's
inexorably growing appetite. Air
France has begun to build spacious
new catering quarters at Orly.
Air meals come of age
Full meals for air travellers
became both a possibility and a
necessity in the mid 1930's.
Since then the serving of fine foods
under the best possible conditions has
become an ever increasingly impor¬
tant part of airline operation, and the
present standards of airborne cater¬
ing reflect the ingenuity and resour¬
cefulness that have been brought to
bear on the problems of serving full
meals efficiently and swiftly.
One of the airline companies with
a very long experience of these prob¬
lems is the British Overseas Airways
Corporation (B.O.A.C). In 1934 this
company was using charcoal heated
containers to keep freshly cooked
food hot until the service of the meal
could begin. This and
similar methods were
superseded by the use
of insulated containers
and, in, 1946, by the
first efficient aircraft

ovens. These were primarily for re¬
heating frozen foods so that is was no
longer necessary to serve meals
immediately after take-offwhile
they were still hot.
B.O.A.C, like many other major
airlines, aims at a de-luxe restaurant
standard of service. Care is taken
in the planning of menus to provide
for national and religious dietary
preferences, and foods likely to give
offence to certain faiths are excluded
on some sectors.
The careful planning and prepara¬
tion which goes into modern airline
catering enables passengers high over
the Atlantic to eat the same sort of
food they might order in a Paris or
New York restaurant. Pan American
Airways (P.A.A.) for example, prides
itself on serving meals that include
such choice dishes as filet mignon
and roast duck prepared with orange
sauce.
The Belgian airline, Sabena,
actually sent the famous chef who
runs its catering service to the U.S.A.
for two years to study American
tastes and cooking. His job during
this time was to draw up menus for
the transatlantic services which
would please American passengers
while not running contrary to Euro¬
pean tastes.
National tastes are also considered
on the shorter runs. On its Brussels-
Warsaw line, Sabena serves up
French cooking with Polish vodka.
For Belgians going south on the
Brussels-Nice service, the holiday
begins on the aircraft with Provencal
dishes and pastis to drink.
Each to his taste
About three quarters of Skbena's
meals even for the return
trips to Belgium are prepared
in Brussels, one exception being the
New York-Brussels service whose
food comes from New York, though
the dishes are prepared "French
style".
To aid him in preparing menus
which have the greatest chance of
pleasing the greatest number, Sabe-
na's catering director has a long list
of the likes and dislikes of various
nationalities. Here are a few of them:
South Africans don't like French
wine.
Americans don't like very dry
Champagne.
The French only like their own
wines.
Americans don't like strong
coffee.
Italians like strong coffee.
Belgians are fond of what they
call "filet Américain" (raw,
chopped steak) not, in fact, a
favourite American dish at all.
Generally speaking the English
like things that displease the
French.
,The Dutch are given to eating
brussels sprouts with roast duck
and orange sauce.
As for the crews of Sabena, most
of them seem to suffer from a bad
case of jaded palate ; they have
tasted everything and so, it seems,
have the crews on other airlines.
