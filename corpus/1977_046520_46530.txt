A century and a half ago Panama
was the meeting place for a vast
"Continental Congress" which in its
aims and conception can be considered
a forerunner of today's international
organizations. The Congress was the
brainchild of Simon Bolivar, "The
Liberator of Latin America". (Left,

ON 9 December 1824, a high
narrow valley in the Peruvian
Andes was the setting for the
battle of Ayacucho, at which General
Antonio José de Sucre won a decisive
and irreversible victory over the only
remaining army of any consequence
Spain could still muster in South
America.
General de Sucre was the closest
comrade in arms of Simon Bolivar,
El Libertador (The Liberator) of Latin
America. His crushing victory at Aya¬
cucho was the culminating point in
the fifteen-year struggle for inde¬
pendence from Spain, which had
started in 1810 when a group
of patriots had seized power in
Caracas, and had spread, at the cost
of unrelenting strife and sacrifice,
from Venezuela and Argentina through
Colombia, Ecuador and Chile, to the
Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru.
Simon Bolivar was the man largely
responsible for winning political
independence for this vast landmass
and for shaping it into sovereign
republics. The immense task he under¬
took embraced every aspect of what
was, indeed, a genuine revolution.
By his vision and his action, he
personified the spirit needed not
only to achieve political indepen¬
dence through armed struggle against
the odds in a long-drawn-out war
with Imperial Spain, but also to lay
the foundations for the new and
complex organization of the new
States and to point to the direction
and role Latin America had to chart
for itself in the eyes of the world.
His own role was embodied in an
unrivalled combination of action and
reflection, in a sense of political reali-

ARTURO USLAR-PIETRI, Venezuela's am¬
bassador and permanent delegate to Unesco,
is one of Latin America's most famous
writers. Author of many novels, short stories
and essays such as La Otra América (The
Other America) he has been professor of
Hispano-American literature at Columbia
University (U. S. A.). His novel Las Lanzas

ties and a vision of the future, where
forging new political institutions was
no less important than winning
battles.
In addition to having to contend
with the pressing day-to-day prob¬
lems of a new organization, he had
to define the status and identity of
Latin America to the complex inter¬
national order of which it had just
become a part, without the slightest
experience and with few resources.
Bolivar never regarded indepen¬
dence as a national or local issue.
In his viewand this is where his
genius laythe independence move¬
ment had to embrace the whole of
Latin America. It had to be founded
on close union and co-operation bet¬
ween the new States and take careful
account of political developments in
Europe and elsewhere in the world.
Significantly, two days before the
battle of Ayacucho, he wrote from
Lima to all the recently liberated
countries, inviting them to take part
in a congress whose purpose it would
be to establish the closest form of
union possible.
This was an idea he had had in
mind for a long time. As early as
1810 when, as a yet unknown young
man, he had been sent to London as
a member of the diplomatic mission
from the recently created Caracas
junta, he spoke to an English news¬
paper of his intention to call on all
the peoples of Latin America to unite
in a confederation.
This was an idea which the found¬
ing fathers of Venezuela's inde¬
pendence wholeheartedly shared. In
thefirst Constitution drafted in 181 1,
they touched on the possibility of

in 1816.) In convening the Congress,
Bolivar sought to promote the unity
of Latin America by founding a great
confederation of its peoples, united
by a common heritage and a common
ideal of liberty. Right, monument

in Panama City to mark the
centenary of the Congress.
setting up a Latin-American con¬
federation which they would be pre¬
pared to join at any time.
From the time he first took up arms,
Bolivar realized that it was necessary
not only to combine Venezuela and
present-day Colombia into a single
State but also to go further and
unite the whole of Spanish America.
In 1814, in the difficult and at times
inauspicious days when the armed
struggle was just beginning, he made
a statement proclaiming: "Our native
land is America".
In 1815, in the adversity of defeat,
living the life of an almost penniless
fugitive in Jamaica, he wrote one of
the most extraordinary documents in
Latin American political history. In
a letter to a correspondent on the
island, the publisher of an English
newspaper in Kingston, he drew an
uncannily accurate and penetrating
picture of Latin America as it then
was and as it would become.
In that admirable document, he
again stressed the conviction that
the new States had to be joined in
political unity. "More than any man
alive", he wrote, "I want to see Latin
America become the greatest nation
in the world, not so much on account
of its size and wealth as by virtue
of its freedom and its renown".
In a tone of prophecy and denun¬
ciation, he elaborated on his vision of
things: "It is an awe-inspiring idea
to want to shape the entire New
World into a single nation with a
single bond linking its parts to each
other and to the whole. Since it has
a common origin, a common lan¬
guage, common customs and a com¬
mon religion, it ought to have a single \
government that would make a I

confederation of the different States
that have been created... What a
happy prospect it would be if the
Isthmus of Panama could be for us
what the Isthmus of Corinth was for
the Greeks.
"May the day come when we shall
be fortunate enough to convene in ,
Panama an august congress of the
representatives of the republics, king¬
doms and empires to consider and
discuss the higher interests of peace
and war with the rest of the world."
When Bolivar launched this singu¬
lar and momentous scheme, Latin
America had still a long way to go
before becoming fully independent.
Yet he had the extraordinary foresight
to seize on the idea that the unity of
the future States would provide the
mainstay for their own sovereignty.
He pointed to the historical links that
existed between the peoples emer¬
ging from the Spanish Empirethe
unity of their customs, language and
religionand expressed the belief
that the common heritage handed
down from the past ought to serve as
a firm and stable foundation to the
structure as a whole.
Bolivar even went on to advocate
the need to work for peace and co¬
operation through a permanent con¬
gress of all nations established in
Panama, which might become the
geographical focal point of world
politics. Mankind had to wait for
more than a century and suffered two
world wars before an organization
along the lines of that he had in mind
came into being with the creation of
first the League of Nations and then
the United Nations.
When the armed struggle was re¬
sumed, he wrote from the banks of the
Orinoco to the Argentine authorities
on the River Plate to announce that,
when the war had ended, he would
invite them to join in a single associa¬
tion so that the rallying-call could be
unity in Southern America. He ex¬
panded on this concept in the letter
accompanying his invitation, in which
he stated that all "Americans should

have only one homeland, since we
have achieved perfect unity in all
things."
When the fortunes of battle had
carried him from victory to victory and
he had welded Venezuela, New Gra¬
nada and Ecuador into the single
republic of Colombia, he dispatched a
group of plenipotentiaries to invite
the independent governments of
South and Central America and
Mexico to a congress at which the
foundations of unification were to be
laid.
The instructions he gave show
clearly that his intentions were not
confined to concluding a temporary
defence pact in, order to counter the
threat of a European invasion. The
old regimes which had fought against
revolutionary France had just organi¬
zed the Holy Alliance, to defend
absolute monarchy and the old social
structure. One of their first aims
was obviously to return the' liberated
colonies of Latin America to Spain.
Bolivar saw this attack on demo¬
cracy, the right of nations to deter¬
mine their own form of government
and the tenets of political freedom as
a universal issue, and he accordingly
set out to convince all the embryo
republics of the need for permanent
and unwavering unity. There can
be no doubt that he was thinking of
the example set by the union of
England's North American colonies
and the Congress that bestowed
lasting political unity on them.
As he explained to the envoys: "At
this moment, there is nothing more
important to the government of Co¬
lombia than the establishment of
an authentically American league of
nations. The proposed confedera¬
tion must not be inspired exclusively
by the idea of a conventional alliance
for defence or retaliation. On the
contrary, our association must be
more closely knit than that the Eu¬
ropean powers have recently created
in their attempt to deprive peoples:
of their freedom. Our association l
must be a league of sister nations, r
31

y "Although until now, owing to the
course taken by events, each of them
has exercised sovereignty individually:
if they are united, strong and re¬
sourceful, they can pull together in
withstanding foreign aggression."
"You must stress upon them how
necessary it is to make an immediate
start to laying the foundations for a
union of neighbouring States, an
assembly of plenipotentiaries that
would be capable of promoting the
interests of the American States and
of mediating in any disputes between
nations which, although having cus¬
toms and practices in common, may
perhaps, for want of so dedicated an
institution, spark off regrettable con¬
flicts such as those that have been
the scourge of other less fortunate
regions."
B
iOLIVAR'S view of the situation
inevitably invites contrast with
the opinion expressed by Presi¬
dent James Monroe of the United
States when he proclaimed his
famous doctrine. Whereas Monroe
confined himself to announcing that
the United States had decided unila¬
terally to oppose any attempt on the
part of the European powers to con¬
quer the New World, Bolivar visualized
the new republics as coming together
to form a permanent organization that
would concern itself not only with
defence but also with integration and
action in all fields.
Bolivar was thinking primarily in
terms of former Spanish America and
of organizing it with a view both to
averting the immediate threat and to
evolving a complete policy for the
future, including collaboration with
the United States and balanced rela¬
tions between the Americas as a
whole and the rest of the world.
Bolivar had to wait almost two
years, until military victory was com¬
plete and all the territory of the for¬
mer Spanish Empire had won inde¬
pendence, before urging his proposal
again.
He took this step on the eve of the
battle of Ayacucho, when he wrote
to the other governments from Lima
inviting them to take part at last in
the congress of Panama he had so
earnestly striven for.
In his long endeavours to create a
free America, Bolivar's thinking was
dictated by three main ideas. The
first was to create a tightly-knit
confederation, united in its political
action, of most of the countries which
had emerged from the dissolution of
the Spanish Empire and were closely
connected by history, language and
culture.
The second idea, which perfected
and enhanced the first, was to draw
up a sort of pact of assistance and
co-operation between all the Ameri¬
can States, including those with
different languages and origins such
as the United States, Brazil and Haiti.
The third and final idea, which was
more wide-ranging and exalted in
concept, was to create that "august
Congress" of all the governments of
the world in order "to consider and
discuss the higher interests of peace
and war".
His mind broke free from the narrow
confines of the commonplace and
strove to survey the destiny of his
people in the setting of world politics
and of its prospects and trends.
In view of the power wielded by
the Old World and the threat of the
Holy Alliance, much larger and more
powerful political units had to be set
up, as the English settlers had done
in the North and yet, at the same
time, allowance had to be made for
the fact that the countries of America
had situations and interests in com¬
mon with the States and groups in
the rest of the world.
In so many words, Bolivar was
visualizing a new international order
and a new balance of forces between
continents based on law and justice
in an endeavour to secure peace.
This made him an extraordinary pre¬
cursor" of the legal and political
movements that have risen to
prominence in the world of today.
Bolivar felt that what was needed
was what he used to call a "balan¬
cing of the universe"what we today
would call a new international order.
He observed that the newly liberated
countries of Latin America could not
achieve and maintain the full dignity
of their independence unless they
worked through a wide-ranging and
solidly-based confederation. Now
that he could act, he finally convened
the Congress* of Panama, thus giving
substance to a project that until then
had appeared to be a mere idealist's
dream.
THE following States were invited
to attend the Congress of
Panama: Colombia (which
consisted of the present-day Vene¬
zuela, Colombia and Ecuador) Mexico,
Central America (comprising Costa
Rica, Guatemala," Honduras, Nicara¬
gua and El Salvador), Peru, present-
day Bolivia, Chile, Argentina/ Brazil
and the United States. For various
reasons, the United States, Brazil, Ar¬
gentina, Bolivia and Chile were unable
to be present, although they had
accepted the invitation.
The extraordinary meeting eventually
took place in Panama City on 26 June
1826. The instructions of the dele¬
gation of Peru, which were those
dictated by Bolivar himself, laid down
the following major objectives:
The creation of a permanent con¬
federation, union and league, in both
peace and war, against any nation
attempting to dominate America in
part or as a whole. Mutual gua¬
rantees of independence, freedom
and territorial integrity. No conclu
sion of alliances with foreign powers
except by mutual agreement. Sub¬
mission of all conflicts to the perma¬
nent Congress without recourse to
war. Outlawing of the slave trade
and creation of a joint military force.
Lastly, condemnation of war and
conquest in the relations between
peoples and governments.
Bolivar wanted an organization that
would have the strength and inde¬
pendence to exert an influence on
local separatist movements. He
was thinking not only of a permanent
representative body to assume that
important function but also of the
creation of a standing army that
would not be directly answerable to
any one State. This principle was
accepted inasmuch as it was agreed
that a permanent force of 60,000
men and a confederate navy would
be set up with contributions from,
member countries.
This was the first time in history
that such a confederation had been
created to promote the union of free
nations through peace and progress
rather than to triumph in war.
AND yet this was not everything
Bolivar, was seeking. Men
with a narrow parochial out¬
look, who thought only of their imme¬
diate short-term interests, could not
countenance so far-reaching and
revolutionary a project and they intro¬
duced qualifications and restrictions
that largely distorted the true nature
of that noble enterprise.
Perhaps it was ahead of its time.
So forward-looking and purposeful
a vision of the destiny of Latin Ame¬
rica could scarcely be accepted in a
spirit of enthusiasm and good faith
by people with all the petty interests
and prejudices of a society which had
still not shaken off its backward
colonial past.
Bolivar's unstinting endeavours
did not live on after him. The his¬
tory of Latin America in the 19th
century was one of fragmentation
instead of union and confederation.
The prospects which he had outlined
could not have materialized at that
moment in time. . Today, however,
they have gained a new lease of life
and sound an overwhelming note of
urgency. The peoples of Latin Ame¬
rica are increasingly convinced that
they have to integrate and unite if
they are to make their presence felt
on the world scene.
Bolivar's thinking and acts and the
imposing project of the Congress of
Panama are the surest foundation
for this grand design. The masterly
lesson and undying example of a
century and a half ago concern not
Latin Americans alone but the host
of mankind in the Third World who
are now emerging in search of a
more just international order.
