Fantastic voyages in film
THE cinema established its unique
capacity to bring to life the
dreams and visions of science
fiction as long ago as the beginning of the
century, and from then until the mind-
bending computer-created images of to¬
day's intergalactic epics film-makers
developed a dazzling array of camera
tricks and special effects to bemuse the
public.
Space travel was brought to the screen
by the French pioneer Georges Meliès.
The filmic imagination was given free
rein in his version of Jules Verne's A Trip
to the Moon (1 ), depicting a Moon where
giant mushrooms unfurled from the ex¬
plorers' umbrellas and contrasting with
the documentary realism with which
Moon trips would be presented in such
later films as Destination Moon (US,
1950) made when space flight had
become a real possibility. By 1916 no
less than three films had been made of
Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues
under the Sea and his novels with their
mixture of fantasy and precise detail
have ever since continued to provide
film-makers with tempting fare.
Two classics of the genre were made
in the 1920s and 1930s. Fritz Lang's
Metropolis (1926) presented a grim
vision of the future complete with terrify¬
ing machines and a robot-woman (2)
which were still influencing science fic¬
tion films four decades later. Things to
Come (3) resulted from collaboration bet¬
ween H.G. Wells and the Hungarian-born
producer Alexander Korda. In it a global
holocaust is followed by the rise of a
gleaming glass and steel civilization
capable of sending men to the Moon. As
in Jules Verne's Moon flight, a gun was
used to project the space vessel,
although by that time scientists knew
that the rocket was the only practicable
solution.
A boom in science fiction films began
in the 1950s, with space exploration as
a prominent theme. Earthlings ranged
further and further afield, as in the Soviet
Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet, a
meticulous narration of a journey to
Venus. But the traffic was not all one¬
way, and Earth had some strange visitors
from other planets. The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers (1956) treated the
theme of alien intelligence taking over
human bodies, and was described by one
critic as "occasionally difficult to follow
due to the strangeness of its scientific
premise". Another favourite theme is the
journey through time or other dimen¬
sions, with perhaps the most unusual
variation being depicted in Fantastic
Voyage (5) in which five scientists are
shrunk to microscopic size and injected
into the blood stream of another scientist
who has a blood clot inaccessible to
surgery.
The Incredible Shrinking Man (6) with
its hero becoming smaller and increasing¬
ly alien in his own world is, like the situa¬
tion in Fantastic Voyage, literally incred¬
ible. As a sceptical scientist has pointed
out, a mouse-sized man "would suffer
from a mouse's metabolic problems.
With a surface area many times greater in
proportion to his mass, he loses heat that
much faster and would need to eat
furiously simply to keep warm. A mouse
needs to eat about a quarter of its own
weight of food each day to survive..."

of technology, the fallibility of men and

machines, also find expression in a
number of "prophetic" films about the
future of mankind. Alphaville (1965) is
set in a futuristic city run by an electronic
brain which is finally destroyed when it is
fed with poetry, a medium it cannot
understand. HAL, the homicidal com¬
puter in 2001: A Space Odyssey also
echoes fears about a computer-
dominated society.
The real stars in modern science fiction
films are the special effects, some of
them spectacular setpieces such as scaly
monsters and spaceships but others the
kind that no one would notice. For Close
Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
about a hundred paintings on glass were
blended into the scenes. Such tech¬
niques and the blending of miniatures in¬
to live-action backgrounds were already
being used in Things to Come. A widely
used optical effect is the matte or mask
which blanks out a part of the screen
which can be filled in later. In Star Wars
a few hundred extras were turned into
thousands by being photographed three
times at different distances from the
camera; the three shots were combined,
and side ranks of men were painted in.
The use of "travelling mattes" which
change position, size and shape from
frame to frame can create such effects as
the "flying" of Superman. He was shot
in front of a blue screen and a shape cor¬
responding to his outline was cut out of
a skyline scene and his body fitted into
the gap. One way of tricking the au¬
dience used by Stanley Kubrick in 2001:
A Space Odyssey was based on the
viewer's assumption that the camera is
static. The stewardess in photo 7 carries
a tray and appears to walk through 360
degrees. In fact she was standing on a
treadmill and the camera and the entire
set rotated together. Today the use of
computerized camera systems and
computer-created images in such films
as fron (opposite page) are creating
astonishing aesthetic effects whose
possibilities are only just beginning to be
exploited.

space exploration series Star Trek,
which began showing on US television
in 1966, ran to 78 episodes until 1969,
and has been repeated many times
since. The United States space shuttle
Enterprise was named after the show's
space craft, and a Star Trek film was
released in 1979. Below, computer-
generated images were used in the Walt
Disney film Tron to evoke a programmed
world inside a computer.
