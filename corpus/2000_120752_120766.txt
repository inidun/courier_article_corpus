HEAD OF ASIANCINEMA PROGRAMMINGFORTHE HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVALFROM 1997 TO 2000



If garnering awards at major film festivals like
Cannes is a sign of good health, then Chinese
fil m s, or more accurately Chinese-language
films, are doing splendidly. Mainland China,
Taiwan and Hong Kong each had a film that
picked up honours at the last Cannes festival—
Jiang We n ’s Devils on the Doorstep,Edward Ya n g ’s
Yi Yi and Wong Kai-wai’s In the Mood of Lov e r e s-
pectively—while Ang Lee’s out-of-competition
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a hit among
festival-goers.
Unlike the more mainstream C r o u ching Ti g e r,
h o w e v e r,the other three films have not been released
on home ground. Devils on the Doorstep, w h i c h
invited the wrath of China’s Film Bureau by travel-
ling overseas without going through the proper chan-
n e l s,probably needs to clear a few hurdles before it
can see the light of day. In the cases of Yi Yi and In the
Mood of Lov e, the reasons are commercial: n e i t h e r
film is expected to do well at the box-offic e,and dis-
tributors are moving cautiously. S t r a n g e l y, the soils
that produce these films do not seem particularly
congenial to serious cinema.Scrutiny of these movies’
financing in fact reveals that apart from D e v i l s,all are
international co-productions.
The People’s Republic to this day keeps a tight
rein over filmmaking and parrots the dogma
“cinema must serve the people.” But this constraint
has been perversely undermined by modern China’s
obsession with its historical destiny.“ Fifth Genera-
tion” filmmakers such as Chen Kaige and Zhang
Yimou portray China’s past, and are faithful to the
dictums of 1930s “progressive”Chinese cinema in
using history to dissect the failings of the present.
But “Sixth Generation” fil m m a k e r s, who arrived
on the scene in the aftermath of the 1989 Ti a n a n m e n
uprising, trumpet a very different sense of aesthe-
tics. Working without official approval, early films
like Zhang Yuan’s Mama (1991) and He Jianjun’s
Red Beads (1993) seethe with inwardly directed
r a g e, capturing the fatalism of post-1989 society.
Allegories based on madness,dysfunctional families
and above all alienation are major themes. Fo r
these independents, the biggest headache is seeing
their films scoop up awards on the festival circuit
while remaining largely unseen in China itself.
The two currents—historical
and contemporary—look set to
join in Jia Zhangke’s new fil m
P l a t f o r m.A richly layered work, i t
observes the lives of young people
in a provincial music troupe as
they fall in love and are hurtled
into the vast unknown of China’s
m o d e r n i z a t i o n . Over three hours
long but with less than a hundred
s h o t s, the film is unprecedented
in mainland Chinese cinema.
Taiwanese fil m s, m e a n w h i l e,
have won international recogni-
tion even though the island’s fil m
industry has been in  decline, w i t h
annual output dwindling to 20
films and funding coming from
the government or abroad. Ye t
Taiwan still manages to produce
some of the world’s best filmma-
kers, including Hou Hsiao-hsien,
Edward Ya n g, Tsai Ming-liang
and Ang Lee—a film-maker with
stronger mass appeal than his
peers and a track record in light
comedy (Eat Drink Man Wo m a n) ,
adaptations of classic novels
(Sense and Sensibility) and, with
C r o u ching Ti g e r, o l d - s c h o o l
swordplay.
Similar financial concerns
abound in Hong Ko n g, home to
headline-grabbing art-house

Yi Yi, by Taiwanese director Edward Yang, reveals the gulf between the old and the new.

directors like Fruit Chan and Stanley Kwan. Th e
interdependence of mainstream and non-mains-
tream cinema is perhaps most prominent here:
Chan and Kwan came through the ranks of com-
mercial cinema during the mid-and late-1980s,
when the industry was enjoying a golden age.
N o w, h o w e v e r, these directors have to seek fin a n-
cing elsewhere.
With the People’s Republic unlikely to relax
its control, and Hong Kong unlikely to support
commercially unviable projects, C h i n e s e - l a n-
guage cinema looks set to follow the Ta i w a n e s e
model of international funding. How this pro-
cess will impact on “Chinese national cinema” o r
even the idea of national cinema per se will prove
fascinating to watch. ■
