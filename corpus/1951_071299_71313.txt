UNIVERSITIES
OUND FIRST WORLD
ASSOCIATION AT
NICE CONFERENCE
THE world's first International
Association. of Universities
was set up in Nice, France
last month at a one-week meeting
(December 4-10) attended by dele-
gates representing universities in
53 countries.
Assembled in the Mediterranean
University Centre, more than 200
delegates unanimously approved
the constitution and programme of
the new association and elected
M. Jean Sarrailh, Rector of the
University of Paris as president and
Dr. S. C. Roberts, Vice-Chancellor
of Cambridge University as vice-
president.
The main purpose of the associa-
tion, whose headquarters will be
in Paris, is to give universities
greater solidarity through mutual
assistance. The International Uni-
versities Bureau will work in Paris
as the Association's Secretariat and
will constitute a centre of statisti-
cal studies in all branches of uni-
versity life.
By spreading among universities
better knowledge of each other's
curricula and methods of orgar`3-
tion, the Bureau will help to solve
such problems as the equivalences
of degrees and diplomas issued by
higher education authorities in all
parts of the world. A programme
of long-term exchanges of profes-
sors among universities will also be
considered as well as the role that
universities can play in the United
Nations Technical Assistance Plan.
Universities'Mission
FOR its main discussion lastmonth, the Conference chose
the theme of the mission of
universities in the modern world,
the opening speakers being Ber-
nardo Houssay, the Argentine phy-
siologist and Nobel prize winner ;
George Zook, the American histo-
rian and president of the Ameri-
can Council on Education ; and
Pierre Auger, the French physicist
and head of Unesco's Natural
Sciences Department.
Addressing the Conference at its
opening session, M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Unesco's Director-General,
congratulated the delegates on
their choice of this subject for de-
bate.
"There is little likelihood of the
various dogmatisms of today allow-
ing the universities to become
sanctuaries isolated from the
upheavals of the outer worlds,"he
said,..... 1 am not proposing that
the separate domains of politics and
universities should in the smallest
degree be merged or confused... it
is essential that universities should
hold aloof both from party strife
and from the official ideologies,
that they jealously guard their in-
dependence and their serenity. But
independence does not mean indif-
ference, nor serenity mental blind-
ness. There is no reason why im-
partial teaching based on the
strictest scientific objectivity
should give the impression of flying
from reality and thus leave she
young who are taught i11-equipped
to cope with the world.
Is Youth Prepared ?
"THE gap between scientific
and everyday knowledgeis
growing ever wider. What
the scientist describes is less and
less at the level of being at which
we live... the initiate is cut off from
the everyday world at once by the
narrowness and profundity of this
learning.
"For the university to train
scholars and specialists is very well,
but it must not so confine them to
their own subjects as to leave them
helpless before the general pro.
blems presented to all our con-
sciences by a world of which we
have scarcely yet begun the mate-
rial organization.
.. Universities must not be mere
museums of thought, The object of
research laboratories, of enquiries
and studies, of card indexes of li-
braries and private scholars, is of
course to aid the advance of science
- but also to promote the progress
of man and of society,"
