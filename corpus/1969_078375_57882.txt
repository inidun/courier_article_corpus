THREE-DIMENSIONAL YOUTH
developing countries

by Ehsan Naraghi
IHE crisis of youth that has
swept the world has affected countries
with different political systems, the
highly industrialized countries as well
as the developing nations of the
so-called Third World.
Depending on the ideologies and
conceptions of their leaders, this
problem is approached differently and
given more or less importance.
In certain countries, youth's unrest
is a passing phenomenon that threat¬
ens neither the structure of society
nor its basic institutions. In others,
it is expressed through violence,
challenges the whole Establishment
and its institutions or at least certain
practices and fundamental principles
that govern the upbringing and edu¬
cation of the young.
Youth's radical demands, their
anxiety about the future and the fact
that they are not yet integrated into
the social pattern have focussed
attention, consciously or unconscious¬
ly, on the social and cultural problems
and contradictions of our time.
Youth's critical attitude may appear
abstract, violent, irrational, immature,
or even negative and lacking in per¬
spective, but it forces adults to revise
their habits and ways which they
would otherwise not have questioned.

EHSAN NARAGHI is professor of sociology
and director of social studies and research at
the University of Teheran (Iran). A member
of the Executive Committee of the Interna¬
tional Association of Sociology, he has written
widely on sociological problems in the deve¬
loping countries. In 1966 he prepared a spe¬
cial report for the U.N. Special Fund on the
training and employment of scientific and
technical personnel in Latin America, Africa
and Asia. He was a member of the interna¬
tional group of specialists sponsored by
Unesco, which met in Bucharest last year to
prepare a project for the promotion among
youth of ideals of peace, mutual respect and
international understanding.
"Senile delinquency." For years,
the industrially advanced countries
have talked of the adaption of youth
to society. Sociologists and psycho¬
logists have dealt with the problem
of maladjusted adolescence and
"juvenile delinquency." We appear
to be witnessing today a revolt of
young people who refuse to adapt to
our society, who call their parents'
attitude "senile delinquency," who
condemn adult society and believe
that they possess new values.
I recall the violent though somewhat
localized reactions of youth during the
1950s in the U.S.A. and Europe,
particularly in Sweden. This violence,
portrayed in the James Dean film,
"Rebel Without a Cause," reflected
the attitude of many young people at
the time. It showed teenagers of a
technological society where boredom,
monotony and indifference engendered
aggressiveness expressed through
physical violence.
Since then, there has been an

important change. Violence Is no
longer just physical. It also derives
from other factors: wars, social
injustices, racial discrimination, ar¬
chaic institutions.
In fact, youth's horror of any kind
of armed conflict or war Is now a
fairly general phenomenon. The
world's youth find it difficult to accept
that after World War II and after the
nations set up a world organization
to keep the peace, that wars and
killing should still be possible. Do
not all countries constantly proclaim
their desire for peace?
For though it is true that the United
Nations has rendered invaluable ser¬
vice to the cause of peace and inter¬
national understanding, the uncom¬
promising attitude of youth cannot
condone the use of force by any
nation. That is why youth feels a
certain scepticism about the pacifist
declarations of international organiza¬
tions and States; the scepticism can
even go 'so far as the use of the
word hypocrisy.
As regards war, we seem to be
moving toward the crumbling of ideo¬
logical and nationalistic concepts

which in their present form are losing
their raison d'être in the eyes of
youth.
Scientific and technological advan¬
ces, the conquest of space and the
closer ties between nations through
improved communications are shrink¬
ing the world. Despite the persistence
of national particularisms, a feeling of
fraternity of all mankind is growing
among young people. That is why
many - young people condemn the
attitude of the older generation and
refuse to accept their so-called justi¬
fications of "local" conflicts.
The "aesthetic dimension." In our
industrial societies, where everything
is subordinated to the demands of
technology, youth finds no outlet for
its vitality or enthusiasm. It is in this
context that the American economist
John Kenneth Galbraith has spoken
of the "aesthetic dimension."
The genius of the industrial system
lies in the organized use of capital
and technology, but neglects the aes¬
thetic dimension which could enrich
man's other activities by eliminating
many types of extremism.
Aesthetics, we know, is the science
of the beautiful and the feeling it
creates in man. Galbraith sees it as
everything that transcends the mech¬
anized life, everything like surprise
and fantasy in the philosophic sense
that is missing in our society, where
the unexpected and the unusual are
syphoned off for the needs of the
consumer technology.
Every aspect of life is now domin¬
ated by technology which is stamping
everyone in the same mould.
We are now witnessing the reaction
to this. That of the hippies is one
example, with their exaltation of flow¬
ers, nature and love, urging freedom
in human relations and disinterested
action, community life, non-violence
in every aspect of daily life. They
oppose all acts symbolizing submis¬
sion to the dominating rules of society:
work, a career, standardized clothing,
etc. Obviously the hippie cult is
unthinkable except in an affluent
society.
A poll taken only a few months
ago by the French Institute of Public
Opinion shows that there has been a
marked change in the attitudes of
young people as a result of material

well-being. Ten years ago, only 22
per cent of French youngsters replied
that they had everything they wanted
from the material point of view, but
today, as many as 32 per cent give
this answer.
If in France, which Is not a 100 per
cent affluent society, youth express
such satisfaction about their material
well-being, then one can well imagine
what this "satisfaction" must be in
more technically advanced societies.
The barrier of misunderstanding
between this younger generation which
have always had everything and the
older generations which have reached
the same level only after much
hardship poses a host of problems.
Formerly, tastes, recreation and even
the idea of happiness were linked to
a notion of effort that no longer
prevails. Furthermore, this material
well-being exists in an era when
young people are Integrated into
economic and social life when they
are much older.
The growth of the means of mass
communication has also speeded up
the intellectual growth of young peo¬
ple, providing them with news of world
events at an early age. This has led
them to express their views earlier
too.
All children who, by the age of 8
or 10, have watched the live TV pro¬
grammes of the space Odyssey of
Apollo 8 are deeply affected and
keenly interested by this epic flight,
which gives them new insight into the
world at large. Thus, at an early age,
they ask a host of other questions
and now feel that they are personally
"Involved" in events and problems
formerly reserved for adults, but are
denied participation in economic, poli¬
tical and social life until they are "a
little older."
Students in th? socialist countries.
The young look upon the attainments
of socialism as basically sound but
want to go further and take advantage
of their cultural heritage and new
currents of thought to engage their
elders in a new dialogue. This explains
why the desire for renewal and
freedom comes chiefly from within the
university.
Criticism has often been given
impulse by the more privileged circles
of young people. Once they have
attained material well-being and
access to higher education, these
well-feathered youngsters known in
Poland as the "banana kids", that Is,
the sons of intellectuals and State
officials go beyond this stage and
start asking embarrassing questions
about the cultural establishment.
Obviously, the present young gener¬
ation, which never knew the hardships
of the last war or the painful efforts
of their fathers in rebuilding their
devastated country, find the State
machine extremely bureaucratic. Thus
one of their slogans is the reduction
of bureaucracy to facilitate the com¬
munication and circulation of ideas.
This attitude is not found in all
socialist countries to the same degree.
In Yugoslavia, President Tito sided
with the students in their clash with
the top echelon official bureaucrats.
A Belgrade student song of the
summer of 1968 reflects this state of
mind:
"... So that all the shadows vanish
And this story may begin
The days pass . . .
Nary a nook or cranny
Without its bureaucrats
The days pass . . .
The 'Student' mag was banned
And then they regretted it
The days pass . . .
Out with indifference,
Shake the stick-in-the-muds,
The days pass ...
They're all on our side
Again, Fear not the new dawn
The days pass . . ."

Adolescents in the developing coun¬
tries. The situation of young people
in the developing countries resembles
that of European and American youth
in certain ways but also reveals a
number of differences.
The democratization of primary
education and in the more developed
countries of Latin America and the
Middle East of secondary education
has produced many certificate holders.
But often their technical knowledge is
inadequate to guarantee them a parti¬
cular job and hence any certainty of
a real future.
Here we see the consequences of
educational systems, that are copied
all too often from Western models
but correspond neither in spirit nor
form to local social and economic
conditions nor to the needs and
realities of the developing countries.
Enquiries made among these young¬
sters of 18 and 19 who have
completed secondary school confirm
their anxiety about their future
careers.
Everywhere there are complaints
of the lack of technical and pro¬
fessional training. The lycées based
on the Latin model and the secondary
schools based on English and Amer¬
ican models aimed at preparing
young people for higher education.
But the phenomenal rise in secondary
school enrolment makes it well nigh
impossible for all who graduate to
continue with higher education.
Pre-university training which does
not, as in most cases, lead to the
university creates problems of adapta¬
tion since final selection for university
takes place at the end of secondary
education rather than at an earlier
stage in secondary school which would
give students clearer guidance regard¬
ing their future.
In India, for example, where there
is a disproportionate influx of young
people into universities, the number
of graduates far exceeds the jobs
available. According to the Report of
the Education Commission (1964-66),
India has something like one million
"educated unemployed."
The difficulties facing young people
are mainly inherent In the educational
system since the democratization of
education and the population explo¬
sion have not gone hand in hand with
the appropriate training of the teaching
staff.
Because teaching is a top priority
in the developing countries and be¬
cause secondary and higher education
graduates are limited in their choice
of profession, many decide to become
teachers. Having neither training as
teachers nor any professional vocation,
they regard it as the lesser of two
evils, a make-shift profusion until
something better turns up.
This has made for a sharp deter¬
ioration in teaching standards, highly
detrimental to the intellectual develop¬
ment of the young, with the result that
the school is losing prestige in the
eyes of youth. This is happening in
the very societies where parents are
not in a position to take over the
education of their children.
Thus the chief complaints of
youngsters in the developing countries
are: lack of qualified teachers, lack
of equipment, and above all the enor¬
mous differences in the quality of
schools. As wealthier classes tend
to send their children to better staffed
and equipped schools, this leads to
injustices regarding the availability of
good schools for all children and a
gap in standards between private and
state schools, provincial and city
schools.
Thus a child in the developing
countries is aware even at a very
early age of a form of educational
injustice that goes counter to the prin¬
ciples proclaimed by the State. The
school, with Its ill-adapted, inadequate
teaching system, thus adds a new
element of disorientation and a cause
of cultural and moral frustration.
In addition, the modern mass media
have given youth aspirations and
ambitions unknown to their parents;
but present day education fails to give
young people the training they need
to achieve these ambitions, and the
outcome is rancour or aggressiveness
toward society which is bound to
increase as the years pass.
The authoritarian attitude of parents
in the developing countries is consi¬
dered by youth as a serious obstacle
to the development of their own per¬
sonalities. It is particularly apropos in
those countries where the emanci¬
pation of girls Is beginning to take
place. With no prospects of immediate
employment young people are depen¬
dent on their parents for many years,
and this is often irksome especially
when there are serious differences
concerning intellectual and moral
questions.
Rules regarding behaviour are often
quite distinct between the sexes.
The rules governing behaviour are
usually much stricter for girls than
boys unlike the freedom for both
sexes in western countries which they

THREE-DIMENSIONAL YOUTH (Continued)
The emergence of a new concept of values
34
see portrayed by the cinema, TV and
other media. This has given rise to
conflicts leading either to passive
resignation, pessimism or defiance of
the traditional rules of conduct.
To the drifting youth of the dev¬
eloping countries, entry into a univer¬
sity means a new perspective, a new
confidence and the promise of a
different tomorrow which is the envy
of all non-college youngsters. The
undergraduate boy and girl have
greater freedom in their friends and
associations and their social life and
leisure. They form a community that
enjoys a special prestige with the
authorities and society.
At first sight this community might
appear to be a privileged group with
close ties with the powers that be
(and the advantages inherent therein)
but in actual fact it is more inclined
to dissent than any other sector of
the youth population.
The realization of a student's long-
held dream of entering a university
emboldens him to raise his voice
about society in a way that he never
would have dared before. He is
impatient for his country to reach the
level of development of the indus¬
trialized nations and to attain social
justice which he now feels to be vital
to his family and school environment.
He therefore by no means rejects
the affluent and consumer society as
do many European and American
students. Instead, this is what he
yearns for along with greater equality
and justice.
By the same token he pleads for a
more dynamic educational system
offering a richer, less academic and
more flexible curriculum.
Student participation in political life
is nothing new in the developing
countries. Since 1945, the students
of Africa, and especially of Asia and
the Middle East where the university
has a long history, have formed the
most dynamic movements in the
struggle for independence.
In India, after 20 years of indepen¬
dence, and despite students' complete
freedom to express their grievances
and opposition on political and other
matters, an entirely new type of protest
movement has been born in univer¬
sities In the past two years. In the
summer of 1968, the most famous and
best equipped university of India, in
New Delhi, was the scene of violent
student demonstrations calling for the
complete revamping of the spirit and
structure of higher education.
Latin American bastions of libe¬
ration. The students of Latin America
have been a powerful force in society,
fully conscious of their important role,
ever since 1918 when the Charter of
Cordoba was promulgated in Argen¬
tina, establishing the principle of uni¬
versity autonomy.
The universities, along with their
teachers and students, have been the
bastions of liberal ideas and ratio¬
nalism opposed to official clericalism.
The university reforms proposed by
the students always comprised broad
general elements aiming at the reform
of society too.
During the past few years university
enrolment has risen so sharply in Latin
America that Argentina, for example,
now boasts almost the same percen¬
tage (10 per cent) of young people
between 18 and 24 as the highly
industrialized countries.
But career opportunities for univer¬
sity graduates remain a major preoc¬
cupation of students, and many Argen¬
tine scientists and specialists, for
instance, have abandoned their own
country to seek employment abroad.
Throughout Latin America, free
tuition on the one hand, the shortage
of vocational training schools and lack
of career opportunities on the other,
leave youth only one hope the uni¬
versity. But the universities are over¬
crowded, inadequately adapted to
economic and social realities and
suffer from outmoded teaching
methods. The students are not blind
to this and their concern about the
quality of instruction and their own
future is compounded with their exasp¬
eration towards society.
Thus in Latin America, where the
university's prestige is enormous both
socially and culturally, where it has
acquired a student body of tremendous
size, the temper is toward a renewal
of all institutions and a new mode of
political and social life.
The African dilemma. The problem
is quite different in Africa where most
of the countries have recently become
independent. Most of Africa's leaders
(especially in Negro Africa) are young
and were educated in European uni¬
versities 10 to 15 years ago.
Here the conflict of generations is
apparently not as acute. However, the
career problem that worries university
graduates in Latin America, India and
Egypt is just beginning to affect young
African graduates. What is needed
now above all is a system of national
education that can operate outside the
framework of foreign aid which at
present is so extensive. There is also
the complicated and paramount prob¬
lem of the many languages of Africa
that remains to be resolved.
Conclusion. In dealing with cultural
problems, including the problem of
youth, the rich, developed countries
have perhaps been too inclined to rely
on technology to the neglect of social
tensions and the new cultural needs
created by this technology. For as a
result of technical progress the young
in the developing countries now have
leisure, time to think, time to become
informed, time to give free reign to
their imagination and their critical
faculties.
In the developing countries, the
population explosion and with it the
ascendency of youth have brought
about a complete rejuvenation of
society and an upheaval in its struc¬
tural patterns and habits.
First and foremost, it is the edu¬
cational system at all levels that is
under fire. Because of its narrow
academic formalism and its dogmatic
approach to culture, the teaching of
today no longer corresponds to the
needs of the modern world.
The most significant factor that is
revealed by a careful study of the
present crisis of youth viewed as a
whole is the emergence of a totally
new concept of values. Behind this
ferment lies a feeling of fellowship
uniting all of the world's youth,
transcending all political, economic
and social barriers or differences.
This is the reason the present crisis
is no longer a problem for educators
alone. The psychologist, the socio¬
logist and the philosopher are equally
involved. For its complexity and
compass englobe the whole of society
and indeed all civilization.
