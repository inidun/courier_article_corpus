Seyyed Hossein Nasr*: Be, and there is
“Science by its very nature can deal only with one level of existence, physical
existence. Science also relies on the study of events in time and space. The
scientist therefore pushes towards the beginning, but find its impossible to
get to the beginning itself since it is beyond material existence and beyond
the spatial or temporal.In contrast,most religions—with exceptions, such as
Confucianism—have spoken about the origin of the universe.
Those who accept the religious point of view, such as myself, can say a great
deal about the origins of the universe. We believe that the reality which
brought the universe into being has also sent us a revelation in knowledge of
the origin of that universe. In the case of Islam, this revelation comes first of
all from the Koran, which describes the creation of the universe as coming
from the word of God, recounted in the very famous verse of Chapter 36 in
which God says “Be, and there is.”
Until the 17th century, science from East to West was aimed at studying the
traces of God’s wisdom in his creation. But the Cartesian philosophy that
undergirds the scientific revolution created a division between the knowing
subject and the known object: modern science considered its goal to be the
study of pure quantity, and tore away all qualitative aspects of nature—all
its spiritual elements.
Every ten years there are new cosmological theories and views. But I do not
really take these to be steps towards understanding the ultimate structure of
the universe since we are dealing with so many unknowns. It’s as if you knew
one inch of a line and extrapolated it straight to the moon.”
