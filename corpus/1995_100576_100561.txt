ft Why do you make films?
Because I can't do anything else!
Making films is something I have to
do. It's like dreaming: it comes natu¬
rally, it fulfils a need. The driver of an
Underground train who spends hours
travelling through the dark tunnels
dreams all the time. While they're in
prison, convicts dream of the world
outside. Blind people see by means of
dreams. Life is impossible without
dreams, and thanks to the cinema I
can give shape to some of mine and
let others share them. A link with other
people is made through my dreams.
It's a strange kind of pleasure, com¬
municating with people I don't know
and can't see but who can see my
dreams. . . .
All artists yearn to communicate. It
makes them ill if they can't share their
dreams. I must be one of these
people. This need links me to my audi¬
ences and, first and foremost, to my
actors. During filming, and because of
it, I empathize so strongly with the
actors that they become part of me.
The relationship becomes so intense
that when shooting is over I find it
impossible to part company with
them. That's why my film Where is the
Friend's Home? (1987) had two
sequels, And life goes on ... (1 992)
and Under the Olive Trees (1 994), and
will be continued in my future films. I
am so fond of the region where these
three films were made and the people
who live there that I am in no hurry to
move on.
What happens behind the camera
gives me just as much pleasure as
what happens in front of it. Behind it,
one catches life unawares; in front,
everything is planned and organized,
even the actors' feelings and move¬
ments. Everything Is subordinated to
technical requirements. The equip¬
ment, the constraints of photography,
the overpowering presence of the
crew and especially of the director, all

affect the actors' attitudes. The liveli¬
ness and excitement that are to be
found behind the camera often dry
up, fade away and die in front of it.
We should have to get rid of the film
crew and all their paraphernalia before
the actors' performance could be the
real thing, a true reflection of their
identity. Only then could their complex
inner life become visible.
People do not know themselves
until they get to know their own
repressed desires. They have to be
revealed to themselves. Before any
transformation can take place, we
have to know our own legitimate
needs, which originate in dreams. Our
dreams grow out of the bitter experi¬
ence of daily life, which they
endeavour to transcend by seeking a
life of their own.
The cinema can provide a window
looking out from the mediocrity of life
on to the world of dreams. Reality is
the launching pad for dreams. Every¬
thing must start from reality, just as
you launch a kite into the wind but
hold on to the strings. The kite-strings
lead us to reality. We enter the dream
world and come back to real life.
After dreaming, reality may seem
easier to bear, since the change of
scene has brought an influx of energy
and alleviated the sufferings of
everyday existence. On the other
hand, reality may seem intolerable,
uglier and more oppressive than
before a dead end. If this is the case,
then we must change reality. We
follow our dream until reality is trans¬
formed into dream and dream into
reality.
ft What difficulties are
Iranian film-makers
facing today?
First of all, the same difficulties as
those faced by film-makers the world
over. No director can be sure his or her
film will be a success. Generally
speaking, producers want to back a
good film, a quality film, but above all
a money-spinner and there's never
any guarantee of that. One of the
hardest things is to win a producer's
confidence.
The difficulties specific to Iran, an
Islamic country, are the limits imposed
by religion. We film-makers are great
liars; we create lies to suggest truths.
We bring in a man from one place and
a woman from another, and select a
particular house and a particular child
to present a true picture of a family. But
if the woman has to get out of bed
wearing a veil, I am the first to find the
scene implausible. I live in an Islamic
society and my family are Muslims, but
neither my sister nor my wife wear
headscarves in bed. So far I have man¬
aged to avoid this kind of scene which
gives a false picture of reality, but
because of these restrictions many
subjects are automatically ruled out.
ft Is that one of the reasons
why you work with
children?
Not at all. I like working with chil¬
dren. It started quite by chance and
then I came to like having them
around. They are at ease in front of
the camera. They are not thinking
about fame or money. They are
amenable.
ft No American films are
allowed to be distributed
in Iran. What do you think
of this ban?
It's both a good thing and a bad
thing: good for Iranian film-makers,
who are protected from competition
from American films and have been
able to make films and win the appre¬
ciation of cinema-goers; bad for
Iranian audiences, who can never see
American pictures at the cinema. The
situation clearly has both negative and
positive aspects, negative because
any ban is undesirable but positive as
regards the protection of the Iranian
film industry.
ft Doesn't the fact that
people regularly watch
foreign films on video
stop them going to the
cinema?
There is a certain class of people
who no longer go to the cinema, who
are video consumers. The cassettes
are of poor quality. They are recorded
abroad direct from television sets and
distributed in Iran.
The recent Introduction of satellite
television has created a flagrant con¬
tradiction between what people,
young people in particular, see at
home and what they see outside the
home. To take one example, children
are not allowed to go to school in
jeans but at home my son can see, on
satellite television, images of freedom
that constantly conflict with life in Iran.
This contradiction is psychologically
harmful and wounding for him. It is
sad for a film-maker like me to end up
saying that it would be better if we
didn't have satellite dishes in Iran.
When a balance cannot be struck
between the inside and outside, you
have to do as best you can, so my

son and I agreed that we should shut
the television set away in a locked
cupboard. But I know that my heart is
locked in that cupboard too. While I
was out, he opened the cupboard
and plugged the set back in.
ft Who goes to the cinema in
Iran?
Ordinary people, the man in the
street, the people from the bazaars
what we call the "third class" but also
middle-class people. A film currently
showing in Tehran, The Red Hat and
the Cousin, is breaking all box-office
records. Its success proves that people
need to go to the cinema to be enter¬
tained. They don't go to keep up with
developments in the art of cinematog¬
raphy or to be preached at.
ft Let's go back to your work
with children. . .
Working with children has helped
me In my private life more than in my
professional life. Children know less
than adults but they have a healthier
attitude to life. I've made the best pos¬
sible deal with them: I've provided
them with knowledge and they've
brought me health. Children have
taught me to live. They are budding
mystics.
ft The Chinese philosopher
Lao-tze was nicknamed
"the old child» . . .
When I had a real problem I would
put it to my younger son, who always
had a magnificent answer. They have
an answer to everything: "So what?"
It's great. You present them with ter¬
rible disasters and they reply "So
what?" You tell a child "Wrap up well
or you'll catch cold" and he replies
"So what?", "You'll get wet""So
what?", "You'll have a temperature"
"So what?"
When times are hardest they
answer your questions without hesi¬
tation. They stop what they're doing
for a moment and come out with their
"So what?", then go back to their
game. Like the Sufi mystics, they take
advantage of the moment, they live in
the present, the here and now. I
believe the definition of mystics also
fits children. There are budding mys¬
tics all around us and we don't appre¬
ciate them.
ft Apart from children, you
like to work with non¬
professional actors,
mostly from rural
backgrounds. How much
difference does appearing
in a film make to their
lives?
Financially speaking, their situation
Is improved but you need to get very
close to them to know how much they
may have changed Inside. Maybe it
harms their ego, as some Iranian jour¬
nalists have claimed they become a
focus of attention for a short while and
then all of a sudden they are forgotten.
But I have no choice in the matter, I
can't re-engage the same children all
the time. When I feel guilty about this, I
try to imagine how I would feel in their
shoes. Would I refuse a pleasant
dream, knowing that when I awoke
life's difficulties would still be there?
No, I would be prepared to make the
trip. . . .
ft What is the first image
you remember seeing on
film?
The roaring Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
lion, in 1950, when I was ten. But I
also played with bits of film when I
was small. I thought they were stamps
that had to be looked at against the
light. . . .
ft How did you get into film¬
making?
By chance. I studied at the Tehran
Faculty of Fine Arts, designed adver¬
tising posters and illustrated children's
books. In 1969 I was asked to do
some work for the Institute for the
Intellectual Development of Children
and Adolescents. I worked with ama¬
teurs on my first film, Bread and the
Street (1970). It's the story of a child
who buys some bread and wants to
go home but Is frightened by a dog in
the street. We didn't have a child actor
or a trained dog and I was a novice
myself. We three non-professionals
got together, and that became a kind
of model for my later work.
