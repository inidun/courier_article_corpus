In the interior of . Indo-China,
isolated by the high mountains of
Viet-Nam, lives a primitive people
called the Mois. Primarily farmers,
their life depends on their rice crops.
To propitiate the "'good spirits" of
the rice harvest, one of the tribes, the
Sedang, has invented a unique music¬
al instrument, the construction of
which requires considerable know¬
ledge of music, mechanics and
hydraulics.
The instrument is a giant bamboo
carillon (1) actuated by running
water diverted into a bamboo tube
from a nearby stream (4). The con¬
tinuous power supply enables the
carillon to play uninterruptedly for
months at a time. The Sedang are
convinced that the rice spirits will be
pleased by the music played in their
honour and that the crop will be
; plentiful. They know too that the
: noise of the carillon will scare away
animals from the growing rice.
The carillon operates only during
the months of the rice season,
after which it Is abandoned. As
the Sedang tribe chooses a fresh plot
of land for rice growing each year,
a new carillon playing a different
tune is built.
The carillon of the Sedangs com¬
prises 50 bamboo pipes each of a
different length and thickness which
are struck by 50 hammers made of
bamboo. The pipes, which are some¬
times as much as 150 feet in length,
are suspended vertically in a frame¬
work measuring 50 feet by four feet.
The horizontal hammers are held
at one end by posts fixed in the
ground (3). The free ends of the
hammers are linked by cords to a
movable frame fixed overhead, which
is attached by a liana to a kind of
scoop placed under the tube of
running water.
When the scoop is filled with
water (4) it goes down and
swings over, pulling on the
cord which works the movable frame
and in turn on the fifty hammers
which simultaneously strike the
bamboo sounding pipes. A large
rock (5) acting as a counterpoise
immediately brings back the mov¬
able frame to its original position.
Thus a continuous movement is set
up. (The blurred effect in the centre
of photo N° 2 shows the movement
of the hammers). Each day the
"carillon master" comes to "tune" the
tubes and adjust the hammers (1).
