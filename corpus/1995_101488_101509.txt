INTERVIEW



YEHUDI
talks to Martine Leca
A former child prodigy, one of the
great violinists of the century,
Yehudi Menuhin has also
conducted, directed several music
festivals and founded a music
school in England. A man of peace,
he played for the Red Cross during
the Second World War and
continues to be a staunch defender
of human rights. From 1969 to 1975
he was president of Unesco's
International Music Council and is
presently a Unesco Goodwill
Ambassador. He recently created
the "Muse" project which seeks to
provide European children with
education for peace through music.
MARTINE LECA
is a French writer and journalist.
You gave your first concert at the
age of seven. How did you come to
terms with the gift that has taken you
so far?
I accepted it naturally. Later on,
daily practice of yoga in which the
body is like a root shooting simultane¬
ously skyward and into the earth
along with my fundamentally robust
nature, has kept me from going astray.
I was also certain that my music
helped to make the world a better
place. That was my first and most
abiding wish. My ambition was not to
become a virtuoso, a music-making
machine, but an intermediary who
could reveal the joy that exists in all
of us and lie receptive to others. My
soul has never been imprisoned by
the straitjacket of technique. On the
contrary, it is my Slav soul, with its
age-old wealth of instinct, that has
made me play naturally.
You have been called "the Mozart of
the violin". Has being a virtuoso
imposed constraints on you?
My father set himself the task of
helping me and looking after my
career. He had nothing in common
with Mozart's father, who was over¬
bearing and vain and presented his
genius of a son to the courts of France
and other European countries. My
court was and still is the public,
the people who come to uplift their
minds and souls so that they can
forget their everyday troubles. No,
learning to play the violin was never
an imposition for me.
The route from the head to the
heart must always be direct. When, at
the age of seven, I held my first violin,
this route was already mapped out
within me. I owe this rigour, these stan¬
dards that governed my childhood, to
my upbringing and to my nature. Later
I discovered a more carefree attitude
to life, because my teacher
Eneseu1 taught me to play unsystem-
atically, intuitively. I became known as
a young virtuoso. I went from concert
to concert, pursued by the desire to
float like a balloon and discover the
marvellous lightness of being.
However, the lightness I was
46

looking for was concealed by a sensa¬
tion of heaviness. It took me twenty
years to feel the weight of one finger
and to understand the relationship of
music which comes from the soul
to the muscles. I then realized that
technique must take a spiritual
course which involves the body. The
body is a noble thing: it should be
given life through dance, singing and
music, and not be crucified. Some
civilizations have understood this,
others not.
Art develops the intellectual,
physical, imaginative and sensory
spheres, and hence all human poten¬
tial. We use only part of our capabili¬
ties because education does not go to
the source. As a source of equilib¬
rium and tolerance, music should be
brought into the schools as a form of
self-fulfilment, a new philosophy,
especially in primary schools, with the
participation of monitors, musicians,
specialists and composers. Musical
education, which has hitherto been
regarded as an optional subject, can
change people's social behaviour.
Why in primary schools rather than
at other levels?
Music encourages revelation, a
sense of union with others and with
our environment. It enables us to
interpret our relationship with the
earth's rhythms and express emotions
like joy and pain. In remedying the
evils of a society blighted by con¬
sumerism and the excesses of materi¬
alism, children are in a way our
teachers and redeemers. Because
they are so genuine, they react imme¬
diately to encouragement and atten¬
tion. Schools nowadays often bring
together children from different
ethnic backgrounds. An exchange of
memories, cultures and sensibilities is
encouraged by this diversity because
children, by nature, do not succumb
to the temptation of rejecting others
on ethnic grounds.
They succumb to it when they are
adults, depending on how narrow-
minded they become or on the cre¬
dence they give to false information
for xenophobia is a falsehood and is
based on myths. The adult in us kills
the child. Now the child must teach

the adult. Musicians, composers and
well-intentioned teachers must iden¬
tify with children, respect them, and
not deceive them by giving false
answers, by evasiveness or silence. A
driver must know that the road is his
guide and that he must adapt his driv¬
ing to the road, not to his idea of it.
There can be no mistaking a straight
stretch for a bend in the road.
You say that you have retained a
childlike naivety and freshness. What is
your recipe for this?
Quite simply, I have never let
myself give in to negative ideas, the
lugubriousness and hand-wringing
which poison our society. I prefer
happiness. And so, I have no diffi¬
culty in projecting myself into the
feelings of hundreds of millions of
children, into their games and into
their suffering. Since these children
are the continuity of humanity, they
should be given a hearing. They are a
living source that will help us to
recreate ourselves. In a sense, this
infanticidal adult world of ours
deserves the punishment it inflicts on
itself, like the scorpion that dies from
its own sting. In periods of so-called
peace a word that to my mind no
longer corresponds to reality the
world spends its energy preparing for
future wars.
Do you think that music is capable
of changing human relations, of
turning people towards peace?
Sharing is the best guarantee of
47

peace. We must encourage every¬
thing such as music and the arts
that encourages sharing and exclude
everything that destroys or harms the
growth of harmony between people.
During the Second World War, I
often played for the troops: it was my
form of resistance. The faces of those
men who had stared death in the face
and who would perhaps die the next
day, shone with a kind of ecstasy, the
ecstasy that is within our reach, if
only we want to grasp it and pass it
on. Music is the antidote to crimi¬
nality. Musicians will never be crimi¬
nals, nor will those who practise the
martial arts, because they purge
themselves of all their negative
impulses. The energy that flows into
them amplifies and enriches their
relationship with the world and with
other people.
Our times don't teach the higher,
transcendent things. But music and
singing can do so. Singing brings
people together; it harmonizes body
and mind. It unites people with others
We all have considerable
reserves of energy which
remain untapped or are
repressed or even
spoiled, in particular
because of the very
Western obsession with
material things. Our worst
actions are dictated to us
by a desire for security
and by fear.
and creates a symbiosis. Everybody has
to adapt to the rhythm and the notes.
This produces a collective effect on
the emotions and the intellect. Music
and singing have nothing to do with
consumerism; they are part of life.
Are you set apart from the world by
the ecstasy and sublimation you experi¬
ence when you play?
Any work of art, or any interpreta¬
tion of a work of art, is bound to be
executed outside real life and time.
Twentieth-century theatre seeks to
render the world's tragedy expres-
sionistically, to show us real blood
being shed and people's real-life
occupations. Even if it wishes to be
close to the real world, art cannot
coincide with it. Hence the need for
sublimation.
Emotions must be distilled. Mozart
could make people hear and see ter¬
rible events which, through the filter
of art, they could listen to in their
drawing-rooms and be profoundly
moved. If art gets involved in repro¬
ducing reality on stage, it becomes a
kind of television news broadcast. Art
has better things to do. It performs a
redeeming function. The artist's role
is to guide human beings, who arc too
wrapped up in material things,
towards ecstasy. In other words, to
take social beings out of themselves
and unite them to the work of art,
which expresses the intense experi¬
ence of the artist. This is the nature of
the link with the public: a shared
ecstasy created in a spirit of abnega¬
tion. You want to enwrap the audi¬
ence in the the beauty and calm of the
detachment that takes hold of you. It
is the joy of feeling a natural sense of
ecstasy at a time when artificial forms
of ecstasy are so fashionable.
I have always liked to experience
this sublime feeling and spread it
round me. It is a paradoxical state
which is at the same time very real
and yet detached from the present.
The Russians experience this state in
their everyday lives it is how they
transcend themselves. They have a
gift for drama. Their daily lives have
always been so steeped in sadness
and horror that they escape from it
into the world of art, which lifts them
out of distress and gives them life.
When they sing, dance and play they
draw on the drama of their daily lives
which they transmute with incredible
intensity and force.
I travelled with Russians during
the war. Singing and reciting poems
was their form of resistance. It was the
expression of a spontaneous culture
which had nothing to do with school;
it was born of pain but also of
indomitable hope. The survivors of
the concentration camps have set us
the same example: considering their
physical and mental exhaustion, it is
impossible to explain how some of
them went on living. These people
struggled and survived. My parents,
who were Russian Jews, personified
this blend of deep melancholy and
dogged hope.
Is this mystery, which seems such
an important part of your make-up, reli¬
gious in origin?
No. I feel its presence above all in
the space we call reality, but which is
to some extent beyond us. We do not
know what existed before we were
born or what will come to pass after
we die. So we look for ways of cre¬
ating ecstasy that are capable of liber¬
ating the mind from the body. But the
body is not an impediment to the soul.
On the contrary, everything hinges on
mastering its rhythms and its breath.
I have achieved my relationship
with the world without religion,

Congrès in Paris in 1993.
through a sort of cosmic complicity
with the world that weaves its web
around me and in me and which I
weave like everyone else. Religions
create bonds between those who
practise them, but I dread the
excesses of adoration to which they
give rise. Human beings in search of
an existential support have the keys
of their freedom within them. Individ¬
uals are the threads of this cosmic
web, which is of divine essence. This
attitude seems to me to be truer,
closer to the human scheme of things
than any form of religious worship.
We all have considerable reserves
of energy which remain untapped or
are repressed or even spoiled, in par¬
ticular because of the very Western
obsession with material things. Our
worst actions are dictated to us by a
desire for security and by fear. Ide¬
ally, we should root out these evils,
which are within us. If we cannot
manage to do so, we might at least
adopt a conciliatory attitude, which
would not necessarily mean giving up
our resistance and determination. It is
a question of striking a balance.
There's no point in trying to smash a
brick wall by knocking your head
against it. Thought and mental energy
can do the job.
So, as I grow older, I get pleasure
from feeling light, freed from the
burden of having to take sides. The
only thing that interests me is a harmo¬
nious centre that is flexible and strong,
stronger than the sum of the parts.
This very simple arithmetic ought to
suit societies whose centre is yielding
under the pressure of extremes.
You are a fervent adept of yoga.
What part does it play in your attitude
to the world?
Yoga is a source of balance
between earth, heaven and the self, a
source of fusion not only with human
beings but with animals, plants and
the cosmos as a whole. It enables me
to play by introducing the heartbeat
of life and to understand intuitively

what a composer is trying to say. For
instance, Bach's "Chaconne", which I
regard as the finest piece ever written
for solo violin, admits neither gratu¬
itous ornamentation nor aggressive¬
ness. It is a work that demands nerves
of steel. Human beings are like
Bach's "Chaconne". They have to be
capable of settling their own differ¬
ences, balancing their opposites and
negotiating their transformations, all
the deaths and rebirths which are
constantly changing them.
Do you have a political philosophy?
Politics captivates crowds which
are taken in by the illusion of speech.
I believe that all politicians should
have a job outside politics. Politicians
who were also cobblers, cooks or gar¬
deners, who had direct experience of
their country at every level, would
be head and shoulders above today's
politicians. They would be really
useful to their fellow citizens. I
