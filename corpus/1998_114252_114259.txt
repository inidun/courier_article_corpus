The importance of the weightless economy
can be assessed at three levels.We can look at
individuals, firms and entire economies.
F i rst people. In 1997, three of the wo r l d ’s
twenty wealthiest individuals were Americans who
made their money almost entirely from software.
Their total wealth was almost ten times as much
t h at of the three wealthiest Britons invo l ved in more
t a n gible production (real estat e ,s t e e l , and food). I n
October 1998, the wo r l d ’s wealthiest individual (in
s o f t ware) was more than twice as we a l t hy as the
runner-up, who was not in software.
Next turn to firm s. As the historical vo l at i l i t y
of stock markets powerfully show s ,g a u ging the eco-
nomic success or failure of individual firms is diffi-
cult in general. H owe ve r , ave r a ging stock market
performance over longer time periods and across
individual firms in sectors of interest can gi ve a
more reliable picture.The five major information
and communications technology (ICT) firms that
an interested observer would be likely to name are
M i c r o s o f t , I n t e l , C o m p a q , D e l l , and Cisco. B e t-
ween them, these firms had market capitalization of
$12 billion in 1987. By 1997, their combined capi-
t a l i z ation amounted to $600 billion—a fif t y - f o l d
increase over less than ten ye a rs or annual gr owth of
45 per cent.Such rapid growth,sustained for such
a long stretch of time, is remarkable by compari s o n
with any other economic quantity.
F i n a l l y, consider countri e s. In the United
S t at e s , the inform ation technology (IT) share of
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has gr ow n
from 4.9 per cent in 1985 to 8.2 per cent in 1997.
At the same time, IT prices have fallen dramat i-
c a l l y : the real price of computing has, by some mea-
sures,been declining by 30 per cent a year for the
last two decades.The real price of communicat i o n s
has,similarly, been decreasing at 8 per cent a year
for the last seventy years, a halving every eight to
nine ye a rs. And disk storage capacity has been
Information and communications technology is transforming 
the world and producing ‘knowledge products’ to which traditional
economic principles do not apply

What is the weightless
economy?
The weightless economy—also described as the knowledge economy, the intangible economy,
the immaterial economy or simply the “ n e w ” economy—comprises four main elements. F i r s t ,
there is information and communications technology (ICT) and the Internet. S e c o n d , intellectual pro-
p e r t y, which includes not only patents and copyrights but more broadly, b ra n d - n a m e s, t ra d e m a r k s,
a d v e r t i s i n g ,financial and consulting services,financial exchanges,health care (medical knowledge),
and education. The third element consists of  electronic libraries and databases, including new
m e d i a , video entertainment, and broadcasting.The fourth element comprises biotechnology, t ra d i-
tional libraries and databases, and pharmaceuticals.
These four elements constitute the fastest-growing sectors in modern economies—whe-
ther measured in value added or employment and job growth. Everything on the list contains ele-
ments of intangibility and can be regarded as knowledge.
H o w e v e r, we should not over-emphasize the importance of ideas and knowledge in trying to
understand the weightless economy. Economies have been knowledge-based for at least five
thousand years. Sumerians in the Mesopotamian river basin began carving cuneiform financial
records onto clay tablets 5,000 years back. During the first Industrial Revolution, deploying spin-
ning Jennies and steam engines significantly boosted economic performance. Such machines
were the physical embodiment of new knowledge.
But while steam engines or clay tablets are physical objects which contain knowledge, they
do not resemble knowledge in their use. Their uses are bound by geographical and physical
constraints. An oil supertanker is not part of the weightless economy, but computer software is.

The impact of an image is not diminished 
the more people look at it.
t ring pieces of the weightless economy know l e d g e -
p r o d u c t s. This emphasizes their symbolic simila-
rity to knowledge but, at the same time, maintains
their distinctness.There are three points to bear in
mind.
F i rs t , like know l e d g e ,k n owledge-products show
i n finite expansibility (a term due ori ginally to T h o-
mas Je f f e rs o n ) .They do not get used up, p hy s i c a l l y.
The usefulness of computer software is not reduced
the more users run it.A d ve rtising imagery does not
diminish in impact the more people view it; i n d e e d ,
the opposite holds.
The same terminology is apt for how a know-
l e d g e - p r o d u c t — u n l i k e , s ay, a typical durable
good—disrespects geographical distance.A know-
ledge-product behaves as if it expands to fill all ava i-
lable space. I can, in London, use a piece of softwa r e
l o c ated on some satellite server encircling the eart h
while someone else in Stanford, C a l i f o rn i a , d o e s
exactly the same, with the identical piece of soft-
wa r e .This holds true for any intellectual property or
libraries and databases. It does not apply for,say, a
c h o c o l ate-chip cookie. When someone eats a
cookie,it is no more.
S e c o n d , like know l e d g e , k n ow l e d g e - p r o d u c t s
s h ow superstar dynamics. To understand this,
consider first the wheel. Society does not rewa r d
reinvention of the wheel, but multiple implemen-
t ations of (the idea of) a wheel do get properly com-
p e n s at e d . H owe ve r , those multiple instances are
fashioned out of hard physical material which the
buyer pays for.
Knowledge-products,by contrast,are the idea
and implementation rolled in one—multiple imple-
m e n t ations require no physical mat e ri a l . Fo r
e x a m p l e , the fastest way to appreciate an idea in
computer software is to see that software running;
the only way to value the contents of a computer
d atabase is to access the database itself; the only
way to understand a gene sequence is to see it
expressed in a lifeform.In short, we cannot distin-
guish between the product and the idea behind it.
In this context, reproductions of an ori gi n a l
k n owledge-product should fetch zero price in a we l l -
functioning market. S u p e rstar dynamics refers to
this first-(or winner)-takes all characteristic shared by
both knowledge and know l e d g e - p r o d u c t s.
However,this zero-price property does not say
t h at knowledge-products are va l u e l e s s : water is
essential to human we l fa r e , but its price in modern
societies is, for all practical purp o s e s ,z e r o. B u n d l i n g
water with something else—adding carbonation to
wat e r , extracting it from certain distinguished
springs, associating it with a powerful advertising
image—can, of course, be a rewarding enterprise.
Businesses can and do add va l u e , similarly to many
k n owledge-products in the weightless economy.
For example, the value that the Nike shoe company
g e n e r ates is not the raw mat e rial in its shoes, but the
culture associated with them. The value that the
c o n s u l t a n cy firm JP Morgan generates by gi v i n g
away its raw data is not in the data itself but in the
bundling of that inform ation with a part i c u l a r
financial perspective—and who better to continue
to develop that perspective than JP Morgan itself.
For many software companies,rewards don’t lie in
the software itself, but the services provided and
the organizing of a community of users.
Labs for producing
intellectual property
T h i r d , like know l e d g e , k n ow l e d g e - p r o d u c t s
h ave a chain of production that is irr e c ove r a b l y
i n t ri c ate and uncert a i n . Applying more fa c t o r
inputs in an effort to increase output can be self-
defeating.Just as making nine men pregnant for a
month fails to produce a new-born baby, throwing
more programmers at a software project does not
typically make a complete piece of software faster,
b e t t e r , or more reliable. S i m i l a r l y, financial consul-
t i n g, a musical composition, or devising the cen-
tral image in an advertising campaign calls not for
m a ny hands, but few. The same dynamic applies
with scientific discoveries; many researchers work
on the same problem to reach the same discovery
simultaneously.
These three properties imply that the way bu s i-
nesses operate should change and that appropri at e
g ove rnment policies will need to acknowledge those
changes. As a first step, one might think of econo-
mies comprised entirely of knowledge-products—
weightless economies—as being like large labora-
tories for producing intellectual property broadly
defined.The problem is that the systems of intel-
lectual property for organizing patents and copy-
rights are based on principles and conceptions
which no longer apply in the weightless economy.
The question is not whether a new set of market
rules has emerged, but the ways in which people,
governments and firms can respond to them. ■
