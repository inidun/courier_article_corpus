Training the
technicians
of the new
atomic age

ten-year-old graphite reactor. Since 1948,
Oak Ridge has given instruction courses in
peaceful uses of the atom to well over 1,000
scientists, technicians and engineers both from
the U.S.A. and other countries. The wide appli¬
cation of atomic energy for peaceful purposes
will involve large-scale training of scientists
and engineers, and also broad educational
campaigns to create an understanding of the
atom and its peaceful uses.

The atomic power project of the
United Nations carries a promise
of great and real boons, even of
an effective social revolution in many
lands. But a closer view reveals its
magnitude and complexity. It is not
merely a matter of the distribution of
nuclear' fuels and the building of
atomic furnaces. Those powerful new
forces need to be understood and
managed by many men in many
nations who are fully trained in their
erudite principles and their intricate
and dangerous techniques.
Yet the heritage of war and the
years of secrecy have given only a few
countries adequate knowledge in this
field while most countries
have little or none. It is
obvious that the engineer¬
ing and production opera¬
tions must be preceded by
a period of intensive
training and education in
those countries that are to
participate. Several years
of preparatory education
may well be needed.
Even in the early United
Nations debate this was
made clear by Mr. Paul
Martin, the Canadian de¬
legate, who said:
"The most immediate
need is for information and
training to spread the technology
required for the application of atomic
energy for peaceful purposes on a wide
scale. It would be visionary to
imagine that if by this time next
year the international agency had been
set up it would shortly thereafter be
in a position to start exporting power
reactors, for instance, to various parts
of the world... I say this as plainly as
I can to prevent possible miscon¬
ceptions being followed by a certain
disillusionment.
"The Canadian Government does
hope, however, that the agency,
when established, would assist other
countries participating in the agency's
programme to set up their own
research reactors and to
join with those countries
already possessing them in
pressing forward with the
search for developing ato¬
mic power on an economic
basis and with the whole
range of other actual and
potential applications of
atomic energy for peaceful
purposes.
"And in order to con¬
struct reactors and carry
on useful creative research
in this field, not only is it
necessary to have the
technical information on
the subject much of it
already available but one
must also have scientists,
and technicians trained at least to
some degree in the use and inter¬
pretation of these extremely compli¬
cated research tools.
"For this reason we believe that the
agency not only should foster the in¬
terchange of information on peaceful
uses but should facilitate where
possible the arrangements which will
have to be made for those countries
which wish to set up research reactors
to have their people suitably trained.
The agency should, in fact, encourage
world-wide research and development
and should, in addition, be in a position
to arrange for the nuclear materials
which will be needed for this purpose.
In this connexion I may say that

engineers
Canada would be a potential source not
only of information but of raw material
and fissile material."
But the United States had an¬
ticipated this need. Mr. Henry Cabot
Lodge, the United States delegate
explained what the United States is
prepared to do in 1955, even in advance
of the establishment of the new
international agency. He said in part:
"No one has to be a scientist to
appreciate the fact that basic to
success in the development and use
of power-producing reactors in any
country is the existence of a body of
trained technical men.
"We are prepared to establish a
reactor training school
early in 1955. The first
course of this school would
deal not only with atomic
power theory, but also with
the application of that
theory. Our present plans
call for inviting between
thirty and fifty scientists
and engineers from over¬
seas to study practical
reactor engineering, in
order to furnish sufficient
basic science and engineer¬
ing knowledge to permit
the members of this group
not only to understand the
theory, but also to become
competent to operate
reactors...
"Second comes the field of safety.
Because we are dealing with a power
which is both a danger and a boon, it
is necessary also that special training
courses in radiation safety and
medicine should be instituted simul¬
taneously with any training in atomic
power development. We propose,
therefore, to establish under the spon¬
sorship of the United States Atomic
Energy Commission the following
courses, vJhich will be open to all other
nations; Industrial Medicinea one-
to-two-year course... concerned with
atomic energy activity; Industrial
Hygienecourses in the techniques of
maintaining healthful conditions in
industries dealing with
hazardous atomic ma¬
terials; Radiological Physics
and the theory and use of
radiation instruments...
"Third in our training
programme comes the vast
field of atomic biology and1
medicine. The A r g o n n e
Cancer Hospital at the
University of Chicago, the
Brookhaven National Labo¬
ratory, and the Cancer
Research Hospital at the
Oak Ridge Institute of
Nuclear Studies will be
open for one to two-year
courses on the use of ato¬
mic energy in medicine
and biology, for approximately five to
ten foreign students per course.
"The field of cancer is so important,
and other countries have made such
strides, that we do not wish to restrict
our collaboration simply to the study of
our techniques. We are therefore
prepared to invite as many as 150
competent and distinguished visitors
in the field of cancer research from
overseas to visit our cancer research
facilities during 1955. These guests
will not only be free to study our
facilities and techniques, but will also
be encouraged to exchange views with
our doctors and scientists.
"Fourth and last in our training

ATOMIC BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Recently the United States an¬
nounced that several of its
research centres where atomic
energy is used in biology and
medicine are to be opened to
foreign students. In the vast
field of atomic biology and
medicine, in which training pro¬
grammes are being developed
today, a vital role is played
by radio-isotopes. These are
vital elements both in healing
and research. Photographs on
these pages show examples
.of atomic biological research
whose results will help doctors
in all lands to fight disease. In
the Division of Biological and
Medical Research at the Argonne
National Laboratory, U.S.A., an
X-ray (above, left) shows a bone cancer loca¬
ted on the second lumbar vertebrae of a mo jse.
This is part of an experiment to determine
the levels of various isotopes that, if absorbed
internally in sufficiently large doses, might
ultimately produce cancers or other injury.
The isotope used here is strontium-90 (a
bone seeker). At Brookhaven National Labo¬
ratory, U.S.A., students can follow studies of
nutrition and disease control (above, right) in
which animals are fed or injected with different
radio-active elements. These can be traced
by the rays given off through the most complex
chemical body processes. At the Radium
Institute in Paris (below, left) the quantity of
radio-active carbon (C 14) in the blood of a
living mouse is tested. Tagged (radio-active)
rimifon is injected. The experiment is sup¬
plemented by an examination of the mouse's
excretion. Drawing, below, indicates the
different phases of another experimental use'
of radio-active carbon. (Photos USIS)

programme comes the field of radio¬
isotope tracer techniques. In this
field, until now, the Atomic Energy
Commission has been able to conduct
only a limited training programme for
foreign scientists. The Commission is
now prepared to establish special
courses for foreign technicians to begin
early in 1955, these courses to cover a
four-week period and to be divided into
laboratory work, lectures on laboratory
experiments, and seminars on special
topics. The laboratory experiments
would cover the use of instruments, the
purification and separation of radio¬
active from inert materials, and the
application of various isotope tech¬
niques to airfields of research.
Vast flow of facts
ÇQ ry-iHE training courses we propose
I in safety, medicine and biology
. A would bring basic - knowledge
and training to more than 250
technical men from other nations
in the course of the next twelve
to fifteen months the limitation on
numbers, let me add, being imposed
not by our desire to restrict the sharing
of this knowledge, but simply by our
ability to absorb this number of
observers, students and trainees effec¬
tively and efficiently within our present
facilities.
"So much for our early plans for
training. Closely allied to this is the
question of written information about
the atom. We anticipate that from the
outset the international agency will
carry on a series of information and
service activities, obtaining information
from the operations of member states
in connexion with their own atomic
energy programmes and from the
agency's own activities. Here is a brief
outline of the type of information
materials which the United States is
prepared to make available in 1955 to
the international agency, when set up.
"Contrary to popular belief, the
United States has, ever since the begin¬
ning of its atomic development, made
available through published documents
of the Atomic Energy Commission and
articles in scientific journals a vast
body of research material on the
peaceful uses of atomic energy... Up to
now, the publication by the United
States of documents available to all on
the peaceful uses of atomic energy
comes to more than 20,000 papers, to¬
talling more than 700,000 pages of data.
"Always mindful of the day when
it might be beneficial to present this
material in package form, despite the
fact that it has always.been available
in individual items, we have accumulat¬
ed ten complete libraries of our own
material, which we are prepared to
give to the principal technical libraries
of co-operating nations. And we shall
provide more than ten if there is a
demand for more. Besides these
libraries of our own material, we are
prepared to provide complete sets oí
index cards, and our journals of the

past seven years, abstracting 50,000
scientific and technical books and
reports published in all countries.
Stated in physical dimensions, what
we are prepared to furnish to each
one of these foreign libraries is the
equivalent of more than 300 lineal feet
of published reports and over 200,000
index cards.
- "Furthermore, we shall add to all of
these libraries as the material is
published, asking only in return that
the co-operating nations provide their
collections of official non-secret
papers, not available in the general
scientific literature, to be placed in the
appropriate U.S. libraries."
These proposals in technical training
are planned for 1955 without waiting
for the organization of the interna¬
tional atomic energy agency or even
for the United Nations scientific confé¬
rence. They are designed to save
at least a year in the development
programme. They should produce a
small body of experts who will return
to their own countries as authorities
ready to take responsibility for the
large developments to come. If and
when the international agency is
organized it may itself undertake to
continue this training programme.
Science and the schools
But the proposal assumes that com¬
petent men with a general back¬
ground in engineering, science or
medicine can be sent from many lands
for this specialized training. In the
future much larger numbers will be
required. This, in turn, means that
there must be a rather large increase in
the number of men who are trained at
home in the fundamental sciences and
in the principles and practice of en¬
gineering. It means that in many
countries both the scientific depart¬
ments of the universities and the
engineering schools will need to prepare
for a future in which thousands of
scientifically- and technically trained
men will find effective employment.
The improvement of science and
engineering teaching in the univer¬
sities is already a function of Unesco's
Department of Natural Sciences and is
a major item in the related programme
of Technical Assistance. With such
aid universities and engineering schools
will have to be enlarged and new ones
will have to be founded wherever the
atomic age is to become a reality.
Furthermore, in many countries the
universities and engineering schools,
though well equipped and well staf¬
fed, suffer from the lack of adequate
science instruction in the secondary
schools. Thus the demands of the
atomic energy programmes are cer¬
tain to reach into the general
educational programme also and to
stimulate a radical -improvement in
secondary-school science instruction.
Here again, it is the responsibility of
Unesco to foresee the need and to
extend its services in the improvement
and expansion of secondary-school
science teaching. The General Con¬
ference of Unesco, meeting at Montevi¬
deo in December, has authorized such
a development and a new Section of
Science Teaching has been established
in the Department of Natural Sciences.
