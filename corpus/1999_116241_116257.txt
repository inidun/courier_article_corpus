Dead-end seeds
yield a harvest of revolt 
n
It was a dream come true for seed
c o m p a n i e s. S p u rred by the ongoing
biotechnology revo l u t i o n , scientists have
d e veloped an innovat i ve technique enabling
companies to produce genetically altered seeds
t h at do not germ i n ate once fully gr ow n .T h e
r e s u l t : fa rm e rs who opt for these seeds will
h ave to buy them each time they plant a new
c r o p, opening a potential gold mine for the
seed companies.
The technique,k n own as the “ Te c h n o l o g y
Protection System” ( T P S ) , was jointly
p atented by the Delta and Pine Land (DPL)
seed company and the U. S .D e p a rtment of
A griculture (USDA) in March 1998. S e e d s
i n c o rp o r ating this technique are expected to
be commercialized by 2005. While the
i n n ovation is welcomed by seed
m a n u fa c t u r e rs , fa rm e rs in many deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries have been conducting campaigns
Fa r m e rs in developing countries are up in arms against a new technique

and staging protests—sometimes turning to
violence—against the T P S ,f e a ring the new
technique could be detrimental to their
i n t e r e s t s.
At present, except for some hy b rid crops
like cotton and canola, fa rm e rs do not usually
buy seeds for self-pollinating plants like wheat
and ri c e . Fa rm e rs in the developing wo r l d
consider it their “ ri g h t ” to save or exchange
s e e d s , a practice that has been followed for
more than 10,000 ye a rs.
According to the UN, more than 1.4
billion people, mainly resource-poor fa rm e rs ,
depend on fa rm - s aved seeds and seeds
exchanged with their neighbours as their
p ri m a ry seed source. C ritics say that steri l e
seeds are a serious threat to this group of
fa rm e rs ,a s s e rting that the innovation will
f u rther impove rish them.
“The introduction of any technology that
p r e vents fa rm e rs from keeping their own seeds
is not desirable.Fa rm e rs ’ rights include ‘ p l a n t
b a c k ’ ri g h t s.The TPS will certainly preve n t
this ri g h t ,” s ays Dr M. S . S wa m i n at h a n ,a n
eminent scientist who played a leading role
in India’s Green Revo l u t i o n .
In India, where 90 per cent of the 100
million fa rm e rs depend on saved seeds, fa rm
lobby groups are vehemently opposed to this
new technology entering local seed markets.
In the southern Indian state of Karn at a k a ,
e x p e rimental plots of genetically engi n e e r e d
crops belonging to Monsanto, one of the
wo r l d ’s leading seed companies, we r e
ransacked by a group of fa rm e rs last year in
the mistaken belief that they contained the new
s t e rile seed technology.A c t u a l l y, the test site
was for a pest-resistant hy b rid cotton seed
which had nothing to do with T P S .The public
o u t c ry forced the gove rnment to declare that it

countries, seeds are saved and resown year after

would not allow the technology to enter India.
Opposition to TPS has been gaining pace
in other parts of the developing world where
seed saving is an age-old custom. In a
s t atement to a conference held by the Fo o d
and A gricultural Organization (FAO) in 1998,
d e l e g ates from 20 A f rican countries said the
new technique poses a serious threat to food
s e c u ri t y,a f firming “it will destroy the dive rs i t y,
the local knowledge and the sustainable
a gricultural systems of A f rican fa rm e rs.”
S c i e n t i f i c a l l y, the TPS is considered a
milestone in biotechnology research.The new
method produces plants that bear sterile seeds
through an interp l ay between three
transplanted genes, one of which produces a
t oxin that kills seeds in their final stages of
d e ve l o p m e n t .C ritics howe ver refer to it as
“ t e rm i n ator technology” because of the
t e c h n i q u e ’s ability to neutralize a plant’s
g e rm i n ating capacity—a characteri s t i c
introduced for purely commercial reasons.
“The new technique is to protect U. S .
technology and seed pat e n t s ,”explains Melvin
O l i ve r , one of the USDA scientists who
i nvented the technology.The TPS is now being
tested on tobacco and cotton seeds which are
expected to enter the market by 2005.
When news of the term i n ator pat e n t
b r o k e , it sparked a multi-media debat e ,
especially on the Intern e t ,c o n c e rning the
ethics and social relevance of introducing the
TPS in developing countri e s.The USDA
r e c e i ved hundreds of e-mail letters from
around the world questioning the validity of
the new method.
Taken aback by the anti-sterile technology
c a m p a i g n ,Monsanto seed corp o r at i o n ,w h i c h
is in the process of acquiring DPL,a n n o u n c e d
in A p ril this year that it will not commercialize
the TPS until an independent intern at i o n a l
review of its env i r o n m e n t a l , economic and
social effects is completed.
In defending the T P S , seed companies
underline that it costs them between $30 and
$100 million to develop a high-yielding
genetically engineered seed va ri e t y. T h e
present system of seed sav i n g, which is
p r e valent in most developing countri e s ,m a k e s
it difficult for them to gain sufficient returns on
their inve s t m e n t . Losses have even forced
some companies to suspend crop
d e velopment progr a m m e s.
The threat to biodiversity
But a number of farming experts and
o r g a n i z ations reject this logi c. “I do not
consider that the cost spent by seed com-
panies can be recovered only by term i n at o r
t e c h n o l o g y. In fa c t , most successful seed
companies are those whose seeds have a
r e p u t ation for quality and affordable pri c e ,”
says Swaminathan.
C ritics of term i n ator technology also
argue that poor fa rm e rs in the tropics not
only produce 15 to 20 per cent of the wo r l d ’s
food supply, they also maintain crop va ri e t i e s
t h at are a source of genetic dive rsity for the
wo r l d ’s plant breeders and genetic engi n e e rs.
For example, the Manila-based Intern at i o n a l
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) relies on tra-
ditional rice va rieties collected from fa rm e rs
in many parts of the world to develop new
high-yielding seeds (see pages 46 to 50).
“If fa rm e rs eat or abandon their tradi-
tional seeds in the process of adopting ter-
m i n ator seeds,c e n t u ries of crop genetic dive r-
sity could be lost foreve r ,” s ays Pat Mooney,
E xe c u t i ve Director of the Canada-based
Rural A d vancement Fo u n d ation Intern a-
tional (RAFI), a non-gove rnmental organi-
z ation which is spearheading an intern at i o n a l
campaign against term i n ator technology.
Pointing to another wo rse-case scenari o,
some scientists fear that the TPS trait could
spread to other crops if pollen carrying a ter-
m i n ator gene lands on plants in neighbouri n g
fie l d s.“Plants in the neighbouring crop wo u l d
then produce seeds that would not germ i-
n at e ,” s ays Rob Marchant,a research associat e
at Nottingham Unive rsity (United Kingdom).
If this happens, there is a danger that fa r-
m e rs who opt for normal seeds may end up
h aving sterile ones because of crops with the
t e rm i n ator trait in adjacent fie l d s.

A backlash against
biotechnology
While the debate over the TPS is heat i n g
u p, scientists are concerned that the contro-
ve rsy is leading to gr owing anti-biotechno-
logy feelings in many developing countri e s.
Some environmental groups in South A s i a
have even called for a total ban on geneti-
cally engineered seeds, fearing they could
cause harm to human beings.
“There are gr owing misconceptions
about genetic research.The myths have to be
d i s p e l l e d .The fact is that biotechnology is the
only solution if we want to increase wo r l d
food production to meet future demands,”
a s s e rts Dr A rie A l t m a n , professor of hort i-
culture at the Hebrew Unive rsity of Je ru-
s a l e m . Pointing to declining food production
in some Asian countri e s , he says that the
process of the Green Revo l u t i o n , w h i c h
helped many nations in the region boost
food output in the 1960s and 70s, has clearly
reached sat u r ation leve l .“So genetically engi-
neered crops are the only solution to increase
y i e l d ,” claims A l t m a n .
But who will take the initiat i ve of deve-
loping new seed va rieties? Gove rn m e n t
spending worldwide has been minimal in
a gricultural biotechnology, while the pri vat e
sector has been pumping millions of dollars
into research and development in this fie l d .
Now, they are not willing to invest more in
s e l f - p o l l i n ating crops like wheat and ri c e
unless returns are ensured, and perceive
the TPS as one way of achieving this.
DPL officials claim that pest-resistant
w h e at and rice seeds can be developed in the
next six to seven ye a rs ,s i g n i ficantly boosting
global food production. But they contend
t h at once such high-yielding va rieties enter the
m a r k e t , it will be difficult to monitor the
p atenting rights because they are mass-culti-
vated crops.At present, some seed companies
oblige fa rm e rs to sign a contract affirming that
they will not re-use the seeds purchased.To
enforce this, companies send inspectors to
monitor fa rm e rs ’ a c t i v i t i e s. While such a
system is already difficult to implement in
the U. S . , where ri gid patent rights exist, it is
next to impossible in the developing wo r l d .
“The TPS is essential to safeguard the pat e n t s
of new va ri e t i e s ,” s ays Olive r.
TPS proponents also argue that seeds
i n c o rp o r ating a term i n ator trait will not be
forced on fa rm e rs.“If they do not want them,
they can always continue with other seed
va ri e t i e s ,” s ays Harry Collins, vice president
of technology transfer at the Mississippi-
based DPL. H owe ve r , if the best seeds ava i-
lable on the market all carry a term i n at o r
t r a i t , fa rm e rs who refuse to buy them will
be left with ones of inferior quality.
The trend towards concentration on
the seed market is also likely to limit choice.
RAFI maintains that the top 10 seed cor-
p o r ations control 30 per cent of the $23 bil-
lion seed market wo r l d w i d e . In the last few
ye a rs Monsanto has become one of the
wo r l d ’s largest seed companies, and is the-
refore in a position to make direct use of ter-
minator technology across the globe.
Realizing that this technology could be
a money-spinner, other seed companies
have jumped into the fray. “After the ter-
m i n ator pat e n t , 29 patents along similar
lines  have been obtained by 12 European
and U. S . seed companies seeking to exploit
new engi n e e ring techniques for profit
motives,” says Mooney.
RAFI is not is the only outfit lobbying
against the T P S .The Consultat i ve Group for
I n t e rn ational A gricultural Research (CGIAR),
the wo r l d ’s largest organization in this fie l d ,i s
opposed to introducing the technology in
d e veloping countries and has banned its use
in its 16 agricultural research institutes.
In Ja n u a ry 1999, more than 50 non-
g ove rnmental organizations and fa rm - l o b b y
groups from South A m e rican nations assem-
bled in Ecuador to form a coalition against ter-
m i n ator technology entering the continent.
“ Poor fa rm e rs will get nothing out of it.We
are not only against term i n ator but against all
transgenic seed va ri e t i e s. It doesn’t gi ve poor
fa rm e rs any adva n t a g e s ,” s ays Silvia Ribeiro,
‘After the terminator patent, 29 patents along similar lines have
been obtained by 12 European and U. S. seed companies seeking
to exploit new engineering techniques for pro fit motives’
who works with a coalition of fa rm e rs ’o r g a-
n i z ations and NGOs in southern Brazil.T h e
n e t work has scheduled a series of public mee-
tings and demonstrations throughout Brazil
in the coming months to create awa r e n e s s
among fa rm e rs about the T P S . Some local
g ove rnments in Brazil have already banned the
e n t ry of term i n ator seeds once they become
available in five to six ye a rs.
Biotech proponents argue that the nega-
tive reaction to terminator seeds is prema-
t u r e . “If the new seeds are going to increase
the yield by 15-20 per cent, fa rm e rs will not
mind paying for the seeds,” says C.S.Pra-
k a s h , Director of Plant Biotechnology
Research at Tuskegee Unive rsity in the U. S . ,
and consultant for Monsanto.
Farmers in the U.S. are already expe-
riencing the benefits of insect-resistant and
herbicide-resistant crops through higher
yields and profit s.Transgenic insect-resistant
maize saved U. S . fa rm e rs  an estimat e d
$190 million in 1997 and substantially
reduced insecticide use.
Not all developing countries oppose agri-
cultural biotechnology. Fa rm e rs in China
and A r g e n t i n a , for example, h ave responded
favourably to genetically engineered seeds.
Chinese fa rm e rs have been successful in cul-
t i vating hy b rid cotton seeds and buy them
e ve ry year from the companies.“ Fa rm e rs are
the best judges. They know what is econo-
mically beneficial for them.If they find that the
t e rm i n ator trait is unv i a b l e , they themselve s
will reject it,” s ays Prakash. n
