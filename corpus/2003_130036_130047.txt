Donors drag    their heels
One of the most significant levers 
 for eradicating illiteracy is the 
worldwide drive to achieve 
universal primary education (UPE) by 2015. It was 
backed by some 180 countries, the United Nations 
and international aid organizations, and grassroots 
representatives at the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, Senegal in 2000. 
Developing countries pledged to draw up 
national action plans to achieve Education For All 
by 2002 and the international community pledged 
that no country that was serious about reform to 
achieve these goals would be thwarted by “lack of 
resources”.
World leaders meeting at last year’s G8 summit 
in Canada backed a Fast Track Initiative led by the 
World Bank to assess and support national action 
plans and draw in funds from donor governments 
for countries ready to carry out the reforms.
The process has galvanized up to two dozen 
countries to re-examine their education systems and 
gear up towards making primary education free. 
The most spectacular development came when 
the new Kenyan president, Mwai Kibaki, abolished

Donors drag    their heels
school fees in January and 
millions of extra children 
flooded into school.
By November 12, countries 
– Burkina Faso, Niger, 
Mauritania, Uganda, Ethiopia, 
Guinea, Mozambique, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Guyana, Yemen and Tanzania 
– had finalized Education 
Action Plans and were 
waiting for donors to turn 
their pledges of support into 
cash. 
These are relatively small- 
population countries in which 
16m children do not attend 
school compared with an 
estimated 115.4m worldwide.
But aid officials from 
industrialized countries 
gathering at the first Donor 
Consortium on Education 
for All in Brussels in late 
November agreed to give only $400m to seven 
countries with four million out of school, instead 
of the $700m extra which the Global Campaign for 
Education - grouping NGOs and teachers unions 
- says is needed to fund the 12 countries’ reforms.
“It is a tiny amount of money and they haven’t 
worked out where it is going to come from,” said 
Oliver Buston, senior policy adviser to Oxfam, a 
leading NGO in the GCE.
This does not bode well for attempts to rally 
support for reforms in the five countries with the 
highest out-of-school populations - 50 million 
children between  Bangladesh, Democratic Republic 
of Congo, India, Nigeria and Pakistan - as they will 
require massive hikes in aid to basic education.
In a briefing paper for the consortium, the Global 
Campaign said: “Too many countries are falling 
through the gaps because donors do not consider 
them to be politically strategic or because the 
donors that do support them do not focus on basic 
education.”
It also highlighted the serious lack of aid to basic 
education in Francophone Africa, an issue which 
France, the main donor engaged in those countries, 
could address. 
It urged Germany to follow through on its 
commitment to support up to three Fast Track 
countries – Mozambique, which has increased 
education spending to 18 percent of its budget 
but needs an immediate $91m to launch its plan, 
Honduras and Guinea.
And it called on the United States to offer more 
help to Nicaragua, which despite a strong record on 
raising primary enrolment, especially among girls, 
can’t fund its plan without extra cash.
In all, the GCE is demanding that 18 countries  
ready to receive aid via the Fast Track Initiative 
be fully funded by June, and that a timetable be 
drawn up to extend funding to at least 30 countries 
including the big five.
The Dakar goal cannot be met, however, unless 
education also spreads in those countries that 
so far have not drawn up credible reform plans 
– whether due to weak government, the degrading 
of infrastructure by conflict, or corruption. 
One solution suggested by the 2002 Education 
For All Global Monitoring Report, is to send in an 
international task force to work with governments 
to draw up action plans and monitor progress. 
Acceptance by the host government would be the 
condition for receiving extra funds under the Fast 
Tract Initiative.
The EFA report warned that 57 countries are 
unlikely to achieve universal primary education by 
2015. 
However, one significant development is the 
impact being made by coalitions of civil society 
groups in developing countries who are pressing 
their governments to make UPE a priority. 
And a sign that the Dakar drive – from UN-led 
international meetings down to village parents 
committees - is gaining some momentum is the new 
respect given to education ministers in government 
Cabinets, especially in Africa.
“The big change is that political will is being 
generated at all levels,” said Oliver Buston.
