Notre-Dame d' miens
by Cécile Romane
The cathedral of Amiens in France is a masterpiece
of Gothic architecture celebrated for the stone
carvings on its Western portals. It was placed on
the World Heritage List in 1981.

Notre-Dame d'Amiens, the
largest cathedral in France
and a masterpiece of the Rayon¬
nant style of Gothic architecture,
is twice the size of Notre-Dame
in Paris. Yet it does not give any
impression of being overpowering
or disproportionately huge. On
the contrary, harmony, elegance
and rhythm are the words
brought to mind by the thrust of
the pillars, the daring of the high
windows and the proportions of
the rib vaults. Inside, the visitor is
struck by the airiness, and looking
upwards is charmed by the alter¬
nating vivid pinks and greens
which cover the expanses of the
vaults. Even though other French
cathedrals elicit widespread
admiration (Chartres or Rheims,
for example), many people regard
Notre-Dame d'Amiens as the
Gothic cathedral par excellence.
A PASSION FOR BUILDING
The first Gothic church ofAmiens,
consecrated in 1152, burned down
in 121ÎÏ. Another church had to
be built. Like most of their con¬
temporaries, the people of Amiens
wanted to improve on what had
already been done and they had
the resources to do so. Thanks to
its weavers, its spinners and its
dyers, who used plants to produce
the highly popular Amiens "blue",
the city was prosperous. The chap-

teds, Thomas de Cormont and his
son Renaud, succeeded Robert de
Liizarches. The success of the
cathedral was due as much to
Robert's plans and methods as to
the innovations introduced by his
two successors. Amiens was the
first cathedral to be built to small-
scale plans and also the first where
the stone-cutting work was ratio¬
nalized. Shelters were built in the
quarry so that work could continue
during bad weather, and the pre¬
fabricated elements the masons
produced wen; then stored, ready
for use when the weather improved.
Work on a church usually
starts witli the choir, the centre of
worship. However, since the area
where the choir was to be located
was occupied, work at Amiens
started with the nave and the high
windows were placed on a blind
triforium, the normal practice at
that time. However, after the
death of Robert de Liizarches in
about 1223, when the choir and
the apse were being added, the
ter was also growing rich from the
influx of pilgrims. Bishop Evrard
de Fouilloy lost no time in asking
the architect Robert de Liizarches
to build a cathedral in the Gothic
style, which had begun to be used
in the previous century and was
then flourishing construction
work was already underway on the
cathedrals of Chartres, Bourges
and Paris.
The passion for building in the
Middle Ages which some people
at the time described as morbus
aedificandi (the building sick¬
ness) covered France with mon¬
uments of which half, some 1,300
buildings, still exist today. Amiens
cathedral (1220-1280) was built
during this productive period
when an aspiration towards splen¬
dour and novelty fostered techni¬
cal prowess.

techniques for building an open¬
work triforium were known. This
is why, at Amiens, light flows in
abundantly at the back, confer¬
ring on the cathedral a grace
which is felt by everyone who vis¬
its it, Christian and non-Christian
alike.
From the twelfth century
onwards, the Gothic conception
of architecture attached more
importance to emptiness than full¬
ness, and soared skywards in
search of beauty. This concern for
clarity and for unity of space dic¬
tated certain features which con¬
tribute to the originality of
Amiens.
LIVES OF THE SAINTS
On the West facade, the vast Beau
Dieu porch is flanked by the
smaller porches of the Mother of
God and St. Firmin. The profu¬
sion of sculptures recounting
sacred history has earned the
cathedral the description of "a
Bible in stone" The fifty-five main
statues are placed in a hierarchical
order with, in the centre, the
twelve Apostles surrounding Christ
giving his blessing, while the tym¬
panum shows details of the Last
Judgement. The right porch dis¬
plays the history of the Virgin
Mary, and the left the lives of St.
Firmin, who came from Pamplona
in the third century to preach in
Amiens, and of other local saints.
In the past, the porches were
used as shelters as well as
entrances and justice was dis¬
pensed there. Beneath each
statue, at head height, are two
lines of quatrefoils, a typical
French Gothic motif. The vices
and virtues are represented at the
feet of the Apostles. They are
read vertically with courage
standing higher than fear and
symmetrically. Each virtue refers
to its symmetrical counterpart on
the other side of the porch so
that love faces chastity. Charity is
represented by the gift of a cloak
to a naked beggar. This allegory
reminds us that it was at Amiens
that St. Martin divided his cloak
in two with a stroke of his sword
and gave half of it to a poor man.

A masterpiece
from the cathedral's
treasury:
the casket of
St. Firmin, the first
bishop of Amiens
(13th century).
St. Firmin's portal shows the work
of the different seasons of the
year and the signs of the Zodiac.
Very high up, above the Gallery
of the Kings, which is found in all
Gothic cathedrals in France;, shines
a rose window whose fine stone and
glass tracery extends over a circle
with a diameter of almost 13
metres. This colossal circle is as big
as a circus ring with room for twelve
galloping horses. On either side rise
two towers of different heights, one
completed at the end of the four¬
teenth century, the other in the fif¬
teen th. When it was built, the inte¬
rior of Amiens cathedral was the
highest in the world, the central
vault rising to more than 42 metres ,
the equivalent of fifteen storeys.
But the cathedral's architec¬
ture is not its only interesting fea¬
ture. The 110 oak choir stalls,
carved with breathtaking virtuosity,
constitute the finest masterpiece
in wood to be found in France.
They were executed over a period
of fourteen years (1508-1522) by
three local artists. On the seats, the
arm rests and the pendentives,
thousands of small figures, all dif¬
ferent and dressed in the style of
the early sixteenth century, mime
biblical and secular scenes.
Round the choir and the
transept, four series ofpolychrome
stone high-reliefs show dozens óf
figures, as lifelike as portraits, act¬
ing out the Bible stories and the
life of St. Firmin in fifteenth- and
sixteenth-century costume.
In addition to a polychrome
wooden Madonna and Child dating
from the fifteenth century, the
cathedral Treasury contains the sil¬
ver casket of St. Firmin, a marvel of
thirteenth-century art from the
Meuse region, and the Face of St.
John the Baptist, brought back
from Constantinople around 1206.
This impressive relic, protected by
a large hollowed-out rock crystal, is
presented on a gold plate with an
enamelled cover adorned with a
striking face of St. John.
NON-STOP RESTORATION
Restoration work is always going
on in Notre-Dame d'Amiens. In
1880, John Ruskin, the English
art lover and critic, expressed the
view that the French could not
leave their cathedrals alone for
ten minutes!
4* THE UNESCO Q^URIER MARCH 1997

The nineteenth century saw a
succession of restoration projects,
the most extensive of which lasted
from 1849 to 1874 and was
directed by Viollet-le-Duc. The
current operation is similar in scale,
but the comparison stops there.
No architect nowadays would go
so far as to create, as he did, a
gallery on the façade or add his
own portrait even concealed
behind an altar. Current practices
respect everything, even the alter¬
ations made by Viollet-le-Duc. The
statues of the Kings of France dec¬
orating the façade are smiling,
whereas those dating from the
time of Viollet-le-Duc are more
austere and will remain that way.
Umcsco placed Amiens Cathe¬
dral on the World Heritage List
in 1981. France is financing the
restoration work. The most sig¬
nificant effort is currently focus¬
ing on the West façade, the aim
being to ensure that it will enter
the third millennium without
scaffolding. The rose window,
which was dismantled at the end
of 1996, will be back in place in
the spring of 1997. The sculp¬
tures are being cleaned by laser
(the first time this has been done
in France) and this has revealed
minute traces of the early paint¬
work under the dirt, and has given
some idea of the original vivid
hues of red, green, white and gold.
The galleries and pinnacles are
being cleaned up by a micro rub¬
bing technique (with a 29 micron-
calibre abrasive!). In order to pro¬
tect certain stones from being
blackened by the sulphur in the
urban atmosphere, some of them
have been coated with a mineral¬
izing agent and others with water
repellents. Those that are too
badly damaged are replaced by
good-quality new stones of similar
colour. None of Amiens' master¬
pieces, produced with such mar¬
vellous skill, have been lost. Unfor¬
tunately, however talented the
restorers and hovvev er much fund-
ing is provided, pollution works
very quickly. It is discouraging to J
note that the cathedral became ¡
dirtier in the last decade than dur- |
ing the previous half-century. H 5
