From Russia’s coal c o u n t r y

The wooden shacks in this mining village are
without proper sanitation facilities or running
water. The elderly, whose meagre pensions arrive
more or less regularly, fetch water from the well,
unless it has frozen too hard. Temperatures as
low as minus 680C have been recorded in the
region.

rife, a drunken miner collapses in the snow.

The legendary patience of Russia’s
m i n e rs came to an end last Ja n u a ry
when they suddenly revolted at
Ku z n e t s k aya and nearby places in the pine-
forests of the Siberian taiga. For five day s ,
in the half-light of the winter, the manager
of the local coal mine was held hostage by
a group of miners dri ven to desperat i o n .
Helped by their wives and children, t h e y
kept him prisoner in his office by
b a rricading the door with tables and
c h a i rs. They had not been paid for three
ye a rs , they said. They had no ru n n i n g
wat e r , no telephones.Their children could
no longer go to school, which was fif t e e n
kilometres away.
Their remote village, l o c ated in the
Kuzbass region, the heart of Russia’s coal
i n d u s t ry, is a Soviet-style mining settlement
like many others in the country ’s coalfie l d s.
The privileged status that all manual
workers, especially miners, enjoyed in the
Soviet Union was in fact only relative and
partial.They may have been paid twice as
much as teachers or doctors but they were
often housed in insanitary wooden shacks,
usually consisting of a single room and a
tiny kitchen.
These hovels are still there, r ows of
them along muddy tracks which are either
frozen or dusty according to the season.



Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have been sacked
over the past seven years and the other half are
struggling to make ends meet because they are
being paid months, even years late. Their anger
exploded last January
‘Kidnapping the mine
manager in January got us
nowhere. We’re the real
hostages here, the miners
and their families’
They date back to the time of the gulags,
when mines were dug by pri s o n e rs in
remote Arctic regions without any regard
for profit a b i l i t y.When the market economy
a rri ve d , keeping them going became a
tricky afair.
Many miners still live in such barrack
blocks because almost no new low - c o s t
housing has been built since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.But the end of the old
S oviet empire has had plenty of other
c o n s e q u e n c e s. In Siberi a , safety conditions
in the mines quickly deteri o r ated as
equipment wore out.The huge expanses of
cheap housing which began to replace the
old mining villages in the 1950s are no
longer maintained.

To prepare for the long winter, p o t at o e s
have been stored in the cellar and as many
things as possible have been pickled.
But in Siberia, kitchen gardens cannot
produce enough nor for ve ry long. S o
grandparents help out, chipping in with the
pittance of a pension they still receive on a
more regular basis. But this is not enough,
and so families go into debt.This situation
is widespread in Russia. It affects not only
i n d i v i d u a l s , but firms (including the mines),
those who provide services to them, t h e i r
c u s t o m e rs , the banks, the gove rn m e n t —

In the Kuzbass, a desolate and icy region of
western Siberia more than 3,000 km east of
Moscow, coal miners have been on strike
since last January demanding their unpaid
wages. Workers at the Krasny mine, near
Kiselevsk (above), say they have not been
paid for a year. Top, they argue their case with
the mine manager, Alexander Khamliuk.
To heat their homes, retired miners go with
buckets to pick coal from the pithead.

debts of Russia’s banks neared $200 billion
by the time they almost collapsed this 
summer.
The miners also survive by stealing, by
dismantling abandoned fa c t o ries and other
facilities bit by bit. B a rter is becoming
routine.The lone shop in Kuznetskaya no
longer has any cash.At the beginning of the
year, the manager “sold” basic food items
to the miners , hoping to be paid when they
received their wages.
He also distri buted goods which he got
through complicated barter negotiat i o n s
i nvolving coal from the mine. S o m e t i m e s
the families have to try to sell by themselve s
tyres or nails obtained this way. M a ny
m i n e rs have sunk into alcoholism, w h o s e
ravages are still on the increase in Russia,
sending many to a premature death or
disability.

Unpalatable options
In 1996, the World Bank made an initial loan of $500 million for the reconversion of Russia’s coal mines,
which were considered uneconomic. Some of this money was hijacked by real or bogus middlemen.B e f o r e
making a second loan of $800 million, the bank is demanding that half the 200 mines still operating be shut
down and that all state subsidies be abolished by the year 2000.The subsidies are used to pay around 17%
of the miners’ wages, the rest coming from the mining companies, which have been partly privatized since
last year.
R e t raining the dismissed miners is very difficult. In the Tula Basin, for example, only 1,700 of the
20,000 miners dismissed there a few years ago have found new jobs. Russian coal production has slumped,
from 400 million tonnes in 1980 to 240 million tonnes in 1997. n
take no more of this. They were tired of
l i ving off their wits,while the mine manager
was living high off the hog. He had moved to
a new area outside the village, w h e r e
mansions have been built behind high wa l l s.
In the We s t , mine closures in the past
few decades have been isolated dramas,
resisted by groups of wo r k e rs. In Russia,
such closures are happening at a time when
the country itself is breaking up and
p l u n ging into a crisis whose outcome is
u n c e rt a i n .The first seven ye a rs of transition
from communism to capitalism have ended
in fa i l u r e . The fate of the miners is no
longer a major factor in the tragedy being
e x p e rienced by the vast majority of people,
including the middle class which was just
s t a rting to emerge, and the intellectuals,
who are having a hard time playing their
role as observe rs and chroniclers of this
tormented society.
Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have
been sacked since 1991. Only very few of
them have managed to find other wo r k .
More dismissals are expected during the
next few months,along with the sacking of
other wo r k e rs traditionally less we l l -
organized,in Russia as elsewhere,than the
m i n e rs. But most Russian trade unions
h ave been discredited by their past
c o l l a b o r ation either with the communist
authorities,or with the present regime.So
they cannot mobilize large numbers of
people to support the miners, workers and
o t h e rs who continue to toil without pay for
months or even years.
In Ku z n e t s k aya ,M a ria Pe t r ovna is bitter.
“Kidnapping the mine manager in Ja n u a ry
got us now h e r e .We ’re the real hostages here,
the miners and their fa m i l i e s.We ’ ve got too
m a ny thieves and scoundrels.”
All the miners in Russia have come to
the same conclusion, whether they live in
the Kuzbass regi o n , in the Far East, i n
R o s t ov-on-Don or in Vo r k u t a , a b ove the
Arctic Circle. E ve ry w h e r e , each day is
pretty much like living in hell. n
