‘N o one shall be subjected to arbitr
interference with his pri va cy, fa m i l y,
home or correspondence.. . . Eve-
ryone has the right to the protection of the
l aw against such interference or at t a c k s.”
This may not be the best-known article of
the Unive rsal Declaration of Human Rights,
but the gr owing invasion of pri va cy by digi-
tal technology and the Internet is bringing
it to the fore.
A number of opinion polls among
I n t e rnet users show that protection of
d ata about their personal lives has
become a major concern .The inventor of
the World Wide Web himself, Tim Ber-
n e rs - L e e , said recently he was wo rri e d
about the consequences for pri vate life of
use of the Intern e t . C y b e rspace expert s ,
consumer advo c ates and human ri g h t s
d e f e n d e rs all wa rn that the “ b i g - b r o t h e-
ri z at i o n ” of society is steadily adva n c i n g .
And the political police are no longer the
only ones invo l ve d , nor even the main
p e rp e t r at o rs of it, at least in the We s t e rn
d e m o c r a c i e s.
These days,the most skilful manipula-
tors of new information and communica-
tions technology to build up files on indivi-
duals are pri vate companies collecting per-
sonal data on tens of millions of people.

I n t e rn at i o n a l , a human rights wat c h d o g
gr o u p, s ays eve ry citizen of an industri a l i z e d
c o u n t ry appears today in about 200 different
data bases. Such mines of information are
c e n t r a l i z e d , sifted through and corr e l at e d
to produce very detailed profiles of consu-
m e rs.The files are then resold to all kinds of
firm s , which use them to sharpen their mar-
keting strat e gi e s , assess the economic relia-
bility of customers and adjust to specific
commercial demands.
The Internet is an ideal tool for this
meticulous task of cat e g o rizing the popu-
l at i o n . It is an extraordinary source of
d ata as well as a practical way to handle
such inform ation and circulate it. C a n a-
d a ’s commissioner for the Protection of
P ri vate Life, B ruce Phillips, noted in
1996 that surfing the Web was a bit like
p l aying stri p - p o k e r: you start by taking
off your tie and before you know where
you are, your trousers have disappeared.
In other wo r d s , “ a n o nymity is not the
rule on the Intern e t , still less is the idea
t h at you don’t leave any traces behind
yo u .”This wa rning by France’s Commis-
sion on Data Processing and Freedoms
(CNIL) applies to a broad range of prac-
tices designed to tap into the secrets of
I n t e rnet users. Most websites include
some kind of questionnaire to fill in. T h e
US Federal Trade Commission says 85
per cent of 1,400 commercial sites it loo-
ked at in March 1998 gathered pers o n a l
i n f o rm ation in this way. A medical clinic,
for example, i nvited consumers to sub-
mit their name, postal and e-mail
addresses and insurance company and to
make comments about their health pro-
b l e m s. Some on-line services require
such details before they will gi ve access
to their site.

In the digital age, how can privacy be protected without infringing people’s
freedom to trade via Internet?

q u e s t i o n s.A study by the Unive rsity of Geor-
gi a , in the United Stat e s , s h owed that 40
per cent did so when the questions got too
detailed.But “most people are very naïve,”
s ays Alain We b e r , an Internet expert with
the French League for Human Rights.
“They wo u l d n ’t be so free with the infor-
mation if they knew how it could be used.”
A US banker in Mary l a n d , for example,
recently obtained a list of cancer patients,
m atched them with his customers and then
a u t o m atically rejected loan applicat i o n s
from those who were ill.
D ata seekers on the Internet stop at
n o t h i n g . The US Federal Trade Commis-
sion is concerned about the “ t r o u b l i n g ”
practices of commercial websites aimed at
c h i l d r e n : nine out of 10 of them extract
information from these young people and
f e wer than a quarter suggest asking
p e rmission from their parents before
providing it.
M e a n w h i l e , cy b e rsleuths use many tools
and monitoring programmes to record peo-
ple’s movements around cyberspace.Data
banks like DejaNews index all messages in
on-line discussion gr o u p s.A nyone can type
in the name of a person,click on “profile”
and get their e-mail address and all the mes-
sages they have sent to the gr o u p, which will
p r ovide inform ation about their tastes, a b o u t
h ow they spend their leisure time and what
their opinions are. The CNIL also notes
t h at the gat h e ring and use of e-mail for com-
mercial ends is a basic problem.
To make matters worse,the Internet is
a world of invisible tracks. You get the
impression when you surf the web that you
l e ave no traces behind yo u . The truth is
r ather different. Some sites place spying
devices, or “cookies”, on your computer’s
hard dri ve the moment you log on to them,
so they can tell which pages of the site you
h ave looked at , when you looked, and for

Professor Philip Agre of the University of California at San Diego has sounded the alarm about systems that threaten private life.

logy adviser Ira Magaziner has even threa-
tened to go to the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) about it.At the same time,he
insists that the US is just as concerned to
protect the pri va cy of its citizens as European
g ove rnments are.And all studies show that
Internet commerce cannot succeed unless
c o n s u m e rs can count on inform ation about
themselves being kept confidential.
Behind such skirmishing lies the fa m i l i a r
difference of approach between the US and
E u r o p e . The former trusts the market to
s o l ve the trickiest problems, while the lat t e r
prefers to set up public-sector bodies to do
s o. Though the A m e rican authorities are
well aware of the need to reassure Internet
u s e rs , they are also sympathetic to the argu-
ments of direct marketing and financial lob-
b y i s t s , who think the solution lies less in
imposed regulation than professional self-
r e g u l ation through codes of conduct and
the development of encryption technology
and ways of erasing individual tracks left in
cyberspace.
EPIC assessed the effectiveness of self-
r e g u l ation by looking at the websites of firm s
which were members of the Direct Marke-
ting A s s o c i ation (DMA), which opposes
a ny legi s l at i ve interfe-
r e n c e . It concluded that
“the DMA’s efforts to
promote pri va cy prac-
tices is having little
impact on its new mem-
b e rs ,e ven after repeat e d
assurances from the
DMA that this approach
is effective.”
The Federal Trade Commission came to
the same conclusion after a wide-rangi n g
s u rvey published in June 1998. It said that
“the industry ’s efforts to encourage vo l u n t a ry
adoption of the most basic fair inform at i o n
practice pri n c i p l e – n o t i c e – h ave fallen far short
of what is needed to protect consumers.”
Pressure from consumers and from
Europe may force firms to change their
mode of operation. If it does not, we may
lose not only the freedom to buy and sell
but also our personal freedom.“The adve n t
of the surveillance society will bring with it
a new era of social control,” warns Davies.
“The two have always existed hand in hand.”

The range and power of new technolo-
gies are creating a formidable “ s u rve i l l a n c e
e c o n o my,” s ays Dav i e s. So strengthening
protection of the right to pri va cy is an urgent
matter. The European Union directive on
“the protection of individuals with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such dat a ” is a step in this
direction.
Under the directive, which comes into
effect on 25 October 1998, the processing of
d ata about ethnic ori gi n s , political opinions,
r e l i gious and philosophical beliefs, t r a d e
union members h i p, health and sex life, i s
prohibited except where
there are special exe m p-
tions or derogat i o n s.
M o r e ove r , in each of the
European Union’s fif-
teen Member Stat e s , a
special authority is to
protect individual’s
rights and freedoms with
regard to the processing
of personal data.It is to guarantee citizens
the right to be informed, to have access to
data concerning them and the right to cor-
rect it, and to erase data whose processing
does not comply with the provisions of the
d i r e c t i ve .A rticle 25 states the principle that
the transfer of personal data to third coun-
t ries may only take place if the receiving
countries offer a level of protection that is
“ a d e q u at e ” within the meaning of EU legi s-
l at i o n .“If the European plan succeeds,” s ay s
Davies in the American monthly magazine
W i r e d, “ e ve ry country on earth will soon
adhere to a global pri va cy code. If it fa i l s ,t h e
United States and Europe could end up in
the throes of an ugly trade war over the inter-
national transfer of personal information.”
In a globalized economy where infor-
m ation about consumers is the new gold
m i n e , the stakes are huge, i nvolving no more
and no less than the future of all banking
and trade transactions, especially electro-
nic.The United States has already gone on
the offensive by accusing Europe of using
p ri va cy protection laws to erect barri e rs
around the valuable European market of
370 million people. White House techno-
