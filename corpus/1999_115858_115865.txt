Although conventional wisdom still sees basic science 
as distinct from industrial re s e a rc h , it is actually very hard to draw 
the line between the two

Industrial managers are being asked today to
s o l ve two seemingly contradictory problems: o n
the one hand, to produce more innovat i ve pro-
ducts based on the latest science, and on the other,
to drastically cut costs and reduce the time it takes
to get these products to the market.
The first task requires access to the best unive rs i t y
s c i e n c e , the capability to perform imagi n at i ve research,
and a creat i ve environment in which to innovat e .T h e
second requires focus on near-term product sche-
d u l e s , disciplined use of resources, and limitat i o n s
on technical ri s k s.These requirements,which may pull
in opposing directions, h ave always been with us. B u t
in less competitive , less technically sophisticated times
they were accomplished in sequence.A scientific dis-
c ove ry was followed by applied research to build a
prototype of a commercial product. Only then wo u l d
a company put its engi n e e rs to wo r k ,d e veloping the
processes to produce it.
This sequential approach can take a long time.To
take one example of the process of finding a com-
mercial use for a scientific discove ry, scientists have
been trying for a decade to make mat e rials that exhibit
superconductivity at near room temperat u r e . So fa r
they have had little success,but if they do succeed,e l e c-
t ricity would flow without resistance, making pos-
sible a new world of more efficient electrical devices.
But early applications of the most radical disco-
ve ries are seldom successful.So innovat o rs today are
focusing their energy on concurrent pursuit of both the
science and the commercial idea. Science is no longer
a stranger to technology; i n d e e d ,product and process
ideas come together with science through basic
r e s e a r c h , leading to eve r - i m p r oving technology.

The merging of scientific research and com-
mercial innovation has been made possible by the
total transform ation of science and engi n e e ri n g
since the Second World Wa r. Before 1940 most
technical knowledge was based on empirical obser-
vat i o n .The power of scientific prediction based on
m at h e m atical theory was we a k ; new ideas could
only be va l i d ated by building prototypes and testing
t h e m .S c i e n c e , since the Wa r , has made such extra-
ordinary progress that all this has changed.
Take the case of IBM’s largest computers, in
which the design of the product and the technology
from which it is constructed must be deve l o p e d
concurrently. Faster circuits require a new archi-
tecture for the computer. But you cannot test that
architecture in a prototype without the new cir-
cuits in hand. Product cycle times can be cut in half
by computer simulation of both the circuits and the
m a c h i n e . When the first machine comes off the
production line no working prototype has ever been
built,except in cyberspace.

“ I m agi n ation 
is more important
than know l e d ge.”
Albert Einstein,
German-born physicist 
(1879-1955)

E ven the most complicated molecules and mat e-
rials can now be designed to meet specific com-
mercial needs. Computer codes and va l i d ated law s
of nature can also be used to create molecules and
m at e rials that never existed in nat u r e .P h a rm a c e u-
tical companies that build designer molecules to
h ave predictable therapeutic properties must wo r k
very close to the limits of chemical and biological
k n ow l e d g e .The margin between basic science and
applied technology is hard to find.
Technology roadmaps to guide
corporate strategy
Basic science plays another essential role in
high-technology innovation by making possible
i n f o rmed choices between altern at i ve technologi e s.
Robert Galvin, the imaginative former Chief Exe-
c u t i ve Officer of Motorola Corp o r at i o n1, p l a c e s
gr e at importance on the preparation of “ t e c h n o l o g y
r o a d m a p s ” to guide corp o r ate technology strat e g y.
These roadmaps describe what future improve-
ments in technology our scientific knowledge allow s.
Using them, it is possible to pick the technology with
the greatest promise for future improvement.
In a situation where further improvements in a
c u rrent technology are increasingly difficult to make,
the timing of a decision to shift to an altern at i ve
with a more extendable future may be a life-and-deat h
decision for the firm . Ralph Gomory, when director
of research for IBM in the 1970s and early 1980s,
organized teams of researchers to acquire the scien-
t i fic knowledge that allows wise choices among tech-
n o l o gi e s.Analysis made on the basis of this approach
g ove rned IBM’s decision to abandon the pursuit of
superconducting Josephson junctions, a radical alter-
n at i ve to the use of semiconductors in integr at e d
c i r c u i t s , as a replacement for more conve n t i o n a l
silicon-based semiconductors. S i m i l a r l y, IBM found
the technology roadmap for silicon-gate semicon-
ductor memory chips leading to many ye a rs of impro-
ve m e n t , while the roadmap for the metal-gate tech-
nology IBM was then using appeared to be
d e a d - e n d e d ,e ven though it was cheaper at the time.
E ven the institutional setting for innovation is
c h a n gi n g,c h a l l e n ging our conventional thinking about
basic science as something distinct from industri a l
r e s e a r c h .The central corp o r ate laborat o ry is still the
site for the basic research performed by the most
technically aggr e s s i ve , science-based firm s. But these
l a b o r at o ries are smaller, and more focused in that
common ground of motivated scientific and techno-
l o gical research that I have descri b e d .And the role of
technical innovator is shifting to the smaller, highly spe-
cialized firm s.
These small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
are more technically specialized firms that can move
faster and with more imagination than their much
bigger customers.They are often part of their cus-
t o m e rs ’ i n n ovation system, s h a ri n g, over the
I n t e rn e t , a computer design system that allows the
SME to become a member of the larger firm ’s
design team.The result is a boost to productivity and
innovation in the economy as a whole. It accounts
for much of the sustained economic growth in the
U.S. recently and represents a challenge to those
societies with weak high-tech SME sectors.
‘Jeffersonian science’
H ow should we describe the kind of research in
which science and technology are merged and which
is motivated by visions of new possibilities? The lat e
Donald E. S t o k e s , of Princeton Unive rs i t y, c a l l e d
such research “ Pa s t e u r ’s Quadrant”, contrasting Louis
Pa s t e u r ’s “use-inspired basic research” with what
Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr called “pure basic
r e s e a r c h ” .H a rva r d ’s Gerald Holton reminds us that
in the early 19th century President Thomas Je f f e rs o n
commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the
Pa c i fic Nort h west to collect ve ry basic scientific infor-
m ation about ecology and Nat i ve A m e rican languages,
but for a ve ry clear and important applied purp o s e .
“ Je f f e rsonian science” m ay have the practical
goals we associate with technology,but it must be per-
f o rmed in the creat i ve , intellectually competitive
e nvironment we associate with basic science. S o m e
might think that “basic technology research” is a
contradiction in term s. I see it as characteristic of
much industrial science.Once there is general accep-
tance of the idea that science and high technology
h ave merged and must be pursued concurr e n t l y,we
can simply call the combination “ r e s e a r c h ” .
Of cours e , there is no way even the largest firm can
be self-sufficient in scientific know l e d g e . E ven the
best corp o r ate research laborat o ry can only be a
w i n d ow on the world of technical know l e d g e .Since the
i n n ovat i ve SMEs have relat i vely short - t e rm hori z o n s ,
and the big companies have cut back on corp o r at e
research as they rely more on the SMEs, the bu r d e n
for keeping the knowledge base expanding falls on uni-
ve rsities and national research institutions.
Most governments are trying to increase their
i nvestments in this knowledge infrastru c t u r e . I n
order to keep the work in touch with the world of
i n d u s t rial research, i n c e n t i ves are offered for colla-
b o r ation between unive rsities and industry.Thus the
i n n ovation system is becoming a process carried out
by a network of institutions, in which academic
science, large company research, and SME inno-
vation are linked.This is the direction in which all
advanced economies are headed. n
