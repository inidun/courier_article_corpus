The colonial challenge by Albert Adu Boahen
NEVER in the history of Africa have
so many changes occurred, with
such speed, as during the period
1880 to 1935. Indeed, the most fundament¬
al and most tragic of these changes took
place between 1890 and 1910, the twenty*
year period that saw the conquest and occu¬
pation of virtually the whole continent of
Africa by the imperial powers and the
establishment of the colonial system the
following twenty-five years being essen¬
tially a period of consolidation and exploi¬
tation of the system.
The pace at which this drama unfolded
was astonishing. As late as 1880, in the
whole of west Africa, only the island and
coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Free¬
town and its environs, the southern parts of
the Gold Coast (Ghana), the coastal areas
of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and Porto
Novo in Dahomey (Benin) and the island of
Lagos had come under the direct rule of
Europeans. In northern Africa, only Al¬
geria had by then been colonized by the
French. Not an inch of eastern Africa had
come under European control, while in cen¬
tral Africa only the coastal stretches of
Mozambique and Angola were subject to
Portuguese rule.
It was only in south Africa that foreign
rule had not only been firmly implanted but
also extended a considerable distance
inland. In short, in 1880, some 80 per cent
of the continent of Africa was still being
ruled by her own kings, queens and clan and
lineage chiefs, in empires, kingdoms, com¬
munities and political units of every size
and kind.
Within the next thirty years, however,
this situation underwent a dramatic change.
By 1914, the whole of Africa, with the
exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, was sub¬
ject to the rule of European powers.
What was the attitude of the Africans
themselves to the establishment of colonia¬
lism? The answer is quite clear and unequi¬
vocal; the overwhelming majority of Afri¬
can leaders and authorities were vehemently
opposed to this change and expressed their

determination to retain their sovereignty
and independence.
In the face of the French invasion of his
territory in 1883 and their demand for per¬
mission to build a railway across his terri¬
tory Lat Dior, the Darnel of Cayor in
modern Senegal, wrote to the French
Government:
"As long as I live, be well assured, I shall
oppose with all my might the construction
of this railway... That is why, every time I
receive a letter from you concerning the
railway, I will always answer No, No, and
I will never make you any other reply. Even
were I to go to my rest, my horse Malaw
would give you the same answer."
In 1890, King Machemba of the Yao in
Tanganyika (United Republic of Tanzania)
told the German commander Hermann von
Wissman:
"I have listened to your words but can
find no reason why I should obey you I
would rather die first... If it should be
friendship that you desire, then I am ready
for it, today and always; but to be your sub¬
ject, that I cannot be... If it should be war
you desire, then I am ready, but never to be
your subject... I do not fall at your feet, for
you are God's creature just as I am. I am
Sultan here in my land. You are Sultan
there in yours. Yet, listen, I do not say to
you that you should obey me, for I know
that you are a free man... As for me, I will

not come to you and, if you are strong
enough, then come and fetch me."
Hendrik Wittboi, a king in south west
Africa, told the Germans in 1894:
"The Lord has established various king¬
doms in the world, therefore I know and
believe that it is no sin or crime that I should
wish to remain the independent chief of my
land and people."
Makombe Hanga, of Mozambique, also
told a white visitor in 1895:
"I see how you white men advance more
and more in Africa; on all sides of my
country companies are at work. My country
will also have to take up these reforms and
I am quite prepared to open it up... I should
like to have good roads and railways, but I
will always remain the Makombe my
fathers have been."
In 1895, Wobogo, the King of theMossi,
told the French Captain Destenave:
"I know the Whites wish to kill me in
order to take my country, and yet you claim
they will help me organize my country. But
I find my country good just as it is. I have
no need of them. I know what is necessary
for me and what I want. I have my own
merchants. Consider yourself fortunate
that I do not order your head to be cut off.
Go away now and, above all, never come
back."
Most fascinating of all was the moving
appeal addressed by Menelik II of Ethiopia
to Queen Victoria in April 1891. In his ap¬
peal, Menelik first declared his intention of
re-establishing the former boundaries of
Ethiopia and then continued:
"I have no intention at all of being an in¬
different spectator, if the distant Powers
hold the idea of dividing up Africa,
Ethiopia having been for the past fourteen
centuries an island of Christians in a sea of
pagans. Since the Ail-Powerful has pro¬
tected Ethiopia up until now, I am hopeful
that He will keep and enlarge it also in the
future, and I do not think for a moment
that He will divide Ethiopia among the
other Powers. Formerly the boundary of
Ethiopia was the sea. Failing the use of
force and failing the aid of the Christians,
our boundary on the sea fell into the hands
of the Muslims. Today we do not pretend to
be able to recover our sea coast by force,
ALBERT ADU BOAHEN, of Ghana, is a pro¬
fessor and head of the department of history
at the University of Legon, Ghana.' He is a
specialist in west African colonial history, a
subject on which he has written numerous
studies and articles.
but we hope that the Christian Powers, ad¬
vised by our Saviour, Jesus Christ, will
restore our sea coast boundary to us, or that
they will give us at least a few points along
the coast."
When, in spite of this appeal, the Italians
launched their campaign against Ethiopia
with the connivance of Britain and France,
Menelik again issued a mobilization pro¬
clamation in September 1895 in which he
stated:
"Enemies have now come upon us to ruin
our country and to change our religion...
Our enemies have begun the affair by ad¬
vancing and digging into the country like
moles. With the help of God I will not
deliver up my country to them... Today,
you who are strong, give me of your
strength, and you who are weak, help me by
prayer."
It is clear from all these quotations that
these rulers were confident of their
preparedness to face the European in¬
vaders, and well they might have been.
Many of them had been able to build up
huge empires only a decade or two earlier
and some were still in the process of ex¬
panding or reviving their kingdoms. Some
of them had been able to defend their ter¬
ritories with their well-tried old weapons
and traditional tactics, while others, like

Born in 1844, at Ankober in central
Ethiopia, Menelik II was one ofthe greatest
ofEthiopia 's rulers and the most successful
of the leaders of African resistance to the
colonial invaders. In 1865 he became king
ofShewa and in 1889 assumed the imperial
crown. As king, and later as emperor, he in¬
corporated large areas ofsouthern Ethiopia
into his domains and undertook a vast pro¬
gramme of modernization. He had the
foresight to equip his army with modern
weapons and this enabled him to resist in va-
sion by the Italians whom he defeated
decisively In 1896'at the battle of Adowa,
one of the great battles in the history of
Africa. He died In December 1913, having
succeeded in maintaining his country's in¬
tegrity and Independence In face of the
onslaught of European colonialism.
Menelik of Ethiopia, had even managed to
modernize their armies. Furthermore, some
thought they could hold off invaders by
diplomacy.
It is also clear from some of the quota¬
tions above that many African rulers
welcomed the changes that had been steadi¬
ly introduced since the third decade of the
nineteenth century for hitherto they had
posed no threat to their sovereignty and in¬
dependence. In west Africa, for instance,
thanks to the activities of the missionaries,
Fourah Bay College had been founded as
early as 1826, while elementary schools and
a secondary school had been established by
the 1870s in both the Gold Coast and
Nigeria. As early as 1887 wealthy Africans
had even begun sending their children to
Europe for further education and profes¬
sional training.
As far as the Africans were concerned,
then, they did not see the need for any
radical change in their centuries-old rela¬
tions with Europe, and they were confident
that, if the Europeans wanted to force
change upon them and push their way in-
16
land, they would be able to stop them as
they had been able to do in the past.
What the Africans did not realize,
however, was that, by 1880, thanks to the
industrial revolution in Europe and the
subsequent technological progress
represented by the steamship, the railway,
the telegraph and, above all, the Maxim
gun, the old era of free trade and informal
political control had given way to what
Basil Davidson has described as "the era of
the new imperialism and rival capitalist
monopolies' ' . It was not only trade that the
Europeans now wanted, but also direct
political control.
Secondly, the African leaders failed to
realize that their muzzle-loading muskets
were totally outmoded and no match for the
Europeans' breech-loading rifles.
The consequences were tragic. All the
chiefs quoted above except one were
defeated. Only Menelik succeeded in
defeating the Italian invaders and retaining
his sovereignty and independence.
