Rameses II was one of the greatest
builders among all the rulers of Egypt.
The great rock-hewn ensemble of Abu
Simbel is his most monumental and
glorious architectural achievement.
The Great Temple (right) measures
108 feet in height, 124 feet In width.
On the façade, the four colossi, 67
feet high, representing the Pharaoh,
look down from the cliff on to a maj¬
estic sweep of the Nile. Above right,
a detail of one of the giant statues'
feet. The scale of its proportions
can be judged from that of the human
figure. One of Rameses' children is
visible between the colossal legs.

THEY SAID IT WITH FLOWERS
...THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
For over 3,000 years, six mighty figures (opposite page) have
flanked the portal to the Nefertari Temple at Abu Simbel.
Two figures of Nefertari stand between those of Rameses II.
On the interior walls of the Temple are carved figures of the
queen (right) and Rameses II (far right) making offerings of
papyrus flowers. Head carved on the sistrum, the ritual ins¬
trument held In the queen's right hand is that of Hathor, also
seen on detail of pillar (above). In place of the second ritual
sistrum, the queen holds a sheaf of papyrus whose leaves,
when shaken, give off a sound similar to that of the sistrum.
The huge heads (top of page) from the nearby Great Temple
façade are 13 feet from ear to ear. Mouths are 42 inches wide.
