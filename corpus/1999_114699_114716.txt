Old age’s

“When I was wo r k i n g,I liked having apprentices
and passing my skills on to young people,” s ay s
H e n ri Gueri n o t , a French cabinet-maker who
regards his retirement as just another kind of activity.
At 83, he is as enthusiastic as ever and still teaching his
craft to yo u n g s t e rs between the ages of nine and 14.
His passion has proved infectious. More than a
decade ago, in the French city of Tr oye s ,he was the firs t
retired person to get invo l ved in an association called
“ L’Outil en main” ( “ L e t ’s Pick Up Our Wo r k t o o l s ” ) ,
which was set up to encourage contact between yo u n g
people and retired craftwo r k e rs.Through it,the elderly
can stay active and continue to feel useful.
To d ay more than 100 elderly people are follow i n g
G u e ri n o t ’s example and teaching children outside
school hours such skills as carp e n t ry, g l a s s - m a k i n g,
s t o n e - c u t t i n g, c o n s t ruction and plumbing. T h e
e x p e ri e n c e ,p atience and wisdom of the old wo r k e rs
go well with the inquisitive n e s s , talent and
aw k wardness of the young people, all making for the
kind of tender complicity familiar to gr a n d p a r e n t s
Today’s elderly people are
increasingly reluctant to be
sidelined into inactivity when
they retire from full-time
work. To satisfy their
appetite for enjoyment and
achievement, retirees are
getting involved in a host of
activities, from universities
for older people to senior
citizens’ Internet clubs.
Many of them are making a
notable contribution to
society using their
knowledge and experience to
help bridge the generation
gap.

F rench seniors bridge the divide
and gr a n d c h i l d r e n .
Strengthening ties between generations is also
the goal of another French move m e n t ,
“ F l a m b oya n c e ” , whose members are retired people
who each year stage a series of cultural and sport i n g
e vents (known as “Le printemps des générat i o n s ” ,o r
“The Dawn of New Generations”) all over the country.
The proceeds go towards helping the least fort u n at e
young people to get a start in life.
The amounts raised—between 5,000 francs
($1,000) and 50,000 francs ($10,000) from each
e vent—are modest but they can work wo n d e rs.
Examples include a 17-year-old girl who was able to
complete her training as a personal care-prov i d e r ,
which she had had to break off due to lack of money,
another girl who got a computer so she could do
s e c r e t a rial work at home and a young man who had
his driving school fees paid for so he could become a
m e s s e n g e r.
Last year some 15 jobs were created in this way for
needy young people. Not a large number, but an

At the age of 60 or thereabouts, m a ny people
come to the end of their working live s ,but this does
not mean that they no longer have any urge to
l e a rn . According to figures from the Pa ri s - b a s e d
I n t e rn ational A s s o c i ation of Unive rsities of the T h i r d
Age (AIUTA ) ,there are more than 1,700 senior citizens’
u n i ve rsities worldwide cat e ring for these etern a l
s t u d e n t s.
Although their structures and management methods
differ widely from one country to another, u n i ve rs i t i e s
for the elderly usually share a desire to help older people
p l ay a full part in cultural and social life.They do not
award degr e e s ,and they do not require their students to
h ave any particular qualific ation when they enroll.
One successful example of this type of institution
was set up at Shimizu, in Ja p a n , in 1985. D u ring the
last academic ye a r , it had 2,500 students. At this
“ u n i ve rsity for vo l u n t a ry students”, which has been
awarded a prize by the Japanese gove rnment for “ t h e
valuable contri bution it has made as an adult educat i o n

In September 1998, D r. Jason Grinnell was the
winner of a contest organized by the
S e n i o rsSearch company to find the wo r l d ’s oldest
I n t e rnet surfer.At 96 ye a rs of age, Jason moves about
the Net like a fish in wat e r.“I have seen the birth of the
a u t o m o b i l e ,a i rp l a n e ,t e l e p h o n e , radio and television.
N ow the computer and the Internet have opened a
whole new world for my wife Theresa and my s e l f
t h at , God willing, we will continue to explore for
m a ny ye a rs to come”,s ays Dr. G ri n n e l l ,whose interest
in computers began when he was 89.
A retired Texas doctor, Jason Grinnell is by no
means the only elderly person to use the computer for
sending or receiving e-mail, shopping online or merely
looking through pages on which there is no short a g e
of cookery recipes or adve rtisements for dream cru i s e s.
S e n i o rs S e a r c h ’s aims are clear from its slogan:“the only
search directory exclusively for the over-50 age gr o u p ” .
A nybody over 50 can become a member free of charge
and explore the sections on offer, which include
antiques and collections, a rt galleries and museums,
books or social clubs.
S e n i o r N e t , a non profit-making organizat i o n
set up in California twe l ve ye a rs ago with the aim of
teaching older people to use modern technologi e s ,
has another of the best-known homepages most
I t ’s never too late to surf
Eternal students
widely consulted by this cat e g o ry of the public.
With its 27,000 members , SeniorNet receive s
500,000 visits a month, most of them from surfer
veterans in the United States and Canada with an
average age of 68.Its annual budget stands at $1.5
million,one-third of which comes from members’
subscriptions and the remaining two-thirds from
a d ve rt i s e rs and donations from foundations and
c o m p a n i e s , which have no hesitation in funding
this type of venture, since “in exchange, they get
good publicity and tax breaks,” explains A n n
Wrixon,the organization’s executive director.
Other sites choose to foster relations betwe e n
g e n e r at i o n s.This is the case of the French C y b e rp a p y
site on which older people help yo u n g s t e rs with their
h o m e work—something they have done all their live s
but can now do by computer.C r e ated and funded by
the Boulanger corp o r ate foundat i o n , it consists of a
large electronic mailbox divided into seven theme
a r e a s — l i t e r at u r e ,h i s t o ry and geogr a p hy, l a n g u a g e s ,
p h i l o s o p hy, c o m p o s i t i o n , m at h e m atics and the
p hysical sciences—to which pupils send in their
q u e s t i o n s. In practice, the older people, who do not
gi ve their names or occupat i o n s , reply within 24
h o u rs. The questions and answe rs are constantly
monitored by a team of professionals. ■
e s t a b l i s h m e n t ” , there is no age-limit for either students
or teachers.The teachers are vo l u n t e e rs ,as well as the
s t u d e n t s , enrolment fees are reasonable and there is
ample opportunity to make new fri e n d s.
Shimizu has one male student for eve ry four
females and the most common age bracket ranges
b e t ween 60 and 70, although there is an increasing
number of older students attending classes in dancing,
d r a m a , the humanities or manual wo r k .
The aim is to gi ve old people the opportunity to
study by providing them with knowledge enabling
them to lead better, h e a l t h i e r , richer and happier
l i ve s. In the opinion of Dr Tak Kwa n - K o n g, a specialist
in geri at rics and editor-in-chief of The Jo u rnal of the
Hong Kong Geri at rics Society,“This type of institution
is something to be encouraged, especially nowa d ay s
when elderly people have often been gi ven a negat i ve
