D
uring the summer of 1998,I was sitting at a
sidewalk cafe in downtown Sao Paulo with
Laudiceia da Silva,who had just requested
a legal investigation into the large public
hospital where she had “ l o s t ” a kidney
during an operation to remove an ovarian cy s t .
The young woman’s family doctor had discovered
the kidney was missing during an examination soon
after surgery.When confronted with the information,
the hospital representative told a highly improbable
s t o r y : that Laudiceia’s missing kidney had been
embedded in the large “mass” around her cyst. The
h o s p i t a l , h o w e v e r, refused to produce either their
medical records or the evidence—the diseased ovary
and the kidney had been “ d i s c a r d e d ,” she was told.To
make matters worse, L a u d i c e i a ’s brother had been
killed in a random act of urban violence several weeks
earlier, and the family had arrived at the hospital too
late to stop his organs being removed on the basis of
Brazil’s new “presumed  consent”law.
“Poor people like ourselves are losing our organs
to the state, one by one,” Laudiceia said angrily.
“Follow the bodies”
Hers is but one of several credible stories of
“kidney theft” that anthropologist Lawrence Cohen
and I have encountered in South America,India and
Bangladesh as part of our work for the Berkeley
Organs Wa t c h , an independent human rights
organization seeking to investigate allegations of
medical abuse in the harvesting, distribution and
transplantation of organs.
The project stems from experience on a prestigious
international taskforce set up to investigate the organ
trade and develop ethical guidelines to prevent abuses.
Soon after reaching the conclusion that the trade was
far more extensive than previously thought, t h e
Bellagio taskforce was disbanded.In the absence of any
other institution of its kind, Organs Watch was
conceived as a stop-gap measure, offering a frontline
response to reports of illegal organ and tissue sales or
theft anywhere in the world.
Our simple mandate is to “follow the bodies.”We
follow transplant patients from dialysis clinics to
s u r g e r y, and donor bodies from township shabeens
[bars] to police stations and public mortuaries and
from there to the various eye banks, medical clinics and
research laboratories where their parts are harvested
and redistributed.At times, the surgery theatres feel
more like theatres of the absurd, as a few scenes
plucked from our fieldwork will show.
In a Chennai (Madras) slum in South India, my
colleague Lawrence Cohen met five local women,
each of whom had sold a kidney for 32,500 rupees
(about $1,200 in 1999). Each had undergone their
operation at the clinic of D r. K . C.R e d d y, I n d i a ’s most
outspoken advocate of the individual right to sell a
k i d n e y. Unlike the more seedy “organs bazaars” o f
B o m b a y, D r. Reddy prides himself on running an
exemplary clinic: his kidney sellers are carefully
screened, fully informed about the medical risks and
provided with free health care at his clinic for two

Modern medicine has given rise to a booming trade between poor and
rich countries—the trade in human organs. But what of the bodies that
are being plundered?
3 . ESCAPING DESTINY
A woman reveals a scar left after her husband’s kidney was re

years after kidney removal. The women Cohen
interviewed were mostly low-paid domestic workers
with husbands in trouble or in debt.The kidney sale was
usually preceded by a financial crisis.Did the sale make
a difference to their lives,Cohen asked.Ye s, for a time,
but the money was soon swallowed by the usurious
interest charged by the local money lenders. Wo u l d
they do it again if they could? Ye s, the women answered.
Several months later, I sat next to Rosemary
Sitsheshe at her home in  Guguletu township outside
Cape To w n , South A f r i c a . Her only son, 1 7 - y e a r- o l d
Andrew, had been caught in the crossfire of township
gang warfare just before the end of apartheid.He died
of a chest wound under police surveillance. The next
day Rosemary went to the local police mortuary to
claim his body, but officials turned her away. Two days
l a t e r, when the family was finally allowed to view
Andrew’s body, they were shocked:the blanket over it
was covered with blood and there were two deep holes
on either side of his forehead. Rosemary protested,
saying he had been killed by a single, clean bullet to his
c h e s t .The state pathologist treated her and her husband
abusively.
L a t e r, accompanied by her own private pathologist
paid for by the African National Congress, Rosemary
learned at the morgue that her son’s eyes had been
removed and that inside his abdominal cavity the organs
had all been severed and carefully replaced.“But were
those my son’s organs?”she asked.“I know my son’s
eyes but not the colour or shape of his heart or kidneys.”
At the local eye bank, Rosemary was told that her son’s
corneas had been “ s h a v e d ” and given to two “ l u c k y
p a t i e n t s.” The remains of A n d r e w ’s eyes were being
kept in the refrigerator and the director refused to
return them to Rosemary for burial.
“Although my son is dead and buried,” she said,“ i s
it good that his flesh is here, t h e r e,and everywhere, a n d
that parts of his body are still floating around? Must we
Africans be stripped of every comfort?” R o s e m a r y
Sitsheshe has since taken her complaint against the
police mortuary and eye bank to South Africa’s Truth
and Reconciliation Commission. She asked that her
case be treated as one example of a practice that was
widespread in police mortuaries under apartheid and
which continues in some instances.
Transplant tourism
In the most bizarre fieldwork expedition of my
c a r e e r, I went under cover to the grounds of Montes de
Oca state mental asylum in the province of Buenos
Aires in January 2000, accompanied by a private
detective. We went there to see what, if anything, we
could discover about persistent reports of blood, t i s s u e,
and organ stealing from the bodies of profoundly
mentally retarded, but otherwise physically healthy,
inmates. The reports first surfaced in the early 1990s
following the “ d i s a p p e a r a n c e ” of a young psychiatrist,
D r. G u b i l e o, who had lived on the grounds of the
i n s t i t u t i o n . She was apparently on the verge of
revealing the illicit practices by the director of the
a s y l u m . A court-ordered search of the grounds of
Montes de Oca did not recover the remains of Dr.
Gubileo, but did recover a few bodies of unidentified
missing patients.
The only witnesses to the doctor’s kidnapping were
two asylum patients, who said they saw her being
pushed into the back of a van belonging to the asylum.
But declared mentally incompetent, the witnesses could
not give testimony in court. The allegations of other
nefarious goings-on at Montes de Oca led,ultimately,
to the arrest of the medical director, followed by his
unexplained death in a prison cell the day before he was
to give testimony in court.The case was then closed.
Human strip mining of the dead for usable parts is
not limited to former police states in South A f r i c a ,
B r a z i l , and A r g e n t i n a . Similar practices can be found in
one of the wealthiest communities of the United States.
In the fall of 1999,I sat in a diner in Hollywood with
J i m C. , notorious “organs broker” who solicited
international buyers and sellers from his home.“ Th e r e ’s
no reason for anyone to die in this country while waiting
for a heart or a kidney to materialize.There are plenty
of spare organs to be had in other parts of the world.”
Though Jim is operating in a grey netherworld, h e
insists that what he does is not illegal.“Don’t think of
me as an outlaw,” he said.“ Think of me as a new version
of the old-fashioned marriage broker. I locate and
match up people in need.”
Organ transactions today are a blend of altruism
and commerce; of science, m a g i c, and sorcery; o f

voluntarism and coercion;of gift,barter, and theft.In
general, the organs flow from South to North, from
poor to rich, from black and brown to white, and from
female to male bodies. To d a y, affluent transplant
tourists can travel to select medical sites in Turkey,
Eastern Europe,C u b a , Germany and the United States
in search of transplants that they cannot arrange
quickly or safely enough at home.These special clinics
can resemble four-star hotels or even as in Cuba,
health spas for the rich and famous.
Israel has recently become something of a pariah in
the transplant world. Without a strong culture of organ
donation and under the pressure of angry transplant
c a n d i d a t e s, the Ministry of Health has refused to crack
down on the country’s multi-million dollar business
in transplant tourism that arranges junkets from dialysis
clinics in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to medical centres in
Europe and the United States.
“ Why should we Israelis be made to travel to third
world clinics to get the kidneys we need to survive
from the bodies of peasants, s o l d i e r s, or guest workers
who may be in worse physical shape than ourselves?”
a 71-year-old “kidney buyer”
from Tel Aviv asked me
rhetorically. “Organs should be
seen as a human,not as a national
r e s o u r c e.” It was good to see
“Av i r h a m ,”an elderly gentleman,
alive and happy with h i s
revitalizing 22-year-old “ p e a s a n t ”
k i d n e y.And his living donor? “A
p e a s a n t , without anything!” h e
replied.“Do you have any idea
what $1,000, let alone $5,000
means in the life of a peasant?”
For most bio-ethicists, the “slippery slope” i n
transplant medicine begins with the emergence of a
black market in organs and tissue sales. For the
anthropologist,it emerges much earlier:the first time
a frail and ailing human looks at another living person
and realizes that inside that other body is something
that can prolong his or her life.The desire is articulated:
“I want that; I need that even more than you.” I n
terms of transplants, the kidney has emerged as the
ultimate fetish,promising to satisfy the most basic of
human desires—that for life, vitality and élan.
The sale of human organs and tissues requires that
certain disadvantaged  individuals and populations have
been reduced to the role of “suppliers.” It is a scenario
in which bodies are dismembered, t r a n s p o r t e d ,p r o c e s s e d
and sold in the interests of a more socially advantaged
population of organ and tissue receivers. I use the word
“fetish”advisedly to conjure up the displaced magical
energy that is invested in the strangely animate kidney.
Avirham,who flew from Jerusalem to Georgia for his
k i d n e y, explained why he would never tolerate a
donation from a corpse:“ That kidney is practically dead.
It was probably pinned down under the wheels of a car
for several hours. . . I was able to see my donor. He was
young, healthy, strong. Just what I was hoping for.”
In Brazil,the refusal of a corpse’s kidney was just
as virulent. A surgeon  in the area of Copacabana
Beach said that most of his patients refuse to consider
an organ from an “ a n o n y m o u s ” dead person. “ M y
patients do not trust the public health system.They fear
that the organ will come to them full of pollutants.”Th e
ultimate fetish is the idea of “ l i f e ” itself as an object of
m a n i p u l a t i o n . This fetishization of life—to be
p r e s e r v e d , prolonged and enhanced at almost any
cost—erases any possibility of a social ethic. O f t e n
when I speak of troubling issues in organs
p r o c u r e m e n t , I am accused of “taking a chance for
l i f e ”away from someone.But I am trying to underscore
that there is another “body”of patients whose needs
are being ignored or violated.
Notions of bodily autonomy and integrity are
almost universally shared today. They lie behind
patients’ rights movements, the demands of the
wretchedly poor for dignified burial and popular
resistance to “presumed consent” l a w s. But for some of
those living on the margins of the global economy,
the possibility of selling an organ
seems like an act of
e m p o w e r m e n t .“I prefer to sell it
[my body] myself rather than to
let the state get it,” was a
sentiment frequently expressed
by shantytown residents in urban
Brazil.
In fact, it is in the West where
the values of bodily autonomy
and integrity are most under
a s s a u l t .As commercialization has
entered almost every sphere of life—from markets in
“beauty queen” ova and “genius sperm”—those in the
North cannot claim any moral high ground. M e a n w h i l e,
the new constitutions and bills of rights adopted by
democratic Brazil and post-apartheid South Africa are
far more developed than “ o u r s ” in recognizing human
rights to bodily autonomy and integrity.
Organs Watch is seeking assurances that transplant
practices include attention to the needs and wishes of
d o n o r s, both living and dead. We ask that surgeons pay
close attention to where organs have come from and
the manner in which they were procured. We want
the “risks”and “benefits”of organ transplant surgery
to be more equally distributed among and within
nations, and among ethnic groups, genders and social
classes. Finally, we want assurances that the so called
“gift of life” never deteriorates into a
“theftof life.” ■

In terms of tra n s p l a n t s,
the kidney has emerg e d
as the ultimate fetish,
p romising to satisfy the
most basic of human desire s
—that for life, vitality and élan.
