CHILD ART AS A GROVJING FORCE
.-...'........../.-.
! N EDUCATION
THE last twenty. rive years
have been particularly
important for child rt
education. Extraordinary
advances have been made in
teaching methods, classroom ac-
commodation, administration and
supervision, and in the output of
the participating children.
There are many reasons for
this, including new ideas about
art teaching which are acceptable
as part of general education. So
closely related have general and
art education become, that it is
frequently difficult to tell in
what way art education remains
a distinct subject.
This has not always been the
case. Not so long ago, art was
a separate, watertight compart-
ment in the school programme.
Its chief aim was to"develop the
hand and the eye"by telling
children to draw given objects.
Thus whole generations of chil-
. dren learned to draw old hats,
carrots and apples-and also to
dislike the school subject called
"art". Teachers felt that the
children's dislike was perhaps an
advantage, since it was a training
for discipline. They seemed to
believe that"youth should be
taught anything as long as they
disliked it". Because this form
of school art set a premium upon
the development of discipline and
skill, and further, because the
skill developed was separated
from the thoughts and emotions

of childhood, this method of
teaching became subsequently
known as the"nervous-twitch
programme".
The unsound nature of this
programme brought many reac-
tions. Some educators flatly
stated that art should be scrapped
as a part of general education.
Others said that the rigid forms
of discipline necessary for the
successful"training of hand and
eye"should be abandoned, and
that in their place should be
developed methods allowing com-
plete freedom of expression ; that
there should be"a charter of
human rights for children"which
would permit the young painters
to blow off steam artistically
without let or hindrance from the
clumsy adults who made them
draw carrots and apples.
EXTREMES RECONCILED
IN time, the extreme difference8between these two methods
became reconciled. Systems of
teaching have developed which
provide the freedom necessary
for artistic expression while in-
cluding the necessary self-discip-
line for the development of
worthy citizens..
The art programme in the
schools of today is in keeping
with the great tradition of art in
general. The idea is accepted
that a child should give expression
to the events in his life which
affect him. A child finds inspira-
tion for his artistic output in his
life at home, at play, in his school
and in his community. He is
allowed to make his own state-
ments in his own way. His work,
therefore, reflects his thoughts
and feelings about his world. His
output takes a form no more
mature than his own level of
intellectual, emotional and social
development. In other words,
child art looks like the work of a
child, and not that of an adult.
(The self-portraits shown on this
page are not likely to be mistaken
for the works of adults.)
Defining his reactions to life, a
child-or for that matter, anyone
else-frequently requires the
guidance of a teacher. To act as
a successful teacher of art requires
the greatest skill which fortunate-
ly is not beyond any sensitive
and sympathetic person's ability
to acquire if he is concerned with
the general education of youth.
The art teacher, like any other
teacher, or any successful parent,
must respect children as children.
He must be prepared to guide
them when the need arises, while
at the same time he must always
keep in mind that the child,
whenever possible, should act as
the controlling participant of the
activity in progress. Therefore, he
cannot inflict upon children adult
forms of expression, since this
would lead to sterility of the
child's expression and thought.
LEARNING ABOUT LIFE
WITHOUT a vigorous program-me of art education, it is
sai d, no child is adequately
educated. The act of defining
experience, inherent in the pro-
duction of art forms, is considered
to be an important part of learn-
ing. As a child considers the
events in his life which concern
him, he comes to grips with
experience. Thus he learns about
life in general. In his desire to
make statements about the world
which surrounds him he develops
manual skill commensurate with
his needs, while at the same time
he harnesses and directs his emo-
tions into worthwhile channels.
The potentialities of art educa-
tion for children have not yet
been fully realized. Progress has
been both rapid and wide-spread
but much has yet to be learned
and done. Methods are subject
to change as we gain greater
insight.
