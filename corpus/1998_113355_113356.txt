It isn’t easy to be young in Algeria, a
country where five years of violence have
claimed nearly 100,000 lives and economic
upheavals are having drastic social
consequences. In spite of everything,
today’s young Algerians refuse to abandon
their hopes and dreams

In A l g e ria today, e ven the most basic
a s p i r ations are no more than dreams.
Wo r k i n g, t r ave l l i n g, planning for the
f u t u r e , making a home–even the simple
things of life are beyond the reach of
young people whose world has been
mangled by violence. And yet they
refuse to abandon their dreams and this
impels many of them to leave the coun-
t ry, e ven if it means becoming illegal
i m m i grants in Europe.
Like eve ryone else, young people
suffer from the political violence and
How can the new generation of Algerians afford the luxury of a carefree youth?

Because of a longstanding housing crisis, young Algerians escape from crowded apartments into the streets where they wait hopefully for a job to turn up.

of Algiers.
More and more Algerians live in the street,
either to keep clear of violent areas 
or simply because they are too poor 
to afford lodging.

Dalila the militant
Th i r t y - t w o - y e a r-old Dalila
Taleb already has a long
career of political activism
behind her. The October 1988
riots in A l g i e r s, in which more
than 500 young people died,
filled her with passion to
defend her country’s youth,
tragically left to fend for itself.
In 1993, with a group of
f r i e n d s, she founded the Yo u t h
Action Movement (RAJ) which
was an overnight success.
D a l i l a , its president, q u i c k l y
became one the most popular
figures among the youth in
the poorer sections of the
c a p i t a l . The RAJ’s members
range from girls wearing the
veil to pop music fans, f r o m
Islamist supporters to moder-
n i z e r s. And the movement
w o r k s, despite the constraints
and problems confronting
voluntary organizations in
A l g e r i a . Without losing touch
with the grassroots, D a l i l a
went into politics and in the
1997 parliamentary elections
became an opposition FFS
( Front of Socialist Groups)
member of the National Pe o-
p l e ’s Assembly representing
her home town of Bejaia. I n
the A s s e m b l y, where she is a
member of the youth, s p o r t s
and voluntary work commis-
s i o n , she has made a name for
herself as an orator who
speaks out against all kinds of
violence and arbitrary beha-
viour– whoever its perpetra-
tors may be. ■

from insecuri t y. M a ny now cannot
e ven study–hundreds of schools have
closed in the wo rst affected areas such
as Blida, Medea and Chlef. Social vio-
lence is also soari n g . The gove rn m e n t
is in many ways ineffective and daily
life has become so difficult that parents
can no longer minister to their chil-
d r e n ’s needs. Some 300,000 yo u n g
people come onto the job market eve ry
year in a country where there are
already more than two million unem-
p l oye d . The middle class is shri n k i n g,
the poor are getting poorer and the
rich are getting ri c h e r. The streets of
the capital teem with young children
selling newspapers or cleaning car win-
d ows–scenes which
would have been
i n c o n c e i vable a few
ye a rs ago.
If they can’t live

A l g e rians can at least
dream about easing
their fru s t r at i o n s
through freedom of

few has been lifted in
A l gi e rs , but the state of emergency is
still in force and public gat h e rings are
b a n n e d . Tickets for the few concert s
staged these days are expensive . A
black-market ticket costs 800 dinars *
when the minimum wage is about
5,000 dinars , and only about one
young person in twenty can afford to
g o. Cinemas are closing. Film clubs
h ave disappeared. Young people don’t
bother with youth and cultural centres
a ny more because they are suspicious
of anything to do with the authori t i e s
and because the courses on offer cost
m o n e y. The gove rnment pleads secu-
rity reasons for restricting the activities
of civil society. But preventing yo u n g
people from expressing themselves pea-
cefully can only push them towa r d s
violent forms of self-expression or eve n
to extremism.
They dream of escaping a “sick life”
which weighs even more heavily on
girls than boy s. In big tow n s , c o e d u c a-
tion has surv i ved the recent ye a rs of
troubles fairly we l l . But eve rything is
harder for gi r l s. I t ’s hard for them to
go out in an evening with boy s , u n l e s s
they belong to a ve ry restricted social
c i r c l e . As a result of a profoundly sexist
e d u c ation system, i t ’s hard for them to
l e a rn anything at
youth centres except
sewing or embroi-
d e ry, whereas boy s
can study computer
s c i e n c e . And it’s hard
to escape the conser-
vatism of most A l g e-
rian fa m i l i e s , w h o
keep a tight rein on
the lives of their
d a u g h t e rs.
Young people dream of peace.T h e y
feel alienated by the violence that
confronts them. Talk to them about
peace and their enthusiasm is imme-
d i ately aroused. Young musicians have
w ritten some amazing songs about

through theatre or painting. In the
Youth Action Move m e n t , by teaching
them to help one another and show

n a g e rs to work together, to ove r c o m e
their differences and break down the

tions have built between boys and gi r l s.
All that needs to be done is to bri n g
them together and invo l ve them in a
common project. For many yo u n g
people feel fru s t r ated that there is
nothing they can do to bring about
c h a n g e .
They dream of peace, but like the
rest of the population they are caught
b e t ween the violence of Islamist extre-
mists and that of the gove rn m e n t . I n
A l g e ri a ,s a d l y, difference is synony m o u s
with intolerance. H atred between the

to develop democratic practices.
Without jobs, without being able to
e nvisage a better life and without hope,
young people lounge idly in the
s t r e e t s – “ h u g ging the wa l l s ,” as A l g e-
rians put it, nicknaming them “ h i t t i s t s ”
(from the Arabic word h i t, m e a n i n g
“ wa l l ” ) . The young dream, but their
dreams turn into nightmares because
their elders either do not know how or
do not want to talk to them. ■

other young people the world over. But only a
