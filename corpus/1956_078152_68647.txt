Poll reveals likes and dislikes
WHAT does TV try to do?
It aims to bring relaxa*
tion to televiewers after
the fatigue of everyday
work; to provide entertainment
and to take their minds off work
for a short time ; and to help to
develop the personality, by
showing people how to cope
more satisfactorily with the prob¬
lems of th'eir daily lives. These
closely-linked functions meet
certain basic needs and a weekly
programme should allow scope
for them all. There should be
some measure of each in every
evening's telecast, otherwise the
audience will be fatigued or
bored. To see if these three
basic aims were being achieved,
tele-clubs in France were asked
during a UNESCO opinions
survey what they thought of the
various types of regular program¬
mes put out by French television:
variety, films, plays, literary
programmes, practical subjects,
news reporting, etc. The impor¬
tance of the survey lies in the
fact that the tele-club audiences
are largely representative of a
country such as France. Their
replies thus set a standard of
comparison for TV programme
planners who want to please a wide
public, by mixing entertainment
with the education which they
present through the TV screen.
REAWAKENED IN¬
TEREST in the theatre
now exists among rural
tele-club audiences. Not
all plays have been cho¬
sen with an eye to the
susceptibilities of coun¬
try folk some, either
too frivolous or too
subtle, have left bad
impressions. But more
and more villagers say:
"If it hadn't been for TV
I would never have got
to know the theatre."
Documentary program¬
mes (like the one shown
here taking the TV au¬
dience into a business
training school) are also
tremendously popular.

Likes and dislikes (Cont'd)
Variety gets
top rating
Top favourites of all French weekly
telecasts viewed by the rural
tele-clubs, are variety program¬
mes (circus, music-hall, sketches and
interviews with leading entertainers).
Unesco's survey of audience likes and
dislikes showed that between 78%
and 92% of televiewers were en¬
thusiastic about these programmes
and especially about Trente-six chan¬
delles (Thirty-six Candles) a fort¬
nightly variety telecast, and one of
the most popular in France. The
circus was much more of a favourite
with the small farmers and labourers
than with non-manual workers.
" Sunday feature films tied with
Trente-six chandelles (80% each) for
popularity, though many viewers
complained that the films released
were too old. Although extracts and
incomplete works are usually disliked
by unsophisticated audiences, se¬
quences from recent films rated 60%
of votes. Documentaries, though ge¬
nerally reputed to be tedious, were
also approved by 60% of televiewers.
Studio-produced plays were liked
by 60% of the audiences, while only
7% were against them. The theatre
seems to appeal to women slightly
more than to men, but all age groups
show much the same attitude.
Books are a bore
Least popular o'f all the program¬
mes was "Lecture pour tous"
(reading for all) chief literary
programme of French TV. Even the
non-manual workers were not keen
about this telecast and not one of the
small farmers or workmen liked it.
Thus, this feature, though winner of
the French Television Prize for 1954,
has certainly not solved the problem
of popularizing reading through TV.
Merits of Le Magazine Féminin, the
only one of the "practical" program¬
mes regularly seen by the tele-clubs,
seem to be strongly in dispute (48%
in favour; 36% against). It is na¬
turally most liked by women, yet the
cutting out lesson is equally popular
with men and with women. A
puzzling feature of audience reaction
is this tepid welcome given by women
to programmes dealing with house¬
hold problems.
Among the news and outside broad¬
casts, the Journal Télévisé rivals va¬
riety programmes in popularity.
Workmen are its staunchest support¬
ers, far more so than non-manual
workers, though they are less en¬
thusiastic about the Magazine du
temps passé, a review of past events.
Reports by explorers on distant
countries, deserts or polar regions
(Magazine des Explorateurs) are
not outstandingly popular, especially
among the "Over 40's." Docu¬
mentaries on social themes receive
more approval and this type of outside
telecast seems to be the one likely to
interest everybody.
COOKING LESSONS
given on " Women's
Magazine" programmes
were only welcomed by
5% of televiewers. But
this women's programme
as a whole is a favour¬
ite "practical" telecast.
Even men like lessons
on cutting out clothes.
WORKS VISIT: One of
highly popular telecasts
on social problems.
Geographical program¬
mes have even more
appeal. One farmer was
surprised to find that
"Finns look like us; 1
always thought they
resembled the Chinese."
INVENTORS' CLUB,
a programme on which
latest inventions are
presented, got 17 votes
compared with 60 given
to domestic features.
"Practical" programmes
explaining different jobs
and professions are also
very much in demand.
OLD CROCK shakes its
way down the Champs-
Elysées In Paris while
taking part in the "Pile
ou Face" (Heads or Tails)
programme for young
people. Age group of
21 to 25 gave most
votes to music-hall and
variety programmes.
