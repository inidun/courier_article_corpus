Anthony Carter, a 22-year-old African-Ame-
ri c a n , is a star player in the Unive rsity of Hawa i i
Basketball team.He has already had lucrative
offers from prestigious clubs in the National Bas-
ketball Association (NBA) league.
Not long ago, C a rter was one of many poor
young males looking for opportunities in A t l a n t a ’s
Jonesboro south subu r b , k n own for its high cri m e
r at e . His life took a different turn after he joined the
local “Midnight Basketball” (MBL) league where he
spent three ye a rs.As a result, he is now in unive rs i t y
and looking ahead to a bright future in the NBA
l e a g u e . M B L , which organizes basketball playe d
b e t ween 10:00 p. m . and 2:00 a.m, has changed the
l i ves of many young males like Carter who live in the
poor neighbourhoods of Atlanta and might otherwise
h ave drifted into cri m e . (See box . )
The only difference between Midnight Basket-
ball and normal basketball is that it is played at
hours when young inner city males are most vul-
nerable to the drug culture,crime and other nega-
t i ve activity. In a nutshell, MBL takes the playe rs off
the street at night and places them in a play gr o u n d
area under organized and structured conditions.
Emmanuel Hunt, Jr, President of Atlanta MBL,
quoting police records, s ays that the programme has
helped to bring down the crime rate in the inner city,
which fell by 40 per cent in the last five years.
Chapters
in fifty cities
The first Midnight Basketball League was start e d
in 1986 in Glenarden, M a ry l a n d , and since then
the idea has spread to major cities like Los A n g e l e s ,
A t l a n t a ,M i a m i ,C l e veland and Detroit. Like NBA,
MBL has its own organized stru c t u r e .To d ay, it has
50 chapters nationwide and about 10,000 yo u n g s t e rs
p l ay in MBL games across the country.The Com-
m i s s i o n e r ’s office is located in Chicago and there are
r e gional offices which organize tournaments bet-
ween local teams and between cities. Last ye a r ,
according to National A s s o c i ation of MBL offic i a l s ,
about 200,000 spectat o rs watched the matches per
night nationwide and the television viewe rs h i p
crossed the 3.5 million mark.
MBL playe rs , selected normally on open tryo u t s
in each city, are in the 17-25 age group and on
average spend three to four ye a rs in the progr a m m e .
They are distri buted among different teams which
p l ay in a local league. Most participants in the
MBL are A f ri c a n - A m e ri c a n s ,m e m b e rs of the gr o u p
that outnumbers other ethnic groups in the poor
neighbourhoods of many U. S . c i t i e s. “ Pa rt i c i p a-
tion in the league is open to all young males.We do
not discri m i n ate on racial or ethnic grounds in
selecting the players,” says Tony Adams,an official
at the Fountain City MBL of Columbus,Georgia.
What makes an MBL match different from a
n o rmal basketball game? Before each eve n t , t h e
players have to attend a one-hour workshop which
focuses on topics like job interview skills, financial
m a n a g e m e n t , AIDS/HIV awa r e n e s s , d rug and
alcohol abuse prevention, conflict resolution and

A programme 
to combat crime
The Sentencing Project, a U. S. Criminology Think Ta n k ,
reported in 1998 that the leading cause of death
among African-American male youth between the ages
of 17 and 25 is homicide and that one in six A f r i c a n - A m e-
rican males will be arrested before they reach the age of
1 9 . It is estimated that one in 22 African-American males
will be killed by a violent crime before reaching the age
of 44.Moreover, as many as 42 per cent of incarcerated
men in the United States are black males. It is estimated
that by the year 2000,approximately 50 per cent of black
males between the ages of 17 and 30 will be either
incarcerated or under penal supervision.Law enforcement
officials and criminologists have established that the
increased drug use, drug trafficking and disenchantment
with the American educational and employment oppor-
tunity structure has led to the increased arrests among col-
lege age African-American males.
In an effort to address rising crime and related pro-
blems among youths in Glenarden,Maryland,the town
m a n a g e r, G.Van Standifer, established the Midnight Bas-
ketball League in 1986.His aim was to provide an alter-
native to youngsters who wander around their neigh-
bourhood during the night and end up committing crimes.
With the support of businesses, law enforcement offic i a l s,
and political and community leaders, the first Midnight
B a s ketball League programme was organized in the
same year.The MBL says that programme was successful
in reducing the incidence of reported crimes by almost 60
per cent in Glenarden. Standifer later created the format
for other communities to develop MBL leagues in their
area. Today, MBL chapters have been developed in over
50 cities in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Each chapter is a
non-profit,community-based organization that adheres
to formal training, rules and regulations based on the ori-
ginal successful programme. n
“Sport can fire
the highest 
and the lowe s t
p a s s i o n s.
It can deve l o p
d i s i n t e restedness 
and a sense of honour
as well as love 
of pro fit .
It can be ch i va l rous 
or corru p t , manly 
or bestial. Nobility 
of fe e l i n g, the cult 
of disinterest 
and honour, the spiri t
of ch i va l ry, m a n l i n e s s
and peace are 
the prime needs 
of modern
d e m o c ra c i e s.”

Olympic Committee

e n t r e p r e n e u rs h i p. A nyone who does not at t e n d
these classes is not allowed on the basketball court .
“Instructors encourage the participants to take up
jobs and sometimes the local association helps them
to find one,” says Hunt.
There are eight to ten teams in each chapter with
10-12 playe rs in each team,and each team plays on an
average three to four games per week during a summer
s e a s o n . MBL playe rs can stay in the league till they
reach 25 ye a rs of age and some of those who retire
come back to the system as instru c t o rs , coaches and
vo l u n t e e rs.
“The stress is on discipline, punctuality and beha-
v i o u r. M e m b e rs are not allowed to enter the court if
they come late for the class and if they misbehave
d u ring a game they are immediately sent out,” s ay s
Mark Gallagher, assistant sports supervisor at the
R e c r e ation and A rts Center in Wat e r l o o, I owa .
Respecting the rules
MBL playe rs are not paid for their part i c i p at i o n .
The only incentive comes in the form of balls, s h o e s
and T-shirts, making the event a totally non-com-
mercial activity. Local gove rn m e n t , n o n g ove rn-
mental organizations and pri vate companies sponsor
these events.
W h at makes these yo u n g s t e rs follow strict ru l e s
and regulations inside the basketball court when they
h ave difficulty in following the rules of the society? In
his book The Violent Social Wo rld of Black Men, s o c i o-
l o gist William Oliver argues that black males often
break rules as a form of resistance to discri m i n at i o n
and disrespect in a white-dominated society. T h e y
channel themselves into the areas where they per-
c e i ve opportunities exist, and sport , especially bas-
k e t b a l l , is one of them.1
For A f ri c a n - A m e rican youth basketball has
become a subculture in its own ri g h t .Talented high
school playe rs are recruited by top colleges and
are offered scholarships to study and also to play in
the college team.The best college playe rs then go on
to play professional basketball in the NBA or in ove r-
seas leagues.
For these youngsters in poor neighbourhoods,
MBL not only provides an opportunity to play the
game but also contri butes to their self-identity and
s e l f - a s s e rt i o n . Fo l l owing the rules of the game
enables them to gain respect from their peers ,p o p u-
l a rity and a reputation as fierce competitors. A
player in an MBL league can lose his reputation in
his locality if he is kicked out of the programme on
d i s c i p l i n a ry gr o u n d s. The message of MBL is
s i m p l e . If you want an opportunity to play the
game, you have to respect the rules. n
