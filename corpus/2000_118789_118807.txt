The Internet is challenging the media establishment, empowering 
the public and re d e fining the role of journalists in society
2❘ The messenger 
is the media
About midnight on Fe b ru a ry 4, 1999 22-ye a r -
old West African immigrant Amadou Diallo
stepped through the doorway of his Bronx,
New York apartment bu i l d i n g . As he reached for his
wa l l e t , four members of a special police Street
Crime Unit drew their guns and fired 41 times.
Nineteen bullets struck the unarmed man,
several entering the soles of his feet as he lay dead.
I t ’s unclear why the police opened fire on the man;
as of this writing they had yet to be interviewed in
the case, which is scheduled to go to trial in early
2000.They were apparently seeking a suspect in a
rape case,and may have thought Diallo was him.
The case attracted world-wide attention and stir-
red considerable controve rsy over the use of excess
force by the police,especially in cases involving mino-
rity suspects in the outer New York City boroughs,
such as the Bronx. News media provided extensive
c overage of the story, r e p o rting in detail the eve n t s
t h at transpired that eve n i n g, as best could be surm i-
s e d .
One news organization, in collaboration with
students in my class at Columbia Unive rs i t y, o f f e r e d
an alternative perspective, or perspectives, on the
Diallo case. In addition to providing the standard
reporting on the events of that evening, an inter-
d i s c i p l i n a ry team of Columbia students, i n c l u d i n g
students of journ a l i s m ,i n t e rn ational affa i rs , bu s i n e s s
and computer science, worked with journalists at
A P B n e w s , an online-ori ginal news organizat i o n
devoted to crime coverage, to offer a multi-angled
news report on the story.
To provide a more contextualized view of the
killing, the Columbia-APBnews team employed a
new type of camera invented by a Columbia Uni-
ve rsity professor of Computer Science, Shree Naya r ,
which shoots a 360-degree view, to photogr a p h
both the ve s t i bule of Diallo’s apartment bu i l d i n g, a s
well as the street where he lived.

Those who visit the APBnews.com web site
can examine the street and the vestibule,panning,
tilting or zooming anywhere in the entire field of
view. The view from inside the vestibule approxi-
mates to the view Diallo would have had that eve-
ning, but you can now see the bullet holes that
pock-mark the walls.
Letting the facts
speak for themselves
The view from outside the bu i l d i n g, t h o u g h
taken during the day t i m e ,a p p r ox i m ates to the posi-
tion the police would have had, giving the viewer a
sense of pers p e c t i ve on the shooting not possible
with conventional photojourn a l i s m .To g e t h e r ,t h e s e
n avigable images, only possible on the Intern e t ,n o t
only provide more context for the events of that eve-
n i n g, but can engage the audience in ways impos-
sible in the world of analog journ a l i s m .This heigh-
tened engagement and gr e ater context are cri t i c a l l y
important for journalism in the 21st century.
As A B P n e w s.com demonstrat e s , I n t e rnet not
only makes possible a more engaging form of jour-
n a l i s m ; it also puts gr e ater control in the hands of
the audience.The facts presented need be less fil-
tered by journ a l i s t s ; the public can draw its ow n
conclusions as to their meaning. In other wo r d s ,
j o u rnalists online can increasingly let the facts speak
for themselve s. Is this not one of the most long-che-
rished goals of journalism?
The Internet also permits a gr e ater range of jour-
nalistic voices to speak to an increasingly global
a u d i e n c e .APBnews was founded only two ye a rs ago,
in 1998,and is already recognized by many other lea-
ding news organizations as a reliable source of cri m e
n e w s. In fa c t , the APBnews service is carried by
dozens of other news organizat i o n s.
M a ny other credible Intern e t - o ri ginal news sources
h ave also arisen in recent ye a rs.O n e ,T h e S t r e e t . c o m ,

which cove rs the financial markets, is so respected by
premier news organizations that on November 24,
1 9 9 9 , The New Yo rk Ti m e s, perhaps the most highly
respected news organization in the wo r l d ,a n n o u n c e d
t h at it was going into part n e rship with TheStreet to
launch a news gat h e ring operation that would prov i d e
i m p r oved business news report i n g .
Examples abound of freelance journalists who
provide credible news reports from all parts of the
wo r l d . Freelance journalist Mario Profaca (Croa-
t i a ) , for example, r e p o rts on the situation in Kosovo
and also provides extensive coverage of the spy wo r l d

Adams edits “Not the South China Morning Po s t ” ,
o f f e ring a sat i rical view on press freedom in Hong
K o n g .These and other online news sources prov i d e
a global audience with altern at i ve journalistic vo i c e s
to contrast with the mainstream reporting of mul-
tinational commercial media organizations.
Research suggests that the public, especially yo u n-
ger audiences who have gr own up with the Intern e t ,
is increasingly finding value in this dive rsity of news
vo i c e s. One study has shown that as of 1998 some 36
million persons in the U. S . (including 30 per cent of
18 to 29-ye a r - o l d s , up from just seven per cent in
1995) look to online sources for news each we e k ,a n d
t h at 77 per cent of those aged 18-29 “like having so
m a ny sources to chose from.” In contrast, older age
groups less accustomed to interactive media are not
so likely to find this dive rsity appealing (70 per cent
of those aged 30 to 49,64 per cent of those aged 50 to
64 and 52 per cent of over 65s).1 I t ’s still too early to
tell just what impact this increasing use of online news
is having on the public.
Personalized news
The Internet also permits much greater custo-
m i z ation of news. Because of its ability to enable
on-demand media, as well as audience segmenta-
t i o n , the Internet permits audiences and news orga-
n i z ations to provide increasingly personalized news.
This pers o n a l i z ation is a two-edged swo r d .
Although it can permit audiences to get just the
news they wa n t , such as financial news customized
to their own investment port f o l i o, it can also increase
the level of audience fragmentation already ram-
pant in the media.
H owe ve r , i t ’s also wo rth noting that there is a
second type of customization of news possible only
on the Intern e t , and this type is not necessarily a
c o n t ri buting factor to fragmentat i o n .U n f o rt u n at e l y,
it is only in its earliest form ,and in fact few news orga-
n i z ations are actually employing it, although it embo-
dies a fundamental news value—localizing the story.
O n l i n e , it is possible to use databases that inclu-

de vast repositories of inform ation about entire
c o u n t ries or even the entire globe, and perm i t
audience members to see how a specific story,
e ve n t , process or phenomenon affects them in their
own community, interest group or life situat i o n .
Direct
access
B e l ow are three illustrat i ve examples, one from
an online news organizat i o n , one from a company
interested in exploiting the capabilities of the online
world for profit , and perhaps the public good, and a
third from a consortium of gove rnment agencies,
j o u rnalistic organizations and educational institu-
t i o n s.All three examples illustrate how a single story,
such as crime rat e s , election campaign contri bu-
tions or we ather pat t e rn s , can be transformed from
a generic story reported in a uniform fashion for the
widest possible audience, to customizable, i n t e r a c-
t i ve multimedia inform ation that can permit anyo n e
a nywhere in the world to see what that story means
for them in their own context.
APBnews permits users living in the United Stat e s
to enter their zip code and find out the crime rate in
t h at neighbourhood.This is an unprecedented resource
for citizens concerned not just about the overall cri m e
r ate in their city, s t ate or nat i o n ,but in the neighbou-
rhood where they live , or may be traveling or mov i n g
t o.The data come from a company that specializes in
making crime maps.
Po l i t i c s.com permits users to enter a name and
find out how much and when that person has contri-
buted to a political candidat e ’s campaign. U s e rs can
also enter a zip code and find out who in that neigh-
bourhood has contri buted to particular candidat e s ,
as well as how much they contri buted and when. It is
also possible to see how much particular candidat e s
h ave received in donations relat i ve to other candidat e s
and by month.The data come from the U. S . Fe d e r a l
Election Commission.
F i n a l l y, the Digi t a l E a rt h . g ov initiat i ve is an effort
to provide a virtual representation of the planet enabling
a nyone online to “explore and interact with the va s t
amounts of natural and cultural information gathered
about the Eart h .” Not yet fully functional, the site does
offer a series of operational prototypes, including three
dimensional (3D) interactive models of the entire Eart h
o f f e ring detailed we ather data collected via sat e l l i t e
around the globe, i n t e r a c t i ve 3D terr e s t rial topogr a-
phic visualizations of any part of the Earth,and much
m o r e . One of the principal agents in the Digi t a l E a rt h
i n i t i at i ve is the U. S . g ove rn m e n t . In contrast to day s
p a s t , g ove rnment agencies, such as NASA, can now
easily bring their “ n e w s ” directly to the public via the
Internet.
This third example also illustrates an important shift
in the long-standing relationship between news sources,
news organizations and the public. In the past, n e w s
sources had to be challenged almost exclusively through
news organizations before the public. In turn , the public
looked almost exclusively to news organizations to fil t e r ,
or act as gat e k e e p e r , for news produced by others.T h e
I n t e rnet changes this triangular relat i o n s h i p. N ow ori-
ginal sources of news and the public interface directly.
