By using this original brick-making process, the costs of
building a small house can be halved.
Brazilian chemist and civil engineer Francisco
C a s a n ova makes houses for the poor. He has
developed a technique that has allowed fami-
lies to move out of their shacks and into proper
houses with solid wa l l s.Working alone, he teaches
700 low-income people—80 per cent of them slum-
d we l l e rs—to make special bricks which halve the
cost of building a house.Then they learn how to
build their own houses and can earn some money
by working in one of the five co-operat i ves set up by
Casanova to make and sell the bricks.
Casanova,45,who teaches civil engineering to
p o s t gr a d u ates at Rio de Janeiro Federal Unive rs i t y,
is a solitary campaigner who does not rely on help
from the gove rnment or any big company. “ Po l i-
ticians don’t want people to organize among them-
s e l ve s ,” he say s.“ T h e y ’re afraid of losing control of
them.”
His personal battle invo l ves teaching more than
just the basics of civil engineering.What his pupils
also learn in his classes are the principles of citi-
z e n s h i p. “I’m not doing this for religi o u s , p o l i t i c a l
or financial reasons,” he says.“I want to see people
becoming more confident. The idea is to teach
people to fish and then give them a fishing rod.It’s
not much good just giving them the fish.”
In the three ye a rs his project has been going, a
lot of fish have been caught. His impove rished pupils
h ave built 18 houses for themselves to live in and
another 10 are planned over the next year.
The country’s first 
self-governing condominium
Another triumph for Dr Casanova is the Duque
de Caixas slum, in the Baixada do Rio de Ja n e i r o —
one of the poorest places in Rio prov i n c e . In the ye a r
2000,it will have the country’s first self-governing
c o n d o m i n i u m . About 15,000 bricks are ready for
C a s a n ova ’s pupils, who will build 10 houses with
them.The land still has to be bought, and this will
be done with funding from the Research Assistan-
ce Fo u n d ation of Rio de Janeiro (FA P E R J ) , the only
public body interested in helping the project.
C a s a n ova will sign agreements with other
d e p a rtments at his unive rsity to provide the condo-
minium with solar powe r , its own water puri fic at i o n
system and a plan for organic gardening and fa r-
m i n g .The residents will be pupils of Casanova who
c u rrently live in the Rato Molhado (“Wet Mouse”)
s l u m , among fil t hy puddles, foul smells and violent
drug-dealers.
It has not been easy for Casanova .S o m e t i m e s
d ru g - d e a l e rs have ordered work in a slum to stop,
apparently because they are suspicious of social pro-
jects and help from outside which they fear might
u n d e rmine their authority in the slums.The big hou-
sing deve l o p e rs do not like this kind of project either.
When Casanova teaches people to make cheaper
c e m e n t , it means less business for them.“The deve-
l o p e rs try to block anything that cuts costs,”he com-
plains. But he is not deterred by such threats.
W h at dri ves Casanova in his lone crusade is gr a-
t i t u d e , especially towards his unive rs i t y, which is
public and free. He regards his unive rsity studies as
a kind of gift from society.“Society has allowed me
to study,” he says,“and if there’s anything I can do
in return,then I must do it.”
But this does not stop him criticizing scientific
research geared to developing discoveries made in
rich countri e s. “Ninety-nine per cent of what the
u n i ve rsity does serves the interests of those who can
afford to pay,” he notes.
It is true that Brazil’s unive rsity system is 
heavily involved in projects sponsored by big firms
such as the oil company Petrobras and the Rio de
Janeiro subway system. U n i ve rsity departments are
researching into fields like high speed calculat i o n
and high-resistance cement manufacture.“On top
of that ,” he say s , “the unive rsity is the home of
e l i t e s.” In defiance of this elitism, three ye a rs ago he

to attend the classes and when the money supply dri e d
u p, they va n i s h e d . “The project is working today
because people are working to build their own homes,”
says Casanova.
Some businessmen are also turning to 
C a s a n ova , but he says “the product isn’t really accep-
ted by the market” because it is not designed to make
a profit and is not pat e n t e d . Under Brazilian trade and
i n d u s t ry ministry ru l e s ,C a s a n ova ’s technique cannot
easily be registered because the bricks are made nei-
ther of new mat e rials nor in a new way.The only inno-
vation is in the proportion of the ingredients used.“ I t
would be like patenting the recipe for chocolate cake,”
he says with a smile. n

International Year 2000: peace is in our hands
brought 15 of his building technology students to
the unive rs i t y.When they went into the canteen, t h e
u n i ve rsity students were shocked and the most pre-
judiced even laughed at them.
“I brought these people from the slums without
telling the unive rsity because I knew that if I had
they wouldn’t’ve been allowed in,” says Casanova,
who eventually managed to get them registered at
the unive rs i t y. After the project achieved intern a-
tional recognition, there were no more problems.
“ To d ay, no one dares to criticize me,” he say s
happily.
Dulcinéia da Rocha is 60 ye a rs old and the kee-
nest of Dr Casanova ’s students. After studying, s h e
decided to teach, became his unofficial assistant
and recently went to Paris with him to present the
project at UNESCO Headquart e rs together with
other grassroots anti-poverty initiatives within the
f r a m e work of the UN Decade for the Eliminat i o n
of Pove rt y.The trip was a dream come true for Dul-
cinéia, who lives in the Rato Molhado slum and is
one of the lucky future ow n e rs of a new house in
Duque de Caixas.
A non-profit technique
without a patent
C a s a n ova spent 400 reals (about $200) on da
R o c h a ’s visit to Pa ris and also bought her a set of
false teeth because she did not want to go without
first visiting the dentist. But she paid Casanova back
with interest by becoming an excellent example of
wo m e n ’s determ i n ation to bu i l d . “Some men don’t
seem to have a will to live ,”he say s ,“ but women will
do anything to change their lives.”
The seeds of Casanova ’s revo l u t i o n a ry enter-
prise were sown in 1973,when he was an enginee-
ring student and began studying road-building tech-
n o l o gi e s. “One day I said to my s e l f : ‘ W hy don’t
people use this technique to make bricks? If we can
make cheaper roads, w hy not cheaper houses too?’”
Ye a rs lat e r , one of Casanova ’s students received a
letter from someone who had bought a machine for
making bricks and didn’t know how to use it. C a s a-
nova helped him and,after the story appeared in a
popular magazine, s t a rted hearing from people wa n-
ting to learn how to build their own houses.
Offers of funding followed,although not many
actually mat e ri a l i z e d .The Comunidade Solidari a
p r o gramme run by Ruth Cardoso, B r a z i l ’s Firs t
L a d y, d o n ated 33,000 reals ($16,500). But fin a n-
cial aid turned out to be no more than chari t y,
because the pupils were paid 50 reals ($25) a day
Former slum-dwellers, Francisco Casanova’s pupils have built 18 houses of this type for
themselves and their families. A dozen more are under construction.

becoming more confid e n t .

to fish and then give them
