IN the twentieth century news has
become a necessity for millions of
people. The desire of men and
women to be informed, expanding With
the growth of education, has been
accompanied by immense.progress in the
technical, development of means of
communication. Today, in fact, there is
no longer any technical barrier to stop
or even to slow down the exchange of
information.
And yet the facts¡ and figures collected
by the United Nations show many gaps
in the world network of communications
facilities. Unesco, concerned with the
quality and quantity of news reaching
the public, has surveyed the world's in¬
formation resources and has drawn up a
complete inventory over a period of five
years.
These investigations show that very
few countries or territories are entirely
lacking in some form of press, film or
radio facilities. But the question is
whether the "man in the street" can
count, as part of his day-to-day ex¬
perience, upon access to news concerning
more than purely village affairs. On
this basis, a large part of the world must
still be classified as under-developed.
The world picture must necessarily be
shown in general terms. Firstly it is not
easy to establish a hard and fast line
between sufficient and insufficient news
facilities; secondly certain countries may
be relatively well equipped in, say,
radio, but have a far from satisfactory
press; thirdly, within generally under¬
developed areas are found occasional
"pockets" where the information media
are highly developed. _
With these reservations it may be said
that a privileged zone is made up of
Canada and the United States; the
whole of Europe, but more particularly
western and northern Europe; Australia,
.New Zealand and Japan. By contrast,
the under-developed zone, which is
much, vaster, includes practically the
whole of Africa, the Middle East,
Central and Southeast Asia, and to a
certain extent, Central and South
America (1).
IN the field of press, the United
States is by far the luckiest of all
countries with an average annual
consumption of newsprint exceeding
35 kilos per inhabitant. With smaller
papers, though with an equal or even
higher distribution per population, the

highest figures in Europe and Oceania
reach approximately 15 kilos per in¬
habitant. By comparison, the highest
figures reached in the under-developed
zones are: for South America, 8 kilos;
for Africa, 5 kilos; for Asia, 3.6 kilos.
However, the disparity between the
United States and Europe takes no
account of the fact that while European
newspapers have fewer pages, they do
not necessarily contain less news than
American papers.
In Africa, out of fifty-odd territories,
only nine (Egypt, the Union of South
Africa, Southern Rhodesia, the Gold
Coast, the three French North African
territories and the islands of Mauritius
and Réunion) have more than ten
copies of daily newspapers per 1,000
inhabitants. Of these nine, only one,
the Union of South Africa, has more
than fifty. In Asia, the situation is
similar, only eight countries having
more than ten copies per 1,000. For
Central and Southern Asia, including
India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, the
figure varies from less than one to a
maximum of six. In Asia, however, we
find two countries in which the press
has attained what might be called full
development: Israel, with 286 copies per
1,000 inhabitants, and Japan with 334.
There are marked differences in the
structure of communications facilities,
one of the chief reasons perhaps being
political. Unlike the situation in Africa,
where most territories are non-self-
governing, the great majority of Asian
countries are independent States. A
striking characteristic of the press in
Asia is the large number of daily news¬
papers that appear in many countries:
thirty or more in Burma, Syria,
Thailand; fifty-five to sixty in Iraq and
Pakistan, nearly 100 in Indonesia, 578 in
India. Yet the average circulation of
these newspapers is about 3,000 copies;
only a few exceed 25,000.
In Central and South America the
press is relatively more developed, in the
sense that, with the exception of Haiti
and one or two Non-Self-Governing
Territories, nowhere are there less than
ten copies per 1,000 inhabitants. But
for the majority of countries the figure
is under" fifty, and for only three
(Argentina, Uruguay and Panama) is it
over 100.
The total world circulation of daily
newspapers is 217,174,490. Europe, with
400,000,000 inhabitants, leads with
92,228,400. North America, with
225,000,000 inhabitants, has the second

largest with 61,457,000. Oceania has a
circulation of 4,504,100 copies for
14,000,000 inhabitants; while Africa has
the smallest circulation, with 2,226,090
for 203,000,000 inhabitants. Three
countries United States, United King¬
dom and Japan have 53 % of the total
world circulation.
In continents where the press was
developed earlier, the tendency towards
concentration has become more marked
with an increase in , individual cir¬
culations as the number of newspapers
diminishes. The most typical ' example
of this phenomenon is found in the
United Kingdom, which has the largest
daily newspaper circulation per 1,000 in¬
habitants (611 copies per 1,000 in¬
habitants). Whereas the total daily
newspaper circulation in the United
Kingdom is 31,000,000 (more than half
the circulation of all dailies" in North
America) there are only 122 daily news¬
papers. This is less than the number
of daily newspapers published in Mexico
(162, with a circulation of 1,300,000) or
in Argentina (140, with a circulation of
1,800,000), and only slightly higher than
the number of dailies -appearing in
Turkey (116, with a circulation of
692,700). - .
For the world the average circulation
of daily newspapers per 1,000 inhabitants
is 88. The United Kingdom has the
highest average circulation figure : 611
per 1,000 inhabitants. Australia, with
416 per 1,000 inhabitants, New Zealand,
with .358 per 1,000 inhabitants, and
Canada with 248 per 1,000 inhabitants,
are also high up on the list, which tends
to prove that the evolution of the press
in the Dominions follows that of the
United Kingdom.
If the 7,520 daily newspapers published
throughout the world are grouped ac-
cording to language of publication, it is

Taking into account the lack of inform¬
ation about newspapers in Russian, the
press in the Chinese language comes
next (904 dailies), but it is far smaller
than the English language ; press. If
one considers the circulation figures for

The best figure for Europe is 300, and
for Oceania 250. By comparison, the
highest figure for both South America
and Asia is 125; for Africa, less than 50.
Africa is worst equipped. Most African
territories are non-self-governing, and
to all intents and purposes the press,
film and radio have- been developed-
exclusively for the relatively small white
population. Few ..territories have as
many as one radio receiver per 1,000
inhabitants. The principal exceptions
to the above figures are the French
North African territories, Egypt, and the
Union of South Africa.
There has been a considerable effort
throughout - Asia in recent years to
develop broadcasting, but the average
number of receivers per 1,000 inhabi¬
tants rarely exceeds five, and is in some
countries less than one.

(centre) while technical progress has now made
it possible to transmit photographs by telephone
across the world (right). The most industrially
developed areas are well supplied with means of
The countries of Central and South
America have in general much more
developed communications, though, once
again, within this general area there are
marked differences. Only in one or two
cases are there less than twenty receiv¬
ing sets per 1,000 population.
To evaluate cinema-going facilities we
may take as a unit of measurement the
capacity of theatres, in terms of the
number of seats per 1,000 inhabitants.
Here one reservation is needed. Where
the cinema-going habit is firmly estab- .
lished, all towns of a certain size have
their permanent "picture-palaces", and
it is relatively simple to collect statistics
as to their capacity. But even in these
countries, many villages are served by
travelling projectionists who set up their
apparatus once or twice a week in a
local hall; and in the United States there
are over two thousand "drive-in" . cine¬
mas where seating capacity cannot be
' calculated exactly.
In the under-developed countries,
mobile projection units operating in
schools, public halls, even in the open
air, often serve a larger public than do
the few permanent cinemas.
. It is nevertheless significant that in
the developed areas there are rarely less
than thirty seats per 1,000 inhabitants
(in several there are more than seventy)
whereas, with the exception -of the
Middle East, there are generally less
than four in Africa and Asia. There
is greater activity in film production in
Asia than in Africa, but exhibition faci¬
lities are less developed. The over-all
average of the number of seats per 1,000
inhabitants is little above two.
There are six world news agencies :
three American. (AP, INS, UP), one Bri¬
tish (Reuters), one French (Agence
France-Presse) and one Russian (TASS).
In 54 countries there are today 76
national agencies which provide a daily
service of local news. The list of these
agencies shows that the different parts

regions are completely uninformed about what
the rest of the world is doing and thinking.

of the world are very unevenly
informed of happenings in their own
-countries. The regions which are best
off are those where the development of
education has permitted a powerful
press and broadcasting industry to come
into existence.
In many countries, particularly, in
Africa, South America and Central
America, the general public has to
depend for news of national events on
the sparse correspondents of the too
often ill-equipped local newspapers. In
some, such as Mexico and Egypt, they
have actually to rely on foreign agencies
for it. For the under-developed regions:
in Africa, only four territories have
national news agencies; on the whole of
the American continent, outside of the
United States and Canada, only five
countries have national agencies; and
in Asia only fifteen.
What do these facts and figures add
up to?
First, every country in the world
depends on the six world agencies for
getting its national news brought to the
attention of the outside world; second,
every country in the world depends on
the six world agencies for its supply of
foreign news; and third, many of the
countries which as yet do not have
national ' agencies depend to a large
extent on the world agencies for the
supply even of their own national news.
The first point is a cause of under¬
standable anxiety to many governments,
which naturally resent the fact that
news of their country reaches the world
exclusively through a foreign enterprise.
Moreover, there is a limit to the amount
of news that can be carried in a day's
file, with the result that news of a small
country has little chance of getting into
the main service unless it concerns a
subject of world-wide importance or is of
a sensational nature.
This leads to the second point. The
fact that six agencies constitute the only
source of world news does . not mean
that every country receives the services
of all six. In fact, only Afghanistan,
Indonesia, Iran, Japan, and Lebanon,
with Hong Kong and Berlin, can be said
actually to receive world news through
all six agencies, and they account for
little more than 8 per cent of the total
world population.
The effect of this situation on freedom
of information is clear. The reason
preventing the creation of national news
agencies in all countries, or of new
world agencies is essentially economic.
A news agency must have clients willing
to pay enough for its services to cover
at least its costs of operation. The
moment an agency is forced, in order
to cover its cost, to accept money other
than for services rendered, be it a
government subsidy or a grant from any
private body, its status and services tend
to be regarded with suspicion.
Hence, though temporary measures,
including government subsidies, may
be considered practical necessities to
assist in their creation, in the long run
independent agencies can only exist
where press and broadcasting enter¬
prises have first been sufficiently
developed.
What are the obstacles to development
of the Press?
Foremost is the illiteracy rate. Though
literacy statistics are mostly little
better than estimates, it may be said
in general that the commonly prevail¬
ing rate of illiteracy in Africa is between
80 and 90 per cent, and in Central and
South America slightly over 50 per cent.
Nevertheless there has been in recent
years a truly world-wide movement
towards education, and in several
regions where literacy campaigns are
being carried on, it has already been
found that the problem is not that of
teaching the relatively simple mechanics
of reading, but of ensuring a supply of
reading matter for the new literates.
The second obstacle is inadequate
supplies and equipment for the Press.
The problem of newsprint Is of such
importance that a separate section of
this report has been devoted to it. Less
crucial, but by no means unimportant,
is the question of composing and print¬
ing machinery.
Finally, there are the obstacles
inherent in the economic life of a news¬
paper. An independent press obtains
its resources in two ways : by the sale
of copies and by advertising. But in the
economically under-developed countries
revenue from advertising is difficult to
obtain,, and the life of a newspaper will
be precarious if it must rely largely on
the sale of copies where the purchasing
power of the population is low.
Many of the difficulties encountered
in other media do not arise, or are less
acute, in broadcasting, and under-deve¬
loped countries wishing to expand their
information facilities would do well to
concentrate first on this medium. For
countries with a high proportion of illi¬
teracy the advantage of radio is obvious,
and the immediacy of radio, and its
relative cheapness, give it a decided
advantage over the film. ,
