A prince embro i d e re r
without a kingdom
Tiao Somsanith is among the last of a dying breed skilled in gold-thread embroidering, an ancient
tradition from the court of Luang Prabang in Laos. Today, he is trying to save this vanishing art,
without resorting to commercialism
he Laotian prince-embroiderer Ti a o
Somsanith has lived in the French royal
city of Orléans, or more exactly in the
suburb of Saint-Marceau, since 1985.To
reach the two small rooms of his home
filled with Laotian court treasures, y o u
must leave Orléans and cross the Loire
R i v e r.With a little imagination, it recalls
the Mekong, which flows past Luang
P r a b a n g, once the royal capital of
L a o s, where the smooth-faced, n i m b l e -
fingered “young man”was born 43 years
a g o.
That court vanished after the Pathet
Lao communists took power in 1975 in
the aftermath of the Vietnam Wa r.“ M y
maternal grandfather was the last
viceroy of Laos,” says the prince. “ M y
paternal grandfather was a famous court
h i s t o r i a n , and his wife was an excellent
e m b r o i d e r e r. My father was advisor to
the king in Vi e n t i a n e, the administrative
c a p i t a l .”
A secret gard e n
He has not lost stock of his rank and
d u t i e s.“ The mission of the royal family
and the viceroy was to protect c u l t u r e
and tradition,” he says.“One of them is
the gold thread embroidery that is
s p e c i fic to the Luang Prabang court.
Only women of noble birth were
allowed to learn this craft, w h i c h
probably came from China, j u d g i n g
from the technique and symbolism of
d e s i g n s, such as the dragon.”
During the Laotian cultural week
last March in Orléans, visitors could
admire a lavish red and gold silk
ensemble that the queen would have
worn either for her coronation in Luang
P r a b a n g, had the monarchy not been
a b o l i s h e d , or to celebrate New Ye a r ’s,
had she not perished in a re-education
c a m p. It took the prince one long year
working at night to make the garment,
since he earns a living by running a
daytime creativity and self-expression
workshop for mentally handicapped
a d u l t s. Before that, he gained degrees in
fine arts and psychology in Fr a n c e.
“I drew inspiration from the
writings of my father, who was in charge
From his two-room home outside Orléans (France), Tiao Somsanith embroiders by night to complete a prayer fan,intended for a pagoda in

of protocol,” he says.“I remember the
festivals that punctuated life at the
c o u r t , where an appropriate outfit was
necessary for each ceremony.This work
represents both my secret garden, m y
h i s t o r y, and the cultural heritage of
L a o s.”
The costume reflects the court’s
h i e r a r c h i e s, with colours and
embroideries corresponding to social
s t a t u s.Culling from a repertory based on
w i l d l i f e, f l o w e r s, mythology and
Buddhist iconography, e m b r o i d e r e r s
were nevertheless free to compose
n u a n c e s, the movement of embroidered
patterns and to model reliefs with gold
and silver braiding. “ The yellow of the
j a c k e t , reserved for the queen, r e c a l l s
the dazzling sun, and the red of the skirt
evokes the blood of life,” e x p l a i n s

The royal ornamentation
embroidered by the prince includes
golden phoenixes taking flight among
interlacing plant patterns. Like an
endless river, they continue on the back
of the jacket, suggesting the eternal life
cycle and the wheel of reincarnation.
“ I ’ve embroidered good-luck bats, b i r d s
of paradise with elephant trunks and
b u t t e r flies symbolizing the ephemeral,”
he says.
Somsanith borrowed these designs
from inscriptions he gazed at on the
ceilings of pagodas as a child. H e
embroidered without using the carved
wooden templates, which were
indispensable for beginners who
fastened them to silk with big stitches
and reproduced the outlines with gold
t h r e a d .
Only experienced embroiderers
between the ages of 30 and 40 reached
that level of perfection. The road was
long and the apprenticeship arduous.
The prince, who was the last in a family
of nine children living in Vi e n t i a n e, s p e n t
summers with his grandmother in Luang
P r a b a n g. “I was so rambunctious that
my parents sent me to keep her
c o m p a n y,” he recalls laughing. “I also
met some of the requirements for
learning this exclusively feminine
p r o f e s s i o n , which is passed down from
mother to daughter.”
At six, like all nimble-fingered
a p p r e n t i c e s, the prince was coating silk
threads with wax to make them
straighter and threading them into
needles for his grandmother and aunts,
who worked in a special room every
m o r n i n g. In the hope of being released
from this painstaking work, s o m e t i m e s
the young prince secretly finished his
g r a n d m o t h e r ’s embroidery, trying to
copy her style.
“By the time I was 10 or 12, I already
had a certain amount of experience,”
he says. “My grandmother probably
guessed what I was up to, a n d
introduced me to the art of purling by
letting me finish the buds on a bouquet
of flowers she had started.”
Back to
the pagoda
The different steps in an
e m b r o i d e r e r ’s career were clearly
spelled out. Little girls traced the edges
framing the designs and decorated
pillows and prayer cushions.A d o l e s c e n t s
embroidered skirts and collars. A d u l t
women made their wedding dresses,
ceremonial costumes and burial clothes.
Between 50 and 60, at the peak of their
s k i l l s, they gradually stopped making
secular garments to focus on religious
accessories intended for pagodas.
Religion is exactly the means by
which Somsanith intends to breathe new
life into his art. In August 2001, t h e
e m b r o i d e r e r-prince is going to Luang
Prabang to offer one of his works—a
prayer fan decorated with a Buddha in
the teaching position—to the Sene
p a g o d a .
Now this guardian of an endangered
tradition has just one goal in mind:
passing it on to young Laotians, a n d
introducing the diaspora to the art of
living that goes with it.
He refuses to give into the
temptation of the market.“Some of my
relatives embroider to order for tourists,
especially from Th a i l a n d , and rich
families of the diaspora. G o l d - t h r e a d
embroidery is acquiring a market value
and losing its meaning. The women
wearing them are parvenus who only
care about the glittering outer
appearance of things without knowing
their intrinsic value.”
The prince wants to pass on both
technique and meaning. “ E m b r o i d e r y
is more than just a technique…. E v e n
though an embroidered garment might
only be worn once during an exceptional
c e r e m o n y, it requires an apprenticeship
that is so long it builds character, a n
idea that has fallen by the wayside.
Passing this tradition down from one
generation to the next also teaches
future artists that they are merely
p r a c t i t i o n e r s. Before setting down to
w o r k , my grandmother performed her
devotions to the inspiring spirits and
the ancestors who trained her to bring
about her act of creation.”
With exhibitions, lectures and a
documentary made with the Fr e n c h
national research council, Somsanith is
also sounding the alarm on the
disappearance of other crafts connected
to gold-thread embroidery, such as
l a c q u e r i n g.“ The last master lacquerer is
81 years old and no longer working. H e
has stopped making the baskets
