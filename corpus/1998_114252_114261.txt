Copyright becomes US export leader
Copyright industries have become the leading export from the United States,
according to Wired, a magazine specializing in the new technologies.
These industries which are growing by around 5 per cent a year finally took
first place after coming second for seven years. They brought in $60.18 billion in
foreign sales in 1997, W i r e d s a i d , citing a report released on 7 May 1998 by the
International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA),a coalition that includes the
Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of
America,and the National Music Publishers Association. The Alliance said that
the core copyright industries, which include the cinema, recording and softwa r e
i n d u s t r i e s, had displaced the traditional export leaders—agriculture, a e r o s p a c e
and automobiles.
The IIPA report was released at a time when copyright lobbies were pushing
for the United States to strengthen its intellectual property legislation. ■
