The origin
of the elements
AS the Universe began to cool after
the Big Bang in which it was
born, clouds of gas were able to
collapse under the pull of their own
gravity and form stars. But those first
stars did not contain the rich diversity of
chemical elements that we find on Earth
today. Only hydrogen and a little
helium about 20 per cent of the total
matterwere created in the Big Bang
itself; all of the other elements, including
the carbon in your body and the oxygen
in the air that you breathe, have been
manufactured inside stars and spread
across space by stellar explosions
supernovae.
A first generation star, containing only
hydrogen and some helium, would have
formed as a ball of gas, contracting under
the pull of gravity and getting hotter in
the middle, as gravitational energy was
converted into heat. Higher tempera¬
tures mean that the particles in the heart
of the young star move faster and collide
with one another more violently. At a few
thousand degrees, electrons are stripped
from their atoms, leaving a sea of pro¬
tons (hydrogen nuclei) constantly col¬
liding with one another. And at a tem¬
perature of about 10 million degrees K
two protons that collide with one another
stick together. Each of these protons
carries a positive charge, but when they
stick together the pair emit a positively
charged counterpart of the electron,
called a positron, and one of the protons
thereby becomes converted into a
neutron. The combination of one proton
and one neutron forms the nucleus of an
atom of heavy hydrogen, deuterium. And
when that deuterium nucleus collides
with another proton, it can stick to form
the nucleus of an atom of helium, a varie¬
ty called helium-3 containing two pro¬
tons and one neutron. Two of these
helium-3 nuclei in turn combine to form
one nucleus of helium-4, containing two
protons and two neutrons, with the
release of two protons hydrogen
nuclei which go back into the stellar
melting pot.
The net effect of this cycle of activity
is to convert four protons into one
helium-4 nucleus, and to release energy.
This is nuclear fusion, the basis of the
hydrogen bomb. A star like the Sun, in¬
deed, is the cosmic equivalent of a
hydrogen bomb, one which explodes
continuously for ten thousand million
years. The energy released keeps a star
hot In the middle and holds it up against
further collapse, for as long as the supply
of hydrogen fuel lasts. Ultimately, how¬
ever, the fuel must run out as all of the
hydrogen in the middle is converted into
helium. At that point, the star will begin
to collapse again, getting hotter still in its
heart, with pressure building up until
conditions are so extreme that the helium
nuclei themselves begin to combine,
with three nuclei of helium-4 getting
together to make one nucleus of carbon,
which contains six protons and six
neutrons. Once again, this process
releases energy (now at a still higher
temperature) and the collapse is
halted until almost all the helium has
been converted into carbon. Then, the
whole cycle repeats again, with suc¬
cessively heavier elements being built up
in the central regions of a massive star as
it gets older. This happens quickly for
massive stars, and any massive first
generation stars formed when the
Universe was young have all long since
burned out.
The heaviest element that can be made
in this way is iron, the most stable ele¬
ment of all. Whereas fusion of lighter
elements to make heavier elements
releases energy all the way up the ladder
toaron, to make the heavier elements it is
necessary to put energy in to force the
nuclei to combine with one another. This
How helium is formed from hydrogen in a star.

only happens in very massive stars but
when it does happen, it happens in spec¬
tacular fashion.
When a very massive star has used up
all of its nuclear fuel, and has grown a
core of gaseous iron, nuclei pounding
against one another at a temperature of
tens of millions of degrees, there comes
a time when no more energy is being
released and it can no longer hold itself
up against gravity. This happens when
the iron core is about one and a half times
the entire mass of our Sun, for a star
whose total mass is ten or more times the
mass of our Sun. At this point, the iron
core collapses very suddenly to a
superdense state in which all of the pro¬
tons and electrons fuse together to make
neutrons. The equivalent of the entire
mass of our Sun is packed into a ball of
neutron matter no bigger than the island
of Manhattan. And this collapse releases
an enormous amount of gravitational
energy, which goes into the outer 90 per
cent of the star. In the early phase of the
resulting explosion, atomic nuclei are
forced together to create the heavy
elements, such as lead and uranium;
then, split-seconds later, the entire outer
part of the star is ripped away and scat¬
tered across space. Eventually, the
elements created inside the dying star
will become part of new gas clouds in
space, which will collapse to form stars
and planets, like our Solar System. Our
Sun is a later generation star, and that is
why it contains some elements other
than hydrogen and helium, and why it
has a retinue of planets made out of
heavier elements. We owe our life to the
death throes of stars.

The Sun, a main-sequence star, Is a
dense spherical mass of glowing matter
1,392,000 kilometres in diameter. Con¬
sisting largely of hydrogen, and with a
temperature at its centre of an in¬
conceivable 13 million degrees Cen¬
tigrade, it Is a seething cauldron In which
electrons are stripped from their atoms
and nuclei collide and fuse In a series of
reactions which have the net result of
converting hydrogen Into helium. The
Sun is about half way through its cycle of
life as a main-sequence star; In about
5, 500 million years it will have burnt up Its
supply of hydrogen and will die. At the
Sun's surface, gases carrying away heat
from the Interior seethe and bubble, pro¬
ducing flares and prominences that erupt
hundreds of thousands of kilometres Into
space. Photo, taken from Skylab 4, In
December 1973, shows a prominence
spanning some 586,000 kilometres, one
of the most spectacular ever recorded.
