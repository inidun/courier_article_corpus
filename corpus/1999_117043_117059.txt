G e r m a n y : the d a r k
shadow of the past
w Hartmut We w e t z e r
Memories of the Nazis’ eugenics ideology provide a sombre 
backcloth to German debate on applications of human 
genome re s e a rc h
Germans tread very delicately in the field of
b i o e t h i c s. When the birth a cloned sheep
called Dolly was announced in 1997, it set off
wild speculation in the media.The idea of cloning
humans was immediately dubbed immoral and set
off a barrage of condemnation from many politi-
cians, scientists, church officials and environmen-
talists. It had already been formally banned by a
1990 German law protecting embryos.
Why is there such near-unanimous agreement
about this and why are people so touchy when it
comes to discussing biology, medicine and ethics?
Why is Germany so far behind in what bioethicist
Ludger Honnefelder calls its “ability to think and
judge” in these matters?
We have to remember the horr o rs perp e t r ated by
the Nazis in the name of eugenics.These pseudo-
s c i e n t i fic theories developed in the 1930s, and from
1939 on they were used to justify, among other
t h i n g s , the exterm i n ation of Je w s , h a n d i c a p p e d
people (100,000 of whom were subjected to “ e u t h a-
nasia”in the space of five years) and gypsies.
In the name of science and “the master race”,d o c-
t o rs and geneticists performed horri fic experi m e n t s
on human guinea pigs.“The whole subject was taboo
among German scientists until the early 1980s,” s ay s
Benno Müller-Hill,a geneticist at Cologne Unive rs i t y
who published a book in 1984 called “ M o rtal Science”.
“We can’t walk past this ocean of blood and
continue on our way as if nothing had happened,”
he says. Especially as modern genetics may spawn
new kinds of “scientific racism”. It could lead, he
s p e c u l at e s , to a link being made between genes
g ove rning certain character traits, such as aggr e s s i o n ,
and membership of an ethnic group, which would
encourage discrimination.
Germany’s National-Socialist past also weighs
on the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human
Rights and Biomedicine, which Germ a ny refuses to
s i g n .M a ny politicians, r e l i gious believe rs ,e nv i r o n-
mentalists and associations of handicapped people
s ay it isn’t tough enough. They agree with the
Catholic Social Democrat Robert Antretter, who
f e a rs “a resurgence of disregard for human life as it
was applied during the Nazi era.”
They oppose parts of the convention which
a l l ow research to be done, in certain circumstances,
on human subjects who cannot gi ve reasoned
consent (mainly children and the handicapped).
They also deplore the fact that it does not ban
experiments on embryos,as in Germany. Opposi-
tion to the convention is gr owing in the German par-
liament.
‘We enjoy
disaster scenarios’
Only prenatal examinations seem to escape the
general cri t i c i s m . The churches do not strongly
oppose this practice.Wolf-Michael Catenhusen, a
Social Democrat and Secretary of State for research
in the present gove rn m e n t ,s ays it is important that
the people involved should be able to decide whe-
ther or not to bring a handicapped child into the
world. “We musn’t forget,” he says,“that in more
than 90 per cent of cases such examinations prove
parents’fears to be groundless.”
The “ h i s t o ri c ”suspicion of genetics does not seem
to have lessened since the coalition gove rnment of
Social Democrats and Greens took office in 1998.T h e
Greens are critical of modern medicine and science.
“ P r o gress in biomedicine calls into question our
concept of what it means to be human,”s ays Monika
K n o c h e , the Greens’ health expert .
G e rman scientists and industrialists stress that the
c o u n t ry must not get left behind by its foreign com-
p e t i t o rs in the field of the new technologi e s.“ We enjoy
disaster scenari o s ,” f o rmer President Roman Herzog
once said.“Nearly all discove ries raise many questions
about the risks and dangers invo l ve d , but few about
the opportunities they prov i d e .” n
