Drought over Africa
The eleven
worst-stricken countries
Ghana
Most affected provinces: upper and
northern regions.
Ghana, almost self-sufficient in cereal
production ten years ago, is today facing a
severe economic and financial crisis ag¬
gravated by the recent prolonged drought.
The marked deterioration of agricultural
production compounded by the non¬
availability of transport and fuel, the poor
road network, the lack of storage facilities,
and reduced purchasing power has had im¬
mediate impacts on the nutritional status of
mothers and children.
The infant mortality rate, which was
steadily diminishing, is now on the increase
throughout the country and especially in
the north.
Food shortage is especially dramatic in
the northern part, since a serious logistic
problem has to be overcome to facilitate
food distribution in this region.
Burkina Faso
Most affected regions: the northern
part of the country (Sahel region).
Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, the
fifth poorest country in the world with one
of the highest infant mortality rates, has
been seriously affected by drought and
desertification ever since 1 968. The lowest
recorded rainfall for 30 years was
registered in 1 98 1 when about one-third of
the country's livestock was lost due to
drought. 1983 was another peak drought
year, especially in the northern part of the
country where the harvest failed
completely.'
In a country where the health and nutri¬
tion status of children and mothers is nor¬
mally already very poor, the present
drought renders them even more vulnerable
to communicable and parasitical diseases
as malnutrition increases.
Large-scale imports of basic foodstuffs,
which have become an annual feature of
the country's battle for survival, were again
needed in 1984 to meet the food shor¬
tages. Seeds for the next planting season
will also be required.
Mauritania
Most affected provinces: nine regions
(out of a total of 1 2).
The drought situation, which has existed
for over ten years, became particularly
serious in the course of 1983. In certain
localities, rainfall levels were the lowest in
70 years. The Senegal River rose only to
10% of its normal rainy-season level, thus
preventing water-recession agriculture,
and the losses of animals and grazing land
have been massive.
Difficulties in the supply of milk and meat
are foreseen due to the present large-scale
sale of livestock at low prices. Current
cereal production is estimated at 15,000
tons (against 61,000 tons in 1981/1982),
which represents only 6% of consumption.
Severe cases of malnutrition are already
recorded in some areas (numerous cases of
vitamin deficiency, especially scurvy and
anaemia).
Zimbabwe
Most affected regions: all eight pro¬
vinces (the outskirts of the country
more than the centre).
According to government estimates,
malnourished children total 464,200,
and only 244,400 are currently
assisted.
Zimbabwe is suffering the third year of a
drought which is the worst in living
memory. No surplus food is currently
available and the situation is not expected
to improve with the next harvest. The
maize shortfall over the next 15 months,
entirely due to the drought, is estimated at
838,000 tons.
Amongst the vulnerable groups, the
health condition is often very serious.
Drought relief programmes are being co¬
ordinated by the Zimbabwe government
and include the distribution of basic food
rations and supplementary feeding
programmes.
Ethiopia
Most affected regions: Wollo, Gon-
dar, Eritrea, and Tigre.
Number of affected persons:
5,200,000 out of a total population of
32,395,000
The percentage of those under the age of
15 affected varies from 37 to 68% in dif¬
ferent regions. In addition, about 2.2 million
displaced people need assistance. Several
administrative regions have not had rain for
three consecutive crop seasons. The most
affected regions are all in northern Ethiopia.
Serious food shortages are also occurring
in other administrative regions of Ethiopia.
Some 52,950 people in the region of Bale,
278,830 in the region of Hararghe, and
35,250 in the region of Gojjam require im¬
mediate assistance; 122,000 in the Soha
region, 2,530 in Arussi, 79,880 in Gemu-
Goffa are likely to require assistance.
165,040 nomads in the Sidamo ad¬
ministrative region are also in dire need of
assistance. In addition, some 221,610
displaced persons in the Gondar, Hararghe,
Bale and Sidamo regions require immediate
assistance.
Mozambique
Most affected regions: Gaza, Inham-
bane, Maputo, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala,
Manica.
Number of affected persons:
4,700,000.
Mozambique has been experiencing
severe drought for the past four years, with
an aggravation of the situation in 1 982 and
1983. Gaza, Inhambane, and Maputo are
considered to be the most seriously af¬
fected. FAO estimates that 4.7 million peo¬
ple, especially in rural areas, are affected,
including 1 .8 million in the southern pro¬
vinces alone. Moreover, the Maputo pro¬
vince was struck by a cyclone at the end of
January 1984 and more than half of the
population was affected by the complete
loss of summer crops.
The cereal imports required by the coun¬
try at large are estimated at 600,000 tons
as opposed to 300,000 tons in normal
years.

Chad Mali
Most affected provinces: Kanem,
Biltine, Batha.
Number of displaced and affected
persons needing emergency assistance:
Kanem, 200,000; Biltine, 50,000;
Batha, 50,000; the majority are women
and children.
The. situation is catastrophic due to 17
years of internal conflict, a decade of
drought, lack of adequate administrative
structure, and a very poor internal com¬
munication network.
Chad is presently totally dependent on in¬
ternational food aid for its survival. The
Comité Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la
Sécheresse au Sahel (CILSS) estimates that
the structural food deficit in Chad is 1 5,000
metric tons a year. The Ministry of Natural
Calamities estimated the net food deficit
for 1983/1984 at 107,557 tons.
The most severely affected groups are
women and children. They are facing
serious malnutrition and illnesses caused
by nutritional deficiencies and lack of drink¬
ing water (scabies, malaria, measles, in¬
testinal infections, tuberculosis).
Niger
Most affected provinces: Zinder and
Diffa.
Number of affected children: 23,800.
Niger, which has a large external debt, is
like other Sahelian nations facing the con¬
sequences of uncertain rainfall. In 1983
and 1984 persistent drought severely af¬
fected certain pockets of the population,
especially in the areas of Zinder and Diffa in
the south-east.
On the other hand, in some other parts of
the country, harvests were more or less
satisfactory. Although some food stocks
are available, many households in both rural
and peri-urban areas do not have the pur¬
chasing power to buy them.
Most affected provinces: all the
Sahelian zone of the country (Gao and
Timbuktu regions).
Number of affected persons:
2,500,000 of whom 1,100,000 are
children under the age of 15 and
500,000 under the age of five. These
figures exclude migrants from
neighbouring countries, as their present
number is difficult to evaluate.
Chronic drought has affected the
Sahelian region of Mali (two-thirds of the
country) since 1 969. The severe drought of
1968-1974, with the peak year of 1973,
drastically reduced livestock levels. There
was some improvement between 1 976 and
1978,' but since 1980 the recurrence of
serious drought conditions has again
resulted in a drop in food production and the
herd level.
The situation worsened in 1 983; the rain¬
fall throughout the country has never been
so poor and the level of the rivers is the
lowest recorded this century. Most of the
lakes are now dried up.
Many of the water points where seden¬
tary and nomadic people are now concen¬
trated are not equipped to cope with the in¬
creased numbers. This creates a spreading
ground for diseases and epidemics and puts
the children in particular at high risk, all the
more because the areas severely affected
by the drought are also seriously under-
equipped in the social and health fields.
It is feared that the catastrophic death
toll of 1973-when 90% of the children
under the age of five died in the camps that
had been set upwill recur if no urgent ac¬
tion is taken to rehabilitate the health and
nutrition conditions.

As we go to press, new and higher figures for
the numbers of people affected are being
quoted. Some authorities now estimate the
figure for Ethiopia, for example, to be as high
as 7,000,000.
Senegal
Most affected provinces: the river
region, the north, and the Louga and
Linguere regions.
Number of affected persons:
1,100,000 among whom 500,000 in
the most vulnerable group (children,
pregnant and nursing mothers).
Senegal has been suffering over the last
1 5 years, and especially for the last seven
years, from a severe drought that has
seriously affected the population and the
local economy. Drought conditions drive
cultivators and nomads towards the towns,
which are totally unable to support them.
The 1 983 rainy season was particularly
poor and the harvest available for consump¬
tion in 1983/1984 was estimated at half
the normal annual production. The cereal
deficit itself was estimated at 370,000
tons.
Angola
Most affected provinces: central and
southern provinces.
Number of affected and displaced
persons: 1,000,000.
The drought began in 1980/1982 in the
central and southern provinces. More than
260,000 people are affected and among
these almost 80% are women and children.
A succession of dry seasons has con¬
siderably reduced food production, and the
decline in the price of oil, coffee, and
diamonds on the world market has also
considerably reduced export earnings at a
time when large-scale importation of food
is necessary.
In addition to the deteriorating economic
situation, the political and military conflict
has displaced and affected many more
people.
Heavy rains during February and March
1984 had disastrous effects on the road
conditions, housing, sanitation, and crops
as floods washed away seeds and young
plants.
Today in Angola, one-third of the children
die before their fifth birthday.
