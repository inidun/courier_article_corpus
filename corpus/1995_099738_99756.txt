Some of the neediest people of Pune, an
Indian city (pop. one million) 200 kilometres
south of Bombay, recently took the initiative
of launching a garbage-recycling programme
that brings them a small income as well as
helping to improve the city's hygiene. Some
10,000 women rag-pickers methodically sort
the 600 tons of garbage thrown into the street
each day and then sell recyclable material at
one of 150 "shops" forming part of a buyers'
co-operative. One quarter of the city's waste
is sent for recycling In this way. After three
years' efforts the rag-pickers have succeeded
in forming their own trade union which defends
their rights and today has 4,000 card-carrying
members.
