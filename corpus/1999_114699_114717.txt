The Greek philosopher Plato believed that
p h i l o s o p h e rs are wise men who devote their live s
to learning how to die and that philosophy,
among other things, is a long and difficult learn i n g
process which teaches us to gr ow old and face up to
the climactic moment of our live s.There is nothing
melancholy about this process of “ l e a rning to die”.O n
the contrary, it means that it is only towards the end
of our days that we are really able to profit from life and
confront the imminence of death with fortitude and
d e t e rm i n ation and without despondency. In the minds
of the ancients, living to a ripe old age offered not so
much respect from society as a reassurance that they
would pass on gently from the world of the living to the
kingdom of the dead.
The culture of Antiquity suggested that two
f o rms of existence were wo rt hy of emulat i o n :t h at of
heroes like Achilles who enjoy a short and action-
packed life, and that of venerable elders who learn to
lead quiet and secret inner lives in accordance with
the ideal of Stoicism. In a way, it was impossible to
e nvisage these pat t e rns of individual behaviour in
i s o l ation from each other, and the models for living
they offered were highlighted when the two we r e
c o n t r a s t e d .As a result, our cultural tradition has for
c e n t u ries made an almost religious cult of the two
archetypes pers o n i fied by the hero and the elder.
According to the form e r , the hero’s brave ry is a
quality which makes it possible to confront the ri s k s
and vicissitudes of life and which steels the character.
The second conjures up an image of the experi e n c e
and peace of mind which, so the Roman philosopher
Seneca believe d , only comes with old age, in other
words when the desires of the flesh forsake us and the
mind becomes detached from sensuality and soars in
fli g h t .To cut a long story short , the ancients felt that
it was best to die either ve ry young or ve ry old, s i n c e
old age, in spite of its disadva n t a g e s , was the age of
reason in which the mind finally tri u m p h s.
H owe ve r , we no longer live in the age of ancient
Greece or the Renaissance or even of old-fa s h i o n e d
bourgeois society, which also flu c t u ated betwe e n
the ideal of the hero and the culture of the pat ri a r c h .
Ours is a society which has left traditional values
behind and is dangerously inclined to offer an
e x c l u s i vely technological solution to all life’s
p r o b l e m s. I t ’s not so much that we disregard the
value of the experience or tradition which used to
f o rm a natural part of the knowledge of ve ry old
people as that we have learned that no wise pers o n ,
however retentive or sharp their memory may be,
can remember as much as a computer, as the
champion chess-player Gary Kasparov discovered
(although he, i n c i d e n t a l l y, is still regarded as being
a young man).
Enduring suffering and solitude
Our collective ideal is machine-like, and we know
t h at when machines gr ow old they are taken out of
commission and dismantled and their parts recy c l e d ,
or else they are sent to the scrapyard to be broken up.
We do the same with our old people so that ,a l t h o u g h
technology has succeeded in extending the limits of
our useful lives as never before and in balancing our
d i e t , and is gradually unravelling all the secrets of our
b o d i e s , it does not seem to have found a sat i s fa c t o ry
a n swer to living in old age.The religion of modern i t y
only wo rships youthful gods. Our world has come to
be populated by splendid young people who are
s u p e r ficial and pampered and whose impulsive
b e h aviour knows no bounds, and by gr ow i n g
n u m b e rs of old people who, as the French thinker
Jean Baudrillard has observe d , inhabit a kind of  T h i r d
World of existence.People with no future and painful
m e m o ries of a past in which nobody is interested, t h e
denizens of this Third World are condemned to live in
a mundane present dedicated to generating profit s
for the powerful cosmetics and mass touri s m
i n d u s t ries and for the pension and insurance system
t h at manages wo r k e rs ’s av i n g s. No matter how much
technology may have improved their lot, the status of
old people bears no resemblance to the remedy for all
ills preached by the ancient Stoics.The onset of old
age not only brings the threat of sufferings that we r e
not known in the past,such as A l z h e i m e r ’s disease,bu t
is also compounded by such misfortunes as solitude,
to which there is no easy answe r. Only by adopting a
new Stoicism, a rule for living which teaches us how
to gr ow old and die, as it did in the past, shall we be
able to prevent the gr e ater life expectancy due to
technical progress from bri n ging new and painful
e x p e riences in its wa k e . ■
