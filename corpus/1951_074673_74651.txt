THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
PERIODS of international ten-
sion do not lend themselves
to the advancement of the
freedoms and rights of
mankind. On the one hand,
rearmament and the security
measures taken in the different
countries inevitably lead to a
restriction of liberty and act as a
drag on social and educational
progress. On the other hand, on
an internatlonal level, the repre-
sentatives of the various govern-
ments are less inclined to assume
new obligations for their countries
and to allow international organiz-
ations any greater.'right of in-
spection"in matters so far regard-
ed as purely national.
It is therefore hardly surprising
that in 1951, six years after the
signature of the United Nations
Charter and three years after the
adoption of the Universal Declar-
ation of'human Rights, the
labours devoted by the Commiss-
ion on Human Rights to the
Covenant and the methods of
implementing it have not yet led
to results that can be submitted
for the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations,
now in session in Paris.
The general public is justifiably
uneasy at this long delay. The
contrast between hopes and facts
- too often harsh-is all the more
keenly felt because, thanks to the
United Nations information servi-
ces and to the laudable efforts of
Unesco, the Non-Governmental
Organizations and a large number
of educationists, the public has
become familiar with the terms of
the Universal Declaration, and now
awaits the completion of the other
two panels of the triptych pro-
mised to the peoples of the world.
But what the public does not
know-and here it is our duty to
enlighten it-is the immediate, the
outstanding difficulties with which
those working on the Covenant
have met. In this connection,
there are, as I see it, four fund-
amental questions.
What form of covenant 1
1"he nrst relates to the content ofthe future Covenant. Would it
be better to have (as the British
and the Americans, supported by
India, suggest) a number of se-
parate pacts, ratified independently
of each other, each covering one
group of related freedoms and
rights (individual, civil and public
freedoms ; economic, social and
cultural rights ; family rights ;
political rights, etc.) ; or, as ass-
erted by the Slav countries and
certain European, Latin American
, by Ren√© Cassin,
Vice-Chairman of the U. N. Commission on Human Rights.
and Asiatic States, to adopt a
single Covenant, in conformity
with a Declaration inspired by the
unity of mankind, and thus, at one
stroke, convert most of the rights
and freedoms proclaimed in that
Declaration into binding legal
obligations ?
The 1950 Assembly, in giving its
instructions to the Commission on
Human Rights, opted for the
second of these ideas. And in the
spring of 1951 the Commission pre-
pared a draft in conformity with
this ruling, taking account of a
French suggestion that allowance
should be made for differences in
the wording of the pledges given
by the various States, which should
correspond to the differences in
character between options of free-
doms (calling for legislation in-
volving no very great expense) and
individual rights requiring State
aid (such as social reforms and
long-term plans backed by large-
scale resources).
Both groups-the advocates of
the multiple and those of the
single form of Covenant-intend
to raise the question again, for the
purpose of wresting from the 1951
Assembly a hard-and-fast ruling
in conformity with their views. We
ourselves hope that the General
Assembly will reject both of these
extreme solutions, for the adoption
of either would considerably delay
the date at which our work could
be brought to fruition.
Supervision of progress
The second difficulty is to decidewhich international organiza-
tions shall be entrusted with super-
vising the progress made by each
State in the field of human rights,
and with considering any com-
plaints that may be made against
one State or another on the ground
that it has violated the Covenant.
Here we are faced with two
ideas that are not easy to recon-
cile. The first is that the general
safeguarding of human rights is a
matter for the United Nations-
more particularly for their Com-
mission on Human Rights, which
was set up in accordance with the
Charter-and, in regard to certain, oaf these rights, for the Specialized
Agencies, like the International
Labour Organization, Unesco,
WHO, etc. But according to the
second idea-that of equality and
reciprocity between States-those
signing and ratifying the Covenant
would be authorized to reject all
interference or supervision at the
hands of countries that refused to
accept the obligations of the
Covenant as binding upon them-
selves. Care must be taken not to
alienate the most co-operative
among the States by giving them
reason to fear that they may be-
come the guinea-pigs of a world-
wide experiment, the continual
butts of the rest.
Here again a constructive basis
is offered by the draft Covenant.
It vests the right of general and
periodical supervision of the pro-
gress achieved in the signatory
States, and even in those bound
only by the Charter, in the Com-
mission on Human Rights, whose
authority would be linked and co-
ordinated, if need be, with that of
ILO, Unesco, etc. The right to
deal with complaints made against
a signatory State would be vested
in a new body, made up of inde-
pendent persons of distinction,
who would be selected by the
International Court of Justice
from nominees proposed only by
the signatory States.
Much, it is true, still remains to
be done. The question arises, for
instance, whether this future Com-
mittee is to be maintained at the
expense of the United Nations as a
whole, or only of the signatories to
the Covenant. But the right path
seems to have been found ; as the
adherents to the Covenant in-
crease in number, the difficulties
will progressively diminish.
Appeals against violations
T* he third crucial difficulty con-sists in deciding who is to be
entitled to appeal to the new
Human Rights Committee in the
event of any violation of human
rights in a given country. Should
the appeal be made only by
another signatory State, as desired
by those governments which dis-
like innovations ? Or should the
right of petition be extended also
to individuals (even against their
own government) and to non-
governmental organizations, such
as those which have already been
granted consultative status (A. or
B.) by the United Nations ? The
importance of the point at issue
can be easily perceived : either out-
dated procedures must be main-
tained, or else there must be a
juridical revolution, enabling a
private individual to appeal to an
international body against any
administrative measure, verdict or
law of his own country which, in
his view, violates the Covenant on
Human Rights.
A certain number of States have
already signified their willingness
to sign a separate Protocol, grant-
ing the right of petition against
themselves on a basis of recipro-
city, and in accordance with a form
of procedure that differs apprec-
iably from the European Pact on
Human Rights. But Uruguay has
put forward another idea, which
it suggests should be incorporated
in the Covenant itself-that the
right of appeal to the Human
Rights Committee, independently
of any particular State, should be
granted to a United Nations At-
torney-General, representing the
international community. Some
people consider that a transitional
measure such as this would enable
progress to be made, and provide
an escape from the dilemma,
without crossing the Rubicon at
one stride !
Sacrifice of sovereignty
T* he fourth question consists indeciding how the Covenant is
to be applied within a Federal
State or Union of States which in-
cludes federated States, provinces
and colonies enjoying a certain
mesasure of legislative autonomy.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
(Continued from page 2)
The exchange of knowledge between peoples began early in history and developed concurrently
with the growth of travel. One example, shown above in an 18th century engraving, was the setting
up of an observatory in Pekin, by the Jesuit Fathers. Today, the right to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas regardless of frontiers remains an indispensable condition of human progress.
To grant these States the right
to a special system, wherein the
obligations would be less strict
than in the case of affiliated
States, would be a breach of the
equality and reciprocity which are
the corner-stones of international
relations. To refuse to grant such
a right, however, would bring
about a very long delay in the
ratification of the Covenant by
such States, and in its extension
throughout the world. Hence the
need for a fresh solution, which
has not so far been found.
In point of fact, all the diffi-
culties I have described can be
summed up more or less as
follows. To what extent will
"sovereign"States consent to
waive their"sovereignty"in the
interests of the world-wide advan-
cement of human rights ? Their
present position rather resembles
that of the fathers of families in
ancient times, who had power of
life and death over the other
members of the tribe or the
domus, and who lost the more
menacing features of their pa-
ternal authority only gradually,
through the influence of custom,
as they were integrated into the
larger social group of the city or
State.
We cannot and must not hope
that all the attributes of State
authority will be transferred to an
organized human community ; and
such a hope would be illusory.
But the international protection of
human rights, which at the be-
ginning of the nineteenth century
took the form of a systematic
campaign against the slave-
traders, can surely not fail to show
equal vigour under the auspices of
the United Nations Charter, whose
purpose is to prevent the reap-
pearence of some new Hitler.
Merely to put the question is to
answer it. If human rights are
gravely injured in any one part of
the world, nothing can prevent the
united race of Mankind from feel-
ing the smart. Implementation of
those rights is, therefore, simply a
matter of time and of the deter-
mination of the different peoples,
which must be upheld by the tech-
nical procedure of the law.
But, speaking of technical pro-
cedure, we should surely rely at
least as much on constructive co-
operation as on abstract super-
vision, censure, or coercion.
For there are many States that
are not even in a position to
implement, by their own unaided
efforts, human rights so univers-
ally accepted nowadays as the
right of every child or adult to be
taught to read and write and
receive fundamental education. It
is not by inveighing against these
States that we can fill the gaps in
their educational organization ; it
is by helping them without hurting
their feelings or interfering with
their independence-by means of
international intellectual, tech-
nical and financial co-operation.
The Commission on Human Rights
has understood this, and its
Covenant, especially those clauses
dealing with the right to education
and to the benefits of culture, is
pervaded by that positive spirit
which informs Unesco's plans and
must take precedence over the
negative spirit of stricture or
censure.
The struggle for human rights
has been going on for centuries.
The setbacks which have only too
often occurred were perhaps due
to a lack of unity among the
various social or national groups,
and to insufficient pressure by
public opinion.
To conclude : the future imple-
mentation of human rights will go
hand in hand with the peaceful
and resolute extension of co-
operation between individuals and
groups, within the vast framework
of the international institutions.
