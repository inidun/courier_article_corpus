THE supply and demand of
education for women
would seem to be in¬
separable from the position oc¬
cupied by women in each different
society. Consequently, the educa¬
tion of women calls to mindia dou¬
ble mirror which simultaneously
reflects both general educational
trends and the status of women.
A straightforward analysis of the
figures relating to the education of
girls and women reveals that a
smaller proportion of them are
enrolled in school than boys, that
their schooling is often disturbed,
that there are disparities in their
distribution among the different
types of education, and that their
education is turned to little account
in working life. The underlying
causes of these trends are to be
sought outside the classroom.
As long as education to a given
level is not fully extended in prac¬
tice to all the members of the age
group concerned, the proportion of
girls enrolled is smaller than that of
boys. In the developing countries
in 1980, girls constituted 43 per
cent of the pupils enrolled in
primary education as against 49
per cent in the industrially
developed world. The overall in¬
crease in numbers of girl pupils
(which is spectacular in the
developing countries) does not
mean that there is equality of op¬
portunity between the two sexes.
It simply reflects a position in
which girls were poorly
represented in education at the
outset, and sheds light on the
development of education in
general.
In many cases girls' school
careers are characterized by
absenteeism, grade repetition and
early leaving. And the difference in
the illiteracy rates between the
two sexes is a good indicator of a
form of discrimination which does
not disappear when the level of
development of schooling rises. In
this connexion a Unesco study
presents data which show
significantly that these disparities
are, more strongly marked in the
south European countries than in
most developing countries.

Towards equality
for women in education
by Maria Eliou
The distribution of female pupils
among the various types of secon¬
dary education reveals disparities
which are concealed by the global,
figures. Whereas girls are more or
less well represented in general
education, they are generally
under-represented in technical and
professional education, except for
training leading to the service
industries.
It is quite clear that this trend is
influenced by the "sexist" ¡mage
of different kinds of training and
the professions to which they lead.
The labels of "men's" or
"women's" jobs can be seen in the
background of choices which may
seem free in the sense that they are
not dictated by formal rules
whereas in practice freedom of
choice is virtually non-existent.
In higher education women are
still in a small minority in fields of
training which offer the best pro-^
"As long as collective mentalities support the traditional division of roles, the evolution of women's education will
continue to mask the persistence of their traditional status".

fessional prospects. It may be in¬
structive to compare the data in
Unesco's Statistical Yearbook
(1982 edition) for the enrolment
rates of male and female students
in two fields of study: literature,
religion and theology on the one
hand, and engineering sciences on
the other. In the fifty-seven coun¬
tries for which the data exist,
whatever their level of economic
and educational development,
whatever the rate of participation
of young women in higher educa¬
tion, whatever the school system
or the socio-economic system, the
same trends recur: with few ex¬
ceptions women tend far more
often to study literature than men,
but above all far fewer of them
without any exception are enrolled
in institutions which train
engineers.
Thus the individual and collec¬
tive investment represented by the
education of women is turned to
little account, or else it is subtly
diverted in the sense that it serves
only to give "added value" to what
is expected of women as mothers
and housekeepers.
In other words the education of
women bristles with ambiguities.
There is a blatant contradiction
between avowed egalitarian aims
and actual practices, the latter of
which stem from the differentiated
roles, implicitly arranged in a
hierarchy, of men and women. As
long as collective mentalities sup¬
port this traditional division of
roles, the evolution of women's
education will continue to mask
the persistence of their traditional
status.
However, in the last few years
there has been a growing
awareness of these mechanisms,
giving rise to a different conception
of education for women and of
educational policy in this field.
The United Nations Decade for
Women, especially such events as
the World Conferences of Women
in Mexico City (1975) and
Copenhagen (1980), has given a
strong impetus to this movement,
and today the different interna¬
tional organizations are tackling
the complex question of women's
status in an open-minded, forward-
looking spirit.
The major programme on the
status of women in Unesco's
Medium-Term Plan (1984-1989) is
particularly relevant here. The goal
it seeks is no longer equality of ac¬
cess (to education or employment)
but "equal opportunities and
responsibilities in access to
resources as well as in decision¬
making"; it is stressed that this
issue is "basically a political prob¬
lem and that it is related to the
balance of power". For women the
implications of this position would
include "taking advantage of the
education that they have received
in order to gain equivalent
economic, social or political
power" to that of men, and not, for
example, being inclined "more
often towards literary studies...
which provide fewer job oppor¬
tunities than training in science and
technology."
"Whereas girls are more
or less well represented
in general education,
they are generally under-
represented in technical
and professional educa¬
tion ... This trend is in¬
fluenced by the 'sexist'
image of different kinds
of training and the pro¬
fessions to which they
lead." Right, woman

In 1980 the question of the
educational and vocational
guidance of women one in which
many countries have shown a
strong interest in recent years-
was examined in a number of
Unesco studies and then con¬
sidered in international meetings
such as the international congress
on the situation of women in
technical and vocational education
(Bonn), the international seminar
on opening up to women of voca¬
tional training and jobs traditionally
occupied by men (Frankfurt) and
the international seminar on
women's education, training and
employment in developed coun¬
tries (Tokyo).
This development has come
about through the support at world
level of a women's movement
which has emerged from the
overall thrust of feminist forms of
expression and from trends which
are as yet still vague and
unformulated.
The women's movement cuts
across not only countries and
régimes, social classes and parties,
but other social movements as
well. Essentially subversive, since
it tends towards the overthrow of
the existing male-dominated order,
it is fundamentally creative in the
sense that it proposes to join with
other movements in a creative
quest for the development of
tomorrow's societies.
In many countries the movement
has led to a spectacular upsurge in
women's studies (see the Unesco
Courier, July 1980, pages 28-34).
The status of women is no longer a
phenomenon hidden from view or
explored only by courageous
pioneers, it is a subject which is
now being studied in countries as
diverse as the United States,
Argentina, Canada, India and
Tunisia. International meetings on
research and teaching with regard
to women (especially the meeting
of experts held by Unesco in Paris
in May 1980; the meeting of Arab
women researchers, also organiz¬
ed by Unesco and held in Tunis in
April 1982; the international sym¬
posium organized by the Simone
de Beauvoir Institute of Concordia
University, Montreal, July-August
1982) have taken stock of these
activities and drawn conclusions
with a view to more effective ac¬
tion in the future.
Interest is also growing in the
field of non-formal education,
which is particularly suitable for in¬
novation. Many activities directed
"The individual and collective investment represented by the educa¬
tion of women is turned to little account, or else it is subtly diverted
in the sense that it serves only to give 'added value' to what is ex¬
pected of women as mothers and housekeepers".
towards the education and promo¬
tion of women are being encourag¬
ed by international organizations
like Unesco, the Council of Europe,
the International Council for Adult
Education, and by small, dynamic
teams of enthusiasts.
Unesco has three experimental
projects in this area: in Upper Volta
(education of women in a rural en¬
vironment); in Nepal (training
teachers for rural primary schools);
and in Chile (on the access of women
to technical secondary education
with a view to their preparation for
technical careers).
Not that the schools have been
neglected. The realization that col¬
lective mentalities have an impact on
the education of women has also led
to appropriate action concerning the
organization and content of school
programmes.
The Greek educational system is
now totally co-educational. In the
Netherlands a large number of
specific measures have been taken
on the principle that "education
should not encourage the determina¬
tion of respective roles but should on
the contrary create the conditions for
maximum fulfilment irrespective of
sex". Action against the inculcation
in and by the school system of
stereotypes concerning the roles of
men and women has also been taken
in Norway, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Denmark and Ireland.
The crowds of girls who throng at
the school gates, their older sisters
who intend to pursue their education
as far as possible and to reap the
fullest benefits from it, the many
adult women without qualifications
who are calling for a training which is
their due all expect to be treated by
society and the educational system'
as members of society whose
horizons will never again be delimited
by the walls of the family home.
