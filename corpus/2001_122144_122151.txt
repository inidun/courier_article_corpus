The spy
in your re f r i g e r a t o r. . .
Governments and corporations are wiring their way into your home and
you may not even notice it, according to Simon Davies. The world’s
leading privacy advocate chronicles the rise of the surveillance
society where the bedrock of civil rights—privacy—is being
systematically chipped away (pp. 20-22)
T
O imagine the year 2020, forget for a
moment the cumbersome technology por-
trayed in George Orwell’s  Nineteen Eighty-
Fo u r.If present trends continue,s u r v e i l l a n c e
tools will be so seamlessly integrated in our
environment that we won’t even notice the constant
intrusion into our privacy.
Closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) may be
the most obvious—and onerous—future intrusion.A s
is already the case in Britain (see p. 3 6 ) , cameras will
become a fixed component in the design of modern
urban centres,new housing areas,public buildings and
the road system (thanks to a massive network of linked
number plate recognition cameras). Perhaps it is only
a matter of time before legal and community pres-
sures force the cameras into our homes.
As visual surveillance becomes ubiquitous, so will
mass surveillance of Internet and telephone activity.
American and European law enforcement agencies
have already laid the foundations for a massive eaves-
dropping system capable of intercepting all mobile
p h o n e s, Internet communications, fax messages and
pagers throughout Europe.The plan,known as Enfopol
9 8 ,has been drawn up in secret by police and justice offi-
cials as part of a strategy to create a “ s e a m l e s s ” web of
telecommunications surveillance that will one day cross
all national boundaries—touching citizens everyw-
h e r e.
The strategy will oblige all ISPs (Internet Service
Providers) and telephone networks to provide
agencies with “real time, full time” access to all com-
m u n i c a t i o n s,regardless of the country of origin.All new
communications media, including interactive cable
t e l e v i s i o n , will be required to do the same.
Enfopol will be aided by a subject-tagging system
capable of continually tracking targeted individuals.
Known as the “International User Requirements for
I n t e r c e p t i o n ” ( I U R ) , the system, which is currently
being designed, will include not only the names,
addresses and phone numbers of targets and asso-
c i a t e s, but email addresses, credit card details, P I N s,
passwords and even geographic data from mobile
p h o n e s.
Enfopol is just one of several burgeoning systems
used to monitor and profile international
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s. Perhaps the most astounding is
E c h e l o n ,a global eavesdropping system established by
the U. S. National Security A g e n cy that is further dis-
cussed on pages 34-35.
Perfect surveillance requires perfect identity, a n d
the next 20 years will see a comprehensive effort by
authorities to achieve this end. As well as creating
D NA databases—notably to identify people convicted
of violent crimes and missing children—governments
and companies are likely to expand the use of national
electronic finger and hand-scanning systems.
Known as “biometric identifie r s,” these systems
are already used throughout the world.They are sup-

posedly able to perfectly identify an individual by
electronically scanning the fine details of a hand,fin g e r
or eye (retina). Spain has begun a national fin g e r p r i n t
system to control unemployment benefits and health-
care entitlements. Russia has announced plans for a
national electronic fingerprint system for banks.Ja m a i-
cans are required to scan their thumbs into a database
before qualifying to vote at elections. In France and
G e r m a n y, tests are underway to put fin g e r-print infor-
mation onto credit cards.
For the past five years, the U. S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) has been developing an
automated passport control system using hand geo-
metry captured on a “ s m a r t ”computer chip card.At the
a i r p o r t , frequent travellers present their card and then
pass their hand through a scan. More than 70,000
people have already enrolled in the plan which,a c c o r-
ding to an INS spokesman, will be expanded world-
w i d e.
But it is the growth of workplace surveillance that
will most directly affect people.In a majority of coun-
t r i e s, employers are permitted—“within reason”—to
place all employees under constant surveillance.Th e y
can tap phones, read email and monitor computer
s c r e e n s. They can bug conversations, analyze com-
puter work, peer through CCTV cameras and use
tracking technology like “ s m a r t ” ID badges to even
monitor trips to the bathroom.I n d e e d , employers now
routinely insist on urine tests to detect drug use and
review the most intimate personal and medical data.
The current telephone software for keeping tabs on
employees’ calls seems primitive compared to the new
g e n e r a t i o n , which can analyze keystrokes on a ter-
minal to determine if time is being efficiently used
between conversations.Even highly skilled workers can
expect to be regularly put under the microscope. I t ’s
likely that network-operating software (which lets
you exchange files with a colleague) already permits
your manager to eavesdrop by observing your screen
in real time, scanning data files and email and even
overwriting passwords. All of which leads us in one
d i r e c t i o n : the workplace of tomorrow will have many
features of the Dickensian workhouse.
Even your home will not be free from surveillance.
The new generation of interactive digital television
(known as i-TV) services, currently being developed,
will offer a new intimacy between TV service pro-
vider and customer. By directly drawing information
on viewing habits,financial transactions and on-screen
“vox pop” s u r v e y s, the company can create a com-
plex profile of every customer.
A recent investigative book, S py T V (edited by
David Burke,an American researcher), describes how
i-TV broadcasters will use neural network software to
create “psychological profil e s ” and then “modify the
b e h a v i o u r ”of viewers.B a s i c a l l y,your TV will show you
a product, monitor your response and then show you
something else based upon it.This cycle will let your T V
set learn enough about you until it has you doing what
it wants.And one day, the person controlling your T V
will be replaced by a computer running artificial intel-
ligence software.
P r i v a cy is and will be eroded in countless other
w a y s. Mobile phones are being turned into geogra-
phical tracking devices with the aim of providing cus-
tomers “ u s e f u l ” i n f o r m a t i o n , like the location of the
nearest petrol station or an advertisement for a local
r e s t a u r a n t . The question is not whether you want or
need these services, but do you want to be trailed? 
You are probably already being followed on the
I n t e r n e t .While some on-line companies keep track of
consumers’ purchases, others offer personalized ser-
vices like news searches, free email and stock portfo-
l i o s.They then sell or trade this information to business
associates without the consumer’s consent (see p. 2 4 ) .
Every time you visit a website, a small file contai-
ning an ID number—known as a “cookie”—is auto-
matically placed on your hard drive to make it easier
to “ fli p ” back through pages on a website. H o w e v e r,
advertising networks can use a single cookie to track
a user across thousands of websites.The Internet Engi-
neering Task Force (made up of network designers,v e n-
dors and researchers) is now developing a system to
assign a permanent ID number to every device, like a
V C R ,hooked onto the net.So it may be only a matter
ot time before  somebody somewhere knows exactly
what you keep in the refrigerator. ■
