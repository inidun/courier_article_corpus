Indian media expert Sevanti Ninan* re g rets that the absence of community media is depriving
r u ral Indians of information they need
What is the status of community radio, newspapers
and television in India?
A m a z i n g l y, a large vibrant democracy like India
is totally devoid of a tradition of community radio sta-
t i o n s ,whereas neighbouring countries like Nepal,B a n-
gladesh and Sri Lanka have allowed them.The Indian
g ove rnment is not interested in allowing community
radio centres because it is wo rried that secessionist
groups and some non-gove rnmental organizat i o n s
could use them to spread subve rs i ve propaganda. I
think this fear is unfounded,since there are always safe-
g u a r d s , as in the case of commercial broadcasting,
through which you can term i n ate licences and seize
the equipment of broadcasters who violate ru l e s.
In the case of community newspapers , there are no
legal hurdles, but it costs a lot to start a newspaper,
h owe ver small it may be. In the past, community news-
p a p e rs have not been able to generate sufficient adve r-
tising reve n u e , unlike the mainstream dailies, and as
a result many of them have closed dow n .In recent ye a rs ,
some pri vate cable operat o rs in the big cities have star-
ted providing community news and inform at i o n ,bu t
again these are ve ry small initiat i ve s.A c t u a l l y, there is
no culture of community media in India.
Do you think countries like India are losing out socially
and politically by restricting the number of voices that
can be heard in small media like community ra d i o ?
The restriction of community radio means that vil-
l a g e rs are not getting the local inform ation they need
about crop gr ow i n g, c attle diseases and commodity
p ri c e s.Mainstream as well as marginalized groups have
their own communication needs. I n f o rm ation should
be gi ven in local languages,and it should be recognized
t h at communication needs differ from region to regi o n
and community to community. In many deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries like India the existing media do not alway s
take account of these issues.
In Medak district in the southern Indian State
of Andhra Pradesh, UNESCO has helped set up a
small local radio station with a 100-watt trans-
mitter which still awaits gove rnment approva l . It wa s
to be run by rural women members of a local NGO
and would help them to send messages to members
of their group and other organizations in the area.
The women argue that without a communication
channel of their own, which is the case at present,
their work is much more complicated.
U n f o rt u n at e l y, there has been no sustained
campaign on behalf of community radio in India. I n
1995 the Supreme Court ruled against gove rn-
ment control of the airwaves and declared that they
belong to the public, but so far no individual or
group has sought legal intervention to help them
start up a community radio centre.
What is the status of the Internet in India?
In India use of the Internet is less dive rse than in
the We s t . E - c o m m e r c e , I n t e rnet magazines and
I n t e rnet-based news sources have yet to become as
popular as they are in the developed wo r l d .This could
be due to the fact that in India there are more Intern e t
u s e rs than subscri b e rs.People are accessing Intern e t
mainly through Internet cafes and pri vate computer
centres rather than through connections of their ow n
at home or at wo r k . So they spend less time surfing the
net than Internet users in the We s t .
India has only recently allowed pri vate Internet ser-
vice prov i d e rs to operat e .The cost of Internet sub-
s c ription is falling as a result, but computer prices are
still high. An average middle-class person cannot
afford to buy a computer as it costs four times more
than a television set.So the Internet is accessible only
to a select group of people. To narr ow the gap, t h e
g ove rnment should introduce a computer policy to
b ring down the prices of computers and install them
in community centres. If this is done, then there is a
chance that the Internet will spread much faster and
more evenly than at present. ■
