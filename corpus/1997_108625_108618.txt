ALMYRA faces that belong
to eternity
by Mahmoud Zibawi
Palmyra, "city of palms", was founded in an oasis between the Orantes and the Euphrates in the heart of
the Syrian desert towards the end of the third millennium B.C. It was the capital of Palmyrene, an ally of
Rome atthe beginning of the Roman empire (late 1st century B.C.). It enjoyed a golden age during the
reign of Zenobia in thethird century A.D., until it was sacked by the Roman emperor Aurelian in 273. In the
following centuries it recovered some of its importance, but never again played its former role. Its ruins
are among the most important of late Antiquity. One original feature of Palmyra is funerary sculpture
whose hieratic images and spiritual intensity transcend Greek, Roman and Persian influences and
foreshadow Byzantine art.
This marble head of
the Roman general
and politician Caius
Marlus (1st century
B.C.) ¡s a
masterpiece of
realistic Roman
statuary.
The finest specimens of
Palmyrene sculpture were
produced during the first three
centuries of the Christian era, at
a time when the pax romana
encouraged long-distance trade.
They belong to the art of the
Roman Middle East, where Hel¬
lenistic influence prevailed in an
area stretching from Egypt to the
borders of Mesopotamia. The
blending of civilizations and cul¬
tures in the melting pot of the
Roman Empire infused a new
.spirit into art. The classical mod¬
els of Rome, which still lived on,
were taken up and recreated
rather than imitated. The art of
Palmyra incorporates features
that came from the Persian
empire, while also displaying the
influence of local Syrian and
Mesopotamian traditions and of
Oriental traditions in general.
A salient feature of this sculp¬
ture is that each figure is pre¬
sented frontally and as an individ¬
ual. This concern for individuality
is particularly noticeable in the
funerary statues, in which
Palmyrene sculptors gave their own
twist to classical Roman portrai¬
ture, which in the second century
A.D. was moving away from real¬
ism towards idealization. The
extraordinary variety of types pro¬
duced by the realism of early
Roman statuary is replaced in the
imperial period by a gallery of ide¬
alized portraits. Strict individual
resemblance is abandoned. Artists
depict personages with imaginary
features. Figures from the past
and portraits of contemporaries
are reinvented. Rulers and sub¬
jects alike are shown with divine
attributes and are masked with
idealized faces.
This trend in Roman statuary
had a profound effect in the east¬
ern provinces of the Roman
empire. Emphatic stylization
deliberately transgressed the
canons of naturalistic beauty. An
attempt was made to purge the
human face of earthly affinities
and invest it with celestial quali¬
ties. In the painted portraits of
Fayoum in Egypt and the stone
carvings of cities in the Arab
desert alike, the face is shown as
transcending place and time. With
its thin lips, sharp nose, inordi¬
nately enlarged eyes and open
gaze, it belongs to eternity.

ground burial vaults known as
"houses of eternity" are a pleiad of
faces carved in rock. On each tomb
is a stele depicting the deceased
full-length or as a bust. In accor¬
dance with the convention of
frontality, the figures face out to
us, almost always in high or low
relief (sculpture in the round is
very rare in Palmyrene art). Their
idealized and youthful faces fit
into a conventional mould and all
possess similar features. Men,
women and children are depicted
as types. Veils and curls of hair
frame oval faces. The features are
simplified; movement is restrained;
expression is concentrated.
Contemplation is the sole form
of action. Two concentric circles
(the iris and the pupil) represent
the eye. The pupils are frozen
between the eyelids. "These enor¬
mous eyes, as unreal as the folds
of the robe, seem to want to pour
forth a torrent of life, and they
alone perform the magic task of
giving life to a bust which other¬
wise lacked all semblance of
being," wrote the archaeologist
Henri Seyrig. "For the Palmyrene
sculptor the most interesting
aspect of being is its deepest and
most permanent content."
The name of the deceased is
often preceded by the Aramaean
term nafshâ, meaning "breath",
"soul" or "person". Earthly like¬
nesses have been left behind by
these faces which concentrate on

immortality. There are no explana¬
tory or descriptive inscriptions.
The contemplative gaze of the
deceased silently evokes life in
the next world. The faces of gods,
which also look out at the spec¬
tator, have the same spiritual
presence. The same face is por¬
trayed time and again. The human
becomes divine; the divine human.

The body, which is the cen¬
trepiece of classical statuary, dis¬
appears stiffly behind the drap¬
ery of costumes. The rules of
anatomy are abolished. The fig¬
ures are squat and impassive, the
forms devoid of substance. In
these hieratic carvings the folds of
garments form regular patterns in
a blend of Greek and Oriental
styles. The composition is harmo¬
niously structured, but all sense
of movement is frozen. Lively
scenes are rare. This is static, not
dramatic, art. Domestic scenes are
shown on panels above sarcophagi.
Rut rather than lively Hellenistic
banquets these are group por¬
traits where figures rub shoulders
yet remain solitary. The standing
figures rise like ornamental
columns. Being is consummated in
the inwardness of contemplation.
The religious reliefs are similar
to the funerary statues. Immobile,
alone or aligned as if on parade,
numerous haloed divinities accom¬
panied hy their symbols are shown
standing, seated, in chariots, and

sometimes riding horses or camels
in the sanctuaries of Palmyra.
Like the portraits of the dead,
these figures are depicted
frontally, their gaze fixed and
immutable. Often wearing Roman
military uniform, they herald the
future warrior saints of Christian
iconography. In some cases the
inscription giving their names
amounts to no more than an anony¬
mous adjective: one, unique, mer¬
ciful. In one corner a mortal is
depicted beside the god. lie is

"And you, streets of Palmyra/
Forests of columns in the immen¬
sity of the desert/What has become

the crossroads of Syria and
Mesopotamia, on the boundary of
the nomadic and sedentary worlds,
the great ruined city has left
these eternal faces as its heritage.
Milestones in a long history
1980: The archaeological site of Palmyra is placed
on Unesco's World Heritage List.
LOCATION:
Horns province, Syrian Arab Republic
215 km northeast of Damascus.
The oasis city of Palmyra is bounded
on the west and north by hills, and opens
onto the desert to the south and east.
The ancient city stretches out to the
northwest; the modern city occupies an
arid plateau northeast of the oasis.
HISTORY:
The oldest tools found at Palmyra
date back some 75,000 years.
Beginning of the second
millennium B.C.: first known mention of
Tadmor, the original name of Palmyra,
still used in Arabic.
3rd century B.C.: Palmyra and its
territory constitute an Arab principality.
1st century B.C.: The city is under
Roman tutelage.
Around 129: The Emperor Hadrian
makes Palmyra a "free city".
2nd century: Palmyra's golden age.
The city's trading links stretch as far as
India and China in the east, and to Italy
in the west.
Mid-third century: The situation of
the Roman empire deteriorates; Palmyra
enjoys a certain independence; Odainat,
member of a family of Arab stock,
ennobled by Septimius Severus, becomes
"Imperator", and is therebyinvested
with authority in this part of the empire.
He proclaims himself King of Kings.
268: On the death of Odainat, his
son and heir, Wahballat, is too young to
govern. Wahballat's mother, Zenobia,
exercises power with the title of most
illustrious queen. She invades Egypt.
270: The army of Palmyra occupies
Antioch, capital of Syria.
272: Roman troops led by Aurelian
enter Syria. Zenobia defends the Syrian
capital. The queen breaks with Rome and
proclaims herself "Augusta". In August,
Palmyra capitulates. Aurelian
establishes a garrison there and leaves
the city.
Spring 273: Fresh outbreak of revolt
at Palmyra. The garrison is massacred.
Aurelian returns in haste and sacks the
city. Zenobia and her son are taken to
Rome as captives. Palmyra never recovers
from this defeat.
Late 3rd century: Diocletian makes
Palmyra part of the eastern limes, the
network of routes and military posts
protecting the empire against the
Persians.
Around 400, during the reign of
Arcadius, Palmyra recovers some of its
importance.
6th century: The Ghassanid Arab
dynasty, allied to the Byzantines,
dominates the Syrian desert. The
emperor Justinian takes a keen interest
in Palmyra, renovates it, surrounds it
with fortifications, provides it with
water, and instáis a garrison.
634:Khaledibnal-Walid,oneof
the generals of the first caliph, Abu
Bakr, takes Palmyra, which again
becomes Tadmor. During the first
centuries of Islam the city graduallyfalls
into oblivion.
12th century: A new period of
prosperity begins under governor Yusuf
ibn Fairiiz. Major renovation work.
1264: Horns and Palmyra fall
under the sway of the Mamluk sultan
Baybars.
1401: Tamerlane sends troops which
sack the city.
16th-19th centuries: Under Ottoman
domination, the city's decline
accelerates. Palmyra is reduced to a
village, at the mercy of nomad tribes.
17th century: European travellers
visit the ruins of Palmyra and make
enthusiastic descriptions of them.
18th century: The English
explorers James Dawkins and Robert
Wood, in 1751, and the French
philosopher Volney, in 1787, reveal
to the world the splendour of the
forgotten site.
