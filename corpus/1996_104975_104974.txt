Anniversary
1100 years ago
Hungary's appointment
with Europe
by Péter Déme
This year Hungarians have been celebrating the 1100th
anniversary of the settlement of the Carpathian Basin by
their ancestors. According to historical sources the process
actually began in 895*, when the main mass of migrants
under their leader, Arpad, crossed the Verecke Pass in
the eastern Carpathians and descended to the plain in
response to an appeal for help by Arnulf, the Holy Roman
Emperor, who was seeking to assert his authority over the
Moravians.
The Magyars were a federation of semi-nomadic, semi-
agrarian tribes which came from the East. In their new
homeland they gradually abandoned raiding and military
expeditions, and developed new social and political stru c-
tures appropriate to a more settled way of life. Arpád's
great-grandson, Geza, played a prominent role in this
process, but it was above all Geza's son Stephen (997-
1038), the first Hungarian King, who laid the foundations
of the new Hungarian state. For his coronation, which took
place according to tradition on Christmas Day, in the year
1000, he asked the Pope to send him a crown, thereby
committing himself and his country to the Western European
world. In recognition of the long process whereby the Mag¬
yars and other peoples in the region became a European
nation in the Carpathian Basin, Hungarians are already
preparing to celebrate in the year 2000 the millenary of the
birth of the Hungarian state.
* The anniversary is being celebrated in 1996 because the Hungarian Parliament
decided that the thousandth anniversary of settlement in the Carpathian Basin
should be commemorated in 1896 instead of 1895, because many of the arrange¬
ments for the commemorative celebrations were delayed. Author's note
