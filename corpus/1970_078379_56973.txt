Last year an international group
of 14 specialists appointed by the
U.N. Secretary-General, U Thant,
undertook an extensive enquiry
into chemical and bacteriological
(biological) weapons and their
possible effects. The study was
made in collaboration with the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion, the International Committee
of the Red Cross, the Pugwash
Conference on Science and World
Affairs and the Stockholm Inter¬
nationalPeace Research Institute.
Their report described by the U. N.
Secretary-General as " concise
and authoritative " and "a docu¬
ment which provides valuable
insights into the grave dangers'
posed by the production and
possible use of these dreaded
weapons ' '. was published by the
U.N. in July 1969. Here, we
summarize its major conclusions.

The horror of bacteriological
and chemical weaponry
I
|N the vast range of
weapons of war devised by man,
chemical and biological weapons stand
in a class on their own as armaments
having an effect solely on living matter.
Such weapons are capable of inflicting
unimaginable suffering, disease and
death on vast numbers of human
beings.
The notion of deliberately using
bacteriological weapons to spread
disease arouses universal horror.
The fact that certain chemical and
biological weapons have a potentially
unlimited effect, both in space and
time, and that their large-scale use
could have irreversibly harmful effects
on the balance of nature adds to
present world fears and tensions.
No form of warfare has been more
condemned than the use of chemical
and biological weapons.
As the destructive power of arms
increased over the years, and with it
the potential for the widespread use
of chemicals, efforts were made to
prohibit the use of chemical weapons
through international agreements. As
early as the latter part of the 19th
century, the Brussels Declaration of
1894 and the Hague Convention of
1899 prohibited the use of poisons and

poisoned bullets, and a separate
declaration of the Hague Convention
condemned "the use of projectiles the
sole object of which is the diffusion
of asphyxiating or deleterious gases."
Most of our knowledge concerning
the use of chemical weapons is based
upon the experience of the First World
War. Gas was first used in 1914 and
the first big attack in 1915 claimed
5,000 human lives. It is estimated
that from then until the end of the
war in 1918, at least 125,000 tons of
toxic chemicals were used, and
according to official reports, gas
casualties numbered about 1,300,000,
of which about 100,000 were fatal.
The agents used in that war were
much less toxic than those which
could be used today, and they were
dispersed by means of relatively
primitive equipment as compared with
what is now available and in accor¬
dance with battlefield concepts of a
relatively unsophisticated kind.
Since the Second World War, the
use of biological weapons has also
become an increasing possibility.
Their potential importance in warfare
is shown by the fact that infectious
diseases, even as late as World War II,
caused more casualties among comba¬
tants than all forms of enemy action.
Because there is no clear evidence
that these agents have ever been used
as modern military weapons, dis¬
cussions of their characteristics and
potential threat have to draw heavily
upon experimental field and laboratory
data and on studies of naturally
occurring outbreaks and epidemics of
infectious disease.
The outstanding characteristic of
these weapons, particularly the biolo¬
gical, is the variability amounting
under some circumstances to un¬
predictability of their effects which
depend on environmental and meteoro¬
logical conditions and on the agent
used.
They might bear not only on those
attacked but also on the side that
initiated their use, whether or not the
attacked military forces retaliated in
kind. Civilians would be even more
vulnerable than the military. The
development, acquisition and deploy¬
ment of chemical and bacteriological
weapons quite apart from the question
of protection constitute a real eco¬
nomic burden. And no system of
defence, even for the richest countries
of the world, and whatever its cost,
could be completely secure.
Chemical agents of warfare can be
defined as chemical substances
whether gaseous, liquid, or solid that
might be employed because of their
direct toxic effects on man, animals
and plants. Bacteriological agents of
warfare are living organisms, whatever
their nature, or infective material
derived from them, that are intended
to cause disease or death in man,
animals, or plants, and that depend on
their ability to multiply in the person,
animal,.or plant attacked.
Because they themselves do not
multiply, toxins, which are produced by
living organisms, can be considered as
chemical substances. As a class,
chemical agents produce their injurious
effects more rapidly than do biological
agents. The time between exposure
and significant effect may be minutes
or even seconds for highly toxic gases
or irritating vapours. Blister agents
take a few hours to produce injury.
Most chemicals used against crops
produce no noticeable effect until a
few days have elapsed.
On the other hand, a bacteriological
agent must multiply in the body of
the victim before disease or injury
occurs. This period is rarely as short
as one or two days and may be as
long as a few weeks or even longer.
For both chemical and bacteriological
agents the speed of action is affected
by the quantity absorbed.
The effects of most chemical agents
that do not kill quickly do not last
long, except in the case of some
agents such as phosgene and mustard,
where they might continue for some
weeks, months, or longer. On the
other hand, bacteriological agents that
are not quickly lethal cause illness
lasting days or even weeks.
Chemical weapons, in addition to
their highly toxic short-term effects,
may also have a long-term effect on
the environment in which they are
dispersed. If used in very high con¬
centration they might cause damage
by polluting the air or water supplies
and by poisoning the soil.
In circumstances that favour their
persistence, herbicides, defoliants, and
perhaps some other chemical agents
might linger for months, stunting the
growth of surviving or subsequent
plant life, and even changing the floral
pattern through selection. Following
repeated use, certain chemical agents
could even influence soil structure.
The organophosphorous, or nerve,
agents have never been used in war,
and no corresponding experience is
available to help form a judgement
about their possible long-term effects.
But since these agents are toxic to
all forms of animal life, it is to be
expected that if high concentrations
were dispersed over large areas, and
This is what the World Health Organization estimates
gical weapons were made on
VX NERVE GAS
Assuming 4 tons of VX nerve gas mixture released over a line 2 kilometres
long, and 150.000 persons exposed to a lethal concentration :
80,000 persons would die before help arrived.
40,000 more persons might die within 48 hours.
35,000 persons might be saved if given immediate treatment.
10,000 survivors would require intensive hospital care.
Hospitals would be swamped and it would take two weeks to bury the
dead.
In 1955, a new class of nerve gases known as V-agents were discovered
in a commercial insecticide laboratory; VX gas is one of the most lethal of
these chemical weapons.
VX gas, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, can kill quickly by poisoning
the nervous system. g
A minute quantity (0.1 of a milligram) of VX gas can kill if inhaled, 5 milli¬
grams are fatal when absorbed through the skin. Doses as small as this kill
within hours, heavier doses kill within half an hour.
1 VX nerve gas could also be used to create long-term contamination of
ground, vegetation and equipment.

if certain species were virtually exter¬
minated, the dynamic ecological equili¬
brium of the region might be changed.
Chemical agents, usually described
In terms of their physiological effects,
include the following:
Nerve agents: colourless, odourless,
tasteless chemicals, of the same family
as organophosphorus insecticides.
They poison the nervous system and
disrupt vital body functions. They
constitute the most modern war
chemicals known; they kill quickly and
are more potent than are any other
chemical agents (except toxins).
Blister agents (vesicants): oily
liquids which, in the main, burn and
blister the skin within hours after
exposure, but which also have general
toxic effects. Mustard gas is a good
example. Blister agents caused more
casualties than any other chemical
agent used in World War I.
Choking agents: highly volatile
liquids which, when breathed as gases,
irritate. and severely Injure the lungs,
causing death from choking. They
were introduced in World War I and
are of much lower potency than the
nerve agents.
Blood agents: also intended to
enter the body through the respiratory
tract. They produce death by inter¬
fering with the utilization of oxygen by
the tissues. They, too, are much less
toxic than nerve agents.
Toxins: biologically produced che¬
mical substances which are very highly
toxic and may act by ingestion or
inhalation.
Tear and harassing gases: sensory
irritants which cause a temporary flow
of tears, irritation of the skin and
respiratory tract, and occasionally
nausea and vomiting. They have been
widely used as riot control agents, and
also in war.
Psycho-chemicals: drug-like che¬
micals intended to cause temporary
mental disturbances.
What are the possible effects of a
nerve gas attack on a city?
The population density in a modern
city may be 5,000 people per square
kilometre. A heavy surprise attack
with non-volatile nerve gas by bombs
exploding on impact in a wholly un¬
prepared town would cause heavy
losses, especially at rush hours. Half
of the population might become

a city of 5 million inhabitants
PNEUMONIC PLAGUE
Assuming an attack by a single bomber spraying 50 kilogrammes of dried
powder of pneumonic plague in the form of aerosol along a 2 kilometre line :
150,000 persons would be directly infected.
36,000 of these would die.
80,000 to 100,000 persons would require hospitalization and isolation.
Secondary cases would occur amongst the rest of the population with
perhaps 500,000 additional persons affected.
100,000 deaths in all could be expected.
People fleeing the city in terror would cause minor outbreaks in other
cities.
Burial and hospital facilities would be overwhelmed.
Plague, is highly infective, easy to prepare in large quantities and. when
stored, retains its virulence for many years.
Bubonic plague, the usual form of the disease, is spread to man by fleas
from infected rats. Between 25 and 50 per cent of its victims die if untreated.
The incubation period is 2 to 6 days.
Pneumonic plague, a more virulent form of the disease, is spread from
man to man by droplet infection. After an incubation period of 3 to 4 days
it causes primary pneumonia which is usually fatal.
The 'black death', the plague epidemic of 1348, wiped out over a quarter
of the population of Europe.

casualties, half of them fatal, if about
one ton of agent were dispersed per
square kilometre.
If such a city were prepared for
attack, and if the preparations included
a civil defence organization with ade¬
quately equipped shelters and pro¬
tective masks for the population, the
losses might be reduced to one half
of those which would be anticipated
in conditions of total surprise.
Given a town with a total population
of 80,000, a surprise attack with nerve
gas could thus cause 40,000 casualties,
half of them fatal, whereas under ideal
circumstances for the defence, fatali¬
ties might number no more than 2,000.
It is inconceivable, however, that the
¡deal would ever be attained.
Bacteriological agents could be used
with the intention of killing people or
of incapacitating them for short or long
periods. The agents, however, cannot
be defined rigidly as either lethal or
incapacitating, since their effects are
dependent upon many factors relating
not only to themselves but also to the
individuals they attack. Any disease-
producing agent intended to incapa¬
citate may, under certain conditions,
bring about a fatal disease.
Bacteriological weapons could be
directed against man's sources of food
through the spread of persistent plant
diseases or of infectious animal
diseases. There is also the possibility
that new epidemic diseases could be
introduced, or old ones reintroduced,
which could result in deaths on the
scale which characterized the med¬
ieval plagues.
All such diseases occur naturally,
and the organisms that cause them,
with few exceptions, are known
to scientists throughout the world.
Different populations have varying
degrees of resistance to the diseases
produced by biological agents. An
infectious disease which might be only
mildly incapacitating in one population
might prove disastrous to another.
For example, when measles was first
introduced into the Hawaiian Islands,
it caused far more deaths than in the
relatively resistant " populations of
Europe.
A biological weapon which might be
intended only to incapacitate could be
highly lethal against a population
where resistance had been lowered as
a result of malnutrition. Conversely,
a weapon which was intended to
spread a lethal disease might only
cause occasional mild illness in people
who had been given a protective
vaccine or who had become immune
as a result of natural infection. The
history of epidemiology is rich with
surprises.
A large number of potential agents
can be directed against human beings.
Among those which might be used are:
Viruses: the smallest forms of life.

BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONRY (Continued from page 17)
The stockpiling of new types of 'secret agents'
20
Most of them can be seen only with
the electron microscope, and must be
grown on living tissue (tissue cultures,
fertile eggs, etc.). Genetic manipula¬
tion of the whole virus or chemical
manipulation of its nucleic acid, might
be used to acquire strains of higher
virulence.
Rickettsiae: intermediate between
the viruses and bacteria. Like the
viruses, they grow only in living tissue.
Bacteria: larger than viruses, they
can be easily grown on a large scale
employing equipment and processes
similar to those used in the fermenta¬
tion industry. Although many disease-
producing bacteria are susceptible to
antibiotic drugs, antibiotic-resistant
strains occur naturally and can be
selected or obtained through the use
of suitable methods of genetic mani¬
pulation. Similarly, it is possible to
select strains with increased resistance
to inactivation by sunlight and drying.
Fungi: these produce a number of
diseases in man, but very few species
appear to have any potential in biologi¬
cal warfare.
Protozoa: one-celled microscopic
organisms which cause several im¬
portant human diseases, including
malaria. Because of their complex
life cycles they too appear to have
little significance in the present context.
Parasitic worms: among them are
hook-worm and the filarial worms
which have very complicated life
cycles. They cause illness and
disability only after long exposure and
repeated infection and would be extre¬
mely difficult to produce in quantity,
to store, to transport or to spread in
a weapon. Insects are also difficult
to conceive of as weapons. Some,
such as the mosquito and the tick,
are transmitters of disease, and as
"vectors" have to be looked upon as
having potential military significance.
Biological anti-animal agents, such
as foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax
would be used primarily to destroy
domestic animals, thereby affecting
man by reducing his food supply.
Outbreaks of contagious disease in
animal populations, known as epi¬
zootics, may spread much more readily
than do epidemics among human
beings. Viral infections are probably
more serious for animals than those
caused by other micro-organisms.
Most of the bacterial diseases of
animals which could probably be used
in warfare are also transmissible to
man. Human beings would be expect¬
ed to get the disease if they were
affected by the attacking aerosol
cloud, and occasional individuals might
contract the disease from infected
animals.
The natural occurrence of devastat¬
ing plant diseases such as the blight
of potatoes in Ireland in 1845, the
coffee rust of the 1870s in Ceylon, the
chestnut blight of 1904 in the United
States of America, and the widespread
outbreaks today of cereal (especially
wheat) rusts has suggested that plant
pathogens might be used for military
purposes.
Large-scale bacteriological attacks
could have a serious impact on the
entire economy of the target country.
Depending on the type of agent used,
the disease might well spread to
neighbouring countries.
Whatever might be done to try to
save human beings, nothing significant
could be done to protect crops, live¬
stock, fodder, and food-stuffs from a
chemical and bacteriological weapons
attack. Persistent chemical agents
could constitute a particular danger to
livestock. Water in open reservoirs
could be polluted as a result of
deliberate attack, or perhaps accident¬
ally, with chemical or bacteriological
weapons. The water supply of large
towns could become unusable, and
rivers, lakes and streams might be
temporarily contaminated.
T.
ODAY a large number of
industrialized countries have the po¬
tential to produce a variety of chemical
agents. Many of the intermediates
required in their manufacture, and in
some cases even the agents them¬
selves, are widely used in peacetime.
Such substances include, for exam¬
ple, phosgene, which is used in the
manufacture of plastics and which
some highly developed countries
produce at the rate of more than
100,000 tons a year; ethylene-oxide,
which is used in the manufacture of
mustard gases, is also produced on a
large scale in various countries for
use in the manufacture of detergents,
disinfectants, etc.; mustard gas and
nitrogen mustard gases can be produc¬
ed from ethylene-oxide by a relatively
simple process. Other industrial pro¬
cesses could similarly be adapted for
the production of biological agents.
The development of sophisticated
and comprehensive weapons systems
for chemical or bacteriological warfare
would require a very costly additional
effort. Nevertheless, the possibility
that a peacetime industry could be
converted to work for military pur¬
poses increases the responsibility of
governments that are concerned about
preventing chemical and biological war
from ever breaking out.
The potential for developing an
armoury of chemical and bacteriolo¬
gical weapons has grown considerably
in recent years, not only in terms of
the number of agents, but also in their
toxicity and in the diversity of their
effects.
But chemical and bacteriological
weapons are not a cheap substitute
for other kinds of weapons. They
represent an additional drain on the
national resources of those countries
by which they are developed, produc¬
ed, and stockpiled. The cost cannot,
of course, be estimated with precision;
this would depend on the potential of
a country's industry.
Because chemical and bacteriolo¬
gical weapons are unpredictable, in
varying degree, either in the scale
or duration of their effects, and
because no certain defence can be
planned against them, their universal
elimination would not detract from any
nation's security.
Once any chemical or bacteriological
weapon had been used in warfare,
there would be a serious risk of
escalation, both in the use of more
dangerous weapons belonging to the
same class and of other weapons of
mass destruction. In short, the
development of a chemical or bacterio¬
logical armoury and a defence, implies
an economic burden without necessar¬
ily imparting any proportionate com¬
pensatory advantage to security. And
it imposes a new and continuing threat
to future international security.
Were these weapons ever to be
used on a large scale in war, no one
could predict how enduring the effects
would be, and how they would affect
the structure of society and the envi¬
ronment in which we live. This
overriding danger would apply as
much to the country that initiated the
use of these weapons as to the one
which had been attacked, regardless
of what protective measures it might
have taken in parallel with its develop¬
ment of an offensive capability.
A particular danger also derives
from the fact that any country could
develop or acquire, in one way or
another, a capability in this type of
warfare, despite the fact that this could
prove costly. The danger of the
proliferation of this class of weapons
applies as much to the developing as
it does to developed countries.
The momentum of the arms race
would clearly decrease if the produc¬
tion of these weapons were effectively
and unconditionally banned. Their
use, which could cause an enormous
loss of human life, has already been
condemned and prohibited by inter¬
national agreements, in particular the
Geneva Protocol of 1925, and, more
recently, in resolutions of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.
The prospects for general and
complete disarmament under effective
international control and hence for
peace throughout the world, would
brighten significantly if the develop¬
ment, production, and stockpiling of
chemical and bacteriological agents
intended for purposes of war were to
end and if they were eliminated from
all military arsenals.
