Unesco was set up immediately after
World War II to contribute to international
peace and security by promoting interna¬
tional co-operation in education, science
and culture. When its Constitution was
adopted in London on 16 November 1945
it bore the signatures of delegates
representing countries from every conti¬
nent. Below left, the cover of the Con¬
stitution, featuring a photo of St Paul's
Cathedral during the Blitz. A Preparatory
Commission was established to draw up a
plan for the future programme of the
Organization. The Constitution came into
force on 4 November 1946 when it had
been accepted by 20 countries. Left, a
meeting, in February 1946, of the Com¬
mission's Sub-Committee on the Educa¬
tional, Scientific and Cultural Needs of
Devastated Areas. Below, the Preamble
to Unesco's Constitution.
The Governments of the States Parties to this
Constitution on behalf of their peoples
declare:
That since wars begin in the minds of men, it
is in the minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed;
That ignorance ofeach other's ways and lives
has been a common cause, throughout the
history of mankind, of that suspicion and
mistrust between the peoples of the world
through which their differences have all too
often broken into war;
That the great and terrible war which has now
ended was a war made possible by the denial
of the democratic principles of the dignity,
equality and mutual respect of men, and by
the propagation, in their place, through ig¬
norance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the
inequality of men and races;
That the wide diffusion of culture, and the
education of humanity for justice and liberty
and peace are indispensable to the dignity of
man and constitute a sacred duty which all the
nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual
assistance and concern;
That a peace based exclusively upon the
political and economic arrangements of
governments would not be a peace which
could secure the unanimous, lasting and
sincere support of the peoples of the world,
and that thepeace must therefore befounded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and
moral solidarity of mankind.
For these reasons, the States Parties to this
Constitution, believing in full and equal op¬
portunities for education for all, in the
unrestricted pursuit of objective truth, and in
thefree exchange of ideas and knowledge, are
agreed and determined to develop and to in¬
crease the means of communications between
their peoples and to employ these means for
the purposes of mutual understanding and a
truer and more perfect knowledge of each
other's lives;
In consequence whereof they do hereby create
the United Natipns Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization for the purpose of
advancing, through the educational and scien¬
tific and cultural relations ofthepeoples ofthe
world, the objectives of international peace
and of the common welfare of mankind for
which the United Nations Organization was
established and which its Charter proclaims.
