The most densely populated
country is the Netherlands with
356 persons per sq.km. (right,

the other end of the scale with

Europe is the most densely

with an average of 64 persons

two persons per sq.km.
"MILLIONAIRE" CITIES
INCREASE FROM 30 TO 8C
IN 20 YEARS
Some 80 of the world's cities now
have one million or more inhabitants.
Only 60 cities of that size existed in
1955 and two decades ago the number
was 30. These figures, given by the
United Nations Demographic Year-
book-1964, are based on population
statistics for the city proper and not
on those for overall urban areas.
MUSHROOM GROWTH
The population of Caracas, capital
of Venezuela, has quintupled in
the past twenty years. Cairo, Afri¬
ca's largest city, now has 3,518,000
inhabitants compared with 2,000,000
in 1947. The population of Bogota,
capital of Colombia (photo right), in¬
creased from 648,000 to 1,680.000
between 1951 and 1964. Brazil's new
capital, Brasilia, had only 12,823 in¬
habitants in 1957; today, it has over
130.000.
rates125 to 179 per 1,000 births-
are reported by Basutoland, Upper
Volta, Haiti, Turkey, Morocco, India,
the United Arab Republic and Indo¬
nesia. In contrast, infant death rates
have decreased in 113 out of
180 countries and territories since
1960. In Sweden the rate has been
reduced to 15 per 1,000 population
and is only slightly higher in the
Netherlands, Norway and Finland.
WOMEN OUTLIVE MEN
In all but four countries Cambodia,
Ceylon, India and Upper Volta
women can expect to live longer than
men. In the U.S.A. baby girls have
a life expectancy of 73 years com¬
pared with 67 for boys. In India,
one of the countries where expec¬
tation of life is lowest, male babies

can expect to live 42 years and female
babies 41.
In some countries a sharp rise is
noted in life expectancy from the
age of one. In El Salvador, for
instance, male children at birth have
an expectation of life of 45 years
which rises to 52 years if they survive
until their first birthday.
For persons 30 years old total life
span expectancy is usually higher
than it is for those born today because
the older persons have already passed
through infancy and early childhood
during which mortality is likely to be
high. In Canada, for example, male
children born today can expect to live
to 68 years of age, whereas men now
aged 30 have on the average another
42 years to live an advantage of four
years over the newborn. Canadian
men who have reached 70 years of
age have on the average another
1 1 years to live.

62 BIRTHS
PER 1,000 POPULATION
The world's highest reported birth
rate is in Mali: 62 per 1,000 population.
Among other countries with high birth
rates are El Salvador (46.8 per 1,000)
and Mexico (45.1). Birth rates in at
least 15 European countries have
followed an upward trend in recent
years.
Infant mortality is high in many
developing countries. In Mali, the
Central African Republic, the Congo
(Brazzaville) and Niger, 200 or more
of every 1,000 babies born alive die
in their first year. High infant mortality

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
The largest number of marriages for
every 1,000 persons in the population
is registered in Europe and the Soviet
Union.
Of some 150 countries and terri¬
tories, more than half report a
downward trend in marriages. The
rates have decreased in virtually all
countries of South America. In Can¬
ada, the U.S.A. and almost half of
trie European countries, however,
marriage rates have increased since
1960. A typical European marriage
rate is found in Italy and Czechoslo¬
vakia (8 annually for every 1,000 per¬
sons). Rates in other parts of the
world range from 9.9 per 1,000 in
Japan and 9 in the U.S.A. to 6.9 in
Chile, 7.4 in Australia and 8 in New
7ealand.
In most European countries there
are between 2 and 10 divorces per
5,000 persons. In the U.S.A. there
are 1 1 divorces yearly for every
5,000 persons. In South America the
rate is about one or two divorces
annually for every 5,000 persons.

HOW MANY CHILDREN
WOULD YOU LIKE?
"How many children would you like
when you get married?" To this ques¬
tion which the Czech youth daily, Mia¬
da Fronta put to readers, the majority
replied that they would like two child¬
ren. Responses to the newspaper's
questionnaire on marriage, which were
analyzed by specialists of the State
Population Commission, showed that
only one boy and one girl in 100 want¬
ed five or more children and only four
young people in 1,000 had decided not
to have children. Inquiries in other
countries among the population as a
whole show that in Austria, the Federal
German Republic and Hungary most
people want two children. In the U.K.,
France, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, the
Netherlands, U.S.A. and Ceylon the
average preference is for three child¬
ren. In Ghana and the Philippines, the
average couple wants five children.

TALES OF MANY CITIES
(Cont'd)
700 MILLION CITY DWELLERS
Nearly one quarter of the world's
population (approximately 720 million
persons) was living in cities with 20,000
inhabitants or more in 1960 a 35%
increase in the urban population
within a single decade.
The trend continues. Urban popu¬
lations are increasing at a greater
rate, especially in the developing
countries, than the overall growth of
world population. In some large
cities the annual growth rate is now
8 per cent. Pakistan estimates that
by 1985 its urban population will have
increased by 25 per cent in East and
40 per cent in West Pakistan. The
cost of urban expansion may absorb
half of Pakistan's development effort
over the next 20 years.
The large scale concentration of
urban populations is a comparatively
new development. Cities with 100,000
inhabitants probably did not exist
before the Greek or Roman period.
In 1800 there were 900 million people
on the globe. Of these, 15,300,000
lived in cities of 100,000 inhabitants
or over, 21,600,000 in cities of 20,000
or over and 27 million in towns
of over 5,000 inhabitants. Between
1800 and 1950 world population
increased over two and a half times.
But the urban population increased
far more rapidly 26-fold in towns
of 5,000 or more inhabitants, and
20-fold in cities of 100,000 or more.
CONTINENTAL INCREASES
Within the overall world population
increase of 1.9 peV cent annually there
is a great disparity between the rates
of increase in developed and deve¬
loping countries. The populations of
Latin America, Africa and Asia mul¬
tiply much more rapidly than those
of Europe and North America.
Populations by region in mid-1964
and their average annual rates of
increase were as follows:
Population % Annual rate
in millions of increase
Latin America 	 237 	 2.8
Africa 	 304 2.5
South Asia 	 943 	 2.4
Oceania 	 17 2.2
East Asia * 	 340 	 1.4
North America 	 211 1 .6
U.S.S.R	 228 	 1.6
