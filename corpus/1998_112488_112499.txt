‘How can the ocean be in trouble? It’s so
h u g e ! ”The speaker, an avid fis h e rm a n ,
had just read an article about pollu-
tion creating a so-called “dead zone”in the nor-
thern Gulf of Mexico, and was sceptical.“I love
the ocean,” he said.“But I can’t imagine that we
can do much to harm a system so large and resi-
lient.The sea seems infinite,timeless!”
My friend’s perception of the ocean has
been a common one—until recently. As the
waters of the world have become increasingly
stressed, an awareness of their importance to
humankind has come into sharp focus.
Fishermen find it increasingly difficult to find
once numerous species—cod, capelin, swordfi-
sh and many more. Phenomena such as the El
Niño have created widespread appreciation of
the role of the ocean in shaping climate and
weather. Water evaporates from the sea’s surfa-
ce and forms clouds that yield fresh water back
to the land—and sea. About 97 per cent of
Earth’s water is marine, and of the remaining 3
per cent, 97 per cent is frozen as polar ice and
snow. Water, of course, is vital for life. There
may be water without life, but nowhere, even in
the most arid deserts and driest valleys in
Antarctica, is there life without water.
The recent discovery of water on Europa,
one of Jupiter’s moons, has aroused much spe-
culation about whether life might be prospe-
ring there, perhaps associated with undersea
volcanic activity, like the communities that
develop around hydrothermal vents in our own
deep sea. Plans are now underway to send spa-
cecraft to Europa that can deploy a robot
capable of boring through three kilometres of
ice before descending into a sea that may be
f o rty kilometres deep. M e a n w h i l e , E a rt h ’s
ocean remains largely unexplored. We have
barely begun to imagine the energy potential of
harnessing the waves, the healing powers of
marine bacteria or the sustainable possibility of
feeding the world’s hungry through algae. A

many forms—from the remains of a shipwreck
to the yearly bands of a coral reef.
But perhaps the most astonishing thing upon
e n t e ring the ocean with a face mask and fli p p e rs
is the discove ry that it is not just a place fil l e d
with rocks and wat e r. It is like a soup, a special
kind of minestrone, where the bits and pieces are
a l i ve! “Living fossils” are eve ry w h e r e . Nearly all
of the thirty-three major divisions of animals
and a dozen broad cat e g o ries of plants and other
organisms that have existed for hundreds of mil-
lions of ye a rs are at least partially represented
t h e r e ; only about half are terr e s t ri a l .
E ve ry living thing on Earth acts on the sur-
rounding env i r o n m e n t , i n i t i ating small but real
c h a n g e s. All are components of the grand machi-
n e ry that makes Earth what it is: a living planet,
our life support system.The immense dive rsity of
life causes change and provides the ingr e d i e n t s
n e c e s s a ry to respond as change occurs.The resi-
lience of natural systems is remarkable, e v i d e n c e d
by the ability to rebound after storm s , fir e s , c o l l i-
sions with comets or natural climatic sw i n g s , a l l
the while retaining a basic framework within
which living things prosper—though not necessa-
rily the same living things.
Human rapacity
Knowing that our lives depend on keeping
Earth more or less as it is in terms of life sup-
port functions, it makes a lot of sense to figure
out whether the swift changes we are presently
witnessing—and causing—may set in motion
e vents with undesirable consequences.
Certainly, no species in the history of the pla-
net has been as rapacious and effective in
consuming and displacing other species and
entire ecosystems as our own. Our impact,
some say, can be likened to that of a slow-
motion comet striking earth, the repercussions
gradually becoming manifest, ri valling and
compounding the impact of storms, volcanoes,

Facts and fig u re s
● 70.8% of the earth’s surface is ocean,or 361.3 million km2 out of a total surface
of 510 million km2. By volume, 97.957% of the water on the planet is oceanic water
and associated sea ice.
● 60% (3.6 billion) of the world’s  population lives within 60 kilometres of the
coast. These figures will rise to 75% (6.4 billion) within three decades.
● 80% of all ocean resources are concentrated on the continental shelf.
● An estimated 80% of the world’s biodiversity lives in the ocean, much of it undis-
c o v e r e d .The largely unexplored deep sea may be home to 10 million species we know
nothing about.
● The latest available figures (for 1992) put global offshore reserves of oil at 36.5
billion tonnes and of gas at 21.4 trillion tonnes.
● An estimated 12.5 million fishermen (10 million of them artisans), operating from
some three million vessels, land around 90 million tonnes of fish per year.The fishing
industry provides a livelihood,directly or indirectly, for about 200 million people.
● The average depth of the world’s oceans is 3,800 metres.The deepest point, in the
Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean,is 11,000 metres beneath the surface.
● The largest ocean, the Pa c i fic , measures over 166 million km2.The highest submarine
mountain,near the Tonga Trench between Samoa and New Zealand,is 8,700 metres
high.
● Average global sea level has probably risen about 18 cm over the past century and
is currently rising at 0.1-0.3 cm per year.
The sea’s mean surface temperature is 160 Centigrade. ■

At night, our cities glow with an otherwo r l d-

of fossil we a l t h . C o m p l e x , n aturally productive
ecosystems are disappeari n g, to be replaced by
g e o m e t rical plots bearing vulnerable single-spe-
cies crops. Other changes are less obvious—the
r e m oval of millions of tonnes of living creat u r e s
from the ocean in the past century, and the
addition of billions of tonnes of trash—excess
f e rt i l i z e rs , pesticides and other noxious sub-
s t a n c e s. Might such actions alter the way nat u-
ral systems behave? Should we wo rry about the
consequences of taking unprecedented quanti-
ties of wildlife from the sea?
Energy ‘middlemen’
We have perfected ways of killing the ocean’s
giants and their diminutive cousins—the nine
species of great whales,more than fifty kinds of
“small” whales, dolphins and porpoises, and all
marine turtles. Many are now endangered or
threatened. Bluefin tuna weighing 450 kilos,
huge halibut, cod as large as the fishermen who
catch them, century-old sturgeon, large sword-
fish, marlin, sailfish, sharks and many other
once common giants are suddenly rare.
Acoustic sensors developed to find enemy sub-
marines now locate fish, squid, shrimp and
other creatures for hunters to engulf with enor-
mous nets, some large enough to swallow a
dozen jumbo jets.
R e c e n t l y, the populations of more than 100
m a rine species listed by the World Conservat i o n
Union as threatened or endangered, s h a rp l y
d e c l i n e d . Large populations of ocean wildlife
are dwindling. The three remaining concentra-
tions of wild creatures in the sea are now being
taken to produce protein concentrat e : p e l a gi c
s q u i d , large swa rms of kri l l , and the deep, ve rt i-
cally migr ating midwater communities of small
c r e atures generally known as the “deep scat t e-
ring laye r.”

are the energy “ m i d d l e m e n ,” c o n c e n t r ating and
c o nve rting plant energy into something palat a b l e
and usable by hordes of other creat u r e s. A n
example of the importance of a single cru s t a c e a n
species is the Antarctic kri l l , Euphausia superba, a
translucent pinkish-red finger-long creat u r e
equipped with enormous black eyes and the
wonderful ability to emit an eerie blue-green ve r-
sion of bioluminescence. The billions of its kind
make up an essential part of the living web that

swa rms are consumed by penguins, t e rn s , g u l l s ,
s e a l s , sea lions, s q u i d , fis h , and several species of
whales whose existence depends on enorm o u s
quantities of them.
So vital is this one species to the entire
Antarctic realm that it would make sense to
ensure that nothing disturbs its continued
prosperity. Instead, several nations annually

before shipping them off for conversion into
high-protein food for poultry, cattle and direct
human consumption.
Besides predat i o n , m a ny other fa c t o rs
undermine the abundance and diversity of
marine life. It is obvious that shoreline deve-
lopment, construction of marinas, seawalls and
j e t t i e s , cutting mangr oves and filling in
marshes, coupled with the impact of rivers bea-
ring heavy loads of excess fertilizers, biocides,
and sediment, have taken a toll.
H ow can we be sure of the impact on ocean
wildlife? Despite the swift and unprecedented
insights into the nature of the sea yielded by tech-
n o l o g y, most of the ocean remains unknown and
u n e x p l o r e d , e ven within the depths that dive rs
can conveniently travel—from the surface to fif t y
metres dow n .The maximum ocean depth, e l e ve n
k i l o m e t r e s , has been attained only once, in 1960,
when two men peered for half an hour through
the small porthole of the bat hyscaphe Tri e s t e.
Recent additional glimpses have been supplied
by cameras lowered on the tethered Ja p a n e s e

cent of the rest of the sea—have yet to be really
seen by humankind.
An uncertain future
It is easy to disregard places we cannot see, n o t
wo rry or care about creatures we have never met.
As troubling as the problems are relating to
obvious habitat destruction and predat i o n , t h e
gr e atest cause for concern must certainly be
i g n o r a n c e . Some shrug and say, “ W h at ’s the pro-
blem? Humankind appears to be doing pretty
we l l . Look at the numbers.” After all, it took all of
the time from the dawn of civilization to the ye a r
1800 before our population barely reached a bil-
l i o n . Less than a century and a half later that
number had doubled, and now, at nearly six bil-
l i o n , world population continues to climb. A n d
yet our own future may be in jeopardy.
There are no easy answe rs to the question of
w h at must be done, but there is hope that a signi-
ficant “ h e d g e ” against the unknowns is coming
into focus with the establishment of a gr ow i n g
number of marine sanctuaries in coastal areas—
places comparable to national parks, w i l d e rn e s s
areas and nature reserves on the land. More than
1,200 marine protected areas have been designa-
ted by va rious nat i o n s. While “ p r o t e c t i o n ” is fa r
from complete (commercial and sport - fis h i n g
continue in most) and the total area is still small
(a fraction of one per cent of the ocean as a
w h o l e ) , the actions taken thus far may reflect the
b e ginning of a new trend that will lead to fin d i n g
