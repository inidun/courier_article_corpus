THE MARBIAl VALLEY.-
An.. under-privileged"area ; home of 28, 000
people.
*W N 1947 the government of Haiti
asked Unesco, then a newly
formed organization, to start a
pilot project in Fundamental
Education in the rural region of Mar-
bial-the central area of the Gosse-
line River Valley in the south of the
island.
The population of Marbial was es-
timated at 28, 000 but no one was
quite sure. No census had ever been
taken of its scattered inhabitants
who lived in shacks perched on the
hillside. Conditions in the valley
provided examples of virtually every-
thing bad in the definition"under-
developed region". It was over-
populated, its illiterate peasants could
scarcely live on the scanty crops they
coaxed from the eroding soil and they
were scourged by such diseases as
malaria and yaws.
Conditions in Marbial were a chal-
lenge, and offered a severe testing
ground for fundamental education
methods.
Unesco agreed to attempt the pro-
ject and in April, 1948 it sent a
survey team to Marbial headed by Dr.
Alfred Metraux, an anthropologist.
Conditions when the team arrived
there were at their worst-an eleven
month drought had drained the last
of the peasants'meagre food reser-
ves. The problem of drinking water
- normally acute-was complicated
by the habits of the people who used
the Gosseline River not only as a
source of water for drinking but
with equal impartiality as a laundry
and a, sewer.
Then, when the drought ended, the
road from Marbial to Jacmel, the
nearest town became a torrent
swirling over boulders. Other han-
dicaps were root d in the minds of
the people of Marbial, who, isolated in
their shacks, were deprived of any
community life and subject to the
tyranny of superstition. But as Dr.
Metraux went ahead with his survey,
the people of the valley began to co-
operate, willing to grasp at anything
that promised to lessen their misery.
Valley Of Despair
THE results of this survey weregraphic epough, yet even statis-
tics cannot tell the full story of
life in Marbial. Fifteen per cent of
Nor do the figures show the effects
of an inheritance system which had
sliced the land into tiny plots so sepa-
rated that a man might waste most
of his working day walking from one
holding to another.
With practically no outside income
the valley was forced to become self-
supporting. In lean years, such as
1948, the result was famine and even
in"good times"mal-nutrition was
chronic. Mal-nutrition to a Marbial
peasant meant that he and his family
lived mainly on beans and millet and
ate meat only once a month.
As the valley's soil had disappeared
- washed away by the rains-so had
most of the possessions of its inha-
bitants. People who once lived in
stone houses were huddled into mud
huts with thatched roofs. Their fur-
niture, crockery and even their clothes
had been sold to make up for poor
harvests. Many of them had to
make work clothes from sugar-bags.
Disease ravaged the valley. In 1948,
at the end of the long drought, Dr.
Metraux reported that scarcely a
household was free of malaria. A
large part of the population was
literally crippled by yaws,. many men
and women being unable to walk
because of great sores on their feet.
Less than 500 pupils were regis-
tered in the three schools serving
the valley's 28, 000 inhabitants, and
only about-half of these actually went
to school, because of sickness and the
fact that many pupils had to walk
two hours each way to attend school.

the valley's land, for example, was
lost to erosion and 70 % was sub-
standard. Such figures, however,
cannot hope to convey the feelings of
hopelessness and despair of the Mar-
bial peasant, vainly trying to squeeze
a few more'measures of grain from
his land and thus inevitably
destroying the soil by failing to fer-
tilize it, to let it lie fallow or to rotate
crops.,
The teachers, Dr. Metraux reported,
had virtually no training, and their
pupils memorized and mechanically
recited passages from fifty year old
French textbooks without any real
understanding of the texts.
Ran let To Education
THERE was a tremendous languagebarrier to education. Although
the official language of Haiti is
French, Marbial's people spoke only
Creole and textbooks in this language
were not available-no one had ever
agreed which of the four methods of
spelling Creole should be adopted.
To attack this aspect of the pro-
blem, Unesco invited Dr. Robert Hall,
an American professor, who had done
research on Creole in the United
States to come to Haiti. Dr. Hall
established an alphabet so that the
preparation of basic textbooks could
go ahead. Although the final ob-
jective was to teach French, the orga-
nisers decided to begin with Creole,
Marbial's mother tongue.
When they heard that something
called"I'Unesco"had come to Marbia !,
the peasants were stimulated into
action. Within a few months their
co-operatives had turned the track to ;
Jacmel into a road, a"Unesco-centre"i
was built in the valley and a commun-
ity-centre, opened nearby, helped the,
people to break out of their isolation. !

The co-operatives dug latrines and
sank a well, and soon peasants living
on the surrounding hillsides followed
their example. Thus a start was
made at cleaning up one of the area's
most dangerous sources of disease.
One of Marbial's three schools re-
ceived a supply of desks, blackboards
and pencils, and trained teachers
went into its classrooms to-give de-
monstration lessons. A literacy cam-
paign was started and spread rapidly.
The Man For The Job
ALL this, however, was only a goodbeginning. Dr, Metraux had
completed his survey mission
but the project was slowed down
while Unesco was looking for a Direc-
tor-the man who would put the
results of the survey to use in eo-ope
ration with the people of the valley.
It was an Englishman, Conrad J.
Opper, who had been Director of
Education in Mauritius, who was
finally chosen. When he arrived at
Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, at the
beginning of 1950, he began to attack
the project's"Housekeeping Prob-
lems".

were partially solved by moving the
project's headquarters from Port-au-
Prince to Marbial.
The new Director and his Haitian
staff soon saw that all progress in
the valley would depend on the
improvement of agriculture. In
February, 1950, Mr. Opper reported :
"There is no possible doubt that a
project in Fundamental Education

based on soil regeneration is unreal-
istic and doomed to failure. To cure

fruitless if we neglect the soil. This
is the one great problem which is a
matter of life and death for the
coming generation of the Valley."

Stn'inH The Soil
THE United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO)
was therefore asked. to join in
the Marbial project. In the mean-
time, however, a Haitian agronomist
set to work to protect Marbial's soil
through land terraces and contour
farming. Several miles of terraces
were constructed under his super-
vision. An order for fifty thousand
sisal plants was placed with a
double objective : the planting of sisal
on newly terraced hillsides would
bulwark the valley's eroding soil and
at the same time the weaving of sisal
mats gave promise of becoming a
local industry. By September, Haitian
manufacturers had already placed an
initial order for 1, 000 mats in
Marbial.
This modest agricultural pro-
gramme was aimed only at preventing
Marbial farm conditions from grow-
ing worse. The FAO intends to
enlarge these activities once it begins
its own programme there.

Another United Nations agency,
the World Health Organization
(WHO), also took an active part in
the project, sending a doctor and a
nurse to the valley. This WHO team
gave 12, 427 treatments, including
3, 493 injections of pencillin procaine
for yaws, during its stay. It also
helped open a new clinic in Mar-
bial, thus giving the valley its first
modern dispensary facilities.
The project's organizers however
pointed out that this first anti-yaws
campaign was only intended to
demonstrate the power of science
over disease. The doctor has now
been replaced by a WHO health
educator and it is up to the people of
Marbial to follow the elementary
rules of health and hygiene they are
being taught.
The project kept the Marbial
children's school in operation and
also opened nine adult schools in the
surrounding region, training local
teachers to take over the classes.
This interest in the schools also
helped to give birth to"Vwa Mab-
ial" (The Voice of Marbial), a two-
page newspaper with a press-run
of 500,
"By The People"
SOURING this perhaps unspecta-cular but steady development,
Mr. Opper and his team kept in
the background as much as possible,
placing the project in the hands of
the people it was intended to help.
This policy proved so successful that
in August the Marbial people formed

Victims of sickness, poverty, malnutrition and'ignorance.
a regional committee of local leaders
with Father Louis Charles, a Haitian
priest, as President, to advise the
Unesco staff.
The formation of such committees
is the key to progress in Fundamental
Education which can only succeed if
it is"by the people, rather than for
the people". Although outside tech-
nical assistance is needed to give
basic skills and knowledge, any
assistance programme which makes
use of bulldozers and blueprints
without attempting to create a
popular understanding and acceptance
of its objectives is bound to die once
the visiting specialists leave.
In Marbial, Unesco is not building
a false prosperity which relies on the
maintenance of an outside mission,
for such prosperity would not last
after the project ended.
What, Unesco has done for Marbial
is more than counter-balanced by
what the Haitians there have done
for the Organization and for other
"under-developed"peoples around the
world, for the project hag"taught
the teachers"many things they need
to know in dealing with similar
problems-and similar problems
affect more than half the earth's
people.
