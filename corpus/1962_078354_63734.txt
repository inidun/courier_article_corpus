Seffar is a typical dried-up and
eroded landscape of the eastern
Sahara. Yet in the caves among these
bare rocks are paintings and rock
engravings testifying that this
was once the seat of ancient
civilizations and fertile lands.

-ODAY withered, fossilized and eroded
the burning desert winds, Tassili n'Aj
in the Sahara (nearly 1,000 miles soi
of Tunis) was a green and fertile pla
5,500 years ago. This has been revealed
innumerable painted and engraved images j
its rocks. Analyses made of fossilized poll
from deep in the ground ha
jiow shown that in this area a Mediterrane
type vegetation grew profusely. It includ
lime trees, alders, hollyoaks, cypresse .
olive trees and cereals of various kinds.
Of all this variety and wealth of flora there
remain today but a hundred cypress trees.

Above, painting of a cow at Iherir dates from 2000
B.C. Left, these cattle engraved on a rock at Terrarat,
seem to be waiting to drink in the wadi when the next
rare rainstorm fills it with water. Opposite page, herd
of cattle, a painting going back to 3500 B.C. Some of
these rock paintings show as many as 1 00 head of cattle.
