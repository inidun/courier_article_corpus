Finding a home for Unesco
D URING 1945, the question
arose of where the proposed
new Organization was to be
situated. A number of countries had ex-
pressed their desire to provide a home for
the Organization, but France, which still
housed the Internationat Institute of In-
tellectual Co-operation (IIIC, see page
6), an offshoot of the former League of
Nations, pressed her daim with particu-
) ar forcefulness.
The French representatives in London
seem to have interpreted a certain rets-
cence about Paris as the location of the
Organization on the part of the British
Government as a desire to see Unesco
situated in London. This, however, was
far from being the case.
In common with many other countries,
Britain was concerned about the French
desire to prolong the life of the IIIC,
which the French believed should pro-
vide the Secretariat for Unesco. Most
other governments were anxious to make
a complete break with the institutions of
the old League of Nations. When this was
accepted by the French Government, the
way was clear for Paris to become the
home of Unesco headquarters. The docu-
ments reproduced below illustrate the
final stages in the process which led to
agrément on Paris as the seat of Unesco.
Extract from a Foreign Office memoran-
dum dated 30 June 1945,
(...) 1 doubt very much whether we shaH
wish to have an organization permanently
on our hands in London, and in these
circumstances it seems to me important
that we should assure the French that
these plans (*) are in no way designed to
rush Allied nations into decisions which
do not take proper account of French
interests (...)

FINDING A HOME FOR UNESCO
Letter fram Léon Blum, chief French de-
legate to the Conference for the Establish-
ment of an Educational and Cultural
Organization (London 1 to 16 November
1945), to Clement Attlee, prime minister
of the United Kingdom,
Claridge's
Brook Street, W. l.
Sunday 4 November
My dear friend,
You will remember that, last Wednes-
day, when ï arrived at Downing Street, 1
had just left our friend Ellen Wilkinson.
You will no doubt also recall that with
regard to a subject close to our hearts in
France-thé location in Paris ofthe future
educational and cultural organization-
she had assured me that we should not
lack British support, unless there should
be opposition on the part of the United
States. 1 spoke about this in the most frank
and open manner with the head of the
American Delegation, Mr. Archibald
MacLeish, and have, in my turn, been
able to assure Ellen Wilkinson that the
opposition in principle that she seemed to
fear does not exist. The American Gov-
ernment has taken no advance décision.
The Delegation has its hands free and, in
Mr. MacLeish's opinion the French re-
quest would be heard sympathetically by
his colleagues.
Please forgive me for keeping you
posted about this matter, apparently
minor, yet in reality rather important.
Your faithful friend,
Léon Blum
Perhaps ï shall be fortunate enough to see
you again for a moment or two before you
leave. ï am taking the liberty of sending
you a copy in French of a book 1 wrote in
one of the first of my prisons, the English
translation of which is now being com-
pleted by William Pickles.
Confidential telegram sent on 10 Novem-
ber 1945 by the British Foreign Office in-
forming the French authorities that their
offer to pro vide Unesco with a seat in Paris
had been accepted.
Reply fram Mr, Attlee to M, Léon Blum,
10, Downing Street,
Whitehall.
7th November, 1945
My dear friend,
Thank you for your letter of Novem-
ber 4th. As you know, the British attitude
to the question of the siting of the Educa-
tional and Cultural Organization is at pre-
sent under consideration ; and 1 hope my
colleagues will be able to let you know our
views shortly.
Thank you also for sending me a copy
of your book"A l'Echelle Humaine". 1
shall always value it and the friendly in-
scription which you have written in it.
It was a great pleasure to meet you
again after a) i thèse years.
Yours ever,
C. R. Attlee

Script of a radio broadcast early in 1946
du ring which Léon Blum presented ta the
French people the new organization which
had just been created in London. As head
of the French delegation ta the Conference
which established Unesco, Léon Blum had
successfully argued that the seat of
Unesco should be in Paris.
ion 1936 the French writer and socialist
leader Léon Blum (1872-1950) became pre-
mier of the first Popular Front go vemmen
supported by a coalition of parties of the
loft which broke up in 1938, the year in
which this photo was taken, A supporter of
a firm policy against Hitler, Léon Blum was
arrested in September 1940 and while in
prison wrote a book, A l'Echelle Humaine
(For Ali Mankind), in which he expounded
his humanist conception of socialise and
urged his party to resist. Deporfed'fo
Dachau and then Buchenwald in 1943, he
was liberated in 1945, ln 1946 he formed an
all-socialist government which brought in
the institutions of the Fourth Republic,

U-NES-CO
Do not forget these three exotic-sounding
syllabes.
L-NES-CO-perhaps you have already
heard them somewhere. You will certain-
ty hear them repeated often in the future.
These three exotic-sounding syllables are,
as you have already guessed, made up of
the initiais of a rather long name.
The United Nations Educational, Scien-
tific and Cultural Organization,
Unesco is one of the sections, one of the
departments of the International Com-
munity, founded by the United Nations in
the midst of war, at Dumbarton Oaks and
at San Francisco.
What is of particular interest to aIl
citizens of France is the tocation and the
purpose of Unesco.
ifs headquarters ?
During the Conference for the estab-
lishment of Unesco which was held in
London at the end of last year, the French
Delegation managed to ensure that its
headquarters woutd be s'ted ir paris. khis
decision did not make a great impact at
the time, and 1 regret this because it was
an important décision. The representa-
tives of over 40 nations, gathered together
from every continent, agreed in the opin-
ion that the Paris of the Liberation re-
mained the natura ! centre ofinternationat
culture and spirituality. The Preparatory
Commission is still in London, but the
installation of Unesco in Paris will begin
next autumn. The Hotel Majestic, made
available by the Government of the Re-
public, will be Unesco's provisional head-
quarters.
lis purpose
The London Conference defined Un-
esco's purpose at the highest spiritual
plane. The United Nations, determined to
create and organize a peacefu ! wortd, are
aware that the foundations of Peace are as
much psychica), sentimental, and spir-
itual, as poiitica !, économie and social.
The spirit of Peace is one of the conditions,
one of the eiements of Peace. thé spirit of
Pence pre-supposes mutual knowledge
and understanding between peoples ; it
implies the co-operation and solidarity of
ail States in the wide fields of éducation,
ScientijÏc knowledge, and General culture
