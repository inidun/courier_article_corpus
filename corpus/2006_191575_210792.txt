                                     from schools to universities, the education system in iraq 
                             is suffering because students and professors alike fear for their safety.
Iraq
when school isn’t a safe place anymore
y friend Tariq first alerts me to 
the problem. His niece, he says, 
is angry because her parents 
want her to change her school to 
somewhere closer to their home. 
The journey, they fear, is too far 
in these dangerous times when 
teenage girls face the risk of kid-
napping, when militias roam the 
streets imposing their own laws 
and when the bombers are at-
tacking even ‘safe’ areas. He 
mentions, almost as an aside, that 
the schools are emptying of both 
pupils and teachers. 
In the way of these things, the 
conversation widens. My transla-
tor tells a similar story as does 
one of my guards. It is not just the 
schools it turns out. Throughout 
Iraq, the entire educational system 
is being hollowed out by violence. 
Professors and students say they 
no longer feel safe in their universi-
ties, that they are confronted with 
murder and intimidation. It has 
become so bad that in the worst-
affected areas, up to half the staff 
and students have left. 
As the new academic term gets 
underway, it is becoming apparent 
that education in Iraq is facing an 
unprecedented crisis.
A bleak picture
Universities from Basra in the south 
to Kirkuk and Mosul in the north 
have been infiltrated by militia or-
ganisations. “Militias from all sides 
are in the universities,” says a po-
litical science lecturer at Baghdad 
University. “Classes are not hap-
pening because of the chaos, and 
colleagues are fleeing if they can.” 
“The situation is becoming com-
pletely unbearable’” he continues. 
Life continues on Hafia Street, Baghdad.

“A large number have simply left 
the country, while others have 
applied to go on prolonged sick 
leave. We are using MA and PhD 
students to fill in the gaps.” 
“What has been happening with 
the murders of professors involved 
in the sciences is that a lot of those 
involved in medicine, biology, 
maths have fled,” says another 
professor who teaches politics in 
Baghdad. “The people who have 
got the money are sending their 
children abroad to study. A lot - my 
daughter is one of them - are de-
ciding to finish their higher educa-
tion in Egypt.” 
The same militias regularly in-
timidate female students and pro-
fessors. Almost two years ago, 
a group of women professors at 
Basra University complained to 
me of being intimidated by groups 

of young men allied to the militias, 
who had bullied and threatened 
students not wearing the veil, and 
intimidated those they thought 
were taking unsuitable classes. 
Since then, this phenomenon has 
spread throughout the country.
No place is safe
But it is the security situation—and 
not just in Banghdad—that is having 
the biggest impact on education. In 
Mosul, too, professors complain of 
a system now approaching utter 
disarray. 
Mohammed U, a 60-year-old 
science professor, spoke after 
returning from the funeral of a 
colleague, the head of the law fac-
ulty, who died in an explosion. 
“Education here is a complete 
shambles. Professors are leav-
ing, and the situation - the closed 
roads and bridges - means that 
both students and teachers find it 
difficult to get in for classes,” Mo-
hammed says. “Students are really 
struggling. To get them through at 
all, we have had to lower academ-
ic levels. We have to go easy on 
them. The whole system is becom-
ing rapidly degraded.” 
The situation is reflected in many 
of Iraq’s schools. “Education in my 

area is collapsing,” said a teacher 
from a high school in Amariya, 
who quit four months ago just be-
fore two of her colleagues were 
murdered. “Children can’t get to 
school because of road blocks. 
The parents of others have simply 
withdrawn them from the school 
because of the fear of kidnapping.” 
“If children have to travel by car, 
they are less likely to come,” she 
says. “When I left, we had 50% 
attendance. We see parents 
when they come in to ask for the 
children to have a ‘vacation’, and 
they admit they are too scared to 
let them attend.” 
The situation is hardest of all on 
young Iraqis, most of whom are 
desperate for an education. One 
high school student from Zafara-
niya that I spoke to had hoped to 
go to university this year. But her 
college is in Adhamiya, a neigh-
bourhood notorious for violence, 
so she has been forced to ask 
for a deferral. “The journey is too 
long and too unsafe. I don’t know 
whether I will be going to college 
or stay jailed at home.”

Recently, Iraq’s government has 
been making efforts to rehabilitate 
and reform the three main pillars 
of education--students, teachers 
and curricula. 
The government has announced 
that it will increase the total 
education budget by 600% 
in order to implement more 
projects that serve the sector. 
For example, international trainers 
have been running workshops for 
teachers, and a country-wide 
curriculum review process is 
currently underway in preparation 
for a curriculum reform. 
In addition, the government has 
raised teachers’ salaries by up to 
200 thousand Iraqi Dinars (about 
$135) per month and added 
monthly incentives that range 
between 30 - 50 thousand Iraqi 
Dinars (about $20-35). The Minis-
try of Education is also providing 
teachers with parcels of land as 
well as loans for the purchase 
of private vehicles that may be 
paid back over a period of three 
years. UNESCO and other 
international organizations have 
also played a role in implement-
ing emergency and humanitarian 
programmes that provide Iraqi 
students with decent facilities, 
textbooks and educational 
opportunities.

iraq’s education system was once among the best 
in the Arab world, with compulsory and free elementary 
education, high enrolment rates, and one of the highest literacy 
rates in the region. unfortunately, the education system 
suffered over the past few decades due to wars 
and economic sanctions.
