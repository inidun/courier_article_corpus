THE SURVIVAL
OF PHILAE
by Louis A. Christophe
"IHE Death of Philae," by the
French author, Pierre Loti, created a
sensation when it was published just
sixty years ago. Yet the noble monu¬
ments on this island in the Nile have
thus far escaped the death which Pierre
Loti predicted for them, although the
Aswan Dam downstream has 'been
raised on two occasions.
Moreover, the leprosy of salt de¬
posits which was eroding the löwer
foundations of the structures has long
since disappeared, washed away by
the waters which submerged the monu¬
ments after 1934, during nine months
LOUIS A. CHRISTOPHE, French Egyptologist,
is head of Unesco's Section of Nubia Monu¬
ments, and from 1960 to 1967 was Special
Representative of Unesco in Cairo for the
International Campaign to Save the Monu¬
ments of Nubia. He has written many stud¬
ies on Egyptology and is the author of a
fascinating book on the discovery of Abu
Simbel by the Swiss explorer Johann Burck-
hardt, entitled "Abou Simbel el l'Epopée de
sa Découverte" (Editions P F. Merckx, Brus-
sels, 1965).
of the year (see the "Unesco Courier,"
February 1960). And archaeologists,
artists and travellers who, until 1964,
braved the rigours of the Nubian sum¬
mer to land on Philae during the brief
period when it emerged from .the
waters, were stirred by the same emo¬
tions felt by their predecessors of the
19th century.
The harmonious ensemble of monu¬
ments whose massive forms of tradi¬
tional Pharaonic' architecture blend
with the elegance and grace of Grecian-
style colonnades, the diversity of
reliefs which transform the temples
into a colossal "library" on the reli¬
gion of ancient Egypt and particular-
_ ly the cult of the goddess Isis and
the sandstone blocks whose colour
changes with every shift and play of
the desert light, all helped to make
the visitor forget the losses that Philae
had suffered in modern times.
Few remembered that until the turn
of the century the inner walls of. the
sanctuaries were adorned with splen¬
did paintings, and that on the "Pearl
of Egypt," as Philae was known in
ancient times, long palm fronds rip¬
pled in the northern breeze, clumps
of tamarisk trees were filled with the
songs of birds, and swallows, beloved
by Isis, returned unfailingly each year
to their immemorial haunts.
But the annual spectacle of Philae
risen from the waters was seen by a
privileged few for whom neither the
overpowering heat of Aswan in August,
nor the slippery mud in July, neither
the deep and dangerous cracks in the
earth in September nor the awe-inspir¬
ing solitude of the abandoned island
were daunting obstacles. Far more
numerous were the visitors who came
in more clement months, when the
approaches to the First Cataract of the
Nile unexpectedly recall the vistas of
some mythical paradise.
To dream of Philae, the enchant¬
ress, and then to discover only the
mutilated reliefs on its monumental
pylons, or to search, often in vain, for

THE SURVIVAL OF PHILAE (Continued)
traces of the submerged colonnades
in the calm but cloudy waters is enough
to make one regret that the builders
of the Aswan Dam, and those who
twice increased its height, failed to
give the archaeologists of the Egyptian
Antiquities Service the opportunity to
rescue the island and its monuments.
A plan to save them had indeed been
drawn up, but could not be undertaken
through lack of national resources.
Then, in 1960, a great hope was
born. Specialists sent to Nubia by
Unesco in the autumn of 1959 to study
the problems of safeguarding its sites
and monuments, supported by a vast
wave of international solidarity, in¬
corporated the preservation of Philae's
monuments into the overall plan for
the Nubian campaign. And when the
Director-General of Unesco made his
solemn appeal on March 8, 1960, it
was Philae he had in mind, second
only to Abu Simbel, as a majestic en¬
semble to be saved by the Interna¬
tional Campaign he had just launched.
s,
52
UNCE the island of Philae
is located between the old and new
Aswan Dams, there was no need to
put a rescue operation into effect for
several years, which gave time to pre¬
pare the project (see the "Unesco
Courier," October 1961). A target date
was set for 1968, by which time it was
estimated that the High Dam would be
nearing completion and its turbines,
built to provide electricity for the in¬
dustrial development of the United
Arab Republic, would be in service.
These years of respite were use¬
fully devoted to the launching and
completion of a major operation in
Nubia the removal to safety of the
temples of Abu Simbel (see pages 52-
53) and to the study of projects for
the preservation of Philae.
In 1955, when plans were being
drawn up for the construction of the
High Dam, the Egyptian Antiquities
Department published a study entitled
"The Salvage of Philae." Its author,
Osman R. Rostem, proposed to isolate
Philae from the rest of the Aswan Lake
by a series of small dams or dikes.
This idea, put forward at a time when
the High Dam was still a theoretical
project, seemed perfectly feasible to
the Unesco specialists as an opera¬
tion that could be carried out in the
more or less distant future, since the
flooding of the High Dam would reduce
the water level at Philae in comparison
both with the former level of the Aswan
Lake and the waters of the High Dam.
Therefore a more elaborate study
of the Rostem proposal, commissioned
by the Government of the Netherlands,
was carried out by NEDECO, a Nether¬
lands firm of consulting engineers.
This proposed the construction of three
dikes between the right bank of the
Nile and the islands close to Philae,
thus creating a new lake in whose
centre the monuments of Philae would
stand in their original setting and
splendour. The level of this lake was
to be controlled by a pumping station.
But further studies showed that this
would be too costly, and an alternative
solution to carry away surplus water
via a drainage tunnel was proposed.
Though endorsed by the majority of
archaeologists and landscape archi¬
tects, since it preserved the monu¬
ments of Philae on their original site,
the Rostem-NEDECO project had cer¬
tain drawbacks. Some problems, such
as water seepage, could be solved;
other were likely to prove more diffi¬
cult. For example, might not the monu¬
ments in their hollow be isolated from
the wild landscape of the First Catar¬
act of the Nile by the high rectilinear
walls of the three dams? But the
main obstacle that remained was the
steadily rising cost of a project of
this type.
By 1965 the threat to Philae was
greater than ever before. It had been
decided that the hydro-electric power
station near the old Aswan Dam would
be used to supplement the turbines of
the High Dam. Thus, the water in the
lake between the two dams would
have to be kept at a sufficiently high
level and also raised and lowered by
from plus to minus three metres daily.
By now the foundations of the monu¬
ments were submerged throughout
the year, while some ten metres above
them the daily rise and fall of the
waters first submerged the sandstone
reliefs and then exposed them to the
open air, thus weakening their resis¬
tance to corrosion by the atmosphere.
IHE rescue of the monu¬
ments on Philae was thus becoming
more and more urgent and called for a
rapid decision. From new studies by a
group of consulting architects and en¬
gineers in Cairo came a second pro¬
ject, designed to take account of ar¬
chaeological requirements and finan¬
cial resources.
The new project proposed dis¬
mantling the monuments of Philae,
stone by stone, a method already used
to save most of the other threatened
monuments in Nubia, notably the
temple of Kalabsha, and reconstructing
them on the island of Agilkia, 300
metres downstream from Philae.
The operation would be carried out
as follows. First, the level of the
water around the temples would be
lowered to ground level long enough
to permit measurements and recordings
to be made, so that the monuments
could be reconstructed in their proper
symbolic orientation, each in correct
relation to the others and with every
architectural feature replaced exactly
as before.
To lower the water level around
the monuments for a long period would
obviously be impossible for economic
reasons. It would thus be necessary

THE FATE OF PHILAE
IN THE 20TH CENTURY
Before 1902
Taken just before the turn
of the century, this photograph shows
the site of the temples of Philae
high and dry above the First Cataract
of the Nile. The building of the
first Aswan Dam (1899-1902) created a
lake which flooded the island for
part of the year. The dam was later
raised on two occasions, between 1907
and 1912 (after which it was necessary
to tour the monuments by boat),
and again between 1929 and 1934,
when it inundated the temples for
nine months of the year.
The monuments suffered the irreparable
loss of their many-coloured frescos
which had survived intact for 2,000 years
down to the 19th century.
Before 1965
For thirty years (1934-1964),
Philae and its temples were engulfed
by the Nile from October to July.
Only the tips of the first pylon
of the Great Temple of Isis
were visible above the waters (right).
In July, after the opening of the sluices
of the first Aswan Dam,
the temples emerged in their entirety,
a magnificent spectacle (far right)
for those who braved the midsummer heat
During these three decades,
the water dangerously attacked and
weakened the sandstone, but the
monuments survived because their
foundations had been .consolidated
in 1900 by the Egyptian
Antiquities Service.
Today
The construction of the new
Aswan High Dam, upstream .from Philae,
will doom the "Pearl of Egypt"
to certain death unless efforts
are made to save it
The rise in the water level of the
Aswan Lake since 1965 now floods
the sanctuary of the goddess Isis
to about half its height, and the
foundations of Philae's monuments are
gradually being eroded by daily
fluctuations of up to six metres (19 ft.)
in the water level. Right, Philae in 1968.
It is now proposed to save Philae
by dismantling its temples
and re-erecting them on the island
of Agilkia, beyond the reach of the Nile.

Hathor, one of the great deities of ancient Egypt, is portrayed here
with the ears of a cow, which reflects her mythological role as sustainer
of life and mother of the world. This ¡mage of the goddess
is carved on the capital of each column on the "birth house"
of Horus, on the island of Philae.

THE SURVIVAL OF PHILAE
(Continued)
Drawing shows the course of the Nile between the old Aswan Dam (left)

to build a coffer-dam around the prin¬
ciple monuments which could then be
safely dismantled. Other monuments,
of which only the lower foundations
remain, could be recovered by simpler
and less costly techniques.
While the blocks of stone (estimat¬
ed at between, 15,000 and 20,000) were
being moved to a storage area in the
plain of Chellal on the right bank of
the Nile, a new site for the monuments
would be prepared on the island of
Agilkia.
Far higher than Philae, Agilkia has
peak levels of 150 metres and thus
rises well above the level of the Aswan
lake. But to accommodate all the
temples in an area equivalent to their
former site, its pinkish granite surface
would need to be levelled and parts
of the island extended in width and
length by the addition of terraces

built up of rockfill covered with sand.
The final phase would be the re¬
construction of the temples, kiosks and
pylons on Agilkia, a task facilitated
by experience gained during similar
operations on several Nubian sites,
such as Kalabsha, Kertassi, Dakka and
Amada. The monuments would once
again stand in their respective places,
each facing in its original direction: the
temple of Isis looking south; the kiosk
of Trajan greeting visitors arriving from
the east bank of the Nile; the kiosk
of Nectanebo, those landing on the
southern shore of the island; and the
gate of Hadrian opening on the west.
But through its portals the vestiges
of the temple of Osiris will no longer
be visible. The temple will be left on
the island of Biga, a prey to the rise
and fall of the waters in the Aswan
lake.
The Government of the United Arab
Republic finally chose the project to
dismantle, transfer and reassemble the
monuments of Philae, in preference
to the Rostem-NEDECO project, for
financial reasons. The cost of trans¬
ferring the monuments is estimat¬
ed at 5,350,000 Egyptian pounds
($12,305,000) as compared to an
estimated cost of 6,450,000 Egyptian
pounds ($14,825,000) for preserving
them on their original site. Further¬
more, the proportion of hard currency
needed for the transfer project is only
40 per cent of the total as against
60 per cent for the project to build
dikes around the temples.
Work is scheduled to start in the
spring of 1969 and will take four years
to complete Early in 1973, the monu¬
ments of Philae, unchanged in every
respect, will have become the monu¬
ments of the "new" island of Agilkia.
Philae, engulfed by the Nile, will have
been irrevocably deprived of its crown
of buildings, and a shroud of river silt
will soon hide the wounds inflicted
by the tools of modern technology.
In compensation, the once desolate
island of Agilkia will have been garbed
in an array of sculptured stone and
its barren surface covered by kiosks,
colonnades, pylons and sanctuaries to
which the swallows of Isis will return
once more.
Tamarisk trees and palms may flour¬
ish again and beneath their shade,
throughout the year, visitors will try
to visualize the splendours of the festi¬
val in Greco-Roman Egypt, when the
shrine of the goddess, followed by a
cortege of her priests, musicians and
dancers, and acclaimed by the host
.of pilgrims, completed its journey on
the Nile and was restored, until the
next year's flood, to its chosen sanc¬
tuary.
