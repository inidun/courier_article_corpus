While the planet is heing sti¬
fled by atmospheric pollution
from the gases given off hy fossil
fuels such as oil 64 million hands
of which are consumed every day
and coal, alternative sources of
"renewable energy are there
for the using. But looking around
the world, even those places where
sources such as water, sun, wind,
plant residues or volcanoes are plen¬
tifully available, we see how little
use is actually being made of them.
The reason lies both in the cost of
the necessary capital goods, which
remains high because they cannot
be mass-produced, and in the lack of
information and training.
UNESCO recognized that renew¬
able energies are one of the keys to
sustainable development as long ago
as the 1950s, when they were still
seen as a bee in the bonnet of woolly-
minded conservationists. A number
of factors growing environmental
awareness, the realization of the
impact of the greenhouse effect on
world climate, the catastrophic acci¬
dents that have occurred in the very
nuclear plants that promised clean
power, and the progress made con
currently in the technology of renew¬
able energy use have, however,
drawn increasing attention to the
potential they represent.
Rocketing oil prices in the early
1970s reinforced this interest still
further, but when prices fell, fifteen
years later or thereabouts, interest
again waned and research pro¬
grammes went on lo the back burner.
Today's very low oil prices ($16 a
barrel) are no inducement to econ¬
omy, nor do they encourage invest¬
ment in new energy technologies,
especially since they are mainly
intended for the developing coun¬
tries, which are either insolvent or
getting on that way. They are, fur¬
thermore, complicated to put into
operation, requiring an interdisci¬
plinary approach, which is why
UNESCO's Engineering and Technol¬
ogy Division co-operates with other
institutions of the United Nations
system, with many non-governmen¬
tal organizations and with bilateral
and multilateral aid agencies.
AN URGENT NEED
In 1993, Unesco hosted the World
Solar Summit, at which, for the first
time, the international community
examined the problem of renewable
energy sources. As explained by Elie
Absi, a member of the secretariat
of the World Solar Commission
which was set up in 1993, the
generic term "solar" is used because
all sources of energy, with the excep¬
tion of nuclear and geothermal
energy, are linked with the sun. The
choice of the most suitable of these
energy sources depends on local cir¬
cumstances, available resources and
level of consumption.
Demographic pressure is making
the use of renewables a matter of
even greater urgency. The planet's
population is now increasing at the
rate of nearly 250,000 a day. Agri¬
culture is incapable of feeding the
developing countries' four-and-a-half
billion rural inhabitants (700 mil¬
lion households) scattered about the
relatively isolated regions of Africa,
Latin America, India and China.
To keep these people on the land
and restrict migration both from
countryside to towns and from one
country to another, it is essential lo
launch cost-effective craft, indus¬
trial or agro-food activities, on
however modest a scale, and this
cannot be achieved without energy
supplies.
Output of electricity by conven¬
tional means has increased by leaps
and hounds over the last thirty years
but the main consumers have been
city-dwellers. The World Bank
spends $3.3 billion a year in the
energy sector but only 7% of this
goes lo renewable energy in the
developing countries. Out of the
total of $8 billion similarly provided
by multilateral aid agencies, only
$1.5 billion is spent on rural elec¬
trification. Electricity supplies to
the rural population are no better
than thirty years ago. The reason is
that maintenance and repairs are

difficult, connection to the mains
supply is costly, human settlements
are widely scattered, access to iso¬
lated areas is difficult and con¬
sumption is often low (less than one
kWh a day).
BIOGAS, GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
AND WIND POWER
A few examples will suffice to show
what can be done with renewable
energy sources. In Guatemala, for
instance, there is an ongoing short¬
age of oil and gas, and only 36% of
the. population, mainly in the towns,
are connected to the electricity sup¬
ply. This being the case, the main
source of energy is firewood, leading
to 900 sq.km. of woodland being
deforested yearly far exceeding the
forest's regeneration capacity. The
national agency responsible for the
management of renewable energy, set
up in 1983, employs locally-based
technicians throughout the country.
With the assistance of an anthropol¬
ogist who helps persuade the local
inhabitants to accept the new tech¬
nologies, these technicians have the
job of promoting and monitoring the
use of solar installations (biodigesters
and photovoltaic systems).
A geothermal unit and two small-
scale hydroelectric power stations
are planned. Backed by $2 million
from the United Nations Industrial
Wind turbines in
the Mojave desert,
California (U.S.A.)
Development Organization (UNI DO),
a three-year (1996-1999) plan will
provide dispensaries, schools and
food shops with photovoltaic instal¬
lations. In the village of Xetzé, for
example, where one of these systems
has been installed, electric light now
enables the womenfolk lo carry on
with their weaving in the evenings
and, as their output of cloth has
thus been put on a more regular
basis, they have been able to set up
long-term deals with foreign buyers.
Biogas is one of the cheapest
sources of renewable energy,
obtained by fermenting animal or
vegetable waste products in a special
container, the hiodigester. Rich in
methane and carbon dioxide, it is
used for lighting, cooking and other
purposes (see "A waste-free farm",
Um<;sc,() Courier, September 1997).
Geothermal energy makes use of
underground heat, which increases
with depth (a drill can go down to a
maximum of 5,000 metres), allow¬
ing a turbine to be driven by water or
steam and produce electricity.
Another technique consists in inject¬
ing water into fissures in rock, and
retrieving it when it has been natu¬
rally heated. Heating for 85% of
the population in Iceland comes
from geothermal sources. A score of
countries, mostly developing, use
geothermal energy, and there are
250 geothermal power stations in
operation in various parts of the
world, but cost restricts their fur¬
ther development.
Wind power is the most promising
of all the renewable energies and the
one that has undergone the most spec¬
tacular development. Germany, India
and Denmark are the three countries
best equipped in this respect. Spain,
which comes fourth, is the first coun¬
try in the European Union to enact
legislation incorporating the recom¬
mendations made in the European
Commission's While Paper on renew¬
able energy sources; wind generators
are in wide use in the Canaries, for
sea-water desalination among other
purposes. Over a hundred wind pumps
are already operating in Mauritania,
where a non-governmental organiza¬
tion, the Groupement de recherches
et d'échanges technologiques (Tech¬
nological Research and Exchanges
Group), working in partnership with
iheMauritanianencrgy authority, has
installed wind-powered battery-charg¬
ing stations in fifteen villages in the
Tzarza region, a south-eastern area
where there is plenty of wind. These
batteries supply electricity to bouses
or nomads' tents. A $5-a-month sub¬
scription buys the use of an individual
battery that can be recharged when
Hat by the wind generator. Wind gen¬
erators power pumps supplying vil¬
lages with drinking water in the
remotest regions of the Adrar.
THE WORLD SOLAR
PROGRAMME
The sun is an immense renewable
energy source equivalent to about
10,000 times the total world
demand for power. It is ever-pre¬
sent albeit varying in intensity
throughout the world. It can be har¬
nessed directly, in the form of heat,
or converted into electricity. In the
former case, all that is needed in the
developing countries is a black-
backed sheet of glass or plastic to
make a cheap drying rack for fruit,
vegetables or fish. The latter
method the photovoltaic system
requires panels, a battery and a
device for con verting direct current
to alternating hut also needs an oper¬
ator who has to be trained to use
and maintain it.

"Solar technology", explains
Erench researcher Michel Rodot,
"represents a major potential, but
development runs up against real
financial problems, firstly because
installation costs are fairly high but
mainly because village people and
rural extension workers need to be
committed to the idea of solar
power. It also requires political will
on the part of the State and support
from the banks. Consumers will have
to learn that the supply of solar elec¬
tricity is a service they must pay for,
however modest the price."
Conscious of the part renewable
energies can play, UNESCO has
devised a ten-year (1996-2005)
World Solar Programme, which aims
"to develop and implement 300-odd
top-priority renewable energy pro¬
jects of national, regional and inter
national value ... in order to demon¬
strate the technical feasibility, eco¬
nomic viability and social and polit¬
ical acceptability of solar energy."
The Organization is also offering an
extremely well-stocked database,
available both in printed form and on
computer, and a summer school for
French-speaking engineers, instruc-
tors, academics, researchers and
economists. I
