The urban e x p l o s i o n
The increasing number of mega-cities of more
than eight million inhabitants illustrates in
itself the major demographic and geogr a p h i c a l
trends of the past century. In 1950, only two cities,
London and New Yo r k , were that size. In 1900 they
were the world’s most populous cities,followed by
Pa ri s. In 1975, there were 11 mega-cities, i n c l u d i n g
six in the industrialized countries. In 1995, there
were 23, most of them (17) in the developing coun-
t ri e s. In 2015, the projected number of mega-cities
is 36, 30 of them in the developing world and most
(22) in Asia.
U r b a n i z ation is taking place at different speeds
on different continents. In North A m e ri c a , t h e
number of city-dwellers overtook the rural popu-
l ation before the Second World Wa r. In Europe,
this happened after the war and in Latin A m e rica at
the beginning of the 1960s.To d ay, these three conti-
nents are almost equally urbanized (75% of Euro-
peans and Latin Americans are city-dwellers and
77% of North Americans, according to UN esti-
mates for the year 2000).
A similar process is occurring in A f rica and
A s i a , which are still mainly ru r a l .Their proport i o n
of city-dwellers rose from 25% in 1975,to 35% in
1995 and a little more than 37% today.The turn i n g
p o i n t , when the figure will top 50%, is predicted for
around 2025.
In terms of numbers, the world’s city-dwellers
in 2025 should total 307 million in North A m e ri c a ,
566 million in Latin A m e ri c a ,572 million in Europe,
752 million in A f rica and 2,507 million (2.5 billion)
in Asia. In 2015, the world’s six biggest cities are
expected to be Tokyo, Bombay, Lagos, São Paulo,
Dhaka and Karachi.
E x p e rts say the rate of population gr owth will
e ventually decline eve ry w h e r e , but once again at
ve ry different speeds. B e t ween 2005 and 2010,
annual population gr owth rates are predicted to be
3.82% in A f ri c a , 2.59% in A s i a , 1.68% in Lat i n
A m e ri c a , 1.06% in North A m e rica and 0.24% in
