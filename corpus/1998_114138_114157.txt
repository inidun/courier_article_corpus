If you have a friend in Sydney,
Jo h a n n e s burg or Beijing and you have n ’t
spoken to them for a while, you will soon
h ave to think of a better excuse than “it costs
too much”. P rices of intern ational telephone
calls are plummeting. Before long, making a
call to the other side of the planet will cost as
much as it currently costs to call yo u r
n e i g h b o u r.
We are moving towards a distanceless,
borderless world where you will be able to
call anyo n e , almost anywhere for a few cents
or pennies. “The death of distance as a
d e t e rminant of the cost of communicat i n g
will probably be the single most import a n t
force shaping society in the first half of the
next century,” argues The Economist
m a g a z i n e .
There is a problem, t h o u g h . Amidst the
excitement and glamour generated by the
prospects of cheap calls, mobile phones and
the Intern e t , a quiet, poorly understood bu t
increasingly desperate struggle is being wa g e d
by some countries to adapt to the new
r e a l i t i e s.The process of change threatens to
c ripple the economies of these countri e s ,
mainly the poorest on the planet. T h e i r
problem is made wo rse by the fact that this
issue is mired in the tedious technicalities of
h ow telephone calls are charged and
accounted for.
When poverty
pays dividends
One reason why intern ational calls have
been so expensive is that many countri e s
h ave traditionally charged high prices for
completing the calls. Make a call from
Washington to Ja m a i c a , for example, a n d
the A m e rican telephone company has to
pay the telephone company in Jamaica to
connect the call,and that cost is passed on
to the person making the call.The system
which defines how much each company
pays each other company is known as the
international accounting rate system. It is
the result of bilateral agreements which
determine the price of the connexion and
the amount (usually 50 per cent of this
p rice) that a telephone company in country
X pays to its opposite number in country Y
for connecting the call (the settlement rat e ) .
In an ideal wo r l d , e ve ry country wo u l d
o ri gi n ate as many telephone calls as it
r e c e i ve s. H owe ve r , we live in an unequal
world and because most of their citizens are
poorer and have less developed telephone
s y s t e m s , nearly all developing countri e s
r e c e i ve more calls than they ori gi n at e .
Perhaps uniquely, in this instance pove rt y
p ay s. Most developing countries receive
much more money from intern at i o n a l
t e l ephone traffic than they pay out.

under the accounting rate system.”
M a ny developing countries have used the
system to charge high prices for completing
calls, arguing that they need the foreign
exchange to develop their own domestic
telephone systems.But now a combination of
technology, power politics and the harsh
competitive disciplines ushered in by the
global liberalized telecommunications
market place is likely to lead to a sudden and
potentially catastrophic fall in these reve n u e s ,
with unknown consequences for some
d e veloping economies and possibly for some
richer countries as we l l .
“If we don’t succeed in reaching an
a greement [on intern ational accounting
r at e s ] , in the next few ye a rs we will see
chaos and anarchy in telecommunications
and many people in the deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries will suffer tremendously,” a r g u e s
Pekka Tarjanne.“And so will customers in
the developed world.”
But the poorest countries are likely to
suffer most.“The least developed countri e s
and other low-income small economies with,
s ay, less than one million inhabitants, a r e
likely to be hardest hit,” by reform of the
system according to the Intern at i o n a l
Te l e c o m m u n i c ation Union. Ja m a i c a , f o r
example earns around $150 million a ye a r
from intern at i o n a l telephone calls.
“Reduction in . . . r ates will reduce this
i n flow, affecting the country ’s foreign
exchange and balance of trade,” s ays Cezley
Sampson of the Mona Institute of Business
Studies at the Unive rsity of the West Indies.
It will also lead to a wo rse telephone serv i c e
in the country, according to Ja m a i c a n
Ambassador A n t h o ny Hill. “ Too rapid a
reduction in settlement rates will lead to
substantial increases in local telephone
charges leading to significant serv i c e
d i s c o n n e c t i o n s ,” he say s.
W hy is the system falling apart? A major
reason is technology.The technical costs of
i n t e rn ational telecommunications are
p l u m m e t i n g .A single pair of optical fib r e s ,
each the thickness of a human hair, c a n
n ow carry all of North A m e ri c a ’s long
distance communications traffic. T h e
capacity of networks built with these fibres
is ten times that of networks built just a few
ye a rs ago. T h at means much lowe r
o p e r ating costs for companies—and thus
the opportunity to charge much lowe r
prices.
Te c h n o l o gical costs have fallen so
m u c h , according to the ITU, t h at “the cost
of an intern ational link is effectively close to
zero, [and] it could almost be dismissed as
h aving no bearing on the cost of an
i n t e rn ational call.” But while the cost of
calls placed through satellites or undersea
cables has been falling by as much as 30
per cent per year since the early 1990s,
according to the ITU, i n t e rn at i o n a l
accounting rates have been falling by only 9
per cent.
Technology is not the only fa c t o r ,
h owe ve r. Most people complain that
i n t e rn ational telephone calls still cost too
m u c h — but intern ational conglomerates and
m u l t i n ationals don’t just complain, t h e y
d e m a n d .Te l e c o m m u n i c ations is at the heart
of the modern global economy with tri l l i o n s
of dollars being traded over telephone wires
each ye a r , and the pressures to force pri c e s
d own are immense. This is a key reason
behind the increasing liberalization of
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations—and with it intense
competition between telephone companies.
Opening markets
to competition
In Fe b ru a ry this ye a r , 72 countri e s ,w h i c h
b e t ween them control 93 per cent of global
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations traffic, began to
implement a World Trade Organizat i o n
a greement to open up their
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations markets to foreign
c o m p e t i t i o n . This has led to an orgy of
m e r g e rs between giant telecommunicat i o n s
c o m p a n i e s.With countries now opening their
markets to competition and so much of the
wo r l d ’s telecommunications traffic being
d o m i n ated by giant intern at i o n a l
c o n g l o m e r at e s , it is becoming almost

impossible for developing countries to
continue to charge the prices they wa n t .
One country, h owe ve r , has decided that
it can wait no longer for reform .The United
S t ates is the big loser under the old
system—its companies run a deficit of
almost $6 billion a year in accounting rate
p ay m e n t s. The US has thus decided to
introduce its own pricing system which will
only allow US companies to pay companies
in other countries ve ry reduced prices to
complete intern ational calls.“[The existing
system] is an ancient, o u t m o d e d , p r o -
monopoly system of settlement payments
b e t ween countries that has propped up
overly high charges to consumers for
i n t e rn ational calls and led to a huge outflow
of money from the US to foreign
c o m p a n i e s ,” said Reed Hundt, the then
chairman of the US government’s Federal
C o m m u n i c ations Commission (FCC)
when he announced the move in 1996.
Although the FCC system, which comes
into force next ye a r , a l l ows the poorest
countries up to five years before they have
to pay the new pri c e s , the US move has
infuriated many countries.
“The settlement rate in Colombia is
around 50 cents per minute—more than
twice that of rates proposed by the FCC,”
argues David Tow n s e n d , a consultant who

Mexico 878.2
India 298.8
China 267.1
Hong Kong 208
Japan 171.4
Philippines 157.8
Colombia 139.5
Brazil 133.7
Argentina 132.7
Pakistan 127.1
has made a special study for the ITU on the
impact of accounting rate reductions on
C o l o m b i a . “Accounting rates set at the FCC
benchmarks would have ve ry severe negat i ve
impact on the Colombian telecommunicat i o n s
sector—in fact Colombian operat o rs would lose
money on eve ry call,” he say s.The FCC disagr e e s
with his analysis.
Some have even accused the US of a new form
of colonialism in its accounting rate policy.
“ H i s t o ri c a l l y, the US has refused to be regulat e d
by the ITU and when not able to get its own way
within the ITU has resorted to intern at i o n a l i z i n g
its own domestic law,” s ays Professor Jill Hills of
the Intern ational Institute of Telecoms Regulat o rs
in London.“The FCC’s threat to withdraw from
the ITU’s system of accounting rates follows this
t r a d i t i o n ,” she argues.
H owe ve r , it is widely accepted that the
c u rrent system needs radical reform . In 1992,
for example, the ITU adopted a resolution
calling for settlement payments to reflect the real
costs of completing calls.
The technological and economic changes
sweeping the telecommunications industry offer
huge new opportunities for many developing
c o u n t ries to “ l e a p f r o g ” the older industrial powe rs.
Instead of having to invest billions in digging
trenches to bu ry cables, as the industrial powe rs
have done, liberalization can potentially help
mobilize massive foreign investment to create
n at i o n - w i d e ,s t ate of the art ,d i gital networks based
on mobile telecommunications and optic fib r e s.
The bottom line, though,is that at a critical
moment in their economic development, some
of the world’s poorest countries find themselves
with a huge economic handicap in the
telecommunications race. If nothing is done to
help them, this handicap could last for a
generation. n
