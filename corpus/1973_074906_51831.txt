rights and other themes (1). No less than 100
Unesco Member States brought out special stamp
.issues to commemorate the 20th anniversary of



the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among
them several with outstandingly successful designs.
United Nations stamps quickly found favour
with philatelists throughout the world and for the
collector U.N. stamps represent a good investment.
The 50 cent stamp of the first regular series of
1951 is now valued at about $18, the 1954 series
of two human rights stamps which had a face value
of 11 cents fetch about $32 and the 1955 souvenir
sheet for the 10th anniversary of the United
Nations has a market price of about $143.

UNESCO AND THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
(Continued from page 4)
the League of Nations, not only played
a major rôle in laying down and pro¬
tecting workers' rights, but also pio¬
neered a number of new and dynamic
legal and political concepts in the
field of social rights.
The same period saw the estab¬
lishment of the International Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation. But as
Gian Franco Pompei, former chairman
of the Unesco Executive Board, writes
in "In the Minds of Men", although
the Institute "is sometimes thought of
as the embryo of Unesco, (it) was
very different from Unesco in Its non-
govermental structure and its aims."
Thus, between 1919 and 1939,
human rights made their first tenta¬
tive appearance on the international
scene in a manner which was prag¬
matic, fragmentary, unco-ordinated and
fortuituous... one might almost say by
stealth; however, as this sort of
tachiste picture of human rights took
shape, the background remained domi¬
nated by the cold marble figures of
sovereign States.
icase ¡n point an isolated
incident but highly revealing ocurred
in Geneva "when a German citizen of
Upper Silesia complained to the Coun¬
cil of the League of Nations concern¬
ing the violation by Hitler's régime
of the German-Polish Treaty, signed
in 1922 under the auspices of the
League of Nations, guaranteeing the
rights of minorities within those
territories.
"Discussion in the Assembly, ini¬
tially restricted to the matter of 'mino¬
rities', was extended to a wider field
of reference, that of human rights not
expressly covered by the Covenant
of the League of Nations.
"The delegates of Member States,
who were determined to fulfil their
social and humanitarian obligations
but, at the same time, were anxious
to avoid a break with Hitler's Germany,
which had remained a member of the
League of Nations, adopted a draft
resolution, couched in very moderate
terms, which merely invited the gov¬
ernments concerned, to respect human
rights even if they were not mention¬
ed in a treaty.
"But this was to no avail. Goebbels
adamantly insisted that: 'Every man
is master in his own house. The
sovereignty of the Reich precludes
any form of interference in its internal
affairs. The way in which it treats
its citizens is its own concern.'
"A few days after this vote, on
October 21, 1933, Germany announc¬
ed its withdrawal from the Conference
for Reduction and Limitation of Arma¬
ments and from the League. Thus, the
break occurred principally over the
problem of human rights.
"In the ensuing tragedy, one of
the crucial points at issue was whether
human beings, who in the eyes of
international law, might as individuals
be considered the injured or the guilty
party, should not be recognized as
persons in international law subject
to the obligations that this status
implies while, at the same time, having
a legal right to the protection and the
guarantees afforded by the law of
nations. " (René Cassin, "La Décla¬
ration Universelle et la Mise en
des Droits de l'Homme", in Académie
Internationale de La Haye, Recueil des
Cours, 1951).
At the height of the Second World
War and at a time when men and
women in the countries of the free
world were engaged in a heroic
struggle against totalitarianism, certain
pioneering minds conceived the idea
of a world which would not be govern¬
ed exclusively by sovereign States
for the sole purpose of furthering
their own material interests.
As early as 1941, a speech by
Franklin D. Roosevelt had given pro¬
minence to the equality of economic,
social and cultural rights on the one
hand, and of civil and political liberties
on the other, by giving the same
emphasis to freedom from "fear and
want" as to traditional fundamental
freedoms, such as freedom of speech
and expression and freedom of wor¬
ship.
Similarly, the Declaration of the
26 United Nations of January 1, 1942
was a big stride forward in the inter¬
nationalization of human rights: not
only did these nations proclaim the
necessity of protecting and respecting
human rights within "their own terri¬
tory" but also in the territory "of
other countries". This was an implicit
affirmation of a real measure of inter¬
national supervision in the field of
human rights.
The march of history continued:
in November 1942, in a London batter¬
ed by air raids, the President of the
Board of Education of England and
Wales, Richard A. Butler, invited his
colleagues from the allied govern¬
ments in exile to lay the foundations
of an international organization for
education.
In April 1944, the Conference of
Allied Ministers of Education, at which
the United States was represented by
Senator James W. Fulbright, drafted a
project for such an organization. On
June 28, 1945, the Charter of the
United Nations was adopted and the
United Nations came into existence.
On November 20, 1946, the first
session of Unesco opened with a
membership of 34 States which adopt¬
ed a budget of $6,950,000.
The Charter of the United Nations
had brought about a veritable political
and juridical revolution: it gave as
much weight to respect for human
rights and to international co-operation
in the economic, social, intellectual
and humanitarian fields as to the main¬
tenance of peace and security or,
rather, it regarded these two aspects
as inseparable. (Until then only the
preamble to the statutes of the
International Labour Organization had
adopted a similar position, as early as
1919, concerning working conditions.)
The Constitution of Unesco, which
shared the same general aims, was
clearly explicit in linking the consoli¬
dation of peace and the efforts made
by individual States in areas which
had never previously been considered
indispensable to the achievement of
such a goal: "a peace based exclusi¬
vely on the political and economic
arrangements of governments would
not be a peace which could secure
the unanimous, lasting and sincere
support of the peoples of the world;
... peace must therefore be founded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind."
To this end, in the words of the
Constitution, "full and equal oppor¬
tunities for education for all, ... the
unrestricted pursuit of objective truth,
and... the free exchange of ideas and
knowledge" as well as the fight
against prejudice, particularly racial
prejudice, became "weapons" which
were to prevent the recurrence of
war, and also indispensable means
towards the establishment of a true
international community.
ARALLEL with the creation
of Unesco, and as part of the same
general inspiration, other U.N. Speciali¬
zed Agencies appeared, such as the
World Health Organization and the
Food and Agriculture Organization,
while the Economic and Social Council,
established by the Charter of the
United Nations, was to co-ordinate
and to promote the execution of this
great enterprise.
As this undertaking rested largely
on the hopes which had been pinned
on the development of human rights
through international co-operation, it
is understandable in retrospect, that
the same impetus that had brought
the United Nations together, and that OC
had strongly influenced the distribution ÜÜ
of tasks within the newly created
system, should have resulted in a U.N.
