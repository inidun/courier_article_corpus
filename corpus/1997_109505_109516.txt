threats to
New Caledonia:
iodiversity

Oro Bay on the Isle
of Pines.
New Caledonia is a French
Territoire d'outre mer (over¬
seas territory forming part of the
French Republic) in the southern
part of Melanesia, half-way between
Australia and New Zealand. Unlike
its neighbours Vanuatu, the Solomon
Islands and Fiji, the island is not of
volcanic origin but became separate
from the great landmass of Gond-
wana 80 million years ago, whereas
the 1,600-km barrier reef sur¬
rounding it and the three Loyalty
Islands of Mare, Lifou and Ouvéa
were formed much more recently. A
range of mountains runs down the
centre of New Caledonia, which is
nicknamed "Ze Caillou" (the Rock).
With an area of about 19,000 sq.
km., the main island oí Grande Terre
is slightly smaller than Wales but has
only 165,000 inhabitants, of whom
65,000 live in the capital, Nouméa. It
is a place of diversity in every respect,
starting with population, since
Kanaks, Wallis Islanders, Indonesians,
Ni-Vanuatu, Arabs and Europeans
live there side by side. It is ranked
fourth in the world for its biological
diversity and second for the extent of
its coral reefs and atolls. It has 3,250
species of flowering plants (76% of
them endemic to the island), 4,500
invertebrates, 148 birds and many
species of reptiles such as turtles,
lizards and geckos. But unfortunately
this haven of wildlife is being gravely
threatened by human activities.
The landscape is very varied.
While the south and west of the island
are relatively dry (1 to 1.5 metres of
rainfall a year), average annual rain¬
fall in the east is between 1.5 and 3.5
metres (and as much as 8 metres on
the island's highest mountain, Mont
Panié), and it is in that part of the
island that the lush tropical vegeta¬
tion, the thousands of streams, the
famous colonial pines (of the Arau¬
caria family), tree ferns and orchids
are found.
RICH PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE
According to the American non-gov¬
ernmental organization Conservation
International, research carried out
© ~ . ^^ - *
by botanists Norman Myers and Russ
Mittermayer, the organization's Pres¬
ident, show that New Caledonia is
one of the richest places in the world
in terms of biodiversity, and one of
the places where biodiversity is most
threatened.
The fauna of New Caledonia is
typical of a remote island. There are
many endemic, species. Out of 116
species of nesting birds, 18 are
endemic. The most extraordinary of
them, the big grey woodland bird
known as the kagu (Rhynochetos
jubatus) is the country's emblem.
Like the extinct Mauritian dodo, it
is flightless and thus an easy prey for
wild dogs and cats. Today, like the
Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicen-
sis), it survives only because it is care¬
fully protected, having been made
the subject of an active conservation
policy in 1990. Luckily for the bird,
it is not a gastronomic delicacy and is
not hunted, unlike the notu (Duculia
goliath), the world's largest pigeon.
The island is also home to the largest
known gecko, the Rhacodactylus
leachianus. As regards insects, 4,000
species have so far been recorded but
no-one can tell whether this repre¬
sents half or even a fifth of those actu¬
ally living in New Caledonia. No thor¬
ough study of the island's fungi has
yet been carried out.
The most serious threat to the
island's vegetation is that affecting
the dry (sclerophyllous) forest on
the eastern side, of which only 2%
remains, in isolated clumps. Its dis¬
appearance is due to the combined
effects of forest fires, encroachment
by grazing lands and urbanization,
and introduced species such as the
Timor deer (Certrts timorensis), the
population of which has grown since
the end of the last century to nearly
110,000 and which trample or eat
the saplings, preventing any regen¬
eration of the forest cover. The rain¬
forest and scrub which cover 20%

and 24% respectively of the terri¬
tory represent the principal habitat
of the endemic plant species (88%
and 81% respectively). Some of
these species are now only repre¬
sented by a few specimens, while
others have disappeared altogether.
Conversely, a new species of wild rice
(Oryza neocaledonica) was identi¬
fied in 1994 near Pouembout, which
goes to show that much remains to
be done before a complete inventory
is made.
Research is also being conducted
to determine on an objective basis
the therapeutic value of plants used
in traditional medicine. The Kanak
have, for instance, treated the trop¬
ical food poisoning known as ciguat¬
era (see box) for centuries with an
infusion of the leaves of the false
tobacco plant (Argusia argéntea) or
a maceration of the false pepper tree
(Schinus terebenthifolius). Although
the toxins causing this illness have
been isolated, no Western medical
treatment is capable of curing it, let
alone preventing it.
'FIRE PAINTS
THE MOUNTAIN BLACK'
A drive through the country will show
whether the pessimism expressed by
Conservation International over the
state of nature conservation in New
Caledonia is justified. The road from
Nouméa to Koumac runs along the
west coast of the main island. Bare

hillsides with occasional patches of
vivid green forest dominate the savan¬
nah from which emerge the white
trunks of the niaoulis (Melaleuca
quinquenervia), close relatives of the
eucalyptus, and large trees grow in
profusion along the river banks, but
the countryside has been ravaged by
fire. Plumes of smoke and the scars
left by previous conflagrations are a
constant reminder that fire is an ever-
present danger (it rages through more
than 50,000 hectares every year). Its
main causes are carelessness, slash-
and-burn cultivation, the setting of
fires to flush out game animals or
exterminate rats and other vermin,

the burning of rubbish, and arson,
and its results are impoverishment of
the soil, the acceleration of erosion,
shrinkage of natural forests, the dis¬
appearance of unique plants and the
destruction of the nests of rare birds
and insects. Everything burns, even
the sheerest mountain sides. "Fire
paints the mountain black," say the
Kanak. Only the tropical rainforest
areas manage to resist.
STRIP MINING
Respect also needs to be shown for
New Caledonia's soil, which is
extremely rich in nickel, chromium,
cobalt, manganese and lead all of
them usually toxic for plants. Nickel
(probably the world's biggest deposit),
discovered here in 1864, is so abun¬
dant that the country is one of the
world's largest producers, and stocks
are nowhere near exhausted. When
ore was found on the tops and slopes
of the mountains, the early mine-own¬
ers did not hesitate to strip them bare.

like great steps cut into an orange
pyramid.
Until the 1970s, spoil from the
mines was unceremoniously shoved
down the mountain sides , taking with
it the thin layer of fertile humus.
Planting of the spoil-heaps is now
being carried out by private compa¬
nies, in collaboration with ORSTOM
(the French government agency for
overseas scientific and technical
research) and CIRAD (France's Inter¬
national Co-operation Centre of Agri¬
cultural Research for Development),
using local species specially chosen
for their capacity to tolerate heavy
metals and fix nitrogen, but the task
is a mammoth one. Furthermore, the
alumina and iron oxide leached out
by the rains pollute first the rivers
then the coral lagoons. .
UNRELIABLE PROTECTION
Another problem is erosion: the rate
in New Caledonia is one of the highest
in the world, since the effects of min¬
ing are combined with those of defor¬
estation. Sandalwood, rosewood and
the tall kauri trees (Aguthis lanceo-
lata) have all but disappeared. There
is still a single giant kauri, the sole
surviving witness to a bygone age, in
Rivière Bleue Park, south of Nouméa.
Some 800 years old, 40 metres tall
and with a trunk nearly three metres
in diameter, it has become a visitor
attraction. The Park, which forms
part of the 15,900-hectare Haute
Yaté wildlife reserve, covers 9,045
hectares. In one spot, a forest has been
engulfed by the Yaté reservoir, from
whose bright blue waters emerge tree-
trunks seemingly carved out of ivory.
In another, the botanical reserve of
the Chutes de la Madeleine, the local
authorities have, to the fury of ecol-
ogists, laid out a recreation area with
shelters , barbecues and toilets . Even
worse, Neocallitropsis araucarioides
trees belonging to a rare species with
a distinctive twisted shape, which
were probably a thousand years old,
once grew near to the river but have
been felled for their perfumed essen¬
tial oils.
Fires, mining and poaching are
wreaking slow but sure destruction
upon natural sites of exceptional
value in New Caledonia. Small areas
and pockets have, it is true, been
declared land-based or marine
reserves, but do they really provide
protection? The delisting, in 1980,
of the Oro peninsula nature reserve
on the Ile des Pins shows just how
unreliable such protection is. A
hotel complex will soon occupy this
exceptionally beautiful site, once a
sacred Kanak burial-ground
prompting Russ Mittermayer to
remark that, in New Caledonia, the
protection of the environment is not
a priority. I

the many causes
of deforestation.
