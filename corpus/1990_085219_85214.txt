lived on Earth for 1 50
million years, from the Triassic to the
Cretaceous Periods, and then became
extinct. Reptiles with elongated legs,
they are a source of interest and
astonishment because of the gigantic
size of some of them, because of
their strange shape and their longevi¬
ty, and because they disappeared
simultaneously from the face of the
Earth 65 million years ago.
Study of their skeletons has
made it possible to reconstitute the
physical appearance of dinosaurs, but
the reason for their disappearance
has proved more difficult to establish.
Specialists in several scientific dis¬
ciplines including biology, physiolo¬
gy, palaeoclimatology, palaeography
and astronomy have tried to solve the
mystery. Many hypotheses have been
proposed, most of them short-lived.
At present there are two conflicting
theories based on diametrically op¬
posed premises and modes of reason¬
ing. According to the first or
"catastrophist" thesis, dinosaurs
were exterminated by extra-terrestrial
objects. The second, or "gradualist"
thesis is centred on the evolution of
geological phenomena.
The killer comet theory
Large amounts of iridium, palladium
and platinum have been found near
Gubbio in central Italy in sediments
deposited during the transition be¬
tween the Cretaceous and the Ter¬
tiary Periodswhat is known as the
K/T boundary. Layers rich in iridium
from the same geological period have
also been found in Denmark, Spain,
France and New Zealand. The Ameri¬
can geologist Walter Alvarez believes
that the fact that the sedimentary
deposits date from the same period
as the extinction of the dinosaurs can¬
not be a mere matter of chance,
and that there is a cause-and-effect
relationship between the two
phenomena.
The scenario proposed by Alva¬
rez in 1980 is as follows: iridium is
a very rare element and its concen¬
tration in a sedimentary deposit must
result, not from the erosion of an¬
cient rocks nor from biochemical
phenomena, but from the impact
made by an extraterrestrial object
that collided with the Earth.
Meteorites are rich in iridium and
Alvarez suggested that a meteorite
with a diameter of between 6 and 1 0
kilometres crashed into the Earth and
raised an immense cloud of terrestrial
dust which mingled with the dust
released by the break-up of the
meteorite itself, blotting out the sun¬
light and preventing photosynthesis
from taking place. This night may

have lasted between six and ten
years, during which the dinosaurs
died of hunger. The much smaller
mammals may have survived by eat¬
ing seeds and undecomposed plant
residues.
Since it was first put forward, this
theory has undergone several modifi¬
cations. In the iridium-rich layers it has
been observed that the mass of mat¬
ter of terrestrial origin is much less
than that which the impact of a
meteorite could have produced. Thus
the meteorite was replaced by co¬
mets which would have disintegrat¬
ed as they approached the Earth and
unleashed a hail of debris. After that
point the scenario is unchanged.
Falling sea levels
and glaciation
Another theory, which I first put for¬
ward in 1 964, is based on the fact
that what are now known as the
mass extinctions coincided with
regressions of the sea. Each major di¬
vision in the geological time-scale be¬
gins with a marine transgression (the
spread of the sea over land areas) ac¬
companied by the appearance of a
new fauna, and ends with a marine
regression (the retreat of the sea)
which is contemporary with a mass
extinction. It is hard to believe that
the simultaneous occurrence of ma¬
rine regressions and mass extinctions
over a period of 600 million years
could have been fortuitous. There
must have been a direct cause-and-
effect relationship between the fluc¬
tuations of sea level and the renew¬
al of animal life in the course of
geological time.
The neritic regions, which con¬
sist of the belt of shallow water ad¬
joining the seacoast up to a depth of
some 1 20 metres, are those in which
sunlight penetrates most. They are

consequently the parts of the ocean
which are richest in microflora and
hence, because of the food chain, in
fauna. The great invasions of the sea
were a time of expansion for the
nentic regions. In the Middle Creta¬
ceous, for example, they covered
most of Europe from Brittany to the
Urals. The retreat of the sea during
the Late Cretaceous reduced the area
of this submarine continental plateau
by between 200 and 300 times. Lack
of space led to competition between
the marine animals which lived there.
The fauna were thus reduced natur¬
ally as the space available to them
diminished.
Almost all groups of animals
were affected. Some, such as the am¬
monites, the belemnites and the ma¬
rine reptiles which fed on them,
disappeared totally. Others, such as
the brachiopods and to a much
smaller extent the echinoderms, did
not totally disappear but were strong¬
ly affected. Furthermore, the sea
retreated slowly, over a period of 1 5
million years. The extinction of am¬
monites and other zoological groups
thus took place gradually, as did that
of the dinosaurs.
The extension of the land surface
must have provoked a continentali-
zation of the climate, bringing wider
differences in temperature between
winter and summer. There was also
a general fall in mean annual tem¬
perature.
The dinosaurs, large animals of
variable temperature, were directly
affected by climatic cooling. Their in¬
ternal temperature, like that of all
reptiles, followed the fluctuations of
the surrounding temperature and
when the latter dropped to the limit
of the internal temperature necessary
for biological activity, they perished.
Small reptiles were more resistant

since they could hibernate or go to
ground, as species do in temperate
regions today. Since their tempera¬
ture is constant, mammals and birds
are less dependent on external climat¬
ic conditions than reptiles and were
thus able to survive the transition be¬
tween the Cretaceous and the Ter¬
tiary Periods.
These two theories have their
supporters and their detractors. The
theory of the killer comet, based as
it is on extraterrestrial phenomena,
has exercised a strong fascination on
the public and received wide media
coverage. It has topical overtones in
an age of space exploration and fear
of thermonuclear destruction. If it
were proved to be correct, it might
also provide an acceptable approxi¬
mation of the effects of a major
nuclear catastrophe on the bi¬
osphere.
More biological in nature and
more global in its scope, the falling
sea level theory explains a greater
number of obscure phenomena, and
provides a link between a range of
geological events. Consequently, it is
more widely accepted by geologists
and palaeontologists. However, it is
complex, technical and unspectacu¬
lar. In a century of speed, record-
breaking and concern for short-term
profit, a theory based on the effects
of a phenomenon which took place
over 15 million years may have less
immediate appeal than its rival.
