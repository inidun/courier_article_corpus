THREE-DIMENSIONAL
HISTORY CLASS IN HÜNGARY
Above, students at a girls' secondary school in Debrecen (Hungary)
put the finishing touch to a model of the Acropolis. Below left, the
Leaning Tower of Pisa. Below right, visitors examine the temple of
Der El Bahri (Thebes, Egypt) built exactly to scale. The models
stimulate student interest in history and different culture« far more
effectively than textbook illustrations or film slides.

A pioneer experiment in the use of three-
dimensional visual materials in teaching is being
carried out in a secondary school in Hungary.
John Porcsalmy, a history teacher at the
"Csokonai" girls school in Debrecen, has
created a school museum made up of models
of all types of architecture such as dwelling
places, religious buildings, archaeological sites
and public buildings and monuments, represen¬
tative of various parts of the world and different
periods of civilization. What makes this "school
museum" particularly original is the fact that
it is the pupils themselves, with the help of a
few craftsmen, who make the models. Made
chiefly of wood, plaster and cardboard, the
models range from prehistoric monuments such
as the standing stones of Carnac (France) and
the Cromlech of Stonehenge (U.K.) to the
Egyptian pyramids at Gizeh and the Byzantine
church at Novgorod (U.S.S.R.), and include a
number of Hungary's own monuments. The
school museum has also assembled a collection
of reproductions of ancient clothes, tools and
other objects, copied by students from originals
loaned by museums. According to Mr Porc¬
salmy, a far greater interest is aroused among
students by these models than by the pictures
in text books and the showing of slides. Other
schools in Hungary, inspired by Debrecen's
example, are adopting the same techniques.
