B o r n e o : re a p i n g t h e
fruits of ecotourism
◗ Robert Basiuk
The Iban people are highly dependent on the riches 
of the forest for their survival, and tourism has become an added
incentive to protect this wealth
Since they settled in the Malaysian state of
S a r awak over 400 ye a rs ago, the Iban have
made the surrounding rainforest their super-
market and hardware store, tapping the tremendous
va riety of plants, animals and raw mat e rials for
their food,medicines, dwellings and rituals.
This region of nort h we s t e rn Borneo is identifie d
as one of the wo r l d ’s most biodive rs i t y - rich areas. I t s
resources are so important to the Iban that local cus-
t o m a ry laws stipulate taboos against felling cert a i n
t r e e s , killing va rious animals and cutting forest
areas containing valuable fruits and construction
materials.
The traditional Iban dwelling is the longhouse, a
s e m i - p e rmanent structure housing 20 or more fa m i-
lies in separate living apart m e n t s.Their main live l i-
hood is from fa rming (hill ri c e ) , fis h i n g, s m a l l - s c a l e
r e a ring of live s t o c k ,g at h e ring of jungle produce and
occasional hunting. Until recently, r e s i n s , r at t a n s ,
animal products and scented wood were among the
i m p o rtant items exchanged for non-forest goods
such as steel and cloth. Demand for some products
has ceased and with it their value as a barter trade
i t e m . Transition towards a cash economy has also
changed the needs of the villages.While supplies of
r attans and sandalwood have diminished, t o u rism has
emerged as a new market for biodive rsity over the past
ten to fifteen ye a rs.
Ulu A i , established by the Kuching-based ope-
rator Borneo Adventure, is one example of a new
g e n e r ation of tourism products promoting the intri-
c ate relationship between the rainforest and its
dwellers. The Ulu Batang Ai is a remote, unspoilt
a r e a : the ri ve rs are tree-lined and clear and the
landscape is rugged with steep hills giving rise to
many waterfalls.

in Sarawak (Malaysia) since 1983.
Mr Basiuk has served as a wildlife
officer for the Sarawak National
Park,held various senior positions
with the state tourism board and
helped to set up Borneo Adventure.
Since 1998,he has worked as a
consultant on a variety of projects
related to tourism and natural
resource management.

B e yond the Ai ri ver are the Lanjak Entimau W i l d-
life Sanctuary and the Batang Ai National Pa r k ,e s t a-
blished to protect the last wild population of orang-
u t a n .While the Iban living in this area are reasonably
s e l f - s u f ficient in terms of food and can manufa c t u r e
most of their daily necessities from local mat e ri a l s ,t h e y
did not—until recently—have a steady cash income as
the distance from markets makes cash crop fa rm i n g
and market gardening unfeasible.
Premium orang-utan
The village was first approached in 1986, s h o rt l y
after Borneo Adventure had been formed, to see if
its inhabitants would be interested in receiving visi-
t o rs in their longhouse.The arrangement proposed
was that the village would provide transport ,g u i d e s ,
food and accommodation and Borneo Adventure
would bring in the touri s t s. From the start , t h e
project aimed to bring visitors to experience the lon-
ghouse and up-ri ver lifestyle and to provide an
incentive for the community to conserve the local
wildlife—in this case cash earned from taking tou-
rists on jungle hikes.
The area is prized for its orang-utan populat i o n ,
a totally protected species although sporadic hun-
ting by outsiders has occurred in the past.While
local fa rm e rs would not harm the orang-utan them-
s e l ve s , they were reluctant to protect them from out-
side hunters, as they can cause extensive damage.
Because local village guides are tipped over and
above their daily wage when orang-utan are seen,
longhouse people now view this species as a precious
c o m m o d i t y, keeping track of their movements and
informing authorities if hunters are believed to be
in the area. A secondary benefit has been the re-
kindling of traditional stories and lore concerning
the links between the Iban and the orang-utan,
which are often referred to as “grandfathers”.
The village invo l vement in tourism has also bene-
fited other wildlife in the area. Fish catches have
r e c overed from the pre-tourism days when one of the
few sources of cash income was to sell the fish to
d ow n - ri ver bu ye rs.With no control over catch rat e s ,
the stocks were in danger of being depleted—and with
t h at an important source of protein and reve n u e .
With a reasonably steady altern at i ve cash flow from
t o u ri s m , stocks have now been stabilized.
In 1999, 26 families received over RM 300,000
($82,000) in touri s m - r e l ated pay. In addition to the
wages earned as guides,b o at dri ve rs and cooks, as we l l
as rental for the guesthouse, the village people also
e a rn money selling traditional handicrafts such as
woven blankets ($10,000 in 1999).This income has
also allowed the village to break out of the subsistence
a griculture cycle and dive rsify their economy to include
more efficient cash crops.The reduced demand for
expansion onto new land means that less forest is cut,
u l t i m ately providing more habitat for wildlife.
The project receives about 1,000 visitors a ye a r ,
considered a threshold number.Villagers are gra-
dually taking on more managerial roles, such as
ove rseeing quality control. Fe a ring that they could
lose a valuable source of income and employ m e n t ,
they are also intent on ensuring that the land sur-
rounding the longhouses is secured and managed by
them. They recently presented a proposal to the
government of Sarawak to this effect.Their desire
is to have the state land area beyond the longhouse
land and before the existing National Park offi-
cially designated as village conservation land to be
managed for tourism by the village.
As of today, the government has not answered
their proposal. In the meantime, visitors are still
enjoying the experience of the lush, tropical Iban
s u p e rmarket and sightings of wild orang-utan are on
the rise. ■
In Sarawak,the Iban people welcome some 1,000 tourists every year into their longhouses.
