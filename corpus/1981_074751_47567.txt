The Disinherited
A dossier on
Least
Developed
Countries
The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Coun¬
tries, held at Unesco's Paris headquarters from 1 to 14
September, 1981, reflected the will of the international com¬
munity to give unique attention and support to overcoming the
basic development problems of the poorest, weakest countries
in the world the least developed countries. It should be seen as
part of efforts to alleviate poverty generally in all developing
countries, and as part of the broader efforts to establish the New
International Economic Order.
The group of least developed countries now comprises a
population of approximately 275 million or about one-eighth of
the population of all developing countries (excluding China). Ac¬
cording to recommendations by the United Nations Committee
for Development Planning, the expression "least developed
countries" means the weakest in terms of certain economic and
social criteria: low income, low literacy rate and low share of
manufacturing in total output.
What are the reasons for the very low level of most of the
economic and social indicators for the least developed countries
as well as for the weak, and sometimes even deteriorating, per¬
formance over time of many of them?
Although quite diverse in a number of structural charac¬
teristics, they have in common: a high percentage of population
dependent on agriculture; extremely limited manufacturing ac¬
tivity; very low rates of economic growth; exports limited to a
few primary products; natural resources either unexploited,
limited or non-existent; often subject to severe geographic,
climatic or topographical handicaps; extremely limited
resources of skilled personnel; widespread malnutrition; lack of
safe drinking water; limited health services and education
systems; low levels of investment; heavy dependence on foreign
aid; lack of foreign exchange to command imports needed for
development.
On the following pages the Unesco Courier presents a dossier
on the appalling problems facing the Least Developed Countries.
The necessarily brief reports are based on summaries prepared
by the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on the Least
Developed Countries on the basis of presentations made by the
countries concerned. In the case of Guinea the summary was
prepared by the country itself. In the case of Chad, no country
presentation was made and the figures quoted in this dossier are
taken from a variety of United Nations sources.
A deliberate choice was made to present the current situation
of each country and to exclude the detailed development plans
drawn up by countries themselves. It cannot be too strongly em¬
phasized that the Least Developed Countries, without exception,
are themselves making tremendous efforts against virtually im¬
possible odds to remedy a situation which dishonours the entire
world.

The world community adopts a ten-year action programme
When the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed
Countries ended on 14 September, it was amid hopes that the
world community had agreed on a prescription which would relieve
the plight of the 275 million people living in the world's poorest and
economically weakest nations. These hopes repose on a Substan¬
tial New Programme of Action for the 1980s (SNPA) which
delegates adopted by acclamation.
The Programme, approval of which climaxed two weeks of
discussion and negotiations in which representatives of 142 coun¬
tries took part, is designed to transform the economies of the least
developed countries towards sustained self development and
enable them to provide at least internationally-accepted minimum
standards of nutrition, health, housing and education, as well as
job opportunities to all their citizens, particularly to the rural and
urban poor.
The Substantial New Programme of Action has three chapters:
Chapter I deals with the general situation and national measures;
Chapter II covers international support measures, and Chapter III
arrangements for implementation, follow-up and monitoring.
In the introduction to the Chapter on the general situation and
national measures, the Conference stated that the least developed
countries have the primary responsibility for their overall develop¬
ment. Sections are devoted to measures that should be envisaged
at the national level in key sectors such as food and agriculture,
human resources and social development, natural resources and
energy and the manufacturing industry.
Among the objectives cited are the 4 per cent annual growth
target in agriculture set In the International Development Strategy
for the Third United Nations Development Decade for all develop¬
ing countries, so that food production in each country would in¬
crease faster than population growth with a view to guaranteeing
food security. The target set for the manufacturing industry in the
least developed countries should aim at increasing the rate of
manufacturing growth to an overall annual growth of 9 per cent or
more.
The dependence of the least developed countries on external aid
is indicated by the fact that they are now able to finance only half of
their imports out of export earnings. The import costs of these
countries has risen by $10 billion in the last decade with only a small
increase in the real volume of imports. With the growth in popula¬
tion there has been an actual decline in per capita terms. Recogniz¬
ing this situation, the Conference stated in the Programme of Ac¬
tion that only a "substantial" increase in official development
assistance in real terms during the 1980s would enable the least
developed countries to achieve the objectives of their country
programmes.
In the Programme, donor countries also reaffirmed their commit¬
ment to the target of 0.7 per cent of their Gross National Product
(GNP) for overall Official Development Assistance (ODA) to all
developing countries, as envisaged in the provisions of the Interna¬
tional Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Develop¬
ment Decade, and agreed that the flows of ODA would be increas¬
ingly directed towards the least developed countries.
According to the Programme, most donors of ODA will devote in
the coming years 0.15 per cent of their GNP to these countries.
Others will double their ODA to the least developed countries in the
same period. "Taken together these efforts are likely to achieve, by
1985, a doubling of ODA to the least developed countries, com¬
pared to the transfers to them during the last five years".
Agreement was also reached on other international support
measures related to aid modalities, technical assistance, commer¬
cial policy and transfer of technology. These measures taken
together were also considered as likely to have considerable impact
on the situation of the 31 least developed countries.
The programme emphasizes that regular review and monitoring
of its implementation at national, regional and global levels is
essential. National reviews would be fundamental for the execution
of the SNPA in the least developed countries while the regional and
global reviews will be crucial in ensuring international support for
it. The review mechanism as a whole will be a "means to ensure
that every least developed country receives an adequate minimum
flow of assistance and demonstrates a minimum standard of per¬
formance in economic development".

1. The Democratic
Republic of Afghanistan
2. The People's Republic
of Bangladesh
3. The People's Republic
of Benin
AFGHANISTAN is a land-locked country
with a surface area of about 650,000
square kilometres and a population
of about 15.5 million. Arable land accounts
for about 12 per cent of the total area, forest
and woodland for about 6 per cent. The ter¬
rain is mountainous or hilly, the climate con¬
tinental. About 71 per cent of the population
is rural, 16 per cent nomadic and 13 per cent
urban, with almost half the urban population
living in Kabul. Life expectancy at birth is 42
years. The number of children in primary
schools is expected to reach the one million
mark shortly; the adult literacy rate is about
12 per cent. Agriculture (including forestry)
is the principal activity, accounting for about
58 per cent of the national income in 1978/79
and for 70 per cent of employment. The main
crops are wheat, fruit, cotton and sugar
beet. Animal husbandry is a major occupa¬
tion for the rural and nomadic population
and livestock products are exported in con¬
siderable quantities. In 1978/79 industry ac¬
counted for about 11 per cent of the national
income and trade for about 9 per cent. The
active labour force is estimated at about 5
million. The country's mineral wealth (coal,
iron ore, copper, natural gas) and
agricultural raw materials provide a basis for
industrialization, and the energy potential,
as yet largely unexploited, is considerable.
The constraints hampering the industrializa¬
tion process are the rugged terrain, the land¬
locked situation of the country and the shor¬
tage of managerial manpower.
BANGLADESH, with a population over
90 million, is the world's eighth most
populous country (density about 580
persons to the square kilometre). Over 90 per
cent of the people live in rural areas and de¬
pend largely on agriculture and related ac¬
tivities for a living. The manufacturing sector
accounts for only some 10 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product. It is estimated that 80 per
cent of the population are living below the
poverty line, i.e. their income is not suffi¬
cient to cover minimum requirements of
food, shelter, clothing, education and health
care. The country's natural resource endow¬
ment is limited, consisting essentially of
fisheries, natural gas and some mineral
deposits. At present adequate shelter, piped
water, sanitation and other community
facilities are available only in about 100 urban
and semi-urban locations in the country, ser¬
ving about 10 per cent of the total popula¬
tion. There is one physician per 11,000 per¬
sons, one hospital bed per 4,500 persons. Of
the country's 8.500 medical practitioners,
fewer than 10 per cent work in the rural
areas. In earlier years privileged treatment
was accorded to university education, at the
expense of primary education and as a result
the literacy rate remained low (about 22 per
cent). Per capita consumption of energy is
one of the lowest in the world. While three-
quarters of the energy consumed comes
from sources like firewood, cow dung, etc.,
the import bill for fuel nevertheless
represents more than half the country's total
foreign exchange earnings. Vulnerability to
natural disasters (floods, cyclones) is
another formidable obstacle to sustained
economic and social development.
BENIN, a country of almost 113,000 sq.
km., is situated in the equatorial
coastal region of West Africa. Its
population was estimated in 1979 at about 3.3
million. The yearly demographic growth rate
is about 2.7 per cent. Owing to climatic con¬
ditions and to water-borne diseases, certain
infectious diseases and inadequate health
care, life expectancy at birth is very
lowabout 39 years. Infant mortality is very
high. Over 80 per cent of the population lives
in rural areas, which are poorly provided
with health services. The average school
enrolment was estimated at about 47 per
cent in 1978. The literacy rate of the popula¬
tion as a whole is estimated at about 12 per
cent, but it is thought that only about 5 per
cent of persons over the age of 35 can read
and write. Agriculture is the principal oc¬
cupation of over 60 per cent of the labour
force of about 1.5 million. The modern sector
gives employment to only about 61,600
wage-earners, of whom almost half are
employed in the public service. The physical
infrastructure, roads, railways, port, is in¬
adequate for the needs of the country's
economic development. Many rural
localities are not accessible the year round
and hence cannot market their produce.
Piped water and electricity supplies are
available virtually only in the large urban cen¬
tres. The country's principal export com¬
modities are palm oil, coffee, cotton,
groundnuts and shrimps. Both the value and
the volume of these exports have been
declining in recent years.

4. The Kingdom
of Bhutan
THE Kingdom of Bhutan, a land-locked
country with a total land area of about
47,000 square kilometres in the Hima¬
layan ranges, has a population estimated at
1.2 million. There are three climatic zones:
the southern characterized by a hot humid
tropical climate; the central belt is
temperate; and the northern area is alpine.
About 70 per cent of the total surface area
consists of forest, 9 per cent is under cultiva¬
tion and the rest is wilderness. The vast ma¬
jority of the Bhutanese work force (95 per
cent) is engaged in agriculture which con¬
tributed 54 per cent to Bhutan's Gross Na¬
tional Product in 1979/80. Animal husbandry
is an integral part of farming activities and in
the alpine region forms virtually the sole
economic activity. There are only two urban
centres, including the capital Tnimpu, with
more than 20,000 inhabitants. Bhutan's abun¬
dant but as yet largely unexploited natural
resources consist principally of forestry
resources, hydroelectric energy potential
and certain mineral deposits. The average
life expectancy is 46 years and the rate of in¬
fant mortality is high. The existing health
care system is weak (one doctor per 20,000
inhabitants, 12 general hospitals, about 80
dispensaries and three leprosy centres). The
two principal constraints hampering ac¬
tivities in all sectors are the shortage of train¬
ed and skilled manpower and the lack of ade¬
quate financial resources. The illiteracy rate
is estimated at 78 per cent. Industry in
Bhutan is still at the infant stage accounting
for about 6 per cent of Gross National Pro¬
duct.
5. The Republic
of Botswana
BOTSWANA is a land-locked country in
the centre of the Southern African
plateau. Its area is about 582,000 sq.
km. Two-thirds of the country is desert. It is
estimated that less than 5 per cent of the sur¬
face is arable. On the other hand, much of
the land is suitable for cattle grazing. The de
jure population is estimated at 884,000; of
these about 55,000 are absentees, mostly
males employed in South Africa. The de fac¬
to population (persons resident in Botswana,
whether citizens or not) is estimated at
849,000. The annual rate of population
growth is about 3 per cent. About half the
population is under age 15. According to the
1971 census, the infant mortality rate was 97
per 1,000, and 152 per 1.000 did not survive to
the age of 5. Life expectancy at birth was
then 52.5 years for men and 58.6 for women.
It is thought that since 1971 infant mortality
has been reduced thanks to better health
care. Because of lack of educational oppor¬
tunities in the past, most of the adult popula¬
tion of Botswana is illiterate. The majority of
the children however now have access to
primary education. It is estimated that about
three-fifths of the country's labour force (i.e.
about 250,000 persons) depend mainly on
subsistence agriculture and on informal ac¬
tivities for a livelihood. Botswana produces
no petroleum or natural gas and has no
hydroelectric potential. The majority of the
people use wood for heating and candles or
paraffin for light. It is hoped to exploit the
country's almost unlimited coal resources
and to lessen its dependence on expensive
imported petroleum products.
6. The Republic
of Burundi
B
,URUNDI forms part of the lakes region
of East Africa. It has a gross surface
area of 27,834 sq. km., the waters of
Lake Tanganyika accounting for
2,000 sq. km. In 1979, total population was
just over 4 million. About 95 per cent of the
people live in rural areas, the towns of Bu¬
jumbura and Gitega being virtually the only
built-up areas. Life expectancy at birth is 45
years and the infant mortality rate is 138 per
thousand. The climate is favourable to
agriculture and two or three harvests per an¬
num can be brought in depending on the
crop and the area concerned, so the
country's effective agricultural area is
probably doubled. However, strong
demographic pressure and the system of
land cultivation are causing the soil and
vegetation to deteriorate rapidly. In 1979,
four crops coffee, cotton, tea and cinchona
accounted for the bulk of the total value of
Burundi's exports. Lake Tanganyika yields
an annual fish catch of about 20,000 tonnes.
The manufacturing sector (textiles,
footwear, cigarettes, etc.) is scheduled to
achieve an annual growth rate of 11 per cent
between 1981 and 1985 and a similar growth
rate is forecast for the mining and energy
sectors. Despite progress made in recent
years the health situation remains
precarious; the doctor/inhabitant ratio is
1:34,000 and there is one hospital bed per 286
inhabitants. In 1977/78 the number of pupils
attending State primary schools was slightly
above 142,000 (23 per cent of the age group
concerned); a further 45 per cent were atten¬
ding private schools and literacy centres.
The literacy rate was 25 per cent in 1978.
18

7. The Republic
of Cape Verde
GAPE Verde consists of ten islands and
three islets with a total land surface
area of about 4,000 sq. km and a
population estimated at a little less than
300,000. The terrain of most of the islands is
rugged. Owing to prolonged drought and to
food shortages, many Cape Verdeans have
emigrated. It is estimated that the number of
emigrants is about equal to the number of
residents. The almost total lack of an
economic and social infrastructure, and the
ravages caused by progressive desertifica¬
tion have contributed to the present state of
the country's underdevelopment, ag¬
gravated by the small size of the internal
market and the decline of the output of sub¬
sistence agriculture and animal husbandry in
recent years. The country is dependent
essentially on external financial assistance,
food aid, commodity aid and remittances of
emigrants to cover the difference between
Gross Domestic Product and total expen¬
diture (the "gap" is estimated at more than
50 per cent). Industrial activity accounts for
about 10 per cent of GDP and employs about
3 per cent of the labour force. More than half
the population depends on agriculture for a
meagre livelihood. The illiteracy rate is about
50 per cent and the health situation is
precarious, as exemplified by an infant mor¬
tality rate of close to 100 per 1,000 and by a
doctor:population rate of about 1:5,800.
Technical and vocational training facilities
are insufficient but the educational stan¬
dards are expected to improve as almost all
children of school age (7-14 years) now at¬
tend school.
8. The Central African
Republic
THE Central African Republic is a land¬
locked country with a surface area of
about 623,000 sq. km. and a population
estimated (in 1980) at about 2,334,000, of
whom over 40 per cent are under 15. The rate
of population growth is estimated at 2.5 per
cent per annum. The illiteracy rate was
estimated (in 1962 by the World Bank) to be
in excess of 90 per cent. The general mortali¬
ty rate is estimated at 250 per 1,000, the in¬
fant mortality rate at 130 per 1,000. All im¬
ports and exports have to be carried over
long distances by road and rail from and to
the seaports of neighbouring transit coun¬
tries (e.g., the distance from Bangui to
Douala is about 1,530 km). About 80 per cent
of the population depends on agriculture for
its livelihood. Less than 2 per cent of the
country's surface area is cultivated; about 10
per cent is used by nomadic population
groups for cattle raising; and dense forest
accounts for about 5 per cent. In 1980 exports
amounted to about $100 million, imports to
about $180 million. The doctor.-population
ratio is about 1:27,500. The diet, particularly
of vulnerable groups such as pregnant
women and children, is insufficient and un¬
balanced. The rate of school enrolment is
about 47 per cent of children of school age.
According to preliminary geological surveys,
the Republic possesses large mineral
resources but as yet these have not been
thoroughly explored or evaluated. It also
possesses a great though as yet largely
unexploited potential of hydro-electric
power, thanks to its numerous water
courses which could be harnessed to
generate electricity.
9. The Federal and Islamic
Republic of the Comoros
TIE islands that constitute the Republic
of the Comoros have a surface area of
about 2,240 square kilometres and a
population of about 400,000. Population den¬
sity is very high, averaging 190 persons per
square kilometre. The islands are of volcanic
origin, the coasts are rocky and there is prac¬
tically no natural harbour. On the island of
Grande Comore there are no year-round
rivers or streams and the island is dependent
on rainwater stored in tanks and reservoirs.
Agriculture accounts for about 40 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product and for virtually all
export earnings. Export crops include
vanilla, cloves, coconuts and ylang ylang (an
important ingredient for perfumes). Forest
resources have been seriously depleted and
now cover only about 20,000 hectares. The
fish catch is estimated at about 3,000 tonnes
annually, but the potential fisheries
resources are much greater. At present
fishing is carried on by traditional methods.
Non-agricultural production plays only a
minor part in the national economy and
tourism is still in its infancy. The health situa¬
tion is distressing. The rate of infant mortali¬
ty is about 20 per cent and life expectancy is
41 years for men and 44 years for women The
diet of the inhabitants is short of calories and
protein. There are three hospitals with about
500 beds. The country has 28 doctors. Nearly
all children between the ages of 5 and 7 at¬
tend the Koranic schools. About 63 per cent
of children of school age are enrolled in
primary schools, which are modelled on the
French system. The teaching staff is to a
large extent underqualified.
19

10. Ethiopia 11. The Republic
of the Gambia
12. The Revolutionary
People's Republic
of Guinea
ETHIOPIA has a total land area of
1,223,600 square kilometres comprising
a central highland mass surrounded by
lowlands. Population was estimated to be 31
million in 1980. Ethiopia is a land of young
people with about 54 per cent of the popula¬
tion being below 20 years of age. There is a
low standard of nutrition, inadequate access
to clean water, widespread disease and a
high infant mortality rate. Agriculture is bas¬
ed on small-holder production which makes
extensive use of the land. The main food
crops are cereals, pulses and oilseeds. The
main cash crops are coffee (Ethiopia is the
largest Arabica coffee producer in Africa
with an annual output of 200,000 tonnes),
oilseeds, cotton, sisal, tobacco, fruit, pepper
and sugar cane. Ethiopia is first in Africa and
tenth in the world in the size of its livestock
resources: 70 million cattle, sheep and goats
and about 8 million horses, mules, donkeys,
camels, etc. The manufacturing sector plays
an important role in supplying consumer
goods to the domestic market and absorbing
agricultural raw materials. Food processing
accounts for 30 per cent of manufacturing
production, textiles for 25 per cent and
beverages for 12 per cent. The remainder
comprises tobacco, leather and footwear,
wood, chemicals and construction
materials. The post-revolutionary period has
witnessed a great expansion in health ser¬
vices which now reach a significant propor¬
tion of the population. There has also been
notable progress in education with more
than 1.8 million children enrolled in primary
schools in 1979/80. During the Mass Literacy
Campaign, nearly seven million adults were
covered by courses in basic literacy.
THE Gambia covers some 10,360 sq. km.
forming a narrow strip of 350 km.
entirely surrounded by Senegal and
bordered on the west by the Atlantic. It is
one of the Sahelian countries and suffers
from frequent droughts. The population was
estimated (June 1980) at 603.000 and is pro¬
jected to reach 1 million by the year 2000. The
urban population accounts for about a
quarter of the total and is concentrated in
and around the capital Banjul. Among the ef¬
fects of migration from the countryside are a
shortage of housing, inadequate urban ser¬
vices and increased unemployment. Health
and sanitary conditions are among the
poorest in West Africa, especially in the rural
areas. It has been estimated that 62 per cent
of the rural population has to walk more than
10 km. to reach the nearest health care facili¬
ty. The national literacy rate is 10 per cent,
and is lower in rural areas. According to the
Gambian 1973 census (the latest available)
average life expectancy was 36.1 years. In¬
fant mortality ¡s 217 per 1,000 and 30 per cent
of children die before the age of 2. The
average calorie intake is only 80-90 per cent
of the "minimum" required level.
GUINEA, which is situated in the south¬
western part of West Africa, has a
population of 6.4 million (1980) and
an area of 246,000 sq. km. The rate of school
enrolment, which was about 15 per cent at
independence in 1958, was raised to 70 per
cent in 1979. A mass literacy campaign was
launched in 1968, and functional literacy has
been achieved throughout the country in
eight national languages. The crude death
rate fell from 27.7 per thousand in 1960 to
20.7 per thousand in 1980, while life expec¬
tancy during the same period rose from 36 to
43.5 years. However, the general mortality
rate was 20.7 per thousand in 1977 and the
infant mortality rate 156 per thousand. With
its land, climatic and water resources, Gui¬
nea has a high potential tor agricultural deve¬
lopment. Cultivated land is estimated at
about 1.1 million hectares, of which 76 per
cent is used for crop rotation. The country
has a considerable timber potential for all
purposes. Bauxite reserves are estimated at
12 billion tons, or two thirds of world resour¬
ces. Iron ore deposits are currently estima¬
ted at 15 billion tons. Prospecting has revea¬
led substantial uranium shows and deposits
are estimated at more than 5 million tons.
Hydroelectic resources are extensive and as

13. The Republic
of Guinea-Bissau
14. The Republic of Haiti 15. Lao People's
Democratic Republic
GUINEA-Bissau is situated on the west
coast of Africa, south of Senegal.
Its surface area is about 36,000 sq. km.
of which about 8,000 consists of rivers and
swamps. The population is about 800,000
(1979) of whom about 87 per cent live in
about 3,600 villages in the interior. The birth
rate is fairly high (average family size: 6.3
persons), but the Infant mortality rate is very
high owing to poor health care (about one
hospital bed per 600 persons, a low doctor-
population ratio (about 1:10,000), endemic
diseases, deficient diet and inadequate
supply of safe water. The principal economic
activity is agriculture, which has recently
suffered from drought for three successive
years. The literacy rate is barely 15 per cent.
Of the active labour force of about 450,000,
only about 25,000 are wage earners; the bulk
of the labour force being engaged in the sub¬
sistence economy. The agricultural sector,
which employs almost 90 per cent of the
labour force, accounted for only about 40 per
cent of the Gross Domestic Product, owing
to low yield and low productivity. The
country's food deficit in 1979 amounted to
about 20,000 tons of cereals, 3,000 tons of
sugar, 800 tons of edible oils, 200 tons of
milk.
HAITI has a surface area of about
27,500 sq. km. and a population of
rather more than 5 million, of whom
about 3,630,000 live in rural areas. Three-
quarters of the territory is mountainous, and
large tracts of the plains consist of infertile
land. The principal cause of the impoverish¬
ment of the soil is excessive exploitation of
the forest resources by the growing popula¬
tion in search of fuel wood and timber,
which has led to an erosion of the land and to
a water shortage of well-nigh disastrous pro¬
portions. The consequential ecological
damage has had a most serious effect on
agriculture. The population is growing at an
annual rate of about 1.8 per cent. Average
life expectancy is about 52 years; the infant
mortality is very high at about 150 per thou¬
sand. The Gross Domestic Product grew at
an average rate of 2.7 per cent between 1970
and 1980. Economic and social progress is
hampered, however, by the stagnant
agriculture, on which 80 per cent of the
population depends for a livelihood, and by
the chronically adverse balance of
payments. There is widespread unemploy¬
ment and underemployment, and the coun¬
try suffers from a maldistribution of incomes
and inter-sectoral and interregional im¬
balances.
THE Lao People's Democratic Republic,
established in 1975, is a land-locked
country with a surface area of about
237,000 sq. km. and a population estimated
at 3.75 million. The labour force is about 1.6
million. The infant mortality rate is about 200
per 1,000 and life expectancy at birth was
estimated In 1972 at 50 years. There is one
doctor per 31,000 inhabitants and one
hospital bed per 458 inhabitants. The
agricultural sector employs 80 per cent of the
population and accounts for about two
thirds of Gross Domestic Product, The prin¬
cipal crops are rice, cotton, coffee, tobacco,
vegetables and maize. The country's prin¬
cipal natural resource and export commodity
is the timber from the vast forest area. The
country's potential hydroelectric resources
and mineral deposits known or thought to
exist are as yet largely unexploited or even
unexplored. At the moment, the only mineral
deposits worked commercially are those of
tin and gypsum. The constraints affecting
the country's development are mainly: Its
land-locked situation, the low density of the
population, the inadequate infrastructure of
roads, communications and means of
transport and the country's vulnerability to
natural disasters. The development task is
hampered by the loss of lives and property
and the destruction of large areas (almost 40
per cent) of the cultivable land during the
long period of war, when more than a
quarter of the population became refugees,
and by the consequences of natural disasters
(drought in 1977 and floods in 1978).

16. The Kingdom
of Lesotho
LESOTHO is a small, land-locked country
entirely surrounded by one econo¬
mically more advanced and dominant
neighbour. South Africa. It constitutes a
very limited market and has a restricted
resource base. The total de jure population
(1976 census) was 1,216,816; the resident
population was 1,064,162, with 152,654 na¬
tionals employed in South Africa. The vital
role played by migrant labour in Lesotho's
economy can be assessed from the fact that
in 1977/78 migrants remitted some $156
million to Lesotho, an amount almost equal
to the income generated from domestic ac¬
tivities. Only 13 per cent of the total land area
is suitable for crop cultivation. However,
agriculture is the most important economic
sector in Lesotho. Together with mining
employment in South Africa it provides the
main source of Income for about 90 per cent
of the population. The country has a com¬
paratively high rate of literacy: about 60 per
cent of the population have attended school,
and around 57 per cent aged 10 and over have
had at least 3 years of primary education. On¬
ly about 10 per cent of the population have
access to piped water. Lesotho's socio¬
economic problems are largely a result of the
country's geopolitical position. The country
being a labour pool for the mines and in¬
dustries of South Africa, little effort was
made prior to independence (1966) to
develop Lesotho's infrastructure.
17. The Republic
of Malawi
MALAWI, a land-locked country,
occupies a narrow strip of land and
lakes totalling 118,500 sq. km. bor¬
dered by Mozambique, Zambia and Tan¬
zania. It has a total population of some 6
million people. Average life expectancy is 42
years. Infant mortality is 130 per thousand
but is higher in rural areas. Health services
are free, but facilities are old and in need of
improvement and extension. Population per
physician is 50,000. About 36 per cent of the
adult population are literate. Primary school
enrolment is 60 per cent of the relevant age
group and secondary school enrolment 4 per
cent of the 14-18 age group. The main
agricultural crops are maize, groundnuts and
cassava (grown mainly for subsistence), and
tobacco, tea, sugar and cotton produced for
export on large commercial estates. Known
mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite,
apatite and uranium have not yet proved to
be economically exploitable. Possibilities for
the development of these and other minerals
as yet undiscovered are being studied.
18. The Republic
of Maldives
THE Republic of Maldives consists of an
archipelago of nearly 1,200 islands in
the Indian Ocean. Most of the islands
are tiny, none larger than five square
kilometres. Only two (including Male, the
capital) have a population of more than
5,000. The total population is estimated at
153,000. Life expectancy at birth is estimated
at 46.5 years. The adult literacy rate is at least
70 per cent, this relatively high figure being
accounted for largely by schooling at
Koranic schools. Health and hygiene condi¬
tions are poor; the drinking water supply is
inadequate, and communicable diseases and
malnutrition are widespread. There is no
regular inter-island transport. Agriculture is
very much a subsidiary activity in the Maldi-
vian economy, accounting for about one
tenth of employment. Fishing, followed by
tourism and shipping, is the principal oc¬
cupation of Maldivians, and the sale of fish
to foreign buyers is an important source of
export earnings. The manufacture of coir
products is the leading industry not based on
maritime resources. There are also some'
small-scale artisan and cottage industries.
The high economic growth rates (10-12 per
cent annually) achieved by the Maldives in
recent years are attributable to tourism, to
mechanization of the fishing industry, to the
operations of the merchant shipping fleet,
and to the growth of the capital, Male. The
single most important impediment to the
development of the Maldives is the lack of
trained manpower. Although the level of
literacy is high, the level of educational at¬
tainment of the population as a whole is low;
in 1977, only 20 per cent of the population
had attained the standard of primary
education.
22

19. The Republic of Mali
20. The Kingdom
of Nepal
21. The Republic
of the Niger
MALI is a semi-arid land-locked
African country with a surface
area of about 1,240,000 sq. km.
between the Sahara and the Sudano-
Sahelian belt. It is estimated that the popula¬
tion (average annual growth rate about 2.5
per cent) will reach or exceed 7 million in
1981. Over 83 per cent of the population live
in rural areas. Over 80 per cent are under 40,
over 44 per cent under 15 (1976 figures).
These statistics of a very youthful nation
contrast with the grim mortality rates: overa
quarter of the children born in rural areas
died before age 5. An estimated 3 per cent of
the population suffers from such serious
diseases as leprosy, trypanosomiasis, tuber¬
culosis and river blindness. Average life ex¬
pectancy is about 38 years. In 1975 the
literacy rate was estimated at 10 per cent. As
regards resources of trained manpower,
graduates with academic training are look¬
ing for work, whereas there are unfilled job
vacancies for people with specific technical
and practical skills. Mali actually exports
highly qualified manpower and at the same
time is short of personnel for the execution
of large projects and its health and educa¬
tional services. Health services are insuffi¬
cient. In 1976 there were only 212 medical
practitioners, one for every 4,000 persons in
the capital Bamako, but only one for every
56,000 or so elswhere. The value of exports
was estimated at $99 million for 1979. Im¬
ports amounted to about $234 million. The
import bill was aggravated by the high cost
of petroleum products and of transport and
by the effects of successive droughts which
cut domestic production of foodstuffs and
necessitated heavy imports of these essen¬
tial commodities. Mali possesses con¬
siderable mineral resources, some of which
are being exploited: gold, phosphate, gyp¬
sum, bauxite, iron ore, manganese ore.
NEPAL is a land-locked country in the
Himalayan region, with a land area
of about 141,000 sq. km. and a popu¬
lation estimated at 14.3 million. The moun¬
tain region (altitude 5,000 to 8,000 metres)
constitutes about one third of the territory,
the hill region (altitude 1,000 to 5,000 metres)
45 per cent, and the fertile tropical Terai plain
for the remainder. The literacy rate is about
24 per cent. Agriculture, including animal
husbandry, supplies about 80 per cent of ex¬
ports, provides half the raw materials for in¬
dustry and contributes about 60 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product. Industry is as yet
in the infant stage of development employ¬
ing fewer than 60,000 people. In addition
there are about 750,000 cottage industry
units employing over a million people.
Tourism has expanded greatly in recent
years. Health conditions in Nepal are among
the poorest in the world. Infant mortality
rates are very high; the doctor/population
ratio is about 1:39,000; the average calorie in¬
take is below the recommended minimum.
Since 1950 a community health system has
been created and malaria in the Terai has
been almost eradicated. Life expectancy at
birth is estimated at 43 years. In 1979/80, over
a million children were enrolled in 10,000
primary schools, staffed by 27,000 teachers.
Secondary school enrolment stood at
500,000, and over 39,000 students were enroll¬
ed in centres of higher learning.
THE Republic of the Niger is a land¬
locked country in the Sahelian region;
the nearest point to the sea is 760 km.
from the port of Cotonou. The country's
total surface area is about 1,267,000 sq. km.,
with a population of about 5.1 million (1977).
About 90 per cent of the population live in
rural communities, including a nomadic
population estimated at about 740,000. The
birth rate is estimated at 52 per thousand, the
infant mortality rate 200 per thousand, and
the child mortality rate (children under the
age of 5) 500 per thousand. At present, only
about 30 per cent of the country's rural set¬
tlements are adequately supplied with
water. In the last 5 years the economy has
experienced strong growth. The recent
drought severely affected the cultivation of
groundnuts, but the country's agricultural
production still satisfies about 75 per cent of
the population's food needs. The principal
exports are uranium, livestock, niebé (a local
bean), hides and skins, edible oils and cot¬
ton. Imports consist of a vast range of con¬
sumer and capital goods and petroleum pro¬
ducts. The balance of trade is chronically in
deficit. The country's natural endowment,
on which its future development depends,
are the land, water and mineral wealth. Of
the 15 million hectares of cultivable land, on¬
ly about a fifth is at present cultivated. The
mineral wealth consists of deposits of
uranium, coal, phosphate, limestone, iron
ore, molybdenum, manganese, lithium,
cassiterite and other ores.The Niger's output
of uranium accounts for about 10 per cent of
the world output.
23

22. The Republic
of Uganda
UGANDA, with a total area of some
241,000 sq. km. suffers from the
double disadvantage of being both
a least developed and a land-locked coun¬
try its major outlet to the sea is the Port of
Mombasa in Kenya, about 1,280 km. from
the capital, Kampala. In 1980 Uganda had a
population of 12.6 million. Some 90 per cent
of the population live in rural areas.
Uganda's economy is predominantly
agricultural. Over 80 per cent of the rural
population depend on agriculture for in¬
come. Over the years, Uganda's export trade
has been dominated by coffee exports, in
particular robusta coffee. Exports of cotton,
tea, tobacco, blister copper, hides and skins,
and cotton fabrics began to fall by the
mid-1970s. Tea exports declined from an
average of 16,000 tons over the period
1970-1972 to a mere 1,000 tons in 1979. Sugar
exports were reduced to negligible quan¬
tities and even the domestic market supply
faced shortages. Uganda's economy is today
experiencing deep-seated economic and
social problems. The productive base in the
agricultural, livestock, industrial and mining
sectors has been destroyed. There are acute
shortages of consumer goods and produc¬
tion inputs and as a result inflation is in the
four-digit range. The basic social services in
the health, education housing and water
supply sectors are functioning only on a
skeleton basis.
23. The Rwandese
Republic
RWANDA is a completely land-locked
country situated at the point where
Central Africa and East Africa meet,
at the centre of the region of the great lakes
and volcanoes. It occupies a land area of
26,338 square kilometres and is an essentially
mountainous country. In August 1978 total
population stood at 4.8 million, with 47.5 per
cent under the age of 15. In the health field,
the doctor:inhabitant ratio is 1:28,700 and
there is one hospital bed per 711 inhabitants.
Primary school enrolment in 1978/79
amounted to 515,700 pupils and 2.3 per cent
of pupils leaving primary school went on to
post-primary education. The development of
the agricultural sector, in which 93 per cent
of Rwandese are engaged, is being
frustrated by the growing scarcity of land
and severe soil degradation. About 60 per
cent of farming families have holdings of
less than one hectare and the quality of the
land varies widely. Export earnings from
agriculture are limited with coffee as the
main ingredient. Rwanda's other natural
resources (mining and quarrying) are also
limited. The mining industry accounted for 3
per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1978.
Production is scattered throughout the
country. The principal products are
cassiterite and ferberite.
24. The Independent
State of
Western Samoa
SAMOA is an island country in the South
Pacific which attained independence
in 1962. It consists of seven islands
with a total land area of about 2,850 square
kilometres and a total population of about
161,000. roughly half of which is under the
age of 20. About three-quarters of the
population live on Upolu island and most of
the remainder on Savaii island. Subsistence
agriculture is the principal occupation. Ex¬
port crops are copra, cocoa and taro. In addi¬
tion there are large forestry resources. The
manufacturing sector, which accounts for
only a small share of Gross Domestic Pro¬
duct, comprises some medium-size plants
that produce beer, cigarettes, animal feed
and matches. Life expectancy at birth is
about 63 years; infant mortality is about 37
per 1,000. The level of education is
reasonably good and literacy in the ver¬
nacular is almost universal. About 70 per
cent of children attend secondary school.
The Samoan economy suffers from a
number of handicaps: the country's isolation
and remoteness from the rest of the world;
lack of mineral resources; relatively small
fishing zone; heavy dependence on foreign
trade; vulnerability to fluctuations in world
prices of copra and cocoa; shortage of skill¬
ed manpower (emigration is estimated at
about 2,000 a year).

25. The Somalia
Democratic Republic
26. The Democratic
Republic of the Sudan
27. The United Republic
of Tanzania
SOMALIA is located in the Horn of Africa
and has a total land area of 638,000 sq.
km. The annual rainfall is meagre and
irregular, creating the constant threat of
drought. The economy of Somalia is at pre¬
sent heavily burdened by the influx of
refugees into the country as a result of the
Ogaden conflict and the drought in the sur¬
rounding areas. In addition to the normal
resident population there are at present
about 1.25 million refugees in camps and
800,000 more spread all over the country. The
present resident population is estimated at 5
million (excluding refugees). Of the total,
2.8 million are nomadic, 1.1 million settled
rural population, and 1.1 million live in urban
areas. Almost 47 per cent of the total popula¬
tion consists of children under the age of 15.
The infant mortality rate is 177 per 1,000 and
the overall life expectancy is 41 years. The il¬
literacy rate is estimated at 30 per cent.
Agricultural and allied activities are the oc¬
cupation of 80 per cent of the labour force
and generate 60 per cent of the Gross
Domestic Product. Livestock is Somalia's
most important renewable resource and
generates 75 per cent of export earnings. It is
estimated that there are 5.2 million camels
2.74 million head of cattle, 9.43 million sheep
and 15.12 million goats. The coastal waters
of the country have a substantial fishery
potential, but at present the fishing industry
is undeveloped.
THE Sudan, with a land area of 2.5 million
sq. km. is the largest country in Africa.
It has a population of only 18 million
and unlike the situation in most other least
developed countries population growth is
not excessive. Indeed, there is often a shor¬
tage of labour which is aggravated by the
emigration of skilled workers to the oil-rich
States in the region. Life expectancy at birth
is 46 years. Nearly 80 per cent of the adult
population is illiterate and about half the
children of school age do not enter primary
school. The Nile is the backbone of the coun¬
try. It links the northern and southern
regions, is an important source of hydroelec-
tricity and is vital to agriculture. Cotton is
the dominant cash crop and for a long time
provided 80 per cent of export earnings. Dur¬
ing the past decade efforts have been made
to achieve crop diversification and produc¬
tion of groundnuts, wheat, fruit and
vegetables has increased considerably.
Since only 10 per cent of available land is at
present under cultivation there is a vast
potential for agricultural expansion. Never¬
theless, even today agriculture, including
livestock, contributes about 40 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product and nearly 95 per
cent of exports. The contribution of the in¬
dustrial sector to the economy is modest, ac¬
counting for less than 6 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product. At present there are
some import-substituting industries produc¬
ing notably textiles, sugar, cement,
footwear, soft drinks and alcoholic
beverages. Heavy industry is currently con¬
fined to cçment manufacture and some
petroleum processing.
THE United Republic of Tanzania, with a
total area of some 945,000 sq. km. of
which 5.4 per cent is arable land and
under permanent crops, has a total popula¬
tion of around 17 million, growing by 3 per
cent per annum. The urban population ac¬
counts for 13 per cent of the total population.
Average life expectancy at birth was 51 years
and infant mortality was 150 per 1,000 live
births. All health services provided by
government health institutions are free of
charge. There are serious problems caused
by nutritional déficiences. Protein malnutri¬
tion causes about 50,000 deaths among pre¬
school children every year. In 1978
agriculture constituted 39.5 per cent of the
national income (industries 9.3 per cent and
infrastructure 11.5 per cent). After in¬
dependence (1961) the major focus of atten¬
tion in agriculture was placed on: (1) the pro¬
duction of food and export crops, and (2) the
integrated development of the rural areas
which support over 90 per cent of Tanzania's
population. This new policy was embodied in
the Arusha Declaration (1967) which provides
the fundamental basis for the country's
ideology of Ujamaa (i.e. familyhood based .
on the African traditional family life of living
and working together as a unit). By focuss¬
ing on staple food production Tanzania has
been able to avoid over-all food shortages
and limit reliance on food aid to serious
drought years. According to UN data Tan¬
zania was the third most seriously affected
country and lost about an eighth of its na¬
tional purchasing power during 1972-1976 in
terms of trade deterioration.

28. The Republic of Chad
29. The Republic
of Upper Volta
30. The Yemen
Arab Republic
No country presentation was received from
Chad and the following information, with
the exception of the figures for land area, is
taken from United Nations sources.
Land area: 1,284,000 square kilometres
Population: 4,400,000 (1979)
Life expectancy at birth: 43 years (1978)
Infant mortality rate: 160 per thousand (1978)
Adult literacy rate: 17.8 per cent (1980)
UPPER Volta is a land-locked African
country, far from any port (1,145 km.
to Abidjan by rail, 1,020 km. to Lomé
by road). It extends on either side of the
Mossi Plateau, a flat dome of rocks yielding
for the most part poor soils of low
permeability, poor in groundwater. The more
fertile and better watered Volta valleys form
a breeding ground for sandflies, vectors of
onchocerciasis (blindness) where human set¬
tlement has become possible only as a result
of campaigns to eradicate this disease. The
climate is hot and dry. The population in 1975
numbered 5,638,203 of whom 5,127,000 lived
in rural areas. The population is young, with
17.3 per cent aged between 0-4 and 24.9 per
cent between 5 and 14. Population pressures
result in massive emigration to the coastal
countries. Of the economically active
population, 91.8 per cent are employed in
agriculture. 3.5 per cent in industry, and 4.7
per cent in the tertiary sector. Wage earners
number 41,600. The main crops are food
crops. Less than 15 per cent is marketed, the
remainder being consumed by the pro¬
ducers. The illiteracy rate is 92.5 per cent.
Upper Volta has scarce energy resources
apart from wood, which supplies the
necessary energy for cooking meals but at
the cost of alarming deforestation.
THE Yemen Arab Republic has a land
area of about 195,000 sq. km. and is
located in the south-western part of
the Arabian Peninsula. In 1980 population
was estimated at 6.5 million. Life expectancy
at birth is 35.7 years for females and 38.3 for
males. Literacy barely exceeds 10 per cent.
Agriculture, in which 83 per cent of the
population is engaged, is still considered the
leading sector in the national economy, but
its relative importance has declined substan¬
tially in recent years to about 29 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product. Output consists
mainly of food grains and livestock pro¬
ducts. Between 1966 and 1981 the contribu¬
tion of manufacturing industry to Gross
Domestic Product was 5 per cent. Since 1962
new industries have been set up including
textiles, cement, oilseeds, cigarettes,
plastics, sweets and soft drinks. Approx¬
imately 20 per cent of the labour force
(600,000 people) are temporary emigrants to
the Gulf States and in particular to Saudi
Arabia. While their remittances have provid¬
ed a welcome boost to Yemen's balance of
payments, development projects in the
country are suffering from the resultant
shortage of manpower, both skilled and un¬
skilled. Other constraints to the develop¬
ment of Yemen include organizational and .
administrative problems, a low resource
base, the mountainous nature of the country
and scarcity of water resources.

31. The People's
Democratic
Republic of Yemen
DEMOCRATIC Yemen, which attained
independence in 1967, covers a land
area of about 337,000 sq. km. and has
a population estimated in 1980 at 1.9 million.
The country's principal resources, other than
human, are fisheries, the port of Aden, the
Aden oil refinery, and salt. Life expectancy
at birth is about 46 years; the infant mortality
rate is about 114 per 1,000. There are 1.1 doc¬
tors per 10,000 inhabitants. The illiteracy rate
is estimated at about 80 per cent. Agriculture
is limited to about 80,000 hectares (0.2 per
cent of the total land area), principally
because of the water shortage. The rainy
season is brief and unreliable. There is some
irrigation from underground water. The
pasture land is extensive but vegetation is
sparse. About 40 per cent of the labour force
is employed in the agricultural sector.
Livestock production accounts for about half
of the total value of the output of the
agricultural sector, but falls far short of
meeting the demand of consumption.
Thanks to a fairly long coastline (1,200
kilometres) Democratic Yemen possesses
substantial fish resources which are a major
source of export earnings. In addition to the
Aden oil refinery, the industrial sector covers
salt production, mining and quarrying, the
production of goods of agricultural origin
(foodstuffs, cigarettes, textiles, leather
goods) and some import-substitute in¬
dustries such as paints, matches, plastic pro¬
ducts, tiles, nails, etc.). The major con¬
straints hampering development are the
poor endowment of natural resources, the
adverse climate, the rugged terrain and the
shortage of technical and managerial skills.
