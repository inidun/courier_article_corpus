The five works reproduced on this
double page are among those shown at
an exhibition held in October 1986 to
mark Unesco's fortieth anniversary.
The exhibition, which was organized
by the International Association of
Art and held at Unesco's Paris
Headquarters, featured works created
for the occasion by forty artists from
forty countries. The catalogue has
now been published in the Unesco
Collection of Representative Works
under the title Unesco: 40 ans,
40 artistes, 40 pays ("Unesco: 40 years,
40 artists, 40 countries"; La
Bibliothèque des Arts, Paris/Unesco,
1988). Each work is an expression of a
distinctive cultural identity. As an
introductory text to the catalogue
points out, "The murmuring of
cultural waves and winds is crossing
the Americas, and rippling from Asia
to Africa, carrying echoes from
Europe and the wide Pacific. In the
late twentieth century nothing lies
outside the bounds of the artist's
curiosity, but at the same time
nothing can make the artist reject
what is dearest to him in his past
and present." ,
