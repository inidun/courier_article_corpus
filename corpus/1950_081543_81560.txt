THE SAUCEPAN
RADIO SHOWS
Â« A GOOD CHANCE
OF NEW LIFE"
by Gyril ERA Y
- w USAKA is a one-street Central-African town of
one-story buildings. One almost looks to see
the horsemen of a Western film gallop in
and hitch their horses to the rails outside the
store.
But overshadowing the one dusty street are the
towering radio masts that are the monument to an idea
- an idea that is already beginning to change the face
of the vast tropical territory of Northern Rhodesia and
to change the lives not only of its two million people
but of peoples in underdeveloped territories throughout
the world.
Northern Rhodesia is impoverished by soil erosion,
the present and future of its illiterate people threatened
and overshadowed by superstition, bad farming,
ignorance of the simplest principles of personal and
domestic hygiene.
How best to teach them the need for hard work and
for education, for water-conservation and better
hygiene, for the protection and care of pasture and
forests ?
Pamphlets and posters are useful-but not so useful
if only one African in every ten or so can read. More
and more African children are learning to read and
write, it is true, but how many years before a
completely literate generation has grown up ? And
what of the soil in the meantime ?
Chief Siamaundu of the Tonga tribe buys a"saucepan special"radio in a Rhodesian store.
Letters received by the Lusaka Broadcasting Station show that the average number of liste-
ners to each set is about ten. When it was suggested that"saucepan"owners should keep a
box for visitors to drop a penny in as a fund for battery renewal, the Africans replied :"This
is not according to our custom : it would shame us."
A semi-amateur radio
station had been set up at
Lusaka in 1941 to keep
Europeans and Africans
informed about the progress
of the war and to stimulate
their war effort. It was
found that the African,
unused to reading, was both
a readier talker and a better
listener than the European
- at home both at the
microphone ant at the
receiver. It was decided
that broadcasting to Africans
must not only survive the
wartime need but develop to
meet the post-war needs.
Hygiene, Husbandry
And Law
WHEN I toured Africaearly this year as one
of Unesco's field sur-
veyors to examine the needs
and the progress of the
various methods of mass
communication, I found the
Lusaka radio station broad-
casting in simple English
and in five African ver-
naculars, five hours a day,
to the native populations of
Northern Rhodesia, South-
ern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
Lusaka was putting out
pr'51'ammes of European
and African music, news,
plays and talks and dra-
matized feature programmes
on hygiene, husbandry and
the rule of law. The station
had a potential listening
public of five million people,
perhaps eighty or ninety per
cent of them illiterate,
spread over an area as big
as Western Europe, or as
the states of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, and
Texas put together.
But the best broadcasting
in the world is of no use to
a population that cannot
afford the means to listen.
An answer to this need
is the"sauce {Jan special..
- a radio receIver that will
stand up to a tropical
climate and to clumsy hand-
ling, that can be used miles
from electric current, repair
shops, and battery chargers,
and be sold at a price within
reach of a considerable
number of Africans.
In the Unesco survey of
broadcasting in Africa is a
technical description of a

listeners of whom more
than three hundred have
already written to Lusaka
to express their delight-
a high proportion, when it
is remembered how few of
the listeners are literate.
A Chief from the most
primitive part of the ter-
ritory wrote a letter expres-
sing his joy that his people
were learning from the radio
"care of children, education
of girls, sanitation, house-
wifery, improved methods
of agriculture and many
other things", adding that
"particularly do the people
in this District desire to
hear more about care of
dams and how water can be
usefully reserved".
"1 feel proud", wrote
Mwitwa Amisi,.. when I
switch on my set and have
the whole world in my
house".
But it was perhaps John
Somati who best summed up
what the cheap radio set
can do for a simple and
primitive people when he
sat down in his wattle-and-
daub hut, under the palm-
trees, and laboriously wrote
down,"This wireless set
doing more than cost, thel'C-
fore I seen we African we
have a good chance or new
life".
