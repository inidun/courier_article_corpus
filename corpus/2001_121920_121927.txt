lash back ten years,when dictator Siad Barre
fled the Somali capital hidden in a tank: l e f t
at the mercy of rival factions, Mogadishu fell
into violence and anarchy.Until the return of
a shaky transitional national government in
early 2001, it has endured without the shadow of a
r e g i m e, and yet…
It may be a ransacked, ravaged and divided city
where few public buildings still stand, but Mogadishu
does not live severed from the rest of the world. Fo u r
airline companies run by local entrepreneurs mainly
service Arab countries. More than 15 small Cessna
airplanes fly in daily from Ke n y a , carrying khat, t h e
narcotic leaves widely chewed in Somalia.
The natural port of El-Ma’an,about 30 kilometres
northeast of Mogadishu, employs more than 4,000
p e o p l e, while the telecommunications sector has
created some 3,000 jobs. G o a t s, sheep and camels are
shipped to Arabian countries, bringing in the hard
c u r r e n cy needed to import rice, s u g a r, cooking oil
and clothes.
I r o n i c a l l y, Bekara market in the city’s business
centre is one of the best stocked in East A f r i c a .
Children hawk over 20 newspapers, including half a
dozen poorly printed dailies rarely running more than
six pages. Crowds can be seen exchanging currencies,
both international and local.And money seems blind
to factional wars: north and south Mogadishu have
their own currencies,as does the breakaway Somaliland
R e p u b l i c, but all can be exchanged and converted.
Transactions are made orally and exchange rates set
according to the imports and exports of the day: w h e n
thousands of heads of livestock are exported against
d o l l a r s, the green note’s value automatically drops.
Once a thriving Indian Ocean port,Mogadishu has
renewed its former vocation to become a business
kingdom unrestrained by any government or

network and a one-million-strong diaspora that has
proven a lifeline for a country where a succession of

Money rules in M o g a d i s h u
How does a country live without a government for ten years? In the Somali capital,
self-made businessmen with the help of unsparing Islamic courts are trying to prove
that they have more might than the warlords
Shops offer the cheapest phone rates in Africa and airlines compete, a parodox of this stateless nation.

foreign-brokered negotiations has floundered more
than a dozen times in the past decade.
At the height of the civil war in the early 1990s,
when armed militia blocked travel while looting,
killing and raping, necessity proved once again to be
the mother of invention.Very high frequency (VHF)
radios left behind by the fleeing regime were seized by
enterprising youngsters, who helped inhabitants
contact their relatives elsewhere in the country.
From gunmen to battle wagons:
the price of security
As famine spread across this nation of pastoralists,
they set up the “ h a l a w a d ” remittance system,
permitting money to be transferred at six percent
interest from countries such as Ke n y a , E t h i o p i a ,
D j i b o u t i , Yemen and the United Arab Emirates. I n
1 9 9 5 , the doomed UN Restore Hope operation in
Somalia left behind state-of-the-art communication
f a c i l i t i e s. Since then, several telecommunication
companies have cropped up in the city,offering dollar-
a-minute phone calls—the cheapest rates in A f r i c a —
to just about anywhere in the world, along with fax and
e-mail facilities.
While insecurity and regular deadly skirmishes
have forced most investors to fle e, local businessmen
are doing their best to prove that they can call the
s h o t s. In the early days of the civil war, they hired
gunmen from their own clans for protection, t h e n
boosted their forces by creating large militias whom
they pay and feed.To travel across the city’s different
z o n e s, each under the control of rival factions, t h e y
jumped over clan barriers by pooling some of their
m o n e y.They equipped themselves
with battle wagons to carry their
commodities from the seaports to
the city centre. And they are just
about the only ones who created
j o b s, reducing the ranks of the
unemployed so readily recruited
by roving armed gangs.At the helm
of the city’s three FM radio stations,
they also have a hold over
i n f o r m a t i o n . Each station has its
own political agenda, but all have
proven valuable allies to NGOs,
who regularly use airtime to
broadcast messages on health and
other matters of daily survival.
More recently, this new business
elite has turned to another force
that has filled the law and order
vacuum over the past years:I s l a m i c
clerics and courts.According to one
of the capital’s leading
b u s i n e s s m e n , the cost of
maintaining security had become
such that “we had to change our
m e t h o d s.”Militiamen in the service
of Islamic courts have undoubtedly made the capital
a safer place, closing down dozens of checkpoints set
up by warring factions, cleaning the roads of garbage
and earning the trust of people traumatized by years
of violence. Each family contributes money—and if
they cannot afford to, a son—towards their
n e i g h b o u r h o o d ’s security.Businessmen have worked
on uniting the Islamic courts to create one giant

security organization for the capital.As such, S h a r i a
l a w, with its merciless treatment of crime, r o b b e r y
and adultery (sentences range from executions to
stoning and chopping of hands and legs), has been
introduced with little opposition. Only the warlords
who feel their influence undermined have lashed out
at the clerics, accusing them of bringing Islamic
fundamentalism into the land.
Security aside,Islamic groups have filled a political
and social void, from food distribution to healthcare.
Local organizations funded with money from Islamic
countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have
reopened some 30 schools in the capital following
the same syllabus as in the donor country. The 22
NGOs operating in the city—several of which are
run by women—have also become influential players.
These organizations played a critical role in
campaigning for the Djibouti-backed peace talks in
2000 (see box) that led to the election of a president
and 245 MPs, including 25 women,a record number in
the country’s political history, at a time when Islamic
law holds sway over growing numbers.
It is one of the many ironies in this city of 1.5
million where business, Islamic chiefs and NGOs
jostle to maintain an extremely fragile order. Wi l l
these groups continue to put their weight behind
reconciliation? Will the arrival of the new president
Abdiquassim Salad Hassam, a member of  the Hawiye,
M o g a d i s h u ’s dominant clan, lay arms to rest? All is far
from won. Riots over fake currency notes, f u e l
shortages and spiralling price hikes recently rocked the
business district. Several new government
representatives have been assassinated. R e f u g e e s
who have fled drought and war in other parts of the
country are crowded into makeshift huts and shell-
pocked government buildings.Electricity comes from
small generators, water from household tanks or
donkey-drawn carts.Although criticized for pillaging
the country’s natural resources and paying little heed
to the needy, the business community is anxious to take
a stand. It has already offered to bankroll the
demobilization of some 20,000 militia members—a
move that is, of course, good for business. ■
