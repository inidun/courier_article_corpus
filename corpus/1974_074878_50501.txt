Kathmandu's
ancient palace
where Nepal's kings
are crowned
First stage of a Unesco plan
for restoring the monuments
of the entire Kathmandu valley
by Raj Mukunda
IN Kathmandu on February 24, 1975,
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev will
be formally crowned King of Nepal in a
courtyard of, the ancient royal palace
of Hanuman Dhoka. Like generations
of their forefathers before them, the
Nepalese will flock to the capital from
all parts of the country to acclaim the
newly-crowned King. As the age-old
rituals are performed, and the King
is presented to the people, all Nepal's
religious, cultural, political and his-

palese history at Tribhuvan University in Kath¬
mandu, the capital of Nepal.
torical traditions will surge to life in
an outburst of jubilation and festivity.
While ancient Vedic hymns are
chanted, King Birendra will be anointed
and washed by Brahman priests.
Then, enthroned on a dais facing to the
east, he will be solemnly instated, as
Nepal's superb helmet-like crown,
encrusted with pearls, diamonds,
rubies and emeralds, and crested by
billowing bird of paradise feathers is
placed on his head.
As the young King leaves the palace,
to be borne on a towering elephant
through streets packed with his sub¬
jects, he will follow another ancient
custom. He will offer flowers and
coins to the Hindu and Buddhist
images. The Palace where the
coronation ceremony will take place
is called Hanuman Dhoka because the
image of the Hindu deity Hanuman is
standing on the main gate.
The ceremony in the courtyard of
the Hanuman Dhoka will mark Blren-
dra's religious consecration. On
coronation day he will become, in the
eyes of all the Nepalese, the incar¬
nation of the god Vishnu, the defender
of good order, as the main duty of the
King is to protect his country and his
countrymen.
This relationship will be expressed
symbolically In the palace courtyard,
where the King will sit on a throne
backed by a golden canopy carved in
the form of a nine-headed cobra,
representing Vishnu.
Hanuman Dhoka Palace is set in
the heart of Kathmandu, a city founded
in 723 and capital of Nepal since the
middle of the 18th century.

The Palace roofs rise tier upon tier
from Durbar Square. Inside there is
a whole bewildering network of irregu¬
larly connected courtyards, nestling
between pagodas, shrines, columns
and statues. They all form part of the
extensive and rambling Palace.
These buildings are of great beauty
and historical interest. But like
many Nepalese monuments they have
suffered harshly from the ravages of
time. They have been rocked by the
earthquakes which periodically hit the
Kathmandu valley one tower was
particularly shaken by an earthquake
in 1934 and now leans crazily to the
north. They are exposed to the annual
drenching of the monsoon. Much of
the delicately carved polychrome
woodwork which supports the roofs Is
rotten and in dire need of restoration.
Several years ago the Nepalese
government appealed to Unesco for
help in restoring and reconstructing
its great historical monuments. In
1968 a Unesco mission recommended
that certain parts of Kathmandu valley
should be designated as "historic
districts" and then in 1970 Unesco
declared that it was prepared to
initiate a programme for the conser¬
vation of temples and their environ¬
ment in this valley.
The first conservation programme to
be carried out by Unesco, in collabo¬
ration with the Nepalese government
and with the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme financing experts and
equipment, is a project to conserve
Hanuman Dhoka. The aim of the
project is not only to restore the
Palace but to train a conservation
team for work elsewhere in Nepal.
It was decided that the first stage
in the project should be the conserv¬
ation of "Nassal Chowk", the court¬
yard in which the coronation ceremony
takes place.
Each of the 14 big courtyards, or
chowks, in the Palace compound is
dedicated to a different divinity. For
instance the coronation courtyard is
dedicated to the god Nartesvara,
Nepal's "Lord of the Dance." Only
one courtyard is generally open to the
public. The rest are closed except
on the occasion of the great religious
festival known as "Durga Puja" (Durga
worship), which is celebrated every
autumn In Nepal. The Durga Puja is
as important a festival for all the

FOREST OF SCAFFOLDING surrounds two of the four
towers of Hanuman Dhoka palace (bottom of page) during
restoration work now in progress. Among the most
beautiful features of the palace are the carved wooden
polychrome struts (left) which support the overhanging
roofs. In the meticulous task of restoration (below),
Nepalese craftsmanship is being extensively used, and the
Hanuman Dhoka Conservation Project is helping to train a
team which will carry out restoration work on other
monuments in the Kathmandu valley.
E
k*j,- Nepalese as Christmas is for the
Christian world.
To the north of the main palace area
rise three tall stone pillars. On top
of two of them are bronze statues of
Nepalese kings; the third supports an
attendant lion. They guard the holy
Temple of Taleju.
The temple, which forms part of
Hanuman Dhoka Palace, is normally
open only to priests, but during Durga
Puja thousands of people climb the
long flights of stairs up to it to pay
homage to Durga. The private chapel
of many Kings of Nepal, Taleju
Temple is a massive three-roofed
structure. Each roof Is supported by
carved and gilded struts, which stand
out against a sombre dark red, brown
and black background. Bells hang
from the roofs and tremble gently in
the wind.
Hanuman Dhoka is also the scene of
Nepal's annual Indrajatra festival,
which lasts for eight days and, like
other religious festivals in Nepal, Is
celebrated by both Hindus and
Buddhists. On the first day a long
wooden pole is erected before
Hanuman Dhoka in order to propitiate
the god Indra. Then, against a back¬
ground of gilded pagodas, classical
12

dancers wearing ornately decorated
masks and headdresses gather in a
courtyard of the palace to celebrate
the visit of the god Indra.
Perhaps the most beautiful courtyard
in Hanuman Dhoka is that known as
"Lohan Chowk", which is enclosed by
the "House of Enjoyment" built by
the great 18th-century ruler Prithvi
Narayan, who united the kingdom of
Nepal. The House of Enjoyment, now
in an advanced state of disrepair,
contains some fine carvings and
architectural details. Unesco Is
helping In its restoration. It has been
proposed that it be used as a museum
of Nepalese history, art and archi¬
tecture.
Visitors to the Lohan courtyard are
invariably surprised by the towers
which rise at each corner. Each one
is built in a different style. One is a
majestic nine-storey construction, with
three overhanging roofs. Another has
a Bengali "elephant's ear" style roof.
A curious story surrounds the
construction of the four towers. When
planning his palace the King is said
to have asked four towns In his
kingdom to nominate their best builders
and architects, and each town in this
co-operative competition built a tower.
The tallest and most spectacular, the
nine-storey Bhasantpur Tower, was
built by Kathmandu itself. The three
others were named after the cities
which built them: Lalltpur (also known
as Patan), Bhaktapur (also known
as Bhadgaon), and Kirtipur. Each
tower looks out across the valley to
the town which built it. All four are
now to be restored with Unesco's help
as part of the Hanuman Dhoka Con¬
servation Project.
Almost 100 feet high, Bhasantpur
tower's nine storeys are connected by
steep, narrow staircases, and on each
storey there is a heavy trapdoor which
can be bolted from above. From its
balconies one commands the view
once enjoyed by the monarchs of
Nepal, who came to sit there in
cushioned splendour to survey their
kingdom. Durbar Square below teems
with market traders; behind rise the
tiered roofs of the Palace. The whole
of the interior of this tower will be
renovated as part of the current
programme.
The restoration of Hanuman Dhoka
is only the first stage in the collabo¬
ration between the Nepalese Govern¬
ment and Unesco. Unesco has already
surveyed the principal monuments
of the entire Kathmandu Valley (see
article page 17). In this way the
rich cultural and artistic heritage of
Nepal, the cross-roads of two great
Asiatic civilizations, will be saved.
Raj Mukunda
This five-roofed pagoda dominates the courtyards of
Hanuman Dhoka Palace with its striking circular roofs.
It stands in the eastern part of the palace, near one of
Kathmandu's largest temples, which is so sacred that
it is closed except for the annual celebrations in honour
of its patron goddess, Durga.
