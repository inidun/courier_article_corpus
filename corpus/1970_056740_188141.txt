EDUCATION PUT
TO THE QUESTION
IT is two hundred years
since Rousseau wrote Em;7e in which
he expressed his stupefaction at the
way men were educated in the mid-
eighteenth century. Was it really
necessary for human beings to adapt
themselves to the educational system?
Would it not be better for the system
to be adapted to the needs of men?
The fundamental question was clearly
stated.
Regularly since then, for each
succeeding generation, the relationship
between education and life has been
the subject of studies, dissertations

tinuing Education Section of Unesco's
Department for the Advancement of Edu¬
cation. He has written numerous studies
and articles on adult education and perma¬
nent education, and is the author of "Edu¬

and experiments. The list of protests,
proposals and projects is endless.
After Jean-Jacques Rousseau came
Jean-Henri Pestalozzi in Switzerland,
Friedrich Froebel in Germany, Bertrand
Russell in England, John Dewey in
the United States, Célestin Freinet in
France, Anton Makarenko in the
Soviet Union, Maria Montessori in
Italy, and dozens of other pioneers
of educational reform.
Nor should we forget all those
philosophers whose first concern also
was the education and development
of man. If we read again the writings
of Friedrich Hegel, Auguste Comte or
Friedrich Nietzsche, we find on every
page a reference to this same preoccu¬
pation how can man, through his
experiences, his thought processes
and his relationships with others,
develop his personality, strive con¬
stantly to improve himself and achieve
real, untrammelled, tangible self-
liberation.
It is true that we have an over¬
abundance of ideological material at
our disposal. But it is evident that
educational theory has only a very
tenuous link with educational practice.
The traditional structures have con¬
stantly exercised a passive, sometimes
even an active, resistance to a trans¬
formation of the educational process
in the interests of both the individual
and society.
Of all human undertakings it
would appear that education is the
one that encounters the greatest
obstacles in the path of progress.
For years institutions known for their
conservatism, such as Churches and
Armies, have been in the throes of
a thorough evolution. National defence
is no longer assured- in the barracks,
but in the laboratories of the scientists.
In Rome, at the very moment when
bishops from all over the world are
discussing with the Pope the nature
of ecclesiastical power, humble priests

EDUCATION PUT TO THE QUESTION (Continued)
The battle between traditional forces and innovation
have joined the ranks of the protesters
and are claiming the right to a share
in decision-making.
Until recently no such evolution has
been apparent in the world of educa¬
tion, at least in the education of
young children and adolescents. It
is true that teaching as practised today
in most advanced countries has made
some progress as compared with the
situation pictured in the biting analyses
and sombre descriptions of Charles
Dickens or Jules Vallès.
Children are no longer whipped.
Their intellects are no longer system¬
atically dulled. They are no longer
obliged to learn by heart the tribut¬
aries of the Rhine or the Thames.
The general moral standard has
progressed and the shock-waves of
a number of decisive advances in
our civilization have been felt in
education.
Generally speaking the integrity of
the child of today, at least physically,
is respected. Up to a certain point
syllabuses and methods have become
more enlightened. But the greater part
remains unaffected.
The means at the disposal of society
for the instruction and training of
future citizens the school and the
university retain the same character¬
istics generation after generation: only
occasional relevance to ordinary life,
lack of awareness of concrete reality,
a divorce between pleasure and learn¬
ing and absence of dialogue and
participation.
I

he obstacles in the path of
change are well known. Some even
have considerable justification. There
is a handing down process in educa¬
tion that cannot be ignored. How, other
than through teaching, can the present
generation be linked with its pred¬
ecessors?
It is quite normal and inevitable
that the past, both that of mankind
in general and of each separate
society, should occupy a position of
honour in any body of teaching. It
is a public treasure store and we are
only too well aware of the feeling of
deprivation experienced by those
whose access to their cultural heritage
has been limited.
But this "tradition", precious though
it may be, becomes an obstacle when
it is not allied to a, forward-looking
view of life and when it becomes an
alibi and a pretext for a refusal to give
rein to the interplay of vital currents of
thought. In fact, the whole system,
as now constituted and operated,
produces the obstacle.
Compulsory education, the good
grounds for which no one would
dispute, paralyses innovation. Why
change? Why try to do better? Why
seek for formulae that meet the needs
of evolving man better, when automat¬
ically each year our schools receive
their quota of pupils? The law of
supply and demand, which gives im¬
pulse to progress, does not apply here.
Nor does the teaching profession,
recruited and formed as it now is,
greatly favour an imaginative or invent¬
ive spirit. By very reason of his
profession the teacher, at whatever
level, is never a participant in a
dialogue. He does not have to justify
himself to his equals, but passes, by
way of the examination system from
the statu pupillari to one of full
authority.
Is there any other position in the
world that entails the same concen¬
tration of powers as are in a teacher's
hands? He instructs, he moulds, he
has the advantage of age and know¬
ledge. By definition he is always right.
He is both jury and judge against whom
there is virtually no appeal. He it is
who apportions blame, punishment and
reward.
But, as we are well aware, this is
not the way in which a man becomes
truly adult and achieves his true
fulfilment. If wisdom and the under¬
standing of men and of real-life
situations penetrate at all into this
enclosed little world, it is because,
fortunately, some teachers escape and
make contact with the outside world in
which they face resistance from men
and things the world of politics, art,
community life and of adult education.
For their part, the legal and institut¬
ional authorities' interests are not
served by change nor do they desire
it. What these institutions, whether
the family or the State, are aiming
at through education is the turning out
of men who conform.
Most of the school or university
systems existing today are perfected
instruments for the production of the
type of individual who accepts as
revealed truth the myths and terms of
reference of society. What these
authorities, whoever they may be, fear
is the questioning spirit.
It is this spirit that produces the
independent son, the democratically-
minded citizen, in short, the adult
human being who, by definition, is far
from docile, difficult to indoctrinate and
capable of relying on his own judge¬
ment for vital choices and decisions.
In these circumstances it is easy
to understand how deeply shocked
and astonished were those who, up
till then, had been responsible for the
educational process, when their power
and authority were questioned, not
timidly as in the past, by a few enligh¬
tened spirits, but on a massive scale
by the revolt and challenge of those
directly concerned.
E.
in recent years are
too well known to need enlarging upon.
Suffice it here to stress the importance
of a point in history at which the spirit
of contestation, which has been the
leaven of progress in all the essential
areas of modern civilization (the claims
of workers, women, coloured people,
colonies), penetrated the sector of
education until then bristling with
defensive devices.
Student action has achieved a huge
breach in the wall of educational
conservatism. Through this breach
has flooded an irresistible tide of long¬
standing questions, swelled by more
recent speculation and fed by im¬
patience and new hopes.
As has happened in face of oppres¬
sion, injustice and poverty, the victims
are no longer resigned to acquiesc¬
ence. Those who accept the defects
and shortcomings of education as
being part of the natural order of
things are becoming fewer and fewer.
The world appears to be in search
of a new form of education which,
like any new order, must establish a
balance between contradictory forces
and recognize its fragility and tempor¬
ary nature. It would be impossible
to draw up an exhaustive list of the
questions being put, whether of fund¬
amental importance or of detail. But
some of these questions are too insis¬
tent and too important to be ignored.
What should be the scope of the
educational process? To which parts
of the human personality does it
apply? Have not our definitions of it
up to now been too narrow and res¬
trictive? Have not physical, social,
emotional and aesthetic values been
sacrificed to a limited conception of
knowledge and the intellect?
When we consider the development
of the individual, what relationship is
there between objective factors (sex,
biological factors, socio-economic
status), the different forms of action
(on things and on men) and the various
educational methods?

a systematic directed effort by the
individual to co-ordinate the facts of
experience into a unified and harmo¬
nious personality? And what is the link
between these two notions of being
educated and having an education?
Where should the educative process
take place? At school? At university?
At home? In the factory? On the
playing field? In the trade union? At
the theatre? Through radio and tele¬
vision programmes? Is there an all-
embracing, global concept by which
we can determine the specific contri
bution made by each situation and
each institution to the instruction and
education of the individual? How can
we link these various contributions
into a harmonious whole?
Is there a best age for education ?
Or should we not consider that
each age raises specific problems
and that at each stage of his existence
the human being must make a new
effort (being aided in this by institution¬
al structures) to comprehend new
aspects of life, to comprehend himself
and to find his place in life and to equip
himself emotionally as well as intellec¬
tually to accept new challenges and
assume his responsibilities competently
and with circumspection? Is there not
in this a considerable extension of the
general concept of education as well
as of the function it is called upon
to fulfil in human destiny?
How can we reconcile the needs of
selection with those of training?
To what extent does teaching, as
it is practised today, take account of
differences in nature, temperament,
rate of maturing and of the variety
of employments open to pupils?

EDUCATION PUT TO THE QUESTION
The price paid for
introduced into teaching methods and
programmes? Is not educational pract¬
ice in schools and universities itself a
formidable obstacle to the normal
development of creativity in the child
(and future adult)?
How can the function of education
be divided between in-school and
extra-curricular activities? Could not
educational institutions be used as
cultural centres for the community?
What training should teachers of all
kinds receive to prepare them for the
new tasks of education? In particular,
should not a teacher learn to listen
and to observe just as much as, if
not more than, to speak? Is not his
role to organize, to make the tools
of work and research available rather
than to spread out his wares of know¬
ledge before his pupils?
What is the place and the role of
competition in the field of teaching and
what limits should be imposed on it?
How can the principle of solidarity
and collaboration, so vital to the indi¬
vidual and to society, be safeguarded
against the effects of classification?
How can we make use of the mass
media, not only as a means of infor¬
mation and amusement, but for training
the mind and the critical faculties?
Can we allow national resources, of
necessity limited, to be wasted by
making children repeat a scholastic
year, by allowing them to drop out or
by weeding out processes against
which there is no appeal, etc.?
This is but a somewhat arbitrary
choice from a whole complex of ques¬
tions each of which involves allied
problems concerning the structures of
society, the place of education in
society and the manner in which
education fulfils the aspirations,
whether expressed or not, of indivi¬
duals and groups.
Everyone will find other questions
of his own, and I doubt if anyone is
capable of supplying an exhaustive
list of questions. The important thing
is to be aware of the central, dominant
fact education in its entirety has been
brought in question.
Of course, we could decide to make
no real changes and merely paper over
the cracks In the wall. The reasons
for inertia are easy to understand.
The introduction of a new order is a
formidable undertaking. It involves
renunciation and sacrifice and requires
an enormous amount of work of all
kinds calling for courage, resolution
and an unshakable confidence in
man's capabilities. It is the expres¬
sion of an optimistic view of life that

(Continued)
standing still
aims at sweeping away the remains
of the pessimistic view linked to out¬
worn beliefs. But there is a price to
be paid, sometimes a very high one,
even for standing still.
Different people have made, different
choices. The wind of change is rising
in many quarters. Here the teacher
has vacated his desk and no longer
stands out from his class. There the
very notion of the class has gone.
In some countries, instead of
schools, "educational units" are being
built which encompass the whole
educational process from the stand¬
point of the pupils (children, adoles¬
cents, adults), of the teaching given
(study, ante-professional training, leis¬
ure time organization, information and
communication), and of the teaching
profession (calling for a contribution
from all those members of the local
community who are in a position to
participate in the overall work of
teaching and training).
Above all there is the steady devel¬
opment of structures and methods in
adult education. Here we see applied
a number of the principles of the new
thinking about education: no compul¬
sion, no certificates (except in certain
exceptional cases) a choice. of activ¬
ities related to interests and. aptitudes;
exchange and dialogue; team work;
equality of status as between pupil
and teacher each of whom learns from
the other; drawing the utmost from
daily experience, etc.
s,lUCH advances, however
remarkable and essential they may be,
cannot all be applied to all educational
fields. There will always remain a
large area in the training of a child in
which he will be the recipient of instruc¬
tion, even though he will very early be
shown the way of autonomous learning
or self-instruction. The fact remains,
however, that adult education offers
patterns of a freedom of expression
from which all education can legitimat¬
ely and profitably draw inspiration.
We are on the threshold of a new
era in education in which more and
more stress will be laid on subject
matter. We shall move beyond the
old era in which man was, above all,
the object of the educational process.
We have seen that part of the
answer has developed in the world
of education itself. But this is, and
can only be, a partial solution. The
undertaking is too wide in scope to
remain the province of any one group,
no matter how qualified it may be.
The educational sector, it will readily
be understood, is not the best placed
to provide all the answers, both for
the reasons stated above and also
because it is neither satisfactory nor
helpful to be both judge and litigant.
One of the major contributions of
educators, aware of the shortcomings
of the theory and practice of the
educational process, has been the
recognition of the need for education
of a continuing nature. But the pres¬
ent success of the notion of continuing
education only serves to spotlight the
vastness of the research and exper¬
iment required before this concept
can become, not merely an inter¬
pretation of the educational process,
but a guide to action.
Who is to inform us as to the
conditions for and the rhythm of pers¬
onal development? This is the task of
the psychologist, the specialist in
characterology. Who will work out
the precise yield of the educational
process considered by itself and In
relation to other forms of investment?
This is a job for the economist.
For their part the sociologist and
the politician will shed light on the
role of education, as product and fac¬
tor, in the evolution of society. It is
the artist, surely, who will contribute
the most valuable lessons concerning
the relationship between the produc¬
tion of a work of art and the devel¬
opment of the human being.
For this new order, to which we
aspire, to take shape and root we
shall have to mobilize all available
intellectual, spiritual and practical res¬
ources as well as those forces that
support the whole social edifice.
Experience gained from working in
factory, field and office is surely just
as important to the elaboration of the
new educational doctrine as the wis¬
dom of philosophers, the imagination
of poets and the theoretical and pract¬
ical systems of learned men.
As a result of the new education
a new type of man will gradually
emerge who will be attuned to spiritual
progress and social advance. Such
a man will be less concerned with
arming himself with an arsenal of pat
answers and with assessing the
breadth of his learning by the number
of correct answers he can give. But
he will be the questioning man. By
a continuing educational effort he will
be able to handle with ease and a
sense of well-being the three essential
forms of questioning poetic, scientific
and political.
