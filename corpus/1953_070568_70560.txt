THE question of art education can! hardly be dealt with in isolation
where young children are con-
cerned, for children do not separate
the joy of creation from the joys of
seeing, laughing, admiring, talking,
singing and feeling. For them, all
these joys are used in a single one :
that of living.
Thus the ric. hness or the poverty of
their childhood environment can have
a decisive effort on their creative
expression. Put them in severe
surroundings where everything is for-
bidden, and you will make them timid,
uncommunicative and lethargic beings
with little inclination to give vent to
their feelings or express themselves.
Place them in a happy atmosphere in
a place designed specially for them,
where they can run about, touch,
observe, experiment and build, and
they will reveal themselves, and will
often produce ravishing things reflect-
ing their happiness and enthusiasm.
"For life, through life"was the
saying of Dr. Decroly, who attached
great importance to the background
provided for the early school years, on
which will depend the child's hap-
piness or boredom, his love for re-

haps a room with
wide bays open-
ing on to a gar-'
den where the
children can work
or play. The

be a scene of

ing pretty colours
and happy chil-
dren, a garden

doors ? In thflk
centre of the
room there is a..
round table, sur-
rounded with
little chairs where
you long to sit
down and bring
your dreams and
ideas to life, with
paintbrush, pen-
cil and scissors.
In a corner, there
is a puppet thea-
tre, with marion-
nettes of every
shape and size,
made by the older
children, where
you can put on a
little show for
you r sma I j,
warding work or his aversion for com-
pulsory and unproductive tasks.
What must we provide for these
small children if they are to give
themselves completely to producing
something which reflects their yearn-
ings and their curiosity ? A house
similar to the one from which they
have come, but richer, full of varied
attractions, and live materials which
appeal to their childish interests. But
all too often the family home is ar-
ranged purely for adults ; everything
has to be in order there, an unchang-'
ing order to suit the grown-ups..
"Don't move that""don't touch this",
"don't make a noise"-all those para-
lysing and discouraging'''don'ts''.
There must be more understanding
and tolerance in the school, within, of
course, certain limits as to dirtying
and destroying things. There the
child must feel able to lead its eager
life of curiosity, full of imagination
and fantasy, of enthusiasm for cons-
tructive work which allows him to
combine his efforts with those of
others and to contribute his personal
note to an orchestra in which
everyone surpasses himself in the
desire for perfection and originality.

friends, full of fun and easy
enough for them to understand,
comedies or tragedies in which the
parts can be played by chickens and
cocks., pigeons and ducks and guinea-
pigs-naive and amusing imitations
of the living and lovable animals
which are kept as pets in and around
the school.
In another corner, there are three
large tubs, full of big blocks for build-
ing houses, trains, garages and
whatnot in a hundred and one in-
genious combinations, The finished
works will be explained, discussed
and admired, and you will be invited
to play the approving part of an
amused spectator. Further on there
are little carpenter's benches with
saws, hammers, nails, small planks,
reels, wooden bolts and boxes.
All this will come to life and take
shape under patient hands, already
skilful and often highly imaginative.
Delightful things, little boats and
planes, will be born in this magical
place and, thanks to the paintbox and
the brushes, will be given a gay, spick-
and-span appearance that will compel
your admiration.
Further on again there are easels
where budding artists can make their
first attempts and go on to express
more and more clearly what they feel
and what excites them, in pictures
which later on their creators will
criticize, sometimes in the most amus-
ing way.
Everything should be free : the
choice of subject, the composition, the
size, the colours. The only guide should
be the inspiration of the moment,
entirely sustained by the personal
confidence and the joy of the creator ;
the great reward will be when the
teacher hovers near unobstrusively
eager to collect and show the work.
Although drawing as such is not
used in painting, there will be plenty
of it done otherwise. Drawing
arouses and trains observation in the
classroom and in nature ; it stimulates
and renews the imagination.
Another fascinating activity is the
direct cutting-cut of coloured paper,
without previously drawing any
design. This is often group work.
calling for a certain attention to
details and exercizing beneficial effect
on the conception of ideas. The table
on which this. work is done is never
deserted. The lively colours attract
the little ones who, adoring the use
of scissors and pots of paste, some-
times produce masterpieces of which
they are very proud.
We should always remember that
every child possesses particular
creative faculties, variously orientated,
so that, if you want to foster and not
to destroy these, you must not pres-
cribe an identical series of activities
for all children. After all, what
counts most from the educational
point of view is not the result achiev-
ed, but the profound joy experienced
in creating.
There is yet another room nearby.
a quiet one, where anyone can go
when he wants to be alone. Some-
times children feel the need to with-
draw from the whole group, to escape
from the noise, to take part with a
few friends in collective educational
games in which they can succeed,
without grown-up help, by using their
own thought and judgement.
Life in profusion, offering all its
innumerable shades and forms, utterly
captivating, that is the spark that
will set alight the creative power and
rouse the desire in the child to com-
municate his rapture. The turtle-dove
on her eggs, hamsters with their
swollen cheek-pouches, nibbling at
their food, white mice caring for their
little pink babies, tiny yellow chickens
pecking under their rudimentary
incubator, the aquarium with its
intricate pattern of quicksilver
wonders, leaping frogs, newts,
salamanders, land the water-beetles
that make a nest like a little boat.
There are silk-worms weaving their
white, green or yellow cocoons and
bean seeds thrusting out shoots under
the damp cotton-wool ; as well as the
spades and little rakes for work in
the tiny gardens, the watering-can
that spouts rain and the pool to
paddle in.
all this is not gathered together
just to furnish subjects for drawing,
like the stuffed animals and plaster
casts provided in traditional schools,
but is there to welcome the young
child, to greet him, to teach him to
caress, to cherish, to see and under-
stand. It is this sum total of sur-
prises which will make his fingers
itch to get hold of a paintbrush and
his eyes eager to see his own more
personal creations.
"Mummie, come and look ! It's
pretty, Mummie."That is how the
toddler will sum up his first impres-
sion when he enters this enchanting
world. No one can long resist the
fascination of such an atmosphere.
Once captured, the little new pupil
will waste no time getting to work.
Hammers, paste-pots, clay, and
scissors will all be at hand.
He will imitate, he will feel his way,
and find it, for all these different
kinds of enticement will enthral him.
He will measure, guess, talk, sing
dance, act and also, in his elation,
will draw, model and paint.
None of these activities will interfere
with the others ; on the contrary,
each will support, illuminate, and
strengthen the other. The develop-
ment of the child's artistic aptitudes
will be the culmination and consum-
mation of other no less useful and
valuable forms of development.
That does not mean that creative
activity should be in the wake of
other disciplines ; often it occupies a
central place very favourable to the
flowering of the child's capacities. It
will impel him to talk, to observe, and
to think ; it twill incite him to ask
questions, to calculate and to experi-
ment. It will be a priceless stimulus
to a host of other activities, instruc-
tive as well as educative.
Having at such an early age begun
to do things for himself, he will want
to gain more insight and gather more
information, in order to do even better.
A particularly successful picture may
be the starting point of a host of
enquiries of more detailed investiga-
tions, or an unforeseen chain of
relationships that will take all of the
little group out to the flowers in the
garden or the animals in the enclosure
and find its mimed and spoken
consummation in the puppet-theatre.
The little builder who has withdrawn
into a corner to admire his work will
feel the need to share his delight ;
perhaps he will persuade his admirers
to work with him and to organize
together some more imposing cons-
truction, to the great gain of the
social education of this charming and
industrious community. Since he will
be accustomed to meet with respect
for his creative expression, whether it
be spoken or artistic, not only will he
acquire confidence in his own powers,
but he will also value those of others,
whose ability and originality he will
have learned to appreciate.
All this activity, freely carried out,
in common with all the individual and
collective reactions it involves, will be
aimed not so much at revealing par-
ticular talents and spotting future
geniuses as at enlightening the child
about himself and the teacher about
the infinite variety of his world of
little people.
To provide as many opportunities as
possible for the child to express
himself and to flourish, that is truly
our essential responsibility. And in
so doing we too shall have our fill of
rapture.
