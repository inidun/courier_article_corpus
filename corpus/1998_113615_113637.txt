‘Lo o k , yo u ’re a doughnut.” P r o f e s s o r
Michael Hawley is stating his case for
embedded technology. “ Yo u ’re a
roundish little thing with a hole in the top
and you pour food in and it comes out a hole
in the bottom and you roll around a little
d u ring the day, but topologically speaking
you’re just a doughnut.And that’s about all
you know about the nature of what you eat
and what comes out.”
H aw l e y, a principal inve s t i g ator for the
Things T h at Think (TTT) consort i u m , a
research group at the Massachusetts
Institute of Te c h n o l o g y ’s Media Lab, i s
t rying to make commonplace, e ve ry d ay
objects smarter to better understand and
monitor our bodies. “ We are incredibly
n a i ve about how our bodies work day to day.
. . because we don’t have any way to
measure it or sense it.”
For too long we have been forced to adapt
to technology—to make our bodies and live s
c o n f o rm to clunky desktop computers , f o r
e x a m p l e . We memorize long strings of we b
addresses to find cheap airfares but have
trouble remembering where we left our keys.
The solution to these problems, at least in
the United Stat e s , is more technology.
Embedded technology that is smaller, s m a rt e r
and,most importantly, everywhere.
Embedded technology—fitting out objects
with computational enhancements that
i n t e gr ate digital and physical wo r l d s — w i l l
m ove in two directions: out into our
e nvironment and closer to our bodies.
According to Professor Mitchel Resnick,
another TTT member, the gr owth of research
in this fie l d , which has substantial corp o r at e
s u p p o rt , can be tied to three deve l o p m e n t s :
smaller and cheaper processors , better sensors ,
and continued advances in communicat i o n
and networking technologi e s.
H awley say s ,“ I t ’s becoming miniat u ri z e d
so quickly that what used to be as big as a
house and then as big as a file cabinet now sits
on your desk,and then it’s in your lap, then
it’s in your pockets and then it might as well
be your pockets.”
Back to the doughnut.One of Hawley’s
many research interests is body monitoring
t e c h n o l o g y.His team has attached new body
sensing technology to marathon ru n n e rs and
Mount Everest climbers. Subjects eve n
swa l l owed a pill that measured body core
t e m p e r at u r e . H awley foresees a time when
we will monitor our health with a wri s t wat c h

device or a processor in the heels of our shoes,
where there is room for chips. According to
H aw l e y, health monitori n g, for those who
can afford it,will be “one of those really big
i nventions that is an indispensable part of
everyday life.So that your shoes know more
about you eve ry day than the doctor has eve r
known before.”
Making this technology more intuitive and
c o m f o rtable is MIT gr a d u ate student
Margaret Ort h , who is developing electronic
fa b ri c. While she can imagine the practical
uses of fa b rics embedded with computat i o n a l
c o m p o n e n t s ,O rth is dri ven by expressive and
emotional goals: to create clothing which can
not only monitor heart rates but also
emotions—or act as an interface for creat i ve
e x p r e s s i o n .She has already designed a musical
jacket with a sewn-in keyboard, and believe s
t h at “by creating computational devices that
are intimate with us phy s i c a l l y, we begin to
think about technology differently.We begin to
think that it is accessible, r e a c h a b l e , c r e at i ve
and ultimately human.”
The key to many embedded technologi e s
is the communication between objects.M e d i a
Lab researchers have proposed giving every
single object on the planet a unique Unive rs a l
B i n a ry Identific ation Code (UBIC), a seri e s
of numbers that identifies it to any
other object or network that has a
need to know.
Imagine a smart box of corn
f l a k e s. A sensor collects dat a
about how much cereal is in the
b ox . The processor “ k n ow s ” w h e n
the box is almost empty and then
c o m m u n i c ates the inform ation to
the house netwo r k , w h i c h
places an online order for a
new box.Hold up a bottle of aspirin to your
n e t worked bathroom screen and the
m a n u fa c t u r e r ’s web site or inform ation about
drug interactions will appear.The goal is to
make mundane tasks as easy and automatic
as possible, freeing time for more entert a i n i n g
or thoughtful pursuits.
Place a can of mushroom soup, an old
bag of carrots and other food on your kitchen
counter and the kitchen will suggest several
r e c i p e s , then recite the instructions as yo u
cook.
But if your house is automatically re-
ordering everything from your food to your
l i p s t i c k , h ow easily could stores or
m a n u fa c t u r e rs construct a profile of yo u r
life? Will your home screens display
advertisements to offset their cost, and will
they make shopping so easy that you purchase
more than you need? 
As with many new technologies, we will
need to balance the issues of access and
privacy.Your car company may remind you
when you need a tune-up, but by tracking
your mileage they will also know when to
send you advertisements for a new car.
Yet beyond these commercial interests,
there is a wider concern lurking in the
b a c k ground of this smart new
wo r l d . Media scholar and MIT
l i t e r ature professor Henry
Jenkins reminds us that the
h i s t o ry of technology has alway s
been coupled with fear of the
new tools. “ W h at is basic to
these fears is the sense that we
are giving over too much
control over our lives to
t e c h n o l o g y.” At the

same time, “ We have too long a history of
watching technology fail in our daily lives.”
As Jenkins explains, “ Trusting the
machine means not simply trusting the
technology itself , which seems alien and
unreliable, but also trusting the companies
which made it,which are often perceived as
out for quick profit, planning for
o b s o l e s c e n c e , disinterested in consumers ’
real needs and sloppy in their wo r k m a n s h i p.
W h at if we make our culture more and more
dependent upon machines which we do not
u n d e rs t a n d , do not know how to fix ours e l ve s ,
and do not trust?” n
