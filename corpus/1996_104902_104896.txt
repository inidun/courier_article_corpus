Once upon a time Pele the fire god¬
dess, daughter of Moe-moea-au-lii
the troublemaker and Haumea the
Earth-mother, was travelling in
search of a place to settle. She tried
each of the Hawaiian Islands, one
after the other, hut whenever she
sank her magic spade into the earth
to dig a fire pit, she was too close to
the sea and the waves came and
extinguished the flames. Then, at
long last, she found her dream home
on Kilauea volcano in the southeast
corner of the Island of Hawaii, some¬
times called the Big Island.
Native Hawaiians are attached to
their traditions, and still offer their
goddess meat, fish, fruit and flowers,
which they lay on the edge of
Ilalemaumau crater, a sacred place in
their island chain. This sanctuary is
located inside Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park, which was created by
a decree of the U.S. Congress in 1961

and in 1980 became a UNESCO bios¬
phere reserve1. The Park's status
does not prevent the local people
from practising their traditions there.
Native Hawaiians who regularly go
there do not have to pay the $5
entrance fee, they can pick the med¬
icinal plants they need, and the
women are allowed to purify them¬
selves in the hot springs.
The Garden of Eden
About two million people visit the
Park each year. There are excellent
facilities for welcoming them.
Exhibitions and film projections are
held at a large Visitor Centre which
also contains a mass of documentary
material and proposes theme-related
guided tours. A network of asphalted
roads enables tourists to skirt the
edge of Kilauea or travel down to the

sea. The diversity of landscapes is
amazing, and trails for walkers fan
out in all directions. As the sun beats
down, you pass by smoking, silver-
grey era ters , orange banks of sulphur,
and mineral deserts and luxuriant
forests where towering ferns mingle
with the dark foliage of the trees.
Visitors can climb 4,1 70-metre-high
Mauna Loa (the "Great Mountain")
that has been built up by a succes¬
sion of lava flows and whose perfectly
rounded summit is sometimes cov¬
ered in snow.
This remote Pacific archipelago
of 124 islands, islets and atolls,
including eight main islands, emerged
from the ocean 70 million years ago
but it was not until 1,600 years ago
that its first human inhabitants
Polynesians from the Marquesas
Islands arrived. The new settlers
found plants and insects that had
been carried to the islands by the
wind, birds or sea, but no predatory
land mammals. This was a decisive

factor, for in the absence of preda¬
tors, neither j liants nor animals devel¬
oped unnecessary systems of defence.
Before mosquitoes came to the
islands as clandestine passengers on
the first sailing ships, the small bird
called the red apapane (Ilimatione
sanguínea) had developed no immu¬
nity to malaria. Avian malaria now
takes its toll. Mint and sage had no
need of strong, protective odours
before the introduction of goats.
Park officials are doing their best
to save the the state bird, the nene
or Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvi-
censis), from extinction. American
zoologist Stuart Pimm calculates
that at least 101 bird species have
disappeared from Hawaii since
humans settled there.
Internal enemies
Hawaii's isolation explains why the
islands are home to an extraordinar¬
ily large number of endemic plants:
95 per cent of some 1,000 recorded
species are found nowhere else in
the world, but they are vulnerable to
feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and other
browsing animals. According to
botanist Charles Lamoureux, direc¬
tor of Honolulu's Lyon Arboretum,
about half the plants should be con¬
sidered endangered, even if they do
not yet figure on official lists.
There are also 5,000 species
brought from outside, 25 of which
are especially destructive. The worst
offenders are the firetree (Myrica
faya) from the Canary Islands, the
strawberry guava (l'sidium cat-
tleianum) a tree from Brazil, the
banana poka vine (Passiflora molis-
sima) from South America, and

all proliferate, smothering native
plants. But war has been declared on
them. In one case, an insect has been
imported from the Canary Islands
in order to combat its compatriot
plant, the firetree, but results are
slow in coming. A botanist with the
National Park, Linda Pratt, tried
various herbicides, but it is an uphill
job because of the risk of destroying
innocuous plants and polluting the
water. Widespread "Wanted Dead
or Alive" posters display the name
and photo of the miconia, a prolific
tree that must be destroyed before it
overruns the island, as it is threaten¬
ing to do in Tahiti (French Polynesia)
where it has already invaded three-
quarters of the wooded area.
Protecting the park also means
eliminating certain species of land
mammals that were introduced by
humans. To do so, Park Superinten¬
dent Jim Martin has taken the unusual
stej) of enrolling the help of poach¬
ers. Some may feel sad about getting
rid of feral cats, but they plunder the
eggs and young of a threatened
species, the dark-rumped petrel
(Pterodroma phueopygia sandvi-
censis). Feral goats were virtually
eradicated with the help of local
hunters. Their number has fallen from
15,000 in 1980 to less than 100.
Although 11,000 feral pigs were
killed between 1930 and 1970, it
is estimated that around 4,000 still
survive.
In addition to hunting, building

lacking. There are only eight
rangers, whereas from fifteen to
twenty are needed for proper sur¬
veillance. The Park can no longer
afford to pay researchers. Those
who come to study there belong to
outside organizations. In protest, the
Park closed down in November 1995
but had to re-open after three weeks
when the public, which had initially
been supportive, lost patience.
The situation is particularly wor¬
risome because the Park is in a dan¬
gerous area. Coastal cliffs crumble,
and lava can erupt at any moment,
since Mauna Loa and Kilauea are two
of the world's most active volcanoes.
Cuttings had to be made in some of
the most recent lava flows in order to
re-open some of the roads.
Uses and abuses
Although Volcanoes Park is a well-
defined central area of the Big
Island, maps do not yet show either
the buffer or the intermediate zones
required by a biosphere reserve. Jim
Martin explains that there is an
understanding with the federal
prison and the private lands that bor¬
der the park and that a development
plan is being worked out. New build¬
ings in a nearby village will blend with
the forest and cause no damage.
A more serious problem arises
from the fact that Hawaii has been in
a catastrophic economic situation
since the collapse of world sugar
prices. Sugar cane fields have been
abandoned, and jobless labourers are
growing marijuana even inside the
park boundaries. By clearing forest
land for their crops and protecting

them with lethal traps, they are
endangering the ecosystem. Heavy
fines and long prison sentences, how¬
ever, have helped to improve the
situation.
But this is not all. Tree ferns are
being cut down with chainsaws and
hauled away in truck loads and,
despite the presence of surveillance
cameras, vandals are stealing archae¬
ological treasures. The Park was
included on UNESCO's World Heritage
List in 1987 and contains once-inhab¬
ited caves, vestiges of villages and
fragile petroglyphs, some of which
have recently been covered over by a
lava flow.
The Hawaiian Volcano Obser¬
vatory, founded in 1912 and located
within the park on the edge of the
Kilauea caldera, plays a major role in
running the park. Ground deforma¬
