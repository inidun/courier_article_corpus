GOTTFRIED KELLER
The painter not the poet
held the pen
Gottfried Keller, the great Swiss novelist and
poet of the German language was a painter who,
having discovered his talents for writing,
abandoned art altogether for literature. Keller determin¬
ed to become an artist in 1834. For three years he
groped to find his way, falling upon a series of
incompetent teachers, and finally moving to Munich in
1840. Here he spent a couple of lean years as an exile
living amongst the local Swiss community and trying to
develop his style. After illness and poverty had
undermined his strength he returned to Zurich and
began increasingly to occupy himself with writing. In
1846, on the basis of a volume of poems published by
Keller, the Cantonal Government awarded him a pension
which he used to study philosophy at Heidelberg, thereby
finally breaking with his active interest in painting.
Albert Schweitzer said that Keller's writings "only
become intelligible when one recalls that a dramatic
painter, not a poet, is holding the pen."
Keller's pictures show a keen feeling for nature, for
the rivers, forest, lakes and mountains amongst which
he was born and reared.
He was not very original either in his choice of
subjects or in his treatment, nor did his haphazard
training permit him to acquire a sureness of technique.
The sketch of a medieval town (above) which dates from
his return to Zurich (1843) is an interesting illustration
of the conflict within Keller at that time. The inspi¬
ration is plainly literary, the idea having originally been
to depict a town of gables and turrets over which there
hangs a kind of sleepy, timeless, enchantment. In the
foreground there was to have been a meeting of two
animated processions but his evident inability to grapple
with the problems of figure drawing discouraged Keller
and he never completed the romance he so clearly saw
in his mind's eye.
