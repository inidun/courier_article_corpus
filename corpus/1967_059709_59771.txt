The dawn 
of the geog 
spirit 
by Philippe Wolff 
Kisii: of the world 
had shown a marked shrinkage in the 
third and fourth centuries, and Roman 
geographers like Solinus had interlard- 
ed what was left with information that 
was entirely mythical. From the ninth 
century onwards, however, thanks to 
Scandinavian travellers, horizons be- 
gan once more to widen. A Dane, 
named Gardar Svavarsson, made the 
journey round Iceland in about 860; in 
878 or 886 a Norwegian, Ohthere 
(Ottar) rounded the North Cape, and 
reached the mouth of the Dvina. 
Then came the discovery of Green- 
land by the Norwegian, Gunnbjorn, in 
about 900, and its exploration by an- 
other Norwegian, Eric the Red, in about 
980. Eric's son, Leif, attempting to 
establish a direct route from Norway 
to Greenland, was carried towards Vin- 
land, a part of North America (1000). 
PHILIPPE WOLFF, co-editor of Volume Ill 
(Eastern Predominance and the Rise of the 
West) of the History of Mankind, is a French 
historian, philologist and man of letters.

Fact (icebergs and volcanoes) 
and fantasy (menacing sea- 
monsters) are intermingled on 
this 16th century Spanish chart 
of northern waters (from the tip 
of Norway to Iceland and the 
edge of Greenland in this 
detail). In the 9th, 10th and 11th 
centuries, Scandinavian navigators 
discovered a large area of the 
Northern Hemisphere. In the 
11th century a Norwegian mariner 
is believed to have set foot 
briefly in Newfoundland and 
Southern Labrador, travelled up 
the valley of the St. Lawrence, 
and even reached Nova Scotia.

Not long afterwards, Thorfin Karl- 
sefni set up an Icelandic colony there. 
This proved short-lived, but it seems 
fairly certain that he set foot briefly 
in Newfoundland, and southern Labra- 
dor, travelled up the valley of the St. 
Lawrence, and reached even as far as 
Nova Scotia and New England. 
Nor were the Scandinavians mere 
coverers of distances. The Konungs 
Skuggsjé (Mirror of the King), dating 
from about 1250, is the work of an 
anonymous Norwegian who had lived 
in Iceland, and, with its admirable 
descriptions of glaciers and icebergs, 
is the only European work to give 
evidence of a true geographic spirit. 
The other great European contribu- 
tion to the knowledge of the globe is 
represented by the journeys made by 
missionaries and merchants in the 
thirteenth century into Asia, in con- 
nexion with the Mongol conquest. 
From the time of John of Plano Car- 
pini, who reached Karakorum (1245-47), 
to that of Marco Polo, who lived for a 
long time (1271-95), in China, some

a 
   
dozen travellers, most of them Italian, 
left more or less detailed accounts of 
their journeyings. 
The most remarkable, in the preci- 
sion of its observation, is perhaps that 
of the Flemish Franciscan, William of 
Rubruck (1253-55), who among other 
things re-established the fact that the 
Caspian was an inland sea. But when 
Marco Polo returned to Italy, he was 
met with ironic scepticism, and all the 
treasure of his accumulated observa- 
tion remained almost unused. 
Even more disappointing was the 
representation of the world. In the 
few Mappae Mundi, that have come 
down to us (for example, the work 
of the anonymous geographer of 
Ravenna from the eighth century and 
especially the maps, attributed to 
Hereford, from the thirteenth), con- 
siderations of exact representation 
seem to have been subordinated to a 
concern for aesthetic effect, aimed at 
producing an ornamental design, or de- 
ferring to some religious considera- 
tion. For instance, Jerusalem is plac-

  
  
ed in a central position and Palestine 
is enlarged disproportionately to hold 
all the biblical place names. 
More accurate maps were neverthe- 
less a necessity, and sectional topo- 
graphical maps in due course made 
their appearance. These were intend- 
ed for the elucidation of itineraries, 
as, for example, the four maps of 
Britain produced in the thirteenth cen- 
tury by the English historian, Matthew 
Paris, and the portulan charts, showing 
only seas and coast-lines, which were 
in use among European sailors from 
the twelfth century onwards. 
Geographical questions were also, 
for reasons which were partly theolo- 
gical, subjects of considerable con- 
troversy. That the earth was a sphere 
was throughout maintained, the Church 
expressing no opposition to such a 
view, although there were writers who 
advanced other theories. It is ques- 
tionable, however, whether ths theolo- 
gical affirmation was based on any 
very clear mental picture of its im- 
plications.

Considerations of climatic variations 
gave rise to doubts about the in- 
habitability of the sub-tropical areas 
and the southern hemisphere. Grosse- 
teste followed Ptolemy in declaring 
such regions to be uninhabitable; 
Albert the Great, on the other hand, 
maintained that, as none of Nature's 
activity could be in vain, the south 
must have its temperate zone, inhabit- 
ed by men, and that these regions 
were not separated from the known 
world by insuperable obstacles. 
The relative geographical distribu- 
tion of land and sea continued to en- 
gage two schools in controversy. The 
orthodox school seems to have fav- 
oured the “oceanic theory” of Pto- 
lemy, for which there was biblical con- 
firmation (for instance, in Psalm XXIV, 
according to which God established 
the earth on the waters). The other 
school supported the “continental 
theory”, however, affirming the exis- 
tence of three continental land masses 
like Eurasia. This theory could also 
claim biblical substantiation, and more- 
over it received the support of Roger 
Bacon, and was not without its influ- 
ence on Christopher Columbus. 
The tides also received attention, 
since these were seen as an admirable 
example of astral influence: it was 
generally agreed that they were the 
result of the action of the moon. The 
Venerable Bede, having assembled a 
basis of sound information, drew up 
a valuable table of tides and their 
variations in Britain. 
Problems of geology and relief were 
scarcely formulated, save in relation 
to extraordinary phenomena such as 
volcanoes. There was a general reluc- 
tance to be satisfied, however, with 
the explanation of the water supply 
of rivers merely in terms of precipita- 
tions. It was believed that the waters 
contained in the earth, being lighter, 
rose naturally to the surface, and that 
only the action of the stars prevented 
them from covering it entirely.
