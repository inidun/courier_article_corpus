Fifty years of literary life
by Ba Jin
WHEN the Chinese people
were liberated and the Peo¬
ple's Republic of China was
founded, I wanted to use my pen,
which had been used to writing about
darkness and misery, to write about
new people and new deeds, to cele¬
brate the people's victory and joy. But
I had not the time to familiarize my¬
self with these subjects. I also took
part in non-literary activities.
I wrote widely in praise of our new
society and our new life. These writ¬
ings were used as evidence of my
"crime" and were condemned as
"poisonous weeds" during the ten
years of the "Great Cultural Revolu¬
tion". I myself was illegally detained
and suffered from all kinds of mental
torture and humiliation. During these
ten years I was deprived of all my
civic rights and denied the freedom to
publish.
These ten unforgettable years consti¬
tute an important episode in the his¬
tory of humanity. Few writers in the
world experienced such dreadful, ridi¬
culous, strange, painful events. We
were all involved, we all played a
part, and today when we look back at
what we did during those years we
find our behaviour ridiculous but it
didn't seem like that at the time. I
often say to myself that if I don't sum
up those ten hard years and analyse
myself sincerely, I may one day again
regard cruelty, savagery and stupidity
as part of the normal order of things.
I have never thought about writing
technique or ways of expression when
writing my stories. What I care about
is how to help people lead a better
life, a worthy life, and how to help my
readers contribute to society and to
the people. All my writings have this
aim.
When I met a group of Sinologists
in Paris in September 1981 someone
asked how I had survived the "Cultu¬
ral Revolution". Their sincere desire
to understand something which seemed
quite ordinary to us set my mind
working. Those ten dreadful years had
taught me something. At last I came
to realize what I have learned- from
those long years of disaster.
Gradually things became clearer in
my mind. It must be love, fire, hope,
something positive. Many people had
survived because they had these qual¬
ities. But many had been destroyed
and left to us their love, fire and hope
to be transmitted to posterity. No, I
shall never lay down my pen.
