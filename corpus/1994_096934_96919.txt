Business cultures by Geert Hofstede
Every organization has its symbols, rituals and heroes
n
ANAGEMENT means getting things done
through (other) people. This is true the
world over. In order to achieve this,
one has to know what needs to be done and
one has to know the people involved. Under¬
standing people means understanding their
background, from which their present and future
behaviour can be predicted.
Their background has provided them with a
certain culture, the word culture being used in
the sense of "the collective programming of the
mind which distinguishes the members of one
category of people from another". The "category
of people" may be a nation, a region or an ethnic
group, women or men (gender culture), old or
young (age group and generation culture), a

social class, a profession or occupation (occu¬
pational culture), a type of business, a work
organization or part of it (organizational cul¬
ture), or even a family.
Culture is composed of many elements,
which may be classified in four categories: sym¬
bols, heroes, rituals and values.
Symbols are words, objects and gestures
which derive their meaning from convention. At
the level of national cultures, symbols include
the entire area of language. At the level of orga¬
nizational culture, symbols include abbrevia¬
tions, slang, modes of address, dress codes and
status symbols, all recognized by insiders only.
Heroes are real or imaginary people, dead or
alive, who serve as models for behaviour within
a culture. Selection processes are often based
on hero models of "the ideal employee" or "the
ideal manager". Founders of organizations
sometimes become mythical heroes later on,
and incredible deeds are ascribed to them.
Rituals are collective activities that are tech¬
nically superfluous but, within a particular cul¬
ture, socially essential. In organizations they
include not only celebrations but also many
formal activities defended on apparently rational
grounds: meetings, the writing of memos, and
planning systems, plus the informal ways in
which formal activities are performed: who can
afford to be late for what meeting, who speaks
to whom, and so on.
Values represent the deepest level of a culture.
They are broad feelings, often unconscious and
not open to discussion, about what is good and
what is bad, clean or dirty, beautiful or ugly,
rational or irrational, normal or abnormal, nat¬
ural or paradoxical, decent or indecent. These
feelings are present in the majority of the mem¬
bers of the culture, or at least in those persons
who occupy pivotal positions.
Nationality (and gender as well) is an invol¬
untary attribute; we are born within a family

within a nation, and are subject to the mental pro¬
gramming of its culture from birth. Here we
acquire most of our basic values. Occupational
choice is partly voluntary (dependent on the
society and family); it leads to choice of schools,
and at school we are socialized to the values and
the practices of our chosen occupation.
When we enter a work environment, we are
usually young or not-so-young adults, with
most of our values firmly entrenched, but we
will become socialized to the practices of our
new work environment. National cultures,
therefore, differ mostly at the level of basic
values, while occupational and, even more, orga¬
nizational cultures differ more superficially (in
their symbols, heroes and rituals).
National culture differences
Results from a number of research projects have



led me to classify national cultures along five
dimensions. The first four were found by com¬
paring the values of employees and managers in
fifty-three different national subsidiaries of the
IBM Corporation. They have been labelled:
1) Power distance, or the degree of inequality
among people which the population of a country
considers as normal: from relatively equal to
extremely unequal.
2) Individualism, or the degree to which
people in a country have learned to act as indi¬
viduals rather than as members of cohesive
groups: from collectivist to individualist.
3) Masculinity, or the degree to which "mas¬
culine" values like assertiveness, performance,
success and competition prevail over "femi¬
nine" values like the quality of life, maintaining
warm personal relationships, service, caring,
and solidarity: from tender to tough.
4) Uncertainty avoidance, or the degree to
which people in a country prefer structured
over unstructured situations: from relatively
flexible to extremely rigid.
The table on page 14 lists for twenty-five
out of the fifty-three countries studied the scores
for these dimensions (the table also contains a
fifth dimension that will be explained later). All
scores are relative: the scales have been chosen
so that the distance between the lowest and
highest scoring country on each dimension is
about 100 points.
The table shows that European countries 13

vary widely on all four dimensions. Power dis¬
tances are large in France and Portugal; collec¬
tivism prevails over individualism in Portugal
and Greece; Austria and Italy are very masculine,
while Sweden and the Netherlands arc very
feminine; Belgium and France are uncertainty-
avoiding, while Denmark and the United
Kingdom easily accept uncertainty.
All these differences affect ways of manage¬
ment in these countries. Large power distances
favour centralization, while small power dis¬
tances favour decentralization. Collectivism
favours group rewards and family enterprises,
while individualism favours easy job-hopping
and individual rewards. Masculinity favours com¬
petition and survival of the fittest while femi¬
ninity favours solidarity and sympathy for the
weak. Uncertainty avoidance favours strict rules
and principles, while its opposite favours oppor¬
tunism and tolerance of deviant behaviour.
The fifth dimension
In subsequent research, a fifth dimension of
national culture differences has been found.
Professor Michael H. Bond of the Chinese Uni
versity of Hong Kong studied value differences
among students in twenty-three different coun¬
tries using a questionnaire originally designed in
the Chinese language by Chinese scholars.
Analysis of the data produced four dimensions,
three of them very similar to three of the IBM
dimensions (all except uncertainty avoidance),
the fourth entirely new and very meaningful.
This fifth dimension was called "long-term
orientation" (LTO) as against "short-term ori¬
entation". Values positively rated in LTO are
thrift and perseverance; values negatively related
are respect for tradition, and fulfilling social
expectations, "keeping up with the Joneses".
The last column in the table lists the LTO
scores by country, this time based on the data
collected by Bond. The highest scores on the
fifth dimension are all found in East Asian coun¬
tries: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan. As these are
also the countries with the world's fastest rates
of economic growth in the past twenty-five
years, we can say that long-term orientation is
strongly related to recent economic growth.
Not only values and practices, but even the¬
ories are products of culturally determined
socialization. This has far-reaching consequences

categories in which we think may be unfit for a

Organizational cultures
Research data on differences in organizational
cultures within a given country were collected
in 1985 and 1986 in twenty work organizations
or parts of organizations in Denmark and the
Netherlands. The units studied varied from a toy
company to two municipal police forces.
Analysis of the data showed large differ¬
ences between units in symbols, heroes and rit¬
uals (we labelled the three together "practices"),
but only modest differences in values. Different
organizations within the same countries can
maintain very different practices on the basis of
fairly similar employee values.
Six independent dimensions made it pos¬
sible to describe the larger part of the variety in
organizational practices:
1) Process-oriented as opposed to results-
oriented units, the former being dominated by
technical and bureaucratic routines, the latter by
"Individualism favours
easy job-hopping and
individual rewards."

"Employee values have

The workplace can only
change people's values to a

GEERT HOFSTEDE,
of the Netherlands, taught
organizational anthropology
and international management
at the University of Limburg,
Maastricht, before becoming
the first director of the
Institute for Research on
International Co-operation
(IRIC). His most recent book is

Hill, London, 1991).
a concern for outcomes. This dimension was
associated with the degree of homogeneity of the
unit's culture: in results-oriented units, every¬
body perceived their practices in about the same
way; in process-oriented units, there were vast



differences in perception within the unit. We
consider the homogeneity of a culture as a mea¬
sure of its "strength"; strong cultures are more
results-oriented than weak ones, and vice versa.
2)Job-oriented as opposed to employee-ori¬
ented units. Job-oriented cultures assume
responsibility for the employees' job perfor¬
mance only, and nothing more; employee-ori¬
ented cultures assume a broader responsibility
for their members' well-being. A unit's posi¬
tion on this dimension seems to be largely the
result of historical factors, such as the philos¬
ophy of its founder(s) and the presence or
absence in its recent history of economic crises
with collective layoffs.
3) Professional as opposed toparochial units.
In the former, the (usually highly educated)
members identify primarily with their profes¬
sion; in the latter, the members derive their iden¬
tity from the organization for which they work.
4) Open systems as opposed to closed systems.
This dimension refers to the style of internal
and external communication, and to the ease
with which outsiders and newcomers are
admitted.
5) Tight internal control as opposed to loose
internal control. This dimension deals with the
degree of formality and punctuality within the
organization. It is partly a function of the unit's
technology: banks and pharmaceutical compa¬
nies can be expected to show tight control,
research laboratories and advertising agencies
loose control; but even with the same tech¬
nology, units still differ on this dimension.
6) A pragmatic as opposed to a normative
way of dealing with the environment, in partic¬
ular with customers. Service units should be
found towards the pragmatic (flexible) side,
units involved in the application of legal rules
towards the normative (rigid) side, but reality
does not always correspond to this pattern.
According to this research, what a person
has to learn when (s)he joins a work organization
is mainly a matter of practices. Employee values
have been developed in the family and the school;
they play a role in the selection and self-selection
process for the job. The workplace can only
change people's values to a limited extent. In the
popular literature, organization cultures are often
presented as a matter of values. The confusion
arises because this literature does not distinguish
between the values of the founders and leaders
and those of the bulk of employees.
Founders and leaders, on the basis of their
values, create the symbols, the heroes and the rit¬
uals that constitute the daily practices of the
organization's members. However, members
only to a limited extent have to adapt their per¬
sonal values to the organization's needs. A work
organization, as a rule, is not a "total institution"
like a prison or mental hospital. Organizational
cultures according to our data reside at a more
superficial level of mental programming than the
things learned previously in the family and at
school. In spite of their more superficial nature,
organizational cultures are still hard to change
because they have developed into collective
habits. Changing them is a top management
task that should be based on a strategy and a
cost-benefit analysis. Here again there is no
single formula for success.
All statements in this article should be seen
as only "statistically" true: they are common
trends, but individuals may differ from them. '
Within each country there is a wide range of
individuals, and this fact too should be taken into
account in order to manage successfully. How¬
ever, an insight into cultural differences will
prevent us from attributing to an individual's
personality forms of behaviour which are
normal in his or her country, and from trying to
apply supposedly universal success formulas to
people who are not universal.
