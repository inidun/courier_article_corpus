THE CENTRE FOR OUR COMMON FUTURE
44
The phrase "Our Common
Future" became widely
known as the title of the
report of the World Commission
on Environment and Develop¬
ment, often referred to as the
Brundtland Report, after the
Commission's chairman, Gro
Harlem Brundtland, Prime Min¬
ister ofNorway. Widely acclaimed
on its publication in 1987, the
Report for the first time gave cur¬
rency to the term "sustainable
development" which became one
of the central issues of the 1992
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In
1988, the Centre for Our Common
Future, a Geneva-based charitable
organization, was founded to
encourage efforts worldwide to
promote sustainable develop¬
ment and follow up other recom¬
mendations of the Brundtland
Report.
Helped by a network of more
than 200 Working Partner Insti¬
tutions in more than 70 countries,
the Centre collects information
on sustainable development and
distributes it to some 35,000 indi¬
viduals and organizations in over
170 countries. It publishes two
periodicals (free for subscribers
in developing countries), The
Network, an 8-page newsletter on
sustainable development initia¬
tives worldwide, and TheBulletin,
a 130-page quarterly which is
devoted to a main theme (e.g., the
Cairo Conference on Population
and Development in issue
number 24, October 1994) and
may also be obtained on diskette
in PC 3.5", PC 5.25" or Macintosh.
The Bulletinis a mine of informa¬
tion on environmental questions:
international conferences, pub¬
lications, videos and radio pro¬
grammes. Organizations and per¬
sons wishing to announce an
environment-related event or
reach a specific audience are
invited to contact The Bulletin
and be added to its mailing-list.
The Centre has also produced
a remarkable booklet which pre¬
sents a plain-language version of
Agenda 21 and the other agree¬
ments made at Rio de Janeiro.
Entitled The Earth Summit's
Agendafor Change, it is available
in English, French, Italian, Russian
and Spanish. Each topic discussed
is illustrated with figures and
tables showing, for example, the
volume ofhazardous waste world¬
wide, the percentage ofthe world's
population living in slums, and
the degree of soil degradation.
The Centre awards six-month
internships to young professionals
from countries of the South,
enabling them to visit Geneva, join
in the Centre's work, and increase
their knowledge about sustainable
development. It has also compiled
a catalogue of information pro¬
duced by the 1992 Rio non-gov¬
ernmental "People's Summit", the
Global Forum175 hours of TV
videotape, 5,000 photographs, 400
hours of audio tape, 350 meeting
documents, a 20,000-name data¬
base and hundreds of reports,,
books and declarations.
