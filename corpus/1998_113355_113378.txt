■ What is the Biotech Century?
Our futurists have too narr owly defined the
t we n t y - first century as the inform ation age.
In fact, a far more profound shift is taking
place in the global economy. C o m p u t e rs
and genes are beginning to fuse into a single
p owerful technological and economic force
t h at is laying the foundation for the biotech
century. Computers are increasingly being
used to decipher,manage and organize the
vast genetic inform ation that is the raw
resource of the new global economy.A l r e a d y
m u l t i n ational corp o r ations are creating gi a n t
life-science complexes from which to fa s h i o n
a bio-industrial world.
There are tremendous short - t e rm bene-
fits–new plants and animals,new pharma-
ceuticals and energy sources. But it is naive
to believe that these benefits come with no
c o s t s.The env i r o n m e n t a l , social and ethical
i m p l i c ations of this science are chilling.W i l l
the creation of cloned,chimeric and trans-
genic species mean the end of nature? Will
the mass release of genetically engineered
organisms into our biosphere mean genetic
pollution and irr e ve rsible damage to the
biosphere in the twe n t y - first century? W h at
are the risks of making a “perfect”baby?
■ But how does this differ from our long-
standing struggle to redesign nature?
It is true that we have been engi n e e ri n g
n ature since the dawn of the Neolithic revo-
lution in agri c u l t u r e , but the new gene-spli-
cing technologies are qualitat i vely different.
In classical breeding, it is only possible to
cross close relatives in the biological king-
d o m . To d ay, h owe ve r , we are no longer
constrained by these biological boundari e s.
For example, scientists have taken the gene
t h at emits light in a fir e fly and injected it
into the genetic code of a tobacco plant,
which when fully gr ow n ,g l ows twe n t y - f o u r
h o u rs a day.We have not seen that in evo l u-
t i o n . Genetically engineered plants,m i c r o -
organisms and animals bring greater risks.
■ In discussions surrounding the use of
gene therapy to cure or prevent human
disease, you raise the question as to who
should decide what is a “good”or “bad”
gene.Are we heading into a new age of
eugenics?
Yes, but it doesn’t bear any resemblance to
w h at we saw in Nazi Germ a ny. The new
eugenics is not social eugenics. It is banal
and friendly. It is commercial and market-
d ri ve n . S o o n , p r o s p e c t i ve parents will be
able to programme the biological future of
their unborn children.They will feel pressure
to rid their children of “undesirable traits”.
If you knew you were going to pass on a
gene for leukemia, wouldn’t you like to eli-
m i n ate that from the sperm or the egg? A n d
w h at about obesity or near-sightedness?
Once we begin this journ e y, there is really no
place to stop. Chilling eugenics issues will
arise as we begin to see our children as the
ultimate shopping experience.
We already see this happening. In the
1 9 8 0 s , the Genetech and Eli Lilly compa-
nies were awarded patents to market a
new genetically engineered gr owth hor-
mone to the few thousand children suffe-
ring from dwa r fism in the United Stat e s.
By 1991, the hormone had become one
of the best selling pharmaceutical dru g s
in the country. C l e a r l y, d o c t o rs were pres-
c ribing the drug to children who were just
s h o rter than their peers. The companies
are now pushing doctors to redefine nor-
mal shortness as an “ i l l n e s s ” .
■ Some critics have branded you as an
alarmist–they consider your views to be
anti-science.These critics go too far, but
at some level,do you feel that we should
restrain this new genetic science?
I believe that genetic science is invaluable;
the question is not the science but the tech-
n o l o gical application of that science. We
must choose between a hard path and a soft
p ath to the twe n t y - first century. In the case
of agri c u l t u r e , for example, the hard pat h
would lead to genetically engineered plants,
environmental risks and health problems.
In contrast, the soft path would mean
using the same genetic sciences to create a
s o p h i s t i c ated and sustainable organic agri-
c u l t u r e .The rule of thumb we ought to apply
is clear: do no harm . S e c o n d l y, a lway s
choose the path that is least likely to foreclose
o p p o rtunities for those not yet here and the
one that is most able to sustain relat i o n s h i p s
instead of draining them.
■ Who is behind this new age of genetic
commerce?
Giant life-science companies are manœu-
vering to control genetic commerce in the
t we n t y - first century.The mergers and acqui-
sitions going on in the life science industry
ri val those in the telecommunicat i o n s ,c o m-
puter and entertainment sectors.The gi a n t
chemical companies are beginning to sell
off their chemical divisions to concentrate
solely on the life sciences.They are making
the shift from the petrochemical age to the
age of genetic commerce. Genes will be the
p ri m a ry raw mat e rial of the coming cen-
t u ry just as oil, metals and minerals were in
the colonial and industrial era.
The name of the game is pat e n t s. In the
next ten ye a rs , we will have isolated virt u a l l y
all 60,000 genes that make up the bluepri n t
for the human race.Virtually every one of

a brave new world
Will wars be fought for the control of genes in the
21st century? Jeremy Rifkin fears the worst and
explains why
Jeremy Rifkin,economist and activist.

those genes will be the intellectual propert y
of these life science companies for at least
twenty years.
The whole idea of patenting genes is a
s c a m . Under US and European stat u t e s ,
you have to prove that you have inve n t e d
something that is nove l , non-obvious and
u s e f u l . So consider the example of a che-
mist in the nineteenth century isolat i n g
helium which is not obvious and certainly
u s e f u l . N ow that chemist can patent the
technique used to isolate helium but not
the element.T h at ’s because helium is not an
invention but rather a discovery of nature.
But in 1987, the US Patent Office issued
a simple paragraph saying that it was possible
to patent any genetically modified life form
except a human being after birth.The only
reason for excluding patents on humans is
that the US Constitution forbids slavery.
■ But aren’t you oversimplifying the issue.
The patents don’t really cover the genes.
They are awarded to companies and
re s e a rc h e rs to legally protect the
methods invented to isolate or use them.
They are actually patenting the genes.T h e r e
are patents on thousands of human and ani-
mal genes. For example,Myriad Genetics
has isolated a gene that causes breast cancer,
especially in Ashkenazi women (of Eastern
European Jewish ori gi n ) .The company has
a patent on that gene–it is their inve n t i o n .I f
a ny woman in the world goes for a scree-
ning for that breast cancer gene, p a rt of the
fee that she pays is in the form of a royalty to
the company.
Imagine the case of a chimpanzee with
one human gene in its genetic code. T h e
p atent office would now consider that entire
chimpanzee to be an inve n t i o n . This is a
gross violation of the mandate of the US
Patent Office and its statutes.We are now
challenging this in the US patent system.
■ How can you effectively try to counter
this trend given the tremendous finan-
cial stakes involved? 
I have joined with the distinguished cell bio-
l o gist Dr. S t u a rt Newman of New Yo r k
Medical College.We have submitted a pat e n t
to the US Patent Office containing thirt y
claims covering all the human-animal chi-
meras (human-chimpanzee chimeras,
human-pig and other combinations) for
medical purposes. As of now, there are no
existing patents on this kind of chimera.
If we are granted this pat e n t , we will
claim a “genetic conserva n cy ” to forbid any
researcher from crossing human-animal
b o u n d a ries with embryonic cells for twe n t y
ye a rs so that countries can have the time to
d e b ate this issue and hopefully pass the
appropriate legislation to outlaw all trans-
genic organisms.We are also seriously consi-
d e ring whether to test the patent stat u t e s
in the European Union.
■ The US and the World Trade Org a n i z a t i o n
in particular have been pressuring deve-
loping countries like India into adopting
the US model of patent laws to pro t e c t
their natural re s o u rces from exploitation.
How would you advise them?
Two positions are being championed. I think
both are inappropri at e . One position is that
of the life-science companies.The other is
t h at of many of the developing countries who
are say i n g, “ L o o k , these are our resources,
just as oil is in the Middle East.We should be
c o m p e n s at e d .O t h e r w i s e , it is biopiracy.”
But how do you ever compensate for the
b l u e p rints of life? Secondly,who do you com-
p e n s ate? Indigenous knowledge and
resources cross all tribal and national boun-
d a ri e s. For example Merck and Company
h ave an absurd relationship with Costa Rica.
They gi ve a local non-profit institute a million
d o l l a rs for access to all the country ’s ri c h
genetic dive rs i t y.Who does this institute
r e p r e s e n t ?
The gene pool should not be reduced
to commercial exploitation by either gove rn-
ments or companies. I am hoping that gene-
t i c a l l y - rich countries like India will take the
lead in developing a third way in which we
keep the gene pool open–as we did with
Antarctica–by covenant and treat y. If this
doesn’t happen, we are going to have gene
wars in the twenty-first century as we had
wa rs over oil, metals and minerals in the
i n d u s t rial era. This commercial competi-
tion and conflict over ow n e rship and control
of the gene pool will further divide the have s
and the have-nots.
■ If this is such an important issue, why has
there been so little public debate? Is the
media to blame? 
For the most part , the science and bu s i n e s s
Alarmist or seer?
A ctivism has been a way of
life for Jeremy Rifkin, b o r n
in the US state of Colorado in
1 9 4 3 . The founder and president
of the Foundation on Economic
Trends in Wa s h i n g t o n , D. C . , h e
has testified before numerous
congressional committees on
subjects ranging from germ
warfare threats to the labeling
of genetically engineered foods.
He has also been a consultant
to numerous heads of state and
o f f i c i a l s, and has lectured at
more than 300 universities in a
dozen countries. Rifkin is per-
haps best known for writing 14
books examining the impact of
scientific and technological
changes on the economy, t h e
w o r k f o r c e, society and the envi-
r o n m e n t . One of his internatio-
nal bestsellers The End of Work
( P u t n a m ,1 9 9 5 ) , is widely credi-
ted for shaping today’s debate
on corporate downsizing and
t e c h n o l o g y ’s role in displacing
the workforce.
In his latest book,The Biotech
Century: Harnessing the Gene and
Remaking the World ( Ta r c h e r / P u t-
n a m ,1 9 9 8 ) , Rifkin focuses on the
negative implications of new
genetic technologies which he
feels have been largely ignored in
public debates.The result is a frigh-
tening view of a “ b i o - i n d u s t r i a l
w o r l d ” and an explanation of
genetic commerce which has been
criticized as an unfounded back-
lash against science.
“I was raised as a reformed
J e w,”Rifkin says.“I culturally iden-
tify with that but I am not reli-
g i o u s. For me, visiting the Nazi
concentration camp at Dachau as
a young man proved to be a defi-
ning experience. . . . We all want
to make sure that such things
never happen again.But we also
have to understand that they can
and do happen in ways we don’t
suspect. That is why I have spent
so much time focusing on how
eugenicism is now becoming com-
mercial and marke t - d r i v e n . If there
is an enemy, it is all of us who, for
good reasons, want healthy
babies.” ■

emits green light in the dark.

The most chilling
prospect of all is
letting the
marketplace and
consumers decide
the future

tunity to deal with the changing powe r
r e l ationships and ask what we wa n t .
We have to see past the myths that
science is value-free and technology is
n e u t r a l . If you start with the idea that the
life science corp o r ate agenda is simply
the next stage in evo l u t i o n – t h at just
because we can do something means that
we should or will do it–then there is no
point in having a debat e .
By recognizing the power of the new
t e c h n o l o gi e s , we should ask: is that appli-
c ation an appropri ate use of power? Is
t h at power manageable or uncontrol-
lable? Is that power going to potentially
foreclose our options or the options of
those not yet born ?
■ Aren’t you being rather optimistic? Don’t
you think that the lack of debate reflects
a serious flaw in society’s institutions?
I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist.
I don’t know if this generation will do the
right thing. But I am hopeful that it will.
It can create different avenues for change
instead of relying on the institutions of
society which maintain and represent the
s t atus quo.
H owe ve r , activism is not just about
shouting from the rooftops. Our passion
and intuition have to be built into an
intellectual framewo r k .We must not only
h ave a basis for discussion but an alter-
n at i ve vision.
■ Do you believe that public opinion will
have the sway needed for a soft path to
the biotech century?
I am saying that there is no public opinion
yet. Once the focus shifts to genetic com-
m e r c e , d e b ate will escalate exponen-
tially–not just on the part of activists bu t
also within industry.This is not just big cor-
porations against the citizens–there will be
a push and pull in the marketplace.
In agri c u l t u r e , for example, there will
be a major battle between organic pro-
d u c e rs and distri bu t o rs and the biotech
companies for consumers. The same will
be seen with medicine and health. T h e
p h a rmaceutical companies are going to
push hard path drugs (which I don’t
n e c e s s a rily oppose) and further down the
line somatic and germ-line therapy. O n
the other side, the insurance companies
will push to use the same science to pro-
duce sophisticated preve n t i ve health care
r ather than paying for expensive dru g s
and therapies to heal the sick.
■ Does UNESCO have a role to play in the
debate?
It would be interesting if UNESCO could
p r ovide a galvanizing place so that the non-
g ove rnmental organizations could have
more sway. UNESCO doesn’t necessari l y
h ave to take a position but through the Inter-
n ational Bioethics Committee it could offer
a forum to debate the complexities of these
issues. ■
