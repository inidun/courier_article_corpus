‘I f you want to eat an elephant,you can’t
do it in one mouthful,” s ays Noah
S a m a r a .“ You have to eat it bit by bit.”
For the past seven ye a rs ,he has been using this
little-by-little approach to spread digital radio
by satellite around the wo r l d .
With an almost missionary zeal and
dogged skill, M r. Samara heads
Wo r l d s p a c e , a company whose aim is to
b ring the rich man’s radio to an audience of
the poor.The project was initially designed
for A f rica but later expanded to include the
more economically bu oyant countries of
the South.
Worldspace will provide a broad range
of programmes transmitted digitally and by
s at e l l i t e , with CD-quality sound, to four
billion people who live in developing coun-
t ri e s. Each satellite will carry three gr o u p s
of 100 frequencies, making it possible to
transmit around 100 stereo channels. T h i s
is a revolution in regions where the choice
is still ve ry limited (one station for eve ry
30,000 people in North A m e ri c a , c o m p a-
red to just one for eve ry two million in the
Third Wo r l d ) . “ We want to create a show-
case for local cultures,” s ays Samara, a
f o rt y - o n e - year-old A m e rican Muslim of
Sudanese-Ethiopian ori gi n .“ To d ay the sta-
tions of the North dominate the South. B u t
I’m sure amazing things are happening in
K e nya which would interest people in
S e n e g a l , for example.”
The programmes are picked up by
small portable receive rs with a tiny sat e l l i t e
antenna and, b e ginning in the year 2000, a
colour screen for multimedia (wo r d s , p i c-
tures and sound). The receive rs can be
plugged into a personal computer and
r e c e i ve personal messages. Four major
Japanese companies—Hitachi, M at s u s h i t a ,
S a nyo and Victor—recently signed deals to
m a n u facture and sell the devices.
Washington-based Worldspace has rai-
sed $850 million from inve s t o rs , w h o s e
identity is a closely-guarded secret, o r d e r e d
three big satellites from the French firm
A l c atel and signed launch contracts with
A ri a n e s p a c e . The first satellite will go into
orbit over A f rica in October 1998 and the
t wo others over Asia and Latin A m e rica in
1 9 9 9 .
“The appealing thing about Wo r l d s p a c e
is that they really know how to sell their
p r o d u c t ,” enthuses A rnaud Littardi, h e a d
of intern ational affa i rs
at Radio France
I n t e rn at i o n a l . “ T h e
c o m b i n ation of sat e l l i t e
and digital technology
is where the future
l i e s ,” s ays Littardi.“ B u t
there are three big question marks. F i rs t , we
c a n ’t be sure of how good reception will be
in urban areas. The signal can be blocked
by bu i l d i n g s , tunnels and so on.Wo r l d s p a c e
s ays there are solutions, such as eart h -
based retransmission of the signal.” But this
would make the system too expensive .
The second, perhaps most import a n t
q u e s t i o n , is whether people will buy the
r e c e i ve rs. “ I t ’s a gamble because all new
technology penetrates the market at the
t o p, in the rich countri e s , and then spreads
d ow n wa r d s , first to the elites in the poor
c o u n t ri e s , and then to the rest of the popu-
l at i o n ,” s ays Littardi. “ Worldspace is try i n g
to do the opposite. It will all depend on the
selling price of the receive rs.”
Samara reckons that the consumer will
h ave to pay about $200 to start with,
“which is an astronomical sum for most
A f ri c a n s. But even if the price never drops,
there are already 300 million households
which can afford it in the area we ’re cove-
ri n g . And in five ye a rs , it should be selling
for under $50.”
L a s t l y, s ay s
L i t t a r d i , “ h ow much
are the broadcasters
willing to pay? Renting
space on all three sat e l-
lites will cost us seve r a l
million dollars a ye a r.
Such an investment will only pay off if we
can resolve the first two questions. So we ’r e
waiting to see what happens.”
T h e y ’re not the only ones. Wo r l d s p a c e
has already rented out frequencies to seve-
ral national radio networks and signed part-
n e rship agreements with major media
gr o u p s , but most broadcasters still have to
be conv i n c e d .“ We ’ ve negotiated less than a
fifth of our capacity,” s ays Samara. “ We
s t a rt turning a profit when we can rent out
a frequency at $50 an hour. But we ’re also
counting on income from things like agr e e-

S a t e l l i t e s for the South
Beaming multimedia radio by satellite to the four billion
people living in the South is even more challenging than it
sounds.
'The combination of
satellite and digital
technology is where the
future lies'

ments with broadcasters to share adve rt i-
sing revenue or from selling subscri p t i o n s
to personalized serv i c e s.”
He also seems to be counting on bac-
king from intern ational donors , thanks to
the Worldspace Fo u n d at i o n , c r e ated in
1997 with a $1.5-million corp o r ate dona-
t i o n . The aim is to find part n e rs to make
five per cent of the frequencies available for
e d u c ational and development progr a m m e s ,
s t a rting in A f ri c a .
“ Wo r l d s p a c e , UNESCO and other
i n t e rn ational bodies, n o n - g ove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations and gove rnments are wo r k i n g
to identify the best programmes to promo-
te peace, h e a l t h , and env i r o n m e n t a l
c o n c e rns as well as the rights of women and
c h i l d r e n ,” s ays Samara. Easier said than
d o n e .
B e rnard Loing, president of A t e n a , a
distance education organizat i o n , cites the
Olympus satellite experiment in Europe in
the late 1980s. “ We paid a lot of attention to
w h at we were offeri n g, but not much to the
needs and wishes of our potential custo-
m e rs.We knew how to beam a second-ye a r
u n i ve rsity chemistry course but we didn’t
k n ow who would be interested in receiving
i t . We can’t do that kind of thing again.
P r o gramming must be geared to demand.”
This is why Worldspace is consulting
e d u c ation ministers in A f ri c a , as well as
e x p e rts and professionals in the communi-
c ations industry. No one knows what the
p r o gramme content will be ye t , but the
p ri o rities have been set, including training
t e a c h e rs in remote areas and small com-
munities and continuing vo c ational trai-
n i n g, especially for women who want to set
up small bu s i n e s s e s. H owe ve r , Wo r l d s p a c e
has yet to finalize any financing agr e e m e n t s
on renting frequencies or buying the recei-
ve rs. . . . ■
