IN a tiny Italian village, soobscure that it is not even
listed in one standard Italian
atlas, a country schoolteacher has
developed the native capacity for
artistic expression among. the
children of peasants to so high a
degree as to interest the educators
of many countries. Their interest
is not limited to the artistic
productions of the children, though
these are in some cases remarkable,
for Maria Maltoni has used art
primarily to encourage the total
development of her pupils, to help
make them good citizens and
self-confident, well-adjusted adults.
Signora Maltoni, a gracious
white-haired woman, has been
teaching the peasant children of
the Tuscany village of San Gersole
for some twenty years, with an
inspired disregard for conventional
teaching methods.
Although it is only a few miles
from Florence, that great art
centre that still lives in the
glorious past of the Renaissance,
San Gersole is far removed from
the sophistication of the Florentine
civilization.
An exhibition held in Milan
recently of the drawings and
diaries of Signora Maltoni's pupils,
none of whom is over 12 years of
age, drew wide attention in a
country where artistic talent is
taken almost for granted. These
drawings and diaries were compiled
into a book, edited by Signora
Máltoni,"I Diarl di San Gersole"
(Casa Editrice,"11 Libre"Florence
1949), that has received such
acclaim by educators and peda-
gogues that it is being translated
into many languages.
Books Have Their Place
SIGNORA Maltoni has useddrawings, not as an end in
itself, but as a means to the
self-development of her pupils.
She believes that education which
depends almost wholly on book-
learning fails in its purpose, that
an instructor must lead his pupils
on to the path of a true knowledge
of himself, of his abilities, and the
best use of them.
covering largely through the
medium of drawing.
In this ; combined þrocess of
observation and expression, the
children also experience what has
been called the divine discontept
of creative workers. They must
learn more, not on orders of a
task-master, abut because their
own drive for learning has been
released. Thus they come to their
books with passion and to their
teacher as a kindly guide.

while, in regard to written compo-
sition, this is harder to achieve.
The spontaneous tdescription of
what the children see and know
precedes the study of their books
and lessons ; and the schoolteacher
only intervenes when necessary to
broader and correct what the
children have set forth from their
own knowledge.
"The stories of the most impor-
Books certainly and their place
in her teaching, and when the time
comes the books are perused with
eagerness and not reluctantly. In
the case or ; science teaching, for
example, the children begin by
observing the phenomena around
them-the action of a see-saw,
the formation of a flower. Search-
ing deeply into the fascinating
realities about them, learning for
them begins with discovery. When
a child discovers something, he has
an impulse to share it with others
- lto tell'what he has found'and
what it means to him. Signora
Maltoni's pupils tell their stories
about the world they are dis-
With rockets roaring into the air and wheels bursting in a shower of coloured stars, this drawing
by a child in the fifth grade shows the successful methods of teaching used by Signora Maltoni.
All the essentIal details have been clearly observed and, as usual in children's drawings of this
kind, the figures drawn in profile precisely depict purpose and action, while the whole picture
conveys the excitment of the brilliant and noisy fireworks display.
tant daily happenings that each
child tells me every day permit me,
as every'teacher must, to learn all
about them, their minds and
surroundings ; and also make it
possible for me to influence them
in their jamily situation. Thus
educational activity'can be carried
out tactfully on the basis of the
precise facts rather than that of
general theories. Both drawing
and composition are effective
means of expression that permit
me, among other things, to learn
the nature of individual characters
and the degree of mental develop-
ment in every phase of its forma-
tion. By means of drawing, I am
able to teach precision and sureness
of thought, hand and eye."
Learning is more of a game than
a task in Maria Maltoni's one-room
schoolhouse. Situated upstairs in
her own home, the room is bright
and cheerful, its shelves laden with
books and children's classics, its
walls covered With her pupil's
drawings.
No Rigid Sclaedule
DESPITE her preoccupation withart, other subjects are not
neglected in her programme.
History, as she teaches it, becomes
a fascinating story. Her teaching
of the classics has made them alive
and popular. Despite her scorn
for standard textbooks, she uses
them when necessary. There is no
rigid schedule in her school day.
Each pupil pursues his individual
tasks, undisturbed by his comrades.
While one is occupied drawing
from live models such as insects or
plants (the children are taught
that all living creatures must later
be released to freedom), another
will be intent upon writing his
observations and thoughts of the
previous day ; while still another is
reciting poetry.
This concept of education which
stresses the moulding of individual
character, as opposed to that based
upon a conglomerate accumulation
of bits of knowledge, has long since
been adopted in the most advanced
schools of great urban centres.
Signora Maltoni has proved that it
is workable in the villages of the
world, even in poor ones where the
schooling period is limited. She is
convinced that it is the only system
whereby peasant children, whose
average formal schooling is res-
tricted to five years, can achieve a
foundation of learning, and a
lasting love for"education"as a
part of their lives.
