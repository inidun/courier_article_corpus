Three highland villages
in Japan
by Hidetoshi Saito and Nobuko Inaba
Three farming villages in a
remote valley in the high
central mountains of Japan's main
island, Honshu, were added to the
World Heritage List in 1995. The
villages, Ogimachi, Ainokura and
Suganuma, are located in a region
historically known as Shirakawa-
go and Gokayama, where the
mountains rise to 1,500 metres. The
region is crossed by the Sho River,
which flows from south to north
towards the Sea of Japan, and
because of the steepness of the
mountain slopes, most of its vil¬
lages grew up on a narrow strip of
land along the river valley.
This is also a region of partic¬
ularly heavy snowfall. In winter
cold winds blow in from China,
picking up moisture while cross-

hills above the

ing the Sea of Japan. Until quite
recently, before long tunnels were
constructed and bridges were built
across the deep valleys, contacts
with the outside world were very
limited. Because of the difficulty
of access, the area was once known
as "Japan's last unexplored region".
These geological and climatic
conditions gave rise to a unique
form of architecture. Larger than the
national average, the local farmhouses
are entirely constructed of wood,
each one being covered with a three-
sided, gabled thatched roof. This
building style is called "Gassho"
("joined hands" in Japanese) because

the steep slope of the roof recalls the
position of the hands in Buddhist
prayer. The spacious attics were often
used by farmers to raise silkworms.
Clustered in small villages sur¬
rounded by fields and woods, the
farmhouses help create a unique
landscape that is expressive of the
local culture
The houses are examples of
Japanese wooden house construc-

tion in its most highly developed
form, both in terms of structure
and construction methods and the
way in which internal space is used.
At the end of the nineteenth cen¬
tury there were still over 1,800 of



them in ninety-three villages in
the Shirakawa-go/Gokayama area.

changed the lifestyle in the moun¬
tains. Many of the traditional
houses disappeared, and many
unique village landscapes were
destroyed. In the last century 92
per cent of all Gassho-style houses
have been lost, mostly within a
quarter of a century.
Community spirit
In the 1970s, the villagers of Ogi¬
machi, Ainokura and Suganuma,
where Gassho-style houses had
survived in relatively good condi¬
tion, started a preservation move¬
ment in co-operation with the local
authorities. They felt that if they
failed to take action, their village
environment would be destroyed.
Wanting to preserve the entire vil¬
lage landscape and the surrounding
natural environment fields, canals,
roads and forests, as well as build¬
ings, the villagers established con¬
servation societies, and national
legal protection systems were intro¬
duced in each village. Subsequently
the three villages have been well
maintained under the legal and tra¬
ditional protection systems.

the ground floor by a

the 1970s for raising

Each village has a mutual help
organization called the kumi, com¬
prising neighbouring households
and operating under a co-operative
system which was established in the
Edo Period (17th-19th centuries)
and still functions today. The kumi
organizes seasonal and daily tasks,
performed in co-operation or
shared in rotation, such as cutting
grass along the mountain road¬
ways, cleaning the canals, fire-
watching, and performing roles in
religious functions. Another tradi¬
tional mutual help system, the cus¬
tom oiyui or koryaku, comes into
play for marriage and funeral cere¬
monies and for projects such as
house-building and roof thatching.
This social system based on
mutual co-operation was essential
for survival in a high mountain
area with a production capacity
severely limited by natural condi¬
tions, but its evolution was also
doubtless influenced by the strong
spiritual links between the people.
Thanks to the legal and tradi¬
tional systems by which they arc
now protected, the villages of Ogi¬
machi, Ainokura and Suganuma
have succeeded in fully retaining
their time-honoured spirit.
