G The coordinator of the national 
agency for the management and 
quality of education, Jose Francisco 
Puac, is visibly delighted by the 
success of “Save the first year”, 
pointing out that out of the 9000 
children who took advantage of 
the program this year, 63% were 
“caught up” and admitted to the 
following class. In 2007, the pro-
gram cost US$62,000. 
Parents and children have be-
come aware of the importance of 
education,” says Francisco Puac, 
explaining that dropping out and 
repeating in school before the 
implementation of the program 
were due to teachers’ insufficient 
training and the lack of family sup-
port. From now on, he adds, “the 
essential remedy is that teachers 
are ready to surmount these diffi-
culties,” thanks to financial incen-
uatemala, a country facing high 
rates of illiteracy, has found a genui- 
nely effective solution through the 
program “Save the first year”, which 
can play a determining role in the 
success or failure of thousands of 
children living in poverty. Taking the 
country “out of the darkness of illi- 
teracy” is the goal of the organizers 
of the project, which was devised 
by the United States Agency 
for International Development 
and implemented throughout the 
country since 2004 by the Ministry 
of Education. 
The strategy consisting of “catch-
ing up” children who fail their first 
year has had positive repercus-
sions, as much for pupils and their 
parents as for the teachers them-
selves, who see it as source of in-
spiration for improving the quality 
of education in the country. 
tives allocated by the Ministry of 
Education, such as for instance the 
scholarships available for teachers 
and students.
The poorest 
have priority
At the beginning the program 
covered the 331 municipalities 
comprising Guatemala. This year, it 
concentrated on 41 communities, 
considered the poorest “with 
high rates of malnutrition, as well 
as health, education and human 
development problems.” 
According to Francisco Puac, 
these communities were selected 
because they had the highest 
drop-out and repeating levels, up 
to 50% of the children inscribed in 
school. 
He says that children who fail 
their first year “remain stigmatized” 
and are doomed to an uncertain 
future. This slows social and eco-
nomic development in the country, 
30% of whose nearly 13 million in-
habitants are illiterate. 
“The success of the program 
is due to the interest shown by 
firSt yEar of School  
crucial for the rest  
of a child’s life
        Support for teachers, evaluation of pupils’ progress, follow-up for children outside 
               the classroom, and parents’ participation in their children’s education – 
                          these elements are key to the success of the campaign 
             “Save the first year” in Guatemala. Simple but effective strategies.

parents of pupils and to the support 
of the authorities,” echoes Olga 
Monterroso, a headmistress in 
San Marcos department. “These 
children no longer repeat their 
first year and are no longer among 
Guatemala’s illiterates.” Her region 
scored highest this year by 
“catching up” 82% of the 1700 
children who benefited from the 
program, in which six municipalities 
and 375 teachers took part. 
One asset of the innovative project 
is that it motivates children to con-
tinue their schooling, instead of their 
parents sending them out to work 
in the fields for the boys, or mak-
ing them do housework for the girls, 
given the conditions of extreme pov-
erty in which they live. 
Oscar Ovando, a headmaster in 
Petén department, which borders 
Belize and Mexico, is also satisfied 
with the impact of the program, 
because it really does help pre-
vent children from dropping out or 
repeating the first year. He has even 
asked for the program to become in-
stitutional, given that Alvaro Colom, 
a Social-Democrat elected for four 
years, officially begins his term on 
14 January 2008. 
Ovando explains that out of the 
2815 children inscribed in schools 
in the municipality of Sayaxche, 
775 participated in the program 
and 175 succeeded in going up 
to the next grade. “That proves the 
method is effective,” he concludes. 
“It’s very important because for a 
child to make it past the first year 
can determine whether his life is a 
success or a failure.”
