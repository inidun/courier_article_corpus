in search of
a new law
of the sea

MARIA EDUARDA GONCALVES, Portu¬
guese jurist, is a member of the Portuguese
delegation at the Third United Nations Confe¬
rence on the Law of the Sea. A staff member
of the department of international relations
and co-operation at the State Secretariat for
Fisheries, Lisbon, she is the author of many
studies on the law of the sea and the protect¬
ion of the environment.
FOR centuries the oceans were
regarded as "belonging to no
one" (res nullius) and as sub¬
ject to the principle of the freedom of
the seas enunciated in 1609 by an
exponent of international law, the
celebrated Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius.
The eventual result was that they
were taken over, exploited and divid¬
ed up by the then powerful mari¬
time nations which set about build¬
ing navies for the discovery and
appropriation of "new worlds" and
unknown seas.
With the passage of time, and
primarily for reasons of defence.
national custom and practice found
formal expression in the rule that a
coastal state had sovereign rights up
to a distance of three miles from its
shores, the maximum range of a
ball fired from a cannon of that
period. Beyond that limit the prin¬
ciple of freedom of the seas applied.
More recently, the long-accepted
idea that the seas are an inexhaus¬
tible source of living resources
and a suitable receptacle for all the
waste and rubbish dumped into
them has been challenged. Some
developing countries have taken
unilateral action to extend their

H
zones of sovereignty to the 200-
mile limit so as to exploit and pro¬
tect their own fishing stocks. Other,
industrially developed, countries
have extended their jurisdiction to
the continental shelf in the hope of
exploiting its mineral resources.
The United Nations organized two
Conferences on the Law of the
Seaone in 1958 and the other in
1960at which the main concern
was to establish limits for the terri¬
torial sea and to lay down prin¬
ciples for the conservation of the
seas and their biological resources,
in addition to discussing more tra
ditional problems relating to ship¬
ping and communications.
But the seas continued to be seen >
as a potential source of exploitable
wealth, providing they are properly
managed. Recent investigations of
the sea-bed beyond the zones of
national jurisdiction and at great
depths have resulted in the discovery
of mineral resources such as nodules
of manganese and have led indus¬
trially developed countries to create
new technologies for exploiting them.
It was with that specific prospect
ahead that in 1967 Malta's repre
sentative at the United Nations Gen¬
eral Assembly proposed that imme¬
diate steps be taken to regulate the
use of sea-bed mineral resources and
ensure that they were exploited for
peaceful purposes and for the benefit
of all mankind.
It was feared that with the aid of
technological progress, the indus¬
trially developed nations, enjoying
strategic superiority, would scramble
for resources of this kind located
beyond the limits of national juris¬
diction and use them for their own



exclusive benefit, and to the detri- 1
ment of the developing countries. I

> The Third United Nations Con¬
ference on the Law of the Sea began
in 1974. It largely stemmed from
the need to fill gaps in existing inter¬
national legislation which did not
cover these new uses of the sea.
However, by this time many new
States which had played no part in
the formulation of traditional mari¬
time law had achieved independence.
They had also become aware of the
importance of their offshore resources
for providing food supplies and as
a means of economic and social
development.
Growing attention was also being
paid to problems of protecting the
sea's living resources and the ma¬
rine environment and of defending
national sovereignty. All these fac¬
tors led the U.N. Member States to
agree on the need for negotiations to
create a legal framework for dealing
with such questions and to ensure
that the uses of the oceans should
not become a constant source of
tension and conflict but develop
harmoniously in a climate of mutual
respect.
One of the major themes under
discussion is the prospection and
utilization of the minerals of the sea¬
bed beyond the area of national
jurisdiction. The international com¬
munity now accepts that these re¬
sources are part of the common heri¬
tage of mankind and should there¬
fore not be appropriated by only
those countries which have the im¬
mediate capacity to extract them.
They should be administered by an
international authority, still to be set
up, in which all States would be
represented on an equal footing.
The proposed International Sea-
Bed Authority would be a revolu¬
tionary innovation within the United
Nations family. It would be gov¬
erned by the new concepts under¬
lying international relations: the
exploitation of the area beyond na¬
tional jurisdiction should be for peace¬
ful purposes only, and the benefits
shared equitably among all States,
with particular emphasis on the needs
of the developing countries.
However, the industrially-dev¬
eloped countries have reservations
about some of these proposals: in
the last few years multinational com¬
panies have made massive invest¬
ments in perfecting technologies for
exploiting the sea-bed nodules as a
major source of manganese, copper,
nickel, cobalt and other minerals.
On another important questionthe
adoption of a 200-mile economic
zonethere is more or less general
agreement. In this zone coastal
States would have various powers
including exclusive jurisdiction over
living resources, with the right to
determine the size of the total allow¬
able catch and the unused surplus
that could be granted to another
state by inter-party agreement.
The 200-mile limit would be a
step towards better redistribution of
the uses of the living resources of the
sea, by restricting the major sea
powershitherto guilty of over-fishing
many speciesin their access to the
coastal waters of other states.
Contrary to what has happened up
to now, coastal States would at last
have control over the resources of
their offshore waters in a 200-mile
zoneand this, for the developing
countries, is a matter of fundamental
importance.
In fact, with this extension of na¬
tional jurisdiction, one-third of the
oceans will cease to be considered as
the high seas (subject to the principle
of "freedom of the seas") and will
come under the coastal States' juris¬
diction.
The international and regional
fishing organizations to which inter¬
ested States belong, and which are
responsible for managing the re¬
sources of specific areas, will con¬
tinue to play a big role in promoting
scientific co-operation, collecting and
distributing information and also in
developing technical assistance to
enable coastal States to make full
use of the resources in their zones.
This co-operation is particularly
necessary since some migratory spe¬
cies such as tunny move over a wide
range through the economic zones of
several States.
Agreement on these issues will
only be possible if other States are
given certain vital guarantees such as
freedom of navigation, overflight and
under-water cable-laying for commu¬
nication, as long as these guarantees
in no way prevent the coastal States
SIX MILLION TONS OF MINERALS A YEAR
Vast areas of the ocean are strewn with nodules like those shown
above, containing minerals such as manganese, iron, copper and
nickel. As much as 6 million tons of nodules may accumulate
annually in this way in the Pacific Ocean alone. To exploit the
world's several billion tons of ocean bed nodules with their mineral
wealth new techniques are currently being developed. Left,
scientists examine samples of ocean sediments. Nodules can be
seen embedded on a "core" raised from the sea bed at a depth of
4,000 m. in the Madagascar Basin (Indian Ocean) during a French
océanographie expedition in May 1976.

In 1974, world fish
production exceeded
60 million tons.
About 90 per cent of
the catch came from
areas of the "High
Seas" which may
one day become
"economic zones"
under the exclusive
jurisdiction of coastal
States. For many
countries fishing is a
major food resource.
Among them is Sri
Lanka whose fishing
fleet numbers the

from exercising their new rights.
This new legal order of the seas
would be part and parcel of the effort
to establish a New International
Economic Order based on internatio¬
nal co-operation and mutual respect
and designed to reduce the present
inequalities between developing coun¬
tries and those of the industrialized
world.
In seeking to include the law of the
sea in the New International Econo¬
mic Order," the Third Conference came
up against another major issue in
addition to the question of giving
priority to the developing countries.
This was the problem of landlocked
countries and those which are at a
disadvantage because of the small-
ness of their coastline.
These countries are struggling to
achieve recognition of special rights
giving them access to the economic
zones of coastal States in their re¬
gion, as well as the right to exploit
under favourable conditions the re¬
sources of these zones, or at least
to have preferential access to the
unused surpluses of coastal States.
As for the protection of the ma¬
rine environment, especially against
pollution, the extension of the juris¬
diction of the coastal States to 200
miles makes it necessary to redefine
their competence in this field and
harmonize their control standards
with those adopted regionally or
internationally.
The aim is to prevent pollution
caused by oil tankers and other ves¬
sels or due to operations involving
the discharge of pollutants, and to
prevent or reduce damage to health
and to living resources, and at least
ensure that accidents in one area
do not have repercussions in other
parts of the ocean.
The developing coastal States also
seek recognition of the right to
control océanographie research by
ships and organizations from other
countries in their coastal waters and
to have such research placed under
their jurisdiction. They are also
demanding that their consent should
be required in cases where the re¬
sults of this research have a direct
impact on their own marine resources,
or are aimed at practical applications.
It is claimed that the coastal States
should thus have the right to take part
in formulating research programmes
and to participate in their execution,
and have access to the results and
their analysis.

However, the major powers still
champion the principle of complete
freedom of (non-applied) research,
and view control by the coastal
States as a threat to science and
the acquisition of new knowledge.
It is clear that regional and global
bodies such as the Intergovernmental
Océanographie Commission could
play an important role in promoting
agreement between the countries
concerned.
Generally speaking, the developing
countries hope to benefit from the
new regime for the oceans as a
means of hastening their economic
and social development. However, ¡
they are hampered by the lack ofw
adequate infrastructures, of scientific F

, and technical knowledge and a shor¬
tage of capital, to say nothing of the
limits imposed by the huge cost of
the technologies developed in the
industrialized countries.
The costs are particularly prohibi¬
tive when it comes to exploiting min¬
eral resources, whereas the technolo¬
gies needed for exploiting living
resources are within the reach of
many coastal countries.
These points have been intensively
discussed by the U.N. Conference
and there is every reason to believe
that the future Convention on the
Law of the Sea will cover them by
adopting principles which encourage
the transfer of technology, although
the industrialized countries are mak¬
ing a stand in favour of what they
regard as fair payment for patents
and equipment.
As can be anticipated in matters
of such complexity in which such im¬
portant interests are at stake, one
can expect divergences regarding in¬
terpretation and even disputes regard¬
ing application of the future regime
of the oceans.
The final agreement on these ques¬
tions will thus depend on compro¬
mise and the setting up of internatio¬
nal machinery for forestalling or sett¬
ling any disputes that may arise.
Two recent international disputes
from which useful lessons can be
drawn are the "cod war" between
Iceland and the United Kingdom and
the tension between Greece and
Turkey over the delimitation of zones
of jurisdiction in which mineral re¬
sources are thought to exist.
It is essential to settle such dis¬
putes by peaceful means in the spirit
of the United Nations Charter, if mu¬
tual co-operation and understanding
in the international community are
not to be impaired and the solution
of practical problems posed by the
exploitation of the sea is not to be
jeopardized.
Thus the Conference has studied
the various mechanisms that States
could use to solve these problems,
including such traditional ones as
arbitration and the International
Court of Justice at The Hague, as
well as new ones such as the Law
of the Sea Tribunal (still to be set up)
in which the developing countries
would be well represented.
Delay in drawing up the Conven¬
tion would undoubtedly lead many
States to establish unilaterally their
own laws on the exploitation of the
sea's resources. Various countries
have indeed recently extended their
areas of national jurisdiction and
transformed them into exclusive eco¬
nomic zones.
Conversely, there is the risk that
big multinational companies would
not wait for the end of the negotia¬
tions and would instead press for
immediate exploitation of the sea¬
bed without limits or conditions and
for the sole benefit of those who
have least need of these resources.

A situation of that kind could well
generate tensions and aggravate
disputes within the international
community.
In practice, the process of creating
a new law of the sea is already und¬
erway. It is to be hoped that it will
be influenced by the concepts of a
New Economic Order and will be prov¬
ided with institutions that guarantee
its application for the benefit of the
international community as a whole
and Jaking also into account legiti¬
mate national interests.
