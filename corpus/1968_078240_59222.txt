HE city of ten million
inhabitants is an organism which has
appeared only in the latter half of the
present century, and as such it is a
historical hovelty. Tokyo, New York,
London, Paris and Moscow have
passed or are fast approaching the
ten million mark. To remain alive and
grow they must have the mobility and
structure befitting our modern times.
"The technological revolution of the
late 20th century has resulted in a
shift in the city from factory and
industrial occupations to tertiary
occupations such as sales and services
which have become the pivotal
functions of the large metropolis of
today. The mass introduction of
automobiles into the city has further¬
more completely altered the relation¬
ship between streets and buildings.
"The city of ten million is an
aggregation of a moving, flowing
population that demands more direct
communication than ever before. But
today, not only Tokyo but London,

the Tokyo of tomorrow, distributed along
a central civic axis across Tokyo Bay.
Axis is divided into a series of ring units
or cycles to house commercial and other
offices. A three-level road system each
with ten lanes is envisaged for vehicles
travelling at 60, 90, and 120 kilometres/hour,
and would permit a flow of 200,000 cars
an hour, far higher than any highway
system now in existence. Clusters
extending perpendicularly from axis over
Bay are residential areas (seen also in
photo page 56). Two airports can be seen
in Bay, one for national traffic, the other
for international flights. Far left of Bay
would be reserved for industrial zones.

workshops.
Paris and other large cities are being
strangulated and paralyzed by a
structure that dates back to the Middle
Ages. This is the centripetal or radial
pattern in which all traffic moves
toward the centre of the city.
"There is only one way to save
Tokyo and that is to create a new
urban structure, a new spatial order,
in which the urban system, the traffic
system, and the architectural system
of the city are organically unified. We
have proposed that the antiquated
radial structure of Tokyo be replaced
by an elongated linear axis of
communication, to be developed out
across Tokyo Bay."
The man speaking is Kenzo Tange,
one of the world's most celebrated
and imaginative architects, with a long
list of honours and awards to his
credit.
He has won international recognition
for his designs for the Peace Memorial
Hall in Hiroshima, the Tokyo City Hall,
and the Kagawa Prefectural Office

Below, view of portion of residential area over Tokyo Bay. Each unit would
be composed of a platform with the buildings rising above it like curved triangles,
leaving the centre free for shopping centres, parks and squares, car parks, schools,
etc. At certain levels concrete platforms would extend from side to side to house
gas, water and electricity lines. On these platforms each individual could build
a house to his own taste. Tange estimates that over 5 million persons could be
housed in these residential areas. One side of central axis can be seen at right
showing cyclical roads forming a chain turning right and left and crossing up and
down at cubic crossings. Each of the axis roads is thus a complete circle. Above,

as "a superb fusion of the technology
of modern architecture and Japanese
traditional elements." He is the
Architectural Director for EXPO '70,
the first world exposition to be held
in Asia, and has just completed the
master plan for the exhibition grounds
on Osaka's northeastern suburbs.
The author of books on the Katsura
Imperial Villa, the Grand Shrines at
Ise, and other masterpieces of
Japanese architecture, Kenzo Tange is
also professor of architecture at Tokyo
University.
The 54-year-old architect maintains
his off-the-campus offices and work¬
shops on the two top floors of a seven
storey building only a few streets
away from one of his most celebrated
creations the National Gymnasium, a
monumental piece of architecture
acclaimed by the participants at the
Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964.
This imposing structure, with its
gigantic sloping roof, reflects Tange's
aspiration for an architecture in har¬
mony with the magnitude, rhythm and
energy of the large modern metroplis.
Although the shape of the building is
extremely modern, Japanese and
foreign architects have seen in the
two interlocked arcs of the National
Gymnasium and the spiral annex of
the Small Gymnasium next to it,
symbolic crests of traditional Japan.
The beauty and originality of the
edifice won him the Olympic Diploma
of Merit.
F<OR years Kenzo Tange's
main concern has been with archi¬
tecture in its relationship with urban¬
ization. His counsel has been sought
by city planners in Europe and
America. In 1965, the Yugoslav
Government chose his blueprint for
the reconstruction of earthquake-
devastated Skopje, and a completely
new city is now emerging on the
site of the capital of Macedonia
according to his plan, under a 15-year
project. He is currently at work with
Italian experts on a new plan for the
city of Bologna in northern Italy.
Tange's "Plan for Tokyo", first put
forward in 1960, offers a revolutionary
approach to modern urbanization,
viewed not in terms of mere
architectural form or even a complex
architectural ensemble but as a civic
axis of communication. It is this
communication axis that Kenzo Tange
sees as the heart and symbol of the
contemporary metropolis, just as the
cathedral was the heart and symbol
of the city of the Middle Ages.
"In an age when cities developed
around central squares or plazas,"
Professor Tange explained to this
writer, "when people lived within the
limits prescribed by regional societies,
the central square was the nucleus of
communication, and the cathedral, the
castle and the city hall were the
spiritual supports well as the
symbols of urban life. Horses and

past rows of buildings must have
formed a very harmonious ensemble."
But now, he points out, mass
communication "has released the city
from the bonds of a closed
organization, and is changing the
structure of the city Itself. In the
society with an open organization, and
in the large metropolis which is the
pivot of this organization, the mobility
required for individual communication
is assuming ever larger proportions.
This, added to the ebb and flow of
commuters into the centre of town
every day, has led to the extreme
confusion and paralysis we are
witnessing in the large cities of
today."
If the various functions of a great
city were distributed along a line,
Tange points out, communications
linking them could be carried out in
a minimum of time by movement along
that line.
The linear axis would start from the
present centre of Tokyo and gradually
extend out in a series of cycles or
units over the waters of Tokyo Bay
until it linked up, in the final stage,
with the opposite shore.
The pivotal functions of the city
would be concentrated along the
central axis. Highways would be
suspended about 40 metres above the
ground and 50 metres above Tokyo
Bay. In other words, the highways
would be huge suspension bridges
running above the buildings with
supporting piers at intervals of
one kilometre.
A,L three-level transportation
system is envisaged in Kenzo Tange's
plan, each with ten lanes, for vehicles
moving at 60, 90 and 120 kilometres
an hour. The lowest (slowest) level
would have one link per kilometre
along the axis, the second level a link
every three kilometres (a monorail
suspended from this level is also
foreseen), and the third level a link
every nine kilometres. Traffic at all
Interchange points would move in the
same direction on all levels.
This system would permit a flow
of 200,000 cars per hour ten to thirty
times more than any high-speed
highway system now in existence. As
many as five million persons could
move along the axis in a single day
by using the various means of
transportation, which would fulfil the
needs of the 15 million inhabitants
Tokyo is expected to have in the next
twenty years.
To free the centre of Tokyo from
its present congestion, the monorail
lines would be linked to underground
and railroad station interchanges along
the axis. The construction of a large
new railroad station on the axis is
also foreseen.
A system of streets would extend
out from the axis in parallel lines,
leading into residential areas. This
can be clearly seen in the districts
built over the Bay of Tokyo (see photo
page 56). Tange foresees that within
twenty years some 5,000,000 people
will be living on the bay. Some of
the residential areas would stand on
reclaimed land, others on platforms
supported by piers sunk directly into
the ocean floor.
By building on the bay, Tange feels,
the people of Tokyo would rediscover
the sea, since Tokyo, which has lost
most of its coastal areas to factories,
would again become a seaside city.
"In this way," he says, "the ocean
would become not only a symbol of
our economic development but a
pleasant part of our daily environ¬
ment." In a sense therefore, Tange's
project calls for the creation of a new

archipelago on the scale of the modern
metropolis.
Tange's revolutionary plan for the
transformation of the radial city into
a linear metropolis along a central
civic axis has been inspired not only
by an analysis of the many complex
problems of modern urbanization but
by a detailed study of the evolution
and growth of living organisms in
nature.
The amoeba and other simple
organisms, he points out, have radial
centripetal forms, but more advanced
organisms such as the vertebrates
have linear bone structures with
parallel radiations.
Illl
HEN the living functions
of organisms differentiate and perform
the composite functions of life," he
explains, "the centripetal pattern
evolves into a system of parallel lines
grouped around an axis formed of
a spine and arteries. In like manner,
the process whereby a vertebrate body
hatches from an egg illustrates the
possibility of gradual development on
the part of a linear system."
Tange sees the city as a living,
growing organism which must be
flexible and expandable as its pattern
of life grows, becomes more complex
and expands. His civic axis system
is composed of unit cycles not unlike
the vertebrae in the spine. At each
stage of development the system is
complete, but it is always possible to
add other units.
Since elaborating his original plan
for the Tokyo metropolis in 1960,
Kenzo Tange has been closely studying
the most recent phenomenon of our
time the development of an even
higher complex of urban civilization:
the megalopolis. The growth of the
megalopolis in the world of tomorrow
is inevitable, he feels, with the rapid
rise in world population and the
increasing complexity of modern life.
"Thirty or forty years from now much
of the population of our planet will be
living in such huge urban complexes,"
he says.
Already Tokyo and Yokohama form
one large urban mass, with snarled
traffic making rapid communication
between the two centres well nigh
impossible. Already, too, thousands
of persons are commuting daily
between Osaka and Tokyo, over
300 miles (500 kilometres) away. The
day will soon come, he says, when
the whole area between Tokyo and
Osaka will form one vast megalopolis,
to which he refers as the "Tokaido
megalopolis."
The civic axis principle is the one
way, Tange maintains, to meet this
evolving situation and to avoid the
indescribable chaos which will surely
ensue if the radial-type megalopolis
is allowed to form. By adding unit
cycles, the Tokyo civic axis could
eventually be extended all the way to
Osaka to form one of the major
elements of
megalopolis.
the future Tokaido
T,ODAY we must face the
fact, Tange says, that the civilization
and economy of the world are about
to undergo a tremendous development,
and this demands a more dynamic style
to match the realities of the modern
metropolis. Urban architecture should
give an impression equal to such
colossal civil engineering projects as
super-highways, highspeed traffic
intersections, and the congested
population.
Today, he points out, our environ¬
ment has three scales: the human
scale, the mass human scale, and the
superhuman or technological scale.
Man himself continues to walk in steps
of a metre or so, to talk face to face
with his neighbours, and we are still
surrounded by the human scale which
can never change no matter how much
technology changes.

Architecture matched to the speed
and scale of our times
The plazas, cathedrals and small
houses of the Middle Ages had a mass
human scale which was suited to the
masses of the people gathered in the
urban centres, and harmonized with
the human scale of roads radiating
from them.
Today, however, huge highways,
carrying high-speed traffic have
introduced themselves into the old
system. They represent the super¬
human, technological scale which in
no way harmonizes with the archi¬
tecture of the late 19th century and
the first half of the 20th. When we
consider that our highways are built
for speeds exceeding 100 kilometres
an hour and our airports for speeds
scaled at 1,000 kilometres an hour, the
vastness of the new structures ceases
to seem vast.
But the individuality, freedom and
spontaneity of the human scale, Tange
points out, form an ever-increasing
antithesis to the superhuman tech¬
nological scale. Man desires more
and more to exercise his own
individual choice in matters concerning
houses, gardens, streets and plazas.
There are, therefore, two conflicting
extremes the major technological
structures, which while restricting
individual choice determine the system
of our new age, and the minor objects
used in our daily living which permit
the expression of free individual
choice. "The gap between the two,"
Tange says, "is gradually growing
deeper."
The important task before the
contemporary architect and designer
is to create a harmonious relationship,
an organic link, between these two
extremes, and thereby build a new
spatial order for our contemporary
cities.

N our plan," Tange con¬
tinued, there would be an order of pro¬
gression from the house to the play¬
ground for children, to the space for
quiet gatherings, to large open spaces,
to large-scale recreation and sports
centres; from schools to other
educational and cultural installations;
and from parking areas to trans¬
portation plazas to superhighways.
"Shopping areas, auditoriums and
the like would be distributed around
the surface of each unit area on the
same human scale as at present, and
there would be small streets for
pedestrians as well as large and small
plazas for crowds. These spaces
would be identical with the historical,
human spaces now in our cities. Our
plan, in effect, would provide for
architecture which would be compatible
with the speed and scale of our times
but which at the same time would
permit the continuation of our
historical urban life."
According to Tange, tradition in
culture and architecture is adapted to
the human scale, and would be very
much out of place if used on the super¬
human technological scale of super¬
highways, airport structures, etc.
It is 'within this framework that we
can better understand the change in
Kenzo Tange's thinking in the past
twelve years with regard to the place
of tradition in Japanese architecture.
T ANGE has often been
described as the outstanding Japanese
architect who has "succeeded in ac¬
complishing the union of the Japanese
tradition with modern architecture." In
1956, he published an article entitled:
"Creation in Present-Day Architecture
and the Japanese Architectural Trad¬
ition," which created quite a stir
amongst both Japanese and foreign
architects because of the negative
opinions he expressed about Japanese
tradition. He explained his ideas to
this writer in the following way:
"Immediately after the Second World
War and up to the mid 1950s Japan
struggled to rebuild its economic and
physical structure. The thinking of
our people was backward-looking,
fixed on our ancient traditions and the
history of the past. In this atmos¬
phere, Japanese architects felt we
could not fulfil the people's spiritual
needs unless our architecture was
inspired by Japan's ancient traditions.
"But in discussing tradition in
Japan we architects came to realize
that there existed two distinct types
of tradition in our country "an upper
current" and "an under current." The
upper current tradition stemmed from
the nobility and aristocratic" circles, in
other words, from the upper- classes
of society, and found expression in
their palaces, castles and other
traditional residences, as well as their
gardens.
"The under current tradition sprang
from the people. It can be found in
the brightly coloured local festivals
that enliven every town of Japan, and
in the dynamic shapes of Japanese
farmhouses and village homes.
"To most Americans and Europeans
and indeed many Japanese only
the upper current represents the
traditional art and culture of Japan.
But the under current tradition has
a vital, dynamic quality of its own,
and a richness which contrasts
markedly with the shapes and forms
of the upper current tradition."
Tange went on to explain that
Japanese art historians have not paid
much attention to this under current,
and Japanese architects took their
chief inspiration, up until about 1955,
chiefly from the upper current forms.
"But the ordinary people of Japan
have under current backgrounds," he
went on, "and cannot fully respond to
the upper current traditional forms.
At this point, I began asking myself
what the function of tradition in
architecture really was."
Tange stopped for a moment, and
then added quickly. "I myself believe
that tradition by itself cannot be
creative power. I sometimes compare
tradition to a chemical reaction. It
should act like a catalytic agent to
create something new, but the
traditional form or inspiration should
not be visible in the finished product."
And he concluded with the following
words:
"The Japanese economy has now
changed its structure.- With it our
social structuré and Institutions have
also changed. And most important,
the attitude of the Japanese people is
now forward-looking not backward-
looking. Formerly, everything In Japan
was done by following the past. But
we have now entered a new age, a
technological civilization, where looking
ahead to tomorrow is much more
realistic than turning back to yesterday.
For tomorrow will be a different,
changed world. We cannot seek a
solution to our new problems just by
following the pattern of the past. And
the architect in society cannot do so
either. He too must look ahead."
P ROFESSOR Teijiro Mura-
matsu has perhaps summed up the
thinking of Kenzo Tange and other
contemporary Japanese architects
when he said:
"Japan now finds herself faced with
the new problem of working out the
shift into a completely new society . . .
Japanese designers, architects, and
the people as a whole are giving as
much, if not more, sincere thought to
the new Japanese society and the
development of the Japanese culture
as they devote to industrial growth.
We have experienced periods of
copying foreign models and periods
of nationalistic reaction . . .but ' from
now on we have no models. We must
face the problem of the new and
unknown ourselves and work out our
own plan. One hundred years after
the Meiji Restoration, we stand at the
starting line of a new modernization
process."

An imaginative quest
for new solutions marks
the development
of Japan's modem
architecture.
Its striking success is
seen in the wealth of
ideas and the
aesthetic and functional
harmony evld»ent
in many recent buildings.
From some, a clear
line of development runs
back to old Japanese
architectural tradition,
with today's designers
composing new
variations on many
an old theme. One
example is the
youth hostel,

in a grandiose mountain
setting by Motoo
Take. There is a striking
likeness between its
reinforced concrete
roof and the
high-gabled thatched
roofs of 5th and
6th century Japanese
houses, as shown by the
clay house, top left,

elements.
