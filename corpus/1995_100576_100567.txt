interview
Marcello
Mastroianni
What is your first memory
of the cinema?
The first film I can remember seeing
was Ben Hur* My family and I were
living in Turin, where we had emi¬
grated from southern central Italy. It
was in about 1930 I must have
been six at the time. The images of
that spectacular film made a great
impression on me. I've never for¬
gotten it. I think it must have been
dubbed into Italian. Foreign films were
never released in their original version
in Italy. They were always dubbed.
I When did you decide to
make a career in the
cinema?
It wasn't something I consciously
decided to do. After living in Turin, we
moved to Rome. My grandfather had
six sons, all of whom lived in Rome.
When I was young, between ten and
fifteen, say, there wasn't much spare
cash to keep us amused. We were
short of money. We made our own
toys slings, for instance.
At that time the place where young
people got together wasn't the local
dance hall but the church. We weren't
particularly attracted by religion. We
went there because the local parish
had a football pitch and we had to
sing in the choir. There was a little the¬
atre in the basement of our church in
Rome. The priest wrote Christian
plays. That's where I first began to act.
I continued to do so at school, then at
university, where I studied architec¬
ture. 'We did amateur dramatics and
put on American and Italian plays. We
weren't all that bad.
Chance had a hand in what hap¬
pened next. We put on Angelica, a
play by an Italian anti-Fascist author,
Leo Ferrera. I got the part of Orlando,
and Angelica was played by Federico
Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina. It was
particularly nice of her to take part in
our production as she was already a
star. Critics and theatre people took
the trouble to come and see the play.
One of them was the general manager
of the largest Italian theatre company
of the time, whose director was
Luchino Visconti. He came to see me
after the show and asked if I'd ever
thought of turning professional. He
was looking for a leading man.
It was shortly after the war. I was
twenty-six. My father had gone blind,
g

and I had to support my mother and
the rest of the family. "I have responsi¬
bilities," I told the man. "How much
were you thinking of paying me?" He
told me I first had to see Mr. Visconti. I
knew Visconti, but wasn't in the habit
of going to the theatre. We preferred
to go and see films with Gary Cooper
and John Wayne. I liked acting in
plays, but not going to see them. I dis¬
covered real theatre when I joined Vis¬
conti 's company. My career took off
quickly. The first play I acted in was
Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar
Named Desire, and the second,
Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman.
At first I didn't dare tell my mother I
had given up my office job. It would
have sent her into a panic. I continued
to leave home every morning at 7.30,
as though I was going to the office.
But after a month I took the bull by the
horns and told her the truth. She was
very happy. That was when I really
started my career as an actor. I invited
my father to the show. We gave him a
special chair. He was very moved to
hear his son acting in a play. That's
how I started my career in the most
traditional way imaginable.

Are (Italy, 1978).
I How did you come to meet
Federico Fellini?
I had already played in a Visconti
film, White Nights, which was based
on a Dostoevski short story, with
Maria Schell, who was a European
star at the time. And during the ten
years I spent with Visconti's company
I'd had occasion to work with Fellini.
One day somebody came to tell me
that Fellini wanted to see me in Rome.
He had already made some wonderful
films. So I went along. He was on the
beach with his scriptwriter, the author
Ennio Flaiano. He told me he wanted
to make a film with Paul Newman. So
as not to steal the limelight from the
American actor, he needed some
pretty ordinary-looking guy to play
alongside him and had thought of
me. I replied that I was ready and
willing, but ventured to ask if I could
glance at the screenplay. He said that
was perfectly possible and called to
his scriptwriter, who was lying under
another parasol. He gave me a folder.
When I opened it, all there was inside
was a drawing Fellini was always
drawing things which depicted a
swimmer whose penis went right
down to the bottom of the sea. And
there were lots of women swimming
around it, like in an Esther Williams
aquatic movie. I went crimson with
embarrassment and said: "Yes, it looks
very interesting. Where do I sign?"
After that I never asked Fellini for a
screenplay. I made five films with him.
There was a great bond of friendship
and complicity between us. Fellini
was not just a great director, but a
true artist. If he hadn't been a film¬
maker, I think he would have been a
great writer.
Working with him was constant
fun and games. Everything was
turned into a lark or a joke. He liked to
work on actors in the same way he
would have worked dough. You had
to come before him like a naked child,
and then he would have fun with you.
He used to have enormous fun, even
with the bit actors he would go and
choose in the streets of Naples. The
Neapolitans are a way-out lot, even to
look at, and they have a very peculiar
mentality. If they couldn't say their
lines, Fellini didn't care. He'd say:
"Come on now, say one, two, three.
Laugh now! Laugh!" Then he post-
synched them. It was extraordinary:
with Fellini it was cinema non-stop.
Fellini was demanding, but he
never lost his phenomenal sense of
humour. It was a tremendous privilege
to work with him, even greater than
the privilege of appearing in films that
have gone down as masterpieces in
the history of the cinema. I have to
admit that I felt jealous when he made
films in which I didn't appear.
> Did you have an equally
friendly relationship with
any other Italian
director?
There was certainly friendship, but
never the same complicity that existed
between me and Fellini. We were like
schoolboys or army pals who
couldn't stop playing the fool. I've
had many director friends Ettore
Scola, Marco Ferreri and many others
I've worked with and greatly liked. But
there was something unique between
me and Fellini.

I Has your work with non-
Italian directors enlarged
your experience?
No. But I'd like to say something
that women directors may find a bit
silly. I find that women in that profes¬
sion, which has always been a man's
profession, feel somehow grateful to
male actors who agree to be directed
by them and have confidence in them.
So women directors tend to adopt a
maternal, protective attitude towards
them. That's my feeling anyway.
Every time I've worked with a
woman director, even if we weren't
friends, and even if it was just for one
film, she has looked after me like a
mother and cared about details that
would not have occurred to any male
director.
I People sometimes say that
the cinema isn't what it
used to be. What do you
think?
Yes, that's true. But I remember my
mother always saying that the world
wasn't what it used to be. It's true: the
world changes, people change, times
change, and one can't go on doing
things the way they were done in the
Marcello Mastroianni
and Anita Ekberg in
Federico Fellini 's La Dolce
Vita (Italy, 1960).
past. Nowadays, there might no
longer be a slot for a guy like Fellini.
People always say things were better
in the old days, but only when they
are forty or fifty years old.
t Even young people who
are interested in the
cinema say the same
thing. They think the
cinema has less freedom
than it used to have.
Look at Russia, where I've shot
two films. When film-makers there
could not express themselves freely,
they made good films. Ever since
they've been free, they have failed to
produce anything of note. Perhaps
it's because of the Americans. In the
old days, when I went to work in what
used to be the Soviet Union, I was
welcomed and I'm not being big-
headed like a star. Why? Because
the authorities didn't allow American
films in. It was above all the Italian
cinema that people were familiar with,
because of its social concerns. Now
all they go for are American films. The
competition is very stiff. It must also be
said that the conquest of a freedom
for which they were not prepared cre¬
ated a kind of vacuum. Before, they
were forced to make an effort to put
across certain ideas through the
medium of film. They had to work
hard to fool the censors.
But there's a crisis everywhere in
Italy and Germany too. I think we need
to be vigilant about the dangers of
television. Even stars no longer have
the same aura. They've lost their
stature, as Fellini used to say. In the
old days, you'd see a giant Marilyn
Monroe on a cinema screen; nowa¬
days she's a tiny figure on television.
Going to the cinema was a kind of
enthralling religious ceremony: the
lights would go down, the spectators
would enjoy the showing together,
then they would come out and have a
drink and talk about the film.
Television is a wonderful invention,
but it fosters loneliness, prevents
people from going to the cinema and
encourages them to stay at home.
Because of television, people read
much less than they used to.
t Do you believe in the
future of the European
cinema?
Of course I would like to. I'd like
there to be a European cinema. But
are governments going to do any¬
thing to help that wonderful idea of a
European cinema? There are home¬
grown films that fail to get released
because the cinemas are full of Amer¬
ican movies. It's unfair. But it's also, in
my opinion, unfair on the American
public. Just think how many fine
European films they have been pre¬
vented from seeing. I find this cultural
compartmentalization regrettable in a
world that has become so small.
