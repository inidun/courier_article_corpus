mem of a critical edition led to a com¬
plete reassessment of the work.
We made sure that we had learned all
we could from this initial experiment be¬
fore recommending its extension to the
works of other Latin American writers,
and eventually to the literatures of other
parts of the developing world.
At the World Conference on Cultur¬
al Policies organized by Unesco and held
in Mexico City in 1982, Leopold Sédar
Above, the
Guatemalan writer
Miguel Angel Asturias
in 1956. His
manuscripts, which he
donated to France's
Bibliothèque
Nationale, were the
nucleus of the
"Archives Collection"
(see article). The final
page of the
manuscript of his
novel El señor
presidente, right,
shows that the work
was written between
1925 and 1932, and
not around 1945 as
critics once believed.
FIFTEEN years ago, the Guatemalan
writer and poet Miguel Angel
Asturias (1899-1974), winner of the
1967 Nobel Prize for Literature, donat¬
ed his manuscripts and archives to the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, so that
they could be preserved there and used
in the preparation of an international edi¬
tion of his work using modern methods
of textual analysis and criticism.
The results have been highly instruc¬
tive. In the first place, despite the ex¬
pressed wish of the author, many of his
manuscripts were not made available to
the Bibliothèque Nationale, and other
documents essential to the understanding
of his work were dispersed and perhaps
lost for ever. Secondly, where documen¬
tation was available, as in the case of the
novels El señor presidente (The President,
1963) and Hombres de maíz (Men ofMaize,
1975), methods of textual analysis have
evolved so radically that the establish-

Senghor called on Unesco member states
to take international action for the preser¬
vation, evaluation and study of twentieth-
century manuscripts. At the time, Mr.
Senghor was president of ALLCA, the
Latin American, Caribbean and African
20th-century Literary Archives Associa¬
tion, which had grown out of the Friends
of Miguel Angel Asturias.
In 1983 and 1984 international meet¬
ings were held in several countries to dis¬
cuss these issues. The gatherings were
organized by the National Centre for
Scientific Research and the Bibliothèque
Nationale in France; by the Consiglio
Nazionale delle Ricerce (CNR) in Italy;
and by the Instituto de Cultura e Lingua
Portuguesa (ICALP) in Portugal.
Specialists in philology, linguistics, histo¬
ry, Latin American literature and com¬
parative literature took part in
interdisciplinary workshops, and a "Mul¬
tilateral Agreement on Archival Research
and Co-Publications" was drafted and
then signed in September 1984 at Buenos
Aires (Argentina) by four European
countriesFrance, Italy, Portugal and
Spainand four Latin American
countriesArgentina, Brazil, Colombia
and Mexico.
An international agreement
The aims of this "Archives Agree¬
ment" are to promote:
philological and linguistic analysis
of texts on the basis of manuscript or
published versions approved by the
author, and the transcription and study
of variants, i.e. the establishment of a
reliable, authentic text and the history of
its creation;
the compilation of dossiers on each
author, his or her writings, and the
problems they raise;
textual and contextual analyses by
critics from the same country or region
as the author or from elsewhere;
the systematic examination of texts
from an international and interdiscipli¬
nary viewpoint; this approach is not in¬
trinsically new but it is innovatory in the
case of the Archives Agreement because
of its scope and long-term nature.
As a result of the Archives Agree¬
ment, a number of literary works began
to be published in a series known as the
Archives Collection (Colección "Archi¬
vos') in several cities of Latin America.
Each year ten or so titles are scheduled
for publication in the Collection. All the
countries of the region and four languages
(Spanish, Portuguese, French, English)
are represented. The project is thus con¬
tributing to the recognition by interna¬
tional scholarship of each country's
classic authors, to a reassessment of the
literary history of Latin America in the
twentieth century, and to the establish¬
ment of a distribution network for
Latin American literature which will
be as wide-ranging as the intellectual,
technical and financial efforts that have
gone into it.
The scientific direction of the Collec¬
tion is in the hands of an international
committee of twenty-seven specialists in
the relevant literary disciplines. ALLCA
also has a publishing committee consist-

Backing for the Collection is provid¬
ed on an equal footing by the eight sig¬
natories to the Archives Agreement. The
European countries grant financial sub¬
ventions and the Latin American coun¬
tries provide contributions in kind. From
the outset Unesco and especially its In¬
ternational Fund for the Promotion of
Culture has provided the project with
financial and other support.

Scientific Research and the University of

A recent survey carried out in Latin America
under the auspices of Unesco's International
Fund for the Promotion of Culture concluded
that there was a need for legal instruments
whereby states would preserve contemporary
literary manuscripts as part of their national
heritage and, in a region where many library
personnel are trained in preservation
techniques, for improved technical facilities jn
this field. The survey also suggested that
manuscripts should be made more easily
accessible to scholars. As a response to the
study, Venezuela has passed legislation on the
protection and preservation of manuscripts.

As Mr. Senghor has said, Africa sees



this project as a "promise for the future,
a laboratory where the new civilization
of the third millennium is taking shape,
a universal civilization based on a dia¬
logue between cultures".
AMOS SEGALA, of Italy, is secretary-general of
the Latin American, Caribbean and African 20th-
century Literary Archives Association (ALLCA) and
director of the Archives Collection. A researcher
at the French National Centre for Scientific
Research, and the author of several studies on an¬
cient Mexican texts he co-ordinated the publication
of critical editions of the works of the Guatemalan
writer Miguel Angel Asturias.
and add new titles to the Collection, tak¬
ing into account the results obtained so
far.
With the publication of 120 titles by
authors from twenty-two countries in the
pipeline, the Archives Collection
represents the cultural and linguistic
wealth and diversity of an entire region.
Its scale and timespan are unprecedented
for a programme of cultural and scientif¬
ic co-operation of this kind.
The Latin American countries which
were or are unused to working together
in this field, and lacked the opportunity
for mutual understanding despite their
common history, have thus embarked on
a long-term sharing of literary experiences
which will bring them closer together.
Another interesting aspect of the Ar¬
chives Agreement is the participation in
it of four European countries which are
profoundly and irreversibly linked to La¬
tin America. The Agreement thus breaks
new ground both in Latin America and
in the Latin countries of Europe, herald¬
ing new forms of international scientific
co-operation and cultural solidarity.
What are the underlying reasons for
this Agreement which mobilizes 500
specialists from a wide range of dis¬
ciplines, eight governments, many insti¬
tutions and considerable resources? The
answer is that Latin American literature,
currently one of the world's richest, is an
extreme example of the isolation and
neglect that in some cases afflict the liter¬
ature of developing countries. The Ar¬
chives Collection is not only an
instructive experience in itself, but a test
case from which other regions can learn.
