rtFTER leaving Oman and calling at
Karachi, Goa, Colombo and Madras,
the Maritime Silk Roads expedition
embarked on the second half of Its
voyage at Phuket in Thailand.
Although they are following a route
which traces a single line across the
map, the participants realize that its
ramifications are labyrinthine in their
complexity. Each discovery of a new
site, each new lecture and sympo¬
sium, fits into a pattern and sets a
vast network of travel, trade and
communication in a new perspective.
The stop-off at Karachi was an
opportunity to reflect on the trading
civilization of the Indus, the Aryan
invasions of the Indian sub-continent,
and the relations between Sind and
Central Asia, Iran and China which go
back to the last millennium of the
pre-Christian era. At Goa we were in
the Portuguese world, with its
privileged links with Malacca and
Macao. Sri Lanka evoked thoughts of
the Greco-Roman world, of Arab
trade, and the spiritual influence of
an island which played a leading role
in the spread of Buddhism. In
Madras, the abundance of research
on relations with the Roman world
was only rivalled by that of studies
on the links between Tamil Nadu and
South and Southeast Asia. So many
threads to be unravelled from such
a tangled skein!
The general term "Silk Roads" is
also used to designate trade routes
in commodities such as porcelain,
spices and incense. But there are
other routes whose scattered traces
invite study. One of them is that
taken by Roman coins. It is not sur¬
prising that Roman coins should
have turned up all along our route,
but when two numismatists put for¬
ward some ingenious hypotheses at
a seminar held in Madras they
prompted a number of more general
historical questions. How important
was the heavy drain of coinage along
the trade-route with India which
caused the Roman emperor Tiberius
such alarm? What role did the
emperor's entourage play in this?
When were Roman coins prized at
their nominal value and when
according to their weight in metal,
and why? Tiny coins lost at the other
end of the world are evidence of
crises and conflicts that were
agitating a distant empire.
Another specialist on board the
Fulk al-Salamah, the Ship of Peace,
is studying even smaller objects, the
beads with which necklaces were
made. His field of research begins in
the third century BC, and is based on
the different shapes of rough glass
beads. From the region of what is
today Pondicherry it is possible to
trace the steps of Indian glassmakers
to Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, Thailand and
Malaysia and learn something about
the beliefs and hierarchies that
existed in those societies. Perhaps
we should think in terms of a "glass
bead road" or a "seashell road"?
After all some seashells, particularly
those from Oman, were used for cen¬
turies as a unit of exchange. The
type, location and quantity of shells
found along the Silk Roads warrant
scholarly investigation.
Even the simplest and most tan¬
gible vestiges of trade raise ques¬
tions with complex answers. Such
vestiges amply prove, as we might
expect, how ancient, regular and
intensive were the relations between
cultures and how rich was their
common heritage. But artefacts and
coins always have a value that is not
merely utilitarian. They indicate that
trade routes are also channels of
communication for technology,
ideas, art forms and beliefs.
A speaker at one seminar pointed
out that while many scholars have
abandoned the concept of cultural
"influences" on the grounds that it
is too simplistic, they have often
replaced it by the concept of "inter¬
actions" which is hardly more
illuminating. As they try to decipher
the clues left by their predecessors,
modern travellers along the Silk
Roads are constantly struck by the
irrelevance of some of the categories
we use. Stones, pottery, artefacts,
stories, maps and vestiges are the
external transcription of an inner
need that impels certain peoples
towards maritime adventure, each in
its own different way.
The mysterious Indus
civilization
The gaps in our knowledge often
whet our curiosity about the values
which lie behind rare vestiges from
the past. In Pakistan, for example,
our programme of seminars and

Visits highlighted the importance of
the mysterious Indus Valley civiliza¬
tion which disappeared 3,500 years
ago. A visit to Moenjodaro, whose
discovery in 1921 was a milestone
in the history of archaeology,
prompted a host of questions. All
that survives of this great monument
to a civilization whose writing has still
not been deciphered, a metropolis
that was continuously occupied for
almost 2,000 years and may well
have had a population of some
45,000, are the ruins of a brick city
built on a remarkably regular grid
system of street layout.
The overall impression is one of
austerity. The houses, rebuilt one
above the other in the course of the
centuries, are virtually identical. The
drainage system and the public baths
are evidence of an important infra¬
structure. The discovery of stan¬
dardized weights and seals
throughout the area influenced by
the Indus civilization suggests the
existence of an efficient mechanism
of control and perhaps of a powerful
administrative framework. But the
few vestiges and works of art of this
great civilization transmit a laconic
message that is not fully understood.
We know next to nothing about the
myths and beliefs of one of the first
peoples who opened up the great
trade routes of the Eurasian con¬
tinent.
But whether we are faced with a
plethora of traces or, as in the case
of the Indus civilization, with very
few, we come up against the same
uncertainties. What type of dialogue
was established along the Silk Roads
over the centuries, and what did it
mean for those who lived in its orbit?
There is an urgent need for concep
tual guidelines to help us understand
the effects of this process whereby
so many peoples and forms of
expression came into contact with
each other. Perhaps we should exa¬
mine the spiritual as well as the phys¬
ical dimensions of the Silk Roads.
Gods and places
From Sri Lanka onwards the maritime
Silk Roads intersect with the route
along which Buddhism spread. If the
conversion of Sind to Islam and of
Goa to Christianity are major events,
the way in which this island once
known as Taprobane became the
centre from which the Buddhist doc¬
trine of Enlightenment was dissemi¬
nated illustrates the relationship
between gods and places.
Perhaps something predisposes
the island to play this role. The geog¬
raphy of the "lion kingdom" has an
imaginary and a spiritual, as well as
a physical, dimension. The car¬
tographers of Antiquity, following
Ptolemy, attributed to Taprobane a
size and a locationon the very edge
of the world in keeping with its sym¬
bolic importance. The mountain of
Samanakuta or "Adam's Peak" is a
famous place of pilgrimage. At its
summit is a hollow resembling a
human footprint which is venerated
by pilgrims of the "religions of the
Book" as that of Adam after he was
banished from the Garden of Eden.
The great Arab traveller Ibn Battuta
came to meditate at the foot of the
mountain, "forty leagues from Para¬
dise". Pliny's stories about the Isle
of Emeralds fed the Western imagi¬
nation until the Middle Ages and

But Buddhists believe that the
hollow is the footprint of Gautama
Buddha. Around 250 BC, the Indian
emperor Asoka sent his son Mahinda
to Sri Lanka to convert the sovereign
to Buddhism. Later, Mahinda's sister
followed him with a branch of the Bo
tree under which Gautama was sit¬
ting when he attained Enlightenment.
The sacred tree which grew from this
branch can still be seen at Anurad-
hapura, Sri Lanka's ancient capital.
From there the doctrine of Lesser
Vehicle Buddhism spread through
Burma, Thailand and Southeast Asia.
But the history of Anuradhapura, a
town noted for its many monasteries
and the world's tallest stupa, is en¬
twined with the fortunes of another
venerated relic, the Buddha's tooth,
which was sent there in the fourth
century. From then on the power of
the reigning dynasty was linked to
possession of the tooth-relic which,
together with the capital, was moved
from place to place under the pres¬
sure of invasions.
When, at the end of the fifth cen¬
tury, King Kasyapa built an extraor-

at Slglriya in the heart of the jungle,
his enemies talked of heresy. In the
eleventh century Anuradhapura was
sacked by the Cholas from southern
India. Polonnaruwa became the
island's capital, remaining so for
three centuries, and many Buddhist
monuments were built there. Finally
the relic was taken to Kandy, the cap¬
ital until the arrival of the British,
where it still remains.
Religion is omnipresent in Sri
Lanka. An order of Buddhist nuns
was founded there and spread
overseas. Men of faith and wisdom
travelled there in search of purity of
doctrine, among them the monk
Faxian who left China in the year 399
and stayed on the island for two
years. Missionaries and pilgrims set
out from Sri Lanka on journeys that
took them all over Asia. Travelling
and taking root, sea and landthese
two poles mark the history of Singha¬
lese Buddhism.
The participants in the maritime
expedition have come to realize that
the spread of Buddhism was the
result of factors such as geography,
maritime technology and trading net¬
works, as well as economic and polit¬
ical forces. But they have also
learned that these causes alone do
not explain the conversion of Sri
Lankaa mystery which exploration
of the Silk Roads does not unlock.
