JANUARY 1952
IT HAPPENED IN
A TINY VILLAGE

THEBE is a littlp-\"illagp far from the
j beaten track in south-east France
where the name More ! has been
common for centuries, so that each
generation has had to find new nicknames
to distinguish between them. Today, for
example, there are MOI'el-from-up-the-hill,
Lame Morel', CuI'ly-hpaded Iorel, Morel the
Deputy Mayor and so on. But the \"iIlage
blacksmith, although aged 46, had to wait
until last year before he had the most high-
sounding nickname of all conferred upon
him :"EquaHty"More).
It is no use asking-"Eqllality" Morel how
he got the name. He
will just shrug his
shoulders and say,
"Oh, it was just
a joke,"and then,
bending over his anvil.

keep to the point of
a story.
Sitting in the caf√©
opposite the village
post office, the Mayor
Will start on the
story once he has
filled his pipe and
taken a sip of pasts.
"Well,"he tells you,
"Morel got the name
because of the poster
about Human Rights
and the business
of Blanchette. Blan-
chette was a Negro
working on the
threshing machine.
You know, all sods of
fellows work on
these threshing gangs.
They come from the
north and the south ;
often they don't even
speak French. The
people round here
have seen Poles, Ita-
lians, Spaniards and
Arabs before, but
this was the first
time there'd been a Negro in the village.
"\well, complaints started to come in at
once. A couple of chickens were stolen
from a farm-they said it must be the
Negro. A rabbit was killed on another farm
- the Negro again. If the weather turned
bad, it was all because of the Negro. You
'could have thought that Blanchette was'he
devil himself. In fact, one Sunday, an old
maid came up to me :'Aren't you ashamed,'
she cried,'to let this devil stay in the village ?
We are all afraid to go out at night.'
"Such foolishness did not really matter
very much, and Blanchette's employer
insisted that the Negro was a good worker
and never caused any trouble, and I think
that things would have calmed down. But
one day something Worse happened in the
village : a hay stack caught fire and burned
to the ground.
"Who do you think it belonged to ? Why,
by Georges FRADIER
the old maid, of course. This time the real
trouble began. The police came along and
questioned everybody, but since they couldn't
find any real evidence about the cause of
the fire, they couldn't accuse anyone.
"The people here, of course, all said it
was a waste of time to hold an enquiry.
Everyone believed that Blanchette had
started the firs, and for three days the
Negro's boss had to be his bodyguard.
Then, what I had been afraid of, happened.
A full-scale delegation, led by the women,
came marching up to the town haH. Quite
honestly I couldn't see the use of resisting
any longer. Blanchette's employer was fed
up, and the only thing he felt he could do
was to pay the poor chap off and send him
away to shift for himself elsewhere.
"Well, at that point, Moret turned up. I
never thought I'd see anything like it in
the village. The hall was packed ; the
women were chattering ; the mew were
muttering. In comes More ! and sits down
beside me.'Antoine,'he says, in a loud
voice,'If you do this, you're a swine,'
and, thumping his fist on the table,'And
the rest of you, too.'What a grand sight it
was. The others tried to interrupt him,
calling him alp sorts of names, but he
shouted them all down and in the end they
had to listen to him. I never knew he
could talk so well.
"'You're accusing a man,'he said,'you
blame him for every crime that's committed.
Why ? Have you any evidence ? Have you
show you what rights
mean.'And with that
he took down a poster
that the schoolmaster
had got from Vatence,
and which had been
put up on the vall for
some reason or other.
It was the Universal
Declaration of Human
Rights.
"'Here,'says Morel,
.'here's a declaration
that our Government
and dozens of other
Governments h a v e
signed. A Universal
Declaration. Its meant
for everybody-
every man and every
woman Article 1.'
And he began to read
out Article 1. But
he didn't read it like
a lawyer. Oh, no ! He
was furious as he read
it ! Then came Ar-
ticle 2. It was about
all human beings, you
know, free and equal,
without distinction of
race, colour, etc. He
read it slowly and
even translated it into
our patois to make
sure that it was
understood. It was
grand to watch, I can
tell you."
By the time he gets
to his third pastis, the
Mayor is even more
enthusiastic."It was
really magnificent,"
he says. Then he
relights his pipe and
goes on, shaking his
finger for emphasis ;
"And would you
believe it ; he actually
managed to calm the
people down ; he got
them laughing and
rr) f) de them see that
the whole thing was ridiculous. The people
round here are a very decent lot. In a week's
time, they were tumbling over themselves
to offer Blanchette a drink. All the same,
Morel had upset a few people with his
speech ; those who nicknamed him'Equal-
ity'Morel did not mean it as a compliment.
But he'd proved his point and the nickname
stuck."
The moral of this story may be obvious,
but it needs emphasizing, especially when
one remembers that there are many people
who, looking at the Universal Declaration
of Human Blights, shake their heads
sadly and comment,"A fine set of prin-
ciples, but they haven't had much effect."True, no tex  b itself can cco plish a mi-
racle, but the world could hope for a great
deal from this particular text if enough men
were willing and able to use it in the
manner of"Equality"Morel.
caught him red-handed ? No, of course you
haven't. Your only reason for suspecting
him is that his skin isn't the same colour as
yours. Now, why don't you just stop to
think for a moment ?'
"'We have thought !' one woman called
out.'This is a free country. \-Ve'\, e e\'ery
right to get rid of anyone we don't like. You
never know what such people may be up to.'
"Morel burst out laughing.'So that's what
you think,'he said,'you think you're entitled
to send off a poor workman to starve just
because you don't like the look of him ?
well, since you're talking about rights, I'll
