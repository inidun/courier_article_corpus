Moved by the human tragedy of war,
we often overlook one of the other
major casualties—the env i r o n m e n t
a n d , more specifically, a gri c u l t u r e . G l o-
b a l l y, the number of armed conflicts has
been rising steadily since 1945, r e a c h i n g
an estimated 30 major and 80 to 100 minor
conflicts today.
Unlike high-tech wa rs involving we l l -
armed industrial countries,many of these
conflicts are low-intensity insurrections in
rural areas, where farmers are the victims.
Here, directly or indirectly, local seed sys-
tems may come under stress or even col-
lapse. Apart from jeopardizing immediate
food needs, the very sustainability of local
agriculture can be threatened,with poten-
tially serious consequences for the va riety of
genetic resources.
B i o d i ve rsity is often assessed in terms of
the number of existing species. B u t , at least
for crop plants, the genetic va ri ation within
species is equally import a n t . A l t h o u g h
there are half a million flowe ring plant spe-
cies, (only half of which have been named
and descri b e d ) , 95 per cent of human calo-
rie and protein requirements come from a
mere 30 of the 7,000 edible plant species
t h at humans plant or collect. And more
than half the global energy intake comes
from just three major crops—ri c e , w h e at
and maize. Genetic va ri ation enables fa r-
m e rs and agricultural scientists to conti-
nue to adapt these key crops to changing
circumstances—critical for our long-term
survival.According to the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nat i o n s
(FAO), there are as many as 100,000 dis-
tinct varieties of Asian rice (Oryza sativa)
alone.
But what happens to seed systems when
they are repeatedly disrupted by war? Far-
m e rs use several kinds of seed from
different sources.They are mainly va ri e t i e s
taken from their previous harve s t s , a d a p-
ted to local conditions and managed over
m a ny generat i o n s , or seeds from other
regions obtained through small local mar-
kets or by exchange. Fa rm e rs also use va ri e-
ties developed by research in national or
m u l t i n ational centres and purchased
annually through formal supply networks.
Vulnerable 
local seed varieties
Conflict affects the supply of these
kinds of seeds in different ways—and with
different long-term consequences for bio-
diversity. For the formal (non-local) varie-
t i e s , the supply of seed may dry up in times
of conflict, for example because transport
routes are disrupted, or because the pesti-
cides and fertilizers needed to grow these
varieties have become unavailable.This is
what happened in Rwanda, when the for-
mal potato system stopped functioning
c o u n t rywide around 1991-1992—although
direct combat only spread two years later.
U s u a l l y, when peace return s , t h e s e
f o rmal va rieties become available once
again and there are few new va ri e t a l
c o n c e rn s. The war in Bosnia caused a
b r e a k d own in the supply of crops. But it
now appears that there were relatively few
a d ve rse genetic consequences. This is
because fa rm e rs were using regi s t e r e d
va rieties supplied through formal channels.
Registered seeds are likely to be backed up
in collections in a number of countries. A
m u l t i n ational seed business caught in a wa r
zone simply withdraws for the time being
and continues its business elsewhere,with
its seed collections intact.
More vulnerable in the long term are
the local va ri e t i e s. These may be ancient
va ri e t i e s , often unrecorded and at the heart
of complex social interactions. Local or fa r-
mer-managed seed systems tend to be
decentralized and small scale. The seeds
can be obtained from small open markets,
or as the currency of gift-giving, loans and
exchange among people with firm social
bonds.
In many A f rican countri e s , up to 90 per
cent of the seeds planted in any normal ye a r

C A S UA LTIES OF W A R

By destroying local seed supply systems, warfare in the developing world jeopardizes 
the crop biodiversity on which sustainable agriculture depends

comes from informal sources. Even where
purchase (for example, from local mer-
chants) is an important part of an inform a l
seed system, it is rarely backed up by the
kind of specialist seed research fa c i l i t i e s
found in more developed economies. I n
war-affected Sierra Leone, for example, a
recent study showed that the informal sys-
tem was responsible in normal ye a rs for
about 80 per cent of seed supply for the
main staple, ri c e . Most informal transac-
tions were fa rm e r - t o - fa rm e r , in the form of
gi f t s , p u r c h a s e s , and loans. In Rwa n d a ,
Burundi and Zaire, before their respective
wars, over 95 per cent of bean seeds, their
main protein source, came from informal
seed systems.
When rural communities are forced to
fle e , the fine web of mutual seed support is
w r e c k e d . Refugee fa rm e rs no longer have
the means to repay at harvest the seeds they
b o rr owed from fellow - fa rm e rs in the plan-
ting season, so the system breaks dow n .
Without the security of peace, rural com-
munities cannot hold the markets to bu y
and sell seed. And fa rm e rs no longer know
t h at what they plant can indeed be harve s-
ted in four, nine or 18 months’ time (the
cycles of beans, p o t atoes and cassava , r e s-
p e c t i ve l y ) . Seed may be totally lacking, o r
fa rm e rs may be unable to access it, b e c a u s e
social ties are ru p t u r e d , or because they are
just too poor. In some cases, fa rm e rs under
fire may have stored appropri ate seed, bu t
simply cannot plant it. A l t e rn at i ve l y, s e e d
m ay be ava i l a b l e , but of poor quality.
Genetic loss, then, is most likely when
conflict is concentrated in remote ru r a l
areas,where it is fairly widespread geogra-
phically, and when it lasts for several years
in succession.This was the case in Angola
and Mozambique,where isolated and vul-
nerable rural populations lost many plan-
ting seasons.War has affected fourteen A f ri-
can countries during the 1990s,with rural
p o p u l ations most heavily dependent on
locally adapted seeds being the major
casualties.
Some countries are especially rich in
local va rieties and the wild relat i ves of crop
species. The breakdown of local seed sys-
tems in these countries can cause irrever-
sible damage to the global genetic resources
of food crops. For example,major wars in
Guinea Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone,
along with lesser insurrections in Casa-
mance (Senegal) and Guinea have affected

zone of ancient rice agri c u l t u r e .This regi o n

bal significance if this under-collected and

So what can be done to offset this kind
of genetic disaster? During the T i gr e a n
c o n flicts in the nort h e rn highlands of Ethio-
p i a , t h at lasted on and off for two decades,
community elders organized emergency
seed banks of maize, s o r g h u m ,w h e at ,b a r-
l e y, finger millet and teff—an annual gr a s s
gr own for its gr a i n . This was mostly to
i m p r ove the deteri o r ating seed quality,
r ather than because of short supply. I n
E t h i o p i a , a country with rich local va ri e t i e s ,
plant scientists have invested in crop gene-
tic resource conservation and in unders t a n-
ding the impact of war and drought on seed
s u p p l y.
I r o n i c a l l y, h u m a n i t a rian agencies often
make the situation wo rs e , by responding to
seed system breakdown by supplying far-
mers with seed from outside the country:
Giving “seed and tools” is the standard
second relief response after food.Seed aid
is usually “exotic”, not tested or suited to
local conditions and is alien to the cultural
management practices of farmers.
In some countries there are nat i o n a l
e f f o rts to restore crop dive rsity lost due to
wa r. I n t e rn ational A gricultural Research
Centres have been restoring bean and sorg-
hum genetic mat e rial to gene banks in wa r -
t o rn Rwanda and Buru n d i , local va rieties of
b a r l e y,d u rum wheat and bread wheat to Eri-
trea and rice seeds to institutes in the
trouble-spots of Liberia and Guinea Bis-
sau—and even Cambodia. All these coun-
t ries lost their centralized gene bank stocks,
although it is not known if there was any loss
of dive rsity at fa rm leve l .
To reinforce this kind of wo r k , s o m e
r e gi o n s , such as the West A f rican zone of
ancient rice cultivat i o n , will need specialist
missions to rescue and conserve endange-
red local va ri e t i e s.This will mean gat h e ri n g
information on cultural and farming prac-
tices,too.War threatens not only seeds but
also the knowledge that fa rming popula-
tions possess about how, where and when
to use locally-adapted local varieties.
It is difficult to estimate the true scale of
crop biodive rsity loss in wa r - t o rn regi o n s.
For several decades, small fa rm e rs have
gi ven oral accounts of significant va riety loss.
It is only now, with the development of bio-
t e c h n o l o gi e s , t h at plant scientists have the
tools to measure genetic losses precisely. n
I r o n i c a l l y, humanitarian agencies often make 
the situation worse, by responding to seed system 
breakdown by supplying farmers with seed 
from outside the country

They constitute “genetic reservoirs” since they generally contain a wide diversity of varieties of each plant.The map also shows, in darker shading,
