Working women in South Korea have neve r
e n j oyed the same rights as their male
c o u n t e rp a rt s. In the 1960s, when men
were struggling for improved working conditions and
higher wa g e s ,women were busy defending their basic
human rights.
South Korea’s population of 45 million includes
22 million in the work force, of whom nearly nine
million are wo m e n .Yet the country ’s male trade union
l e a d e rs rarely think of the specific problems of wo m e n
in the workplace.What’s more,men are reluctant to
a c k n owledge the important contri bution wo m e n
make in the struggle to improve working conditions.
Founded in 1992, the Korean Women Wo r k e rs
A s s o c i ation United (KWWAU) is a network of six
r e gional wo m e n ’s organizat i o n s. Its main task is to
e d u c ate and organize women and to deve l o p
campaigns and policies designed to improve mother-
and-child health care and to ensure equality and
stability in labour contracts and on-the-job training.
One of the services offered is the “Equality Line”
counselling centre,which advises women on how to
deal with occupational problems and unfa i r
t r e at m e n t .Of all the women who called on this serv i c e
last ye a r , 56.6 per cent complained of delays in being
p a i d , job insecurity and unwa rranted dismissal, w h i l e
14.6 per cent reported cases of sexual harassment and
violence at the wo r k p l a c e . Some 13.7 per cent said
t h at working conditions failed to take their role as
m o t h e rs into account. Sexual discri m i n at i o n
accounted for 8.7 per cent of all complaints and
wo r k - r e l ated ailments amounted to 6.4 per cent.
In addition to these counselling serv i c e s ,E q u a l i t y
Line also organizes conferences and educat i o n a l
p r o gr a m m e s. The group has recently published a
book containing a list of all the cases it handled from
September 1996 to August 1997, with the aim of
acquainting other women wo r k e rs with the most
commonly encountered labour problems and ways of
dealing with them.
K W WAU is run by a team of six gr a d u at e
professionals with several ye a rs ’ e x p e rience in
o r g a n i z ations concerned with the legal rights of female
wo r k e rs. Its activities include inve s t i g ating wo r k
s i t u ations where women are unfairly treat e d ,
questioning gove rnment policies which do not prov i d e
for the rights of working women,organizing forums
and setting up action plans to promote awa r e n e s s
among regional groups and other associations wo r k i n g
to ensure that women have a fair deal on the labour
market.
The organization’s budget for the current year is
some $90,000.The bulk of that amount comes from
m e m b e rs ’c o n t ri butions and from assistance prov i d e d
by other national and international organizations.A
small proportion of the funding is provided by gr a n t s
from government agencies for projects proposed by
KWWAU.
The activities of KWWAU are starting to have a
perceptible impact. Fo l l owing several meetings
b e t ween the gr o u p ’s regional chapters and the
c o u n t ry ’s trade unions, an agreement was reached
to build day-care centres near workplaces. In 1993 a
c o l l e c t i ve convention was signed to open day - c a r e
centres hospitals,banks and businesses. n
