T has become fashionable
to decry science or, at least, those
unfortunate aberrations of technology
that masquerade as science. From his
rôle as a latter-day folk hero, the
scientist has been transformed by
some into a scapegoat for all our
present ills.
Funds no longer flow his way with
no questions asked, students in many
places turn their backs on his calling.
Even industrial polluters, like drunk¬
ards who promise to take the pledge,

are in the front ranks of those who
call for a*return to the paradise that is
supposed to have existed before the
Ecological Fall.
In this often-justified furore over
what science and technology have
done to us, we tend to forget what
the scientist is doing for us. And he
had better go on doing it. It is only a
privileged minority that can pretend to
shunt him aside. The rest of the world
needs him more than ever. Wherever
men suffer from a lack of the essen¬
tials rather than a surfeit of the super¬
fluous, science and its applications
have an honourable part to play in
human affairs.
Such was the tone of a rather un¬
usual ceremony held In November last
year in Paris. Shortly after the close
of the 17th Session of the Unesco
General Conference, two prizes were
awarded by Mr. René Maheu, Unesco's
Director-General, in one of the halls
that had just been vacated by the con¬
ference delegates.
On the rostrum were the three award
winners, an Austrian, a Soviet citizen,
and a Frenchman respectively a
maker of steel, an explorer of the
earth's soils, and a nuclear physicist
turned popularizer.
Varied though their backgrounds,
origins and interests may appear, they 1 1

with long careers behind them and
they shared an optimistic view of the
functions and the future of science.
Dr. Viktor Kovda, corresponding mem¬
ber of the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R., and Mr. Wolfgang Kühnelt
from Austria divided the Unesco
Science Prize, each receiving $2,000.
At the same ceremony, Dr. Pierre
Auger was given the Kalinga Prize for
the Popularization of Science, amount¬
ing to 1,000 pounds sterling.
The Unesco Science Prize is award¬
ed every two years for achievements
of specific value to developing coun¬
tries. In the past, it has gone to
scientists and engineers responsible
for better ways of desalting water and
growing food.
Mr. Kühnelt accepted his share of
the prize in the name of the Austrian
group who developed the so-called
LD Steel Production Process, a new
and cheaper way to make steel, more
than twenty years ago. Others in the
group cited by the award were Dr. Her¬
bert Trenkler, Dr. Hubert Hauttmann,
Dr. Rudolf Rinesch, Mr. Fritz Klepp,
Mr. Kurt Rösner, Mr. Otwin Cuscoleca,
Mr. Felix Grohs and the late Dr. Theo¬
dor Suess.
Of the three prize winners at the
Unesco ceremony, Mr. Kühnelt was
the only representative of industry.
Early in his professional life, he had
been an assistant lecturer in an Aus¬
trian university. But he preferred the
action of a steel mill to the groves of
Academe, and now, on the verge of
retirement, he is deputy manager of
operations of the Oesterreichisch-
Alpine Montangesellschaft plant at its
Vienna headquarters.
Mr. Kühnelt recalled how, in 1949,
Austria was in somewhat the position
of a developing nation during the
lean postwar years. Steel production
was low, only a million tons a year,
and it had to be raised.
But the country was short of scrap
metal, that essential ingredient in the
manufacture of steel. Mr. Kühnelt and
his colleagues experimented with a
different approach. Instead of blowing
air through a molten bath of iron from
the sides and below, they sent pure
oxygen down onto the surface of their
crucible.
It wasn't a new idea to blow oxygen
instead of air. Sir Henry Bessemer,
the English inventor and engineer had
patented it a hundred years ago, but
steelmakers believed that the use of
pure oxygen would lead to brittleness
in steel.
The Austrians were not convinced;
they found a way to use the oxygen to
get rid of the impurities in pig iron
and, at the same time, keep it out of
the steel. The method was developed
at the plant at Donawitz and also at the
Voest works at Linz, hence its name:
the LD process.
HE LD process went
around the world. In 1952 and 1953,
the first LD plants opened in Austria;
by 1954 the process was being used
in Canada. It was ideal for countries
with a small demand for steel. An
LD plant could be profitable producing
only 500,000 tons a year, as compared
to two million tons a year for traditional
processes. For once, technological
progress did not automatically imply
bigness.
Developing countries beat a path
to the Austrians" door. Steel men came
from India, Peru, Brazil and Tunisia to
learn the process, Austrians went to
their countries to teach it.
In Tunisia and Peru, the LD process
has been combined with continuous
casting: that is, the molten steel
comes out of the crucible and is cast
directly into slabs or billets instead of

ingots. The advantage is considerable
from the viewpoint of cost. Ingots
must go through a blooming mill, slabs
or billets are already in a more usable
form. Small countries with small
budgets need to invest less money in
rolling mills.
Speaking in the name of the Aus¬
trian steel men who made their first
tests with a two-ton crucible (the big¬
gest LD crucible now in use holds
400 metric tons), Mr. Kühnelt let figures
do most of the talking. Austrian steel
production has gone up from one to
four million tons. In 1954, total world
steel production amounted to 223 mill¬
ion tons; seventeen years later in
1971, the LD process was accounting
for 250 million tons, or 41 per cent of
world steel output that year.
The LD process was born out of
economic necessity. Equally practical
considerations led to the research that
also brought the Unesco Science Prize
to Dr. Viktor Kovda. A former head
of the Science Department at Unesco,
he is now director of the Institute of
Agrochemistry and Soil Science of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and he
holds the chair of soil science at Lo-
monosov State University in Moscow.
Of particular relevance to the dev¬
eloping world has been in research on
the "salting" of soil through faulty irri¬
gation methods and on ways to reclaim
it while, at the same time, using
brackish water for growing crops.
"R. Kovda too can recall
how his research started. In 1936 and
1937, he was carrying out field studies
on Uzbehistan's biggest cotton farm,
Pakhta Aral ("Cotton Island"), where
10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) were
under cultivation on the "Hungry
Steppe". At that time it was thought
that water containing more than one
gramme of dissolved mineral salts per
litre (seawater has an average of 35
grammes) was unsuitable for irrigation.
Dr. Kovda wanted to find optimal
conditions for growing high-quality
cotton. To his surprise, tests showed
that the best cotton was not produced
with water of low or no salinity. In¬
stead, it flourished with a soil-water
solution of as much as 5 to 6 gram¬
mes of salt per litre. Even when irri¬
gated with water twice as brackish,
the cotton could still survive.
In the Fergana Valley, that Dr. Kov¬
da likes to refer to as the "paradise of
Uzbekistan", the old farmers knew
they could irrigate with brackish
water. It meant growing salt-resis¬
tant crops and irrigating more fre-

FISH
OR FOWL,
OR BOTH?
A shoal of fish imperceptibly becomes a flock of birds in this 1938 print by Maurits Cornelis Escher, a
Netherlands engraver, whose drawings and prints have been widely reproduced in scientific books and
articles (See "Bookshelf, page 33). The design was used by Ivan Rosenqvist, a Norwegian geologist, to
demonstrate the particular characteristics of two substances: clay and water. The centre line of the print
represents the meeting point between particles of clay (birds) and molecules of water (fish). The further the
birds (clay particles) move upwards from the centre the more freely they fly. As the fish (water molecules)
recede from the clay particles they too can move more easily.
quently on well-drained land so that
the salts could be flushed out of the
soil. All this information was interest¬
ing but mainly academic because, in
those days, the U.S.S.R. had an ade¬
quate supply of low-salinity river
water.
Then, in 1957, Dr. Kovda was sent
by his government as an expert to
the Arab Republic of Egypt. There, he
saw water as a truly scarce asset.
Underground water with 5 to 7 gram¬
mes of salt per litre usually consid¬
ered a lethal dose for soil was being
used to irrigate oases that had remain¬
ed productive for two or three millen¬
nia.
The following year, he joined Unesco
and visited Tunisia where the same
problem existed. Food had to be
grown but only brackish water was
available to grow it. With the sup¬
port of President Habib Bourguiba of
Tunisia, he proposed that an experi¬
mental station be set up in the country
to test irrigation methods.
That was a decade ago. Today the
work done in Tunisia under the United
Nations Development Programme has
shown how the great underground sea

of brackish water lying below the arid
lands of North Africa can be used to
support crops and trees where only
rocks and sand existed before. The
lessons of Tunisia can be applied else¬
where in the developing world.
Dr. Kovda has organized the prep¬
aration by Unesco and the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization of an In¬
ternational Source Book on Irrigation
and Drainage of Arid Lands ("Irriga¬
tion, Drainage and Salinity", to appear
shortly). He himself is the author of
some 350 scientific works, including
ten books and he is now active in
Unesco's Man and Biosphere pro¬
gramme.
Yet one might say that this all began
some fifty-odd years ago when a small
boy read the adventure stories of
Jules Verne, Mayne Reid and James
Fenimore Cooper. Young Viktor Kov¬
da wanted to be an explorer. He and
his brother built a boat and roamed
the rivers around their home just as
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn did
in the books of another of his fav¬
ourite authors, Mark Twain.
When he entered the University of
Krasnodar in 1927, it was a time of
scientific growth in his country. He
was enamoured of science, but he
clung to his first love of exploration.
Soil science allowed him to be true to
both. Even as a student he carried
out soil surveys in the field. His pro¬
fessors had taught him the romance of
the earth.
Almost fifty years later, the romance
Is still there. When Dr. Kovda accept¬
ed the Unesco Science Prize, he spoke
of our mother earth and how she can
punish us severely with drought,
floods, earthquakes, volcanic erup¬
tions. We dare not sit back and merely
contemplate nature, he said. "Only if
we change nature with care will she
bear fruit and we need not preserve
her virginity for future generations."
But mother earth is 5,000 million
years old, said Dr. Kovda, and she
has not had an easy life. We must
rejuvenate her. Twenty per cent of the
earth's land surface is absolute des¬
ert and 40 per cent is arid or semi-
arid. If this land could be brought
into production by irrigation, it would
yield food... but not only food.
Photosynthesis would be taking
place over a vast area that is now
sterile. Plants would be using the
energy of sunlight to manufacture
carbohydrates, taking up carbon
dioxide in the process and releasing
oxygen.
Dr. Kovda reminded his audience
that certain industrial areas already
show an oxygen deficiency, produc
ing less than they consume. And we
all know by now that the proportion of
carbon dioxide in the earth's atmo¬
sphere is steadily rising as the result
of our holocaust of coal and oil, the
fossil fuels. In other words, Dr. Kovda
has proposed that we organize a
cycling of oxygen and carbon dioxide
by putting a plant cover over the
desert.
It is precisely the function of the
scientist to think along such bold new
lines when confronted by apparently
insoluble problems. Dr Kovda's hope¬
ful assessment of the contribution that
science can make to the future of the
planet was shared, in the main, by the
third speaker on the rostrum at Unesco
House.
At seventy-three, Dr. Pierre Auger
is the oldest of the award winners,
but he is a remarkably young man in
spirit. This is probably because he
has led a series of lives, first a twenty-
year career in the laboratory as a
cosmic-ray physicist, then an almost
equally long "life" as director of
higher education in France after World
War II, head of science at Unesco, and
director-general of the European Space
Research Organization. And now, in
an extremely active retirement, he is
continuing his work as a popularizer
of science, writing articles and making
radio broadcasts to answer the quest¬
ions of a worried public.
Dr. Auger did not grow up in the

Right, massive earthmoving vehi¬
cles line the bank of the future
canal in southern Uzbekistan
(U.S.S.R.). When completed in 1975
it will provide water to Irrigate a
vast area of arid land. In Uzbekis¬
tan, Dr. Viktor Kovda, winner of
Unesco's Science Prize, noted how
farmers used brackish water to irri¬
gate their land. Later, in southern
Tunisia, he proposed the use of
similar methods. Since then a U.N.
research programme has shown how
the great underground sea of
brackish water below North Africa's
arid lands can be used to grow
crops and trees a lesson that can
be applied elswhere in the develop¬
ing world.
SPARKING A STEEL
REVOLUTION
For developing a revolutionary new pro¬
cess of steel production a group of nine
Austrian researchers was awarded the
Unesco Science Prize in November 1972.
Photo shows one phase of this production
technique the LD process in which pure
oxygen is blown onto the surface of the
crucible. The LD process, a cheaper and
more efficient way to make steel, is now
used in all parts of the world.

countryside as young Victor Kovda
had done. His father was a professor
of chemistry at the Sorbonne; his
home was steeped in science. The
Augers decided to give their son more
than an ordinary education in science.
With several other Sorbonne scien¬
tists, they formed a "community" to
teach science to each others' children.
Jacques Hadamard, a great French
mathematician, taught Pierre Auger
mathematics and geology. His father
had given him chemistry and his own
interests had led him to enter the
Ecole Normale In Paris as a biology
student at the age of nineteen. There,
he came under the influence of Jean
Perrin and his son. The elder Perrin
later won a Nobel Prize in physics
while Francis, his son, became the
head of the atomic energy establish¬
ment in France. Pierre Auger was
converted to physics, but he already
had an interdisciplinary view of the
sciences that has never left him.
This made it all the easier for him
to project science beyond the bounds
of his profession and bring it within the
grasp of the general public. "The
public has a false idea of science", he
has said. "It sees dangers where none
exist; it does not see them where they
are really present. Atomic energy is
feared but it can be controlled. There
is much less concern over the demo¬
graphic explosion yet, so far, we do
not know how to control it."
While carrying on his scientific
work, Dr. Auger wrote and broadcast
regularly for the public. He had over
300 articles published in Lectures pour
Tous, a large-circulation French maga¬
zine, and he helped bring science into
the programmes of the French Radio
and Television Service. It was for this
aspect of his career that he was
awarded the Kalinga Prize for the
Popularization of Science, founded in
1951 by an Indian industrialist, Mr. Bi-
joyanand Patnaik, and administered by
Unesco.
When he accepted the prize at
Unesco House, Dr. Auger discussed
the responsibilities of the scientific
popularizer and, at the same time, the
attitude of the general public towards
science (see article page 4.) Some
members of the public are enthusiastic
about the intellectual adventure of
basic science, others want to hear of
the feats of technology, but there is a
third category that looks upon science
with anxiety. The first two require
mainly food for thought, said Dr. Auger,
but the third should be given the
unvarnished truth without dramatic
trappings.
What the popularizer must do at
all costs Is to transmit knowledge
rather than create myths. Dr. Auger
made a case for the humility of science
that seeks truth by building a theory
or model, then testing it by experi¬
ment. The mythmaker, on the con¬
trary, explains events by bestowing
superhuman virtues upon objects. The
test of a scientific theory is its uni¬
versality, but this does not concern
the mythmaker who can invent a new
explanation for every new event just
as the Romans had a god for every
phenomenon.
Dr. Auger observed that all bar¬
riers between disciplines are now
down just as they were in that scien¬
tific "community" of his childhood.
The unity of structure of the universe
is becoming apparent, we can under¬
stand the stars only if we can under¬
stand the atom and nuclear energy.
Even science and art are drawing
closer. The hope of science lies in
this universality.
