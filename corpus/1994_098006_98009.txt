he prospects for gene therapy
There are an
estimated 100,000
genes in the human
body. By replacing
defective genes
with healthy ones,
it will bepossible to
treat many
hereditary diseases
such as
haemophilia, cystic
fibrosis and,
eventually, some
forms ofmuscular

Rapid progress has been made in recent
years in characterizing hereditary dis¬
eases and in understanding their causes. These
diseases are due to alterations of genes, which
encode the information for building the body
and making it work. Genes are the carriers of
hereditary traits and are contained in filaments
of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that are present
in the cells of all organisms. The precise number
of genes in the human body is unknown, but it
is estimated to be around 100,000.
Every cell has two copies of each gene, one
deriving from the father, the other from the
mother. The information in the genes is used for
making proteins, the agents for building the
body and making it work. A disease appears
when a gene is altered in such a way that either
it does not make its corresponding protein, or
else makes a protein that is incapable of func¬
tioning. Since the same protein is encoded in
both genes of each pair, if only one fails enough
protein continues to be made to satisfy the needs
of the organisms, and there is no disease. A dis¬
ease appears when both fail and no functional
protein is made. This generally happens when a
child is born from two healthy parents, each of
whom carries an altered gene of the same pair.
Such parents have a one-in-four chance of gen¬
erating a defective child.
Hereditary genetic diseases can vary greatly
in severity. At one extreme are diseases such as
phenylketonuria, which, after detection at birth,
can be completely prevented by adopting a suit¬
able diet. At the other are those like Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome, which affects only boys, causing a
terrible form of mental retardation in which they
tend to eat themselves and must be kept bound to
their beds to prevent them from eating their fin¬
gers. Even so, they may eat their lips or their
tongues. All hereditary diseases generate a degree
of handicap, and for the majority of them there
is not as yet any effective therapy.
Vectors and receptors
During the last ten years many of the genes
responsible for hereditary diseases have been
discovered, leading to the possibility of a new
form of therapy known as "gene therapy" that
is based on the introduction into the patient's
cells of a good copy of the defective gene so as
to perform the missing function. The concept is

straightforward, but the implementation pre¬
sents many problems, which so far have limited
its use to only a few cases.
To treat a hereditary disease with gene therapy
several conditions must be met. In the first place



the gene responsible for the disease must be
known and must be isolated in a form that con¬
tains all the information needed to make the pro¬
tein. Many copies of the gene must be available,
to maximize the number of cells into which it can
be introduced. The fresh genetic material is usu¬
ally inserted into the malfunctioning cells by
means of a "vector" or carrier. Such vectors are
often obtained from viruses; but many viruses
may either kill cells or change them to cancer
cells. To prevent these adverse effects the genes
responsible for causing them are removed from
the viruses.
The first vectors used in gene therapy were
made from viruses known as "retro-viruses".
However, retro-viral vectors have important
drawbacks: they only enter into some types of
cell, and then the gene they carry acts weakly. The
major disadvantage is that they cannot become
established in cells that do not multiply. More
recently viruses of another kind, known as
"adeno-viruses", have been used extensively
because they can become established in cells that
do not multiply. Today most gene therapy is
being carried out using as a vector either adeno¬
viruses or other viruses with similar properties.
Many attempts have been made to use other
ways of delivering genes into cells. One of them
takes advantage of the ability of certain "factors"
present in the blood or other body fluids to enter
cells by interacting with "receptors" present at the
surface of cells. For this method to work, the
cell into which the gene must be introduced needs
to have a suitable receptor at its surface, and this
limits the types of cells that can be used.
A method suitable for any cell has thus been
developed, which consists in embedding the
gene into a microscopic vesicle called a "lipo¬
some", made up of an artificial membrane sim¬
ilar to those that surround the cells. When the
vesicle touches the cell, its membrane fuses with
the cellular membrane, and the gene it contains
enters the cell. This method seems to have few
drawbacks but it has not yet been used widely
enough for its efficacy to be proved. Most
recently it has been shown that naked DNA
can enter cells, opening up the possibility of an
even simpler method for gene delivery.
Inserting the gene into a suitable vector is the
first step in gene therapy; the next step is to intro¬
duce the vector into the cells. The type of cell to
be targeted depends on the nature of the disease
produced by the genetic defect. In many of the
attempts using viral vectors the cells are taken
from the body, grown in vitro, and returned to the
body after introduction of the gene. To carry
out this procedure the cells must be accessible, like
those of muscle, skin and blood, but unlike those
of internal organs. With the newer approaches
using receptor binding, liposomes, or naked
DNA, the handicap is not so great, and genes have
been introduced into the liver, lungs and muscle.
The first attempt to use gene therapy on a
human being was carried out in 1990 on a girl
affected by adenosine deaminase (ADA)

deficiency, that is, the cells of the immune system
lacked an essential enzyme and were unable to
defend her body against infections. The child
had to live under a plastic bell. She could not play
with other children and could not go to school.
The cells lacking the enzyme are accessible
because they are made in the bone marrow and
then enter the blood. The therapy was carried
out by taking the cells from the blood, intro¬
ducing the ADA gene into them, and then
returning them to the patient's blood. The result
has been good. The defence functions of the
girl's immune system were re-established and she
was able to leave her abode and go to school.
One drawback of this therapy is that the
modified cells do not last a long time, and so the
treatment must be repeated at frequent intervals.
This difficulty might be overcome by introducing
the gene into large cells of the bone marrow
known as stem cells, which have a much longer
life span. However they do not multiply readily
in vitro, and therefore the retro-viral vector would
not work for them, and, moreover, they are very
difficult to isolate. The therapy is therefore effec¬
tive but still needs much additional work.
Hope for haemophiliacs
Another promising case for gene therapy is
haemophilia, which causes a tendency to bleed
due to lack of a coagulation factor which is
made in the liver and then secreted into the
blood stream. There are two forms of the disease:
A and B, in each of which a different factor is
lacking. Attention has been concentrated on
haemophilia B because the gene responsible for
the factor (called factor IX) is of manageable
size; the other is too big for the available vectors.
Work has been carried out on dogs, which also
suffer from this form of haemophilia, using a
retro-viral vector. To replenish the blood with the
factor two strategies were followed. In one case,
cells were taken from the animal, either from

subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or the epidermis,
grown in vitro, and after introduction of the
vector, were implanted into the animal, where
they continued to produce the missing factor for
many months, and perhaps indefinitely.
The other strategy was to introduce the same
vector into the liver. To overcome the difficulty
that the liver cells do not multiply, one third of
the liver was surgically removed in order to
cause a regeneration of the organ, and there¬
fore cell multiplication. The result was a steady,
although low, production of the factor, which
again lasted for a long time, with a satisfactory
correction of the disease. These results show



that there is much hope for a long-term control
of haemophilia through gene therapy.
A disease targeted for gene therapy since its
gene was isolated a few years ago is cystic
fibrosis, in which many types of secreting cells
are affected, but especially those of the lung
with accumulation of mucus and limitation of
oxygen uptake. Results suggest that human gene
therapy holds promise as a treatment for this dis¬
ease, especially if it can be done by delivering the
gene through nebulization, which is very simple.
Attempts to treat cancer
Attempts to use gene therapy have been made
for a number of years in the treatment of cancer,
which is a genetic disease, although not usually
transmitted hereditarily. These attempts have
taken two main directions. One, applied to brain

tumours, is to introduce into the cancer cells a
vector carrying a gene that converts an anti-
herpes drug into a cell-killing substance. The
gene, in a retro-virus vector, is injected into the
cancer mass, where it is able to perform its
action because the cells are multiplying, whereas
it has no effect on normal brain cells, which do
not multiply. Experiments with cancer trans¬
planted into mice showed that the tumour was
destroyed after the mice were injected with the
anti-herpes drug. The problem in this experi¬
ment is that the vector only penetrates some of
the cells so that the remaining cells may start a
new growth (even though the toxic substance
produced under the action of the gene can pass
from one cell to another). Whether this approach
will be useful in human patients remains to be
seen; clinical trials are under way.
The other direction being taken by attempts
to use gene therapy to treat cancer is to enhance
the body's defences against the tumour. It is based
on the idea that, at least in some cases, the body
recognizes the cancer cells as foreign and should
react immunologically, causing their destruction.
This does not happen in the patient because the
immunological defences are paralyzed. The
approach is therefore to potentiate the immune
response, which is attempted in two ways. One
is to grow the immune cells in vitro in the pres¬
ence of potentiating factors, and then introduce
into them the gene for a cell-killing substance,
after which they are injected back into the patient.
Preliminary trials in patients with mela¬
noma a malignant skin tumour using the
potentiated cells without the introduction of the
gene have given encouraging results a reduction
of the skin tumours and of their metastases in the
lungs. The other approach to potentiating the
immune response consists in introducing into
the cancer cells a gene that will cause them to acti¬
vate the immune cells with which they come in
contact; once these cells are activated they can
attack cancer cells at other sites in the body. The
modified cancer cells thus constitute a kind of vac¬
cine against the cancer. Experiments in animals
have yielded promising results.
Many approaches to gene therapy can be
applied to hereditary human diseases, and some
promising results have already been obtained.
The future is bright for diseases such as adeno¬
sine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, haemophilia
and cystic fibrosis, and the prospects are good
for muscular dystrophy and for some cancers.
Development of this field is obviously still at a
very early stage, and improvements will cer¬
tainly be made in areas such as the mode of
delivery of the gene to the cells and the isolation
and growth of suitable cells. There is every
reason to expect that gene therapy will become
a powerful weapon in the treatment of diseases
caused by gene alterations. H
