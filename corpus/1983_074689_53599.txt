Anatomy
of the computer
FIVE hundred years ago, in Renais¬
sance Europe, culture was disse¬
minated by the newly-born printing
press. At the heart of the modern revolu¬
tion in communications technology is the
microcomputer.
WHAT IS A COMPUTER ? A computer
is a tool. A tool operates by taking raw
material and converting it into a product.
It is a device which performs a process.
The process is determined by people.
The computer's raw material consists
of facts or data. The product that it
generates from this raw material is infor¬
mation: The device is an array of elec¬
tronic and mechanical gadgetry which is
known as hardware. A computer is en¬
tirely dependent on instructions supplied
to it by its human users. These instruc¬
tions, or programs, which tell the com¬
puter how to carry out specific processes
or tasks are known as software.
WHAT COMPUTERS DO is to perform
prodigious feats of arithmetic, handling
millions of numbers per second. They
achieve these dazzling exploits not
because of any superhuman powers of
intelligence but because they can carry
out a few extremely simple operations
accurately and very fast.
HOW DO THEY DO THIS ? The inside
of a computer is a complex maze of on-
off switches which are used to perform
the computing activities and can also
store information in the computer's
memory. Because they are assemblies of
switches, computers work by using the
binary system of numbers. In the binary
system any number can be described by
the values 1 or 0, which can be repre¬
sented by turning a switch on (to mean 1 )
and off (to mean 0). All information in the
machine is thus reduced to two expres¬
sions, which can be variously defined as
zero (0) and one (1 ), off and on, or no and
yes, corresponding to the presence or
absence of an electrical charge at a par¬
ticular point. Early computers relied on
electromechanical on-off switches called
relays which physically opened and
closed. Today hundreds of thousands of
them can be etched on to a minuscule
fragment of silicon the microchip. The
heart of the machine is a central pro¬
cessor, a special chip on which instruc¬
tions are stored and obeyed.
Unlike the decimal system which uses
ten digits (0 to 9), the binary system uses
only two digits, 0 and 1, which can be
used to describe any number. To create a
2, you simply move 1 a column to the
left, just as you do to create a 10 in the
decimal system. Thus if zero is represent
ed by 0 and one by 1 , then two is repre¬
sented by 10, three by 1 1, four by 100,
five by 101, and so on. Thus the com¬
puter solves complex problems by break¬
ing them down into long strings of Os and
1s. (Because the computer performs its
calculations using binary numbers, com¬
putar scientists coined the word bit, from
Binary digIT, to describe the smallest
piece of information it can handle).

Programming means giving instruc¬
tions to a computer before it begins work
on what it must dó and how the work
must be done. Instructions are fed into
the computer by various methods such
as a typewriter-style keyboard which, in¬
stead of typing letters, sends electrical
impulses into the system. They are "writ¬
ten" in one of the "languages" which
computer scientists have devised to
translate human wishes into some varia¬
tion of the computer's two-word voca¬
bulary, explained above. A program thus
really involves setting up a number of
switches to go on and off to order.
The control unit in the machine's cen¬
tral processor acts on the instructions
given by the user to fetch information
from the computer's memory. This infor¬
mation is used by an arithmetic and logic
unit, which also forms part of the central
processor, for the required computing
operations.
Answers to problems can be presented
in various ways; they may be printed or
displayed on a visual display unit, which
is like a TV screen.
In addition to ordinary alphabetic or
numeric characters, the computer can
have special graphics, characters for
creating diagrams on the screen. Detail¬
ed pictures can be created by turning on
and off hundreds of thousands of
separate dots on the screen. This is how
the figure of Rodin's Thinker on our cover
was produced.
How a computer thinks
A decision tree is one way in which a computer can be made to "think".
The tree is an ordered set of rules that leads the computer to reach a conclu¬
sion. This simple diagram shows how a computer would use the decision
tree to identify one animal from among a number of possibilities. First the
computer determines whether the animal is a mammal. This example
assumes that the computer can answer that question either by carrying on
a dialogue with a person at a terminal, or by being able to analyse various
pictures of animals with a camera eye. If the animal is a mammal, the com¬
puter decides if the mammal is a carnivore. If it is a carnivore, the machine
looks for stripes to choose between a tiger and a cheetah.
