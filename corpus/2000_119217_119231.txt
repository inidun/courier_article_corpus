Education for all: schools reach out
T wo ye a rs ago, l i f e ’s opportunities were few and
far between for Underm a a . At the age of 20,
jobless and virtually destitute, she was caring
for her newborn baby after her husband had left for
the army. Her days were spent tending live s t o c k
beside her ge r (white felt tent) on the outskirts of
Darkhan in nort h e rn Mongolia.The country wa s
in the depths of an economic depression.The last
thing on her mind was politics.
To d ay Undermaa and her husband are living
d ow n t ow n ,where she works for the Mongolian Nat i o-

nal Democratic Pa rt y. For the first time she has a
steady income and a passion for politics.
In Underm a a ’s fa m i l y, politics were taboo. H e r
gr a n d father had been branded an “ e n e my of the
s t at e ” by the old Soviet-backed regime and exiled to
the countryside in 1964 for supporting one of Mon-
g o l i a ’s few dissidents.To bu ry this “ c ri m e ” ,U n d e r-
maa’s grandmother changed the family name and
moved to a new city.
It wa s n ’t until 1990, after the collapse of the old
r e gi m e ,t h at Undermaa learned of this dark past.B u t

the facts were not enough, she say s. H ow could she
analyse tyranny without the slightest notion of human
rights? The missing “ l i n k s ”came from an unlikely sour-
c e :a free sewing course adve rtised on the radio.U n d e r-
maa simply thought the course might help her get a
j o b. But it came complete with a primer on human
rights and good gove rn a n c e .
U n d e rm a a ’s classes are part of a national distan-
ce education project,“ L e a rning for Life”, run by the
Mongolian gove rnment and UN E S C O with the fin a n-
cial assistance of the Danish aid agency, D a n i d a .A
total of 3,000 young students have tuned into we e k-
ly radio programmes on job-oriented topics rangi n g
from basic marketing to computer skills and carp e t -
m a k i n g . In between progr a m m e s ,students follow exe r-
cises in textbooks and meet in groups eve ry week or
so for learning sessions with trained tutors. S p e c i a l
d e m o n s t r ations are organized for hands-on training
in the more technical skills.
While the focus is on helping students adjust to
the country ’s economic transition to a more open eco-
n o my, the project also aims to prepare them for more
open gove rn m e n t , which explains the section on
human ri g h t s. At the same time, the aim is to rein-
force the educational gains made under the previous
communist stat e , notably with literacy rates in Rus-
sian Cyrillic script of about 85 per cent.
Distance education is not entirely new to Mon-
g o l i a , one of the few countries where nomads make
up 20 per cent of the population.During commu-
n i s m , s t at e - run radio and television stations bea-
med educational programmes across the gr a s s y
steppes. But there was no need for a massive cam-
p a i g n , as virtually all children received schooling at
county or provincial centres—even children of her-
ding families living on the livestock co-operat i ve s
which dotted the vast Gobi Desert . Room and board
were paid for by the stat e . E ven unive rsities we r e
free for those who gained admission.
But those days are ove r. U n i ve rsity education is
no longer free, l e aving those without means no other
option than to forego higher education and join the
wo r k f o r c e . Local NGOs are concerned that children
are dropping out of school and living on the streets in
cities like the capital, U l a a n b a at a r. In the rural areas,
m a ny children stay at home to help their parents tend
their herds of goat s , ya k s , camels and hors e s.
Against this backdrop, the coalition gove rn m e n t
elected in 1996 jumped at the chance of revitalizing
the old concept of distance education with a new set
of part n e rs.At the top of the ladder,UN E S C O p r ov i d e s
the technical and conceptual experience to make the
most of the funding provided by Danida ($1.7 million
for five ye a rs ) .
Pooling re s o u rc e s
On the next ru n g, the education ministry is for-
ging a new gi ve-and-take relationship with other minis-
t ri e s.For example,p a rt of the project money has gone
to re-equipping the studios of national and regi o n a l
public radio stations which are not just broadcasting
p r o grammes but helping to produce them.Jo u rn a l i s t s
team up with education experts and bu s i n e s s p e o p l e
to produce shows on topics ranging from accountan-
cy to starting a small restaurant. P ri vate publishers
h ave also got in on the act,and are producing new text-
books on sewing,h a i r d r e s s i n g,p h o t o gr a p hy and other
skills that are a far cry from 
standard school subjects.
This pooling of resources includes the key actors ,
t u t o rs , who supposedly volunteer but are often desi-
g n ated by local authori t i e s.Most of them are school-
t e a c h e rs but some are economists, accountants or
other professionals, who take crash courses to assu-
me their new role.
Initial results are encouragi n g . In an eva l u at i o n
study involving 500 students in Ulaanbaat a r ,a l m o s t

s t a rted their own businesses within six months of
finishing the cours e s.About 20 students had enrol-
led in college.The rest were still looking for work.
But the real test lies in the “ d i s a d va n t a g e d ”c o u n-
t ry s i d e , where 90 per cent of the project part i c i p a n t s
l i ve . Tu t o rs , who make just $10-$20 for the entire
c o u rse (4-6 months), meet 15 families each month.
Tr avelling mostly by camel or on hors e b a c k , the tutor
can cover distances of 80 kilometres to reach the
families scattered across the steppes, which have vir-
tually no roads, telephones and a monthly mail deli-
ve ry at best. G i ven the harsh conditions, e s p e c i a l l y
d u ring the long fri gid winter, the tutors cannot set a
p e rmanent teaching schedule and must make the
most of their time with students. Most will liaise with
one family member who teaches the others.
M i n i s t ry of Enlightenment (Science and Educa-
tion) spokesman P.Te n gis says the gove rnment sees
no better option for rural people than long-distance
e d u c at i o n .“ E ver since the livestock were pri vat i z e d ,
families need all the help they can get,” said Te n gi s.
With few families willing or able to send their children
to dorm i t o ry schools,Te n gis explains that “kids from
h e r d e rs ’ families are spending their entire childhood
out on the steppes. . . . So as long as we have our
n o m a d s , we will need distance learn i n g .”
The gove rnment says it plans to take over the pro-
ject—and could one day offer accredited distance
c o u rses complete with exams and diplomas. But the
same spokesperson also admits that this could be
decades away — M o n g o l i a ’s transition is far from ove r ,
l e aving few resources for anything but the basics. ■
