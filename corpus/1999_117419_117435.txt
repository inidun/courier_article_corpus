The s t i g m a of A i d s

Discrimination against people with A i d s
is a major obstacle to fighting the epidemic.
The solution lies in education
w Member of the the Canadian
HIV/Aids Legal Network 
In her village in Kwa z u l u - N at a l , the South A f ri c a n
p r ovince hardest hit by the Aids epidemic, G u g u
Dlamini died because of the disease. But it wa s n ’t
the virus per se that killed her.She was accused by fel-
l ow - v i l l a g e rs of having brought shame on the com-
munity by talking publicly about being HIV- p o s i t i ve .
When she was beaten by a neighbour who advised her
to keep quiet, she went to the police but they did
nothing to protect her.The next night, v i l l a g e rs at t a c-
ked her house before stoning her and beating her to
d e at h .
While this story has gone round the wo r l d ,t h e r e
are other less bloody but just as revealing tales that
receive no attention.HIV-positive children are the
targets of other children’s angry parents who do
their utmost to have them expelled from the nur-
s e ry or school or excluded from sports activities.
Some doctors and dentists refuse to treat people
with A i d s. Community help projects regularly come
up against the refusal of local inhabitants to have
such “ p l a g u e - s t ri c k e n ” people living in their neigh-
b o u r h o o d .E ven dead, these people continue to ins-
til fear, with some funeral parlours refusing to accept
their remains.
Victims of such discri m i n ation are often poor
and isolated.They do not dare complain about how
they are treated for fear of making things wo rs e .T h e
few statistics about them hardly reflect the extent
of the phenomenon.The number of known cases is
just the tip of the iceberg.
Marginalized groups
As well as being frequently ostracized by ordi-
n a ry folk, H I V- p o s i t i ve people are sometimes also
hit by discri m i n at o ry law s. Using prevention as a
pretext,governments adopt laws which violate the
U n i ve rsal Declaration of Human Rights. O f fic i a l
public health programmes are sometimes the source
of violations.There are plenty of examples.
Blood tests have been made compulsory for cer-
tain “target populat i o n s ” such as newborn babies
in New York stat e ,p rison inmates in at least 18 U. S .
states and foreigners wishing to stay more than 30
d ays in such countries as Egypt, B u l g a ria and Geor-
gi a . In some U. S .s t at e s ,d o c t o rs are obliged to pass
on to the authorities the names of patients who have
tested positive for HIV. As a ru l e , H I V- p o s i t i ve
people are refused entry to the United States.
In a collection of essays entitled “Ethics and Law
in the Study of A I D S ” (published in 1992 by the
Pa n a m e rican Health Organizat i o n ) ,K at a rina To m a-
s e v s k i , an intern ational human rights expert ,p o i n t s
out that “if one were to read the Unive rsal Decla-
r ation of Human Rights with the aim of finding out
which human rights have been affected by various
responses to A i d s , one would see that most, if not
a l l , basic human rights and freedoms, laid down as
the common standard of achievement for humanity
more than 40 ye a rs ago, h ave been challenged, v i o-
l at e d , or denied in the context of HIV/Aids.” E x p e rt s
have pointed out in vain that no medical or public
health reason justifies measures restricting the ri g h t s
of HIV- p o s i t i ve people.These measures are usually
i n e f f e c t i ve and even counterp r o d u c t i ve . And ye t ,
discrimination continues.
Most ill people evoke compassion but Aids tri g-
g e rs the opposite reaction.The stigma of HIV is tied
to powerful social symbols, sources of prejudice and
intolerance towards groups which may va ry from
one country to the next but all share a common trait:
they are people who were marginalized even before
the emergence of A i d s.They include immigr a n t s ,
r e f u g e e s , people in pri s o n , male and female prosti-
t u t e s ,n at i ve peoples, d rug addicts and homosexuals.
It is sometimes enough just to belong to one of these
so-called “ ri s k ” groups to be considered a “ t h r e at ”
and thus presumed guilty of spreading the epide-
m i c. People who help them are often regarded as
their “accomplices”.
The world appears to be divided in two. On one
side are people with Aids and those who help them

and on the other, those who imagine they are safe
from the disease and do not feel concern e d . Some in
the first group avoid health and social serv i c e s
because of the stigma to which they are subjected
and their fear of discri m i n at i o n .Those who most
need help, i n f o rm ation and education are thus for-
ced underground which makes them even more vul-
n e r a b l e . Some people refuse to be tested for A i d s ,
p r e f e rring not to know. O t h e rs keep their infection
secret or else deny it.
People in the second group may be sticking their
head in the sand like ostri c h e s , but they are not for
t h at matter spared by the epidemic.Their self-defence
mechanisms feed their ignorance and create illusions
t h at gi ve them a false sense of securi t y.They think HIV
only strikes at “ ri s k ” groups—sealed communities
with which they have no contact. Believing that HIV
respects social frontiers makes them vulnerable in
t u rn .At an institutional leve l , such a belief slows dow n
awareness programmes and helps to reduce the fun-
ding they at t r a c t . So the stigma and discri m i n at i o n
t h at accompany Aids are not only consequences of
the epidemic but also contri bute to its spread.
The late Jo n athan Mann, who was head of the
World Health Organizat i o n ’s Special Progr a m m e
on Aids and of Harvard Unive rs i t y ’s François-Xav i e r
Bagnoud Center, insisted that human rights feat u r e
prominently in the campaign against HIV. A r g u i n g
t h at such protection of ill or HIV-infected people
was vital for ethical, judicial and practical reasons, h e
stressed that a community could not deal effecti-
vely with the disease if it failed to respect the basic
right of people to have a say in decisions concern i n g
their own future.
Protecting the victims
Although the stigma of HIV/Aids is tied to igno-
r a n c e ,i n f o rming people about the virus and the ri s k
of catching it is not enough to eradicate it.Preven-
t i ve education has to be accompanied by seri o u s
e d u c ation about discri m i n at i o n , but this is still at
an embryonic stage.
At the intern ational leve l ,h e a l t h , legal and ethics
e x p e rt s ,r e p r e s e n t at i ves of communities affected by
the disease and study groups have been insisting for
several years on the need to ensure that policies to
reduce the spread of Aids and care for its victims
respect their rights and their dignity, whether they
h ave the disease or are just at ri s k . But the appeals of
the experts will remain a dead letter without broad
public understanding and sufficient will, e s p e c i a l l y
on the part of political decision-makers.
The UN High Commission for Human Rights
and UNAIDS in 1998 published 12 guidelines for
s t ates on the rights of individuals concern i n g
H I V / A i d s. One of them recommended laws to pro-
tect victims of discri m i n ation in pri vate and public
sectors while guaranteeing respect for privacy and
c o n f i d e n t i a l i t y. Another focused on one of the
sources of discri m i n ation and called on states to
“promote the wide and ongoing distri bution of crea-
t i ve educat i o n , training and media progr a m m e s
explicitly designed to change attitudes of discri m i-
n ation and stigmat i z ation associated with HIV/Aids
to understanding and acceptance.”
The current gap between the quantity of recom-
m e n d ations and a sluggish bu r e a u c r a cy is glari n g .
In Aids prevention campaigns, the issue of discri-
m i n ation often falls by the wayside and is rarely dis-
cussed in schools.The odd educational film at t a c k s
the stigma but no-one can boast of a broad aware-
ness campaign that has an important impact on
society.
The main features of education against discri-
m i n ation must be worked out in each country accor-
ding to the social context and the evolution of the
d i s e a s e . After the targets and participants have been
c h o s e n , steps must be taken to create a fri e n d l i e r
atmosphere for people who have Aids and who fa c e
rejection and indifference.This must also be done
for their families and friends as well as all those invo l-
ved in the fight against the epidemic.We must not
forget that the disease is the enemy, not the people
who have it. n
