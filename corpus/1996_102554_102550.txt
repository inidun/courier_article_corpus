auritius emerged from the
Indian Ocean some eight mil¬
lion years ago, and since then many
animal and plant species some of
them unique developed there in
extreme geographical isolation.
The island lies some 800 kilo¬
metres southeast of Madagascar,
and, with Rodrigues, the Sey¬
chelles and Reunion, belongs to
the Mascarene group of islands.
Inland from a fringe of sandy
beaches, peaceful lagoon and coral
reefs, is rugged and mountainous
terrain. On this volcanic island of
idyllic greenery and flowers,
people of a variety of origins and
religions live on good terms. The
climate is temperate, although
between December and April
there may be occasional violent
cyclones.
Meteoric economic growth
based on sugar cane, tea and
tourism has brought full employ¬
ment to Mauritius and turned it
into what its people like to call the
"tiger of the Indian Ocean".
Although the government has been
concerned about the environment
since the 1970s, it took a demon¬
stration of international solidarity
by conservationists before part of
the island's animal and plant her¬
itage could be saved. Today it is
fair to say that Mauritius has
become a veritable laboratory for
the restoration of endangered
species.
PREDATORS AND HEALERS
When people arrived in Mauritius
in the 16th century the stage was
set for an ecological disaster. The
dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and the
solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), two
big flightless birds, were soon
exterminated, and subsequent
changes in habitats, deforestation
for arable land, reforestation with
non-endemic trees and the intro¬
duction of certain animals from
outside led to the disappearance
of several species of birds , of giant
lizards, snakes, tortoises and
countless insects and plants.
Until Mauritius became inde¬
pendent in 1968 it was visited or
ruled in turn by the Portuguese,
the Dutch, the French and the
British, each of whom introduced
animals which in some cases
became pests and preyed on
endemic species. Examples
include the Timor deer (Cervus
timorensis) and the wild boar (Sus
scrofa), which damage the forest
and hence the island's birdlife
the deer eat the indigenous
plantlife, and the boars uproot
young plants. Monkeys (Macaca
fascicularis) and brown rats
{Rattus norvegicus) raid nests and
eat birds' eggs and nestlings, mon¬
gooses {Herpestes auropunctatus)
and feral cats (Felis cattus) eat
birds at all stages of development.
The Mauritius kestrel (Falco
punctatus), the island's only
endemic bird of prey, has been
almost wiped out, partly because
its recently fledged young are easy
prey since they spend much time
on the ground in the first few days
after leaving the nest, and partly
because the birds have been vic¬
tims of the pesticides which are
widely used on the island. Only
two pairs were known to survive in
the 1970s and attempts were
made to get them to breed in cap¬
tivity. Between 1984 and 1991
235 young kestrels were released
in the wild, and the goal of around
a hundred nesting pairs should
now be within reach. The pink
pigeon (Columba mayeri) was also
threatened with extinction.

(founded by the British naturalist
Gerald Durrell) reproduced and

site for raising threatened birds
has since been established in
Black River Gorges National
Park. The large echo parakeet
{Psittacula eques echo) has also
been saved in the nick of time.
Only a dozen of these birds were
left in 1986.
BLACK RIVER GORGES
NATIONAL PARK
The creation of Black River
Gorges National Park was an
important step in nature conserva¬
tion. Proposed by the World Con¬
servation Union (IUCN) in 1973,
the project finally came to
fruition in 1994. The Park covers
6,574 hectares in the southwest
of Mauritius, where the land rises
to an altitude of 817 metres. Here
too endemic plantlife is being sti¬
fled by exotic plants such as the
Chinese guava (Psidium cat-
tleianum), a bush imported from
Brazil that monopolizes space and
light in the undergrowth, privet
(Ligustrum robustum) from Sri
Lanka, the Madagascar traveller's-
tree {Ravenala madagascariensis)
and "Framboise marron" (Rubus
alceifolius) a thorny bramble that
forms dense thickets and clambers
up host trees, often several metres
high.
In a carefully fenced-off corner
of the park workers have pulled
out all the exotic plants by hand.
This is a frustrating job because
the weeds will grow back if only a
small fragment of the plant is left
in the ground. This was an urgent
job, however, for 80 per cent of the
island's 900 plants, 300 of which
are endemic to Mauritius, are
threatened, and only about a dozen
specimens survive of 51 of them.
The Ministry of Agriculture
has received financial aid from the
World Bank and technical assis¬
tance from the Mauritian Wildlife
Appeal Fund (MWAF), a non-gov¬
ernmental organization that in
1986 took in hand the islet of Ile-
Aux-Aigrettes, which lies offshore
from the town of Mahébourg.
IUCN botanist Wendy Strahm
drew up a plan to eliminate all
animal and plant intruders, while
endemic plants were grown in
nurseries. The extraordinary
"Café Marron" (Ramosmania het-
erophylla), a single specimen of
which survived, was propagated
from cuttings at the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew in the United
Kingdom.
THE DARK SIDE
OF PARADISE
Despite these spectacular suc¬
cesses, Mauritius has not avoided
the problems caused by rapid
development and a big increase in
tourism. The island's 426 indus¬
tries consume large quantities of
water (up to 5,000 m3 per day)
and discharge effluent often
untreated into the rivers. Some
60,000 tonnes of fertilizer a
season, or 600 kilos per hectare,
are used in sugar cane production,
which occupies about 90 per cent
of the arable land. More than
1,000 tonnes of pesticides are sold
each year to farmers, and

Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland
(1865) by Lewis
Carroll. A
flightless bird
native to
Mauritius, the
dodo was hunted
for its flesh and
became extinct
around 1560.
according to a report on the "State
of the Environment in Mauritius"
prepared for the Rio Earth
Summit, these products threaten
the quality of drinking water and
the lagoon. Measures taken by the
government include renovating and
extending the sewer system (which
in 1994 collected only 18 per cent
of all effluent) and building treat¬
ment plants and outfalls into the
sea.
More than 300,000 tourists
swell the million-strong population
of Mauritius every year. In 1990
tourism represented 3.1 per cent
of GDP. It has been estimated
that the island's maximum poten¬
tial for tourist reception is about
one tourist per three inhabitants.
The figure of 400,000 tourists
projected for the year 2000 will
require a 15 to 40 per cent growth
in the island's hotel capacity. This
is an incentive for promoters
attracted by the temptation of
easy money to cover the northern
and western coasts with concrete,
without waiting for the results of
"Environmental Impact Assess¬
ments" carried out by the author¬
ities. Each year a million tonnes of
sand are scooped from the lagoon.
At Pomponette, for example, the
coast has retreated by five metres
in the last five years. The authori¬
ties have restricted sand mining to
specific sites, and a project to
restore the beach is underway.
Although 800 tonnes of solid

YOUTHFUL HANDS TURN
WASTE TO GOOD USE
household and industrial wastes
are collected every day, they are
disposed of in open dumps, and
plastic bags and bottles litter the
countryside and the shore.
Another problem is that of waste
borne to the coast by winds and
currents. In 1992 there were only
two recycling plants for glass,
paper and cardboard. In the last
few years eight official dumps
have been or are being rehabili¬
tated, and the construction of two
sanitary landfill sites is planned.
In Mauritius, as elsewhere, pro¬
tection of the environment means
that everyone must give a hand.
Some forty environmental organi¬
zations registered with and sup¬
ported by the Ministry of the Envi¬
ronment are working hard to
inform and educate the popula¬
tion, particularly children. There
are many environmental clubs,
sponsored by a wide range of
bodies including village councils,
and young people's and women's
associations. Hopefully, the
younger generation will remember
that they live in a corner of par¬
adise and will do what their elders
have left undone.
