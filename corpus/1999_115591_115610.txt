The best account of what it means to be a foot-
ball fan has been written by English wri t e r
Nick Hornby, who describes in his book Fever
Pitch his relationship with Arsenal, the long-esta-
blished London football club that plays in Englan-
d ’s Premier League. I t ’s like being marri e d .But not
like today’s marriages, which don’t last as long as
c o u rt s h i p. N o, this is a stri c t , s p a rt a n ,V i c t o ri a n ,
t i l l - d e at h - d o - u s - p a rt kind of marri a g e .“A holy mar-
ri a g e ,” s ays the Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerr a
in his song “Like a bee in the honeycomb”.
I t ’s also a marriage in which there’s no place for
i n fid e l i t y. In Colombia, a fan of Bogotá’s Santa Fe
team is never going to have a two - week affair with
M i l l o n a ri o s , the city’s other big team.At the outside
he might have a furt i ve and fleeting platonic rela-
tionship with teams from other cities, such as Depor-
t i vo Cali, Unión Magdalena or Júnior de Barr a n-
q u i l l a . But such innocent betrayals end abruptly on
the day when these teams play Santa Fe .
The fan behaves like an exe m p l a ry husband.
He is tender and tru e . He accepts his team’s defects
just as a husband accepts that his wife is not as slim
as she was the day he fell in love with her, or that she
snores, has dark circles under her eyes, or pulls a
long face for 18 hours of the day. There may be
short-lived outbursts of fury when the team plays
b a d l y. (Santa Fe have gone twenty ye a rs without
winning a title.) Except for his angry comments on
p l aye rs who are slow on the turn or incapable of
defending the team’s colours.The fan always ends
up in the stadium, a lways accompanies his team
through thick and thin and always cheers them on
with the refrain: “Olé oléolá/I love you more and
more each day.”
Spine-tingling
sensations
And just as the husband pays all the household
bills without flinching even though he may think
t h e y ’re outrageously high, the fan squanders his
wealth on the team. And how! In the past he just
had to pay for tickets. Not any more. Now he also
has to put his hand in his pocket to buy his team’s
T-shirt (its design and manufacturer change every
six months or so but he has to have the latest one),
its scarf, banner, the official record of the suppor-
ters’songs.
And what does he get in return? A lot of intan-
gibles that only the true fan can really appreciat e .A
sense of tribal belonging that’s like no other expe-
rience in the wo r l d , whether it’s an electoral vic-
t o ry, a rock concert with a 100,000-strong audience
or a military victory.T h at tingling in the spine whe-
n e ver your team scores a goal or wins a mat c h
against its time-honoured enemy gi ves way to an
i n d e s c ribable sensation that can last for day s , if not
ye a rs. In 1992 Santa Fe beat Millonarios 7 : 3 .E ve n
t o d ay it’s an unforgettable memory for the suppor-
t e rs of the reds and they rub it in whenever they
meet fans of the blues.
It’s a reason for clinging on to life:I can’t ima-
gine dying without knowing which team is going
to win this ye a r ’s championship or how many goals
we ’re going to beat Millonarios by the next time
we play them. It doesn’t matter whether yo u ’ ve cho-
sen the right team (Atletico de Bilbao or Real Socie-
d a d , Boca Juniors or River Plat e , Inter or AC Milan,
A rsenal or Tottenham Hotspur), your football team
is neither more nor less than the love of your life.
