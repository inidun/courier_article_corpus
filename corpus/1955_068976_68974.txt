CHILDREN MEET TURBULENT CONCERT PIANIST "PICCOLOVSKI", WHOSE COMIC ACT CONTRASTS WELL WITH STAGECRAFT OF "VENETIAN SERENADE" SCENE.
Twelve hundred marionettes, 15 tons of equipment and
props, 100 packing cases, 1,000 costumes and 40 artists,
technicians, musicians and singers these are some of
the factors which go to make up the famous Italian
"Piccoli" Theatre of Vittorio Podrecca.
It is 43 years since Podrecca, then a journalist, art critic
and secretary of a musical academy in Rome, decided to
make his favourite childhood toy his life's work. After
minute studies of the art and history of marionettes, he
gathered a group around his little wooden actors, three feet
high, and presented his first spectacle of opera, variety and
circus scenes in miniature.
His blending of the decorative, the musical and the dra¬
matic was an immediate success in Rome. Since then, the
"Teatro dei Piccoli" has been round the world three times
with Its remarkable repertory of operas, variety shows, fairy
tales, ballet and folklore scenes. The reactions of audiences
everywhere were well summed up by one theatre critic who
wrote: "The quaint notion that the puppet show is exclusi¬
vely for children has been gently buried by Signor Podrecca,
who uses it brilliantly for all its quality of humour, satire
and sophistication."
Podrecca's art represents an advance in the intricate
technique of puppet articulation. The result is a skilful
combination of dancing figures, acting and comedy, music
and singing. Podrecca is today recognized as one of the
great craftsmen and artists of his time, and his performances
have a depth and richness which go beyond the realm of
mere entertainment. (Photos Vieno, Rome ; Vego, Paris arid
