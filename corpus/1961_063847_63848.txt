WORLD PROFILE
OF LEISURE
AND LEARNING
Britons read more newspapers
than anyone else on the face
of the earth, but Soviet citizens
have the largest number of public
library books at their disposal. No
one goes to the cinema as often as
an Austrian, even though Japan leads
the world in the number of full-
length films produced annually. The
United States has the most university
students, but the U.S.S.R. has the
most students studying engineering.
These are only a few of the nuggets
to be gleaned from 182 pages of
statistical ore contained in the
newest edition of "Basic Facts and
Figures" a Unesco annual publication
which, at first sight, is about as
attractive reading as a bank state¬
ment or a telephone directory.
But, despite this dense packing of
"international statistics relating to
education, culture and mass com¬
munication" into lists of countries
(no less than 219 countries and
territories are mentioned), columns of
figures and slabs of footnotes, a
profile of our world in its learning
and at its leisure can be drawn from
"Basic Facts and Figures."
/^k OME of the data are ím-
ir pressive (only 59 out of 1,000
Americans do not possess radios)
and some are rather startling (the
world's most fortunate schoolchil¬
dren, and perhaps the world's most
fortunate teachers at least in terms
of number of pupils per teacher
are to be found on St Pierre and
Miquelon, two French islands off the
coast of Canada, where there are
only twelve children per teacher).
Some of it is tragic, too, in the long
ranks of nations with only 16 or 17 or
25 per cent of their school-age
children actually afforded an oppor¬
tunity to go to school.
Let's turn to a few of the facets
of this statistical portrait (or better,
panorama) of the world, because no
one could hope to take in all of them
in one dose.
Thumbing through the pages of
"Basic Facts and Figures", you learn
that the United States leads the
world in the number of university
students, with 3,236,414, foUowed by
the U.S.S.R. with 2,260,000 (287,164
American students are listed as
studying engineering and the parallel
figure in the Soviet Union is 765,000).
Next come India with 833,450
students and Japan with 636,232.
France leads in Europe with 226,173
students, followed by the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy in
a near dead-heat : 164,015 and
163,945 respectively.
One word of warning: there is
not much agreement through¬
out the world as to what constitutes
a "university student." As a famous
man is supposed to have said,
"There are lies, damned lies and
statistics."
But the figures do show the United
States also leads the world in the
annual number of university
graduates 438,023 followed by the
U.S.S.R. with 290,700 (the two leaders
change places in the figures for
scientific and technical graduates
114,600 in the U.S.S.R. and 96,509 in
the U.S.A.).
More foreign students 47,245, to
be exact study in the United States
than anywhere else. The next biggest
attraction is France with 17,456
foreign students followed by the
Federal Republic of Germany with
15,115.
Rather scanty figures on over-all
percentages of national income spent
in 1958 on education show Puerto
Rico in the lead with 6.9% and Fin¬
land second with 6,5%.
Now for a digest of what the world
does in its spare time: for the
Soviet citizen, there are 752,604,000
public library books, compared to
200,000,000 in the United States and
71,000,000 in the United Kingdom, the
two runners-up. The U.S.S.R. also
ranks first in the number of museum-
goers with 39,900,000 annually, com¬
pared to 10,994,000 in the United
Kingdom and 10,439,000 in Japan
(the three leaders according to
available figures).
Newspapers are another story.
Here are the readership rates per
1,000 in the world's most newspaper-
14
minded countries: United Kingdom,
573; Sweden, 464; Luxembourg, 429;
and Finland, 420. The United States
leads in the number of daily papers,
1,745, but sells them to only 327 out
of every 1,000 Americans. On the
other hand, 475 out of every 1,000
Americans read magazines of general
interest, the highest figure in the
world.
When the American buys a news¬
paper, he is offered an impressive
number of pages. That is why news¬
print consumption per capita in the
United States is 33.6 kilogrammes
(74 pounds), the world's highest
figure, followed by 27.2 kilogrammes
(60 lbs) in Australia and 25.5 Kg.
(56 lbs) in New Zealand.
Other countries appear when you
turn to the chapter of film attend¬
ance. Austrians are the most
avid cinema-goers: 17.4 per thousand.
Next come Malta with 17.3, New
Zealand with 16.7 and the U.S.S.R.
with 16.2. In North America, Green¬
land with 14.8 outstrips the United
States with 12.5.
Who makes the most pictures?
The answer is Japan, whose 516 full-
length films in 1958 rank it first over
India, 295; the United States, 288;
Hong Kong, 240; France, 126; and the
United Kingdom, 121.
Latest available figures (at the end
of 1959) for television-viewing show
that the country with the most sets
per thousand inhabitants is Monaco
(a staggering 524). Next are the
United States, 290; Canada, 196; the
United Kingdom, 195; and Bermuda,
182.
Again, leadership changes
hands when you turn to
books. First is the U.S.S.R.
with 69,072 new titles annuaUy,
followed by Japan, 24,152; the
United Kingdom, 20,690; the Federal
Republic of Germany, 16,552; the
United States, 14,876 and France,
12,032.
The Soviet Union also published the
most translations in 1958 a total of
4,457 in the various languages of the
Union followed by Germany (figures
are for the Federal and the Democra¬
tic Republics) with 2,512 and Czecho¬
slovakia with 1,462. English was the
world's most translated language that
year: 9,675 works out of a total of
29,209. Next were Russian, 4,320;
French, 4,010, and German, 2,951.
There is some eclectic reading, too,
to be found among the world's five
most translated authors in 1958.
They are Lenin, Shakespeare, Jule's
Verne, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in
that order, with Gorky and Simenon
as runners-up. The world's most
translated single book, though, was
the Bible.
