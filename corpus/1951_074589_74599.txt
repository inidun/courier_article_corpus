FUNDAMENTAL PARHCLES
WHAT ARE THEY ?
Is matter infinitely divisible, oris there a limit to the process
of cutting a substance into
finer and finer bits ? The ancient
Greeks, pondering this question, de-
cided that eventually a limit, an
ultimate particle, would be reach-
ed,-that beyond this point no
further sub-division would be pos-
sible. The idea remained almost
forgotten for over 2. 000 years. Then,
about the middle of the 17th cen-
tury, the notion began to be reviv-
ed, and there grew up a vivid
picture of matter consisting of
indestructible atoms, with all the
atoms of a given chemical element
alike but different from those of
every other element. By the end of
the 19th century, the atom was
firmly established as our first
"fundamental"particle-an ulti-
mate unit of matter, the simplest
and most primitive bit of substance
that can exist by itself.
But even before the last century
was out, new researches and disco-
veries began to undermine the su-
preme position of the atom. For
Thomson, by discovering the elec-
tron (see"What are Electrons"in
the COURIER for December,
1950), showed that the atom itself
has an internal structure. More
important, the electron is better
deserving of the term"fundamen-
tal particle"since all electrons, re-
gardless of their source, are iden-
tical. By the end of the first quar-
ter of the present century the phy-
sicist knew a great deal about the
number and arrangement of the
electrons in the outer reaches of
the atom, but little about the
constitution of the atomic nucleus.

Not many years passed before
Rutherford, in England, showed
that a second fundamental par-
ticle, the proton, i-s a constituent
of the compact, central nucleus.
Mutual Annihilation
WITH the electron and theproton, physicists and che-
mists complacently felt that
they had attained an understand-
ing of the structure of matter.
Science, however, refused to stand
still. Before long, grave difficulties
came to light in connection with
attempts to explain the structure
of the nucleus. Happily, order was
again restored with the discovery
of a third elementary unit-the
neutron. As the name implies, this
strange particle carries no electric
charge. Neutrons were promptly
incorporated into the theory of
nuclear structure, with the result
that the whole picture was
immeasurably clarified.
Now science was in the position
of having to admit the existence
of three kinds of construction ma-
terials. Ironically, a fourth-the
positron-was unexpectedly added
within the year, as a result of ob-
servations on cosmic rays. The
new particle possesses the same
amount of mass and electrical
charge as the electron, but its
charge is positive, while that of the
electron is negative. Positrons
differ from the previously dis-
covered particles in having only a
transitory existence-they can be
created and destroyed. Within a
few thousandths of a millionth of
a second of its birth, a positron
inevitably encounters its opposite
- an electron-and the two anni-
hilate each other in a burst of
radiant energy-a prime example
of the now famous Einstein equi-
valence of matter and energy.
What may also be considered
one of the basic particles, but in a
slightly different sense, had been
discovered much earlier. It is the
photon, or quantum of radiant
energy (see"What is the Quantum
Theory"in the COURIER for No-
vember, 1950). This entity has
many of the attributes of a part-
icle ; for example, when it crashes
into matter it is able to knock
electrons out of the atoms. But
perhaps the most curious fact
about photons is that they have
never been observed to exist when
at rest, but only when moving
with the speed of light.
The Ghostly Neutrino
A NOTHER particle whose exist-ence had been suggested ear-
lier is the neutrino-the most
ghostly and intangible of all. As a
matter of fact, this member of the
company has never been directly
observed, but its presence seems to
be required in certain sub-atomic
processes in order to balance their
energy account. If the neutrino
exists at all, it must have no elec-
tric charge and virtually no mass.
However, it may turn out to be a
mere makeshift, of no further use
once our understanding of nature
advances sufficiently.
With no fewer than half a dozen
recognized particles confronting
them, scientists were becoming re-
conciled to the fact that the world
is not as simply constituted as
they once had hoped. Then, be-
ginning in 1935, a whole new
class of particles was discovered,
again through work on cosmic
rays. These were the mesons
which can be neutral or carry
either positive or negative charges.
As presently established, they
exist with at. least three distinct
masses. Mesons, like positrons and
neutrons, are unstable and almost
immediately break down into other
particles. The mesons of inter-
mediate mass are believed to be
responsible for holding the nucleus
of the atom together.
Mesons provide us with some of
the most urgent and most baffling
problems of modern physics, and
they are being investigated inten-
sively in many laboratories. The
new high-powered machines capa-
ble of giving tremendous energies
to sub-atomic particles have ac-
tually succeeded in manufacturing
mesons. Still more powerful ma-
chines, now planned or being built,
hold promise of even more excit-
ing discoveries.
