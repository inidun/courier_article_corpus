In Puerto Princesa, capital of the
Philippine province of Palawan,
the new town hall offers a
panoramic view over Honda Bay,
the turquoise blue sea and a string
of islands bordered by white sandy
shores. The presence of a rusting
and heavily loaded logging truck
right in front of the building strikes
a jarring note. It has been parked
there deliberately. The massive
logs, cut illegally, were seized with
the truck and put on show to
remind the inhabitants of Palawan
island that logging in virgin forest is
now strictly forbidden.
Palawan, the largest of 1,768
islands that make up the province of
the same name, is dubbed the "last
!
frontier" because of its location on
the southwestern edge of the
Philippine archipelago, not far from
Borneo. Covering approximately
14,000 km2 and stretching eight to
40 kilometres across, the island con¬
sists of a 425-kilometre-long moun¬
tain range (highest peak 2,085
metres above sea level) and plains
covering about 118,350 hectares.
From the air, the island looks
very green, seemingly covered by
lush vegetation. But appearances
can be deceptive. The fate of
Palawan's forest is a snapshot of
what has been happening in the
Philippines since logging in virgin
forest was banned in 1991.
According to the current Under
Secretary of State for the
Environment, Palawan lost 19,000
hectares of forest every year
between 1977 and 1988. At this
rate, the island might have been
stripped of more than 50 per cent
of its 780,000-hectare forest cover
within 20 years.
The fight to save the forest
Despite the important economic
interests bound up with the logging
trade, ecologists launched a cam¬
paign in 1988 and soon mobilized
public opinion in favour of defend¬
ing the forest. A leading environ¬
mental group, the Ilaribon ["King
by France Bequette
of the Birds"] Foundation (named
for the Monkey-eating Eagle, an
endangered Philippine species),
drafted a petition calling for a total
logging ban. It collected one million
signatures and was presented to
former President Corazón Aquino.
Three years later, logging was
banned by law. A battle had been
won, but not the war. In the late
1980s, illegal timber exports were
estimated to total about $800 mil¬
lion annually, approximately four
times the officially recorded earn¬
ings from forest-product exports.
Illegal logging is still going on
today. Near the truck placed sym¬
bolically in front of Puerto
Princesa town hall, the police pile
up confiscated loads of timber.
The ecologically minded Palawan
Sun newspaper reported that in
the space of two months earlier
this year, authorities on the west
coast seized timber with a retail
value of 381,196 pesos ($15,250).
Deforestation can have far-
reaching and devastating conse¬
quences, as Palawan's governor
Salvador P. Socrates stressed when
he visited two towns ravaged by
flash floods in September 1995.
"Our problem is that there are no
more trees to stop the water from
coming down the mountain," he
said. Besides provoking floods,
deforestation removes the fine
layer of earth covering the moun¬
tainside. Swept away by water, the
silt cascades from denuded lands
into the island's fishing grounds
and settles on coral reefs, which in
turnare suffocated.
Dynamite and cyanide
A danger of another kind is threat¬
ening Palawan's marine life,
renowned for its beauty and great

variety of algae, fish, molluscs and
shellfish. A number of fishermen in
the area are using dynamite and
cyanide, two illegal and destruc¬
tive practices. Dynamite kills fish
but also damages coral reefs.
Cyanide paralyzes fish so that
they can he caught alive and then
sent by plane in water-tanks, three
tons at a time, in order to supply
aquariums or restaurants in the
Far East, where the consumption
of certain fish such as lapulapu is
believed to bring prosperity and
longevity.
In Hong Kong, random tests for
cyanide carried out on live fish sold
in restaurants have shown levels
below the permissible amount set
by the World Health Organization
for drinking water. But whether
eating fish caught using cyanide is
100% safe still remains to be
proved. In 1987 the Hong Kong
government banned cyanide fishing
in its territorial waters, but the
problem has not gone away.
In Palawan the law in this field
is also difficult to enforce, despite
heavy sentences for offenders. In
March 1996, six dynamite fisher¬
men, locally known as bum-
bongeros, were arrested in Cuyo
with 80 kilograms of fish and sen¬
tenced to 20 years in prison. The
same month, 21 cyanide users
were given ten-year sentences.
The Tubbataha Beefs national
marine park has not been spared.
Located 180 kilometres southeast
of Palawan in the middle of the
Sulu sea, it stretches over 33,200
hectares. It was created in 1988
and proclaimed a World Heritage
Site in 1993. Every year, visiting
divers from all over the world
observe the damage caused by
destructive fishing practices around
the two atolls lying at the heart of
the marine park, which is excep¬
tional on account of its abundant
and highly diverse corals (300 types)
and 400 species of fish. A research
and marine ranger station has been
set up to chase poachers and
illegal fishermen. A patrol team of
eleven is stationed in Tubbataha
for two months at a time. Their
living conditions are tough and
funding is tight, despite backing
from several organizations,
including the Department of Envi¬
ronment and Natural Resources,
the Palawan Council for Sustain¬
able Development (PCSD) and Con¬
servation International.
Protective measures
Created in 1992, the PCSD estab¬
lished an Environmentally Critical
Areas Network in order to regu¬
late and control the use and man¬
agement of the province's natural
resources. A mine exploited near
Honda Bay, for example, caused
mercury poisoning in fish and
shellfish. Several inhabitants of
the small port of Santa Lourdes
were also affected. The mine was
closed and a long-term plan was
adopted to provide health care for
the villagers and to find alternative
means of subsistence to fishing.
In an effort to encourage preser¬
vation, the network is also seeking
to make forest dwellers the owners
of their environment. The PCSD is
studying the possibilities of deliver¬
ing ancestral ownership certificates
to three indigenous peoples, the
Batah, the Tagbanuas and the
Palawan. All live in upland areas
and practise slash and burn agricul¬
ture. They also hunt, extract resin
from almaciga (which yields a type
of copal), exploit rattan and harvest
wild honey. In 1995, a scheme to
protect Palawan's tropical forest
was finally drawn up. Among the
sites included in the plan arc the St.
Paul Subterranean River National
Park (known for its magnificent
underground river) and its adjacent
Mangroves on
Snake Island, in
Honda Bay.

communities, as well as those
around the Irawan watershed near
Puerto Princesa.
In these last two vicinities, the
Pista y Aug Kageban, or Festival
of the Forests, has been cele¬
brated for the last six years on 23
June. At this year's event, 30,000
people led by Edward Hagedorn,
Puerto Princesa's outspoken
mayor and environmental activist,
arrived at dawn to plant 100,000
tree seedlings of different vari¬
eties, thus bringing to 700,000
the total number of trees planted
in the capital and its surrounding
area. Founded in 1970, Puerto
Princesa well and truly lives up to
its claim of being a "clean and
green" city. As for the island of
Palawan, it has been a UNESCO
Biosphere Reserve since 1990, as
the maps handed out by the
tourist office point out. This dis¬
tinction is, however, news to most
of the island's inhabitants.
What is certain is that Palawan
has narrowly avoided an ecological
catastrophe. The last frontier
faces many threats but it is spared
from violence, mushrooming con¬
crete constructions and pollution.
It can only he hoped that the
developing tourist industry will not
harm the local culture, the luxuri¬
ant vegetation, the rivers and crys¬
tal-clear cascades, the endless
beaches and an underwater world
that is among the most beautiful
in the world. I
