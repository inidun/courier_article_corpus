HERITAGE
The monastery of
Haghpat
by Elisabeth Baudourian
A masterpiece of religious
architecture and a major
centre of [earning in the
Middle Ages, Armenia's
Haghpat Monastery was
placed on Unesco's World
Heritage List in 1996.
Tradition has it that two of
, Christ's apostles, St. Thad-
dcus and St. Bartholomew, intro¬
duced Christianity into Armenia
at a very early date. Later, at the
beginning of the fourth century,
Armenia became the first country
to adopt Christianity as an official
religion. Against a backdrop of the¬
ological disputes, but above all
motivated by political reasons, the
Armenian church soon began to
elect its own archbishop. Since it
rejected the dogma of the two
natures of Christ (human and
divine), the church came into con¬
flict with Byzantium. But this the¬
ological dispute masked a political
concern: Armenia wanted to set
itself apart from both Byzantium
and Persia, two rival empires which
often clashed on its territory. The
break with Byzantium was com¬
pleted in 609.
The determination to be inde¬
pendent also resulted in the cre¬
ation of an Armenian alphabet in
about 405. Written Armenian
replaced liturgical Greek and
became one of the church's main
instruments for unifying the Armen¬
ian people. Drawing strength from
their specific religious and linguis¬
tic identity, the Armenians man¬
aged to survive in a hostile environ¬
ment and thwart repeated attempts
by other nations to assimilate them.
Towards the middle of the sev¬
enth century, the Arabs conquered
Byzantine Armenia. People con¬
verted in increasing numbers to
Islam, especially among the nobil
ity. Only two princely families on
the outer reaches of Armenia
remained Christian: the Bagralids
in the north, and the Artsrunis in
the south. But in 862 the Caliph
appointed Ashot Bagratuni
"Prince of Princes", and made him
"King of Armenia" twenty years
later. Armenia regained its inde¬
pendence shortly thereafter.
TH E RENAISSANCE OF ARMENIAN ART
Ashot, who had become Ashot I
after being crowned by the
Catholicos (the spiritual head of
the church), ushered in a period
of peace and prosperity that was

to last 120 years. Armenian art
enjoyed a renaissance. In about
961, the Bagratid family founded
a new capital at Ani, now part of
Turkey. At that time a mere for¬
tified village, Ani was transformed
into a wondrous city "with forty
gates, 100 palaces and 1,000
churches", according to chroni¬
clers of the time.
Armenian architecture blos¬
somed with the construction of
the church of the 1 loly Cross, on
Aghtamar Island, and of Ani
cathedral. Philosophy, theology
and literature faculties were set
up within tin; precincts of monas¬
teries. The neighbouring monas¬
teries of Haghpat and Sanabin
were restored and enlarged and
became cultural and educational
centres by the end of the tenth
century. The period's leading
architect, Trdat, restored Ilagia
Sophia cathedral in Constantino¬
ple, built Ani cathedral and was
responsible for the expansion of
Haghpat monastery.
The Haghpat monastery com¬
plex overlooks the Pambak River
in northern Armenia's Lori region.
It was built, not on a peak, but
halfway up a hillside on a site cho¬
sen to afford protection and con¬
cealment from prying eyes and
also in response to a kind of monas¬
tic humility. It is built on a ver¬
dant promontory located in the
middle of a mountain cirque,
which is often wreathed in clouds.
A peak on the opposite side of the
river is over 2,500 metres high.

The monasteries of northern
Armenia are not isolated, unlike
their counterparts in the coun¬
try's arid regions. They were built
ina village environment. Haghpat,
for example, is surrounded by
many hamlets, and Sanahin's
domes rise from the centre of a
village.
THE ORIGINAL CHURCH
The little church of Surb Nshan
(the 1 loly Cross) is Ilaghpat's ear¬
liest building. Begun in 966-67,
it was later enlarged and embell¬
ished by the architect Trdat and
his team. Like many other
churches and monasteries, it was
endowed by prominent feudal
families. A typical example of
tenth-century Armenian archi¬
tecture, its central dome rests on
the four imposing pillars of the
lateral walls. The outside walls
are dotted with triangular
recesses. A fresco in the apse
depicts Christ Pantocralor. Its
donor, the Armenian Prince
Khutulukhaga, is depicted in the
south transept (a transversal nave
intersecting the main jiave). The
sons of the church's founder,
Princes Smbal and Kurike, are
shown with Queen Khosravanuche
in a bas-relief on the east gable.
Apart from one or two minor
restorations carried out in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries,
the church has retained its origi¬
nal character.

A local noble family, the
Kiurikians, made the church their
spiritual centre and the monastery
grew spectacularly. Two new build¬
ings were added to it St. Gre¬
gory's church (1005-25) and the
chapel of the Virgin Mary along
with several circular defence walls
with two fortified gates.
Armenia's golden age came to
an end in the mid-eleventh cen¬
tury. Ani was taken by the Byzan¬
tines. The last Bagratid king abdi¬
cated. At the end of the century,
Turkish-Mongol Seljuks com¬
pleted their conquest of Arme¬
nia. In about 1130, an earthquake
damaged Haghpat, which was not
restored until fifty years later. But
those eventful years did not in any
way impair the monastery's spiri¬
tual influence.

At that time, several hundred
monks lived in Haghpat monastery.
They could eat in a refectory, but
there was no dormitory because
they had formed the habit of lodg¬
ing in villages in the valley. They
produced the Haghpat Gospels
(1211), an illuminated manuscript
renowned for miniatures in which
secular features blend into reli¬
gious scenes. One illumination
¡ shows a man and a woman in
I Armenian dress welcoming Jesus
Ï before the gates of Jerusalem.
The fortress of Kaian was built
nearby in 1233 to protect Hagh¬
pat and Sanahin from invading
Mongols. Although the monastery
was captured and destroyed a few
years later, its life did not come to
a halt.
In the mid-thirteenth century,
three important buildings were
added to the site. One of them was
the campanile, or zangakatun,
which stands apart from the
church at the highest point of the
site. An elongated construction
topped by a short octagonal spire,
it has three floors, each contain¬
ing recesses and apses with one or
more altars. The library, or mate-
nadaran (1258-68), is a square,
compact building directly con¬
nected to the church by what is
known as the "Saviour's Passage".
The great jamatun or chapter¬
house which the monks used for
assemblies is also connected to the
church by a vaulted arcade. Built
in the same style as the gavit, it is
the work of the father superior,
Hamazasp. Outside the monastery
walls, the monks also built the
Holy Zion chapel (1268) in a vil¬
lage farther down the hill.
But the Mongol incursions
resumed. Tamerlane's invasions
(1387-1405) put an end to fur¬
ther attempts to reconstitute a
Greater Armenia. Between the
fourteenth and seventeenth cen¬
turies, Haghpat was frequently
damaged, and on two occasions,
in 1651 and 1677, the Armenian
apostolic church undertook
restoration work.
On the eve of the Second
World War, the Soviet Socialist
Republic of Armenia's Commit¬
tee for the Preservation ofMonu¬
ments made plans for a compre¬
hensive restoration of the site. At
the end of 1991, Armenia again
became independent. The town
council of Tumanian is now respon¬
sible for the upkeep of Haghpat,
which still belongs to the church
of Armenia, while the culture min¬
istry is responsible for its restora¬
tion. A long-term approach to the
preservation ofArmenia's historic
and spiritual heritage can finally
be adopted.
A WIDENING SPHERE
OFINFLUENCE
At the beginning of the thirteenth
century, the monastery acquired
a gavit, a large construction resem¬
bling a narthex (an entrance hall
between the porch and nave of a
church) which shows this feature
of ecclesiastical architecture in its
most fully developed form. The
gavit was used for meetings, teach¬
ing and funerals. In line with the
principles of vernacular wooden
architecture, its roof rests on four
central pillars. Above the arches
of the square central area, inter¬
secting arches divide the building
into nine parts. Light streams into
the building through a lantern
crowning the highest central sec¬
tion (the yerdik). The floor is partly
