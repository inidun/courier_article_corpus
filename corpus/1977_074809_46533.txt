BIRTHRIGHT
OF MAN
ORE forcefully, perhaps, than
ever before, the internatio¬
nal community is voicing its
determination that human rights, in
the very broadest sense of the term,
shall be respected everywhere. And
yet, on this fundamental issue, huma¬
nity is in something of a dilemma.
For it is manifestly absurd to ac¬
cord freedoms to those who are too
poor to enjoy them. On the other
hand, the cause of human dignity
has nothing to gain from improve¬
ments in the material well-being of
vast numbers of people, if they are
kept in the bondage of ignorance,
cut off from their fellows and excluded
from the mainstream of history.
Human rights are violated daily:
Deliberately: State authorities, claim¬
ing to be a law unto themselves,
justify such violations on the grounds
of "exceptional circumstances" (poli¬
tical or social crises) and the need to
preserve public order or safeguard
national unity.
Flagrantly: The flouting of human
rights in specific, localized situations
(apartheid, remnants or revivals of
colonialist or neo-colonialist oppres¬
sion, foreign occupation...) often
takes place under cover of a travesty
of the principles which are denied.
More subtly: Through the structures
and behaviour of unjust societies
which, while paying lip-service to
democracy, oppress and exploit cer¬
tain underprivileged groups or cate¬
gories of individuals.
Through torture, and through inter¬
ference with freedom of thought,
conscience or religion or with oppor-
14
tunities to seek, receive or circulate
information or ideas.
Violations of which the community
has recently become more aware,
such as the unwarranted seizure of
natural or cultural resources or the
despoiling of the environment.
Violations which arise from con¬
tempt for or rejection of cultural iden¬
tity, or from the tensions present in
multi-ethnic societies.
The achievement of universal hu¬
man rights also implies that everyone
should live in conditions free from
exposure to hunger, poverty, appre¬
hension for the future, or the extremes
of ignorance and social ostracism;
that no one shall be condemned to
distress and despair.
Respect for human dignity is a uni¬
versal principle which admits of no
exceptions.
No international organization is in a
better position than Unesco to appre¬
ciate the fundamental importance of
promoting human rights, to publicize
them and to transform them into
realities.
The scandal of inequality cannot be
justified by the claim that times are
hard. On the contrary,, the require¬
ments of public order and security
not to mention the lust for powerare
neither a vindication nor an excuse for
arbitrary imprisonment and the use of
torture. Concern for growthnot to
mention the lure of gaincannot
make the subjection and exploitation
of human labour acceptable; nor can
the desire to build up an intellectual
élite warrant keeping the mass of the
people in ignorance.
Unesco has set itself five main
tasks in the field of human rights:
1 The first involves increasing our
knowledge about human rights
and denouncing violations of them.
The aim is to protect man as he is,
through the rights inscribed in texts
which already exist. Without aban¬
doning the quest for solutions to the
eternal conflict between the individual
and the State, it is also necessary to
promote knowledge and recognition
of human rights as a field for co¬
operation between the individual and
the State, when confronted with
abuses of private power (in the case
of multinational corporations, for
example) within the framework of a
new economic order.
O The second task concerns res¬
pect for cultural identity. The
right to one's own culture is invoked
throughout the world in the strug¬
gle against racial, ethnic, linguistic
or cultural discrimination, as a
basic human right.
Without losing its political, liberat¬
ing function, the notion of cultural
identity is now beginning to have
economic and social implications,
in the current search for a new inter¬
national economic order. It is
becoming increasingly obvious that
the introduction of such an order
implies that each nation should have
an ever clearer sense of its identity
and vocation.
By asserting their own cultural
identity, all peoples, whether or not

One of the tasks that
Unesco has set itself as a
matter of priority, is the
safeguarding and protection
of human rights, which are
violated dailyeither
flagrantly (racialism,
neocolonialism, abuse of
State power, etc.) or more
insidiously (exploitation of
labour, scandalous
inequalities, linguistic or
cultural discrimination, etc.).

they are their own masters politically,
whether or not they are great powers,
whether they have a full range of
resources and skills at their disposal
or are still developing, can lay the
foundations for cultural pluralism.
Acceptance of and respect for such
pluralism, based on equal rights and
mutual esteem, has now emerged as
a factor for peace and understanding
between nations.
Cultural regions rarely coincide
with political boundaries. This being
so, comparisons, exchanges and
friendly relations should be possible
between countries which share a
common heritage, even if their
economic or social circumstances or
ideological standpoints are today at
variance.
Q The third task concerns a part of
humanity that has for too long
been subject to discrimination, or
even exploitation: women, who re¬
present almost half of the world popu¬
lation, almost 70 per cent of them
living in developing countries.
Despite all the progress and efforts
made, the three causes of women's
inferior position in the world, namely,
the burden of family responsibilities,
inequality in education and discrimi¬
nation in employment, have by no
means disappeared.
As far as Unesco is concerned, two
major principles of action may be laid
down. The first is that any genuine
change in the status of women in¬
volves bringing to light all the forms
of discrimination to which they are
subjected in education, science,
culture and communication.
The second principle is that women
must themselves take steps to im¬
prove their situation. This implies
that they should participate in work¬
ing out reforms designed to grant
them a fair deal.
Women's full contribution to the
progress of society also presupposes
their ability to gain a hearing in
decision-making bodies, from village
councils or co-operative associations
right up to the highest national level.
There is a wide gap between official
recognition of women's fundamental
political rights and active participation
by women in political life: when wo¬
men are represented, such represen¬
tation rarely reflects their numbers or
their abilities.
A The fourth task is to defend the
rights of refugees and members
of national liberation movements.
Ever since it was set up, Unesco
has helped refugees. In the years
following the end of the Second
World War, for instance, it supported
the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency (UNRWA), assuming techni¬
cal responsibility for the education of
the children of 1.5 million Palestine
refugees. 1971 saw the launching
of a special programme of aid to
African liberation movements recogni¬
zed by the Organization of African
Unity.
C The fifth and final task concerns
the mobilization of education and
the media in publicizing the vital need
for universal observance of human
rights. The contents and interrela¬
tions of those rights should be ex¬
plained and people should be encou¬
raged and enabled to seek a fuller
understanding of the preconditions for
human rights, and to strive for their
implementation.
The promotion of education and
information concerning human rights
poses a great many problems. The
development of teaching about hu¬
man rights encounters difficulties
identical with those met during any
process of educational change or
reform. Teachers must be prepared
for new tasks.
Education and information have a
crucial role to play as societies ad¬
vance towards their chosen goals.
The assurance of human rights will
depend to a considerable extent on
educating and informing people so
that they are aware of their rights
and know how to exercise them in an
effective and responsible manner.
