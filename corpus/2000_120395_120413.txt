those day s. Questions surrounding the pros-
pects of human embryo research (and the
risks of new forms of eugenics) as well as
research spurred by the mapping of the
human genome, are generating new law s
based on consultation with national and
i n t e rn ational ethics committees, along with
medical and research gr o u p s. This is the
most public part of the debate, the issues
that make headlines.
But medical ethics invo l ve far more than
these issues, which are all essential to ima-

A d vances in life sciences and biotech-

about ethics. E x p e rt committees are

assisted reproduction, p r e n atal screening
and the prospects for human cloning.
Standards for clinical reseach on
humans,spelt out in the 1947 Nuremburg

a d vances and research unimaginable in
doctors’ surgeries. For medical ethics are
also being challenged by patients them-
selves, and by practices that have become
routine.
A premium on efficiency
and performance
D o c t o rs are inevitably affected by
societal changes, shifting aspirations and
accepted behavioural norm s.They also

p at i e n t s , to reconcile ethical considera-

a liberal society that puts high value on effi-

SP ORT MEDICINE :
TO HEAL OR TO WIN ?

especially true in the case of dru g - t a k i n g
(or doping) in sport , which can be seen as
the logical outcome of a perform a n c e -
based type of medical practice. O d d l y
e n o u g h , discussion about doping is gene-
rally reduced to a few clichés: it is branded
as unethical in light of an imagi n a ry spor-
ting ideal. Calls are made for better dru g -
testing and stiffer punishment for “ c h e at s ”
and their accomplices. But this skates ove r
the real issue—the pressures of competi-
tion in sport—and hides it even furt h e r
from the public, d o c t o rs and authori t i e s.
Doping in high-pressure sports can
hardly be equated with reckless or rash
b e h av i o u r. On the contrary, it requires the
conscious invo l vement of the competitor
who personally controls the state of his
or her own body and training.The at h l e t e
is led to take drugs daily to reduce fat i g u e
and to increase muscle powe r , or to recove r
quickly from an injury or excessive trai-
n i n g, for example. The scandal over the
Tour de France bicycle race in 1998
s h owed how ri d e rs knowingly and pers o-
nally take banned substances in order to
endure tough training and back-to-back
races throughout a whole season.
So the real ethical debate rests solely on
medical practice. It means we should refle c t
on how doctors respond to requests from
athletes at all leve l s , for doping is also on
the rise among amat e u rs and children.

France bicycle race in 19 9 8

recounted how a mother asked for gr ow t h
h o rmones for her son to improve his spor-
ting perform a n c e . There are two fa c t o rs
behind this request. F i rs t , a d vances in
medical biotechnology have made it pos-
sible to produce artificial horm o n e s.
S e c o n d , the dri ve to win draws the doctor
into altering the body to make it perform

All medical codes of ethics condemn
d o c t o rs acceding to such requests. T h e

doctor to “oppose and
refuse to administer or

aim at “an unnat u r a l

c o m p e t i t i o n ” or which
“ a rtificially change fea-

Hormone boosts
But many doctors
must still deal with the
consequences of sport i n g
a c t i v i t y. P hy s i o l o gi c a l l y,
s p o rt depletes a pers o n ’s
n atural reserve s ,e s p e c i a l l y
h o rm o n e s. I n t e n s i ve train-
ing for example, uses up
the male hormone testos-
terone faster than the
body replaces it. A doctor
can put an athlete on sup-
plements to make up for
t h at loss, just as iron or
vitamins are prescri b e d
for people lacking them.
So a deficiency in the
body is made up for
without any regard for
w h at might have caused
it in the first place—such
as malnutri t i o n , ove r wo r k
or disease.
We do not yet have a
s e p a r ate branch of medi-
cine dealing with perfor-
m a n c e . So fa r , it is just a
few doctors straying from
the ori ginal purposes of
m e d i c i n e . In the ri c h e s t
c o u n t ries and among the
elites in poor nat i o n s ,
such medicine is in
demand as a medical prop to cope with
the new emphasis placed on perform a n c e
in all spheres of life. This is also ve ry
similar in principle to anti-ageing treat-
m e n t s , where health care is being adjusted
to the fact that people are living longer.
H o rmone replacement therapy in elderly
people is aimed at “ i m p r oving the quality
of life to match the extra number of ye a rs
g a i n e d ,” according to Dr. B runo Deli-
g n i è r e s , head of the endocrinology serv i c e
at the Necker Hospital in Pa ri s. Here too,
h o rmonal adjustment is being prescri b e d
because of progress in life sciences and
p at i e n t s ’ requests for drugs to alleviate the
effects of ageing.The doctor is responding
to a pers o n ’s natural desire to improve
their physical condition. Just like cos-
metic surgery and treatments for impo-
t e n c e , which have been boosted by the
i nvention of the drug V i a gr a , medicine is
t u rning towards satisfying desires, s p u rr e d
by images of well-being and yo u t h .T h e
pressure to get, maintain or preserve an
“ e f fic i e n t ” body and a “ s l i m ” figure is
steadily increasing. The same goes for
reducing pain during childbirt h , old age
and of course in eve ry d ay life, w h i c h

includes sporting activity.
So one might think there is nothing
wrong with prescribing drugs which
i m p r ove the quality of an at h l e t e ’s life,
marked by intense physical activity. F i g h-
ting against stress, r e c ove ring from long-
t e rm fat i g u e , using anti-inflammat o ry

e x p e c t ations of chemically-assisted we l l -
b e i n g .
But testosterone and related products,
such as nandrolone, are classified as ana-
bolic steroids and are the substances most
frequently detected during drug testing.
When taken in big doses, together with
s u f ficient food and training, t e s t o s t e r o n e
increases body mass, strength and muscle
p ower as well as aggressivity and resis-
tance to fatigue and pain. C o rticoid dru g s
also reduce pain and help a person to tire
less easily. So these substances are ve ry
suitable for easing the physical effects and
p s y c h o l o gical pressures of competitive
s p o rt .
The crucial issue lies in deciding where
medical efforts to restore equilibrium end
and efforts to improve performance begi n .
An art i ficial dividing line has been draw n .
A scale has been devised to measure the
quantity of “ s u p p l e m e n t s.” Medical tests
can now detect if a person has taken
“ u n r e a s o n a b l e ” amounts of substances
t h at are no longer banned, but tolerated up
to a certain point.
The good health riddle
Medical ethics do not require a doctor
to ask whether someone is “ c h e at i n g ”
under the rules of sport . A doctor does not
h ave to take a stand on demands made in
fields other than his ow n .The problem is
h ow to define the state of health that the
doctor aims for, not the level of doping.
The World Medical A s s o c i at i o n ’s Geneva
D e c l a r ation (adopted in 1948 and
amended in 1983) is clear: “The health of
my patient will be my first considera-
t i o n ,” a doctor is supposed to pledge. S o
it naturally condemns “procedures to
mask pain or other protective symptoms
if used to enable the athlete to take part
in an event when lesions or signs are pre-
sent which make his part i c i p ation inad-
v i s a b l e .”
D o c t o rs (in sport or otherwise) who
engage in these practices are not perfor-
ming their duty towards patients (which
i nvo l ves prescribing a halt to painful acti-
vity) but are complying with the demands
of sport . From an ethical standpoint, a
desired performance must not be taken
into account in the course of diagnosis or
t r e at m e n t . Medical ethics condemn any
action dictated by interests or pressures not
r e l ated to the goal of good health.
This is where the debate gets really
t ri c k y, because in modern parlance and
in the language of doping in sport , g o o d
health is understood to mean the absence
of illness or lasting after-effects. H owe ve r ,
since 1940, the World Health Organizat i o n
has defined good health as a combined
s t ate of phy s i c a l , emotional and social
we l l - b e i n g . The Centre for Health Pro-
motion at the Unive rsity of To r o n t o, p o i n t s
out that good health is not an end in itself
but a means to a balanced life.
This makes good health a quest for
well-being based on individual aspirat i o n s
in a particular social and cultural context.
Put this way, it becomes something extre-
mely subjective and changeable according
to the time and place as well as the sex, a g e
and social class of the person invo l ve d .
Each individual decides on the basis of
his or her own life and cultural env i r o n-
ment a relationship to we l l - b e i n g, p a i n
and illness.
S p o rt presents doctors with a paradox .
Most of them believe physical activity
makes for a balanced life. But they are
also well aware that competition upsets
this balance, and that chemical-based treat-
ments can be prescribed to supplement
d e f i c i e n c i e s. If they respond to such
d e m a n d s , they are only reinforcing the
a l i e n ating emphasis put on performance at
all costs, of which sport is just the most
s t riking example.
Science
at the altar
of performance?
But doctors can still, without any
qualms of conscience, refuse to play the
game and deplore the effects of a hectic
life-style imposed by the obligation to
p e r f o rm . Acting in the interest of pat i e n t s ’
we l fare invo l ves teaching them how to
p u rsue a balanced life. A doctor’s duty is
to tell patients why they are ill. If this
can be done without problem where obe-
sity and the dangers of smoking or dri n-
king are concern e d , the same goes where
the dangerous effects of sport are
i nvo l ve d .
S p o rt medicine is a forerunner of the
medicine of the future—a medicine at
the behest of institutions in the bu s i n e s s
of boosting effic i e n cy. It runs the risk of
u s h e ring in a common norm dictat i n g
p e o p l e ’s appearance (through cosmetic
s u r g e ry ) , character (through prenatal dia-
gnosis) and social behav i o u r , n a m e l y
through the demand for performance in
all fie l d s , be it professional, sexual or spor-
t i n g . ■
