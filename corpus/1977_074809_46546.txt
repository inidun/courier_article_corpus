COMMUNICATION-MORE THAN
A ONE-WAY STREET
AT the end of the Second World
War it was generally and
sincerely believed that the
universal dissemination of informa¬
tion would be sufficient to ensure
understanding and respect among
peoples and to allay conflicts.
But euphoric optimism about the
"free flow of information" overlooks
certain essential facts, not the least
of which is the uneven international
availability of facilities for press com¬
munication. (Editors' note: A forth¬
coming issue of the "Unesco Courier"
will be devoted to the problems of
communication in the modern world.)
The concept of the free flow of
information has in fact worked to the
disadvantage of countries only
recently freed from various forms of
subjection.
For them, in the last analysis, it has
meant primarily opening the gates to
a flood of information from outside
while they themselves' have been
unable to make their voices heard.
The flow is predominantly from a
small number of technologically
developed and highly industrialized
countries to the rest of the world.
The significant expansion of mass
communication media over the past
10 years has chiefly taken place in
the industrialized world, and over the
decade the gap between developing
and developed countries has actually
widened.
Thus, even though television ser¬
vices now exist in many more coun¬
tries than 10 years ago, in most the
number of television sets
remains small. In some 30 countries
of Asia and Africa there are no tele¬
vision services at all.
In Africa, 9 countries and territories
have no daily newspapers; only 15 of
the remainder have a daily circulation
of more than 10 copies per 1,000 in¬
habitants.
In Asia, daily newspaper circulation
is less than 1 00 per 1 ,000 inhabitants
in 12 countries, and in only 6 does it
exceed 1 00.
In only 7 of the Spanish-speaking
countries of North and South America
does daily newspaper circulation rise
to more than 1 00 copies per 1 ,000 in¬
habitants.
Fifteen countries of Africa, 1 1 Spa¬
nish-speaking countries of North and
South America and 6 Asian countries
have no national news agencies.
It is also clear that the developing
30
countries are increasingly dependent
on the industrialized countries for
access to the books which they most
need for progress in education,
science and culture. This means
that they have to import or translate,
at considerable cost, works published
in the industrialized countriesand
such works, moreover, are not always
suited to their needs.
It is symptomatic that, according to
the latest statistics, approximately
three-quarters of the works translated
throughout the world were originally
written in English, French, Russian or
German (in that order) and that, with
the exception of the Spanish-speaking
countries of Latin America, only 3 per
cent were written in the languages of
the developing countries.
Unesco has identified four major
objectives in the field of communica¬
tion:
I Promotion of a more balanced
flow of information and ideas at
international level, respecting the
various cultures and individual priori¬
ties of each country.
O Promotion of the widest possible
circulation of information, know¬
ledge and ideas, without, however,
neglecting protection for the rights of
creators. Unesco's role here is to
organize the protection of copyright.
It should take into account the educa¬
tional and cultural needs of the inter¬
national community, particularly its
least favoured members, in an effort
to find solutions reconciling authors'
rights and users' interests.
Q In the field of communication
research, Unesco's first task is to
encourage new ways of thinking
about the process of communication
and its role in modern society. Giv¬
en the lack of trained research
workers in some regions, an impor¬
tant area of Unesco's action will
consist of assistance to Member
States in overcoming these obstacles.
A In communication development
the first problem is to prevent any
further widening of the gap between
the developed and developing coun¬
tries. Appropriate conditions and
institutions must be created to allow
for media expansion in the develop¬
ing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin
America, and facilities established for
staff training.
Unesco has a key role to play in
promoting the concept of communi¬
cation policies and helping countries
formulate such policies and put them
into effect.
