CHANGING PATTERNS
IN INDIA
By K. G. Saiyidain
Joint Educational Adviser and Joint Secretary, Ministry of Education, India
My own memory of schooldays in India during
the second decade of the
century, identifies art with the
laboured drawing of vertical
and horizontal lines with a hard
pencil, a boring and meaningless
exercise which was supposed to
develop gradually into geome-
trical drawing : a useful thing,
I presume, for professional
surveyors and draughtsmen, but
about a. s closely related to the
release of creative impulses in
children as, say, the pumping of
water to the joyous experience
of graceful swimming. This
tended to deaden the interest of
children in art and curbed their
natural love of self-expression.
The education administrators
themselves were more preoc-
cupied with the achievements of
tangible results and the teaching
of. subjects which could be
easily measured by the mecha-
nical yardstick of the exami-
nations. Being themselves the
products of an educational sys-
tem which was soulless and
artistically barren, they were
not able to appreciate the true
value of art education or know
how to encourage it in schools.
Deadly drudgery
auks, in consequence of theinexorable chain of admi-
nistrators without vision,
teachers lacking in skill, area-"
tive ideas or training, and chil-
dren obsessed with examina-
tions, art continued to be the
neglected part of the curri-
culum.
There were, however, certain
forces working in India, in the
social, political and cultural
fields, which aimed at bringing
about a national renaissance.
An attempt was made to link
education more closely to life
outside the schools and to re-
integrate the relationship bet-
ween formal education and
folklife-folk art, music,
drama, and literature. This
new movement has so far
reached only a minority of the
schools, for in most of them the
old deadly dull drudgery of
drawing persists. But there is
no doubt that in many pro-
gressive schools, and in quite a
number of art schools, the new
outlook and approach are being
increasingly adopted.
In the revision of ideas about
the teaching of art in schools,
and the greater emphasis that
is being placed on the intuitive
and rhythmic aspects, it is not
only indigenous influences, but
the practical work of inspired
art teachers like Franz Cizek,
the great Austrian pioneer, and
the ideas of art critics like
Herbert Read, w h i c h have
played a part. Exhibitions of
free art work done by children
in other countries, notably Aus-
tria and England, have quicken-
ed teachers'ideas and imagi-
nation about what can be done
in this field.
Obstacles to art
THESE examples from otherplaces show a similar feel-
ing for rhythm and sen-
suous beauty, as well as the
approach through intuition, to
that found in Indian and
Oriental art.
The main obstacles which
have stood in the way of the
development of creative lines of
art education in India may be
summed up as follows : failure
to recognize the true place of
art in education ; undue impor-
tance given to examinations ;
lack of properly trained teachers
with the right ideology ; inade-
quacy of funds, and shortage of
necessary equipment.
Concerning the first point,
there has been a marked
change for the better. There
is growing realization that art is
not only an essential and inte-
gral part of general education,
but that no other subject can
possibly fill the role which it
plays in the development of the
child's personality and in the
proper orientation of his
emotional life.
The second difficulty, con-
cerning examinations, is a
tougher proposition because,
despite all the criticism that
enlightened educational opinion
has levelled against them, it
, has not been found possible yet
to replace them by something
better. In regard to art, the
incidence of this difficulty is
greater because it is a subject
which by its nature does not
lend itself easily to the rigours
of a mechanical examination.
The dilemma is that if it is
made an examination subject,
the whole spirit in which art
teaching Should be carried own is
defeated ; if not, teachers and
students both tend to neglect it
and relegate it to the back-
ground. The way out can only
be found when there is a radical
change in the examination sit-
nation as a whole, of which, in
recent years, there is some
welcome evidence.
Then there is the problem of
teachers, which includes not
only their right training but
also the difficulty of actually
providing schools with trained
teachers. For financial reasons,
it is not possible to provide
every primary school with an
art teacher, nor sometimes even
every secondary school and,
therefore, the plan now being
worked out is to make art edu-
cation an integral part of the
syllabus in all teacher training
institutions, so that the general
teacher can also serve as an art
teacher.
No need for luxury
THE fourth problems is also at difficult one. In schools
'*'which cannot provide
paints, brushes, paper, crayon,
coloured paper and other mate-
rials, even the best of teachers
feel seriously handicapped in
evoking and satisfying the art
impulses of the children. Added
to this is the depressing fact
that many schools and homes
are in themselves inartistic.
However, so far as materials
are concerned, in preference to
imparting costly items from
abroad, attempts are being
made to use inexpensive mate-
rials locally available.
Where the exploitation of a
variety of local material-s helps
to develop the initiative and
creative resourcefulness of the
teachers and the children, it
can be of great value both
educationally and artistically.
Nevertheless, we must reco-
gnize that if we believe in the
value of educating our children
we must also believe them
worthy of the best resources
which we can provide ; and that
there is a certain minimum of
good quality materials which
must be supplied if any kind of
reasonably good results are to
be expected by the administra-
tive authorities. In art edu-
cation, there is no need to be
luxurious ; but we must at least
strive to be adequate.
Thus attempts are being
made, with some measure of
success, to deal with the many
problems involved in the orga-
nization of art education in In-
dia. We are not by any means
satisfied with what has been
achieved but the situation today
is decidedly more promising
than it has been for decades,
and there is hope that it will
continue to improve.
