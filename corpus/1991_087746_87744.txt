IMAGINARY CITIES

Iany famous writers have por¬
trayed city life. They have taken over
real cities and transformed them into
literary objects and they have creat¬
ed imaginary cities with lives of their
own. They have reconstructed urban
settings from scattered fragments of
memory, and have brought fame to
cities that were previously unknown.
A stroll through the urban land¬
scapes of literature reveals a vari¬
ety of creations: cities depicted with
a high degree of realism, cities in the
abstract, cities which merely provide
background atmosphere, and cities
which are themselves protagonists in
works of fiction.
The realistic city
Joyce's Dublin, Proust's Paris, Kaf¬
ka's Prague, and the Buenos Aires of
Borges are realistically depicted ci¬
ties which help to shape the course
of the fictional events which take
place in them.
Although Kafka rarely refers to
Prague In his novels and short sto¬
ries, his native city has a very spe¬
cial place in them. Prague is never
actually named in The Trial, for ex¬
ample, but the meandering corridors
and passages, the disconnected set¬
tings through which Joseph K.
wanders in an attempt to find out
why he is being tried, evoke the at¬
mosphere of Gothic Prague and the
labyrinth of narrow streets in its Jew¬
ish district.
The city is seen as if in a dream or
through the mists of memory, in
black and white, with the contrasts
of light and shadow that appear in Ex¬
pressionist films. The impression of
being in a dream is reinforced by
topological distortions (as when
something distant suddenly seems
very near, and vice versa) and by
changes of scale which make space
seem to expand or contract, depend¬
ing on K.'s state of mind. The vision
of reality is phantasmagoric.
The building in which K.'s trial is
to be held "was of unusual extent,
the main entrance was particularly
high", but when K. enters it he gets
lost in a maze of corridors, landings,
stairways and empty roomsit is
more like a tenement than a law
court. On another occasion, K. opens
the door of a lumber-room in the
bank where he works and "finds him¬
self suddenly in the court precincts".
In his story Amerika, Kafka depicts
New York, where he never set foot,
as an abstract, futuristic version of
Prague. The outstanding features are
the towering skyscrapers and geo¬
metric layout that differentiate it
most strongly from his native city,
with its labyrinth of winding streets

and alleyways. When Karl, the hero
of the story, leans over the balcony
of his uncle's New York house (a bal¬
cony is not exactly typical of New
York buildings), he is fascinated by
the sight of the street which "ran per¬
fectly straight between two rows of
squarely chopped buildings and
therefore seemed to be fleeing into
the distance". Here too, the city is
perceived in monochrome. Despite
the crowds and the skyscrapers, Kaf¬
ka's imaginary New York does not ex¬
ist except in terms of Prague, which
he uses as a kind of blueprint.
The camouflaged
city
Many cities in literature are inspired
by real cities whose names are
changed, perhaps because the
author wishes to eliminate local
colour, to conceal the true identity
of the characters, or simply wants a
better-sounding name than the origi¬
nal. But even under its new name,
the real city can still be seen beneath
the camouflage. Vetusta, the setting
of The Regent's Wife by the Spanish
novelist Clarín (Leopoldo Alas) is a
faithful reflection of the Spanish city
of Oviedo. What is most memorable
in Clarin's description is the sense of
space which can be felt from the very
first chapter in which a priest climbs
to the top of the cathedral bell-tower
to spy through a telescope on the
comings and goings of parishioners
who reveal their sins to him in the
confessional.
The little town of llliers near
Chartres (south of Paris) was immor¬
talized as Combray in Proust's A la
recherche du temps perdu and is
now officially known as llliers-
Combray. The fictional town is so
skilfully superimposed on the real
town that a visitor to llliers who has

read Swann's Way, the first part of
Proust's great novel, has no difficulty
in recognizing the setting of the prin¬
cipal scenes Aunt Leonie's house,
the church of Saint-Hilaire, the main
square, the château of Tansonville,
the Pré Catelan. Stone by stone,
street by street, llliers coincides ex¬
actly with Combray.
The imaginary city
A city cannot be created out of noth¬
ing. The ostensibly imaginary cities
of literature are actually an amalgam
of fragments of cities which the
writer has known. As a rule it is im¬
possible to identify these hetero¬
geneous monsters.
The mythical city of Santa Maria is
a thread that runs through the work
of the Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos
Onettl and gives it unity and univer¬
sality. The city is never far from the
thoughts of his characters. As a
result of Onetti's desire to eliminate
anecdotal details and references to
existing places, Santa Maria could be
any provincial city on the banks of a
river, with low-roofed houses, a
resplendent new hotel and a plaza
bordered with arcades. Argentine
and Uruguayan readers may be
tempted to identify the river as the

Río de la Plata and Santa Maria as the
city of Colonia, if they try to relate
Onetti's laconic, even contradictory,
indications to their own memories
and experiences.
In Onetti's novel A Brief Life, lor ex¬
ample, there is a reference to "a
broad river, a narrow river, a solitary
and threatening river, in which clouds
heavy with torment were reflected".
These contradictions introduce an
element of ambiguity which allows
the river of Santa Maria to be identi¬
fied with all rivers. The descriptions
of the city are always very general
and appeal to other senses than that
of sight, as if to blur the contours of
objects: "It came to me like a per¬
fume, an aroma that I had long ago
inhaled in a confused impression of
streets, compost, ivy, an image of a
tennis court and of a lantern sway¬
ing at the corner of a street."
As "a city hemmed in by a river and
a colony of Swiss settlers", Santa
Maria seems to have precise bound¬
aries, unlike Gabriel García Márquez's
fictional Colombian township of
Macondo, which is presented at
different times as a large hacienda,
a village or an entire kingdom, with
no temporal continuity. Since there
is no single narrator, Macondo ap¬
pears as each person sees it or wish¬
es to see it.
In García Márquez's novel One
Hundred Years of Solitude, the logic
of space and time is often violated
as near merges with far, the order of
events is mixed up, and the passage
of time is slowed down or speeded
up. And In the story entitled Big Ma¬
ma's Funeral, where the Supreme

REFLECTIONS
Pontiff, on his way to the funeral in
Macondo, glides in his long black
gondola past the famous sights of
Rome (mixed up with those of
Venice), García Márquez abruptly
writes: "At dusk the resonant peal¬
ing of St. Peter's Basilica mingled
with the cracked tinklings of Macon¬
do." But the Pope does not arrive in
Macondo in his gondola, but In a ca¬
noe loaded with yuccas, bananas and
chickens.
The township of Cómala in the
works of the Mexican writer Juan Rtil-
fo, and the City of the Immortals in
the works of Jorge Luis Borges, are
two sides of the same coin, nightmar¬
ish places inhabited by the dead or
by those unable to die.
Cómala is a place of memory and
dreams, haunted by all those who
have lived there and by the dreams
they have dreamed. To read Rulfo's
Pedro Páramo is to be assailed by im¬
ages of the ghost towns of the Ameri¬
can West. Abandoned like the mines
which made them rich, they have the
surrealist appeal of Giorgio de Chiri-
co's paintings of plazas where there
is no human presence, only marble
statues or tailor's dummies. The
equally uninhabited City of the Im¬
mortals described by Borges in his
story The Immortal is situated on the
banks of a river which grants immor¬
tality to those who bathe in it.
The narrator, a Roman tribune ar¬
riving at the end of a long and ardu¬
ous journey, like that of the mythical
heroes Gilgamesh and Achilles,
describes his first contact with the
city in the following terms: "I began
to glimpse capitals and astragals, tri¬
angular pediments and vaults, con¬
fused pageants of granite and
marble." This architecture, arranged
in a disorderly and chaotic manner

tutes the city: "In the palace I imper¬
fectly explored, the architecture
lacked any finality."
This boundless, chaotic, disorder¬
ly, unpopulated city appears to be the
work of immortal builders or dement¬
ed gods. With its magnificent ar¬
chitecture completely divorced from
anything on a human scale, it evokes
the precincts of a Roman forum, the
classical fantasies of a Piranesi en¬
graving, or cities like Petra which
have been abandoned for unknown
reasons.
Borges has said that his vision of
the City of the Immortals was in¬
spired by the tombs in La Recoleta
cemetery in Buenos Aires, small tem
ples that bear no resemblance, if only
because of their scale, to the place
which the reader sees through the
eyes of the Roman tribune: "This City
(I thought) is so horrible that its mere
existence and perdurance, though in
the midst of a secret desert, con¬
taminates the past and the future
and in some way even jeopardizes
the stars."
A dusty and sordid city-cemetery,
an infinite marmoreal city-
cemeterytwo mythical and equal¬
ly monstrous places.
The invisible city
In Invisible Cities, the Italian writer
Italo Calvino adopts a different ap
proach to the city, which becomes
the protagonist of his story. The book
is meant to be an account of the trav¬
els of the Venetian explorer Marco
Polo to the cities of Kublai Khan's
empire. The exoticism of the narra¬
tive can be felt in the very names of
the cities Maurilia, Despina, Zirma,
Tamara descriptions of which, al¬
ternating with meetings between
Marco Polo and the Great Khan and
the asides of Calvino himself, dis¬
orientate the reader who has the im¬
pression that this is a travel book
rather than a work of fiction. In this
way the reader is gradually made to
understand that these apparently re¬
mote and fabulous cities are actual¬
ly the cities of our everyday lives.
After Marco Polo has described at
length the many cities of the Empire,
the Khan asks him to speak of one
city which he has not yet
mentionedVenice. And Marco Polo
replies: "Every time I describe a city
I say something about Venice. To dis¬
tinguish the qualities of other cities,
I must start from a city that never
changes. For me that city is Venice."
In, point of fact, Marco Polo's
Venice is San Remo, which Calvino
admits is the basis of all the cities
described in his books: "I cannot
overlook the native and familiar land¬
scape. San Remo is the backcloth in
all my books. ..especially in many of
my invisible cities."
For each of these writers it is, af¬
ter all, their native city, the city they
know, which provides the foundation
for the cities of their imagination
a Platonic archetype fleshed out with
endless variations to shape cities
which are always new but always
similar.
