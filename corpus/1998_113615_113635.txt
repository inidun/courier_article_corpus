We have been spinning fa n t a s i e s
about the third millennium for a
long time.But the closer we get to
the year 2000, the more harmless it seems,
the more art i ficial the break with the past.
The future is already here, for the media
h ave been swamping us with pictures and
s t o ries about what may lie in store.The Italian
c o m m u n i c ations group Mediaset
commissioned the Explorer-Ipsos research
and marketing institute to conduct a study of
h ow they view the ye a rs to come. E n t i t l e d
“The Media and the Millennium”, it wa s
c a rried out in seven countries regarded as the
leading trend-setters — G e rm a ny, S p a i n , t h e
United Stat e s , F r a n c e , Ja p a n , Italy and the
United Kingdom—where the media are
p owerful enough to influence a global public.
“ We tried to understand how the next
millennium was being depicted in the press,o n
t e l e v i s i o n , on the Internet and in fa s h i o n ,
d e s i g n , a d ve rtising and art ,” s ays Giulia
C e ri a n i ,who is in charge of semiotic studies at
Explorer and presented the surve y ’s main
findings at Candido Mendes Unive rsity in Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil) last May.
If the media are to be believe d , life in the
t we n t y - first century will be no bed of roses.
They are predicting “ c h a o s ” , s ays Ceri a n i ,
citing as evidence cartoons and television seri e s
s h owing the end of the real world and inva s i o n
by alien ru l e rs , the increasing number of
I n t e rnet chat forums on the end of history and
a rt and fashion trends reflecting ideas of change
and hy b ri d i z at i o n . T h at bleak picture is
s y m p t o m atic of a total loss of bearings in “ a
world of contradictions and ‘ c o n t a m i n at i o n ’ ”
c h a r a c t e rized by the disappearance of
b o u n d a ries between objects, identities and
values that have long been clearly distinct,s u c h
as masculine and feminine, the self and the
o t h e r , the natural and the art i fic i a l .
Fear of the future is fueled in large part
by lightning-fa s t ,uncontrolled deve l o p m e n t s
in science and technology such as genetic
The media’s simplistic
vision of the next
century alternates
between gloom and
euphoria
m a n i p u l ations that make it possible to “ f r e e ”
an individual’s identity from his or her genome,
the high-speed circulation of inform at i o n
which shakes cultural cert a i n t i e s , and art i fic i a l
intelligence which seems to abolish the
b o u n d a ry between humans and machines.
“The print and broadcast media echo ri s i n g
anxiety about the impact of scientific adva n c e s ,
which have much less support and raise many
more questions than they did fifteen or twe n t y
ye a rs ago,” s ays Suzanne de Cheve i g n é , a
media expert at France’s National Centre for
S c i e n t i fic Research (CNRS).
When they are not preaching doom and

g l o o m ,the media, especially television,offer an
almost idyllic vision of the future as an era of
tremendous advances for humankind,
including gene therapy, the emergence of a
global citizenry through Internet and the
d e velopment of clean energy sources. T h e
m e d i a ’s discourse “ o s c i l l ates between a
‘ e u p h o ri c ’ and a ‘ d y s p h o ri c ’v i e w,” s ays Bri a n
Trench of the Unive rsity of Dublin, a d d i n g
t h at articles and television programmes on
science are often “ s u p e r f i c i a l ” . P i e rr e
C h e va l i e r , of the French-German public
television network La Sept/Art e ,a c k n ow l e d g e s
t h at journalists have a poor command of the
“ ve ry specific language” required by science
r e p o rt i n g, which is difficult to illustrate with
p i c t u r e s.M o r e ove r ,most television exe c u t i ve s
are more interested in high audience shares
than programme quality. And to capture the
attention of a large number of viewe rs ,s h o c k
is often more effective than rational inquiry.
“By and large, the bigger and less educat e d
the audience, the gloomier the message,” s ay s
de Cheve i g n é .
Media coverage of science also va ri e s
depending on the cultural context.A m e ri c a n s
h ave a mostly upbeat ,“ p r a g m at i c ” vision of
t e c h n o l o gical advances and cloning,w h e r e a s
ethical concerns come to the fore in Europe’s
L atin countri e s. A m e rican media “ p r e s e n t
only ‘ fa c t s ’ and less speculation about what
the implications of the facts might be,” s ay s
B ruce V. L e wenstein of Cornell Unive rs i t y.
Trench stresses another facet of the problem.
He says the media’s rosy outlook on new
i n f o rm ation technology, for example, r e fle c t s
a desire to treat computer companies, w h i c h
are major adve rt i s e rs , with kid glove s. “ T h e
media increasingly belong to corp o r at e
i n t e r e s t s ,” s ays New York broadcast specialist
Charles B. Po t t e r , adding that the image they
p r ovide of the future has no inherent va l u e
but is merely one more “ p r o d u c t ” on the
m a r k e t .
S t i l l , polls conducted by Explorer-Ipsos
r e veal that the public has had its fill of simplistic
d i s c o u rs e .They would like to see more subtle,
hopeful messages about the possibility of taking
back control of their destiny.“ People are awa r e
they are living through a period of transition
and want order,” s ays Ceri a n i . “They wa n t
more rat i o n a l , less sensat i o n a l i s t
c o m m u n i c at i o n .They are fed up with the
b i z a rre and the alien. Hence the return in
design to simpler,r e a s s u ring shapes associat e d
with technology that ’s under control.” T h e
media would do well to fall into step with the
trend towards reassurance and a shift in focus
back to eve ry d ay life. By continuing to stress
the inability to find a way out of the cri s i s ,t h e y
probably help to increase the public’s anxiety
and the appeal of New Age move m e n t s ,f o rm s
of immanent spirituality considered capable of
exorcising the demons of uncert a i n t y. n
