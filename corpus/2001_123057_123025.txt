Tales of
white elephants
Foreign companies keep the lion’s share of ecotourism profits but the Makuleke of South Africa are
trailblazing a juicy commercial venture based on their firm control of ancestral land and resources
game lodges in national parks and game
reserves across southern A f r i c a , which is
fast becoming a prime tourist desti-
nation.
Bottom of the ladder jobs
Until recently, the upscale lodges
dotting the wilderness were excluded
from the state-owned national parks,
where hunting is also prohibited. This is
beginning to change as ongoing land
reforms, which began in the mid-1990s,
give indigenous people often chased from
their lands during apartheid,the right to
use them for sustainable commercial
a c t i v i t i e s, particularly in the field of
ecotourism.
On the books, ecotourism rings like a
sensible way out of poverty and
u n d e r d e v e l o p m e n t . The U. S. b a s e d
International Ecotourism Society defin e s
it as “responsible travel to natural areas
that conserves the environment and
sustains the well-being of local people.”
Yet few studies have actually
examined its impact on local people’s
l i v e l i h o o d s, making the Ford study
something of a landmark. Its conclusion:
local residents in southern A f r i c a
generally get a raw deal, amounting to
little more than a few poorly paid and
unskilled jobs. Most of the money spent
goes to foreign-owned airlines, h o t e l s,
travel agencies and transportation
companies, along with consumer goods
produced abroad to satisfy tourists’ tastes.
I n d e e d , the World Bank estimates that 55
percent of tourist spending in developing
countries eventually leaks back to the
North,while some organizations put the
rate at 90 percent,especially in southern
Africa.
There are, h o w e v e r, a few
countervailing examples in the region.
In the far north of South Africa’s famed
Kruger National Park,about 900 families
belonging to the Makuleke tribe have

go Delta, led by local guides.
Winning back land rights is one side of the
battle waged by indigenous people,
finding ways to live off the earth is
another. Is ecotourism the answer?
Not always says a study conducted
for the Ford Foundation by Mafisa
Research and Planning, a South African
a g e n cy specialized in ecotourism. I t
examined the economics of about 30
won back the rights to own and use about
25,000 hectares of one of the park’s most
spectacular landscapes which,according
to some experts, contains up to two-thirds
of its biodiversity. They are now dealing
with a commercial operator, M a t s w a n i
S a f a r i s, to develop a luxury 24-bed lodge,
along with a tent-camp and even a
m u s e u m . Instead of resettling on the land,
they have decided to use it as an
economic base for their villages on the
park’s frontier.
In addition to lodging, the Makuleke
have also decided to offer some trophy
h u n t i n g, arranged by a private safari
company. Last year, two elephants and
two buffaloes were hunted, which brought
about $57,000 for local development
projects (and meat which was distributed
among Makuleke villages). The yields
are supposed to increase this year
(including animals like nyala and zebra),
which adds fuel to a simmering
controversy about trophy hunting in
g e n e r a l .H o w e v e r, the Makuleke leaders
vow to phase out the hunt once the other
tourism projects turn a decent profit.
Negotiating power
When running at 60 percent capacity,
the lodge will pay rent of $75,000 a year
to the Makuleke people, in addition to
about $150,000 in yearly wages to local
e m p l o y e e s. In total, the programme
should inject some $35,000 a year into
the coffers of the Makuleke—roughly
$400 per family, in a region where four out
of every ten adults is unemployed and
the average annual wage is about $750.
Projects like this offer food for
thought on the eve of the United Nations
Year of Ecotourism,slated for 2002. O n e
of the keys lies in equal terms: w h e r e
local residents have strong rights over
their wildlife and other natural resources,
they can negotiate with private operators
to ensure that their interests—financial,
THIS PARK IS NO LONGER YOUR LAND
