Bertolt Brecht and Unesco
on communication
Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), the world-famous German playwright and
poet, wrote in his Theory of Radio (1927-1932) :
"Here is a proposal designed to transform the way radio is used,
and thus to reveal its constructive aspects: it must be transformed
from an instrument of distribution into an instrument of communication.
Radio could be the most remarkable instrument of communication
imaginable in public life, a vast network of communication-channels.
Or rather, it could be such an instrument if it were capable not only of
sending out but also of receiving; not only of getting its audience to listen
but also of getting them to speak; not of isolating them but of bringing
them into contact with their fellows. If this is to come about, radio
must cease to be simply a provider and organize a supply furnished
by listeners themselves".

Gesellschaft) (Writings 2. On Literature and Art, Politics and Society).
It is interesting to compare Brechts ideas with those set out in Unesco's
Medium-Term Plan (1977-1982):
"Although the notion of 'the free flow of information' goes back
some 50 years, it has been invoked as a concept... only since the end
of the Second World War... Although the word 'communication' was
already current at that time in English-language texts, what was meant,
in fact, was a rather one-sided dissemination of information. It was
only much later that there emerged the concept of communication in
its true sense (from the Latin communicare: to make common, to share)
no longer implying merely an active transmitter and a passive receiver,
but allowing for feedback from the latter of a kind to modify the behaviour
of the former or, better still, requiring the active participation of all
concerned in the communication process, which thus becomes a pluri-
dimensional flow of information with multiple feedback."
