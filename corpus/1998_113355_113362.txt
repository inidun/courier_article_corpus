For more than 900 ye a rs , the unive rsity has been
remarkably active in “ e x p o rting itself” .T h e
gr e at medieval unive rsities of Pa ri s , O x f o r d
and Prague drew on the experience of Bologna,
sometimes held to be the earliest unive rsity of them
a l l .So it is hardly surp rising if the inspiration of some
f o rms the basis of others.But no higher education sys-
tem is exactly the same as its neighbours.
For all their va ri e t y,the way most systems of higher
e d u c ation have developed harks back to what may
be seen as four referential and historical models of the
u n i ve rs i t y :the Napoleonic model (France), the Hum-
boldtian (Germ a ny ) ,the “ m a r k e t - d ri ve n ”model (the
United States) and the model of higher educat i o n
e q u ated with the United Kingdom. Until recently,
the so-called “ S oviet model”and its deri vat i ves from
a command economy might well have figured
amongst the ranks of these “system shaping”m o d e l s.
The Napoleonic model is one of the earliest
examples of the state harnessing the unive rsity to the
m o d e rn i z ation of society. It did this by maintaining
close control over fin a n c i n g,over academic appoint-
ments and the use of legal instruments to ensure
t h at national provision was similar across the nat i o-
nal territory. In its classic form, the “Napoleonic”
university is a powerful lever in asserting a singular
national identity, based on the principles of formal
equality and merit which are themselves both defi-
ned and upheld by a powerful national administra-
t i o n . In addition to France, this pat t e rn ranged ove r
such countries as Spain and Italy, and is also to be
seen in Argentina and many of the French-spea-
king African nations.
The Humboldtian model of unive rs i t y, so called
after Wilhelm von Humboldt,a radical reformer of the
P russian higher education system in the early 19th
c e n t u ry, is often seen as being at the ori gins of the
p r e s e n t - d ay “research unive rs i t y ” committed to
“ a d vancing the frontiers of know l e d g e ” .H u m b o l d t
attached special importance to the freedom of senior
m e m b e rs of the unive rsity to pursue enquiry without
interference from gove rn m e n t .And more to the point,
g ove rnment should,he argued, ensure the freedom of
teaching and learn i n g . Most important of all, t h e
Humboldtian interp r e t ation placed on the unive r-
sity the duty to conduct both teaching and research.
The third model is that of the “market-driven”
university, best represented by the various systems
of higher education in the United States. Though
deeply influenced by the Humboldtian ethic, t h e
United States system contained three features which
set it off from its European counterparts.The first
was the emphasis upon “useful know l e d g e ” ; t h e
second,its close ties with the local community;the
third,and perhaps the source of its most powerful
appeal today, its close ties with the economy.The
United States was the first to develop a mass higher
education system,more than half a century ago.
The fourth referential system is that of the Uni-
ted Kingdom. It is often cited as an outstanding
example of a unive rsity system enjoying immense ins-
titutional autonomy. University independence was
once ensured by a unique system of funding by
which gove rnments left the responsibility for dis-
t ri buting public money to the unive rsities them-
s e l ve s. B ritish unive rsities were well known for their
attention to student personal development in addi-
tion to intellectual prowess. Important too was the
idea of residentiality as the basis of an academic
c o m m u n i t y. Students lived on campus. A system
long devoted to an elite educat i o n , the United King-
dom was relat i vely late in reaching massific at i o n ,
doing so only in the course of the 1980s.
These models, in their different way s ,h ave sha-
ped the wo r l d ’s unive rs i t i e s , especially in the post-
1950 peri o d , when most of them were founded.B u t
the “ a r c h e t y p e s ”t h e m s e l ves have also changed.M a ny
of them look to developments in the wo r l d ’s largest
higher education system–the United States–as a
source of inspirat i o n .Whether this will alter as today ’s
ve rsion of globalization sets a premium on rapid
c h a n g e , and which will be the “ r e f e r e n t i a l ”s y s t e m s
in two decades, time alone will tell. ■
