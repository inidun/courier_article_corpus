»FTER the dismemberment
of the Empire of Charlemagne, the
Christian West was at a low ebb. The
tenth century was a sombre period
when conditions favoured neither the
growth of great political empire-building
movements nor the dissemination of
philosophical ideas.
In the Muslim East, however, the
tenth century was a time of brilliant
intellectual progress. The empires of
the East, linked by a vigorous faith,
attracted to themselves a great number
of scholars who made a unique contri¬
bution to the cultural heritage of
mankind.
In the empire of the Samanids (819-
1005), with its capital in Bokhara, the
talents of poets such as Rudaki and
Daqiqi and of scholars such as Rhazes
and Avicenna, flourished, while Ghazna,
the capital of the empire of the Ghaz-
navids (977-1186), which stretched
from western India as far as Khwarizm,
was the home of many poets and
scholars such as 'Unsuri and Firdausi,
the author of the Book of Kings, epic
masterpiece of Persian literature.
Al-Biruni was one of the many
scholars and philosophers who were
drawn to the court of Sultan Mahmud
(998-1030) in Ghazna, where he was
employed as the court astronomer.
This mixture of astrology and astron¬
omy was not, however, enough to
satisfy the thirst for knowledge of a
man with such an enquiring mind.
Al-Biruni's works, both before and
after his arrival In Ghazna, show him
to have been a man of many and varied
interests. He carried out research in
almost all the subjects known at that
time. Among the pure sciences,
astronomy was naturally the pivotal
point around which all his other
interests revolved.
The extent of his knowledge, particu¬
larly in astronomy, may be judged from
two main works: the Mas'udic Canon
and the Kitab al-Tafhim (a book of in¬
structions on the elements of the
science of astrology).
The Mas'udic Canon is an almost
complete encyclopedia of astronomy
and of the related sciences. It consists
of 11 volumes dealing simultaneously
with cosmology, chronology, geography
and mathematics as well as astronomy.
Avicenna's Canon of Medicine is justly
famous, but the sheer scale and the
intrinsic value of the Mas'udic Canon
place it in the same category.
In compiling the works of his pre¬
decessors, al-Biruni corrected many of
their mistakes, both theoretical and
experimental. He never made a formal
break with the geocentric system which
was universally accepted In the Middle
Ages. He was, however, aware of the
existence of the heliocentric system
from the works of Greek astronomers
like Asistarchus of Samos, and also
from the teachings of certain sages
whom he had met in India.
Al-Biruni hesitated for many years
between the two systems and in fact
remained undecided until his death; it
is important to stress, however, that

SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION (Continued)
he always maintained that there was
absolutely no contradiction between the
heliocentric hypothesis and the laws
of astronomy. As he himself said:
" I have seen the astrolabe called
Zuraqi invented by Abu Sa'id Sijzi.
I liked it very much and praised him
a great deal, as it is based on the idea
entertained by some to the effect that
the motion we see is due to the Earth's
movement and not to that of the sky.
By my life, it is a problem difficult of
solution and refutation . . . For it is the
same whether you take it that the Earth
is in motion or the sky. For, In both
cases, it does not affect the Astronomi¬
cal Science. It is just for the physicist
to see if it is possible to refute it."
Al-Biruni was throughly familiar with
the astronomical works of Ptolemy and
other Greek astronomers. In geometry,
his work Is based on that of Euclid and
of Archimedes and Theon (4th cen¬
tury A.D.), but he was also acquainted
with the work of the great Indian
astronomer Brahmagupta (6th to
7th centuries A.D.) and the astronomi¬
cal works of the Indian, Tabahafara
(7th century A.D.).
In his book on India, al-Biruni quotes
a passage from Brahmagupta's book
concerning the rotation of the earth:
"The followers of Aryabhata maintain
that the earth is moving and heaven
resting. People have tried to refute
them by saying that, if such were the
case, stones and trees would fall from
the earth. "
But, says al-Biruni:
"Brahmagupta does not agree with
them, and says that that would not
necessarily follow from their theory,
apparently because he thought that all
heavy things are attracted towards the
centre of the earth . . .
"Besides, the rotation of the earth
does in no way impair the value of
astronomy, as all appearances of an
astronomic character can quite as well
be explained according to this theory
as to the other. There are, however,
other reasons which make it imposs¬
ible. This question is most difficult
to solve. The most prominent of both
modem and ancient astronomers have
deeply studied the question of the
moving of the earth, and tried to refute
it. We, too, have composed a book
on the subject called Miftah-ilm-alhai'a
(Key to Astronomy), in which we think
we have surpassed our predecessors,
if not in the words, at all events In the
matter."
In his measurements of the circum¬
ference of the earth, he was only
110 km. out by comparison with modern
measurements. He studied the sun
during the eclipse and ways of measur¬
ing the illuminated parts of the moon.
He described the various phases of the
dawn and the dusk and carried out
observations of the new moon. He
studied the astronomy of the stars.
He classified the celestial bodies
(planets and fixed stars) by order of
magnitude (in fact by their luminosity.)
He noted stars' positions and observed
their apparent motion around the poles.
His list included 1,029 stars.
He learned about trigonometry from
India, and was the first to establish it
as a science distinct from that of
astronomy.
He was the first geometrician to use
the radius of the circle as unity, an
idea which immenseley simplified
calculations. He wrote the best
medieval account of the arithmetical
systems used in India and on methods
of extracting the cube root.
Al-Biruni compiled a table of the
latitudes and longitudes of the 600 most
important towns and localities in the
Islamic world; this enabled him to
determine with scientific accuracy the
direction of Mecca, to which Muslims
turn to pray. When constructing
mosques, builders could thus place the
mihrabs (semicircular niches In the
wall indicating the direction of Mecca)
correctly.
For the purposes of cartography, he
invented a special system of stereo-
graphic projection, remarkably simple
to use, whereby the part of the globe
to be represented is projected on the
great circle of which the point of vision
is the pole.
Al-Biruni was severely critical of
astrologers and their unscientific
approach to their work. Thus it was
that he came to write a treatise which
he called A Warning Against the Art of
False Predictions by the Stars. In the
Mas'udic Canon, he denounced the
alleged "secrets" of astrologers' pre¬
dictions, pointing out that, although
they were supposed to be dictated by
the influence of the celestial bodies on
human lives, one prediction often
contradicted another.
He was also a geologist and ob¬
served the stratified structure of the
rocks, noting that:
"We have to rely upon the records
of the rocks and vestiges of the past
to infer that all these changes should
have taken place very long ago and
under unknown conditions of cold and
heat: for even now it takes a long time
for water and wind to do their work.
And changes have been going on and
observed and noticed within historical
times."

THE FORTRESS
OF NANDANA
In the Fortress of Nandana,
left, al-Biruni computed the
radius and circumference of
the earth in the year 1018.
The fortress stands in hilly
country about 100 kilometres
from Islamabad, capital of
modern Pakistan. Al-Biruni
explained his method In the
Mas'udic Canon. First he
calculated the height of a
neighbouring peak, possibly
the one seen here behind
the fortress, then he
measured the angle from
the summit to the earth's
horizon. His results were
amazingly accurate. H e
made the earth's radius
6,338.80 kilometres, com¬
pared with today's mean
figure of 6,370.98 kilometres
or 6,353.41 kilometres at the
latitude of Nandana, a dif¬
ference of barely 15 km.

He wrote of the great geological
changes which had occurred in the
remote past, long before the creation
of man, and also during human exis¬
tence, and some of his observations
are of great Interest. His discovery of
fossils of marine animals led him to
the conclusion that:
"Sea has turned into land and land
into sea; which changes, if they happen
before the existence of man, are not
known, and if they took place later they
are not remembered because with the
length of time the record of events
breaks, especially if this happens
gradually. This only a few can realize.
"This steppe of Arabia was at one
time sea, then was upturned so that
the traces are still visible when wells
or ponds are dug, for they begin with
layers of dust, sand and pebbles, then
there are found in the soii shells, glass
and bones which cannot possibly be
said to have been buried there on
purpose. Nay, even stones are
brought up In which are embedded
shells, cowries and what Is called
'fish-ears', sometimes well-preserved,
or the hollows are there of their shape
while the animal has decayed."
His interest next turned to the deter¬
mination of specific gravities, to vacuum
theory, the propagation of heat, the
dilatation of bodies and the reflection
and refraction of light. He even
attempted to establish a tentative
comparison between the speeds of
light and sound.
In a totally different field, we find
references in his works to the con
struction of a canal linking the Medi¬
terranean and the Red Sea, to the
desalination of sea water and even to
the atomistic theories of Democritus
Furthermore, and it is in this respect
that he really emerges as a precursor
of the great geniuses of the Renais¬
sance and the Enlightenment, he also
turned his attention to the human
sciences, in which his achievement is
quite extraordinary for someone living
in an age which was certainly not
noted for its tolerance.
By virtue. of his official post at the
court of Sultan Mahmud, al-Biruni was
required to take part in the Sultan's
campaigns. This did not prevent him
realizing his greatest wish, which was
to make contact with Indian thought.
The long periods which he spent in
India left an indelible impression upon
him, resulting in some of his most
remarkable works, in particular his
great work on India.
He went to India in the train of a
military conqueror, but it was in the
guise of a simple student that he
introduced himself to his Indian
masters. He learned Sanskrit in order
to study Indian sacred writings and
scientific texts. He was soon to be
regarded as the equal of his masters,
both for his learning and for his
desire to spread the knowledge he
possessed. His erstwhile teachers
thus became his pupils and he taught
them the elements of Islamic, Mani-
chean, Christian, Mazdaist and Hebrew
thought with such success that they
gave him the affectionate sobriquet
"Boundless Ocean".
Al-Biruni's profound study of the
Hindu religion enabled him to under¬
take a comparative study of the major
religions of his day, examining for the
first time the ties which bind the Greek,
Christian, Manichean, Jewish and Hindu
faiths. He particularly stressed the
Hindu belief in the transmigration of
souls.
His work on India is not, however,
concerned solely with religion, but also
contains chapters of the greatest value
on the Hindu social system and Indian
geography, mathematics and medicine.
It is greatly to his credit that, unlike
so many of his contemporaries, he saw
India as something more than merely
a place where rich booty was to be
had. His work is thus an objective
and complete record of Hindu civi¬
lization and a source-book for his
fellow-Muslims who had until then been
ignorant of Hindu culture.
Al-Biruni's work thus presents us
with an outstanding example of an
encyclopaedic mind ranging over both
the exact sciences and the human
sciences, and a model of respect for
other people's manners, beliefs and
customs in short, for other people's
cultures. He teaches us tolerance
through understanding of other nations,
and for this reason we respect al-Biruni
as he respected others. As he him¬
self said:
"If you are to learn to like other
peoples, learn their language and show
respect for their way of life for
their customs, their thought and their
religion."
