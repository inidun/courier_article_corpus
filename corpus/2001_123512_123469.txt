Brang Ja (not his real name) was only 16
when he was enlisted in the Myanmar
army in 1997.But the decision wasn’t his.
He was on his way to visit his mother in the
far north of Myanmar when the police
arrested him in the city of Mandalay
because he wasn’t carrying any
identification papers.
Two months later, military policemen
visited him in jail and offered him a way
out by joining the army. He agreed, f e a r i n g
that he would otherwise remain in jail for
y e a r s. One of the officers remarked that he
was “at the best age to begin military
t r a i n i n g.”But when he and other released
prisoners arrived at a military training
camp in the northern town of Shwebo,
they found that some recruits were as
young as nine.A few of them had tried to
escape from the camp, but no one had
succeeded.

The child in arms
Myanmar’s protracted civil and ethnic wars have forced one of the highest number of children in the
world onto the battlefield, bringing them face to face with beatings,
murder and a blossoming drugs trade
After serving in one of Myanmar’s
numerous civil wars between its myriad
ethnic groups, Brang Ja managed to flee
through the jungle to Thailand,where he
related his experiences.
Since 1988, when the military brutally
suppressed a nation-wide uprising for
d e m o c r a cy, the strength of Myanmar’s
armed forces has more than doubled,f r o m
about 185,000 men to 450,000 today. The
officially stated goal is to build a 500,000-
strong army to crush the widespread ethnic
unrest and stifle any popular dissent.
Myanmar (formerly Burma) is the
only country in East Asia that is expanding
its military instead of reducing it. Th i s
rapid growth has been possible because
children are routinely recruited.The total
number of child soldiers here is difficult to
e s t i m a t e. But observers guess that at least
50,000 children are engaged in military
a c t i v i t y. Many of these boys are kidnapped
or forcibly conscripted into the Ta t m a d a w
(the Burmese name for the armed forces),
and about half this number serve in the
private armies of various ethnic groups.
The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child
Soldiers (see interview p. 40) believes that
Myanmar “rivals parts of Africa as one of
the largest recruiters of child soldiers”in
the world.
A 1992 document from UN I C E F s t a t e s
that 14-year-olds are officially conscripted.
Placed in military camps for training, t h e y
are called “Ye Nyunt Lunge,” or “Brave
Sprout Youth.”
These recruits are often expected to
perform the same duties as adult soldiers,
and may be beaten or killed if they are not
able to do so. Children are sometimes used
in frontline combat or in dangerous
human-wave attacks, in which hundreds
have been killed. Others are used to dig
t r e n c h e s, cook or serve as porters carrying
ammunition and supplies.According to a
report entitled “No Childhood at A l l ? ”
by Images A s i a , an NGO based in Chiang
Mai (Thailand),most child soldiers have
never attended school or were pulled out
after just a few years.
A “mother and 
father” army
“Many of us were only 14 or 15 years
o l d ,” says an unnamed child soldier,
quoted in the report.“ There were three or
four soldiers who were only 12…they
c o u l d n ’t carry their rifles properly, t h e y
were so small, but they had to do the same
training as regular soldiers. Chiko, a 12-
y e a r- o l d , served as an attendant to a
c o r p o r a l . One day, he was beaten up really
badly by him and sent to hospital. H e
ended up blind and half-paralyzed from
it… I actually saw this beating.”
Street children and orphans are
particularly vulnerable and are taught that
the army is their only “mother and father.”
The UNICEF report identified at least one
military camp near Kengtung in eastern
Shan state. It noted that children as young
as seven were being trained and used as
“porters, human shields or human mine-
sweepers.”
The Images Asia report is replete with
examples of atrocities against Myanmar’s
child soldiers. Aung Tay, 14,talks about a
drunk battalion commander who shot
three boys while they slept because they
did not obey his command to wake up.
“ They couldn’t wake up because they had

been making bricks all night and were
exhausted,”Aung Tay says.
The report says most child soldiers
have either witnessed murders or been
forced to kill and plunder. During an
offensive in Mawchi, Kayah state, Ay e
Myint and a band of boy soldiers “ e n t e r e d
a village and shot all the villagers, b e c a u s e
we thought of them as our enemies. We
took all their pigs and chickens, all usable
goods…then we burnt the village.We took
all the women and raped them, and fin a l l y
we murdered them.”
Some child soldiers join the army
willingly to protect their families from the
army or to provide a much-needed income.
These perceived “ b e n e f i t s ” are rarely
r e a l i z e d , especially when child soldiers are
stationed far from their own villages. C h i l d
recruits are underpaid or not paid at all due
to rampant corruption in the military.
“They are forced to grow up too quickly,”
says Ma Mi Suu Pwint,a female soldier in
a resistance militia (All-Burma Students’
Democratic Front),quoted in the report.
“I joined the military in 1993,when I
was 16,” says Tai Ling Au n g, a fis h e r m a n ’s
s o n , quoted in the report.“My family was
very poor and I had to join the Ta t m a d a w
to support them.”
The plight of Myanmar’s children has
been highlighted in recent reports by the
World Bank and the Asian Development
B a n k . The lack of educational
opportunities for young recruits only
compounds the grave economic and social
problems affecting the country.
Since Myanmar’s independence from
Britain in 1948, several of the country’s
ethnic minorities, who make up an
estimated 40 percent of the
p o p u l a t i o n ,have been fig h t i n g
for autonomy or outright
s e p a r a t i o n .This tragedy is seen
as the main reason why
M y a n m a r, a country with no
real external enemies, began to
build up a strong army as early
as the 1950s. In 1962,the army
seized direct power over the
state in a coup d’état and began
to rule by decree, a b o l i s h i n g
M y a n m a r ’s fragile
parliamentary system. Th e
military also introduced a
disastrous policy  called “The
Burmese Way to Socialism,”
which turned what had once
been one of A s i a ’s most
prosperous countries into a
political and economic wreck.
A narcotics militia
Annual resolutions by the United
Nations urging the military to open a
dialogue with the opposition have
produced few tangible results, d e s p i t e
recent efforts by the UN’s special envoy to
Myanmar, Razali Ismail.
Since the 1988 uprising, the military
authorities have signed ceasefire
agreements with more than 20 ethnic rebel
a r m i e s, which have thus been “ b r o u g h t
into the legal fold.” The level of fighting
and military recruitment of children
should have fallen.Yet many of the armies
continue to recruit them after a ceasefir e.
The worst of these offenders is the
drug-running United Wa State A r m y
( U W S A ) , which controls a large swathe of
territory adjacent to the Chinese border.
The group stopped fighting with the
government after a peace agreement in
1 9 8 9 . N o w, leaders of the group are
frequent visitors to the capital, R a n g o o n ,a s
well as Mandalay and other cities, where
they have substantial investments in real
e s t a t e, the hotel business and
m a n u f a c t u r i n g. But they still seem to need
an army to protect the many heroin and
methamphetamine laboratories that have
been established inside UWSA’s territory.
According to international anti-
narcotics agencies, the UWSA is the most
heavily armed drug-trafficking
organization in the world. More than half
of this 20,000-strong army consists of
c h i l d r e n ,many of them 10- or 12-years-old.
Among the ethnic armies still
rebelling against the government, t h e
Karen National Union (KNU) is known
to recruit very young children and use
them in combat. In early 2000, a n o t h e r
much smaller Karen militia called “ G o d ’s
A r m y ” attracted worldwide attention
after they attacked a hospital in
R a t c h a b u r i , a town across Myanmar’s
border with Thailand.
The guerrilla force was led by two 12-
y e a r-old twin boys, Johnny and Luther
H t o o, and most of their troops were other
Karen children who had been orphaned in
the civil war. These children have known
nothing but violence since they were born.
And this tragic state of affairs is likely to
continue as long as Myanmar remains a
war zone. ■
