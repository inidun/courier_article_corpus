500 million ior the 'Middle Way'
The exact number of Buddhists
in the world is not known.
In Asia as many as 500 mil¬
lion people or one-fifth of the
earth's population are followers of
the religion of the Middle Way.
Countries of southeast Asia today
have the highest proportion of
Buddhists: Ceylon (62%) ; Burma
(80 %) ; Thailand (90 %) ; Cambo¬
dia (80 %) ; Laos (83 %). Buddhists
in China and Japan are more numer¬
ous than those in any other country
although the two countries are no
longer predominantly Buddhist.
Japanese Buddhists are estimated at
46 million, including numerous sects
and doctrines ranging from the
vastly popular Shin to the austere,
contemplative sects of the Zen
Buddhists who believe that enlight¬
enment, comes from a sudden flash
of intuition during disciplined medi¬
tation. In India, birthplace of
Buddhism, the religion has practi¬
cally died out since the 12th century.
Buddhist thought and teaching
fall into two great schools.
The first, called The Way of
the Elders (Theravada) is often
referred to by other Buddists as
the Lesser Vehicle (Hinayana). It
seeks to retain the early teachings
of Buddha down to the letter, views
the Buddha as a human being, a
teacher whose Enlightenment raised
him above all others. His Nir
vana was the same as that of any
other person who attains it." He
dispensed no divine power. The¬
ravada Buddhism stresses that man's
destiny is moulded by his own acts;
salvation comes by following mo¬
nastic self-discipline. Since it exists
today chiefly in Ceylon, Burma,
Thailand, and Cambodia, it is often
spoken of as the Southern School.
JAPAN
The Northern School which
spread from India to Nepal,
Tibet, China, Korea and Japan
is known as The Greater Vehicle
(Mahayana), i.e. the boat in which
all can ride. Its doctrine is less
rigorous and does not limit salvation
to the monastic order. Every per¬
son, however humble, may become
a candidate for Buddhahood if he
but wills it and holds to his purpose.
The historical Gautama falls into
the background, making way for a
Pantheon of Buddhas viewed as
redeemers or gods. The most
conspicuous is Buddha Amitabha
(He of Infinite Light). Each
Buddha dwells in a paradise amidst
a retinue of Bodhisattvas or future
Buddhas who have vowed not to
enter Nirvana until they have led
all living creatures there. The path
to salvation: love for the holy
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the
past, love for one's fellow creatures
by self-sacrifice for their needs, ac¬
tive compassion and charity.
Despite the differences in some
of the outward trappings and
symbolic mythology of the
two schools, no violent break ever
split Buddhism into two hostile
camps. Instead there was contact
and mutual exchange of views with
members of both schools living
within the same monastery. The
World Fellowship of Buddhists
groups members from both schools
from all countries.
The total amount of Buddhist
literature is enormous. Al¬
though the Buddhist canon
exists in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibet¬
an versions, the only complete col¬
lection of the Buddhist scriptures
now existing in an Indian language
is the Pali Canon of Ceylon. It
is known as the Tipitakas (or Tri-
pitakas), meaning "The Threefold
Basket". These comprise Vinaya,
the rules of discipline ; Sutta (or Su¬
tra) sermons, commentaries and pa¬
rables; Abhidhamma, philosophy,
psychology, and physics. In addi¬
tion there is the anthology of verses
known as the Dhammapada (see
page 42) and several collections of
moral tales, the best known being
the Jataka stories (see page 22).
Six great Councils have been
held during the history of
Buddhism to re-examine and
revise the teachings of Buddha.
Four took place before the Christian
era, the last in about 29 to 13 B.C.
when the texts of the teachings were
committed to writing for the first
time. At the Fifth Council, in
Mandalay, Burma, in 1871, the texts
were recorded on 729 marble slabs.
At the Sixth Buddhist World
Council which has just ended
in Rangoon, 500 monks were
appointed to re-examine the texts of
the Buddhist scriptures after a large
corps of lay scholars had first edited
versions in the Pali language and
had made draft translations into
Burmese. These texts were the
Tipitakas (above) and filled 54 books
totalling 14,804 pages, but it was
believed that the essential parts of
the Buddha's teachings could be
aranged in two or three volumes of
about 500 pages each. The abridg¬
ed Tipitakas would contain the
essence of the doctrine in proper
sequence.
The Buddha has been known by
many names. His family
name was Gautama and the
name he was given at his birth, Sid-
dhartha, means "He who has
reached his goal". Buddha has also
been called Baghavât, or "The
Blessed One" and Jina "The Victo¬
rious One". Another of his names,
Sakyamuni, means '"The Sage of the
Sakyas" while Tathagata has been
rendered as "He who has fully come
through" or, more briefly, "The Per¬
fect One". The name Buddha comes
from "Budh", meaning, "to awa¬
ken", and signifies "The Enlightened
One". This last name describes not
only the Prince Siddhartha Gau¬
tama, but every being who has van¬
quished ignorance and achieved su¬
preme wisdom.
