O t p o r : the youths
who booted Milosevic
It took a generation of 20 year-olds without a manifesto or leader to shake
Serbia out of its lethargy. Armed only with slogans and spray paint, they dealt
a fatal blow to the dictatorship

pressure and mass demonstrations contri-
buted to Milosevic’s doomsday. So did
Otpor (“Resistance” in Serb), w h o s e
story is unique in the annals of eastern
European protest movements. Without
leaders or a clear cut political ideology,
the group played a decisive role: like a
termite colony, Otpor gnawed away at
the regime’s foundations before the top
realized that the whole edifice was roc-
king.
Founded by a handful of libertarians
in October 1998, Otpor counted
4 , 0 0 0 members by the end of 1999, a
number that has swelled to 100,000 today.
The overwhelming majority can’t even
remember when the movement was born.
Vague memories of
the war’s early days
All it takes to meet them is a visit to
49 Knez Mihajlova Street, B e l g r a d e ’s
most stylish pedestrian thoroughfare,
where anti-NATO demonstrators sacked
the French, British, German and Ame-
rican cultural centres during the March
1999 bombing campaign.Otpor squatted
an old, run-down Belgrade university
annex there. In this tiny beehive of acti-
v i t y, covered with stencils of the resis-
tance movement’s famous black fist and
jam-packed with fil e s, l e a flets and posters,
initiatives were hatched that brought a
1 3 - y e a r-old mafia-ridden political system
to its knees.
S o fia ,A n a , Milos and Mihaïlo are bet-
ween 17 and 24 years old.When a western
journalist arrives,many of their friends in
the office join in the discussion,held in a
s m a l l ,narrow room.Soon the tiny desk is
cluttered with cups of Turkish coffee.
Everyone serves each other and trades
cigarettes in a good-natured atmosphere.
The first observation is that all those pre-
sent come from the same social back-
g r o u n d . Like most Serbs, their parents
get by on $40 to $80 a month, working
occasional odd jobs.Their grandparents,
who still live in the countryside, send a
little food to help out.
It doesn’t take long for the conver-
sation to switch to recent history. In 1989,
nationalism of all stripes was tearing the
Yugoslav federation apart. In June 1991,
war broke out in Slovenia, spreading like
w i l d fire to Croatia and, in spring 1992, t o
B o s n i a . The Yugoslav army was made
up of draftees, and an entire age group
was mobilized.By the end of 1991,Bel-
g r a d e ’s youth were in the streets, and the
police brutally cracked down on the pro-
tests. Otpor’s young activists only have
vague memories of these events. Barely
10 years old at the time, they were living
in a climate of war,deprivation and impo-
verishment.
On November 17, 1 9 9 6 , S l o b o d a n

and annulled them.Tens of thousands of

other cities. Students, who spearheaded
the protests,demanded that the results be
r e c o g n i z e d . E v e n t u a l l y, after three
m o n t h s, Milosevic made concessions and
the movement ran out of steam.
Recruiting the
disenchanted
Sofia Jarkovic, 17,is in her penulti-
mate year at a Belgrade high school.
She took part in these demonstrations
alongside her parents.Their failure made
a lasting impression on her, and on
March 20, 2000 she joined Otpor, w h o s e
sole aim was Milosevic’s overthrow.A n a
Vuksanovic, 24,who is working on her
m a s t e r ’s degree in French literature,
participated in every day of the 1996-97
protest marches .“ The problem was, w e
had set our sights too low,” she says.
“ We were demanding recognition of the
voting results, when in fact we should
have been demonstrating for new muni-
cipal, legislative and presidential elec-
tions, under the supervision of interna-
tional observers. Like many people, I
took this failure hard.Th a t ’s why I joined
Otpor as soon as it was founded two
years later.”
The movement got off to a quiet start
outside Serbia’s mainstream opposition.
Milosevic had managed to corrupt
several opposition municipalities while
students had become disgruntled with
politicking and established parties. The
leaders of the 1996-97 movement went
into exile, as many deserters and draft
dodgers had done during the 1991-1995
w a r s.S o o n , they were joined by deserters
from the Kosovo war (March-June 1999).
In less than ten years, several hundred
thousand Serbs became expatriates.A n d
most of them were the elite of pro-demo-
cratic youth.
The next generation found itself iso-
l a t e d . They had to come up with their
own methods of struggle, forge their own
experience, and above all, avoid selling
o u t . These teenagers had political
a c u m e n , but more than anything else,
i n t u i t i o n . And they wanted to stop a
regime that was stealing the fire of their
youth.
Armed with their impetuousness,
they managed to shake their parents and
grandparents out of lethargy. A d u l t s
started feeling ashamed of their apathy.
Rather than stir up revolt in army bar-
racks and corridors, they preferred to
convince the people around them.Po l i c e
manuals had no chapters on how to stifle
the awakening of civil society. Meanw-
h i l e,M i l o s e v i c, shut up in his ivory tower,
was incapable of sensing the agitation
that was about to sweep him off the stage.
One of Otpor’s greatest strengths lay
in its absence of hierarchy, a rule of
thumb for a movement grounded in
joyous anarchy. I t ’s a free-wheeling,a n y-
thing-goes protest movement.“I showed
up at their headquarters on March 20,
2 0 0 0 ,” recalls Sofia Ja r k o v i c. “I was a
little scared. I opened the door and said,
‘ H i , my name is Sofia and I want to be an
a c t i v i s t .’ They handed me a membership
form. I filled it out and left. Two weeks
l a t e r, they called me up, gave me an
appointment and I joined.” Milos Stan-
kovic, 17,is in his penultimate year at a
Belgrade high school and has belonged to
Otpor since Fe b r u a r y, 2 0 0 0 . “I joined
Otpor because it was against political
p a r t i e s,” he says.“I wanted to help change
t h i n g s, because I couldn’t stand seeing
people dealing with so many problems in
their day-to-day lives anymore.” A n a
Vuksanovic adds,“What got me excited
was that there weren’t any leaders, s o
there was no risk of being betrayed.”
Within a year, the movement took
root in four Belgrade universities,m o s t l y
with first and second-year students.The
hard core consisted of three small groups:
Democratic Students, the Students’
Union and the Students’ Fe d e r a t i o n .
Otpor forged relationships with N e z a-
v i s n o s t ( I n d e p e n d e n c e ) , S e r b i a ’s only
free trade union, as well as with the
defence workers’ union and the pensio-
ners’ organization.There were no ulterior
political motives for these choices. It was
just that the kids had parents in these
organizations.That’s vintage Otpor.
Sowing revolt 
in the family 
Milosevic took a harder line after
losing Kosovo in June 1999, but graffiti
calling for “Resistance until Vi c t o r y ”
began flourishing on walls.Slogans were
increasingly disrespectful and, t h e r e f o r e,
incomprehensible for rank-and-file mili-
tiamen and their leaders (see box). S o m e
100,000 copies of the newsletter S e r b
R e s i s t a n c e were secretly circulating.
During school vacations, university stu-
dents, joined by many high school and
even junior high school students, sowed
the seeds of revolt in their families,n e i g h-
bourhoods and villages.Otpor infil t r a t e d
the provinces. The democratic termites
were at work.
They scored a major success when
they went after the sacrosanct Yugoslav
a r m y. Activists held demonstrations in
front of military tribunals every time a
“What got me
excited was that
there weren’t any 
leaders, so there
was no risk of 
being betrayed.”
“Because I love Serbia.”

deserter went on trial.Adults, who had
lost so many children on the Croatian
and Bosnian fronts, could only be deeply
m o v e d . Otpor was changing mentalities.
The teens struck a painful nerve, w i t h o u t
ever resorting to violence. The police
were baffled by this type of protest move-
m e n t . In one year, they arrested 60
people for spraying graffiti or wearing
badges with the black fist,but balked at
beating up the kids, who were the same
age as their own children.
Sofia took part in her first street
demonstrations in April 2000:“One day,
a policeman tore off my badge. But he
d i d n ’t dare arrest me.”Ana and her boy-
f r i e n d ,B r a n k o, were expelled from their
university dorm rooms for protesting,
and her parents were summoned to the
police station.
In July 2000, Milosevic laid the
groundwork for a constitutional coup
d’état and announced a presidential elec-
tion for September 24.The divided oppo-
sition managed to cobble together an 18-
party coalition, the DOS (Democratic
Opposition of Serbia).At the first mee-
t i n g, Otpor representatives solemnly
offered their black flag with a white fist.
They were not joining, but warning:
Otpor will keep an eye on you until the
final victory.No more wheeling and dea-
ling.
The Otpor wave had risen.“I wasn’t
old enough to vote on September 24,”
says Sofia. “My parents were against
Milosevic. My mother, Mira, wanted to
vote for the DOS,but my father, D r a g a n ,
thought of abstaining. I talked him into
voting.”
The defeated dictator annulled the
election results.The wave swelled,c o v e-
ring the whole country with the same
graffiti:“He’s finished”and “Slobo, save
S e r b i a : kill yourself!” Provincial opposi-
tion municipalities, the DOS, trade unio-
nists and veterans started talking to
Otpor.
On October 5,all of them were ready.
“ That day, I dragged my father to the
parliament building at 2:30 in the after-
noon,” recalls Milos. “I joined Otpor in
front of the philosophy department at
the university,” says Sofia . “ We stayed
there until three o’clock before conver-
ging on the parliament. I was always
afraid of the crowd the whole time.”A n a
adds, “With four boys, I was part of an
Otpor group in touch with the DOS.O u r
job was to call on Belgrade’s citizens to
come out into the streets.We were among
the first wave of protesters who occu-
pied the B92 radio station, which the
government had taken over. I couldn’t
sleep several nights in a row. I was afraid
the government would launch a counter-
attack.”
Otpor could have disbanded on
October 6, b u t , mistrustful of politicians,
the movement decided to stay alert and
uncompromising until democracy is fir m l y
e s t a b l i s h e d . Mihajlo Cvekic, 1 8 , is in his
last year at Belgrade’s vocational  school,
where his major is tourism. He became a
member of Otpor on October 8 “ b e c a u s e
of their decisive role on October 5,” h e
e x p l a i n s.“Before then, I didn’t dare join
because I was afraid of retaliation, b u t
also because of my parents and grandpa-
r e n t s, who were hard-core Milosevic sup-
p o r t e r s. To d a y, they feel ashamed.” Th e
teenagers have quietly instilled demo-
cratic aspirations into the minds of family
members corrupted by nationalism.
“I’m as mobilized as ever,” a s s e r t s
Sofia.“I don’t want to join a party. The-
re’s still a need for Otpor. I don’t have a
sense that any meaningful changes have
taken place in everyday life.”Ana adds,
“I’m not afraid anymore. I’ve found an
apartment, I feel relieved and free. I’m
o p t i m i s t i c, but we have to be patient.
A n y w a y, I want to spend my life in
S e r b i a .”“So do I,” Milos chimes in.“ E v e n
though I know there won’t be a brighter
future for a long time to come.” ■
