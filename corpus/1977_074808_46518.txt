pioneer exploration
of a deepsea
volcanic canyon
where the earth's
crust is born
AT ten minutes past noon on
2 August 1973, the French
bathyscaphe/4/-c/ï/Vnèa'e came
to rest on the slopes of a volcano,
two and a half kilometres below the
surface of the North Atlantic and
700 kilometres south-west of the
Azores. Powerful lamps picked out
a cascade of black lava, which had
solidified at the moment of eruption
but looked as if it had emerged only
an instant earlier from the depths of
the earth.
The lava had seeped through
countless cracks, forming buds, ten¬
drils and petrified rivulets. Further
investigation proved that the eruption
was indeed of recent date, at least
in geological terms. It had occurred
a mere few thousand years ago.
The volcano, which the explorers
named Mount Venus, is 250 metres
high, a kilometre wide and three or
four kilometres from end to end. It
stands in the middle of a high-walled
valley three kilometres wide, the bot¬
tom of which is 2,700 metres below
the surface of the ocean.
The dive by Archimède marked the
beginning of expedition FAMOUS, the
French-American Mid-Ocean Under¬
sea Survey, during which three sub¬
marines Afvin, from the Ameri¬
can Woods Hole Océanographie
Institution, together with Archimède
and Cyana, were to spend two sum-

mer seasons exploring the valley,
travelling more than 90 kilometres at
a depth of more than 2,500 metres,
and less than five metres above the
bottom of the ocean bed.
The explorers spent altogether
228 hours in the valley, collecting
two tons of rock samples from 167
different sites, taking 23,000 photo¬
graphs and recording more than a
hundred hours of television films.
Their skilful navigation and accurate
survey made it possible to quickly
reconstruct the geology of this valley,
where the ocean bed is born.
It was immediately apparent that
this ocean landscape changed very
rapidly as it stretched away from the
centre of the valley towards its walls.
Along the fissured centre-line, where
the volcano had erupted, the crust
was freshly formed; the further the
rocks were from this line, the greater
their age.
How did the explorers know this,
as ' they peered out through the
portholes of their submarines?
Firstly, because of the snowlike
sediment in which the slopes of the
volcano were buried.
When plankton, the minute plant
and animal life which floats near the
surface of the ocean, dies, the chalky
remains sink slowly to the bottom,
where they pile up at a rate of 3 cm.
every thousand years, or 30 metres
every million years. Thus, after tens
of millions of years, the snow-like
layer of white sediment may well be
several kilometres deep.
What the explorers noticed, how¬
ever, was that Mount Venus itself
was barely dusted with this snow,
apart from a few drifts here and
there, while the lower parts of the
valley wall were buried under several
metres. In other words, the in¬
creasing depth of the sediment from
the centre of the valley to its edges
reflected the increasing age of the
underlying volcanic rocks.
Secondly, the submariners noticed
that the further they moved towards
the walls of the valley, the more
abundant were signs of animal life.
Dating of the rocks themselves
confirmed these initial observations.
The lava at the centre of the valley
was of recent origin; at the edges,
it was almost a hundred thousand
years old. It looked as though the
valley had been pushed outwards
from its centre during this period.
But how did this all happen ? To
understand the process, we must
return to Mount Venus, the origin of
the lava flow.
The volcano looks like a gigantic
black cauliflower, bursting out of its
skin. During formation, its surface
continually split and cracked, with
the oozing of buds of lava which, in
their turn, solidified almost imme¬
diately on contact with the surround¬
ing water.
This formation is typical of under¬
sea volcanoes. The crust of solidi¬
fied lava insulates the molten matter
underneath, which can only escape
by pushing upwards. Hence the
cauliflower-shape.
Northwards and southwards from
Mount Venus, the exploring subma¬
rines discovered whole areas of gap¬
ing fissures. What appears to have
occurred during the widening of the
valley is a stretching process, pulling
the crust outwards until it burst open
in a crazy pattern of cracks.
When the cracks deepened enough
to reach the molten matter under¬
neath, at a depth of two or three
kilometres, and when enough pres¬
sure had built up in the "magma
chamber", as it is called, lava was
squeezed up through the cracks, like
toothpaste out of a split tube. This
second process, known as extrusion,
covered all traces of everything

that had taken place before.,
The little valley which the expedi¬
tion examined in such detail forms
part of the floor of the Rift, the most
importantand for long the least-
knownfeature on the face of our
planet. But this is understandable
since it meanders along .most of its
60,000 kilometres at a depth of
2,500-3,000 metres beneath the
surface of the ocean at the centre of
the submarine mountain range known
as the Mid-Ocean Ridge..
The Rift is a split in the lithosphère,
the thin crust whichlike the rind of an
orangecovers the earth. Through¬
out the course of geological history,
basalt lava has leaked up almost
continuously through this split, re¬
newing the ocean bed on either side,
in the process known as "sea floor
spreading".
It was this process, which explains
why continents are drifting away from
each other on each side of the mid-
ocean ridge, that expedition FAMOUS
investigated.
Study of the Rift, and of the layers
of sediment under which the extru¬
sions of the volcano have been pro¬
gressively buried, provides the key to
the geography of the ocean bed
throughout its evolution, and to the
ancient structures and environments
in which each chapter of its history
was written.
How is this so? The immediate
answer to the question lies in the
discovery, after 20 years of explora¬
tion of the ocean depths, that the
oceanic crustunlike that which sup¬
ports the land masses of the earthis
short-lived. Oceans are born, live
out their lives and die in less than
200 million yearsa mere twenty-
fifth of the time which our planet has
taken to reach its present state.
Thus 200 million years ago, the In¬
dian and the Atlantic Oceans did not
exist, while a vast ocean covered the
space where the Alps and Himalayas
are today.
The birth of an ocean is the result
of the creative process studied by
FAMOUS at the bottom of the Rift.
In this process, the Rift valley
broadens under the pressure of lava
erupting from its central fissure,
pushing the older rocks out on each
side and permitting the ocean floor
to spread.
The oceanic Rift is a split between
two slab-like areas, or plates, in the
lithosphère, which are drifting apart.
By a process of injection, liquid basalt
rises from the depths of the earth to
fill the gap, the end result of which
was studied during expedition FA¬
MOUS. As it cools, this lava solidi¬
fies and forms the oceanic crustfive
or six kilometres thickon each side
of the split. The oceanic lithosphère
is thus the product of accretion, which
takes place symmetrically along the
edges of the Rift.
As it grows, the oceanic crust
evolves. Close to the Rift, where
the lithosphère is new, its average
temperature is very high. Conse¬
quently, its average density is rela¬
tively low and the water depth is
relatively shallow (2,500-3,000 m.).
With age the lithosphère grows
cooler and contracts, with the
result that the ocean depth in¬
creases. In other words, the older
the ocean is, the deeper it is. On
either side of the Rift, the ocean
grows steadily deeper until it reaches
the continental mass. Thus the
youngest part of the earth's crust (a
few dozen million years) is shaped
like a flattened isosceles triangle
whose summitwhere the Rift is
situatedis 2 1/2 or 3 kilometres
below the ocean surface, and whose
base is several hundred kilometres
wide.
This Mid-Ocean Ridge is too young,
and too far from the continents, as
FAMOUS discovered, to have recei¬
ved more than a dusting of the
"snow" of sediment.
When the lithosphère is more than
70 million years old, it is almost as
cool as it will ever be, and the ocean,
already more than 5,500 metres
deep, is slow to grow any deeper.
This is the ocean basin, the ocean's
second main feature after the Mid-
Ocean Ridge.
Here the water, being deeper, is
colder and under greater pressure.
It is also capable of absorbing more
calcium carbonate and silicaand
indeed does so, by dissolving any
planktonic remains that settle from
the surface to a depth of more than
4,500 metres.
Consequently, the "abyssal hills",
which are all that remain of the volca¬
noes of long ago, are not covered
with a chalky layer of "snow", but
with a fine insoluble "red clay", com-i
posed of particles carried by winds)
31

>and currents from the distant land.
This red clay usually' accumulates
very slowly, no more than a millimetre
every thousand years. If, however,
the basin is closer to a continent, and
not separated from it by a deep
trench, the process takes place more
rapidly.
Much sediment also enters the
ocean from the continental margins
in muddy avalanches known as turbi¬
dity currents, which bury the original
relief, thereby creating what oceano¬
graphers call abyssal plains.
If it is relatively easy now to
reconstruct the shape and structure
of an ocean during its long progress
from birth in the Rift to the state in
which we see it today, it is much
more difficult to identify the different
environments in which this develop¬
ment took place. Any indications
which we can obtain in this connexion
must come for the most part from the
sediment covering the ocean floor.
This is one of the major objectives
of the Deep Sea Drilling Project
(DSDP), launched by the United
States in 1968 and now involving
scientists from six countries: the
Federal Republic of Germany, France,
Japan, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. and
the United Kingdom.
Rock samples have been taken
from boreholes drilled by the re¬
search vessel Glomar Challenger at
more than 400 points in the earth's
crust, from the Antarctic to the
Arctic regions. Anchored at points
where the ocean is 5,500 metres
deep, it can drill more than 1.500
metres into the ocean bed. As a
result, we now know much about
the composition of the sea bed at
depths of up to seven kilometres
beneath the surface of the ocean.
It is impossible here to summarize
the results obtained from this great
international scientific venture, whose
scope and scale are increasing
rapidly. But its importance for the
reconstruction of the globeand its
climateat different stages in their
evolution is obvious.
We need only recall the words of
the pioneer of modern oceanography.
Professor Maurice Ewing, who obser¬
ved that if the land mass of the earth
can be compared with a picture
whose outlines are constantly being
blurred by time and the weather, the
ocean floor is like a wall that has
been covered with successive layers
of paint. There is information there,
but to reach it requires a scraperor a
drill. And Glomar Challenger has
the tools to do the job.
As an example, let us see what it
has taught us about the floor of the
Atlantic between North America and
Africa.
Here, the ocean has been growing
wider for 180 million years, at a rate
of about three centimetres each year,
and getting deeper during the pro¬
cess. Close to its surface, and even
more so in its depths, the circulation
of its water has been changing, too.
At the beginning of its history, this
ocean was in fact an enormous lake,
stretching away on either side of the
Equator and protected by dry land
from the cold water of the Poles.
Its situation was much like that of
the present-day Red Sea. It grew
wider and deeper very slowly. It
is probable thatat least in the
northernmost part of the oceanthe
initial sediments were composed of
salts, which settled down in a narrow,
relatively shallow basin, and were
subjected to a climate that was hot
and dry.
Deposition of carbonates followed
in an environment rich in oxygen and
in water certainly less than 2,000 me¬
tres deep. The water gradually deep¬
ened as the crust subsided, until
1 40 million years agoit was 3,000
metres deep or more. The waters
at the bottom remained motionless
and stagnant for long periods, as is
the case in the Black Sea today.
The sediments consequently were
rich in organic matter. Also the
presence of red clay for the first time
demonstrates the existence of a deep
ocean.
Between 110 million and 80 mil¬
lion years ago, a major epoch of
volcanic eruptions occurred, doubt¬
less related to the process which was
to separate Europe from North Am¬
erica. The sea flooded thecontinents,
trapping their erosion products on the
shallow continental plateaus.
THE separation of Europe from
North America began 80 mil¬
lion years ago. The sepa¬
ration of Greenland from Europe
occurred 60 million years ago and
led to the creation of the Norwegian
Sea, at which time water in the ocean
depths began to circulate vigorously.
With cold water pouring in from the
polar regions to the north, a system of
circulation similar to that of today's
Atlantic was established. This was
a period of erosion, rather than sedi¬
mentation.
Forty-five million years ago, thé
level of the ocean having fallen
considerably, the eroded sediments
of the continents were being trans
ported over the edge of the conti¬
nental shelf and into the depths.
This sedimentation went on increas¬
ing until 15 million years ago, al¬
though it was interrupted by epi¬
sodes of deep-water erosion about
30 million years ago when the
Antarctic regions began to freeze.
Then, in the northern hemisphere,
three million years ago, the Ice Age
began. This led to the accumula¬
tion of vast quantities of sediments
on the deep ocean floor, producing
abyssal plains. The sediments are
the result of erosion caused by the
retreat of the ocean and the lowering
of sea level during the periods when
the ice-caps thickened and advanced.
Since the last phase of the Ice Age,
11,000 years ago, this kind of ero¬
sion has sharply decreased, the sea
level having risen more than 100
metres.
From FAMOUS to DSDP, the ex¬
ploration of the ocean depths in all
dimensions has produced a coherent
picture in whichfor the first time
we can see how the globe and its
environment have changed during
the last 200 million years.
This critical period has seen the
progressive occupation of the conti¬
nents by living creatures, and the
appearancejust as the Ice Age was
beginning in the northern hemi¬
sphere Man's ancestors.
It seems certain that all the im¬
portant changes of climateabout
which so little is as yet known with
certaintyhave played a vital role
in the process of human settlement.
It is only by studying the ocean
that we can hope to understand the
whole story. But the ocean is a
very complicated place; its explora¬
tion has only just begun, and no
one would dare to guess what dis¬
coveries the future will bring.
