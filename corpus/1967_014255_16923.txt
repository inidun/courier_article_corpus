TO BUILD
by René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
T
HE Encyclical is addressed
to the Church and, more generally, to
all men of goodwill. Unesco, a strictly
secular organization, is essentially a
world-wide venture in goodwill. The
Holy Father may be certain that his
message will evoke a particularly
favourable response in this Organiza¬
tion . . .
I should like, on behalf of Unesco,
to convey my sincere appreciation to
the Holy Father who, in this vital
document, has reaffirmed the truly
fundamental importance which should
be attached to literacy, and who has
recognized the value of the efforts
being made to combat the under-nour-
ishment of men's minds which is no
less debasing than under-nourishment
of their bodies. I see in this an
assurance of the Church's active co¬
operation in the campaign for basic
education and functional literacy which
Unesco is striving to promote through¬
out the world.
But, just as the cause we serve
goes far beyond our action, limited
as it is by the inadequacy of our
resources and too often hampered by
our own shortcomings, so what

A NEW ORDER IN THE WORLD
touches us most in the Encyclical,
beyond the support and assistance
extended to our work, is the profound
agreement which clearly emerges in
the spirit, and sometimes almost In
the letter, between the views of the
Holy Father concerning the problems,
aims and methods of development
and those which Unesco has cons¬
tantly promoted since the beginning
of this decade. 1 should like to draw
attention to the essential points on
which we find this harmony of views.
First of all, concerning the nature
of the problem. Like His Holiness
Paul VI, we believe that development
is, in the strictest sense of the terms,
a work of "justice and peace".
For the Twentieth-century world,
underdevelopment is what the social
question was for the countries which
were carrying out their industrial revo¬
lution in the Nineteenth century. As
the Encyclical makes clear, it is in
fact the same problem that is involved,
but extended to the scale of the world
as a whole: the old problem of In¬
equity in the organization of society.
"Too many are suffering, and the
distance is growing that separates the
progress of some and the stagnation,
not to say the regression, of others."
There is no true remedy for this
inequitable situation other than mea¬
sures increasingly urgent measures
to secure justice. This should not be
interpreted as meaning arrangements
to make bitter poverty bearable and
inequity less shocking; what is needed
is the establishment of an order which
will gradually reduce and ultimately
eliminate the causes of this inequity
and poverty. Above all, we must see
that we do not have " one group
making progress at the expense of
the other", since this betokens a radi¬
cal injustice affecting the basic struc¬
tures and conditions of social
dynamics.
But if development ¡s a work of
justice, it is also a work of peace, and
here the most elementary and the most
general interest combines with the
loftiest duty.
The weakness of the poor presents
a dangerous temptation to the greed
and the lust for domination of the
powerful. And exploitation and domi¬
nation in turn engender revolt. It
would be wrong to delude ourselves
concerning the apparent tranquility
that has followed the accession to
political Independence of so many
countries which but yesterday were
still subject to colonial rule. Deep
currents are stirring in the developing
countries as they make the bitter
discovery that the independence so
ardently desired is still relative.
This deprived section of mankind
has lost nothing of its extraordinary
capacity to endure poverty; on the
other hand, it Is less and less ready
to accept inequity precisely because
of its newly-acquired political aware¬
ness. History records many terrible
outbursts of righteous anger from the
oppressed; the world has been
shaken by similar upheavals even in
the present century.
Among the distinguished thinkers
to whom the Pope appeals to study
our troubled world, I know of some
who are asking themselves anguishing
questions about what the next decade
will bring, when overpopulation, hun¬
ger, poverty and racial antagonisms
reach their peak at the same time
and combine to form one great tragic
problem. They are increasingly aware
that development is the only way of
avoiding upheavals on a planetary
scale.
Development is alsoindirectly
but nevertheless essentially Inter¬
connected with it the best way of con¬
verting force to peaceful purposes . . .
I am quite aware that the world
conflicts of modern times have set
the most highly developed countries
in opposition and that, in many res¬
pects, these conflicts have derived
from the contradictions inherent in
development itself. But this was a
development of power, seeking con¬
stantly to possess more, and not a
development of humanity, seeking to
" be more ".
Development, as we now under¬
stand it the development which
calls for assistance to the weak within
the context of a just and rational
organization of mankind as a whole
cannot be achieved or even conceived
unless objectivity rules the mind and
brotherhood the heart, these being
the very principles of the will to
peace. And if it is true that economic
necessity will one day compel us to
choose between universal develop¬
ment and the headlong arms race, it
Is even more evident that the pro- -_
found, whole-hearted commitment of X 7
the rich and powerful nations with all *"
their resources to the work of devel¬
opment would represent, and result

in, a general conversion of mankind
to peace.
The second point of agreement
that I should like to note is the concep¬
tion of development. We in Unesco
also believe that " in order to be
authentic, (development) must be
complete: integral, that is, it has to
promote the good of every man and
of the whole man" . . .
To proclaim the overriding need
for the integral development of what
is human is, in concrete terms, to
affirm the primacy of the individual in
the process of development, as the
subject, agent and end of that devel¬
opment.
It implies the condemnation of
technocracy, which is the cult of effi¬
ciency measured by standards that
leave the individual altogether out of
account and which, as the Encyclical
puts it so well, " can beget evils no
less redoubtable than those due to
the liberalism of yesterday". In more
general terms, it implies subjecting
economics to ethical considerations,
or rather infusing humanism into
economics so that, abandoning the
abstract for the concrete, it may lake
on new life. " Economics and tech¬
nology have no meaning except from
man whom they should serve ".
Finally and above all, it means recog¬
nizing that is to say, demonstrat¬
ing that there can be no real
development except that brought about
within himself by a man's indepen
dent efforts. " Man is only truly man
in as far as, master of his own acts
and judge of their worth, he Is author
of his own advancement", which
amounts to saying that the only true
progress is endogenous.
The requirements of practical action,
no less than the essentially humanis¬
tic mission it has to fulfil, have made
Unesco increasingly aware of these
essential truths, which clearly reveal
the significance of Unesco's particular
contribution to development. Once it
is realized that the only development
is that of man, through man and for
man, then it becomes evident that
education, science and culture are the
foundation and the culmination, the
driving force and the justifying end of
development in its essence. It has
been said that development is pri¬
marily a state of mind; we might go
further and say that development is
the human mind on the march in
history.
is preparation,
is discovery and
Education, which
science, which
explanation, culture, which is exami¬
nation and assimilation, represent the
decisive phases and aspects of this
progress of the mind. It Is for this
reason that we find them, at the most
essential level, in the gradual unfold¬
ing of development. Everything
begins with education, since no appro¬
priation, utilization or development of
nature and society is possible without
education: hence the universal priority
accorded to it.
The implantation of science is the
key operation in development; it differs
very greatly from the mere Import of
techniques which, even if it leads to
local progress generally superficial
and seldom lasting perpetuates the
economic and intellectual dependence
of the developing peoples. Finally, it is
abundantly clear that there can be no
development from within except where
scientific civilization has taken root, in
other words, where science has
ceased to be an alien magic and has
become culture.
This, then, Is the humanistic concep¬
tion of integral development which we
share. Yet perhaps the most
remarkable statement of views In the
Encyclical Is the declaration, knit¬
ting, together the whole, that there
can be no progress towards the com¬
plete development of the individual
man without the simultaneous deve¬
lopment of all men in the spirit of
solidarity. And of that, too, we In
Unesco are profoundly convinced.
Indeed, that belief is the very reason
for our existence.
It is therefore an immense source
of satisfaction and encouragement for
us that the Holy Father should lay
such stress, as he did before the
General Assembly of the United
Nations, on the necessity for a world
authority and on the urgent need, in
the meantime, to increase the resour-

ces, activities and prestige of the
International organizations concerned
with development.
It is very true that the efforts of
these institutions can do more than
any other form of aid to bring about,
as desired in the Encyclical, " a system
of co-operation freely undertaken, an
effective and mutual sharing, carried
out with equal dignity on either side,
for the construction of a more human
world ". Not because greater resour¬
ces are available for those efforts
as we know, that Is very far from
being the case but, first and fore¬
most, because they alone are comple¬
tely disinterested. And also because
they are better suited to the nature of
the task, which is the organization of
a new order in the world . . .
If I have drawn attention, even at
the risk of repeating the obvious, to
the main points of a fundamental har¬
mony of views on development
between the Encyclical and the ideas
on which Unesco's action and its very
existence are based, it is in no way
merely to record for history the fact
significant as it isl that a Church
now resolutely open to the world and
an intergovernmental institution which
is becoming increasingly aware of the
spiritual dimension of its intellectual
and practical undertaking have come
together in the service of man.
It is, firstly, in order to be able
to give the Sovereign Pontiff a clear
assurance that his ideas will meet
with particular understanding within
Unesco. It is also, and perhaps above
all, to convey to him my conviction
that Unesco, at its own level, and
without departing from its own princi¬
ples and methods, will spontaneously
answer his appeal with action . . .
For myself, though I cannot pre¬
judge what that action will be, I will
say that I share the anguish of the
appeal and endorse its fervour.
Yes, I believe that "the hour for
action has now sounded" and that "at
stake are the peace of the world and
the future of civilization". It is my
ardent desire that the peoples should
feel this, and governments understand
it, while there is still time.
So far as governments are con¬
cerned, would it be too much to
express the hope which I can do only
in my personal capacity that in the
near future a conference of the world's
responsible leaders may be held at
the highest level to consider the
problems of development, not separ¬
ately, sector by sector, as is usually
done, but as a whole, with a view to
finding radical overall solutions ?
I mean a conference which would
reorganize the relations between the
wealthy nations and the poor nations,
like the conferences held after great
world conflicts to reorganize the rela¬
tions between the powers, but one
more deserving than were those set¬
tlements and partitions, of the fair
name of Peace Conference, since the
object would be to forestall violence
by justice, not to repair its effects by
force after the catastrophe.
Such a conference would have to
deal, among other things, with the

question of trade relations between
industrialized countries and under¬
developed countries, the present ine¬
quity of which the Holy Father has so
rightly emphasized. It could also take
steps and no doubt would quite
naturally be led to do so to strengthen
very considerably, if necessary by
rationalizing it, the system of inter¬
national organizations which can play
a decisive part in the building of a more
just and more fraternal world order.
Of course, any intergovernmental
action of this kind is possible only
If every citizen, every person feels
personally concerned by development
and takes it upon himself as a uni¬
versal task. In the developed
countries particularly, it would be a
good thing for all those holding posi¬
tions of responsibility to have had
personal experience of the nature and
methods of development, and indeed
of service in its cause. The conver¬
sion of every individual to that work
of universal salvation, development, is
the great spiritual mutation which is
essential for mankind today.
Development, as I have said, is a
state of mind. It is above all a matter
of conscience. It was very necessary
to remind the world of this.
