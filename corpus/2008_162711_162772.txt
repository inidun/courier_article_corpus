There was a time when if you 
spoke about savages everyone 
had a fairly clear idea what you 
were talking about. Etymologi-
cally, the savage was a man of 
the forest, and the term denoted 
those people who lived in close 
contact with nature. The German 
naturvölker (nature folk) conveyed 
this idea directly. 
But apart from the fact that all 
savages do not necessarily live in 
forests (think of the Eskimos), the 
word soon took on a figurative 
meaning which quickly became 
derogatory. Then too, the idea of 
living in close contact with nature 
is ambiguous; farmers live in much 
closer proximity with nature than 
city dwellers yet both belong to 
the same civilization. 
Scientists came to realize that 
you could not classify the people 
of the world according to how 
close or how far removed they 
were from nature. In fact what 
distinguishes mankind from the 
animals is that man, with his uni-
versal use of language, his fabri-
cated implements and tools, and 
his submission to customs, creeds 
and institutions, belongs to a 
higher order than any living thing 
in nature. The world of man is a 
world of culture that is rigorously 
and unequivocally opposed to 
nature whatever the level of civi-
What common 
denominator?
First of all, we can discount the 
factor of numbers, which is the 
size of the society. Of course, size 
does have meaning from the 
global point of view, for societies 
comprising several million mem-
bers appear only rarely in the his-
tory of mankind and are found 
only in a few great civilizations. 
Moreover, these civilizations 
appeared at different historical 
epochs and in regions as far apart 
as the East and Far East, Europe, 
Central and South America. Yet 
below this level there are diffe-
rences so great that the factor of 
numbers or size can have    … 
lization. Every human being talks, 
makes implements and behaves 
according to set rules whether he 
lives in a skyscraper or in a that-
ched hut in the middle of the 
forest. And it is this that makes 
him a human being, not the parti-
cular materials he builds his house 
out of. 
Modern anthropology prefers 
therefore to use the word primi-
tive to designate the people who 
used to be called savage. There 
are an enormous number of primi-
tive societies – several thousands 
according to a recent estimate. 
But trouble starts when an effort 
is made to describe the characte-
ristics of such societies.
“PrimitiveS”?
The term implies the idea of a beginning. It refers to people who live as they did at the dawn 
of human history? A tempting hypothesis, but one that leads to serious misunderstandings, 
says Lévi-Strauss, explaining in this May 1954 Courier article why the notion of primitive 
society is an illusion.

life that goes back to the begin-
nings of human society? This is an 
attractive hypothesis and it is 
valid within certain limits. But it 
is also liable to cause serious 
confusion. 
First, we know absolutely 
nothing about mankind’s actual 
beginnings. The earliest 
traces we have discove-
red – arms and imple-
ments in chipped stone 
some thousands of cen-
turies old – are certainly 
not the very first pro-
ducts of the human brain. 
They already reveal com-
plicated technical skills 
which must have develo-
ped little by little. And 
above all, these techni-
ques are found to be the 
same over vast stretches 
of the earth’s surface 
implying therefore that 
they had time to spread, to 
influence one another, and to 
become homogeneous. 
In the second place, the peo-
ples whom we call primitive are 
all- or nearly all- familiar with at 
least some of the arts and techni-
ques that appeared extremely late 
in the development of the civili-
zation. Although the oldest chip-
ped stone implements may date 
from 400,000 or 500,000 years 
ago, agriculture, stock rising, 
weaving and pottery appeared 
only about ten thousand years 
ago, perhaps less. Thus the “pri-
mitiveness” of peoples who culti-
vate gardens, breed pigs, weave 
loincloths and make cooking-pots 
is quite relative in the time span 
of the total duration of human 
 history. …
western Europeans scarcely chan-
ged from the  beginning of historic 
times until the invention of the 
steam-engine; there was no fun-
damental difference between the 
life of a patrician in Imperial 
Rome and that of a well-to-do 
Frenchman, Englishman or Dutch-
man of the 18th century. 
Moreover, neither Rome in the 
second centur y  B.C .  nor 
Amsterdam about 1750 is compa-
rable with a Melanesian village of 
today or with Timbuktu in the 
middle of the 19th century. 
Civilizations which preceded the 
birth of our industrial civilization 
should not be confused with 
those which existed outside it, 
and would probably have remai-
ned outside for a very long time 
if industrialization had not been 
imposed upon them. 
The fact is that when we speak 
of primitive peoples, we have the 
factor of history (or time) in mind. 
The very word primitive implies 
the idea of a beginning. Then can 
we say that primitive peoples are 
those which have retained or pre-
served to the present day a way of 
… no absolute value. Some 
African kingdoms included several 
hundred thousand members, 
 Oceanian tribes several thousand, 
but in the same regions of the 
world we find societies made up 
of a few hundred persons or even 
at times of only a few dozen. 
In addit ion, such 
peoples (for instance, 
the Eskimos and some 
Australians tribes) are 
often organized in an 
extraordinarily flexible 
way: a group is able to 
expand on festive occa-
sions or during certain 
periods of the year, so 
as to include several 
thousand persons, while 
at other seasons it splits 
up into small self-suffi-
cient bands of a few 
families, or even of 
single families. Obviously 
if a society consisting of 40 mem-
bers and another of 40,000 can 
both be called primitive for the 
same reasons, the numerical 
factor alone doesn’t provide an 
explanation.
Cultures existing 
outside industrial 
civilization
We may perhaps be on firmer 
ground if we consider another fea-
ture, undeniably present in every 
culture we call primitive: each of 
them is, or was at least until very 
recently, outside the range of 
industrial civilization. But here 
again, the yardstick will not work. 
Consider the case of Western 
Europe. It has often be stated, 
and rightly, that the way of life in

their immobilization and 
isolation in the same 
place from the most dis-
tant times, have in fact 
been in contact for thou-
sands of years with all 
k inds of much more 
highly developed popula-
tions. Far from these 
alleged primitives having 
no history, it is their his-
tory that explains the 
very special conditions in 
which they have been 
found. 
For it would be absurd 
to think that, because we 
know nothing or almost 
nothing of their past, 
primitive peoples have 
no history. Their remo-
test ancestors appeared on the 
earth at the same time as our 
own. For tens and even hundreds 
of thousands of years, other socie-
ties preceded theirs and throu-
ghout that time lived, endured 
and therefore changed as ours 
did. They knew wars, migra-
tions, periods of want and 
prosperity. They had great 
men who left their stamp on 
technical knowledge, on art, 
morals and religion. All this 
past exists; only they know 
little about it and we know 
nothing. 
The latent presence and 
pressure of a past that has 
disappeared are enough to 
show the falsity of the word 
primitive, and even of the 
idea of a primitive people. 
But at the same time we 
must take note of a feature 
which all societies have in 
common and which    … 
A change of environment to an 
area which lacks good quality clay 
often explains the disappearance 
of pottery sometimes even from 
human memory. Language often 
proves that peoples, whose low 
level of civilization might suggest 
… But we can ask 
another question: after 
all, do not at least some 
of these peoples conti-
nue to follow a way of 
life much older than 
ours, much more like 
that of man in the ear-
liest ages? At once, 
some examples come to 
mind: the aborigines of 
Australia or of South 
America. They lead a 
nomadic life in semi-
arid regions, live by 
hunting, and by picking 
and gathering from the 
earth what food they 
can. They are ignorant 
of weaving or pottery, 
and until quite recently 
used stone implements. 
The natives of Australia had no 
knowledge even of the bow and 
arrow, while those of Tierra del 
Fuego had only a very rudimentary 
type.
People without 
history?
Nevertheless, the progress 
of ethnological knowledge 
provides the explanation. 
It has shown that is these 
cases and in all the others 
that could be mentioned; 
the apparently primitive 
state is not the result of 
any miraculous preserva-
tion of an ancient mode 
of life, it is the effect of 
regression. The Austra-
lians can only have rea-
ched their continent by 
boat, so they must at 
some time have known the 
art of navigation, and 
since forgotten it.

Therefore I cannot too 
strongly warn that rea-
ders – and even scientists 
themse lve s-  shou ld 
beware of ambiguous 
terms like savage, primi-
tive or archaic. By taking 
the presence or absence 
of some form of writing 
as the sole criterion in 
our study of our socie-
ties, we shall, in the first 
place, be invoking an 
objective quality which 
implies no philosophic or 
moral postulate. And at 
the same time we shall 
be relying on the only feature 
capable of explaining the real dif-
ference that distinguishes certain 
societies from our own. 
The idea of a primitive society 
is a delusion. On the other hand 
the idea of a society with no form 
of writing makes us aware of an 
essential side of mankind’s deve-
lopment; it explains the history 
and enables us to foresee and 
perhaps influence the future of 
these peoples. 
… distinguishes them 
from ours. It is the reason for 
applying to them all the same 
term, however inappropriate 
it may be.
Primitive – a 
misleading term
All these societies –from the 
powerful empire of the Incas, 
which succeeded in organi-
zing several million men into 
a politico-economic system 
of exceptional eff iciency, 
down to the small nomadic 
bands of plant-gatherers in 
Australia– are comparable in at 
least one respect: they knew or 
still know nothing of writing. 
They could preserve nothing of 
their past save what human 
memory was able to retain. This 
remains true, even for the small 
number who have, for lack of wri-
ting, developed some systems of 
mnemonics (such as the Peruvian 
knotted strings or the graphic 
 symbols of Easter Island and of 
certain African tribes). Although 
these societies are not, strictly 
speaking, more “primitive” than 
ours, their past is of a different 
kind. It could not be a past pre-
served in writing and thus availa-
ble at any moment to be used for 
present advantage. 
It was a fluid past which could 
be preserved only in small quan-
tities, and the remainder, as it 
came into existence, was condem-
ned to be forgotten with no hope 
of recovery. 
To borrow a simile from the 
language of navigation, societies 
with some form of writing have a

means of logging their course and 
therefore of keeping on the same 
track for a long period. On the 
other hand, societies without 
some form of writing are reduced 
to following an unsteady course, 
which may in the end (although 
the distance covered in the same 
in both cases) bring them back 
very near to their starting point. 
Or at least it deprived them of the 
means of systematically drawing 
away from it, that is to say, of 
making progress.
