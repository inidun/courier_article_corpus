“B uen camino!”—“Have a good journe
For centuries, hundreds of thousands of
p i l grims from Denmark, the Netherlands,
Italy, France and Portugal,have used this Spanish
phrase to greet each other as they trek along one of
the nine pilgri m s ’ routes to Santiago de Compostela
in northeastern Spain.
In 1999, o f ficials reckon nine million touri s t s
will visit the city, where tradition says St Ja m e s
(Santiago in Spanish),one of Christ’s 12 apostles,
is bu ri e d . Some 150,000 of them will have offic i a l l y
qualified as pilgrims by cove ring in a spirit of
c o n t e m p l ation at least 100 kilometres of the journ e y
on foot or horseback or 150 kilometres by bicycle.
The rest will have come by plane, train, buses or
cars,drawn by a $30-million programme in which
about a thousand events are being staged with fun-
ding from national, regional and local authorities.
Light and sound displays,exhibitions and classical
and modern dance performances will make sure
that the last Holy Year of the millennium will be a
memorable cultural occasion in Santiago de Com-
postela.
A second golden age
According to a custom which began in the
Middle A g e s , w h e n e ver July 25, St Ja m e s ’s feast
d ay, falls on a Sunday, the Pope grants a full pardon
to all Catholics who enter the cathedral through
the Holy Door, which is open only in such years,
and then do penance and receive the Eucharist.
Holy years, of which there have been 177 since
1428,provide an ideal opportunity to promote the
city as a tourist and cultural centre.The last fifteen

years or so have been a second golden age for the
p i l grimage to Santiago (the first was in the 11th
and 12th centuri e s ) , which continues to draw
crowds,whether for spiritual or cultural reasons.
In 1991, the Galician authorities launched an
ambitious programme to boost regional touri s m ,
focusing on Santiago and the pilgri m s ’ way. T h e
Spanish gove rnment and the eight prov i n c e s
through which the Way passes spent a lot of money
marking out the route, p r e s e rving its historical fea-
t u r e s , refurbishing hotels for pilgrims and bu i l d i n g
f o o t p aths for the pilgrims to use instead of the
roads.
P ri vate sector invo l vement was encouraged and
a mascot for the Way was created,named Pelegrín.
N ational and intern ational publicity campaigns
were launched, mostly through travelling exhibi-
tions including one called “In the Footsteps of
James”, which started out from Buenos Aires last
October 1 and by December 1999 will have visited
Mexico City, Munich,São Paulo, New York,Brus-
s e l s ,L o n d o n , Santiago de Chile, D u b l i n , Pa ri s ,To u-
louse and Bordeaux.
There is plenty of “ r aw mat e ri a l ” of cours e .T h e
old centre of Santiago de Compostela and its
baroque, neoclassical granite buildings have been
placed on UNESCO’sWorld Heritage List,and so
has the pilgri m s ’ way itself. In 1987, the Council of
Europe classified the entire complex of pilgri m s ’
routes to Compostela as a major “European cultu-
ral itinerary”,describing it as “a repository of col-
l e c t i ve memory crossed by paths which defy dis-
tance, frontiers and incomprehension.”
And while maintaining its local atmosphere and
i m p r e s s i ve group of monuments centred on the
c at h e d r a l , the city has also tried to retain the pat t e rn
of urban development which in 1998 won it the
European Urban and Regional Planning Awa r d ,
the European Commission’s highest distinction in
this field granted every four years. The jury com-
mended the radical steps that have been taken to
halt the deteri o r ation of the old quarter and the
successful integration of new buildings and infra-
structures.
“The old city is now untouchable,” s ays Cri s t ó-
bal Ramírez, head of the Jo u rn a l i s t s ’A s s o c i ation of
the Road to Santiago. “Subsidies have enabled a
range of architectural work to be carried out to
maintain 17th- and 18th-century façades and stru c-
tures as well as the interi o rs of houses and other
bu i l d i n g s.To d ay, e ven if they only want to change a
t a p, ow n e rs have only four or five models to choose
from.”
With more than a dozen cultural events a day,
including round-table discussions, c o n f e r e n c e s ,
s h ow s , lectures and concert s , Santiago is decked
out in all its fin e ry. B e t ween now and the end of
the ye a r , its streets, restaurants and more than
8,000 hotel rooms will be filled with pilgri m s ,b a c k-
packers and other visitors. Then, just before mid-
night on December 31, the Holy Door of the cat h e-
dral will again be sealed with cement and bri c k s
until the next “holy year”,2004.
But the celebrations will not end with the cen-
t u ry, because Santiago has been designated by
European ministers of culture as one of the nine
“cultural capitals of Europe” for the year 2000,
along with Avignon (France), Bergen (Norway ) ,
Bologna (Italy), B russels (Belgi u m ) , C r a c ow
( Po l a n d ) , Helsinki (Finland), Prague (Czech Repu-
blic) and Reykjavik (Iceland).
Stones can’t talk, but Galicia is a land of
legends. On the Portal of Glory, the Romanesque
façade of Santiago’s cathedral,there is a carving of
the Prophet Daniel which features what is reckoned
to be the first smile in Romanesque art. From his
pedestal, Daniel seems to be looking down at the
t o u rists and—he too—wishing them “ B u e n
camino!”. n

want to change a tap,
o w n e rs have only four or five 
models to choose fro m ’
