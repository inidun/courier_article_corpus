"When the garden is full of
fruit, it's time to bottle some
for the winter," says Jacques Lecornu,
managing director of the International
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD).
"In the same way, dams retain water
reserves for use in the dry season."
Floods claim some 100,000 vic¬
tims per year, and according to
ICOLD's 1995 Position Paper on
Dams and Environment, flood con¬
trol "has always been a particularly
significant motive for dam construc¬
tion." Dams also "mitigate droughts,
adjust natural runoff with its sea¬
sonal variations and climatic irresu-

larities to meet the pattern of
demand for irrigated agriculture,
power generation, domestic and
industrial supply and navigation.
They provide recreation, attract
tourism, promote aquaculture and
fisheries, and can enhance environ¬
mental conditions." Swiss engineer
Nicholas Schnitter, author ofA His¬
tory ofDams (1994), adds that they
also protect estuaries against the
ravages of flood tides.
This positive view is increasingly
being questioned, however, by envi¬
ronmentalists and scientists who
advance strong arguments in support
of their case. Concern was expressed
as early as 1973 at an ICOLD con¬
gress in Madrid in the following
terms: "The real problem to be
solved is the question whether dams
are useful or detrimental, whether
they improve our environment as a
whole and man's well-being or
whether they spoil it, and appreci¬
ating in each case whether they
should be built and according to
what characteristics".
Past and present
The first dam for which there is reli¬
able evidence was built in Jordan
5,000 years ago to supply the city of
Jawa with drinking water. Around
1800 B. C, during the reign of the
Pharaoh Amenemhet III, the Egyp¬
tians constructed a reservoir with
the amazing storage capacity of 275
million m'i in Al Fayyum Valley,
some 90 km southwest of Cairo.
Known as Lake Moeris (today Lake
Qarun), it was used for 3,600 years.
According to Jacques Lecornu,
more than half of ICOLD's nearly
40,000 registered large dams
(higher than 15 metres) have been
built in the last 35 years.
Dams can be divided into two
broad categories according to their
use: those designed to regulate river
flow in the interests of navigability,
and those which confine and check
the flow ofwater for a variety of other
needs. Each type has a specific
design. Most water storage dams
(83%) are embankment (earth fill)
dams, a less costly technique than
masonry. The materials used may he
rock (Egypt's Aswan High Dam), earth
(the Nurek dam in Tajikistan) or a
mixture. There are various types of
concrete or masonry dams: gravity-
dams consisting of a massive triangu¬
lar wall (the Grande-Dixence dam,
Switzerland), arch dams built in a
convex arch facing the reservoir (Zim¬
babwe's Kariba dam), and buttress
dams (e.g. the Alcantara II dam in

Spain). More than 52% of the world's
dams are located in China, 16% in
the United States, and 6% in Japan.
Costly savings
Reservoir-dams are mainly used for
irrigation and drinking-water sup¬
ply. Although waterfalls have been
used for centuries to generate
energy, hydroelectric production has
increased over the past thirty years
and now meets about 20% of world
electricity demand (hut only 7% of
global energy demand). By econo¬
mizing on coal and oil, hydroelectric-
ity limits the air pollution caused by
fossil fuel combustion. Hydroelectric
power could be developed to great
advantage if only it were not so often
associated with dams that have dire
consequences on the environment,
especially in dry ecosystems.
The effects that dams can have
on the environment are described in
Freshwater Resources, a booklet
produced by UNESCO and the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP). They include changes in
the ecosystem, loss of agricultural
land, the spread of water-related
diseases (especially bilharzia and
malaria), regulation of river flow,
change in water quality and sedi¬
ment regime, flood risks, changed
conditions for fisheries, agriculture,
transport and other economic activ¬
ities, population displacements, loss
of recreational areas and increases
in the area's seismic potential
because of the reservoir's weight.
There may also be effects on climate
as well as the disappearance of some¬
times rare plant- and wildlife that
originally lived in the flooded areas.
These social and environmental
impacts assumed considerable pro¬
portions in the 1970s, when it
became impossible to ignore the fate
of the populations that were

affected by dam construction and
in some cases summarily displaced
without compensation.
According to the World Bank,
the construction of 50 dams has
uprooted about 830,000 people,
only half of whom were resettled in
a satisfactory manner. The Kiambere
hydroelectric project in Kenya, for
example, has supplied 30% of
Kenya's energy needs since 1990,
resulting in fuel oil savings of $25
million. When dam construction
began it was estimated that 1,778
people would be affected, but even¬
tually 7,500 people were displaced
or dispossessed, receiving financial
compensation which many spent on
marriages or debt repayment, hut
which was too small for them to buy
land equivalent to their original hold¬
ings. Resettlement reduced them to
poverty. Lubuge hydroelectric plant
in China supplies 21% of the energy
demand of Yunnan province, yet the
2,320 people displaced were satis¬
factorily resettled under a plan that
offered them a choice between con¬
tinuing to farm on new land irrigated
under the project or being retrained
for new jobs. The project brought
resettled families access to drink¬
ing water, electricity and communi¬
cation facilities.
Side effects
The World Bank has adopted guide¬
lines for integrating social and envi¬
ronmental concerns into analysis of
dam construction projects and avoid¬
ing or mitigating adverse conse¬
quences. ICOLD is producing publi¬
cations and organizing symposia to
highlight lessons learned from the
past and to present technology for the
future. But we are still paying the
price today for structures built in the
past by engineers who did not fore¬
see all the consequences of their work.
Monique Mainguet, Professor of
Geography at the University of
Rheims (France), recently published
a book, L'homme et la sécheresse
(Man and Drought, 1995), in which
she assesses the impact of the Sélin-
gué dam, built in 1981 on one of the
major tributaries of the Niger,
upstream of Bamako (Mali). The dam
deprived farmers ofnatural seasonal
flooding that irrigated 100,000
hectares of land and made it possible
to grow rice, and the fishing indus¬
try collapsed three years later. She
reports that two other dams in west
Africa, the Diama dam on the Sene¬
gal River and the Manantali dam on
the Bafing River (a tributary of the
Senegal), are not living up to expec¬
tations. Diama is not preventing sea
water from moving 200 km upriver
in the dry season. The Manantali "is
responsible for the destruction of
10,000 hectares of woodland; it is
accelerating erosion and sanding up of

the valley and holding hack fertile
silt from the delta".
The Aswan High Dam in Egypt
is fulfilling its initial purpose (regu¬
lation of flooding and the produc¬
tion of hydroelectricity), but it too
has drawbacks. Its 500-kiIometre-
long artificial lake receives some 100
million tonnes of fertile silt that used
to be carried and deposited by the
Nile (luring its annual flood. "This
silt was once used to manufacture
bricks and natural fertilizers that
now have to be replaced by costly
artificial materials and chemical fer¬
tilizers." Without the protective
layer that the silt forms on sandy
soil, the land is eroded by the wind.
What's more, the reservoir loses
more than 10 billion m3 of water
annually to evaporation, and a lot of
water percolates down into the sub¬
soil, resulting in increased ground¬
water salination in a richly evaporite
soil. But the dam has enabled Egypt
to cope with the large-scale
droughts that have struck the Sahel
in recent decades.
Big but not beautiful
In 1918 Sun Yat-sen, father of the
Chinese Republic, had the idea of
building the Three Gorges dam on
the Yangtze Jiang River in Hubei
province in central China. Over 75
years later, the first stone of what
will eventually be the world's largest
dam was laid in 1994. Although it
promises to supply 10% of the coun¬
try's electricity and regulate river
levels for nearly 300 kilometres, the
dam is a controversial project. For
thousands of years poets and
painters have sung the rare beauty of
its chosen site. Its 175-metre-high
concrete wall will create a lake
between 500 and 650 kilometres
long that will drown a magnificent
landscape, completely or partially

submerging a dozen towns. About
1.5 million people will have to be
resettled. There are also risks of
massive pollution and silting up due
to the reduction in water flow sed¬
iment and effluent carried by the
Blue River will accumulate in the
lake. According to some estimates,
the total cost of the project could
well reach $32 billion. UiMiSCO and
UNEP have asked whether Three
Gorges dam should he built.
The estimated cost of the Bakun
dam project in Sarawak (Malaysia)
is in the region of $6 billion. Located
in the mountains on the island of Bor¬
neo, it will submerge some 70 to
80,000 hectares of tropical forest
and uproot around 10,000 people.
Preliminary work has already begun,
despite vigorous protests from local
environmental organizations. But
Malaysia is a member of the Inter¬
national Commission on Large Dams,
and is sticking to the terms of the
Commission's Position Paper, which
states that "Attention to the social
and environmental aspects of dams
and reservoirs must be a dominating
concern pervading all our activities in
the same way as the concern for
safety. We aim to balance the need
for the development of water
resources with the conservation of
the environment in a way which will
not compromise future generations."
Despite their controversial
aspects and increasing reservations
in scientific and financial circles,
large-scale projects are still popular.
Since 1986 the World Bank has
approved 39 dam projects and lent
$7.4 billion (3% of total World Bank
lending in the past ten years) to build
them. Wouldn't it be better to chan¬
nel the enormous investments they
require into more numerous smaller
projects that would be more accept¬
able to local people and the environ¬
ment? According to Jacques Lecornu
between 1 ,200 and 1 ,400 such dams
are begun every year.
