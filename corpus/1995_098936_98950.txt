MADANJEET SINGH
is an Indian art historian, writer,
painter and photographer. A
former ambassador, he is
currently a special advisor to the
Director-General of Unesco. He is
the author of many books, and
compiled and presented a
collective work entitled The Sun,
Eternal Flame of Creation,
published in 1993 in several
language versions (Unesco,
Paris; Harry N. Abrams, Inc.,
New York; Thames & Hudson,
London, for the English edition).
After their emergence as tool-
making hominids about one-and-
a-half million years ago during the
Old Stone Age, our prehistoric
ancestors instinctively related the
sun to all-embracing nature stones,
mountains, trees, plants, flowers,
birds, beasts, water and fire. Living
in caves or beneath overhanging
rocks, they used wooden sticks and
unpolished chipped stones for
hunting wild beasts, and depicted
hunting scenes and solar symbols
in rock carvings. Such petroglyphs
have been discovered in central Asia,
Africa, Europe and in other parts
of the world as far distant as
Indonesia and southwest America.
They show the sun in a variety of
forms, either as rays emanating from
a circle or anthropomorphically, as
a nimbus surrounding a head.

spiral patterns are thought to have
led to the earliest forms of hiero¬
glyphic writing, the invention of the
wheel, and the universally popular
spiral design, as well as to the image
of the halo as a sign of spiritual lumi¬
nosity. In time almost all elements of
nature became deities and totems of
sun cults and were represented in
human or animal forms, forming
the basis of organized religions that
invoked the sun as the divine light of
virtue. "Sûrya is the ultimate truth,"
states Aditya-Hrydya Sutra, and this
is beautifully depicted in an Indian
miniature painting, Heart ofSûrya,
in which Vishnu and his consort
Lakshmi are seated in the sun, much
like the beautiful figure of Mani
(216-274 A.D.), the founder of
Manichaeism, in the still-used
temple of Cao'an on the eastern
coast of China near Quanzhou in
Fujian province. In the Samyutta
Nikaya, the Buddha calls the sun
"the fiery heart, my kith and kin",
and this concept is also incorpo¬
rated in Christian art, as can be seen
in Fra Angelico's painting Corona¬
tion ofthe Virgin, now in the Uffizi
(Florence).

the sun as an emblem oflife, truth,

divinity with solar associations inspired a major religious
movement, Mithraism, in the Roman Empire between the
1st and 3rd centuries A.D.

Prophets
Prophets such as Zoroaster (late sev¬
enth and early sixth centuries B.C.)
and Mani invoked the sun's divine
light of virtue to conquer the dark¬
ness of evil. The sun god Mithra
became the charioteer of Ahura
Mazda, the Zoroastrian Creator
God of Light, who is opposed by
the evil darkness of Angra Mainyu
or Ahriman. Ahura Mazda is "like
the sun to behold for the sun is
the greatest of all visible, earthly
fires", stated Zoroaster (c. 628-551
B.C.). Even today in several eastern
Iranian languages the word for the
sun is simply "of Ahura Mazda".
Manichaeism was truly an ecu¬
menical faith embracing all people,
as Mani, its founder, tried to inte¬
grate diverse religions such as
Gnostic Christianity, Zoroastri-
anism and Buddhism, in a strongly
dualistic philosophy based on the
eternal struggle between good and
evil, light and darkness. It was once
professed by many peoples, from
Spain in the west to the eastern coast
of China.
Parsees, whose name is derived from
Parsa or Persian, are Indian followers of
Mazdaism (Zoroastrianism) who live in the
Bombay area. They have temples in which
the sacred fire is kept burning perpetually.

Great conquerors and rulers
employed the spirit of solar univer¬
sality in order to ensure the loyalty of
their subjects. Confronted with
antagonistic sects which engendered
social tension, ethnic hatred and reli¬
gious animosity, they tried to create
stable government based on norms of
unity symbolized by the sun.
Akhenaton (c. 1353 B.C.) sought
to unite his people under the all-
embracing light emanating from the
sun-disc, the Aton. Alexander the
Great (356-323 B.C.) aspired to rule
the world "like the sun", especially
after his conquest of Egypt, when
he chose to become the "son of the
Sun-God Amon". The Mauryan
emperors in India were inspired to
emulate the example set by
Alexander's brief incursion into India
in 326 B.C., which helped to revive
the ancient sun-related Vedic con¬
cepts. Chandragupta Maurya (c. 321-
297 B.C.) cast himself in the "sun-
guardian" image of Universal
Emperor, and Ashoka (d. 238 B.C.?),

ryan Dynasty, erected numerous pil¬
lars inscribed with sun motifs. The
Roman emperor Aurelian (215-275
A.D.) sought similarly to bring diver¬
gent sects and tribal minorities in his
empire under the aegis of the Uncon¬
querable Sun (Sol Invictus). The
"Divine Sun" was at the centre of
the syncretic Din-i-Ilahi cult, around
which the Mughal emperor Akbar
(1542-1605) tried to rally the diverse
peoples of his vast Indian empire.
Louis XIV (1638-1715), the "Sun
King" of France, glorified the myth
of Apollo, and often appeared
dressed as this sun deity at the lavish
feasts he organized in the vast gardens
of his great palace of Versailles. A
sculpture of Apollo stands in the
grotto of Thetis at Versailles, and
elsewhere in the gardens a figure of
the sun in a chariot is said to represent
the king.

Mountains

Kukulcán, today

Castillo, at

(Post-classical
period, 950-1500
A.D.)
The mountain often became the
"heavenly ladder" needed to reach
heaven where the sun god and other
solar deities supposedly lived. In
Egypt the notion of "the ladder of
Horus" (the sky-god) reaching to
the sun-door, the crossing point
from mortality to immortality,
seems to have originated in very
early step pyramids. In Mexico the
Aztecs related the Teotihuacán pyra¬
mids to the sun and the moon.
Shamash, the sun god of the Semitic
pantheon, rose from the eastern
mountains and inaugurated the
practice of building elevated citadels
like the ziggurats to the Babylonian
moon-god Nanna. Pausanias, a
Greek traveller in the second cen¬
tury, relates how he saw sun altars of
worship on the highest acropolis at
Corinth. The mountain at Bojone-
goro in Java is venerated because
"the sun comes out of it", and in Sri
Lanka, Saman "the deity of the
morning sun" is worshipped on
Samanolakanda Mountain, also
called Adam's Peak. The Chinese
Emperor Wu-di of the Han Dynasty
(140-87 B.C.) frequented the Cheng
mountain at the eastern end of the
Shandong peninsula in order to
worship the sun rising from the sea.
The mountain deity of ancient
Japan, Yama-no-kami, is wor¬
shipped as "the sun of forests and
animals".

Birds flying in the sky naturally
became identified with the sun. In
central Asia this tradition goes back
to the Old Stone Age, and is notably
exemplified by the petroglyph of a
strange bird depicted, with other sun
symbols, in the Shakty cave in the
Pamir mountains. The mythical fire¬
bird of Russian folklore was
endowed with extraordinary powers:
"even one of its feathers could flood
the whole world with the sunlight
of happiness". In ancient Egypt, a
fabulous bird known as the bennu, a
kind of heron, was traditionally asso¬
ciated with sun worship as a symbol
of the rising sun and of life after
death. It was also known as the
phoenix, and its image appears on
the coinage of the late Roman Empire
as the symbol of the Eternal City.
The Chinese name for it is pheng or
ch'i-lin, and in Islamic mythology it
is called rukh oranqà (Persian
sîmorgh). Garuda is its counterpart in
India and southeast Asia.
The depiction of the sun in
animal form results largely from
ancient beliefs in which birds, ani¬
mals, reptiles and fish were assigned
special significance. Perhaps the ear¬
liest known representation of a bird
is the eagle/falcon image on the
palette of King Narmer from Hier-
akonpolis (c. 3,000 B.C.), symbol¬
izing the sun god Horus.

Art styles throughout history have
also been inspired by the sun, from
the Amarna sculptures in ancient
Egypt to the Impressionist art forms
of modern times. With his emphasis
upon maat, or truth, Akhenaton
created the first-ever "realistic"
artistic style, ordering artists and
craftsmen to depict faithfully what
they actually saw rather than follow
tradition-bound canons glorifying
the Pharaoh's personality.
During Akbar's time a distinctly
Indian style of painting was inspired
by his "solar vision". It is charac¬
terized by a vivid treatment of the
physical world which can be seen
in the celebrated manuscript which
Akbar ordered his artists to prepare
of Hamza-nama (c. 1567), the story
of the deeds of a legendary adven¬
turer who lived during the reign of
Harun ar-Rashid.
The shining spirit of the sun also
inspired Japanese painting. The
imperial edicts of the seventh and
eighth centuries which formed the
basis ofJapanese political, legal and
ethical values refer repeatedly to
"the sun's bright, pure, honest and
sincere heart," and these virtues
were also incorporated into the
realm of aesthetics, so that purity,
directness and brightness became
the essence of Japanese art and lit¬
erature. The pervasive influence of
the sun in Japanese culture is evi¬
dent in haiku poetry, calligraphy
and ink-drawn scrolls, as well as in
the tea ceremony, flower arrange¬
ment and garden design.
"The Triumphal Procession of the White
Horse", an episode from the legend of
Akbar, Mughal emperor of India (1556-
1605), is depicted in this 16th-century
Indian miniature.

Below, the Roman town of Bram in the
southwest of France was built in the 4th
century A.D. according to a "solar" plan.
In the field of architecture, it is
amazing how the simple sun motif
in the shape of a small circular
opening in the roof of a nomadic
yurt developed into as grand and
marvellous a structural source of
illumination as that seen in the dome
of the Pantheon in Rome and its
rotunda. Apparently the Roman
baths and similar structures built to



serve as tombs for pagan emperors
were also "glorified yurts". It was
not until the fourth century that a
Christian meaning was given to
light-oriented architecture in the
baptisteries and funerary chapels
attached to basilicas. The manner
of orienting pagan shrines towards
the sunrise was also adopted by
Christian churches, built with the
altar located at the east end or more
accurately in the direction where
the sun rose on the feast day of their
patron saint.
The sun inspired the circular
urban plan which encircles the cen¬
tral shrines in many medieval towns
in Europe, one notable example
being the Roman town of Bram in
France (founded in 333 A.D.). These
towns recall the ancient Zoroastrian
townships in Central Asia, which
were conceived either on a circular
design or in the shape of a crossed
circle.

Pageants andfestivals
Most pageants and festivals around
the world can be traced back either
directly to the sun or indirectly to it
through agricultural and fertility
rites. Processions involving animal
and reptile solar symbols in many
Asian, African and native American
societies also have equivalents in
Europe. The once-popular giants'
carnivals in Douai and Dunkirk in
France and Antwerp in Belgium,
actually originated in sacrificial rit¬
uals of ancient solar cults, in which
huge osier frames of greenery were
carried much like the Jack-in-the-
green-basket-clad figures in Eng¬
lish May Day parades (which are
essentially fertility celebrations).
Christians in Wales adopted another
pagan ritual of fertility and concep¬
tion in which the link between the
sun and water was invoked by
"walking-sun-wise" around a holy
well three times.


Music

production of The
Magic Flute.
Sarastro, the high
priest of the sun,

Solar Circle.
The flute and drum are among the
most ancient musical instruments.
The flute, as a phallic symbol, is uni¬
versally identified with the male,
while the drum represents the
female's womb. Together they sym¬
bolize the sun and hence fecundity,
happy life, and rebirth. The flute
and drum are in most cultures the
principal accompaniment to sun-
dances, which are generally per¬
formed with four dancers repre¬
senting the four quarters of the
universe. The flute's cosmic signifi¬
cance is also evident in Mozart's
opera The Magic Flute, in which
two "realms" are separated by light
and darkness, and there is a struggle
to possess the powerful Sevenfold
Solar Circle the sun.
