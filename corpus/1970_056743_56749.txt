The rising spiral
of
unemployment
28
IN many, If not most of the
developing countries, unemployment is
turning into a major social problem
and obstacle to development. The
failure to create meaningful employ¬
ment is the most Iragic failure of
development. All Indications are that
unemployment and under-utilization of
human resources have Increased in
the 1960s, and that the problem will
grow even more serious with the rapid
growth of population.
Although there is much evidence of
the appalling magnitude of the unem¬
ployment problem, there is little speci¬
fic information about it. The Interna¬
tional Labour Organization is trying to
muster the resources for a large
employment survey in the developing
countries, and this deserves all
support.
A great difficulty, especially in tra¬
ditional societies, is that there Is no
hard and fast distinction between
unemployment and underemployment.
Underemployment describes a sit¬
uation in which individual capacity
to work is not fully engaged, as when
highly trained personnel are forced to
work at menial labour for lack of
demand, or when agriculture does not
begin to absorb the labour available.
Although there are no firm estimates
of underemployment, it is clear that
recorded unemployment in the de¬
veloping countries understates the
problem.
Both unemployment and underem¬
ployment are results of the failure to
absorb the large increase of the lab¬
our force which has followed the
acceleration of population growth.
Population policies can greatly affect
this problem but only in the long term.
Those who will constitute the labour
force over the next fifteen years are
already born.
It is not impossible for employment
to grow fast, but It requires a high
degree of dynamism and flexibility,
energetic entrepreneurship, and en¬
couragement of rapid change. In the
nonfarming sectors of low-Income
countries, one of the reasons why
extensive development efforts have
failed to create adequate employment
opportunities has undoubtedly been
the overstimulation of capital-intensive
and labour-saving technology by arti¬
ficial distortion of factor prices.
Such technology is readily available
in the industrialized countries, and
there has been a tendency for aid-
giving agencies and foreign contractors
to transfer it without modification.
Although In many cases the adoption
of such technology is -unavoidable or
even desirable to preserve competi¬
tive efficiency, present policies often
make capital-intensive methods ap¬
pear too attractive. Concessional in¬
terest rates, overvalued exchange
rates, and differenciated tariffs reduce
the private cost of Imported capital
equipment, while market wage rates
overstate the real cost of labour.
Increasing capacity to absorb lab¬
our also requires that wage rates are
not raised so high as to discourage the
use of labour and encourage the use
of capital-intensive and labour-saving
methods of production.
But in many developing countries the
inequality of income distribution is an
inducement to employment policies
which are determined by political con¬
siderations and which make the cost
of labour very high. Such policies may
also have the consequence of attrac¬
ting labour from the rural sector to
the towns where even occasional em¬
ployment may be more remunerative
than full-time agricultural work.
The main burden of absorbing the
increase in the labour force falls in¬
evitably on agriculture which, in most
of the developing countries, occupies
some 60 to 80 per cent of that force.
Only a fraction of the new workers can
find employment in non-agricultural
sectors even If these expand with
great rapidity.
A strategy for agricultural devel¬
opment which Increases employment
opportunities rapidly without depres¬
sing incomes must focus on lab¬
our-using and capital-saving ways of
Improving agricultural productivity.
Much pessimism has been voiced
about the possibility of significant
change in this direction.
A,i N encouraging aspect of
agricultural development In the last
few years, however, Is that the major
increases in yields resulting from the
new varieties and intensified irrigation
are not dependent on large-scale
substitution of capital for labour.
Nevertheless, there ¡s a danger that
as agricultural income rises, well-to-do
farmers will prefer to invest in agri¬
cultural machinery rather than to em¬
ploy large numbers of people, espe¬
cially if government policy stimulates
premature mechanization. It seems
particularly important that the mistakes
of industrial policy in this regard are
not repeated In the design of agricul¬
tural development strategy.
The urgency of the unemployment
problem requires positive policies and
programmes to reduce unemployment
and underemployment. In many areas

The increasing flow of migrants from
countryside to city, a constant trend
in the developing world, adds to
the already acute problem of
unemployment (photos right). Urban
growth is almost universally twice
as rapid as the growth of the population
in general. If present trends
continued, cities such as Calcutta
(India) would have over 35 million
Inhabitants by the year 2000.

In probably no other
area of social
improvement have
greater victories been
won In the past 20 years
than that of public
health. Most of the
developing world has
recorded gains In life
expectancy which
took a century to
achieve in the
industrialized countries.
The scourge of malaria,
for example, has been
eliminated in vast
areas, thus increasing
capacity to work and
opening up territories
for new cultivation.

UNEMPLOYMENT (Continued)
more unskilled labour could be used
to meet many urgent needs. Housing,
construction of schools and health
facilities, rural markets, secondary
roads, irrigation facilities are all exam¬
ples. While this requires a massive
administrative effort and also a great
amount of money, it would create ad¬
ditional incomes which generate ad¬
ditional demand.
Unhappily, even where the adminis¬
trative capacity exists to undertake
labour-intensive programmes on a
massive scale, countries are restrain¬
ed from doing so by fear of their in¬
flationary impact and by shortage of
foreign exchange. Foreign aid and
sensible fiscal policy can mitigate
these problems if the former is pro¬
vided on suitable terms.
Progress must be made in solving
the unemployment problem if social
and political turmoil is not to arrest
the development process. For it is
in the volatile cities of the developing
world that agricultural stagnation and
industrial unemployment combine to
produce their gravest consequences.
Urban growth is almost universally
twice as rapid as the growth of the
population in general, and some of the
largest cities have even higher rates
of expansion. Rural stagnation stimu¬
lates a flow of migrants from the land,
and urban death rates are often lower
than those in the countryside while
fertility generally remains high.
It must be asked whether urban
trends can be left to be the by-product
of other forces in society. If present
trends continued, the largest city in
India would have over 35 million
inhabitants by the year 2000.
Planning strategy in developing
countries must emphasize the growth
of small and intermediate regional
centres, to offer market, service and
storage facilities, and light labour-in¬
tensive industries processing local
materials. The construction of such
new centres could offer a consider¬
able measure of employment for un¬
skilled labour.
