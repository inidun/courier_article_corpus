DIFFERENT PRIORITIES
A typica ! example is to be found
in Culture and Agriculture, a
remarkable document puhlished
by the secretariat of UNESCO's
Worid Décade for Cultural Devei-
opment :"When project officers
se'impIe ment a co
fa project in Nopal a
years ago, they wanted to do the
right thing,"writes Vicki L.
Wilde."They went directly to the
villagers and asked what kind of
trees they wanted to plant.'Hard-
wood trees'was the answer, so the
project provided 3, 000 harowood
seedlings-and ail 3, 000 seedIings
subsequently died from lack of
care. Why ? Because the project
officers... consulted only the
male villagers, who were only
interested in wood for furniture-
making and carving that could
earn them cash. But, by tradition,
it was the women who planted and
watered tree seedlings."
The women were not interested
in slow-growing trees. As they
spent six hours a day coUecting
fuel and fodder, they would have
preferred fast-growing species to
ease their burden.
Another graphic example of
the relation between gender and
development cornes from southern
India, where women used to earn
their living n tea planta-
tions. When technology
was introduced into tea produc-
tion, it was the men who were
taught how to use it and they took
over the women's jobs. It was soon
noticed that the chiidren in the
area were beginning to suffer from
increased malnutrition. The reason
was that women had lost their
source of income, and in house-
holds in this part of India it was
they who were responsible for
earning the money to buy food ;
the men spent their money in
other ways.
The Food and Agriculture
more than half the earth's
copulation are women.
Although they account for
two-thirds of all the hours worked
in the world, women receive only a
tenth of the total earnings. Two-
thirds of them suffer from the
handicap ofiHiteracy. UNESCO has
always sought to remedy the
inequalities of which women are
victims, and action to improve
women's status is a common
denominator of programmes in aIl
its fields of competence.
But while there is no signifi-
cant difference in status
between, for example, male and
female astronauts trained in the
industrialized countries, the sit-
uation is quite different in
regions where women still bear
so} e responsibility for family
care, work in the fields and main-
taining water supplies. As Sabine
Estier wrote in Le Journal de
Genève of 5 June 1995 :"Con-
trary to a widespread assump-
tion, women do not naturally ben-
efit from overall development. In
countries where they are less

Organization of the United
Nations concluded in 1989 that
only 5 peI'cent of agricultural
extension resources worldwide
were directed at female farmers.
That state of affairs was largely
due to three mistaken assump-
tions on the part of many develop-
ment planners : that men and
women benefit equally from eco-
nomic growth ; that if yod rais
men's income you improve the wel-
fare of the whole family ; and that
poverty and wealth are distrib-
uted equally within a household.
WHO DOES WHAT ?
"The division of responsibilities is
very much a part of the culture of
a country,"Wilde goes on,"but it
can also vary greatly from village
to village depending on tradition,
social customs, the economics, the
environmental situation and the
degree of development."She cites
two examples from the moun-
tainous Khao Kho region ofnorth-
eastern Thailand. Among the
Hmong people, women are their
husbands'property and handle
household chores. Men are in total
control. Among the Thais, farther
down the mountain, men and
women share most tasks, even
housework.
Yet another situation was
found in a community in the
United Republic of Tanzania
where, according to a survey car-
ried out by the World Health
Organization (WHO), 60 per cent
of the children aged between one
and seven suffered from trachoma
(contagious conjunctivitis which
can tead to blindness), while a fur-
ther 10 per cent had severe eye
disease. As transmission of the dis-
ease is curbed by improved
hygiene, mothers were advised to
wash their children's faces, which
they did not normally do. A whole
series of problems resulted from
that straightforward piece of
advice. Women, who are in charge
of fetching water and its use in the
household, attempted to justify
their reluctance to wash their
children's faces by saying there
was not enough water. In fact they
had plenty, as a we ! I had been
sunk not far off. They also alleged
they did not have enough time.
Yet they refused to allow anyone
else to go and fetch the household
water in their place, even though
it would have made their hard
work in the fields (ten hours a day)
easier to bear.
The difficulty of changing this
behaviour pattern can be more
easily understood if it is seen in
the context of a patriarchal
society where women cannot

and of pOOl'quality. ln a study of
water scarcity in the région, B.
Rao has shown how this too is con-
nected with the structure of
society. Deep wells were sunk hy

A HEAVY ENERGY BILL
Satisfying daily energy needs is a
massive hurden on women in devel-
oping countries."ln low-income
countries such as Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia and Nepal, the house-
hold sector accounts for more than
90 per cent of total energy con-
sumption,"says E. Cecelski in a
WHO document entitled Women,
Health and Environment."Use of
tree, crop and animal residues for
fuel deprives the soil of recycled
nutrients and reduces crop yields
along with the land's capacity to
support livestock."

Four hundred million tonnes
of animal residues are burned in
this way in Asia and Africa every
year, causing a 20-million-tonne
shortfall in cereal production. In
ordér to obtain the same harvest
as before, women therefore have
to cultivate larger fields and work
even harder.
Ail these examples show that
the Action 21 programme drawn
up at the 1992 Rio Conference
still has a long way to go before
becoming effective. Responsi-
bility for the environment is still
not equaMy shared between men
and women. For this to happen,
it will be necessary"to put an
end to gender-based discrimina-
tion and allow women access to
the land and other resources, as
well as to education and secure
employment under conditions of
equality."Women should be pro-
vided with access to decent
housing, to a freety chosen
spacing of births and to health
care, and should no longer have to
suffer the horrors of war.
At the present time they mostly
have to go against the wishes of the
men in their family and the tradi-
tions of their community in order
to win their rights. But greater
access to resources can guarantee
liberation and social progress. The
increasing number of international
conferences devoted to women's
issues should help to change their
image and increase their powers.
After ail, in the symbolic tradition
of many civilizations, woman is not
only the Earth that gives birth to
living creatures and vegetation, but
also water, that seed of seeds on
which ail growth dépends. M
