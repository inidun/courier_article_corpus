THE 'MÁNDALA'
SANCTUARY
OF BODHNATH
Aerial photo at left shows the
great Buddhist stupa of Bodhnath near
Kathmandu, much frequented by
Tibetan pilgrims. The stupa's form is
that of the mándala, the geometric
diagram combining circles and squares
which in Tantric Buddhism symbolizes
the universe and the spiritual forces.
Mándala motifs can also be seen in
photo, opposite page, of scene in
temple courtyard in Patan during the
festival of Machendranath, the god
of Abundance, where women have
set out ritual offerings. Below,
prayer wheels line the outer wall
of the base of the stupa of
Swayambhunath. In turning prayer
wheels, Buddhists follow the example
of the Buddha who, in his first
preachings at Sarnath, began
"to turn the wheel of doctrine".

I he Buddhist sanctuary of Bodh¬
nath, to the east of Kathmandu,
should first be viewed from the air.
Only from this vantage point does
its form of a mándala, or mystic
symbol of the universe, stand out
with striking clarity. One first
distinguishes a triple circle forming
the outer corona of the monument:
the houses of Tibetan pilgrims, the
circular street, and the first wall
surrounding the stupa, around which
the faithful walk ritually to the left.
The triple circle symbolizes the
wheel of reincarnations, the endless
cycle of life and death, the temporal
world, constantly beset by unrest,
from all of which Buddhist teaching
seeks to free us.
The Infinite and Eternal, constant
and immutable, is represented by
the monument itself, the stupa
with the "all-seeing eyes of Sup¬
reme Buddhahood" gazing from it.
All around it, hollowed within the
outer wall, is an immense niche
containing prayer-wheels, worn and
dented from use by generations
of pilgrims. Behind them, deco¬
rating the rear of the niche, is
a frieze of blue and orange Buddhas
whose colours are renewed on the
occasion of each pilgrimage.
Within the enclosure, five terraces
serve as the pedestal of the stupa
itself, representing the five elements
(ether, air, earth, fire, water) and
the five directions (The Zenith,
East, South, West, North). Symbol
of the immutable celestial world, the
dome nevertheless does sometimes
change in colour. When I saw it
first, shortly after it had been struck
by lightning, it was dingy and
greyish with piles of blackened
wood at its base. But at the time of
pilgrimages it is whitewashed all
over and then covered with saffron
offered by the pilgrims.
The spectacle of this ochre-col¬
oured dome, blending perfectly
with the gilded bell-tower of the
stupa during these festive occasions,
is enhanced by myriads of prayer-
banners rising towards the summit
of the monument and to the sky.
These fluttering streamers, brought
as offerings by the pilgrims, are
inscribed with the texts of Tibetan
prayers. There are white ones
representing clouds, others as blue
as the sky, green representing water,
yellow symbolizing the earth, and
red ones the colour of fire.
