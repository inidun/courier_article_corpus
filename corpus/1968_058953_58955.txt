THE POPPY
OF SLOW DEATH
The majority of the world's opium
poppies, like this crop being
harvested in Laos, are grown in
Asia. Since opium is legally
cultivated in many countries for
medicinal purposes, the illicit growth
of the poppy is extremely difficult
to track down. The world's legitimate
needs in opium are estimated at
800 tons a year, whereas some
2,000 tons are actually harvested.
Thus 1,200 tons are diverted to
illicit use in the international
traffic in opium.

CCORDING to legend,
the opium poppy was born on the
very spot where Buddha's eyelids fell
when he cut them off to prevent sleep
from overtaking him. But the pharma¬
cological properties of the poppy and
its product, opium, were certainly
known long before then.
MARCEL GRANIER-DOYEUX is vice-pre¬
sident of the International Narcotics Control
Board and a member of the World Health
Organization consultative group on depen¬
dence-producing drugs. Professor Granier-
Doyeux is head of the Department of Phar¬
macology and Toxology at the Central Uni¬
versity of Venezuela, in Caracas, president
of the Venezuelan National Academy of
Medicine, and a member of the Pan-Amer¬
ican Academy of the History of Medicine.
Sumerian tablets (3-4,000 B.C.)
mention the poppy. Assyrians, Egyp¬
tians and Greeks have left us written
evidence of the use of opium in
bygone ages.
According to another legend, which
Homer recounts in his Odyssey, the
beautiful Helen,, wife of Menelaus,
offered to Telemachus a philter called
"nepenthes" "a potion to lull pain
and bring forgetfulness of sorrow."
But it was Hesiod (8th Century B.C.)
who left the first written mention of
the poppy in indicating the existence
near Corinth, Greece, of the town of
Mekone (town of the poppy).
The Greek historian Herodotus
spoke of the therapeutic use of opium
as did Hippocrates, the wise doctor
of Cos. From Aristotle to Virgil and
Pliny the Elder, numerous authors of
Greek and Roman antiquity mention
both the poppy and opium in their
writings.
Certain historians claim that Avi-
cenna, the great Arab philosopher and
doctor, died from opium intoxication
in 1037 in Persia. In a book published
in 1946 {Opium, Vigot Frères, Paris),
Ihno J. Bensussan suggests that
opium was probably introduced to
India in the 8th Century, after the
Arab invasion in the province of Sind.
But two Greek specialists, P.G. Kri- _
tikos and S.P. Papadaki, declared D
more recently (U.N. Bulletin on Nar- *»
cotics, Nos. 3 and 4, 1967) that the

already have been introduced to India
twelve centuries earlier by the armies
of Alexander the Great. If we study
the first references to the cultivation
of the opium poppy in India, we find
that it is situated in the 15th Century,
as mentioned in the records of the
reign of the Mogul Emperor Akbar
the Great.
One of the first medicinal prepara¬
tions with an opium base is believed
to have been laudanum paracelsi,
prescribed In the 16th century by the
Swiss Doctor Paracelse; but the pre¬
sence of opium in this medicine has
been contested. Thomas Sydenham,
the well known English doctor of the
17th century, invented a special pre¬
paration of opium and gave his name
to a new laudanum.
However, it was not until the begin-
ing of the 19th century that the first
opium alkaloid morphine was disco¬
vered and isolated, and this discovery
is sometimes attributed to the German
pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner and
sometimes to the French chemist
Armand Seguin.
While the medicinal virtues of
opium have been recognized almost
since time immemorial, when no other
means were known for calming phys¬
ical pain, its improper use in later
years turned it into a veritable poison.
It is difficult, to say precisely when
the habit of opium smoking first
appeared, but some believe it dates
from the end of the 17th century.
The practice seems to have been
introduced in China from two direc¬
tions from Java and Formosa in the
East, and from India in the West.
The first "Opium War" (1839-42)
which brought Great Britain and China
into conflict as the result of the Chi¬
nese Government's decision to forbid
the importation of opium, can well be
considered as the beginning of the
spread of opium addiction in that
country, which soon took on tremen¬
dous proportions.
Imperial China sank into a kind of
lethargy. Drug addicts could be
counted in millions and their number
increased continuously until 1906. In
that year, an Imperial edict was
issued forbidding, progressively, the
growth of the poppy and the use of
opium.
Three years later an International
Opium Commission met in Shanghai
and was attended by representatives
from 13 countries. This was the first
serious international move to deal
with the harmful effects of opium.
Like an epidemic, opium addiction
was spreading its harmful effects over
a large part of Asia, particularly among
the most underprivileged peoples,
and it was gaining the West.
Opium can be drunk or eaten but
it is generally smoked. Opium smok¬
ing is a fairly complicated operation
which takes a lot of preparation and
equipment. Generally the pipe is
made of a bamboo stem with a clay

THE OPIUM POPPY
IN ANTIQUITY
Recent research by two Greek scientists,
P.G. Kritikos and S.P. Papadaki, has
shown that the opium poppy was known
and widely used as a decoration in the
Ancient World. It figures on many objects
such as statues, brooches, pendants, coins
and utensils, unearthed in the Eastern Med¬
iterranean (Ancient Greece, Egypt, Rome,
etc). Poppy capsules (above) are repro¬
duced as a decoration (left) to adorn the
hair of a Minoan goddess a figurine made
some 13 centuries B.C. Right, a small

metric period (700 B.C.), with a base

bowl. The smoker lies down. With
a needle, he takes from a box of
opium a little lump of chandu which
is a specially prepared opium extract.
The chandu is then dried over the
flame of a lamp and rubbed between
thumb and index finger into a ball
which is then placed in the bowl.
The pipe is ready. The smoker lights
it and slowly inhales the smoke.
But poor smokers cannot afford
refined chandu. They use the left¬
overs of rich smokers, the dross,
which contains highly toxic substan¬
ces. And the very poor are reduced
to the dross of dross!
Prolonged use of opium will lead
the smoker to the final stage of stu¬
por, severe loss of weight and even
death. The capacity for work is
greatly reduced among heavy smokers
and their physical condition deterio¬
rates rapidly.
To satisfy their craving, poor smo¬
kers spend a large part of their wages
on the drug and deprive themselves
of everything else. As they become
utterly impoverished they find the
drug is their only consolation, and
the vicious circle is complete.
Intoxication by sub-cutaneous or
intravenous injection of the natural
alkaloid derivatives of opium (princi¬
pally morphine and codeine) is by
far the most serious form of chronic
intoxication.
Heroin, a semi-synthetic derivative
of morphine, is an even more dan¬
gerous substance than the natural
extracts of opium. It can be inhaled,
smoked or taken as an injection. A
particularly toxic mixture is that of
heroin and cocaine, known as a
"speedball", whose use was once
common in America.
The synthesis of a number of anal¬
gesics which substitute for morphine,
complicates still further the problem
of drug addiction and the fight against
drugs which, by their repeated use,
produce "dependence". These new
drugs are usually injected, but some
produce their effect when simply
swallowed.
"Some people think", states a
report of the United Nations Commis¬
sion on Narcotic Drugs, "that a per¬
son is free to poison himself if he
wishes to and that any effort by
society to prevent the addict from
taking his drugs is an infringement
on individual liberty. This, or course,
is an indefensible concept in a
modern society, in which an addict
not only destroys himself but is likely
to harm others in the process."
The coca leaf
and cocaine
The coca leaf is associated with
an ancient legend which comes from
the Cordillera of the Andes. Khunu,
God of thunder, lightning and snow,
angered by the Yunga chiefs who
allowed their people to burn the
forests, resolved to punish them. The
smoke from the fire had blackened
his palaces, the lllimani and the Muru-
rata two high snow capped moun¬
tains in Bolivia. He decided to isolate
them from the capital built on the
shores of the Sacred Lake (Lake Titi¬
caca, on the border between Peru
and Bolivia).
Thus out off from all communication
with the mallcos (supreme chiefs) and
from their main sources of food, the
Yungas were forced to lead a nomadic
existence and suffered from thirst and
hunger. It was then that they disco¬
vered the coca leaf. Chewing the
leaves gave them renewed strength,
diminished fatigue and enabled them
to reach Tiahuanaco without suffering
from mountain sickness.
Studies made by Dr. Medrano (of
Cochabamba, Bolivia) seem to prove
that coca originated in the region of
Machu Yunga, in the former High Peru
(now Bolivia). According to a theory
which has been accepted by many
authors, the Arawaks learned the use
of coca from their conquerors, the
Chibchas.
After their migration across the
Andes, they spread the custom of
chewing coca leaves in regions which
are today Peru and Bolivia. In the
course of their migrations, the Chib¬
chas, Aymarás and Quetchuas are
thought to have propagated the grow¬
ing of the coca leaf, and this later
spread to Central America, the West
Indies and the Northern part of South
America.
m ix
T,HE Inca, Mayta-Capac
(1230 AD), and one of his successors,
Rocca (who died in 1315) are very
probably responsible for spreading the
use of coca. Yahuar-Huacac (who
died in 1347) discovered in his
conquests, regions where the Indians
worshipped coca as a divinity. The
use of the coca leaf was widespread
among the Incas by the end of the
14th century.
In 1857, Karl von Scherzer brought
back from a trip to Peru some coca
leaves which were given to the
research laboratory run by the Ger¬
man chemist Friedrich Wohler and
analyzed by Albert Niemann, who iso¬
lated from them an alkaloid cocaine.
This natural product was the first local
anaesthetic used in medicine.
The coca leaf has had many defen¬
ders, but even more detractors. The
controversy still goes on. Carlos
Gutierrez Noriega of Lima and his
school have proved the harmful effect
of chewing coca leaves.
Cocaism, as the habit of chewing
coca leaves is called, is entirely dif¬
ferent from cocainism which is the
consumption of cocaine extracted

FROM OPIUM TO LSD (Continued)
The sacred mushrooms
visit the laboratory
from the leaf. Cocaine can be taken
by inhalation, or by sub-cutaneous
injection; some cocaine addicts inject
it into their veins, either pure or
mixed with heroin the "speedball"
referred to earlier. But cocaism is by
far the more widespread. It affects
a vast number of persons in the
Andean Cordillera.
The coquero or chewer of coca
leaves, does not really chew the
prepared "quid" (chique); to extract
the juice, he sucks it, moves it around
in his mouth and wedges it between
teeth and cheek. An inveterate coca
chewer can easily be recognized by
the deformed shape of his cheek
produced by this habit.
To extract the active ingredient of
the leaves by chewing, a strongly
alkaline substance must be added and
this is provided by quick-lime, the
ashes of quinua (an Andean cereal)
or a calcareous powder obtained from
crushed shells.

HE harmful effects of
chewing coca leaves have been clearly
established by the Commission of
Enquiry appointed by the United
Nations in 1949, and of which the
author of this article was a member.
Cocaine, the active constituent of
coca, causes well established changes
in the intellectual faculties of the
person who habitually chews the leaf
of this plant. Numerous studies and
particularly those of Gutierrez Norie¬
ga, have focused attention on the
serious difficulties which cocaism
creates for education.
Let me quote an example: "These
difficulties begin in the home; parents
who chew coca are not interested in
sending their children to school and
even force them to. acquire the habit
of this drug. The majority of the
teachers in rural schools in Cuzco
and Puno have told us that children
with the coca habit have a very limit¬
ed capacity for learning or are not
interested in being educated. They
add that such children are very shy,
introverted, lacking in will power, and
with little inclination to play..."
There is without doubt a connexion
between cocaism and illiteracy. A
statistical study shows that the per¬
centage of illiterates in different re¬
gions is closely related to the quan¬
tity of coca leaves consumed.
Moreover, even if it could be claim¬
ed that the coca leaf has nutritive
value, under no circumstances can it
be regarded as a substitute for a
proper diet. By deadening the feeling
of hunger, it creates a vicious circle
leading to a constant state of malnu¬
trition.
It has never been scientifically
proved that coca chewing is a useful
factor, still less a necessary one, in
acclimatization to life at high altitudes.
Nor is there any good reason for
supposing that cocaine acts in a
different way on persons living at
high altitudes or produces a different
effect upon them. Cocaism which
affects millions of human beings in
South America, is a habit which is
harmful to the individual who practi¬
ses it and, in many cases, to the
community.
The coca chewer has generally a
reduced output of work. He lacks the
ability to undertake a job which requi¬
res concentration and skill; he is
incapable of assuming responsibility;
more prone to accidents at work. If
one adds to this the damage done by
the leaf to the coca chewer's health
and that of his children, one can
easily see the harmful^ effects of coca
on the economy.
Cocaism is not an isolated pheno¬
menon. It is the result of a series
of unfavourable social, economic,
cultural and hygienic factors.
Any campaign against cocaism the
ancient vice of the New World has
to take into account the need to
improve social and economic condi¬
tions, to provide better and more
extensive education, to raise stan¬
dards of health, to improve nutrition
and working conditions, to provide
proper housing and to combat super¬
stitions and false beliefs. Finally,
there is need for an intensive educa¬
tional campaign to eradicate this inju¬
rious habit once and for all.
Some hallucinogenic drugs
The Huichol Indians from the Sierra
Madre in the West of Mexico, used
to set out on a pilgrimage every year
to collect a supply of the peyotl
cactus. They cut the head off and
dried the juicy rings in the sun. Once
dry, these slices of peyotl, also called
"mescal buds" were ready for use.
They played a very important part in
religious ceremonies.
Peyotl brought on hallucinations
which the Indians took for prophetic
visions. In the 16th Century, Fray
(Friar) Bernardino de Sahagun wrote:
"Those who eat it see things which
are frightening or laughable... This
plant gives them the strength and
courage to fight, by freeing them from
fear, thirst and hunger... It is even
believed that it protects them from
all danger..."
The particular nature of the halluci¬
nations produced by peyotl is due to
mescalin, its active constituent.
Since the 16th century, the sacred
mushrooms of Mexico and their intoxi¬
cating, narcotic effects have been
mentioned by many writers. The
Indians called them teonanacatl (flesh
of God). Eaten raw, they produce
strange hallucinatory effects, with
dreams often accompanied by hilarity,
excitement or torpor, fantastic visions
or a general feeling of well being.
Most of these hallucination-pro¬
ducing mushrooms of Mexico belong
to the psilocybe family. Prof. Roger
Heim of the Paris Museum of Natural
History, managed to grow them in a
laboratory and thus provided suffi¬
cient quantities of active substances
for analysis. This enabled Albert
Hofman, the Swiss chemist, to repro¬
duce these substances synthetically,
and notably the drug psilocybin which
is today used in psychotherapy.
Another mushroom, which grows in
many other countries, and has for
long been talked of, is gaining new
fame nowadays. This is ergot, a
fungus growth found on barley and
used by midwives in past centuries to
speed delivery. It was also the cause
of the many mass poisonings known
as "St. Anthony's Fire".
IN 1943, Albert Hofman,
who was studying the melting point
of a by-product of ergot, discovered a
strange substance. A new drug LSD
25 destined to cause a stir in the
world, was born.
Few drugs have sparked off as much
discussion and controversy or given
rise to so many misconceptions. There
is no definite proof of its therapeutic
value in medicine, whereas it does
represent a hazard to health. Those
who take it claim that it represents an
escape from the harsh reality of
everyday life, enabling them to take a
"trip," as they put it, thanks to its
"psychedelic" (consciousness-expand¬
ing) properties.
The United Nations Economic and
Social Council has recommended that
LSD be placed under special control
and that its use be restricted to
approved scientific and medical
research. Public concern has brought
the abuse of the hallucinogens (espe¬
cially LSD) in North America and
Europe to the forefront of interna¬
tional attention.
A special committee established by
the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs to study the problem of sub¬
stances not under international con¬
trol, singled out LSD "as presenting
the most acute problem and showing
signs of such spread as to demand
immediate action".
