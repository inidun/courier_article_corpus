I KNOW NO SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ULTIMATE POWERS OF
SOCIETY BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES ; AND IF WE THINK THEM
NOT ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO EXERCISE THEIR CONTROL WITH
A WHOLESOME DIRECTION. THE REMEDY IS NOT TO TAKE IT FROM
THEM, BUTTO INFORM THEIR DISCRETION THROUGH EDUCATION.
FROM A LETTER WRITTEN BY
THOMAS JEFFERSON IN 1820.
NEWSPAPERS LEAD A NATION-WIDE FIGHT
AGAINST ILLITERACY...
IN 1934, a newspaper in Guayaquil, Ecuador,"
Telegrafo", began to devote space in its columns
to weekly lessons suitable for teaching illite-
rates to read. From this small beginning has
grown a nation-wide campaign, started and backed
by the National Press Union (Union Nacional de
Periodistas) of Ecuador.
In this unique experiment-the only anti-illi-
teracy campaign Ãžrganized and directed by a group
of newspapers-the National Press Union has
used the organs of press and radio to give the
campaign wide publicity throughout the country.
"Co-operatn Committees"have been set up in
towns and villages, compo-
sed of representatives of
cultural associations, admi-
nistrative bodies, municipal
councils, workers'organiza-
tions and members of the
clergy. These have mobi-
lized teachers and private
individuals to help in the
campaign and have encou-
raged illiterates to join the
classes.
To support the scheme,
the Government of Ecuador
has issued two series of
stamps, each having a total
value of 500, 000 sucres
(about $30, 000).
The campaign organized
by the National Press
Union which began in 1942,
and another on a smaller
scale instituted by the Liga
de Ensenanza de Analfabe-
tes de Guayaquil the fol-
lowing year were originally
private enterprises.
Diploma
Of Citizenship
IN 1945, however, theGovernment passed a
law which aimed at making
every citizen of Ecuador
able to read and write. Just
how immense a task this
represents is indicated by
statistics published in 1944,
according to which 52 % of
Ecuador's population of
3, 400, 000 was illiterate at
that time.
The problem of illiteracy
is also complicated by the
fact that 27 % of the popu-
lation is Indian, most of
whom are illiterate and who
speak Quechua. A large
number have no knowledge
of Spanish.
For the Indians who have
a fair knowledge of Spanish,
the National Press Union
prepared"cartillas", or
elementary illustrated read-
ers, in this language. For
those knowing very little
Spanish, there is a"car-
tilla"with explanations in
Quechua, but the pupil is
taught to read and write in
Spanish.
Teachers are recruited
from among all sections of
the literate population, but
as it is impossible to pay
them any salary. a system
of bonuses is used, the
teacher in each campaign
area claiming the most
new-literates gaining a
prize of 1, 000 sucres ($ 60)
At the village of Chibuleo in the Province of Tungurahua, a
volunteer from one of the regional offices of the Ecuadorian
National Press Union explains to an Indian instructor how to
use the"cartilla", an elementary illustrated reader.
For the anti-illiteracy campaign
organized by the National Press
Union in Ecuador, teachers are re-
cruited from all sections of the po-
pulation. Here, Chief Gualavisi, of
the Indian village of Pingulmi, Pi-
chincha Province, teaches one 01
the village women to read.
times are arranged to meet
local conditions and work.
Factory workers, for exam-
ple, attend in the evenings
and waiters during the af-
ternoons. Each pupil is
given a pencil and a"car-
tilla"distributed by the
National Press Union.
Instruction is given on
two levels : pupils are first
taught reading, writing
and a little arithmetic, and
then after gaining their
"Citizen's Diploma", they
can join the second course
where they study texts on
history, geography, civics,
ethics, hygiene and feeding.
Unfortunately, this second
stage of the campaign has
been less successful than
the first. Many of the
pupils were not interested
in continuing the classes,
and there is also a lack of
teachers to give instruction
in the more specialised
subjects.
Despite the efforts al-
ready made, an enormous
task still awaits thy or-
ganization and individuals
carrying out the campaign.
One of the new and pro-
mising developments in the
work is the launching this
year by the Ecuador Go-
vernment of a mobile ser-
vice SARE (Service Ambu-
lante Rural Equatoriano).
This will carry the cam-
paign into those parts of
the country which are more
or less cut off from normal
means of communication.
and any teacher
with eight literate
pupils to his credit
qualifying for a
100 sucre bonus.
A"Diploma of
Patriotism"is also
awarded to tea-
chers and a"Citi-
zen's Diploma"to
every successful
candidate in the
examinations. This
"'Citizen's Diplo-
ma"is not merely
a certificate of
merit : it carries
with it the right of
the holder to fill a
public post, to vote
and to be elected
as a representative
of the people.
As the campaign
organisers declared
in a slogan publi-
cized all over the
country :"One less
illiterate means
one more citizen.

centres have been
set up in the
different provinces
since 1944. These
centres organise

are held in schools,
