The ve ry word “ h o s t i n g ” is ambiguous when
applied to immigr a n t s , so many and va ried are
the ways of devising, practising and approaching
the operation it purp o rts to descri b e . A ve ry wide
range of situations and behaviour exists in the space
between the formal opening of borders to foreigners
and offering them a warm welcome, between official
speeches and the attitude of the bu r e a u c r at at the
guichet, and between cultures and eras. How should
we cat e g o rize the different “host countri e s ” , in the
broadest sense of the term — t h at is, c o u n t ries that
receive immigrants?
The most obvious yardstick is numbers.This means
either the annual number of legal entries into a country
or the number of immigrants who have been there for
some time. By this cri t e ri o n , t wo countries stand out.
F i rst is the United States (720,000 entries in 1995,bu t
1.8 million in 1991, including 1.1 million whose stat u s
was regularized by a law passed in 1986). G e rm a ny
comes a close second (800,000 in 1995, 1.2 million in
1 9 9 1 ) , and easily leads the  European field where
i m m i gr ation is concern e d . Next comes a group of

c o u n t ries (Canada, Ja p a n , the United Kingdom,
F r a n c e , Australia and Israel), which take in an
average of between 100,000 and 200,000 legal
i m m i grants eve ry ye a r.
In terms of the number of resident aliens, t h e
United States is again top of the list,with 24.6 million
f o r e i g n e rs living in the country in 1996 (9.3% of the
total populat i o n ) , just ahead of India (8.6 million in
1 9 9 0 , or 1% of its populat i o n ) , Pakistan (7.2 million
or 6%) and Germ a ny (7.1 million, 8 . 8 % ) .
Another group is home to between two and four
million immigrants—Australia (3.7 million in 1991,
22.3% of its population), Canada (4.3 million in
1 9 9 1 ,1 6 . 1 % ) , France (3.6 million in 1990, 6 . 3 % ) ,
the United Kingdom (2 million in 1995, 3 . 4 % ) ,
Saudi Arabia (4 million, 25.7% in 1990), C ô t e
d ’ I voire (3.4 million, 29.7%) and Hong Kong (2.2
million,39.9%).
These percentages already show the wide
va ri ation in the proportion of foreigners to the local 
p o p u l at i o n . In some other countri e s , this proport i o n
is ve ry high.Top of the list are spars e l y - p o p u l at e d ,o i l -* University of Poitiers, France

rich countries where immigrants are actually in the
m a j o ri t y — Q atar (63.7%), Ku wait (71.6%) and the
United Arab Emirates (90.1% in 1990).The fig u r e s
for Saudi A r a b i a ,B a h r e i n ,O m a n ,B runei and Libya
ranged from 25% to 35% in 1990.
A second group of countries with a high
p r o p o rtion of immigrants consists of ve ry small
c o u n t ri e s , mainly Caribbean or Pa c i fic islands or
small states which often have some special stat u s ,
such as being a tax have n .They include Luxe m b o u r g
(37.8% foreigners ) , Macao (44.7%) and Monaco
( 6 7 % ) .
A third category comprises very large but still
s p a rsely populated “new countri e s ” , such as
Canada and Australia (16% to 22%). O t h e r
possible members of this cat e g o ry are the countri e s
of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
A fourth group is made up of We s t e rn industri a l
democracies where the proportion of immigrants
(much lower than generally supposed) is between
three and 10%.This includes most member states
of the European Union (those mentioned above
plus A u s t ria and Belgi u m : 9 % , and Sweden and
The Netherlands: 5 % ) . The United States could
also be added to this gr o u p. S w i t z e r l a n d , w i t h
18.9% in 1995, stands out here, but its geogr a p h i c a l
position, history and fiscal policy perhaps suggest
that it should belong to the second group.
The existence of a tradition of receiving
i m m i grants creates another set of cat e g o ri e s , w i t h
i m p o rtant implications for demogr a p hy (age
s t ru c t u r e ,f e rtility rat e ) ,a d m i n i s t r at i ve and legal stat u s
and economic, social and cultural integr at i o n .The list
includes countries with both long-established and
more recent pro-immigr ation policies, but also those
s t ates which have changed their policies in the past
few ye a rs.
In the developed wo r l d , only a few countri e s
have had pro-immigration policies for more than a
c e n t u ry now. They are Germ a ny, F r a n c e ,
Switzerland and the so-called “ n e w ” c o u n t ri e s
“ s e t t l e d ” by Europeans—countries such as
A u s t r a l i a , C a n a d a , New Zealand and the United
States.
But some countries in the South have we l l -
established pro-immigr ation policies too.
Merchants and workers from India have long been
received by the Sultanate of Oman, and people of
the Sahel by Côte d’Ivoire.For the last century or
more all Asian countries have taken in Chinese and
Indian immigr a n t s. On the other hand, there are
the new host countries which have in many cases
been surp rised and alarmed to find themselves a
magnet for immigration. Spain, Greece and Italy, as
well as the oil states of the Gulf, the Republic of Korea
and Thailand are undergoing this new experi e n c e ,
which partly explains why they find it hard to decide
where they stand on this issue.
“ O l d ” i m m i gr ation countries which are today
grappling with serious development problems have
virtually shut the door on immigrants. They include
B r a z i l , which has taken in several million from all ove r
the wo r l d , and A r g e n t i n a . Both of these countries eve n
b e c a m e , in the 1980s, notable sources of emigr ation to
the United States or Europe.
Why do countries receive immigrants? This is one
of the key questions which determines the attitude of
governments and one of the things dividing them—at
least in theory, since daily reality is much less clear
c u t . A d ve rtising immigr ation policies is not really a
g ove rnment pri o ri t y, and in the major immigr at i o n
countries the job of receiving immigrants takes many
different forms and involves complex and sometimes
contradictory alliances.
H owe ve r , three kinds of countries can be
identified—those which mainly see immigrants as an
extra or major source of labour, those which openly or
implicitly allow immigrants to stay permanently, and
those which take in immigrants for mainly
humanitarian reasons.
The first group is easily the biggest:South Africa,
the Gulf stat e s , G a b o n , the emerging economies of
Asia and Japan until the recent financial crisis and
most of We s t e rn Europe until the first oil cri s i s , i n
1973-75.
The second group contains the “ o l d ”i m m i gr at i o n
c o u n t ries listed earlier, plus Israel, for which the arri va l
of immigrants (in the sense understood by the Israelis)
or the return of people who had left is of the greatest
strategic importance. In this group, in contrast to the

first one,the place of immigrants in the society, their
legal status and their acquisition of nationality are
issues of central importance and have gi ven rise to
extensive legislation.
The countries acting for humanitarian reasons have
a greed to open their borders to large numbers of
refugees who have been forced to leave their ow n
c o u n t ry either by a natural disaster or more often
because of wa r. More than a million Mozambicans
caught up in a civil war and plagued with famine found
refuge in neighbouring Malaw i , one of the wo r l d ’s
poorest countri e s , b e t ween 1975 and 1992.There are
still five million Afghans in Pakistan and Iran. A n d
despite the present closing of most borders , m a ny
c o u n t ries have fulfilled this humanitarian role one way
or another at some time in their recent history.
A cold
reception
As for the yardstick of quality, the handling of
i m m i gr ation and treatment of immigrants are extremely
s e n s i t i ve mat t e rs.They can be measured against the
words of the Bible: “I was a stranger and you took me
i n .”These words ring in the moral conscience of many
c o u n t ries both North and South,but they do not seem
to be really understood and put into practice.Few stat e s ,
including some of the major receiving countri e s ,h ave
r at i fied the intern ational conventions dealing with the
t r e atment of immigr a n t s.
Without knowing the exact legal situation of
i m m i grants in eve ry country,we can still draw a rough
picture of how things are.A first group contains those
c o u n t ries which say openly that they we l c o m e
i m m i grants and back up this commitment with a
sizeable arr ay of laws and other measures to fa c i l i t at e
the long-term or permanent settlement of new arri va l s.
These are A u s t r a l i a , Canada and Swe d e n . In some
way s , Israel belongs to this group too, but it chooses
i m m i grants on a religious or cultural basis.
A second group consists of those countries which
in practice receive immigrants but where the reception
is tempered by frequent displays of mistrust or

d i s c ri m i n at i o n , especially towards the most recent
a rri va l s.This happens in most immigr ation countri e s
in the We s t .Their geographical position, and ve ry
often their colonial past, the attraction of their
economic and cultural vitality and the power of their
m e d i a , the quality of their social and educat i o n a l
systems—all these fa c t o rs draw to them the migr a n t s
of an increasingly nomadic and interconnected
p l a n e t .
But such a trend causes confusion and sparks
resistance by a section of society. Most countri e s
do not want to admit, much less adve rt i s e , t h e i r
openness to immigr at i o n , so in practice they find it
very difficult to come up with clear and coherent
policies where immigr ation and integr ation are
concerned.So their laws on the matter are wobbly
and sometimes contradictory.
Subject to the whims
of the authorities
A foreigner who arri ves legally often gets
gr e e t e d , in effect, with folded arm s. H owe ve r ,e ve n
though immigrants may not find themselves in the
El Dorado or paradise they dreamed of, they do
get some social and legal protection which enables
them to plan a future for themselves and their
c h i l d r e n . The situation of illegal immigrants is
much tougher however.
Immigrants in the main receiving countries of
the South (Afri c a , A s i a , the Caribbean and the
Gulf) experience even more precarious conditions.
Their status is uncert a i n , they are totally dependent
on their employers and are subject to the whims of
the authorities and the absence of legal recourse.
This often results in large-scale summary
d e p o rt ations of undocumented aliens.Those in this
third group are much more vulnerable because of
the economic crisis,especially in Africa and Asia.
This world ove rv i e w, inevitably a schematic one,
passes no judgment on the validity of this or that
country’s policies, each one of which may have its
own rationale and justific at i o n . But it shows the
ve ry wide va riety of situations immigrants fin d
themselves in and also the broad range of attitudes
of those receiving them.
As globalization of movement and trade
a d va n c e s , along with increasing links eve ry w h e r e
which fa c i l i t ate intern ational mobility, and with the
a rri val in a gr owing number of countries of new and
culturally different populat i o n s , the age-old question
of how to “ welcome the stranger”, which has so many
i m p l i c ations and such symbolic meaning, h a s
become more urgent than eve r. n
