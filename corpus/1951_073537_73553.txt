tt * ND what would you call your
mission in life ?" The
Hindu poet, surrounded by
a group of Paris students, showed
mild surprise."The same as all
artists", he replied gravely,"to civi-
lize the barbarians..."Then the poet
explained how in the course of his
travels through Europe and America
and across half the continent of Asia,
he had been dismayed by the expres-
sions of suspicion and anxiety on
men's faces wherever he went. He
had found nothing uplifting in the
books they chose to read nor the
theatres they visited. In fact, their
entertainment sources generally
seemed to represent the worst form
of escapism. Nor were their chil-
dren exempt. Brought up to make
heroes of bandits and fighting men,
their minds quickly became distorted
by fear and hate.
"These millions of savages", eon-
tinued the poet, learn
how to read, count and
write. Some can even
boast that their heads
are crammed with a mass
of knowledge. But to
me, civilization means
something different. It
means the creation of
beauty, but first there
must be the search for
beauty. Beauty must be
understood."He paused,
perhaps to give his next
words more weight."The
best way to civilize this
century, is to begin with
the children. What would
happen, for instance, if
we taught them all to
dance ?"
The following day the
students sought out the
Hindu poet again. He
began by telling them of
a school in Madras called
Kalakshetra,-temple of
beauty, consecrated to art.
The illustration was
apt. At first glance
Kalakshetra seems just
another. school offering
courses in the dance,
music, painting and sculp-
ture. But in actual fact,
Kalakshetra is less inte-
rested in producing pro-
fessionnals and artists than in pro-
ducing men and women whose
lives are rounded and complete,
whose entire personality, mental,
moral and physical, blends into a
harmonious whole.
It was an Indian dancer, Madame
Srimathi R u k m i n i Devi, who
founded Kalakshetra early in Jan-
uary 1936 ; an Indian dancer who
had devoted herself to a form of
the dance (natya) so-called in
honour of the Indian sage who codi-
fied this dance form. Madame Ruk-
mini Devi has explained its signifi-
cance in these terms :.. Bharata natyam simultaneously
educates and disciplines : the phy-
sical body by exercizing all its
members and calling out its vital
energies in its rhythmical breathing ;
the mental faculties from memory
to intelligence in understanding and
carrying out the pattern and order
of the many movements that make
up the rhythmic vocabulary of the
dance ; the emotions in expressing
those of the imagined characters of
the dance story and conveying them
to others, also the aesthetical happi-
ness in creating an expression of
beauty to which each dancer is an
essential contributor ; the aspiration-
OIl impulse, the feeling out towards
a larger and loftier life than that of
the senses and circumstances."
These words became the"credo"
of the school of Kalakshetra. Ma-
degrees, in every child, will uncons-
ciously solve most of the problems
that divert and delay humanity on
the way to progress."Therefore ; in
the different courses of instruction
open to the children at Kalakshetra
as much time and importance is
devoted to the arts as is given to
textbook and scientific training in
other schools. Yet though Kalak-
shetra calls on all the arts to play
their role in education and in the

spirit". Ram Gopa ! (above) is today considered one of the masters of the I ndian classical ballet.
dame Rukmini Devi sought to show
the underlying harmony uniting all
the arts ; their vital importance to
progress in its many individual,
national, religious and international
forms ; and at the same time, how
the dance could serve the cause of
peace through an understanding of
the art and culture of all peoples.
Kalakshetra soon became known as
'a conservatoire, an international
cultural centre and a school where
more than 600 children were educa-
ted by the most modern methods.
Highly esteemed by her own
countrymen, the founder of Kalak-
shetra has won the recognition of
educators throughout the world.
Madame Maria Montessori travelled
half-way around the globe to meet
her and for many years collaborated
with the Indian dancer in her work
at Madras.
Emotion, Truth, Beauty
t-y ALAKSHETRA's primary aim is to
"'-help every pupil give fullexpression to his artistic and
creative ability."It is my convic-
tion", says Madame Rukmini Devi,
"that the complete development of
the skill and judgment and taste
that are latent, though in varying
re-education of the emotions, great-
est emphasis is nonetheless placed
on music and dancing.
Many Western teachers too would
like to give more prominence to
dancing in their educational pro-
grammes. It is unfortunate, there-
fore, that folk dancing, figure dances
and the modern rhythmics lack the
powerful historical and religious
force of Bharata natyam with its
wealth of tradition dating back two
and three thousand years.
The gestures, rhythms and pos-
tures used in the Indian dance and
mime have their fixed symbolic
values which blend harmoniously
one into the other. The hands
alone employ a whole vocabulary of
signs (mudras) capable of expressing
or evoking the most imaginative
stories. Nowhere is this more fully
shown than in the sacrificial dance
where every type of rhythmic
expression is conveyed, from the
lift of an eyebrow to a curve of the
fingertips, from a twist of the neck
and shotilders to the smallest move-
ments of the feet. The purpose of
the dance at all times is to stir the
emotions, and if it is an"expres-
sion''dance, also to reveal sat yam,
shivam, sundaram-that is to say,
the true, the beautiful, and the good.
role. It is a pity that
Indian. music, with its
wide range of tone modul-
ations, is so little known
outside Asia. Purely me-.
lodic, this music is based
on natural intervals, each
octave being normally
divided into twenty-two
unequal intervals. A cer-
tain number of specially
chosen intervals form a
melodic phrase or raga,
of about seven notes.
Each melodic phrase
corresponds to a particu-
lar emotional mood or
impulse, or to a certain
time or season. There
are seven ragas for the
morning, and six for the
evening. If one adds to
this wealth of melodic
expression, the vast com-
plexity of different
rhythms, the possibilities
of this musical language
become inexhaustible.
Not only can it satisfy the
most finely attuned ear,
but also the listener's
desire for spiritual solace
as well.
There are undoubtedly
other musical systems-
particularly in the west-
ern world-which could
play as important a role in edu-
cation as the classical Indian
music of Kalakshetra. Drama and
the plastic arts, if not the dance,
could certainly be used to this end.
But as a first step, we must recognize
- as Madame Rukmini Devi has
done, and, before her time, the
ancient scholars of India and
China, Plato and Montaigne-that,
without the arts, there can be no
education in the true sense of the
word.
Admitting this, we can sympathize
with the mission of our poet among
the'barbarians'and understand the
work of the Indian dancer at Kalak-
shetra who recently summed up her
philosophy of the dance with this
sentence :"To bring the young to
appreciate beauty and therefore to
live it,"she has written,"is one of
our greatest tasks. With the rebirth
of culture will be born not only
great masterpieces of art for future
generations to admire, but master-
pieces of character, the birth into
the present day of great geniuses
who alone can lift the world from
the uncivilized to the civilized and
so will help the whole race to a
standard of life which, even at its
worst, can never be ugly, vulgar or
cruel.".
A people capable of creating and
maintaining such deep symbolic
values in the dance, were clearly
destined to make full use of
it as an educational medium as well.
For according to Hinduism, it was
the Shiva dance which created the
world and re-creates it from mo-
ment to moment.
Music, whose mysterious power is
increasingly recognized by psychi-
atrists, plays an equally important
