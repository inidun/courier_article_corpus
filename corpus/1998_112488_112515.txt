When the U. S .war correspondent Martha Gell-
h o rn visited the British V i r gin Islands in the
1 9 4 0 s , she came across a cove “where nothing
had changed since time began, a half circle of white
s a n d ,flanked by huge squarish smooth rocks .. .and the
water turquoise blue.”When she returned many ye a rs
l at e r , she found her cove “full of sun-tanned bodies
and ringed by boats . . . there were bottles and plastic
d e b ris on the sea-bed and picnic litter on the sand.”
To u rism has taken over the Cari b b e a n : in 1997
more than 14 million people took their holiday s
t h e r e , with some three million more dropping in
from cru i s e s. “ Tar balls” on beaches indicate that oil
t a n k e rs and other ships dump their oil and garbage
overboard (despite laws against such practice), w h i l e
pollution off Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico is
causing serious concern .
H owe ve r , it is the eve r - gr owing cru i s e - s h i p
i n d u s t ry which is a particular focus of concern for
the Caribbean Sea. The larger and newer cru i s e
ships have adopted a “ gr e e n e r ” a p p r o a c h , w i t h
m o d e rn waste-processing fa c i l i t i e s , according to the
Center for Marine Conservation Organization in
Wa s h i n g t o n . Yet a report by the Economist
Intelligence Unit concluded that “there is much evi-
dence that dumping of rubbish at sea does take
p l a c e .”
It is not just the seas that have been affected by
the demands of the tourist industry. Those fragi l e
ecosystems surrounding so many Caribbean islands,
the coral reefs, are under stress as we l l . In To b a g o,
t o u rists destroy exposed coral by walking on it in
plastic sandals; in the Bahamas souvenir shops loot
the reefs for stock, loading their shelves with shells,
dead coral and seahors e s ; in Granada, beach ve n-
d o rs sell earrings made out of rare black coral.
Belize has the second longest barrier reef in
the world and well-publicized conservation pro-
jects working to protect it. Yet its two mari n e
n ature reserves have shown signs of env i r o n m e n-
tal degr a d at i o n — a s s o c i ated with too many
people visiting a too fragile site.
In the Cayman Islands the local wat e rs p o rt s
a s s o c i ation has complained to the gove rn m e n t
about the damage done by cruise ships dropping
anchor on the reefs. G ove rnment scientists have
a c k n owledged that more than 300 acres of coral
reef have already been lost to cruise ship anchors
in the harbour at George Tow n , the capital of
Grand Cay m a n . Proposals to increase the num-
ber of cruise ship moorings continue to threat e n
the reefs. And by destroying the reefs, you des-
t r oy the tourist industry.
Short-term pro fit s
While cruise ships bring waste on to the land,
waste from the land is also dumped in the sea. A
1994 study by the Caribbean To u ri s m
O r g a n i s ation (CTO) showed that waste wat e r
t r e atment facilities in many hotels were of “ l i m i-
ted value with regard to the treatment of micro-
b i o l o gical and nutrient remova l ” .The report also
noted that 80-90 per cent of inadequately treat e d
s e wage was disposed of in coastal wat e rs , n e a r
h o t e l s , on beaches and around coral reefs and
m a n gr ove s.
Since then, there has been increasing awa r e-
ness among hotels and tourist boards of the env i-
ronmental costs to the tourist industry of irr e s-
ponsible policies. At least, in theory.The truth is
t h at although lip-service is paid to env i r o n m e n t a l
awa r e n e s s , there is little enforcement of the limi-
ted legi s l ation that does exist. Or as Calvin
H owe l l , the former head of the Cari b b e a n
C o n s e rvation A s s o c i at i o n , e x p l a i n e d : “The pro-
blem has been exacerbated by an attitude that
a p p r oves of short - t e rm rather than long-term
sustainable deve l o p m e n t .” The evidence for this
is that foreign deve l o p e rs are still moving in to
c r e ate resorts and golf courses on coastal lands.
The CTO has on many occasions appealed to
the region “as a matter of urgency ” to put toge-
ther an environmental plan. This has yet to hap-
p e n . Early in 1998, m a n a g e rs from Cari b b e a n
m a rine sanctuaries in more than twenty of the
r e gi o n ’s countries discussed ways of counteri n g
the threat to marine resources. Once again, c o -
o p e r ation was the theme.“ We need to look at the
C a ribbean as one system,” said Richard Curry of
the Biscayne National Park near Miami. B u t
another question remains: when will gove rn-
ments get the message? ■
