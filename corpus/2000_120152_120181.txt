Should the economic embargo
imposed on Iraq a decade ago be
numbered among the crimes that have
made the 20th century one of the darkest in
h i s t o ry? Can the intern ational community,
led by the United States and Bri t a i n , k e e p
on invoking the United Nations Charter to
prolong indefin i t e l y, and with impunity, t h e
s u f f e rings of a people? W hy does the media
make a fuss about some humanitarian dis-
a s t e rs and not about the dozens of Iraqi
children who die each day ?
William Bourdon,secretary-general of
the Intern ational Fe d e r ation of Human
Rights Leagues (FIDH), hints at an answe r

to the last question:“It would be easier to
mobilise public opinion behind this wo rt hy
cause if the Iraqi dictatorship was not one
of the world’s worst,” he says.
A recent resolution of the UN Human
Rights Commission, on 18 A p ril 2000,
“strongly condemns,” inter alia, “the sys-
tematic, widespread and extremely grave
v i o l ations of human ri g h t s ” in Iraq,
“resulting in an all-perva s i ve repression
and oppression.” It also condemns the
“ s u m m a ry and arbitrary exe c u t i o n s ,
including political killings,” and “ w i d e-
spread,systematic torture.”
The subject of the Iraqi embargo may be
a trap, just as the Iraqi people are trapped.
To talk about it might be to play into the
hands of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s
r e gi m e .To keep quiet might be tantamount
to failure to help a people in distress.
But the wall of silence is starting to
crack after reports from UN bodies that
the sanctions may have killed more than
half a million children under five , a n d

Concern is mounting about the suffering of the Iraqi people, and the ethics and legality of the
international sanctions weighing on them are being hotly debated

hunger and disease. The leading cause of
childhood deat h ,d i a rr h o e a , is 11 times more
p r e valent in Iraq than elsewhere—while polio
has been wiped out throughout the Mideast,
it has returned to plague Iraq’s people.
Schools and water systems—the infrastru c-

decrepit and hospitals lack basic medicine

exhausted their resources and their health

It will take Iraqi people a generation to

The toughest economic blockade in
recent times, voted by the UN Securi t y
Council in August 1990, four days after
Iraqi troops invaded Ku wa i t , o ri gi n a l l y
aimed to prevent Iraq rearming and to neu-
tralize its regi m e . F i ve ye a rs lat e r , on 14
A p ril 1995, the so-called “oil for food” r e s-
olution gave the Iraqi regime permission to
sell a limited amount of the country ’s oil and
to use 53 per cent of the proceeds1 to buy
f o o d , medicine and basic necessities.But the
sanctions committee, which has to approve
the purchases, can block some items
(ranging from lead pencils to chlorine to
vaccines) if it thinks they could be used to
make weapons of mass destru c t i o n .M e a n-
w h i l e , a UN special commission, UN S C O M,
was sent to Iraq to monitor the disarma-
ment process.
When the commission was disbanded at
the end of 1998, all of Iraq’s nuclear, c h e m-
ical and biological weapons progr a m m e s
had been dismantled or destroyed and the
threat from them reduced to “zero, none,”
said the A m e rican former chief of the
UN S C O M inspection team, Scott Ritter, in a
recent BBC documentary which attacked
those responsible for maintaining the
embargo.2
But the UN Security Council set up a
new arms control commission in its reso-
lution 1284 of 17 December 1999. “The
aim is to check that nothing nuclear has
been rebuilt and to see what the situation is
c o n c e rning chemical and biologi c a l
we a p o n s ,” s ays the French foreign min-
i s t ry.“After that we can move towards lifting
sanctions if Iraq co-operates.”
France, along with China and Russia,
n e ve rtheless abstained in the vote to approve
resolution 1284, s aying the wording did
not describe “in completely good fa i t h ”t h e
procedure for suspending the embargo.T h e
Iraqi regime is refusing to co-operate.
So the people of Iraq are still hostages.
“ W h at was an acceptable situation in 1991
no longer is,” s ays Germ a ny ’s Hans vo n
Sponeck, the latest UN humanitarian co-
ordinator in Iraq to have resigned his post,
in March 2000.The embargo, decided upon
in full compliance with the UN Charter,is
n ow “a clear violation of human ri g h t s ,”
he says. Even worse, states former French
foreign minister Claude Cheysson, it is a
c rime against humanity,“as defined by the
UN itself”3 (see box).
In the United States some people agr e e ,
including former A t t o rney-General Ramsey
Clark and Francis Boy l e , professor of inter-
n ational law at the Unive rsity of Illinois.Vo n
S p o n e c k ’s predecessor, I rishman Denis Hal-
l i d ay, who resigned in September 1998, h a s
also joined the opponents of the embargo.
“ I ’ ve been using the term ‘ g e n o c i d e ,’ b e c a u s e
this is a deliberate policy to destroy the people
of Iraq,”he recently stat e d .Some legal expert s
are sceptical about or even against using such
t e rm i n o l o g y.“ People who talk like that don’t
k n ow anything about law,” r e t o rts Mari o
B e t t at i ,who invented the notion of “the ri g h t
of humanitarian interve n t i o n ” .“The embargo
has certainly affected the Iraqi people badly,
but that ’s not at all a crime against humanity
or genocide.”
FIDH secretary-general Bourdon says
“one of the key elements of a crime against
humanity and of genocide is intent. T h e
embargo wa s n ’t imposed because the
United States and Britain wanted children
to die. If you think so, you have to prove it.”
But what about today, when the whole
world knows Iraqi children are dying
because of the sanctions?
“ L e aving in place a measure which yo u
k n ow is killing people isn’t the same as
applying measures deliberately calculated
and planned to cause the maximum number
of people to die,” he says.
Pat rick Baudouin, F I D H ’s president,
is less sure. He says he “ h e s i t at e s ” to call the
embargo a crime against humanity. “As a

extension does raise serious questions.” A l l
these law ye rs agr e e , h owe ve r , t h at the
embargo violates basic human ri g h t s ,
starting with the right to life.
There is also a lot of argument about
who is responsible for the humanitari a n
disaster in Iraq. The U. S . S t ate Depart-
ment, which does not even accept UNICEF
and WH O f i g u r e s , puts the blame on
Saddam Hussein. Samuel Berger, of the
U. S . N ational Security Council, said in
May 2000 that “by obstructing UN relief,
refusing to order nutritional supplements,
e ven selling food and medicine to bu i l d
p a l a c e s , M r. Saddam has aggr avated his
p e o p l e ’s suffering and used the spectacle to
seek the removal of sanctions.”
Von Sponeck spends most of his time
r e butting these arguments.“The UN pub-
lishes a monthly stock report that show s
w h at has arri ved in Iraq, w h at has been
distributed, what is stored away and why.
The picture that emerges for food is perfect.
(...) Tr a n s p o rt is a problem, but people are
receiving their food baskets every month
and warehouses are empty the day after
distribution,” he says.
When Washington accuses Baghdad of
not distri buting about a quarter of the med-
ical supplies, he notes that “W H O r e c o m-
mends that a country should have 25 per cent
of its drugs in stock to prepare and be pre-
pared for an epidemic. Iraq said it could not
afford this, but keeps 15 per cent in stock.
The drugs all undergo quality control tests,
which 5.8 per cent of them have fa i l e d .T h e n
you have medical components that are unus-
able because they can only be used in com-
b i n ation with others.” H a l l i d ay points out that
the sanctions committee “ would deliber-
ately approve nine [items] but block the
t e n t h , k n owing full well that without the
tenth item, the other nine were of no use . . .
I t ’s a deliberate ploy.”
Reforming the UN Charter
Unease over the Iraqi embargo has
reopened debate about the use of embar-
goes as a we a p o n . A rticle 41 of the UN
C h a rter says the Security Council can
enforce its decisions by applying measures
t h at include “the complete or partial inter-
ruption of economic relations and of . . .
means of communication.”
This trend has increased in recent ye a rs.
Since 1990, the United Nations has
imposed sanctions on Yu g o s l av i a ,S o m a l i a ,
S i e rra Leone, L i b ya ,L i b e ri a ,H a i t i ,A n g o l a ’s
Unita rebels and Iraq.
S u p p o rt e rs of sanctions say it is often the
only way to punish countries that threaten
p e a c e . They cost little at a time when
We s t e rn public opinion frowns on the huge
expense and loss of human life involved in
m i l i t a ry interve n t i o n s. The opponents of
sanctions stress the serious effects on the
civilian population while the targeted
r e gimes become more entrenched and
manage to smuggle in supplies regardless.
The Iraqi example confirms their argu-
m e n t .The people have been bled dry.T h e r e
is abundant proof that the ruling clique is
becoming wealthier and that oil is being
smuggled out. At the end of Ja n u a ry 2000,
the British House of Commons issued a
r e p o rt admitting the embargo had failed and
expressing the hope that no other country
would ever be submitted to such an ordeal.
“Nearly all embargoes penalize civil-
ians and boost the power of the political
l e a d e rs they aim to bring dow n ,” s ay s
B o u r d o n , who neve rtheless adds that “ o n e
can perhaps say that developments in South
A f rica were the result of intern ational sanc-
tions against apartheid.”
Along with others , he points to the
e x c e s s i ve weight of the United Stat e s ,
backed by its British ally, in Securi t y
Council decisions. He thinks the UN
C h a rter should be amended and UN deci-
sion-making procedures changed. In par-
ticular, victims of human rights violations
should be represented by a consultat i ve
committee attached to the Security Council.
“ I t ’s unacceptable that the future of a whole
people should be in the hands of two stat e s ,”
he says. “We can no longer allow states to
pursue cynically their regional or interna-
tional interests,as is the case in Iraq.”
Many analysts,including Halliday and
von Sponeck, think the embargo is being
prolonged so as to maintain the status quo
in the Middle East.According to them, its
protagonists are in favour of a weak Iraq,
without necessarily getting rid of a regime
that prevents the country splitting apart.
These analysts say the break-up of Iraq,
with a Kurdish gove rnment in the nort h
and a Shiite authority in the south, could
destabilize a region that provides the bulk of
the oil needed by the major world powers
and would threaten key U.S.allies such as
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Further-
m o r e , s ays Halliday, maintaining tension
in the region has enabled U.S. arms man-
ufacturers to sell about $100 billion worth
of weaponry to Baghdad’s enemies.
But with the We s t e rn media increas-
ingly outraged at the embargo and three
m e m b e rs of the UN Security Council
( F r a n c e , Russia and China) openly against
continuing it, von Sponeck sees a glimmer
of hope. “I don’t think the sanctions will be
extended far into 2001,” he say s , “ bu t
think of all the children who’ll die in the
m e a n t i m e .”
