The price of a good re a d
The price of books in recent years has pitted small independent bookshops against 
the big chains, supermarkets and the Internet. But what is in the customer’s best interest?
he end-of-year holidays are nearing. I m a-
gine you have decided to give books as
presents to all your friends and relatives,
who are interested in just about every-
t h i n g. The decision is made, but where
should you buy them? The standard
choice is your local bookshop.There you
will probably find a professional book-
seller who will be able to recommend the
most interesting books for each of your
f r i e n d s, tell the difference between a
paperback and a pocket edition, a n d
order from the publisher or distributor
any book he or she does not have in stock.
If you live in Fr a n c e, S p a i n ,G e r m a n y
or any of the other six European Union
countries that have a single-price policy
for books, it will cost you exactly the same
whatever bookshop or department store
you go into looking for the cheapest price.
And if you are a good customer, t h e
bookseller may give you a five percent
discount,which is usually the maximum
allowed under the fixed-price laws.
This system is founded on two basic
p r i n c i p l e s : that the same book should
cost the same wherever it is bought,w h e-
ther in the centre of Berlin or the only
shop in a tiny Bavarian village, and that
unlike shoes and clothes, the price will
stay the same all year round because sea-
sonal discounts are not allowed. Under
this arrangement, the publisher usually
sets the price of the book, giving the book-
seller a profit margin of about 30 percent.
But if you live in Belgium, S w e d e n
or the United Kingdom (where book
prices were deregulated in 1995),you will
find big differences from shop to shop
because the booksellers themselves can
set the prices.Although this seems at fir s t
sight to benefit the reading customer, t h e
book trade is divided over it. In a world of
disappearing national borders, transna-
tional authorities such as the European
Union are therefore seeking a degree of
standardization which, while obeying the
laws of competition,is fair to everyone.
The advocates of the fixed-price
system hold up Germany as an example.
With its 7,000 or so bookshops and more
than 1,200 publishers, it is one of the
driving forces in the print word.Or Fr a n c e
where, unlike the film industry’s depen-
dence on government aid, publishing is
s e l f - s u f fic i e n t . In both countries, all those
involved in the book trade—authors,
p u b l i s h e r s,distributors and booksellers—
ardently defend the fixed-price system.
Similar attitudes can be found in Spain,
where the government has deregulated
discounts on textbooks for the current
school year, unleashing noisy protests
from writers,publishers and booksellers.
The French publishers’ magazine L i v r e s
H e b d o reports that in the United Kingdom,
where both systems have operated over the
past decade,five years of deregulation have
seen the price of books rise 16 percent, f a r
more than the nine per-
cent rise in the cost-of-
l i v i n g. One result of this,
the magazine says, h a s
been increased book sales
in bookshop chains and
department stores, w h e r e
the person who sells you
a book one day may be
switched to the cosmetics
counter the next.
Under a free-pricing
s y s t e m , the law of supply
and demand will imme-
diately affect prices, s i n c e
publishers mark up their
best-sellers to compen-
sate for losses from the
discounts handed out by
s u p e r m a r k e t s.The temp-
tation becomes strong
just to publish things that
will sell easily and
q u i c k l y, with a resulting
loss of diversity. F u r t h e r-
m o r e,for every 200 books
published there is rarely
more than one best-seller,
and it is not unusual for
these to keep on turning
up in the catalogues of
the same handful of
p u b l i s h e r s — n a m e l y
those who can afford to
pay huge advances to the
most famous authors and
buy the most expensive
foreign rights.
“A system where
there is competition over
prices only works for the best-selling
b o o k s : the rest are seen as ‘bad quality’,”
says Markus Gerlach, a German expert
on book prices. “This argument is quite
unacceptable when it comes to a book
of poetry or an essay.”
Of course books are not the only pro-
ducts with fixed prices. In virtually every
c o u n t r y, c i g a r e t t e s,medicine and newspa-
pers are as well.“Books are a cultural pro-
duct and as such they deserve every pro-
tection we can give them, especially as
they are now threatened by things such as
pirating and illegal copying,”says J.R y b a ,
who runs a bookshop in Israel.
But let’s continue our book-buying
expedition.If you have a credit card and
an Internet connection, you can order

Horizons widen with a book on a Parisian rooftop.

N
your books from one of the many online
bookshops, which will send the books to
your home. You will probably have to
pay the  shipping charges and trust the
e f fic i e n cy of the postal system, but the
advantages are clear:
you can buy the
books without leaving
your home or offic e
from businesses that
are open round the
clock every day of the
week.And in theory,
as in Jorge Luis
Borges’ Library of
Babel, all the world’s
books are just a
mouse-click away.
And what about
the prices? H a r r y
Potter and the Philoso-
p h e r’s Stone, the fir s t
book in British author
J. K . R o w l i n g ’s series
which is enchanting
the young and not-so-young on every conti-
n e n t , costs 5.79 euros in France (roughly
$ 4 . 8 0 ) , 9.71 in Spain (for the Spanish edi-
tion—it costs 10.28 in Catalan) and 14.31 in
G e r m a n y, according to data compiled at
the end of October 2000 from various
online bookshops.All these countries have
a fixed-price system,which does not neces-
sarily lead to cheap books. On the other
h a n d , a book can cost
less in Marseilles,
where prices are fix e d ,
than in Brussels,w h e r e
they are not.
Alongside super-
m a r k e t s, actual and
virtual bookshops,
there is a third way to
buy a book. If you
belong to a book club,
such as France Loisirs
in Fr a n c e, the Círculo
de Lectores in Spain
or Bertelsmann Buch-
club in Germany (all
of which, i n c i d e n t a l l y,
are owned by Bertels-
m a n n ) , you can get
quite cheap hardback
books to give as gifts.But you will have to
forget about the new Harry Potter book,
the last winner of the Goncourt Prize or a
new revised translation of Don Quixote,
since such clubs have to wait at least nine
months before they can offer the latest
books for sale. Their catalogues are slim
t o o, because publishers are unwilling to
take the risk of releasing a book unless
sales are pretty much guaranteed. S u c h
clubs may sell carefully chosen books quite
c h e a p l y,but they can prove an annoyance
after a while because you have to buy a
minimum number over periods of up to
two years.
L a s t l y, the other factor that can make
your holiday purchases cheaper or dearer
is tax. If you live in Sweden or Denmark,
book prices may not be very expensive,
but you will have to add a 25 percent sales
t a x , something that does not exist in the
United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway.
So what is the best way to buy your
books? There is no single answer.Do you
want to give best-sellers, books about
current affairs, reference books, original
works or translations? Do you want prose
or poetry? Full or abridged versions?
Complete works or anthologies? Hard-
back or paperback?
Whatever price you pay, dear reader,
the future of books is in your hands.
Enjoy them. ■
