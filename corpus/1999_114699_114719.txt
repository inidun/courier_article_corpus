The last two decades have seen an explosion in the number of museums and
a transformation of their place in society
Museums hoist their
new colours René Rivard*

Museums reached a turning-point at
the end of the 1960s. They tried to
s m a rten themselves up, to revive their
job of teaching the public and to at t r a c t
more visitors. M a ny new ones opened—
more than half the wo r l d ’s 25,000
museums started up during the past 50
ye a rs. E ven the idea of what a museum
should be has changed considerably and
given rise to a broad range of variations.
Museums were invented at the end of
the 19th century as places to gat h e r
together and preserve the finest examples of
human ingenuity and present them to the
p u b l i c. Early museums often lacked the
resources to look after their collections
properly and exhibit them at t r a c t i ve l y.T h e y
became dull, grey places which we r e
cramped and increasingly dusty.
These days greyness is rare. In fa c t , I
would divide museums into seven main
c at e g o ries and associate each one with a
c o l o u r: orange for “ i n t e rp r e t at i ve ”
m u s e u m s , green for those with an
e c o l o gical approach, ye l l ow for
community-centred museums, blue for
those which aim to share knowledge, gold
for museums which go in for the
s p e c t a c u l a r , s i l ver for bu s i n e s s - o ri e n t e d
museums and mauve for museums of
remembrance.
Interpretation—a watershed 
in museum history
The interpretative movement began in
the 1950s in US national parks such as the
Grand Canyo n , Ye l l owstone and the
F l o rida Everglades and spread throughout
the English-speaking world, from Canada
to Australia via the United Kingdom,
reaching as far as English-speaking
countries in Africa.
I n t e rp r e t ation marks a wat e rshed in the
h i s t o ry of museums. It gi ves pri o rity to a
subject or theme rather than the exhibits
t h e m s e l ve s , which are considered as
evidence from the past and not as the
centre of at t e n t i o n . I n t e rp r e t ation means
s t i m u l ating and surp rising people, a n d
c h a l l e n ging accepted ideas,without turn i n g
the museum into a classroom.Visitors are
encouraged to refer to their ow n
e x p e ri e n c e s , not just straight scientific
knowledge,and to relate on equal terms to
the heritage they are learning about.
In addition to national parks,h u n d r e d s
of historic spots around the world have
chosen this interp r e t at i ve approach.A m o n g
them are Canada’s Louisbourg Fo rt r e s s
a n d , in the United Stat e s , the town of
Salem and the bat t l e fields of the War of
I n d e p e n d e n c e . Since the late 1970s, t h i s
trend has involved new ways of presenting
things based on the experience of the visit
i t s e l f. V i s i t o rs explore the ambience of a
place steeped in history and see what they
can learn from it and what ideas it gi ve s
t h e m .I n t e rp r e t ation confronts people with
q u e s t i o n s ,t h e o ries and new perceptions of
history. The settlement of the West in the
United Stat e s , the slave trade and
c o l o n i a l i s m , for example, are put in
p e rs p e c t i ve .A rmed with this kind of cri t i c a l
approach,visitors come up with their own
i n t e rp r e t ations of the things they are
presented with.
In Quebec, museums which take an
i n t e rp r e t at i ve approach have experi m e n t e d
a lot with the role of interpreter and critic
and offer their visitors quite ori ginal places
and experiences. The Châteauguay Battle
Centre (commemorating Canada’s defeat
of an A m e rican invasion in 1812) has
chosen to question the part played by
heroes in our societies. The museum at
Trois-Pistoles encourages discussion about
the intensive whaling carried out by the
Basques in the estuary of the St.Lawrence
river in the 16th century.
A green 
revolution
In the 1970s, the populari z ation of
museums was taken further with the
d e velopment of the ecomuseum concept
by Georges Henri Rivière, an imaginative
French museologist who took a new look at
the three basic components of a museum—
the bu i l d i n g, the collections housed in it
and the people who come to see them.He
favoured replacing buildings as the site of
museums with a wider setting in which
t y p o l o gically classified collections wo u l d

be replaced by examples of the natural and
cultural heritage which could be observed
in their normal env i r o n m e n t . The people
who visited such museums, he thought,
should be people who lived locally and we r e
both users and preserve rs of the heri t a g e
that was on display.
In Europe and North A m e ri c a , t h e r e
has been extensive experi m e n t ation with
R i v i è r e ’s concept of
d e c o m p a rt m e n t a l i z at i o n . E x a m p l e s
include the cultural park in Molinos
( A r a g o n ) , S p a i n , the Proud World House
( s h owing labour conditions) in Montreal
(Canada) and, in France, the ecomuseums
of Margeride (rural life) in the A u ve r g n e
and on the isle of Ouessant (the mari n e
environment).
Militant 
museums
The ecomuseum movement is mainly
a rural one, but urban va riants of
ecomuseums sprang up as needy distri c t s
in big A m e rican cities awoke in the 1970s
and 1980s. Neighbourhood museums
were opened in poor areas of New Yo r k ,
Washington D. C . , C h i c a g o, Tucson and
other cities. They were often in form e r
public places, o r d i n a ry houses or sheds,
and illustrated local eve ry d ay cultures,
from an ethnic, working-class or crafts
The Science Centre Museum at Monterrey (Mexico).
s t a n d p o i n t .
These new kinds of museums often
s p u rred existing ones to reconsider their
place in the city and in society at large.
S e veral conventional museums, such as the
C h i l d r e n ’s Museum in Indianapolis and
the New York City Museum, b e g a n
“ o u t r e a c h ”a c t i v i t i e s ,s t a ging exhibitions in
streets,suburbs and poor neighbourhoods
on themes including dru g s , violence and
sexually-transmitted diseases.
In the same area as the closely-linked
ye l l ow and blue cat e g o ries are two other
trends which have developed in seve r a l
p a rts of the wo r l d . The firs t , w h i c h
appeared in the mid-1980s, might be
called a “ m i l i t a n t ” t r e n d , where the
museum becomes an instrument of
community development by spreading
and sharing its resources. S e ve r a l
museums in the Sahel countries of Niger,
Burkina Faso and Mali have chosen this
approach involving exhibits from animist
c u l t u r e .Their aims and actions are similar
to those of European ecomuseums,
M e x i c o ’s community museums and the
neighbourhood museums of the United
S t ates and South A f ri c a .
The second trend,knowledge-sharing,
is found particularly in natural science and
science and technology museums which
seek to stimulate interest in science and to
point young people towards scientific
c a r e e rs. There are now many technology
museums and hundreds of science centres
all over the wo r l d , not only in We s t e rn
c o u n t ries but also in India and the Far East,
notably China, Japan and Indonesia.
Blockbuster 
exhibitions
The last two decades have been marked by
profound economic changes and
u p h e ava l s. In a number of countri e s ,
budgets for culture and museums have
been cut back.To cope with this situation,
some museums have adopted presentat i o n
and marketing techniques to raise money
The last two decades have been marked by
profound economic changes and upheavals.
In a number of countries, budgets for
culture and museums have been cut back

for running costs and expansion by stagi n g
major events and adopting the profit -
o riented approach of the 1980s and 1990s.
A rt museums have led the fie l d ,
through large exhibitions billed as
e x c l u s i ves or “ firs t - e ve rs ” .The trend began
with the Tutankhamen exhibition in the
early 1970s. All the resources of adve rt i s i n g
and public relations are used to promote
p r e s e n t ations of an art i s t ’s new wo r k s , o f
rarely-seen pri vate or museum collections,
unique treasures or exotic or extraordinary
o b j e c t s. These blockbuster shows cost a
f o rtune to organize. Their purpose is to
raise large amounts of cash to enable
museums to repay their debts and put on
new exhibitions. N owa d ays museum
curators are often hired for their ability to
raise money or to stage shows of this kind,
hopefully to turn a profit.
This trend is growing as public grants
for museums and cultural bodies diminish.
The appearance of museum boutiques to
boost takings is also part of this bu s i n e s s
strategy.
Mourning 
and remembrance
A museum can also be an instru m e n t
whereby society can mourn a lost golden
age and at the same time look directly at
the present and the future. Through the
p rism of collected and exhibited objects,
h i s t o rical events and trends can be seen
in a pers p e c t i ve uncluttered with morbid
n o s t a l gi a .
The Scandinavians have long used
museums for this purpose.A century ago,
the Swedes opened the first open-air
museum ( s k a n s e n ) in Stockholm to
remember their traditional fa rming culture.
They and the Norwe gians are now opening
labour museums and industri a l
ecomuseums to solemnly bu ry their
g l o rious working-class and trade union
h i s t o ry, to mark the decline or death of their
major heavy industries and promote the
development of modern technology.
Over the past 15 years, new museums
of this kind have sprung up in many places
to commemorate atrocities and major
d i s a s t e rs that are engr aved in the collective
m e m o ry. Numerous institutions have
opened in North A m e ri c a , Europe and
I s r a e l , for example, to mark the Holocaust,
the Viet Nam war and other relat i ve l y
recent human tragedies.
In France, m a ny recently opened
m u s e u m s , such as the Memorial museums
at Caen and Péronne and a number of
Resistance museums, attempt to come to
t e rms with the terrible memories of two
world wa rs. The same kind of thing is
happening in Britain and the rest of
Europe. Other museums have been set up
to commemorate natural disasters , such as
gr e at flo o d s , volcanic eruptions and
e a rt h q u a k e s. These funerary monuments
