E
rik Reitzel’s Symbolic 
Globe, situated in 
the middle of the 
bright flags of UNESCO’s 190 
Members States, is indeed 
symbolic on several levels: its 
shape, its meaning, and the 
circumstances of its creation 
and installation.
Evoking the logo of the 
United Nations, the structure 
consists of an outside 
transparent sphere that holds 
within it another smaller 
sphere, solid and golden.  The 
Danish engineer conceived 
it for the World Summit on 
Social Development held in 
Copenhagen in March 1995.  
Made up of 10,000 aluminium 
rods, it was assembled in six 
days by the Summit delegates 
themselves in a gesture of 
solidarity underlining their 
countries’ commitment 
to development through 
diversity and dialogue.  The 
Danish government made the 
globe available to UNESCO 
for the Organization’s 50th 
anniversary, which was 
celebrated in November that 
same year.
The immense structure, 
which is firmly anchored 
with cables, has a diameter 
of 15 metres and weighs four 
tonnes.  It is representative of 
Reitzel’s theory on the identity 
of equations, developed in the 
early 1970s, that examines 
the correlation between the 
form of rupture lines and 
minimal structures.  His 
research focuses on functional 
structures using a minimum 
of material, and on the 
combination of material with 
new methods of construction.
The Symbolic Globe is a 
tribute to the marriage of the 
functional and the aesthetic, 
an alliance which is suited to 
both public and private sectors 
because it can be applied 
to all sorts of constructions, 
from big buildings to small 
structures.
