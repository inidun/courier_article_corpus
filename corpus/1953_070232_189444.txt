UNESCO AND EDUCATION F (
Tiny children of different lands and different colour can be put to play together and they have no feeling of colour-bar
or prejudice. It is only later when they grow up that they develop prejudices and get attached to them. (USIS photo.)

O"'E of the bad things aboutgrowing up is that ve
develop prejudices and get
attached to them. Very young
children of different colour can
be put to play together in a sand-
pit and they have no sense of
colour-bar. If you tell young
children that little girls in China
dress differently from little girls
in America, or that little boys in
India may have the luck to ride
on an elephant whereas a lucky

but they don't
feel called upon
to pronounce on
the superiority of
their own way
of life. Their
eyes are open
with wonder,
and'without pre-

the constitution
of Unesco calls
"the fruitful di-

We begin to
acquire these
suspicions of the
stranger quite
early, and biolo-
gically this has
been a useful
protective device.
But more than
one species has disappeared be-
cause it developed a characteris-
tic that'ways at first useful and
then could not be adapted to
changed circumstances. The
same may happen to us, for our
world has suddenly shrunk.
Two wars have made us realize
ho'w small it is. Now we know
that we may at any moment blow
ourselns out of it.
We have had just enough intel-
ligence to see how wore could pro-
teet ourselves. We have founded
the United Nations, because we
see that only through such a
device can we keep the peace.
Sincewars have commonly result-
ed from men's refusal to allow to
others the rights they claim for
themselves we have adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human
Blights. But these things won't
work unless we are trained to live
in this kind of a world. It is no
use seeing what is necessary
THE 32nd ANNUAL WORLD MESSAGE
OF THE YOUTH OF WALES
"GOODWILL DAY"MAY 18, 1953
BOYS and girls of all nations ! We, the boys and girls of'W ales.once again greet you. This is Goodwill Day. Across land
and sea, youth calls to youth in the name of freedam and of friend-
ship.
W P. rejoice, to-dq, y, in all the efforts of men and women of every
race and people, who are doing their best to set the world free
from way.
We want a world in which never again shall countless homes
be destroyed and little children suffel'hunger.
We want a world where no nation shall live in fear of any
other nation.
We want a world where the nations shall work together for the
good of all, trusting each other and sharing together the riches uj"
the earth.
By our confidence and courage, by our thoughts and deeds, u ; e
can help to spread a new spirit throughout the world. And we
will !
Youth of all lands, let us dedicate ourselves to-day to our great
adventure of peace on earth and goodwill among men.
unless we make a real adaptatioil
in our behaviour. And it is be-
cause this is essentially a matter
of education that Unesco ways
founded.
If Unesco were only an office
in Paris, its task'would be
impossible. It is more than that :
it is an association of some sixty-
five countries which have pledged
themselves to do all they can, not
only internationally but'within
their own boundaries, to advance
if its purpose
had been to
make French
boys less French,
Americans less
American, Japa-
nese less Japa-
nese. Being a
good neighbour
does not mean
ceasing to call
your home your
own and having
to re-arrange the
furniture the
way some one
down the street
might like it.
Education for
international
understanding
doesn't even
mean saying
that other peo-
ple's opinions or
ways of life are
as good as your
own. They may
not be. It means only admitting
that they have as much right to
their opinions and their ways of
life as you have to yours. It
means mutual respect and mutu-
al help-as I said, being good
neighbours.
Education is involved in two
ways. If we are to get on with
each other instead of blowing
each other up we need to develop
friendly attitudes of mind for
co-operating with people who
the common aim of educating for
peace. The international side
comes in because we shall ob-
viously do this faster and better
and with more mutual trust if'we
do it together.
This doesn't mean that edu-
cation in your school is to be
turned over to some insidious
foreign influence that Iwants to
aUack your way of life. The
governments that make up Unes-
co would never have founded it

FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING
An explanation for older children at school
may not have the same outlook as
our own. And we need know-
ledge of what these differences are
80 that we can understand each
other and co-operate better. In
forming these attitudes and in
giving this knowledge what hap-
pens in school is important.
Dictators who have waned to
organize their people for war have
always done two things in their
schools : they have used authori-
tarian methods so that children
grow up not as free and respon-
sible persons but as unquestioning
servants of the dictator's will ; and
they have twisted what was taught
about other countries so that hate
was engendered instead of under-
standing. Education among de-
mocratic and peace-loving peoples
will do the opposite of these things.
It will encourage schools them-
selves to be communities, in which
children, though they have to
follow certain rules for the com-
mon good, will follow them hap-
pily, and indeed help to carry them
out, because they are treated as real
persons capable of showing initia-
tive and of thinking for themselves.
Let me give one example of the
way in which Unesco helps forward
such an aim. It is our duty to
spread understanding of Human
Rights. We called an interna-
tional meeting of teachers last year
to discuss how this might be done
in schools, and we are publishing
a practical handbook on the subject
this year. In both you will find
emphasis on the idea that, though
older children might be expected
to know something of the Uni-
versal Declaration itself, the im-
portant things are that the idea of
human rights should be encou-
raged through the teaching of
present school subjects, and that
schools themselves should be com-
munities where human rights are
observed.
The provision of direct informa-
tion about other countries becomes
more important as one goes
through the school. We must
have such information if we are to
make intelligent decisions about
what our own country ought to do
in international affairs. Even
from our own country's point of
view (apart from that of mankind
as a whole) it is important that
information be accurate in fact and
that comment be fair in tone.
Much of our teaching concentrates,
quite rightly, on telling us about
the history and the geography and
the achievements of our own coun-
try. This sometimes leads us,
though it need not, to under-
estimate the achievements and the
ways of life of wheres. There is
now no countrv so distant from us
that we may not be involved,
through something that happens
there, in major difficulties, or in
war itself. How many of you knew
where Korea was, or really under-
stood what the phrase"Collective
Security"meant, until the inva-
sion of South Korea almost three
years ago ?
In all these matters Unesco is
active. We have called meetings
of teachers from many countries to
consider how the teaching of cer-
tain school subjects, like history
and geography, can help to give us
a better understanding of other
peoples. This year we are holding
a similar international meeting to
discuss how the' : grind" of lan-
guage teaching can be speeded up
so that we can really use a foreign
language as a key to open an inter-
esting civilization to our minds.
Unesco has stimulated the estab-
lishment of over twenty commit-
tees of scholars to compare their
national textbooks and see if they
can agree on accounts of controver-
sial matters which seem fair in
all the countries concerned.
Through a series of publications
we are encouraging teaching about
the United Nations and its essential
role in keeping the peace and pro-
moting the common welfare of
mankind. I think you will agree
that these are all important things
to do through Unesco.
Now \shat do you think could be
done in your school to give you a
better understanding of other peo-
ples, and of the United Nations and
its \vork ? And how could that be
done without overcrowding the
time-table so that vou yourself
would protest ? You will be reading
this article either in English or in
French or in Spanish. If you like
to think this problem out in terms
of your school and talk to your
friends and vour teachers about it
and then write to me in whichever
of the three languages you use I
"will be interested to read what you
write. And if I do not have time to
discuss what you say in detail I
will at least thank you from our
Unesco headquarters.
