> what is the world
An international
treaty
I The United Nations
I Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
seeks to encourage the
identification, protection and
preservation of cultural and
natural heritage around the world
considered to be of outstanding
value to humanity.
The idea of creating an
international movement for
protecting sites in other countries
emerged after World War I, but
the landmark event in arousing
international concern was the
decision to build the Aswan High
Dam in Egypt, which would have
flooded the valley containing the
Abu Simbel temples, a treasure of
ancient Egyptian civilization. In
1959, after an appeal from the
governments of Egypt and Sudan,
UNESCO decided to launch an
international campaign, and the
Abu Simbel and Philae temples
were dismantled, moved to dry
ground and reassembled.
The campaign cost about $80
million, half of which was
donated by some fifty countries,
showing the importance of
nations' shared responsibility in
conserving outstanding cultural
sites. Its success led to other
safeguarding campaigns, e.g. for
Venice in Italy, Moenjodaro in
Pakistan and Borobudur in
Indonesia.
Consequently, UNESCO
initiated, with the help of the
International Council on
Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS), the preparation of a
draft convention on the
protection of cultural heritage.
The idea of combining the
conservation of cultural and
natural sites comes from the
United States. A White House
Conference in Washington, D.C.,
in 1965 called for a "World
Heritage Trust" that would
stimulate international co¬
operation to protect "the world's
superb natural and scenic areas and
historic sites for the present and
the future of the entire world
citizenry". In 1968 the
International Union for
conservation of Nature (IUCN)
developed similar proposals for
its members. These proposals were
presented to the United Nations
Conference on Human
Environment held in Stockholm
(Sweden) in 1972.
Eventually, a single text was
agreed upon by all parties
concerned. The Convention
concerning the Protection of the
World Cultural and Natural
Heritage was adopted by the
General Conference of UNESCO
on 16 November 1972.
Objectives
I The term cultural heritage
I refers to monuments,
groups of buildings and sites with
historical, aesthetic,
archaeological, scientific,
ethnological or anthropological
value. Natural heritage refers to
outstanding physical, biological
and geological formations,
habitats of threatened species of
animals and plants and areas with
scientific, conservation or
aesthetic value.
UNESCO's World Heritage
mission is to:
> encourage countries to sign the
1972 Convention and to ensure
the protection of their natural and
cultural heritage;
> encourage States Parties to the
Convention to nominate sites
within their national territory for
inclusion on the World Heritage
List;
> encourage States Parties to set
up reporting systems on the state
of conservation of World Heritage
sites;
> help States Parties safeguard
World Heritage sites by providing
technical assistance and
professional training;
> provide emergency assistance
for World Heritage sites in
immediate danger;
> promote the presentation of
cultural and natural heritage;
> encourage international co¬
operation in conservation of
cultural and natural heritage.
A gift from the past to
the future
By signing the World
Heritage Convention,
countries recognize that the sites
located on their national territory
which have been inscribed on the
World Heritage List, without
prejudice to national sovereignty
or ownership, constitute a world
heritage "for whose protection it
is the duty of the international
community as a whole to co¬
operate".
Without the support of other
countries, some sites with
recognized cultural or natural
value would deteriorate or, worse,
disappear, often through lack of
funding to preserve them. The
Convention is thus an agreement,
signed to date by 149 countries,
to contribute the necessary
financial and intellectual resources
to protect World Heritage sites.
Sites selected for World
Heritage listing are approved on

heritage*.i
the basis of their merits as the best
possible examples of the cultural
and natural heritage. The World
Heritage List draws attention to
the wealth and diversity of the
earth's cultural and natural heritage.
The Convention
The most significant
' feature of the World
Heritage Convention is to link
together in a single document the
concepts of nature conservation
and the preservation of cultural
sites. It defines the kind of natural
or cultural sites which can be
considered for inscription on the
World Heritage List, and sets out
the duties of States Parties in
identifying potential sites and
their role in protecting and
preserving them.
A World Heritage site differs
from a site of national heritage by
virtue of its "outstanding universal
value". By signing the Convention,
each country pledges to conserve
not only the World Heritage sites
situated on its territory, but also to
protect its national heritage
whether or not it is placed on the
World Heritage List.
The Convention describes the
function of the World Heritage
Committee, how its members are
elected and their terms of office;
specifies the professional advisory
bodies to which it can turn for
advice in selecting the sites to be
listed; and explains how the
World Heritage Fund is to be used
and managed and under what
conditions international financial
assistance may be provided.
I HOW THE CONVENTION
WORKS
The application for a site to be
inscribed on the World Heritage
List must come from the country
itself. Unesco makes no
recommendations for listing. The
application has to include a plan
detailing how the site is managed
and protected.
The World Heritage
Committee examines
nominations on the basis of
technical evaluations, provided by
two advisory bodies, the
International Council on
Monuments and Sites
(ICOMOS) and the World
Conservation Union (IUCN). A
third advisory body, the
International Centre for the
Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property
(ICCROM), provides expert
advice on restoring monuments
and organizes training courses.
I SELECTION CRITERIA
To be included on the World
Heritage List, sites must satisfy
the selection criteria which are
explained in a booklet entitled
Operational Guidelines which,
besides the text of the
Convention, is the main working
document on World Heritage. The
criteria have been revised regularly
by the Committee to match the



evolution of the World Heritage
concept itself.
Cultural properties should:
(i) represent a masterpiece of
human creative genius, or
(ii) exhibit an important
interchange of human values over
a span of time or within a cultural
area of the world, or
developments in architecture or
technology, monumental arts,
town planning or landscape
design, or
(iii) bear a unique or at least
exceptional testimony to a
cultural tradition or to a
civilization which is living or has
disappeared, or
(iv) be an outstanding example of
a type of building or architectural
or technological ensemble, or
landscape which illustrates a
significant stage or significant
stages in human history, or
(v) be an outstanding example of a
traditional human settlement or
land-use which is representative of
a culture or cultures, especially
when it has become vulnerable
under the impact of irreversible
change, or
(vi) be directly or tangibly
associated with events or living
traditions, with ideas or with
beliefs, or with artistic and
literary works of outstanding
universal significance (a criterion
used only in exceptional
circumstances, and together with
other criteria).
Equally important is the
authenticity of the site and the
way it is protected and managed.
Natural propertiesshould:
(i) be outstanding examples
representing major stages of the
earth's history, including the
record of life, significant ongoing
geological processes in the
development of landforms, or
significant geomorphic or
physiographic features, or
(ii) be outstanding examples
representing significant ongoing
ecological and biological processes
in the evolution and development
of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal
and marine ecosystems and
communities of plants and
animals, or
(iii) contain superlative natural
phenomena or areas of exceptional
natural beauty and aesthetic
importance, or
(iv) contain the most important
and significant natural habitats for
in situ conservation of biological
diversity, including those
containing threatened species of
outstanding universal value from
the point of view of science or
conservation.
The protection, management
and integrity of the site are also
important considerations.
Mixed sites have both
outstanding natural and cultural
values. Since 1 992 significant
interactions between people and
the natural environment have been
recognized as cultural landscapes.

I PROTECTION AND
MONITORING
World Heritage conservation is an
ongoing process. Listing a site
does little good if it subsequently
falls into a state of disrepair or if a
development project risks
destroying the qualities that made
the site suitable for World
Heritage status in the first place.
The credibility of World Heritage
stems from countries' regular
reporting on the condition of
sites, on measures taken to
preserve them, and on their
efforts to raise public awareness of
Cultural and natural heritage. If a
country is not fulfilling its
obligations under the
Convention, it risks having its
sites deleted from the World
Heritage List.
The World Heritage
Committee will be alerted by
individuals, non-governmental
organizations, or other groups
to possible dangers to a site. If the
alert is justified, and the problem
serious enough, the site will be
placed on the List of World
Heritage in Danger. This list is
designed to call the world's
attention to natural or human-
made conditions which threaten
the characteristics for which the
site was originally inscribed on
the World Heritage List.
Endangered sites on this list are
entitled to particular attention
and emergency action.
In urgent cases, such as
outbreak of war, the Committee
will make the listing itself without
having received a formal request.
Funding and support
F The World Heritage
Fund, created in 1972 by
the Convention, receives its
income essentially from
compulsory contributions from
States Parties amounting to 1 per
cent of their UNESCO duesand
voluntary contributions. Other
sources of income include funds-
in-trust donated by countries for
specific purposes and profits
derived from sales of World
Heritage products.
The total amount received each
year is just under $3 million, a
modest sum considering the
magnitude of the task. The onus is



very much on the World Heritage
Committee to allocate funding
according to the urgency of the
request, which is why priority is
necessarily given to the most
threatened sites, including those
listed as World Heritage in Danger.
The World Heritage Fund
assists the States Parties in
identifying and preserving World
Heritage sites. The work of
preparation, conservation and
preservation is expensive and not
all requests for international
assistance can be met from the
World Heritage Fund. The World
Heritage Committee applies
stringent conditions, and requests
have to fall into clearly defined
categories: preparatory assistance,
technical co-operation, emergency
assistance, and training.

A portion of the World
Heritage Fund is allocated to
States Parties on their request to
help them prepare periodic
reports on the condition of listed
sites. These reports, prepared on a
voluntary basis, are a crucial part
of World Heritage conservation.
They enable the Committee to
assess the conditions of the sites
and facilitate its decision-making.
The reports also make possible the
development of specific training
and other programmes aimed at
resolving recurrent problems in
site conservation.
Another essential task is
building awareness about the
World Heritage Convention and
its aims. This takes two forms:
promoting the World Heritage
concept, with information for the
general public or specific interest
groups, and developing teaching
programmes and educational
materials for use in schools and
universities. The two are
complementary, since materials
produced for promotion can also
be used for education.
Who does what?
The General Assembly
includes all States Parties to the
Convention. It meets once every
two years during the ordinary
session of UNESCO's General
Conference to elect the World
Heritage Committee, to examine
the statement of accounts of the
World Heritage Fund and decide
on major policy issues.
The World Heritage Committee
is responsible for the
implementation of the World
Heritage Convention and has the
final say on whether a site is
accepted for inscription on the
World Heritage List. It also
examines reports on the state of
conservation of listed sites, and
asks States Parties to take action
when sites are not being properly
managed. The Committee is also
responsible for allocating finance



from the World Heritage Fund
for sites in need of repair or
restoration, for emergency action
if sites are in immediate danger,
for providing technical assistance
and training, and for promotional
and educational activities. The
Committee, which meets in
December each year, consists of
representatives from 21 of the
States Parties to the Convention.
Members are elected during the
UNESCO General Conference for
six-year terms of office. Seven
members of the Committee make
up the World Heritage Bureau, a
smaller executive body that
prepares the work of the
Committee.
The Unesco World Heritage Centre
was set up in 1992 to assure the
day-to-day management of the
Convention. It organizes the
annual sessions of the Bureau and
Committee, provides advice to
States Parties in the preparation of
site nominations, organizes
technical assistance upon request,
and co-ordinates both reporting
on the condition of sites and the
emergency action undertaken
when a site is threatened. It is also
responsible for the
administration of the World
Heritage Fund. Other tasks of the
Centre include arranging technical
seminars and workshops,
updating the World Heritage List
and database, developing teaching
materials to raise awareness of the
World Heritage concept, and
keeping the public informed of
World Heritage issues. It co¬
operates with other groups
working on issues related to
conservation both within
UNESCOnotably the Cultural
Heritage Division in the Sector
for Culture, and the Division of
Ecological Sciences in the Science
Sector and on the outside,
notably the three Advisory
Bodies (ICOMOS,IUCN,
ICCROM), and other
international organizations such
as the Organization of World
Heritage Cities (OWHC) and the
International Council of
Museums (ICOM).
