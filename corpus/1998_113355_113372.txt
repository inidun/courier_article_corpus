It is a familiar sight to the residents of Madras
and other big Indian cities. Oblivious of the
scorching sun, scores of young people stand
in long queues outside the United States consu-
l ate waiting for their turn to be interv i e we d .
M a ny of them are students wishing to go to their
dreamland for higher studies, if possible for a
b right future too. While some of them manage
to get visas, o t h e rs fail to convince the consulat e
o f f i c i a l s.
Three decades ago it was regarded as an
exceptional achievement for an Indian to study
a b r o a d . To d ay, the phenomenon is much more
widespread and hundreds of students leave India
looking for higher qualific ations and greener pas-
tures in North A m e rica and in Europe. “ E ve ry
year the US consulates in India gi ve visas to
nearly 1,500 students to pursue higher studies
in A m e rican unive rs i t i e s ,” s ays an official at the
United States Embassy in New Delhi.
Though India has more than 260 unive rs i-
t i e s , c o m p rising nearly 8,200 colleges, it has
often been claimed that the standard of higher
e d u c ation has not kept pace with change. “ T h e r e
is no point in doing research in India. The lack of
u p - t o - d ate facilities and funding forces students
to come to the United Stat e s ,” s ays V i rul A c h a-
rya , a researcher at New York Unive rs i t y. A c a d e-
mics point out that the educational system in
India was set up during the British era and only
minor changes have been made to it since then.
M o r e ove r , in the post-independence peri o d ,
emphasis was laid on the humanities at the
expense of other disciplines. E d u c ational institu-
t i o n s , most of them stat e - a i d e d , suffered heav i l y
from federal budget cutbacks over the ye a rs , a n d



India’s loss, West’s gain
For many in India, a diploma from the North represents a
passport to financial and social success

according to A c h a rya there has been complete
s t a g n ation in higher research since the 1970s.
“Most Indian colleges do not even have the
I n t e rn e t ,” he say s.
Helped by their predecessors , Indian students
carefully select which institution to apply to, for a
place in a reputed college or unive rsity assures
them of a lucrat i ve job after their cours e . M a ny of
them are recruited at campus interviews conduc-
ted by multinational companies. For those who
decide to return home, a well-paid job could be
hard to fin d , as few companies in India offer high
s a l a ri e s. “I came here to do my studies in com-
p u t e rs and I got a job the day after the cours e
was ove r ,” s ays Raj Lokaiya n , a computer-profes-
sional turned businessman living in New Yo r k .“ I
am sure in India I would have had to wait for
m o n t h s , m aybe ye a rs , to find a suitable job.”
A golden highway 
to Silicon Valley
Whereas in the early 1970s large numbers of
Indian students went to the United States to
study medicine, the most popular subject today
is inform ation technology, f o l l owed by bu s i n e s s
a d m i n i s t r at i o n . According to India A b r o a d, a n
ethnic Indian weekly published in the United
S t at e s , there are nearly 35,000 Indian computer
professionals in Californ i a ’s Silicon Valley alone.
“Some of them have started their own companies
and are doing ve ry we l l ,” s ays Niraj Tri ve d i , a
j o u rnalist working with the magazine.
Indian students who go to the US and
Europe are not necessarily ri c h . Most hail from
middle-class fa m i l i e s , which seek higher social
s t atus by sending their children abroad. It is
impossible for a middle-income group fa m i l y
with a yearly income of $3,600 to send their chil-
dren abroad for studies which cost at least
$5,000 a ye a r. H e r e , the low-interest educat i o n a l
loans (up to $15,000) offered by Indian banks
come in handy. Studies in India cost ve ry little,
since most of the institutions are gove rn m e n t -
f u n d e d , causing some to denounce the brain
drain caused when students use the nat i o n ’s
resources for their initial studies and then
m i gr ate to other countries lat e r.
In the past, B ritish unive rsities at t r a c t e d
m a ny Indian students because of historical links
b e t ween the two countri e s. A m e rican unive rs i-
ties took over in the early 1970s following a dras-
tic cut in the number of scholarships in Bri t a i n .
They were the obvious altern at i ve because of the
language and the higher level of educat i o n . A l l
the same, a 1997 UNESCO study noted that
India only ranked seventh among the countri e s
sending students abroad, well behind such smal-
ler countries as the Republic of Korea and
M a l ay s i a .
Indian students wishing to study abroad fa c e
m a ny hurdles since visa restrictions have been
tightened by the US and Europe since the early
1 9 9 0 s. Some of them opt for less expensive uni-
ve rsities in Australia or Russia. “The number of
students coming to the US has dropped in the
last few ye a rs ,” s ays V i rul A c h a rya . “ H owe ve r , i f
they want higher qualific ations they have to come
to the US or Europe as Indian unive rsities lag
far behind.” ■
