In the past, the
Unesco Courier
has often given coverage
to questions relating to
the environment and
natural resources, fields
in which Unesco has
been active ever since it
was founded. Now, at a
time of growing concern
about environmental
problems, we intend to
publish from time to time
reports on the major
issues involved.

Our small blue planet
BY MICHEL BATISSE
HaIardly a day goes by without
bringing news of an environmental
problem of some kind. What with pol¬
luted rivers, disappearing animal spe¬
cies, oil spills in Alaska and the
destruction of the Amazonian rain¬
forest, something always seems to
be going wrong in the sphere of what
we often rather inaccurately refer to
as ecology. We are overwhelmed by
this constant avalanche of threats
and disruptions. We are not sure how
important the problems really are
and sometimes even wonder
whether they exist. In many cases
the scientists seem uncertain of their
ground and, to the delight of scep¬
tics, their opinions diverge.
Many people claim that they are
ready to help safeguard the environ¬
ment but most of them change their
tune as soon as there is any possi¬
bility that they may have to alter their
habits. Whenever there is a problem,
people tend to blame the govern¬
ment or industry, the rich or the poor,
often their neighbours but never
themselves. Media sensationalism
diverts attention from the delicate
long-term processes that cause the
most significant changes in our com¬
plex world. Faced with this mass of
MICHEL BATISSE,
French engineer and physicist, is
internationally known for his work on
the environment and natural resources.
A former Unesco staff member, he was
instrumental in launching the
International Hydrological Decade
(1965-1974) and Unesco's
interdisciplinary Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) programme Currently a
consultant with Unesco and with the
United Nations Environment
Programme, he has headed the Blue
Plan Regional Activity Centre for the
Mediterranean at Sophia Antipolis,
France, since it was created in 1985.
highly diversified and widespread en¬
vironmental problems, we feel that
they are linked in some way but
how?
Misunderstanding of the underly¬
ing causes of the environmental
problems that face both industrial¬
ized and developing countries leads
to a certain intellectual confusion.
Piecemeal measures in specific sit¬
uations are only partially effective
and even sometimes make the situ¬
ation worse, but do not provide a last¬
ing solution.
A far-reaching concept
The concept of the environment is so
vast that we are often inclined to nar¬
row it down. It is not confined to air
and water pollution and the protec¬
tion of nature. When we talk about
the environment we refer to every¬
thing around usthe homes and
workplaces where we spend most of
our time and the cities in which more
than half the world's population now
lives. It also englobes the country
side, forests, countries, oceans,
deserts and ultimately the planet as
a whole which, as we now realize, is
being adversely affected by human
activity. The environment is thus not
only the so-called natural areas,
which have themselves often been
shaped to some extent by our ances¬
tors, but the man-made locations in
which most people live and work.
This physical environment is objec¬
tive in the sense that it can be ob¬
served and measured. Its functioning
and development can be analysed by
such sciences as chemistry, geolo¬
gy and biology (especially by ecolo¬
gy, the branch of biology which deals
with the relations between living
creatures and their habitat). We are
all part of this objective environment,
and we all perceive it in our own
necessarily subjective way. What one
person regards as an excessive
degree of pollution, another may find
acceptable. Such perceptions,
whether individual or collective, play
an important role in determining both

individual behaviour and the action
taken by public institutions, since
they shape our spontaneous reac¬
tions to our physical environment
and determine the hierarchy of
values we attach to its component
parts. Hunting wild animals, for ex¬
ample, has been regarded in differ¬
ent ways by different cultures at
different times.
Debates about the environment
are often difficult for objective rea¬
sons since they involve conflicts of
material interest. They are complicat¬
ed still further by the widely differ¬
ent emotional and cultural reactions
of those who take part. This is
another reason why we should try to
find a common cause.
Biosphere and technosphere
It will be a long time before we know
whether forms of life exist in distant
galaxies. All the life we know today
is confined to what is known as the
biospherethe Earth's surface and
the thin atmospheric envelope
around it. The biosphere includes all
the living creatures on land, in the
sea and in the lower atmosphere, and
all the exchanges and bio-geo-
chemical processes that make life on
Earth possible. As biological crea¬
tures we inescapably form part of it.
Assaults on the biosphere may well
affect us, and especially our health.
Ever since the dawn of time the bi¬
osphere has been a prey to natural
phenomena such as earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions. Today,
however, the most damaging attacks
are of human origin. For a very long
time our only strength was that of hu¬
man muscle, but in the last few cen¬
turies as a result of advances in
scientific knowledge we have learned 47

to master increasingly powerful tech¬
nologies. In the last few decades our
technical knowledge in agriculture,
industry and medicine and in such
diverse fields as genetics, energy,
transport and health care has spread
worldwide and encompassed almost
the whole of the biosphere. This
phenomenon, which may be called
the technosphere, is a dense and
multi-faceted network of technology
from which no place on Earth can to¬
tally escape, not even the Antarctic
which is affected by air pollution and
the intrusion of tourists and oil-
tankers.
We use these technologies in what
we consider to be our own interests,
the interests of the group to which
we belong, or those of mankind as
a whole. The consequences of this
intelligent use of geographical space,
natural resources and the process¬
es of life itself have been demo¬
graphic growth, the improvement of
living conditions, and the flowering
of modern civilization the process
which is rather loosely described as
development. The fruits of this
process are irreplaceable and it is
inconceivable that they should be
rejected wholesale. At the same time,
however, the structure and function¬
ing of the biosphere are being
affected by a number of unexpected
and perverse consequences of this
massive use of technology. Of
course the more powerful the effects
of technology and the more widely
it is used, the more the biosphere
suffers.
Sociosphere and noosphere
An environmental problem may be
defined as an assault of some kind by
the technosphere on the biosphere.
Such problems may include soil ero¬
sion, desertification, deforestation,
toxic wastes, acid rain, the possibili¬
ty of global warming, risks of cancer,
high noise levels, deterioration of the
urban environment and indeed of any
phenomenon that affects the human
race. The development process has
brought undoubted benefits but,
through inadvertence or negligence,
it is having increasingly important
negative effects on the biosphere
and on mankind which biologically
forms part of the biosphere. The de¬
terioration of the environment is sim¬
ply the other side of the development
coin, the negative side which has
long been ignored.
The technosphere and develop¬
ment are not, however, autonomous.
They are the products of another
sphere, the sociosphere, which con¬
sists of the legal, political, econom¬
ic, social and professional institutions
that constitute human society. The
sociosphere uses and disseminates
technology. It is responsible for the
choice of different forms of develop
ment. Through the development of
the global economy it is slowly im¬
posing a system of planetary
management. And so the sociosphere
is responsible for safeguarding the
environment.
How are decisions taken in the so¬
ciosphere? This is a somewhat
opaque area where rational analysis
is not always possible. It belongs to
another sphere, the world of ideas,
which may be termed the noosphere,
and from which cultures, religions
and civilizations are derived. It is at
this level that, in some mysterious
way, our perceptions, behaviour and
aspirations about development and
the environment are shaped.
This method of studying environ¬
mental problems by working back¬
wards from effects to causes shows
that all environmental problems have
common origins. It also suggests
that we should try to reestablish the
harmony of the four spheres.
The four pillars of wisdom
Every society organizes its own ter¬
ritory in accordance with its tradi¬
tions and resources, as if organizing
a big household. Each house rests on
four pillars, population (the number
of people living in it), natural
resources (the goods and services
that can be taken from nature using
available technology), the environ¬
ment (in its physical sense) and eco-

nomic and social development. If one
pillar rises disproportionately, the
house loses its balance. A critical sit¬
uation soon arises, as we saw recent¬
ly in the Sahel, where too many
people are overburdening a shrink¬
ing resource base and the environ¬
ment is suffering as a result of
inappropriate forms of development.
With today's global markets and
the speed of modern transport and
communications systems, the whole
planet is our common home. Condi¬
tions are not the same for everyone,
far from it, but everyone is involved
in the same process. The pillars sup¬
porting our common home are start¬
ing to lean sideways. The population
pillar is still rising dangerously, espe¬
cially in the poor countries, and is un¬
likely to stop doing so as long as their
poverty persists. The development
pillar has become a pattern of fran¬
tic consumption of space, energy
and goods according to a develop¬
ment model that was invented by the
rich countries and is not applicable
to humanity at large. Resources such
as water and food can barely keep
pace with population growth and de¬
velopment needs. They only manage
to do so to the detriment of the
fourth pillar, the environment, which
is under attack from all sidesby
dams, fertilizers, pesticides, forest
destruction, soil exhaustion and pol¬
lution of all kinds, and at the global
! ' u>-
%
level the climate and the ozone lay¬
er are being affected.
Everyone who has thought about
the matter agrees that it is high time
we put our house in order. But not
everyone agrees about how we
should approach the task since in
terms of the distribution of wealth all
are not on the same footing. The in¬
dustrialized countries ask the coun¬
tries of the South to slow down their
demographic growth and take care
of their environment. The poor coun¬
tries reply that inequalities in terms
of trade must first of all be reduced
so that they too can develop, and be¬
fore the poorest peoples can enjoy
the leisure to protect forests and
animals. This difficult debate in which
each side sends the ball back into the
other's court has made only slow
progress in the last twenty years.
Today however there is a widespread
feeling that "our common future" is
at stake and that long-term models
for the development of the environ¬
ment and natural resources must be
worked out as quickly as possible.
This new climate of opinion is en¬
couraging and we must hope that the
United Nations Conference on the
Environment and Development
scheduled to take place in Brazil in
June 1992 will lay the foundations
for an agreement on this question of
vital importance for all the inhabi¬
tants of our small blue planet. Major
changes will have to be made in the
sociosphere and the noosphere and
these will not be easily accepted by
everyone. In the coming months the
Unesco Courier will be examining
some of the key issues involved in
this great debate.
