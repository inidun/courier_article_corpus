BRAZIL
Land of Harmony
For all Races ?
THE traveller who visits Bahia,
the great Brazilian"Negro
Metropolis", comes away with
two apparently contradictory
impressions. On the one hand
he is struck by the obvious multiplicity
of African survivals which have so
deeply marked the life of the city, and
on the other, by the small number of
really"black"Negroes he meets, even
in the most crowded quarters.
While nearly all Bahia's population
is"coloured", the inter-marriage
between Whites, Indians and Negroes
has created an original type which
may ultimately develop in this part of
the world as a new race.
To anyone familiar with the voodoo
cults of Haiti, there is nothing more
strange than to witness their Bra-
zilian counterparts. The orixa. (spirit
gods), the rites, the songs are almost
the same, and if they differ from those
of Haiti, it is only that they have a
more distinctly African flavour. For
at Bahia, the African coast is distant
neither in time nor space. Yet Baba-
lorixa (priests), maes de santo
(priestesses) and S ! has de santo (ser-
vants of the god) are sometimes so
light in colour that it is difficult to
consider them as Negroes.
It is in this extraordinary mixture
that the racial tendencies which have
prevailed since colonial times are most
clearly seen in Brazil. They are also
exemplified by a famous anecdote told
by Henry Koster, an English traveller
in the 19th century. When he asked
one of his friends whether a certain
Capitao-mor (provincial military gov-
ernor) was a mulatto or not, he re-
ceived the following reply :"He was a
mulatto once, But now he is not."On
being asked to explain this, his friend
exclaimed in surprise :"How can a
Capitao-mer be a mulatto ?"
True Heirs Of Portugal
THIS story sums up the essential
difference in attitude towards
the race problem in Brazil and
in some parts of the Anglo-
Saxon world. While, in the United
States and South Africa, coloured peo-
ple are classed as Negroes, even if they
have only a little negro blood, in Bra-
zil it is a person's social position which
counts much more than the colour of
his skin. In this respect, the Brazil-
ians are true heirs of the Portuguese
who never attached much importance
to race and who inter-married freely
with all the native peoples they con-
quered and colonized.
In the Portuguese colonies, and later
in the Brazilian Empire, the slaves'lot
was usually easier than in the French
or English colonies, for religious and
legal traditions favoured the slaves
and tended to respect their human
dignity.
Colour Is No Barrier
As far back as the 18th century,
there were numerous examples
of the rapid rise of mulattos
and of the important part they
played in Brazilian society. They be-
came in fact.  kind of middle class
between the black slaves and the
whites. For although the imperial
regime maintained slavery it never-
theless favoured the mulattos and
opened up the liberal professions to
them. The most intelligent took
advantage of this opportunity and
won distinction and honour in their
careers.
Many are the distinguished Brazi-
lians who were coloured and who
elsewhere would have been subjected
to all the drawbacks of racial dis-
crimination. This rise of the mulatto
to the highest intellectual and poli-
tical positions continues even today,
and if, as it is said, a former Brazi-
lian President, Nilo Peçanha had
Negro blood in his veins, then here is
an example of 8. coloured man reach-
ing the very top of the social ladder.
Colour, in Brazil, is not the barrier
it is in some parts of the United
States. This is proved by the steady
absorption of the dark elements by
those with lighter skins As Donald
Pierson points out in his book"Ne-
groes in Brazil", the whites absorb
the mulattos, and the mulattos absorb
the Negroes, and this is recognized
and accepted by public opinion.
But it would be misleading to try
to paint an rover-simplified picture of
the race situation in Brazil. Though
inter-racial marriages are frequent.
they occur between individuals of the
from an unskilled proletariat deserting
the countryside to answer the call of
an expanding industry.
same social class and rarely take
place between people at the opposite
ends of the colour scale.
Good Things That Are Black
RAIL, it is true, provides an
example of a country where rel-
ations between the races are
relatively harmonious. It would
be an exaggeration, however, to claim
that race prejudice is unknown. Some
Brazilian writers have expressed
racial pessimism with regard to the
Negroes. In Brazilian folklore, too,
one finds a series of racial proverbs
with disparaging undertones. A well
known song reveals this latent pre-
judice :
Negro era 0 olhar de Marina,
E a barba de Sao losé
So branco nao qué Ie prete,
Mulato tambem naG qué.
It tells of a Negro who lists all the
good things that are black-coffee,
the fruit of the jaboticaba tree, Mary's
eyes and St Joseph's beard, but who
notes, ironically, that"nevertheless,
neither the white man nor the mulatto
want to be black'.
These taunts do not prevent the
ordinary people from getting on
together in spite of colour differences,
but as one examines the higher end
of the social scale, the signs of race
prejudice become more numerous.
They are never expressed cynically, but
rest upon tacit conventions-almost
"gentlemen's agreements", concluded
to the disadvantage of the Negroes.
Another shadow is cast over the
traditional picture of racial relations
in Brazil by the growth of an un-
mistakable racialism among the
working classes of cities like Saa
Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. Its origins
are economic, for it expresses the
white workers'fear of competition
Confusion Of Class And Colour
APPEARANCES, however, can be
deceptive. Statements made in
racial terms are often only the
expression of a class feeling.
Owing to the comparatively recent
emancipation. of slaves-in 1888-
the coloured people still belong chiefiy
to the lower classes of urban and rural
workers. It is for this reason that the
idea of colour is so often associated
with the common people in Brazil.
Thus a coloured person of small means,
lacking refinement (in manners or
taste) may have to endure a certain
amount of disdain, yet by the same
token a rich or educated negro can
become"white".
Negroes and mulattos have expressed
their bitterness and disappointment in
racial terms, but their protests are
aimed, in fact, at social not racial
inequality. If the coloured man feels
disappointed or cheated, it is not so
much because he was born black, but
because he belongs to a poor class and
has been unable to get an education,
one of the first steps towards social
betterment in Brazil.
Although everything may not be
perfect in the matter of Brazilian race
relations, the frictions described here
are not likely to raise serious problems
in the future. Racial prejudice, if it
exists at all, is condemned by the
country's sores and is considered con-
trary to the ideals which inspire not
only Brazilians but Americans in
general. But the force of tradition has
made it easier to solve the dilemma
in Brazil. The Brazilian intellectuals
are proud of the racial democracy
which they have brought about, and no
candidate for public office today would
dare express racial feelings.
A Queen Set The Example
THE Brazilian Government has
always opposed racial prejudice
- *-and discriminati n. Ev  at the
time of the Empire, when
slavery still existed, it was considered
improper to display such prejudice.
The experience of a famous mulatto
architect, André Rebouça, illustrates
this clearly. He was invited one day
to a Court Ball given by King
Pedro n, but instead of mingling with
the other guests, he remained standing
alone near a window in evident em-
barrassment. The Empress, noticing
this, crossed the noor, smiled at him
and asked him to dance with her.
It is because of this whole set of
circumstances that Unesco recently
began a full, on-the-spot study of the
various factors-social, economic and
anthropological-which condition
race relations in Brazil today. The
eagerness shown by the Brazilian
sociologists working with Unesco to
explore all favourable and unfavoura-
ble aspects of the question alike,
shows the feeling of confidence with
which Brazilians everywhere regard
the racial situation in their country.
