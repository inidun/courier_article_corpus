THE MAKING OF THE
FIRST PEACE PIPE
MM HE Couher recency received a pho-tograph of the drawing reproduced
here from Miss Clarice Johnstone,
Lady Principal of Nelson Girls'College,
Nelson, New Zealand.
Miss Johnstone wrote :"Early this year
you published an Indian Folk Tale,'The
Making of the First Peace Pipe'. I used
this in a peace talk to the girls of my Col-
lege on Anzac Day, April 25th. The story
inspired one of them, Angela Grace
(16 years) to attempt a'black and white'
illustration. As you published the story
which, incidently, made a deep impres-
sion, I wondered whether you would care
to print the picture in the Courier."
The story published in the Courier was
one of a series-'Children's Stories for
Peace"-collected from all parts of the
world by Unesco's Radio Division. Its
theme was that the best way to settle dis-
putes is to sit down and talk things over.
The drawing made by Angela Grace is
an appropriate illustration for the message
of United Nations Day this year-"There
Shall Be Peace"-and is reproduced here
in the hope of promoting just such feelings
as the young artist has so well expressed.
