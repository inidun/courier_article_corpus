In the historic centre of
Prague (Czech
Republic), which was
included on the World
Heritage List in 1992, the
force of the floodwaters
caused the collapse of
several buildings



of the floods

S everal monuments like this
church  in Prague’s historic
centre suffered badly
Restoration began in Prague’s
Smetana Museum as soon as
the floodwaters began to subside

“I
n Dessau (home of the Bauhaus School),
where the Mulde and Elbe Rivers come
together, we’re used to floods. But this year
was catastrophic,” says Christine Lambrecht, the
vice-president of the Association of German World
Heritage Sites. 
Response to the disaster was immediate: “the
solidarity was incredible”. Thousands of firemen and
citizens, of all ages and from all walks of life,
worked side by side to evacuate the basements of the
city’s monuments and pile sandbags to hold back
the raging waters.
This spontaneous and generalized mobilization
saved Dessau from the worst.
However, other European cities hit by last August’s
floods, did not fare so well. Despite the valiant
efforts of the inhabitants, many places –
particularly in the Czech Republic – were severely
damaged. 
From the outset, UNESCO called on the
international community to help reconstitute and
restore the archives, libraries and other cultural
properties that had been devastated.
To facilitate the task, an information site has been
opened on the internet to guide those who wish to
offer their support to the worst hit cultural
institutions. It can be visited at:

A few days after the flooding had reached its height,
UNESCO’s photo bank sent photographer
Niamh Burke to record the damage at sites included
on the World Heritage List, and some that would like
to be.

Many of the works in
Dresden’s Museum
were saved just in time by being
transported to the building’s
upper floors
This work was found some
30 kilometres from its home in
Prague’s Kampa Museum of Modern
Art, which, on the banks of the 
Vltava River, was especially hard hit
