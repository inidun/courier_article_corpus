The great poet and president of Senegal,
Léopold Sédar Senghor, said that by
using the word “ s t e p,”the Europeans had
turned dance into an abstract game “to
take man off the earth and project him
into the sky.”Africans prefer the expres-
sion “basic movement,” because it implies
a connection between the dancer and the
earth.A famous verse by the same poet
perfectly expresses this symbiotic rela-
tionship between human beings and the
earth beneath them: “ We are dancing
people whose feet are revitalized by
stamping them on the hard ground.”
The first of the ten basic movements,
which I have observed in all the regions
and among all the peoples of A f r i c a , is the
d o o p l é. This is a composite term bor-
rowed from Oueoulou, the secret lan-
guage of the glaé, a community of mask
bearers belonging to the Wêon people,
who live in western Côte d’Ivoire. G l a
(the singular of glaé) means mask in the
African sense of the term, in other words
the costume, the accessories and those
who wear them. I have chosen the lan-
guage of this community of wisdom
masks (in Africa,the mask is considered
a living entity) because it is sacred,spiri-
t u a l , divine and, as a result, belongs to
no single group of people. Furthermore,
the Wêon (also known as the Guéré) are
the guardians of the only g l a é p r a y e r,
whose content clearly expresses the com-
bined spiritual, technical and structural
aspects of dance.
In Oueoulou, d o o means mortar and p l é,
p e s t l e. These are cooking utensils
common to every part of Africa and
occupy a central place in everyday life.
The movement of a person using a pestle
is the basis of African dance. On the one
h a n d , the pestle pounding the mortar
produces sounds, percussion, a beat—in
short,music. On the other hand,the up-
and-down movement of the plé beating
against the doo makes it shake, tremble,
move—in other words,d a n c e.So the d o o
becomes a musical instrument, the plé a
dancing object and the person doing the
pounding, a composer.
Dance conveys our vision of the world
and conditions our entire existence. I t s
basic movements are all symbolically
c h a r g e d . They express a person’s rela-
tionship to the Earth, to God, to the com-
munity of the living and that of the dead.
Each movement also has a specific mea-
n i n g : dancing in a bent-over position with
arms folded over the chest is a symbol of
i n i t i a t i o n ; stamping feet on the ground
is a show of extreme joy; tapping fore-
heads against each other is an act of com-
munion.Dance is thus a coded language
that creates a dialogue between dancers
and spectators familiar with its under-
lying symbolism, signifying that it cannot
be measured against Western standards
despite frequent attempts to do exactly
that.In African dance, for example, sho-
wing two open hands is a sign of honesty,
clear conscience and hospitality. I n
contemporary dance, the same g e s t u r e
symbolizes the density of the air that the
artist embraces or pushes away. Jo i n i n g
the palms of two hands together is a gesture
of prayer in the Christian world.For A f r i-
c a n s,h o w e v e r, it is a way of concentrating
all the body’s energy,the right hand having
a negative polarity and the left, a posi-
tive polarity. The symbolism of these
movements is rooted in an ethical, aes-
thetic and social context that cannot be
ignored if one wants to grasp the full
meaning of African dance.And even less
so if one wants to judge it. ■

In Africa, dance and the
economy are intrinsically
connected: the origins of the
dooplé, the first of ten basic
movements in African dance, lie
in the motion of using 
the pestle
Dance is a coded
language that creates
a dialogue between
dancers and spectators
familiar with its
underlying symbolism
TELL ME HOW YOU DANCE A N D
I’LL TELL YOU WHO YOU A R E
Doing the dooplé: with a straight back,knees
bent and each foot planted firmly on the
ground,rise and bend as if pounding a mortar
and pestle to the beat of the music.
