Quizás tu nombre
salve/Et si ten nom
sauvait*
A bilingual anthology of
Salvadorian poetry. Poems
selected and translated by
Maria Poumier. 452 pp.
Editorial Universitaria de El
Salvador/UNESCO. (Bilingual,
Spanish/French).
This anthology of Salvadorian
poetry is mainly devoted to the
twentieth century and more than
half of the contributors are still
alive. Although the country's verse
is relatively little-known, it "has
contributed to Central American
literature through outstanding per¬
sonalities", as the essayist and poet
Roberto Armijo, himself a contrib¬
utor, points out in a foreword.
These personalities include Don
Francisco Gavidia, a major figure of
the Modernist era, luan Cotto, a
forerunner of the avant-garde, and
two lyric poets of great intensity,
Claudia Lars and Roque Dalton
all of whom are featured in the
anthology. The major themes here
are the exploration of the Salvado¬
rian soul; the search for a personal
voice; identification with the
"absent homeland"; myth and
reality; and reaction against major
trends in Western poetry such as
symbolism and surrealism. The
anthology culminates in the work
of the so-called Generación Com¬
prometida, the "Committed Gen¬
eration". There is a dynamic
ambivalence in these poets' use of
words, which combines an aware¬
ness of their beauty with a mistrust
of aestheticism, as there is in the
contrast between the lyricism of
their language and the primitive
harshness of their imagery. The
principal preoccupations are polit¬
ical commitment and the com¬
promises life imposes. The title
means "Perhaps your name may
save", the name in question being
that of El Salvador itself, which has
the power of a magical incantation
and evokes a universal land, at one
and the same time global and local,
that ultimately exists only in the
human heart.
L'Epopée de Samba
Gueladiégui
Recounted by Panel
Mamadou Baila and
translated into French by
Amadou Ly. 200 pp. Editions
Nouvelles du Sud, IFAN and
Unesco (in French).
This daarol (epic) in the Peul lan¬
guage is one of west Africa's most
famous oral narratives, and four
versions of it have already been
published. Historical rather than
mythological in form, in the
manner of the chanson de geste, it
tells the story of the rift between
its Tukulor hero and his uncle
Konko, who refuses to give him his
share of an inheritance. From the
tale emerges a portrait of the life
and customs of the Denianke Peul
before the eighteenth-century rev¬
olution duringwhich the Muslims
imposed their rule and their faith.
Daarol, or haala (historical epics),
are eclectic works in which ver¬
sions ofan original tale told by past
storytellers traces of whose
wording are retained are incor¬
porated into the interpretation (a
more accurate word would be per¬
formance) given to it by a contem¬
porary gawlo, or griot, in this case
Pahel Mamadou Baila. In this epic
the gawlo Sewi is at Samba's side
throughout his quest. His presence

is important as an illustration of
the griot's role in African social his¬
tory and is particularly striking in
view of Pahel's claims to descent
from Sewi further proof, if any
were needed, of the profound sym¬
biosis between story and story¬
teller. The Epopée de Samba
Guéladiégui is a seminal work in
its genre.
Old Czech Legends.
Alois Jirásek.
Translated with an
Introduction and Glossary
by Marie K. Holecek.
199 pp.
Forest Books/UNESCO.
(In English).
This collection ofold Czech leg¬
ends was originally intended for
children, but parents may enjoy it
even more, now that so many
people are concerned about
preservation of the cultural her¬
itage in all its forms. Alois lirásek, a
student and teacher of history,
wrote popular historical novels
similar in spirit to those of Sir
Walter Scott, who inspired the
Romantic movement in Western
literature at the start of the nine¬
teenth century. Readers familiar
with European folklore, especially
that of central and eastern Europe,
will find in these stories motifs and
themes that also appear in Russian
tales. The legends are here retold by
Jirásek in the rather formal style,
imbued with romantic and nation¬
alist ardour, typical of the "national
awakening" that fired central and
eastern European cultures and
peoples in the nineteenth century.
The book is divided into five parts:
"Old Czech Legends"; "Legends of
Christian Times"; "Tales of Old
Praha"; "Some Myths of the Middle
Ages"; and "Ancient Prophecies".
Each represents a different facet of
Bohemian society or history. The
tales are a seamless blend of
romanticized historical facts and
romantic or baroque fantasy,
whose period charm encourages
rather than hinders the reader from
interpreting them on several levels.
For example, two symbolic figures
of the post-nuclear world, Faust
and the Golem, feature in them.
Ghosts, witches, mythical animals
and magical objects intervene in
the struggles of men against their
fate. With the apparently naive
symbolism of folk wisdom, the sto¬
ries echo what many modern
thinkers say in tortuous and com¬
plex ways: that the world of
tomorrow will be multicultural.
Note: These three books form part
of the UNESCO Collection of
Representative Works.
