The former mayor of the
Colombian city of
A p a r t a d ó , who has faced
many threats to her life,
appeals to social
movements and the
international community
for support in
o v e rcoming violence and
c o n fli c t
Why did Apartadó become an extremely
violent city in the early 1990s?
The first thing to bear in mind is the
context of the confli c t . A civil war has been
going on in Colombia for the past fifty ye a rs.
For a va riety of historical and economic rea-
s o n s , the Urubá region in which A p a rtadó is
l o c ated is extremely vulnerable.The arri val of
g u e rrilla and paramilitary groups triggered a
process of extortion and killings, and the
r e gion soon became ungove rnable (see box ) .
A ve ry significant development came in 1991
w h e n , as a result of negotiations on political
r ather than social issues, the guerrillas of the
Popular Liberation A rmy (EPL) laid dow n
their arms—as the M-19 movement had done
p r e v i o u s l y. This meant that there was no
social amnesty, either on the part of the lan-
d ow n e rs , the community or political gr o u p s.
How did you come to be mayor of
A p a r t a d ó ?
Violence reached a critical level in 1994,
when the guerrillas decreed that nobody
could stand as a candidate in the municipal
e l e c t i o n s. Only two days before election day,
scheduled for 24 August 1994, the Cat h o l i c
church brought together political organiza-
tions and urged them to take part in the
d e m o c r atic process and not to gi ve way to
the threat of arm s. Discussions began to
decide who should stand.A long list of names
was drawn up, but people were afraid. M y
name was put forward without any wa rn i n g .
There were a number of points in my favo u r:
I knew the region and its people, I was not a
member of any traditional political part y, I
was not an activist in any armed gr o u p, a n d
my approach to work was more technical
than political or part i s a n .The fourteen poli-
tical groups invo l ved reached agreement and
I became the sole consensus candidat e .
You were 34 at the time. Why did the 14
political leaders choose a woman—and a
woman so young—to occupy such an
exposed position in such a violent city?
I don’t think I was nominated because
they thought that a woman could do some-
thing more to solve the confli c t ; it was more
a question of their evading their political res-
ponsibility. In Latin America, a woman in
p ower is still regarded as inoffensive . She is
not expected to bring about fundamental
changes.A woman in a position of respon-
sibility is a figurehead rather than a political
d e c i s i o n - m a k e r. My election was therefore
more the outcome of a special situat i o n
than a planned gesture.When I started to
take a stand on certain issues, within a
month those 14 men left me stranded.
What sort of issues?
I had said that if I accepted the post of
m ayor I would do so without weapons or an
e s c o rt and that I would talk with all the
a rmed gr o u p s , whether they were guer-
ri l l a s ,p a r a m i l i t a ri e s , the army or the police.
This sparked off a reaction nat i o n w i d e
because mayors were not supposed to talk
with armed groups. I started out from the
p rinciple that you do not choose the people
you gove rn , you have to accept them for
what they are, even if they include people
who live beyond the frontiers of society.
There is no such thing as an ideal commu-
nity;every community has its conflicts.
As mayor, you took the lead in the ‘women
against violence’ movement.Did you
decide to surround yourself with women or
didn’t you find any men prepared to take
on the responsibility?
I didn’t recruit wo m e n : they were already
t h e r e ,but they could not express themselve s
because of the confli c t . It is not enough for
women to occupy key posts. E ve ry t h i n g
depends on our attitude to the roles society
e n t rusts to us. In Uru b á , the women used
to be silent. In those three ye a rs ,we began to
mobilize and recover our dignity, our vo i c e s
and our love for our land. But there was so
much death and violence that it was diffi-
cult for us to work out a political agenda.
W h at we could do was get together and, i n
the face of a war devised by men for control

of the country and the economy, m a k e
alliances to halt the killing of our menfolk.
And when I say “our menfolk”, I mean not
only wo r k e rs ,p e a s a n t s ,s o l d i e rs and police,
but also men in the armed groups operat i n g
outside the law, who are also sons,h u s b a n d s ,
l ove rs , men of the people.
During your term of office, 1,200 people
were assassinated and your life was
continually in danger. Were you ever
tempted to give up?
When they killed 17 of my colleagues,
when they slit the throat of a child in school
before my eye s , when I could feel death stal-
king the streets at night and I received threat s
by telephone, when I realized that eve ry b o d y
was a prisoner of fear, I did ask myself whe-
ther it was wo rth risking my life eve ry day.
There were two possibilities: either I could
run away and let all the people be engulfed in
t e rr o r , or else I could tell them: “The only
way out is for us to unite.”When someone
telephoned me and said “ We are going to
kill you at nine o’clock tonight,” I replied:
“ T h at still leaves me seven hours.”This wa s
not heroism. I preferred to live with my fear
r ather than burden the people with it and
let them go on enduring the violence of guns
with sadness and resignat i o n .
I believe in God. I also believe that we
must have sufficient strength to commit
ourselves. Such a commitment cannot be
made in words alone;we have to bear wit-
ness through our live s.The fact that I staye d
in A p a rtadó was not the act of a messiah
promising deliverance but an act of conv i c-
tion,so that my words matched my deeds.
What was your biggest disappointment
during your term of office?
In those three ye a rs , we sounded the
alarm. We used to say that if there was no
political reaction from the gove rnment and
if we did not obtain the support of the
i n t e rn ational community, the things that
were happening in Urabá’s 600 square kilo-
metres would spread to the whole of
C o l o m b i a . But denouncing the situat i o n
was not enough.
My main disappointment is that we did
not give more substance to our task, to all
the projects we started, especially in edu-
cation.Nor did we succeed in making eco-
nomic proposals for the region and in get-
ting the intern ational community more
i nvo l ved in local activities with children,
women and artists.
What is the situation in Apartadó like today?
The Urubá region is no longer a guer-
rilla stronghold but the paramilitaries are
present in considerable force.As long as an
illegal force controls public order,consoli-
dating the democratic process is a distant
p r o s p e c t . The state must regain its legi t i-
m a cy. Make no mistake: if this does not
come about,Urabá will collapse.
Are the government and the guerrilla
groups sincere in the current peace
negotiations?
We are living in a situation of mutual sus-
p i c i o n . The guerrilla groups mistrust the
g ove rn m e n t , the gove rnment mistrusts the
g u e rri l l a s , and civil society mistrusts both of
t h e m .
The defence of the terri t o ry is at stake.
Pa r a m i l i t a ry groups have managed to gain a
wide measure of control over a vast regi o n ,
while the guerrillas claim to be defending the
positions they now occupy, with more than
600 towns in their hands. H e n c e , we are no
longer witnessing guerrilla wa r fare but a tac-
tical struggle for position. In this sense, t h e
n e g o t i ations will invo l ve a new pat t e rn of land
d i s t ri bution and a far-reaching change in the
c o u n t ry ’s economic policies.
What can be expected of these
negotiations?
Neither the Revo l u t i o n a ry A rmed Fo r c e s
of Colombia ( FARC) nor the National Libe-
r ation A rmy (ELN) are talking of disbanding
or handing over their we a p o n s.Recent eve n t s
h ave shown the fragile nature of the peace
p r o c e s s. In October,70 people,most of them
c h i l d r e n , were killed in an ELN attack on an
oil pipeline running from Segovia to A n t i o-
q u i a .A few days later the paramilitaries ri p o s-
ted by marching into two villages that we r e
supposedly harbouring guerri l l a s ,m u r d e ri n g
30 people and abducting 40 others.T h e s e
were offences against humanity and viola-
tions of intern ational humanitarian law.T h e
a rmed groups are making it clear to us that
the negotiations in Colombia will take place
in a climate of confrontat i o n .
If the intern ational community does not
monitor this process in one way or another,
the Colombian conflict will get wo rs e .
Peace does not depend on President Pas-
trana or on the good will of isolated gr o u p s.

The right to risk
■ “Apartadó’s La Pasionaria”, “Urabá’s
Mother Courage”, “the mayor of
peace”—these were some of the headlines
t h at were used in the Colombian and inter-
n ational press to salute Gloria Cuartas Mon-
t oya when she ended her three-year term as
m ayor of A p a rt a d ó .C u a rtas presents hers e l f
simply as a social wo r k e r. Her invo l vement in
community work began when she was a pupil
at a Carmelite school in Antioquia prov i n c e
and continued at unive rs i t y, where she stu-
died sociology. She says she has always been
“ d ri ven by the need to know what lies behind
the blood and death and to understand the
social and human reasons for the civil wa r.”
S u p p o rted by an unshakable faith in
God and a belief in humanity, G l o ria Cuar-
tas succeeded in making one of the wo r l d ’s
most violent cities known as an example of
civil mobilization for peace.As mayor she
m ay have disappointed those who expec-
ted her to inaugurate public gardens and
highways, but as she says,“the roads to be
built in Apartadó were roads of solidarity,
and the gardens to be planted were those of
tolerance.” In a region where an untimely
word can be paid for with a bullet she tal-
ked to all the armed groups and claimed
the “right to risk”. She put her life in the
balance by refusing special protection, i n
order to show “that weapons could not go
on being a symbol of power or authority”.
C o nvinced that politics is only valid if it
has a “social mission”, she encouraged
Colombian university teachers, professio-
nals and artists to develop educational and
cultural activities so that Apartadó’s  chil-
dren could gr ow up in a climate of tole-
rance and their parents could learn to live
together peacefully. In a city of recent
immigrants,she tried to develop a sense of
collective identity and civic responsibility.
G l o ria Cuartas also made her vo i c e
heard outside her country and won intern a-
tional support for her policies. She told the
world what women were doing in Colom-
b i a ’s conflict areas, denounced human ri g h t s
v i o l ations before the European Pa r l i a m e n t ,
and convened an intern ational meeting in
A p a rtadó attended by women from seve r a l
wa r - t o rn countri e s. She won backing from
UN E S C O and the collaboration of many
NGOs and anonymous vo l u n t e e rs.
All these activities brought her threat s
from guerrillas and paramilitary groups in
Urabá (the Colombian army tried to hinder
her work on several occasions) but also reco-
gnition from her own country (Woman of the
Year in 1995, the Simón Bolívar Medal from
the Ministry of Education) and intern at i o-
nally when the first Mayo rs for Peace Pri z e
was awarded to her by the Director General
of UN E S C O in 1996.She is currently in Cara-
cas (Venezuela) where she is heading UN E S-
C O’s Cities for Peace network (see box ) .H e r
ambition is to contri bute to the advance of the
c u rrent peace negotiations in Colombia by a
“ c o n s t ru c t i ve dialogue”.“ F r e e d o m ”she say s ,
“ b e gins with generosity and self-abnegat i o n .”
■
ployment, poverty and social imbalances,
drug-trafficking is a very important factor,
since it has penetrated to the very roots of
political life and of the guerrilla and para-
military groups. Many peasants live in an
economy based on coca production.I find
it very difficult to envisage any other local
crop replacing this activity and being com-
p e t i t i ve . The FA R C , for example, c l a i m
they could help to reduce illegal cultiva-
tion, but this is not possible in the imme-
d i ate future because powerful economic
groups have created a whole market sys-
tem out of the drug.The United States has
proposed to the Colombian gove rn m e n t
t h at a “peace fund” should be set up
through the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), and one of the key items on its
agenda is the eradication of illicit crops.
This is a long-term problem, h owe ve r.
Any drastic measures could lead to further
conflicts.
Attempts to broker peace are not new to
Colombia. . .
T h at ’s tru e ,but they have been disjointed
and scat t e r e d .They need to be welded toge-
ther in a common project,so that the voice of
civil society can be heard in a negotiated
social and political outcome to the confli c t .
We have to create a sense of awa r e n e s s.T h i s
is the only way to change our attitude to poli-
tics in Latin A m e ri c a . I put my trust not in
politics but in social movements that will pro-
vide education and will gi ve rise to cri t i c a l
t h i n k i n g .The fact is that politicians are not
m a gicians who can change things ove rn i g h t .
They need social movements to back them
u p. In Colombia we are scarcely begi n n i n g
and the current peace process may last five or
ten ye a rs. Our president is over-optimistic if
he thinks that eve rything is going to be sett-
led during his term of office.
When you speak of the support of the
international community, what do you
mean in practical terms?
There are several battle fronts in inter-
n ational solidari t y.There is individual soli-
d a ri t y, in which people contri bute their
k n owledge to back up the anony m o u s
s t ruggle of men and women in different
p a rts of the wo r l d , without robbing the
people of their voice.
There is also the presence of the inter-
n ational community through the United
N at i o n s , whether it is represented by UN I-
C E F,UN E S C O or UN D P,o r g a n i z ations whose
work is of fundamental import a n c e . I saw
this in A p a rtadó with UN E S C O’s support
through its Regional Adviser for Latin A m e-
ri c a . M o r e ove r , the mere fact that the
a m b a s s a d o rs of the European Union accre-
dited in Bogotá visit A p a rtadó or any other
r e gion of Colombia opens up a “ c o rridor of
p e a c e ” in which people can describe their
e x p e riences and ask for co-operat i o n , e ve n
though the conflict has not come to a halt. I n
s h o rt , there are many way s , r a n ging from
individual endeavo u rs to large-scale move-
ments of solidari t y, to let a region know that
it does not stand alone. For a region going
through a cri s i s , solitude is sometimes wo rs e
than having to contend with armed force.
What is your opinion of the more individual
form of solidarity provided by volunteers?
To my mind, it is all-import a n t . It is the
best way of breaking away from the double
moral standard whereby many of those who
attend diplomatic conferences and gathe-
rings moan about the “terrible things hap-
pening in that country ” , but ve ry few
actually go and see what is happening.
Behind every volunteer,there are a host of
N G O s , like the Colombia Support Net-
work (CSN) which grew up in the United
S t ates and has gi ven us invaluable backing.

The fact is that politicians are not magicians who can
change things overnight. They need social movements to
back them up

Cross-fire in Urabá
Urabá is a fertile but sparsely-populated region
in the northwest of Colombia, on the Carib-
bean coast near the border with Pa n a m a . Since the
1 9 6 0 s, the region’s economy has been based
almost exclusively on banana plantations belon-
ging to big landowners, most of whom live abroad.
U ra b á , which stretches over three Colombian
provinces (Chocó, Antioquia and Córdoba), h a s
always harboured smugglers. It is also a base for
guerrilla movements whose power is largely
u n c h e c ked in an area where the authority of the
state is weak.But above all it is the most violent
region of a country with record-breaking levels of
criminality. Colombia,with a population of 38 mil-
lion,has a violent murder rate three times higher
than Brazil’s and ten times higher than that of the
United States.
U ra b á ’s economic centre is A p a r t a d ó , a city of
almost 100,000 inhabitants, over 1,000 widows
and 4,500 orphans. During 
the three years (1995-1997) when Gloria Cuartas
was mayor of Apartadó,1,200 of its citizens were
m u r d e r e d , including seventeen city officials.Why is
the level of violence so high?
After being kidnapped and ransomed by guer-
rillas extorting a “revolutionary tax” known as l a
v a c u n a (“the va c c i n e ” ) , the big landowners organi-
zed self-defence groups that soon became para m i-
litary militias. The army turned a blind eye to what
was going on. Left to its own devices for over a
decade by the Colombian government, the region is
today reaping the consequences of a war without
quarter between different guerrilla and para m i l i t a r y
f a c t i o n s.W h a t ’s more, the growing number of drug
t ra f f i c kers take sides either with the guerrillas or the
m i l i t i a s, with the aim of chasing peasant farmers
a way and appropriating their land.The civilian popu-
lation is paying a tragic price for these power
s t r u g g l e s. Systematically suspected of helping the
a r m y, the guerrillas or the paramilitary forces, f a r-
m e r s, farm workers and their families are being mas-
sacred by one or another of these groups.The spira l
of violence has produced a nightmare situation.
C o l o m b i a ’s new president,Andrès Pa s t ra n a ,w h o
took office on 7 August 1998,began negotiations
in October with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation A r m y
( E L N ) , the two main guerrilla movements still active
in the country.
In Urabá and other regions, women have spoke n
out to try to halt the killings. In 1996, women from
all over Colombia gathered in the village of Mutata
( U rabá) to take part in a “Road for Pe a c e ”d e m o n s-
t ration during which they proclaimed :“ We refuse
to bear sons and daughters just to watch them
d i e.” ■

meets once a month to analyse the situat i o n
in my country.
What message would you send to women
at the close of the millennium?
We women have succeeded in making
p r o gress as far as our civil, political and eco-
nomic rights are concerned.We have ente-
red the public sphere. However, there are
still many women who go barefoot, some in
the literal sense and others in the intellec-
tual and emotional senses too.
We women have to get ourselves orga-
nized and recover our voices, our dignity,
our intelligence and our role, and stop
being consigned to a role imposed by men,
and assume new social responsibilities.
L a s t l y, we must trust ours e l ves and our
ability to create and transform society
through intelligence and love . I sincerely
believe that this is what we are doing. ■
Interview by 
A. Ortiz de Urbina and L. Iglesias Kuntz
your term of office, you were awarded the
first UNESCO Mayors for Peace Prize. What
did this award mean to you?
Quite simply it saved my life! And it also
s aved the lives of children, wo r k e rs and
artists in Apartadó.The prize gave us the
opportunity to go on standing on our own
feet and to get together to show the armed
groups that in Apartadó there was a living
force which they had to respect.
Could the Apartadó experience be exported
to other regions in conflict?
It is a wo rthwhile experience which
should not be imposed but shared with
other regions that may have different pro-
blems,such as youth gangs,drugs,alcoho-
lism or unemploy m e n t , but which, l i k e
A p a rt a d ó , need to reinvest public life, t o
r e c over dignity and trust in democratic pro-
cesses.We need to publicize this and simi-
lar experi e n c e s , as we are doing through
UN E S C O’s Cities for Peace netwo r k , i n
order to demonstrate that the major crises
in Latin America can be solved with humi-
lity and intelligence, without resorting to
violence and arms.
Do you think there are universal
mechanisms behind violence?
At a meeting with women from
R wa n d a , Bosnia and Palestine and from
other countries in Latin A m e rica which we
organized in A p a rt a d ó , we saw that the dis-
tress inflicted by war is the same everyw-
here.The conflicts were different, but the
common denominator was that there had
been inadequate investment in education,
health and utility infrastru c t u r e .A b ove all,
in all these cases, there was an unfa i r
income distribution policy, which made it
possible for the rich to get richer and left
broad swathes of society in a state of dire
poverty.
You now live in Venezuela.Are you thinking
of going back to your own country?
I am not an exile and I don’t want to be
one. I am living in Venezuela because I am
in charge of a UN E S C O “Cities of Pe a c e
N e t wo r k ” p r o j e c t . But as soon as I can
return to my country permanently to take
part in the peace process,I shall do so.
My stay in Venezuela has also given me
the opportunity to relax mentally and to
“ d i g e s t ” the pain of wa r. The faces of so
m a ny people who disappeared and the
m e m o ry of so much spilt blood remain
engraved in my mind.
Are you still involved in Colombian public
life?
I keep in touch with my country
