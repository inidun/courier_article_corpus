When Sanjit Bunker Roy came face to face
with a deva s t ating famine that killed thou-
sands in the Indian state of Bihar over 30
ye a rs ago, his vo c ation was suddenly sealed. I t
would not be in the city but in the countryside, it
would not be in the upper echelons of the civil ser-
vice but at the grassroots,with the village people.
Since founding the Social Work and Research
Centre in 1972, R oy has been living in T i l o n i a , a vil-
lage in one of India’s largest, d riest and poorest
s t at e s ,R a j a s t h a n . Better known as the Barefoot Col-
l e g e1, the centre has trained two generations of vil-
l a g e rs without any formal paper qualific ations to
become health-care wo r k e rs , solar engi n e e rs ,h a n d -
pump mechanics and teachers in their communities.
Thanks largely to its effort s , over 100,000
people in 110 villages now have access to safe dri n-
king wat e r , e d u c at i o n , health and employ m e n t .
Rural youth once regarded as “ u n e m p l oya b l e ”i n s-
tall and maintain solar electricity systems, h a n d
pumps and tanks for drinking wat e r. At special
wo r k s h o p s , young artisans upgrade local skills
acquired through generat i o n s. And on an ave r a g e
e ve n i n g, about 3,000 children (60 per cent of
whom are girls) who spend their days grazing cat t l e
and helping their elders make their way to night
school (there are now 150 of them around T i l o n i a ) ,
taught by local residents with rarely more than
eight ye a rs of schooling.
The project’s success is proof that sometimes an
o u t s i d e r ’s view can be a lasting catalyst for deve l o p-
m e n t . Since gr a d u ating from New Delhi’s St Ste-
p h e n ’s College,one of India’s most prestigious edu-
c ational institutions, R oy has devoted his life to T i l o n i a
and bettering the conditions of the rural poor. It wa s
a radical move : “If someone wants to do work in a
v i l l a g e , the formal education system discourages him,”
a s s e rts Roy.“The mindset that this system inculcat e s
in students is that going back to the villages is a losing
p r o p o s i t i o n . Remaining in the city is considered a
s u c c e s s.”
Roy looks upon the Barefoot College as a mul-
tiplier force that uses traditional knowledge as a tool
to reach the goals that conventional government
policies have often been unable to achieve.Twenty
Barefoot College field centres can now be found in
13 of India’s 26 states, and the expansion is set to
continue.“The idea is to use local wisdom before
we involve expertise from outside,” states Roy.
In T i l o n i a ,e d u c ation and development are inex-
t ricably linked.Youth are trained to use technologi e s
that serve their communities while children learn
about environmental themes such as solar electri-
city, which is used in most of their schools. “Night
school students learn from resource persons who are
not only their teachers , but also fa rm e rs ,p o l i c e m e n ,
or local officials,” explains Roy.
For Roy, taking some of the responsibility for
education out of the hands of government could
speed up progress towards universal primary edu-
c ation in his country.“Encourage pri vate initiat i ve
without commercializing educat i o n .G i ve pri vate ini-
t i at i ve more responsibility, more space, m o r e
freedom,” he says. As things stand now, the formal
system alone cannot answer the challenge of rural
education. “It destroys initiative and creativity. It
expects you to do everything the way they say, the
way they do,” he say s. The starting point is to
u n d e rstand the reality of the rural poor—“about 60
or 70 per cent of children never go to school in the
m o rning because they are supposed to work and rear
cattle”—and to channel these children into voca-
tional training at an early age so that they can gain
new skills while continuing to help their families.
If Roy feels that creativity is not always the
strength of gove rn m e n t , the Barefoot College is
breeding its own generation of committed and poli-
tically minded individuals:in Tilonia,it is the chil-
d r e n ’s parliament, an elected body of girls and boy s
between 10 and 14 years of age that is responsible
for making sure that schools are run properly—an
ingenious way of giving children a hold on their ow n
lives—and that of their villages. ■
