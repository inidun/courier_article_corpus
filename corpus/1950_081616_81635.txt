DECEMBER 1950 Paae 9-UNESCO COURIER
OF the 30 Articles in theUniversal Declaration
of Human Rights,
several are concerned in
various degrees with the
freedom of science. Dr. Bart
J. Bok, Associate Director of
the Harvard College Obser-
vatory and former Chairman
of the U. S. National Research
Council's Committee on
Unesco, has examined this
question in a pamphlet
"Freedom of Science", pu-
blished in French by Unesco
and shortly to appear in
English.
In this pamphlet, Dr. Bok
points out that scientists are
especially conscious of their
rights and freedoms. For
example, the scientist in his
laboratory desires freedom
in the selection of research
topics and wants guidance
rather than orders. He
should have access to the
publications of other workers
in the field and he should
have the right to publish
freely the results of his own
investigations. He wants to
have no restrictions upon his
freedom of travel and of
correspondence.
Further, scientists want to
exercise their rights as free
citizens ; they should be free
to participate in the cultural
and intellectual life of the
community, and to parti-
cipate in government and, if
necessary, to criticize it.
"The community which
restricts the freedom of its
scientists as citizens will louse
in the end. In modern
society, government at all
levels is constantly faced with
policy decisions involving
complex scientific and tech-
nological matters. Wise de-
cisions must rest, in part, on
the advice of citric-minded
citizens, and useful advice
wilt hardly be forthcoming if
scientists are not free to
exercise their civic responsi-
biHties", declares Dr. Bok.
A TASK FOR ALL MEN
IN discussing how the free-om of science can be
preserved, he says that
scientists must be made to
realize that their freedom
can only be retained if they
are willing to react against
all infringements of this
freedom."They must learn
to take no freedom for
granted... scientists cannot
accomplish this task alone.
They need sympathetic
support from non-scientists
in all walks of life and in all
professions. The freedom of
science. cannot be maintained
unless there is, in world
opinion, a climate favorable
to it."
Dr. Bok refers specifically
to Articles 12, 13 and 19 of
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (protection
against arbitrary interference
and attacks, freedom of
movement and freedom of
opinion) which he states are
the minimum that must be
guaranteed if there is to be a
freedom of communication.
If a scientist is to work
effectively, he needs as much
as anyone the rights ex-
pressed in Articles 20 to 26.
These include : freedom of
assembly, the right to take
part in the government of his
country, to social security, to
free choice of employment, to
rest and leisure, to an ade-
quate standard of living and
to education.
Article 27 (participation in
cultural life and protection of
scientific, literary or artistic
productions) is especially
important for the scientist.
But, says Dr. Bok, referring
to Article 29 (Everyone has
duties to the community...),
these rights and freedoms
are meaningless, unless they
entail certain duties and res-
ponsibilities.
A GUARANTEE
FOR FREEDOMS
D. Bok recognizes thatscientists can b  consi-
dered as prototypes of
world citizens but that inter-
HOW ELECTRONS MOVE
THROUGH A WIRE. A cur-
rent of electricity passing through
a wire may be compared with a
number of boulders rolling down-
hill through a forest. The trees
represent the atoms in the metal
of the wire, and the boulders are
electrons which are continually
bumping into them, then moving
on again. So tiny is an electron
that several millions of millions
pass through an ordinary electric
lamp each second.
nationalism in science is at
present subject to many con-
trols. He comments that
scientists know from every-
day experience how close we
are to.. one world"of science
and they have, therefore, a
special responsibility to work
for the removal of all un-
necessary barriers.
He refers also to a Charter
for Scientists prepared by the
Committee on Science and its
Social Relations (CSSR) of
the International Council of
Scientific Unions, drafted in
1948. There has been much
discussion about this but k
can see tremendous gains iï
individual scientists in suffi-
cient numbers were to decid (>
simultaneously and volunta-
rily to attach their signature
to the Charter.
Dr. Bok expresses the ups..
nion that :
"As long as science is free,
scientists are almost automa-
tically joined in a world bro-
therhood and it is fervently
hoped that the scientists of
the world will realise that in
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights lies the pro-
mise of a guarantee for thetr
cherished. freedoms and that
it is their responsibility to
join the forces that must lead
in achieving the universal
adr'YJtion of the Declaration.
A CLOCK FOR THE ATOMIC AGE. In a radical departure from all
conventional methods of measuring time, an atomic clock-invariant with
age and for the first time independent of astronomical observations-has
been developed by the National Bureau of Standards in Washington. Based
on a constant, natural vibration frequency of atoms in the ammonia molecule,
the atomic clock is a scientific achievement which offers an entirely new
primary standard of frequency and time. Its principiepromises to free man from
age-old methods of fixing time by the daily rotation of the earth on its axis,. was it revolves around the sun. The primary standard, the earth, is very
gradually slowing down and, in addition, unaccountable fluctuations in the
rate of rotation have sporadically lengthened and shortened the day. The
new method offers an invariant master clock against which the variation in
timekeeping of the earth could be measured. This photo shows Dr. E. U.
Condon, Director of the National Bureau of Standards, (left) and Dr. Harold
Lyons, inventor of the clock, in front of the panels which control it. Dr.
Condon is holding a model of the ammonia molecule whose absorption of
radio energy provides the invariant frequency upon which the principle
of the clock is based.

WHAT ARE ELECTRONS ?
, by Ira M. Freeman
ONE of mankind's most ver-
satile and obedient helpers
in the world of practical
affairs turns out to be the lightest
particle of matter known to
science-the electron. Within a
few decades of its discovery it
succeeded In claiming as its own
an astonishing number and variety
of tasks, giving rise to an entirely
new art called electronics.
Electrons attain their greatest
usefulness when freed from
matter and made to ßlng them-
selves through a void inside a
g-iass tune. This they do in
various forms of apparatus. In
the photocell the liberation comes
through the gentle caress oaf'a ray
of Mfrht ; In the. X-ray tube and
in the. radio tube (or valve),
electrons are literally boiled out
of a hot wire.
Thomas Edison, the American
inventor, observed the latter effect
as long ago as 1883, but it went
almost unnoticed, and twenty
years passed before Sir John
Fleming-fashioned a practical
device on this principle. Shortly
thereafter. Lee Deforest na-
tented the radio tube in what is
essentially its modern form.
Today it Is difficult to name any
of the sciences or practical arts
that has not found use for this
device.
The first indications of the
existence of electron were obtain-
ed after the middle of the last
century when clever experimenters
found it possible to coax subtle
"radiant matter"from ordinarv
substal1l'es by passing current
f !"Om a spark coil through a fiats
tube from which most of the
hindering atr had been pumped.
The decisive experiments that
revealed the nature of this"radiant-matter" (more conven-
f. iunally called cathode rays i
were the work of the mild-
mannered and gifted English phy-
sicist John Joseph Thomson. He
found what others had looked for
without success-that the cathode
rays could be swerved from their
normally straight path by means
of electrical and mag-netic forces.
Bending Cathode Rays
F 110M 1 he observed directionand mount of the bending
Thomson concluded that
the cathode rays consisted of
charges of negative electrical
carried by particles of matter.
The astonishing ; feature of the
result was that such a particle
turned out to be almost two
thousand times less massive than
an atom of hydrogen-up to
that time the lightest known bit
of matter. Thus, in ;,
science came to know that
something-even simpler than the
supposedly immutable atom exist-
ed in Nature.
Thomson's experiment by itself
was not capable of disclosing the
amount of electricity carried by
each cathode ray particle, or
electron. but in his laboratOl'y anti
elsewhere investigators set about
to devise new experiments to
determine this quantity.
Among the many scientists who
worried about the problem was
a young professor at the Uni-
versity of Chicago, Robert 1Ililli-
kan. He devised, in 1909, an
apparatus in which all is sprayed
into the space bet-
ween two Hat metal
plates and a single
drop is kept under
observation in a mi-
croscope. Such a
droplet is small, per-

suspended motionless, or even to
begin to move upward. The
reason is that the process of
spraying the oil has wrenched
electrons loose from some of
the atoms and given the excess
to others. As a consequence,
a drop will generally possess a
resultant electric charge, either
positive or negative, and so will
be urged upward or downward by
the electrical force existing bet-
ween the charged metal plates.
Atomicity Of Electricity

nious weighing machine, a
million times more accurate than
the most refined mechanical ba-
lance ever constructed.
From the observations it was
possible to compute the amount
of electrical charge residing on
each droplet, with the significant
result that these charges in-
variably are whole-number mul-
tiples of a certain smallest valuP
- the so-called charge on the
electron. Mitiikan's experiment
showed, then, that electricity,
like matter, possesses a kind of
atomicity, and that the electron is
the basic smallest unit of electro-
Hcation-that can exist by itself.
This speck of"radiant matter"
discovered Buy Thomson, this
parUcte carrying'a dab of electri-
city, turns out to be one of the
fundamental constituents of the
atoms of all kinds of matter
throughout the universe.
Just before the war, the
American scientist, G. R. Harrison
wrote :"Putting electrons to
work has put men to work. That
four great tnduttriet-the
telephone, the radio, the phono-
graph, and the motion picture in-
dustries-rest directly on the
vacuum tube and could not exist. on SI1 vast a scale without It, i8

are blamed for technological un-
employment."Today, television,
radar, electronic computers, the
electron microscope and several
other highly important applica-
tions might be added to thè above
tist, and the potentialities of the
tiny yet mighty electron are
seemingly without end.
