Basic

on the map
An overview of world education trends highlights
glaring inequalities
Adecade after governments and the interna-
tional community pledged to ensure unive-
ral access to primary education by 2000
and to reduce the adult illiteracy rate to half its
1990 level, there are still around 130 million chil-
dren in the world who never attend school and an
estimated 872 million adults who do not have the
most basic skills to break their way out of pover-
ty.The education crisis is most flagrant in the two
regions with the lowest per capita incomes in the
world, South Asia ($385) and sub-Saharan A f ri c a
( $ 5 1 3 ) . In the lat t e r , sixteen countries have 
suffered a decline in enrolment rat e s.
To put the crisis in perspective, it should be
noted that in 1960,fewer than half the developing
world’s children aged 6 to 11 were enrolled in pri-
mary school, compared with 79 per cent today.
But these tremendous efforts were insufficient to
match population growth while the debt crisis of
the 1980s in many cases arrested progress. Over
the past decade, net enrolment ratios have been
inching up slowly (from 53 per cent to 56 per
cent in sub-Saharan Africa, from 65 to 72 per
cent in South Asia). Public expenditure on edu-
cation has crawled up from 5.1 to 5.6 per cent of
GDP in sub-Saharan Africa and from 3.9 to 
4.3 per cent in South Asia.
The gender
trap
Girls crowd the ranks of out-of-school children
d i s p r o p o rt i o n at e l y, representing nearly two of
e ve ry three children in the developing world who
do not receive a pri m a ry educat i o n , according to
U N I C E F. Half the girls in sub-Saharan A f ri c a
and South Asia never attend school, with the
highest disparity found in the latter region (15
p o i n t s ) .The Middle East and North A f rica have
much higher enrolment rat e s , but the gender gap
in pri m a ry education remains significant 
(8 points).
These inequalities at the primary level natu-
rally go on to swell illiteracy rates: in the same
three regions, over half the female population
over 15 years of age is illiterate, with South Asia
posting the highest rate and the most glaring

gender gap (29 points). This situation has parti-
cularly critical implications for human develop-
ment given the beneficial impact of several years
of primary education on decreasing infant morta-
lity and reducing fertility rates.
But there are other inequalities aggravating
the situation. Although many countries in the
developing world are predominantly rural, educa-
tion is frequently skewed in favour of urban chil-
dren: Burkina Faso and Niger are extreme cases,
with primary school attendance over 40 per cent
lower in the countryside than in urban areas.
Another major cause for concern is not reflec-
ted on this map: the number of children who
actually finish the primary school cycle. In South
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, between 30 and 40
per cent of children entering primary school drop
out before reaching grade five without acquiring
the basic skills enabling them to improve their
lives and have a voice in society. The problem is
equally troubling in regions where most children
go to school: in Latin A m e rica and the
Caribbean, one quarter of the children entering
primary school drop out before reaching grade
five. ■
