“ HEL LO, I’M CA L L ING
FROM PA RUL I A . . . ”

A micro-credit programme set up by Grameen Bank enables rural villagers to acquire cell
phones. For many, it  means a break with poverty and isolation

Once, it was hard for Fatema Begum
and her day-labourer husband to
provide three meals a day for their
family, who lived in a thatched hut in
a remote village called Pa rulia in
Bangladesh’s Narshingdi district. But a
mobile phone she bought as a means of
earning money for her impoverished fam-
ily has changed her life. In a couple of
years, she managed to acquire a brick-
built house with electricity, an electric
fan, a black and white television set and
several other modern amenities. Mobile
phones have not only improved the lives
of villagers like Fatema, but also brought
remote villages like Parulia out of isola-
tion.
“Since my phone is the only one within
three kilometres, m a ny people come here to
use it,” Fatema say s. She earns about 5,000
takas (US$100) a month from her mobile
p h o n e , after meeting all the costs—four
times the average per capita monthly
i n c o m e . Fatema adds,“ People in my village
who have relat i ves abroad often gi ve me
gifts in addition to payment of their bills
because I bring the phone to their houses
when there are incoming calls for them.”
Mobile phones make up for a lack of ser-
vices that the Stat e - owned phone company
is hard-pressed to prov i d e . According to
c u rrent stat i s t i c s ,Bangladesh has one phone
for every 380 inhabitants, compared with
one for every 50 in neighbouring India.
Fatema started her struggle for a better
life ten ye a rs ago when she joined Grameen
Bank,an internationally acclaimed micro-
credit institution, to obtain a small, short-
t e rm loan of 2,000 takas ($40). She start e d
a small business hawking va rious essen-
t i a l s , including ri c e , door to door in vil-
lages. When Fatema repaid that loan, she
was granted another one of 5,000 takas
( $ 1 0 0 ) , which she also promptly paid back.
In 1997, Grameen Te l e c o m , a unit of
Grameen Trust, one of the world’s largest
organizations working for poverty allevia-
t i o n , introduced village phones for Grameen
Bank members. Soon after, Fatema wa s
a l l owed to purchase a phone at a cost
o f 19,500 takas ($390), r e i m bu rs i n g
4 0 0 takas ($8) eve ry week in regular instal-
ments.
Like Fat e m a ,m a ny other poor villagers
throughout Bangladesh have opened phone

In Bangladesh, village women use their mobile phones to speak with wholesalers in the city.
shops in their homes to boost their income.
Grameen Telecom has provided some 1,400
village telephones in rural areas across the
country, serving tens of thousands of vil-
lagers.According to Mohammed Showkat
Ali, a Grameen Telecom officer in Narsh-
i n g d i , the programme was designed to help
poor people in villages, especially women,
who make up 94 per cent of Grameen
B a n k ’s borr owe rs , to earn additional
i n c o m e .As a result, the call-rate is cheaper
than that of other existing telephone lines.
A p a rt from talking to relat i ve s ,v i l l a g e rs
who gr ow crops or raise poultry or live-
stock now have a chance to speak with
w h o l e s a l e rs in the capital or other big cities
directly instead of selling their products at
a cheaper price through a middleman. S o m e
100 village phones are in operation in the
district of Narshingdi,which is famous for
fruits, especially bananas, as well as green
vegetables and handmade fa b ri c s. Ja m i ru n-
n e s a , who runs a poultry fa rm in a fa rm i n g
village, bought a mobile phone on credit.
Besides providing a service for her neigh-
bours, the mother of four says, “there are
bu ye rs who want to cheat me. But they
c a n ’t because I’ve got the phone, w h i c h
comes in handy to know at what rate the
chickens are selling in the markets.”
Abdul Awa l , a Bangladesh Railway ticket
clerk at the train station in Nars h i n g d i ,k e e p s
his village phone with him at wo r k , w h e r e
m a ny people come to use it.Awal charges six
takas (eight cents) per minute for a local call
and 100 takas ($2) per minute for an ove r-
seas one. “I make a profit of 100 takas ($2)
e ve ry day. Most of the people who come
here are fa rm e rs and textile we ave rs and
they talk to the wholesalers in Dhaka, t h e
c a p i t a l , or other cities,” he said, a d d i n g :
“Because of the additional income, I can
afford to send my children to school.” ■
