Everyone dances in Africa: from this simple truth, Alphonse Tiérou, a choreographer and researcher
from Côte d’Ivoire, fashions his faith in dance’s power to push society onwards
INTERVIEW BY JASMINA SOPOVA
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST



our last work is entitled “If Dance Moves,
Africa Will Move”. What do you mean by
t h a t ?
A country’s economic and social
development does not depend only on
its capital and labour, as economists and
the free-market tradition suggest. C u l-
ture is just as important.In La société de
c o n fia n c e ( “ The Society of Tr u s t ” ) ,p u b l i-
shed in 1995,the French academic Alain
P e y r e fitte correctly explained that the
main theories placing economic resources
such as raw materials, c a p i t a l ,l a b o u r,p r o-
duction,investment,and growth rates at
the heart of development were out of
date. He said that cultural factors, which
have been relegated to the rank of “by-
standers,” should be regarded as a basic
driving force of progress. In truth, t h e
intangible, immaterial aspects of culture
help to shape people’s mentalities.Th a t ’s
why they are the real locomotive of any
society. If they are neglected,if they are
not put at the core of thinking about
d e v e l o p m e n t , there is a chance they may
turn into insurmountable obstacles.
What cultural factors impede development
in Africa?
Ta b o o s, s u p e r s t i t i o n , polygamy and
tribalism are some of them. How can a
woman lead a fulfilling life when she is
constantly struggling against her rivals
to keep her husband’s affection? How
can you bring up your children the way
you want to when you must submit to
your elders’ authority? How can you
think and reflect with a calm,level head
when 10 or 20 of you are living under the
same roof? In my opinion,this custom is
an abuse of the traditional values of bro-
therhood and generosity because it stands
in the way of personal self-fulfil l m e n t .
You can’t save money or achieve per-
sonal goals because you must obey the
g r o u p ’s demands. In this “ g r e g a r i o u s ”
s o c i e t y, whose roots lie in traditional cul-
t u r e, it is inconceivable for the individual
to have an existence outside his or her
c o m m u n i t y. But individuality is precisely
where the source of progress lies.
Of all these problems, the most
serious is probably an inferiority com-
p l e x , which has a tremendous hold in
Africa. It generates a culture of depen-
dence to the detriment of a culture of
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y, paralyzes and suffocates
the whole continent,destroys the basis of
social cohesiveness. I’m convinced that
the main cause of under-development in
Africa is a lack of self-confidence.
What do you mean by that?
Africans do not trust A f r i c a n s.Wh i t e s
enjoy more consideration and are given
more resources than blacks. Take a per-
sonal example. In 1987,during a lecture
tour in black A f r i c a , I was arrested in one
country and brought before the ministry
of youth, s p o r t s, culture and scientific
r e s e a r c h , which considered my speech
on African culture suspicious.At the end
of a prolonged interrogation,a white man

walked into the office. He spoke out on
my behalf. The minister immediately
changed his tone.After a few phone calls,
he opened doors for me to all the media
while the most beautiful conference hall
in the city, the place used by the country’s
sole political party, was placed at my dis-
p o s a l . Similar things happen every day
in our countries.
This inferiority complex can also be
seen in the relationship with traditional
d a n c e. S o m e t i m e s, African artists who
have acquired a veneer of training in
Western dance hurriedly denigrate their
r o o t s. L i k e w i s e, instead of developing
their own analyses,African intellectuals
just repeat everything that some foreign
pseudo-specialists say and write about
their culture.The problem is that the dis-
course of these specialists often locks
African dance in a ghetto and denies the
continent the right to evolve and moder-
nize.They see Africa as a living museum
of past traditions.
Can dance change that mentality?
I’m convinced it can.The creative act
is fundamental to the emancipation of
the individual.Everyone knows that. B u t
it is even more fundamental in the
African context, where individuality, t h e
source of progress, is often stifled by
group pressure and conformity.
That is where dance can be a factor of
d e v e l o p m e n t . It can tear up the old
s t u m p s, destroy the causes of evil that are
deeply rooted in the human sub-conscious,
give individuals the possibility of belon-
g i n g, of finding and fulfilling themselves.
That is how it can make society move.
Because only a society made up of free
and self-confident individuals can find the
right solutions to its problems.
D a n c e, a major component of A f r i c a n
c u l t u r e,mobilizes a vast amount of energy
that should be more effectively channelled.
Everybody dances in A f r i c a : p h a r a o h s,
queens and kings, s a i n t s, the masks of
w i s d o m ,pregnant women,b a b i e s,old folks,
j u d g e s,g e n e r a l s,heads of state—remember
Mandela? Governments in Africa should
take more account of the emancipatory
qualities of dance,and also give artists and
researchers the means to pursue their
work more effectively.They mustn’t forget
that the very fact of researching our
d a n c e s, which condition our entire lives,
means agreeing to accepting ourselves as
we are, freeing us from our complexes,
making us feel good about who we are
and what we think, proving that we have
c o n fidence in ourselves, in all Africans and
in the rest of the world.
How can African dance help to establish a
relationship with the rest of the world?
Choreography is an “ e x p o r t a b l e ”c u l-
tural product. On a large scale, it could
become an asset for modern A f r i c a .S i n c e
African dance has spread worldwide, i t
has done more to bring young people from
the North and South closer together than
any other policy,no matter how good and
w e l l - i n t e n t i o n e d .Dance is still the shortest
route linking one individual to another. I t
is about passion and seduction. D u r i n g
the period of colonization, We s t e r n e r s
understood this perfectly well and made it
illegal to dance with A f r i c a n s.
In the past few decades, thanks to the
African diaspora and to the many dance
courses held in the North as well as the
S o u t h , the trend has started moving in
the opposite direction. Real exchanges
have taken place, sincere and deep friend-
ships have been woven in a spirit of
mutual trust, dignity and respect. Th e
rising interest in African dance calls for an
adequate response on the part of A f r i c a n s
themselves, so that supply grows at the
same pace as demand.Because, to para-
phrase the French philosopher A l b e r t
Ja c q u a r d , on the dance floor “the only
worthy goal is not to be better than o t h e r s,
but to be better because of others.” ■
Dance can tear up 
the old stumps,
destroy the causes of 
evil that are
deeply rooted in the human 
sub-conscious,
give individuals the 
possibility of belonging,
of finding and 
fulfilling themselves
