B RAZlL is a living example of
how a nation composed of
people of diverse racial
stocks need not be split by
tensions, segregation, or discrimi-
nation between racial groups.
In this vast country,. however,
there are striking contrasts from
region to region, as well as between
the cosmopolitan cities and the small
towns and rural homesteads of the
interior. Like other aspects of the
Brazilian social scene, the patterns
of race relations may be expected to
vary within the common framework
of national life. Differences in
ethnic composition, living standards,
the extent of industrialization, and
receptiveness to foreign ideas
further complicate the problem of
generalizing on a national scale.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
there are'wide gaps in our infor-
mation. This was, until a short
time ago, especially true of our
knowledge of race relations in the
interior portions of the country.
Since over 70 per cent of Brazil's
approximately 50, 000, 000 people live
in towns with fewer than 5, 000 inha-
bitants, or on scattered farms and
plantations, studies of the rural
population were particularly urgent.
In 1950 and 1951 such studies were
carried out by the Fundaçao para 0
Desenvolvimento da Ciencia na
Bahia and the Department of An-
thropology of Columbia University,
in co-operation with Unesco. Three
smaU communities in different
regions of northern Brazil were
covered. A fourth anthropological
"community study"was made in
1948 as one of the surveys for the
International Hylean Amazon Insti-
tute sponsored by Unesco.
A report based upon these studies
has already been received by
Unesco.'Called Race and Class in
Rural Brazil it includes articles on
a traditional plantation community
of the Bahian area (Vila Reconcavo),
an old mining town of the Brazilian
plateau (Minas Velhas), a character-
istic community of the arid north
eastern sertao (Monte Serrat), and
a community situated along the
Amazon River, (Ita). These studies
were prepared respectively by Harry
W. Hutchinson, Marvin Harris, Ben
Zimmerman, and Charles Wagley.
Each is a first-hand"case study"
of race relations in a representative
community of an important region
of north Brazil. There are differ-
ences from one community to an-
other, and from one region to an-
other ; but the common patterns of
race relations which emerge from a
comparison of all four communities
seem to be basic traditions shared
by a significant segment of the Bra-
zilian nation.
In all of the communities included
in our research programme, it was
observed that the most important
principle governing relatioqs be-
tween people was membership of
a social class rather than"race".
People are assigned a place in the
social hierarchy depending on their
income, occupation, level of educa-
tion, family connections and finally,
but only of equal importance with
these qualifications, on their"race".
Considered separately from the
other criteria, the qualities popularly
associated with the various racial'
types stand out as evidence for a
mild form of race prejudice. Phy-
sical characteristics are rated higher
as they approach the white model,
and lower as they approach the
Negro or (in the Amazon) the In-'
dian. Thus people speak of"bad
hair", meaning the kinky hair of
the Negro, and everywhere very
dark skin colour is considered less
desirable than light skin colour.
In addition, psychological fea-
tures, some of them derogatory, are
regularly attributed to the various
races ; the average Negro, for exam-
ple, is considered to be innately less
intelligent than the white. Strictly
speaking, these are prejudices, but
the fact that racial criteria are regu-

larly weighed against the other
components of the over-all social
ranking system greatly diminishes
their effect upon actual behaviour.
In the old mining community of
Minas Velhas, for example, a man
who told us that he would never
welcome a Negro in his home, soon
afterwards entertained a Negro
engineer with the utmost respect
and cordiality. In concrete social
situations, other qualities such as
wealth, education, family member-
ship, personal attachments, and
politics seem to determine the way
people treat one another rather than
"race".
Instances in which race preju-
dice enters into actual behaviour
are not, however, entirely lacking.
Occasional tension occurs at the
margin of the upper class, where, if
other criteria have not been met deci-
sively, the racial factor is liable to
assume critical and disputed propor-
tions. Peoples who are clearly lower
class do not try to compete with the
upper class, but those striving to
enter the upper class or to attain
socÎ1d pl'Ominence in their commu-
nity do, as elsewhere, compete
\'.'uh one another.
It was at this point in the social
hierarchy that"race"was often
found to be the crucial qualification
for social success, when participa-
tion in festive ceremonies, appoint-
ment to political office, or marriage
with an economic equal were at
stake. On the other hand, if the eco-
nomic and educational criteria are
clearly and undoubtedly satisfied,
dark-skinned individuals easily
cross the threshold of the upper
class and are fully accepted.
Thus in all of the communities
studied there are"people of colour"
by Charles WAGLEY
Columbia University
in the upper class groups-indivi-
duals of relatively high income,
engaged in a"white collar"occupa-
tion, who are literate, related in one
way or another to an important local
family and'who are Negro, mulatto,
or caboclo (American Indian) in
appearance. Though their achieve-
ment of high social rank may be
more difficult, it is possible.
Despite the relative unimportance
of racial criteria so far as rank is
concerned, the majority of the
people in the upper class groups
of their respective communities are
European in appearance. In other
words, the"people of colour"gene-
rally do occupy positions that are
socially, economically and educa-
tionally inferior. It would be a
mistake, however, to regard this
correlation between race and class
as being wholly or largely the effect
of a mild race prejudice.
The causes of this situation must
be sought for rather in the slowness
with which economic and educa-
tional advantages have been
extended to those who are but third
or fourth generation descendants of
slaves and of primitive Indians.
The principal barrier to social
improvement is not race prejudice,
but the inherited disadvantage of
the non-European in terms of edu-
cation and wealth.
Of fundamental importance in
this respect is the fact that there is
no institutionalized segregation or
occupational and educational discri-
mination based on"race"alone.
Apparent instances of segregation
do occur when poor people who-are
also"people of colour"occupy
certain districts of the towns. But)
in fact, segregation on any large
scale would be impossible here.
There is no simple two-or three-
fold classification of racial types
which would permit the parcelling
of people into residential districts,
different schools, churches and
other such arrangements. There
are, instead, numerous physical
types, such as the to'anco (Euro-
pean), the mulatto, the moreno
eSCU1'O (dark brown), the morena
claro (light brown), the cabo
verde (dark skin, but European
features), the sai'ara (light skin but
Negro features), the caboclo (Ameri-
can Indian features), and the pardo
(brown), to mention only a few. It
is hard to imagine a"Jim Crow"
system in these circumstances.
The recognition of so many
intermediate types shows in one
sense an acute awareness of racial
differences. People go so far as
habitually to identify others in
conversation by referring to their
physical type.
"Aqllf'le mlllato"or"aqucle ca-
boclo"is mentionned in much the
same way as other people speak of
"that tall, thin fellow".
One of the important lessons
which a study of Brazil can teach
us is that intense awareness of racial
differences need not necessarily be
accompanied by an equal intensity
of prejudice or discrimination.
In rural Brazil,"people of
colour"may improve their social
status by improving their economic,
educational, and occupational posi-
tion. As the Brazilian economy
continues to expand, and educational
and economic opportunities become
more widely distributed, the people
of dark skin colour who now occupy
the lower ranks of society should
tend to take their places with the
more'privileged groups.
rural Brazil is not totally free of
prejudice and discrimination based
on race, but on the whole, the
traditional patterns of race relations
present in these rural communities
are a rich social heritage from
which the world has much to learn.t
