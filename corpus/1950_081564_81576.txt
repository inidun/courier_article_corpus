ONE day, in September 1940,
two French boys, Marsal
and Ravfdat, were walk-
ing along a wooded ridge
above the Vezere River, near the
village of Montignac in Southwest
France. Their dog Robot chased
a rabbit into a deep hole and in
attempting to rescue the dog, the
children worked their way down
into a cave which subsequently
proved to contain the. finest collec-
tion of pre-historic paintings yet
found.
Although similar paintings had
bun found in other caves and rock
shelters in this region, those at
Lascaux were unique in their excel-
lent state of preservation, many
being as vividly etched and co loured
as when they were painted at
various times between 12, 000 and
30, 000 years ago.
The lcrrgest mural in the Lascaux cave, where about 500 paintings
of animals were found. Close to many of the paintings are curious
eye-like signs, probably meant to represent the magical eye of the
hunter, and placed there to ensure success in the hunt.
Like all other female animals on the walls of the cave, this Chinese-
like horse is pregnant, expressing a wish by the men who made the
paintings that their food supply be assured. The darts behind the
animal are magic symbols of the wish for hunting success.
In a deep and almost inaccessible shaft. the archaeologists explo-
ring the cave found what was probably the record of some prehis-
toric drama. It showed a man with a bird's head, apparently dead
- the only human figure among the Lascaux paintings. Close by
were a totem-pike bird and a bison pierced through with a spear.
The original opening to the Lascaux cave through which the two boys
shown in this photograph Ravidat and Marsal, found their way to
the storehouse of prehistoric art. With the boys are (left) M. Léon
Lavat. a member of the <&lt; Société Prehistorique Française >&gt; and the
Abbé Breuil, an eminent French archaeologist.
It was only after the Liberation
of France that other countries
learned of this important disco-
very. Among the journalists who
visited the cave was an American,
William Chapman, who, having
already seen several art films based
on direct photography of the
paintings of great masters, concei-
ved the idea of bringing the pre-
historic paintings of Lascaux to
the screen.
It was not until 1948. that he
was able to carry out his project.
He had never before made a film
and he had to overcome many
technical difficulties. All his heavy
equipment, for example, had to be
hauled up the hillside by oxen.

Chapman used colour film from
the United States, and took his
shots with a camera loaned from
London, with the. aid of lighting
provided by a French. electri-
cian. He was encouraged in his
work by Robert Flaherty, the well-
known producer of documentary
films and a grant from the"Viking
Fund"enabled him to finish his
work.
The result,"Lascaux : Cradle of
Man's Art", which has just been
shown for the first time in Europe
at the Antibes Film Festival, is a
remarkable colour film of the paint-
ings that cover the limestone
wall.
There are paintings of deer,
bison, wild horse, bulls, a totem-
like bird and many others. Some
animals are shown pursued by dots
and arrows, magic symbols for
hunting success, it is thought. All
the female animals are pregnant,
signifying a wish that the food
supply continue. There is one
remarkable picture of a horse, his
body shaded to indicate a third
dimension, his head turned and
fore-shortened, his ears shown in
a natural way. This may be
the first discovered painting
that attempts modern perspective.
Then, there are paintings on top of
paintings, done thousands of years
apart.
Only One Human Figure
ONE large section of the cave iscovered with huge black bulls,
some of them twenty feet long and
worked in among them are other
animals like galloping ponies. No-
where in the history of cave paint-
ing have animals as large as these
ever been found. There is only
one human figure in the cave ; it
is shown with bison and a totem-
like bird. There are also multitu-
dinous symbols and dots which may
be the beginnings of writing and
mathematics.
Everything has been success-
fully captured on film and the
commentary, spoken by Mr. Chap-
man himself, is intelligently help-
ful to an appreciation or. the
drawings.
Temple Of The Hunters
SCHOLARS think that the. cave
found by the boys in 1940 and
since caUed Lascaux, was a temple
devoted to securing, through magic,
an abunda. nce of food in those re-
mote times when man was so ! e a
hunter, before he had learned to
sow crops and before he had domes-
ticated animals. In addition to
showing the cave paintings, the
film also shows some of the sites in
the region, where many important
discoveries about pre-historic man
have been made. Lascaux opens a
door into the past and it empha-
sizes the rapidly growing belief
that the teaching of history must
soon begin with pre-history.
The study of pre-history is only
about a hundred years old. And
it was not until the paintings in
the Spanish caves at Altimira were
found in 1879 that anyone thought
of ancient man as an artist.
Through this and subsequent
discoveries, culminating in the
amazing find at Lascaux, scientists
are gradually taking a new view
of mankind's eariy history.
Chapman's 16 mm sound and
colour film which runs for 17 mi-
nutes was made especially for uni-
versities, colleges, schools, museums
and community groups.
Lascaux has been called :"The
capital of a lost continent in the
mind of prehistoric man". Cer-
tainly for those interested in art,
archaeology, anthropology, humani-
ties and kindred subjects, this film
offers insight, inspiration and
opportunity for countless hours of
study.
