 UNESCO will have a demanding role to play over the next ten years in co-
ordinating eff orts to achieve Education for All, according to Abhimanyu Singh, 
UNESCO’s Director for EFA Co-ordination and Monitoring. “We must keep everyone 
working towards the EFA goals,” he says. 
 UNESCO’s research institutes will attempt to focus more sharply on 
helping countries form eff ective national education plans and improving the 
eff ectiveness of regional support networks and country programmes.
 Initiatives have also been launched on three key issues: training for teachers in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, adult literacy for empowerment and the fi ght against HIV/
AIDS, which is doubling teacher attrition rates in some countries. The ambitious 
training programme will attempt to raise the quality of teaching in 17 countries 
from 2006. UNESCO is already coordinating the international UN eff ort on 
HIV/AIDS, but will also expand its preventive education work. The ten-year 
adult literacy programme, LIFE, will operate in 34 countries that have 10 million 
illiterates or an adult literacy rate below 50 %.
 “Literacy is no longer about the 3Rs but about human development, 
community development and country development,” says Shigeru Aoyagi, Chief 
of UNESCO’s Literacy Section, adding that programmes must go beyond the 
basics. Ann Therese Ndong-Jatta, a former Minister of Education in Gambia and 
now the Director of the Basic Education Division at UNESCO, says the Organization 
must also work more at the country level to share expertise, improve 
governments’ ability to use aid eff ectively and increase their ability to negotiate 
with international donors. “When they want an accord, developing countries 
tend to agree with partners,” Ndong-Jatta says. “UNESCO must help them respond 
better to get a better outcome for themselves.”
