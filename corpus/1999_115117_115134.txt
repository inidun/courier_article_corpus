Drawing up accurate inventories of art treasures is an essential first step in
the fight against massive international trafficking

In economic term s , illicit trafficking in
cultural property ranks alongside inter-
national illicit trading in arms, drugs
and tobacco. To d ay, i n t e rn ational effort s
to stop it rely not only on legi s l at i o n , but also
on an approach which is by no means uni-
versally applied—thorough cataloguing.
Imagine that your car has been stolen
and that when you go to report the theft yo u
c a n ’t remember what model it is.You can’t
s ay in what year it was manufactured or
w h at its regi s t r ation number is, and yo u
certainly haven’t got a photo of it. Even if
the police find it within 24 hours , t h e y
won’t know whose it is, and what’s more
you’ll have a hard time proving that it was
yours in the first place.
This is often the case with works of art
which have been stolen from museums or
religious buildings or have been looted or
traded in questionable circumstances in
wartime. One day they may be seized by
customs officials or turn up on the art
market without their legi t i m ate ow n e rs
being able to prove their case.
The many organizations that are
engaged in combating the illicit trade in
cultural propert y, including national police
f o r c e s ,I n t e rpol (the Intern ational Cri m i n a l
Police Organizat i o n ) , the Intern at i o n a l
Council of Museums (ICOM),the Interna-
tional Institute for the Unific ation of Pri vat e
L aw (UN I D RO I T) and UN E S C O, are now
m oving beyond their traditional concern
with the theft aspect of the problem and
emphasizing prevention rather than cure.
They encourage personal and electronic
s u rveillance of works of art in places where
they are exhibited, but this solution is not
a lways affordable.They also say that taking
p h o t o graphs and making detailed inve n t o-
ries and keeping them in a safe place can be
a more effective way of tackling the problem
of theft than might appear at first sight.
The Getty Inform ation Institute, w h i c h
is part of the Los Angeles-based Getty
Foundation in the United States,has been
working for some ye a rs on a project to
d e velop a new intern ational standard, c a l l e d
Object ID, intended to simplify and ratio-
nalize the description of works of art and
a n t i q u e s.The project, which has UN E S C O’s
backing, does not exclude any of the exis-
ting methods. One gr e at advantage is its
simplicity—a record is made of each art
wo r k , giving its measurements (size and
weight),the material it is made of (such as
b r o n z e , wo o d , o i l , e t c. ) , the subject, t h e
date,the author and other data.
I n t e rpol regularly publishes details of the
most wanted works of art . It is currently put-
ting the finishing touches to a CD-ROM
and testing an electronic system which will
enable any of its offices to know within
minutes whether an object appears on any
of the lists of stolen art.It will be as simple
as sending an e-mail to the database at
Interpol headquarters in Lyons (France)
and getting back a coded message, which
may even include a picture of the object
concerned.
No country 
is safe
M e a n w h i l e , the Intern ational Council of
Museums published a “Red List” of A f ri c a n
art works at the end of 1997, highlighting
objects that are particularly likely to come
from illegal or clandestine excavat i o n s. Fo r
ICOM’s Valérie Jullien, “This is something
like a list of endangered animal species. It
c o n c e rns objects from sites in the Niger
Valley, Chad or Cameroon that are syste-
m atically looted, resulting in the destru c t i o n
of archaeological sites month after month,
thereby removing any possibility of recons-
t ructing the history of the objects, of the civi-
lizations from which they came and of the
people who made them.”The list is intended
to be open-ended and could therefore be
applied to endangered objects in other areas
of the world,adds Jullien.
All the organizations invo l ved agree that
illicit trafficking is a scourge from which
no country is immune. In A f ri c a , there have



Tracking down  

been thefts from the national museums of
A l g e ri a , A n g o l a , B o t swa n a , E g y p t , C ô t e
d ’ I vo i r e , L i b ya , N i g e ria and the form e r
Z a i r e , to mention only a few. In Latin A m e-
rica, indigenous communities such as the
Coroma of Bolivia are fighting to recover
ceremonial fabrics (q’ipis), and any obser-
vant visitor to Mexico City’s Nat i o n a l
A n t h r o p o l o gical Museum cannot help noti-
cing the gaps left in some of its display
cases where objects have disappeared in
mysterious circumstances.
Europe and North A m e rica have not
been spared. Camille Corot’s painting Le
Chemin de Sèvres (1885) vanished from the
Louvre museum in Pa ris one Sunday in
M ay 1998, d u ring peak visiting hours.
According to Interpol data,in 1997 alone,
2,476 art works were stolen in Germany,
2,944 in Russia, 2,244 in the Czech Repu-
blic and 5,569 in France. In Italy, the police
reported that over 30,000 art objects were

stolen in 1996, which is equivalent to the
stock of an average-sized museum.
Besides the economic value represented
by these objects on the intern ational market,
the damage caused by the loss of cultural
h e ritage sometimes borders on the irr e p a-
r a b l e .
This was the case with over 100 Khmer
sculptures discovered by the Thai authori-
ties on trucks in January 1999.The pieces
had been taken from the temple of Banteay
C h m a r , built at the end of the 12th century
in north-western Cambodia by King Jaya-
varman VII. The bas-reliefs adorning the
wall around the temple were ripped out in
s e veral places, l e aving a gap over 11 metres
l o n g . According to Professor Claude
Ja c q u e s , who directed an on-site inve s t i g a-
t i o n , this is a particularly serious case
because the wall contained palaeographic
inscriptions which are rarely found in sur-
viving written documents. In other words,
this particular theft amounts to the des-
t ruction of archives “ t h at end up decorat i n g
the drawing rooms and gardens of people

who cannot even decipher them.”
Recalling that the Angkor site, w h i c h
contains some 1,200 temples spread over an
area of 300 km2, is part of the heritage of
h u m a n i t y, Cambodian Prince Norodom
Suhamomi expresses his Gove rn m e n t ’s
concern on the issue in these terms: “We
h ave a heritage that is disappeari n g . In some
places in Cambodia, ten times more sculp-
tures have been lost in three decades than
b e t ween the eighth century and the 1970s,
and we now need the help of our colleagues.
E ven though the Cambodian authori t i e s
are doing all they can to combat this ini-
quitous situat i o n , their efforts will neve r
be sufficient because the demand in Europe
and the United States is simply enorm o u s.”
Making up
for the damage
Another question that arises for profes-
sionals is what to do when a stolen work of art
r e a p p e a rs in an auction or in the back room
of a none too scrupulous trader. For Va l é ri e
J u l l i e n , there is no easy answe r: “Buying it
would be unethical, since it would signify
e n c o u r a ging this type of traffic k i n g .” A p a rt
from the costs of the purchase itself, t h e r e
could be other related expenses, such as the
legal costs incurred by gove rnments or indi-
viduals for court actions to recover their pro-
p e rt y, or the considerable costs of paying for
the transfer of art works between places as fa r
a p a rt as Italy and Ethiopia. In some cases,
l aw ye rs ’ o f fices may provide free services or
p ri vate companies may sponsor returns in
exchange for publicity, but such contri bu-
tions are marginal and certainly not enough
to cover all the expenses.
UN E S C O’s Intergove rnmental Com-
mittee for Promoting the Return of Cultural
Property to its Countries of Origin or its
Restitution in Case of Illicit A p p r o p ri at i o n
is considering setting up a fund based on
vo l u n t a ry contri bu t i o n s , and this might go
some way towards solving the problem.
Differences may of course be settled
with the goodwill of the parties. For ins-
tance, as a result of a court judgment fol-
l owed by a friendly agr e e m e n t , almost 200
objects of pre-Columbian art curr e n t l y
exhibited at the Museum of Non-Euro-
pean Cultures in Rimini (Italy) alongside
their names and ori gins carry the follow i n g
m e n t i o n : “ P r o p e rty of the State of
Ecuador”. n
