A case
of give
and take
NE of the mot interest-ing technical training
projects of the Inter-
national Labour Organiza-
tion is at present being
carried out in Brazil. The
undertaking is an example
of the"give and take"of
technical assistance.
Brazil avails itself of the
technical aid provided by the
United Nations as a receiver-
nation, but at the same time
it has also pledged $460, 000
as a contributor-nation al-
though it has been agreed
thatthis sum could be devot-
ed to international projects
within the country.
Last year, the ILO entered
into discussions with the
Government of Brazil and
with the Brazilian agency in
Sao Paulo, known as the
National Service of Indus-
trial Apprenticeship (SE-
NAI) and from this emerged
an arrangement by which
ILO has undertaken to ad-
minister a training scheme
for ail Latin America, mak-
ing use of the wide training
facilities and scholarships
for industrial instructors
which the SENAI offers.
The Brazilians have made
available 100 fellowships by
which, under the Technical
Assistance prog ramme,
technicians from ail the
Latin American countries
can become the guests of
Brazil. These include five
three-year scholarships in
spinning and weaving at the
Federal Technical School of
Chemical and Technical In-
dustry ; 10 fellowships last-
ing nine months each at the
SENAI schools, including
training periods in indus-
trial concerns, for the bene-
fit of industrial teachers,
foremen and technicians ; 95
fellowships lasting nine
months each in SENAI
schools for the training of
industrial instructors in me-
chanics, electricity and tex-
tiles.
Since the scheme is es-
sentially a partnership, the
ILO, at the request of the
Brazilian Government, has
provided technical assist-
ance to strengthen SENAI
and to enable it to extend its
services. 1 la has provided
15 school instructors and
granted 13 fellowships for
foreign study by technicians
and teachers from SENAI.
It has also provided com-
plete correspondence cour-
ses in such subjects as
carpentry, boitermaking,
welding, motor engineering
and machine-designing.
The response of the
countries of Latin America
to this type of technical aid
has been encouraging. For
instance, ILO has been able
to place, under the SENAI
scheme, 20 of the Ecua-
dorian workers and foremen
from various trades for
whom it has accepted train-
ing responsibility.
This contribution-in-kind,
however, has not been con-
fined to SENAI and ILO.
The Brazilian Government
has offered a long list of
services which concern
practically ail th√© agencies
participating in the Expand-
ed Technical Assistance
programme. These include
a laboratory for obtaining
agricultural data, an inter-
national seminar on pro-
blems of public adminis-
tration, scholarships for
special courses in public
administration, vocational
! raining fellowships, and va-
rious medical facilites, Most
of these offers have proved
most valuable and represent
the cost equivalent of the
$460, 000 which Brazil has
pledged as her contribution
to the programme.
