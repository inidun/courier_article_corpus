Television has probably had the gr e atest social
impact over the past century. Its predominance
will likely continue for a long time to come as a result
of the development of cable and satellite distribu-
tion and local channels and the move towards digi t a l
instead of analogue transmission. O ver the past
three decades, the total number of television recei-
ve rs has gr own by 55 times in the developing wo r l d
and their density (number in relation to populat i o n
size) by around 16. The North-South divide is
smaller for television than for the other media.
The so-called inform ation age, marked by the
t riumph of the Intern e t , s t a rted in the early
1980s and really took off in the latter half of the
1 9 9 0 s. In 1981, only some 200 people we r e
connected to the Intern e t .The turning point came
in 1986, when the number of users quintupled. B y
the middle of 1999, 56 million computers we r e
Internet-connected, an increase of almost 20 mil-
lion over the previous 12 months. As the chart at
right show s , the Internet phenomenon is still largely
confined to the rich countries, which have 95 per
cent of the wo r l d â€™s Internet-connected computers.
The North-South gap is wider than for any of the
other media (see article page 9).

The main media (Internet, t e l e v i s i o n , ra d i o, written press) 
a re continuing to gro w, but at very different ra t e s. The North-South gap is vertiginous
for the Internet, and persistently wide for the other media
The printed press is the only one of the mass
media whose situation (in terms of circulation per
thousand inhabitants) is declining on the global
s c a l e .The decline is ve ry marked in the U. S . and the
European Union, but less steep in Japan. In the
d e veloping countri e s , the extension of schooling
and democrat i z ation in the 1980s heralded an
explosion in the number of titles.The increase of
newspaper circulation has been ve ry modest,
h owe ve r , doubling in just under 30 ye a rs ,i n c l u d i n g
in the least developed countri e s. It seems that news-
paper circulation may have reached its ceiling.
It was once predicted that the coming of television
would wipe out radio. However, radio continues
to spread.The coming of the transistor in the 1960s
made possible the manufacture of lightwe i g h t ,l ow -
c o s t ,e n e r g y - e f ficient receive rs and helps to explain
why radio continues to be the mass medium best
suited to poor and isolated regi o n s. But the gr ow t h
in the density of receive rs is more moderate than that
of television (a fourfold increase in 30 years in the
developing world).The North-South gap in radio,
which was narr ower than for TV in 1970, h a d
become wider by 1997.
