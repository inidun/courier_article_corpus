UN E S C O's activities are based on the conviction that it is possible to influence the
c o u rse of world events and that tomorr ow ’s world is being constructed today. And the
structure will be all the more solid if it rests on clear ethical principles and a sharp
awareness of the gap between what exists and what should exist.
The future of humankind is threatened by real dangers. In too many parts of the
wo r l d , human dignity is still being abused by war and by exclusion of the most vulnerable
and needy. Inequality and poverty are growing.The walls of urban segregation are rising.
The education of women is being forgotten.And people’s violence towards each other is
matched by the violence they inflict on nature,thereby jeopardizing their own future.
Lack of foresight and the race for quick profit have led to intensive exploitation of
natural resources, ecological disasters, ever more serious problems of water supply and
desertification as well as pollution of every kind.Who can say for sure if scientific and
technological progress will bring more solutions than new perils?
The rapid gr owth of biotechnology and the possibilities of human genetic engi n e e ri n g
are even leading people to reconsider the ve ry definition of what constitutes a human
b e i n g .We risk being enslaved by our own inventions and becoming pri s o n e rs in a maze of
our own creation unless we are very vigilant and take a clear ethical stand.
We should all be concerned about what lies ahead.The future must not be left to the
r avages of blind and cynical forces. Ethical deficits seem to me to be more serious in the long
t e rm than budget defic i t s.The ethics of the future is sustained by the belief that there is no
contradiction between solidarity with the present generation and solidarity with future
g e n e r at i o n s.Both embody the same rejection of exclusion and injustice, the same reminder
of the bond that unites all people on eart h .This ethics does not make vain prescriptions for
a future which never arri ve s. It starts here and now, with care for others and the
d e t e rm i n ation to pass on to future generations a heritage which is not irr e t ri e vably damaged.
One sometimes hears it said that “the future is too complicated and too uncertain,so
let’s make the best of the present”.My answer is that it is too easy to wait for problems to
a rise before tackling them and to take action only in emergencies. Such short - s i g h t e d
reasoning leaves only the choice of yielding or adapting to eve n t s. If we are not to be at their
m e r cy, if we are to regain control of our own future, if we are to escape routine and
obsolescence, we must start thinking again in the long term by looking as far ahead as
possible and anticipating developments.
Only by adopting this kind of pers p e c t i ve can we counter uncertainty about the future and
c r e ate room for action now.And it is action we need.A n t i c i p ating means fighting apat hy and
i n d i f f e r e n c e , awakening people’s consciences,opening their eyes to tomorr ow ’s dangers and
r e a d j u s t i n g, if need be, t o d ay ’s decisions. Foresight is the basis of effective action.
Foresight calls for two qualities: comprehension and imagi n at i o n . C o m p r e h e n s i o n
because the future does not come out of the blue. It leads back to earlier states of awa r e n e s s ,
to rules or an absence of rules whose reasons must be unders t o o d .The effort of linking the
present and the future in this way will unite the world and turn it into a whole,producing
the overall grasp which is precisely the meaning of the verb “to comprehend.”This effort
would remain an abstract one if it was not enriched and illuminated by imagi n at i o n .
Thinking about the twe n t y - first century means dreaming, c o n j u ring up models which
are perhaps contradictory, i m a gining new worlds and utopias. A l l owing ours e l ves to
u n d e rstand reality and to imagine the possible, to achieve the possible and to attempt the
impossible. n
