Page 12. FEBRUARY 1953 UNESCO
A people celebrates
in music and poetry...
by Charles Seeger,
Head of Music and Arts Division, Pan American Union
International MusicCouncil, one of the young-
est of Unesco's children,
adopted at its First General
Assembly in February 1951 a
resolution to hold a conference
. on Music in General Education.
This is now scheduled for the
summer of this year in Brussels.
A number of problems are
posed by this project, some of
them met with in other fields of
endeavour, but all of them here
with a character of their own.
First, there is the question :
why limit the conference to
music in general education alone
- why not include the whole
problem of musical education,
or, as the Americans call it,
"music education" ? Second :
which should predominate-the
viewpoint of the professional
musician or that of the pro-
fessional educator ?
The first question is not
easily answered and may cause
considerable debate. As a
matter of fact, music education
has three main branches, whose
adepts in many parts of the
world are not any too congenial
towards each other, viz. : edu-
cation of the professional musi-
cian ; education of the scholar
or musicologist ; education of the
layman and his children. Adepts
of the first two are specialists
in music. The last-mentioned
are not specialists in music,
though they may be in other
fields of activity.
Up to relatively modern times,
and still in many regions, pro-
fessional taught professional,
and layman, the layman and his
children. The one inherited,
carried and transmitted quite a
different music tradition than
did the other. Their separation
as social classes maintained the
separate traditions in compara-
tive purity. But the increas-
ingly elaborate organization of
culture in the advanced civili-
zations has thrown this relative
balance out of joint. Social and
industrial, and, later, techno-
logical innovations have found
application in the field of music,
and mass media of communica-
tion have enlarged the distribu-
tion of some traditions and
narrowed that of others.
This skill, developed by the
inhabitants of cities, naturally
made use of the traditions best
known to them-those of popu-
lar and fine art, which were
entirely dependent or thought
to be, upon the techniques of
music writing (2written tradi-
tion). The great majority of
people were dependent upon a
vastly older technique-that of
unwritten or oral tradition. So,
about a century ago, profes-
sional musicians who were
interested in education decided
that the thing to do was to
teach the hordes of children
that were coming into state
sunnorted schools how to appre-
ciate and read written music.
The fallacy of this effort,
which has been so sincerely
propagandized by professional
musicians, lies in the fact that
there are not now, never have
been and never in the forseeable
future can be, enough competent
musicians who are also compe-
tent teachers to handle the vast
populations in our schools. For
unless the teacher is competent
as a musician, the professional
musician will judge, quite right-
ly, that the work is worse than
none. And unless the musician
is competent as a teacher, the
educator, equally rightly, will
make the same judgment. The
effort to build a musically lite-
rate public in the image of the
professional musician has, fur-
thermore, been resisted success-
fully by generations of children- particularly boys.
In the past, general educators
and administrators have never
given this effort the support that
musicians have demanded. Now,
at least in the United States,
they are even beginning to ad-
vance reasons for their opposi-
tion. In short, basic education
in music and music in basic
education have gotten off these
past hundred years to a bad
start. Or, to change the meta-
phor, the cake has lovely frost-
ing, but is hollow inside. For
music is mainly in the making
of it-not in the listening to
someone else making it.
The implications are not far
to seek. While small sections
of populations will continue
serious study of the traditions of
the fine and popular arts, and
an increasing minority will mix
the professional and lay tradi-
tions, the great mass of the
people will continue to be taught
by persons like themselves-
persons who make music of a
kind quite different from that
of the professional tradition.
In short, layman will continue
to teach the layman and his
children. But it cannot be the
old type of layman-the folk-
singer who handed on, practi-
cally uncriticized, the art he had
learned. A new type of lay
teacher must oe evolved-one
who can utilize some of the pro-
fessional techniques but who
will steadfastly resist the effort
(that has failed so disastrously)
to cast the layman and his
children into the mould of the
utterly incompetent profes-
sional.
It is here that the scholar,
that shadowy and almost unre-
cognized figure who has re-
mained in the background of the
controversy, must be called
from his preoccupation with
history to study oral tradition,
discover how it works and how
it may be adjusted to written
tradition and to the new con-
ditions under which both flow-
rish today. With his mediation,
too, it may be possible to answer
our second question : Which
should predominate-the view-
point of the professional musi-
cian or that of the professional
educator ?
There is a real quandary here.
The points of view of the
musician and the general
educator are becoming more
and more clearly opposed to
each other. The musician tra-
ditionally emphasizes subject
matter-devotion of the person
to the art. The educator, on the
other hand, has increasingly
more interest in the growth of
the child than in subject matter.
As the musician sees it, man
must serve art. As the educator
sees it, art must serve man.
Any sane general policy must
allow leeway for both. Each
should dominate in its proper
place.
May we not hope for a balance
between these opposed views, a
willingness on both sides to sit
down and work out, with what
help scholarship may afford, a
basic treaty to live and let live,
to co-onerate and advance side-
by-side ? This is not impossible.
But a lot of hatchets will have
to be buried.
