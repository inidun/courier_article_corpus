rXTER will be one of the most
divisive environmental
and political issues of the
next fifteen ortwentyyears.
The conflicts of the past
over land and oil will seem
minor in comparison to those over
water. Conflict-resolution abilities
will be as important as hydrology
and engineering for ensuring future
water supplies.
The Middle East is one place
where problems could appear, along
with northern Africa from Morocco
to Egypt. Though water consump¬
tion generally is lower than available
supply, the scales could tip the other
way. Over the past ten years, drought
has diminished the supply of the
Nile, for instance, while consump¬
tion rates in Egypt have risen. And
the Nile is not exclusively the pro¬
vince of Egypt; other countries too
will be seeking a share of its water.
Turkey and Iraq are arguing over
rights to the waters ofthe Euphrates;
Mexico and the United States have
litigated over the waters of the
Colorado; Bangladesh is at the
mouth of the Ganges, but has no
control over activities upriver in
other countries.
The humid tropics are another
area where water is a problem; the
word "humid" should not be mis¬
construed as implying limitless sup¬
plies ofwater. In some areas there is
not enough rainfall to provide good
vegetation cover for the prevention
of erosion. Soil erosion can claim
over 100 tonnes of soil per hectare,
and this is soil which is produced at
a rate of only about one tonne per
hectare per year. Land is being lost
also to salinization, waterlogging and
compaction, which are reducing
productivity just as population
increases require the opposite.
Population growth is a very serious
problem. Most ofitwill occur in the
developing world: Africa, Latin
America, South Asia and East Asia.
Urbanization problems are a conse¬
quence: the urban population in
these regions has already tripled
from 507 million in 1965 to 1.5 billion
in 1990, and it is expected to rise to
2.2 billion by the year 2000. It is
hardly surprising that land, air and
water resources in the burgeoning
metropolitan areas are stretched to
their limits.
Cities without safe water
Urbanization and population
growth are having serious repercus¬
sions on health. Notwithstanding
major investments in water supply
and sanitation systems, an estimated
40,000 children die daily (almost 15
million peryear) as a result ofwater-
related diseases. Over a third of those
are deaths of children under five.
Ten years ago three-quarters of
the urban communities in develop¬
ing countries lacked adequate,
healthywater supplies. Today, with
population growth and the increased
concentration ofpeople in cities, the
situation has not improved. Water
supplies in many rural areas are also
unhealthy.
The single most water-consuming
human activity is agriculture. With a
few exceptions, as in Israel, where
new technologies are used, irriga¬
tion, essential to the great advances
in agricultural productivity, is
wasteful. Much of the water evapo¬
rates, especially in the warm, dry cli¬
mates where irrigation is most
needed. Some estimates suggest that
70 per cent of total water use, and 90
per cent ofirretrievable consumptive
use of water, is due to irrigation.
Worldwide, the amount of irrigated
land has grown fivefold in the course
of the present century, from 47.3
million hectares in 1900 to 272 mil¬
lion in 1990. Not infrequently,
would-be agricultural users ofwater
and city-dwellers in need of drink¬
ing water and sanitation systems
find themselves in direct conflict
over available supplies.
A water resource only recently

T
becoming understood is ground¬
water, usually quite sweet water
stored in underground aquifers. In
recent years there has been increas¬
ing alarm at the extent to which
these invisible reservoirs, traditio¬
nally deemed "safe" from pollution,
have been invaded byheavy metals
and toxins, and by agricultural
chemicals seeping down from the
Earth's surface. In Europe, the first
aquifer layer, lying under many of
the continent's countries, is almost
entirely polluted, most of it by pol¬
lutants in general agricultural che¬
micals. A major aquifer in North
America, the Ogalala, is also being
contaminated.
Water, weather and
climate
Despite considerable progress in
understandingwater and hydrology,
clearlymuch more needs to be done.
Unesco's International Hydrological
Programme has been dealing with
these problems for twenty-five years.
The present preoccupation is how
to establish intelligentwater-resource
strategies for sustainable develop¬
ment, as water is clearly the limiting
factor. No longer will it be sufficient
for engineers and hydrologists merely
to identify, and then build systems to
tap water supplies for human use.
At this point we lack some very
important data specifically on water
and hydrological cycles.
While in many countries there is
good hydrological monitoring, in
others there is less. In Africa today,
where population growth and water-
resource needs seem to be on a col¬
lision course, there is no effective
continent-wide, co-ordinated and
reliably working hydrological net¬
work. Beyond local or regional
hydrology, we now know that cli¬
mate andweather are intricately tied
to water- and land-use patterns and
to human activity. Yet there is no
global network to consider the inter¬
relationships between the hydrolo
gical cycle, oceans, weather and
climate.
Like other environmental issues,
water is onlyone strand in a complex
web, neither understandable nor
manageable in isolation from the
other strands. More hydrologists,
engineers and pollution-control spe¬
cialists are called for. More under¬
standing of the inter-environmental
issues is required, but just as impor¬
tant will be an understanding of the
human dimension culture, history,
settlement patterns, economics.
Dealing with water will also require
rare political co-operation among a
wide range of groups, nations,
regions and continents. This will take
great skill and great sensitivity. And
above all there must be a strong
awareness of the unity of the planet
and the interrrelationship of the
destinies of those who live on it.
