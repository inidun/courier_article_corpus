UNESCO is a factor of hope,because it is the one international organization which,
through all its progr a m m e s , respects and defends what is of unive rsal wo rth and dignity
in the mat e rial and spiritual heritage of all cultures, and thereby, the absolute
dignity of all human beings. . . .
G l o b a l i z ation is accelerating with dramatic speed, presenting a global challenge which
demands a global answe r.Yet the response must be made with all due respect for cultural
d i ve rsity and identity, for that priceless individual component that makes up the true dignity
of our many peoples.
But UNESCO can only go on providing the world with such hope, and such defence,
if it proves itself to be an adequate world instru m e n t . UN E S C O is not an end in itself. UN E S C O
is a world service,a tool which is at once delicate,highly complex, and precious. Huma-
nity may all the better avail itself of such a tool if all the wo r l d ’s states—and peoples—agr e e
once again to make proper use of it, and so contribute to its efficiency and universality.
UNESCO must once more represent the whole world, with no exceptions. I pledge to do
my best,in the course of my stewardship, to persuade those who stand outside to return
or to join.
But criticisms,not all of them unfair,have been leveled against this great instrument:
and failings,where verified,must be made good.The purpose of sound management is,
a g a i n , not an end in itself, but a duty to ensure that our institution fully discharges its gr e at
task as a true world serv i c e , responsible and accountable to the world—and to the wo r l d ’s
taxpayers.
Our resources are therefore not unlimited,nor should we spread ourselves too thin. I
propose that we streamline our activities within the limits of our bu d g e t s , and closely focus
upon those programmes which are our true mandate—not for the sake of fashionable aus-
t e ri t y, but in order to make a real impact where best we may, and where truly we must,p r o-
vide our needed service: in our ongoing war against poverty, through education and the
nurturing of human resources.
I suggest pursuit of our most practically conceived progr a m m e s , in co-operation with
leading institutions, scientists and scholars around the world, in terms of our four great
directives, on behalf of education,science,culture,and communication.
UN E S C O is a challenging paradox . It cannot lapse into a mere club for intellectuals, bu t
it must serve as a forum for international intellectual exchange.It cannot pretend to be
a research institution but must keep abreast of and stimulate research.It is not an opera-
tional agency, yet it must see that global ethics for peace, justice and solidarity, through
international co-operation in education, science, culture and communication, are both
morally observed and tangibly applied. F i n a l l y, UN E S C O is not a funding agency, a l t h o u g h
it must provide catalytic funds to generate further funding: in order to demonstrate that
ideals only take shape through action. . . .
In the whirl of this changing age, let us stand firm and faithful to our enduring pur-
pose: building peace in the minds of men. ■
