No one ever learns very much
about Santo Domingo in school
except, perhaps, that this big
West Indian island, colonized by
France and Spain, is today divided
into two independent countries, Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.
Few textbooks ever go to the trouble
of describing what happened on this
island during the first years of the
Spanish conquest. And yet, it is a
story worth telling. It has been told,
and remarkably well, by a 19th Cen¬
tury Dominican writer, Manuel de
Jesus Galvan, in his only novel, a book
which has become one of the classics
of Latin American literature.
The story of Enriquillo (its English
translation is entitled The Croßs and
the Sword) begins during the early
years of the Spanish conquest. Chris¬
topher Columbus had just discovered
the New World and, on his first
voyage, he landed on the island of
by
Rodney
Stewart
Hispaniola, an earthly paradise which
was inhabited by "benign, intelligent
and handsome people".
The Conquistadors lost little time
putting an end to this. Barely ten
years after the discovery of the island,
the Indians were reduced to slavery
and their leaders had perished by fire
and sword. Some diehards fled to the
mountains where they continued to
put up a fight with Spanish soldiers at
their heels. But most of the Indians
of whom Columbus wrote "there is no
better people in this world" degener¬
ated rapidly and "learned to live by
abject hypocrisy, lying, theft and
treachery."
The hero of Galvan's novel is Gua-
rocuya, a young cacique, the descen¬
dant and successor of the chieftains
of the Indian kingdom of Jaragua on
the western tip of the island. Saved
from massacre, he was befriended as
a child by two noble Spaniards, Cap¬
tain Don Diego Velasquez and a future
prelate, Don Bartolomé de Las Casas,

friend and protector of the Indians,
who became his godfather.
Guarocuya was brought up in the
Christian faith and baptized Enrique
(familiarly known as Enriquillo) . The
Franciscans at Vera Paz gave him
"the best education available in those
days" and he was also taught horse¬
manship and fencing. But though he
was educated as a young Spanish
gentleman, Enriquillo still had to
suffer the humiliation of seeing his
name inscribed on the list of serfs and
of watching his fellow Indians treated
as slaves.
A few years later, Enriquillo was
placed under the tutelage of good-
natured Don Francisco de Valenzuela,
a landowner in the region of San
Juan de la Maguana in the centre of
the island. Don Francisco believed in
treating Indians as human beings.
With Enriquillo, he went much
further he treated him as his own
son and trained him to run his estate.
But Don Francisco had a son,
Andres, a young playboy interested in
anything but work. Andres was jea¬
lous of Enriquillo and swore revenge,
but bided his time. Meanwhile,
Enriquillo was happy for the first time
in his life. He was engaged to marry
Mencia, daughter of a Spanish noble¬
man and an Indian princess, whom
he had known since childhood. His
future looked bright. He told the
Viceroy Don Diego Colon, Columbus's
son, "the work which my lord Don
Francisco de Valenzuela has given me
in La Maguana suits me so well that
I find it more like play than work."
When Don Francisco died, Enriquillo

and his young wife were at the mercy
of Andres and Mencia's kinsman,
Pedro de Mojica, as evil as he was
ugly (Galvan remained true to the
Spanish romantic convention that
ugliness of soul is always betrayed by
physical ugliness and beauty of soul
revealed by physical beauty).
First Andres and his accomplices
swindled Enriquillo out of his
inheritance and tried to take
away his wife. Then they began to
humiliate him. Enriquillo was deeply
religious, but hate got the better of
him: "Death is preferable to the
humiliation of the soul", he exclaim¬
ed even eternal death.
He sought justice but, under the
colonial juridical system, there was
no hope of remedy. His protectors
were far away Las
Casas in Cuba, and the
Viceroy entangled in
plots and intrigues. A
hunted man, Enriquillo
resorted to armed pro¬
test, establishing his
headquarters in the
Bahoruco mountains,
where a great number
of Indians gathered
under his command.
Galvan described how
the party set off for
the mountains:
"Vasa, one of Enri-
quillo's lesser caciques,
reined in his horse.
Gazing at the distant
summits of the Baho¬
ruco, he said solemnly:
"Yonder lies liberty.'
His companions echoed
his words... Enriquillo
said: "Yes, friends;
yonder lies liberty, yon¬
der lies a life fit for
men. How different
from the life that slaves
lead! Yonder lies the duty to fight
boldly in defence of that life and that
libertygifts for which, as good
Christians, we must give thanks to
the Lord God Almighty'."
A' first-rate strategist, Enriquillo
formed an army to fight the Spanish
troops sent to capture him. He won
one victory after another. And his
army steadily increased: "Victory had
given courage to the timid, and every
day fresh bands of serfs reached the
Bahoruco in search of liberty."
Against these rebels, the Spanish
dispatched a series of expeditions, but
Enriquillo could not be stopped. For
nearly fifteen years, he fought from
his mountain stronghold, determined
to accept no peace proposals short of
a guarantee of complete freedom for
his people.
In the end, he achieved his aim. In
1533, Charles V granted him the right
to choose a region where he could
settle with his vassals. His choice fell
upon a site at the foot of the Cibao
mountains, a short day's journey from
Santo Domingo.
"In that fertile region", Galvan
writes, "he founded a town which
still exists, under the name of Santa
Maria de Boya, a sacred place of re¬
fuge where the surviving natives of
Hispaniola could enjoy peace and
liberty." Enriquillo did not survive
his triumph very long, but "his name
lives and will live for ever... a great
lake perpetuates it among the lofty
mountains of the Bahoruco..."
This is the story of Enriquillo. But
around these events, Galvan has
woven a series of secondary episodes.
Max Henriquez Urena, in a foreword
to The Cross and the Sword, notes
that upon each of his characters he
succeeded in impressing an individual
stamp as vividly on the creatures of

one sense, the political career of its
author. The Spanish colonial regime
had ended in 1821 and Galvan's
childhood he was born in 1834
coincided with a period of Haitian
domination.
In his youth, he witnessed the
awakening of Santo Domingo as an
Independent nation. But his country
was at war with Haiti, a war which
seemed destined to drag on and on.
At the age of 25, Galvan became
the secretary of the President
of the Dominican Republic,
General Pedro Santana. To thwart
an invasion by Haiti, he supported the
re-annexation of the Dominican Re¬
public by Spain a state of affairs
which only lasted four years.
The historical parallel of The Cross
and the Sword is easy to follow. Just
as Enriquillo's Indians
in the Bahoruco moun¬
tains had no hope of
holding out indefinitely
and their only chance
lay in an appeal to the
Spanish crown, so in
1860, the only hope for
the people of Santo
Domingo of staving off
Haitian domination lay
in .calling on Queen
Isabella II of Spain.

Pedro de Mojica) as on historical
characters: Ovando, an energetic,
single-minded but inhuman governor;
Juan de Grijalva, a courageous soldier
and the unsuccessful suitor of beauti¬
ful Maria de Cuellar; Diego Colon, the
cautious Viceroy, or the priest Las
Casas, who led a bold crusade to save
the Indians.
The inclusion of novelettes within
the larger novel, Henriquez
Urena points out, is in the tra¬
dition of Don Quixote. Without
renouncing the privileges of fantasy,
Galvan remained true to his historical
material. Written in a pure, simple
style, The Cross and the Sword rep¬
resents eight years of solid work.

The Cross and the
Sword is without a
doubt the best novel
produced by the "In-
dianist" movement in
Latin America at the
end of the 19th Cen¬
tury. In those Latin
American countries
where the Indian had
disappeared, he con¬
tinued to live on in
poetry and in literature
as a symbol of patriot-
Ism and freedom. But
though Galvan's novel
is pro-Indian, he plead¬
ed their cause in his own way.
He underlined Enriquillo's genero¬
sity and admitted the cruelty of cer¬
tain Spaniards. Yet he still made his
hero a sincere Catholic and his novel
ends happily thanks to the grace of
Charles V.
Galvan wrote only one novel, but it
was enough to place him in the front
rank of 19th century Latin Ameri¬
can writers. Although his book ap¬
peared in 1879, it^ has remained
almost unknown outside the Spanish-
speaking world.
It has now been published by the
Indiana University Press in the
United States in collaboration with the
Organization of American States and
Unesco as part of a Latin American
Classics Series. The English trans¬
lation, The Cross and the Sword, is the
work of the English novelist, Robert
Graves, author of I Claudius and
Claudius the God.
