The United Nations International
Research and Training Institute for
the Advancement of Women,
which commenced activities in
1979, is an emanation of the World
Conference of the International
Women's Year (1975).
INSTRAW is an autonomous
body within the United Nations
system, whose main objective is to
contribute, through research,
training and information, to the
integration of women in the
economic and social development
process and to their participation
in allieveis of politicallife.
Over the past five years,
INSTRAW bas engaged in a wide
range of activities on women's
work in the informat sector, their
role in the media, the place they
occupy in credit, sanitation and
water supply programmes, and
the harnessing of new and
renewable energy sources. Its
programme of work for the 1994-
1995 biennium is centred on four
main themes : the improvement of
women's status ; statistics and
indicators concerning women ;
women, the environment and
sustainable development ; and
communication for development.
The Institute does not receive
annual subsidies under the
contributions to the United
Nations regular budget, and it
depends entirely on voluntary
contributions from UN Member
States, governmental and non-
governmental organizations,
foundations, and private and
other sources.

UNICEF'was established as a
temporary body in December
1946 by the General Assembly ta
provide emergency assistance ta
children in war-ravaged countries
of Europe. In 1953, it was placed
on a permanent footing and its
mandate was broadened to help
children in developing countries.
UNICEF promotes the
survival, protection and
development of children and their
mothers in such fields as health,
nutrition, education, water and
sanitation, and provides relief and
rehabilitation assistance in
emergencies (vaccines, basic
medicines, medical equipment
and food supplements). One of its
most important public health
achievements has been in
immunization. In what has been
called"the largest single
collaborative peace-time effort in
wor) d history", thé Universat
Child Immunization (UCI)
programme launched by
UNICEF and the World Health
Organization in 1984 successfully
vaccinated 80 per cent of the
world's children by 1990 against
six major childhood killer diseases
(measles, poliomyelitis,
tuberculosis, diphtheria,
whooping cough and tetanus),
thus saving the lives of some 9 to
10 million children in the
developing world.
UNICEF also supports the
implementation of the
Convention on the Rights of the
Child, which entered into force as
Internationa)) aw on 2 September
1990. As of mid-August 1995, the
Convention had been ratified by
177 countries.
Supported by 38 National
Committees, mostly in
industrialized countries, UNICEF
co-operates in programmes in 144
countries. It depends mainly on
voluntary contributions from
governmental and non-
governmental sources. Total
expenditure for 1994 amounted ta
$999 million.

In 1984 the General Assembly
decided that the activities of the
Voluntary Fund for the UN
Decade for Women should be
continued by the establishment of
a separate entity, UNIFEM, in
autonomous association with the
UN Development Programme
(UNDP).
UNIFEM seeks to improve the
lives of women in developing
countries, to promote the
involvement of women in the
decision-making process of
mainstream development
programmes, and their
achievement of equal status
through economic and social
development. UNIFEM considers
that the best approach is to
strengthen organizations created
and managed by women
themselves by providing direct
technical and financial support.
UNIFEM focuses its efforts in
three main fields :agriculture and
food security, trade and industry,
and national planning. The Fund
also seeks to provide women with
access to credit, training, science
and technology, information and
other tools of development, and
encourages links and partnership
between women at grassroots
level and national and
international institutions.

a particular field, which co-

the developing countries, which
are the focal points of its world
