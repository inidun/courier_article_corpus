This golden stag (see detail in
colour, page 23) is a superb
example of typical Scythian
animal art. Discovered in a
tomb in the Kuban region,
north-east of the Black Sea, it
was made by a master-goldsmith
of the steppes early in the 6th
century B.C. In the words of
the Soviet archaeologist,
Aleksandr Shkurko, an authority
on early Scythian art, "The artist
was not unduly concerned with
modelling the animal's body or
adding precise detail. What
held his attention was its inner
qualitiesits strength, speed and
essential wildness. The
decorative treatment of the horns
and the compactness of the
composition confer on the image
an almost heraldic appearance."
The stag was a favourite theme
in the art of the Scythians.

THE sweep and substance of
the Scythian world have only
recently been fully revealed,
although the existence of the Scy¬
thians was recorded long ago, and
they should not be regarded as one
of the forgotten peoples of history.
Herodotus, writing about them in
the fifth century B.C., included in his
detailed account a number of Scythian
or Greek legends concerning their
origins, and stated that the lands
which they occupied had previously
belonged to the Cimmerians.
The flatlands north of the Black
Sea, home of the Scythians who
caught Herodotus' attention when
they came down to do business in
the Greek trading-colonies on the
coast, are studded with kurgans.
These burial mounds of earth, erected
by the various nomadic tribes which
roamed across the steppes, were
themselves the subject of many a
legend, and the treasure-seekers who
plundered them in the past were
certainly rewarded on more than one
occasion.

a dynamic culture on thi

steppes
Many of them had been built by
the Scythians, and it was here that
the first archaeologists unearthed
outstanding examples of an art form
characteristic of Scythian culture and
dating mainly from the fifth to the
third centuries B.C. Since then, hard¬
ly a year has passed without the de¬
light of fresh discoveries by Ukrainian
archaeologists.
Excavations began a considerable
time ago. In 1763, a rich burial
mound of the early Scythian period
near Elizavetgrad (now Kirovograd)
yielded a large number of gold and
silver objects, including an iron aki-
nakes (the short dagger of the Scy¬
thians) the scabbard and hilt of which
were decorated in the ancient Eastern
style with fantastic animals and
anthropomorphic deities, gathered
round a sacred tree. These inte¬
resting finds were placed in the
Kunstkammer, Russia's first real
museum, which had been founded
by Peter the Great in 1714.
The Kunstkammer already con¬
tained a number of gold objects-
later identified as Scythianwhich had
been found in Siberian kurgans and
sent as gifts to Peter the Great in
1715 and 1716 by Nikita Demidov,
the owner of mines and metalworks
in the Urals, and by the Governor of
Tobolsk, Prince Gagarin. In 1718, a
special government decree ordered
"the collecting from earth and water
of old inscriptions, ancient weapons,
dishes and everything old and
unusual."
The Kunstkammer's "marvellous
and mysterious collection of Siberians
antiquities", as it was still called byr

early nineteenth-century archaeolo¬
gists, was only explained and iden¬
tified when archaeological investiga¬
tions over a wide area gradually revea¬
led a considerable degree of cultural
unity in the wide belt of steppe-land,
foothills and upland pastures which
stretched between the 40th and 50th
parallels of latitude, from the Danube
in the west all the way to the Great
Wall of China in the easta distance
of more than 7,000 kilometres.
From one end to the other of this
territory, archaeologists have unear¬
thed identical pieces of horse gear,
iron swords, triangular arrowheads
and ornaments, all dating from the
Scythian period, while cultural simi¬
larities between different regions
are reflected in the widespread use
of imagery in the so-called "Scytho-
Siberian animal style."
But these links existed even ear¬
lier, and can certainly be clearly
detected in the pre-Scythian, Cim¬
merian period (i.e. the eighth century
B.C.). Convincing evidence of this
is provided by the objects found in
the Arzhan kurgan in the Tuva S.S.R.,
far to the east (see article page 38).
This ruined tomb of a military leader
yielded not only a number of items
similar to finds from the Ukraine and
Bulgaria, but also scraps of woven
cloth of Iranian origin, pre-dating
by almost 200 years the famous
Iranian carpet discovered during exca¬
vations of the Pazyryk kurgans of the
Altai (see article page 31).
Thus, in Cimmerian times, the con¬
ditions already existed for the esta¬
blishment of contacts between widely
separated territories, and for the
creation of a generalized, semi-noma¬
dic and stock-raising economy, in
which the dominance of horse-
breeding permitted mobility over long
distances.
The network of relationships bet¬
ween different tribes made up for the
lack of natural resources, and of
metal deposits in particular, in diffe¬
rent regions. The vast area covered
by Scythian culture, where the most
outstanding artifacts were made of
gold, silver or high-quality bronze,
contained few enough localities
where the first two of these metals
could be found, while tin, without
which copper could not be transfor¬
med into bronze "and which existed
in Central Europe and Bohemia, was
totally absent in the lands stretching
from the Danube as far as eastern
Kazakhstan.
Of course, there was no direct or
permanent contact between the no¬
madic tribes inhabiting the western
and eastern extremities of this world;
the elements which composed their
common culture were, so to speak,
"shuttled" from tribe to tribe, often
losing their stamp of origin in the
process.
We should also remember that
these breeders of cattle and horses,
whether Cimmerians or Scythians,
werefirst and foremostwell-armed
and highly mobile horse-soldiers,
whose rapidly moving war-parties,
according to Herodotus, penetrated
deep into Asia Minor.
Herodotus' accounts have since
been confirmed by ancient Eastern
sources, and by documentary and
archaeological evidence from Assyria
in particular. Reports by scouts of
the Assyrian king contained in the
archive of clay tablets found in the
Assyrian capital, Nineveh, refer to
the appearance of Cimmerians in
Asia Minor as early as the middle of
the 8th century B.C.
The participation of Scythians in
a devastating attack on Assyria a
century later is mentioned in a
chronicle of the Babylonian king
Nabopolassar which relates events
in 616-609 B.C., and in a 5th
century account of the sack of Nin¬
eveh, by the Armenian historian
Movses Horenatsi.

tresses in Transcaucasia (at Karmir-
MY KINGDOM
FOR A HORSE
Some Scythian jewels
reveal numerous details
of the dress, way of life
and customs of these
nomads of the steppes.
The two bearded Scythian
riders decorating the
ends of this torque, or
open necklace, of twisted
gold are one example.
The figures wear
ankle-length caftans tied
at the waist and long
trousers held by a strap
beneath the boot.
They ride bareback and
without stirrups. Their
mounts emerge from
the ends of the torque,
woven of six gold strands
bound in an intricately
decorated sheath inlaid
with enamel. The
horses' manes and the
harnesses and bridle bits
are rendered with great
precision. The torque,
of Greco-Scythian style
and weighing over
260 grammes, was found
in 1830. It encircled
the neck of a chieftain
in a 4th century B.C.
grave in the Crimea.
Blur, near Erivan) and in the central
region of ancient Urartu, near Lake
Van (in present-day Turkey), have
brought to light a number of items of
horse gear, iron weapons and beads
similar to objects found in ancient
Scythian burials of the Black Sea
region.
The Scythian connexion with Asia
Minor is clearly reflected in the so-
called "Ziwiyeh treasure" from Saq-
qez, in Iranian Kurdistan, discovered
during the Second World War.
Among the objects found here, which
were subsequently proved to have
come not from a treasure hoard but
from a tomb constructed in the
seventh century B.C., is an outstand¬
ing group of artifacts in which images
characteristic of both ancient Near
Eastern and Scythian art are
combined.
The golden objects in Scythian
style found at Ziwiyeh are similar to
finds from Scythian burial mounds,
such as the sword with a gold-covered

hilt and scabbard unearthed in 1763
in the Elizavetgrad (Kirovograd) kur-
gan in the Ukraine, and the gold-
handled sword and axe from the
Kelermes kurgans in the Kuban re¬
gion, excavated in 1902.
All these objects combine Scythian
motifs (reclining deer) with ancient
Eastern imagery (the holy tree with
its attendant divinities and fantastic
animals), and it is probably correct
to consider that they are imitations of
Urartean artifacts, modified by the
addition of elements in purely Scy¬
thian style.
Attempts have been made to re¬
late the birth of Scythian art to the
period of Scythian campaigns in
Asia Minor, but this theory is dispro¬
ved by the examples of Scythian and
pre-Scythian art discovered in Si¬
beria, which pre-date those from
Ziwiyeh (i. e. 7th century B.C.), but
are also decorated in the animal style.
The term "Scythian" is nowadays
applied to a large number of ethni¬
cally unrelated tribes, characterized
by a strong Iranian influence in their
personal and place-names. Its appli¬
cation is frequently limited to the
tribes inhabiting the coastal flatlands
of the Black Sea region.
But archaeologists have shown
that the early Scythian monuments
of this region are related to ancient
steppe cultures which go back as far
as the middle of the second millen¬
nium B.C. In this article the term
is used in a broader sense, including
in the "Scythian" world a vast mass
of tribes sharing the same economic
and cultural existence and spread
over a much wider area.
From the sixth to the third centu¬
ries B.C., the steppelands between
the Don, the Volga and the Urals
were the home of a culture similar
to that of the Black Sea Scythians.
The bearers of this culture, whom the
Greeks called Sarmatians, were in
turn linked with the tribes of Eastern
Kazakhstan, whose own culture is
brilliantly represented by a series of
gold plaques depicting reclining deer,
found in the sixth-century Chilik-
tinsky kurgan.
These links stretched beyond the
steppes of Kazakhstan still further,
to the High Altai, whose frozen
burial mounds have yielded perfectly
preserved collections of objects made
of wood, bone, felt and metal, in
which Chinese, Iranian and Scythian
influences are clearly apparent.
The development of Scythian cul¬
ture in the lands north of the Black
Sea was certainly affected by the
trading colonies which the Greeks
had established on the coast at the
end of the seventh century B.C., but
the Greeks themselves had already
encountered Scythians whose culture
owed nothing to outside influences,
and the objects which their gold¬
smiths made specially for Scythian
customers can be easily distinguished
from purely Scythian artifacts. Ob¬
jects of both types are now familiar
to us, as a result of excavations.
antiquities took place at the Kul Oba
kurgan near Kerch, on the straits
connecting the Black Sea to the Sea
of Azov, in 1830. A stone vault
under the mound proved to contain
a rich burial of the fourth century
B.C. with an outstanding collection
of Greek-made jewellery. Some of
the pieces, including a gold torque
decorated with figures of Scythian
horsemen, had obviously been made
specially for Scythian customers.
Of particular interest is a spheri¬
cally-shaped vase made of electrum
a natural gold-silver alloy), the body
of which is decorated with four
groups of figures illustrating a Greek
legend of the founding of the Scy¬
thian dynasty, which Herodotus also
recorded.
The scenes on the vase (analysed
in detail in an article on pages 1 5 and
16) depict the efforts of the three
sons of Heracles (the Scythian Tar
gitaus) and a strange serpent-womarñr

combatants and the five
crouching lions beneath them

sides giving the illusion of being

shall lead the tribe, by being the
first to bend a bow left with their
mother by their father. Two of the
brothers fail the test, collecting in
the process nasty injuries typical of
clumsy bowmanship, but Scythes,
the youngest, succeeds.
Excavations of a great number of
kurgans in the coastal steppes around
the Black Sea, in the Crimea and in
the Northern Caucasus, during the
last half of the nineteenth century,
brought to light a number of magni¬
ficent examples of specifically Scy¬
thian art, and of Greek craftsman¬
ship commissioned by the Scythians.
Typical Scythian motifs s were the
reclining deer with branch-like antlers
and the panther, which possibly ser¬
ved as tribal symbols. These ani¬
mals decorate the solid gold plaques
on shields found in sixth-century
kurgans in the Kuban region; they
were also regularly depicted in the
decorations on quivers.
Links between the Scythians and
their western and southern neigh¬
bours are clearly reflected in the finds
from the kurgans. Scythian burials
in the Ukraine have yielded a number
of Thracian objects, an outstanding
example of which is the silver-trim
med bridle found in the Khomina
Mogila kurgan in 1970, whose de-'
corations include intricately engrav¬
ed plaques depicting animal heads.
The contents of the Chertomlyk
kurgan, excavated by I.E. Zabelin,
included a silver vaselater to become
famousdecorated in relief with
figures of Scythian horse-breeders,
and an iron sword whose gold hilt,
depicting two calves' heads and a
hunting scene, is a splendid example
of Iranian decoration of the fifth cen¬
tury B.C.
This sword, which was possibly a
trophy from the Greco-Persian or
Scytho-Persian wars, was in a gold
scabbard of Greek manufacture depic¬
ting a battle with the Persians, simi¬
lar in composition to the scenes of
the Battle of Marathon which
decorate Greek temples of the fifth
and fourth centuries B.C.
Iranian (Achaemenid) objects were
no rarity in Scythian burial mounds.
One of the several burial crypts of
the Great Bliznitsa kurgan on the
Taman peninsula, excavated between
1864 and 1868, contained two in¬
teresting objects of Near Eastern
origin : an Achaemenid seal-ring of
gold showing a king wrestling with
a lion; and an Egyptian amulet in
faience depicting the head of the
god Besa diminutive figure with
the face of a monster and a head¬
dress of feathers or palm-fronds.
This amulet could have arrived via
Iran, like the Egyptian alabaster ves¬
sel with hieroglyphic and cuneiform
inscriptions mentioning the name
of the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes
discovered in the southern Urals.
Scythian culture thus reflects the
relations with neighbouring and dis¬
tant lands which contributed to the
establishment of the link between
Eastern Europe and the Far East,
the wide east-west corridor which
was already open in the middle of
the last millennium of the pre-Chris¬
tian era and which, until the sixteenth
century A.D., would form the famous
Silk Route leading from the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean, through
Iran, Central Asia and Chinese Tur¬
kestan to the banks of the Hwang Ho
river. The world of the Scythians
fully deserves its place in ancient
history.
