for disclosure of events in the apartheid years. How successful has it been?

n his book Tomorrow is Another Country, South
African journalist Allister Sparks describes how
Nelson Mandela’s A f rican National Congr e s s
( A N C ) , and the apartheid gove rnment of South
A f rica were forced to recognize the need for a nego-
t i ated settlement. In a crucial meeting between the
ANC and the right-wing generals of the South A f ri-
can armed forces,Mandela declared:
“ ‘If you want to go to wa r , I must be honest
and admit that we cannot stand up to you on the
battlefield.We don’t have the resources. It will be a
long and bitter struggle, many people will die and
the country may be reduced to ashes.But you must
remember two things.You cannot win because of
our numbers : you cannot kill us all.And you cannot
win because of the international community.They
will rally to our support and they will stand with
us.’ General Viljoen was forced to agree.The two
men looked at each other . . . [and] faced the truth
of their mutual dependency.”
This declarat i o n , and its acceptance by eve ryo n e
at that meeting, i l l u s t r ates one of the major fa c t o rs that
led to the foundation of the Truth and Reconciliat i o n
Commission (TRC) in 1995 (see box ) .The basis of
a ny compromise is that contending parties display a
willingness to gi ve up irreconcilable goals, and then
enter into an agreement that yields substantial bene-
fits to all part i e s.The apartheid gove rnment of South
A f rica desired to continue to hold on to the reins of
p owe r , but was willing to allow for increased political
p a rt i c i p ation by blacks.The liberation move m e n t ,o n
the other hand, desired the complete removal of white
p owe r. Neither of these goals seemed achieva b l e
without an all-out wa r. It seemed in the best interest
of all to avoid such a situat i o n .
One of the demands of the beleaguered apar-
theid gove rnment was that in exchange for loss of
p ower there should be a blanket amnesty for all the
agents of apart h e i d ,p a rticularly the police and the
a rmed forces. But while such an outcome would be
b e n e ficial to whites, it would not enjoy the support of
those who were victims of apart h e i d .They wo u l d
rightly feel that the benefic i a ries and enforcers of
a p a rtheid were getting away too easily. The wo rs t
outcome of such a solution would be that black
South A f ri c a n s , victims of apart h e i d , would lose
c o n fidence in any of their leaders who could accept
such a solution.
The flaw in this equation is that it does not offer
a substantial benefit for both sides, and therefore
does not inspire unive rsal confid e n c e .W h at wa s
finally agreed upon was conditional amnesty.
F i rs t l y, the victims of apartheid should have the
o p p o rtunity to tell what happened to them, and for
their sufferings to be publicly acknow l e d g e d .
S e c o n d l y, the perp e t r at o rs of political crimes should
account for their deeds by making full and tru t h f u l
disclosure of their actions. L a s t l y, r e p a r at i o n s
should be made to the victims.
An important aspect of the amnesty process is the
s t i p u l ation that the life of the TRC be prescri b e d ,
on the grounds that a time frame would provide an
i n c e n t i ve for perp e t r at o rs wishing to come forwa r d
a n d , after making full disclosure, to be amnistied.
Failure to take advantage of the process within the
p r e s c ribed time would open perp e t r at o rs to prose-
cution in the ordinary courts of law.
The shame of public exposure
D u ring the hearings held by the T R C , h a rr o-
wing stories of suffering and cruelty were heard.
Did the process result in reconciliation?
One strong criticism of the amnesty process is
that it frustrates justice and the desire for punish-
ment.This does not take into account the fact that
m a ny of the recipients of amnesty experience a kind
of punishment they never anticipat e d : the shame
of being publicly exposed. The exposure of their
p a rt i c i p ation in despicable acts of cruelty has in
some cases resulted in broken families,disorienta-
tion and loss of self-esteem—a form of punishment
t h at can arguably be far more deva s t ating than that
exacted by an ordinary jail sentence. Equally, the
contrition leading to a plea for forgiveness,as part
of a quest for reacceptance in society, can be fa r
more restorative than the hoped-for rehabilitative
effects of an ordinary prison term.The cure in the
method of the TRC is located within social practice
rather than in the artificiality of punitive isolation.
This experience raises legitimate questions about
traditional methods of retributive justice.
It can be said that as a result of the T R C ,S o u t h
A f rica has become a more sensitive and a more com-
plex society. South A f ricans have been forced to
confront the complex contradictions of the human
c o n d i t i o n , and the need to devise adequate social
a rrangements to deal with them.The healing that
results will not be instant. It will come from the 

new tendency for South A f ricans to be willing to
n e g o t i ate their way through social, i n t e l l e c t u a l ,r e l i-
gi o u s , political and cultural dive rs i t y. In sum, it will
come from the progr e s s i ve accumulation of ethical
and moral insights.
C e rt a i n l y, some objectives have been achieve d .
No South A f ri c a n ,p a rticularly white South A f ri c a n s ,
can ever claim ignorance of how apartheid disru p t e d
and destroyed the lives of millions of black people in
the name of the white electorat e .All South A f ri c a n s
can now claim to have a common base of know l e d g e
about where they have come from, p a rticularly in
the last 50 ye a rs , and this is an essential foundat i o n
for the emergence of a new national value system.
Public acknowledgment of South A f ri c a ’s history of
racism represents a form of reconciliat i o n .
Moving towards social justice
The TRC has not by any means been a smooth
process. Many whites, particularly among Afrika-
ners, felt that the TRC was a punitive witch-hunt,
targeting them as a community.This criticism did
not take into account the fact that the TRC also
addressed gross human rights violations perpetra-
ted by the liberation movements themselves. The
even-handedness of the TRC in this regard is very
clear in its report,and could itself be regarded as a
significant contribution to reconciliation.
There are people who are not happy with the
amnesty mechanism and strongly feel that justice has
been compromised (see next page). Fo rt u n at e l y, a
n e g o t i ated transition ensured there were functioning
institutions in place for citizens to exercise their ri g h t s.
R e c o n c i l i ation is not a single eve n t . It is a process.
The TRC was a mechanism to deal with enorm o u s
human tensions which could have exploded with
d e va s t ating consequences.It enabled South A f ri c a n s
to nav i g ate successfully through ve ry rough seas.T h e
question is whether after its second democratic elec-
tions South A f rica has the will and resourcefulness to
take full advantage of the foundation it has inheri t e d .
Continuing disparities in we a l t h ,h o u s i n g,e d u c at i o n ,
and health between blacks and whites indicate that the
process of reconciliation must move to a second stage:
the achievement of social justice. In this regard, t h e
d e fin i t i ve test of a new democratic society is underway.
But the disintegr ation of the South A f rican stat e
through racial conflict is unlikely in the foreseeable
f u t u r e .This outcome is a highly significant measure of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of South AfricaÕs Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at the first hearings 
of the T RC in Cape Town on April 30, 1996. Some 2,400 victims testified before the Commission over a thre e - year period.
