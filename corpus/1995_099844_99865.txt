ENVIRONMENT-
FRIENDLY OMAN

t:
I he Omanis like to claim that
after Singapore theirs is the
cleanest country in the world.
It is certainly spotless. At the air¬
port, the grey marble floor shines
like a mirror. Not a scrap of waste
paper or speck of dust can be seen.
Parked outside are gleaming cars.
A determined effort to keep Oman
clean is backed up by radio and
TV messages and enforced by hefty
fines ($100 or thereabouts for a
dirty car or a cigarette butt thrown
from a window), while an army of
sweepers in orange uniforms work
night and day on the roads, picking
up any rubbish that might, in spite
of all the precautions, have fallen by
the wayside. Even out in the desert
rubbish bins white-painted for¬
mer oil jerrycans bearing the name
of the nearest town. are emptied at
regular intervals. The capital,
Muscat, stretches for kilometres
along the coast and is made up of
white houses built in the approved
Arab style, surrounded by trees
and flowers. Water tanks, aerials
and air-conditioners are hidden
from view by variants of the wooden
screens that are typical of the Arab
world.
Oman is about the size of the
Rritish Isles anil has a population
of almost 2 million. It has a very
wide spectrum of landscapes and
soils. Covering 300,000 square
kilometres on the southeastern
tip of the Arabian Peninsula, it is
bordered on the north and west
by the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia and on the south¬
west by Yemen. The coastline
stretches 1,700 kilometres from
the Strait of Hormuz, along the
Gulf of Oman to the Arabian sea.
The country's northern tip,
Musandam, is a rocky peninsula
indented by fjord-like coves.
There is a fertile coastal plain
(the Ratinah), a mountain range
(Jabal al-Akhdar) that rises to
3,000 metres, and vast stretches
of desert.
SLAKING THE SULTANATE'S
THIRST
Although heavy monsoon rains
fall on the Dhofar in the south
from June to September, the cli¬
mate in the hinterland is dry and
hot with annual rainfall no more
than 100 mm. However, down¬
pours may be so violent that the
rivers (ivadi). which are usually
dry, overflow their banks and
sweep everything before them.
Water is a major preoccupa¬
tion for the Omani government.
In March 1994, for example, the
Minister for Water Resources
sounded the alarm about steeply
rising consumption. The restric
tions are not felt in Muscat,
which is supplied by a sea-water
desalination plant, but between
May and August (when tempera¬
tures hit 43°C in the shade) agri¬
culture consumes 100 million
cubic metres per month, i.e. 94
per cent of total consumption.
According to the Minister, 80 per
cent of the rainwater is lost to
run-off into the sea, and 5 per
cent to evaporation. In 1985 a
recharge dam was built near
Muscat to collect rainwater des¬
cending from the mountains.
Five more have been built since
then, and some fifty more are
scheduled to be built in the next
few years.
To prevent groundwater
reserves from being exhausted,
irrigation wells cannot be drilled
without government permission.
The number of requests is alar¬
ming 9,090 in three years, 6,365
of which have been approved,
bringing the total number of wells
to 167,000. This is worrying
because reserves of fossil water,
so called because it dates from
ancient times when there was
more rain in the region, are not
being replenished in today's arid
climate. The less used the better,

although reserves are estimated
at 955 million m3 and research is
going on to determine whether
there is any groundwater at
deeper levels. Forty-nine field
teams tour the country to check
well registration, record well cha¬
racteristics and take samples of
the water to assess its quality.
The data are entered into a data¬
base from which statistics and
maps can be compiled. The wells
must not be too close to the sea
because of the risk of intrusion
by sea water. Date palms in the
Ratinah have a limited toleration
of brackish water and have been
dying off.
KING SOLOMON'S WELLS
Water management in Oman is
not a recent invention. A remar¬
kable system of irrigation chan¬
nels, known as Jalaj, was esta¬
blished about 2,500 years ago
and is still in perfect working
order today. Legend has it that
Solomon, King David's son,
came to Oman on a magic carpet
with his djinn spirits who
could assume human or animal
Wadi el-Khalil, in the
eastern Hajar
mountains between
Muscat and Sur.

("The Green
Mountain").
40
form and built 10,000 chan¬
nels in ten days. Water is tapped
at the water table in the moun¬
tains and flows to the plains
along man-made tunnels from
three to ten kilometres long.
Every 150 metres smaller wells
have been dug into the tunnel to
facilitate inspection. Where the
tunnel emerges from the rock
the watercourse divides into a
series of narrow channels, some
made of concrete. Ancient docu¬
ments explain the water distri¬
bution system. Some 200 land¬
owners have permanent right of
access to a water channel, and
many more enjoy temporary
rights. A flow of forty-five litres
per second irrigates forty hec¬
tares and serves about 1,000
people. A breach is made in the
earth walls that surround each
field, and closed when sufficient
water has flowed through. Then
the process is repeated for the
next field. The same irrigation
system is used in Iran, China
and, oddly enough, in the
Valais, the Swiss part of the
upper Rhône Valley.
The small black fish wrig¬
gling in the falaj act as garbage
collectors. Unfortunately, they
do not touch the larvae of the
anopheles, the mosquitos that
carry the parasite responsible
for malaria. In 1990 a pro¬
gramme to eradicate malaria
was launched in Ibra, 100 kilo¬
metres south of Muscat. At the
time there were 4,419 recorded
cases of falciparum, the most
virulent form of the disease.
Today there are a mere forty
cases. The task is enormous, for
it involves monitoring a zone
representing 12 per cent of the
country's area and inhabited by
250,000 people. The area was
divided up into 4-km2 districts,
each of which was sprayed daily
with Temefosum, an insecticide
that is non-toxic to humans and
the environment. The insecticide
is sprayed wherever the ano¬
pheles are likely to reproduce,
in wadis, watercourses, wells
and tanks. The results have
been spectacular.
THE RETURN OF
THE WHITE ORYX
The reintroduction of the white
oryx, sponsored by the World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
is another environmental success
story. Sultan Qaboos imported
from zoos in the United States
several couples of this long-
horned African antelope that
had been hunted to extinction,
and they have since prospered.
The sanctuary where they live
has recently been added to
UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Five species of turtle studied
by WWF and the World Conser¬
vation Union (IUCN) over the
past twelve years have not fared
so well. Wolves, foxes, gulls,
ravens, ghost crabs, carnivorous
fish, seabirds and local people
are all enamoured of their flesh
and eggs. Human consumption is

part of a tradition that has
existed for 7,000 years but it
must be vigorously resisted if
hawksbill and green turtles are
to be saved from extinction.
Another problem facing
Oman is that of coastal pollution.
IUCN representative Rodney
Salm spent seven years from 1984
to 1992 working on a coastal zone
management programme for the
Sultanate. His reports warn
against oil and tar pollution on
the beaches, partly due to illegal
discharge of oil by ships at sea,
the mining of sand for building,
encroaching new roads, rotting
fish refuse and the dumping of
waste. The migratory birds for
which Oman is justly famous may
no longer be able to alight on the
reed-bordered lagoons, for seven
of the seventeen sites are
seriously threatened. Corals,
some species of which are unique,
are being damaged by fishing
nets, anchors and litter such as
plastic bags and empty paint tins.
The Ministry of Regional
Municipalities and Environment
is taking the situation in hand. A
royal decree on the conservation
of the environment and the pre¬
vention of pollution was promul¬
gated in 1982. In 1993 the
ministry published a booklet
tracing twenty-three years of
action in response to these pro¬
blems. In answer to marine pol¬
lution by oil spillage, Oman is

planning to build a ballast-dum¬
ping centre for oil tankers. Sand
extraction and the dumping of
waste on beaches have been
halted, and access to the main
reproduction areas for turtles is
limited to 60 persons per day.
Building less than 150 metres
from the high tide mark is for¬
bidden, and housing construc¬
tion, like all building in the Sul¬
tanate, must be authorized by
the ministry.
Oman is a "life-size" environ¬
mental laboratory. Considering
the proven determination of the
authorities to take proper care
of the country, and the resources
they have mobilized to do so, it
will be very interesting to follow
the strategies they adopt and
measure the results they achieve
in the coming years. I
