Pregnancy related problems are a leading
cause of death among adolescents. Are most
of these unwanted pregnancies? 
You have to distinguish between preg-
nancies within and outside marri a g e . I n
c o u n t ries like Bangladesh, Nepal and some
p a rts of A f ri c a , the number of girls marri e d
by 15 or 16 is exceedingly high—up to 70 or,
80 per cent. In those situat i o n s , p r e g n a n cy
within marriage may be wanted but we know
t h at it is hazardous, in terms of its conse-
quences on health, e d u c ation and economic
o p p o rt u n i t y. Outside of marri a g e , the va s t
m a j o rity of pregnancies are unwa n t e d .T h e
“ s u g a r - d a d d y ” phenomenon is common,
while a more recent trend is the false belief
by some men that by sleeping with a virgi n ,
they will not get A I D S .
Does pregnancy generally mean an end to
education ?
Yes, or else girls often end up having
botched-up backstreet abortions because
they are afraid of being expelled.You could
argue that schools should be encouraged to
keep pregnant students but in reality, this
d o e s n ’t really wo r k . These women have
special needs. In countries as far afield as
Jamaica and Tanzania, we have set up spe-
cial  schools for pregnant mothers allow i n g
them to complete their educat i o n . O n c e
the child is born, they often continue into
vocational education as long as childcare
facilities exist.
What impact did the 1994 International
Conference on Population and Development
have? 
The United Nations Population Fund
took a leadership role by spearheading the
need to look at adolescents as a group whose
sexuality had to be recognised and whose
needs had to be met in terms of educat i o n ,
i n f o rm ation and serv i c e s. This has to be
done in a holistic way. The conference
made the world aware that this was not a
problem that you could just sweep under the
carpet. But at a country level, progress in
taking care of teenagers ’ needs has been
s l ow. NGOs are setting the example in most
c a s e s , notably with peer education projects
that are giving promising results.
To what extent has sex education improved,
particularly in developing countries? 
In some countries including my own (Sri
Lanka) sex education exists, but in reality
t e a c h e rs are not trained to handle these issues.
Sex education is not just about having sex, i t ’s
about relationships and making choices. G i r l s
need empowe rment to say “ n o ” to a rela-
tionship and this is difficult for them.T h i s
kind of sex education is still rare in schools
and often starts too lat e .P ri m a ry school is the
i m p o rtant starting point. But you also have to
look at what is happening outside the school,
because ve ry often girls drop out at the sec-
o n d a ry leve l , and there are some 125 million
children who never go to school at all.T h e
potential of distance learn i n g, media and
other communication forms has to be more
broadly harn e s s e d .
What do we know about the impact of sex
education programmes?
Study after study has pointed out that
sex education delays childbearing and does
not lead to promiscuity or to early sexual
experimention. It is usually the reverse: if
you are forearmed with that know l e d g e ,
you are more cautious. In eve ry walk of
l i f e , we train young people to cope, we gi ve
them skills and know l e d g e , but when it
comes to sex education, there seems to be
a myth that the less you tell them the better
off they are. It makes no sense. It is control
of power by an older generation.
How can access to contraception be improved,
notably in Africa?
There is a crying need for inform at i o n
on contraception.I n f o rm ation has to be made
available through a va riety of sources: i n
c l i n i c s , in pharm a c i e s , through peer gr o u p s ,
the media, e t c. S e rvices have to be made
more yo u t h - f riendly and accessible to all
young people regardless of their marital stat u s.
Young people themselves should play an active
role in defining how health services should be
ru n .The press can play a pivotal role: we are
running a particularly successful operat i o n
with the BBC World Service known as S e x w i s e.
It is a 12-part series on sex educat i o n , fa m i l y
life educat i o n , contraception and parenting.
In South A s i a , where it was first launched in
eight languages, we received some 75,000
q u e ries from listeners.After being extended in
1999 to Europe and Eurasia,the series will go
global in July 2000 and is expected to reach
over 60 million listeners in A f ri c a , the A r a b
wo r l d , L atin A m e ri c a , South East Asia and
China by the end of the ye a r.
In 1999, the U.S. introduced a rule that aims to
defund organizations outside the U.S. which
provide any abortion-related information and
assistance to women in need. Are you
concerned about this?
This rule is hurting wo m e n . It is
depriving funds for NGOs like ours. This
means we are unable to provide reproduc-
t i ve health serv i c e s , including contraception
and family planning to women who are in
need.This results in more unwanted preg-
nancies because services are not available
and women who could have gone to have
s e rvices ended up having botched-up abor-
tions. It is very shortsighted. ■
