H i p - h o p ’s art of rebellion can trigger a battle against racism or raise 
the white flag to hyper-consumerism 
From Bogota to Beijing, hip-hop’s apostles are
spreading “the word”, striking chords of rage
and rebellion in privileged and poor kids alike,
in rich countries and poor.The wo r l d , it seems, is in
love with black America. But this is a treacherous
affair. Back in the homeland,a war is being waged
against this very same group. One of the frontlines
is the pri s o n - i n d u s t rial complex—an expanding
f o rt r e s s , with the U. S . r ate of incarceration (682
per 100,000) six to ten times higher than that of
most industrialised nat i o n s. Of the two million pri s-
o n e rs , 49 per cent are black and 17 per cent are
Latino even though they respectively represent 13
and 11 per cent of the population.Almost one in
three black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are
caught in the web of correctional control (incar-
c e r at i o n ,p r o b ation or parole).These men lose their
right to vo t e , lose their place as citizens, both in the
eyes of the State and in white society.
Outside of the penitentiari e s ,u n e m p l oyment is a
p rison of its ow n .At seven per cent,the rate may seem
l ow, but look closer and you find that this does not
recognise the “ d i s p o s a b l e ” p a rt-time wo r k e rs , g e n-
erally composed of ethnic minorities and wo m e n .
About eight per cent of A f rican A m e ricans are offi-
cially unemploye d , but the real bombshell is reserve d
for black yo u t h : almost 32 per cent cannot find a job.
Hip-hop is the “CNN of Black America”,raps
Chuck D of Public Enemy. Read this line with a
metaphorical eye to catch a crucial but not com-
plete reflection of the world’s Janus-like attraction
to rap’s art of rebellion. On the one hand, C N N
o f f e rs constant news coverage wo r l d - w i d e . I n
symbolic term s ,we find rappers cast as report e rs on
the frontline, o f f e ring live updates through their
music of the trials,tribulations and peculiarities of
neighbourhoods and cities, from Lagos to Frank-
f u rt . On the other hand, global media netwo r k s ,
like CNN, just scratch the surface and cater to
mainstream political “ t a s t e s ” by offering easily
digestible nuggets of infotainment. I l l u s t r ating this
n e g at i ve side, we find a few posses of To k yo rap-
pers and fans, for example, literally burning their
skin in tanning salons.This is an extreme example
reflecting the international mantra:“Be black for a
d ay, wigger for an aftern o o n ! ” [Wigger refers to
white people who copy black fashions.]
Contradictory impulses
Much like jazz and rock ’n’ roll in the past, h i p -
hop has made working class U. S . youth in general
and A f rican A m e ricans in particular a cultural
h e a rth for the intern ational market. Its iconic
p ower takes many form s , depending upon the par-
ticular political goals and constraints of its practi-
t i o n e rs. For some, hip-hop is used to attack pove r-
t y, oppression and gove rnment corru p t i o n . O t h e r
fans and musicians take aim at cultural ort h o d ox y
by glorifying gang violence, hy p e r - m at e rialism and
explicit misogyny. Often these contradictory ele-
ments take shape simultaneously.
In the heart of advanced industrial countri e s ,h i p -
hop serves as a liberation anthem for those oppressed
by racism and pove rt y. In the disadvantaged subu r b s
of Pa ri s , the lilting sounds of Senegalese MC Solaar

2 Local scenes
Direct from the U.S. prison-industrial complex in New Jersey, Lifers Group find a captive audience.

NTM (Nique Ta Mère – “screw your mother”) besiege
the fascism of Je a n - M a rie Le Pe n ’s Front Nat i o n a l
p a rt y. Across the Channel, B ritish Asian rappers
Fun^Da^Mental enshrine the right to self-defence
against racist at t a c k s , while German hip-hoppers
incite respect for their Turkish ori gi n s.
Yet at the same time,hip-hop is also just one of
m a ny commercial products or props used for yo u t h
rebellion against the established orders of parents.
The music, dress and attitude are used to visibly
divide one generation from another. In Thailand,
male teens speed through the streets in swanky cars ,
pumped on the raw energy and anger of U.S. rap
without the slightest connection to the underlying
politics. In Kathmandu,teens use rap’s breakbeats
to break with tradition, perhaps temporari l y, i n
forging a “modern” identity.
As U. S . rapper L.L. Cool J rhy m e d ,“ t h e r e ’s no
c at e g o ry, for this story. It will rock in any terri t o ry.”
Cuba offers an “ a c a d e m i c ’s delight” in contradic-
t i o n s. Since 1996, the gove rnment has helped to
sponsor an annual National Hip-Hop Conference
s h owcasing local and intern ational stars , m o s t l y
from Latin A m e ri c a . According to the U. S . h i p - h o p
magazine The Source, Fidel Castro “sees rap music
as the existing revo l u t i o n a ry voice of Cuba’s future.”
Yet hip-hop also challenges the socialist vision when
fans at concerts proudly wear images of the U. S .
dollar bill on their hats and shirts and scream “ i t ’s
all about the Benjamins” ( r e f e rring to the image of
Benjamin Franklin printed on $100-bills).
Ironically, as post-Cold War hyper-material-
ism endangers the destiny of young people every-
w h e r e , the contradictory message of hip-hop
begins to make sense. A decisive feature of the
music/culture’s ethic is: to “want mine”, meaning
a share of society’s wealth.This desire operates at
both the individualist and collective levels. Do
you want “it” (luxury, security, etc.) for yourself,
or do you want a fair share for your community or
society? The urge is so complex that it’s difficult,
if not impossible, to find one without the other.
Take the case of South A f ri c a , whose tow n s h i p s
only recently produced some of the most disci-
plined and inspirational fighters for social justice.
N ow in “ m i xe d - r a c e ” areas around Cape Tow n ,
gangs take their cue from gangsta rap, calling them-
s e l ves “the A m e ri c a n s ” and “ t h r owing up the W ” , a
hand signal from West Coast gangsta rappers of the
U. S .The South A f rican example shows us that hip-
h o p ’s art of rebellion does not only lead to anti-
racist and anti-capitalist rebellion, but it often falls
victim to the pitfalls of systemic oppression against
which it attempts to rebel.
Hip-hop alone cannot rise up to the task of
political transformation—this is pop culture not a
manifesto. However, by looking at the particular
political situations and aspirations of its musi-
cians, we can trace its rise as an iconic power and
its demise when the assimilationist powers of the
capitalist economy flatten out the music’s rich-
ness to render it a message of personal gain. ■
