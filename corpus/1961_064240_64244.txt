GIFTS FROM
THE LAND OF
THE PHARAOHS
The art objects on this double page are a few
of the ancient Egyptian treasures which the
Government of the United Arab Republic is
offering as grants-in-return to countries which
contribute to the Nubian campaign. The objects
include statues, sarcophagi, alabaster jars and
vases, statuettes in faience, wood sculptures,
etc., from the Luxor, Karnak, G iza and Aswan
sites. Also offered are five Pharaonic temples.
Both the UAR and the Sudan have also offered
50 per cent of excavation finds in the area to
be flooded, and Egypt has generously modified
its antiquity laws for excavations elsewhere.
