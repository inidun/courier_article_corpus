Unesco Asks Five
Nations To Aid In
High Altitude
Research Work
THE process of acclimatization ofman living at sea level to the
atmospheric conditions of high
altitudes is still insufficiently known.
Continued research work is needed to
solve this problem-and is also impor-
tant for gaining a better comprehension
of the respiratory function of the blood.
Research dealing with the physiology
of men living on the high plateaux of
Peru, by scientists from the National
institute of Andean Biology, of San
Marcos University, Lima, Peru, was
recently recognized by the Joint Com-
mission on High Altitude Research
Stations, which urged that it should
be extended to other Latin American
countries.
Undertaken by Professor Carlos
Monge and other members of the
Peruvian institute, it showed the neces-
sity to establish norms in medical
practice-of blood counts, chest mea-
surements, etc.-for people living at
high altitudes. The Peruvian scientists
accumulated a large number of norms
which are necessary for medical prac-
tice on high plateaux.
In its resolution, the Joint Commis-
sion on High Altitude Research Stations
requested Unesco to draw the atten-
tion of medical and university autho-
rities in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico and Venezuela, where there
are people living at high elevations, to
the opportunity they have to co-operate
in this field. It also suggested that
these countries form a Joint Committee
to initiate and co-ordinate this type of
research in their territories.
Unesco has now officially informed
the governments of these five countries
of the suggestions.
