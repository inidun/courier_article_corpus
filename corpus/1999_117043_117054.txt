I t ’s just a matter of time before such an ad tanta-
lizes prospective parents of the United Stat e s ,s ays Dr.
Jeffrey Botkin, a bioethicist and pediat ric geneticist.
A m e ricans have a heart-felt fetish for doing eve ry t h i n g
possible to help their children succeed. So why not
gi ve them the ultimate headstart by selecting the “ b e s t ”
from a batch of fertilized eggs or by one day geneti-
cally enhancing a child-to-be?
Welcome to the world of laissez faire eugenics,
s ays A rthur Caplan, one of the most influential A m e-
rican bioethicists.“This simply means that people are
free to choose how they want to design their children,
with the constraints that they don’t kill,h a rm or make
them wo rse off,” s ays Caplan, of the Unive rsity of
Pe n n s y l va n i a .“If yo u ’re not taking any [health] ri s k s ,



2 .The dangers of laissez faire

then it’s hard to criticize the goal of trying to biolo-
gically make your child better.”
Not so for the philosopher who first coined the
t e rm laissez faire eugenics, Philip Kitcher of Colum-
bia Unive rs i t y.“ We ’re putting the rat race into the
wo m b ,”he say s.“I used to be more optimistic,” t h i n-
king that education and support for the disabled wo u l d
lead to a genetic utopia free of discri m i n at i o n .“ B u t
n ow I see the root of the problem goes deep into capi-
talist society with the pressure to compete,”s ays Kit-
c h e r. “ Parents with the resources will feel pressured
to make sure that their children have ‘the right gene-
tic stuff.’ ”
Picking and choosing
‘ d e s i rable’ tra i t s
As geneticists develop new DNA tests and tech-
niques to screen and perhaps one day enhance
e m b ryo s ,“parents will be torn between the desire to
do the best they can for their child and their percep-
tion of the prejudices and inequalities surr o u n d i n g
t h e m ,”s ays Kitcher.I m a gine a couple sorting through
a batch of in-vitro fertilized eggs. Perhaps scientists
will find that there are certain genes which corr e l at e
with same sex preference.“Then we can expect some
parents to say, ‘ we ’re not prejudiced bu t i t ’s aw f u l l y
hard for a lesbian daughter to make it in our society.
. . .”Genetic testing, s ays Kitcher,will be used to we e d
out “ u n d e s i r a b l e s ” the way amniocentesis is now used
in China and India for sex-selection.This laissez fa i r e
eugenics will creep up on society as people increa-
singly look to genetics to relieve—not resolve — p r o-
blems caused by social situat i o n s. Skin colour could
be considered a social handicap,in which case an A f r o -
A m e rican couple might seek to produce a white baby.
While doctors might refuse the request, it begs the
question as to whether or not the gove rnment has a
role in regulating the selection and,p e r h a p s , one day,
the enhancement of embryo s.
Legal regulation “is not likely to happen and I’m
not sure that it should,” s ays Caplan. In the United
S t at e s ,“ p e rsonal choice is believed to be the best ans-
wer to questions of conception and reproduction,”h e
s ay s , explaining that this commitment to pri va cy has
kept abortion legal. If gove rnment began regulat i n g
the conditions in which children are born ,a n t i - a b o r-
tion groups might find a way of curtailing wo m e n ’s
rights to control their fert i l i t y. B e s i d e s ,s ays Caplan,
h ow can gove rnment begin limiting what parents bio-
l o gically offer their children when they have virt u a l-
ly free rein in environmental mat t e rs such as reli-
gion and education? Caplan also points out that
genetically enhancing an embryo will not be the same
as “ p r o gr a m m i n g ” a child. A strict religious upbri n-
ging may mould a child far more than enhanced at h-
letic ability, for example. B e s i d e s , is there any t h i n g
wrong with giving a child improved memory? 
The problem,s ays Kitcher, lies in the cumulat i ve
effects of individuals’d e c i s i o n s.A more homogeneous
society will emerge as parents select some traits ove r
o t h e rs.This wo n ’t lead to a Hollywoodesque scena-
rio of a nation dominated by chubby blond cheru b s
with blue eye s. I n s t e a d , Kitcher wa rns that the focus
on picking and choosing “ d e s i r a b l e ” traits may reduce
respect for dive rs i t y, reinforce racism and widen the gap
b e t ween those who can and those who cannot afford the
l atest genetic serv i c e s.
Ethically this would be wrong,s ays Caplan,but “ t h e r e
is no escaping it.” R e s t ricting individual liberty for the
common good is not the “ A m e rican way ” .“ We rely on
the wisdom of individual choice to get to the gr e ater bene-
fit—not some notion of an agreed upon collective bene-
fit ,” s ays Caplan.
Yet there may be some legi s l at i ve room for manoeuvre,
s ays Lori A n d r e w s , director of the Institute of Science,
L aw and Technology in Chicago.Constitutional protec-
tions prevent the gove rnment from interfering in a cou-
p l e ’s decision to have or not have a baby, s ays A n d r e w s.
This does not guarantee absolute freedom in deciding
w h at kind of child to have or under what conditions.
A major stumbling block to regulation lies in the ragi n g
c o n flict between anti-abortion groups and the scientific
community over embryo research.Extreme positions on
both sides have led to a “ l e gi s l at i ve va c u u m ” ,s ays A n d r e w s ,
l e aving the pri vate sector to pursue the research beyo n d
the scru t i ny of federal review boards.As it stands now,t h e
Food and Drug A d m i n i s t r ation (FDA) is supposed to
decide which genetic tests and treatments are available to
c o n s u m e rs.The problem,s ays A n d r e w s , is that FDA deci-
sions are based on safety and effic a cy—ethical conside-
r ations and public debate are not part of the equat i o n .
M a r keting campaigns
The legi s l at i ve vacuum leaves a lot of responsibility
on the doorstep of the medical community. E n o rm o u s
p r o fits stand to be made in the emerging field of repro-
d u c t i ve genetic serv i c e s.Marketing campaigns will focus
on the “perfect baby” to convince parents that their chil-
dren-to-be require “the best money can offer” in prena-
tal diagnoses and enhancement.With these commercial
p r e s s u r e s , parents will need medical and ethical guidan-
ce to eva l u ate the products.
Yet “the medical profession has gotten little beyo n d
identifying the problems,” s ays Dr. Botkin of the Uni-
ve rsity of Utah.D o c t o rs are trying to adopt a “ n o n - d i r e c-
t i ve ”approach when revealing the results of prenatal tests.
But as Botkin points out, r e p r o d u c t i ve decision-making
b e gins with the choice of tests taken. Professional stan-
dards traditionally reflect the minimum a doctor should
do in particular circumstances.As genetics deve l o p s ,d o c-
t o rs will need to consider the maximum.Yet they alone
cannot set the limits which, Botkin say s , require a broad
social dialogue.
The need for public debate is perhaps the one point
on which eve ryone agr e e s.While bioethicists like Caplan
focus on “good parenting”, Kitcher goes a step furt h e r.
“When we begin talking about how to groom human
beings from the womb on, something has gone aw f u l l y
wrong in our society,”he say s.“ Pa rt of the solution lies in
l e gi s l ation but part lies in modifying the culture of the
a f fluent society.We are living in a time of the self-profes-
sed triumph of capitalism.As a philosopher, I am incli-
ned to ask: is this competition good for us and our chil-
d r e n ? ” n
