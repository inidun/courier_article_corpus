Among the noted speakers who
addressed the plenary sessions
were George V. Allen, U. S. Assis-
tant Secretary of State for Pub-
lic Affairs, William G. Carr of
the U. S. National Education As-
sociation, George V. Stoddard,
President of the University of
Illinois, Vera Micheles Dean if
the Foreign Policy Association
and Margaret Mead, anthropolo-
gist of the American Museums-'f
Natural History.
"What Unesco needs, if it is to
accomplish anything, is co-opera-
tion of organizations and colleges
and schools and local groups and
individuals all over the world,"
Mr Allen said at the opening. ses-
sion of the Conference."We have
charted a course of international
co-operation,"he continued."The
pursuit of that course is fraught
with difficulties... The faith
in which Unesco was created is
the faith which animates us to-
day. The Governement of the
United States reaffirms that this
country will continue to work
with all other countries which
share this faith to achieve the
objectiVe5 set forth in the consti-
tution of Unesco."
"William Carr told the 3, 000 dele-
gates that the task before them was
to overcome the sense of futility.
the sense of benumbed resignation
with which all too many of our
people look upon the current in-
ternational scene... The task
is to call the American people to
wage the peace. We must get
down to such practical questions
as educational reconstruction, stu-
dent and teacher exchange, revi-
sion of textbooks, co-operative
scientific investigations, interna-
tional systems of library refer-
ences, international use of ra-
dio..."
Addressing the final plenary
session on May 15 ; Dr. Stoddard
declared that"the unique, per-I
manent and exciting business of
Unesco is to contribute to a just
peace-to a world-wide, self-im-
posed security resting on cultural
Understanding and exchange."
"It seems to m2,"he said,
"that Unesco must choose and
choose fast whether to stay in
quiet waters far from danger or
significance or to consider itself i
a militant organized force for
peace."
