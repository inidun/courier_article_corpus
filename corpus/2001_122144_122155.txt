D a t a - s w i n d l e rs: gold mining
Trading personal data on Internet users is a booming business that is
also spurring laws to protect e-consumers
T
wo hundred dollars just for answering a
q u e s t i o n n a i r e. The offer from an A m e-
rican group called Greenfield Consulting
recently landed in the electronic mailbox
of a member of Fr a n c e ’s Information Te c h-
nology and Freedom Commission (CN I L) .The attrac-
tive proposal reflects the high premium that com-
panies put on gathering data about Internet users.
Every year in late January, a huge file fair, the
“customer relations” e x h i b i t i o n , takes place in
Paris. At this year’s event, entirely devoted to e-
commerce and the Internet, I - B a s e, a start-up
founded in 1999,offered its file of 15 to 35 year- o l d s,
“a behavioural database of over 700,000 young
p e o p l e.”Where do the names and data come from?
The company refuses to answer the question.A n o-
ther firm taking part in the event, C o n s o d a t a , i s
one of Fr a n c e ’s two megabase companies. E a c h
y e a r, Consodata and its counterpart, C l a r i t a s, s e n d
a form to millions of mailboxes with questions
about outstanding loans,reading habits,h o b b i e s, e t c.
Every bit counts:with time, these information snip-
pets turn into refined consumer profiles that are
worth gold.
In the age of e-commerce and personalized
s e r v i c e s, these companies are increasingly inter-
ested in Internet users.To find out their every whim,
Consodata has set up a special subsidiary called
C a b e s t a n , w h i c h
offers online games
as bait to subscribers
of Spray, an access
p r o v i d e r. P e r s o n a l
information left
behind while answe-
ring a quiz thus
became a gold mine
for Cabestan, which
will put the data on
the market soon.
These practices
are already very far
advanced in the
United States, t h e
cradle of the Net
economy and of
“data mining.” S e r g e
G a u t h r o n e t , a
consultant speciali-
zing in these issues, went there to visit “e-mail mar-
k e t e r s ” with “a mind-boggling artillery.” Fi r s t ,t h e y
send forms to the most popular sites, asking visitors
to answer questions about their profession, l e i s u r e
a c t i v i t i e s, children and so on. Wh a t ’s more, t h e
Internet users are “ t r a c k e d ” while making pur-
chases and surfing the Net. This enables online
marketing firms to send them increasingly specific
offers.These companies boast about being able to
send up to 100 million emails a day! Since there are
about 200 of them worldwide, their total strike
force may be as high as 20 billion emails a day,
says Gauthronet,or “about sixty emails per elec-
tronic mailbox every 24 hours!”
When the cookies
crumble
Gauthronet has just submitted a detailed report
about these practices to the European Commis-
s i o n . His first conclusion is that data-gathering
methods seem more transparent now than they did
a few years ago,when the overwhelming majority of
companies collected information without Internet
users knowing it. Their most widespread methods
consisted of using “ c o o k i e s ” (software installed on
hard drives to record users’ comings and goings on
the Net), or directing their questions to children,
who are more forthcoming. N o w a d a y s, i n f o r m a-
tion is increasingly gathered with the express
consent of the consumer (known as the “opt-in”
p r i n c i p l e ) , who can pull out of the game at any
time.Another advance is “permission marketing”:
e-marketers are starting to ask users for their

consent before bombarding them with advertising
emails.
So, where’s the threat? First,says Gauthronet,
some companies don’t always have a very scrupu-
lous vision of opt-in.“ For example,” he explains,“ a n
Internet user just has to bookmark a site to be
considered giving consent for everything and any-
t h i n g.” In another abuse, sensitive information
sometimes finds its way into a routine and autho-
rized data-gathering procedure without the Internet
user knowing it. Beyond that, Gauthronet raises
issues of freedom and “the dispossession of the
s e l f”that databases are going to bring about.“ Wh e n
your identity is frozen,” he says,“ y o u ’re stripped of
the right and means to define yourself the way you
want to.” And of course, he mentions the steady
erosion of the consumer’s privacy.
Vacancies
in the safe harbor
On October 25, 1 9 9 5 , the European Union
unanimously adopted a directive that gives all its
citizens the right to access databases, the right of rec-
tification,and the right to refuse the sale of data to
a third party.The measure also stipulates that no fil e
may leave Europe for a third country unless the
latter can guarantee an “ a d e q u a t e ” level of personal
data protection.This means that American Express
and Microsoft, for example, cannot repatriate
employee and client files to the United States unless
they sign a contract agreeing to respect certain
rules.
H o w e v e r, even a united Europe is having a hard
time making its views heard, especially in the United
S t a t e s. Shortly before the directive entered into
force on October 25, 1 9 9 8 , Washington was still
defending the principle of “ s e l f - r e g u l a t i o n .” Th e
deadlock between the U. S. Federal Trade Com-
mission and the European Commission dragged
on for two years. E v e n t u a l l y, in July 2000,both par-
ties signed the “safe harbor”accord,which quietly
entered into force on November 1.According to the
a g r e e m e n t , to keep trans-Atlantic data flo w i n g,
companies must agree to observe the European
directive’s basic principles and to accept sanctions
if they don’t .The United States, Hungary and Swit-
zerland have received the EU’s “clean country”
label.
H o w e v e r, the measure is not to American com-
panies’ liking. So far, just seven businesses have
joined safe harbor! French legal expert Etienne
Drouard,who is following the issue for the CNIL,
doubts it will be successful:American companies
“consider the agreement as a relinquishing of
national sovereignty!” he says.But the whole issue
may crop up again this year, because Washington is
showing signs of taking a harder line on privacy.
After the Amazon and DoubleClick scandals (see
box) among others, privacy has become a hot poli-
tical issue. The new congressional members had
barely taken their seats when several of them put
forward bills on the matter.A p p a r e n t l y, f r e e - m a r k e t
America is coming up against its citizens’ increa-
singly fierce resistance. ■
