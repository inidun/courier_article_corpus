Na d i a , a fif t e e n - year-old A l g e rian gi r l ,
came to Rheims in the middle of the
1997/98 school ye a r. It was impossible
to admit her to the final stage of secondary
s c h o o l , especially since she barely spoke
F r e n c h .When she was sent to the Robert
Schumann School to take a Vo c ational Inser-
tion Cours e , or “ C i p p a ” (Cycle d’Insert i o n
Professionnelle par A l t e rn a n c e ) , she expec-
ted the wo rs t . Little did she imagine that she
would soon be working in radio, films and
p u b l i s h i n g, as well as teaching Arabic to her
c l a s s m ates and teachers.
“It all started fourteen ye a rs ago,”
explains Jean-Luc Muracciole, a literat u r e
teacher who is responsible for the Rheims
C i p p a , “when the Education Ministry crea-
ted a scheme to enroll school dropouts in a
sandwich cours e , where they’d work two
weeks for a firm and spend two weeks in a
booster class to prepare them for readmis-
sion to the normal educational progr a m-
m e .” Muracciole has taught in prisons so he
has personal experience of problem situa-
t i o n s — but even so, he took on the task with
considerable trepidat i o n . It would be no
easy task, he thought, to teach these yo u n g
people a trade with a minimum of dignity
attached to it.
Instead of trying to adapt the students
to the school system, Muracciole tried to
adapt the system to the students. He broke
d own the barri e rs between the major sub-
ject areas, using sound and pictures to esta-
blish an audiovisual link between phy s i c s
and languages. Instead of conjugating ve r b s ,
the students are taught to communicat e
with the outside wo r l d , where they learn
h ow to make films about subjects discussed
in the classroom, taking turns as camera-
m e n , a c t o rs , set designers , d i r e c t o rs and
press agents. P h i l o s o p hy, which is taught in
the final ye a rs of secondary school, is used
as a bridge between maths and French.T h e
students read the works of modern authors
and then meet them personally in radio
i n t e rv i e w s , to gi ve them a taste of journ a-
lism and production.
The courses are gi ven à la cart e : s o m e
are taught to the entire class, while others
are gi ven individually or to small gr o u p s.
Three teachers cover the basic subjects.
Director Ludwig Tr ovato teaches video and
gi ves lessons in Romani, the language of

is also helpful in preparing the students for
F r a n c e ’s school-leaving diploma, the bacca-
l a u r e at : “It enables the students to take part
in unive rsity or professional life, and it helps
u s , the teachers , to eva l u ate our methodolo-
gy by comparison with the traditional sys-
t e m . One year we had a 100 per cent success
r at e .”
Adapting the system 
to the students
C u rr e n t l y, a nyone at least sixteen ye a rs old
who has failed to complete his or her secon-
d a ry education (and this includes vo l u n t a ry
dropouts) can register with Cippa and
continue studying.The only snag: the maxi-
mum quota of 24 places is being ove r - fil l e d
with more than 50 students per ye a r , a n d
there is a long waiting list which could soon
easily reach 500. Muracciole wants to go
f u rther and create an experimental school—
and he is doing his best to persuade the
a u t h o rities to provide the funds.
Romain, who recently entered the
s c h o o l ,d e s c ribes how he threw in the towe l
just before the end of the final year of secon-
d a ry school: “I couldn’t take it any more, i t
was such a rat race. My friend Stéphane
told me how gr e at Cippa wa s , so I decided
to regi s t e r. After the first we e k , I felt com-
pletely at home. Here we ’re taught by the
older pupils as well by the teachers. I t ’s like
one big fa m i l y.When classes are over we go
on talking things over . . . in the street or in
a café. People talk about eve rything under
the sun.” Stéphane entered Cippa in lat e
M ay of 1997, after dropping out of high
school and, l at e r , the Compagnons de
France crafts school. So far he has taken
p a rt in filming the first two of a series of
t h i rt y - five videos commissioned by the
French Museums Serv i c e , and he love d
e ve ry moment of it. “ I t ’s fantastic to com-
m u n i c ate impressions, textures and light
with a camera!”, he say s. He is the camer-
man on a film sponsored by the city of
D o l e , in eastern France. It is a modern ve r-
sion of Romeo and Juliet with a French
Romeo and a North A f rican Juliet.

Social Sciences, and came to Cippa three
ye a rs ago. Since then she has tried her hand
at all kinds of things: book publishing (the
house publishing firm , “La Te rra Tr e m a ” ,
already has six books to its credit); an exhi-
bition on Italian writer and film-maker Pier
Paolo Pa s o l i n i ; and the editing of a feat u r e -
length film entitled L’ o ralité en question,
which a team of her classmates shot in
M a rr a k e s h .
Oral communicat i o n —o ra l i t é—is one of
the main ve c t o rs in the transfer of know l e d-
g e , as Jean-Luc Muracciole is fully awa r e :
“ For young second and third generat i o n
N o rth A f ri c a n s ,” he say s , “Arabic is the lan-
guage for expressing feelings, while French is
the language of authori t y, order and obliga-
t o ry integr at i o n . French has a harsh image,
and by increasing the proportion of oral
c o m m u n i c ation in the classroom, we help
them bring the two cultures closer together.”
The students are responsive to the idea.
After Marr a k e s h , one film crew has gone on
to shoot a movie with the Gypsies of
R o m a n i a , another is in Corsica—an expe-
rience which has awakened an interest in
r e gional languages. “I discovered Cors i c a n
at a concert gi ven by the ‘I Muvri n i ’ gr o u p,”
s ays Fred, with all the authority of his twe n-
ty ye a rs. He feels he has learned enough at
Cippa to enter unive rsity to take a liberal
a rts course or enroll in a film school. He is
already at wo r k , outside Cippa, on a radio
p r o j e c t . He knows about radio from his
hour-long programme eve ry Sat u r d ay night

New pro j e c t s
This year the students are leaving the radio
studio for one of the best cafés in Rheims,
the Brasserie Bleue, to hold philosophical
d e b ates attended by several hundred people
from all walks of life. In autumn they will
launch the first issue of a quarterly magazi-
n e , Salle d’Attente ( “ Waiting Room”), a s
well as start working on a CD-RO M .
This educational experiment—the only
one of its kind in France—has already pro-
ved its wo rt h . According to a report by the
Rheims education authori t y, 99 per cent of
the school’s gr a d u ates have found their
place in society.The course could be used as
a model in other areas, where the school
dropout rate is even more alarm i n g . Je a n -
Luc Muracciole believes that , in countri e s
with a strong oral tradition, the method
would be even more successful than in
France: “We’ve seen proof of this in
Morocco and Romania. Cippa hopes to
‘ t w i n ’ with schools in other countri e s , s o
t h at we can introduce their teachers to some
of our methods.” ■
