GREENWATCH
MONTSENY:
HARMONY IN
THE HILLS
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
Ä Biosphere Reserve in the Catalonian
massif not far from Barcelona
Right, a typical
wooded valley in
the Montseny
Biosphere Reserve,
which extends over
more than 30,000
hectares.
M
ontseny National Park is
wrapped like a scarf round
a mountain massif. But the
scarf is not all cut from the same
cloth. To the south, it is perpetu¬
ally green, woven from evergreen
oaks, pines, arbutus, broom and
heather. To the north, the trees are
deciduous beech and chestnut. On
this winter Friday, only a few pine
trees and giant holly bushes add a
touch ofgreenery to the grey trunks.
The road is deserted, even though
the Barcelona conurbation with its
4.5 million inhabitants is only 50
km away. What is more, access to
Montseny is easy: a motorway, two
railway lines and buses. The public
throng here, especially on Satur¬
days and Sundays in the spring and
autumn. In summer, they prefer
the sea.
FREE ENTRY
However the visitor chooses to get
to the Park, there is no barrier at the
entrance. At weekends, three young
people in green uniforms occupy a
roadside cabin from which they
signal to cars to slow down and
hand the passengers a brochure
containing a plan of the Park and
information about how it functions.
The reader learns that farming and
¿m
IP ftc¡3l
timber are the main source of
income for most of the inhabitants
ofMontseny; that the land is in both
private and public ownership; that
forestry is governed by the law of
Catalonia and the rules laid down by
the park authorities; that hunting
is regulated; that the Park is an ideal
centre for all kinds of sports and
also provides an opportunity to
admire the natural and cultural her¬
itage; that everyone must help to
protect it for future generations;
and that camping is permitted only
at certain designated sites. There
follows a list of six prohibitions:
lighting fires, riding motorcycles off
the marked tracks, disposing of
refuse anywhere except in the many
dustbins provided for this purpose,
gathering mushrooms with a rake,
picking up chestnuts without per¬
mission from the owners of the
land, and cutting branches ofholly,
which is a protected plant.
From the 1,712-metre-high
summit of the Turo de l'Home, the
Mediterranean can be seen through
a gap in the coastal mountain range.
The Pyrenees lie to the north. A few
lighter points stand out in the forest
as it stretches down into the valley:
Romanesque churches built ofpink
sandstone, farms, inns, restaurants
and the buildings directly associ
ated with the Park's activities: the
house ofpopular culture, the school
of nature, a research station, infor¬
mation offices and interpreting cen¬
tres. Between the meteorological
observatory and the military post
with its two huge circular antennas,
a parapente school launches a few
foolhardy adepts out into the void.
Further down is a hang gliding base.
With all these colourful activities,
it is hard to imagine that you are in
a biosphere reserve-the very term
evokes a certain austerity (see box
page 41). Be that as it may, the Park
complies with Unesco standards.
Its eleven central zones, where tree
felling and hunting are prohibited,
are surrounded by a vast protected
area which itself forms part ofwhat
is known here as the "zone of influ¬
ence" or transition zone.
VISITORS AND LOCALS
Is it hard to ensure that the Park is
protected? Because of its proximity
to Barcelona, it was visited by
1,616,800 people in 1993. Since
there are no barriers, how was this
figure calculated? The answer is that
a vehicle counting system was
installed and it was estimated that
each car carried an average of three
passengers. The Park's director,

Eduard Botey Puig, an agricultural
engineer who also has a diploma in
geography, denies that the visitors
cause any problems. "The asphalted
roads are open to everyone. The
earth tracks are closed off by a
chain. Once they have parked their
cars in a parking area, visitors walk
around for a few minutes and then
return to their vehicles or go for
lunch. Bicycles on the other hand
can be ridden anywhere. But the
destructive invasion of mountain
bikes does not seem to have
reached this region yet."
What about the 850 permanent
inhabitants? How do they view the
tourists? "They benefit from them,"
Eduard says. "The restaurants are
full at the weekend and served
1,300,000 meals last year! We are
working with the local people to
develop pottery making and wood
carving and the sale of local prod¬
ucts such as pork sausages, cheese,
chestnuts, mushrooms, honey and
firewood. We also intend to orga¬
nize a Sunday market in the Park.
The old people stay in the village
with their grandchildren. They still
till the land and raise a few cattle,
but the wooded area is encroaching
on the fields. Young people go to
the city, but come back to look after
their woods. One family still works
a marble quarry that existed before
the Park was created. Life here is
not easy, but some people won't
accept change: they don't want elec¬
tricity or telephones and they don't
have cars. Park rangers on skis
deliver bread when the snow falls".
We come across a big white
cross-country vehicle sprouting
radio aerials. A girl in a brown uni¬
form sporting the insignia of the
forest rangers jumps down. Dolores
Rodriguez, aged twenty-five, is the
first and onlywoman to do this job.
She holds a diploma from a forestry
school and completed her one-year
training course before joining the
eleven other rangers in the reserve.
Twelve people to look after nearly
30,000 hectares! They have no
weapons and the only sanction they
can take is to note down the names
of persons who commit offences
and report them to the police. Edu¬
cation and prevention are the key
words. Apart from the rangers,
twenty-six other officials work in
the Park, plus another sixty who are
under contract to the local
authority. Exploring the north face
of the massif with Luis, a young
ranger who is a passionate nature-
lover, we come across a big pad¬
locked chain which bars off the
asphalted road. He sounds his horn
and an old man, his face wreathed
in smiles, runs up holding a wooden
box and a book of tickets: "240
pesetas," (around $2) he says.
THE LANDOWNERS ARE UNHAPPY
This toll charge, unusual in a bios¬
phere reserve, is highly revealing.
We learn from Ignasi Castello, head
of the Catalonian parks service, that
90 per cent of Montseny is in the
hands ofprivate owners! The prob¬
lems that Eduard did not mention
certainly exist. As far back as 1922,
attempts were made to protect
Montseny but they did not succeed
until 1977. In the following year, the
park became a biosphere reserve.
In 1994, round table meetings open
to the general public were held for a
month to review the status of the
Park and adapt it to the region's new
socio-economic situation.
Ignasi Castello does not deny
that the creation of the Park brought
land speculation to an end. Building
land is highly sought-after for
second homes in this "outer

suburb" of Barcelona but, at the
stroke of a pen, the area ceased to be
building land and is now only worth
the price of agricultural or forest
land. But lawsuits are proliferating.
One example is that of a private
individual who bought a plot of land
crossed by a public footpath. He
wanted to close the path, but after
an enquiry the courts ruled in
favour of the Park. As Ignasi Castello
points out: "The aristocrats of the
mountain who ruled the roost in
the past find it hard to adjust to the
new situation. They are trying to set
up a pressure group within the Park
administration."
The Montsenybiosphere reserve
also has to fight on another front.
Hard-line environmentalists would
like to turn it into a sanctuary and
put it under wraps. Jacques Ducros,
of the Cévennes biosphere reserve
in France, which is twinned with
the Montseny reserve, said in 1988:
"What is the primary function of a
biosphere reserve? The harmonious
coexistence ofman and nature must
be our primary aim	 A biosphere
reserve must be created on inhab¬
ited lands where non-destructive
activities are pursued and where
the population is willing to accept,
for its own well-being, a few ele¬
mentary rules of management
which help to preserve the envi¬
ronment, to protect the existing her¬
itage, promote education and fur¬
ther knowledge."
