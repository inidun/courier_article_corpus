TilE development. of social
H sciences during the last
fins years holds as rich
a promise'f, it' mankind today as
did natural sciences at the
beginning of the last century.
Man is alarmed by the bitter-
ness and anguish, which go with
the transition from one form of
civilization to another and
demands to know if science can
help him to understand the
laws which govern the complex
relationships between and
within different societies and
thus to control the great
changes of our epoch.
The role of the social sciences
within Unesco has been con-
ceived to answer the specific
aims upheld hy the Organiz-
ation. All activities must be
t-pccificaUy directed to serve
the cause of peace within the
international framework. To
serve these two conditions has
been the aim of the Department
of Social Sciences.
It is now time to draw prat-
ical conclusions from research
carried out over three years
with the collaboration of scient-
ific organizations and eminent
special1sls. The sum total of
this knowledge offers a rational
basis for the recommenda-
tions that L'nesco proposes to
place before governments and
non-governmental organizations
anxious to preserve peace.
Tile programme, to be sub-
mitted to Unesco's Executive
Board this month, marks a
definite step forward. It is
proposed that L'nesco inves-
tigate the scientific methods
and techniques which offer the
best means for overcoming cer-
lain existing tensions.
Hundreds of governmental
or private agencies in many
countries are striving to abate
racial prejudices and to fight
the discriminatory measures
which result from them. So-
ciologists and psychotogists, for
their part, suggest new ways
by which the energies at pre-
sent wasted in fruitless fighting
can be directed to constructive
ends. Groups and individuals
continue their efforts in diffe-
rent dircctions without refe-
rence to the experiences of
their neighbours. To mal, e
these methods more widely
known, to assess their efu-
ciency and encourage the use
of those which pruve the best,
is one of the ta"k"which fal1s
to Unesco.
Social tensions are fed by
wrong ideas based on irralion√†l
beliefs or outmoded scientific
interpretations. The authority
that its international character
gives Unesco, enables it to
undertake a campaign to put
within the reach of the masses
the resu1ts achieved bv scient.-
ists in their studv of racial
problems and the effect of
the discriminatory measures
against minorities.
Unesco played an important
part in the drafting of the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human
Rights. It is, therefore, mo-
ra) ty responsible to uphold and
disseminate these rights which
it. helped to formulate. Unesco
must fight racism and all forms
of social discrimination, in
confurmity with the spirit and
lelter of its Constitution.
Unesco is making an impor-
tant contribution to the United
Nations broad programme of
technical assistance to help
economically under--developed
countries to enjoy the benefits
of science and industry. \gain
it becomes the responsibility of
t. he social sciences to bear in
mind the human factor in the
transition from one type of
economv to another. MaterIal
developments must harmonise
with the cultural and social
chart's which wi1l inevitably
result. Unesco will play a
useful role if it helps prevent
a too sudden dislocation of
cultures, with its aftermath of
suffering and squandering of
energy and goodwi)).
H can be foreseen that, in
a fevr years, new states will
he added to the already large
family of existing ones. These
states will have to prepare,
with as little delay as possible,
a complex syslem of institu-
tions, without whicll they
cannot survive in the modern
world. The adoption of enti-
rety new organizations and
procedures will provoke inter-
nal anguish and violent fen-
sions. Cnesco's experience in
this field wi1l perhaps be
turned to good account by
those states who accept the
co-operation which will then
be offered to them.
