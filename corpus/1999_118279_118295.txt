duct of the wa r. R at h e r , they were a tool to achieve its
p ri m a ry aim:ethnic separatism or domination of one
ethnic group over another. By the wa r ’s end in early
1 9 9 6 , all three sides had retreated into ethnically pure
a r e a s , controlled by their respective arm i e s.
To d ay, the Croat and Serb politicians insist on
remaining separat e . In fa c t , it is those ve ry groups res-
ponsible for the wo rst crimes who insist most ve h e-
mently on ethnic separat i o n .The lack of consensus
on a multiethnic society plays into the hands of Mus-
lim extremists, who also practice a more subtle policy
of ethnic exclusion.All three groups have formed their
own school curri c u l a , which reinforce ethnic hat r e d ,
blame the other gr o u p s , and glorify their own my t h o-
l o g y. Each has begun religious instruction in the
s c h o o l s , which often takes the most pri m i t i ve form of
ethnic indoctri n at i o n . All this only serves to cement
the wa rtime ethnic cleansing.
The sad truth is that four ye a rs after Dayton (see
b ox ) , neither side is any closer to reconciliation than
in late 1995. M a ny Bosnians of all nationalities will
s t ate openly that they can stop hat i n g, but that they
will neither forgi ve nor forget what happened duri n g
the wa r.And many add that they wish to be left alone
with their own ethnic gr o u p. After what the other
groups did to them, they no longer wish to live with
them any way. In a political climate that works against
the emergence of any reliable non-nationalist refe-
rence point,m e m b e rs of all communities still fear firs t
and foremost for the surv i val of their ethnic identity
and place group interests above all else.
R ather than work toward calming nationalist pas-
sions and anger, local politicians use these fears to fur-
ther their own political agendas.This is seen part i c u-
larly in the cases of the Serb and Croat populat i o n s ,
both of whom look toward a mother country outside
the borders of Bosnia and Herzegov i n a , and dream of
e ventually seceding and uniting their region with it.
From Belgrade and Zagr e b ,politicians continue to fa n
the flames of nationalist desire.The continued insis-
tence of nationalist parties in Bosnia and Herzegov i n a ,
urged on by nationalists outside,on creating ethni-cally
pure terri t o ries stands as the gr e atest obstacle to recon-
c i l i at i o n . Until the outside forces live up to their obli-
g ations under Dayton and stop pushing for “ gr e at e r ”
n ational progr a m m e s , little progress will be made in
the reconciliation of the country ’s pre-war ethnically
d i ve rse populat i o n .And until that time,its citizens will
l i ve in an environment of fear of the other ethnic gr o u p s.
I
n November 1995,Bosnia and Herzegovina signed
the Dayton Peace A c c o r d s , a document designed
to create a new unified state comprised of two multi-
ethnic entities. It would have a functioning central
g ove rn m e n t ,hold democratic elections and adhere to
i n t e rn ational human rights standards.Displaced per-
sons were to be allowed to return to their homes and
indicted war criminals were to be arrested and turn e d
over to the Intern ational Tri bunal of The Hague.
To d ay ’s reality is dramatically different.The coun-
t ry consists of three de facto mono-ethnic entities, t h r e e
s e p a r ate arm i e s , three separate police forces, and a
n ational gove rnment that exists mostly on paper.M o s t
indicted war criminals remain at large.N ationalist poli-
tical part i e s , including many of the ethnic cleansers
who were responsible for the war in the first place,
remain securely in powe r. N ationalist extremists—
often backed by the ruling political parties—still bomb
and torch the homes of returning refugees in cert a i n
a r e a s.
C o n t r a ry to the pronouncements of local nat i o n a-
list politicians or intern ational officials wishing to avo i d
taking responsibility, the Serbs, C r o ats and Muslims
l i ved together relat i vely peacefully in Bosnia and Her-
z e g ovina for hundreds of ye a rs.All three groups res-
pected each others ’r e l i gious customs and holidays and
i n t e rm a rriage was common. But something changed
when all sides committed gri e vous atrocities duri n g
the wa r.These crimes were not an accidental by-pro-
