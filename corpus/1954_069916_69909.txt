HOW

been designated to receive requests for them.

A Send in a request giving the following informa-
^'tion, to the Allocating Agency in your country:

...AND HOW YOU CASH THEM
You must go in person to the Cashing Agency in the
country(ies) for which your coupons are valid. Counter¬
sign the coupons in the presence of the cashier. Travel
Coupons are not endorsable.
WHAT
THEY
ARE
Officially called Travel Coupons, they
are issued by Unesco to remove
the handicap which restricts educa¬
tional travel between countries.
People in soft-currency areas often find it difficult,
or even impossible, to convert the money of their
own country into the foreign exchange needed to
spend time abroad for study or research.
Unesco has therefore introduced the Travel
Coupon System, which supplements national
allowances of foreign currency and which
enables you to buy coupons in your national
currency and cash them in the currency of the
country to which you are travelling. Unesco
makes its own hardcurrency reserves available
to facilitate this currency exchange.
Unesco Travel Coupons may be cashed in the country of-
destination to defray the cost of personal maintenance
there (lodging, meals, etc.), educational expenses (books,
tuition, etc.), and in certain cases, when tickets cannot be
bought In local currency, to pay for transportation.
Travel Coupons are issued in denominations of $ I 0, $25
and $100.
