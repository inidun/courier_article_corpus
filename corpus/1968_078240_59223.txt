HOKKAIDOfrontier land of the Far North
Our "Far West" is how the
Japanese describe Hokkaido,
their country's northernmost and
second largest island only
a century ago a wild and barren
land. Hokkaido's first
step to modernization was
taken at the start of the Meiji
era through the efforts
of pioneer settlers and the
launching of development
programmes to tap
its rich natural resources.
The results are seen today In
Hokkaido's burgeoning
industrial cities, busy steel
plants and mining sites, lumber
industries (including the
world's largest newsprint mill)
and flourishing agricultural
and fishing industries. Only one
hour by air from Tokyo
(left, plane leaves snow-
covered Kushiro airport),
Hokkaido is to be linked to
Honshu, Japan's main island, by
a 37 kilometre-long rail
tunnel. On completion in 1975
it will be the world's
longest undersea tunnel. Right,
Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo,
with a population of 850,000,
during the famous annual Snow
Festival, when streets
are filled with sculptures in Ice.
Sapporo has been chosen as
the site for the 1972
Olympic Winter Games.

HOKKAIDO (Continued)
Harvesting and drying of, seaweed (photos above), a product
used by Japan's food industry, now provides a regular
income for formerly impoverished inhabitants of Hokkaido's
coastal areas. Below, a collective marriage ceremony on one of
Hokkaido's Pilot Farms. The bridegrooms are pioneer
settlers and their brides come from local families. Cups of sake
(fermented rice liquor) on table are exchanged
between couples according to traditional wedding rites. Right,
newly-weds set off on their honeymoon by sledge. With a
fifth of Japan's total area, its lowest population density and
a pleasant climate in summer, Hokkaido attracts a large number
of young settlers, eager to start a new life in Japan's
northern frontier land.
