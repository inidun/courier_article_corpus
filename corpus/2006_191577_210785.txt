Scene extracted from the Olonkho performance Kyys Debiliïé.


vOnce upon a time there was a witch 
from the Lower World named 
Sarakhana. One day, she stole three 
babies from the Upper, Middle and 
Lower Worlds. Sarakhana’s three 
adopted children, transformed into 
wolves, soon conquered the home-
land of hero Chugdaan Bukhatyyr. 
He battled them and won the vic-

tory. But the losers called their “old-
er brother” for help, the monster 
Dyghyidaana Beghe, and the hero 
was forced to retreat. 
So begins “Kyys Debiliie”, one of the 
countless variations of the Olonkho 
epos, handed down from genera-
tion to generation in the Sakha Re-
public in Yakutia, a north-eastern 
region of the Russian Federation. 
Delving into local warrior legends 
and closely connected to shamanic 
folklore, it carries the epic memory 
of the Yakut nation. As in ancient 
Greek myth, the Olonkho gods 
put the first humans on earth, in 
the Middle World. The gods ruled 
over the Upper World, its borders 
inhabited by dangerous giants, the 
abaasy. The Underworld was the 
domain of monsters hostile to hu-
mankind. But behind the array of 
warrior adventures, the struggle for 
good and evil is at the heart of this 
oral tradition.
An epos 
that is sung
Unlike most other epic tales the 
Yakut Olonkho is not spoken but 
sung. The personality and actions 
of each character have their own 
melody. The Olonkhosut, the nar-
rator, sings the monologues of the 
heroes and recites the rest in a 
rapid tempo, in a sort of sing-song 
chant. He may mix in the imitation 
of a horse neighing, birds singing 
or other animal sounds. With these 
different voices, alternating song 
and recitation, the Olonkhosut can 
keep spectators on the edge of 
their seats the whole night long. 
The Olonkho belongs to the epic 
arts of the Turkic-Mongolian peo-
ples and its melodies reveal its ori-
ental influences. Specialists have 
also found that the Olonkho has 
elements in common with Indian 
raga, Central Asian makom and 
Azeri magam, which gave birth to 
Gregorian chant. Traditional Yakut 
music is also linked to the tradition-
al song of the akyn in Kazakhstan 
and Kyrghyzstan. 
The Yakut epos had its moment of 
glory in the early 20th century. Plays 
were staged based on the Olonkho, 
including “Young Hero Beriet Ber-
ghen” (1906) or “The Hero Kulan-
tai on his Prancing Horse” (1907). 
Then it foundered in the Soviet 
period. Considered a remnant of 
the past, the popular tradition was 
banned. It continued, but went un-
derground. As a result, while once 
there were hundreds of Olonkhosut 
in Yacutia, now there are only two: 
Daria Tomskaya, 96, in the village 
of Ene, and Piotr Rechetnikov, 77, 
in the village of Cherkekh. “Yet in a 
world where people are constantly 
pushed around, the Olonkho’s se-
renity is beneficial,” comments An-
drei Borissov, film and theatre di-
rector of the Olonkho performance 
Kyys Debiliie.
A threatened 
tradition
In response to the threat against 
this oral tradition, UNESCO pro-
claimed the Olonkho a Masterpiece 
of the Oral and Intangible Heritage 
of Humanity. A number of initiatives 
to ensure its safeguarding were 
taken following the proclamation. A 
decree “on the measures for con-
servation, study and circulation of 
the Yakut heroic epos Olonkho” 
was adopted, proposing primar-
ily to launch an “Olonkho decade 
2006-2015” in the Republic and 
pay a pension to the “living de-
positories of the epic tradition” 
Daria Tomskaya and Piotr Rechet-
nikov. An Olonkho study centre, 
an Olonkho theatre and an annual 
folklore festival entitled “World cul-
ture on Olonkho territory” will also 
be founded. Particular focus, final-
ly, has been given to the younger 
generation – the ministry of educa-
tion will develop educational pro-
grammes and material devoted to 
the Olonkho epos».
