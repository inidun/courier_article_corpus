BLACK AND BLUE, 
L IBYA’S LIQUID LEG ACY
◗ Amy Otchet
Libya is mining water to feed its Great Man-Made River but is still not sure how to use 
this precious resource
◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
Huge pipelines have been laid to link wellfields in the desert with the coastal strip inhabited by 85 per cent of Libya’s population.

Ye a rs can roll by without a single sho-
wer raining on much of Libya ’s
Sahara—one of the wo r l d ’s most for-
bidding stretches of desert ,c ove ring 90 per
cent of the country. Like a slab of clay for-
gotten in an ove r - h e ated kiln, flat bands of
scorched sandstone, cracked and bri t t l e , gi ve
way to wind-rippled dunes,o f f e ring the only
gentle touch to this barren landscape, w h e r e
a scraggy tree exudes an almost spiritual aura
by its defiance to surv i ve .
Yet beneath this baked crust of eart h ,
there is water—not just the last trickles of
nearly dry streams but phenomenal supplies
p e r c o l ating in four sandstone aquifers. I m a-
gine filling a pool the size of Germ a ny, s e ve-
ral hundred metres deep, to grasp the quan-
tities of water contained in these basins.
The aquifers are the liquid legacy of a
climate gone by. About 10,000 years ago,
the barren Sahara was a green sava n n a h ,
crawling with crocodiles, giraffes and ele-
p h a n t s. Tropical rainforests bloomed on
mountaintops while our Neolithic ances-
t o rs harvested wheat-like crops in the
p l a i n s. H e avy rains regularly refilled the
ri ve rs and lakes, but significant amounts
also seeped undergr o u n d , s at u r ating the
layers of sandstone until they sloshed with
wat e r.At the bottom of the basins, r e a c h i n g
depths of four kilometres, there may be
water millions of years old.
Little remains from that green period:
climate change choked off the rains about
3,000 ye a rs ago. For millennia, the aqui-

shifted in the 1970s when the oil boom tri g-
gered a looming water crisis with the sharp
rise in living standards and populat i o n
gr owth (from 1.5 million to the current five
m i l l i o n ) .O f ficials didn’t need a crystal ball to
see gr o u n d water supplies falling prey to the
s e a ’s intru s i o n . I m a gine a war of at t ri t i o n
b e t ween land and the sea, e ve r - h u n gry for
more terri t o ry. The gr o u n d water supplies
reinforce the land’s resistance to the bat t e-
ring waves of the sea. So a steep fall in wat e r
tables is like an open inv i t ation for the sea
which now intrudes another 100 metres
u n d e r ground each ye a r. This saline trail
c o n t a m i n ates what little freshwater remains
and ravages the fine coat of ochre soil, l e a-
ving the roots of orange trees so choked with
salt that many bear little more than gr e e n
f ruit the size of ping-pong balls.
“The question has never been: should we
mine water or not?” s ays Omar Salem,d i r e c-
tor general of the General Water A u t h o ri t y.
“ R ather it’s been: if we don’t find a solution
to the water short a g e ,we will face a ve ry dark
future.” After weighing the options, the
g ove rnment ruled out desalinat i o n ,c o n s i d e-
red too expensive and risky as the country
would be entirely dependent on foreign tech-
nology and expertise to maintain the plants,
explains Salem.With such fa bulous supplies
lining the desert (ve ry roughly estimated at
120,000 cubic km), the choice was clear:
m ove the people to the water or the water to
the people. With few families enticed by
d e s e rt life, the gove rnment opted for the lat-

f e rs lay largely untouched as ve ry little
water flowed in or out,according to scien-
tists.Yet today most of Libya’s citizens are
drinking and bathing in these extraordina-
rily pure “fossil waters”.
War of attrition 
between land and sea
A u t h o rities first turned on the taps of the
G r e at Man-Made River Project (GMRP) in
1 9 9 1 . Considered the wo r l d ’s largest civil
e n gi n e e ring project,the ri ver is a work in pro-
gr e s s.To d ay,about half a million cubic metres
of water are flowing daily through two gi a n t
u n d e r ground pipelines connecting we l l - fie l d s
deep in the desert to the coastal rim where
about 85 per cent of the population live .T h e
g ove rnment is mining water in much the
same way as oil—and in so doing adds a new
twist to an old debat e :w h at are the risks of
relying on a non-renewable resource? W i t h
e ve ry litre used today lost for tomorr ow,w h at
about generations to come? You don’t only
i n h e rit resources from your parents, s ay
c o n s e rvat i o n i s t s ,you borr ow them from yo u r
c h i l d r e n .
But as the Libyans remind us, scarcely a
whimper is heard today about the wo r l d ’s
dependence on another finite fossil resource,
p e t r o l e u m .W hy balk at mining water and
not oil? The two come hand-in-hand in
L i b ya . In the mid-1960s, d i s c ove ry of the
c o u n t ry ’s vast petroleum resources led geo-
l o gists to explore the aquifers for a simple
r e a s o n : o i l rigs require wat e r. But the scale
ter in 1983 and began building the Man-
Made River which is both praised as the
Wo r l d ’s Eighth Wonder and branded as Col.
Q a d h a fi’s “Pipe Dream”.
It took an army of Asian construction
wo r k e rs ye a rs to dynamite and dig the tun-
nels to lay the giant concrete pipes, f o u r
metres in diameter, wide enough for a sub-
way train to pass—or tanks, missiles and
troops, according to a few Western media
r e p o rts citing anonymous sources which
claim that the Man-Made River is inten-
ded for cove rt military purp o s e s. W h i l e
these stories are rejected as fantasy by
e x p e rts in intern ational organizat i o n s
(including UN E S C O) , the scale of the project
opens the floodgates of the imagination.A
road from Tripoli to Bombay could be
paved with the five million tons of cement
used to build the pipelines, which stretch
over a total length of 3,500 km. I m a gi n e
transposing the conve yance system on a
map of We s t e rn Europe: the pipeline wo u l d
b e gin in southern Switzerland and head
through Germ a ny and on up to Po l a n d
before cutting west to northern Scotland.
In reality, it takes an average of nine days for
every drop of water to travel from Libya’s
desert well- fields to the coast.
The nightmare of construction logi s-
tics took a surreal turn in 1986 when the
U.S. government imposed sanctions limi-
ting travel and commercial operations with
L i b ya1, s ays Mr A . M .E l - G h e ri a n i ,g e n e r a l
manager of the GMRP. The first order of
business lay with the project’s designers, a
consulting firm based in Houston and
1 In 1992, the United Nations also imposed
sanctions (including a ban on civil aviation and
severely restricting commercial activities) in
response to Col. Qadhafi’s refusal to extradite two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet
above Lockerbie, Scotland.The UN suspended
these sanctions in 1999 after Tripoli handed over
the suspects for a trial to take place in the
Netherlands.
‘The difficult choice 
is between two development
options. Do we want large-
s cale extraction of
groundwater for max i m u m
b e n e fit of the present
g e n e ration or limited
e x t raction that ensures
s u s tainable development 
and conservation of 
the resource base?’
In the next two or three years, Libya plans to irrigate 150,000 hectares of land in addition to its current
irrigated area of some 500,000 hectares.

other than Dick Cheney, f o rmer U. S .s e c r e-
tary of defence.The company quickly pas-
sed into the hands of a subsidiary, Brown
and Root, c o nveniently located in England.
The wheeling and dealing required to
obtain spare parts has inflated the project’s
hefty price-tag, estimated at a total of $27
billion—which the gove rnment has been
financing mostly by conve rting oil into
water by taxing petroleum exports.
“All major civil engi n e e ring projects are
c ri t i c i z e d , but especially the GMRP gi ve n
the country that Libya is,”s ays Dr A b d u l g a d e r
A .A bu faye d ,who is responsible for allocat i n g
GMRP wat e r. L i b ya is not the only country
mining fossil wat e r. Egypt is tapping into
a q u i f e rs in its we s t e rn desert for a massive pro-
ject to irri g ate 200,000 hectares. E ven the
United States is pumping non-renewa b l e
s o u r c e s. While Californ i a ’s water mining is
m a r ginal compared to that of Libya , it is
c o n t r ove rsial gi ven that the U. S . is a wat e r - ri c h
c o u n t ry with altern at i ve supplies. But what
choices are open to hy p e r - a rid countries? Fo r
these countri e s , the question is not whether to
use fossil wat e r , but when and how? 
More today 
means less tomorrow
“The difficult choice is between two deve-
lopment options,” s ays Mohamed Bakhba-
k h i , a Libyan hy d r o l o gist with the Nubian
Sandstone Aquifer System Progr a m m e ,
which promotes data exchange between the
four countries sharing these basins (Chad,
E g y p t ,L i b ya and Sudan).“Do we want large-
scale extraction of gr o u n d water for maxi-
mum benefit of the present generation or
limited extraction that ensures sustainable
d e velopment and conservation of the resour-
ce base?” L i b ya is now at a crossroads: t h e
Man-Made River is only flowing at about a
tenth of its capacity to cover domestic needs
on the coast.The gove rnment must now deci-
de how to use the rest of the water and put
the needed infrastructure in place.Should it
use eve ry last drop for large-scale irri g at i o n
projects or opt for a more conservat i ve poli-
cy, focusing more on ensuring drinking sup-
plies and industrial use,which require far less
than agri c u l t u r e ?
O f fic i a l l y, a griculture is the top pri o ri t y
of the Man-Made Rive r. For the next 50
ye a rs , the project is designed to deliver about
six million cubic metres of water daily, w i t h
75 to 80 per cent going to fa rm s ,a c c o r d i n g
to Dr.Ali Giuma, s e c r e t a ry (minister) of agri-
c u l t u r e .I t ’s important to understand that
major infrastructure projects are norm a l l y
built to last at least 50 ye a rs.The aquifers will
not dry up at the end of that period but they
m ay be far more difficult to mine.“ You might
be able to extend the conve yance system or
put in another we l l - fie l d ,” s ays John Lloy d ,
a British professor at Birmingham Unive rs i-
ty and a leading gr o u n d water expert . In the
L i b yan desert , the wells reach between 400-
600 metres undergr o u n d . In 50 ye a rs ,t h e
water tables of the we s t e rn aquifers , f o r
e x a m p l e , are expected to fall about 80 metres
if they are pumped at full capacity.Te c h n i-
c a l l y, it will be possible to continue pumping
at these lower levels (assuming that the wat e r
quality doesn’t change).In Saudi A r a b i a ,f o r
e x a m p l e , water wells reach down a kilometre
or two underground even though they are
more expensive to operat e . But as Lloy d
points out, “ Water may be more precious
in the future, so it might be wo rth pumping
d e e p e r.”
With this in mind, the agri c u l t u r e
m i n i s t e r , Dr Giuma, ploughs ahead with
irrigation plans to work towards the natio-
nal goal of agricultural self-sufficiency. “In
the next two or three years, we plan to add
another 150,000 irrigated hectares to the
current total of about half a million,” says
Giuma.While fruits and vegetables are in
ample supply, L i b ya relies on wheat and
barley imports to satisfy 60 per cent of
domestic demand.To redress the balance,
government-sponsored farms are starting
to sprout around Sirt , Colonel Qadhafi’s
native city, and Benghazi.
This is big sky country,with the flat l a n d s
s u rrounding Benghazi looking picture per-
fect for a giant wheat belt.Red topcoats of
soil are carefully tilled beside white-domed
water tanks crowning each of the 520 new
fa rm s , which the gove rnment is prepari n g
to virtually gi ve away at prices of just 2,000
d i n a rs ($1,000 at the black market exchan-
ge rate) for 10 hectares. Not by chance, t h e
Man-Made River flows nearby via two reser-
voirs the size of football fields.
Importing wheat
saves precious water
But the apparent abundance of irri g a-
tion water is a kind of mirage, hiding the
fact that this is an arid zone where wat e r
e va p o r ates at rates of 40 to 60 per cent.
I n d e e d , half of all water now used for irri-
g ation is wa s t e d , according to Ayad S.
K a a l , a hy d r o g e o l o gist with the A gri c u l t u r e
Research Centre. Kaal is hoping that
conditions will improve as fa rm e rs learn to
use more efficient techniques such as dri p
i rri g at i o n .
But the decision to invest in agri c u l t u-
re leaves many scientific expert s ,p a rt i c u-
larly from the West,baffled.With the inter-
n ational grain market in a glut, w hy not
i m p o rt wheat and save precious water for
i n d u s t ries that not only use less but also pro-
duce better paying jobs? “Of course it might
be cheaper to buy wheat abroad but what if
there is another embargo to limit these
imports?”asks Dr Ibrahim Salem Haffala,
an economist with the Agriculture Resear-
ch Centre.
As Haffala explains,We s t e rn pri n c i p l e s
of economics don’t seem to apply here as
they fail to take account of surr o u n d i n g

political and cultural fa c t o rs. For example,
fa rming is seen as a partial solution to ri s i n g
u n e m p l oy m e n t , s ays Dr Giuma. T h e
g ove rnment wants to dive rsify the job mar-
k e t , d o m i n ated by the energy sector, b y
subsidizing a new managerial class in agri-
c u l t u r e .These “gentlemen fa rm e rs ” wo u l d
s u p e rvise foreign wo r k e rs from Egypt,
Sudan and elsewhere in Africa.
“ I t ’s impossible to make a defin i t i ve sta-
tement like, ‘ D o n ’t use water for agri c u l-
t u r e ,’ ” s ays Phillipe Pa l l a s , a French
consultant with the Food and Agriculture
Organization who has worked closely with
Libyan officials for the past 25 years. “But
there are people questioning whether or not
it might be cheaper to import wheat.This
marks a big change.Five years ago, no one
in the gove rnment would even agree to dis-
cuss the option. To d ay there is a nat i o n a l
debate, though it’s difficult to say at what
level it’s taking place.”
In the revo l u t i o n a ry rhetoric of Col.
Q a d h a fi’s Ja m a h i ri ya — s t ate of the masses—
a gricultural self-suffic i e n cy appears to be
an exalted pri n c i p l e ,which few would publi-
cly disavow. But respect for the pri n c i p l e
might not translate into active commitment
to the goal. “ We will be as sufficient as pos-
sible with our resources,” s ays Dr A b o u-
faye d ,who is responsible for allocating wat e r
to fa rm s.“The Great Man-Made River Pro-
ject is not the magic solution to all of our
water problems. It gi ves us the breat h i n g
space to develop new technologies and an
i n t e gr ated water policy.To raise public awa-
reness of the value of wat e r , we are setting
up economic disincentives for waste by
making fa rm e rs pay for the water they use.”
The apparent pragmatism should, h owe ve r ,
be taken with a grain of salt: at just 48
dirham (25-50 cents) per cubic metre,the
price tag reflects only a fraction of the true
costs of delivering the water. And even this
nominal rate won’t be charged until farms
are deemed “profitable”.
It may be a matter of time before offi-
cials admit to what experts like Pallas see as
o b v i o u s : “They would need another two of
three Man-Made Rive rs to be self-suffic i e n t
in agri c u l t u r e ,” he say s , pointing to projec-
tions calculated with Libya ’s General Wat e r
A u t h o ri t y. In the year 2025, L i b ya ’s popula-
tion is expected to reach almost 12 million
(including non-nat i o n a l s ) , with domestic
water needs swa l l owing up about 55 per cent
of the total capacity of the Man-Made Rive r.
Yet even if eve ry last drop of water (GMRP,
r e n e wable gr o u n d water sources and recy-
cled supplies) was used exclusively for agri-
c u l t u r e , L i b ya would still need to import
about half of its food supplies.
‘Big fixes’—
a technological mirage
“The responsible use of such an extra-
o r d i n a ry project demands that you deve l o p
the ve ry best conservation policies possible
so that nobody in the future can look back
and say : ‘ W h at a wa s t e ! ’ ” s ays Mike
Edmunds,a member of the British Geolo-
gical Survey team which explored the aqui-
fers in the 1960s. His praise for the project
is tempered by caution: “I just hope they
[officials] understand that big engineering
‘ fixe s ’ to water crises wo n ’t always be there.”
Big fixes are a virtual obsession for the
general manager of the GMRP, E l - G h e i r a-
n i a . Sceptical that desalination will ever be
a f f o r d a b l e , he aims to keep the Man-Made
R i ver flowing as long as possible. In A u g u s t
1 9 9 9 , pipes bu rst along the eastern corri-
d o r , forcing the gove rnment to close the taps
of this pipeline for about a month. C o rr o s i o n
is the likely culpri t . “With hundreds of thou-
sands of pipes crossing through so many dif-
ferent kinds of soils across a scorched desert ,
you can expect to have diffic u l t i e s ,” s ays El-
G h e ri a n i .G i ven the uncert a i n t i e s , might it
be time to invest in infrastructure to better
c o n s e rve the precious wat e r.“In the future,
c o n s e rvation will be an area of concern for
all countri e s ,” s ays El-Gheri a n i .B e s i d e s ,“ we
d o n ’t have the experience to know that the
a q u i f e rs aren’t being recharged,” he say s ,
b rushing aside the studies showing the
c o n t r a ry. “They [We s t e rn experts] said we
only had enough oil for 30 ye a rs but it’s still
flow i n g .W hy not wat e r ? ” Inshallah!* ■
