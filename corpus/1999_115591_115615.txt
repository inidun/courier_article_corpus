As Pa l e s t i n e ’s re p resentative in France and a
s p o ke s p e rson for the Palestinian A u t h o r i t y,
y o u ’ re often in the media spotlight. But you
only have a very brief entry in the latest
edition of Who’s Who in the Arab World . . .
Perhaps it’s better that way. I’m not an
ambassador in the usual sense because
Palestine isn’t a state ye t . As representa-
t i ve of a people who for the past half-century
h ave been trying to win recognition, I have
to fight a battle on two fronts. One—more
behind-the-scenes—is to maintain close
ties with France and the European Union
so as to defend the political rights of the
Palestinian people.The other is public, a n d
i nvo l ves correcting a number of widely-
accepted “facts” through the media.The
Palestinian question is perhaps the most
consistently and massively distorted inter-
national political issue.
Not so long ago it was said that the Pa l e s-
tinian people didn’t exist. Palestine was consi-
dered a country without inhabitants—a
d e s e rt—for a people without a land, the Je w s.
Its name was removed from maps and history
books the day Israel was creat e d .
I t ’s been an existential bat t l e . Fo r
decades,Israelis thought they would cease
to exist if they recognized the Palestinian
p e o p l e . And Europeans thought that reco-
gnizing the Palestinians would be tanta-
mount to betraying the Israelis, a people
t owards whom they had strong guilt feelings
because of the Holocaust.So we’ve had to
fight to set things straight and show that
recognition could happen on an equal basis.
Most Israelis today, especially the new gene-
r ation of histori a n s , a gree that Pa l e s t i n e
wasn’t a desert in 1948.
The other main historical distortion has
been the dismissal of the Palestinian people
as a bunch of armed fig h t e rs and terr o ri s t s.
The i n t i fa d a, which lasted from 1987 to
1 9 9 3 , did a lot to show there was a society
t h e r e , just like any other, with all its compo-
n e n t s , including women and children. B u t
t h e r e ’s still prejudice. Palestinians are still tar-
gets of stereotypes regarding Arabs and Mus-
lims in general.They spring from eve ry d ay
racism and the legacy of colonial times.
You’re a “foreign” Palestinian—one from
the outside. How did your family come to
leave Palestine and what was it like to live
in exile?
My mother’s family has always been very
involved in the Palestinian national move-
ment born at the turn of the century after
the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the
b e ginning of the British Mandate in Pa l e s-
tine which was supposed to pave the way for
independence.From then on, Palestinians
began to demand the right to found a stat e .
But it very soon became clear that, unlike
S y ria and Lebanon, Palestine would not
succeed in that goal, because it had to make
way for the Jewish national home which
the British had promised to the Zionists.
When the Palestinian national move-
ment saw that political and diplomat i c
means were not enough to reve rse what
was happening, it resorted to arm s. T h e
f i rst big Palestinian uprising against the
British, the first intifada, was in 1936. My
gr a n d father and gr e at uncle took part in it.
In 1939, my grandfather was arrested and
sent off to a military camp in the Seychelles.
Like all the leaders of the move m e n t , he wa s
detained until 1945, d u ring which time
women and children were deported to areas
under the French mandat e . So my mother,
who came from Je ru s a l e m , found herself in
L e b a n o n . It was there that she met my
fat h e r , who had come as a student from
A c r e , in Pa l e s t i n e .They got married and my
t wo sisters and I grew up outside Pa l e s-
tine,like two-thirds of all Palestinians.
Where does your political awareness stem
from?
My fa m i l y. I was ve ry affected by the 1967
Arab-Israeli wa r , which broke out the day I
was due to take my high school gr a d u at i o n
e x a m ,on June 5.The exam was cancelled.We
were sure that we ’d win the wa r , but when we
realized after six days that Israel had beat e n
all the Arab armies—of Syri a , Egypt and
Jo r d a n — we were shat t e r e d . June 1967 was a
ve ry deep shock for Arab intellectuals. We
thought that the intern ational community
would be sympathetic to the injustice and
exile Palestinians were forced to endure.We



Since her high-school days she has embraced the Palestinian cause. Now,
as the Palestinian Authority’s representative in France, Leila Shahid is

thought that it would support us. But it
applauded the Israeli victory instead.
I decided to get invo l ved in political
activism and I began learning how to handle
we a p o n s. It was a symbolic way of restori n g
a sense of dignity. But I soon realized I
wa s n ’t cut out for the military and opted for
political and social work in the Palestinian
refugee camps. In my first year of unive rs i t y,
I took part in activities to prepare for the
i n t i fa d a. In 1969, the refugees rose up to win
the right to organize politically and manage
their own affa i rs. From then on, the va ri o u s
groups which made up the Palestine Libe-
r ation Organization (PLO) took part in
running the camps, which were adminis-
tered by the United Nations via UNWRA
(the United Nations Relief and Wo r k s
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
E a s t ) .This was a ve ry intense period for me.
I felt like I had returned to Palestine and
r e d i s c overed my history and culture. A f t e r
t h at , I went off to study anthropology in
F r a n c e , where I met my husband, who is
M o r o c c a n , and we went to live in his country.
In 1989,President A r a fat asked me to repre-
sent the PLO in Ireland. From there I wa s
sent to the Netherlands and finally to France.
Has being a woman ever been a handicap
for you?
I come from a family of three gi r l s , so I
never had to defend myself against a boy
who might have wanted to get the upper
hand. My f ather, who was a professor of
medicine,believed strongly in the equality
of the sexes, and both my parents always
backed me in what e ver I wanted to do. M y
husband has the same attitude.
How has the Arab-Israeli conflict affected
Palestinian women?
M a ny women found themselves in foreign
c o u n t ri e s , away from their traditional vil-
lage surr o u n d i n g s , side by side with men
who were traumatized and jobless. T h e s e
men were so humiliated by the loss of their
lands that they had no strength to react. S o
the women had to take charge of things and
organize day - t o - d ay life with ve ry few means.
If they hadn’t been uprooted like this, i t
would have taken decades to break with tra-
d i t i o n .A l s o, U N W R A , which was in charge
of education and health in the refugee camps,
inside and outside Pa l e s t i n e , set up a system
of compulsory education for all, both boy s
and gi r l s.This partly explains why Pa l e s t i-
nians have one of the highest literacy rates in

the Arab wo r l d .But Palestinian women have
a lways been aware that their role in the resis-
tance would not be enough to guarantee
them equal rights with men. So they have
t ried to organize themselve s , not just as mili-
tant nationalists but also as wo m e n .
To do what?
There are a number of wo m e n ’s organiza-
t i o n s.M a ny are working on a code to defin e
the status of women and a constitutional
guarantee of equality.There is a good start i n g
point since the 1988 declaration underlines
t h at the Palestinian state will have a parlia-
m e n t a ry system which guarantees equal
rights for men and wo m e n . But it’s hard to
put into practice, because we can’t cut our-
s e l ves off completely from the rest of the
r e gi o n ,where individual rights are based on
Islamic law, the s h a ri a.T h e r e ’s a debate bet-
ween lay people and religious officials in
society and in parliamentary bodies. B e yo n d
the judicial fie l d , wo m e n ’s groups have pro-
grammes which encourage women to take
paid jobs. O t h e rs are doing research. B i r

Zeit Unive rsity has the regi o n ’s only centre

Yet there are very few women in the
Palestinian Authority. Isn’t there a risk of
finding the Algerian syndrome in which
women are sent back to the kitchen as
soon as the struggle is over?
The fight isn’t ove r , either against the occu-
pation or for women’s rights. And the two
are linked. For wo m e n ,e ve rything depends
on the balance of power in the society.T h e
future of the progr e s s i ve , s e c u l a rist ten-
dency led by President Arafat depends on
the peace process. If that collapses, the fun-
damentalist position will get stronger and
a u t o m atically harm the position of wo m e n .
Are schools co-ed in Palestine?
There are two kinds of schools—the
UNWRA ones in the camps and those in
the autonomous areas run by the Pa l e s t i n i a n
Authority since 1994. Both are co-educa-
tional, except for a few in the Gaza Strip
which are pri vate schools serving the more
conservative elements of society.
What laws govern the status of Palestinian
women today?
It depends where they live .M a ny legal sys-
tems coexist in Pa l e s t i n e — O t t o m a n ,E n g l i s h ,
Egyptian (in the Gaza Stri p ) , Jordanian (the
West Bank) and Israeli (civil and military, i n
East Je ru s a l e m ) .I t ’s a unique situat i o n — s o
m a ny legal systems applying to so few people.
We ’re trying to come up with a body of law s
t h at will be truly Pa l e s t i n i a n .
You emphasize that a solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is crucial for the
whole Mediterranean region. Why?
After the creation of the state of Israel, t h e
c o n flict spread to Egypt, which was the firs t
c o u n t ry to sign a peace treat y, to southern
L e b a n o n , which has been occupied for 20
ye a rs , the Golan Heights (Syri a ) ,occupied for
30 ye a rs , and to Jo r d a n ,which recently signed
a peace treat y. A resolution of the confli c t
will show whether the peoples of the Medi-
t e rranean can live together in mutual res-
p e c t . If Palestinians and Israelis can manage
to do this, their example can encourage
o t h e rs — B e r b e rs and A r a b s ,Turks and Ku r d s ,
for example. Palestine isn’t like other coun-
t ri e s. I t ’s the heart of Mediterranean civiliza-
t i o n , the only place which brings together

An eclectic
education 
Education is considered a major priority for
Pa l e s t i n i a n s,an observation difficult to quan-
tify given the scope of the diaspora. H o w e v e r, t h e
political upheaval surrounding the i n t i f a d a h a s
taken a toll on education in the territories:lite-
racy rates have declined, while the dearth of
trained professionals in science and techno-
logy hampers the economic development.
The Palestinian Ministry of Education, o f fi-
cially set up in 1994,has the major task of conso-
lidating the eclectic system of public and priva t e
schools inherited after 27 years of occupation. I n
the West Bank, for example, schoolchildren follow
nine years of courses based on Jordanian curri-
c u l a ,while in Gaza, they take ten years of classes
following the Egyptian model.This system dates
back to 1948 when UN R W A (the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
in the Near East) began setting up schools in
the refugee camps to reflect the curricula of the
host nations. To d a y, the challenge lies in inte-
grating these different schools as well as the
public schools set up by the ministry and a small
percentage of private schools established by
Muslim and Christian organizations.O v e r a l l ,t h e
gender ratio in enrolment at the primary level is
e q u a l , although girls tend to have higher drop-out
rates as they move on to secondary levels and
higher education.All of the territories’ eight uni-
versities and over half of the some 20 community
colleges are priva t e.
The ministry is working closely with UNESCO,
a long-standing educational partner, to inte-
grate the various schools and find the funding
to enlarge the system as Palestinian families
return from the diaspora.A major priority also
lies in developing a standard curriculum and in
particular courses in Palestinian history—a for-
bidden subject throughout 27 years of occu-
pation. n

the three major monotheistic religions and
their cultures. Their peaceful coexistence
would have an impact beyond the regi o n —
e ve rywhere that different cultures are try i n g
to reject and exclude one another.
The Arab world currently seems to consist
of groups trying to dominate one another.
The Arab world hasn’t always been like this.
I t ’s a ve ry recent phenomenon.D o n ’t forget
t h at in A n d a l u s i a , Europeans and Arabs live d
together in extremely fruitful harm o ny until
the time of the Inquisition, when Chri s t i a n s
excluded Jews and Muslims from society.
The lack of tolerance we see in the A r a b -
Muslim world today is part of a contemporary
political crisis which began with the founding
of nat i o n - s t at e s. It isn’t an inherent part of
Arab culture. I t ’s to do with the failure of poli-
tical systems which have managed to defeat
colonialism but have n ’t found the path to
d e m o c r a cy or gi ven people a chance to aspire
in political, economic and cultural term s.S o
t h e y ’ ve fa i l e d , which is why people set such
i m p o rtance on their own identity or seek an
a l t e rn at i ve political ideology in religi o n .
The interim period for the application of
the Oslo Accords ends on May 4. What’s the
outcome of this process?
I t ’s disappointing. The peace process has
been at a standstill ever since Mr Netanya h u
came to power three ye a rs ago. So we ’re fa r
behind the agreed timetable.The Israeli army
should have withdrawn from all the occu-
pied terri t o ri e s. But so far we only control
three per cent of the West Bank and 60 per
cent of the Gaza Stri p.We should have been
able to hold both parliamentary and local
e l e c t i o n s , but the latter have n ’t been pos-
s i b l e .We should have completed most of the
toughest negotiations over the status of Je ru-
s a l e m , r e f u g e e s , s e t t l e m e n t s , b o r d e rs and
wat e r , but we have n ’t even started ye t . S o
does that mean nothing has been achieve d ?
N o, some gains are irr e ve rs i b l e . The most
i m p o rtant is the mutual recognition betwe e n
Israeli and Palestinian gove rnments and socie-
t i e s. It is now accepted that the Pa l e s t i n i a n
people exist and have national ri g h t s. T h e
second gain has been the right of return to the
homeland—the e l - ow d a of the Pa l e s t i n i a n
n ational movement which developed in
exile—has been recognized. It was marked by
the return of President A r a fat to build a stat e .
What has been done to create new
infrastructures?
Roads,industries and farms in the territo-
ries recovered by the Palestinian A u t h o ri t y
were mostly destroyed during the 30 years
of the occupat i o n . So fa r , not much progr e s s
has been made here, mainly because the ter-
ritories have been sealed off by the Israeli
a rmy.The economy can’t take off if the cir-
culation of goods and people is blocked.

This obstacle is smaller in social matters.
G r e at progress has been made in educat i o n
with the help of the European Union and
UNESCO. Palestinians invest a tremendous
amount in educating their children. I don’t
know of any other people, except perhaps
the Jews, who have compensated so much
for the loss of terri t o ry by acquiring know-
l e d g e . But there’s still a lot to be done,
especially creating a modern curri c u l u m
tailored to Palestinians and not copied from
courses in Egypt, Jordan or Israel.
Has the international community kept its
promises?
Ye s , a b s o l u t e l y. Donor countries can be
commended for guaranteeing the educat i o n
and health of a people wracked by eco-
nomic crisis. Over 60 per cent of the wor-
king population in the Gaza Strip is unem-
ployed, and over 47 per cent in the West

p o s i t i ve effect unless the pri vate sector
seriously invests,and for that we need sta-
bility and normalized political conditions.
There’s been a lot of talk in the press about
irregularities and corruption inside the
Palestinian Authority. What has been done
to tackle this?
I t ’s the kind of problem that threatens all
s o c i e t i e s , including the most advanced ones
in Europe.So imagine the difficulty in Pa l e s-

elections on May 17 to effectively cancel the
M ay 4 deadline set in the Oslo A c c o r d s.
After May 4 there will be a legal no-man’s -

void? We can’t live forever on a temporary
b a s i s. Are we going to let the Israeli gove rn-
ment take away our rights? Can the Pa l e s t i-
nians decide unilaterally to set up a state in
the West Bank, Gaza and East Je rusalem? W i l l
the intern ational community shoulder its
responsibilities after having recognized Pa l e s-
t i n i a n s ’ right to self-determ i n ation? All these
questions will arise on May 4.
Will you live in Palestine one day?

It will be part of the final negotiations. My
