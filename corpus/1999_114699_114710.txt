Charitable organizations look after the elderly when the family 
and the state can’t cope
L e b a n o n :t h e re ’s no place l i ke home

“ Family solidarity still exists in Lebanon, a n d
most elderly people still live with their
families,” says Abla Sebai, a member of the
c o u n t ry ’s National Committee for Old Pe o p l e ,
which was founded a year ago. In fact,83 per cent
of over-60s still live with their relatives. But, in a
trend which may spread throughout the Arab wo r l d ,
links between generations are more and more
strained and there is now a gr owing number of
lonely and very poor elderly people.
Aunt Marie has tears in her eyes as she looks at
pictures from her yo u t h . Her only remaining
r e l at i ve is a niece, living abroad, and a nephew who
only makes fleeting visits every fortnight.She is 75
and lives alone in the east Beirut suburb of
A s h r a fieh in one room furnished with a bed and
t wo sofa s. She walks with difficulty and is part of the
61 per cent of the population without health
i n s u r a n c e .The social security authorities cut people
off as soon as they retire.“Less than 10 per cent of
the working population receives an adequat e
pension,” says Sebai.
Joseph Tautal, a founder-member of the Rifak
al-Darb organization set up in 1994 to help the
aged poor in A s h r a fie h ,s ays that “67 old people are
living alone and without resources in this
n e i g h b o u r h o o d . Some of them beg in the streets of
Beirut.” He says people,“especially the youth, are
still mostly unaware of the problem but a move m e n t
is gr owing among church congr e g ations and
h u m a n i t a rian groups because there is no system
which helps the elderly living alone.”
S e ven per cent of Lebanese are over 65, t h e
highest proportion of old people in the Arab wo r l d ,
where the average is reckoned to be four per cent.
By 2021, the Lebanese figure is expected to reach
eight per cent and 12.8 per cent four ye a rs after
t h at .“At present, there are many young Lebanese,”
s ays Lebanese demographer Hala Naufa l , “ bu t
there is a clear aging trend which is going to spread
to the other Arab countries.”
A long waiting list
H owe ver there is still no gove rnment policy
concerning the elderly, much less for people living
a l o n e . E ven preliminary studies have not been
d o n e . So eve rything depends on chari t a b l e
o r g a n i z at i o n s. And because of a serious lack of
money and resources, the 37 non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations which are doing the gove rn m e n t ’s
job have gi ven pri o rity to caring for old people who
are ill.
S t .G e o r g e ’s Home, which is linked to the Greek
Orthodox Church, has been taking in the elderly
since 1874.“Sixty of our 133 beds are unusable,”
s ays Father Demetrios Khoury,who runs the home.
“The state doesn’t pay its due and 68 per cent of the
old people with no family left don’t pay anything.”
Within two ye a rs , he hopes to have 220 beds
ava i l a b l e . For the time being, he is turning away
new patients who cannot pay, even if they are ill.
But the home still has a long waiting list.
The situation is the same at the Dar al-Ajaza
al-Islami Hospital, a pri vate clinic run by the
Muslim community.“With 3,000 beds for an ove r -
65 population of 225,000, we have a real problem,”
s ays the hospital’s gerontologi s t . “There aren’t
m a ny people in my fie l d .There are only seven of us
officially registered with the Doctor’s Guild, four of
us since 1995, and demand is gr owing all the time.”
In three ye a rs , only four new institutions for the
elderly have been opened.
M o r e over the economic crisis and the trend
towards individualism which the war years created
have set off developments and changes in lifestyles
which have eaten away at family solidari t y.
“Increasingly, families say they no longer have the
space, time or money to look after relatives,” says
M rs We h b é , director of the Wehbé Home for old
people who are ill.
Families are getting poorer and 34 per cent of
the population lives below the pove rty line.
“Women are the people who look after old people
at home,” s ays Sebai.“But more and more of them
h ave outside jobs. In 15 ye a rs time, the situat i o n
will be really critical.” ■
