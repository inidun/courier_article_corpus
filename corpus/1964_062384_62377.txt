THE SCROLLS OF KASR IBRIM
OLLOW the Nile downstream
(northwards) from Abu Simbel
for thirty miles or so and suddenly tower¬
ing 200 feet high into the skyline rises a
rocky, craggy cliff topped by a spread of
ruins. This is Kasr Ibrim, fortress and
cemetery, the stage on which 35 centuries
of history have been played.
Expeditions from the Egypt Exploration
Society (of Great Britain) have been
working here since 1961 and have found
the whole area tremendously rich in
archaeological material of all kinds from
the 18th Dynasty 1570 B.C. down to
doned after the forcible expulsion of the
Mamelukes by Mohamet Ali.
One of the major and most exciting
discoveries has come with the excavation
in 1963-1964 under the direction of J.M.
Plumley, Professor of Egyptology at the
University of Cambridge, of the remains

of a vast Christian Church in fact the
finest ecclesiastical building in all Nubia
and the unearthing of the undisturbed
burial of a 14th-century Christian bishop.
Amongst his clothing were found two
scrolls each 16 feet long, one, in Coptic,
the official notification of the bishop's
consecration in Old Cairo to the combined
See of Faras and Ibrim in Nubia, the other
its counterpart in Arabic. The date of
the scrolls is 1372 A.D.
Up to now it was generally believed
that Christianity in Nubia had been given
its deathblow with the Moslem onslaught
bishop's burial and the scrolls as well as
other finds demonstrate that far from
being exterminated in Nubia, Christianity
survived into the 14th and even the 15th
century.
Other excavations carried out during
the last season at Kasr Ibrim have reco-

vered further archaeological material of
the utmost importance. Of special signi¬
ficance have been the findings of In¬
scribed material in Egyptian hieroglyphs
and Meroitic, the discovery of nine lea¬
ther scrolls written in Old Nubian found
stored away in a pot under the stairway
of a Christian house, and many fragments
of manuscripts In Greek, Coptic, Old Nu¬
bian and Arabic. Among the Old Nubian
manuscripts some which are undoubtedly
letters are of special interest. The 1961
excavations of cemeteries were carried
out under the direction of Professor W.B.
Emery and have added to our knowledge
who inhabited the fortress of Kasr Ibrim
until the latter half of the sixth century
when Christianity swept into Nubia.
Much time will be needed to examine
all the material found thus far at Ibrim.
As Professor Plumley has said, "When
this has been studied it will be possible
to fill in some of the details of 3,500 years
of the successive occupations of the for¬
tress by the Ancient Egyptians, the Meroi-
tes, the X-group people, the Nubian Chris¬
tians, the Bosnians [who came as merce¬
naries in the 16th century and settled
down for three hundred years] and the
ill-starred Mamelukes. It is hoped that
further excavation of the site will be
possible, and that more material will be
recovered to throw fresh light upon the
long history of now vanishing Nubia."
