Intangible cultural heritage is a
technical term used by experts, not by
shamans or musicians. It generally refers
to immaterial aspects of culture—
ephemeral products like stories and
language itself, as well as to the beliefs,
v a l u e s, and forms of knowledge and skill
that give cultures their vitality. Th i s
heritage can, for example, i n c l u d e
wedding dances and funeral laments,
artisans’ skills and orally conveyed
knowledge of farming.
It can even include festivals and
spaces where people gather, such as the
wondrous Djamaa el-Fna square in
Marrakesh.You might find its traces in a
museum—plants used by a traditional
healer, for example—but it is mostly the
living, oral tradition of a people. It is not
culture under glass! 
Japan’s living
national treasures
Scholars have long recognized the
intangibility of culture. In the 18th and
19th centuries philologists, folklorists and
others tried to document the world’s oral
t r a d i t i o n s. Yet the term “ i n t a n g i b l e
cultural heritage”is relatively recent.In
1 9 5 0 , Japan initiated a living national
treasures programme to recognize the
great skills of masters of the traditional
arts.
Similar programmes began in Ko r e a ,
the Philippines, Th a i l a n d , the United
States and France. Intangible heritage is
seen as an asset or resource to be
p r o t e c t e d , a p p r e c i a t e d , utilized and
managed—an idea traceable back to the
Meiji period. In the We s t , m e a n w h i l e,
jurists recognized the idea of intellectual
property as an asset, defining copyright
and patent as putting an idea into material
f o r m .But collective, cultural creation that
was unwritten or unrecorded remained
problematic—it still does.

include natural landscapes, s t i m u l a t e d

P reserving the magic
We can be swept away by a traditional wedding dance or entranced by the poets of a vanishing
language—but defining this intangible cultural heritage is far from simple,
as UNESCO’s efforts to safeguard endangered masterpieces go to show 
The hill of crosses in Lithuania,where cross crafting is a longtime tradition.

expression of ethnicities has turned
violent.
Questions of how best to understand
and respond to intangible cultural
heritage sparked debate among the jury
considering nominations for the
U N E S C O ’s designation as intangible
“ m a s t e r p i e c e s.”Fi r s t , there is the question
of defin i t i o n . A staged performance of
an ancient play may have many tangible
elements—written scripts, a temple
theatre and elaborately crafted costumes.
Yet does the fact that it is a performance
render the tradition intangible? How long
does the cultural practice have to be
around before it is called tradition? Does
it have to be widely shared among a
people? If people alter their practice to
respond to changing circumstances,
should the tradition be seen as a
successful adaptation to be treasured or
as a deprived derivative to be shunned?
As hard as it may be to define this
heritage, the question of its value looms
l a r g e r.To some extent,every language is
a masterpiece.How to weigh the worth of
one language against another in
determining value and significance—by
the number of speakers, its role in history,
the beauty of its poetry? 
But perhaps more difficult is the
question of if and how to preserve the
wide range of this heritage. Is it more
important to safeguard vanishing or
fragile traditions than popular,vital ones?
To preserve the tradition,it is necessary
to preserve the ability of people to
practise it. We might like the look or
sound of the tradition,but its continued
practice would condemn people to labour
with low pay and terrible conditions.
The strategies used also spark debate.
In some cases, intangible cultural heritage
may be viewed as a national treasure
meriting government support, tax breaks,
or subsidies.
Looming 
dangers
This can be positive, but it can also
turn a practice controlled by the
community into an institution controlled
by bureaucrats. In other cases, a ritual
celebration may be seen as an under-
exploited asset prompting commercial
i n v e s t m e n t . This may bring funding
support,but it may also destroy the very
meaning of the tradition, turning it into an
activity staged for tourists. The very
broader thinking about the need to
safeguard intangible cultural heritage.
Meetings of experts ensued,
recommendations were developed and
the technical discussions continued until
they reached a pinnacle in May 2001, w h e n
UN E S C O’s Director-General Ko ï c h i r o
Matsuura proclaimed the first 19
Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible
Heritage of Humanity.
Why so long for this concept to make
it into international consciousness? We l l ,
for one, it has suffered the problem of
vagueness long associated with the term
“ c u l t u r e.” “ H e r i t a g e ” and “ i n t a n g i b l e ”
just compound the difficulty. S e c o n d ,
t h e r e ’s a terminology problem—what to
call it? It is hard to imagine the term
“intangible cultural heritage”sliding off
the tongue of any laureates.
Vagueness and terminology aside,
interest in the subject has grown with
public awareness of globalization.On the
m a c r o - l e v e l , cultural resources, in a
similar way to natural resources, seem to
be endangered or disappearing. Of more
than 6,000 languages still spoken on the
p l a n e t , linguists predict that 50 to 95
percent will not last through the next
c e n t u r y. The great majority are not
written and lack any tangible form.Wh e n
a language dies, there is a startling loss of
knowledge and expression accumulated
over generations.
On the micro-level,many people do
not want to accept a social universe of
homogenized global consumers bereft of
a n c e s t o r s, s t o r i e s, and meaningful
e x p e r i e n c e s.Local cultural reassertion is
a way of saying, “my world may have
become bigger, but I still have a place
within it.” In less benign circumstances,
intangible cultural heritage has captured
the world’s attention when conflict over
the practice of religions and the
recognition of the value of intangible
cultural resources can initiate or
exacerbate conflicts—people within the
society fighting for control over the
t r a d i t i o n , people from the outside
affecting the power balance within.
I m p o r t a n t l y, there is the question of what
is being preserved—is it the tradition
itself as product (for example, the song),
is it the documentary record of the
tradition (the recording), or the people
(singers) and process (the singing)?
Fi n a l l y, there is the issue of who
d e c i d e s. Nations belonging to UN E S C O
must nominate those cultural traditions
for consideration as treasures. M a n y
nominations may be put forth with the
best  intentions, but some might reflect
narrow interests of a group in power.
Some minority traditions may be
overlooked or even censored from
c o n s i d e r a t i o n . Given that many folk
traditions arise as forms of resistance to
national domination, the idea of national
nomination may be flawed.
As member of the jury and an
a n t h r o p o l o g i s t , I was skeptical about the
ability to define and select intangible
cultural treasures and address the many
questions that could be raised about the
concept and its applicability. I still have
my doubts about the particulars. Th e y
will surely be refined as UN E S C O’s
programme evolves.
But I must say that I was impressed
with UN E S C O’s selection of the first 19
“ m a s t e r p i e c e s.” One could take heart
that in the age of globalization, l o c a l
cultures have survived, and sometimes
even flo u r i s h e d . One would appreciate
that in an age of constant innovation,
tradition had some lasting value. Th e
power and tenacity of the selected
traditions and their practitioners was
p a l p a b l e. One can only hope that with
