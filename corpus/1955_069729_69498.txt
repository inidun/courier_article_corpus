When today descendants of the
Incas celebrate the New Year it
is an experience one cannot
easily forget. From every village and
hamlet high up in the Andean Cordil¬
lera down to the fringe of the tropical
forest the Indians of Bolivia and Peru
welcome the day with great merry¬
making.
These festivities, however, are but a
faint echo of the sumptuous ceremonies
of the Imperial Inca Empire of the
past. Those which took place in the
holy city of Cuzco, capital of "the four
corners of the world," have been vividly
described by Garcilaso de la Vega, the
16th century chronicler, who was him¬
self of Inca descent.
these mandones, or leaders, are chosen
by the Indians themselves in a series
of discussions and negotiations to
which white men are not admitted.
The ceremony of their installation has
both religious and secular features, and
is imbued with a grave dignity which
may equally well be Spanish or Indian
in origin.
On January 1 1954, 1 was in the Peru¬
vian village of Juli, on the shores of
Lake Titicaca, which occupies an out¬
standing place in the annals of Span¬
ish-American religious art. A huge
crowd of Indians packed the principal
church, with its gilded baroque mould¬
ings and repellent or blood-stained
statues. The impassive, stern-faced
Attended by the Emperor and all the
provincial governors, a complex ritual,
called Inti raymi, was held in June to
open a new cycle of festivities and
work. It was marked by ceremonies
of revival and purification characteris¬
tic of man's constant attempt to
express in symbols the pendulum swing
from death to resurrection.
What remains of all these sacrifices,
processions and dances? Very little.
Four centuries of wretchedness and
decadence, however, have not entire¬
ly effaced the old customs. And the
New Year, now fixed at January 1, is
one of the occasions when the ghosts
of ancient traditions emerge from the
mists of past history. The day no lon¬
ger marks the opening of the religious
year, and it has lost its seasonal impli¬
cations. But it is of political import¬
ance, for on that day the hilakata,
alcades and campos (local leaders) who
have replaced the ancient Inca officials
are installed in office,
Although nominated by the owners
of the haciendas (ranches) or by the
authorities in the Andean republics,
hilakata, wearing red woollen caps and
ample red ponchos, stood in a double
row, each holding his staff of office a
magnificent silver-knobbed cane, hand¬
ed down from one chief to the next
since Spanish colonial times.
In the half-light of the church rose
the heart-rending sadness of Aymara
Indian chants, accompanied by the
beating of drums and the plaintive
notes of Pan pipes.
Masked men in spangled coats
Groups of masked men were dancing
in the streets. Some of them
wore jaguar masks, others were
decked with condor's wings symbols
of some long-forgotten divinities
combined with the wigs and spangled
coats of 17th cçntury Spain.
That day, I encountered, a strange
procession which suddenly arrived
outside the Yunguyo church where the
Indian authorities were attending
mass. It was led by a horseman, whose
wife rode a little way behind him.
Both were reeling drunk, swaying dan
gerously in the saddle, and would in¬
evitably have fallen to the ground if
their companions had not struggled to
keep them in place. Other horsemen,
accompanied by musicians, rode mer¬
rily into view and vanished, one after
another, into the surrounding houses
from which issued the sound of flutes
and the rolling of drums. These were
the new officials, taking up their duties.
The parade would not have particu¬
larly impressed me, but for their re¬
markable get-up. Their hats and
waistcoats were made of pastry, they
wore rings of bread round their necks
and arms, and similar rings were hung
about their clothes. Bread is a delicacy
for the Indians, so it was as though the
hilakata and alcades
had dressed up as Sug¬
arplum Fairies. Their
appetizing appearance
in the literal sense of
the words at once
reminded me of the
designs on many of the
vases found in ancient
Peruvian tombs. These
depict dancers decked,
not with rolls of bread,
but with various kinds
of fruits and vegetables.
Archaeologists believe
that these scenes illus¬
trate fertility rites an
interpretation thatwould
seem to apply to the
strange dress of the
mandones, who display
these symbols of pros¬
perity to convince the
spectators that bread
will be plentiful during
their terms of office and
that the year that is
beginning will be a happy one.
One New Year's Day in the Andes
was, I think, among the most exciting
in my career as an ethno¬
grapher. It was on January 1 just
twenty years ago, that I reached the
village of the Chipaya Indians. For a
number of years I had been longing to
visit these Indians, who weçe known
only through a booklet written about
them by an amateur archaeologist,
M. Posnansky. Its contents were, how¬
ever, enough to fire the imagination of
a student who hoped to specialize in
the study of the Andean civilizations.
It revealed that in one of the most
remote regions of the Andean plateau,
at an altitude of some 13.000 feet,
beyond sandy deserts and great lagoons
where pink flamingoes congregated,
there was a village whose inhabitants
seemed to have been forgotten by his¬
tory and were living now, well into the
20th century, just äs they had in the
heyday of the Inca Empire. Moreover,
they spoke a language different from
the Quechua and Aymara tongues

which are used almost everywhere in
Bolivia.
In more than one sense the Chipayas
were chullpa puchu mummified re¬
mains. I will not describe my journey
across the sand dunes, my slow pro¬
gress over the desolate plains of the
Chipaya territory. The day I arrived
within sight of the village, the mirage,
frequent at that time of year, had en¬
larged and multiplfed the' huts to a
point where I seemed to be approach¬
ing a strange city beside a great
non-existent lake in which strange,
jagged mountain peaks were reflected.
The promise held out by this optical
illusion was nothing; however, com¬
pared with the thrill I felt on being
surrounded by a group of Chipaya
women.
Imagine the stupefaction of an arch¬
aeologist on finding himself confront¬
ed by mummies who have stripped
off their bandages and dressed them¬
selves once more in the clothes of their
period. The women surrounding me
were dressed exactly like those who
had, four centuries earlier, crowded to
gaze at the conquistador Almagro when
he crossed these same deserts, and they
also resembled the dried-up bodies
found in burial caves.
I was particularly struck by one
detail the tinkling of the little bronze
figures that dangled from the innume¬
rable plaits in which these
women's hair was arranged. (Cont'd on

Living Ghosts
of
the Incas

ornaments be¬
fore in the La
Paz museum,
among the ob¬
jects found in
the great In¬
dian city of
T i ah u anaco,
which flourish¬
ed long before the Incas gained
control of the Andean plateau.
Like their neighbours, the Aymarás,
the Chipayas were holding their New
Year festivities that day. I can still
see the interior of a round hut in
which my friend Mamani, who had
just been elected corregidor (an old
Spanish title) was standing behind a
low table whereon lay a sheep's head.
The Indiansmen and women alike-
filed past to do homage to him,
stretching out their arms with
supplicating gestures. They offered
him two goblets, in accordance with
Inca etiquette, which requires that any
invitation to drink shall be conveyed
in this way. Each of them poured a
libation of alcohol to the sacrificed
animal, and placed an offering of coca
leaves before it. Their duty thus ful¬
filled, they joined the people who were
already dancing in the open space
separating the two clans.
Mournful songs and Pan pipes
They were led by the outgoing al¬
calde, who had tied round his
body a black and white woollen
sling from which little cords hung in
skeins, covering him down to the knees.
He had stuck flowers in his hat, and
from his forehead rose two big leaves,
reminiscent of the metal stems that
topped the headbands of the Inca
chieftains. Waving a white banner and
followed by the dancers and flute
players, he advanced, stopping at each
hut to claim a tribute of chicha (a
fermented drink) for himself and his
band. In exchange he allowed the
host to take over the white banner and
direct the movements of the dancers.
A fertility rite is, however, associated
with these secular rejoicings. On
Christmas Eve the women had placed
little clay models of lamas and sheep
on the altar of the church built by the
villagers. On New Year's Day these
little figures were given back to them.
Handling them with respect, they kis¬
sed them and carried them home,
convinced that their own animals
were thus assured of many offspring.
Far into the night the relentless
silence of the Andean plateau was rent
by the notes of Pan pipes and the
sound of mournful songs; then the
voices died away, to be replaced by an
oppressive calm. The New Year cele¬
brations were over, and in their dark
huts the Indians lay asleep, preparing
to resume the monotonous course of
their cheerless lives.
