Tunisians.
A few months after the work has been done, t h e

and throws them away. In due course an electri c i t y

Once upon a time there was a poor man adri f t
in the solitude of what the Tunisian gove rn m e n t
calls a “twilight zone”—an isolated, poverty-
stricken area. One day President Ben Ali visits the
poor man,promising that soon he will have water,
light and a decent home thanks to “26-26”.This
figure is the postal account number of the Nat i o n a l
S o l i d a rity Fund (FSN) set up at the end of 1992 and

Over 800,000 people have access to medical assis-
t a n c e ; nearly half a million pri m a ry-school stu-
dents receive an allowance eve ry year when they go
back to school after the summer va c at i o n ; and in six
ye a rs the FSN has spent some $350 million on
d e veloping 928 “twilight zones”. There are also
housing and rural and urban development pro-
gr a m m e s.This range of measures was rounded out
in late 1997 by the creation of the Tunisian Solida-
rity Bank (BTS). In 1998 the bank granted low-
interest loans (5 per cent) to 7,300 small bu s i-
nesses. “Now the priority is to stimulate the spirit
of enterp ri s e ,” s ays bank chairman and CEO A b d e l-
latif Saddem.
The gove rnment is doing a gr e at deal.A little too
m u c h , some people say, and not always for the best.
In 1996, a study by the Tunisian research firm
D i r a s s at reported that the vagueness of public assis-
tance allocation guidelines has encouraged cro-
ny i s m .O n e - fifth of the PNAFN’s benefic i a ries live
above the poverty line while the poorest families
swell the waiting lists.According to several accounts,
civil servants in the ministry of the interior and the
cells of the ruling party interfere with the selection
process.
The war on pove rty focuses on the rural areas,bu t
t wo-thirds of Tu n i s i a ’s poor live in the cities. In the sub-
urbs of Tunis for example, H ay Ettadhamen, the lar-
gest of the country ’s 800 squatter settlements, is not
c l a s s i fied as a “twilight zone” e ven though 30 per
cent of the population of the former Islamic funda-
mentalist stronghold lives below the pove rty line.
An opportunity to team up
with civil society
E x p e rts point out a third problem: g ove rn m e n t
p r o grammes could do a better job targeting the
poorest people and urban yo u t h . For example, o n l y
4.8 per cent of the BTS’s debtors are illiterat e — e ve n
though one in three Tunisians can neither read nor
w ri t e . “ Policies to support micro-businesses and
the informal sector in general will be even more
necessary in the future,” says Mahjoub. Especially
since Tunisia has launched a campaign to upgrade
its industrial fa b ric in preparation for implementing
a free-trade accord with the European Union, w h i c h
m ay lead to higher unemployment and lower wa g e s.

of the bills.”
This joke, which is making the rounds in Tu n i s ,
sums up the situation we l l .O f ficials are doing more
and more to help society’s most disadva n t a g e d
members. But much remains to be done to bring
them into economic life and break with seve r a l
decades of paternalism and assistance.
If there is a country where the term “ we l fare stat e ”
means something it is Tu n i s i a .The gove rnment has
a lways pursued a vigorous social policy since inde-
pendence in 1956. At first it was part of President
Habib Bourguiba’s socialist approach. To d ay it is a
pillar of President Zine El Abidine Ben A l i ’s law - a n d -
order policy, which was bolstered after fundamenta-
list Muslims made headway in the late 1980s.“ S o c i a l
stability is a matter of securi t y,” s ays secretary of stat e
Kamel Haj Sassi,who manages the FSN.As a result,
economic liberalization has been accompanied by an
i n t e n s i fied anti-pove rty campaign.
“From 1987 to 1993, in the middle of the adjust-
ment peri o d ,” the World Bank report s , “the gove rn-
m e n t ’s per capita social spending increased by 14 per
cent in real term s.” The results are plain to see.
“Despite the shock of liberalization and ri s i n g
unemployment,” says Tunisian economist Azzam
M a h j o u b ,“the pove rty rate has declined quite signi-
ficantly since 1970, although the drop began slow i n g
down in 1985,especially in the cities.”The United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says
t h at the percentage of people living below the
p ove rty line (approx i m ately a dollar per person per
d ay in cities and half a dollar in the countryside) fell
from 22 per cent in 1975 to 6.2 per cent in 1995.
But the International Labour Organisation (ILO)
also reports that some nine million Tunisians are still
“ v u l n e r a b l e ” . So fa r , social transfers — e q u i valent to
$150 per person per month, according to Mongi
Layeb of the ministry of economic development—
seem to have protected them from the worst.
Tu n i s i a ’s neediest people benefit from an ars e n a l
of measures. Some 112,000 households receive a
d o l l a r - a - d ay allowance from the National Pro-
gramme of Assistance to Needy Families (PNAFN).

with funding, it is appealing to the generosity of Tu n i-
sians via communication campaigns and collections
in companies and gove rnment offic e s. G ove rn m e n t
r e p r e s e n t at i ves say they also want to invo l ve other
s k i l l s , including those of non-gove rnmental organi-
z at i o n s.But development associations are few and fa r
b e t we e n .“They are unprofessional and don’t alway s
get enough encouragement from the authori t i e s ,”
s ays specialist Henda Gafsi.M a ny officials want to keep
control over the population and believe that civil
society initiat i ves are targeted against the stat e .
In Hay Ettadhamen, the independent NGO
Enda Interarabe proves them wrong. The gr o u p
runs a bustling centre called Espace 21, which offers
small loans and a wide range of errands and serv i c e s.
In three ye a rs the centre has financed over 1,000 mic r o -
bu s i n e s s e s , most of them small shops. Despite easy credit
t e rm s , the gove rnment has a hard time recove ring its loans,
but Enda,which lends at 17 per cent,has a 98 per cent reim-
bu rsement rat e .Espace 21 is also a recreational and training
centre for disadvantaged yo u t h . “ M a ny turn down the
training programmes we find for them because they prefer
b e z n e s s and easy money,” s ays director Essma Ben Hamida.
“But after a few months here,” she explains, “ at least they
l e a rn how to live in society by the ru l e s.”
The work of Enda and other organizations show s
that the state “could do better by teaming up with civil
s o c i e t y,” concludes Mahjoub—in other wo r d s , by demo-
cratizing public life. n
