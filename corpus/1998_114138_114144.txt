A two-speed reform

equipped schools offer little choice of cours e s
and that the pupils are divided up according to
social ori gins and gender.The methods of the
teachers have also not changed despite the
r e f o rm s , because of their slender knowledge of
the specialist subjects.
The new educational system is presently
coming in for a lot of cri t i c i s m . T h e
complaints include the hastiness of the
r e f o rms—less than a third of the schools have
wo r k s h o p s — overloaded courses and poor
c a l c u l ation of costs, especially for fa m i l i e s
which are sometimes forced to sell seve r a l
head of cattle to pay for a child’s schooling.
The schools ask parents to supply their
children with all the mat e rials they need to
make the craft items. So education is far from
being free and equal. S t ate schools, e s p e c i a l l y
s e c o n d a ry schools, sometimes demand
r e gi s t r ation fees which are double or eve n
treble the amount set by the ministry of
e d u c at i o n . So good students from poor
families sometimes cannot sign on at the best
schools, while those from wealthier families
but with only average results can.
This double standard is the main cri t i c i s m
of the new educational system.The result is
t h at many pupils and their parents are now
waiting for a reform of the reforms. A . R.n
n The Kenyan gove rnment began an
e d u c ational reform programme in 1985
which substantially altered syllabus content
and educational stru c t u r e s , putting more
emphasis on pre-vo c ational training that
would be useful to pupils as soon as they
finished their schooling.The programme aims
to adapt the educational system to the
c o u n t ry ’s needs, reduce inequalities by
building new schools in poorer regions and,
especially, to solve the problem of those who
find themselves looking for a job without any
vocational training.
Such schooling must instil techniques and
k n owledge which will be useful for the
c o u n t ry ’s development and prepare yo u n g
people to hone their skills in vo c at i o n a l
training institutes or set themselves up as
craftspeople.
Te c h n i c a l , fa rming and artistic subjects
h ave been added to the pri m a ry school
curriculum, which was previously limited to
subjects like English, m at h e m atics and
h i s t o ry. An arts and crafts course teaches
d e s i g n , p a i n t i n g, d e c o r at i o n , p o t t e ry and
working with leat h e r , wood and metal. I t
enables those who drop out of school early to
make use of these practical skills in their
c o m m u n i t i e s , producing tables, c h a i rs ,
baskets and kitchen utensils.
For the past three ye a rs ,s u rveys have been

technical subjects. They show that the least-
