THE International Decade of
Ocean Exploration is one of
many océanographie program¬
mes sponsored by Unesco. Its pur¬
pose is to gain a fuller understanding
of the world's oceans through scien¬
tific research projects. These pro¬
jects are in some cases largely
geological or physical, while in other
cases they seek to better understand
the biology of the sea, including
man's impact on fisheries.
One of the International Decade
projects is the Controlled Ecosystem
Pollution Experiment (CEPEX). This
project is largely financed by the
United States National Science
Foundation, and the principal coun¬
tries involved are U.S.A., U.K. and
Canada.

The purpose of CEPEX is to study
the low level, long-term effects of
pollutants on the marine environ¬
ment. For some time it has been
possible for the chemists to show
that minute traces of potentially harm¬
ful substances such as copper, lead,
pesticides and hydrocarbons, have
been accumulating in the ocean.
What we don't know is whether very
small amounts of these substances
are harmful to marine life.
Firstly, it would be impossible to
test all the organisms in the sea in
order to determine if they reacted to
these low levels of pollutants; and
secondly, the long-term effects of
such slow accumulations of subs¬
tances may not be apparent until .
much later, perhaps by the year 2000,
when it might be too late to do any¬
thing about it.
In order to approach this very diffi¬
cult problem of understanding low
level, chronic effects of pollutants in
the sea, the CEPEX scientists decided
that they had to isolate large bodies
of water in which they could study
the whole biology of any particular
sea area. A similar approach is
These 30-metre-high plastic
tubes (above), submerged
containers each holding over
2,000 tons of sea water,
are floating laboratories in
which scientists are studying
the long-term biological
effects of pollutants.

used by terrestrial ecologists when
they fence off a piece of land to
study it in isolation from other effects.
However, the problem for the ocea-
nographer is that you can't just "fence
off" sea water; finding a container
for large amounts of sea water so
that the sea water inside will remain
a natural environment is a very diffi¬
cult problem. The solution was
found, however, in the form of a
familiar shape to most scientists
the test tube.
The only difference was that the
CEPEX test tubes had to be large
enough to support a whole life sys¬
tem from sunlight to fish; at the same
time the materials had to be strong
enough to withstand ocean waves,
clear enough to permit sunlight to
enter and, above all, made from
non-toxic material since it was the
scientists' aim to add small amounts
of toxic substances to these contai¬
ners in order to understand their
effect on the biology of the oceans.
The test tubes which were made
are capable of holding over 2000 tons
of sea water and they are designed to
float in the sea, thus minimizing struc¬
tural costs as well as replicating as
nearly as possible the natural ocean
environment.
The major site location for these
test tubes is at Saanich Inleta fjord
on the coast of British Columbia,
Canada. Similar structures are being
used by scientists in Loch Ewe, Scot¬
land and in Kieler Bucht, Fed. Rep. of
Germany. At present scientists are
using three of these large test tubes
and six smaller ones in their experi¬
ments.
The results which are being ob¬
tained through CEPEX are quite ex¬
tensive and space would not permit
coverage of this entire programme
here. However, one of the more far-
reaching discoveries concerns the
structure of food chains in the sea
and their possible alteration either by
man or by natural events. In this
respect it has been known for some
time that . the sea may sometimes
produce large numbers of different
kinds of jellyfish (ctenophores and
medusae) and that commercial fish
also fluctuate in their abundance.
A hypothesis now advanced as a
result of work in CEPEX is that there
may be some connexion between
these two events. By studying the
microscopic animals (the Zooplank¬
ton) which in turn feed both .the jelly¬
fish and the young commercial fish,
it has been found that two separate
pathways exist which may either
favour jellyfish production or commer¬
cial fish production.
Stated very simply, it is postulated
that the production of very small
plant cells (flagellates) may lead to
the production of small Zooplankton
and these favour the growth of jelly¬
fish; in contrast the production of
large plant cells (mostly diatoms)
leads to the production of large zoo-
plankton and these animals favour
the growth of young fish.
Obviously from the point of com¬
mercial fisheries it would be disas¬
trous if the commercial fisheries
declined and were replaced by jelly¬
fish ! The question is, what triggers
the food chain of flagellates to jelly¬
fish as opposed to the more useful
large diatom food chain?
The answer to this question seems
to lie in one of several effects.
Through experiments at CEPEX it can
be shown that small flagellate plant
cells are often produced as a result
of low level pollution, especially in
the presence of heavy metals or petro¬
leum hydrocarbons. However, the
food chain favouring flagellates and
jellyfish can also be set up in response
to storms which are natural events.
Thus the hypothesis, if found to be
correct, might explain why jellyfish
become abundant in some years and
not others, due to natural changes
in our weather, as well as suggesting
that the same events could be enhan¬
ced by man's pollution of the ocean
to the detriment of world fisheries.
The CEPEX programme is expected
to last for about ten years and to
eventually involve many more scien¬
tists from other countries.
