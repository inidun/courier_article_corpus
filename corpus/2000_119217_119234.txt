Ten ye a rs ago, the architects of the Jo m t i e n
D e c l a r ation acknowledged that in many set-
tings  governments alone could not be expec-
ted to provide basic education for all.They stressed
t h at new and revitalized part n e rships at all leve l s
were necessary—betweeen governments and non-
g ove rnmental organizat i o n s , the pri vate sector, l o c a l
communities,religious groups and families .
The notion of partnership has a positive ring,
suggesting that the state and its part n e rs work toge-
ther in harm o ny. The reality is much more com-
plex. Partnerships require strong mutual interest,
trust on both sides, and a clear understanding of
roles and objectives. All too common are cases of
w h at Jo m t i e n ’s architects had wa rned against,
namely false part n e rships which, simply put, c o m e
d own to “passing the bu c k ” . The most fla gr a n t
examples have occurred in countries where central
g ove rnments have collapsed, r e n d e ring them
unable to collect taxe s. Whether it be in Chad,
S o m a l i a , Cambodia or Uganda until the early
1 9 9 0 s , communities realized that if they wa n t e d
s c h o o l s , they would have to provide for themselve s.
Studies have shown that in several of these coun-
t ri e s , households and communities have carri e d
between 60 and 90 per cent of the costs of primary
education, which has barred many children from
attending school altogether.
Cost-sharing
In many gove rnment-sponsored schemes,
community financing is seen as an alternative to
direct taxation. However, it is not necessarily pre-
ferable. In progressive systems of taxation, the
rich pay more than the poor, but in many systems
of community financing, the poor bear a heavier
burden than the rich. Communities may also be
given only limited control in schemes sponsored

by donor agencies. In other cases, the state has
been unwilling to relinquish control but has allo-
wed NGOs to flourish and fill the gaps, enabling
a parallel system of schooling to emerge. Pakistan
is a case in point,with over 5,000 NGOs involved
in education.
In some instances,the collapse of the state has
led of necessity to new partnerships,most notably
in the ex-Soviet Union which was formerly charac-
t e rized by a highly centralized system. In Russia
and A z e r b a i j a n , for example, communities have
moved in to maintain at least some of the previous
high standards of education.
In such settings, the economic and political cri-
sis softened the rigid attitudes of the past on both
sides:governments became more interested in the
idea that communities could share some of the
financial burden of schooling, and communities
showed willingness to contribute resources.What
s t a rted with a rather narr ow focus on finance in
many cases broadened to include planning, curri-
culum and other dimensions.
A dialogue between 
school and community
The point is instructive: genuine partnerships
i nvo l ve much more than mere contri bution of
fin a n c e .They are not a simple mechanism to secure
resources and to reduce budgetary crises. Nor are
they necessarily part of decentralization initiat i ve s.
In some settings, c o o r d i n ation and more rat h e r
than less centralization are needed.
The goal of part n e rships should be clearly kept
in mind: to improve pupils’ attendance, retention
and the quality of learn i n g . School boards on which
p a r e n t s ,t e a c h e rs , local officials and other commu-
nity representat i ves have a voice are one of the most
effective tools for giving communities a greater say
in the planning, running and monitoring of 
education.
Some countries do not have school boards; bu t
in others the model has passed the test of time. Fo r
the past thirty ye a rs , Papua New Guinea has pro-
moted in law and in practice the part i c i p ation of
parents and communities on pri m a ry school boards
of management. Communities even have the powe r
to decide on the languages of instruction despite
the fact that the gove rnment meets the major costs
of elementary educat i o n . Community members
commonly join forces with teachers and others to
encourage children’s attendance and punctuality.
Targets cannot all be reached ove rn i g h t , o f
c o u rs e . Parents need to learn about broader policy
i s s u e s , and the teachers need to find out more about
their pupils’ h o m e s. In some countri e s ,r e s o u r c e s
i nvested in school-level and community-level wo r k-
shops have gr e atly improved the effic i e n cy and effec-
t i veness of education systems.They have fa c i l i t at e d
dialogue between the school and the community.
The role of teachers on school boards should
not be underestimated:they tend to hold different
attitudes from central authorities regarding criti-
cal issues such as student drop-out, a major pro-
blem in the developing world. Many teachers see
drop-out (or push-out) as a way of reducing class
size and dealing with troublesome students rather
than a problem. Discussion of these issues during
workshops can change perspectives and attitudes,
and can make the school a friendlier place in
which to learn.
G ove rnments have a major role to play in
m o n i t o r ing and guiding part n e rships with
c o m m u n i t i e s : checks and balances are needed to
ensure that school boards are not autocrat i c,
t h at certain groups of students are not being
d i s c ri m i n ated against on the basis of race,

r e l i gi o n , ethnicity  or gender, and that
c u rriculum standards are met. The challenge is
to strike a balance that safeguards the rights of
children while not stifling local initiat i ve .
One final word of wa rn i n g : community part-
n e rships almost inevitably invo l ve resource contri-
butions of some nat u r e , in the form of fees and/or
other levies. Opposition to fees has deep roots in
va rious intern ational declarat i o n s , and debate on
the issue tends to be polari z e d . E d u c ation is of
c o u rse never free: somebody has to pay. S i g n i fi-
c a n t l y, the 1990 Jomtien Declaration observed that
fee-free education provided by gove rnment alone is
often of an insufficient quality to benefit the indivi-
dual child, the community or the country.
The World Bank,in a 1999 policy report, went
f u rt h e r , s t ating that “in pri n c i p l e , fees and other
c o n t ri butions paid by non-poor benefic i a ries could
free up public resources for targeting to the poor.”
Rather than flatly condemning fees, we would do
better to sensitize school boards to the needs of the
p o o r , and find eve ry mechanism possible to pro-
tect them. In this endeavour, once again,the state
has a pivotal role to play in promoting genuine part-
n e rships with communities that serve , first and 
foremost,the child. ■
