HE phrase "less developed
countries" is used to refer to almost
100 nations, poor in money income but
diverse in culture, economic condition,
and social and political structure.
Consequently, the first implication of
concern for their development is
recognition of their immense diversity.
For example:
Low-income countries include India
with 530 million people, South Korea
with 30 million, Costa Rica with
1.5 million, and Gabon with 500,000.
India has 17 states, the largest with
more people than any European
country; Gabon has fewer people than
a single borough of London.
Large size entails complex problems
of administration and political cohesion
as well as large markets and potential
economies of scale; small countries
often present a significantly different
picture, with problems centering on
limited markets, shortages of skills,
and weak bargaining power.
Population is growing rapidly in
most of the developing countries, but
there are great differences in social
and economic problems where there
are 1,200 people per square mile, as
in East Pakistan, as opposed to where
there are 26, as in Brazil. Where new
lands can be opened up, at whatever
cost, the psychology is not the same
as where fixed amounts of land are
subdivided into ever less adequate
parcels.
The political systems of the
developing countries range from fully
participatory democracy through one-
party systems to dictatorships. The
private sector is heavily relied upon in
some economies, and the public
sector in others, with a majority of
economies somewhere in between,
except for public utilities and heavy
industries which are usually owned by
the state.
As political consciousness increases
and economic power is diversified,
traditional values give way to new
patterns of behaviour, reflected in an
even richer kaleidoscope of political
patterns and economic policies.
The diversity among value systems
in low-income countries is at least as
great as in the industrialized world.
Some societies are as old as the
Mexican or Indian; some were only
recently freed from colonialism; some
are committed to rapid industrialization
while others have yet to chart a clear
economic course; some societies have
no choice but to devote most of their
energies to composing racial and
tribal differences to achieve viable
statehood. Neither the acquisition of
wealth nor the regimentation of the
machine are universally admired or
accepted.
The capacity to absorb political and
economic change also varies widely,
with the social flexibility, the colonial
history, the reservoir of skilled
manpower, and a host of other
variables. The administrative capacity
essential for coping with change is
greater in Latin America and Asia than
in Africa. However, even when there
is good administrative capacity, as in
the Asian subcontinent, it may prove
unable to move from traditional law
and order functions to promotion of
change without loss of efficiency.
There are also great variations in
income level and economic potential.
Argentina has an income of more than
$780 per head, India about $90 and
several countries less than $60. Most
of the people in some countries live
on the brink of subsistence, while in
others the minimum amenities are, or
can be, assured.
There are similarly vast differences
in economic structure. There are
many economies which place heavy
reliance on foreign trade, but also a
few, like India, which depend only
marginally on trade. Such countries
as Zambia and Venezuela have large
mineral sectors; a few, such as Hong
Kong and Mexico, have substantial
industrial sectors; but the great
majority are overwhelmingly dependent
on agriculture.
There are equally sharp differences
in patterns of ownership and income
distribution. Economic potential is, of
course, difficult to assess accurately;
discoveries of oil reserves, gas fields,
or new uses for old metals continue to
prove earlier forecasts fallacious.
Still, given our present knowledge,
Turkey is reasonably well endowed
with raw materials and a temperate
climate Chad is not. India has all
the physical resources of a great
power some countries hardly seem
to have the basic requisites for
national survival.
Thus development problems are
vastly different from country to
country. National objectives are
determined by past experiences and
by cultural and political history, filtered
perhaps imperfectly through the rulers'
desires.

Latin America's income per head has
grown substantially since 1945, slightly
exceeding the average growth rates
for Africa and South Asia.
Manufacturing has been the most
rapidly growing sector, expanding
by an annual average of 6 per cent for
the region as a whole. Right, nylon

KALEIDOSCOPE OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT (Continued)
The role of governments may be
widespread or minimal. They may
inherit extensive or negligible infra¬
structure and administrative skills;
their people may be politically unstable
or mature; they may have a tradition
of thrift and industriousness, or they
may still need to build these traits.
Despite this diversity, a common
purpose emerges in nearly every
country: to reduce poverty; to ensure
minimum levels of education, health,
housing, and food to every citizen; to
increase control over nature by the
nation and the individual; to broaden
the opportunity for choice.
The balance of the past has
been upset in many ways by new
desires, reduced mortality rates, new
technology and the material objectives
find new expressions as they merge
with old and varied cultures. One
would not expect the ascendancy of
new aspirations to be a smooth or
silent process, and it has not been.
In most countries development has
resulted only through constant struggle
between modernizing and traditional
elements.
22
LESS than twenty years
ago, much technology, some patience,
and a great deal of money were thought
to combine all the ingredients for over¬
coming poverty. Most colonial powers
believed that their colonies for many
developing countries were not yet
independent would need decades
of assistance before they had the
economic and administrative capacity
for statehood. Talk of rapid progress
after independence was considered
visionary.
In the developing countries, on the
other hand, elimination of colonial
rule was almost everywhere seen as
opening the way to early prosperity.
The nature of the obstacles that
colonialism imposed were, naturally,
seen differently in different countries.
To some it was a system that kept
them producing agricultural products
and minerals while denying them the
benefits of industrialization; to others
its most objectionable element was
its protection of foreign industrial
undertakings, which could, after
independence, be nationalized or
compelled by regulations to conform
to national interests.
Of course, concern about un¬
favourable conditions of foreign
demand for traditional agricultural
products was not limited to newly
independent developing countries, nor
were there no similarities between
the general postures of low-income
countries on matters of economic
policy.
Most such countries emphasized
domestic, import-substituting industry
as both politically necessary and
economically desirable; most believed
In direct governmental action and
ownership of industry as an essential
ingredient of national planning and
income redistribution; and most gener¬
ally ignored the importance to growth
of increases in general productivity.
Economic development was often
seen at first as something undertaken
by the elite for the masses; the need
to engage the energies of the people
was hardly considered important even
where in theory their participation was
considered desirable. Market forces,
private ownership, and profit were
often distrusted in part because they
were associated with the spread of
colonialism, in part because the ruling
groups came from the military or
administrative elite. Those who were
concerned to distribute income more
equitably had no experience of
taxation, public expenditures, and
generalized incentives as instruments
of policy.
The role of government in promoting
development was often misinterpreted.
Particularly in the former colonial
areas it was seen as an extension of
the centralized, control-oriented colo¬
nial rule. Few fully appreciated the
human resources needed for rapid
growth, the growing pressure for
social services, particularly in towns,
the importance of more and better
education and better health facilities.
The donor countries also exhibited
imperfect understanding of these
problems. The former colonial powers
continued financial and technical
assistance to the newly independent
states, and some assistance began to
flow from other donors, but develop¬
ment did not become an important
focus of assistance until the latter part
of the 1950s.
Initially, it was assumed that
technical assistance to transfer skills
and technology and commercial types
of financing was adequate. Even
where soft loans or grants were
available, e.g., from the United States,
there was little understanding of the
scale of problem being addressed, the
magnitude of the necessary social and
political change, or the time it would
take. Nor were the impact of trade
policy or the terms of assistance given
much thought.
u NDERSTANDING of de¬
velopment and its effect on the total
economy and society has gradually
improved, but only in this decade has
the improved understanding found
expression in policy. The process is
still far from complete.
These oversimplifications led both
industrial and low-income countries to
overemphasize aid flows and per
capita GNP (Gross National Product)
growth, a habit which is only slowly
giving way to the realization that the
impact of aid flows on GNP depends
largely on the efficiency with which
the recipient uses domestic resources
and on the over-all economic and

social policies which he pursues.
These policies have other goals
e.g., equality of personal or regional
income distribution, or investment in
education and social services which
sometimes must be met at the expense
of a lower rate of growth. There also
is an increasing understanding that aid
flows may be offset, or growth limited,
by unfavourable international trade
and monetary policies.
Past approaches are gradually being
modified by the experience of two
decades.
Many developing countries now
recognize that the economy must be
more outward-looking; that export
earnings, not aid, must be the principal
source of foreign exchange.
It is also increasingly clear that the

agricultural sector, which contains
most of the people, is capable of rapid
growth and that promoting growth in
this sector is necessary to create
demand for domestic industries, to
provide industrial raw materials, and
to fuel the drive for greater exports.
Even in the countries most committed
to public ownership, increasing
attention is now being paid to
mobilizing and allocating resources
through individual incentives and
initiative. The public sector retains
its generally broad responsibility in
utilities, transport, natural resources,
and basic industries, but there is a
greater willingness to work through
the market and use profit incentives,
within constraints dictated by social
and political objectives.
Industrialized countries, on the other
hand, increasingly understand that the
framework for development in today's
developing countries Is immensely
different from that In Europe and
North America during the Industrial
Revolution. Few cared then about
urban slums, child labour, poor
working conditions, and abysmal
wages. Who does not care now?
Political consciousness has created
demands for public services and
equitable income distribution which did
not occur in the industrialized coun¬
tries until a much higher level of in¬
come and productivity had been
reached.
The demographic situation is also
very different and imposes high costs.
The equilibrium between deaths and
births has been disturbed abruptly and
has accelerated population growth
rates while migration to new lands is
severely restricted.
Finally, the very technology which
the developing countries inherit, and
which makes rapid growth possible,
also brings problems e.g., manpower
training, maintenance, and a very
much higher capital cost per worker
which the industrial countries were
able to solve gradually. Educated to
some extent by their attempts to
eliminate the vestiges of poverty in
their own societies, industrialized
countries are beginning to understand
the social and political complexities of
development.
Most important, they now understand
that there is no single strategy or

KALEIDOSCOPE (Continued)
universal prescription for development
which is valid In all countries at all
times; many combinations of policies
and priorities are both possible and
necessary.
Some, but by no means all, of this
new awareness has been reflected in
the aid programmes by which donors
give meaning to their concern for the
fate of the poorer countries. External
assistance has been vital in many
countries to alleviate shortages of
skills, to make possible higher rates of
savings and investment, to improve
social services, and to accelerate, the
rate of growth.
But aid has also served a second
critical purpose. When provided in
proper ways, it has afforded low-
income countries some of the flexibi¬
lity necessary to undertake such bold
policy changes as devaluation and
liberalization of restrictions on imports.
(Of course, the failure of aid to grow
in recent years has made it more and
more difficult to mobilize adequate
support for significant policy change
in countries where a lack of foreign
exchange has been the first constraint
on growth.)
|N Africa, where foreign
exchange is not yet the major
constraint, the volume of aid and the
aid relationship nevertheless play an
important role in economic policy
formulation.
Even where the importance of local
efforts and policies has been recog¬
nized, however, discussions between
donors and recipients have often been
less than satisfactory. Sometimes
joint analysis of the problem has led
to effective joint action, but often
commitment to development is lacking
on one side or on both or is
misinterpreted.
Problems range from the unwilling¬
ness of recipients to interfere with
vested interests to donor refusal to
assist potentially competitive sectors
or to open their markets to new
products. Often, too, donor and
recipient differ about the importance
or political sensitivity of an act, or the
speed with which there is a likelihood
of it being accomplished.
Finally, political priorities of both
recipients and donors are often
indefinite and certainly changeable.
Recipient countries have received
conflicting policy advice from different
donors, or from the same institution in
different years. Their priorities are
subject to the normal political press¬
ures, and settling and acting on them
is difficult.
Thus, while attention has been
successfully focused on development
policies and the support they require,
the mechanism for implementing a
joint analysis is still, with some notable
exceptions, far from adequate.
