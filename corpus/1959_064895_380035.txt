For just over one month in 1957
the nine Portuguese islands call¬
ed the Azores, a group 400 miles
long, almost midway between
North America and Europe, be¬
came ten. On September 28 a
submarine eruption took place
just off the island of Fayal and
a volcano emerged from the sea
about 400 yards from the light¬
house of Punta dos Capelinhos.
Its apparition had been prefaced
by slight earth tremors followed
by a violent shock which damag¬
ed the village of Cápelo and
spread panic among the inhabi¬
tants. At the same moment the
sea began to boil, flames and
vapours rose from it and soon a
fierce column of smoke and
cinders shot high into the air.
On October 7, a sudden change
in wind direction carried a rain
of ash and cinders onto the island
of Fayal and partially buried the
now deserted village of Capelo.
Three weeks after it first appear¬
ed the crater of llha Nova
(New Island), shaped like a
horseshoe and giving off a dense
cloud of smoke, vapour and cin¬
ders, had risen over 600 feet
above the waves. (Photos on
these pages show the progres¬
sive stages in the growth of llha
Nova.) After some three weeks
the eruption began to die down
and finally ceased on October
29. The sea made short workof
the cinders forming the cone öf
llha Nova and within a few days
there remained only a wave-
swept rock, shrouded by the
wisps of vapour rising from the
site of the former crater. The va¬
garies of submarine volcanoes
are responsible for the appear¬
ance of such short-lived islands,
which have varying lifetimes
though rarely longer than a few
months. Some disappear only
to reappear once or even several
timesatlaterdates. "Disappear¬
ing islands" of this type have
often given rise to diplomatic
claims by nations seeking to in¬
crease their overseas territories.

BIRTH OF AN ISLAND (Continued)

CHOKED BY A RAIN
OF BURNING CINDERS
Shortly after It emerged from the sea, the volcano of llha
Nova began to shower clouds of dust and cinders on the
nearby Island of Fayal. Great submarine explosions which
rocked the new volcano (left) sent tremendous showers
of debris high into the air from where it was blown inland
by the wind. Houses, crops and pasture land were covered
by a thick layer of cinders, under whose weight roofs caved
in (below). Thousands of acres of land were covered under
debris to a depth of several yards through which streams
fed by torrential rains carved out deep fissures (above),
innumerable fish choked by cinders were washed ashore.
