The Second World War was nearly over when thé United
Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO)
convened in San Francisco on 25 April 1945 to complete the
work, started long before, of drawing up the Charter of the
United Nations. This Charter was signed by heads of delega-
tions on 26 June with the understanding that it woult corne into
effect (and that the organization would officiallly corne into
existence) when it had been ratified by China, France, the
United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics and by a majority of the other
signatory States. This condition was met on 24 October which
is therefore the birthday of the United Nations, celebrated as
United Nations Day. Opposite page, brief extracts from three
addresses given at the final plenary session of the Conference.

The San Francisco
Conference

President Harry S. Truman (1884-1972)
speaking at the 16th plenary session of the
San Francisco Conference, on 26 June
194'
Andrei Gromyko, then Soviet ambassador
to the United States, signs the Charter.
" (,.,) That we now have this Charter at ail
is a great wonder. It is also a cause for
profound thanksgiving to Almighty God,
who has brought us so far in our search
for peace through wor) d organization.
There were many who doubted that
agreement could ever be reached by
these fifty countries differing so much in
race and religion, in language and cul-
ture. But these differences were ait for-
gotten in one unshakable unity of deter-
mination-to find a way to end war. Out
of aM the arguments and disputes, and
different points of view, a way was found
to agrée. Here in the spotlight of full
publicity, in the tradition ofliberty-toving
people, opinions were expressed openly
and freely. The faith and hope of fifty
peaceful nations were laid before this
world forum. Differences were over-
come. This Charter was not the work of
any single nation or group of nations,
large or smala, It was the reluit of a spirit
of give and take, of tolerance for the
views and interests of others. It was proof
that nations, like men, can state their
differences, can face them, and then can
find common ground on which to stand.
That is the essence of democracy ; and
that is the essence of keeping the peace in
the future. By your agreement, the way
was shown toward future agreement in
the years to corne (..,)"
Harry S, Truman
President of the United States of America
" (..,) The small nations, who have dis-
played in this Conference a great sense of
responsibility, noble co-operation and
dignity, are destined to fulfil a great mis-
sion : to tend with devotion and courage
the sacred fire of Law. They will not be
alone in this luminous task, for the com-
mon men of aïï nations, great and small,
hold the same aspirations and have the
same faith in a common destiny.
Whenever the cause of justice will raise
its banner, the peoples, great and small,
shall cry with the same conviction, shall
act with the same strength (...) Our faith
must rest, not on the great or the small
nations, but upon the common men of ail
nations. A) t peopies, large and smalt,
fully know that the world cannot bear the
terrible stress of another total war with-
out turning back to the dark âges. There
is, therefore, a peremptory necessity to
live in peace. Let us have reciprocal con-
fidence, let us have the full measure of
our goodwill (..,)"
The Honourable Ezequiel Padilla
Chairman of the Delegation of Mexico
" (...) In the course of the work of the
Conference there were some difficulties
and differences of view between separate
delegations on these or other questions.
However, one should be surprised not at
the existence of these difficulties and not
at the existence of different viewpoints
between separate delegations on these or
other questions, but at the fact that, as a
result of the work of the Conference, ail
the main difficulties were overcome, and
we succeeded in fulfilling successfully the
tasks before the Conférence. We pre-
pared a document which should become
the basis for the actions of the Interna-
tional Organization-its constitution.
Naturally, the very best and most perfect
Charter in itself is not yet a guarantee that
its provisions will be carried out and en-
sure the preservation of peace. In order
to achieve this important and noble task it
is also necessary, in addition to the ex-
isting Charter, to have the unity and co-
ordination of actions of members of the
International Organization, and first of
an the unity and co-ordination of actions
between the most powerful military
powers in the world. It is also necessary
that aU members of the International
Organization should try to settle aU dis-
putes by peaceful means in the spirit of
co-operation and goodwill (..,)"
The Honourable Andrei Gromyko
Acting Chairman of the Delegation of the
USSR
The Mexican jurist Ezequiel Padilla (1892-
1971), Ministerof Foreign Relations (1940-
1945).
