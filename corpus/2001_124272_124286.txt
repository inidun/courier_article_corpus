W
hen sociologist Saadeddin Ibrahim was
sentenced to seven years in prison in
May 2001, a round of shock reverbe-
rated through Egyptian civil society.
The government has always upheld
its right to suppress political Islamists even as they
appease social conservatives by cracking down on the
heterodox fringe. I b r a h i m ,6 3 , did not fit either of these
e x t r e m e s. An internationally respected scholar, h i s
seminal research on the social origins of militant Islamist
groups appears to have had a major impact on the
g o v e r n m e n t ’s strategy for fighting them.In the 1990s,t h e
sociologist was given a prime-time TV spot to address the
nation on confronting extremism. He had close ties to
the first lady,Suzanne Mubarak,and wrote articles in the
state-owned press.
Unlike many state-sponsored scholars, h o w e v e r,
Ibrahim never tempered his views on the regime. H e
openly discussed the problems of Egypt’s Christian
“ m i n o r i t y ”(the very use of that word violates nationalist
taboos because the Egyptian state considers the Copts an
integrated part of the nation) and was critical of the
Arab world’s lack of democracy.One theory attributes his
downfall to his coining of the word “ G o m l u k i y a ”( R e p u-
blarchy) to refer to Arab states where the presidency is
handed from father to son.
In May 2000, I b r a h i m ’s Ibn Khaldoun Centre for
Development Studies was raided. He and 27 of his col-
leagues were arrested and eventually charged with  “ t a r-
nishing the reputation of the state”and “accepting foreign
funding without permission”as well as embezzling money
from his donors and bribing state television offic i a l s.Th e
investigators showed particular interest in a programme
to monitor parliamentary elections scheduled that fall.
Ibrahim was given one final chance. In September
2 0 0 0 ,according to one of his lawyers,he was released on
the understanding that if he kept quiet,the charges would
be dropped.I n s t e a d ,he continued to speak out about his
case and announced that he would continue to monitor
the elections. Four days later formal charges were fil e d
against him.
Uneven support
During the four-month trial that opened in
November 2000, the prosecution denounced Ibrahim in
speeches laced with flowery rhetoric. “Given its role in
the region it is not surprising that Egypt should be the
subject of defamation,” said chief prosecutor Sameh
S e i f,“but what is cause for wonder is that it comes from
w i t h i n , from those who share our lives yet leave only
harm and pain in their wake.”The sociologist was labelled
a “ s w i n d l e r ”and a “genius at deception,”who concocted
false reports about Egypt and sold them abroad. Th e
defense argued,among other points, that any number of
organizations accepted foreign funding and published
reports that could be considered critical of the state.
Ibrahim was convicted on three of four counts (he was
acquitted of the bribery charge) and sentenced to seven
years in prison;six of his co-defendants received two- or
five-year sentences,and the 21 others received one-year
suspended sentences.
Because of Ibrahim’s extensive connections abroad,
and his dual Egyptian-American nationality, the Egyp-
tian regime faced a rash of harsh editorials after the
c o n v i c t i o n . Th e Washington Po s t asked the U. S. t o
remember the verdict when Egypt’s aid package came
up for review.Although some of Ibrahim’s fellow aca-
demics have rallied to his defense,the majority has not.
According to former diplomat and political writer Hus-
sein A m i n ,“this is mostly due to envy. He is considered
t h e foremost Egyptian intellectual by the We s t . H e ’s
made a lot of money and gets invited to many semi-
n a r s.” Throughout the trial, the local press was more
interested in playing up his alleged treason than defen-
ding his freedom of expression.
Some of Ibrahim’s colleagues expect him to be
released this winter.He is reportedly in poor health. Th e
fate of his co-defendants is unsure.For now,I b r a h i m ’s case
stands as a warning to fellow academics.According to a
joint statement by Amnesty International and Human
Rights Wa t c h , the trial  “falls in the context of a number
of blows intended to muzzle civil society in Egypt.” ■
