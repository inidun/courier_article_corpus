“The intern ational community must treat
human rights globally in a fair and equal
m a n n e r , on the same footing and with the
same emphasis.”The June 1993 United Nations Wo r l d
Conference in Vienna added one more resolution to the
long list adopted over the ye a rs when
it reminded the signat o ry states of
the Unive rsal Declaration of their
duty to guarantee economic, s o c i a l
and cultural ri g h t s — f o o d , s h e l t e r ,
wo r k ,health and education—just as
much as civil and political ri g h t s —
f r e e d o m , s e c u rity and justice. T h e
i n i t i at i ve was critical because economic, social and
cultural rights have always been sidelined for histori c a l
and ideological reasons.
In the 1950s the debate raged over drafting a
c ovenant that would gi ve the Declaration legal force.
René Cassin of France favoured a single document,
but the We s t e rn and Communist blocs were opposed.
The We s t e rn countries emphasized political rights while
the Eastern bloc,backed by several developing nat i o n s ,
g ave pri o rity to economic ri g h t s.
A compromise was reached in 1966, when two
c ovenants were drawn up—one on civil and political
ri g h t s , to go into effect immediat e l y, another on
e c o n o m i c, social and cultural ri g h t s , which wo u l d
gradually enter into force and has so far been rat i fie d
by 137 countries.
The Intern ational Covenant on Economic, S o c i a l



Poor relations
As the gap between rich and poor widens, the
have-nots are demanding more respect for
economic and social rights, which are often
given short shrift
and Cultural Rights stipulates that “each Stat e . . .
u n d e rtakes to take steps. . . to the maximum of its
available resources,with a view to achieving progr e s s i ve l y
the full realization of the rights recognized....”
G ove rn m e n t s ,especially in the developing wo r l d ,o f t e n
take advantage of the ambiguous wording to justify
their non-observance of the treat y,s ays Philippe Te x i e r ,
the French expert on the United Nations Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights set up in
1 9 8 5 .Most countries ignore it,he adds.
Texier, a legal expert, recommends an optional
protocol that,like the one on political rights, would
empower the committee to review complaints from
individuals or gr o u p s. But he admits that “ r e s p e c t
for political rights,such as a ban on torture,is easier
to ve rify than, for example, respect for the right to
be decently housed.”
Committee chairman Philip Alston of Australia
says,“it is essential that such a procedure be created
in order to provide the opportunity for the
d e velopment of some juri s p rudence relating to
e c o n o m i c, social and cultural ri g h t s. In the continuing
absence of such juri s p ru d e n c e , the second-class stat u s
of those rights will inevitably be maintained.”
M a ribel Wo l f, the United Nations representat i ve
of the French non-gove rnmental organization Te rre des
H o m m e s , s ays that “the purpose of being able to
process such complaints is not so much to possibly
impose sanctions but to have the opportunity to
publicly expose violations of economic ri g h t s.”
“ G ove rnments don’t like that ,”she say s ,and indeed
they seem to show scant interest in the proposal.So fa r
only six countries have responded to the draft protocol
produced by the committee. Fo u r
of them—Cypru s , S y ri a , F i n l a n d
and Ecuador—are fairly or ve ry
much in favo u r , while two —
G e rm a ny and Canada—have
expressed doubts.
“Since the gove rnments of the ri c h
c o u n t ries have abdicated their
responsibilities and hidden behind the excuse of the
market economy, and elites in the deve l o p i n g
countries refuse to redistribute wealth,it’s the job of
civil society to defend these rights,” says Wolf.
She is cheered by Amnesty Intern at i o n a l ’s recent
though small shift in that direction.Until now the human
rights watchdog has pri m a rily focused on individual
f r e e d o m s.We a ry of feeling “looked down upon” b y
political rights expert s ,Wolf claims the label “ h u m a n
rights activist” just as strongly as they do.
“We must stop thinking of political rights as an
entitlement while economic and social rights are a
mere premise or a utopian dream,” says Colombian
l aw yer and human rights expert A l i rio Uribe Munoz.
The fate of every individual’s economic, social and
cultural rights depends on it. n
