THE GARDEN
OF THE VIRGIN
by Christine Quenon
According to legend, after the Res¬
urrection, the Virgin Mary and St.
John the Evangelist set sail for
Cyprus to visit Lazarus. During the
\ oyagc they were caught in a violent
storm and their ship was cast onto
the eastern shore of Mount Athos.
Captivated by the beauty of the
place, Mary prayed to her son and
asked him to grant her sovereignty
over the mountain. A heavenly voice
replied, saying, "May this place he
yours, may it he your garden and
your paradise and a haven of peace
for all those who seek salvation."
This is why the monks called Mount
Athos "The Carden of the Virgin",
and the Greeks called it "Ilagios
0,-os"the "Holy Mountain".
In the Middle Ages a charter
issued by the Byzantine emperor
defined the rules of monastic life,
which have changed little since
then. The Virgin Mary is the only-

female presence. Only men are
allowed to live on the Holy Moun¬
tain. Since the 1920s, Mount Athos
has been a theocratic republic
which enjoys a certain amount of
autonomy within the Creek state. It
is comprised of twenty monaster¬
ies. This number is immutable.
CHURCHES, TREASURES AND
LIBRARIES
The monasteries of Mount Athos are
usually girdled by a fortified outer
wall. Each one has a central church,
or kutholikon in many cases a
medieval Byzantine church painted
red on the outside and surrounded
by dependencies. The interior of the
church, as at Vatopedi monastery, is
decorated with frescoes, icons and
mosaics. The monastery usually
houses a treasury which the monks
are reluctant to show visitors and
which may contain reliquaries, icons
and cult objects like the 14th-cen¬
tury jasper, silver gilt and enamel
chalice, a masterpiece of Byzantine
craftsmanship, preserved at Vato¬
pedi Monastery, and Emperor
Nicephorus II Phocas's vestments,
which are kept in one of the penin¬
sula's most beautiful monasteries,
the Great Lavra. The monastic,
libraries are often rich in ancient man¬
uscripts, some dating from the 4th
century. The Creat Lavra library, for
example, contains more than 2,000
manuscripts and 5,000 volumes.
To fully appreciate the beauty
of these monasteries, which blend
harmoniously into the beautifully
preserved landscape, it is best to
approach them from the sea. Some,
like the monasteries of St. Grego-
riou, Vatopedi and St. Panteleimon,
are located on the shore. Others, like
Dionysiou, the Great Lavra, St. Paul
and Simonopetra, perch on hilltops or
rocky outcrops. With its jumble of
roofs, towers, bell-towers and crenel-
Iations each monastery is a village.
Small white buildings with wooden
balconies cling to high, monumental
walls.
APLACE
OF SANCTUARY
The monasteries are divided into two
groups. In the cenobitic monaster¬
ies, governed by a single rule, every¬
thing is done in common: the monks
live under the same roof, join in the
same prayers throughout the day
and night, share meals and work, and
have no personal possessions. In what
are know n as "idiorrhy tlnnic" monas¬
teries each monk lives at his "own
rhythm", owns his own cell, is not
obliged to do any communal work
and can freely use any income he
may have. For the monks in these
monasteries sharing is limited to liv¬
ing under the same roof and attend¬
ing certain services together.
Other forms of religious life on
Mount Athos fall outside these two
major categories and include
anchorites, hermits who live alone in
secluded cells or in groups of two or
three in remote houses with their
own chapels, and gyrovagues itin¬
erant, mendicant monks.
The Athonite monks use the
Julian calendar, and their day
begins at sunset, not midnight. The
bell that signals the start of a day of
prayer and work is tolled at one
o'clock in the morning.
The monks come from all over the
Orthodox world. After a period of
decadence, monastic life is today
experiencing a renaissance and
attracting new vocations. The
Athonite school is also open to young
men who do not wish to make a life¬
long commitment to the monastic life.
Many of the monasteries are under¬
going major restoration work. The
monks and anchori tes w ho li\ e in this
sanctuary are keeping alive the con¬
templative tradition of the Orthodox
Church. H
