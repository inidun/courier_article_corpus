A STARTLING PICTURE
A CENTURY FROM TODAY
World population growth cannot possibly stop
before at least a century, the U.N. says
llVEN enough time, reduced
family size will probably become a
universal achievement. But at present,
and for some time to come, there are
also a number of conflicting factors
making it impossible to reduce high
birth rates at once.
Multitudes of people living in
extreme misery are unable to believe
that any sustained behaviour can even¬
tually ease their condition. In many
farming communities where children
are put to work early, they are still
considered, quite rationally, as eco¬
nomic assets. For good economic
reasons, the governments of many
countries, some of them having a
small or sparse population, favour a
population growth which can still be
advantageous to national development.
In the more developed regions, quite
low fertility is already an accomplished
fact. Here, the United Nations projec¬
tions make only a single assumption,
namely, that fertility at a bare repla¬
cement level will be reached fairly
soon, though not immediately and not
simultaneously in every region.
In the less developed regions, many
contradictory arguments can have vali¬
dity, so that there remains a wide
scope for equally reasonable assump¬
tions as to the path which may be
followed by future fertility trends. In
one respect all assumptions agree :
sooner or later fertility will reach the
net replacement level and then fluc¬
tuate about that level. They differ only
as regards the timing and the speed
of the intervening decline. The re¬
sulting " high " and " low " population
projections will be considered further
on. Meanwhile, the discussion is
confined to the " medium " projection
variant.
To appreciate what is implied in the
" medium " variant of the projections,
the reader may wish to take note of
the approximate time by which a rather
low level of fertility is assumed to be
reached in each of eight major areas
of the world. Listed below are the
assumed dates when the gross repro¬
duction rate is charted to fall below
1.10 (i.e. fertility becomes less than
2.25 children per woman) in each of
the eight world areas:
Northern Tier
North America 	 about 2005
Europe 	 » 2000
Soviet Union 	 » 2015
East Asia » 2005
Southern Tier
Latin America 	 » 2030
Africa 	 » 2040
South Asia 	 » 2025
Oceania » 2020
It does not follow that population
growth becomes negligible immedi¬
ately thereafter. Depending on earlier
trends in fertility, there can be a more
or less sizeable proportion of the popu¬
lation at young adult ages boosting the
crude birth rate (the annual number of
live births per 1,000 people) and de¬
pressing the crude death rate (the
annual number of deaths per 1,000
people) thereby causing further popu¬
lation increases. Stabilization can set
in only later on, when the entire age
structure has been sufficiently trans¬
formed.
Those concerned with, or alarmed
by, the impending population increases
may derive some comfort from the
probable fact that the highest rates of
population growth lie in the near future
if not already in the recent past. In
each of the eight major areas of the
world the fastest increases are calcu¬
lated to occur within the present half-
century. When the next century begins
growth will already be slower. The
periods of the peak growth rate, and
the rates of natural increase then
attained, are listed below for each of
the eight world areas:
Northern Tier Date per ® Jqq
North America 	 1955-60 15.6
Europe 	 1950-55 8.8
Soviet Union 	 1955-60 17.6

Africa 	 1985-90 30.0
South Asia 	 1970-75 28.1

Though the peak rate of growth may
already be passed, the amounts of
population increase can continue to
rise because the population base to
which the diminishing growth rates
apply still goes on augmenting. Listed
below are the eight major world areas
according to the five-year period when
population increase reaches its largest
absolute amount. Like South Asia,
the entire world population is also
calculated to grow by the largest
amount during 2010-15 when the yearly
addition will total 110 million.

A STARTLING PICTURE (Continued)
Having quickly surveyed the recent
and projected population dynamics in
different world areas, we are perhaps
prepared to accept that the potential
for population growth is far greater in
the southern tier of world regions than
in the north.
South Asia, previously of smaller
population than East Asia, will increas¬
ingly surpass it because of its greater
growth momentum. In fact, the popu¬
lation of South Asia is projected to
soar by huge amounts, and by the
middle of the next century it may sur¬
pass the total world population of
today. But South Asia grows from a
population base which is already large.
Speedier growth is likely to occur else¬
where. High growth rates, sustained
over a longer period, are foreseen
especially for Africa and Latin America.
The populations of North America
and the Soviet Union have already
been surpassed by these two conti¬
nents, despite their own appreciable
rates of growth. In both North
America and the Soviet Union growth
is calculated to abate in the coming
decades, and the. two populations may
remain of nearly equal size for a long
time to come. In this comparison,
Europe seems to grow rather slowly.
But even Europe may reach in the
coming century a population size
double that of 1925.
Confining our attention to the future
only, we may say that between 1975
and 2075 the population of Europe may
grow by another half and those of
North America, the Soviet Union and
East Asia may double. Meanwhile
in Oceania growth may be two-and-a-
half-fold, in South Asia almost fourfold,
in Latin America almost five-fold, and
in Africa nearly sixfold.
Past and anticipated future growth
differ so much between the northern
and the southern tier of world areas
that an entire century can be envisaged
during which the speed of growth in
the south exceeds the maximum ever
attained in the north. The fastest
growth of the north may have already
occurred during 1950-1975, when the
annual rate averaged 1.4 per cent.
Rates higher than this level may prevail
in the south during all quarter-centuries
from 1925 to 2025.
One consequence of such different
rates of growth is a large displacement
southward of the centre of gravity of
world population. Three-fifths of man¬
kind inhabited the northern regions in
1925, and still about one-half in 1975;
in the coming century, the share of the
north is apt to dwindle to one-third if
not less. In 1925, one in every six
persons in the world was a European,
whereas in 2075 it may be only one
in every seventeen.
Roughly the opposite occurs in the
case of Africa, rising from a small
fraction to a considerable proportion
of the world's population. (See table
top p. 30.) If the meteoric rise in the
economic needs of the southern
portions of humanity is to be met, not
only economic development but also

This goblet-shaped diagram, prepared by the "Unesco Courier" on the
basis of United Nations demographic projections, illustrates the growth
of world population betweenthe years 1960 and 2075 on a scale and with
a speed unprecedented in human history. The almost exponential curve
forms the bowl of the goblet. The width of the goblet represents the total world population. Note the sharp
difference between population growth in the 1850-1960 period (stem of goblet) and the years following. A
further constant growth period is apparent after the year 2075. The diagram shows eight major world areas
along with their populations and indicates the year when the population in each will cease growing (around
the year 21 20 for Africa, with 2,338 million inhabitants; around 2070 for Europe, with 698 million inhabitants).

the development of science and tech¬
nology will have to include efforts to
make more efficient use of resources
in warm and tropical climates.
Another aspect of population distri¬
bution is its relationship to land area.
For instance, in 1975 Europe is still the
most densely inhabited major area,
with 97 persons per square kilometre
of land. In the second half of the
coming century, density is apt to
become nearly as great in Latin Ame¬
rica and Africa, whereas South Asia,
is likely to become, the majority in
each region. The urbanization level
surpassed fifty per cent since about
1920 in North America and Oceania,
about 1930 in Europe, about 1960 in
the Soviet Union, and about 1965 in
Latin America. It is projected to reach
fifty per cent about 1995 in East Asia,
about 2015 in Africa and about 2025
in South Asia.
The estimated amounts of urban
population show that the number of
urban dwellers in the world has grown

with perhaps 240 persons per square
kilometre, is likely to become the most
densely settled major area of the
world. (See table bottom of page.)
Next to its accelerated growth, the
most dramatic change now happening
to the world's population is its rapid
urbanization. Throughout history and
until fairly recently, most of the people
have resided in rural places. Now
already in some regions, and soon in
most others, the majority of the popu¬
lation will be urban.
The trend seems irreversible at this
time, and profound changes in modes
of living, thinking and feeling are
associated with it. One may be
tempted to foresee a future world that
will be totally urban. Nevertheless
even this phenomenon can reach an
eventual limit. Perhaps in the more
distant future the settlement pattern
will crystallize in new forms for which
our present concepts furnish no mean¬
ingful description.
Little more than one-fifth of the
world's population was urban in 1925.
The urban proportion in the world total
now approaches two-fifths, may exceed
one-half by the century's end, and can
rise to two-thirds about fifty years from
now. In North America, Europe,
the Soviet Union and Latin America, it
will then be the overwhelming majority.
It is of interest to note at what time
the urban population has become, or
almost fourfold from 1925 to 197*5
(405 million to 1,585 million) and that
it may again grow almost fourfold from
1975 to 2025 (to 6,029 million). In the
fifty years which have passed, the
urban population nearly doubled in
Europe, grew threefold in North
America and Oceania, fivefold in the
Soviet Union, sixfold in East Asia,
nearly sevenfold in South Asia, and
about eightfold in Latin America and
Africa.
In the fifty years to follow, the urban
population of Europe may grow by
four-fifths, those of North America,
the Soviet Union and Oceania may
more than double, in East Asia the
urban population may grow fourfold,
in Latin America almost fivefold, in
South Asia almost sixfold, and in
Africa eightfold. The figures are con¬
trolled in part by anticipated growth in
total population and in part also by the
eventual exhaustion of the rural popu¬
lation whence migrants originate and
where new towns come into existence.
In 1925 two-fifths of the world's
urban population was still to be found
in Europe. Though it has doubled, at
the present time Europe's urban popu¬
lation is approximately equalled by
those of East Asia and South Asia. In
the future, perhaps one-half of the
world's urban population will be shared
by East and South Asia. Latin America
and Africa may then have larger urban
populations than Europe despite the
continued growth of the latter. (See
table ¿op opposite page.)
In many regions overall population
gains are so massive that, despite an
enormous growth in the size and
number of cities, the rural population
keeps on augmenting. This is no
longer the casé in North America,
Europe and the Soviet Union where the
rural population has passed its peak,
is already decreasing, and may
decrease more decidedly in the
decades to come. (See table bottom
opposite page.)
The long-range projections make it
appear likely that in other parts of the
world the rural population will also,
sooner or later, reach a maximum and
then grow no further. This may occur
by 1985 in East Asia, by the year 2010
in Latin America, by 2020 in Oceania,
and perhaps as late as 2030 in Africa.

in the future, however, are of quite
diverse orders of magnitude. The past
peak populations in the rural localities
of North America, Europe and the
Soviet Union were of the order of 60,
180 and 145 million, respectively. In
Latin America the maximum may be
reached with 172 million, in Africa
with 594 million, in East Asia with
689 million, and in South Asia with
1,732 million. The last-mentioned
figure is some 700 million larger than
the present one and it is difficult to
foresee how such an enlarged rural
population will be productively em¬
ployed.
The worried reader may seek solace
from the fact that the projections
merely result from assumptions maue1
rather arbitrarily. The future is likely
to prove that none of the assumptions
has been quite right. In fact, the
projections discussed so far represent
only a "medium" variant which, in our
present view, is perhaps the most
probable. But the "high and "low"
variants calculated as its companions
are still considered to lie within a
range which cannot be ruled out as
improbable. Outside this scheme of
three plausible variants some other
alternatives have also been computed.
One alternative, namely, the main¬
tenance of fertility levels recently
recorded in each region into an inde¬
finite future, must be ruled out as quite
impossible. If mortality diminishes as
already assumed, but fertility remains
unchanged, the total world population
would reach 7,843 million in 2000, and
it would exceed 17,000 million in 2025,
40,000 million in 2050 and 100,000
million in 2075. Even then it would
continue to grow with breath taking
speed.
Science-fiction may enable us to
envisage some future planet, remote
either in time or space, supporting
100,000 million human beings in health,
assuming that in the interim there have
been carried into effect truly astound¬
ing transformations in technology and
social organization. Perhaps genetic
mutations would be necessary for
adaptation to such a totally altered
environment. The year 2075 is decid¬
edly too early for such cosmic achieve¬
ment. Constant fertility throughout
the next hundred years would certainly
provoke disaster.
But it is equally certain that high
fertility rates cannot be at once
reduced to less than half their present
levels. A projection has, in fact, been
calculated where mortality will decline
as already assumed, but where fertility
is suddenly cut down to net replace¬
ment level beginning with the year
1970. In this projection, owing to the
time needed for the adjustment of age
structure, the world's population would
still rise to 5,796 million by the year
2075, less than one-half of the over
12,000 million figure foreseen in the
"medium" variant.
Coming closer to reality, the crux
of the problem is how to envisage the
timing and speed of those fertility
reductions which must inevitably come
about. There is much pertinent know¬
ledge derived from past trends in at
least some parts of the world, and
from studies of the circumstances
under whose influence such downward
trends have been set into motion.
But, as already said, there exist two
types of factors, some of which can
precipitate fertility decline while others
retard it. The net result, in terms of
actual fertility decrease, depends on
how soon, and how strongly the first
set of factors will prevail over the
second. The reader will appreciate
that our area of uncertainty remains
wide.
We expect that government pro¬
grammes aiming in that direction will
achieve at least some measure of
success. We are also aware of other
well established trends, such as more
widespread education, more frequent
survival of children to adolescence,
increased circulation of mass communi¬
cation media, intensifying urbanization,
and so forth, and these will also play
their part.
It is still useful to ponder the poss¬
ible consequences of a more dismal
assumption concerning mortality. In
fact, during the 1960s progress in the
postponement of death has been less
rapid in most parts of the world than
it had been during the 1950s. One
interesting, though admittedly very
pessimistic (and quite improbable)
assumption to make is that after 1970
mortality decline has been permanently
arrested.
A detailed projection of this type
has not yet been calculated, but it can
be reasonably expected that in the
presently more developed regions
constant mortality at the recent level
would not take away much from pro¬
jected population growth because mor¬
tality is already quite low. In some of
the less developed regions, population
growth will be more significantly slow¬
ed down if, which we do not believe,
health levels should remain as they
now are.
Finally, it remains justifiable to give
thought to the possibility of severe
reversals in the affairs of man, provok¬
ing catastrophic events which exact a
huge loss of lives. There is no deny¬
ing that great tragedy can overtake us
at any moment. But no basis can be
found for estimating either its timing
or its extent.
It is emphasized here that all the
international efforts directed at the
preservation of peace, the assertion of
human rights, the stimulation of econo¬
mic and social progress, the protection
of the environment, and relief measures
in cases of local disaster, are aimed
precisely at the avoidance of any
extensive reversal. As a guide to
responsible action, therefore, we can
only take into account such projections
In which the contemplation of admit¬
tedly possible, cataclysmic break¬
downs plays no part.
