Most of us regard 
psychoanalysis as 
a revolutionary disco-
very of 20th century 
civilization and place 
it on the same footing 
as genetics or the 
theory of  relativity. 
Others, probably more 
consc ious of  the 
abuses of psychoana-
lysis than of the real 
lesson it has to teach 
us, still look upon it 
as one of the absurdities of 
modern man. In both cases, we 
overlook the fact that, psychoa-
nalysis has simply rediscovered 
and expressed in new terms an 
approach to mental illness which 
probably dates back to the ear-
liest days of mankind and which 
the so-called primitive peoples 
have always used, often with a 
skill that amazes our foremost 
practitioners. 
A few years ago, Swedish eth-
nologists recorded and published 
a long healing ritual used among 
the Cuna Indians of Panama in 
cases of difficult childbirth. In 
the ritual, the tribe’s witch-doc-
tor or shaman stands before the 
suffering mother and begins a 
chant-recitation, explaining that 
her ailment is due to the tempo-
rary absence of the soul which 
controls procreation. The Cuna

While in Europe the mentally ill were shackled, some primitive societies treated them 
using methods much resembling psychoanalysis, explains Lévi-Strauss in the July-August 
1956 Courier article, where he draws parallels between shamanistic rituals and modern 
psychotherapies.
Claude Lévi-Strauss
Indians believe in the existence 
of a multitude of souls, each of 
which has charge of some parti-
cular functions in life. In this 
particular case, the soul has been 
kidnapped and has been carried 
away to the other world by some 
evil spirits. 
The witch-doctor tells 
the expectant mother 
that he is setting out on 
a supernatural quest for 
the lost spirit. With a rare 
luxury of detail he descri-
bes the obstacles he 
meets and the enemies he 
has to face, how he over-
comes them by force or 
guile before reaching the 
prison of the captive soul. 
Then he releases the soul 
and induces it to resume 
control of the suffering 
body lying at its side.
Witch-doctor 
cures, precursors 
of psychoanalysis
This cure (we have no reason 
to suppose it is not success-
ful at least in certain cases) 
is interesting for a number 
of reasons. Firstly, it is 
purely psychological; no 
drugs are used nor is the 
body of the patient touched. 
The witch doctor simply 
recites or chants, relying on 
speech alone to effect his cure. 
Secondly, two people must parti-
cipate in the treatment – doctor 
and patient – although, as we 
shall see in a moment, this does 
not mean that other members of 
the community may not be pre-
sent.  …

Claude Lévi-Strauss among the Bororo, in Brazil (1935-1939).

… Of the two persons, the 
witch-doctor, whose powers are 
recognized by the whole tribe, 
embodies social authority and 
order, while the other – the 
patient – suffers from what we 
should call a physiological disor-
der, but which the Indians attri-
bute to an advantage gained by 
the spirit world over the human 
world. Since these two worlds 
should normally be allied, and 
since the spirit world is of the 
same nature as the souls pos-
sessed by the individual, the pro-
blem as the Indians see 
it, really stems from a 
sociological disturbance 
caused by the ambition, 
ill-will or resentment of 
the spirits that is by 
both psychological and 
social factors. 
In descr ibing the 
causes of the ailment 
and recount ing his 
adventures in the other 
world, the witch-doctor 
conjures up for his lis-
teners familiar pictures 
drawn from the beliefs 
and myths which are the common 
heritage of the whole community. 
Since the cures are conducted in 
public, the adolescents of the 
tribe witness them and thus gain 
a detailed knowledge of the tri-
be’s beliefs. 
Several of the characteristics 
described are strangely reminis-
cent of psychoanalytical treat-
ment. Here too, il lness is 
considered of psychological origin 
and the treatment applied is 
exclusively psychological. Because 
of symptoms which he is unable 
to control, or more simply because 
he is suffering from mental stress, 
the patient feels cut off from the 
community and calls in the doctor 
whose authority is recognized by 
the group, to help him regain his 
place in society. The treatment 
seeks to induce the patient to 
describe events buried in his sub-
conscious mind but which, despite 
the passage of time, still govern 
his feelings and attitude to life. 
Now there are events or stories 
that have their origin in so dis-
tant a past that the very recollec-
tion of them has been lost, yet, 
better than more recent events, 
they permit us to understand the 
nature of thing occurring today. 
These stories are what sociolo-
gists call “myths”, and it would be 
difficult to give a better defini-
tion to the word.
Converging and 
diverging aspects
The main difference between the 
medicine man’s treatment (as in 
the example of the pregnant 
mother above) and treatment by 
psychoanalysts is that in the first 
case it is the doctor who does the 
talking while in the second it is 
the patient. A good psychoana-
lyst we know says hardly a word 
during most of the treatment; his 
role is to offer the patient a sti-
mulus (one might almost say pro-
vocation) which the presence of 
another person provides, so that 
the patient can vent all his pent-
up aggressive emotions on this 
anonymous “other person”. 
In both cases the creation of a 
myth is part of the treatment. The 
difference is that with 
the Cuna the myth is 
ready-made, familiar to 
everyone and perpetua-
ted by tradition, the 
witch-doctor merely 
adapting it to each 
individual case. 
In the childbir th 
case, for example, the 
witch-doctor translates 
the myth into terms 
that are meaningful to 
the mother. This per-
mits her to name, then 
understand and perhaps 
thereby dominate the anxieties 
which until then she had been 
totally incapable of expressing in 
any form. 
In psychoanalysis, however, 
the patient elaborates his own 
myth. When we stop to think 
about it the difference is not so 
great since psychoanalysis reduces 
the cause of psychological disor-
ders to a very small number of 
possible situations from which the 
patient can choose, but do little 
more. All of them deal with the 
patient’s earliest experiences in 
life and his relationship  …

As Dr Stewart 
observes in this 
connexion, this 
takes us beyond 
psychoanalysis to 
one of its most 
recent develop-
ment s, namely, 
group psychothe-
rapy. One of its 
most familiar forms 
is the psychodrama 
in which several 
members of the 
group impersonate 
the characters in 
the patient’s myth in order to 
assist him to see more clearly and 
thus bring the tragedy to an end. 
This is possible only if the 
patient’s myth itself is social in 
character. Other individuals can 
play a part in it because it is their 
own myth too, or to put it ano-
ther way, because the critical 
situation in which individuals are 
liable to find themselves in our 
society are broadly speaking, the 
same for all.  …
… with his 
family as a child. 
Here too, a state of 
release is reached 
when the anxieties 
which the patient 
could not express or 
dared not admit are 
at least translated 
into terms of a myth 
f its his particular 
story. 
To reassure psy-
choanalysts and their 
followers, let me 
make it clear at once that, in 
using the word “myth”, I am in no 
way implying that the story in 
question is either untrue or inven-
ted. Many myths are based on real 
occurrences but as I already have 
indicated, what makes a myth 
depends not so much on how 
accurately it reflects the original 
story or event but its capacity to 
give meaning to the present. 
Thus it is not surprising to dis-
cover that skilled psychoanalysts 
who have visited primitive socie-
ties to carry out enquiries with the 
most up-to-date methods of inves-
tigation, have found themselves to 
be on a footing of equality with 
the medicine man, and in some 
cases have even  acknowledged the 
latter’s superiority.
This was the experience of Dr 
Kilton Stewart, an American psy-
chologist who has given us a 
 delightful account of it in his 
book, Pygmies and Dream Giants 
[New York, 1954]. He had set off 
for the interior of the Philippines 
to study the mental make-up of 
the extremely primitive pygmy 
tr ibes called Negr itos. His 
methods closely resembled those 
of psychoanalysts. The witch-doc-
tors not only allowed him to do as 
he wished, but immediately accep-
ted him as one of them; in fact, 
regarding themselves as specia-
lists with a thorough knowledge 
of the techniques employed, they 
insisted on helping him in his stu-
dies. Dr Stewart considers that in 
certain respects their psychothe-
rapy is even ahead of ours. 
I have already mentioned that 
the treatment administered by the 
shaman is given in public. Thus, 
all the members of the community 
gradually acquire the beliefs that 
any disorders from which they 
themselves may eventually suffer 
can be treated by the same 
methods they have so often seen 
used. Furthermore, since they 
know all the stages of the treat-
ment in advance, they are all 
ready and willing to take part in it 
punctuating it with words of 
encouragement, helping the 
patient to marshal his memories, 
and displaying an infectious 
enthusiasm as the patient reco-
vers from his disorder.

chiatry in many respects, how far 
ahead it must have been not so 
long ago (traditions die so hard 
with us) when we knew no other 
means of treating mental patients 
than to shackle them and starve 
them! 
advantage, a social superiority 
comparable with that which we 
see in the creative spirit. 
This connexion between an 
abnormal psychological balance 
and creative art is not of course 
unknown in our own theories. We 
have treated many geniuses, such 
as Gerard de Nerval, van Gogh and 
others, as psychotics. At best, we 
are sometimes prepared to pardon 
certain follies because they are 
committed by great artist. But 
even the poor Negritos in the jun-
gles of Bataan are far ahead of us 
in this respect, for they have reali-
zed that one means of remedying a 
mental disorder, harmful both to 
the individual suffering from it and 
to the community which needs the 
healthy co-operation of all, is to 
transform it into a work of art. This 
is a method seldom used among 
us, though it is to it that we owe 
the work of such artist as Utrillo. 
We have much to learn, there-
fore, from primitive psychiatry. 
Still in advance of our own psy-
… We thus see how 
deceptive to think that the 
forgotten events which psy-
choanalysts helps the patient 
to bring back to mind, are 
something private and perso-
nal. Even that dif ference 
between psychoanalysis and 
shamanistic treatments, thus 
disappears. 
“As in Paris and in Vienna”, 
wr ites Dr Stewar t, “the 
Negrito therapists were hel-
ping the patient to contact 
patterns and incidents from a 
long-forgotten past, painful 
incidents buried deep in the 
early time-layers of the accu-
mulated experience which made 
up the personality.”
Turn mental disorder  
into creative talent
In one respect, at least, the pri-
mitive system seems to be more 
daring and more efficacious than 
our own. Dr Stewart describes an 
experience he might have had 
anywhere in the world, among any 
of the peoples we like to call pri-
mitive. When he was about to 
rouse a patient from the waking 
dream in which he was giving a 
haphazard account of incidents in 
his past life – conflict with his 
father transposed into myth-form 
of a visit to the country of the 
dead – his Negrito colleagues 
stopped him. To be definitely 
cured, they said, the spirit of the 
sickness must bestow a gift on its 
victim in the form of a new drum 
beat, a dance or a song. According 
to tribal theory, it is not enough 
to remove the social inferiority 
attributable to the illness: it must 
be transformed into a positive
