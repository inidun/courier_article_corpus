G e r m a n y : two histories re u n i t e d
It’s taken several years, but students across the country are now learning a common
version of history that takes stock of everyday life and dissident movements
in the former East Germany
he shock of unification reached class-
rooms in the “ n e w ” Länder (states) of
former East Germany as the 1991 school
year began. Germany was united once
a g a i n . But not its school curriculum.As a
r e s u l t , the West German version was
i m p o s e d . East German history textbooks
were rejected because they faithfully
r e flected the ideology of the fallen regime.
“The publishers quickly brought out
new books,” says Falk Pingel, d e p u t y
director of the Georg-Eckert Institute
for International Textbook Research (see
previous pages).“But they were just new
editions of the ones written in the West in
the 1980s, with an added chapter on reu-
n i fic a t i o n . It wasn’t at all representative of
the idea East Germans had of their own
h i s t o r y.The repressive nature of the Com-
munist regime was emphasized, a l o n g
with East Germany’s membership of the
Soviet bloc.R e u n i fication was presented
as a positive thing, without mentioning
the dashed hopes of those from the East.”
Looking back
without nostalgia
In the space of a year, teachers in the
East had to switch to a very different ver-
sion of history. “Many of them didn’t
know how to explain to their pupils why
y e s t e r d a y ’s truths no longer held today,”
says Andrea Schwärmer, who had taught
history in the eastern state of Th ü r i n g e n .
“ Those teachers lost all credibility and
had to resign themselves to leaving the
profession.”
In the mid-1990s, the education minis-
ters of the Eastern states, who were in
charge of supervising the curriculum
under the federal system, began to push
for change. “Many teachers in the East
requested that we come up with a less
biased textbook and we did in 1995,” s a y s
Walther Funken, head of Volk und
Wi s s e n , the largest textbook publisher in
the Eastern states, based in Berlin.0nce
tied to the Communist regime, the publi-
sher was taken over in 1994 by Cornelsen,
a West German publisher.
“It wasn’t a matter of writing a text-
book for people who were nostalgic for
life in the old East Germany,” s a y s
F u n k e n , “but of presenting in a more
subtle way all the aspects of East German
society through individual portraits. For
example, one chapter compares the dif-
ferent roles of women in East and West
German societies, noting the large
number of them in the East’s workforce
and the political and historical reasons
why women in the West tend to stay
home.”
Last year, the state of Brandenburg
o f ficially revised its history curriculum
for the first time since 1991.More space
is given to daily life in East Germany, t h e
Nazi period and the Holocaust, a com-
parison between Nazism and Stalinism, a s
well as how citizens’ movements helped
bring down the Communist regime.
Sparking debate
“In the East,” says Pingel,“National
Socialism was depicted as a perversion of
the capitalist system. It was obviously not
compared to Stalinism and very little was
said about the concentration camps and
their victims. Dissident movements
weren’t mentioned either.”
The vast majority of German histo-
rians now agree on a common version of
the history of East Germany, says Pingel.
Because the new generations have not
lived the history being taught to them,
“the textbooks discuss the rise of the 1989
citizens’ movements and use a range of
sources and accounts to show how young
East Germans experienced reunific a t i o n .
This open way of teaching doesn’t present
a single truth, but various points of view,”
he says.“It seeks to  encourage debate in
the classroom.” ■
