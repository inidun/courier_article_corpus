Discipline, order and commitment are values that Glenwood School in Illinois (USA) seeks to inculcate in its pupils, many of whom come
from troubled backgrounds. Below, 14 boys being punished in a corridor.
d a ry school teachers in both pri vate and stat e
s e c t o rs are being confronted with examples
of bad behaviour—the destruction of school
equipment or furn i t u r e ,p u p i l s ’ lack of res-
pect for each other or for adults—which
impede normal school routine.
B e rnard Charlot, professor of educat i o n
at the Unive rsity of St. D e n i s , near Pa ri s ,
s ays there are four kinds of misbehav i o u r.
F i rs t , real violence, i nvolving “ p hy s i c a l
attacks or serious injury, which would be
punished in a court of law.”Then there is
u n ru l i n e s s , “a disrespect for school ru l e s ,”
and ru d e n e s s , “breaches of good manners ,
like slamming a door in the face of a teacher
or fellow pupil.”The fourth kind of indis-
cipline—just as seri o u s , he says—is “ s o m e-
times ostentatious indifference by pupils
which is increasingly stressful for teachers.”

In the past few ye a rs , k i l l i n g s ,p hy s i c a l
at t a c k s , r o b b e ri e s , attempted arson and
fights between children that end in tragedy
h ave become headline news.With the appea-
rance of security guards, police checks and
metal detectors , the most “ d i f fic u l t ”s c h o o l s

incredulous eyes of the public and bu rn e d

UNRULY CLASSROOMS
Charlot cites the cases of pupils who say
they ought not to be punished for absen-
teeism because “since they aren’t there they
d o n ’t do anybody any harm ” or those who
sit right at the back of the classroom doing
w h at they like and when asked to take part
in the lesson say “But sir, we aren’t bothe-
ring yo u .”
Visiting a school staff room and asking
the teachers about their pupils means lis-
tening to a litany of complaints about dis-
r e s p e c t , insults and vandalism and realizing
w h at little back-up teachers have to help
them keep order.

Teachers are not getting enough training and back-up to help them with worsening
behaviour in schools

c h e r. Because I’m yo u n g, they think they can
t r e at me like one of their pals,” s ays 31-ye a r -
old Garri d o,who has seven ye a rs ’e x p e ri e n c e
teaching children between 14 and 20. S h e
s ays the teacher must set the rules from the
ve ry first day and “ k n ow how to keep a dis-
tance so they know yo u ’re the teacher and
not just a chum.”
In Mexico or Italy, in Germ a ny or India,
teacher training, when it exists, focuses on
the curri c u l u m . No one says that lessons will
be gi ven to classes which are often too big
and comprise pupils who, as in Spain for
e x a m p l e ,m ay witness during the school ye a r
an average of 8,000 crimes and 200,000 acts
of violence on television.
But Alfredo Furlán, an Argentine edu-
c at i o n i s t ,s ays that “although the subjects of
discipline and indiscipline are ve ry rarely if
e ver tackled during teacher training, t r a i n e e
t e a c h e rs soon learn their strat e gic impor-
t a n c e .Keeping order in the classroom is the
first professional skill they will have to
d e m o n s t r ate because if they don’t ,c o n fli c t s
i m m e d i ately arise which have wo rse conse-
quences than failing to get good academic
results from their pupils.”
The causes of bad behaviour are extre-
mely dive rs e . Some studies make a distinc-
tion between “ s t ru c t u r a l ” fa c t o rs such as the
inevitable conflicts between teenagers and
adults who try to educate them and fa c t o rs
t h at are more specific to the age we live in.
G u s t avo Calotti, who teaches languages
at a secondary school in Mayotte in the
Comoros Islands and has 15 ye a rs ’t e a c h i n g
e x p e ri e n c e , s ays today ’s schoolchildren 
are “much more badly-behave d ” than their
we r e n ’t allowed in or were expelled, a n d
classrooms were quiet because the discipli-
ne was strict enough to ensure that pupils 
d i d n ’t break the ru l e s.”
Charlot admits that “these days yo u ’r e
getting children in school whose parents or
elder siblings have had no secondary edu-
c at i o n , and the moment the school system
s t a rts taking in a new cat e g o ry of children,
some of the unspoken rules don’t work any
m o r e . Pupils don’t turn up with the ‘ p r e -
s o c i a l i z at i o n ’ they used to get and this show s
up in their behav i o u r.”
A social microcosm
A school is not like a lone soap bu b b l e
s e p a r ate from society, but a place where
social problems are seen in a microcosm—
problems like lack of communicat i o n ,p ove r-
t y, m a r gi n a l i z at i o n , intolerance and loss of
va l u e s. All of them lead to what A n t o n i o
García Corr e a ,professor of educational psy-
chology at the Unive rsity of Murcia, i n
S p a i n , calls “emotional illiteracy ” . E d u-
c ational systems, he say s ,“ h ave been more
c o n c e rned about filling heads with know-
ledge rather than teaching children to think
and reason.A lot of research has been done
on children’s academic results and how to
i m p r ove them, but we have been less
c o n c e rned about their social and emotional
d e ve l o p m e n t .The result is that pupils know
more but behave wo rs e .”
Changes in educational systems also
h ave a lot to do with children’s behav i o u r.
“ We ’ ve switched suddenly from a system
based on prohibitions and punishment to
one based on sharing where the most impor-
p r e d e c e s s o rs 10 or 15 ye a rs ago. He thinks
one reason is that “ young people look at 
the adult world and see what ’s in store for
them when they leave school—a strong pos-
sibility being that they either wo n ’t find a 
job or else end up in one that is badly paid.
They gradually lose the desire to make an
e f f o rt or feel the sat i s faction of completing
a job of wo r k . Add to that the widespread
belief that only those with a winner’s 
mentality will make it and you get a kind
of don’t-care at t t i t u d e , an apat hy which is
r e flected in their behav i o u r.”
UN E S C O e d u c ation specialist A l e x a n d r a
Draxler does not see bad behaviour as a
plague or isolated phenomenon but as “a by-
product of the tremendous advance in indi-
vidual rights and the broad democrat i z at i o n
of public life over the last 25 to 30 ye a rs.”
Before that , she say s , “social problems stop-
ped at the school gat e s.The situation wa s
s o rted out beforehand: violent pupils just

“Although the subjects
of discipline and indiscipline
are very rarely if ever ta c k l e d
during teacher training, tra i n e e
teachers soon learn their
s t rategic importance. Ke e p i n g
order in the classroom is
the first professional skill they
will have to demonstra t e . ”

tant thing is agreement between eve ryo n e
i nvo l ved in the education system and we ’ ve
not yet learned how to put that new system
into practice,” s ays Nora Rais, who teaches
l i t e r ature in Pat a g o n i a ,A r g e n t i n a . She say s
t h at “ r e t u rning to an authori t a rian regi m e
i sn ’t the way to fix the situat i o n . E n c o u r-
a ging dialogue, making compromises and
adopting values is one possible way.Te a-
c h e rs must act as mediat o rs , but we must
have the resources to do that.”
The parents’ role
The schoolteacher is no longer someo-
ne held up as an example to others , and edu-
c ation is no longer a guarantee of social
a d va n c e m e n t . But the school remains a vital
i n s t i t u t i o n , along with the fa m i l y, for encou-
r a ging and instilling human values in yo u n g
people. Many professionals blame parents
for not pulling their weight here by being
often only interested in their children’s aca-
demic results and getting them into the next
school year.
“ Parents are spending less and less time
on their children’s educat i o n ,” s ays Calot-
t i . “They think it’s enough to pack them off
to school and they don’t make a distinction
b e t ween the academic education we gi ve
children and their education as members of
society, which has to begin at home.”
But teachers are less and less alone in
the face of danger. A glance at the educa-
tional plans of several countries shows that
tackling these problems is a pri o rity in desi-
gning policies for inve s t i g at i n g, h a n d l i n g
and preventing bad behaviour (see box ) .
The responses are starting to appear on the
h o ri z o n , although eve ryone agrees that the
more resources a school has, the fewer pro-
blems it will fa c e . Boosting resources will
a l l ow more teachers to be hired, enable class
sizes to be reduced, good administration to
be established and the number of teaching
aids and non-teaching staff to be increased,
introducing key figures such as psycholo-
gists and social workers into the school.
An educational priority
The one thing teachers increasingly
a gree on—and they, after all, are the people
who work day after day in the classroom—
is that the answer is not to punish or expel
pupils or to send them to the head teacher’s
o f fic e . Civil behaviour and sociability are
not values that can be instilled ove rn i g h t .
They are the fruit of a daily effort by eve-
ryone—the authori t i e s , the educat i o n a l
c o m m u n i t y, the parents and of course the
most important people, the children.T h e
rounded academic and social education of
future generations depends on recognizing
t h i s.” n

”In the past few years fights between children that end in tragedy have become headline news.”
