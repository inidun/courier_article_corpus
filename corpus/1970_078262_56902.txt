{7 the end of the meeting
on human aggressiveness, Dr. David
Hamburg weighed up man's chances
for adapting, and summed up what he
and his colleagues had concluded
about the basis for both individual and
group aggressiveness and the likeli¬
hood of doing something about it.
His opening premise was optimistic:
"Aggressive customs, though built on a
biological base, can be modified, but
not easily. If aggressiveness is then
reduced, other types of constructive
activity become possible." This is
a task for education, which, said
Dr. Hamburg, "must teach not only
that violence is bad but that there are
other ways of coping with problems
In an emotionally-charged situation."
He said that the discussions had
brought out four major categories of
situations leading to individual aggress¬
iveness: a clear and present danger to
survival; frustration of self-esteem; a
threat to close personal relationships;
and a threat to one's sense of belong¬
ing to a larger group.
While Dr. Hamburg had been one
of the meeting's most forthright critics
of the effects of bloodshed and
violence in TV shows on young minds,
he saw television as an extremely
hopeful tool. He recalled. In this
respect, the solidarity he sensed in a
Stockholm hotel lobby when about
100 persons from all over the world
were watching the return of the
Apollo 13 flight.
"The potential unifying effect of
television was never so obvious to
me... but perhaps one need not have
astronauts near death to use television
in this way."
As an immediate step, he recom¬
mended that the mass media show the
seamy side of aggressiveness. "Vio¬
lence must be in bad taste on tele¬
vision if it is to have the effect of
reducing aggressiveness."
Then he looked at the positive side
of the problem. The scientists at the
meeting, like so many of their pre¬
decessors, agreed that a substitute
must be found for aggressiveness.
Dr. Hamburg summed up their feeling:
"If hunting and warlike activities are
no longer appropriate to develop the
self-esteem of young males, then there
must be something else." He suggest¬
ed that children should be given more
of a chance to see what their fathers
do for a living so that their only
"male models" will no longer be the
hard-shooting cowboys and criminals
on the screen.
Following his remarks. Dr. Makami-
nan Makagiansar, an Indonesian social
scientist who is now a Unesco staff
member in Paris, made it clear that the
problem goes beyond the individual.
"We must change institutions that
create situations where one must be
aggressive to survive," he said, and
drew an example from his own recent
experience.
Coming from Indonesia, where
cradle-to-the-grave security is provid¬
ed by the family and language is full
of buffers to prevent feelings from
being rubbed raw, he landed in Paris
with a car. "I thought I could never
drive in Paris, but I did. I just became
as aggressive as some Paris drivers."
Dr. Holsti, the political scientist,
transposed this view to the world
scene. "In the present international
system, we play the game under rules
like those that apply to driving in Paris.
One need not posit that others are
aggressive. If we do, this can make

To untold millions of youngsters, the
"tough guy "..law breaker or fast-drawing
cowboy.. has become a staple "hero".
Hostility and hate, violence and brutality
are built-in ingredients of many TV films
and so-called "comic" books. Many
psychologists now believe that other
occupations and professions can also be
made very attractive, so that the
trigger-happy cowboys, criminals and
under-cover agents no longer constitute
a major source of glamour for children
and young people.
a system as dangerous as the Paris
traffic system sometimes seems."
That is the very root of group
aggressiveness as Dr. Hamburg saw
it in his conclusions. He called for
research on "the virtuosity of the
human mind to provide justification to
harm out-group members." These
justifications are usually based on
three reasons: the damage that "they"
might do to "us"; the damage that
"they" might do to themselves if they
were not prevented; and the conviction
that the "others" are not really human.
What is unusual about these beliefs,
said Dr. Hamburg, is that they can be
produced by a great variety of political
and social systems. Progress will be
achieved only when it is generally
recognized that all societies are dan¬
gerous, not just the other fellow's.
"Man is a potentially violent animal
organized into potentially violent
societies."
We will have much more of a chance
of survival, in Dr. Hamburg's opinion,
if we can come to think of ourselves
as a single species, if we can identify
ourselves with a world species while
respecting diversity of cultures. Per
haps the family can serve as a model
for a human family but, as participants
in the meeting had already remarked,
it is difficult to expand from the
awareness of a small number of
people to a world community.
Dr. Hamburg and others felt the
need for a "superordinate goal" to
weld the world together. "A threat
to the species could be effective," he
remarked, "but we have lived in the
shadow of extinction for twenty years
while our statesmen still talk in 19th
century terms. Perhaps we need
100 years to avert the danger of
nuclear war . . . but will we get the
remaining eighty?"
He saw more immediate hope in
what we called "overlapping group
memberships" that can link people
together through multiple loyalties.
Business, industry and international
organizations can provide them. A
particularly good example, he felt, is
that of the graduate students in univer¬
sities who can serve as a bridge
between the students and the faculty
in times of crisis. Such reconciliation
services could be developed on a well-
organized basis for many more situa
tions where violence is likely to break
out.
As the meeting drew to an end,
other members came up with their
ideas to cut tensions and violence,
whether national or international. The
suggestions flew thick and fast:
"Peace corps" types of activities for
youth; revision of history textbooks so
that they no longer teach violence;
education in international understand¬
ing in schools; a Unesco survey of the
world's educational systems to see
why they make people think they
belong to a superior group . . .
Old Unesco hands at the meeting
almost thought they were watching a
ghost. Nearly twenty-five years ago,
these were the ideas in the air when
Unesco came into being in a world so
shaken by the ravages of war that
people were convinced nothing of the
sort could ever happen again. Today,
that illusion has gone. History is
repeating itself, the unthinkable is
once more in sight and in mind. This
meeting showed that man has a
chance to survive if he can recognize
why he behaves the way he does.
But he will not have very many more
chances if he does not.
