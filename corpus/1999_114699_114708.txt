In India, where the traditional joint fa m i l y
system is breaking down and there is a dearth
of homes for the aged, most elderly people
face an uncertain future.
I n d i a , the wo r l d ’s second most populous nat i o n ,
has more aged people than the entire population of
F r a n c e . Official statistics show that there were 56
million Indians above 60 ye a rs of age in 1991,
amounting to 6.5 per cent of the total population of
844 million. Only 10 per cent of them have a pension
and access to some form of health scheme.The rest
h ave no health care, insurance or assured fin a n c i a l
s u p p o rt . More Indian elders will be in a similar
s i t u ation as gove rnment projections indicate that the
60-plus population could double between 1991 and
2 0 1 6 .
Traditionally, the average Indian’s life centred
on the family. Joint families were the norm and the
elderly stayed with their sons and relat i ve s. A n a l y s t s
s ay mass migr ation from the countryside to the
cities and ove rs e a s , coupled with changing social
va l u e s , h ave led to the disintegr ation of multi-
g e n e r ational fa m i l i e s.As a result,m a ny aged people
are left to fend for themselves.
Even today, moving into an old people’s home
carries a social stigma because it suggests that one
has been abandoned by one’s own children. B u t
many elders have no choice. However, Indian old
people’s homes are already overcrowded.
According to a directory issued by the Centre for
the We l fare of the Aged (CEWA ) ,a non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z at i o n , in 1995 India had about 500
g ove rnment-funded homes for the aged, of which 17
per cent were for wo m e n .Most of these homes are ru n
by Christian missionaries and charitable foundat i o n s.
These homes are the only option for those with little
or no money.Together with some 200 pri vate homes,
these institutions,both gove rnment-aided and pri vat e ,
can handle only 30,000 people.
“The waiting list is long and substantial
numbers of elders belonging to the poor and the
l ower middle class will never find a place in
g ove rnment-funded homes,” s ays T. K rishnan Nair,
s e c r e t a ry of the CEWA .“In the last 10 ye a rs ,p ri vat e
homes have appeared which only cater to upper
middle class and rich elders. These homes charge
exorbitant prices which elders from the middle-
class and poor sectors of society can’t afford.”
Of the homes that exist, many fall far short of
p r oviding basic amenities like clean water and good
food.The main problem,social workers say, is that
there are no rules and no organization to keep tabs

t e rms of three-generation models. If the deve l o p i n g
world is to depend on kinship as the key mechanism
for the care of older persons and if this mechanism
is to continue when family size is declining, policy
c o n c e rn must focus on supporting fa m i l i e s
c o m p rising four or five and not simply three
g e n e r at i o n s. Building social policies anchored in the
family will clearly require strong public and
community complementary measures.
Who will care for the very old?
In the developing wo r l d , the increasing numbers
of the ve ry old will have major effects on the pat t e rn s
of exchange and reciprocity between generations.
G r e at grandparents are unlikely to enjoy the
financial and residential autonomy of their
counterparts in the industrial world.They are also
unlikely to displace the “ yo u n g - o l d ” in the
performance of key household functions such as
child care, food preparation and ensuring household
s e c u rity which have been at the heart of
i n t e r g e n e r ational exchanges within the three-
generation household structure.
If low and middle income countries are to depend
upon the family as the key structure in providing for
the social part i c i p ation and care of the “ o l d - o l d ” ,
then much of the responsibility for this will fall upon
the shoulders of the yo u n g - o l d .Although care for the
old-old is still likely to be provided within the
f r a m e work of kinship, it is increasingly likely to be
p r ovided outside the household. In Malay s i a ,Fiji and
the Philippines, older people are already less likely to
be living with children than the younger old.
As the demographic balance alters the political
balance between youth and age, so changes in the
labelling of the older person are to be expected. In the
i n d u s t rial wo r l d , these changes are already begi n n i n g
to occur. In the developing countri e s , the process is
likely to take longer. H owe ve r , the development of a
g e n e r ational politics in the industrial world will
i n fluence the development of the political capacity of
older persons in the developing wo r l d .A d vo c a cy by the
lobbying institutions of older persons in the industri a l
world should help to raise the profile of older people’s
interests in the developing wo r l d .
The emergence of the four- to five - g e n e r at i o n a l
world will necessarily result in altered social roles and
identities for the old.The aging of society will also,u n l e s s
existing inequalities are addressed, result in the
a c c e n t u ation of gender disparities in respect of we a l t h
and quality of life. G i ven these considerat i o n s , s t e p s
must be taken to develop new bases of sociability and
esteem for older generat i o n s. New technology can be
h a rnessed to increase the political capacity and enhance
the sociability of older pers o n s.It can provide a technical
b ridge for linking older persons globally and enable the
old of the developing world to gain direct assistance from
their counterp a rts in the developed wo r l d . It also
p r ovides new opportunities for older persons to
p a rt i c i p ate in shaping the research and policy agenda
a p p r o p ri ate to an aging wo r l d . ■
