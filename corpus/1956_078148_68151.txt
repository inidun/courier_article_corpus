If schools are now mushrooming in back-country villa¬
ges and hamlets of the West African republic of Li¬
beria, a great deal of credit should go to the bush
doctor of Dimeh and the devil of Belinga.
Dimeh and Belinga are both villages in the Klay district,
thirty miles west of Liberia's capital, Monrovia, where Li¬
berian educators and an international technical assis¬
tance team from unesco are working on a fundamental
education project to raise living standards.
Not only have 19 schools been opened in the Klay dis¬
trict itself, but more than two dozen new schools are now
being operated throughout Liberia by 46 men and women
who graduated
this year from
Liberia's Na¬
tional Funda¬
mental Educa¬
tion centre at
Klay.
The story of
julep (Joint
Unesco -Liberia
Education Pro¬
ject) was told
recently by
Marcel de
Clerck, a Bel¬
gian educator
who has return¬
ed to Paris af¬
ter completing
a technical as¬
sistance mission
for unesco in
Liberia. In the

The devil came to
Unesco's aid two years
ago when Mr. de Clerck
managed to convince the
members of Belinda's
Jobai Society (Jobai is
the name of a" spirit
commonly called a devil)
that their village needed
a school and that Jobai
should help. He did his
convincing by talking to
the devil' in appearance
a mask about waist-high
adorned with shells and
mirrors and covered with
raffia. During their con¬
versation (through a tri¬
bal *"interpreter") the
devil danced, but how it
danced is a secret which
no Jobai Society member
dare reveal. In the end, Belinga became the second vil¬
lage in the Klay district to build its own fundamental
education school.
As for the bush doctor, Boima Zina, he is one of the
3,000 members of a health co-operative launched by Li¬
berian educators and members of the unesco team in the
district. A payment of ten cents a year entitles members
to free care at a clinic at Amiina.
"We have the co-operation of the bush doctors and
this is extremely important", commented Mr. de Clerck,
"You see, they send us patients whom they have not been
able to cure*and sometimes, we send them patients".
He recalled the case of a woman with phlebitis who had
been treated by Dr. Paul Meyer, the Liberian government's
official doctor who visits the Amiina clinic every Monday
when anything from 80 to 100 patients may be awaiting
him. Dr. Meyer told his patient that she had to keep her
leg raised for 15 days, but she did not listen to him.
"So then we called on Boima Zina"fsaid Mr. de Clerck,
"He told the woman that she was sick because of an evil
medicine on the floor and she agreed to ¡keep her foot
off the floor for 15 days".

when swamp rice harvest proved to be twice
as plentiful as their own dryland plantings.
NEW GRADUATES leaving the Klay Fundamental Education Centre were the first group to complete
the course in July 1955. These young men will train rural workers for Liberia's education centres.
Last August, Boima Zina gave the Liberia-UNEsco team
a helping hand in its fight against infant mortality. He
called a meeting of chiefs and local notables at the villa¬
ge of Dimeh and, upon his recommendation, they institut¬
ed a thrice-weekly class for village midwives.
In addition to working in health and education, the fun¬
damental education team at Klay has also attacked the
basic problem of increasing food production in the dis¬
trict's villages. Local farmers traditionally have raised
"dryland rice" by burning clearings and planting one
crop, then moving on to another clearing.
But land is becoming scarce, for at least an eight-year
growth of vegetation is required before burning produces
sufficient ash to fertilize a crop. In these villages, the
months from June to October are known as "hunger time"
because not a
grain of rice is
to be had and
families must
subsist for food
on manioc.
However, the
Klay district is
covered with
swamps. Last
spring, the Li¬
beria-U n e s c o
team at Klay
called in the
services of Mr.
Yartu, a young-
agricultural ex¬
pert from Sierra
Leone working
for the Liberian
Government, to
show how crops
of swamp rice
could be raised.

standing joke in the
villages where local
farmers could not decide
whether the experimen¬
ters intended to plant
rice on the dikes or in
the canals.
When young shoots of
paddy began to rise
above the swamps, how¬
ever, the farmers chang¬
ed their minds. Yields
from the swamp rice de¬
monstration farms prov¬
ed to be double those of
the old method of plant¬
ing dry rice in clearings.
Improving living con¬
ditions in the Klay dis¬
trict is only one side
of the fundamental edu¬
cation centre's task. Its
main job is to train rural
workers for fundamen¬
tal education schools
throughout Liberia and graduates of its first class are
now scattered all over the country.
The Liberian government had adopted a policy of
paying these workers among the highest salaries in rural
Liberia and their word carries weight in their commu¬
nities. "'I was amazed myself when I heard about one of
our graduates in the Bopolo district", said Mr. de Clerck.
"When he arrived, he called a meeting of the local chiefs
and, after he had explained his programme to them, they
donated 15,000 acres of land to help him carry it out."
Mr. de Clerck, a former professor at Ostend, is one of
unesco's veteran technical assistance workers. Before
going to Liberia, he completed a two-year mission in El
Salvador, Central America, where he aided in a funda¬
mental education campaign covering a district of 4,000
inhabitants.
In his opinion, there are no secrets to his trade. "It is
just a question of confidence", he said, "You have to live
with the people you are trying to help and you have to
live with them long enough for them to forget that you
are an outsider."
