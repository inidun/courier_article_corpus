s t r ategy to cope with the number of people
m oving in from the country s i d e . T h e s e
people are looking to improve their econo-
mic opportunities but they can’t afford for-
mal housing.
Doesn’t the solution lie in building and
subsidizing more public housing?
The public service is a bu r e a u c r a cy which
cannot cope with this type of problem. I n
e ve ry city, the authori t i e s ’ first approach is
the same: t ry building more formal housing
to replace informal settlements. But they
n e ver succeed because they will only deve-
lop areas that conform to certain standards of
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e , p l a n n i n g and housing
c o n s t ru c t i o n . Instead of considering the
a l t e rn at i ve s , these bureaucracies plod along,
building too few houses too slow l y — h o u s e s
which are too expensive for the people they
were intended for.These standards actually
d i ve rt gove rnment from the real problem,
which is assisting the urban poor. Look at
w h at happened in Brazil. Despite all the
good intentions,public housing was taken
over by the middle class and never reached
the poor.
Most city authorities find informal settlements
in such deplorable states that they feel they
Shantytowns, squatters’ communities, 
slums—these are some of the names used 
to describe informal settlements. How many
people in the world call them home?
B e t ween 40 per cent and 50 per cent of
the population in the cities of the South are
living in these settlements—that ’s roughly
one billion people.The rate at which the
settlements are gr owing va ries from regi o n
to regi o n . In most of Latin A m e ri c a , t h e
gr owth rate has peaked, but it’s still increa-
sing in Asia and sub-Saharan A f ri c a . In my
own city, Cape Tow n ,i n f o rmal settlements
are gr owing at about 10 per cent per ye a r —
but you must remember that South A f ri c a ’s
s t a rting point is relat i vely low. I n f o rmal sett-
lements were rarely allowed to deve l o p
under apartheid.
What are the main characteristics of informal
settlements? 
F i rs t , the people don’t generally have
a ny legal tenure to the land they occupy.
S e c o n d , the settlements lie outside the for-
mal planning process. As a result, t h e y
usually lack or have ve ry low levels of basic
s e rvices like water and sanitat i o n .A n d , o f
c o u rs e , the dwellings are informal in the
sense that they are built by the people them-
s e l ves out of basic mat e rials in a ve ry simple
manner.
Why are these settlements growing? 
Is it because formal housing projects are 
too expensive? 
The problem encompasses fin a n c i n g
and the availability of land. Land is a com-
modity available to the rich and the middle
class but not to the poor. On the one hand,
you have pri vate landow n e rs who want to
get the highest return from their land—and
dealing with ve ry poor people is generally
not perceived as bri n ging good fin a n c i a l
r e t u rn s. On the other, m a ny cities still have
a lot of public land. But city authorities in
the South have neither resources nor 



JOHN ABBOTT, 
SOUTH AFRICA’S 
CI TY STITCHER
Squatter settlements are ‘home’ to around a billion people in and around Third World cities. 
The authorities usually want to bulldoze them. South African urban engineer John Abbott
thinks they should be upgraded and woven into the urban fabric
must start from scratch, destroy the old shacks
and rebuild new homes. Why are so you
adamantly opposed to this?
F i rs t , because it destroys a physical asset.
Yo u ’re not building new shelter; yo u ’re sim-
ply replacing existing shelter. So you aren’t
adding to the overall stock of housing. I n s-
tead of a financial benefit , there is a major
financial loss. Yo u ’re also creating an
immense social cost by destroying all the
social networks and mechanisms which
people have built to surv i ve in these infor-
mal settlements.T h i r d , you never end up
r e l o d ging eve ry fa m i l y. Some are bound to
be uprooted and left with no place to go
except another informal settlement.T h at ’s
been proven over and over again.
But isn’t it better to offer people a proper
house than leave them in a slum?
Let’s turn the question round. Is it
better to house 10 per cent of the popula-
tion and leave the rest in slum conditions
or is it better to work with 100 per cent 
of the population so that they slowly
improve their own condition?
You often refer to the social networks 
of informal settlements as “social capital”.
What do you mean by this?
I t ’s something of a paradox . On the one
h a n d , these settlements can be ve ry dange-
rous places. In Rio de Ja n e i r o, for example,
it is felt that drug dealers use the inform a l
settlements as a base because the police can-
not access or monitor them easily. It is also
t rue that people in informal settlements suf-
fer more from serious crime than people in
higher income areas. But this tends to draw
them closer together.You cannot put a dol-
lar figure on these social netwo r k s , but this
social capital is extremely va l u a b l e .S u rv i va l
is based on interdependence.You don’t have
the resources in an informal settlement to
o p e r ate as an individual. If you want to go
out and sell food informally at the market,
If you want to go out 
and sell food informally 
at the market, who is going 
to look after your children?
If you don’t get paid 
on a regular basis, 
how do you live from month
to month? 
If you get sick, who is going 
to help you?

who is going to look after your children? If
you don’t get paid on a regular basis, h ow
do you live from month to month? If you get
s i c k , who is going to help you? 
But don’t people take this capital from one
settlement to another? 
When an informal settlement is des-
t r oye d , people are generally moved in a ran-
dom fa s h i o n .They lose the linkages that
exist not just between individuals but bet-
ween gr o u p s.Ve ry often, people from cer-
tain rural areas move to particular inform a l
settlements in the cities. So when they
a rri ve , they have a lot of things in common.
They operate collective l y.When they get
m ove d , they lose those communal ties.To
make things worse, the local authorities in
the new settlements treat families as indi-
vidual units—e.g., by the design of the phy-
sical dwelling they live in and the taxes they
p ay.The whole framework of their life forces
them to behave as individuals, not collec-
tive units.
You’ve described the major faults of the top-
down approach cities usually take in dealing
with informal settlements. What are the
alternatives?
T h at depends to some extent on the
culture and the income level of the city.
There are two major approaches: the firs t
is people-based and exists in countries like
I n d i a ,S ri Lanka and Pakistan where there is
gr e at pove rt y.The most famous example is
the Orangi settlement in Karachi.T h e r e ,
the people decided that their first pri o ri t y
lay in building a sanitation system because
the municipal authority wo u l d n ’t do any-
thing about it. So they raised the money and
the manpower to lay their own sewer pipes,
with technical assistance from an NGO.T h e
pipes ran from the shacks to open ditches
on the outskirts of the settlements.This for-
ced the local authority to connect their sani-
tation system to a treatment facility.
The second approach is found in Bra-
zil where there is a more structured part-
n e rship between community organizat i o n s ,
professionals and NGOs.This kind of part-
n e rship makes it possible to look beyo n d
i m m e d i ate issues and develop a longer-
t e rm , wide-range vision for the community.
Instead of focusing on one aspect like sani-
t at i o n , you can also look at others such as
housing and access to public transport a-
t i o n .You begin by developing plans as to
where you want your settlement to be and
how you want it to grow and develop.This
generally requires external funding, e s p e-
cially for infrastru c t u r e .The two different
approaches basically reflect the different
levels of wealth in cities like Rio and Kara-
chi.
How have you gone about things 
in Cape Town?
We have developed the Brazilian model
and are working at a people-driven level to
reinforce the economic base of inform a l
s e t t l e m e n t s. But we want to do more than
just improve the physical infrastructure of
the settlements as dorm i t o ry subu r b s —
Ve ry often, people 
from certain rural areas 
move to particular informal
settlements in the cities. 
So when they arrive, 
they have a lot of things 
in common. They opera t e
c o l l e c t i v e l y. When they get
moved, they lose those
communal ties.
John Abbott (left) and two colleagues engaged on a Cape Town project to upgrade an informal settlement (see also photos on pages 48 and 49).

‘Iwas born in a very poor area in England,
which is probably why I feel very comfor-
table in informal settlements,” says John
Abbott. Co-ordinator of the University of Cape
Town’s urban management programme, he is
an urban engineer who has won an internatio-
nal reputation for improving conditions in
South Africa’s informal settlements. “Pe o p l e
come together because they need each other,”
he says, “especially in situations where 60 or 70
per cent of the population is very poor. I’m not
saying it’s only poverty [that creates this solida-
r i ty] but if you don’t have individual tra n s p o r t ,
TV and all those luxuries that draw you more
into your private world, you tend to rely on col-
lective action or entertainment for a social life
as well as for social need.”
Abbott first landed in Africa at the age of 12
when his parents moved to Uganda and Ke n y a .
He went back to England for his university stu-
dies, but soon returned to the continent, wor-
king in South Africa as a civil engineer before
switching to urban engineering.
Increasingly aware of the brutalities of apar-
theid while living in Johannesburg and then Cape
Town, in 1985 he started Planact, an NGO which
brought together civic organizations and tra d e
unions in the struggle for urban equality in South
A f r i ca and became famous throughout the coun-
t ry. 
This struggle came to a head for Abbott in
1986, when he began working with an informal
settlement near the coastal city of Po r t
Elizabeth. Parts of the sprawling settlement
“could be seen by white residents and there
was a move to get rid of it,” says Abbott.
Instead of destroying the settlement, Abbott
and Planact tried to upgrade it with the help of
civic movements and with financial support
from several big companies. But just as the
u p g rading plan was taking shape, the govern-
ment decreed a state of emergency across the
c o u n t ry, which provided “a blanket of secrecy
for the army to move in and totally destroy the
c o m m u n i ty,” says Abbott. “Every family was
bulldozed out. They moved to a tempora ry
camp, but quite a lot of people died from mal-
nourishment and disease.” 
Ve ry few people knew about the destruc-
tion, he says, because the newspapers were
banned from reporting on what was conside-
red a “military secret”. “It was one of the tra n s-
forming events of my life,” he says. From then
on, he kept one foot in the academic world of
urban management at the University of Cape
Town, but, he says, “I shifted my work increa-
singly towards informal settlements.” ■
places where people sleep but do not wo r k .
I don’t think physical restru c t u ring alone is
going to promote economic deve l o p m e n t .
You have to go to the roots of the problem.
Our ultimate aim is to integrate these sett-
lements into the fabric of the city.
At the Unive rsity of Cape Tow n ,we have
a pilot project involving over 2,500 fa m i l i e s
or about 10,000 people.We began by using
s atellite images of the settlement to deve-
lop a computer-based map which offers eve-
ryone a clear vision of the settlement—each
family can see its place in the community.
We are starting to collect demographic and
economic inform ation about their house-
h o l d s. For example, there turns out to be a
fair number of people in the house-bu i l d i n g
t r a d e . So we ’ ve introduced support schemes
to build a corps of trained wo r k e rs to
upgrade the settlement.
We ’ ve also found that about 60 per cent
of the people are in formal employment bu t
about 20 per cent work in the informal sec-
tor and 20 per cent had no visible means of
financial support .We highlighted all the
i n f o rmal businesses on the map and are
t rying to find ways of supporting them. Fo r
e x a m p l e , the community is now linked with
a number of tour operat o rs who are bri n-
ging overseas tourists into the area to spur
bu s i n e s s.We ’re also fund-raising ove rs e a s
to construct a market to sustain tourism.
Are you suggesting that there’s no point in
upgrading a settlement without an overall
development strategy? 
T h at depends on the city. In cities in
I n d i a , for example, i t ’s hard to imagine a
time on the horizon when you will have for-
mal settlements because there are just so
m a ny people and so little space. In Cape
Tow n , we still have the time to transform
i n f o rmal settlements into formal areas. I n
A f rican cities in general, it is possible to
combine long-term planning and vision with
more immediate needs.
What does it mean to transform an informal
settlement into a formal settlement? 
There has to be some sort of land secu-
ri t y. Land titles are the common but not the
only form of tenure.The issues of access,
social services and health care also have to
be dealt with. Cape Tow n , for example, p r o-
bably has the highest incidence of tubercu-
losis in the world because of flooding in win-
t e r. I n f o rmal settlements are part i c u l a r l y
hard hit by water-borne diseases.The high
i n fant mortality is also caused by living in
d a r k ,d a n k ,c o n fined spaces reeking of paraf-
fin.
So far, we’ve talked about upgrading
conditions for people already living 
in informal settlements. But how do you plan
for and manage the flow of newcomers? 
You d o n ’t b e gin by wo rrying about foo-
lishly high standards for roads, large bu i l-
ding plots and big open “public spaces”.
Instead you work on planning a basic mini-
mum which can be developed ve ry cheaply
and quickly. Local authorities can begin by
marking out building plots that use space
as economically as possible. In Brazil, t h e y
opt for multi-storied bu i l d i n g s , but here in
A f rica people prefer single-story dwe l l i n g s.
You can still plan for a density of up to 100
d wellings per hectare. Large public open
spaces aren’t necessary at this point. I n s-
tead of high-quality roads, you design access
Computerized mapping technology is used to help plan an access road to the settlement.

a u t h o rities also have a constituency in the
f o rmal areas where people are frightened by
the informal settlements.There is also what
might be called a technical fear of these sett-
lements on the part of the city authori t i e s.
These are places which don’t seem to have
a ny identity or order.They don’t corr e s p o n d
to any official standards.The authorities are
f rightened and throw up their hands,s ay i n g,

routes.You lay down a basic water scheme
which puts a standpipe within 100 metres
of eve ry dwe l l i n g . Then you look at the
ground conditions and the culture before
installing some basic sanitation—either pit
latrines or communal toilets.The aim is to
p r ovide the infrastructure and services that
people need and relate to. In Brazil, f o r
e x a m p l e , ground that cannot be used for
housing is used for football fields which no
one would dream of squat t i n g . In South
A f ri c a , you might make some space for a
crèche or a school, if that ’s what people
want.
Your work has met with a lot of political
resistance. Why?
F i rs t ,i n f o rmal settlements are conside-
red dangerous and undesirable places that
should be got rid of. S e c o n d , m u n i c i p a l

We responded by first of all showing that
all attempts to focus on formal housing
would not solve the informal housing pro-
blem and that this problem would continue
to gr ow no matter how much was spent on
f o rmal housing. It took a few ye a rs , but this
has finally been accepted.The next step lies
in showing that upgrading is a viable, r e p l i-
cable methodology.
You’ve described how to upgrade the informal
settlements in Cape Town. But how are you
trying to integrate them into the rest of the
city?
To begin with, we are putting the infor-
mal settlements on the map.We know where
they are so we can now create access routes
and other services to link them to the rest
of the city. Just putting these places on the
map is a major step forward.The Brazilian
city of Belo Hori z o n t e , which is in some
ways our model, has three million people,
40 per cent of whom live in informal sett-
l e m e n t s. If you look at a map of the city
dating from around 1980,a time when the
m i l i t a ry junta was leaving powe r , you wo n ’t
see a single sign of the informal settlements.
At that time maps simply showed as blank
spaces settlements where thousands of
people lived without any physical linkages
to the rest of the city.
You cannot just work locally, i n s i d e
i n f o rmal settlements. You must also 
tackle the problem at the metropolitan leve l .
You must know where the settlements are
and how they are likely to gr ow.Then yo u
can create physical linkages so that they
a r e n ’t islands of exclusion, cut off from the
c i t y. Once you have done that , you can go
to the planning level and work with people
and ask questions. H ow do you want this
area to look? How is it going to integr at e
into commercial life? These people wa n t
access to shops and work opport u n i t i e s.
How do we create those linkages?
Why is it so important to integrate a city? 
A city is a complex link between indivi-
duals and gr o u p s. Its fa b ric is built on
mutual dependency, although we tend not
to notice that ve ry much these day s. I n s e-
c u rity and crime in one area are bound to
affect other areas. We drain the city’s
resources by failing to support people who
are poor. By dividing a city between ri c h
and poor—or informal and formal areas—
you reinforce the fortress mentality and
actually limit the city’s capacity to gr ow and
develop.
I t ’s not enough to focus on people’s
s h o rt - t e rm needs.You need a long-term
vision and plan so that eve ryone can contri-
bute in some way to the city’s deve l o p m e n t .
