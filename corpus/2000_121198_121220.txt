All eyes on the re a l i t y
g a m e
A new television genre has won
huge audiences across 
the world. Despised by some,
adored by others, reality shows
play upon the paradoxes of
modern society—but at what cost?
ine people are travelling across Spain in
a bus.Ten Poles will be locked in a house
in Wa r s a w.Germans have been invited to
slim and earn their lost weight in gold.A
seemingly mundane set of events, w a t-
ched over by cameras and transformed
into primetime television by the fact that
everyone must work together though
only one can win.
Reality may have perplexed philoso-
phers and scientists for centuries, but in
the jargon of modern-day television it
has become a surefire way to entice the
restless viewer.Across Eastern and We s-
tern Europe, North and South America,
programmes devised on the basis that a
“ r e a l ” set of events involving “ o r d i n a r y ”
people is unfolding—with cash prizes—
have defied the industry’s rules of thumb.
Place ten unknown men and women in a
locked villa in Spain under the gaze of 29
c a m e r a s, and the result is unexpected: 1 2
million people,a third of the nation’s popu-
l a t i o n , tuned in to watch.
Everywhere the small-screen formula
of constant surveillance, m o n e y - d r i v e n
competition and confinement has tra-
v e l l e d , it has triumphed. In the United
S t a t e s,S u r v i v o r—featuring 16 contestants
marooned on a sweltering Malaysian
island and forced to eat grubs—simply
overwhelmed all other summer pro-
g r a m m i n g,picking up 50 million viewers.
A sister show in Brazil did likewise. S o m e
15 countries, m e a n w h i l e, have adapted
the Dutch programme Big Brother, l a u n-
ched in 1999, in which ten people inhabit
a house, c o n v e r s e, c o m p l o t , and with the
help of viewers’ votes thin down over
several months to a final winner.An esti-
mated 300 million people have now seen
the show; those veterans of the Spanish
villa are already stars, contributing their
particular mystique to the market of cele-
brity tie-ins through a video-game and
auction of their favourite blankets.
“ We created a new genre where we
proved that ordinary people can be very
interesting as characters, and where next-
door people can do much more than eve-
ryone expected they could,”declares Jo h n
De Mol, the Dutch head of Endemol
Entertainment and inventor of Big Brother.
For muttering critics and offended
b i s h o p s, h o w e v e r, this new genre was a
case of television sinking to a misanthropic
l o w.While some agreed with De Mol that
his show was consensual, competitive fun
and excellent fodder for what A m e r i c a n
producers term the water cooler—the place
in the office where staff gossip—opponents
found only voyeurism and degradation.I n

via camera with the programme’s producers.

G e r m a n y,government ministers suggested
the programme could be declared uncons-
t i t u t i o n a l . Bernard Crick, biographer of
the author George Orwell, despaired at a
f u l filled prophecy.People “are simply depo-
liticized by cultural debasement, d u m b e d
d o w n , kept from even thinking of deman-
ding fair shares,”he wrote of Orwell’s satire
in 1 9 8 4, the novel that invented Big Brother.
The show, he suggested, offered the same
glitzy “ p r o l e f e e d .”
Intimate troubles under 
the glare of spotlights
So many viewers and such attacks
would suggest that cameras and humans
have been striking up a new relationship.
“ Viewers come from all social classes,e v e n
culturally very high ones,” argues Ignacio
B e l , a professor in information rights in
M a d r i d . “It comes down to a morbid fas-
c i n a t i o n , to an unhealthy curiosity.”Wh e n
the American channel Court TV briefly
ran a show in which criminals confessed
their murders on camera, the concerns
seemed fully justifie d .Watch Big Brother,
h o w e v e r, and privacy fears may be
a l l a y e d . For a start, the participants w a n t
to be there: their fear is not exposure but
a n o n y m i t y, a kind of individual fade-out.
And though much of the appeal centres
on the promise of spying a saucy
moment—sex is always being talked
a b o u t , though rarely had—the truth is
that the viewer’s diet is less salacious. I n
the British version, contestants overslept,
tended chickens, photocopied their ana-
t o m y, and decried the utter tedium of
living on television without watching tele-
v i s i o n . Rather than intrusive, the antics
were just excruciatingly banal.
But look again, and the
same lack of action can take
on a different meaning.
Nothing much happens, n o -
one emits an even remotely
interesting opinion, but the
tell-tale reality TV gesture,t h e
quick eye-fli c k , registers the
nearest camera.Each conver-
s a t i o n , vacuous as it may be,
treads a perilous line between
s e l f - e x p r e s s i o n , i m p r e s s i n g
housemates (who nominate
each other for eviction), a n d
currying favour with millions
of sofa-bound viewers. Th e
effect is akin to a public rela-
tions assault course. “ I t
appealed to the psychologist
in me,” says 39-year-old Nidi
Etim from Manchester,
E n g l a n d .“ Watching how they
all interacted, who were the natural lea-
d e r s, how they coped with the nomina-
t i o n s.”
At the heart of reality shows’ popu-
larity are exactly these interpersonal
c o n flicts—the same force which animates
traditional drama, soap-operas and talk-
s h o w s. Indeed talk-shows are among the
closest relatives of reality T V, a l l o w i n g
“ o r d i n a r y ” people to thrash out their
most intimate troubles under the glare of
studio lights. But the new genre has a
different focus. Cameras are mounted
on an island or in a house, and a mini-
society is invited in. Viewers pry on
e v e n t s, monitor reactions, assess beha-
v i o u r. Instead of an individual’s tale, or a
daily life, the show is about the society’s
e v o l u t i o n , the disintegration of an artifi-
cial assembly via a period of co-operation
towards a final prize-winner.
“ The best mixture of fiction and reality
that has existed until now,”insists Elizabeth
L o p e z , producer of Gran Hermano f o r
S p a i n ’s Te l e 5 .The shows may be contrived
(the producers of the U. S.Big Brother t r i e d
to bribe dull contestants $50,000 into
making way for a “ s e x y ”n e w c o m e r ) ,but as
Lopez says, the participants “write their
own scripts.”For many viewers,the struggle
is all too recognizable. It is the balance
between staying on the show,getting others
off the show, and preserving at least a
façade of solidarity. It is a “ s c r i p t ” that the
modern workplace and family are founded
upon—battling to be first but staying
p o p u l a r.In Internet chat forums,the debate
centres on who is sincere, who is “ p l a y i n g
Miss Cool,” who is the villain: in short,
how each person responds to the chal-
l e n g e. Add cameras and excessive stage 
m a n a g e m e n t ,says social psychologist Peter
Lunt (see interview opposite), and the
stakes get even higher. Contestants are
not just playing with each other, but with
the very nature of living in a world domi-
nated by the emotions, language and
images coined by the mass media.
With it has come a new kind of cele-
brity. Graduates from the school of 24-
hour surveillance such as Holland’s Bart
Spring and U.S. Survivor victor Richard
H a t c h , a gay corporate trainer, h a v e
soared into fame’s dizzy heights—Spring
has even launched his own logoed clo-
thing range. Rather than offer perfect
teeth,the new stars glitter with ordinari-
n e s s : they are people one could know
before fame won them the services of
bodyguards and image consultants. N o n -
stop availability of many shows on the
Internet,gossip sites, public voting, even
the chance to e-mail participants, r e i n-
forces this democratic attraction. R e a-
lity TV appears to be under viewers’
control even as it trumpets media power.
The cynical appeal 
of a staged life
Following its early successes, the mix
of ceaseless documentary and game-show
is spawning in a frenzy, c o n fining volun-
teers in buses (De Mol’s new show T h e
B u s) , locking them to possible mates
(Chains of Lov e,De Mol again) or chasing
them round cities (the extremely bizarre
game at www. r e a l i t y r u n . c o m ) .“Any given
success is overproduced like mad by imi-
t a t o r s,”says Todd Gitlin,a leading thinker
on the media from New York University.
All harmless, say the show’s produ-
c e r s.No blood is spilt, and no-one ends up
poorer. Yet the loops connecting televi-
sion and society are difficult to untangle.
It may be fun to watch men and women
stumble through the hardships with a fat
lens over their shoulder, but is this not a
case of television spreading its empire?
And in so doing, is television imposing its
own shorthand on the “real” world—its
t y p o l o g i e s,quick characterizations,g a m e -
show dynamics and ad breaks?
“I suspect that the greatest fla v o r i n g
of life that comes from these shows is a
kind of knowing cy n i c i s m ,” says Gitlin,
“an embrace of the idea that everything
is staged, that feelings are shallow, t h a t
the difference between life and simula-
tion is insignific a n t .” Not a voyeuristic
hell then, but a televised format to daily
l i f e : that may be reality T V ’s main mes-
s a g e. O r, as one man said of his Big Bro-
t h e r h o u s e m a t e s :“ w e ’re so close . . . w e l l ,
I feel we are.” ■
