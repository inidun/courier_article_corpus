In Budapest (Hungary ) ,B ri t i s h ,F r e n c h
and German public radio broadcasters
are making a joint bid to open an FM
s t ation in 2000.The venture is emblematic of
the new world in which intern ational radios
are nav i g at i n g . Almost ove rn i g h t , the fall of
the Iron Curtain radically called into question
the traditional mission of these broadcas-
t e rs—to send an oxygen balloon of inform a-
tion to citizens living in one-party states or
under repressive regi m e s.
Not that this mission has lost its rele-
va n c e . Afghanistan and China are among
Voice of A m e ri c a ’s top five markets, and in
the latter jamming is standard practice, a
measure of the broadcaster’s undesirable
i n flu e n c e , at least by Chinese gove rn m e n t
s t a n d a r d s.In times of crisis such as the recent
K o s ovo confli c t , audiences surge.Faced with
the most drastic budget cuts in the history of
G e rman public broadcasting in 1999,
Deutsche We l l e ’s director general Dieter We i-
rich remained adamant about the mission of
an intern ational serv i c e : “ Two thirds of
humanity live in countries without freedom of
the press or inform at i o n .We regard it as our
p a rticular duty to provide them with unin-
t e rrupted objective inform ation from credible
s o u r c e s.”
A buoy for freedom
But in many parts of the wo r l d , the end of
the Cold War has taken a time-old ideologi c a l
edge off the equat i o n , forcing intern at i o n a l
b r o a d c a s t e rs to adjust rapidly to a radically
n e w,more fragmented env i r o n m e n t .No lon-
ger can they claim to be the sole altern at i ve to
censored gove rnment broadcasts; no longer
are they viewed as a freedom bu oy to some, a
s u b ve rs i ve force to others. F u rt h e rm o r e , i n

IN T ERN AT IONAL 
RA DIO MAKES 
NEW WAV ES

Once the sole source of outside news for many countries, international public broadcasters
have had to adapt to a new competitive environment

rality of opinions to be expressed on new FM
( f r e q u e n cy modulation) stat i o n s.
“Because of a different political context,
radios whose main goal was to provide infor-
m ation to countries that didn’t have access
to any outside news sources have had to
change their tune and develop on trans-
mission mediums other than short wave ,”
explains Hugues Salord, director of inter-
n ational affa i rs at Radio France Intern a-
t i o n a l e . In a sense, they have had to learn
to “sell themselve s ” on markets with enti-
rely different cultures and expectat i o n s ,b e
it in Europe, A f ri c a ,Asia or Latin A m e ri c a .
In short ,e x t e rnal broadcasters have had to
become both local and international.
The process of adapting to open markets
has been tantamount to an intensive immer-
sion course for external broadcasters. In a
d e r e g u l ated audiovisual landscape, the firs t
m ove for all broadcasters was to strike up
p a rt n e rships with FM stations around the
world for rebroadcast of their progr a m m e s ,o r
to acquire FM transmitters to set up local fre-
q u e n c i e s , a more expensive option. As a
m e d i u m , FM represents a quantum quality
leap over crackly short wave ,a l l owing broad-
c a s t e rs to speak faster and insert music into
p r o gr a m m e s.
The BBC,according to the World Serv i-
c e ’s European news and current affa i rs edi-
tor Mark Bray n e , was “streets ahead of almost
a nybody else” in building up FM netwo r k s ,
s t a rting with Finland in 1987. In 1990, t h e
World Service was in Romania just after the
fall of the Communist regime signing deals
with emerging radio stations and has built up
a network of 97 local rebroadcasters.A recent
study shows that the British broadaster has
captured 17 per cent of the Romanian radio
a u d i e n c e :“ We have become a national broad-
caster in a sense.We cover Romanian news in
quite some detail but with BBC journ a l i s t i c

values embedded into a solid analytical fa r e
of intern ational news,” s ays Bray n e .
A f ri c a , where broadcast markets deregu-
l ated faster than in A s i a , is a particularly cove-
ted zone.W h e r e ver an external broadcaster
can get onto FM, audiences shoot up.T h e
BBC and RFI pull in huge audiences in their
f o rmer A f rican colonies while Ethiopia ranks
among VOA ’s top five markets. RFI has star-
ted to open up FM relays outside West A f ri-
can capitals, in the second and third largest
c i t i e s ,and is introducing locally produced pro-
grammes in the Bambara language in Mali.
“RFI is practically perceived as a full-fle d-
ged national radio serv i c e , with audience
scores of up to 30 to 40 per cent of the
French-speaking populat i o n ,” s ays Erlends
C a l a bu i g, director of foreign languages.T h e
French broadcaster is now trying to make
inroads outside the francophone zone, w i t h

and one to follow in Lagos.“There is a clear
desire for countries in the region to break

A f rica is taking a gr owing interest in the fran-
cophone wo r l d ,not only in a linguistic sense,
but also from a political, economic and cul-
tural standpoint.”
Demand for accurate information
C l e a r l y, there is a strong demand for
e x t e rnal broadcasters , and not only as pro-
v i d e rs of intern ational news. “There is fa r
gr e ater competition on a large number of
m a r k e t s , but not always for accurate and
i m p a rtial news,” s ays Caroline T h o m s o n ,
deputy chief exe c u t i ve of the BBC Wo r l d
S e rv i c e . “In many countri e s , a lot of music
s t ations have come on the air as a result of
d e r g u l at i o n , but news is quite heavily regu-
l ated or of ve ry poor quality and subject to
considerable local interference.”
Voice of A m e ri c a ’s director Sandy Unger
c o n c u rs that there is a strong demand in emer-
ging democracies for balanced and accurat e
i n f o rm at i o n .“Where media are not fully deve-
l o p e d ,where there are criminal libel laws and
all sorts of constraints on free flow of infor-
m at i o n , reliable inform ation ve ry often has to
come from the outside,”he affirm s.E v i d e n c e
seems to speak for itself. Pointing to VOA ’s
400 affil i ate FM stations in Latin A m e ri c a ,
he asks: “ W hy are they signing up for this if
there is no need, if they were confident that
i n f o rm ation is being provided in their socie-
t i e s ? ”
While all the major broadcasters are pre-
sent on local FMs, they each have a mission
to uphold.The BBC World Service stands by
its reputation for trust and quality,r e p e at e d l y
singled out in its audience surve y s.Voice of
A m e ri c a , which became an independent
federal entity in October, upholds its man-
d ate to report on world news and on A m e ri-
can politics, society and culture. RFI pri d e s
itself on presenting a French reading of the
news that reflects the dive rsity of opinion in
the country. DW ’s director Dieter We i ri c h
underlines the broadcaster’s role in “ f o rm i n g
an intern ational awareness about the new
m o d e rn Germ a ny.” But how this mission is
c a rried out has changed, because FM calls
for a more upbeat ,i n t e r a c t i ve style of pro-
gramming than short - wave broadcasting.A n d
because FM stations are locally based,b r o a d-
c a s t e rs have to understand and cultivate their
niche audiences.
“It is really a matter of zooming in,”
explains RFI’s Calabu i g .“ We have move d
away from reaching an indiscri m i n ate mass of
l i s t e n e rs via one means of transmission span-
ning the whole globe to a focus on prox i m i t y,
which means cat e ring to the expectations of
l i s t e n e rs.”While intern ational news remains
the backbone of all the broadcasters ’ p r o-
gramming and has been significantly expan-
ded over the past few ye a rs to provide round-
the-clock cove r a g e ,menus have also become
more eclectic,mixing music and features adap-
ted to different regi o n s. Local production has
taken on a heightened import a n c e .

a role to play in “ a c c o m p a nying a dialogue bet-

Local language broadcasting
Broadcasting in local languages is one of
the keys to reaching new audiences. R F I ’s
e f f o rts to break into anglophone A f rica will
be stalled until the broadcaster can afford to
m ove into local languages, namely Swa h i l i
and Hausa, as VOA , BBC and DW have all
d o n e .The BBC has introduced several lan-
guages spoken in the newly independent repu-
blics of the former Soviet Union, n o t a b l y
U z b e k ,A z e ri , U k r a i n i a n , Kazakh and Ky r-
g y z .At the same time, it has shut down other
language services—mostly ve rnacular lan-
guages in We s t e rn Europe—which doesn’t
n e c e s s a rily mean loss of influ e n c e .
The BBC’s strategy is to target elites,
and more often than not this can be done in
E n g l i s h . “When we have cut languages, i t ’s
tended to be because we thought that they
were no longer effective rather than because
our budget had been slashed,” says Thom-
s o n .The BBC’s most recent decision to pull
out of German was taken after studies sho-
wed that most of the broadcaster’s audience
in the German-speaking world listened to
its programmes in English. In the U. S . ,t h e
World Serv i c e ’s audience has even recor-
ded growth in recent years.
Faced with cutbacks, DW is ending its
p r o grammes in Japanese and Spanish,and is
in the process of closing several other language
s e rv i c e s , including Czech, S l ovak and Hun-
g a ri a n ,j u d ging that the countries where these
languages are spoken are now “ e s t a b l i s h e d
democracies with a gr e at va riety of media ava i-
l a b l e ” . It is howe ver expanding its Russian
and English-language progr a m m e s , and aims
to make headway in the Asian market via the
A s i a S at 2 sat e l l i t e . Regardless of bu d g e t
c o n s t r a i n t s , all the major playe rs have intro-
duced broadcasts in Albanian and Macedo-
n i a n ,r e flecting the pri o rity they put on being
on air as fast as possible when political cir-
cumstances wa rr a n t .
Introducing new languages may be at the
h e a rt of broadcasters ’s t r at e gies in emergi n g
democracies and developing countri e s ,but it
costs money.While all broadcasters underline
their editorial independence from gove rn-
m e n t , they all rely on them for funding, a n d

none has been graced with a generous influ x
over the past decade.VOA ’s director Sandy
Unger fears “ d r a m atic cuts” if Congress only
grants the service a straightline budget for fis-
cal 2000,which would mean absorbing a 4.8
per cent cost of living increase.The World Ser-
v i c e ’s budget has declined in real terms ove r
the past eight ye a rs. R F I ’s has been stable.
DW ’s budget for 1999 was reduced by DM
30 million ($16.6 million/4.7 per cent), a n d
will be slashed by a further 10 per cent to DM
546 million ($302.3 million), up to the ye a r
2003—seemingly a turnabout from last ye a r ,
when the newly elected gove rnment promi-
sed “an improvement in the way the country
represents itself to the outside wo r l d ”a c c o r-
ding to We i ri c h .Besides six language closures,
over 700 jobs are to be cut.
In the early 1990s, Radio Canada Inter-
n ationale (RCI), a smaller player on the wo r l d
s t a g e , cut seven of its 15 languages and
s h runk its staff, and nearly went off the air in
1996 when it was was saved at the eleve n t h
hour by a federal gove rnment gr a n t .F l o ri a n
S a u va g e a u , a professor at Laval Unive rs i t y
( C a n a d a ) , argues that the crisis reflected the
g ove rn m e n t ’s lack of interest in intern at i o-
nal culural relat i o n s. RCI now aims to put
f o r ward the country ’s economic strength and
cultural dive rs i t y, and is boosting broadcas-
ting to China and A f ri c a .
In this belt-tightening env i r o n m e n t ,o n e
of the dilemmas is how to be present on all
f r o n t s. In politically sensitive zones, e x t e r-
nal radios have to maintain a short - wave pre-
sence in addition to their FM frequencies
and satellite broadcasting. Then comes
i nvestment in new technologi e s.The Inter-
net is top pri o rity for all public broadcasters.
“ I t ’s the short wave of the future,” a f firm s
T h o m s o n .“The trouble with FM is that yo u
are ve ry susceptible to local pressures,” s h e
c o n t i n u e s , noting that at any one time, t h e
World Service has a couple of FM stat i o n s
off the air because an item has offended the
p owe rs in place.“If you are looking at how to
maintain vibrant intern ational broadcasting
in 20 ye a rs time, yo u ’ ve got to invest in the
I n t e rnet now. I t ’s a much freer medium.”
Digitalizing short wave
Thanks to the net, Indian and Pa k i s t a n i
communities in Britain can, for example,
access programmes in Hindi and Urdu.V i e t-
namese can do the same in their own language,
whether they are in the U. S . or V i e t n a m .A l l
b r o a d c a s t e rs are also keeping a close watch on
Worldspace—direct reception via satellite on
individual dishes allowing for an exceptional
quality—and the imminent digi t a l i z ation of
s h o rt wave ,which is likely to gi ve this medium
a new lease on life. D i gitalized short wave will
not only ensure higher listening quality, bu t
also reduce production costs, a l l owing for a
bu rst of new stations to go on air and cater to
increasingly specific audience segments.
M a ny of the countries where deregu-
l ation is underway inherited state broad-
casting services from their former impe-
rial powe rs. N ow, the latter are helping
the liberalization process along, often by
p r oviding training courses and technical
a s s i s t a n c e . RFI recalls that its launch of
the first FM station in Dakar (Senegal) in
1991 played a significant role in “ o p e n i n g
up and enriching the radio landscape and
r e i nv i g o r ating national public radio.” Fo r
VOA ’s Unger, in a number of deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s ,“ i n t e rn ational broadcasters are
s e rving as an example of what can be
d e ve l o p e d .”W h i c h e ver technology wins
out—and colossal investments are at
stake—only contents can gi ve extern a l
b r o a d c a s t e rs the cutting edge.Their gr e a-
test asset, for Salord, lies in their exper-
t i s e , k n ow - h ow and worldwide netwo r k
of corr e s p o n d e n t s. “ I n t e rn ational radio
b r o a d c a s t e rs have a role to play in decry p-
ting the complexity of the world we live
i n .This is our job, not to gi ve value judg-
ments or lessons but to provide facts and
elements that help the listener in form i n g
his or her own opinion.” ■
