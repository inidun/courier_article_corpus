B razil turns its back on
the Amazon tra d e
For the first time, the Brazilian public has joined the ecological campaign 
to save the rainforest
r a z i l ’s ecologists and rural landowners
will remember 2000 as the year of
c o n f r o n t a t i o n . Both wanted to decide the
future of the world’s biggest biological
r e s e r v e.A mass petition, protest demons-
trations and a torrent of 20,000 e-mail
messages supported the country’s non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and blocked an amendment to the
national forestry regulations that would
have increased by a
quarter the number
of trees that could 
be legally felled in 
the Amazon region,
which lost an esti-
mated 532,000 sq km
of forest between
1978 and 1997.
At the height of
the confrontation last
M a y,a public opinion
poll showed that 88
percent of the elec-
torate would vote
against parliamen-
tary candidates w h o
backed the amend-
m e n t . N i n e t y - t h r e e
percent of those 
questioned said pro-
tecting the environ-
ment did not hinder
the country’s deve-
l o p m e n t ,while 90 per-
cent believed that cut-
ting down more trees would not help
reduce hunger.Even more important was
the finding that in a country where few
people read newspapers, 63 percent said
they had closely followed the debate,
mostly through radio and television reports.
The financial press was firmly against
the amendment too.“ There is not a single
argument that can justify this disastrous
m e a s u r e,” said the influential newspaper
Gazeta Mercantil. “Brazil has plenty of
fertile land.There are more than 100 mil-
lion hectares of unused land alone in the
s e r t ã o,” the scrubland that covers a
quarter of the country.Amazonia has lost
60 percent of its original vegetation
through the spread of soybean farming
and especially pasture land for cattle.
Another major Brazilian newspaper,
O Estado de São Paulo, summed up the
worries about the future with a headline
that asked:“ What kind of air are we going
to breathe?” The popularity of the eco-
logists’ campaign could be seen through
the fact that characters in the cartoon
strip M ó n i c a, which appears in dozens of
n e w s p a p e r s, were dressed in mourning
clothes as a sign of protest.
“ For the first time
Brazilian society is
r e a c t i n g, o r g a n i z i n g
itself and getting
results through a
major campaign that
started inside the
c o u n t r y,”says Eduardo
M a r t i n s,until last year
head of the federal
environment agency,
I BA M A . “In A m a-
z o n i a , the proposed
amendment was de-
nounced by sectors
that have never stirred
b e f o r e, such as the
middle class and the
local media,” d e c l a r e s
biologist A d a l b e r t o
Ve r í s s i m o,a researcher
with the Institute of
People and the Envi-
ronment in A m a z o n i a ,
I M A Z O N, one of the
r e g i o n ’s most respected
N G O s.“Everyone understood that a public
resource was about to be destroyed without
generating any kind of development.”
Brazilian public opinion,which is now
in tune with what many international
bodies and organizations have been advo-
cating for years,has switched as a result of
the economic disaster of unregulated log-
g i n g. Most of the destroyed forest areas
have become pasture land or soybean,
p a l m ,coffee and black pepper plantations.
These foreign crops,which are ill-suited to
poor soil and heavy rains,have had a hard
time growing over two-thirds of the defo-
rested area.Half the 20 million hectares of
pasture are also in a miserable state.
Low yields made farmers look for new
l a n d , causing deforestation to increase
year after year—always in vain,h o w e v e r,
because 78 percent of the soil was too
acidic and had little natural fertility.A l o n g
with this vicious circle, there were trans-
port problems. It takes several days by
river to get from the ranches deep in the
jungle to a port from where crops can be
sent out to domestic and foreign markets.
So although 14 percent of A m a z o-
n i a ’s virgin forest has been destroyed, it is
still a poor area and its 20 million inha-
bitants—three-quarters of whom live in
towns—only produce seven percent of
the country’s GDP. Per capita income
there is below the national average,w h i l e
the region’s main export, Brazil nuts, is
only worth about $3 million, far behind
the $230 million earned from the urban
production of syrups for soft drinks.
The waste of sawmills and 
the defiance of loggers
A recent survey carried out by
IMAZON for the World Bank showed
why farming in the region is so diffic u l t .I t
noted that 18 percent of the Brazilian part
of the Amazon was given over to cattle-rai-
s i n g. That area, in the far south of the
A m a z o n , is the most deforested part and
has a low annual rainfall of 1,800 mm.To
the north is a mixed zone that has a little
more rain and where farming is still fea-
s i b l e, despite a host of insects and plant
d i s e a s e s. In the remaining 45 percent of
Brazilian A m a z o n i a , where heavy rain
falls each day, the only viable large-scale
economic activity is forestry. “Here and
in the mixed zone, logging is as profit a b l e
as agriculture,”says Ve r í s s i m o,one of the
experts involved in the survey.“ That shows
forestry is the best thing for A m a z o n i a .”
But the timber industry has not
managed to make use of this natural
resource without destroying it. N e a r l y
three years ago a European Commission
report blamed the industry for 72 per-
cent of deforestation,and said its activities

were much more harmful to the forests
than felling by farmers or ranchers. Th e
sawmills also waste an enormous amount
of timber, sometimes as much as two-
thirds of the trees felled.Even worse,m o s t
timber firms do not obey the law. “ Th e
strategic affairs ministry says about 80
percent of the timber is illegally chopped
down in the region and forest manage-
ment schemes are mostly ignored,” says a
survey put together by Greenpeace.
What are these schemes? Fi r s t , there is
the battle to keep current forestry regula-
tions on the books and strictly enforce
t h e m . During the 1960s, each landowner
was required to preserve 50 percent of the
forests on his land.As deforestation sped
u p,parliament decreed in 1996 that 80 per-
cent must be preserved. President Fe r-
nando Henrique Cardoso sided with the
e c o l o g i s t s,saying that “forestry regulations
are needed to ensure the survival of A m a-
z o n i a ,which belongs to Brazilians but also
to humanity as a whole.”
A haven for biodiversity is the
last farming frontier
Brazil contains the planet’s richest
biodiversity and the widest range of plant
s p e c i e s. A sixth of all the world’s birds
live there, an eighth of all amphibians,
one in every 11 mammals and a 15th of
the world’s reptiles. Five thousand diffe-
rent kinds of trees grow in the Amazon,
against North America’s 650.
Another scheme currently on the
books is the Pilot Programme to Pre-
serve Tropical Forests, funded by the G7
countries, the European Union and the
Brazilian government,which have toge-
ther contributed $280 million to support
sustainable use of the forests. The pro-
gramme is the biggest multilateral invest-
ment in the environment ever made in a
single country.
As well as these schemes, there is the
Amazon Region Protected Areas Pro-
g r a m m e, backed by Brazil, the Wo r l d
Bank and other international bodies, s u c h
as the World Wildlife Fund and the Wo r l d
Bank Forest Alliance Programme.It aims
to convert 10 percent of Amazonia into
protected areas.Twelve million hectares
are already protected,and the goal is to
increase that to 37 million hectares—an
area the size of Germany.
All these conservation measures are
opposed in varying degrees by A m a z o-
nian landowners, who see the region’s 5.1
million sq kms as the last agricultural fron-
t i e r,with unlimited possibilities for growth.
They say society owes them something for
having stopped felling on part of their lands
to help safeguard the environment, a n d
are demanding monetary compensation.
An all-party parlia-
mentary commission,
headed by the pro-
government centre-right
deputy Mosir Miche-
letto, tabled a draft law
at the end of 1999 to
allow a very flexible
interpretation of the
forestry regulations.
M i c h e l e t t o ’s bill stipu-
lated that half of Ama-
z o n i a ’s ranchland should
remain uncleared, b u t
that Amazonian state
governments would be
able to grant 
special logging conces-
sions on a case by  case
b a s i s.Estates of less than
25 hectares, meanwhile,
would be exempted
from all conservation
regulations.
During a
demonstration in favour of the new pro-
posal last February, 600 members of the
National Agricultural Federation made a
nationalistic protest against what they
called “the harmful interference of
national and foreign ecological organi-
zations in drafting punitive laws which
hinder national development.”
Environment Minister José Sarney
Fi l h o, the National Environment Council
(CONAMA) and the NGOs responded
by pointing out the need to continue pre-
serving 80 percent of the A m a z o n i a n
f o r e s t . For six months, they organized
public debates all over Brazil.
Battles among the region’s
shareholders
The ecologists overwhelmingly sup-
port the government’s stand.Their main
criticism is that the scrubland areas 
of the Amazon must also be safeguarded,
since—contrary to most people’s
beliefs—jungle is not the only native
vegetation in the A m a z o n . E n v i r o n-
mental NGOs say it is not enough to
leave only 35 percent of the ranchland in
this ecosystem untouched, as CONA M A
p r o p o s e s, let alone descend to the 20 per-
cent threshold in the Micheletto pro-
posal.Either way, it would seem hard to
ignore Brazilian public opinion, w h i c h
now broadly agrees with arguments that
until recently were dismissed as unpa-
triotic and slavish to foreign interests. ■
