Su p p o rt e rs of China’s Mat e rnal and Infant Heal-
th Law often argue that the word yousheng i s
mistranslated as “eugenics”,instead of “heal-
t hy birt h ” . Besides the simple observation that a
t e rm has no gi ven meaning outside the context in
which it is used, it might be noted that in European
languages the word “ e u g e n i c s ” also etymologi c a l l y
r e f e rs to “ h e a l t hy birt h ” (Greek root meaning “ g o o d
in birth”).
The term yo u s h e n g appeared in China duri n g
the 1920s when many publications on eugenics we r e
t r a n s l ated or written in Chinese.The intern at i o-
nal eugenics move m e n t , spanning from Swe d e n
to Ja p a n , was embraced by many intellectuals in
C h i n a . Some openly praised Nazi racial policies,
while others adopted a softer approach aimed at
p r e venting “ u n f i t ” individuals from reproducing.
While eugenics became taboo after the communist
t a k e - over in 1949—as it did elsewhere in the wo r l d
gi ven its association with Nazism—it reappeared as
an intrinsic component of the one-child policy of
1978.
Today, large numbers of popular and scientific
p u b l i c ations still hail the British scientist Francis
Galton (1822-1911; Charles Darwin’s cousin, t h e
founder of eugenics) as the father of yousheng w h i c h
they clearly define as the science by which the stat e
can improve the physical and mental features of
its population by selective breeding.
The law ’s support e rs strongly emphasize its reco-
gnition of “individual consent”:but what real effect
can “individual consent” h ave in a one-party stat e
such as China, where political dissent is so often
punished? These support e rs tend not to mention the
half a dozen provincial laws passed since 1988 which
n e ver mention individual wishes: in Gansu prov i n-
c e , for instance, “ i d i o t s ” ,“ c r e t i n s ” and “ i m b e c i l e s ”
(not defined in medical terms) are not allowed to
m a rry unless they have been steri l i z e d .
It is crucial to understand that racism is not a
n e c e s s a ry component of eugenics.Thousands of
individuals judged to be mentally impaired we r e
forcibly sterilized in Scandinavian countries until
the 1960s without being defined as “ r a c i a l l y ”d i f f e-
r e n t .To defend China’s law by arguing that the Han
do not think of themselves as superior to “minori-
t i e s ” is seriously misleading.W hy not ask ethnic
Tibetans what they think about this? 
An inalienable right
Eugenic laws in China fall largely on two gr o u p s :
peasants (about 70 per cent of the population) and
ethnic minori t i e s , (55 groups comprising about eight
per cent of the populat i o n ) . In specialist and popu-
lar publicat i o n s , Chinese geneticists claim to find
higher rates of mental and physical handicap among
the peasantry than the urban populat i o n .They also
claim that there are higher rates among at least some
ethnic minorities in comparison to the majority Han.
These geneticists maintain that the economic back-
wardness of these groups is reinforced by inbree-
d i n g . I would argue that this is no more than a scien-
tized ve rsion of Han prejudice against minori t y
endogamic practices.
“Confucian va l u e s ” are also evoked to justify the
1995 law. China is not frozen in time.To invoke Xun
Zi in the 1990s is as useful as referring to the Spar-
tans to explain Nazi policies. R e p r o d u c t i ve freedom
is not the prerogat i ve of a few privileged cultures, bu t
an inalienable part of individual ri g h t s. C o e r c i ve
methods of controlling population gr owth cannot be
defended on cultural gr o u n d s.The steri l i z ation pro-
grammes used in India during the “ e m e r g e n cy per-
i o d ” in the 1970s, for example, were ove r w h e l m i n-
gly rejected once general elections were held.B e s i d e s ,
research shows that in China and elsewhere indivi-
duals have ve ry different views on the treatment of
handicapped people. In surveys by Chinese resear-
c h e rs in the late 1980s, up to 25 per cent of those
questioned considered life to be sacred in all cir-
c u m s t a n c e s. S e rious birth defects are one of the most
painful challenges any family can fa c e , and all pos-
sible ethical considerations and medical options
should be carefully considered and openly debat e d .
The present eugenic legi s l ation does not reflect this
consensus-making process; it imposes decisions.
E ven in democratic countri e s , m a r gi n a l i z e d
people may be treated in a discri m i n at o ry way, a s
social prejudice and economic interest affect the
n ature of genetic inform ation made available to
fa m i l i e s , e m p l oye rs , insurance companies or we l-
fare stat e s. In a one-party state like China, e u g e-
nic laws have been used to suppress rather than assist
vulnerable people. n
