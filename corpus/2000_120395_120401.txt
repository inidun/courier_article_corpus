“Gl o b a l i z at i o n ” has become today ’s bu z z-
wo r d . It has also become a battle gr o u n d
for two radically opposed gr o u p s.T h e r e
are the “ a n t i - g l o b a l i s t s ” who fear globalization and
stress only its dow n s i d e , seeking therefore powe r f u l
i n t e rventions aimed at taming, if not (unwittingly)
c rippling it.Then there are the “ g l o b a l i s t s ” (a class
to which I belong) who celebrate globalization ins-
tead, emphasize its upside, while seeking only to
ensure that its few rough edges be handled through
a p p r o p ri ate policies that serve to make globalizat i o n
yet more attractive.
Many anti-globalists consider the central pro-
blem of globalization to be its amorality, or even its
immorality. But these critics have too blanket an
approach to globalizat i o n .The word cove rs a va ri e t y
of phenomena that characterize an integr ating wo r l d
e c o n o my : t r a d e , s h o rt - t e rm capital flow s , d i r e c t
foreign investment, immigration, cultural conver-
gence et al.The sins of one of the above cannot be
visited upon the virtues of another. Some are benign
even when largely unregulated whereas others can
be fatal if left wholly to the marketplace.
In part i c u l a r , the freeing of trade is largely
benign: if I exchange some of my toothpaste for
some of your toothbrushes, we will both be better
off than if we did not trade at all.It would require
a wild imagination,and a deranged mind,to think
that such freeing of trade leads to debilitating eco-
nomic crises. But only ideologues would deny that
the hasty freeing of short - t e rm capital flow s ,u n d e r
pressure from what I have called in Foreign Affairs
(May 1998) the US-Treasury Complex, was what
helped to precipitate the huge Asian financial cri s i s.
E q u a l l y, it is illogical to believe , as non-economists
who fear globalization do, t h at freeing of trade is bad
because the freeing of short-term capital flows led
to a debilitating financial and economic crisis and
could do so again. In fact, while there are some
obvious similarities between free trade and free
capital flow s — e . g . t h at segmentation of markets
c r e ates effic i e n cy losses—the economic and political
d i s s i m i l a rities are even more compelling and
policymakers cannot ignore them.
Anti-globalist critics are in fact often reacting
viscerally to a much larger issue: the victory of capi-
talism over its arch ri va l ,c o m m u n i s m . For campus
idealists who have always looked for altern at i ves to
w h at they conventionally consider to be the greed and
lack of social conscience that characterize capita-
l i s m , the situation is psychologically intolerable.
Some have turned to street theat r e , nihilism and the
anti-intellectualism that has been manifest in the
last few ye a rs. The more sophisticated have suc-
cumbed to a stereotypical representation of corp o-
r ations as the “ e v i l ” forces of capitalism that have cap-
tured the stat e , d e m o c r atic institutions, and eve n
i n t e rn ational bodies such as the World Trade Orga-
n i z at i o n .
W h at these critics often forget is that certain eco-
nomic freedoms are basic to prosperity and social
well-being under any conditions, and are thus of the
highest moral va l u e .P r o p e rty rights and markets, f o r
i n s t a n c e ,p r ovide incentives to produce and allocat e
resources effic i e n t l y, and can in turn strengthen
d e m o c r a cy by allowing a means of sustenance out-
side pervasive government structures.The quality
and breadth of democracy can then be enlarged as
excluded gr o u p s , such as women and the poor, a r e

pulled into literacy, gainful employment and better
health through higher public spending or the spread
of economic incentives.
Critics nevertheless go on to maintain that the
global spread of free markets and free trade is res-
ponsible for continuing poverty in poor countries,
and for alleged growth in inequality between and
within countri e s. Labour unions in the rich countri e s
also fear that their workers are being hurt by trade
in cheap labour-using goods from poor countries.
But I do not think these concerns are we l l -
f o u n d e d . In India which has almost a quarter of the
wo r l d ’s poor, there is good evidence that autarchic
and anti-market policies produced abysmally low
gr owth rates at 3.5 per cent annually over a quart e r
of a century, with a correspondingly negligible impact
on pove rt y. Since gr owth rates picked up since the
1 9 8 0 s ,p ove rty has declined. Higher gr owth rates in
t u rn depend on several fa c t o rs ; but openness to
trade and direct investment and a skilful use of mar-
kets are definitely an important contri bu t o ry fa c t o r.
As for inequality among nations, it is precisely
those countries that embraced integration into the
world economy, i . e . the Far Eastern Four and then the
ASEAN countries, which raced ahead with dramatic
gr owth rates whereas several countries of A f ri c a ,
L atin A m e rica and Asia that looked inwards failed to

deliver growth and also made little dent on poverty.
The evidence on trade and investment impove-
rishing our wo r k e rs is also flawe d . My own research
suggests that the dow n ward pressure on wo r k e rs ’
wages due to technical change has been dampened,
not magnifie d , by trade with the poor countri e s.
Research also shows that big corp o r ations use abroad
t e c h n o l o gies similar to those at home, instead of
exploiting lower standards or forcing them yet lowe r
through their financial clout.
One result of these mistaken arguments against
g l o b a l i z ation has been an insistent clamour for cert a i n
e nvironmental and labour standards to be linked to
rules on intern ational trade. But by seeking to creat e
new “ o b s t a c l e s ” to free trade, you undermine the
freeing of trade, while mixing up trade with a moral
agenda undermines that ve ry moral agenda. It gi ve s
other countries the definite impression that yo u
a r e using ethical rhetoric to mask protectionist
s e l f-i n t e r e s t .
The notion that global free trade and inve s t-
ment are responsible for pove rt y, i n e q u a l i t y, l owe ri n g
of standards and harming social progress is little short
of astonishing.Yet it is gi ven curr e n cy by nat i o n a l
politicians and intern ational bu r e a u c r ats who think
t h at going along is a way of getting along. In deny i n g
the virtues of globalizat i o n , they actually harm the
ve ry causes they profess to embrace. ■
