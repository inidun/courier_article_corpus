ASPECTS OF MODERN SCIENCE
THE PRINCIPLE OF INDETERMINACY
ALL natural science is based onobservation. Whether our
knowledge of any segment oí
the external world remains at the
level of a mere cataloguing of
facts, or soars to the heights of
Relativity or of Quantum Theory,
observation of Nature as she really
is constitutes the foundation of
science, and all else is secondary.
There is one aspect of the
business of making observations
that is usually taken for granted,
and that is the faith (for this is all
it amounts to) that any observation
made here and now may be expect-
ed again on any other occasion
when the same conditions prevail.
This proposition is sometimes call-
ed"The Uniformity of Nature"or
the"Constancy of the Universe».
But whether mere faith or someth-
ing else, it works. It is science's
answer to the ancient beliefs in
capricious demons and deities.
Despite the bewildering diffe-
rences between one science and
another, all of them advance lar-
gely by the same general tactics :
observations are made, quantities
are measured (where possible),
results are correlated, theories are
set up and general conclusions are
drawn in the form of natural laws.
The great scientific conquests of
Galileo and Newton, of Darwin and
Pasteur, were made according to
this kind of campaign plan.
A Mechanistic Approach
W HAT we call classical physicsattained a high state of per-
fection toward the end of the last
century. Evolving largely from
ordinary mechanics, it went for-
ward on the assumption that all the
events taking place in space and
by Ira M. FREEMAN
time have the objective character
that we associate with common
mechanical phenomena such as the
falling of a stone or the swinging
of a pendulum.
Early in the nineteenth century
the great French mathematician
and physicist Laplace made the
much-quoted statement that an
omniscient mind, knowing the mo-
mentary location and speed of
every atom in the universe, could
deduce the entire course of events
in the cosmos, both past and future.
The universe was thus viewed as a
machine, with all the parts rigor-
ously interlocked. Every event
was held to be strictly determined
by the preceding one ; every effect
was ascribed to a definite cause.
Later, this mechanistic approach
began to be challenged when
scientists learned to break up the
physical world into its basic consti-
tuents. The ubiquitous quantum
aspect of nature (see"What is the
Quantum Theory"in the Courier
for Nov., 1950) began to assert it-
self once more, and in several
places.
In 1927, a brilliant young theore-
tical physicist, Werner Heisenberg,
was able to state a highly signifi-
cant generalization relative to the
observation and measurement of
elementary processes. It is called
the Principle of Indeterminacy. In
one way of phrasing it, the rule
asserts that the more closely we
determine the location of a particle,
the less accurately are we able to
specify its motion, and vice versa.
Heisenberg contends that the un-
derlying cause of this puzzling
situation is the fact that every
NATURE CONSPIRES TO PREVENT DIRECT OBSERVATION
OF BEHAVIOUR OF SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES
process of measurement or obser-
vation actually interferes with
what is being measured or observ-
ed.
Light of long wavelength does not disturb the
electron we are trying to observe, but neither.
is any of it reflected. The result is that we
do not observe the particle at all !
light of shcrt wavelength can be reflected,
enabling us to observe the electron, but
this kind of radiation is so energetic that it
knocks the particle away. This kind of inter-
ferencg is unavoidable in all atomic measur-
ements.
The Evosfve Electron
F FOR example, if we should wish
to"see"directly a single elec-
tron, it turns out that it would be
necessary to use light of very short
wavelength for the purpose. But
light of this kind is highly energe-
tic, and if thrown at an electron
would knock it completely out of
its original position, thus defeating
what we are trying to accomplish !
In the same way, there is a fun-
damental inexactness, an uncon-
trollable or indefinable element,
inherent in aU measurements relat-
ing to elementary processes. Of
course, in dealing with ordinary
large-scale objects, the interaction
between object and observer be-
comes vanishingly small, and things
seem to behave in their accustomed
way, but on the sub-atomic scale,
the obvious connection between
cause and effect is no longer in
evidence.
After all, nature does seem to be
governed by order and regularity,
and so if strict causality is not va-
lid in the submicroscopic realm,
what takes its place ? The answer
is that what we observe in coarse-
grained experience is a statistical
orderliness-the average beha-
viour of a multitude of individual
entities-and such an average is
accurately predictable. It is pre-
dictable in the same way that the
death rate in a given population
group may be computed in advance
by a life-insurance company, a :-
though there is no way of forecast-
ing when a given individual is
going to die.
Chance rules the activity of the
individual sub-atomic particles of
physics, but their "cultural" or
"crowd"behaviour, as mirrored by
the large-scale world of ordinary
experience, turns out to be comple-
tely in accord with expectation.
The recognition of this fact has
been of vast importance to the
development of modern science,
and has had profound and far-
reaching effects on philosophical
thinking as well.
