BRI TA IN: SEX EDUCAT ION
UNDER FIRE
◗ Jon Slater
The government’s blueprint to improve knowledge of sexual and reproductive health matters
and reduce teenage pregnancy has sparked a virulent debate
■
With 65 conceptions per thousand
women aged between 15 and 19 in
1 9 9 8 , England and Wales has the
highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western
Europe.1 This rate rose by four per cent in
the space of one year.
But while everyone agrees on the need
for action, there is a wide spectrum of opin-
ion on how to deal with the problem. A t
the heart of the debate is whether inform a-
tion or innocence is the best way of pro-
tecting Bri t a i n ’s children from the prob-
lems associated with teenage sex.
In the blue corner are the family values
c a m p a i g n e rs , led by churches, the Conser-
vative Party and the high-circulation Daily
M a i l n e w s p a p e r. While in the red corn e r
are those who believe that the only way to
tackle issues such as teenage pregnancy and
sexual health is to provide accurate non-
judgmental inform at i o n .The latter includes
most children’s chari t i e s , the liberal wing
of the Labour Pa rty and the department of
h e a l t h . “The more inform ation young peo-
ple have , the less likelihood there is that
teenage girls will become pregnant,” s ay s
Anna Coote, director of the King’s Fund, a
health think-tank. “It doesn’t look like what
we are doing at the moment is wo r k i n g,
particularly in secondary schools.”
Poverty and
social exclusion
Caught in the crossfire between these two
camps are Labour ministers wa ry of offend-
ing the right-wing press and keen to hold
together their “ o n e - n at i o n ” coalition which
swept them to power in 1997 after 18 ye a rs
in the wildern e s s.But much as it may like to,
the gove rnment cannot stay above the fray.
Cutting the number of teenage pregnancies
is vital if it is to meet its targets of reducing
child pove rty and social exclusion.
The gove rnment has pledged to halve
teenage pregnancy rates by 2010 and is
expecting to reduce by 2,000 the number of
girls who become pregnant this ye a r. I n
J u n e1 9 9 9 , the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU),
a gove rnment body which reports directly to
P rime Minister To ny Blair,produced a blue-
p rint for tackling Bri t a i n ’s alarmingly high
number of teenage pregnancies. Its conclu-
sions were stark. “ Too many teenagers are
being pressured into having sex rather than
really choosing to, are not using contracep-
t i o n , and are, as a result, ending up pregnant
or with a sexually transmitted infection.”
According to Jill Francis of the Nat i o n a l
C h i l d r e n ’s Bureau, “There are four main
reasons why girls in Britain become preg-
n a n t .We don’t gi ve children enough infor-
m at i o n ; we gi ve them mixed messages about
sex and relat i o n s h i p s ; social depri vat i o n
means girls are more likely to become preg-
n a n t ; and girls whose mothers were teenage
mums are more likely to do the same.”B o t h
teenage mothers and fat h e rs come pre-
dominantly from lower social classes.
According to the Children’s Bureau,
“teenage mothers are less academically able
than their childless contemporaries and
more likely to leave school at the earliest
o p p o rtunity with few or no qualific at i o n s.”
One national study suggests that a quar-
ter of teenage mothers were themselve s
b o rn to teenagers. The brutal fact is that
teenage parenthood helps to ensure that
those at the bottom of the social pile stay
t h e r e . Policies such as the New Deal for
Lone Parents (which gives young mothers
i n f o rm at i o n , training and other help to fin d
wo r k ) , i m p r oved parenting advice and
increased availability of childcare are all
designed to help young parents escape this
trap. But they are costly. Ministers would
prefer prevention to cure.
So far howe ve r , they are running into stiff
o p p o s i t i o n . One of the SEU’s central rec-
o m m e n d ations was to extend sex educat i o n
in pri m a ry schools. But it did not take long
for Education Secretary David Blunkett to
b a c k t r a c k ,s aying that he did not want chil-
dren under ten to have their “age of inno-
c e n c e ” taken away from them.While in pri n-
ciple pri m a ry school students learn about
h ow a baby is conceived and born , the SEU
r e p o rt observed that thousands of ten- and

1.The Office for National Statistics also reports
that 37.8 per cent of these conceptions led to an
abortion. For comparison’s sake, it should be
noted that the conception rate in North America
stands at 83.6 per 1,000 women aged between 15
and 19, and at 101.7 in the Russian Federation,
according to data from the Alan Guttmacher
Institute (www.agi-usa.org).

e l e ve n - year-olds receive no inform at i o n
about peri o d s , despite the fact that one in
ten girls starts menstru ating before fin i s h-
ing pri m a ry school.
Nor can secondary schools rest on their
l a u r e l s. “ We ’re not good at talking to yo u n g
people about sex.Lack of sex education is an
i m p o rtant contri bu t o ry factor in individu-
als getting pregnant,” s ays Francis.Sex edu-
c ation is compulsory in secondary school,
but parents have the right to withdraw their
children from lessons. The curri c u l u m
c h i e fly focuses on the reproductive system
and how the foetus develops in the uteru s ,
along with the physical and emotional
changes that take place during adolescence.
A nything beyond this is discretionary,
including contraception, safe sex and access
to local advice and treatment serv i c e s.
S e veral studies into unplanned teenage
pregnancies point to a lack of inform at i o n
about contraceptive use and embarr a s s m e n t
about discussing contraception with a part-
n e r. In Fe b ru a ry 2000, the Unive rsity of
B righton conducted a survey of nearly 700
pupils between 14 and 15 that revealed a
d e e p - s e ated anger about sex education in
their schools. Girls felt that classes focused
on the mechanics of sex and contraception
r ather than on emotions. B oys claimed they
were denied access to inform ation judged
too explicit. The majority were “ f u ri o u s ”
because they felt legi s l at i o n , such as that
which requires teachers to inform pupils’
parents if asked about contraception, h a s
stopped them from gaining access to infor-
m at i o n . Schools are expected to inform par-
ents when a pupil tells a teacher they are hav-
ing sex or asks about contraception in all bu t
the “most exceptional circumstances”.
The topic of sex education is all the
more sensitive at the moment as it has
been clubbed together with another row,
which has centred on the gove rn m e n t ’s
proposed repeal of Section 28 of the 1988
Local Gove rnment A c t , which bans the
promotion of homosexuality by local
a u t h o ri t i e s. Passed under the T h at c h e r
g ove rn m e n t , this clause is judged dis-
c ri m i n at o ry by the present Labour major-
i t y. Although not directly related to the
g ove rn m e n t ’s dri ve to reduce teenage
p r e g n a n c i e s , it has sparked heated debat e .
The House of Lords (the upper house of
parliament) has repeatedly rejected the
g ove rn m e n t ’s push to repeal the clause.
To break the deadlock, the gove rn m e n t ,i n
c o n s u l t ation with church leaders , h a s
come up with new guidelines on sex edu-
c ation in schools that would become
statutory—obliging all teachers to adopt
them—if they are passed. They wo u l d
notably oblige teachers to teach about the
i m p o rtance of marriage and stable rela-
tionships.
Morning-after trials
Many teachers in Britain feel that they
are already being asked to single-handedly
tackle society’s ills and are reluctant to
accept responsibility for reducing the rate of
teenage pregnancies as we l l .“ Teenage preg-
nancy is a major social issue which educa-
tion alone cannot solve ,” said a spokes-
woman for the A s s o c i ation of Te a c h e rs and
L e c t u r e rs. “This is a cross-depart m e n t a l
i s s u e , we need more joined-up thinking.”
The ATL is concerned that the new statu-
t o ry guidelines would undermine teachers ’
ability to conduct sex education we l l . “ I f
there are legal constraints, t e a c h e rs will not
have the confidence to teach it well.”
Coote agrees that more is needed than
just improving sex education.“There are a
number of fa c t o rs at wo r k . People don’t
feel the services on offer are properly acces-
sible to them. Professionals often don’t
speak their language, either literally or
m e t a p h o ri c a l l y.” M e a n w h i l e , as debate ove r
the guidelines lingers on, the department of
health has approved trials in some parts of
the country making the morning-after pill
available from pharmacies—including to
s c h o o l girls as young as 14. D o c t o rs usually
p r e s c ribe this pill.The initiat i ve has sparked
a media backlash and it is by no means cer-
tain that it will be extended nat i o n - w i d e .
But the government holds firm to its line.
As the SEU report stat e s , “preaching is
rarely effective . Whether the gove rn m e n t
likes it or not, young people decide what
they’re going to do about sex and contra-
c e p t i o n . Keeping them in the dark or
preaching at them makes it less likely they’ll
make the right decision.” ■
Teenage mothers receive guidance and support at a specialised centre in Leeds, in northern England.
