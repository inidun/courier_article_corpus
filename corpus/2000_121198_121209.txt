L ebo Sekoto is an upwardly mobile young
w o m a n , a 28-year-old senior human
resources consultant at a large mining
corporation in Pretoria. She is now inter-
nationally mobile too, she says, t h a n k s
to the arrival of Britain’s De Montfort University.
It is one of hundreds of further and higher educa-
tion institutions—local and foreign—that have set
up shop in South A f r i c a .
Now nearing the end of a part-time MBA ,L e b o
offers good reasons for choosing De Montfort.“I
want to expand my horizons and work for a multi-
national corporation and gain experience in the
United Kingdom.So I thought it fitting to obtain a
globally portable U.K.qualification.” In fact Lebo,
born in the sprawling black township of Soweto,h a s
been studying most of her life.
After leaving school she obtained a business
diploma at a polytechnic. Then came a part-time
degree in industrial psychology and business mana-
gement through the distance University of South
A f r i c a ,and now the MBA ,which combines part-time
and on-line study. “Companies see you as a young
black female fir s t ,”she says,“irrespective of your qua-
l i fic a t i o n s. If I want to move up the ladder to become
a chief executive, I have to be three times more qua-
l i fied and experienced than male colleagues.”
De Montfort (450 students in South Africa of
whom 65 percent are black) is one of several foreign
institutions now operating in South A f r i c a ’s private
s e c t o r. It is unusual in being non-profit and aiming to
build management skills in this developing country:
most others, local and foreign,are straight businesses.
It was also the first private institution to be registered
in South Africa under new laws aimed at regulating
the growth and quality of private higher education,
which is burgeoning here as it is in many other coun-
tries—to the point of threatening the viability of
many public institutions.
“Our public sector is immature, so we are imple-
menting new policies to develop it,” says Professor
Nasima Badsha, the government’s deputy director-
general in charge of higher education.“Much of the
private sector is for- p r o fit and market-driven, a n d
does not share our commitment to access, e q u i t y,
quality and human resource development. S u c h
concerns are shared by a number of countries in the
s o u t h .” Fees for private institutions tend to be 30 to
50 percent higher than those for state institutions.
After the dismantling of apartheid,
the foreign influx begins 
It is not known exactly how many private tertiary
institutions are currently operating. In higher edu-
c a t i o n , 100 of more than 200 institutions that applied
for accreditation have been or are well on the way to
being registered.The private higher education insti-
tutions have more than 20,000 full-time students in
South A f r i c a , which last year had 564,000 students in
the public sector.Hundreds of thousands are enrolled
in private part-time higher education courses and a
vast number of further education courses ranging

ning quality,disruption and lack of safety in the state
s e c t o r.
With an unemployment rate near 30 percent
and the formal economy absorbing only 56 percent
of students from top universities—and 25 percent
from less respected ones—students seek “ m a r k e-
t a b l e ”q u a l i fications that vocationally oriented poly-
technics and private institutions are seen to offer.
Many people see foreign degrees as more prestigious
and portable than local ones, while others view them
as an emigration ticket to a richer country.
Most of the private institutions are genuine, b u t
fly-by-night operators are a problem. The 1997
Higher Education Act is supposed to weed them out
by requiring that all private institutions seek course
accreditation from the South African Qualific a-
tions Au t h o r i t y. They must also register with the
education department, which has two criteria for
acceptance: financial viability and quality.
“ Foreign institutions posed a particular threat
to public universities,” says Professor Badsha.“ Th e y
mostly operate in a narrow range of areas,e s p e c i a l l y
I T, business and commerce,‘cherry picking’ fin a n-
wealthy can afford, resulting in a new form of apar-
theid, says Badsha.“We are trying to move away
from race and class to create truly South African ins-
titutions.”
As a result, the government is amending the
act to make it more difficult for foreign institutions
to set up in South A f r i c a . For example,before gran-
ting permits, the registrar will judge whether the
applicant is useful to the public system and broadens
the scope of courses offered. Even though South
A f r i c a ’s constitution prohibits discrimination against
foreign institutions, some of them have threatened
to take the issue to the World Trade Organization.
Indeed many foreign institutions have already left.
Education Minister Kader Asmel strongly
rejects claims that the clampdown is motivated by
“narrow protectionist agendas or national chauvi-
n i s m .” The goal, he says, is simply to assure the
accountable and efficient use of public resources.
“ We do not wish to turn a blind eye to supra-
national developments, or build new walls around
ourselves. But we cannot stand by and watch the
erosion of our system.” ■

from literacy to art, computing and business.
The influx of foreign institutions began after the
n a t i o n ’s first democratic elections in 1994.With the dis-
mantling of apartheid, black students shifted away
from poorly resourced “ b l a c k ” institutions to well-
endowed formerly “ w h i t e ”o n e s, while many mostly
middle-class white students moved to private institu-
t i o n s, due to perceptions—hotly denied—of decli-
cially lucrative courses without the obligation of offering the
full range of disciplines. Public universities found themselves
losing income-earning courses they use to cross-subsidize
expensive disciplines such as music and art, medicine and
e n g i n e e r i n g,which are critical to South A f r i c a ’s cultural, s o c i a l
and economic development.”
Foreign institutions also attract good staff from public uni-
versities by paying higher salaries,and charge fees that only the
