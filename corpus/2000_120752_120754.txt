sigh of relief ripples across Europe as
engineers prepare to shut down Cher-
n o b y l , the world’s most feared nuclear
power plant, on December 15th. Politi-
cians have finally brokered a deal in
which Western donors foot the bill of
about two billion dollars to close and
fully entomb the Ukrainian reactors.Ye t
for many ordinary citizens, the nightmare
continues.
Just a few months ago, on April 26th,
thousands marched solemnly through the
towns of Belarus, Ukraine and eastern
Russia to commemorate the dead from
the nuclear disaster 14 years before. At
1:26 am bells tolled to mark the moment
when a Chernobyl reactor blew and a
deadly radioactive fall-out began to
blanket their fields and towns.
But as well as mourning, there was
f e a r. Fear of the continuing radiation,
which could claim thousands more.And
fear of speaking out of turn. That night,
Yuri Bandazhevsky, rector of the Gomel
Medical Institute in Belarus until his
arrest last year, was in forced internal
exile in the capital of Minsk. He is one of
many researchers who say their work has
been suppressed or ignored by govern-
ments anxious to play down the radia-
tion risks their citizens still face.
Estimates of the death toll to date
range from the 32 offered by U N n u c l e a r
scientists to the 15,000 suggested by some
Ukrainian researchers. In Ju n e, s c i e n t i s t s
at the U N’s Scientific Committee on the
Effects of Atomic Radiation (U N S C E A R)
reported that “there is no evidence of a
major public health impact attributable to
r a d i a t i o n , apart from a high level of thy-
roid cancer in children [from which] few
should die.” Yet the previous day the U N
S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l ,Ko fiA n n a n ,a p p e a r e d
to disagree when he said:“ The catastrophe
is far from over. It continues to have a
devastating effect not only on the health
of the people, but on every aspect of
s o c i e t y.”So what is the truth? And how do
these disparities arise?

power plant reduced the Number Four
reactor to an inferno spewing out a radio-
active cloud for ten days. It released a
hundred times more radioactivity than
the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki combined. For several days
there was total silence, before the panic
evacuation of some 116,000 people from
an exclusion zone that stretched up to
30 kilometres from the plant.
Only years after the accident did the
public learn that a larger zone some 150
kilometres away near the Belarus town of
Gomel and extending into Russia suf-
fered heavy fall-out in rain shortly after
the accident. It emerged in 1989 that a
fifth of Belarus had been signific a n t l y
c o n t a m i n a t e d . Some 400,000 people were
r e s e t t l e d .And today around four million
people still live in areas with some ack-
nowledged contamination.
O f ficial secrecy inside the Soviet Union
and its successor governments about the
extent of the contamination continues to
bedevil the task of keeping people safe,
says Greenpeace’s Chernobyl specialist
Tobias Muenchmeyer.Researchers inside
the affected countries agree.“A regime of
s e c r e cy was accepted in our country from
the very first second the catastrophe hap-
p e n e d ,”says Vladimir Chernousenko, t h e
Ukrainian scientist who co-ordinated the
post-accident clean-up.
A partial information blackout by
g o v e r n m e n t s, combined with scientific
c a u t i o n , has helped lead U N agencies into
seriously underestimating the death toll,
Muenchmeyer believes. Critics of the
nuclear industry such as Rosalie Bertell,
president of the International Institute
of Concern for Public Health in To r o n t o,
say there is another political reason.Th e y
point to a 1959 agreement between the
International Atomic Energy A g e n cy and
the World Health Organization, w h i c h
said that “the I A E A had the primary res-
ponsibility for encouraging,assisting and
co-ordinating research on, and the deve-
lopment and practical application of
atomic energy.”According to Bertell,“ t h e
I A E A has since considered itself to be the
watchdog over information about radia-
tion health effects which is distributed to
the public.” Bertell and other organiza-
tions this year called for the W H O t o
amend the agreement.
The most important radioactive iso-
topes released at Chernobyl were iodine
and caesium. Iodine-131 has a half-life
(the time it takes for half the atoms of a
radioactive isotope to decay) of eight
days. It was mostly inhaled and eaten in
contaminated food. Caesium-137 has a
half-life of some 30 years. It is still present
in soils and vegetation and continues to
contaminate people through foodstuff.
Some lesser isotopes have half-lives of
hundreds or even thousands of years.
C o n t ro v e rsy over 
the casualty list
Who suffered? In the front line were
the “liquidators”—the estimated 600,000
to 800,000 soldiers and public employees
drafted in to make the reactor safe and
bury contaminated waste. Some 50,000 of
them worked on top of the reactor.“ Th e y
were supposed to stay on the roof to fig h t
the fire for only 90 seconds, then be
r e p l a c e d . One can easily guess this did
not happen,” says Jean-Pierre Revel,
senior health official at the International
Federation of the Red Cross.As a result,
237 liquidators were hospitalized;32 died.
But since then, the Soviet Union and
its successors have been unable or
unwilling to keep track of this most-at-
risk group. According to Leonid Ilyin, a
former Russian member of the Interna-
tional Commission on Radiological Pro-
t e c t i o n ,“none of these men was registered
by name. None was checked [for subse-
quent health] on a regular basis.They all
went back to their homes.”This failure is
probably the largest organizational cause
of the disputes over Chernobyl’s death
t o l l .Last A p r i l ,Viacheslav Grishin,p r e s i-
dent of the Chernobyl League—a Kiev-
based organization that claims to represent
the liquidators—said 15,000 liquidators
had died and 50,000 were handicapped.
His source was a controversial estimate by
C h e r n o u s e n k o, based on likely cancer
rates from radiation doses that he believes
the liquidators received.
Cancers have been the biggest long-
term medical fear. By 1991, doctors were
reporting many cases of thyroid cancer
among children under four at the time of
the disaster. In 1992,a group of Western
researchers, including Keith Baverstock
of the WHO, agreed that Chernobyl was
the likely cause. Yet it was only in 1995,
after some 800 cases had emerged, that
the UN system formally accepted the fin-
the surface.

d i n g.This delay had serious implications
in finding and treating the disease, w h i c h
is not fatal if caught early enough.
Playing politics and
crushing dissent
The conclusion had been initially
controversial partly because the evidence
from Hiroshima and Nagasaki suggested
that there should be far fewer cases. B u t
politics also entered the equation. Th e
E c o n o m i s t magazine speculated that “ i f
the health risks have been underestimated
or understated, the American govern-
ment could face new lawsuits on every-
thing from the Nevada [nuclear] tests to
the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in
1 9 7 9 .”
At any rate, there are now some 1,800
recorded cases of thyroid cancer attri-
buted to Chernobyl. In the most conta-
minated districts, such as Gomel, c h i l d-
hood rates are 200 times those in western
E u r o p e. Estimates of the total number of
cases expected to arise in the future range
from a “few thousand,” suggested by the
I A E A, 


to the 66,000 predicted for a single
group—Belarusian children under four
at the time of the disaster—by W H O s c i e n-
tist Elisabeth Cardis, who stressed that
“the risk estimates are very uncertain.”
What about other cancers which take
longer to develop? Offic i a l l y, the W H O
stands by its assessment of 1996 that while
“there have been some reports of
increases in the incidence of specific mali-
gnancies in some populations living in
contaminated territories and in liquida-
t o r s, these reports are not consistent and
could reflect differences in the follow-up
of exposed populations.” But some of its
scientists are sceptical.They ask not what
can be proved,but what can be expected
on the basis of known science.
Based on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
Baverstock expects an “ e x c e s s ” of some
6,600 fatal cancers, including 470 leu-
kaemia cases. But a team of Belarusian
doctors claims to have found leukaemia
rates four times the national average
among heavily exposed liquidators.A n d
there are fears that,as with thyroid cancer,
rates could be far higher than expected.
But scientific uncertainty should not
detract from the fact that there are poli-
tical reasons why the truth about the
disaster may remain hidden, s a y s
Muenchmeyer of Greenpeace. National
g o v e r n m e n t s, who act as gatekeepers for
most of the statistics reaching U N a g e n c i e s,
have a political agenda, he says. Th e
Ukraine is running 14 nuclear reactors
with another four under construction,
according to the IAEA. “So the Ukraine
d o e s n ’t want to ruin the image of nuclear
power by stressing the harm done by
C h e r n o b y l ,” says Muenchmeyer, “ b u t
they also want aid for health programmes.
So then they are interested in showing the
b u r d e n .Often they contradict themselves
within a few days.”
The Belarus government has consis-
tently downplayed the disaster, e v e n
though the country received an estimated
70 per cent of the fall-out.“ They decided
that the territory and the number of
people affected are so great, and the
government so poor, that they cannot
solve the problem.They decided to shut
down dissent,” says Muenchmeyer. This
has hampered research and apparently
prevented findings by local scientists from
reaching UN agencies.
Two years ago, Rosa Goncharova of
the Institute of Genetics and Cytology
in Minsk reported evidence that conge-
nital abnormalities were turning up in
the children of those irradiated by Cher-
nobyl. She told a conference that since
1985, cases of cleft palate, Down’s syn-
drome and other deformities had
increased by 
83 per cent in the areas most heavily
c o n t a m i n a t e d , 30 per cent in moderately 
contaminated areas and 24 per cent in
“clean”areas.
But two years later, when contacted
for this article, Cardis of the WHO said
she had “not received copies of the
p a p e r ” by Goncharova. Nor had she
received copies of work by the director of
the independent Belarusian Institute of
Radiation Safety (Belrad),Vasily Neste-
r e n k o. He had found that in the most
contaminated areas, the incidence of
diseases of the circulatory system had
risen fourfold and deaths among children
from respiratory diseases were up 14-
fold (see interview).
The dangers of the
twilight zone
And consider the fate of Yuri Ban-
d a z h e v s k y, whose case has been taken
up by Amnesty International.As rector of
the Gomel Medical Institute, he carried
out autopsies at the city’s forensic
m o r g u e, on bodies whose deaths were
not considered connected to Chernobyl.
He examined their internal organs and
compared them to the organs of rats that
he had fed grain containing radioactive
c a e s i u m .He was shocked by his fin d i n g s :
“ The pathological modifications of the
kidneys, heart,liver and lungs was iden-
tical to those among the experimental
r a t s.” From this he concluded,“that accu-
mulation of radiocaesium in the organs
played a major role in the triggering of
pathological responses.” In other words,
it made them ill and even killed them.
His paper went ignored. His subse-
quent criticism of the post-Chernobyl
research conducted by the Ministry of
Health brought him more enemies.And
last summer he was arrested on unspeci-
fied bribery charges, and locked up for six
m o n t h s. His computer and all his fil e s
were confiscated and he remains confin e d
Lethally close to Chernobyl, the abandoned city of Pripiat in Ukraine.

to Minsk “under investigation.”
People are still being exposed to
radiation from Chernobyl. In large areas
of Belarus in particular the environment
is still heavily contaminated. The W H O
says “some foods produced by private
farmers do exceed [WHO limits].” But it
points out that most large farms mini-
mize take-up of radioactivity in soils by
deep ploughing and applying fertilizers.
“No food produced by collective farms
now exceeds the limits.”
But thousands of people rely on pri-
vate farms, according to Belrad’s Neste-
r e n k o, who maintains that a quarter of
the food grown inside the contaminated
zone supersedes official radioactivity
l i m i t s. More than 500 villages are drin-
king contaminated milk.M o r e o v e r,m a n y
people rely on “ w i l d ” produce such as
m u s h r o o m s, berries and hunted meat—
the most risky food of all says the WHO’s
B a v e r s t o c k .
A n d , of course, there are the people
who return to live a twilight life inside
the exclusion zone, replanting their
contaminated gardens, gathering food
from the forests and raiding abandoned
food stores. Most are old women, w h o
judged that the radioactivity could do
them little harm at their age.But there are
recent unconfirmed reports of a baby
being born there. The tragedy, as Ko fi
Annan said, goes on. ■
