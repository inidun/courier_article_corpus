THE REFIJGEES WHO
LEARNED TO "THINK
WITH THEIR HANDS"
SINCE its creation in 1947, the Inter-
national Refugee Organization
(IRO) has helped to resettle hun-
dreds of thousands of refugees and
displaced persons in all parts of the
world. There are others, however,
for whom it has not been possible
to find new homes, because of their
age or infirmities. For these men
and women the IRO has taken special
measures.
Just a year ago, on February 2B,
1950, M. Robert Schumann, French
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
Mr. J. Donald Kingsley, Director-
General of IRO, signed an agree-
ment. By its terms, France accepted
responsibility for all refugees living
within its frontiers while the IRO
agreed to devote funds towards the
setting up of special refugee centres
which would later be turned over to
France.
The article below describes the
work of one such centre opened
recently in France, where physically
handicapped refugees are equipped
for a new start in life.
"I'd probably have got alongall right, but for this old
peg", said the man tapping
his artificial leg.
"I ask you", he went on,"who'd
choose a man 1l'ith one leg when
the world is full of healthy bipeds ?
For chaps like us-maimed,
wounded, sick-the chances of
emigrating are nil."
"Yet", he added,"there are
trades where you don't have to walk
a hundred yards. But no selection
board will consider us. I myself
am game to tackle anything, but
I've had absolutely no experience
of the sort of job where you're
glued to a des/c all day. So, there
just didn't seem to be any way out.
Then, one day, I heard about the
centre at Valence. Now, every-
thing's going fine".
He laughed and handed me a
watch that he had been regulating
while he talked ; its regular ticking
seemed to give him enormous sat-
isfaction.
He was a man of about 40, with
one of those unpronounceable names
bristling with contradictory conso-
nants. He spoke fluent French, in
which the slang of Paris was mixed
with the accent of Warsaw.
Other men were busy at work
around him. I learned that the Bait
had been in a sanatorium, that the
Slovak had heart trouble, that all
these men without a country were
victims of some physical disability
which precluded them from return-
ing to their old way of life. Then
came this chance to learn a new
trade adapted to their capabilities
in the rehabilitation centre opened
by the International Refugee Organ-
ization (IRO) near Valence in south
east France.
Finding The Right Men
WITH men of so many national-ities and pr fessional b ck-
grounds, of varying physical capa-
cities and assorted ages, it's no
easy task to seek out those capable
of becoming technicians in the
watch-making industry. Setection
is made through a series of tests.
Adaptation follows, care being
taken to guide the newcomer
towards that specialized branch
community basis, the Centre for
Vocational Rehabilitation (Centre
de Rééducation Professionnelle)
came into being near Valence,
to which he is most suited. It re-
quires plenty of tact and a great
deal of patience.
One must know when a begin-
ner, who might otherwise be dis-
couraged by the magnitude of the
task in front of him, should be in-
troduced to his particular training
at some intermediate stage ; an in-
tellectual, on the other hand, must
be persuaded that there is nothing
demeaning in the idea of"thinking
with his hands".
In planning the Centre, the pro-
moters considered that it was ne-
cessary to create not merely a re-
classification centre like others
that have been established bv the
IRO near its German and Austrian
camps. They therefore decided
to treat these reclassification acti-
vities as the first step towards the
formation of a vital permanent
community centre, a small self-gov-
erning city, where the refugees,
finally settled and equipped with a
trade, could enjoy conditions of
work and a degree of self-respect
to which everyone aspires.
A Community Altair
A FRENCH organization, "MutualCommunity Assistance" (En-
tr'aide Communautaire), accepted
the task of carrying out the plan,
using the experience it had gained
in its successful community work
centre at Boimondeau. Thus, on a
At present the refugees are given
technical training in the making of
main watch parts from gold watch
cases to dial faces. The latter re-
quires skilful use of a pressing ma-
chine which, with delicate preci-
sion, prints the watch face. Later,
when they have completed their
training the school will become a
community undertaking, the mana-
gement becoming the responsibility
of the ex-pupils, with the excep-
tion of those who have chosen to
employ their new found trade
elsewhere.
The school is established in a
fine old estate just outside Valence.
The main building contains the
offices, reading room, bar and
sleeping quarters of those pupil-
guests whose health needs the most
care. The others have sunny, in-
dividual rooms in buildings front-
ing on a lawn. At the other end
of the park, hidden by high trees,
are the workshops.
It's a pleasure to see pupils so
contentedly and industriouslv at
work with their modern equip-
ment. The teachers, accustomed
to younger and often less attentive
pupils, are delighted with their
keenness and enthusiasm.
I stopped in one of the workshops
to talk to an elderly Swiss
watchmaker."The way we teach",
he told me,"makes allowance for
the fact that our students are
adults. We are not training them
as apprentices but as fully qualified
technicians who will later be
given a chance to talre part
in the workshop management.
And we don't follow the usual
practice of watchmaking schools :
here, no one works for nothing
during the training period, for this
can give the idea that it's of no
consequence if a watch part is
bungled. Each pupil passes
through successive stages of all
branches of watchmaking ; and
when all the parts are finnlly as-
sembled, he sees how individual
bad workmanship can spoil the
work as a whole".
just One \week"
I x another outbuilding I saw pu-pil-watchmakers being giyen a
lesson in elementary French. In
the most advanced class of all, talks
are given on literature, so that
those with intellectual tastes and
backgrounds can re-discover the
same cultural level in this new life
to which they must now adapt
themselves.
"'F auld you like to meet someone
in your own line of work", asked
my guide. He led me in front of
one of the machine-tools and intro-
duced me to the man who was
working it-a former Polish
journalist.
"At first it was pretty hard", the
journalist told me. "I thought I
would never get the hang of it.
But it comes, little by little..."
"You're too modest", replied my
guide,"too modest and too impa-
tint". Then to me :"Look at this
adjustment he's just done. It's abso-
lutely accurate. And do you know
how long he's been working with
his hands ? Just one week!"

1 NEW SKILLS - AND HOPES : Men of many nationalities and professionalbackgrounds learn to become pr fessional watchmakers in the IRO rehabi-
titation centre near Valence, France.
TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION is given in the making of main watch parts.
Here, some are being turned on lathes in the centre's modern workshops.
REFUGEES ARE TRAINEO in each stage of watchmaking. This pupil
 is using a pressing machine which with delicate precision prints the watch
face.
MEN WITHOUT A COUNTRY develop a new confidence in themselves
and in the the future as their training equips them for a speciatized trade. The
centre near Valance is to become a permanent community in whose management
the ex-pupils will share.
