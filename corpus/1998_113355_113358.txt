Feeding the world is one of the big
challenges of the next century.
Pa r a d ox i c a l l y, whereas the planet’s
fa rm e rs actually produce more food than
world population needs, about 800 mil-
lion people are chronically undern o u ri-
shed and two billion suffer from malnu-
t ri t i o n , nearly all of them in the poor
c o u n t ries of the South.
The number of mouths to feed is
expected to increase by almost 100 mil-
lion annually in the next thirty ye a rs. A
worldwide short fall in production is not
yet the main cause of hunger, but output
will have to be stepped up in the first half
of the next century.
The area of cropland will cert a i n l y
h ave to be expanded, but a limit will
quickly be reached. B i o d i ve rsity is
already under threat ; d e f o r e s t ation causes
erosion and impove rishes soil, i rri g at i o n
leads to salinization and water resources
are shri n k i n g . To d ay fa rm e rs are also
required to respect the environment and
the health of consumers. In the 1960s,
the “ green revo l u t i o n ” was about maxi-
mizing production by using massive
quantities of fert i l i z e rs , pesticides and
other inputs. The downside of this race 
to boost output was that it generat e d
p o l l u t i o n .
M a s s i ve inputs did not eliminate crop
l o s s e s , which are still considerable, ru n-
ning in the early 1990s to 42 per cent of
all the wheat , rice and maize harve s t e d
wo r l d w i d e .Would it not be best to enable
plants to fight diseases and pests by
t h e m s e l ves? This is the proposal of the
transgenic revolution which is curr e n t l y
sweeping the world of agri c u l t u r e .
In 1953 James Watson (USA) and
Francis Crick (UK) discovered the spi-
ral structure of deox y ribonucleic acid
( D N A ) , but it was not until thirty ye a rs
l ater that the first gene transfer wa s
m a d e , in the laborat o ry, on a tobacco
p l a n t .The first field tests were conducted
in 1987 and the technique then took off.
A decade lat e r , genetically modified
crops were gr owing on 15 million hec-
tares of land around the globe. In 1998,
United States fa rm e rs alone sowed 20
million hectares of genetically modifie d
m a i z e , s oya and cotton. Argentina and
Brazil have accepted genetically modifie d
organisms (GMOs), and so have China
and A u s t r a l i a . By the year 2000, g e n e t i-
cally modified crops are expected to be
gr owing on 60 million hectares wo r l d-
wide–81 per cent of them in North A m e-
ri c a , 10 per cent in
Asia and one per cent
in Europe. In the Uni-
ted States alone, t h e y
will comprise a $100-
billion market over the
next decade.

light of all these barri e rs. T h e o r e t i c a l l y
gene transfer makes all kinds of things
p o s s i b l e . Plants are already capable of
producing haemoglobin, a gr owth hor-
m o n e , and human insulin.
The support e rs of transgenic agri c u l-
ture point to other adva n t a g e s. If a plant
has a gene which resists certain pests, t h e r e
is no need for it to be
treated with a chemical
which threatens the
health of the person who
applies it and pollutes
soil and wat e r.It can also
be given a gene to make
it resistant to a herbicide,
enable it to survive cold
or drought, and eve n
change its taste or nutri-
tional qualities.
So are GMOs the
key to the future of
a griculture? Cert a i n l y

Genetically modified plants are being developed so quickly that they
could become the backbone of tomorrow’s agriculture. For better or

rise and they will have to sign contracts
with transnational firms like Monsanto,
N ova rt i s , A gr E vo, D u p o n t , Pioneer or
R h ô n e - Poulenc and buy seeds from them
e ve ry ye a r , as well as the herbicides the
plants are treated to resist. One example
is Round-Up Ready, the genetically
modified rapeseed produced by Mon-
s a n t o, which is resistant to Round-Up, a
herbicide made by the same firm .
In addition, if we
become capable of
producing substances
tasting like, vanilla or
cocoa from plants
which can stand up to
the climates of the nor-
t h e rn hemisphere, fa r-
m e rs in pove rt y - s t ri c-
ken countries may lose
their meagre source of
i n c o m e . Yet according
to the A m e rican Bio-
technology Industry
O r g a n i z at i o n , things are less alarm i n g . I t
gi ves examples of technology transfers
such as the passing on to a research ins-
titute in Indonesia of mat e rial to produce
insect-resistant potatoes by tissue cul-
t u r e , and the insertion of a fungi c i d a l
gene into A f rican bananas.
Since research in this field is ve ry
c o s t l y, genetically modified plants are
usually pri vatized through pat e n t i n g .
M o n s a n t o, with an annual turn over of
more than $6.6 billion, s ays it spent $166
million last year on GMO research, bu t
refuses to say how many patents it
applied for. Small companies and the
c o u n t ries of the South stand no chance
against the big transnational firm s.
Taking out a patent is highly expen-
s i ve . For it to be valid in all the rich coun-
t ri e s , an initial deposit of about $84,000 is
r e q u i r e d , plus a tax which increases expo-
nentially during the life of the pat e n t . B y
the end of last ye a r , 1,377 patents for
genetically modified plants had been
applied for at the Euro-
pean Patent Office.
S e veral hundred of
them are curr e n t l y
awaiting examinat i o n .
Does this mean
t h at Europe has not
been won over by
GMOs? The import of
genetically modified
maize and rapeseed
has been authorized by
the European Union
since 1997 and will
this year amount to $200 million. B u t
some countries have expressed doubts.
A u s t ria and Luxembourg have forbidden
i m p o rts and Italy has banned gr owing of
G M O s. In A p ril 1997, the European
Parliament opposed the European

mic and social pressures

c o n s i d e r at i o n s ” .
The introduction of
antibiotic-resistant genes
into plants is also causing concern ,but there
is no proof that such genes are passed from
plants to animals and then to humans. I n
this case the gene acts as a marker in a gene
transfer process. To find out whether the
t r a n s f e rred gene is present in the cells, t h e y
are soaked in an antibiotic solution. O n l y
the cells which have not accepted the resis-
tant gene are destroyed. For example, the
Flavr Savr tomato produced in the United
S t ates in 1994 contains a gene to keep it
firm and slow the rotting process,along with
a gene resistant to kanamy c i n ,which is used
to fight respirat o ry ailments.A single muta-
tion of this gene also makes it resistant to
other antibiotics used to treat meningi t i s
and serious lung diseases.The resistant gene

Genetic modific a t i o n : how it works
The nucleus of each cell contains
chromosomes made up of genes
which govern heredity. Genes are
sequences of long molecules arran-
ged in the form of a double helix
and known as DNA (deoxyribonu-
cleic acid). DNA sees that the cell
functions in a way specific to the
species to which it belongs. A single
gene can determine several charac-
t e r i s t i c s, but sometimes several
genes are needed to determine a
single characteristic. Molecular bio-
logists cut up the genome (the
genetic endowment) of a given spe-
c i e s, increase the number of genes
and insert them into another spe-
cies to obtain a new hereditary cha-
racteristic coded by the transferred
D N A . This is how genetically modi-
fied organisms (GMOs) are obtai-
n e d .
In the laboratory, though not yet
on our plates, maize has been
given a scorpion’s gene so that it
can resist insects and a petunia
gene to enable it to resist herbi-
c i d e s. Potatoes have been endowed
with a gene from a chicken or a
moth to fight disease, as well as a
human gene to digest heavy
m e t a l s. A fish gene can be added
to tomatoes to help them resist the
c o l d , and rice and sunflower seeds
can be protein-enriched with genes
t a ken from beans and brazil nuts
r e s p e c t i v e l y. Cucumbers fight
disease with the help of a tobacco
g e n e. All kinds of things are imagi-
n a b l e, if not immediately feasible: a
gene from a bird with black fea-
thers to colour roses, a lettuce gene
to camouflage cows in green mea-
d o w s. But beware of the hybrids
that might escape from the lab.
Truth may turn out to be stranger
than science fiction! ■

fied plants and risks transmitting such resis-

Another problem is how someone

for example, can know
whether such a gene
has been introduced
into sunflower seeds to
make them more pro-
t e i n - ri c h .A rnaud A p o-
t e k e r , of Greenpeace,
raises another issue.
“Is it wise,” he asks,
“to insert into bananas
a gene with the hepat i-
tis B vaccine designed
for humans, as is being done in Mexico?
Can we say what the effect of such a va c-
cine will be on the animals, birds and
insects which eat them?”

fied rapeseed can be blown as far as 2.5 km,
which means it can become crossed with wild
species like mustard.W h at ’s more, in rotat i n g

resistance to cert a i n
insects can lead to the
emergence of new
insects resistant to the art i ficial poisons pro-
duced by these plants. H ow can they be
dealt with? Science does not yet have enough
d ata to answer these questions sat i s fa c t o-
rily.
Another unknown is the reaction to
genetically modified bacteria of bacteri a
and fungi which act in my riad ways in
the soil, e . g . to help plants with gr ow t h
and to fight parasites, frost and anti-pol-
lution products. A gram of surface soil
contains between 100 million and one
billion bacteria and between 1,000 and
10,000 different species–and scientists
s ay they have only inve s t i g ated a tenth of

N ational A gronomic Research Institute
(INRA) has written that “ d ata are lac-
king about the ways and circumstances
in which a micro-organism introduces
itself successfully into the gr o u n d , s t ay s
there and performs its function.” So we
cannot yet predict what will happen
when a GMO is introduced, either to it
or to its genetic heritage in the field inDrawing by Rousso © Les Dossiers de l’Environnement de l’INRA n0 12, Pa r i s

“once they are introduced, m i c r o - o r g a-

H ave we gone ahead too fast and cast
a basic precautionary principle to the
winds? Fierce debate is going on betwe e n
s u p p o rt e rs and opponents of genetic
m o d i fic at i o n .To gi ve consumers a choice
b e t ween consuming or rejecting food
containing GMOs, clear labelling is
n e c e s s a ry. This is easier said than done.
Shipments of imported fa rm produce
often contain mixtures. Unless they are
sure of their suppliers , the big food firm s
will have to carry out costly and elabo-
r ate tests. But the customer should be
able to make a free and informed choice.
For this, we need to wait until more is
k n ow n . But as so often, the profit motive
is ove rriding all other considerat i o n s. ■
