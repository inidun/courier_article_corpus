ON ASTROLL
WITH IMMORTAL
FRIENDS
by Gabrielle C abri ni
The trade in second-hand books is nowadays an
international industry whose annual turnover runs
into astronomic figures. Organized on an inter¬
national scale, it has its own directories of book¬
shops in many lands. One published in France,
for instance, lists I, I 63 addresses of book dealers
in 13 countries. Another, the "A.B. Bookman's
Yearbook," printed in London, gives 5,500 names
of second-hand bookshops throughout the world,
while a weekly specialist publication, " The Clique"
supplies its readers with the titles of some
1,000,000 second-hand books of interest, which,
according to still another catalogue, fill 58 different
categories and 759 sub-categories. One of the
great centres of the trade is Paris where many
second-hand book dealers are installed on the
banks of the Seine, especially around the cathedral
of Notre-Dame (above). Browsing for books
among the curious "box stalls" (above, right)
is a popular pastime for Parisians who sometimes
describe the Seine, along its course through their
city, as "a river lined with books and fishermen."

There are times in everyone's life when destiny seems
to change its course and reshape the future. How
many of us have ever thought back to the important
milestones in" our life and tried to recall the things that
seemed to exert a strong influence at those moments of
change and decision? We probably would find that, in
our childhood at any rate, one book or perhaps several
books somehow played a part in changing the course of
our existence.
If we put this same question to our family and friends,
many of them would certainly tell us that books, stand¬
ing out like landmarks in a voyage of exploration, had also
been decisive factors in their lives. Sometimes books
encouraged them to step out more firmly along an already
chosen road; sometimes books made them hesitate and
finally seek a new path to follow. Like us, they too
perhaps heard in a book the call of adventure or found
the door to fresh discoveries.
These are universally shared experiences and if we were
able to carFy our inquiries to other lands we would find
that for hundreds of years certain works have formed the
very basis of human thought and feeling. The names of
their authors are immortal: Homer, Dante, Shakespeare,
Cervantes, Tolstoy» Victor Hugo... a complete list would
fill many pages.

The Unesco Courier. February 1957
And yet, how many of us ever considered what propor¬
tion of these works, which have been a source of delight
and heart-searching to us and to so many generations of
human beings, were actually conceived and written in our
language or even in one of those in which the majority of
people have read them?
Down the centuries, poets, philosophers and scholars
have all had a share in moulding you, and the men, women
and children of your country. If today they could return
on earth how many of them could even suspect that it is
of them that people are talking in many lands. How
surprised they would be to find their poems in the hands
of a Japanese student, to see that it is their stories that
set a child a-dreaming in Peru, or to discover that their
teachings, expounded in strange characters quite unintel¬
ligible to them, are being pored over by a host of readers,
intent on grasping their inner meaning.
"No man is an island", wrote John Donne, the English
poet and divine, three and a half centuries ago. Man's
nature prevents him from remaining indifferent to what
affects others of his kind. Though separated by languages
and customs and often divided by wars, men have always
wanted to know and to understand the thoughts, the likes
and the dislikes of other peoples those who wore such
funny clothes, those who invaded and overran their
country or tried to make it adopt their way of life. For
this understanding they needed translations.
The first translations we know of include sacred writings.
These were made slowly and tediously for their meaning
had to be rendered with perfect fidelity. Later came non-
religious texts. It would perhaps be wrong to consider
these as translations for those who made them were
adapters rather than true translators. In a language they
had mastered by diligent study or learned by chance they
looked for a world of wonders, costumes and customs to
delight and amuse those who would read about them.
Yet while depicting this unfamiliar and exotic world, the
adapter, consciously or unconsciously, was careful to
preserve certain basic features, certain elements of the
known world which enabled the readers in his own country
to feel at one with the king and the shepherd, the courtier
and the beauty whose adventures, in lands which seemed
so different from their own, they followed with a rapt
interest.
That is why we sometimes find it hard to believe that
certain stories did actually originate in far-off |
places. Some which seem to have been I
created in the minds of our own countrymen I
and to mirror perfectly their outlook and way |

IMMORTAL FRIENDS

of thinking have, in fact, reached us after strange
journeys across the earth. One of the most remarkable
was made by one of the great books of India, the Pancha-
tantra or "Five Cases of Wisdom", regarded as India's
most outstanding imaginative work. The fables are
attributed to a legendary Brahmin named Vishnusarman
and are said to have been written for a king of southern
India who was famed for his might and learning, but
cursed with lazy and ignorant sons. Of the seventy fables
and stories in the Panchatantra, written between the
second and sixth centuries A.D.', some have been translat¬
ed into practically every one of the languages of ancient
and modern India.
The Odyssey of these fables led them along devious
routes to the Western World, and showed what changes
and adaptations a writing can undergo in the course of
time. About the 6th century A.D. the fables were translat¬
ed into Persian, and from Persian into Arabic around
750 A.D. By the 12th century they had been translated
from Arabic into Hebrew and a Jewish convert to Christi¬
anity, who later became the monk John of Capua, adapted
them into Latin. Spanish, French and German language
texts followed and Italian versions were produced by Doni
(1552) and Firenzuola (1548). The version of Doni was
translated into English by Sir Thomas North (The Morall
Philosophie of Doni, 1601).
The collection became best known in Europe as the
fables of Bidpal (derived from the wise Bidpai who tells
the stories). In France the ancient storyteller had
become "Pilpay the Sage", and the stories were read in the
17th century by the writer Jean de la Fontaine, who, when
writing his own famous fables, took ideas from the Indian
ones ("I owe most of them to Pilpay1", he wrote with some
exaggeration) and material which he transposed.
Marco fires fever for knowledge
One day the westward journey was halted and Pilpay
retraced his steps towards the east in translations
and adaptations. La Fontaine's fables, today fa¬
mous the world over, made their way back to the country
of their birth. They were translated into Arabic, Persian
and Coptic, and so returned to India where illuminated
manuscripts now illustrate many which had set out from
there so many centuries earlier.
The same thing happened to the great romances that
enthralled the people of the Middle Ages the Romance of
Alexander, the Romance of Tristan and Isolde and many
others. Their origins have become so obscure that it is
hard to say who was their first and true begetter.
One of the most widely translated books at the end of
the Middle Ages was The Travels of Marco Polo. This
Venetian, most famous of all travellers, recounted in
French a fabulous yet real journey to China in the second
half of the thirteenth century. His work created in the
West an obsession with the treasures and riches of
India and "Cathay", the Empire of the Great Khan. It
was translated in record time not only into all European
languages, but also into all manner of dialects: Genoese,
Provencal, Catalan, Aragonese, Tuscan and many others.
Yet this first great European "eye witness" account of the
Far East was not translated and published in Chinese and
Japanese until quite recently.
Fired by the great and successful voyages of discovery,
a kind of fever of desire to know and to translate spread
over the world. Dazzled by the appearance of new races
which seemed to spring from nowhere and delighted by so
much diversity, scholars and monks did their best to collect
and preserve the treasures of literature from destruction.
Many works which can never be replaced, however, fell
victim to the flames of war and conquest.
In Mexico alone, dictionaries were compiled of dozens of
languages transliterated into Latin characters. And the
world continued to shrink as the craving for knowledge
grew ever stronger in the West. What were the men who
lived in other lands really like? What had
the people of ancient times really been like?

chants searched abbeys and monasteries, PaSe

ROUND TRIP FOR BIDPAI THE SAGE
Last year, translations of the celebrated fables of Jean de la
Fontaine, the I 7th century French writer, were published
In nine languages: Danish, German, Spanish, Finnish,
Esperanto, Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian and English. These
fables have already been translated into most of the world's
languages and in this waythrough adaptations and transla¬
tions have travelled back to some of the countries
from whose stories La Fontaine drew inspiration. First of
all, La Fontaine, like many French writers before him, drew
on the great wealth of fables attributed to Aesop, the ancient
Greek "master of stories". His originality was to revive
the fable in verse and to endow it with a realism based on
a close observation of beasts and men. La Fontaine also
owes a debt, which he acknowledges in his edition of
I 678-79, to a collection of Indian fables collected under the
title of the Ponchotontro or "Five Cases of Wisdom". The
collection became best known in Europe as the fables of
Bidpal (from the wise Bidpai who tells the stories). In the
French translation of I 644, Bidpal became "Pilpay the Sage".
When La Fontaine's fables were translated into Arabic,
Persian and Coptic, "Pilpay" retraced his steps to the East.
Eventually, the stories once again reached India, where
illuminated manuscripts now illustrate many of them which
had set out from that country many centuries before.

INDEX OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
For years the Bible has occupied first place in lists of most frequently published
books in translations. Figures for 1955 have changed the picture, and as shown
in table on page 8, the Bible has dropped to second place behind Lenin.
However, it is interesting to note that of the 371 translations of Lenin published in
14 countries during 1955, only 43 were produced outside the Soviet Union, the
remaining 328 being translations published within the U.S.S.R. in languages other
than Russian (see table above).
Tables on these pages are based on information collated from past eight years of
UNESCO's Index Translationum: International Bibliography of Translations (price per
volume: $14; 70/-; 3,500 francs). The Index, first started in 1932 by the International
Institute of Intellectual Co-operation, then listed only six countries. Unesco resumed
publication of the Index in 1950 (none appeared between 1941-47) the first volume
covering 8,000 translations in 26 countries for the year 1948. The latest Volume VIII
covers a record 51 countries and lists 24,274 translations published in 1955.
The volumes of Index Translationum have been hailed as "a remarkable storehouse
of contemporary history... a register of intellectual co-operation which richly repay
people of very varying interests for whatever time they can devote to them." As
one librarian recently wrote: '"Their historical importance increases as every new
annual volume is added to their ranks... It is unfortunate that many who would
appreciate the information given in ' the annual volumes of the Index Translationum
remain unaware of its existence... A glance at the well-printed pages reveals that
the material here given in such prosaic fashion would provide a journalist with enough
facts for half-a-dozen rousing articles, a sociologist with the basis for a searching
study of current trends in tastes and interests, and a historian with more than sufficient
material for almost any theory on contemporary problems he cared to elaborate."'

A STROLL WITH
IMMORTAL FRIENDS
(Continued) How many from the East?
in out of the way places, in the earth itself, hopeful of
discovering, alongside the broken statues and columns,
some fragments of great books lost to the world.
One of these collectors was Francesco Patrizi da Cherso,
the Italian Renaissance philosopher. The son of a long
line of navigators, he had sailed the Mediterranean from
the age of ten. Now he made journeys to Spain and
Southern Italy where his searches brought to light ancient
manuscripts.
Down the centuries translators of genius have tackled
the great works of the human mind and famous writers
have counted it an honour to revive the writings of the
ancients for their contemporaries. In the 16th century
Jacques Amyot in France and Lope de Vega in Spain made
masterly translations of Plutarch's Lives. In the follow¬
ing century the Arabian Nights were translated from the
Arabic and thus Arab literature enriched that of the
West. The fashion for translations reached such a
pitch that to be sure of success, writers sometimes passed
off their own works as translations that had been made
from another tongue.
From all this it might be
concluded that each country is
well acquainted with the litera¬
ture of others. This is, unhappi¬
ly, not the case. A look through
the volumes of Index Transla¬
tionum, published by Unesco
each year, reveals the fact that
no regular and balanced two-way
flow of translations between dif¬
ferent countries exists. While a
surprisingly large number of
translations may be made in one
particular country, this does not
mean that its own books enjoy
the same popularity elsewhere.
The most striking example is
that of Japan. This is one of the
countries where people read
most. Something like 16 million
copies of daily newspapers are
printed, and these have far more
pages than those published in
England or France.
According to statistics, 2,360
works were translated into Ja¬
panese from other languages in
1953-54 and 1,203 in 1955. Al¬
though this is a high figure, it is
not exceptional when compared
with those (for 1953-54 and for
1955) of several other countries:
Germany (2,473 and 2,056); Italy
(2,336 and 1,118); Yugoslavia (1,408 and 738); or France
(2,674 and 1,424). It is rather in the choice of books that
Japan's case becomes practically unique. The list of titles
is really astounding. It gives the impression that no great
writer, no leading thinker and no important poet has been
overlooked by the translators.
Writers of every period and from every country seem
to be covered. They offer a vast panorama of human
culture, history, science, politics and poetry. All the
great "super length" novels are there, old and new, and
sometimes even those from Western literature scarcely
known in the West because they happen to have been
written in languages with a small diffusion. Poetry is
well represented. We find the names of the greatest poets
of ancient and modern times.
The general impression given is that the Japanese
reader is well versed in every aspect of Western civilization
Jean Paul Sartre to Agatha Christie, from philo¬
sophers and the polemics they inspire, and the success¬
ful first novel of an 18-year.old French girl student to the
stir created by the latest thriller.
What has the West done to compare with this great
coverage? All we find of translations from the Japanese in
all countries is a mere handful of works, including two
taken from the scenarios of two famous filmsRashomon

and The Gates of Hell and presented in that form.
Germany has translated, and in an abridged form,
the great Japanese novel, Genji Monogatari. Many West¬
ern publishers would say it was too long, yet the Japanese
have translated the longest Western novels, including A la
Recherche du temps perdu, Les Thibault and Les Hommes
de bonne volonté, to name a few of the recent French ones.
Between 1928 and 1933 an English publisher brought out
the first complete translation of the six-volume master¬
piece of Japanese psychological literature under the allur¬
ing titles of The Tale of Genji, The Sacred Tree, A Wreath
of Cloud, Blue Trousers, The Lady of the Boat and The
Bridge of Dreams, the last two of which were later trans¬
lated into Italian.
When this monumental translation appeared it was
hailed as a great literary event in Western countries and
the works enjoyed great success. An ambitious pro¬
gramme for making unabridged translations was prepared
and launched in a number of Western countries, but this
was unfortunately interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Despite its small population,
Israel, after Japan, is one of the
countries with the broadest of
tastes in literature. Index Trans¬
lationum (N° 7) lists 1,070 trans¬
lations for Israel. (N° 8, the latest
Index, gives no figures) . The list
Includes, for example, classical
masterpieces in Persian and
Arabic, and also those written in
languages less widely used, such
as Norwegian, Croat, Hungarian,
Czech, modern Greek, Danish,
Dutch and Turkish, and works in
the languages most widely used:
Spanish, Russian, French, Ger¬
man, English and Chinese.
There are, of course, many
reasons why different countries
are so unevenly represented in
the field of translations. Those
which use languages which have
the widest diffusion perhaps tend
to take the easiest course. In
France, where . 1,424 titles were
recorded as having been trans¬
lated in 1955 there was, leaving
aside the great classical master¬
pieces, a great predominance of
Anglo - Saxon literature. Then
again, children in nearly every
country read Alice in Wonderland,
Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales and
Pinocchio (I can still see the
delightful Japanese illustrations of a very oriental-looking
Pinocchio, with such a novel expression on his little
wooden face).
In 1949 I met a publisher who was launching the first
collection of world masterpieces, complete or abridged,
in the Indonesian national language. I was idly turning
the pages of the books, though not understanding a single
word I saw. Suddenly I saw on one cover the black
silhouette of a horseman against a distant background of
tropical foliage where the arms of a windmill could be
seen. He carried a lance and his knees gripped the flanks
of a cadaverous horse. Don Quixote, the "knight of the
woeful countenance" was beginning his wanderings in a
new country.
I felt full of envy for the people in Indonesia who would
get to know the greatest work of Spanish literature. For
how many Indonesians, I wondered, would it serve as a
doorway to Spain.And then it occurred to me that it was
not only Spain they would get to know better through this
masterpiece of writing. Through Don Quixote they would
learn to know men everywhere a little better; through him
they would better understand themselves, for the great
unchanging features of mankind are revealed even more
clearly in the world's literary masterpieces than in the
outward characteristics of the countries which conceived
them and brought them forth.
