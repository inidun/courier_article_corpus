                  Over the coming two years, UNESCO is committed to continue working for freedom 
                           of expression and press freedom and to promoting the use of the information 
                                 and communication technologies to foster inclusive knowledge societies 
                                       that empower individuals and communities.

inclusive knowledge societies
 ontributing to the construction 
of inclusive knowledge societies 
through information and com-
munication,” is how UNESCO’s 
Assistant Director-General for 
Communication and Information 
(ADG/CI), Abdul Waheed Khan 
encapsulates the objectives of 
his sector for the coming bien-
nium. 
This echoes objectives estab-
lished by World Summit on the 
Information Society (WSIS), 
which UNESCO helped organize 
in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunis in 
2005. UNESCO remains active 
in the WSIS process, destined to 
build people-centered informa-
tion societies that are mindful 
of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and, of the ba-
sic human right of freedom of 
expression. 
That strategy focuses on foster-
ing free, independent and plura- 
listic communication and univer-
sal access to information. This is 
essential for the strengthening 
of participatory democracy and 
for the struggle against poverty, 
as communication and informa-
tion play a central role in devel-
opment. However, in many parts 
of the world, the media need to 
be reinforced so as to contribute 
to the international development 
drive, says Mr Khan. 
Media development has long 
been at the centre of CI’s work, 
notably through programmes 
such as the International Pro-
gramme for the Development of 
Communication (IPDC) which, 
over the last 27 years, has raised 
some US$ 93 million for over 
1,100 projects in 139 develop-
ing countries and countries in 
transition. IPDC is the only forum 
in the United Nations to discuss 
and promote free and indepen-
dent media in developing coun-

tries and countries in transition. 
The CI sector is also committed 
to continue serving as a watch-
dog for freedom of expression 
around the world, an area in 
which UNESCO plays a leading 
role, reminding Member States 
of their obligation to respect this 
fundamental human right en-
shrined in the Universal Declara-
tion on Human Rights and recog-
nized by the WSIS.
Creating  
resources
“Creating the resources in 
Member States for them to de-
velop free and independent me-
dia is our bread and butter,” says 
Mr Khan, recalling that universal 
access to knowledge depends 
on adequate communication and 
information infrastructures. 
“At stake is the empowerment 
of individuals and communities”, 
says Mr Khan, who recalls that 
the link between empowerment 
and knowledge is becoming ever 
stronger. It is therefore not sur-
prising that another major objec-
tive for CI, is to support UNESCO 
in working towards fulfilling the 
ambitious goals of the Education 
For All (EFA) drive adopted by the 
international community in Dakar 
in 2000. EFA concerns overall 
improvements in the provision of 
quality basic education and life 
skills to all and achieving gender 
parity in education by 2015.
The multiplier  
effect
Mr Khan explains that the in-
formation and communication 
technologies (ICTs) can have a 
“multiplier effect,” contributing 
to the education of learners and 
the training of teachers. “Like-
wise, CI works to ensure that the 
multiplier effect of ICTs benefits 
UNESCO’s promotion of cul-
tural diversity and dissemination 
of scientific knowledge.” Thus, 
argues Mr Khan, CI is the leader 
when it comes to cooperation be-
tween UNESCO’s sectors. 
In addition, the ADG recalls that 
ICTs not only help generate and 
disseminate knowledge but are 
also important for the preserva-
tion of knowledge. Programmes 
such as Memory of the World 
serve to preserve and dissemi-
nate the heritage of documen-
tary material and archives. Thus, 
through ICTs, UNESCO’s Com-
munication and Information sec-
tor has become involved in the 
preservation of knowledge, in-
cluding indigenous knowledge, 
and in cultural heritage. 
The new technologies have ope- 
ated a deep change in the flow 
of information and its sharing. 
Mr Khan strongly believes that 
UNESCO must play its role in 
bridging the knowledge gap to 
ensure that this multidirectional 
flow of information and know- 
ledge does not pass by those 
who are less privileged. With pro-
grammes such as the Community 
Multimedia Centres, and a wide 
range of partners including some 
of the world’s leading private 
sector companies and NGOs, 
as well as networks such as the 
new Power of Peace Network, Mr 
Khan is convinced that UNESCO 
can contribute to world peace 
and development.
