The Lebanese writer, mystic poet and thinker Gibran Khalil Gibran (1883-1931) also painted in an allegorical style close to that
of William Blake. Influenced by Nietzsche, he attempted to use the will to power for the improvement of man in accordance
with the precepts of Christ and of Oriental sages. In his many works written in Arabic and English he proclaimed himself a
citizen of the world. His spiritualistic work The Prophet (1923) was a best-seller in the United States and has been translated
into 34 languages. Above, a self-portrait by Gibran.

GIBRAN KHALIL GIBRAN (1883-1931)
A voyage
and a vision
by Ghali Shukri
GIBRAN Khalil Gibran (1883-
1931) left Lebanon for the
United States in 1895 when he
was twelve years old, but three years
later he returned to Beirut to study
Arabic. Thus 1903, the year in which he
went back to Boston, may be regarded
as the date when he began nearly a
lifetime's residence in North America,
where he divided his time between his
studio in New York and his sister's
house in Boston. Gibran thus spent the
first three decades of the twentieth cen¬
tury in one of the world's major centres
of "modern culture", far away from
his native land, itself a major world
centre of "traditional culture".
Gibran's emigration to the west was
not due to personal or family reasons.
It was part of a larger, more general
movement in which Syrians and
Lebanese migrated to Egypt and to the
Americas, fleeing from the appalling
conditions resulting from the decline of
the Ottoman Empire around the end of
the last century. The origins of this
wave of migration lay in the suppres¬
sion of freedom of expression and
belief and in the series of famines,
epidemics -vars and earthquakes that
ravaged th Levant at the turn of the
century.
In earlier days successive waves of
migration had been motivated by trade
and the other maritime activities for
which the people of Phoenicia had been
famous since ancient times. The novel
feature of the migration at the turn of
the century was that the migrants
associated trading interests with
cultural aims. These Lebanese and
Syrian émigrés laid the foundations of
culture, journalism and the arts in
Egypt, establishing publishing houses,
theatres, cinemas and newspapers. The
same phenomenon occurred, to vary-

Gibran divided his life
between Lebanon, the
United States, and
France, and carried on a
vast correspondence
with intellectuals of his
own and other coun¬
tries. Left, a letter
which he wrote in
Arabic to the writer

Ziade had appeared

ing degrees, in North and South
America. Gibran himself tried his hand
at business, alternately making and los¬
ing money, while Mikhayil N'aimi, as
he confesses in his book on Gibran,
worked as a commercial representative.
Thus it was the quest for freedom of
intellectual expression and economic
opportunity that drove the intelligent¬
sia of the Arab East to migrate in suc¬
cessive waves either to Egypt or to
South and North America. All these
men and women combined the trade of
journalist, writer or artist with that of
dealer in stocks and bonds. Trade, art
and politics almost always went
together in their lives and only in rare
cases did one take precedence over the
others. Gibran Khalil Gibran was one
of those rare cases.
Gibran's life and works present a
number of distinctive geatures. First of
all, he was fully a child of his times.
The first three decades of the twentieth
century set the tone for the new age
which Gibran did not live to see. It was
a time of wholesale destruction that
was also marked by an upsurge of ac¬
tivity in culture, art and science and by
an attempt to experiment with vi¬
sionary ideas that had risen from the
ruins. These were the decades of the
First World War, the first socialist
revolution, the birth of Nietzscheanism
and the spread of Freudianism. All
these unprecedented occurrences had a
strong influence on sculpture, poetry,
painting, the novel and the theatre,
shattering old forms and dictating new
subject-matter.
Gibran was immersed in his epoch,
an actor not a spectator. His migration
from Mount Lebanon to Boston may
be seen as the journey of a prophet.

Gibran expressed himself with equal facility in Arabic and English. Above, a frag¬
ment from his "Notebooks".
When the Ottomans began their
slaughtering in the Levant, all the in¬
telligentsia of Syria (which then includ¬
ed the whole of the Fertile Crescent
region) fled. For Gibran and a few
others, the goal was a spiritual one. For
them migration was a stage which
would necessarily be followed by a
return to the homeland. They did not
go in search of refuge, exile, trade or
money, but in search of a vision,
following a circular path that necessari¬
ly ended where it began.
The second feature that epitomizes
the life and works of Gibran is that
while he lived at a geographical
distance from his native land, he main¬
tained close links with it and with its
history. Although distant from
Lebanon, he was always strongly in¬
fluenced by émigré Arab culture and
the Arabic press, and remained in cons¬
tant communication with his
homeland. Geographical distance gave
him a broader and deeper insight into
The earth is my homeland and
humanity is my family.
Gibran
his country and enabled him more
swiftly and more perceptively to iden¬
tify its misfortunes and see where the
remedies might lie. Thus the essential
feature of his migration was that it took
him both away from and back to his
homeland; it was a temporary measure
to enable him to trace the lineaments of
his prophetic message, not to arm
himself with a residence permit. Hence
26
Gibran's "modernity" was the reverse
side of his deep-rooted cultural identi¬
ty; his migration was at once an inward
and an outward journey.
Gibran's greatest creative achieve¬
ment was, then, his own life within
whose short span he was only forty-
eight years old when he died the
public and private dimensions were in¬
distinguishable. His views on women,
marriage and the clergy were not simp¬
ly theoretical standpoints expressed in
his writings and drawings but
represented his practical views on life,
love and religion. More than half a cen¬
tury after the death of Gibran we are
beginning to understand the major im¬
portance of his book The Prophet
(1923); we should not, however, fail to
recognize the equal importance of his
work Jesus, the Son of Man. In fact,
the key to Gibran's works lies in his at¬
titude towards authority, whether
represented by established tradition,
prevailing convention, religious institu¬
tion, social structure, economic system
or foreign occupying power.
The "movement" that grew out of
Gibran's life and art (drawing, painting
and writing) was clearly founded by a
man possessed of prophetic vision.
And his founding of the "Pen
League", his defence of his country
against the Ottomans, his long dedica¬
tion to art in his New York studio and
to literature in a secluded house in
Boston were for him indissociable ac¬
tivities. His metrical verse and his free
verse, his narrative prose and
dialogues, plays and novels, all served
that one vision. The forms these
writings took grew naturally out of
I am a traveller and a navigator,
and each day I discover a new
country in my soul. My friend,
you and I will live as strangers to
this life, strangers to one another
and to ourselves, until the day
when you will speak and I will
listen to you believing that your
voice is mine, until the day when
I shall stand before you, thinking
that I am before a mirror.
Gibran
their subject-matter, for Gibran did
not set out deliberately to modernize
poetry and language. His constant con¬
cern, once he had discovered his life's
mission, was to express his "vision".
Was Gibran a Romantic when he
wrote A Tear and a Smile? Did he
become a symbolist with The Madman,
The Forerunner and The Wanderer?
Was he a philosopher in The Prophet,
The Garden of the Prophet and The
Earth Gods and a novelist in Spirits
Rebellious and Broken Wings?
Gibran's life and death, his writings
and works of visual art defy such
classification to which, moreover, he
was opposed throughout his life. He
fought against all forms of pigeon¬
holing, against all that would strait-
jacket thoughts and feelings.
Throughout his spiritual journey,
Gibran Khalil Gibran remained true to
his vision and through his art and
writings in the first three decades of this
century he proclaimed his prophetic
message.
