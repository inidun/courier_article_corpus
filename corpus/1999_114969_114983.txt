The smell of bu rning sugar and the lengths of cut
cane strewn along the dirt road point the way to
the San Francisco Ameca sugar mill in Mexico’s
Jalisco stat e , the home of tequila, 73 kilometres from
the city of Guadalajara. To the naked eye , the mill
seems just like any other, with its tall chimneys, the
sound of escaping steam and the comings and goings
of its wo r k e rs.Yet this fa c t o ry stands apart . Until four
ye a rs ago, the mill needed 15 litres of water to
produce one kilogram of sugar. N ow it uses only
three litres.
Besides reducing production costs, this “ m i r a c l e ”
is of direct benefit to the ri ver A m e c a , the mill’s main
source of supply and one of Jalisco’s three largest
rivers.
“ We have made all these changes at the mill
because we are convinced of the need to show concern
for the water supply problem and also because wat e r
is becoming an increasingly expensive item,” s ay s
chemist Matilde Osorio Cru z , head of the mill’s
m a n u fa c t u ring laborat o ry. In the space of five ye a rs ,
the price of wat e r , a basic ingredient in sugar
production,has risen fifteenfold.
An image of St. Francis is displayed near to the
g ates of the fa c t o ry, which was founded in 1903.
From that time until barely four ye a rs ago, s u g a r
production required enormous amounts of wat e r ,
which was drawn from the ri ver A m e c a . At the end of
the process,most of the waste water was discharged
back into the ri ver and contaminated it. Unlike metals
or other types of toxic chemical wa s t e , the by-products
of sugar, consisting chiefly of molasses, are eve n t u a l l y
absorbed by the river but consume a considerable
amount of oxygen, thereby depriving fish and plant
life of sustenance.
According to Osori o, as a result of the measures
taken this problem has been completely resolve d .
“The first thing we did was to set up a water treat m e n t
p l a n t ,” she say s.“Then we started to use closed circuits
in which the water circulates continuously through the
different parts of the process without any of it being
l o s t , as used to be the case.” In practical term s , t h e
system devised is somewhat similar to that of the
b l o o d s t r e a m , in which the fluid circulates and is
processed without having to be renewe d .
Closed circuits
to prevent waste
Among the innovations introduced, O s o rio cites
the creation of a cooling tank to bring down the
t e m p e r ature of the wat e r , which is ve ry hot when it
emerges from one part of the process, before using it
a g a i n . The tank looks like an enormous fountain,
since the system consists of a set of perforated pipes
through which the water gushes before cooling in
contact with the air.Thanks to the system, the wat e r
t e m p e r ature is reduced from 45° to 38°C. Once the
water has cooled, it is fed back into the system.
The project was made possible through support
p r ovided by the United Nations Industri a l
D e velopment Organization (UN I D O) , with the
p a rt i c i p ation of Mexico’s National Chamber of the
Sugar and Alcohol Industry, the Group of Sugar-
E x p o rting Countries of Latin A m e rica and the
C a ribbean (GE P L AC E A) and the National A u t o n o m o u s
U n i ve rsity of Mexico (UN A M) . Similar systems are
being used at the Motzorongo and El Potrero mills in
the Mexican state of Ve r a c ru z .
The San Francisco mill is the pilot plant of the
Beta San Miguel group, which owns a further four
mills in Mexico, to which it plans to extend the
water-conservation experience gained at Ameca.
According to inform ation provided by UN I D O,
its $493,000 loan to the mill could be recouped in two
ye a rs as a result of cost sav i n g s. S e r gio Miranda Cru z ,
the UN I D O official behind the technical studies
c u l m i n ating in this experi m e n t , c o n s i d e rs that “ t h e
results have been so positive that the project could
d e velop into a full-scale progr a m m e . But quite frankly
we have not yet reached that point.”
The sugar-cane harvest started in November 1998
and will go on until May 1999.The machinery wo r k s
night and day.The mill will produce some 100,000
tonnes of sugar and will consume 3,156 cubic metres
of water per tonne produced.For the mill’s technical
staff and wo r k e rs , optimizing water consumption and
i m p r oving sugar quality present a difficult bu t
r e warding challenge. n
