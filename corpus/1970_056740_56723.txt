BUT FOR WHOM? ...AND HOW?
A,IS this century draws to a
close, the developing countries face
their biggest challenge: how to find
the quickest short cut to close the
gap between themselves and the
industrially developed nations.
The development of science and
technology certainly appears to be
the best and most effective way to
bring this about. Man, with his capa¬
city for planning, organization and
innovation, will be the chief driving
force for this radical transformation.
This has been true at all times and
in all countries. Studies in Washington
show that even more important than
investment, the major factor for expan¬
sion in the United States since 1925
has been the education and training of
men and women.
But in trying to apply this to the
developing Third World we are imme¬
diately faced by a host of situations
which though they may appear inde¬
pendent one of the other are in reality
closely interlinked.
The French sociologist Jean Four-
astié has rightly said that "A child
whose life has been dominated by a
fanatical or highly emotional upbring¬
ing, or more important by the belief
in magic and other misguided tenets,
will in all probability find it much
harder to understand the methods of
experimental science much less to
apply them."
The Director-General of Unesco,
René Maheu, recently declared: "The
absence of intellectual stimulation
arising from a lack or insufficiency of
education... inevitably results... in a
slowing down of the mental process.
We know, furthermore, that forms of
mental retardedness can no longer be
overcome if certain learning pro¬
cesses... have not been mastered at
an appropriate age."
The U.N. Advisory Committee on
the Application of Science to Develop¬
ment reports: "If the levels of teaching
in the majority of the developing
countries cannot be considerably
improved and raised so that the
appreciation of modern science and
technology becomes a major factor,
there is little chance of science and
technology being effectively applied in
these countries."
We thus see that the logical
conclusions to be drawn are these:
without short cuts the developing
countries cannot possibly catch up;
PIERRE RONDIERE, French writer and
journalist, is the author of "Rendez-vous
1980 - La science et la technique au se¬
cours du tiers monde" (Science and Tech¬
nology to Aid the Third World), published
in collaboration with the United Nations by
Editions Payot, Paris, 1968 (7.50 F).
without the application of science and
technology no short cuts are concei¬
vable; and without education the
application of science and technology
is impossible. So without education
there can be no short cuts.
But that is not all. The question that
immediately comes to mind is: educ¬
ation, fine, but for whom, and how?
For the past 20 years, the nations
of the Third World both the govern¬
ments and the people have launched
out into a vast fight to overcome
illiteracy and raise their educational
level. Three entire continents have
been caught up in the fever.
In 1960, the governments of Asia
adopted the now-famous "Karachi
Plan" which foresaw seven years of
compulsory primary schooling for all
children by 1980.
In 1961, African Ministers of Educa-
by Pierre Rondière
tion agreed to an ambitious pro¬
gramme with three main objectives:
six years compulsory education for all
African children by 1980; entry of
20 per cent of primary school children
into secondary schools; a university
enrolment of 300,000 students.
The countries of Latin America
followed suit in 1962 with their own
plan to provide six years of primary
schooling for all children throughout
the continent by 1970.
Education budgets in the Third
World have thus spiralled upwards at
a dizzy pace since 1960 about twice
as fast as the increase in national
income.
The effort made by the less well
off countries has been and remains
today so intense that most of them,
despite their poverty, devote a higher

In many countries
of the Third World,
the immense effort
to develop education
is hardly keeping
pace with the effects
of the population
explosion. In Mali,
for instance,
68,000 children
attended primary
school in 1961; three
years later this figure
was almost
double113,000.
But, as in 1961, it
still represented -
only 10 per cent
of Mali's school age
population. In many
countries, the
number of children

room in the
classroom Is rising

proportion of their national income to
education than do the developed
countries. The figure is often as high
as 25 per cent and sometimes even
higher, compared, for example, with
France's 17 per cent.
Expenditure on education in all
these countries has risen faster than
other budget spending. It has, in fact,
been pointed out that public funds
devoted to education cannot go on
much longer increasing faster than
those earmarked for other national
needs without jeopardizing government
targets in other fields.
And here a difficult decision must
be faced: the choice between more
schools and fewer hospitals, factories,
fertilizers, roads and dams, or fewer
schools than planned and more hos¬
pitals, factories, fertilizers, roads,
dams and illiterates.
Education certainly, but for whom?
In their attempt to respond both to
the intense desire for learning and to
the need for education as a means to
progress, the governments of the three
"hungry continents" have adopted
various solutions which can be roughly
divided into two groups.
In the first group of countries,
essentially the African countries, pri¬
mary education has been made available
to all. Since the number of qualified
student teachers leaving the training
colleges is insufficient to deal with
such a situation, use is made of
relatively unqualified "monitors"
pupils who failed the secondary
school entry examination or who
simply hold a primary school leaving
certificate.
Thus in the Ivory Coast, for exam¬
ple, only 600 of the 7,500 primary
school teachers hold diplomas, while
the proportion of "monitors" in primary
education elsewhere in French-
speaking Africa is between 70 and
80 per cent, and as high as 90 per cent
in Chad.
The result, in certain countries, is
that five years after their primary
schooling these so-called literate
young men and women have once
again become illiterates.
Broadly speaking, the system works
as follows. The "monitor" has his
class of 50, 60, 80 or even 100 children
recite in chorus from a textbook,
whose contents they scarcely under¬
stand. Since selection for promotion
to a higher grade is stiff, pupils who
do not succeed stay on in the lower
grade for a second, third and some¬
times even a fourth year before finally
dropping out.
They form what specialists call
"the wall", and progressively para¬
lyze an already weak educational sys¬
tem. As the pupils chant their daily
lessons, "the wall" forms a kind of
chorus, reducing to silence the more
recent arrivals, even if these children
are more gifted. On average only 10
to 20 per cent of the pupils in these
classes of 100 children manage to
pass into the next grade without
staying on for a second year.
The educational wastage is conse¬
quently enormous. Mr. Amon Tanoh,
Education Minister of the Ivory Coast,
has stated that "out of 10,000 children
entering primary school in any given
year, 3,900 reach the next grade, more
than half of this number after remain¬
ing in the lower grade for a second or
third year.
About 30 per cent of the initial
group reach the first-year of the inter¬
mediate classes and about 20 per cent
the second year, most of them after
seven, eight or ten years at school.
Of the 10,000 who entered the first
grade, only 1,585 less than one-sixth
obtain their primary school leaving
certificate.
Despite the crushing financial bur¬
den shouldered by these needy coun¬
tries, the returns are very low.
The second group of countries can
be said, with a few notable exceptions,
to take in Asia, Latin America and the
Middle East. Here the educational
system works quite differently. A
large proportion of children are still
not accepted for primary school educ¬
ation, but the great majority of those
who are finally pass out with a certi¬
ficate of secondary education.
For these privileged children educ¬
ation starts at the age of six and

DROPOUTS
AND
REPEATERS
Recent experience has
revealed some of the pitfalls
which have beset the
developing countries in their
eagerness to expand and
modernize education. The
enormous amount of wastage
in education and the high
proportion of children who
stay in the same grade for
two or more years is due,
among other causes, to the
lack of qualified teachers. In
some parts of Africa, out
of six children entering
primary school, only one
obtains a leaving certificate.
In the Industrially developed
countries, where in many
cases the number of
would-be university students
doubles every six or
seven years, wastage in
education is also a problem
but to a far lesser degree.
These photos symbolize
the two aspects
of the problem.

finishes at 18. Students pass without
much difficulty from one grade to the
next, and the final certificate at the
close of this easy-going school life is
generously awarded.
In this second group of countries
the dominant factor is obviously the
extension of secondary education. In
Mexico, primary education has increas¬
ed by about 50 per cent since 1955,
while secondary education has risen
by 300 per cent. Similar trends are
to be seen in several Asian countries.
Educators call this type of educational
system "porous" or "open".
A Teheran university professor has
this to say about it: "The quality of
education is worse than weak.
Secondary schools accept all candi¬
dates, even the most mediocre. I know
teachers with 70 students or even
more, who become so discouraged
that they have given up teaching their
classes. University entrants have
been so badly taught that I have even
seen students writing out their English
language lessons phonetically in Ara¬
bic script. With such an open second¬
ary education we will never form an
active elite."
However harsh the conclusion, it
would be wrong to conceal it: whether
because of educational "wastage" or
the "porousness" of school systems,
education in the Third World today is
turning out few teen-agers who tomor¬
row will be able to work for the
development of their homelands, and
even fewer who will be able to take
full advantage of the possibilities
offered by science and technology.
Education certainly, but how?
How has this situation come about?
First there has been the population
explosion, the effects of which were
calculated either inaccurately or not
at all. The result has been a general
rise in school enrolment. In Mali, for
example, ten per cent of children aged
between six and 14 a total of 68,000
went to school in 1961. Three years
later, in 1964, the proportion of the
same age group in school was still
ten per cent but the figure had almost
doubled, to 113,000.
Since Algeria's independence in
1962 the number of pupils has more
than doubled in the primary schools,
from 600,000 to 1,400,000; more than
tripled in the secondary schools, from
35.000 to 110,000; and increased more
than ten times in higher education,
from 600 to 7,000. What budget could
be expected to support such a spiral
indefinitely and at the same time to
provide for the training of qualified
staff at all levels?
The second factor has been a
reversal of the process by which educ¬
ation has extended in the past. Up
to now, whether in Europe, the United
States, the Soviet Union or Japan,
industrialization has always preceded
education, even in periods when the
birth rate fell.
In today's developed countries
there were for a long time more fac¬
tories than schools, and industry finan¬
cially supported the education which
was to provide it with urgently needed
qualified workers. Yet even so it took
Europe more than a century in this way
to provide primary education for all its
children.
In the developing countries, however,
schools are opening before the factor¬
ies in a period when the birth rate is
increasing and when man's knowledge
particularly in the fields of science
and technology is growing twenty,
fifty, or a hundredfold. Difficulties as
serious as the problem we are consid¬
ering here were bound to follow once
the decision had been made to launch
such an ambitious programme as the
introduction of universal education
within 20 years.
Do these difficulties mean that the
programme must be abandoned and
all hope of its achievement given up?
Certainly not. Should the developing
countries, then, base their approach
on the European model and wait an¬
other century before the children of
the three continents can find their
place in school? Even less so:
imitation would be no solution. Educ¬
ation remains a basic necessity, but
the experience of recent years puts
the question into a new perspective:
"for whom and how?"
The essence of the solution is to
link quantity and quality, and to find

1,500,000 technicians and engineers needed by 1980
short cuts within the education systems
themselves.
The developing countries are now
fully aware of the pitfalls into which
their early enthusiasm led them, but
they are not giving up in despair.
They are facing the problem squarely
and courageously.

_ EVERAL states have al¬
ready abandoned the principle of eight
years' obligatory schooling. Laos has
reduced the period to three years.
Dahomey has decided not to increase
the number of pupils at its primary
schools over the next few years.
The government of Tanzania has
agreed to restrict the number of chil¬
dren receiving schooling to 49 per
cent, the level attained in 1964.
George Skorov, the Soviet economist,
and formerly a specialist at the Inter¬
national Institute for Educational
Planning, set up by Unesco, has
commented: "This was a very difficult
political decision because it means
that half of each age group will help
to swell the ranks of the illiterate, who
already represent 85 per cent of men
and 96 per cent of women over the
age of 15."
Morocco envisages another solution:
to accept an increasing number of
six-year-olds but to eliminate pro¬
gressively the less gifted.
Algeria has decided to prune the
final primary grades of second-and
third-year stayers by imposing an age
limit of 13 for secondary school entry.
Nigeria, in an attempt to raise the
quality of her secondary education, is
to allow only 15 per cent of those who
have finished their primary education
to go on to secondary schools: last
year 1,000 out of 3,000 candidates
were admitted.
In Algeria over the same period,
22 per cent were admitted compared
with 70 per cent the previous year.
It is interesting to note, in passing,
that this approaches the figure in
France in 1939, when 20 per cent of
children were in secondary schools.
Finally there has been a major move
to solve the essential problem of
improving the qualification of teaching
staff: Algeria, Ivory Coast and Daho¬
mey have stopped recruiting "moni¬
tors". Today only certificate-holders
are admitted as teachers in these
countries. This is the same decision
that France took in the nineteenth cen¬
tury for its primary education.
Already a start is being made to
answering the question: "education,
but for whom?"
At the request of numerous govern¬
ments, Unesco has replied to the
second part of the question "educ¬
ation, but how?" by concentrating
much of its effort on the improvement
of the status and professional quali¬
fications of teachers.
In Latin America, Unesco, in associ¬
ation with the universities of Sao Paulo
(Brazil) and Santiago (Chile), has
trained 400 candidates in educational
administration and educational and
vocational guidance. It has also sent
experts to work at the continent's five
major teacher training colleges Pam¬
plona (Colombia), San Pablo del Lago
(Ecuador), Jinotepe and San Marcos
(Nicaragua), and Tegucigalpa (Hondu¬
ras). In two years 1,600 trainee
teachers have taken experimental
courses at the colleges using new.
methods which will in future be
extended throughout the rest of these
countries.
Unesco has also helped to organize
40 study courses and round table
discussions aimed at improving teach¬
ing methods and at providing teachers
in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Salva¬
dor, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and
Peru with opportunities for in-service
training. At the Inter American Centre
in Venezuela, problems affecting
teaching in rural areas have been
studied with Unesco's help.
In Africa, Unesco and the U.N. Dev¬
elopment Programme have helped to
set up teacher training colleges in
Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and the
Congo; and some 30 African countries
benefit from the advice of Unesco
specialists.
IHE necessity for finding
short cuts within the educational
system is one of the themes taken up
by the United 'Nations Consultative
Committee on the Application of
Science and Technology to Develop¬
ment. It is also a matter of concern
to the developing countries themselves,
and a major preoccupation of Unesco.
As Prof. Thomas Balogh, of Oxford
University, has pointed out, to imitate
blindly the systems practised in the
industrially developed part of the
world would be at once an error and
a danger.
In this connexion, and as part of a
pilot project to explore new methods
for teaching physics best suited to the
needs and teaching situation in Latin
America, Unesco brought together for
one year 26 teachers from universities
and pedagogical institutes in eight
Latin American countries. These spe¬
cialists compiled five programmed
instruction texts, eight inexpensive
laboratory kits, and 12 short silent
films as well as a half-hour sound film
as part of the course on "The Physics
of Light"
A similar pilot project for chemistry
teaching in Asia has been set up under
Unesco's auspices, and others are
under way in Africa on the teaching
of biology and in. the Arab states on
mathematics.
Increasingly important is the work
of other U.N. Specialized Agencies,
among them the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization, the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization, the World Health
Organization and the International
Labour Organization, who are multi¬
plying their efforts, whether in agricul¬
ture or meteorology, medicine or the
training of qualified workers, to raise
the standards of all forms of education
in the impoverished countries.
BIUT these combined efforts,
even with the help of bilateral aid pro¬
grammes now operating between many
countries, do not meet even half the
present needs.
By 1980 the school population of the
Third World will have risen from its
present total of 400 million to 600 mil¬
lion. It has also been estimated that
if these countries are to attain the
point of economic "take-off", they
will need 900,000 semi-skilled techni¬
cians (four times as many as today)
and 600,000 engineers and scientific
specialists (compared with 150,000
today), not to mention agronomists,
administrators, accountants or doctors.
Where is the capital to be found to
train teachers and educate children,
to build schools and universities? It
is abundantly clear that unless the
more prosperous industrialized nations
make a greater effort in this respect,
the developing nations will not begin
to free themselves of their impoverish¬
ment by 1980. The gap between dev¬
eloped and developing countries will
remain. Inevitably the first step
towards closing that gap is to raise
the level of education.
In 1967, Robert McNamara, at that
time U.S. Secretary of Defense, and
today President of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Develop¬
ment, summed up the problem of the
three gaps economic, technological
and educational when he declared:
"If the wealthy nations of the world
do not do more to close this sundering
economic split which cleaves the
planet, none of us will ultimately be
secure. The seismic social shocks
will reach us all, and with them will
come the inevitable tidal of waves of
violence. The widening economic
chasm between the rich nations and
the poor nations can be as threatening
to our security as the emergence of
nuclear weapons. It is as simple and
it is as sobering as that.
