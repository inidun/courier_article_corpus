MEXICANWRITER


Nestled in a narrow gorge of the Sierra
Madre in the heart of Mexico,
Guanajuato is one of those post-
Columbian towns hewn out of rock that
seem to spring straight from the
m o u n t a i n s. Contrasting with the arid landscape of
Cuanaxhuata (“the hill of the frogs”), this elegant
4 5 0 - y e a r-old dame of the Spanish Era continues to
protect herself behind fortifications from the region’s
fierce winds, just as she did for three centuries against
repeated attacks by the nomadic Chichemeca
p e o p l e, sworn enemies of the Spanish conquerors.
The town lies above a network of subterranean
s t r e e t s. Its majestic old mansions, baroque and neo-
classical churches, palaces, convents and hospitals
have all the charm of a bygone era.
Narrow winding streets that faithfully espouse
the uneven terrain echo with the footsteps of times
past and the crystalline tinkle of fountains splashing
onto stone slabs.And a touch of forbidden romance
still hovers on the Callejón del Beso (“Street of
the Kiss”), which is so narrow that a Romeo and
Juliet who once lived opposite each other stole
furtive embraces leaning from their balconies.Th e i r
story ended sadly: she was shut away in a convent
and he was forced to flee into exile.
The tale of a zealous explorer
who dug for hidden treasure
The spirit of Guanajuato, guarded by its stone
w a l l s, is impregnated by a rich memory which
d o e s n ’t trap the town in a sleepy past.Once upon a
time, it had just a single street that wound its way
through the rocks to reach a vast esplanade,now the
Plaza de los Pastitos. Today, modern highways cut
through the mountains, giving better access to this
tourist and university town, which is also an
economic and cultural centre.
The little provincial burg of 50,000 inhabitants
has been stirred from its slumber by the thousands
of tourists crowding its outdoor cafés, b y
businessmen drawn to its prosperity, by miners who,
like their forebears, still dig gold and silver out of the
g r o u n d ,and by students who liven up a multitude of
small squares with their youthful enthusiasm.
Not to mention the din that has engulfed the
town every October for the past 20 years or so when
the Cervantino dramatic arts festival draws leading
international performers along with hordes of
onlookers—and not always the most educated sort.
Their noisy revelling drove the townspeople to ask
the federal government to
abolish the prestigious
cultural event.
As I make my way
through this crowd, I cannot
help wondering what life
would have been like had
this town followed a more
tranquil course than its
turbulent history.At times a
bustling metropolis, a t
others a sleepy village,
Guanajuato has evolved
with the flow of political events and the ups and
downs of the mining industry.This chequered course
seems to have left its stamp on the local mentality.
Aware of their precarious existence,living off chance
d i s c o v e r i e s, forever waiting for riches while fearing

G u a n a j u a t o : fortunes made of silver
Once home to the world’s largest silver mine, this Mexican town has bred many zealous
and fiercely devout souls. Today, flocks of tourists, university students and a prestigious
theatre festival kindle its spirit

The town’s 50,000 inhabitants are aware of their fragile existence.

To say the least,this Mexican
writer, born in 1951,feels at
home in all the arts, from
photography and filmmaking to
the theatre, television and video. A
literature professor and prolific
author of literary essays, Rafael
Segovia has co-ordinated a string
of cultural events. He notably
staged a performance presented
at the 1986 Cervantino festival of
dramatic arts, The Poets’
Altarpiece, or Love and Death in
the Golden Age.A collection of his
numerous literary essays is
forthcoming.

p o v e r t y, the inhabitants of Guanajuato are cautious,
stubborn and fiercely devout.
To prove the point, take the zeal of one A n t o n i o
de Ordoñez, who convinced himself that he would
unearth a hidden treasure. When the Va l e n c i a n a
m i n e,five kilometres from the town,was abandoned
in 1760, he refused to believe its resources were
exhausted and began a long and arduous prospection
of the area.The adventure took him to the brink of
death and despair but his belief was not to be shaken.
After four years, his companions nearly gave up
on him, but he used his gifts as a preacher,
alternating sermons and prayers, to persuade them
to continue with their quest. Four more years of
ordeals and suffering passed. And then the longed-
for miracle occurred. Antonio de Ordoñez
discovered the Veta Madre, the Valenciana mother
lode, one of the richest in the world.
A 525-metre descent into 
the bowels of the earth
Ordoñez became wealthy and Guanajuato
turned into the world’s biggest silver mine. L i k e
many other mines in the region, it is still in
operation.Its main shaft is 525 metres deep and it
has almost 40 kilometres of galleries. In the
beginning, the workers went down slanting steps
more than 700 metres into the bowels of the earth.
Each miner had to climb them 14 times a day
carrying 75 kilos of ore every time.This gives an idea
of the wealth the Spanish Empire amassed over
three centuries.
To thank God for rewarding his efforts, O r d o ñ e z
decided to offer part of the riches he had drawn
from the earth, so he built a magnificent church, o n e
of the most impressive in the whole country. The
altarpiece covered with gold leaf, the rich decoration
and still largely intact paintings and artifacts make
La Valenciana church a unique example of
Churrigueresque art, the Mexican baroque that
smoothly combines Indian and Spanish styles.
Once the bastion of the 
strictest Catholic morality
A quick tour of Guanajuato suffices to
understand the predominant role played by the
Catholic church. In the 17th and 18th centuries
a l o n e, more than 15 convents, t e m p l e s, c h u r c h e s
and chapels were built in an area of less than two
square kilometres,which is today the old city centre.
Such religious zeal is also reflected in the street
n a m e s.Calle del Campanero (“Bellringer Street”),
for example, commemorates Luis A n t o n i o
S o l o r z a n o, the Santa Fé parish bellringer who ruled
the townspeople’s lives at the beginning of the 20th
c e n t u r y, letting them know when it was time for
m a s s, when wakes for the dead were being held
a n d , if necessary,when the curfew hour had arrived.
For many years Guanajuato was a bastion of the
strictest Catholic morality. The inhabitants, l o c k e d
inside the town as if in one huge house,all knew each
other and anyone who broke the rules of decency was
singled out for reproach. It was fertile ground for all
kinds of outlandish passions, which Jo r g e
Ibagüengoitia wove into thoughtful and humorous
s t o r i e s. The work of this warm-hearted, t a l e n t e d
Guanajuato native, who died young in 1983, s t i l l
inspires Mexican playwrights and new wave
fil m m a k e r s, immortalizing the surreal and
conservative mood of this little town slowly being
eclipsed by modern life. ■

Narrow lanes echo tales of forbidden romance.
