1 Former Soviet bloc
No quick fix
w Stephen Holmes
Fo re i g n e rs have swamped the former Soviet bloc with legal advice,
but the results have fallen far short of expectations
Over the past half-dozen ye a rs , a flock of
foreign development agencies and pri vat e
foundations have organized a multimillion-
dollar effort to promote “the rule of law ” in the for-
mer Soviet bloc.Aimed at fostering stability in the
r e gi o n , these multilateral and bilateral effort s ,o f t e n
ove r l a p p i n g, were not entirely eleemosynary.W h i l e
political stability would reduce the security bu r d e n
on the West,economic stability would presumably
p r ovide a new market for We s t e rn goods and a
favourable business climate for We s t e rn inve s t m e n t .
Embedded in these legal assistance progr a m m e s
are a handful of basic assumptions, the most impor-
tant of which is that the free market is creat e d , s u s-
t a i n e d , and constantly re-attuned by legi s l at i ve and
a d j u d i c at i ve decisions that must be reliably enfor-
c e d .E s s e n t i a l l y, l aw is seen as a springboard to eco-
nomic deve l o p m e n t . In line with this idea, the lion’s
share of foreign aid for legal reform in Eastern
Europe and Russia has been devoted to improv i n g
the security of acquisitions and transactions.
But considerable resources have also been
aimed at promoting, for instance, voting rights and
due-process rights for criminal suspects. Unfortu-
nately, in these areas too, more attention has been
paid to on-paper legi s l at i ve advances than to solving
pervasive problems of compliance and implemen-
t at i o n .S t rictly on-paper reform efforts flowed nat u-
rally from the weakness of enforcement capacities in
Eastern Europe after 1989 and Russia after 1991,
and to some extent from a long tradition of legal
r e g u l ations which appeared “on the books” bu t
were not followed or enforced in practice.
W h at have we learned from these imperfect
efforts?
Lesson one:
the magnitude of the problem
The first steps of legal reform , such as the draf-
ting and ratification of a bill of rights,may be rela-
tively easy. But subsequent steps,such as creating
an honest civil service,are much harder.
I m p r oving the quality of public institutions
requires a broad and deep social consensus and
capacity for co-operat i o n . L aw is a public good,
and politically disorganized societies, by defin i t i o n ,
have a hard time creating public goods.The unde-
renforcement of basic rights in,say, Russia is often
a product of fiscal insolve n cy. The miserably low
s a l a ries and benefits of Russian judges, which have
engendered a crisis of unders t a f fing and low - q u a l i t y
personnel, constitute a major obstacle to the deli-
very of justice in the Russian Federation.
One must thus recognize that legal reform is a
branch of state-building. Legal development pro-
jects have scored only modest successes in the
r e gion because, among other reasons, the post-
communist state remains incapable of repressing
force and fraud.
But the post-communist state must not only
become stronger; it must simultaneously become
more accountable. Accountable gove rn m e n t , i n
t u rn , presupposes a society well-organized enough
to discipline office-holders.

Foundation’s legal reform
programme in Eastern Europe and
Russia

Human-rights projects in the region have ten-
ded to channel resources toward private actors in
civil society and to neglect gove rnment as a part n e r.
Commercial-law projects, by contrast, have chan-
neled resources, including We s t e rn expert i s e , t o
g ove rnmental agencies, neglecting “civil society”
or private-sector actors as potential partners. The
first lesson of a half-decade of abortive or stalled
legal reform is therefore the need to compensat e
for these symmetrical short c o m i n g s. Legal deve-
lopment projects must aim at increasing the res-
ponsiveness of government to social interests and
opinions.
Lesson two:
the illusions of reform 
by decree
The rule of law implies that the legi s l at u r e
wields serious powers and bears serious responsi-
b i l i t i e s. It is therefore next to impossible to conduct
a successful legal reform programme without a
r e f o rm majority in the lawmaking body. If the legi s-
l ature and the exe c u t i ve branches are unable to co-
operate, as they are in Russia,many of the laws in
force will be anti-reform or, at the ve ry least, i n c o m-
petently or shoddily drafted.
The designers of foreign technical assistance
p r o grammes should not, t h e r e f o r e , ove r e s t i m at e
the effectiveness of rule of decree, that is, by one-
sided exe c u t i ve-branch decisions, t h at do not repre-
sent a wide social consensus and have not been
hammered out in a process of consultation with
social forces outside a small clique in the Kremlin.
Foreign-funded projects should target technical
assistance to areas of legal reform where exe c u t i ve -
legislative co-operation is possible.
Lesson three:
the inadequacy 
of mirror-imaging
Much of We s t e rn legal-development aid has
aimed at replicating We s t e rn institutions abroad.
In the early 1990s, e s p e c i a l l y,We s t e rn-trained legal-
d e velopment professionals often strove to trans-
f o rm the legal systems of Eastern Europe and Rus-
sia to make them resemble the legal systems they
knew at home. But law is not a kitchen appliance
t h at we can unplug in the United States or Ger-
m a ny and simply plug in again in Bucharest or
Sofia. Recipient input in (even a veto over) model
selection and import is essential.
Lesson four:
lack of trained development
professionals
Lawyers are trained to solve routine problems
within routine procedures.They are not trained to
r e flect creat i vely on the emergence and stabiliza-
tion of the complex institutions which law ye ri n g
silently presupposes. Ordinary legal training, the-
r e f o r e , is not adequate to the extraordinary pro-
blems faced by the manager of a legal deve l o p m e n t
project in Eastern Europe or Russia.Legal reform
cannot succeed without attention to social context,
local infrastru c t u r e , professional skills, l o gi s t i c
capacities,and political support.
The much-lamented lack of donor co-ordina-
tion is rooted in the weak theoretical framewo r k
underlying the foreign funding of legal reform .T h e
European Union and the U. S . should jointly creat e
and fund a “Legal Reform Strat e gies Centre” t o
p r ovide a “ d ri ve r ’s manual” for legal reform ,b a s e d
on empirical studies.
Lesson five:
project selection,
governmental support
For the sake of sustainability, project selection
must give greater weight to recipient interest and
commitment than to donor interest and commit-
ment.Law is an aspect of sovereignty. As a conse-
quence,many foreign-funded rule-of-law projects
will inevitably operate under joint supervision of
the foreign donor and the local government.This
doubling of oversight and reporting requirements
m ay in some cases paralyze the operation of the
p r o gramme or destroy its coherence. This is rea-
son enough for development agencies to continue
to work as closely as possible with “ c l i e n t s ” or part-
ners within the government.That necessity, howe-
ver,imposes certain limits on project selection.
The “ rule of law ” s l o g a n , r e m e m b e r , is redo-
lent of the Cold War, when it was used to express
the We s t ’s sense of moral superi o rity over the Sov i e t
b l o c.To d ay, it is essential that We s t e rn - financed law
p r o grammes avoid all appearance of tri u m p h a l i s m
or imperi a l i s m . Since anti-piracy laws aim at
making Russians pay more for We s t e rn videos,
C D s , and softwa r e , over-emphasis on such laws can
leave the impression that the West is seeking “tri-
bute”after its “victory”in the Cold War.
Lesson six:
project selection: social support 
Given the limited resources at the disposal of
foreign legal assistance progr a m m e s , it makes sense
to choose projects strat e gi c a l l y. Projects with some
potential for producing interim successes—and the-
refore able to sustain donor interest and commit-
ment—should be favoured over projects that will
have no visible benefits for 20 or 50 years.
In general, foreign support should be given to
l aw reform efforts which combine top-down and
bottom-up features,working both with the regula-
tors and the regulated.Stated differently, the crea-
tion of a functioning ru l e - o f - l aw system depends
on negotiated ru l e - m a k i n g . Foreign-funded legal
development projects should aim at strengthening
c o n s u l t at i ve and co-operat i ve relations betwe e n
s t ate and society.The relat i ve strength of such rela-
tions in Poland and Hungary helps explain the
modest but important advances they have achie-
ved in the area of legal reform . It is the weakness of
s t ate-society relations elsewhere in the form e r
S oviet bloc that explains the weakness of the rule of
law in many post-communist states today. n
