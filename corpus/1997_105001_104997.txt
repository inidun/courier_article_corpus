In India, between the Ganges
I and the foothills of the
Himalayas, grows a shrub with pale
pink flowers, smooth leaves and
milky saj). In Hindi it is railed
chotachund. According to a local
legend mongooses use to feed on the
plant before fighting cobras, and its
root is still administered as an anti¬
dote to snakebite. Its use gradually
spread to the neighbouring provinces
and then to the whole country. In
Miliar province, for example, it has
been used to treat insanity, epilepsy
and insomnia. In the eighteenth Cen¬
tury European botanists named the
shrub llauvolfia serpentina. It was
studied and analysed, and today it is
one of the most effective drugs used
to treat high blood pressure.
An interdisciplinary science
Elhnobotany, the study of the rela¬
tionship between plants and people,
is a marriage ol several disciplines
anthropology, botany, chemistry, ecol¬
ogy, linguistics and pharmacology, lis
field ranges from the use made of
¡liants by local populations to the
environmental and cultural impact
that the disappearance of a plant can
have on its environment. This inter-

disciplinary science is mainly prac¬
tised in developing countries and with
indigenous populations because in
that context the link between pro¬
duction and consumption is far more
direct than it is in the industrialized
world. An Amazonian Indian will go
out and pick the leaf he needs to
treat a burn, whereas in developed
countries not many people know that
the pretty foxglove (Digitalis pur¬
purea) growing in the garden is the
basis of the medicine they take for
their heart condition.
Some of the reasons for today's
growing interest in ethnobotany are
psychological (a revival of interest
in nature and "natural" products, a
sense of urgency that has arisen
because the knowledge and tradi¬
tions of indigenous peoples are dying
out), while others are more prag¬
matic (people in the poorest coun¬
tries often cannot get hold of and
above all cannot afford modern
drugs).
The World Health Organization
(WHO) is trying to restore respect
for traditional medicine, and many
other international organizations and
non-governmental organizations have
followed suit. In 1992 the World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
UiMESCO and the Royal Botanic Car-
dens, Kew (UK) launched a joint
programme called "People and
Plants" "to promote the conserva¬
tion of biodiversity and the sustain¬
able and equitable use of plant
resources by providing support to
ethnobotanists from developing
countries".
As part of the programme, on-the-
ground activities are organized in
biosphere reserves, World Heritage
sites and other protected areas.
Their goal is to record useful plants
and knowledge, solve the on-going
dilemma between conservation and
exploitation in protected zones,
invent non-destructive ways of har¬
vesting wild plants, and ensure that
conservation and the sound exploita¬
tion of plant resources really do ben¬
efit local communities. Local people,
park and reserve staff, researchers
and university students are taking
part in the programme, to which

guide entitled Ethnobotany, A Meth¬
ods Manual, which sums up what
has been learned during the first four
years.

Learning from shamans
An ethnobotanist working in the field
must have received a rigorous scien¬
tific training. He or she also needs
to be physically tough, adaptable
and a good listener. In his hook Tales
of a Shaman's Apprentice, Ameri¬
can ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin,
who spent more than ten years in
Amazonia, describes how he learned
the local language, followed the
shamans, collected samples, made
a herbarium and noted the uses that
were made of plants, lie analysed
medicines, the vegetal poison on the
lips of arrows and the hallucinogenic,
substances used during initiation
ceremonies.
He recorded the words of an old
Amazonian shaman who said: "It is
true the youngsters do not want to
learn. One day the medicines that
the missionaries send from the city
will no longer arrive. The people here
will come to me to relieve, their pains,
to conquer the evil spirits that kill
their children. But I will be gone,
and I will have taken my plants with
me." Unlike modern doctors,
shamans, medicine men and
fetishists treat the mind and the
body. They also help to maintain the
group's cultural identity.
Shamans cannot practise their
skills without preparation. They
must be initiated, often using hal¬
lucinogenic substances like
ayahuasca (Uanisteriopsis caapi),

or "vine of the soul", which are a
passport to the spirit world. It is not
surprising that missionaries try to
eradicate these practices and beliefs
and discourage shamans from tak¬
ing disciples. It is just as easy to
understand why Mark Plotkin has
launched a training programme for
apprentice shamans in several coun¬
tries, with support from a non-gov¬
ernmental organization, Conserva¬
tion International.
Friends of humanity
Plants have always been part of
human history. "Thatch for huts,
timbers for boats, fibers for cordage
and textiles and dyes to colour them,
and a plethora of medicinal plants all
appear at early stages of human pre
history," write Michael Balick and
Paul Alan Cox in their remarkable
book, Plants, People and Culture.
Plants provide food, clothing, shel¬
ter, building materials, medication
and ingredients of ritual. Unlike ani¬
mals that have to eat either ¡liants or
other animals, plants live on sun, car¬
bon dioxide from the air, a few min¬
eral salts and a little water. From
these basic elements they produce
molecules that are sometimes so
complex that no laboratory can syn¬
thesize them.
Humanity has recorded some
250,000 flowering plants, but this is
not necessarily an exhaustive figure.
There is no great hook of nature

coveries and cross out species that

have ceased to exist, yet we know
that plants are victims of deforesta¬
tion, soil erosion, pollution, herbi¬
cides, urban expansion and even over-
harvesting. The United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization
defines biodiversity as "the diversity
of life on earth: it includes all life
forms and the ecosystems of which
they are a part". Its reduction
results in the loss of irreplaceable
genetic materials that are the essen¬
tial components of the plant and ani¬
mal life that agriculture and other
human activities depend on.
The poor countries and their tra¬
ditional pharmacopeia face another
threat, however. Pharmaceutical
and other laboratories that use the
observations of cthnobotanists are
taking part in a "plant rush" to take
samples from nature, then large
quantities of primary plant matter in
order to produce drugs and cosmet¬
ics. To illustrate the problem, the
People and Plants Programme com¬
missioned Australian Tony Cunning¬
ham and Cameroonian Fonki
Mbenkum to study the sustainabil-
ity of harvesting the bark of the
Prunus africana tree in Cameroon.

A patent problem
This is a tree that grows especially
well in the cool, volcanic soil of
Africa's mountainous regions. It is a
wild-growing cousin of the peach,
apricot and almond trees and is
found in Kenya, Uganda and Zaire,
and also in Madagascar and the
Comoros Islands. It is especially
abundant in the southwest and
northwest regions of Cameroon. Its
bark is known in much of Africa as a
treatment for malaria, stomach ache
and fever. In 1966, a French labo¬
ratory discovered that it is an active
agent in the treatment of prostate
swelling, and applied for a patent,
followed by three other European
laboratories. In a single place 424
tonnes of bark were gathered from
7,717 Prunus trees between Decem¬
ber 1984 and December 1985.
Unfortunately, instead of simply tak¬
ing bands of bark, harvesters often
strip the tree bare so that it dies,
thus depriving traditional medicine
of one of its resources.
In this way the increased life
expectancy of western Europeans
has an impact on the Cameroonian
forest, since one European male out
of two over the age of 80 has a nine
out of ten chance of suffering from
this prostate affliction.
It is increasingly imperative to
adopt an ethical approach to
exploitation of the resources of
developing countries, and this is one
of the goals of the People and Plants
Programme. An ethical code is
urgently needed. Greedy for new
products, the pharmaceutical com¬
panies "buy" or "borrow" plant
species and file patents on them. The
neem (Azirdiruchtu indica), a tree
used for as long as anyone can
remember as a pesticide in India,
has been patented by an American
company. Stranger still, a vine grow¬
ing in the Amazonian jungle, known
to shamans for its hallucinogenic
qualities and used in initiation cer¬
emonies, has been patented by an
American and marketed via the
Internet.
But who can stop a villager from
"selling" a plant from his garden or
a traveller from quietly pocketing
it? Who can p revent a laboratory
from borrowing a specimen from a
botanical garden? If and when an
ethical code is promulgated, ways
of implementing it will still have to
he found.
