A
International
Book Year
by René Maheu
Director-General
of Unesco
S we embark on
the year 1972 which has
been unanimously proclaim¬
ed International Book
Year by Unesco's General
Conference, I invite all the
countries of the world to
join in this great venture,
each according to its resour¬
ces and needs, and to adopt
the Year's slogan "Books
for All".
For thousands of years
the written word and for
centuries the printed word
have played a vital role
in the preservation and
transmission of knowledge.
They have been man's most
effective ally in fashioning
his thought and in his con¬
quest of freedom. Even if
certain cultures have been
founded on communication
by word and gesture these
cultures can no longer hope
to survive or indeed develop
in the modern world with¬
out recourse to the written
word.
The book is the most
dependable and the most
convenient instrument of
communication ever devi¬
sed by man. With the book
the human mind for the first
time was able to conquer
time and then space. In the
past quarter of a century we
have witnessed the devel¬
opment of the book as one
of the means of mass com¬
munication and we must not
fail to recognize the role
and place of the book in the
service of the new spirit of
community that the mass
media have made possible.
There exists in the world
today a tremendous need
for reading. So great is this
need that for large portions
of the world's population

one can speak of a verit¬
able "book famine". Yet
while the technical revolu¬
tion that has taken place in
the production and distribu¬
tion of books has made it
possible to place on the
market an ever-increasing
number of relatively inex¬
pensive, good quality books,
the developing countries
are suffering from a scarc¬
ity of books that is becom¬
ing more acute as educa¬
tional opportunities grow.
The developing countries
at present produce no more
than one-fifth of the total

number of books published
in the world so they must
rely on book imports from
abroad to help meet at least
part of their needs. In the
long run their full require¬
ments can only be met by
setting up their own national
publishing industries.
Unesco's world program¬
me for the promotion of
books aims specifically to
redress this serious imba¬
lance between the develop¬
ed and the developing
countries. But the problem
is not only one of quantity.
It is equally or more im¬
portant that the book the
unparalleled instrument for
setting down man's wisdom
and knowledge promote
individual fulfilment and so¬
cial progress; that it give all
persons a chance to appre¬
ciate the best that the
human mind has to offer the
world over; and that it serve
to create a better under
standing between peoples
as a necessary step toward
a true and lasting peace.
Even in countries with a
thriving publishing industry,
the book has by no means
as yet become an integral
part of everyone's life.
These countries have no
problem of getting the book
to the reader, thanks to their
extensive distribution sys¬
tems and outlets. More
often than not, the real prob¬
lem for many of them now
(though it varies considera¬
bly from country to country)
is how to get the reader to
the book. This is borne out
by the high percentage of
non-readers revealed by re¬
cent surveys.
Has the time not come for
a full re-appraisal of the
problems of publishing so
that electronic and audiovi¬
sual techniques, which are
exerting a growing influence
on books, may be placed at
the service of the publishing
world? Since the book
can no longer be isolated
from the other major infor¬
mation media, should we not
now re-examine its role in
society?
THESE are the types
of problems the world com¬
munity is invited to ponder
during International Book
Year so that solutions may
be worked out with the help
of course of public authori¬
ties but also with that of all
types of institutions whether
they be regional, national or
international as well as pri¬
vate individuals.
If International Book Year
must be, above all, a natio
nal effort within each coun¬
try aimed at mobilizing ener¬
gies and resources and
sparking off concrete initia¬
tives, it must also be a vast
movement of international
co-operation.
In view of the immense
needs of the developing
countries, governments and
bodies administering bilat¬
eral or multilateral aid pro¬
grammes should make avail¬
able to these countries the
necessary technical and fi¬
nancial assistance to pro¬
mote national book produc¬
tion and distribution.
During International Book
Year, a preponderant role
will naturally be played by
the organizations grouping
the professional members
of the book world such as
the authors, publishers,
librarians and booksellers
who have been closely asso¬
ciated with the launching of
International Book Year and
who have further demons¬
trated their co-operative
spirit by adopting a common
"Charter of the Book".
But International Book
Year is above all the con¬
cern of the millions of ordi¬
nary people for whom read¬
ing books is part of their
daily occupation, or a means
of personal enlightenment
or a source of escape and
reverie in a word, insepar¬
able from happiness and the
dignity of living.
Let us all work and act
together to make "Books
for All" a reality for all.
