FROM FOREST TO PRINTER
As soon as man invented ways of expressing his thoughtsthrough drawings and characters, he began to look
around him for"something to write on."Among the first
substances which came to his hand were bones, stones and wood,
after which he turned to slabs of clay or metal. He tried fabrics,
then palm or papyrus leaves and nnally animal skins, from which
he obtained parchment-a material which some lawyers in
Europe and America continued to use until the 19th century.
But, all these writing surfaces had one drawback or another.
Those that were neither bulky nor liable to deterioration were
found to be very expensive. A bible printed by Gutenberg on
parchment, for example, required the use of 300 sheeps skins.
The Chinese, prolific writers and remarkable calligraphers, pro-
gressed rapidly, however, from the use of bones and tree barks
to that of bamboo and silk, and in the first century A. D. they
used slim rods, rather like Venetian blinds, to make books.
It was the rapid development of calligraphy by Chinese
scholars and their adoption of the camel's hair brush and fluid
pigment that produced the need for a writing substance that was
cheaper and more practical than woven textile.
This urgent need for a new writing surface inspired the
Chinese eunuch Tsai Lun to proclaim, in A. D. 105, his marvel-
lous invention of true paper-a thin felted material formed on
fist, porous moulds from macerated vegetable fibre.
The Chinese were quick to realize the importance of this
discovery, and Tsai Lun was venerated almost as a deity by suc-
ceeding generations of his countrymen. The manufacture and
use of paper spread with amazing rapidity and the records of
the following centuries contain many references to its employ-
ment, not only for writing and bibliographical purposes, but for

PAPERMAKING TOOK OVER 1000 YEARS
TO SPREAD FROM CHINA TO EUROPE

ornamental use in Chinese houses
and temples in the farthermost
corners of the Empire.
The art of papermaking took a
long time to cross frontiers, how-
ever, and it was only at the start of
the 7th century that the secret of
the production methods as used in
Korea, then a part of China, was
learned in nearby Japan. The
Japanese used it about the year
770 for preparing printed charms
at the order of the Empress Sho-
toku and thus produced the
world's first printing on paper.
Towards the West the spread of
knowledge about paper took even
longer, for the Celestial Empire
kept the manufacturing process a
closely guarded secret.
In 751, however, a battle was
fought by the Chinese in Turkes-
tan on the banks of the Charaz
river. Among the Chinese taken
prisoner there were a number of
skilled papermakers and their cap-
tors set them to work. By the
year 900, paper was being manu-
factured in Egypt and two centu-
ries later in Fez, Morocco, from
where the craft travelled to Spain.
The first papermaking mill was
set up at Jativa in the province of
Valencia, and in 1150 the geo-
grapher EI-Edrisi said of the city :
"Paper is there manufactured,
such as cannot be found anywhere
else in the civilized world, and is
sent to the East and to the West."
The papermakers were mostly
Jews who carried on their work
under the protection of the Caliph.
They continued to enjoy this pro-
tection under the new authorities
after the province of Valencia was
reconquered by Jaime I in 1238
A. D.
Thus it had taken over 1, 000
years for papermaking to spread
from China to Europe where the
early paper was regarded with
disfavour, being higher in price
and more fragile than parchment,
which had hitherto been used for
making books. Paper was dis-
trusted also on account of its
introduction by"'infidels."In
1268, however, a paper factory
was set up at Fabriano, near
Ancona, Italy, and soon became
very prosperous."From Fa-
briano,"proclaimed the city's
coat of arms,"paper is sent all
over the world."This was the
were not set up until about 1348.
Shortly afterwards in Nuremburg,
Senator Ulman Stromer built a
mill with the assistance of skilled
Italian workers who, in 1391, tried
to organize the first strike in the
history of papermaking. The in-
dustry as a whole developed slowly
and it was often the sudden in-
crease of local needs that brought
about the construction of plants.
A typical example was the one set
up by the General Assembly of
Basle.
The discovery of printing, or
rather, the introduction of print-
FIVE STEPS IN MAKING PAPER
No matter what kind of paper is made there are five steps that
must be followed in order to produce a sheet of uniform strength and
quality from the cellulose fibre of a tree or other planet, These five
steps are :
1) separate the cellulose fibre from the raw material.
2) reduce the fibre to a watery pulp.
3)"beat"the pulp until the fibres are of the required thinness
and are thoroughly mixed with certain materials or chemicals.
4) form a"web"of paper on a fine sieve which lets the water run
through but holds the solid parts in a thin, even layer on top.
5) dry, smooth and finish the paper web in various ways.
results of the improvements
brought to the manufacturing
processes by Italian craftsmen.
By the : end of the 13th century,
twelve sheets of paper cost the
same price as one sheet of parch-
ment, thanks to these craftsmen.
Other mills were set up at Bolo-gna, Cividale, Padua, Treviso and
Genoa, and the renown of Italian
paper spread as far as Asia.
The French and the Germans
continued for a long time to buy
this paper. In France it seems
that the first centres for paper-
making, at Troyes and Bar-Ie-Duc,
ing in the West towards the
middle of the 15th century, gave
a powerful boost to the paper in-
dustry, and in the battles of
humanism, of the Reformation and
the counter-Reformation these
arms were widely used.
In England, however, paper con-
tinued to be despised. It was only
towards the end of the 16th cen-
tury that a German, John Spel-
man, one of the goldsmiths to
Queen Elizabeth, managed to open
a business which quickly prosper-
ed.
Prior to this, the Dutch had
built a mill at Dordrecht. They
took advantage of the distress
caused in Germany by the Thirty
Years'War and of the mistakes
made by France after the revoca-
tion of the Edict of Nantes. By
the 17th century, Dutch paper was
considered to be the finest in the
world, and it was at Amsterdam
that the papermaker, Wilhelm
Rittinghausen, studied the craft
before emigrating to America,
where he set up a paper mill at
Germantown, Philadelphia, in
1690. His mill, however, was not
the first in the New World, where
since 1580,"a mill with a hammer
in which paper is made"had been
functioning at Culhuacan, in
Mexico. And, in any case, the
Mayas had already discovered
how to make paper centuries
before.
By the end of the 17th century
paper was being manufactured in
all the countries of the West, and,
with a few modifications, it was
being made by the same methods
and under the same physical diffi-
culties as those experienced by the
workers who produced the first
true paper for Tsai Lun in China,
fifteen centuries earlier.
Even in our mechanized age,
the processes used in the making
of paper are basically the same.
The raw material-bamboo, rags,
straw, bark or coniferous wood-
still has to be softened and
ground. Pressing and drying
remain essential. As in the Far
East, the vatman continues to be
the most important worker in the
small-scale production of high-
class paper ; he it is who with-
draws the mould which has been
plunged into the pulp, and then
shakes it so that the fibres fall in
perfect formation. He is assisted
being round, and their delivery to a newspaper building, where they will be transformed into"tomorrow's newspapers".

by the coucher who skilfully re-
moves the sheet onto the felt, until
he has a pile of sheets and felts
ready for the press. He too is a
craftsman-and for him there
has been no outstanding innova-
tion for a couple of thousand
years. In fact, until the invention
of machinery, improvements were
extremely rare. _
A long time has passed since the
Arabs did away with pestle and
mortar in the manufacture of pa-
per ; these past masters in the art
of irrigation were quick to turn
to water-power for crushing the
raw material. The paper mill
which they invented, with its bat-
tery of beavers, remained in use
for centuries with but few modifi-
cations. Not until the 17th cen-
tury was it replaced by the Hol-
lander, a water-wheel which
revolved a wooden cylinder fitted
with 36 iron knives. Little by
little the Hollander was improved.
In 1750 John Baskerville invented
a wire frame for it which"wove"
a paper that was perfectly smooth
- vellum.
while research continued on
new developments, discoveries no
less startling were being made in
the sphere of raw materials.
Réaumur observed that wasps
made their nests from wood fila-
ments that resembled paper-but
the"experts"were sceptical when
he suggested that man, too, could
make paper from wood. Chris-
tian Jacob Schaeffer, a Regens-
burg clergyman, fought hard to
prove he was right : but his idea
was not definitely accepted until
Friedrich Gottlob Keller, a weaver
from Saxony, discovered wood
pulp in 1844. It is to him that
the modern paper industry owes
fifty per cent of its prosperity.
For the other fifty per cent, the
inventors of machinery must be
thanked. The main operation in
papermaking-draining out the
moisture-was done by hand
until about 1820, when mechaniza-
tion took over. In 1798 Nicolas
Louis Robert invented a paper-
making machine (later perfected
by engineers such as Bryan
Donkin and the Fourdrinier Bro-
thers), which revolutionized the
industry, for, by enabling paper
of unlimited length to be produc-
ed, it made possible the modern
rotary press.
The Paper Age goes back hun-
dreds of years in the Far East,
and it would be hard to say which
people and era made the greatest
use of paper. In the sixth century
the Emperor Kao Tsung instituted
paper money, and it was even plac-
ed in tombs instead of pieces of
silver. Marco Polo was amazed
at the amount and variety of
paper which the Chinese set on fire
at their ceremonies. Before his
time, Turkish explorers had
remarked on its everyday use in
Chinese homes : linings for cloth-
ing, sandals, slippers, toys, petards
and fireworks made of paper were
accepted as a matter of course.
In Japan, as is well known,
there were multifarious uses of
paper : window-panes (scientin-
cally a sound idea, as paper lets in
the ultra-violet rays), lanterns,
screens, umbrellas, overcoats,
bags, covers. Plain or finished,
oiled or glued, pulped or made into
cardboard, articles made of paper
formed an indispensable part of
everyday life.
Little by little, the idea spread
to Europe and America. Even
before the discovery of wood pulp,
vehicle builders had made coaches
of paper. But the lack of raw
material hampered the industry :
so much so that in the 1850s, a
number of American paper firms
tried to combat the shortage by
importing mummies from Egypt
and using their bandages.
Perhaps it is fortunate that at
about the same time wood pulp
made its first appearance, and in
1854, collars, cuffs and shirt fronts
made of paper were on sale in
New York. Ten years later,
aprons, hats, carpets, casks and
floorings were being made of it.
It was used to make coffins (but
the Persians had thought of that
idea long before then), houses,
and at least a couple of churches :
one in Oslo, the other in London.
In 1883 a Dresden clockmaker
produced a clock made entirely of
paper. In 1891 the Bell Company
used paper as an insulator for
telephone cables. In 1897 a horse-
shoe made of paper was intro-
duced in Chicago : it was then the
latest of a thousand applications
of this proteinic substance. Now,
there are 14, 000 uses made of it.
There is little doubt that plas-
tics will eliminate many of these
uses. But today printing works
are more then ever before crying
out for millions of tons of it-
and the papermakers are unable
to satisfy them.

PAPER : Pbnt or vegetable
fibre called cellulose,
is at base of almost
every kind of paper.
The cellulose fibre of
any plant will produce
paper, but in practice
only a few kinds are
used commercially. To-
day two-thirds of all
paper is made from
woodpulp. Some is
made from hemp, jute,
straw, cornstalks, su-
gar cane waste or rags.
About a quarter of all
new paper comes from
waste paper.
PULPWOOD : the trees, or
soft wood from these
trees, used in paper-
making. Spruce, pop-
lar, hemlock, white
pine, basewood are the
most usual pulpwoods.
WOODPULP : the ground-up
pulp made from pulp-
wood trees either me-
chanically (by crush-
ing) or by chemical
process. Four kinds of
woodpulp are produced
and used in various
combinations :
1. Groundwood pulp :
contains all the im-
purities. Newsprint is
about 75% groundwood.
2. Sulphite pulp : wood
chips treated with che-
mical fumes to purify
the cellulose. Impor-
tant basis of most book
papers. 3. Soda pulp :
wood chips boiled with
caustic soda produces
soft bulky pulp. Gives
mellowness to many
kinds of book paper.
4. Sulphate pulp : So-
dium sulphate and
other chemicals pro-
duce strong, dark fibres
used for wrapping pa-
pert.
NEWSPRINT : machine-
finished paper, usually
in rolls, made chiefly
from groundwood pulp
and used mostly for
newspapers. Esparto
grass (a Spanish and
Algerian grass) is also
used, chiefly in Eng-
land. Nearly 45 % of
world's paper produc-
tion is newsprint.
BOOK PAPER : made largely
from sulphite and so-
da woodpulp. Used for
books, magazines and
other printing papers.
When dipped in a gela-
tine-like solution paper
dries smoother and less
absorbant to ink. Me-
tal and fibre rollers give
extra high smooth fin-
ish. Book paper con-
J'titutes 20 % of world's
paper output.
PRINTING PAPER : general
term including news-
print and book paper.
WRITING PAPER : includes
bond and ledger papers.
Linen and cotton rags
are reserved today for
highest grade paper.
WRAPPING PAPER : Made
of various fibre-
wood, straw, jute, old
rope and twine, manila
hemp (hence name
"manila paper") and
old paper. Kraft, used
for wrapping and grain
and flour sacks, is a
very tough dark-brown
paper made of digested
wood chips.
"BIBLE"PAPER : usually
made of linen rags.
RICE PAPER : What is usual-
ly called rice paper is
not paper, has nothing
to do with rice. It
is a natural tissue de-
rived from pith of a
tree. But paper made
from rice straw is also
called rice paper.
