HORSES
FOR THE HEREAFTER
by Mikhail P. Gryaznov
FOR many centuries, the immense
expanse of the steppes from
the river Danube to the Great
Wall of China formed a single vast
cultural-historical region. The nu¬
merous tribes of this region, who
lived in constant contact with each
other, differed in their historical past,
as well as in their ethnographic
heritage, but created for themselves
a culture which was uniform in its
general outlines.
This broad uniformity resulted from
the fact that the culture had taken
shape through a series of identical
stages of development, which unfol¬
ded simultaneously across the whole
belt of the steppes. This process
began in the Aeneolithic period, the
time of transition from the Stone
Age to the era of metals. In the
steppes of Eurasia this transition
coincided with that from the system
of acquisitive economy (hunting,
fishing and food-gathering) to the
productive economy, which in this
case centred on cattle-breeding.
The uniformity in the historical
development of all. the steppe tribes
became particularly evident in the
time of the Scythians, when the
population of the steppes went over
to the nomadic way of life, became
highly mobile and developed under
conditions of extensive inter-tribal
cultural exchanges.
In recent years, terms such as
"cultures of Scytho-Siberian type"
and "the Scytho-Siberian animal
style" have begun to be used more
and more frequently. However,
there has still been very little study
of the Asian part of the Scytho-
Siberian cultural world. Specialists
in Scythian history tend to focus
their attention pn the monuments of
the northern Black Sea area and the
MIKHAIL PETROVICH GRYAZNOV,
member of the Archaeological Institute of
the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in
Leningrad, has directed excavations of the
tomb-complex of Arzhan (Autonomous Soviet
Republic of Tuva) and of tombs at Pazyryk
in the Altai mountains (Siberia). Professor
of Siberian archaeology at the university of
Leningrad, he is the author of many published
works including a study on the first burial
mound excavated at Pazyryk.
problems of the origin of those tribes
which may properly be called
Scythian. Discussion centres on
the question of the origin of the
Scythians and the composition of
the Scythian animal style.
Until recently, the only undisputed
premise in these arguments was that
Scythian culture and art came into
being in the 7th century B.C. and
that the attainments of Scythian
culture with its presumed pre-Asiatic
sources slowly spread to the East in
somewhat modified forms.
However, it is also true to say that
scholars have for long been study¬
ing some remarkable monuments
of the culture of the early nomads
of Siberia, magnificent specimens of
their original art. Among these are
the amazing gold collection of
Peter I, the Pazyryk kurgans (burial
mounds) in the Altai (see page 31),
and the bronze objects and megalithic
enclosures of the kurgans of the
Tagar culture on the river Yenisey.
During the last 20 years, monu¬
ments of the early Scythian period
have been discovered in Central
and Southern Kazakhstan, as well as
in the western foothills of the Altai
and in Tuva. It has become clear
that cultures of Scythian type came
into being in the East no later than
in Scythia itself. They were created
and flourished at the same time and
parallel with that culture which was
properly Scythian.
Many Scythian specialists were
surprised by the discovery in 1971,
at different points in the Scytho-
Siberian lands, of three remarkable
monumentsthe royal kurgan of
Ptichata Mogila in Bulgaria, near
the town of Varna, two rich burials in
the Vysokaya Mogila on the Dnieper
and the royal kurgan of Arzhan
in the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Repu¬
blic. All of these are dated to the
8th-7th centuries B.C., a time which
precedes the early Scythian period,
and the first two monuments are
accepted by the majority of scholars
as being pre-Scythian or Cimmerian
in culture.
Unlike them, the kurgan of Arzhan
belongs to the fully developed cul¬
ture of Scytho-Siberian type. It too,
however, belongs not to its "early
Scythian" stage, but to another,
even earlier one. In order to under¬
stand the exceptional significance
of these monuments in explaining
the origin and composition of cul¬
tures of the Scytho-Siberian type,
we need to look at the kurgan of
Arzhan in somewhat greater detail.

Nomad chieftains were often buried
with their horsesin some cases
scores of them, as in the great
8th- 7th-century B.C. tomb-complex
at Arzhan in the Sayan mountains
(Autonomous Soviet Republic of Tuva).
Opposite page: remains of Arzhan's
vast circular wooden structure,
120 metres in diameter. Left, plan of
Arzhan showing the honeycomb-like
network of its chambers. Tiny horse-
figures indicate where horses were
buriedup to 30 in each chamber.
In the central chamber the nomad
chieftain and his queen were buried
with magnificent ceremony. No less
than 6,000 trees were felled to build
the tomb and over 10,000 persons
are thought to have attended
the funeral. Below left, bronze plaque
of a coiled wild beast by a nomad
artist. Unearthed at Arzhan it is
one of the biggest of its kind
ever found.
Arzhan is a vast stone tomb, the
biggest in the Sayan Mountains
120 metres in diameter. Under its
stone mound, a unique wooden
structure of enormous dimensions
has been splendidly preserved. A
large square wooden framework,
with an area of more than 65 square
metres, is placed directly on the
ground. Seventy other such frame¬
works are arranged around it in
radial lines and circles. These toge¬
ther form a round wooden platform,
about three metres high, which were
covered by a ceiling.
Excavations of the kurgan under
my direction went on for four years.
Although the monument had been
more than once ransacked and
plundered even in very ancient times,
we discovered a large number of
objects and were able to recreate a
fairly detailed picture of the magni¬
ficent royal funeral.
Thousands of people gathered at
the place of burial in the month of
September. In seven to eight days
they felled more than 6,000 tree-
trunks and used them to build the
huge multi-chambered platform.
The central chamber contained, on
a soft litter made of horses' manes
and tails, a small framework with
double walls and a ceiling, in which
the bodies of the king and his queen
were placed in separate sarcophagi
made of hollowed logs. They were
dressed in rich clothing made of
multicoloured imported fabrics and
costly furs (sable and others).
The tomb was plundered. Vir¬
tually nothing of importance has
remained, out of what must have
been a mass of valuable ornaments:
only one small golden plaque and
pieces of golden leaves, some tur¬
quoise beads and a bead necklace,
and 20 small turquoise discs, which
were probably the inlay of massive
golden plaques depicting animals.
These plaques were stolen by thei
grave-robbers. I

On three sides around the royal
framework were placed eight hol¬
lowed logs in which were buried im¬
portant personages who accompanied
the king. All except one were old
or indeed very old, and all were dres¬
sed in rich fur or woollen clothes.
Only in some of the logs had objects
been preserved: these included orna¬
ments of gold and turquoise, bronze
arrows, a dagger and some other
items. Another five similar person¬
ages were buried in .neighbouring
chambers.
On the fourth side of the royal
framework were stacked six saddle
horses. Of their rich and magni¬
ficent harness there remain a few
ornaments from the bridle and
saddle straps, some gold and silver,
and some made of coloured stone
or boar tusks. These horses were
obviously the personal property of
the king.
One must suppose that numerous
representative groups of nomads
from all the tribes subject to the
kingthose who peopled the moun¬
tainous steppes of what is now
Tuvagathered for his funeral. They
arrived with gifts which befitted the
occasion. In seven chambers, posi¬
tioned to the east of the central one,
they buried 138 horses30 saddle
horses in each of three chambers,
15 horses in each of three other
chambers and three horses in the
last one.
The horses in each chamber all
came from the same tribe. All of
them were buried with their bridles
and saddles. All were old stallions.
There are few harness ornaments,
but there are wonderful examples of
the Scytho-Siberian animal style
artan enormous bronze figure of
a beast of prey rolled into the form of
a ring, and an ivory head of a
bridled horse.
We may also take it that delega¬
tions from neighbouring countries
took part in the royal funeral. They
placed their gifts to the deceased in
six chambers, positioned to the
north and north-east of the central
chamber. In each of these chambers
from two to ten horses were buried.
The bridle plates of each group of
horses belong to a particular type,
and differ from the harness dress of
all the other groups; the ornaments
of the bridles are also different.
There are five remarkable bronze
top-pieces (perhaps from battle stan¬
dards), with monumental figures of
mountain rams on them.
In one case, .the horses were
accompanied by two distinguished
elders, buried beside them in hol¬
lowed logs. They had come, obviously -
from some distance, in order to fol¬
low the king, who was honoured
not only in his own country, but
also beyond its borders. The par¬
ticipation of foreign representatives
in the funerals of great nomad
leaders probably occurred quite fre¬
quently in the past.
An ancient Turkic epitaph, for
example, informs us that at the
funeral of the first Turkic kagan or
leader, there gathered "weeping
and groaning people" from all the
ends of the earth, including some
from tribes and peoples not subject
to the Turks, i.e. from the coasts of
the Pacific, the Siberian taiga and
Central Asia. Even "Avars" and
"Rum", envoys from the Black Sea
steppes and from faraway Byzan¬
tium, are said to have been present.
One can judge the numbers of
participants in the funeral by the
remains of the funeral feast. Around
the kurgan of Arzhan the ruins of
small round stone enclosures stand
in a semi-circle. There are more
than 300 of them. In the ruins of
each were found the bones of a
horse, but only fragments of the
skull and bones of the lower part of
the legs.
These are evidently remains of the
sacrificial horses, placed on the site
of the funeral celebrations after
the horses' flesh had been eaten
and the funeral feast had finished.
Such a ritual was widespread among
the nomads from the most ancient
times onwards. If one horse was
eaten on the site of each enclosure,
the total number of those present
at the funeral feast must have
exceeded 10,000.
The tomb of Arzhan is clear evi¬
dence that the cultures of the so-
called early Scythian period were
preceded by cultures of an already
fully formed Scytho-Siberian type.
Some scholars may hesitate to attribute
such monuments in the Black Seat
steppes to an early stage of Scythian'
culture, but there is no doubt about
the monuments of the Sayano-Altai
region in this regard. Other monu¬
ments of this period, of a fully Scy¬
tho-Siberian type, are also known
in the Sayano-Altai region. Of
these, the most interesting by far
are the so-called deer stones.
A few deer stones were discovered
in the 19th century not far from
Arzhan. We also found a fragment
of such a stone in the Arzhan tomb
on the ceiling of one of its cham¬
bers. The deer stones have the
appearance of a round or rectan¬
gular pillar or a slab-shape,d stone,
representing a warrior with his
weapons in conventionalized form.
They range in height from half a
metre to three metres.
The lower part of the stone is
"belted" with a thong, which has a
bow, a dagger, a hatchet and other
weapons suspended from it. At the
top, where the face of the warrior
should be, there are usually three
small parallel oblique lines. On the
sides are ear-rings and lower down
a necklace or pendant. On the
smooth surface of the stone the
figures of a noble deer and some¬
times other animals are often repre¬
sented. Thus the name of deer
stone, although very often there are
Drawing shows design on the
four sides of a "deer stone" (c. 8th
century B.C.) unearthed in the
Mongolian steppe. Although named
from the figures of deer inscribed on
them, such stones are in fact stylized
portrayals of nomad warriors.
This one wears a neck-ring and
ear-rings. Weapons, including a
dagger and a hatchet, hang from
his belt and deer run slantwise round
his body. Many such stones, ranging
in height from half a metre to 3 metres,
have been found in Mongolia, the
Tuva Autonomous Republic of the
U.S.S.R. and, in a slightly different
form, in the Urals.
no representations of deer on the
stone.
Most deer stones have been found
in the steppes of Mongolia, and also
many in Tuva. They have also been
unearthed in the adjoining lands
beyond Lake Baikal and in the moun¬
tainous Altai. Further west, only
isolated examples occur as far as the
southern Urals. In the Urals, these
stone representations of a warrior
are still more conventionalthe flat
side of the stone bears representa¬
tions of only a hatchet and a dagger,
with sometimes a belt.
It is true that the steles of the
Northern Caucasus are very close
in type to deer stones, but they
represent a somewhat individual
variant of conventional warrior repre¬
sentations. Yet another variant of
such sculptures existed further to the
west. One of these has been found
in Romania, and another in Bulgaria
in the mound of the Ptichata Mogila
kurgan mentioned above.
The monumental sculpture of the
Asian and Black Sea steppes, inclu¬
ding its conventional image of the
warrior, emerged and developed at
the very beginning of the formation
of the early Scytho-Siberian nomad
culture. The consecutive stages in
the evolution of this warrior image
40

followed similar lines across the wide
expanse of the steppes. Similarly,
the Scytho-Siberian animal style,
despite all its variety, developed
uniformly across the vast territory
stretching from the Danube to the
Great Wall of China.
Monuments known to belong to
the initial period of Scythian culture
are still very few in number in the
steppes both of Asia and the Black
Sea area. It is still impossible, on
the basis of the finds in the Arzhan
tomb and some less significant monu¬
ments of the Altai, to give a full
picture of the origin and composition
of the Scytho-Siberian type cultures,
altough some important conclusions
can now be drawn.
It can no longer be said that the
Scytho-Siberian cultures formed in
the 7th century B.C. or later spread
from a single centre in different di¬
rections, including the East. Secon¬
dly, it is clear that the determining
factor in the development of the
steppe population at that time was
the transition to a new economy
based on nomadic cattle-breeding.
This stimulated the development of
new farming methods and cultural
forms.
It is difficult to be precise about
the movements and practices of par¬
ticular tribes, but it is clear that from
the 8th century B.C. onwards, similar
cultures of Scytho-Siberian type
emerged and developed simul¬
taneously. Extensive inter-tribal ex¬
changes which occurred both peace¬
fully and by means of wars and
plundering raids meant that the cul¬
tural acquisitions of one tribe became
widely distributed among the other
tribes.
The ancient tribes of the Asian
steppes were obviously creators and
constructors of cultures of Scytho-
Siberian type to as great an extent
as their contemporaries, the Scy¬
thians. It is even possible that the
contribution which Asian tribes such
as the Altaians and Tuvinians made
to the formation of Scytho-Siberian
art and culture was sometimes more
significant than that made by the
Scythians themselves.
Indeed one might well question
whether European Scythia was, as
many people have hitherto believed,
a centre or focus of the Scytho-
Siberian territory. After all, it was
situated on the far periphery of the
Scytho-Siberian territory and its
proximity to and close contacts with
Mediterranean civilization may to
some extent have repressed the
creative originality of the Scythians.
