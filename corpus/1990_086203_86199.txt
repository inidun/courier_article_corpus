After literacy what next? Many of the questions raised
in this essay written nearly half a century ago by a great
Spanish poet are still as topical as ever.
The new
illiterates
By Pedro Salinas
42
In the beginning there was Illiteracy.
Over the centuries and thanks to
God, light gradually dawned, until
today we have compulsory primary
education. Most people, including
many teachers, would agree that the
acquisition of literacy skills, or rather
the ability to read, marks a frontier
so clearly defined that ¡t divides hu¬
manity into two totally different
groups.
On one side of the divide is the
anonymous mass of unfortunate

people who are unable to penetrate
the mysteries of the printed word and
remain on the outside, for all the
world as if they were standing on the
shore of a sea across which they
could be borne to marvellous lands,
if only they had a ship to sail in. On
the other side are the legions of the
privileged, who have had the good
fortune to achieve that blessed state
in which they know for certain that
c and o make co, that c and a make
ca and, thanks to this knowledge, can
decipher the posters which proclaim
the magic words: "Coca Cola".
Yet I must confess to harbouring
serious doubts about the authenticity
of this rigorous division of humanity
into literates and illiterates and, in
particular, about using it as a yard¬
stick with which to evaluate people.
Not knowing how to read and
write is natural; all of us come into
the world that way. No one was born
educated. I mean by this that man in
the natural state, at birth, is Illiterate;
but insofar as he is able to learn to
read, he is also potentially literate.
For various reasons which I will
not go into here, society decides to
turn this potential into reality. In other
words, to transform man's innate
capacity to understand letters and
signs into mastery of the art of read¬
ing. This is achieved by means of a
complex process which begins with
a primer and ends goodness knows
where. At the end of these efforts,
referred to as primary education, the
subject is proudly declared to be
literate, a person of superior
distinctionwhich he undoubtedly is.
So far, so good. But the ability
to read is in itself only a potential
state. To know how to read is one
thing, but actually to read is another.
If the newly-literate person does not
exercise his reading skills, what is the
point of learning to read at all?
We now come to the next stage
in this analysis of the true value of
literacy. Let us assume that the poten¬
tial reader takes the next step and
actually becomes a reader. Does this
mean we can say that the objectives
of literacy have been attained? By no

century).
means, because at this stage a new
scenario unfolds. The Illiterate person
has become literate, the literate
person has become a reader, and the
reader is reading. But what and how
does that person read?
The same question arises again.
Every reader is potentially a good
reader. But will he or will he not
become one? If the answer is yes, we
can say that the aim of literacy has
been achieved: the ability to read
well, in such a way that the word
becomes spirit and texts come to life.
It is clear that the objective of
literacy is rarely fully attained. We
must recognize the existence of those
whom I call the neo-llliterates. These
are people who, although freed from
the hell of total Illiteracy, have not yet
attained the empyrean of reading,
but hover in a limbo somewhere in
between.
I am not referring to those who
cannot read because of a lack of
books or libraries. This kind of prac¬
tical problem Is relatively easy to
solve.... I am thinking rather of those
who can read but do not do so, for
more profound and complex reasons
than the fact that they do not have
a book at hand.
I would suggest that two types
of Illiterates should be recognized.
First, there are the "pure", clas¬
sic, natural illiterates who for some
reason do not know how to read.
Such people may be tragic insofar as
they have the potential to achieve ex¬
cellence but lack the mental stimulus
to realize their potential, which re¬
mains dormant for lack of knowledge
and culture. I feel respect, sympathy
and admiration for this category of
illiterates. In my country, you only
need to stroll awhile In the hills of
Castile or in the olive groves of An¬
dalusia to come across Illiterate peo¬
ple who, when you get to know
them, prove to be as humane, as dig¬
nified in their behaviour and as wise
in their judgement as many people
whose heads are stuffed with
learning.
The other type of Illiterate person
might be described as impure, coun¬
terfeit, the product of modern edu¬
cation and, unwittingly, the
embodiment of its faults. Those who
know how to read, but nevertheless
to all intents and purposes remain
illiterate, I call the neo-illlterates.
This type of "neo-llllteracy" may
be total or partial. Total neo-illlterates
are those who, after learning to read
at school, choose not to use their
reading skills except when they actu¬
ally have to read a letter, scan a
cinema or theatre programme, or

Some of them may glance at the
sports pages, thereby enjoying a form
of journalism which is particularly
meritorious since for many people it
provides the only occasion when they
read....
Many of these people are active,
practical andto borrow a fashion¬
able modern term which associates
the mysteries of Greek with those of

There is also a species of partial
neo-illiterates whose members may
be seen hovering round newspaper
kiosks like bees buzzing round a mag¬
nificent flower, in search of ingre¬
dients with which to make the honey
of their intellectual lives. They never
read books but they are fascinated by
the proliferation of magazines and
the topics they cover. They deserve
sympathy because far from sparing
their efforts as readers, they are prod¬
igal with them. They read voraciously,
poor things, returning home laden
with magazines which they plough
through for hours on end, without
getting much more out of them than
a child playing with a jigsaw puzzle
that he never manages to finish,
never seeing the overall picture in
which everything falls into its rightful
place....
This kind of reader arouses our
compassion. The more he reads, the
further he drifts in this boundless sea
of print, the level of which rises a few
metres every week. The reader of a
book knows where his task begins
and ends; he can relax, take a holi¬
day. A magazine reader, especially if
he is a subscriber, feels pursued as if
by the Furies by these terrible weekly,
bi-weekly or monthly creatures. If
he flags, he will drown in a rising
tide of newsprint. To keep abreast
of the material that pours from the
presses, the reader must make a
titanic effort. A hundred writers
penning articles for a score of maga¬
zines snap at his heels like a pack of
tireless hounds which allow their
quarry no respite....
Several conclusions can be
drawn from this necessarily incom¬
plete portrait gallery of neo-illiteracy.
Firstly, it should never be forgotten
that the word "read" is ambiguous
and so, consequently, are such ex¬
pressions as "learn to read" and
"know how to read". These are com¬
plex expressions which should not be
taken in their most literal, superficial
sense as simply describing the capac¬
ity to understand the most obvious
meaning of the written word. There
is no doubt that the possession of this
simple technique wrests man from his
natural illiteracy and opens up vast
perspectives. But if this aptitude for
expanding the potential of the soul,
for spiritual fulfilment, is not used, he
will find himself in a situation which

sounds paradoxical yet is nonetheless
very realthat of an illiterate who
knows how to read. He has been
wrested from pure illiteracy, yet
through disuse or neglect of the
faculty of reading a regressive
mechanism begins to operate which,
sooner or later, will take him back to
his point of departure, or worse-
spiritual illiteracy....
Although this is the harsh truth,
statistics and social convention up¬
hold the fiction that such people
should be counted as literate, and
that they belong to the privileged
group of those who know how to
read. In this, as in much else, the
world does not scruple to accept a
half-truth which it welcomes with
the jubilation which ought to be
accorded to the whole truth, at the
same time feeling vaguely that every¬
one is at once victim and perpetrator
of a confidence trick.
This new group is slowly growing,
and the time has come to name and
confer a status on its members. They
are the neo-illiterates and they are far
more threatening and dangerous
than the pure Illiterates. They do not
lurk In the shadows of ignorance with
the devil nor do they aspire to the
light of divine knowledge. They are
capable of everything yet venture
nothing....
There is a further consequence
of their increasing numbers: we must
abandon our idolatrous and hypnotic

attitude towards the so-called
"problem of illiteracy". Modern
educational policy has a fetish, a
blood-stained deity to which every¬
thing is sacrificed though it guaran¬
tees nothing to its most fervent
worshippers: the struggle against
illiteracy. This phrase, repeated over
and over again in newspapers, maga¬
zines and political rhetoric, strikes
awe into people's hearts....
Some of my readers may feel
indignant at this heretic who has the
temerity to harbour doubts about the
struggle against illiteracy. Yet, if my
argument is, or at least may be, well-
founded, namely that teaching peo¬
ple to read Is not enough, in most
cases, to wrest them from their origi¬
nal spiritual povertyor, as T.S. Eliot
put it, that "only in a very limited
sense can it be said that education
produces culture"it will perhaps be
understood that what I am attempt¬
ing to do is to give to this phrase, this
slogan, this endeavour"the strug¬
gle against illiteracy"a new vigour.
I do not wish to minimize the
tragedy of illiteracy; on the contrary,
I believe that we are faced by two
powerful enemies. One is the long-
familiar, immediately recognizable
enemy on whom our educational big.

guns are trained; but beside It is
another figure disguised behind the
mask of literacy, deceiving us, making
us believe that it is not a problem,
that it is one of us, one of the workers
in the city of the mind, when in reality
it is the fifth column of total illiteracy,
the sworn enemy, through inert
opposition, of the word become
spirit.
It is of course praiseworthy that
thousands upon thousands of chil¬
dren are today snatched from the
jaws of illiteracy by primary educa¬
tion. But these innocents, newly
saved from the darkness of illiteracy,
from the dragon of native ignorance,
must be closely watched. A terrible
surprise lies in wait. These infants
start out in life armed only with basic
reading and writing skills, confident
in the belief that they have already
conquered their native ignorance,
only to encounter a much more for¬
midable adversary around the next
corner.
This new Circe lures them to her
and turns them into lesser beings,
neo-illlterates who will live content¬
edly in the snug confines of unaware-
ness, with all the material advantages
of the modern world yet sentenced
for life to another form of
ignorancesurfeited, not with the
acorns of Homer's noble oak, but
with the synthetic sustenance that is
the ultimate miracle of progress.
