August Strindberg (1849-1912) Swedish dramatist
and novelist was one of the strangest figures
in all. literary history, and there are few more
painful stories than his. No brief space can do
justice to him. Strindberg was never at peace with
himself and on several occasions was almost
completely mad. His books, filled with violence,
bitterness and sadness, are magnificently written
and have a brutal beauty. His Master Olaf revealed
him as a dramatist of the highest rank and a master
of the Swedish language, and he is today considered
"without doubt the greatest dramatic artist that the
Swedes have produced, perhaps the greatest literary
genius that has come out of Sweden." When he
died, 30,000 people came to his funeral. To relax
from his interior torment, Strindberg seriously took
up painting. On the Baltic coast near Stockholm
he made numerous sketches and gathered inform¬
ation about the fishermen's life in the Swedish
archipelago. He has left many richly coloured
impressionistic paintings, such as the Evening
Breeze at the Sea, above, now in the Nordiska
Museum, Stockholm.
