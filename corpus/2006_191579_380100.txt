The Courier looks back
since it began publication, the unesco courier  
has devoted articles and issues to various aspects of sport. 
here is a glimpse at some of them:
Issues
the competitive world of sport
December 1992 
Sport has become synonymous with top-flight 
competition, rather than a form of play and a means 
of education. This competition has resulted from 
excessive concentration on a limited number 
of spectacular events, a process which has in turn 
exposed sport to ever-greater attention 
from business and the media. 
people at play 
may 1991 
The amount of importance attached to spontaneous 
play can tell us much about the basic features 
of a culture. In industralized societies, games 
and sports are often at the mercy of the profit motive, 
but other societies have been more successful 
at preserving the innocence of play. 
fair play and the amateur in sport 
January 1964  
Baron Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympic 
Games in modern times. A hundred years after 
his birth in 1863, this issue assesses his crusade 
to dignify and invigorate sport, to make it 
independent and adapt it for its educational role 
in today’s world.
Articles
Tim Crabbe, who lectures in sport sociology 
at Britain’s Sheffield Hallam University, presents 
two articles on the problem of racism in European 
football matches.
“garlic, knives and banners: 
football’s racist faces” 
november 2000 
“a tricolour triumph?” 
november 2000 
“the spell of sport” 
april 1999
This dossier offers two roles of sport: as an escape 
route from discrimination for women, the disabled, 
ethnic minorities and the poor and as an outlet 
and crucible for national, religious 
and intercommunity conflicts.
