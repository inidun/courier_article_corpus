{f|"^HE Lord must have worked
overtime to create such a
beautiful island," say the
Puerto Ricans. Indeed, all its
3.5 million inhabitants seem
to be passionately attached
to this tiny (8,897 sq km) island,
formed by volcanic eruptions more
than 120 million years ago.
Puerto Rico is the smallest and
the most easterly of the islands
that comprise the Greater Antilles,
lying about 100 kilometres east of
the Dominican Republic. It was
discovered by Christopher
Columbus in 1493 and remained a
Spanish possession until 1898,
when, following the Treaty of Paris
which ended the brief Spanish
American War, it became a com¬
monwealth associated with the
United States. Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens with a special status.
They are exempt from federal
income taxes, and their official
language is Spanish.
Puerto Rico began to industrial¬
ize its historically agricultural eco¬
nomy just fifty years ago with a
programme called "Bootstrap",
Fomento in Spanish, which was
launched to enable the Puerto
Ricans to take their destiny into
their own hands. Pharmaceutical
products and the production of
electronic and scientific instru¬
ments are major components of
the economy. However, there is an
unemployment rate of 16 per cent.
More than half the families are on
U.S. food stamps, and 2.5 million
Puerto Ricans seek jobs and cash
on the U.S. mainland.
A passenger on a plane coming
in to land at San Juan airport sees
Puerto Rico as a green rectangle in
a turquoise-blue sea, a paradise of
white beaches lined with coconut
trees. However, Puerto Rico is a
paradise not only for tourists but
for archaeologists, botanists, and
ornithologists as well. The first
28
archaeological excavations reveal¬
ed traces of Indian groups from
northeastern South America
dating from the beginning of the
Christian era pottery, small clay
masks, and rock-carvings. The
natural environment also offers
fascinating research material,
including more than 3,000 plant
species, 232 kinds of birds, and
numerous reptiles and amphi¬
bians. Many of these plants and
animals are endemic to the island,
and some are found nowhere else
in the world.
On 24 December 1968, the
Governor of Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior, and the
Administrator of the Economic
Development Administration
decided to take action to preserve
the island's endangered treasures.
They created a Conservation
Trust, to be endowed through
contributions from petroleum
companies operating on the island
and through private, U.S. tax-
deductible charitable donations.
It was not a moment too soon.
The San Cristóbal Canyon, which

Reserve at

Rico).
cuts through the heart of the
island's central mountain range
like the stroke of a sword, was
being used as a waste dump by
neighbouring towns piling up
debris and car wrecks. Dump fires
were a regular occurrence. In
1974, the Trust bought nearly 500
hectares along the northern rim
of the Canyon and gradually
cleaned it up, restoring it to the
red-tailed hawk and other wild¬
life. The Trust now plans to pur¬
chase adjacent tracts of land
along the southern rim and to
clear and mark out a system of
trails to enable visitors to discover
and learn about the site's envi¬
ronment and its wild inhabitants.
Punta Ballena, in the southwest
of the island, was threatened not
by waste but by development as a
tourist site. The setting, a forest of
mangroves and coves bordering
the Guánica State coastal dry
forest, represents such a unique
and beautiful ecosystem that, in
1985, Unesco decided to declare it
a Biosphere Reserve. After pur¬
chase from the Club Méditerranée
tourist organization of the eighty
hectares of forest, the Trust turned
this site into a protected habitat
for endangered species such as the
crested toad, the Puerto Rican
night-jar, the yellow-shouldered
blackbird, the manatee, and the
hawksbill turtle.
Further along the coast, to the
west, the threat to the Bahia
Fosforescente (Phosphorescent
Bay) of La Parguera came not only
from tourism, but also from hous¬
ing development. On dark nights,
bio-luminescent micro-orga¬
nisms, Pyrodinium bahamensis,
transform the bay into a sea of fire.
Because of the central hills and
mountains of the island, the popu¬
lation tends to press into a narrow
plain along the coastline. Had the
Trust not acquired it, the Las
Cabezas de San luán Nature
Reserve would also be a parking
area today.
Another 150-hectare site, in the
southwest of the island, was saved
by the Trust from the clutches of
speculative developers to become
the Inés María Mendoza de
Muñoz Marín Reserve. This land¬
scape of pastures and tree-lined
sandstone cliffs is home to the
grasshopper sparrow, the Puerto
Rican bullfinch, the black-whisker¬
ed vireo, and the American kestrel.
In the eastern part of the island
is another feature of great ecologi¬
cal importance, the Pterocarpus
Forest. Its trees, also called "coral
wood" because of their red sap,
have wide roots which reach down
into the marshy soil. In 1990, the
Trust purchased a 350-hectare
stretch of this forest, which is now
under its protection.
Although industrialized, densely
populated and urbanized, Puerto
Rico gives the impression of being
an oasis, with limited pollution.
The air is always clean thanks to
the trade winds, and environmen¬
tal conservation has become a
major concern. The Conservation
Trust is well-managed and effec¬
tive. The island could very well be
a model to other regions of the
world.
