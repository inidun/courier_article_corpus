With a dose of humour, the successful Catalan author 
discusses such serious topics as society, politics, his craft—and
why he writes detective novels
Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
n Did you know there are over 200
entries for Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
on the search engines of the Internet? 
Manuel Vázquez Montalbán: I only knew of
t wo pages on the Intern e t . One of them
made me out to be an Italian and the other
an A m e rican of Galician extraction called
C o l m e i r o. I know both pages exist, but I
h ave n ’t looked any further into them. I had
the Internet installed not long ago and
I’m not yet an expert brow s e r , far from it.
n Why is it that a man like you, who
writes poetry, essays and opinion
columns and has always kept up with
international events with so critical an
eye, should suddenly start writing
detective novels?
M . V. M . : The fact is that the whole of
l i t e r at u r e , absolutely all of it, is divided into
d e t e c t i ve novels and romantic nove l s.
Quote me any title from any of the wo r l d ’s
l i t e r ature and you will find that the subject
m atter either deals with an inve s t i g ation into
the violation of a taboo, in short a cri m e ,
or else is a love story.
Detective novels,as originally invented,
with a fixed imagi n at i ve wo r l d , are a ve ry
run-of-the-mill and predictable genre.
However,the modern detective novel of the
past thirty or forty ye a rs shouldn’t be properly
d e s c ribed as such. T h e y ’re novels like any
o t h e rs in which, b a s i c a l l y, an inve s t i g ation is
conducted into the meaning of a social cri m e .
As for how the subject is handled, in my
opinion there’s no difference compared with
a novel that ’s not in the “ d e t e c t i ve ”c at e g o ry.
I regard John Le Carré and Graham Greene
as being as ambitious in their literary aims
as V i r ginia Wo o l f. I know that sounds heretical
but I firmly believe it.W h at interests me is that
it’s possible to start out from a set character
and turn the story almost into a saga about
the evolution of a society.
n How do you explain the success of
Carvalho, the private detective who is
the main character in your novels?
M . V. M . : I think he’s an intern at i o n a l
success for one reason: h e ’s been a mirr o r
not only of the transition that ’s taken place
in Spain but transition in a broader sense.
H e ’s a man who recreates the at m o s p h e r e
of the 1960s, a time which held out gr e at
hopes of ecological change and saw the
a rri val of hippies, the birth control pill,
freedom in eve ry form and gentle, l y ri c a l
r e vo l u t i o n s.T h e r e ’s also a kind of fin - d e - s i è c l e
d e s p a i r , in which people are scared of losing
their jobs and catching Aids and afraid of
f r e e d o m , a fear that the Pope in Rome and
the manipulat o rs of labour markets, a m o n g
o t h e rs ,h ave succeeded in instilling in them
through a sort of repressive mechanism.
C a rvalho has mirrored all these things in
the novels and that ’s why I think that what
he has to say can be heard in so many
p l a c e s.
n Why does cooking occupy so 
important a place in your books,
to the extent that it is almost like
a character?
M . V. M . : In the first place, i t ’s because the
only thing I can do, a p a rt from wri t e , is cook.
S e c o n d , because it is a necessary
i n gr e d i e n t , especially in the Carva l h o
s eri e s ; cooking is hardly ever mentioned in
my other nove l s.A set character has to have
t wo or three recognizable quirks. T h e r e
i s n ’t a single character who doesn’t have them.
E ve rybody who reads Georges Simenon ’s
M a i gret novels knows he’s waiting for the
f i rst seasonal dishes, the first spring peas
in the b ra s s e ri e, no matter how they’r e
p r e p a r e d , and draught beer the way they
only serve it in a particular bar.R e a d e rs wa i t
for that to happen; they wait for Sherlock
Holmes to play the violin or start sniffing.
I gave Carvalho one or two of those traits
and I’ve had to respect them from one
n ovel to the next.
I believe , m o r e ove r , t h at cooking is
also a metaphor for one’s own culture.
I ’ ve sometimes stressed this. Cooking is the
d e ath mask. In order to eat we have to
k i l l , whether it be a head of lettuce or an
a n i m a l . If the act is a direct one, in other
words if you kill and then eat , it is an act
of barbari s m . On the other hand, if you kill,
cook and then eat , the cultural aspect
a p p e a rs ; this invo l ves applying to the act
of killing a skill or technology that adds
dignity and turns it into culture.
n What about book-burning, your hero’s
other quirk?
M.V. M.: On several occasions Carvalho says
he bu rns books because literature has not
taught him how to live .T h at ’s a meaningless
e x a g g e r at i o n , but it’s a ritual the character
has to perform.
n In literary terms, is Carvalho ever going
to die?

Montalbán:
  act of free choice”
M . V. M . : This poses a serious credibility
problem for me. C a rvalho is a man I
o ri ginally shut myself up with and I
reckoned on giving him more or less a
c e rtain age, but I kept on forgetting.
H owe ve r , the character’s psychologi c a l
d e velopment corresponds to his phy s i c a l
d e ve l o p m e n t , and that makes it ve ry hard
for Carvalho to surv i ve as a pri vat e
d e t e c t i ve because aggr e s s i ve n e s s ,p hy s i c a l
strength and a whole gamut of fa c i a l
expressions are invo l ve d , and frankly he
cannot afford such luxuri e s. So in the
millennium nove l , which I hope will come
out in the year 2000, either I can pension
him off and get r id of him after he’s
r e t u rned to the world with Biscuter (a
f o rmer convict who is the detective ’s
a s s i s t a n t ) , or I can turn him into something
e l s e .
I once thought of turning Carvalho into
a spy, w h at might be called a post-modern spy
working for new powers that never had any
spies before, like autonomous regi o n a l
authorities, or a municipal, environmental,
industrial or ethnic spy.That sort of thing is
going to be big business in the future.In the
p r e s e n t - d ay division of conflicts in the wo r l d ,
as essayists like Alvin Toffler and Hans
Magnus Enzensberger have actually
p r e d i c t e d ,i n f o rm ation services will be needed
in the new climate of conflict that is liable to
t rigger future civil wa rs. So why not turn
Carvalho into a spy for the Generalitat,the
p r ovincial gove rnment of Cat a l o n i a , with all
the ove rtones of irony and symbolism of
setting that could imply? I’m thinking about
it as a possibility, but I don’t know yet whether
I shall go ahead or not.
n How do you go about creating your
books?
M. V. M.: I use a very conventional system in
which I accumulate facts and ideas.The poet
T. S . Eliot describes this creat i ve process ve ry
c l e a r l y. One stage consists of gat h e ring the
m at e ri a l s , whether consciously or
unconsciously. Sometimes you accumulate
things you initially don’t think will end up
as a book, a novel or a poem. Even so, you
keep on building them up as a reserve , a sort
of storehouse.When these mat e rials are dense
e n o u g h , they look for a way out. I t ’s rather like
the moraine of a glacier which goes on piling
up debris until the time comes for it to seek
an outlet, when a current emerges.T h at ’s
how I see the creative process.
n In your writing, how do you manage to
identify with places like Argentina or
Bangkok so closely it’s as though you
had lived there?
M . V. M . : F i rs t , t h e r e ’s the inform at i o n -
g at h e ring process I just mentioned. T h e n
there’s the fact that people’s ideological and
emotional patterns are coming increasingly
to resemble each other because we consume
the same food and the same cultural and
media products. Our living pat t e rns and
production relations are becoming more and
more alike.That means we can understand
much more about how we ourselves behave
and how other people behave.
A ristotle is supposed to have said “ yo u
are what you eat.” It’s a fact that,in cultural
terms,all of us eat virtually the same things.
The closest we can come to living in a
Barcelona suburb and watching television is
living in a Bangkok suburb and wat c h i n g
television, because all of us watch the same
American programmes in any case.
n Is that why Barcelona is almost like
another character in most of your
novels?
M .V. M . : Ye s. Barcelona is a port and a city of
t r a n s i t .I t ’s also a place where many memori e s
exist side-by-side.All that makes it a multi-
faceted city in eve ry sense. Such cities tend to
be very interesting from the literary point of
view. Many cities have literary associations
and others do not. A considerable amount
of writing has been devoted to Barcelona, a s
it has to Buenos Aires and many other cities.
In the United Stat e s , for example, a whole
imaginary world has been created by books
and films on San Francisco and New Yo r k , ye t
that hardly exists in the case of  Washington.
n What does Barcelona mean to you
personally?
M.V. M.: It’s my homeland,in the true sense
of the word. It is the place where you were
b o rn ,where your refle xes were shaped,w h e r e
you learnt that other people exist and how
much they are threatening or well-disposed
towards you.It’s the place where you learnt
codes of conduct—all kinds, not only hav i n g
to do with language—and where you also
l e a rnt to pick up a system of signals that make
you feel you belong to that particular parcel
of territory more than to any other.
As you rationalize all this, you come to
a gree with Saint-Exupéry that yo u ’re from the
c o u n t ry of your childhood, since childhood
is a piece of physical and emotional terri t o ry.
T h at ’s what Barcelona means to me.
More specific a l l y, I ’d say I’m not so much
from Barcelona as from a part i c u l a r
neighbourhood of the city.T h at ’s what marks
you in the first place,although then you tr y
to generalize and absorb other cultural
f e atures and pat t e rn s.T h at ’s what Barcelona
basically represents for me. M o r e ove r ,
because of its layout and history, i t ’s not just
one conventional city but a dive rsity of cities
because it’s an amalgam of different
a r c h a e o l o gical peri o d s. T h e y ’re not only
monumental,such as the Romanesque city,
the Gothic city, the neo-classical city, the city
of m o d e rn i s m o and of Gaudí, but represent
different periods of archaeology as they relat e
to human beings. Barcelona is a city that
attracted va rious migr at o ry movements which
g ave rise to the incorp o r ation of new strands
and to a degree of cross-fert i l i z ation follow i n g
the clash with the culture that came before.
M o r e ove r , Barcelona was largely shaped
at the end of the last century by the influx of
C atalans from the country s i d e ,wo r k i n g - c l a s s
people who flocked there to join the industri a l
r e vo l u t i o n .H e n c e , it was a gat h e ring-place for
people from the grassroots all over the
country.
n You’ve always had a sense of political
commitment. Do you think writers are
bound to be militants?
M.V. M.: Absolutely.Writing is an act of free
c h o i c e . Some wri t e rs need to get invo l ved in
social and political issues and others do not.
All we ask of a writer is that he or she should
w rite we l l . I subscribe to the theory, which is
in fact quite widespread,that there is always
something ideological in what all wri t e rs have
to offer, although they may seem to be

A n o n - s t o p n o v e l i s t
Li ke his hero, the detective Pe p e
C a r va l h o,Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
(born Barcelona, 1939) looks upon
himself as taking a walk through history.
Considering his wide-ranging and varied
l i t e rary output, a journalist was not
entirely wrong when he jokingly said,
“With Vázquez Montalbán, no sooner
have you finished reviewing his last novel
than the next one is already in the
b o o k s h o p s.” Montalbán readily admits
that he is a workaholic and that he has
written more than he has lived.“One day
I shall have to stop writing in order to
remember how to live,” he once told an
interviewer.
His style, with its peculiar mix of
c r i t i c i s m , humour and ingenuity, is an
outstanding feature of his writing.Such
books as Crónica sentimental de España
( “A Sentimental Chronicle of Spain”), M i s
almuerzos con gente inquietante ( “ M y
Lunches with Disturbing Pe o p l e ” ) , E l
escriba sentado ( “ The Seated Scribe”),
M a n i fiesto subnormal ( “ The Sub-normal
Manifesto”) or Un polaco en la Corte del
Rey Juan Carlos (“A Pole at the Court of
King Juan Carlos”) reflect his penetra t i n g
vision of present-day reality.
A novelist, essayist and poet, V á z q u e z
Montalbán has never stopped working as
a journalist.In his weekly column in Spain’s
newspaper El País, as well as in Italy’s L a
Repubblica and France’s Le Monde
D i p l o m a t i q u e, he comments on the world
scene by analysing the political and social
situation or everyday events.
The sequence of novels featuring
Carvalho began in 1972 with Yo Mate a
K e n n e d y (“I Killed Ke n n e d y ” ) , w h i c h
brought the author international success.
The Galician detective, “a former CIA
a g e n t ,a former member of the Communist
Pa r t y, a capricious, self-taught and life-
enhancing figure, prone to violence in
many of his attitudes and reactions”, h a s
over 25 years of fictional life behind him
and commands the allegiance of a host of
fans who have set up clubs and e-mail
discussion groups and even opened bars
named after him.The hero of over twenty
n o v e l s, i n c l u d i n g Southern Seas ( w h i c h
won Spain’s prestigious Planeta Prize in
1979 and the Prix International de
Littérature Policière in 1981), La Soledad
del Manager (The Angst-Ridden
Executive), La Rosa de Alejandría (“The
Rose of A l e x a n d r i a ” ) , El Premio ( “ Th e
Prize”) and Quinteto de Buenos Aires
(“Buenos Aires Quintet”), C a r valho has
made several more or less successful
f o rays into fil m , television and even comic
strips.
Vázquez Montalbán has also written
semi-fictional books based on historical
f i g u r e s, including the prize-winning
Autbiografía del General Franco
( “A u t o b i o g raphy of General Fra n c o ” ) ,
Pasionaria y los siete enanitos ( “ L a
Pasionaria and the Seven Dwarfs”),and
his latest work, O César o nada (“Caesar
or Nothing”), which is set in the Rome of
the Borgias.
His poetic works include Liquidación de
restos de serie (“Sales of Last Season’s
C l o t h e s ” ) , Movimientos sin éxito
(“Unsuccessful Movements”), Coplas a la
muerte de mi tía Daniela ( “ Verses on the
Death of My Aunt Daniela”), A la sombra
de las muchachas en flor (“Within a
Budding Grove”), Praga ( “ P ra g u e ” ) a n d
Pero el viajero que huye (“But the Tra v e l l e r
Who Flees”).
A fine gourmet, a magnificent cook
and a fan of football, which he regards
as a “secular religion”, V á z q u e z
Montalbán has always upheld the
ideological tenets of the left, which is why
he spent time in Fra n c o ’s prisons when
he was a young man.
A writer who describes himself as
“Spanish-Catalan and perhaps European or
E u ra f r i c a n ” , in 1995 he was awarded the
National Prize of Spanish Letters for his
body of work.He is a graduate in philosophy
and litera t u r e, and the Universidad
Autónoma de Barcelona conferred an
h o n o rary docto rate on him in 1997.
Modest and unassuming,he is known to
his colleagues and friends simply as
Manolo. n
completely impervious to that sort of thing.
They can always be read in terms of ideology,
of taking a stand in the eyes of the world and
in our own eye s.Yet we must respect the free
choice writers make,the fact that they want
to feel they’re in touch with real-life causes
and with their inner selves.
n You recently went to Cuba and reported
on the visit of Pope John Paul II. Was
that your decision or the idea of the
editors of El País, the newspaper you
write for?
M .V. M . : I went to Cuba to collect mat e rial for
my next book and when the newspaper found
out I was going there they asked me to write
some art i c l e s. E ve rything you see before yo u
comes from Cuba—all the folders , t h e
d o c u m e n t s , the books—eve rything on the
tables has to do with Cuba,because I’m in full
c r e at i ve gear. T h at ’s why it looks like a
battlefield.
n What was the significance of that visit,
as you see it?
M .V. M . : I feel that the Po p e ’s visit to Cuba wa s
f u n d a m e n t a l , because it’s astonishing that ,
at the end of the twentieth century, no lesser
a personage than the Pope should purp o rt
to be the saviour of a Marxist revo l u t i o n . I see
it as something midway between a cari c at u r e
and a miracle.
n What do you think the future holds in
store for Europe? What role can a
united Europe play in a globalized
world?
M. V. M.: I think that whatever idea one may
have of Europe,it cannot be separated from
the idea of globalization.When the idea of a
united Europe was put forwa r d , people we r e
thinking more in terms of power blocs.T h e y
thought Europe could be a third way.T h e
first instinct was to prevent the recurr e n c e
of conflicting interests that had arisen in the
s t ruggle for the European market, which had
t riggered two world wa rs.T h at gave rise to the
image of Europe as a bloc which could
compete with the A m e rican and Asian blocs.
N ow we ’re faced with the broader issue of
g l o b a l i z at i o n . I think the idea of a united
Europe is still attractive because it includes
one distinctive feature:the fact that Europe
has a cultural substratum that ’s different from
all other possible blocs. This cultural
s u b s t r atum still weighs heavily in all the
s t ruggles for emancipat i o n , equality and
freedom that have formed part of the history
of Europe. A European interp r e t ation of the
g l o b a l i z ation of capital is bound to differ from
t h at of a culture like that of the United Stat e s ,
where policy is geared to achieving results or
to making the system run more efficiently.
On the other hand, in European policy,
e ve rything depends on the people conducting
i t . E ven so, t h e r e ’s still a backgr o u n d , a
substratum that remembers the struggle for
e m a n c i p ation and social gains. T h i s
i n t e rp r e t ation differs from that of capitalistic
development.That’s how I see things.
n What if things don’t turn out like that?
M .V.M . : If things we r e n ’t like that , I think I’d
lose interest in the whole project.But if the
Europe taking shape were to have a domestic
and foreign policy and a more committed
p o l i cy towards North-South relat i o n s , i t
would be the kind of Europe I could take an
interest in. On the other hand, if it’s going to
be just another bloc adopting the same policy
as other blocs,there would obviously be no
other course than to accept it as it is, but in
t h at case I wo u l d n ’t be interested in it. I
b e l i e ve the aim and purpose of a united
Europe will largely depend on the relat i o n s h i p
between the forces existing within it. If the
hard-line neo-liberal sectors of unbri d l e d
capitalism end up imposing their will,E u r o p e
will become an uncontrolled capitalist bloc.
n How do you feel about the new
electronic communication media? Do
you think audio-visual culture will
replace the culture of writing?
M .V. M . : Until now,e ve ry innovation that has
appeared in the media has led to arguments
over whether it was going to spell the demise
of books. All the gloomiest predictions have
been off the mark.Each medium has had its
own terri t o ry and its own basic function.
Perhaps it will be easier for the yo u n g e r
g e n e r at i o n s , who are already used to

c o m p u t e rs as working tools. But I don’t think
it’ll ever be possible to read a literary text on
a computer screen. It may be possible to
c r e ate new forms of literary expression via
the screen, but they wo n ’t have the nove l ’s
substance,time-span or length. New forms
t h at are somehow connected with computers
m ay well emerge, but I think that the
traditional forms are very closely bound up
with the formal shape of books, with the
o p e r ation that makes it possible to re-read
them and go back and forth in them, a n d
with the tactile sensation of the object, t h e
vehicle of literature epitomized by books.
n You’ve received an honorary doctorate
from the Universidad Autónoma de
Barcelona. What did that mean to you?
M .V. M . : It wa s n ’t a gr e at symbolic ceremony,
since nobody wore gowns or that sort of thing.
It was just as my Italian publisher described
it when she said it was like a “ h a p p e n i n g ”
from May 1968. E ve rybody was ve ry relaxe d
and inform a l . I hardly noticed the ritual side,
but obviously I was deeply move d . In a sense,
the work I published on the history of
communication had borne fruit.
I have ve ry special memories of that
u n i ve rs i t y. When I was in prison I wrote a
book entitled I n fo rme sobre la info rm a c i ó n
( R e p o rt on Info rm at i o n ), which I published
in 1963.All the material I used came from
UN E S C O, since that was the only source I wa s
a l l owed to read in pri s o n .T h at ’s why my book
is so much like the MacBride Report ,
although if I may say so myself my work was
published firs t , since I based it on UN E S C O’s
r e p o rts on the inequality of newspri n t
distribution,the unequal distribution of the
main news agencies,and so on.In Spain the
book was like the one-eyed man in the land
of the blind, although I wrote it when I was
t we n t y - t wo using mat e rials that were far from
a d e q u at e . At a time when access to all the
literature on communication was restricted
by the Franco regime or by the social doctri n e
of the Church, which wa s n ’t much better,
the book was a sort of healing balm. It was
used in secret by journalism schools and
scholars.
I strengthened this link with the unive rs i t y
by later becoming a lecturer in
c o m m u n i c at i o n , conducting a number of
s e m i n a rs and publishing some books.All that
f o rms part of my life’s substrat a , and my
admission to the university implies that this
aspect of my work has been recognized.
n Do you think young people can look to
the twenty-first century with hope?
M . V. M . : One should never gi ve advice to
a ny b o d y, or messages of hope for that
m at t e r. If we look at things in a fa i r l y
cynical light, in the best sense of the wo r d ,
young people are going to need hope,
although that implies self-deception. I f
you do not have a modicum of hope or
confidence in the future, e ven though yo u
h ave to deceive yo u rs e l f, you would reach
such a pitch of lucidity that the most
advisable course would be to commit
individual and collective suicide.To have
hope you have to have a certain capacity
for self-deception—or such extraordinary
faith in your future plans, whether they have
to do with religi o n ,l ove , society or ideology,
t h at you overcome eve rything in your pat h .
T h at ’s not easy in this day and age because
i t ’s ve ry hard to believe in gr e at professions
of faith after seeing what ’s happened in
h i s t o ry. As a result, we must come to the
conclusion that hope is necessary for
p u rsuing the mechanical game of existence.
W h at we do have to abide by, w h at I conve y
in eve rything I wri t e , is the fact that we ’r e
standing at a rather ominous point in time
as far as culture is concern e d . W h at the
dominant culture is now instilling in us
a b ove all is that historical knowledge and the
search for the past are pointless, and that
i m a gining utopias and thinking that things
could be different are likewise pointless.
By trying to analyse why these two
cultural trends should have cropped up at
the same time, we find that they dove t a i l
perfectly and make you attentive only to the
p r e s e n t .You never pass judgment on the
spectacle of social or economic disorder,n o r
do you seek to find out where that disorder
o ri gi n at e s. Since they’ve depri ved you of the
right to find out who in the past is to be
blamed for the present, h i s t o ry is also left
without anybody to blame. T h at ’s what
interests them.
S e c o n d ,when you say we should organize
things differently, they tell you yo u ’re a
dangerous utopian and don’t realize where
the utopian dreams of the twentieth century
h ave led us, t h at nothing forces you to accept
w h at they’re offering yo u , whether it be order,
the labour market, N o rth-South relations or
r e l ations between the centre and the
p e ri p h e ry. If you say things can be done
d i f f e r e n t l y, i t ’s almost as if yo u ’re branded
with the stigma of post-revo l u t i o n a ry
nostalgia.
So if you’re to believe in the future, first
you have to think of retrieving the past and of
k n owing the causes behind the life yo u ’r e
n ow leading, and to exercise the right to
change what you fin d ,which is inherent in any
new venture. n

Barcelona is like a character in Montalbán’s novels.
