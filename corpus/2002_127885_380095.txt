On
September 13,
UNESCO signed
an agreement
to conduct a joint campaign 
for peace, understanding and
cultural diversity with the
International Youth Hostels
Federation, which has some
3.2 million members. The
Federation is one of a network
of about 60 major youth
organizations working in
partnership with UNESCO’s
Youth Coordination Unit*: they
include national, regional and
international federations;
student, professional, religious,
and rural associations; as well
as “heavyweights,” such as the
Red Cross and Red Crescent
societies; Christian youth groups
such as the YMCA and the
YWCA. Together they have
hundreds of millions of
members, all potential bearers 
of UNESCO’s message and news
of its work.
The Thai Youth Hostels
Association (TYHA) for
example, has joined in the 2002-
03 World AIDS Campaign,
whose youth activities are
coordinated by UNESCO. As
every year, people thronged the
streets of Thailand’s towns and
cities to celebrate the Queen’s
birthday on August 12, which,
for the last three years, has also
been World Youth Day. On this
occasion, TYHA members
marched through the streets on
Bangkok and handed out
information leaflets to passers
by. “We organized two marches
and I think at least 40,000
people got our message,” said
Promvit Klampaiboon, assistant
director of the Association and a
regional official of the Asia-
Pacific youth hostel movement.

In Bangladesh on the same day,
dozens of youth association
leaders attended a conference on
the role of young people in
HIV/AIDS prevention planning,
held with the participation of
the country’s education and
youth ministers. In Nigeria, the
Aba-based NGO Eziukwu 2
Community Partners for Health
provided prevention training to
150 young people who will in
turn train others. In the
Democratic Republic of Congo,
TOMISA, an information and
help centre for young people,
has launched a counselling
service to encourage people to
get tested for the disease.
Young people aged between
15 and 24 account for about half
of all new HIV infections – or
about 6,500 new infections
every day. Ignorance and
prejudice concerning the disease
are serious obstacles to
treatment and prevention, which
is why information is so vital.
The website of UNESCO’s
Youth Coordination Unit*
provides access to practical
proposals for action based on a
cultural approach and respectful
of human rights in fighting the
disease. The site also serves as a
permanent clearing-house for
organizations belonging to the
Youth Network and frequent and
brief messages, “infopills”, keep
them abreast of the latest
developments.
UNESCO’s ties with youth
organizations are not new. In
1993, it signed a cooperation
agreement with the International
Student Travel Confederation
(ISTC), which issues an
International Student Identity
Card recognized by more than
100 countries. Since then,
UNESCO’s logo has featured on
the card, held by some
4.5 million students worldwide.
Working with another major
NGO, UNESCO Director-General
Koïchiro Matsuura will open
the Global Development Village
at the World Scout Movement
annual Jamboree in Thailand
on December 28.
