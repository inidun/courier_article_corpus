‘Txilek elli yi n taburt a vava invba / ccencen
t i z e b g atin im a yelli ghri b a ” ( “ P l e a s e ,
father Inouba, open the door / Oh Ghriba
girl, jingle your bracelets”).
This refrain from a Kabyle song, “A Vava
Inouva,” rang out around the world in the early
1970s. Only 10 million or so Berbers, scattered
over the Sahara and North Africa, could unders-
tand the words, but the song became an interna-
tional hit.
Its young Algerian author, Hamid Cheriet,
took the stage name of Idir (“he shall live” in
Kabyle). “At a time when many epidemics were
raging, new-born babies were called Idir to ward
off bad luck,” he says. “I chose it as a tribute to
my culture, which I felt was threatened.”
The Berber people, who mostly live in the
mountains of Morocco and A l g e ri a , speak Shaw i ya ,
S h i l h a , K a b y l e , M z a b , R i fa i n , Ta c h e l h i t , Tu a r e g,
Ta r gi and Ta ri fit—all dialects of Ta m a z i g h t , t h e i r
n at i ve tongue, which is only recognized as a nat i o-
nal language in Niger and Mali. In other places,
Berber culture is ignored or even banned.
“They give me an Algerian passport, but I
have to get permission to speak my own langua-
ge,” says Idir who, like the great Martinican poet
Aimé Césaire, speaks up for “those who have no
voice.”
It never occurred to him to write in French,
the language of the colonizer in which he did all
his schooling, right up to a Ph.D in geology. Nor
would he write in Arabic, which was taught as a
second language in Algeria at the time.
“If I hadn’t left my village, I’d never have spo-
ken a word of Arabic,” he says. “French and
Arabic would allow me to get my message over to
a wider audience, but I wouldn’t know how to go
about it or what to say.”
Kabyle is a language of feelings and storytel-
ling that flows naturally in poetry. It is also the
language Idir has chosen to use. “To sing in
Kabyle is a militant act, a way of expressing my
rebellion, to say that I exist,” he says. “If I’d had
another profession, I would have found other
ways to express the same demands.”
Three languages for Algeria
The young Hamid Cheriet stumbled on sin-
ging by accident. He was born in 1955 in Aït
Lahcêne, a remote mountain village in Kabylia.
When he was nine, he went with his parents, sis-
ter and two brothers to Algiers. He attended a
school run by Jesuits,where “being Kabyle meant
you were part of some kind of dirty rebellion.”
His natural sciences teacher taught him to
s t rum a guitar.The future geologist started wri t i n g
songs when he was 16 and wa rmed to the Kabyle
s i n g e rs. In 1973, he was asked to stand in at the last
minute for the famous singer Nouara, who wa s
unable to sing live on the Kabyle radio station in
A l gi e rs the lullaby he had written for her.
Idir was an immediate success. In 1975, he
came to Paris to sign a contract with Pathé-
Marconi and stayed in France. Ever since, this
child of the Aurès mountains has celebrated
Berber culture through music, thus extending a
m ovement launched in the 1940s by major
A l g e rian wri t e rs such as Jean A m r o u c h e ,
Mouloud Mammeri , Mouloud Feraoun and
Kateb Yacine.These pioneers had to use French
to defend the Berber language if they were to get
a hearing.As Amrouche put it:“I think and write
in French, but I weep in Kabyle.”
These day s , Idir can go further than that . H e
a d vo c ates three languages for A l g e ri a — A r a b ,
Berber and French. “I want A l g e ria to take into
account those who live on its land, who love the
c o u n t ry and want to build it what e ver their ori gi n ,
language or religi o n ,” he say s. “Islam shouldn’t be

an official religi o n . R e l i gion is for believe rs , n o t
g ove rn m e n t s. Arabic shouldn’t have a special sta-
tus just because it’s the holy language of the
Koran—especially classical A r a b i c, a sanitized
tongue ordinary people can’t unders t a n d . No lan-
guage is more wo rt hy than another, e ven if Berber
is the oldest in terms of ye a rs. Fate has put these
languages on this land and they must remain
t h e r e .”
Straddling two cultures
But for the time being, the Kabyle radio stat i o n
t h at opened in 1948 is still the only media outlet in
Algeria that uses Berber. It is also “the only one
monitored by a censorship board,” says Idir. Ano-
ther French colonial legacy enables “ you to get
credits in Berber towards your baccalaureate gra-
d u ation exam if you wa n t .” But the language is not
part of the national curriculum. Since his election
in April 1999, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has
ruled out officially recognizing Berber, except after
a referendum that Kabyles fear might backfire.
“It’s a very dangerous idea. If such a vote took
place, the result might well be ‘no’,” says Idir.
“And if people say ‘no’ and reject a part of them-
selves, it would mean there’s nothing we can do
together. Except for a few fanatics, Berbers have
n e ver wanted independence.” Their main
demand is to be recognized as Berbers in their
own country. “As a Kabyle, I want to be an
Algerian through and through, not just partially,
as I am today,” he says.
A member of a minority group both in Algeria
and in France, Idir has chosen to straddle cultures.
“ I d e n t i t i e s ” , the title of his latest albu m , released by
Sony at the end of last year,is far from bland.Sin-
ging with him are Ireland’s Karen Mat h e s o n ,G e o f-
frey Oryema from Uganda, Bretons Gilles Servat
and Dan Ar Braz, the French-Galician Manu Chao,
the French groups Gnawa Diffusion and Zebda
(of Arab and Berber ori gi n s ) , all of them represen-
t at i ves of small cultures. He says they have allowe d
him to show that his own minority culture can be
part of the wider world. ■
