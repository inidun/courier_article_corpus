THE BRITISH
FILM :
Showing
the people
of England
as they
really are
by Dilys POWELL
Film Critic,'Sunday Times', London
PASSPORT TO PIMLlCO : A sudden and strange problem of " international relations."
WATEVER criticisms mav
be made of the British
wartime cinema, no-
hody can say that it
betrayed any liking for war. In
fact. paradoxically enough, it was
between 1 ! J40 and 1U45 that British
films began to make an apprecia-
ble contribution towards interna-
tional understanding.
At a first glance the independent
observer might say that there
was nothing particularly interna-
tional about the British cinema.
We have rarely tackled interna-
tional subjects in the way in
which the Swiss have tackled
them in The Last Chance or
Four in a Jeep. We have pass-
ed over such current racial pro-
blems as anti-Semitism and the
colour question (though a version
of Alan Paton's Cry, the Belov-
ed Country is is still to come).
When we have chosen some
theme of racial or national rela-
tionships we have not been parti-
cularly successful in exciting
popular interest. Just after the
war we had an ambitious film on
an important subject to show- :
Men of Two Worlds, a story of
the battle against the tsetse fly
and the position of the African
\vho is torn between his European
education and the traditional
superstitions of his own people.
But Men of Two Worlds, was not
a popular film ; and though the
things it said were very well
worth saying I greatly doubt
whether it made much impres-
sion.
And yet I helieve that the Bri-
tish cinema has been a very con-
siderable factor in creating inter-
national goodwill. The obvious
thing, of course, would be to
point to our long list of docu-
mentaries with their impeccable
democratic principles. And It is
quite true that the documentary
film can do a great deal to make
people see one another's point of
view-or, almost as important,
to show the other man that his
point of view is recognized ;
when Paul Botha made The
World is Rich it was evidence
that people in Britain were not
kept in ignorance of conditions in
hungry India and war-stricken
Asia. The trouble is that the
documentary rarely reaches
beyond an audience which is
prepared for special pleading.
Now and then there is an excep-
tion ; for instance Daybreak in
Udi, a delightful account of the
buildiug of a Nigerian maternity
home in the teeth of the witch-
doctor ; here was a piece, fairly
widely shown, which made its
effect not by talking about pro-
gress but by showing us what
chaming and likable people the
inhabitants of Cdi really are.
Subtle Persuasion
But the real strength of the ci-nema lies in its power to per-
suade people who don't know
they are being persuaded. That
is where the American film has
scored all these years ; while en-
tertaining us it has built up a
great popular sympathy for
America. I believe that the Bri-
tish cinema is making, and
should make, its impact in the
same \vay. In other words, I
believe that by producing films
about ourselves we shall make
our best contribution to interna-
tional goodwill. Uur way of
doing it cannot be the same as
Hollywood's. America is a young
and ebullient nation, and pan-
ache comes easily and naturally
from her. The British are an old
and disciplined people, senti-
mental beneath a veneer of re-
serve, and the British cinema.
must speak in their native emo-
tional accent. That this is the
right approach has been proved
since the war by the success of
British films with Continental au-
diences and minority audiences
in America. To capture the at-
tenlion of the American masses
is another matter; ; let us not pre-
tend that we have as yet begun
to do that. But it is worth noting
that among the most successful
of our films in America have
been some of the most un-
ashamedly British : Henry V,
Hamlet, Quartet - films which
make no concessions to American
taste.
The theory that the sharply na-
tional film appeals to an interna-
tional audience is borne out by
the reactions of the French to
British films. I have to confess
that I am one of the less fanatical
admirers of Brief Encounter,
and I have sometimes been puzzl-
ed by the enthusiasm of my
French friends for the piece ; but
to my enquiries they always
reply :"It's so English.'" One
might be tempted to suppose that
their admiration was less for the
film itself than for its evidence of
British chastity, weere one not
confronted by enthusiasm also for
two films of a very different
type Passport to Pimlico, a
thoroughly English joke in a tho-
roughly English setting ; and
Whisky Galore, a thoroughly
Scottish joke in a thoroughly
Scottish setting.
Interpreters..-.'. j.
Often, indeed, it is the improb-able f√¨lm \vhich wins heads
abroad : who would have.
thought that Red Shoes would
gain a prize in Japan ? But proba-
ble or improbable, the films serve
as interpreters. As I have said, the
process of liaison began during
the war, when for the first time
in the cinema we began to look
without self-flattery and self-de-
migration at ourselves. It goes on
today with such quiet studies of
character and background as
Morning Departure or The Brown-
ing rersion or Whire Corridor: :
films which observe the beha-
viour of human beings and pre-
sent it with sympathy and under-
standing. What I want from the
cinema of other nations is a truth-
ful interpretation of human na-
ture : I can only assume that in
the long run other people have the
same tastes. And we in this coun-
try have passed the stage when
we could be content to be present-
ed abroad as a nation of comic
housemaids and dukes in mono-
cles.
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY : A comedy about London, two mining brothers from Wales, and some everyday men and women from England.
