Enough is enough. Around the wo r l d , NGOs are
on the campaign trail to pressure gove rn m e n t s
and donors into keeping the promises they
will make at an upcoming intern ational conference
on education in Dakar (Senegal)1.
Their concern :p r o gress since the World Confe-
rence on Education for all held at Jomtien (Thai-
land) in 1990, where gove rnments committed them-
s e l ves to an expanded vision of education and a set
of goals (see box), has fallen short of targets set.
“Whereas we emerged from the Cold War and the
risks of military conflict decreased compared to
the 70s and 80s, we did not use this margin of
manoeuvre as we could have. History gave us this
o p p o rtunity and we did not take it,” s ays Elie Jo u e n
of Education International, one of the world’s lar-
gest teachers’ organizations and a partner in the
campaign.
Spelling out 
solutions
“ We are wo rried that Dakar is going to turn
into another talking shop where eve ryone reaffirm s
things already agr e e d , sets new targets and then, a s
after Jomtien,goes home, cuts the aid budget and
a l l ows debt problems to continue underm i n i n g
education systems of Third World countries,” says
Kevin Watkins of Oxfam Intern at i o n a l , author of a
hard-hitting report on education and poverty (see
b ox p. 3 6 ) . “ For these conferences to wo r k , yo u
need to create a public perception that there is a
serious problem which people have to tackle.And
you have to come up with solutions.”
The campaign reflects not only the rising invo l-
vement of NGOs in educat i o n , but also their emer-
ging role as a watchdog with formidable advocacy
t o o l s.And they have realized that to be effective ,t h e y
have to act in numbers.The founders of the cam-
paign launched last October encompass a broad
range of interest groups: Education International,
the Global March against Child Labour, and deve-
lopment aid agencies ActionAid and Oxfa m . A t
the gr a s s r o o t s ,i n i t i at i ves from rallies to media cam-
paigns and consultations with ministry officials are
being conducted in over 60 countri e s. C o m m u-
nity organizations are working on national reviews
to ensure that the voices of civil society groups are
heard. More broadly, the campaigners are urging
g ove rnments to take a hard look at their educat i o n
strategies and spell out the steps required to meet
commitments.
At the international level, the campaign is lob-
bying for deeper and quicker debt reduction,r e f o rm
of structural adjustment policies and increased aid.
In some countries, it may be a question of reallo-
c ating resources. In others , especially in sub-Saharan
A f ri c a ,c o u n t ries cannot fill the resource gaps alone.
Best estimates suggest that it would cost about $8
billion extra a year to achieve unive rsal pri m a ry
e d u c at i o n , a sum equivalent to about four day s ’
global military spending.
While praising the advo c a cy powe rs of this coa-
l i t i o n ,m a ny caution against singling out the resource
issue.“In many countries,it’s just as much a ques-
tion of good governance and making better use of
existing resources,” says UNESCO’s Sven Osttveit.
Aïchah Bah Diallo, director of the division of basic
e d u c ation at UN E S C O, stresses that gove rn m e n t s
who have made a difference are those with an edu-
c ation policy “ t h at sells.”T h i s , she assert s , can only
come about through part n e rships not only with
other ministries but with the society at large,espe-
cially teacher trade unions and the media. Next,
“ you need transparency, and for this, a stop to cor-
ruption.”That being said,Osttveit regrets that the
Jomtien Declaration failed to specify global finan-
cial targets. Nor will Dakar. The danger is that
pledges without resources run a high risk of ri n gi n g
hollow. Hence the critical role of public opinion in
defending basic education as a right and a key to
escaping the trap of poverty. ■
