CULTURE
AND
DEVELOPMENT
The human dimension
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
THE fate of modern societies is enacted on a stage
which now encompasses the planet. Societies which
until a few decades ago were able to live in almost
total ignorance of each other are today in increasingly close
and regular contact. There is a growing interplay of recip¬
rocal influences; interdependence is a reality in many fields
of human activity.
Yet while this interdependence is undoubtedly a source of
mutual enrichment, receptivity, new initiatives and creativi
ty, it is also a cause of frustration to the extent that it is ac¬
companied by worsening conditions for certain peoples, and
feelings of growing uncertainty and increased vulnerability.
Sensitivity to changes, wherever they occur in the world, is
becoming acute.
It is perhaps in the field of culture that the contradictory
demands of new world relationships are most readily discer¬
nible. Communication between human beings is becoming
global in its scope, and the quantity of knowledge and infor-

mation available is constantly increasing. With the develop¬
ment of computer technology, the possibilities of collecting
this knowledge and information, of storing them and
transferring them from one point on the planet to another
are also continually expanding.
These exchanges and contacts are accompanied by a
growing tendency towards a standardization of tastes and
behaviour, and a homogenization of certain patterns of life,
thought and action, of production and consumption pro¬
pagated by the uniform dissemination of the same television
series, the same musical rhythms,, the same clothes and the
same escapist dreams.
This growing conformity, which seems to follow an inter¬
nal logic of its own, is gradually invading more and more
areas of human activity. In its turn it generates distortions,
since it tends to promote whatever conforms to it and to
destroy everything that resists it. Whole sectors of creativity
are thus repressed, and societies mutilated in their in¬
dividuality and their distinctive structure. Carried to the ex¬
treme, this logic could lead to the ossification of mankind
since diversity, if accepted on a footing of complete equality,
is an essential and fertile source of vitality for both in¬
dividual societies and the whole world.
However, as a kind of reaction to this trend, a renewed,
explosive affirmation of individuality is emerging. Com¬
munities everywhere ethnic and national, rural and urban,
cultural and religious are asserting their originality and
endeavouring to take in hand and defend with vigour those
features by reference to which their identity is defined.
The will to affirm and defend cultural identity appears
now as one of the major driving forces of history. Far from
representing a withdrawal into an immutable, self-enclosed
past, it fosters a lively, original and constantly renewed syn¬
thesis. A sense of cultural identity thus appears more and
more to be the sine qua non of progress for individuals,
groups and nations; it is the force that animates and under¬
pins the collective will, mobilizes inner resources and turns
necessary change into creative adaptation.
It is today recognized that the notion of cultural identity
lies at the very heart of development problems, but it is only
recently that this fact has won full acceptance by the interna¬
tional community. It is only in the last ten years that our
understanding of development, its paths and aims, has
broadened and deepened. Originally equated with simple,
linear economic growth vital, certainly, insofar as an in¬
crease in the production of material goods makes a decisive
contribution to the improvement of people's living condi¬
tions, when such goods are equitably distributed develop¬
ment has increasingly been seen to be an infinitely more
complex, comprehensive and multidimensional process,
which is effective only if it is based on the will of each society
to fulfil itself, and only if it truly expresses each society's
underlying identity.
Genuine development can only be generated from within,
willed and conducted by all the vital forces of the nation. It
should therefore encompass all aspects of life and involve all
the energies of a community within which each individual,
each occupational category and each social group has its part
to play in the general effort and has its share in the resulting
benefits.
As so often happens, this growing awareness of the true
nature of development was largely brought about by the set¬
backs experienced in developing and industrialized countries
alike.
The developing countries, tempted to catch up with the in¬
dustrialized countries by following the same paths, have
sometimes endeavoured to adopt approaches to development
which, seeking to achieve rapid economic progress by often
inappropriate means, did not always produce the expected
results, or even brought new constraints which not only
reproduced but aggravated those which had handicapped
the industrialized countries.
At the same time, the industrialized societies, considered
to be the most developed, have also come to realize the very
serious problems caused by economic growth seen as an end
in itself. Damage to the natural environment is exacerbated
by new constraints which threaten man's very existence as a
social being attached to a community with which he can fully
identify.
The whole international community is thus today, in dif¬
ferent ways, increasingly coming to accept the idea of in-

tegrated development in which economic, social and cultural
factors are indissolubly linked and contribute together to
progress. Culture, which is connected with all expressions of
life and which, for every human being and every people, is
the expression of their highest values and their very sense of
life, emerges as the factor which is to guide and humanize
economic growth and technical progress.
To take account of the cultural dimension or objec¬
tive of development is to recognize that the goal of develop¬
ment should be to render man unto himself, in other words
to grant him a place in the world which magnifies his ex¬
istence instead of narrowing it, a time befitting his needs and
desires, a city in which he can be integrated rather than re¬
jected, a community joined together in solidarity, and an oc¬
cupation which brings him dignity and freedom. This is to
attach due importance to creativity, which implies that each
people assume its own identity by enriching and continually
reinventing it through acts, words and artefacts.
Tradition must also be reckoned with, although it should
not necessarily be seen as an obstacle to modernization. It is
only when the sign loses its meaning that tradition may
become negative, immobile introspection. It is far more ac¬
curate to see tradition as the cumulative record of the ex¬
periences of a community throughout its history.
As a result of cultural innovation, tradition may take on a
new lease of life, become part of life as it is lived, and even
contribute to development and progress. The conquest of
modernity can be achieved by bringing up to date the forms,
relationships and symbols which constitute, at the deepest
level, the specific face of a culture. Innovation, the dynamic
aspect of cultural identity and action, will be the agent of
this awakening.
Thus the notion of cultural identity is today indissociable
from that of development. Three major spheres of human
activity education, science and communication which are
also Unesco's fields of competence, are closely linked to
culture and combine to extend its action in the service of
development.
Culture and education foster the growth of social roots.
From the viewpoint of development they appear as essential¬
ly complementary. Economic and social development is
largely conditioned by the conception of the world which
prevails in a given society, but this conception of the world is
itself influenced by the message transmitted by educational
systems and the sensibilities which they help to stimulate.
Modern schooling has taken the place of traditional educa¬
tion. This trend is irreversible, but the new forms of educa¬
tion are not always appropriate to the situation and real
CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY
The assertion of cultural identity was considered to be an act of liberation, a weapon in the fight for effective
independence and the best means of achieving the self-fulfilment of individuals and the harmonious develop¬
ment ofsocieties. It was, moreover, the first prerequisite for the advent ofa new world order, based on the in¬
alienable right of nations to dispose of themselves and on the recognition of the absolute equality and dignity
of all cultures.

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. Cultural
identity is not a problem for the general public but for the
educated, whose upbringing has often included virtually inevitable
elements of cultural alienation. The élite must return to their
culture to understand it more effectively and experience it as a liv¬
ing reality in order to find their roots in it. Seem from this angle,
cultural identity should be asserted primarily in the schools and
universities. An élite, often educated in other schools and
sometimes unsure of its identity, must be helped into awareness of
its own heritage and its eyes opened to thefact that popular culture
is not merely folklore. -

needs of individuals and groups. A widening rift in intellec¬
tual and cultural life may be observed with the extension of
schooling, an uneasy coexistence between an elitist culture
and a popular or traditional culture which has virtually
nothing in common with the former.
In a number of countries, oral tradition is the authentic
memory of the people and, swelled by new contributions
from each generation, explains the world in all its diversity.
In most cases too, its symbolism opens a door onto a
fabulous world of the imagination. The data recorded in the
oral tradition must be rediscovered and collected, for to
destroy or banish them to oblivion would be irreversible.
But there are many other ways in which education must
be linked to the most significant values of a culture. To take
one notable example, an effort must be made to avoid the
shock of uprooting a child which occurs when he is taught
from the moment he enters school in a language which is not
his own. The use of languages spoken by the community to
which the child belongs thus appears as both an educational
and a cultural imperative. Associated with this major choice
should be various reforms which, through the promotion of
popular arts and traditions, and social values, would aim to
implant education in the realities and history of the nation.
In this way it is certainly possible to gain from peoples
that conscious and active participation without which there
can be no profound sense of cultural identity nor any truly
endogenous development.
Another fundamental question is that of the relations bet¬
ween science and technology, on the one hand, and culture
on the other. Whether we like it or not, the implantation of a
technology is a cultural phenomenon. Even in cases where
the introduction of certain technologies brings the most ob¬
vious benefits, the transfer is not culturally neutral and may
cause a distortion of standards and the emergence of new
values bearing no relation to deep-rooted social and human
realities.
It seems to me desirable, whenever possible, to try to
develop on the spot a technology adapted to the specific
needs of each situation, instead of turning to imported for¬
mulae when the latter cannot be satisfactorily mastered. The
best and most vigorous development will always be en¬
dogenous development, that is to say, development con¬
sciously and fully assumed by everyone. For if the demands
of development require that no society can do without
science, if science is to be most fruitful it must grow roots in
each society. Science will not contribute to improving the
lives of men in countries where it is perceived as a foreign im¬
port until the day when it becomes an integral part of their
culture.
And so the need to participate in decision-making concer¬
ning scientific and technological development appears to be
emerging in various societies. This trend suggests a certain
shift in aspirations, from exclusively economic goals to a

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. The question of
each group or nation 's cultural identity, which is at the meeting-
point of culture and communication, shows the importance of
language both as a vehicle of communication and as part of the
cultural heritage. Linguistic richness imposes not only a respectfor
the many languages existing but also a complex and costly adapta¬
tion of the communication networks to the different linguistic
areas, as well as the use of many languages by the communication
media in order to avoid standardization. Language policy therefore
constitutes one of the thorniest and most important issues in the
formulation of communication policies.

range of ultimate objectives related to social and cultural
development. It also appears to be the sign of growing
awareness of the decisive role played by technology in the
development of societies, and of the determination of peoples
to assume greater responsibility for their own future, with a
fuller knowledge of what is at stake. Thus the search for
greater compatibility between the directions in which
technological change is steered and the expectations of socie¬
ty may well be one of the key issues of the coming decade.
Communications technology has made such strides in the
last few years that it has revolutionized life and development
in both industrialized and developing societies. Increasingly
people are encountering other cultures in their everyday
lives, discovering other values, observing attitudes un¬
familiar to them, and thereby coming to know the many
faces of mankind. And soon, through direct satellite televi¬
sion broadcasting, it will be possible to transmit knowledge
globally, and the irruption of other cultures into every home
will be a permanent fact.
Whether the role of the new instruments is beneficial or
harmful will depend on the way in which they are used by
mankind. It seems indispensable to integrate the com¬
munications media into cultural policies, for it would be vain
CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. Culture, which
was not something separate from consciousness of the
community's identity, was probably regardedfirst andforemost as
a factor making for a stronger sense of national individuality; but
the quest for cultural identity was in all cases combined with sym¬
pathetic receptivity to the other cultures of the region and of the
world, and, ultimately, to all that is universally human, which
ruled out cultural isolationism and entailed the disavowal of
chauvinistic assertions of distinctive nationhood.

CULTURAL IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY. One might well
ask whether the perfectly legitimate desire to eliminate the elitist
aspects of culture has not, as a side-effect, led to a certain under¬
valuation of the specific function of creation in the totality of
social functions. To put the question in the most basic terms: what
would disappear if creation were to disappear from society?

to pretend that the media only raise problems of a technical
order. They are bound to have repercussions on political at¬
titudes, on social behaviour, on ways of thinking, and thus
on culture in the broadest sense.
If development is the concern of all institutions of the
United Nations system, cultural questions devolve exclusive¬
ly on Unesco, which has for some years been making an
original contribution to the problem of cultural development
by launching and promoting the idea of "cultural policy."
An intergovernmental conference on cultural policy was
held by Unesco in Venice in 1970, and subsequently a
number of regional conferences met in order to deepen and
continue, in their specific contexts, the process of reflexion
begun by the international community and to accelerate the
evolution from an elitist concept of culture to that of cultural
action committed to development which would promote the
fulfilment of individuals and communities.
"Development must find its inspiration in culture", says
the unanimously adopted Declaration of the Bogotá Con¬
ference (1978). Unesco is continuing this long-term effort by
holding a world conference on cultural policies in Mexico
City from 26 July to 6 August in order to make an assess¬
ment of this "first cultural development decade" and to set
forth guidelines for the future.
