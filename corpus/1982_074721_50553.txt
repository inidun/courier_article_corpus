Blackboard bungle?
A defence of the school
as the cornerstone of education
by Arthur V. Petrovsky
ACCORDING to Unesco statistics, almost one-sixth of the
world's population is still illiterate. The percentage of il¬
literacy is particularly high in Africa and Asia. The ap¬
parently unresolvable contradiction between the demand for
education and the material possibilities of satisfying this demand
have led to talk of a "world education crisis", although attempts
to extrapolate the real difficulties confronting education in the
developing world to the educational situation in other countries
seem to go a little too far.
Thus the USSR is today in the process of solving, with overall
success, the problem of teaching and educating its rising genera-

tion. The country which sixty-five years ago had an illiteracy rate
of 73 per cent has in this short period eradicated illiteracy, whereas
forecasts made by the Education Ministry of Tsarist Russia shortly
before the October Revolution indicated that it would take at least
120 years to provide universal education in European Russia, and
4,600 to achieve the same goal in central Asia and the Caucasus.
The right to education, proclaimed by law, is exercised in a
whole network of educational establishments of different kinds. In
the USSR one person in every three is a student, and over
100 million persons are receiving some form of education. Some
44 million children attend schools providing a general education.
These observations should lead to the establishment of a sharp
distinction between the characteristics of educational development
in the developing countries and those in the industrially developed
countries.
In the developing countries the expansion of educational systems
and the increase in the number of pupils are sure to lead to the
characteristic distortions of a "growth crisis". The first of these, ^

^ breaking the link between the educational system and the needs of
society, will lead to the school being cut off from the outside
world, and to an increase in the ranks of the educated unemployed.
Secondly, distorsions will arise within the educational system itself,
stemming from a lack of co-ordination between its various stages
and constituent parts. Still poorly attended and beyond the reach
of the mass of pupils who complete primary schooling, the secon¬
dary school forms a bottleneck, especially since it does not prepare
its pupils for productive work but for entry to an institution of
higher education which in practice the majority of them will never
reach.

In almost two-thirds of African countries, the proportion of
young people who enter secondary education does not reach the
threshold of 10 per cent which, specialists believe, is indispensable
for autonomous development. The percentage of students in in¬
stitutions of higher education is no more than 1-2 per cent in the
developing countries (0.2-0.3 per cent in some parts of Africa).
Attention must also be drawn to the disharmony between the
acute need for qualified personnel and the speed and nature of
their training, and the disparity between limited material resources
and the magnitude of the tasks on hand.
The developing countries are just as keenly aware of the problem
of the content of education and of increasing its efficiency as the
industrially developed countries. How to bridge the gap between
an ever-rising tide of information and the amount of knowledge
that schools can actually provide? This problem is bound to worsen
in the developing countries since they have inherited from long
years of colonialism defective, second-rate educational facilities.
In recent decades, these countries have tried in several ways to
find a solution by maintaining the bases of pseudo-classical educa¬
tion with the addition of a few correctives inspired by the spirit of
the age; by recourse to practical training in primary schools (at the
expense of general subjects); by maintaining in secondary and
higher education institutions a high level of training similar to that
in the industrially developed countries; by radically overhauling
general education in order to gear it to a future occupation, usually
in farming; by splitting education into two systems, one
"practical", the other "academic".
The basic problem facing the developing countries is how to find
the most efficient methods of intensifying the teaching effort. This
is also a central preoccupation of educators in the developed coun¬
tries, and on its solution, to a large extent, hinges the future of
world education.
But may there not be a way of solving all these problems at once,
of cutting the Gordian knot? Some people believe that such a
course is possible, and that the answer is simply... the abolition of
schools.
As I discovered when I was a member of Unesco's international
commission on the development of education, there is no easier
way to win applause and make a reputation as an "innovator"
than to boldly attack the school. The accusations levelled against
schools (and against education in general) as well as the commen¬
dations they attract, always follow the same lines: education
institutionalized in the school is "reactionary", "conservative",
and "elitist"; the school is incapable of transmitting a corpus of
knowledge to the pupil; the pupil should enjoy the same rights as
the teacher, deciding what he or she wants to learn and how. For
these reasons schools should be abolished, perhaps not immediate¬
ly but in the not-too-distant future.
Does this old and faithful ally of humanity in the struggle to ac¬
quire knowledge, culture and education really deserve such op¬
probrium? Born several millennia before the Christian era, at the
time of the flowering of ancient Egypt, Babylon and India, the
school has satisfied human needs and all that constitutes the pride
and glory of humankind has emerged from its walls. So what has
happened on the eve of the twenty-first century? What arguments
are advanced by the proponents of a "radical criticism" of the
school?
Argument number one: the school acts as a brake on progress.
School education is essentially "conservative"; it reinforces in¬
equality between men. Its consequence is the transmission of
established, tested and thus notoriously out-of-date opinions. It is
in the interests of those who define the goals and content of educa¬
tion to make sure that others know no more than they do
themselves.
Such, roughly speaking, is the case made by the "radical critics"
who maintain that education is a force "that helps people to accept
society as it is and to resign themselves to it." Can this point of
view be upheld?
The fact that education involves the transmission from genera¬
tion to generation of tried and tested opinions and experiences is
no more a criterion of conservatism than the use of tried and tested
medicines by the medical profession. It would be a mistake to
regard as conservatism the relative stability of any kind of educa¬
tional system (educational systems often possess a dynamic of their
own). Admittedly, the facts and laws to be transmitted to the pupil
may change, today more rapidly than ever, as the scientific and
15

^ technological revolution progresses, but this dynamic of change
should not be pushed to the absurd.
The experience of a soundly based educational reform, as cur¬
rently being carried out by the Soviet Union, for example, shows
that the inevitable, well-founded modifications in the syllabus are
not an exact, point by point reflection of the scientific discoveries
of today and yesterday. The nucleus of knowledge transmitted to
the pupil undergoes relatively slight changes whereas modifications
occur more rapidly in the envelope of information which surrounds
this nucleus.
It is equally inaccurate to maintain that education is always reac¬
tionary, just as it would clearly be wrong to claim that it is always
progressive. The educational system as it has emerged historically is
reactionary if the social and economic principle underpinning the
Is school the enemy of creativity?
society in which it functions is reactionary. Everything depends on
the goals and content of education. A partial approach can only
lead to confusion.
Argument number two: it is just as easy to learn in a café as at
school. The theory of "incidental education", whose supporters
advocate deschooling, envisages the free exchange of opinions, en¬
counters with interesting people, freedom from interference by
teachers, from the spine-chilling fear of examinations and from
blinkered study programmes. "Studying" in a café and sweetening
with liqueurs the bitter root of knowledge undeniably holds more
appeal to some than attending school. There can be no doubt that
the cinema, the street and the mass media are sources of informa¬
tion; there is in any case no question of underestimating their im¬
portance.
However, scientific knowledge, that is to say the presentation of
what is general and essential in objects and phenomena and, afor¬
tiori, of systematic knowledge, can only be communicated by
means of structured teaching and above all by a soundly organized
school. The goal of a school is precisely to enable each individual
to learn how to learn, in other words to give him an opportunity to
acquire knowledge for himself, to develop his capacities for
assimilation and to stimulate the need to know and under¬
stand.
Argument number three: young people are always right. Bran¬
dishing this slightly modified version of the salesman's slogan that
the customer is always right, the "radicals" claim that they are put¬
ting young people on their guard against teachers who "attach too
much importance to the printed word" (i.e. books and textbooks),
against systematic education which may "paralyze" the free-
ranging creativity of young people, and against examinations
which are "an insult" to the free expression of their personality. In
practice, these "revolutionary" appeals are transformed into an ir¬
responsible attitude on the part of teachers towards their pupils
and into indifference on the part of the pupils towards their
teachers.
The affirmation that "the pupil should be able to choose where,
how and what subject he studies; thus education will be adapted to
each individual" has the same ring as those set forth above.
Undeniably each person is free to choose the general direction of
his studies. But the programmes, the methods, and the textbooks
imply a harmonization without which it would be impossible to
create equal conditions for all. Pupils are not equal in energy and
abilities, their level of education varies, and a certain individualiza¬
tion of education is indispensable; but this must not become, in the
educational system of the future, an end in itself. The in¬
dividualization of education is one of the most important aspects
of the universalization of education, but it is neither an absolute
nor a panacea.
Admittedly, certain types of school and certain forms of
teaching are open to criticism. Many aspects of schooling call for a
complete overhaul and invite reforms. However, rejection of the
school as a social institution, now or in the future, would be tanta¬
mount to capitulation in the struggle for education, and would
mean that we should enter the twenty-first century with the pro¬
blems and difficulties bequeathed to us by the twentieth.
Like a meridian and the horizon, the line we draw between cen¬
turies and even millennia is a convention. Only what we sow here
and now will bear fruit beyond that line. It is up to us to see that
the harvest is good, and that it satisfies humanity's ever-growing
need for universal knowledge and understanding.
Arthur V. Petrovsky
We want to construct an economy? Then look at our peoples. Who are they? They are many, they are poor,
malnourished, badly housed, sick, without education and reduced to unemployment. This must be our starting
point. There can be none other.
