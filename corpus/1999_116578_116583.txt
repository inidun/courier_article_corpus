Is cultural tourism on 
the right tra c k ?
w M i ke Robinson
Tourism has long been assumed to promote cultural understanding and peace, but in fact 
it often chips away at cultures and leads to confli c t
Among the Toraja people of Sulawe s i ,
I n d o n e s i a , not all was going well with touri s m .
In fact, resentment became so great over the
way in which sacred funeral ceremonies were being
adapted to meet touri s t s ’ needs that in the lat e
1 9 8 0 s , a number of Toraja communities simply
refused to accept tourists.
The Toraja example highlights the dilemma that
faces contemporary cultural touri s m . On the one
hand tourists increasingly seek exotic and often
unique cultural spectacles and experi e n c e s , and are
willing to pay a premium to do so. But on the other
h a n d , the ve ry presence of tourists can chip away at
local culture and essentially re-invent it to fit the
exigencies of the tourism industry.
The result is that host communities find culture
and traditions under threat from the purchasing
p ower of the tourism industry. Neither are touri s t s
better off from the cultural viewpoint. Instead of
getting rich and authentic cultural insights and
e x p e ri e n c e s ,t o u rists get s t a ge d a u t h e n t i c i t y ;i n s t e a d
of getting exotic culture,they get kitsch.
With nearly one billion intern ational trips expected
in 2000, the impact of tourism on culture has become
so palpable that the question arises as to whether or
not we can continue along the current path without
something having to gi ve . More than eve r , we must
find a way to achieve sustainable cultural touri s m .
S u rp ri s i n g l y, and in contrast to the attention gi ve n
to the natural environment in the sustainable
d e velopment debat e , ve ry little energy has been
d e voted to this end.A major reason for this lethargy
a p p e a rs to lie in our basic assumptions about touri s m .
The predominant notion is that touri s m
g e n e r ates cultural harm o ny.This idea deri ves from
the romantic (and elitist) traditions of travel in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and is today
e n s h rined in the World To u rism Organizat i o n ’s
mission stat e m e n t , which includes the goal of
fostering international peace and understanding.
But claims that tourism is a vital force for peace
are exaggerat e d . Indeed there is little evidence that
t o u rism is drawing the world closer together.T h e
t ruth is that a host of cultural conflicts have
developed around tourism.
Little thought is gi ven to the fact that touri s m
is one globalizing influence which can initiat e
d r a m atic and irr e ve rsible changes within the cultures
of host communities. U n f o rt u n at e l y, while the idea
that we should respect cultures and cultural rights
m ay be present, the idea that we should s u s t a i n
cultures is not fully deve l o p e d . Nor is there any clear
indication of which cultures we are speaking of
Perhaps the most obvious conflict is betwe e n
t o u rist and host.This is in part engendered by the
fundamental difference in goals: while the touri s t
is engaged in leisure, the host is engaged in wo r k .
While the tourist arri ves with loads of expectat i o n s ,
m a ny of the local stakeholders often have no idea
of what to expect.
Another source of conflict is between the often
p e rs u a s i ve and economically powerful deve l o p e rs
and operat o rs of the intern ational (though mainly
first world) tourism industry and the host country.
To u rism can turn local cultures into commodities,
t h at is, consumer items much like any others.
R e l i gious ri t u a l s , ethnic rites and festivals continue
to be reduced and sanitized to conform with touri s t
e x p e c t at i o n s , resulting in what one scholar has
dubbed “reconstructed ethnicity.”
An unequal relationship
Pa rt of the conflict stems from the fact that
p a c k a ging culture begins well away from the cultural
s i t e . Cultures are reduced to a two - d i m e n s i o n a l
world carried by glossy brochures presenting idyllic
l o c ations and generally reducing distinctive cultures
to superficial and readily substitutable narratives.
The flow of tourism receipts is mainly to the
d e veloped world—where the majority of touri s m
businesses are locat e d — c r e ating a perm a n e n t
backdrop for conflict.
Another level of conflict is found among different
s e c t o rs of the host community. For example, l o c a l s
working in the tourism industry might have different
goals from those of agricultural wo r k e rs in the same
c o m m u n i t y. Access to tourism employ m e n t ,w h i c h
in developing countries also means often access to
r e l at i vely high wa g e s ,m ay be skewed to certain social
and ethnic groups.
The attraction of generating hard curr e n cy
r e l at i vely quickly and often with minimal inve s t m e n t
compared to, s ay, establishing a manufa c t u ri n g
i n d u s t ry, is a powerful argument for gove rn m e n t s
of both developed and developing nations seeking
to develop tourism.
H owe ve r , the va rious levels of touri s m - r e l at e d
cultural conflict force us—or should force us—to

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
question the very foundations of cultural tourism.
A c t i ve collaboration with local cultures must be at
the centre of any efforts to promote sustainable
cultural touri s m . H owe ve r , to date the extent of
c o l l a b o r ation remains narr ow and almost a token
a f t e rthought following environmental and economic
c o n s i d e r at i o n s. One study has shown that in New
Zealand Maori economic invo l vement in the touri s m
i n d u s t ry amounted to less than one per cent.
Though definitions might differ, I would argue
t h at at its heart sustainable cultural tourism recognizes
the value of cultural dive rs i t y, and needs to prov i d e
local cultures with a forum in which they can
p a rt i c i p ate in decisions that affect the future of their
c u l t u r e . In other wo r d s , host cultures should be
e m p owered to say no or yes to touri s m , and in the
l atter case, to set guidelines for tourism if they so wish.
There are examples where the redistri bution and
ow n e rship of resources are being addressed in touri s m
in such a way that indigenous peoples are begi n n i n g
to move from being the prov i d e rs of cultural
e x p e riences for touri s t s , to having an ow n e rship and
management role in touri s m . (See pages 30-33).
Such examples are encouragi n g, though still few
and far betwe e n , and even then, largely shaped by
f i rst world value systems. It is the allocation of
cultural rights and subsequent respect for and
protection of those rights which underp i n
sustainable development and should underpin the
notion of sustainable touri s m .Those cultural ri g h t s
need to be accompanied by rights in other areas.
A rmed with land, resources and intellectual propert y
ri g h t s , communities and cultures can not only
influence the direction and pace of touri s m
d e ve l o p m e n t s , but also provide or withhold consent
for them.
Except for some rare cases, I am not at all
c o n fident that at present we are on the right track
at all.The tourism industry and the gove rn m e n t s
and organizations which empower it cannot, a n d
arguably would not,engage in dramatic structural
and intellectual reshuffling which would put the
notion of cultural consent at the centre of a
collaborative process.
Under the current self-regulat o ry approach, t h e
i n d u s t ry can encourage local community
p a rt i c i p ation in the management of touri s m
resources and can aim to include non-traditional
d e c i s i o n - m a k e rs in the development process.T h e
problem is that it does things in a way that is
designed to serve both the economic goals and
desires of the tourism industry, and the dominant
first world value systems which it represents.
One of the implications of a sustainable touri s m
c o n s t ructed around the idea of cultural consent is that
t o u rism may be rejected outri g h t . More likely is that
via more equitable collaborat i o n s , the nat u r e ,e x t e n t
and type of tourism development will be adopted to
suit the cultural needs of the host community. E i t h e r
way the challenge is to establish mechanisms which
will invo l ve local cultures and transfer to them the ri g h t
to decide on the type and extent of tourism which t h e y
wish within the economic, e nvironmental and cultural
limits which they have set. n
