THE MYTH ABOUT THE TROPICS
O ! \LY horses sweat : gentlemenper per·pire and ladies glow.
There can never be product-
iw life in the Tropics
until humanity emulates the
horse. Bv all scientific indica-
tions man is a tronical animal.
Physiological tests have hitherto
failed to show that the black man
is any more suited to life in the
heat than the white, yet the myth
that the Tropics are no place for
a white man and that sojourn
there saps the mental and phy-
sical energy of men from temper-
ate climates still remains. In
defiance of that myth, however,
Queensland has been success-
fullv settled and there are many
prosperous parts in the southern
States of America which would
he rated as"tropical"from their
climates were they anywhere else.
The term"tropical"has come to
have a psychological rather than
a geographical or climatic mean-
ing : do people complain more of
Tropical Fatigue in Rio de Janeir,)
than they do in Bahrein ? They
ought to, if such a thing existed,
as Rio is withi. n the Tropics and
Bahrein outside.
Human laziness is responsible
for this myth. Man, like other
animals, produces heat as he lives
and the harder he works the more
heat he produces. In warm cli-
mates the body's problem is to get
rid of this metabolic heat. To
do so, the superficial tissues warm
up to the internal temperature of
the body and blood flows into the
skin'so that it becomes flushed
and hot. This hot skin radiates
heat to cooler surroundings and
nooler air moving over the skin
takes up heat from it.
The heat loss by these two
routes is adequate at first, but it
becomes more difficult as the
temperature rises until at 88° F.,
only if a man is naked and in-
active can he get rid of his meta-
bolic heat ; if it gets warmer his
temperature rises and the third
mechanism for heat loss, the
evaporation of sweat, becomes
important. The sweat glands. begin
to produce sweat and as this
evaporates from the'skin it takes
up the heat that could not be got
rid of by convection and radiation.
by Dr. W. S. S. LADELL
Anything impeding heat loss
bv these two routes will reduce
the temperature at which the
sweating mechanism comes into
play ; for example, a poor flow of
air over the skin, or, of course,
clothing. Similarly an increase in
the total amount of heat to be lost
win necessitate sweating sooner ;
this extra heat may be from
working muscles-twice as much
heat is produced when strolling
at two m. p. h. as when sitting
quietly-or it may be acquired
externally, as by standing in the
sun when the heat gained from
solar radiation may be more than
that produced by walking at
4 m. p. h.
However, by suitable clothing,
by keeping out of the sun and in
the breeze, and by not putting up
heat production by working, a man
can usuat) y avoid sweaiing, but for
1 productive) life in the Tropics
a man must be willing to sweat ;
in vast areas of the world there
is poor nutrition caused in part at
least by man's temperamental
unwillingness to do so. The same
physiologically induced laziness
leads to economic difficulties and
to dirt and disease and a vicious
circle is set up. It is dirt, disease
and malnutrition that kills in the
Tropics, not the climate.
Man's cooling system involves
two d'stint physiological func-
tions. The first concerns the
heart and the blood flow through
the skin bringing the metabolic
heat to the surface, and the other
the production of sweat, the eva-
poration of which removes heat.
Tests show that a temper-
ate climate man reacts badly to
work in heat when he is first
tried out ; the opening up of blood
vessels in the'skin drains blood
from other parts so that his heart
begins to race and he may vomit
or faint ; sweating is low in start-
ing and not profuse. But with
training the body compensates for
the extra blood vessels to be fined
by increasing the amount of blood,
so that those dangers pass ; then
he begins to sweat sooner and
more freely, and thus becomes
"acclimatized to heat". Tests on
tropical men. both in Asia and
Africa, have shO\vn,. surprisingly,
that the-se men react more like
untrained temperate climate men
than like"fully acclimatized"in-
dividua) s, and with training they
show the'same changes.
This is because indigenous
tropical man rarely works hard in
the heat ; he prefers to take life
quietly, to move slowly and take
no exercise, and to catnap fre-
quently ; he avoids sweating and
keeps his agricultural activities to
the minimum, living when possible
as Adam did in Eden. The immi-
grant to the Tropics, however, who
works hard and plays hard be-
comes nearly completely acclima-
tized, and-thus the paradox that
he is better able to work in the
heat than the locally-born.
But then all around him the
immigrant sees the indigenous
man cultivating inactivity, sleep-
ing when he can and avoiding
hard physical work. Surely, the
immigrant asks himself, the local
inhabitant must know best ; so he
too begins to work short hours,
and to take a long midday sleep
from which he arises confused
rather than refreshed to restart
his broken day.
When a man sweats he loses
water which must be replaced.
Physiologically it is best to drink
as one sweats, but drinking when
at work is often frowned upon ; so
by evening men have substantial
water deficits. Pure water is dull
stuff, so the tendency is to make
good the deficiency with more
interesting alcoholic drinks ;
compatriots and friends gather
together to exchange news and
gossip ; nostalgia stimulates more
drinking : so insidiously an immi-
grant community becomes mildly
but chronically alcoholic and thus
develops"Tropical Neurasthenia".
Possibly the best tropical settlers
are the Moslems who are for-
bidden by their religion to touch
alcohol. But prohibition is not
necessary, merely the recognition
that to drink water as one sweats
is natural and desirable, a sign
not of weakness, but, of good sense.
The salt tosses in the sweat
must also be made good, otherwise
grave disorders will result. Man
needs half-an-ounce of common
salt per day and even more in very
hot climates or with strenuous
work. Part of tropical man's
unwillingness to sweat may pos-
sibly be an expression of a salt
lack or a recognition of the diffi-
culty of replacing salt.
Improved living and working
conditions, with or without air-
conditioning, will help to reduce
the heat load, but the settler
cannot avoid the heat of the air.
Sweat is only praiseworthy when
it is the outcome of useful effort ;
so tractors should be fitted with
canopies, and hats should be wide-
brimmed enough to shade the
whole body from the sun.
The way to productive life in the
Tropics is the same as anywhere
else : eschew sloth. A tropical com-
munity must be prepared to work
as hard as it would do in a tem-
perate climate and no. t be frighten-
ed of the heat ; by hard work food
production can be increased and
indigenous diseases eradicated.
Tropical men must be t1\ugllt
that they are not like cattle who
cannot sweat well and have to rest
for half the day to prevent being
overheated, even at the risk of
starving themselves ; men are born
with sweat glands so that they
may safely work in the heat. The
brunt of the day's work. must be
done before taking a nap. Let
communities in these areas deve-
lop into fully integrated societies,
where isolation and boredom are
no longer the lot of every man
when his day', s work is done, and
separation from wife and family
the rule rather than the. exception
for the immigrant.
Recreation must be provided,
so that alcohol can revert to
its correct role from being a uni-
versal hobby to a useful social
lubricant. With a real home life
and the development of cultural
facilities the brain worker too can
play his part. But the key above
all is the willingness to sweat, and
only when much sweat has flowed
will a community be able to afford
such extravagant luxuries as
improving its local climate by air-
conditioning...
