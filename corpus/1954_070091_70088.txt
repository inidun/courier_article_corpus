I
n the monastery
churches of Yu¬
goslavia,- artists
and historians are
today engaged in
one of the great
"treasure hunts" of
art history. The
prizes they seek are
medieval wall paint¬
ings which were
(lost to the world
for 500 years, buried
beneath coats of
whitewash and plas¬
ter applied by the
Ottoman Turks who
overran the Balkans
in the 14th and 15th centuries.
After this time few travellers from
Western Europe journeyed along the
Balkan roads, once main trading
routes and communication highways
between East and West. Those who
did, often stopped to look at the mys¬
teriously beautiful churches and mon¬
asteries standing in isolated settings
like monuments to a happier past.
Though they could only see a very
minute part of the vast treasure of
frescoes that really existed, they came
away entranced by the beautiful
things they witnessed.
But it was not until the 19th cen¬
tury, with the removal of a part of
Turkish dominance, that a small echo
of this great hidden wealth began to
reach the outside world, and that it
became possible to undertake a serious
study of Yugoslavia's rich medieval art
which flourished from the 11th to the
14th centuries.
In 1872, an exhibition of Serbian
Byzantine art objects was held in
Moscow. Two years later another was
held in Kiev. Soon foreign archaeolo¬
gists, architects and art historians
began to visit the churches and mon¬
asteries of Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia-
Herzgovina and Montenegro, and they
were amazed.
In 1881, a British art historian
named A. Evans caused a sensation
in art circles by publishing a series of
articles on Serbian medieval art. He
claimed that without a knowledge of
the hidden masterpieces in the Bal¬
kans one could not really understand
the Renaissance art of Italy, and he
compared the Angel of the Resurrec¬
tion, a delicate fresco produced by a
Serbian artist in the 13th century
Milesevo Abbey, with the best works
by Michelangelo.
By the beginning of the present
century, Yugoslav specialists had
mapped out their first full-scale plans
to investigate all of Yugoslavia's medi¬
eval art, and taken the first steps in
the overwhelming job of uncovering
and restoring their art treasures.
Thus began the great "treasure
hunt" which Yugoslav authorities have
resumed since the end of the last
World War with a vigour unequalled
in the past. As these unknown
treasures have gradually been recover¬
ed they have opened new landmarks
in the history of European painting
and thrown considerable light on the
development of Byzantine art which
originated in the eastern part of the
Roman Empire when, in 330 A. D., its
first Christian emperor, Constantine,
removed the capital from Rome to the
old Greek city-state of Byzantium, re¬
naming it Constantinople (Now Istan¬
bul). Byzantine Art developed from
Egypt to the Balkans and Russia, and
from Mesopotamia to Italy.
Byzantine art was religious in char¬
acter and served chiefly to depict the
principle figures in the Bible. It
provided visual explanations during
church services, prompting one autho¬
rity to say that it was probably one of
the world's first "picture stories" of the
New and Old Testament. Although

Monastery of Mana-

of that time it was

Byzantine art is generally characterized
by a severity and formality of design,
the medieval artists of Yugoslavia
showed remarkable originality in
departing on many occasions from the
rigid stylization of their time. They
instilled in their works elements of
freshness, realism and rhythm. They
portrayed their figures as human
beings, vibrant with life, with indi¬
vidualized faces and "normal" eyes
instead of the usual fixed gaze. In
the 12th century, they gave the art of
the fresco a new direction imparting
to it both greater flexibility and
expressiveness.
This more humanistic approach is
well illustrated by the wall paintings
dating from 1164 found in the little
Macedonian church of Nerezi, near
Skopje, which was built at the same
period as Notre Dame Cathedral in
Paris. Here, in the various scenes of
the Passion the Descent from the
Cross,. the Entombment and the Mourn¬
ing of the Virgin the Nerezi painters
have captured feeling and emotion,
sadness and compassion with striking
vividness. In the Entombment, for
example, contrary to the ecclesiastic
codes of the time, the Virgin isxseated
with Christ tightly held in her arms,
her face pressed against his head.
This face expresses the supreme suf¬
fering of a mother weeping over her
dead son.
In scenes such as these of death and
suffering, human beings racked by
pain or deeply moved by compassion
have been portrayed with such force
and realism that André Grabar, author
of a profound study on "Byzantine
Painting" and professor of Byzantine

history at the famed College de
France, has described them as "a
landmark in the history of European
painting" and "in advance of all Euro¬
pean paintings of the same period."
The 13th and 14th centuries saw the
development of a definite Serbian
school of fresco painters, the most
notable examples of their work being
found in churches and monasteries at
Milesevo, Sopocani, Gracanica and
Studenica.
Serbian painting probably reached
its greatest height in the 13th century
in the monumental frescoes of the
monastery of Sopocani. The Death of
the Virgin, for example (see repro¬
ductions, page 34) would deserve to be
included in any history of art. The
human qualities which are portrayed,
the feeling of grandiose effect and
the dignity of the draped figures ;
these and the manner in which each
figure is drawn with individual psy¬
chological expressiveness and an
everyday realism, have led one critic
to call it "the most brilliant example
of what 13th century artists achieved
by way of a return to nature."
The oldest frescoes of Yugoslavia are
only now coming to light. They have
been discovered in the picturesque lake
shore town of Ochrida in mountainous
southwest Macedonia. There, on the
walls and vaults of the Church of
Saint Sophia, paintings dating back to
the early 11th century have been .
uncovered during the past four years
which are an artistic discovery of the
first order.
Not only do these frescoes reflect
accurately the various phases in the
construction of the church itself, but
since they are representative of a
broad period
ranging from the
11th to the 14th
century, they
offer something
that is distinctly
Tare a general
view of the deve¬
lopment of By¬
zantine expres¬
sion through
the course of
several hundreds
of years in a
region that was
of capital im¬
portance in the
evolution of
Byzantine art.
The Church of
St. Sophia of
Ochrida is one of
the most imT
portant and an-
c i e n t religious
buildings sur¬
viving in Mace¬
donia. It is remarkable for the deli¬
cately proportioned lines of its archi¬
tecture as well as for its frescoes. Its
graceful two storey galleried arcade,
added in the 14th century, brings to
mind contemporary Venetian buildings.
The church is at least 900 years old
and may have been begun a thousand
years ago, though its exact date of
construction or its founder is not
known.
Age, dampness and neglect, however,
have damaged St. Sophia considerably.
Sometime before the 17th century fire
destroyed a part of the church. The
Ottomans, who had transformed it into
a mosque in 1466, restored the" damaged
portion and rebuilt the roof. But it
was so heavy that it buckled the vaults
Chancel of St Sophia of Ochrida as it appeared
at start of restoration. Most of its frescoes were
still hidden under plaster. Working on high scaff¬
olding, experts patiently removed the coating
from the roof and (as shown on page 39) brought
paintings to light. To remove some paintings
(inset) canvas covered with strong glue was
applied to wall, and painting with backing of thin
plaster was then peeled off, like the skin of an orange.
and pushed out the walls. Later, at
an undetermined date, the vaulting and
cupolas caved in. In 1913, a year after
the end of Ottoman rule, the people of
Ochrida re-roofed the church, again
putting excessive pressure on the
walls.
Various attempts to restore Saint
Sophia were made afterwards, some of
them harmfully bungling. In 1950, an
Historic Monuments Commission of
the People's Republic of Macedonia
(one of the six Federal Republics of
present-day Yugoslavia) made a preli¬
minary study of the damage.
In many places they found the
foundations too weak to hold up the
superstructure, masonry had crumbled
away, beams had rotted, walls and
arches had buckled. The south wall,
containing many frescoes, was in
the worst shape. Because of the
complexity of the problem, the Yugo¬
slav government asked Unesco to send
an advisory mission which arrived in
December 1951. Ferdinando Forlatti,
an Italian architect and Superinten¬
dent of Monuments at Venice, who had
successfully tackled similar problems
in restoring the Venetian Palazzo dei
Trecente, led the mission. The direc¬
tor of the Central Institute for Res¬
toration of Rome, Cesare Brandi, and
Yves Froidevaux, chief architect in
charge of historic monuments in Paris,
accompanied him. Working with Yu¬
goslav experts, the Unesco mission

YUGOSLAVIA (Continued)
made a month-long investigation of
the church and drew up recommenda¬
tions for restoring Saint Sophia and
its frescoes. (1)
The delicate job of saving the church
and its paintings began almost at
once. The Yugoslav government asked
Mr. Forlatti to stay on and direct the
work along with the Yugoslav architect-
engineer, Boris Cipan, Director of the
Institute for the Protection of Historic¬
al Monuments of the Republic of
Macedonia.
Straightening out the south wall of
Saint Sophia was probably the hardest
job. The whole, wall leaned outward
and at one end there was a bad jagged
break. The Unesco mission recom¬
mended that a complicated arran¬
gement of heavy beams and strong
cables be built to snag the jag back
into place and then straighten up and
back the wall. (See diagram below).
The preparations for this took two
months. Workmen set about building
a giant wood and iron rectangular
frame, 90 feet long, around the wall of
the church, the idea being that as the
steel cables were tightened the frame
would' straighten out the wall. On
May 2, 1953, Yugoslav and Italian
directors were ready. In two hours
the jag was straightened. Two days
later, two hours again were enough to
pull the wall back to support the roof.
The special repairs made to the walls
consisted mainly of boring and filling
holes with a cement specially resistant
to humidity. This was carried out
with a tool operated on the principle
of a syringe a new instrument which
had been developed in Italy.
But before any of this work could be
started, the frescoes had to be remov¬
ed. In the past, frescoes were painted
on thin coats of plaster spread over a
layer of finely mixed sand, clay and
sometimes even mud covering the stone
or brick walls. The artist painted his
picture, or such sections of it as time
permitted, on the thin plaster layer
while it was still moist. As the
picture dried it became an integral
part of the wall.
For the damaged frescoes of St.
Sophia careful incisions were made in
the outer plaster to get at the sand-
clay mortar behind. Then the paint¬
ings were lifted off in sections with

their mortar backing. For the un¬
damaged frescoes a special glue was
spread on canvas and the canvas
was applied to the wall. The mural
was then peeled off like the skin of an
orange, with the thin layer of plaster
holding the colour.
Once off the walls, the murals were
specially treated and the mortar
thinned down, sometimes to as little
as two-tenths of an inch, after which
they were placed on new, strong wood
bases and remounted on the walls.
Thus far more than 600 square metres
of frescoes have been uncovered in the
church. On certain walls, it was
found that several layers of paintings
existed which thus presented a rare
panorama of the development of the
Macedonian school of Byzantine art in
the most compact space possible.
The restoration of Saint Sophia of
Ochrida has been an excellent example
of international co-operation between
specialists - which Unesco seeks to
foster this time between artists, ar¬
chitects, archaeologists and engineers.
These contacts have led to others.
Experts from Yugoslavia have recently
visited Italy and France to study res¬
toration methods, and Italian and
French specialists have gone to Yugo¬
slavia to investigate the great treasures
that have now been revealed by the
restoration work still in operation and
scheduled for completion in 1955. Such
contacts contribute towards a better
knowledge of the common values of
the past, and to a better understand¬
ing of the cultures of different peoples
which are Unesco's major goals. The
album of colour reproductions on the >
medieval frescoes of Yugoslavia's chur¬
ches in Unesco's World Art Series is
another step in the same direction.
