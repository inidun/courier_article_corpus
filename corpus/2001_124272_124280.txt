In the first universities of medieval
E u r o p e,800 years ago, an individual who
questioned official attitudes could find
himself an outlaw.The notion that there
was value in challenging what society
thought permissible through public
debate emerged later, as a result of the
religious and intellectual wars of the
16th and 17th centuries. G r a d u a l l y, a
tacit agreement developed between the
state and universities, whereby freedom
of speech in the public interest was
allowed.
Governments—and to some extent
university administrations themselves—
are losing sight of the reasons for pro-
tecting this community that is allowed,
like the court jester, to ask authorities
awkward questions. Universities are
increasingly seen as training centres
rather than as institutions of higher lear-
n i n g.They are expected to produce skilled
workers instead of critical scholars in
societies where a computer programmer
is deemed more valuable than a philoso-
pher.
Pressure to reduce government spen-
ding coupled with rising student enrol-
m e n t h a s d r i v e n universities world-w i d e
into the arms of commerce.The constant
search for funding is time-consuming and
inefficient. Moreover some “big name”
universities attract private funding more
easily than others because of their pres-
tigious “ b r a n d n a m e s.”When universities
“ c o l l a b o r a t e ” or enter “ p a r t n e r s h i p s ”
with big corporations, the lawyers of the
latter are generally far more astute in
pursuing their clients’ interests than those
negotiating on behalf of universities.Th e
corporation offers a new building, s a l a r i e s
to attract “big leading players,” e q u i p-
ment. In return it may retain control of
the direction of the research and even
impose a new set of staff relationships.
B e f o r e, long-term posts in the uni-
versities gave scientists the opportunity
and security to pursue novel ideas that
arose during their work. But commer-
c i a l l y - financed research aimed at specific
projects does not allow for digression. I t s
prime objective is to produce the goods—
marketable products—leaving funda-
mental science to the sidelines. Th e
sponsor can also control the intellectual
property rights and even the right to
publish the project results. It can prevent
the scientist from sharing research at an
international conference and can even
stop his or her work if the funder doesn’t
like the way it is going.
The old expectation was that scientific
expertise was global in its reach and
e x c h a n g e. Scientists met in international
conferences and gave papers which eve-
ryone could discuss. I n d e p e n d e n t , r e s-
pected voices could be heard to disagree
with the claims of government or corpo-
rate-sponsored research.Today, the cor-
porations are buying up this expertise,
leaving very few voices to challenge what
they are telling the world.
Some international watchdogs are
beginning to take action. Yet even the
American National Academy of Sciences
considers that it is difficult to find indivi-
duals of sufficient seniority and with
visibly clean hands to form a watchdog
body that would call to account those
who manipulate data,appropriate ideas
or bend conclusions. We need a critical
mass of these brave and articulate indi-
viduals who are willing to speak out until
academic freedom is restored and reco-
gnized as a protection of everyone’s free-
doms. ■
