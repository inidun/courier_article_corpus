/Art Nouveau architecture in Latin
Europe embraced such a wide range
of styles, even within individual coun¬
tries, that ¡t is hard to find a common
denominator between them.
It spread like a language, like a
lingua franca that was enriched by
contact with and borrowings from
local dialects, but kept unchanged
certain elements of syntax. A form of
architecture intent on collaboration
with all the figurative and decorative
arts, it could call on a wide diversity
of artistic traditions. Its composite
nature and its variety were due as
much to its cosmopolitan tendencies
as to a desire to extend the traditional
repertoire of regional or national art
forms.
Art Nouveau architecture deve¬
loped somewhat later in the Latin
countries than elsewhere in Europe
and, with the exception of Catalan
Modernism, in which the early stir¬
rings of a desire to affirm national
identity can be detected, there were
no strong local movements to help
it on its way.
Although it would be vain to try
to discover a common stylistic thread
linking the Latin countries of Europe
(with the possible exceptions perhaps
of Spain and Portugal), the poetics of
their distinct architectural languages
do share certain common features
which may help us define some
essentially Latin characteristics of Art
Nouveau architecture.
This line of approach was first
suggested by Salvador Dali in one of
the earliest and most penetrating
assessments of Art Nouveau architec¬
ture, his essay On the Terrifying and
Edible Beauty of Modern Style
Architecture, which was published in
1 933 in the Parisian surrealist maga¬
zine Minotaure.
With this provocative appraisal of
Art Nouveau architecture made in the
mid-1 930s, at a time when the rest
of the world subscribed to the the¬
ories of rationalist architecture, Dalí
issued a double message which
historians should take into account.
Drawing from the poetics of Art Nou¬
veau those elements most readily
assimilable by surrealist art, he
declared firmly that, between Art
Nouveau and the twentieth-century
avant-gardes, there was a network of
inter-relationships far more complex
than most historians admit. By
emphasizing the most "alogical",
almost "demential" aspects of Art
Nouveau architecture, he showed
that, to fully understand the contri¬
bution of Art Nouveau to modern art
and architecture, those works most
tainted with bad taste should not be
ignored. Highly significant artistic
statements can even be found by
rummaging through these artistic
rejects.
Some Art Nouveau buildings in
Paris and Barcelona possess the

"terrifying and edible beauty" of
which Dalí wrote (among the
examples used to illustrate the
Minotaure article were works by
Guimard, Jules Lavirotte and Gaudi1).
The values highlighted by Dalí are
found not only in Catalan and
Parisian Art Nouveau architecture but
also in that of other Latin regions.
This is particularly true of the quality
of "movement which. ..is primarily
intended to arouse a kind of great
'primeval hunger' ", like "the ultimate,
¡deal architecture which would
embody the most tangible and
delirious goal of hypermaterialism...
not only because It denounces the
violent materialistic banality of
immediate needs..., but also because
it unashamedly alludes to the nutri¬
tive, edible nature of houses of this
type, which are nothing other than
the first edible houses, the first and
only erogenous buildings whose
existence is an affirmation of that
'functional' trigger of the amorous
imaginationto be able in the realest
possible sense to eat the object of
desire."
Is not this need for "hypermateri¬
alism", given metaphorical expression
in the art of cooking, the thread that
links certain Paris buildings by S.
Wagon and Paul Auscher, whose
florid ornamentation calls to mind
some elaborate piece of confec¬
tionery, to those works of Gaudi
which are decorated with ceramics as
some cakes are decorated with crys¬
tallized fruit? Is it not also this same
need that links the subtle erotic allu¬
sions of certain Modernist Catalan
architects to the unabashed triviali¬
ties of Lavirotte's building in the
Avenue Rapp, in Paris, orto some of
the more fantastic projects of the
Italian architect Adolfo Coppedé?
Is not the revolutionary architec¬
tural framework that Gaudi, thanks
to his remarkable knowledge of con¬
struction techniques, introduced in
some of his buildings (one has only
to think of La Pedrera, which seems
to defy the laws of gravity, or of the
prolific Doric colonnades of the Güell
Park) in some respects a unique
manifestation of "the profound
devaluation of intellectual systems"?
And is it not in the Latin coun¬
tries that we find the most eye¬
catching examples of ornamental
excess, of "hysterical sculpture", of
the multiple metamorphoses of
Baroque/Art Nouveau and Rococo/
Art Nouveau pastiche, from which all
sense of restraint is absent? Are not
the dragons of a fantastic Orient
refashioned by Gaudi's imagination,
or the strange cast-iron fauna
evoking the world of the ocean
depths and recalling the sculptured
gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals, that
adorn Guimard's buildings and lend
their forms to his entrances to the
Paris Metro, virtually unique
examples, in the European context,
of that incursion into the fantastic
world of dreams, that return to
infancy of which Dalí speaks?
EZIO GODOLI, Italian art historian, is
professor of the history of architecture at the
University of Florence He has published a
number of works on Art Nouveau, including
Vienna, 1900 (with F Borsi, Lund Humphries,
London, 1 986), Pans, 1900 (with F Bora,
Rizzoli International Publications, USA, 1988),
and a dictionary of Art Nouveau and
Symbolist illustrators (with G Fanelli, Florence,
1990)
