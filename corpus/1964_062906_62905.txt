RESURRECTION OF THE ESKIMOES
\A/HEN the Eskimoes lived alone in the Far North they
** hardly knew what illness was. But from their first
contact with civilization they harvested tuberculosis, then
syphilis and later poliomyelitis. Sixty years ago, the Eskimoes
were a disappearing race. Today, the trend has been re¬
versed. The Eskimoes seen in these photos, who live in
the Far North of Canada, have increased from 7,000 to over
12,000 in the past 15 years. .One reason is the health net¬
work dispensaries, airborne doctors and air ambulances,
andpreventative services, including tuberculosis case-finding
now woven over great reaches of the Eskimo country.
CHILDREN OF THE ESKIMOES (above
and below) were the first to benefit
from new health services in the Cana¬
dian Far North. To maintain these
services for a widely scattered popu¬
lation of about 12,000 Eskimoes costs
an average of $2,000 per head annually.

year of life. Now, thanks to better health practices
and emergency aid, four children out of five survive.
