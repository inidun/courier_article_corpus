Small countries
and the international community
IMAGINE, for a moment, the captain of
a ship on a voyage of discovery. He
sweeps the horizon with his spyglass
but he is holding it the wrong way round . He
does not see small islands at all, and even
larger ones seem puny. Now suppose that
an inhabitant of one of those islands comes
aboard the vessel and takes a turn at look¬
ing through the spyglass, but from the end
which is turned towards him. The repre¬
sentative of the outside world and all his
trappings will look very imposing. The
islander realizes that it will certainly be
worth his while to come to an understand¬
ing with this impressive personage.
And this, indeed, is how small States and
large States perceive each other. Seen from
the vantage-point of a large State, a "micro-
State" seems even smaller than it really is,
and too often it is written off as negligible.
After all, did not the League of Nations
decide, round about 1920, that States which
it dubbed "Lilliputian" could not join it as
full members? From the opposite point of
view, small States see large ones as
looming, not to say threatening, presences,
but laden with wealth from which they must
find a way of benefiting.
Nowadays, the international community
sees small States more and more clearly. In
the 1960s, a State was regarded as small
when it had fewer than five million, or even
ten or fifteen million, inhabitants.
However, towards the end of the decade,
the less populated States were poised on the
threshold of independence. The United Na¬
tions turned its attention to the status that
they should be given. Specialists busied
themselves with finding ways in which these
new States might be associated with the
international agencies without disrupting
their modes of operation. The United Na¬
tions Institute for Training and Research
(UNITAR) worked to devise criteria for
defining small States, and its prime choice
was the criterion of population. With the
disclaimer that this was arbitrary and not a
hard and fast rule, it set the limit at one
million inhabitants.
During the 1970s, several States whose
population was well below the one million
mark joined either the United Nations
founded on the principle of the sovereign
equality of all its members or its Special¬
ized Agencies. Unfortunately, it is not
enough to be a member: it is also necessary
to be present and to make one's views
known, particularly at major international
conferences; and this calls for human and
financial resources.
Other international organizations have
since grasped the importance of facilitating
small States' participation in the concert of
nations. In 1983, the Heads of State and
Government of the Commonwealth raised
the question of the vulnerability of small

States, which were numerous among them,
and asked for a study to be made of their
specific needs. This task was entrusted to an
advisory group which submitted its report in
1985: The criterion selected by this group
was the same as that ofUNITAR, namely, a
population of fewer than one million in¬
habitants.
Also in 1983, a group of experts from the
non-aligned countries chose as the criterion
for small developing island countries a
population in most cases lower than 400,000
inhabitants and seldom higher than one mil¬
lion, combined with a territory of less than
700 km2 and not usually more than 4,000
km2.
The United Nations Demographic Year¬
book (1980 and 1981 editions) lists forty-
nine territories of varying political status
whose population is lower than 200,000 in¬
habitants, and sixty-four territories whose
area is less than 5,000 km2. In this last

category, all except nine are island States.
No mainland developing country meets
both the criteria of the non-aligned; on the
one hand, five developed mainland coun¬
tries do satisfy this requirement: Andorra,
the Holy See, Liechtenstein, Monaco and
San Marino (the Holy See, with an area of
forty-four hectares and 1 ,000 inhabitants, is
the smallest State in the world). The smal¬
lest developing countries with inland fron¬
tiers are, in population, Belize (158,000
inhabitants, 22,965 km2) and, in size,
Brunei (5,765 km2 and 220,000 inhabi¬
tants). Ultimately, if the twofold criterion
of population and area is used, the smallest
developing countries are all islands.
Small States are fully aware of the fact
that the interest taken in them by large
States is only spasmodic. The latter could, if
they wished, ignore them altogether. But is
this really what they want? The workings of
island societies are the outcome of perma-
- w

nent tension between the assertion of their
own individuality and the need to fit into a
network of foreign relations. This is equally
apparent in the cultural, political and eco¬
nomic spheres.
Islands may be remote, but they show a
surprising receptiveness to the rest of the
world. The economic production of small
island States is usually highly specialized
and essentially geared to exporting. Where¬
as local products are exported, local con¬
sumption is mainly supplied by imports.
The exports themselves incorporate im¬
ports at every stage of production: plant,
intermediate products and bank credit. In
many cases, machinery must even be sent
abroad for repair.
It is no exaggeration that, for many small
States, the external sector represents the
entire economy. There is, indeed, an inter¬
nal sector, but it is confined to a quarter¬
master's role: it provides the consumer
goods and services necessary to the popula¬
tion or useful to export activities. It could
not continue to exist if it were not supported
by the income from exports or the revenue
of workers in the external sector. Such ex¬
ports may be agricultural produce (the
coconut palms which look so pretty on tour¬
ist brochures also yield oil and copra),
manufactured products (Mauritius, a sugar-
producing island, has become one of the
major world centres of the knitwear indus¬
try) or services (banks in the Bahamas or
insurance in Bermuda). Some countries
even export postage stamps: in Tuvalu,
their sale is sufficient to offset public expen¬
diture.
Several island countries also export
labour. It is quite usual to hear people say,
on small islands, that more of the islanders
are abroad than at home. For example, at
the time of the 1981 census in Niue, it
emerged that 5,091 islanders were living in
New Zealand, as compared with 3,278 in
Niue itself. Goods sent home by emigrants
can also play an important role in the eco¬
nomy. These invisible imports, in Cape
Verde, for example, represent more than
ten times the value of exports.
Small island countries are particularly
vulnerable to fluctuations in the world eco¬
nomy fluctuations over which they have
no control but to which they are compelled
to adjust. For instance, a very small change
in agricultural policy, or a protectionist
drive in a particular sector of a developed
country, or an international agreement
negotiated between large States, can bring
the economy of a small island State to its
knees. Such a State will then have no choice
but to seek favour with the large States, and
above all to become "visible".
For example, in 1980, the Republic of
Maldives, a small country with 176,000 in¬
habitants, classed in the category of the
least-developed countries, succeeded, not
without difficulty, in acquiring a small fac¬
tory for knitting woollen garments. In 1982,

^ it exported 40,000 dozen knitted garments
to a large country. The following year, the
latter imposed a quota of 25,000 dozen,
although the factory had already received
orders for three or four times that number.
The Republic of Maldives accordingly
turned to GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade), which it had recently
joined to suit the circumstances. The costs
of participating in negotiations in Geneva
and in Washington were likely to exceed the
expected profits, but by what other means
could this tiny country make itself heard by
the international community?
The UN and its Specialized Agencies are
of vital importance to the small States. It is
only right to emphasize this at a time when
they are the butt of criticism. Such forums,
where the small can engage in dialogue on
an equal footing with the great, afford
advantages to both sides. The founding role
of Malta and the active part taken by Fiji in
the United Nations Conference on the Law
of the Sea are a good illustration of the
contribution that small countries can make
to the international community.
One should be wary of the over-optimis¬
tic belief that international organizations
can provide small countries with absolute
safeguards. The only stretch of land to have
been literally pulverized by a nuclear
weapon is an islet of the Bikini atoll, which
belongs to a Pacific Trust Territory of the
United Nations. It was blasted out of exist¬
ence in 1950 by a nuclear test carried out by
the trustee authority. Moreover, the
maintenance since 1964 of a United Nations
force in Cyprus did not prevent the partition
of the island in 1975.
In fact, the problem of the effective parti-
. cipation of small States in international in¬
stitutions still remains to be solved. The
financial cost involved is high. Goodwill can
help to lighten the burden: since 1983 Aus¬
tralia has subventioned an office which is
shared between the missions to the UN of
the Maldives, the Solomon Islands,
Vanuatu and Western Samoa. The perma¬
nent missions of Dominica and Saint Lucia
also share their offices. However, human
constraints are equally important. A coun¬
try with a small population, which by defini¬
tion has a very small number of officials,
finds it difficult to send them to represent it
abroad when they are required to give
priority to managing affairs of state at
home. For a time, the small island countries
were represented, when necessary, by the
diplomats of countries which were friendly
towards them. But nowadays they seem less
inclined to have recourse to this solution.
The States joining Unesco are also be
coming smaller and smaller. The average
population of the first 16 Member States in
1946 was in those days 59 million inhabi¬
tants (11.5 million if one discounts China
and India). The average population of the
16 most recent Member States and Associ¬
ate Members which are the subject of this
issue is 769,000 inhabitants. This is a wel¬
come trend. Joint action and multilateral
negotiations are particularly rewarding for
small States in their efforts to gain a foot¬
hold in the international order. Similarly,
international organizations are a useful
means whereby large States can hear what
the small and vulnerable have to say, so that
they may all work together to build a more
reliable, stable and just international order.
