Schools  F rom pollution to over- p o p u l a t i o n , education has 
a key role to play in helping learners realize early on
how they can influence the future—for the better
n
Gone are the days when env i r o n m e n t a l
e d u c ation was simply about nat u r e
outings in pri m a ry school to discover the
local flora and fa u n a , or projects to unders-
tand a regi o n ’s landscapes, economic activi-
ties and traditions.To d ay,the accent is on no
less than giving students the right set of tools
and values to become eco-citizens—respon-
sible consumers , p r o d u c e rs and decision-
m a k e rs , able to  measure the implications of
their actions, not only on their own surr o u n-
d i n g s , but at a more global leve l .
In an environmentally literate society,
e c o n o m i s t s , for example, will have a basic
u n d e rstanding of what a balanced ecosystem
is while biologists will be in a position to
grasp such notions as economic effic i e n cy.
“Just as with literacy, it is through educat i o n
t h at we can train citizens to integr ate env i-
ronmental dimensions into their decision-
making processes,”argues Canadian biologi s t
and author Claude V i l l e n e u ve1. “The objec-
t i ve is to change behaviour in order to dimi-
nish the impact of human activity on the
b i o s p h e r e .As such, it is an education geared
t owards action.An ecologically literate pers o n
should be able to understand and act in spe-
c i fic ways in his or her daily life.”
The new 3Rs–
Reduce, Reuse,Recycle
At the community college where he
teaches in Quebec, V i l l e n e u ve and his col-
leagues put this credo into practice throu-
ghout the science fa c u l t y. Whether in bio-
l o g y, c h e m i s t ry or physics experi m e n t s ,
students are asked to show systemat i c a l l y
t h at they have chosen the least dangerous
option for the env i r o n m e n t ,b y, for example,
minimizing waste or foreseeing special recy-
cling containers. In studying a physical phe-
nomenon like the meanders left by water on
an inclined plain, students will observe what
happens when those naturally traced by ri ve rs
are tampered with, leading to erosion, d e f o-
r e s t ation and a rise in water leve l s.“The aim
is to make students aware of sound env i r o n-
mental practices at the end of their studies by
setting down objectives that are common to
all disciplines,” explains V i l l e n e u ve .
With their often centralized and ri gi d
s t ru c t u r e s , e d u c ation systems appear ill-
equipped to break down the wat e rtight wa l l s
b e t ween disciplines and integr ate env i r o n-
mental concerns across the board. Ye t , t h e
process towards a more holistic approach is
u n d e r way at all leve l s ,s p u rred by the present
c risis and an emergi n g,more interdependent
vision of the future.
From the 1972 United Nations Confe-
rence on Human Environment in Stockholm
to the highly publicized 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio, d e velopment and environment have
gone from being radically opposed to each
other to standing on parallel tracks.The rea-
lities of population gr ow t h , depleting nat u r a l
r e s o u r c e s , rising pollution and widening dis-
p a rities between North and South—to men-
tion just a few causes for gr ave concern —
tell us that the present course is untenable for
both human beings and the biosphere itself.

the notion of “sustainable deve l o p m e n t ” .
Although it has been interpreted in more
than one way, the most commonly held defi-
nition was put forward in 1987 by the Wo r l d
Commission on Environment and Deve l o p-
m e n t , presided by Gro Harlem Bru n d t l a n d ,
as “ d e velopment that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs.”
In working towards this endeavo u r , t h e
p i votal role of education has been stressed
time and time again on the intern at i o n a l
s t a g e , from the 1990 conference in Jomtien on
E d u c ation for A l l , to other world gat h e ri n g s
on populat i o n , wo m e n , social deve l o p m e n t
and cities. The transform at i ve potential of
e d u c ation is often highlighted by the simple
fact that educated mothers are more likely to
adopt desirable health and nutritional prac-
t i c e s ,h ave fewer children and send their ow n
d a u g h t e rs to school.
In educating for sustainable deve l o p-
m e n t , the connections between people,
r e s o u r c e s , health and quality of life are
e m p h a s i z e d . “The objective is to deve l o p
responsible behav i o u r , to be able to make the
p e rtinent and right decisions, and act res-
ponsibly at an individual and collective leve l
t owards env i r o n m e n t a l ,p o p u l ation and deve-
lopment issues,” s ays Nathalie Barboza from
UN E S C O’s office in Dakar (Senegal).O ver the
past decade, a majority of countries in the
South have integr ated these concerns into
f o rmal and non-formal curri c u l a .
The motto of the environmental move-
ment—“act local, think global”—has lost
none of its hold.“ C o u n t ries generally find the
contents of programmes in the local reality,”
explains Barboza.“A teacher will, for example,
s t a rt off the geogr a p hy lesson by showing his
or her students a field of scorched eart h ,a n d
from there, discuss resource management
and the consequences of deforestat i o n .M o s t
t e a c h e rs feel directly concerned by these
questions and are aware that the key thing is
to develop responsible attitudes to preserve the
e nv i r o n m e n t .”R e flecting the interdependent
n ature of issues, the ministries of health,
yo u t h , social affa i rs and the environment are
often invited to work in tandem with educa-
tion authori t i e s.
In revising curri c u l a , disciplines often
take on a much more pertinent beat . I n
M e x i c o, for example, the recently revised
n atural science curriculum for pri m a ry schools
broaches topics such as the importance of
water for life, types of pollution and their
s o u r c e s , p o p u l ation gr ow t h , i n d u s t ri a l i z e d
and natural foods and how technologies affect
e c o s y s t e m s.The intention is to help children
view the environment as a “common good,
which requires different consumption pat-
t e rns for progress to be compatible with the
use of natural resources,” s t ates Edgar Gon-
z a l e z - G a u d i a n o, from Mexico’s Ministry of
the Env i r o n m e n t . “As of third gr a d e , t e x t-

The aim is to make students
a w a re of sound enviro n m e n t a l
p ractices at the end of their
studies by setting down
objectives that are common to
all disciplines

R e u s e , R e cycle—with special emphasis on
the firs t , to show the students the import a n c e
of looking after our natural resources, i rr e s-
p e c t i ve of how ‘ a bu n d a n t ’ they may be.”
One way to encourage transdisciplinari t y
is to make teachers feel they are part i c i p at i n g
in a common educational pr o j e c t ,s t resses V i l-
l e n e u ve .The notion of density in mat h e m a-
t i c s , for example, can be just as easily
explained in terms of dots on a page as by
trees in a forest. A teacher will likely choose
the second option if he or she looks at learn i n g
through an environmental lens. Making lear-
ning such a “future and action-ori e n t e d ”
project requires, in the best of wo r l d s , the par-
t i c i p ation of the society at large.
Learning to think globally
To r o n t o, one of the wo r l d ’s most multi-
ethnic cities, is a case in point.When the Board
of Education embarked on a school reform ,t h e
process was not locked in academic circles.I n s-
t e a d , some 7,000 individuals, from parents
and staff to business leaders ,NGOs and repre-
s e n t at i ves of the arts world turned up for full-
d ay consultations on how education should be
responding to the demands of a changi n g
wo r l d .W h at ,p a rticipants were asked, s h o u l d
students know,do and value by the time they
gr a d u ate from school? Rather than a narr ow set
of goals geared towards the wo r k p l a c e ,p a rt i-
cipants stressed concepts like responsible citi-
z e n s h i p, c ritical thinking, p e rsonal life skills,
values and actions.
According to Charles Hopkins, one of the
c o - o r d i n at o rs of the project,“if you were to read
all the answe rs that came in with sustainable
d e velopment eyeglasses and highlight eve ry
reference to the env i r o n m e n t , economic and
human deve l o p m e n t , the pages would have
leapt into colour.”As the curriculum guidelines
s t at e ,“ l e a rning must help students to conduct
their lives in ways that foster healthy social
and natural systems, both locally and glo-
b a l l y.”The environment is a theme ru n n i n g
across disciplines, from social studies to the
n atural sciences.Around such key concepts as
p owe r , time and change, students ascend from
the personal and the local to the global as they
come to grips with the multi-layered dimension
of issues and draw connections between them.
But bri n ging about changes in at t i t u d e s

d o e s n ’t happen through rote learn i n g . It start s
with building children’s sense of self-esteem,
since without, they are highly unlikely to feel
c o n c e rn towards others or their surr o u n-
d i n g s.T h e n ,t e a c h e rs must encourage initia-
t i ves that have a positive resonance in com-
m u n i t i e s. “ You cannot develop a cari n g
attitude towards one another and the env i-
ronment through listening to lectures,”s t r e s s e s
O. J. Sikes of the United Nations Fund for
Po p u l ation Activities (UNFPA ) . “The tea-
ching has to be part i c i p at o ry.”Training is cri-
t i c a l , and when it is lacking, the whole endea-
vour is compromised. In many countries of
francophone A f ri c a , lack of sufficient funds to
p rint mat e rials and provide on-the-job teacher
training is stalling the spread of sustainable
d e velopment messages. W h at ’s more, s i n c e
c h a n ging habits and attitudes does not stop
when the school day ends, s u p p o rt from the
community is essential in making pro-
grammes a success. In the end, one of yo u t h ’s
first tasks might indeed be to question and
perhaps alter the attitudes of their own peers.
