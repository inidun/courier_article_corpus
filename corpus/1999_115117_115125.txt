A new deal for the poor
Whose fault is it that economic growth has been accompanied by increasing
poverty in one of the world’s poorest countries?

Most of the poor 
scrape a living in the informal
economy.
The wo rl d ’s thre e
ri chest people have
assets that exceed the
combined gro s s
domestic product of
the 48 least deve l o p e d
c o u n t ri e s.

In the last few ye a rs ,M a l i ’s economic gr owth rat e
has picked up,but most Malians have n ’t noticed the
b e n e fit s.“ I t ’s gr owth without jobs,d e velopment or
f r e e d o m ,”s ays A m i n ata D.Tr a o r é , a psychosociologi s t ,
bu s i n e s swoman and decorat i ve artist who is Mali’s
minister of culture and touri s m .“Macroeconomic per-
f o rmance is being achieved at the cost of the basic and
urgent needs of most of the populat i o n ,” she say s.
M a l i ’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on ave-
rage by five per cent a year between 1994 and 1996,
and pove rty by two per cent a ye a r , according to a
r e p o rt by the country ’s Observat o ry for Sustainable
Human Development and the Struggle against Pove rt y
(ODHD) published in July 1998. The new poor,
Traoré say s , “are people who’ve lost their jobs and
those who’ve never had a job”—people who’ve been
laid off from state bodies regarded as ove rs t a f f e d ,a n d
young people without a job.Most of them gr av i t ate to
the informal economy, where taxes are not paid and
figures are unava i l a b l e .“Without this sector the situa-
tion would be explosive ,” according to Tr a o r é .
To d ay, 72 per cent of of Mali’s 9.2 million popu-
l ation live below the pove rty line, i . e . on barely $180
a year (less than 50 cents a day ) , according to ODHD.
The indicat o rs present a grim picture. One third of
Malians cannot expect to live to the age of 40;a l m o s t
f o u r - fifths are illiterat e ; over half lack clean wat e r
s u p p l i e s ; and two-thirds have no access to health ser-
v i c e s.Half the children under five suffer from chronic
m a l n u t ri t i o n , as against 35 per cent in 1988. T h e
only bright spot is a slow d own in the rate at which
p ove rty is spreading. B e t ween 1989 and 1994, t h e
number of people living below the pove rty line rose
by 11 per cent a ye a r , as against two per cent since.
Traoré believes that the World Bank and the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund bear considerable responsi-
bility for deteri o r ating living conditions. In a recently
published book, L’ E t a u (Actes Sud publishers , Pa ri s ,
1 9 9 9 ) , she claims for her country the right to shape its
own destiny. For several ye a rs , “decisions have been
taken without the Malians, and for most of the time
without their even being aware of the fa c t , and this is
bound to jeopardize chances of consolidating the
d e m o c r at i z ation process,”she laments.“The needy are
hardest hit by measures imposed on A f ri c a ’s ove ri n-
debted countri e s. These measures also discredit the
s t at e ,which is called on to withdraw from such vital sec-
t o rs as educat i o n ,h e a l t h , water supply and sanitat i o n .
In short , social we l fare has to be pri vatized so that the
s t ate can meet its commitments to its creditors.”
Bad management
She believes that these reforms aim to consoli-
d ate the power of the wo r l d ’s ruling elite.“Their pur-
pose is to create more opportunities for the powe r f u l
and they extend control of our minds as well as our
r aw mat e rials by the rich countri e s.” She also
b e l i e ves that they undermine state efforts to improve
the situation of the depri ve d .At the end of 1994, t h e
Malian gove rnment decided to focus on sustai-
nable development and the struggle against pove rt y,
drawing up a “national strategy”in 1997. But this
“laudable option” will fail if the Intern ational Mone-
t a ry Fund and the World Bank continue to follow the
same approach, Traoré believe s. “Under adjust-
ment policies the state has ve ry little room for
m a n o e u v r e . Each dossier—employ m e n t , yo u t h ,
wo m e n , h e a l t h , e d u c at i o n , the env i r o n m e n t —
requires money that is not locally ava i l a b l e . To
obtain finance from funding bodies means sub-
mitting to conditions that are supposed to improve
management and productivity. These conditions
are actually counter-productive: low wages are a
d i s i n c e n t i ve to wo r k e rs ,p e rp e t u ate bad management
and spawn unrest and political instability.”
Traoré does not deny the responsibility of
A f rican states in the bankru p t cy of their econo-
mies. “I don’t say there isn’t corruption. . . . But I
plead for the sharing of responsibility. Most of the
decisions that have been taken in Africa have been
the result of advice, guidance, and in some cases
constraint. Now we must be lucid, rigorous, and
demanding both on ourselves and on those who
claim to help us.” n
