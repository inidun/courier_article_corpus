nate one night in 1922, more than 
200 bandits advance single file in the 
darkness. They have just abducted 
the 23 pupils and headmaster of the 
Chikan village school and they are 
leading them back to their hideout. 
Their route takes them past the vil-
lage of Yingcun, dominated by the 
Hongyi Lou, a diaolou built by Chi-
nese émigrés on their return from the 
United States for the protection of 
their families. They stored their weap-
ons in it and installed an electric gen-
erator and an alarm siren, brought 
back from overseas. 
As soon as the sun sets, men stand 
guard at the top of the fortified tower, 
where villagers sleep. That night they 
spot odd, furtive shadows. Imme-
diately they turn on the searchlight, 
sound the alarm…The petrified ban-
dits are trapped in the glare and din 
of these unknown devices. From the 

top of the diaolou, the guards open 
fire. Panic ensues. Several bandits 
are shot; others head for the hills, 
while some of the prisoners flee. 
The villagers capture 12 bandits and 
save 17 pupils and the headmaster. 
Word of this exploit spreads far and 
wide. Now every town wants its own 
diaolou.
Secular guardians
Today, some 20 diaolou in 
the sub-prefecture of Kaiping 
are inscribed on the World 
Heritage List. Two hours from 
Canton, Guangdong’s capital, 
and four hours by boat from 
Hong Kong, Kaiping is in a 
remote corner of the province. 
Its diaolou stick up in the back-
ground of villages, in green 
groves of bamboo or banana 
trees. Some loom above the 
rice paddies, on top of small 
mounds. They take various 
forms: castle keeps capped 
with crenellations and em-
brasures, ornately decorated 
belfries, finely sculpted tow-
ers. Some are made of stone, 
some in pise (compressed 
earth) and others in brick, like 
the Yinglong Lou, the oldest of the 
diaolou still standing from the 16th 
century. Most, however, were built 
out of reinforced concrete between 
1920 and 1930 and comprise four 
or five storeys. A distinguishing char-
acteristic is their blend of Chinese 
and western architectural elements. 
The diaolou were used for defence 
in times of upheaval. They flourished 
particularly in the late Qing dynasty 
(1644-1911), when countless local 
wars ravaged China – the bloody 
Taiping rebellion (1851-1864) to cite 
but one – and during what is known 
as the Warlord period, when power-
hungry military leaders wreaked hav-
oc in the country, between 1916 and 
1926.
Double-Happiness 
and Acanthus leaves
But dangerous times are not the 
only explanation for the profusion 
of diaolou. Their construction was 
financed by émigrés. At the end of 
the 19th and beginning of the 20th 
century, Kaiping was a centre of Chi-
nese emigration. Many of its citizens 
worked as coolies (the name given 
to Chinese economic immigrants) in 
Southeast Asian mines and planta-
tions, participated in the California 
gold rush and railroad construction 
across the American continent, or 
opened laundries, restaurants and 
shops. 
Returning home, they introduced 
the extraordinary composite architec-
ture of the diaolou, which melds, for 
instance, auspicious Chinese motifs 
like the Double-Happiness symbol 
with acanthus leaves or classical col-
onnades from the west. 
They also imported cement and 
steel into the region, which turned out 
to have a determining impact on this 
unusual architectural style, with rein-
forced concrete making cantilevered 
construction possible and facilitat-
ing domes and other rounded forms. 
This was a great novelty. Incidentally, 
the expression “upside-down wok” is 
used in Chinese literature of the time 
to designate a cupola. 
A matter  
of prestige 
The diaolou represented pres-
tige. They were status sym-
bols, flaunting the prosper-
ity and power of their owners, 
who consequently spent lavish 
sums on them. Some of the 
towers belonged to a single 
family and were used as resi-
dences. Others were funded 
by a village or several families, 
with everyone getting a small 
room in which to store valu-
ables or take refuge in case 
of danger. And some – like 
the Fang Clan watch tower 
near Zili - were lookout points, 
erected in strategic places on 
the outskirts of villages. 
The diaolou built by commu-
nities were often named after 
the village or the traditional chieftain, 
while others were described by their 
function. Once the name was cho-
sen, renowned artists were called in 
to trace the characters in calligraphy, 
which were then carved or moulded 
and displayed at the top of the main 
façade. The inscription adorning Rui-
shi Lou, a nine-storey diaolou in the 
village of Jinjiangli, is the work of an 
abbot and celebrated calligrapher 
from Canton’s Temple of the Six Ban-
yan Trees. 
Most of these diaolou are aban-
doned today, but nothing about their 
appearance evokes desolation. At 
nightfall, their sombre silhouettes 
stand at attention above the houses 
and continue to watch over the vil-
lages of Kaiping.

French Sinologist, 
is currently working on a book 
on the Kaiping region.
