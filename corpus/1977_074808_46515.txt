HIDDEN DYNAMOS
OF NEPTUNE'S
POWERHOUSE
eddies in mid ocean may generate far more
power than major currents like the Gulf Stream
by Konstantin N. Fedorov
ONE of the most important
developments in modern ocea¬
nography is the study of the
many ways in which the ocean trans¬
forms its energy. This research has
recently been given new impetus by
the remarkable discovery that a tre¬
mendous amount of the energy in
the oceans comes from mid-ocean
eddies that break off from the major
currents.
How does the ocean work? Solar
energy is constantly being pumped
into the ocean, which swallows it up,
stores it away and then redistributes
it as it circulates over the globe. And
this indeed is how the ocean "works".
The energy supplied by the Sun,
either directly or through the atmo¬
spheric movements which we call
winds, keeps the ocean permanently
moving. The best known of the
ocean's movements are the currents
and waves; these were the elements
most familiar to every seafarer from
the earliest days of human history.
Scientists of the past have tried to
trace, describe and chart the ocean
currents, hoping that one day the
picture would be complete and would
greatly facilitate navigation and wea¬
ther forecasting.
But it was not plain sailing. The
currents proved to be capricious
creatures, and displayed- not only
seasonal or tidal variations which
were relatively easy to track and to
predict, but many others, which

were as unexpected as they were
unpredictable.
A wide spectrum of variability was
soon discovered, and this did not fit
any traditional concept of yesterday's
"DC-oceanography", as it was descri¬
bed at the 1976 Joint Océanographie
Assembly in Edinburgh by Prof. Walter
Munk, the well-known American geo-
physicist (see article page 16).
But even "AC-oceanography"
would not be an appropriate descrip¬
tion of the approach to adopt, since
the variability involved is in fact far
more complicated than the harmoni¬
cally oscillating voltage of a domestic
electrical plug.
This variability puzzled oceanogra¬
phers for many years. The changes
affected not only currents but temp¬
erature, salinity, sound velocity, and
many other physical features of the
ocean environment. Why was Nature
so fickle ?
The scientists decided to go to sea
themselves and measure all these
parameters over as long a period as
possible in one and the same spot,
in order to see how long it would
take to determine mean or average
values which would not change
however many times they repeated
the same series of measurements.
The pioneering work by the scien¬
tific team under Prof. V. B. Stockmann
of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences,
which began as long ago as 1956
on the Black Sea, was continued in
1958 in the North Atlantic" and in
1967 in the Indian Ocean, but it was
only in 1970, when a large-scale
multi-ship and multi-buoy experiment
was mounted by the U.S.S.R. in the
tropical northeastern Atlantic, that
their efforts were successful.
This experiment was called "POLY-
GON-70" after the Russian word
which means "proving ground", and
oceanographers from the U.S.A.,
the Federal Republic of Germany,
the German Democratic Republic and
Canada joined the Soviet scientists
for a time on the research vessel
Akademik Kurchatov.
The experiment lasted for almost
seven months, and observations
revealed something new and totally
unexpected for many, suspected
by some, but definitely never seen
before by anyone. The widely spread
"net" of surface-floats fitted with
current meters in fact "caught" a
gigantic eddy, and registered data
which made it possible to plot the
course of what seemed to be an
uncommon type of ocean movement.
The eddy was elliptical in shape;
it measured about 400 km along its
longer axis, and drifted slowly west¬
ward at a speed of 4-6 centimetres
per second. Water inside the eddy
was swirling in a clockwise direction
at speeds of up to 50 cm/sec. A few
years earlier, in 1957 and 1959-60,
American and British scientists using
neutral buoyancy floats, invented
by a British oceanographer, John
Swallow, from the research vessel
Aries in the Atlantic Ocean had disco¬



vered unusual variations in currents |
deep below the surface. In the light I
25

of Polygon's findings, their discovery
took on a new meaning.
Gradually the scientists came to
understand that the kinetic energy of
an eddy may greatly exceed the kin¬
etic energy of the general current.
This state of affairs was quite new to
the oceanographers, although it was
by no means unfamiliar to meteoro¬
logists, who were accustomed to the
strong and variable winds of cyclonic
and anticyclonic disturbances con¬
tained within relatively slow-moving
westerly airstreams over a wide span
of moderate latitudes.
The discovery posed a thousand
new questions to the scientists.
Where did the ocean eddies get their
energy? Did they feed on the mean
flow, profiting from its variability?
Or were they, on the contrary, sup¬
plying energy to the mean flow ? If
so, were they themselves the product
of atmospheric disturbances? Were
the mountains at the bottom of the
sea somehow responsible for their
birth? Hew many eddies were there
in the ocean?
To answer these and many other
questions, a new expedition, called
MODE-1 (Mid-Ocean Dynamic Expe¬
riment), was organized in 1973, this
time by American scientists, with
colleagues from the U.S.S.R., the
United Kingdom and France. Avery
complex network of instruments was
deployed for a period of several
months in the area of the western
Atlantic known as the Sargasso Sea.
As a result, more eddies were spotted
and described, and a vast number of
measurements were taken to obtain
data concerning their dynamics.
One of the most remarkable techni¬
cal achievements of the Mode-1
experiment was the wide use of the
so-called SOFAR (Sound Fixing and
Ranging) floatsfreely drifting deep
water acoustic devices which could
be tracked by shorebased stations
with a high degree of accuracy at
distances of thousands of sea miles.
Twenty such SOFAR floats were
released at a depth of 1,500 m. and
many of them were still being tracked
late in 1975.
With the development of remote-
sensing techniques and of high reso¬
lution infra-red radiometers in parti¬
cular, it has become possible to
observe the variability and tempera¬
ture of ocean currents from earth
satellites. The most striking pictures
obtained in this way are those which
show the "banks" of the Gulf Stream
and the eddies, or "rings", produced
in the course of its slow meanderings.
From the data provided by Polygon,
Mode and other observations a new
picture was emerging of an ocean
more or less densely packed with
eddies measuring between 100 km.
and 200 km. in diameter, and all
moving slowly in a westerly direction.
Why is it so important to know
about these eddies ? Why are whole
fleets of océanographie vessels, valu
able scientific instruments and hun¬
dreds of scientists and technicians
now being mobilized in this investiga¬
tion? Here we come back once again
to our original question, how does the
ocean work? It is precisely because
the ocean's "work" affects our every¬
day life so much that we cannot
afford to ignore the niceties of its
behaviour.
What interests us most of all is
the process of heat exchange. It is
commonly believed that the atmo¬
sphere "drives" the ocean, and al¬
though this is indeed true in many
respects, the feedback from the ocean
into the atmosphere is in some cases
so strong that it determines to a
great extent the weather and climate
over vast areas of dry land.
Consider for a moment that the
mass of the ocean is approximately
300 times greater than that of the
atmosphere over the same surface
area. It follows, with the difference
in heat capacities taken into account,
that the heat stored by the entire
atmosphere is equivalent to the heat'
contained in just the top three metres
of water in the ocean.
The transfer of heat from one place
to another by ocean currents is a
complicated enough matter. But
suppose the eddies also take part
in the process, as in fact they do !
If we have not yet even learned to
predict the transfer of heat by ocean
currents, how can we begin to predict
the heat effect of ocean eddies ?
One way in which scientists are
trying to improve their forecasting
capacities is by constructing mathe¬
matical models of general ocean
circulation so that computers can be
set to work in resolving the hydro-
dynamic and thermodynamic equa¬
tions which describe the conservation
of energy momentum and heat in the
ocean.
Theoreticians have already been
able to model the oceanic eddy field
with the aid of powerful computers,
and new models of general circula¬
tion are also being developed which
include the movements of eddies.
Lessons from the distant geological
past of our planet can also help
in the development of forecasting
methods. As the Assembly in Edin¬
burgh pointed out, paleo-oceanogra-
phythe science of the ancient ocean
one of the most fascinating and
dynamically developing branches of
modern marine science.
By combining evidence from geo¬
logy, geomorphology, sedimentology,
micropaleontology, modern plate tec¬
tonics, marine physics, chemistry,,
biology and biochemistry, scientists
are now able to reconstruct reliable
pictures of the World Ocean as it
was during different stages of the
creation of the earth.
These pictures show us that its
general circulation was very different
from what we see today, and that
the patterns changed with the climate


of our planet, and with the shape of
the oceans themselves. This know¬
ledge in its turn enables us to cons¬
truct mathematical models of the
prehistoric climates of the earth, and
to check their accuracy with the
information provided by paleobotany
and paleontology.
None of this, however, reduces the
need for more information from the
ocean itself. New observations are
required to answer the steadily increa¬
sing mass of questions and to prove
or disprove hypotheses. New mea¬
surements are required to provide
data for new theoretical models and
new hypotheses. This is the way
science works.
Today, a new oceanic experiment is
26

getting under way. This time, it is
a Soviet-American venture called
POLYMODE (a marriage of Polygon
and Mode), designed to provide us
with more information about ocean
eddies and their role in the ocean's
internal dynamics. Various elements
of the experiment will cover most of
the western Atlantic, while in parts
of the eastern Atlantic scientists from
the United Kingdom, France and the
Federal Republic of Germany are
setting up their own observation
networks.
One of Polymode's tasks will be
to find out how uniformly eddy energy
is distributed over the ocean. There
is already evidence that in . some
parts of the ocean eddies appear
more frequently and contain more
energy than in others.
Polymode will operate throughout
1977 and 1978. Will it dispel the
mystery of ocean eddies once and
for all ? Certainly not, but the co¬
operation of scientists from different
countries will continue, and this is
one of the most hopeful signs of the
times we live in. The ocean's store¬
house must be opened for all mankind.
