The important place 
social anthropology 
holds in the contempo-
rary thinking may seem 
paradoxical to many 
people. It is a science 
very much in vogue: 
witness not only the 
fashion for f ilms and 
books about travel, but 
also the interest of the 
educated public in 
books on anthropology. 
Towards the end of 
the 19th century people 
were apt to look to the 
biologist in their quest 
for a philosophy of man 
and the world, and then 
later to the sociologist, the histo-
rian, and even the philosopher. 
But for the past several years, 
anthropology has come to play 
the same role, and today it too is 
expected to provide us with deep 
reflections on our world and a 
philosophy of life and hope. 
It is in the United States that 
this approach to anthropology 
seems to have begun. As a young 
nation intent on creating a huma-
nism of its own, America broke 
with traditional European thin-
king. It saw no reason why the

At the time when African countries were gaining their independence, it seemed anthropology 
was about to fall victim to a dual conspiracy, fostered by the people hostile to it and those 
becoming extinct. What is the role of antropology in the modern world? Lévi-Strauss replies

civilizations of Greece and Rome 
should be admired to the exclu-
sion of all others merely because 
in the Old Wor ld of the 
Renaissance, when mankind came 
to be considered the most proper 
and necessary study of man, these 
were the only two civilizations 
sufficiently known. 
Since the 19th century and 
especially the 20th, practically 
every human society on our planet 
has become accessible to study. 
Why then limit our interests? And 
indeed, when we contemplate 
humanity in its entirety we cannot 
fail to recognize the fact that for 
99/100ths of mankind’s existence, 
and over most of the inhabited 
globe, there have been no cus-
toms, no beliefs, and no institu-
tions which do not fall within the 
prov ince of anthropological 
study. 
This was strikingly emphasised 
during the last war with the strug-
gle waged on a world-wide scale. 
Even the most obscure and remote 
corners of our planet were sud-
denly catapulted into our lives

tive” way of life, “primitive” thin-
king and “primitive” behaviour 
which have always been the sub-
ject of anthropological research. 
Without our realizing it, the “pri-
mitive” ways are transforming 
these civilizations from within. 
For the so-called primitive or 
archaic peoples do not simply 
vanish into a vacuum. They dis-
solve and are incorporated with a 
greater or lesser speed into the 
civilization surrounding them. At 
the same time the latter acquires 
a universal character.
Anthropology:  
a science without  
an object? 
Thus, far from diminishing in 
importance, primitive peoples 
concern us more with each passing 
day. To take only one example, the 
great civilization the West is justly 
proud of, and which has spread its 
roots across the inhabited globe, 
is everywhere emerging as a 
“hybrid”. Many foreign elements, 
both spiritual and material, are 
being absorbed into its stream. 
As a result, the problems of 
anthropology have ceased to be a 
matter for specialists, limited to 
scholars and explorers; they have 
become the direct and immediate 
concern of every one of us. 
Where then, lies the paradox? 
In reality there are two –insofar 
as anthropology is chiefly concer-
ned with the study of “primitive” 
peoples. At the moment when the 
public has come to recognize its 
true value, we may well ask 
whether it has   …
For even societies with the 
most widely divergent patterns of 
thought and whose customs and 
mores took thousands of years to 
evolve along isolated paths, 
impregnate one another once 
contact is established. This occurs 
in many, devious ways; sometimes 
we are clearly aware of them, 
often we are not. 
As they spread throughout the 
world, the civilizations which 
(rightly or wrongly) felt that they 
had reached the height of develo-
pment, such as Christianity, 
Islamism, Buddhism, and on a dif-
ferent level the technological 
civilization that unites them, 
become tinged with the “primi-
… took on three-dimensional 
reality. These were the lands where 
the last “savage” peoples on earth 
had sought safety in isolation – 
the far north of America, New 
Guinea, the hinterlands of south-
east Asia, and certain islands in 
the Indonesian archipelago.
Shrinking world
Since the war, many names, once 
charged w ith myster y and 
romance, have remained on our 
maps but now they designate 
landing spots for long-distance 
jet liners. Under the impact of 
aviation and with increase in 
world population, our planet has 
shrunk in size, and improved 
communications and travel faci-
lities permit us no longer to 
close our eyes or remain indiffe-
rent to other peoples. 
Today there is no fraction of 
the human race, no matter how 
remote and retarded it may still 
appear, which is not directly or 
indirectly in contact with others, 
and whose feelings, ambitions, 
desires and fears do not affect the 
security and prosperity and the 
very existence of those to whom 
material progress may once have 
given a feeling of ascendancy. 
Even if we wanted to, we could 
no longer ignore or shrug off with 
indifference, say, the last head-
hunters of New Guinea, for the 
simple reason that they are inte-
rested in us. And surprising 
though it may be, the result of 
our contacts with them means 
that both they and we are now 
part of the same world, and it will 
not be long before we are all part 
of the same civilization.

years ago, are now providing 
labour contingents for the buil-
ding of roads. And it is no rarity 
today to see road signs and 
milestones parachuted into the 
unexplored jungle! 
But with civilization have come 
strange diseases, against which 
“primitives” have no natural 
 immunization and which have 
wrought deadly havoc in their 
ranks. They are succumbing rapidly 
to tuberculosis, malaria, trachoma, 
leprosy, dysentery, gonorrhoea, 
syphilis and the mysterious disease 
known as Kuru. The result of pri-
mitive man’s contact with civiliza-
t ion, though not ac tual ly 
introduced by it, Kuru is a genetic 
deterioration which inevitably 
ends in death and for which no 
treatment or remedy is known. 
In Brazil, 100 tribes became 
extinct between 1900 and 1950. 
The Kaingang, from the state of 
Sao Paulo,  …
bered 250,000 individuals. Today 
no more than 40,000 are left. 
Official reports describe them 
herded in reserves or clustered 
near mining centres where in the 
place of their traditional wild food 
gathering parties they are redu-
ced to sneak-scavenging in rub-
bish heaps outside the mining 
shacks. Other aborigines, who had 
retreated deep into the forbidden 
desert, have been uprooted by the 
installation of atomic explosion 
bases or rocket launching sites.
Protected by its exceptionally 
hostile environment, New Guinea 
with its several million tribesmen 
may well be the last great sanc-
tuary of primitive society on 
earth. 
But here too, civilization is 
making such rapid inroads that 
the 600,000 inhabitants of the 
central mountains who were 
totally unknown as mere twenty 
… not reached the point 
where it has nothing more left to 
study. 
For the very transformations 
which are spurring a growing 
theoretical interest in “primiti-
ves” are in fact bringing about 
their extinction. This is not 
really a new phenomenon. As 
early as 1908, when he inaugura-
t ed  the  cha i r  o f  Soc ia l 
Anthropology at the University 
of Liverpool, Sir James Frazer 
(author of the monumental 
Golden Bough) dramat ically 
called the attention of govern-
ments and scholars to this very 
problem. Yet we can hardly com-
pare the situation half a century 
ago with the large-scale extinc-
tion of “primitive” peoples which 
we have witnessed since then. 
Let me cite a few examples. At 
the beginning of white settlement 
in Australia, the aborigines num-

disorders, eye lesions and dental 
decay, unknown to primitive man 
when he lived according to his 
ancient ways, make 
their appearance when 
he is confined to villa-
ges and must eat food 
which does not come 
from his native forest. 
Then, even the old and 
tried traditional reme-
dies, such as charcoal 
dressings for severe 
burns, prove useless. 
And simple diseases to 
which tribesmen have 
long been accustomed, 
become extraordinary 
virulent. 
The decimation of 
the Indians is due to 
other, less direct causes, such as 
the collapse of the social struc-
ture or pattern of living. The 
Kaingang of Sao Paulo already 
mentioned, lived by a series of 
strict social rules with which 
every anthropologist is acquain-
ted. The inhabitants of each vil-
lage were divided into two groups 
on the principle that the men 
from the first group could marry 
only women from the second 
group and vice-versa. 
When their population dimi-
nished, the foundations permit-
ting their survival collapsed. 
Under the rigid system of the 
Kaingang, it was no longer possi-
ble for every man to find a wife 
and many had no choice but celi-
bacy unless they resigned them-
selves to mating within their own 
group – which to them was incest, 
and even then their marriage had 
to be childless. In such cases  …
Even water was lacking, and 
they were dying as much from 
hunger and thirst as from the 
disease. The children were craw-
ling about on the forest floor 
trying to keep the fires alight in 
the rain and hoping to keep warm. 
The men lay burning and paraly-
zed by fever; the women indiffe-
rently thrust away their babes 
seeking their breast.”
Indigenous 
superseded  
by indigent
In 1954, on the Guapore at the 
border of Brazil and Bolivia, a mis-
sion was established and four dif-
ferent tribes were incited to form 
a single group. For several months 
there were 400 people there, all of 
whom were exterminated by meas-
les shortly thereafter... 
But in addition to infectious 
diseases, vitamin and other nutri-
tional deficiencies are also an 
important problem. Motor-vascular 
… numbering 1,200 in 1912, 
were no more than 200 in 1916, 
and today have dwindled to 80. 
The Munduruku were 
20,000 in 1925 – in 1950 
they numbered 1,200. Of 
the 10,000 Nanmbikwara 
in 1900, I could trace only 
a thousand in 1940. The 
Kayapo of the r iver 
Araguaya were 2,500 in 
1902 and 10 in 1950. The 
Timbira 1,000 in 1900 and 
40 in 1950. 
How can this rapid 
decimation be explained? 
Foremost, by the intro-
duc t ion of  Wes te rn 
diseases against which 
the Indian’s body had no 
defence. The tragic fate of the 
Urubu, an Indian tr ibe from 
north-eastern Brazil, is typical of 
many others. In 1950, only a few 
years after they were discovered, 
they contracted the measles. 
Within a few days, out of the 
population of 750 there were 160 
deaths. An eyewitness has left 
this stark description: 
“We found the first village 
abandoned. All the inhabitants 
had fled, convinced that if they 
ran far away they would escape 
the sickness which they believed 
was a spirit attacking the village. 
We discovered them in the 
forest, halted in their flight. 
Exhausting and shivering with 
fever in the rain, nearly all of 
them had fallen victim to the 
disease. Intestinal and pulmonary 
complications had so weakened 
them that they no longer had 
strength to seek food.

Peoples who refuse 
to be the object of 
study
But this is only half of the pic-
ture. There are other parts of the 
world where tens and hundreds of 
millions of people live, who were 
tradit ionally the subject of 
anthropology. These populations 
are increasing rapidly in number 
in Central America, the Andes, 
south-east Asia and Africa. But 
here too, anthropology faces a 
crisis. Not because the popula-
tions are dying out  …

… a whole population can 
disappear within a few years. 
[These observations on the disap-
pearance of the Indians of Brazil 
are drawn chiefly from a study by 
the noted Brazilian anthropolo-
gist, Dr Darcy Ribeiro, entitled 
“Conviv io et Contaminaçao” 
published in “Sociologica”, Vol. 
XVIII, No. 1 Sao Paulo, 1956]. 
Bearing this in mind, need we 
be surprised that it is more diffi-
cult not only to study the so- 
called primitive peoples but even 
to define them satisfactorily. In 
recent years, a serious attempt 
has been made to revise existing 
thinking regarding protective 
legislation in the countries facing 
this problem. 
Neither language nor culture 
nor the conviction of belonging to 
a group, are valid as criteria for a 
definition. As enquiries of the 
International Labour Organization 
have emphasized, the notion of 
indigenous people is being super-
seded by the concept of indigence. 
[ILO, The Aboriginal populations. 
Geneva,1953].

social customs destroyed, to 
create sharper observation tech-
niques, rather like the astronomer 
who has brought electronic ampli-
fiers into play to capture the wea-
kening signals of light from 
distant stars racing away from 
us.
The second crisis in anthropo-
logy is much less serious in the 
absolute since there is no threat 
of extinction to the civilizations 
concerned. But it is much more 
difficult to deal with it out of 
hand. I wonder whether it would 
help matters if we tried to dispel 
the distrust of the people who 
were formerly the anthropologist’s 
field work by proposing that our 
research should henceforth no 
longer be “one way only”. Might 
not anthropology find its place 
again if, in exchange for our conti-
nued freedom to investigate, we 
invited African or Melanesian 
anthropologists to come and study 
us in the same way that up to now 
only we have studied them? 
Such an exchange would be 
very desirable for it would enrich 
the science of anthropology by 
w idening it s 
hor izons, and 
set us on the 
road to further 
progress. But let 
us have no illu-
sions- this would 
not resolve the 
problem, for it 
does not take 
into considera-
tion the deep 
motives under-
lying the former 
colonised peo-
ples  …
take advantage of the few years 
that remain to gather all the 
information we can on these 
vanishing islands of humanity. 
Such information is vital for, 
unlike the natural sciences, the 
sciences of man cannot originate 
their own experimentation. 
Every type of society, of belief 
or institution, every way of life, 
constitutes a ready-made experi-
ment for which preparation has 
taken thousands of years and as 
such is irreplaceable. When a 
community disappears, a door 
closes forever, locking away 
knowledge which is unique. 
That is why the anthropologist 
believes that it is essential, before 
these societies are lost and their 
… but because of the nature 
of the people involved. 
These peoples are changing and 
their civilizations are gradually 
becoming westernized Anthropo-
logy, however, has never yet inclu-
ded the West within its competence 
or province. Furthermore, and 
even more important, there is a 
growing opposition in these 
regions to anthropological enqui-
ries. Instances have occurred 
where regional museums of 
“Anthro-pology” have been forced 
to change their names and can 
only continue disguised as 
“Museums of Popular Art and 
Tradition”. 
In the young states which have 
recently obtained independence, 
economists, psychologists and 
sociologists are warmly welcomed 
by universities. The same can 
hardly be said of anthropologists. 
Thus it would almost seem that 
anthropology is on the point of 
falling victim to a dual conspi-
racy. On the one hand are the 
peoples who have ceased physi-
cally to lend themselves to study 
but are simply vanishing 
from the face of the 
earth. On the other are 
those who, far from 
dead, are living a great 
population “explosion”, 
yet are categorically 
hostile to anthropology 
for psychological and 
ethical reasons. 
There is no problem 
about how to meet the 
first of these crises. 
Research must be spee-
ded up and we must

that logically and morally, it is 
almost impossible to continue to 
v iew societies as scientif ic 
objects, which the scientists may 
even wish to preserve, but which 
are now collective subjects and 
claim the right to change as they 
please. 
The modification of 
anthropology’s subject 
matter also implies modi-
fications in its aims and 
methods. And these for-
tunately appear quite 
feasible for our branch of 
science has never defi-
ned its purposes in the 
absolute but rather as a 
relationship between the 
observer and his subject. 
And it has always agreed 
to change whenever this 
relationship has been 
modified. 
Doubtless, the pro-
perty of anthropology 
has always been to inves-
tigate on the spot of “from 
within”. But only because it was 
impossible to investigate at a dis-
tance or “from without”. In the 
field of the social sciences, the 
great revolution of our times is 
that whole civilizations have 
become conscious of their exis-
tence, and having acquired the 
necessary means to do so through 
literacy, have embarked on the 
study of their own past and tradi-
tions and every unique aspect of 
their culture which has survived 
to the present day. 
Thus, if Africa, for instance, is 
escaping from anthropology, it 
will not so easily escape from 
science. In place  …
Yet these very anthropologists 
–and indeed all anthropology– are 
now accused of denying this infe-
riority merely to conceal it, and 
hence of contributing more or less 
direc t ly to it s  cont inued 
existence.
Science  
“from without”, 
anthropology 
becoming science 
“from within”
If therefore, anthropology is to 
survive in the modern world, 
there can be no disguising that it 
must be at the price of much 
deeper change than a mere enlar-
ging of the circle (very restricted 
it is true up to now) by the rather 
childish formula of offering to 
lend our toys to the newcomers 
provided they let us go on playing 
with theirs. 
Anthropology must transform 
its very nature and must admit 
… negative attitude to 
anthropology. They are afraid that 
under the cloak of an anthropolo-
gical interpretation of history 
what they consider to be intolera-
ble inequality will be justified as 
the des irable divers it y  of 
mankind. 
If I may be per-
mitted a formula 
which, coming from 
an anthropologist, 
can have no dero-
gatory connotation 
even as pure scien-
tific observation, I 
would say that 
Westerners w il l 
never (except in 
make believe) be 
able to act the role 
of “savages” oppo-
site those whom 
they once domina-
ted. For when we 
Westerners cast 
them in this role 
they existed for us 
only as objects –whether for scien-
tific study or political and econo-
mic domination. Whereas we, who 
in their eyes are responsible for 
their past fate, now appear to 
them inevitably as directing forces 
and therefore it is much harder or 
them to look at us with an atti-
tude of detached appraisal. 
By a curious paradox, it was 
undoubtedly a feeling of sympa-
thy that prompted many anthro-
pologists to adopt the idea of 
pluralism (this asserts the diver-
sity of human cultures and conco-
mitantly denies that certain 
civilizations can be classified as 
“super ior ”  and other s  as 
“inferior”)

Who knows if the 
conflict between the old 
and new generations, 
which so many countries 
are now experiencing, 
may not be the ransom 
that must be paid for the 
growing homogenization 
of our social and material 
culture? Such phenomena 
seem to me pathological 
but anthropology has 
always been characterized 
by its ability to explain 
and just if y forms of 
human behaviour which 
men found strange and 
could not understand. 
In this way anthropo-
logy at every phase has 
helped to enlarge the cur-
rently held and always too 
constricting view of humanity. To 
picture the disappearance of 
anthropology, one would have to 
conjure up a civilization where all 
men – no matter what corner of 
the globe they inhabited, and 
 whatever their way of life, their 
education, their professional acti-
vities, their ages, beliefs, sympa-
thies and aversions – were, to the 
very roots of their consciousness, 
totally intelligible to all other 
men. 
Whether one deplores it, 
 approves it, or merely states it as a 
fact, technical progress and the 
development of communications 
hardly seem to be leading us to this 
end. And as long as the ways of 
 thinking or of acting of some men 
perplex other men, there will be 
scope for meditation on these dif-
ferences; and this, in a constantly 
renewing form, will be the abiding 
province of anthropology.  
our last fields of investigation, in 
place of the weapons, tools and 
household objects which have 
disappeared. But also because as 
Western civilization becomes more 
complex with each passing day 
and spreads across the whole of 
the earth, it is already beginning 
to show signs of the sharp diffe-
rences which anthropology has 
made it its business to study but 
which it could formerly do only by 
comparing dissimilar and widely 
separated cultures. 
Here no doubt, lies the perma-
nent function of anthropology. 
For if there exists, as anthropolo-
gists have always affirmed, a cer-
tain “optimum diversity” which 
they see as a permanent condition 
of human development, then we 
may be sure that divergences 
between societies and groups 
within societies will disappear 
only to spring up in other forms. 
… of the anthropolo-
gist – that is the outside 
analyst, working from the 
outside – study of the conti-
nent will be in the hands of 
African scientists, or forei-
gners who will use the same 
methods as their African 
colleagues. 
They will no longer be 
anthropologists but linguists, 
philologists, historians of 
facts and ideas. Anthropology 
will gladly accept this transi-
tion to richer, more subtle 
methods than its own, confi-
dent that it has fulfilled its 
mission by keeping alive so 
much of the great riches of 
humanity on behalf of scien-
tific knowledge, so long as it 
was the only branch of 
science able to do so.
Diversity, 
anthropology’s  
reason for being
As to the future of anthropology 
itself, it seems to lie now at the 
far extreme and the near extreme 
of its traditional positions. At the 
far extreme, in the geographical 
sense first, since we must go fur-
ther and further afield to reach 
the last of the so-called primitive 
populations, and they are getting 
fewer and fewer; but in the far 
extreme in its logical meaning 
too, since we are now interested 
in the essentials. 
On the near extreme, in the 
sense that the collapse of the 
material foundations of the last 
primitive civilizations has made 
their intimate experiences one of
