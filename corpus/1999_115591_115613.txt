In the centre of A l e x a n d ri a , b e t we e n
the eastern port and the unive rs i t y, a
thousand labourers are working night
and day on a huge construction site with
four big cranes. The cylindrical 11-storey
building being built there in the middle of
a lake has been designed by a firm of Nor-
we gian architects, S n ø h e t t a , which won an
i n t e rn ational competition in 1989 that
drew 1,400 entries from 77 countries. Its
circular shape is meant to conjure up,
against the backcloth of the Mediterr a n e a n ,
the image of  “a lighthouse of know l e d g e
re-emerging in a perpetual sunrise”,in the
words of the project’s director-general,
Prof. Mohsen Zahran.
The bu i l d i n g, which should be fin i s h e d
by autumn 1999, will revive the legendary
Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA).Its promo-
t e rs hope that , with the help of the best
m o d e rn technology, it will spread the intel-
lectual influence of A l e x a n d ria throughout
the Arab world and beyond much more
e f f e c t i vely than its predecessor did at the
time of Caesar and Cleopatra.
The 36,770-square-metre library will
s e at 2,000 people and have up to eight mil-
lion books, p e ri o d i c a l s ,m a n u s c ri p t s ,m i c r o-
films and CD-RO M s. Its computeri z e d
c at a l o g u e , which France is helping to bu i l d ,
will be one of the most advanced in the
world and available in A r a b i c, English and
F r e n c h . Its planetari u m , its Intern at i o n a l
School of Inform ation Studies and its
museums of archaeology, c a l l i gr a p hy and
science are expected to attract students,
s c h o l a rs and visitors from all over the wo r l d .
Books
for a wide public
The idea of reviving the library wa s
born in 1974, when Cambridge-educated
M o s t a fa el-Abbadi, a history professor and
author of a study on the  “Life and Fate of
the Ancient Library of A l e x a n d ri a ” d r e a-
med of resuscitating the “temple of lear-
n i n g ” he had spent so many ye a rs studying.
The president of A l e x a n d ria Unive rs i t y, D r
Lutfi Dow i d a r , backed him and together
they won the support of the Egyptian
government and UNESCO, which funded a
feasibility study and an Internet we b s i t e
(www.bibalex.gov.eg).
El-Abbadi is fairly happy with the way
things have turned out, though he wo u l d
prefer the BA to be just a place for scholars.
It will open its doors to a far wider public,
h owe ve r. “ We don’t want books without
r e a d e rs ,” s ays the writer Gamal el-Ghat a n i ,
editor of Akhbar al-Adab, the weekly lite-
r a ry supplement of the big Cairo daily
newspaper A l - A k h b a r. “Unlike my son, I
d o n ’t know how to use a computer,” h e
c o n f e s s e s.“The A l e x a n d ria Library is being
built for his generation, not mine, but the
public will enjoy it as much as I enjoye d
going to the old national library.”
At the entrance to the building site
stands a slab of A swan granite bearing an
Egyptian hieroglyph, a Chinese ideogr a m ,
an Arabic letter and a Greek “ e ” .The mes-
sage of the granite blocks which make up
the outer walls of the building is clear: t h e
l i b r a ry aims to be a crossroads of alphabets,
words and languages, like the city where it is
l o c at e d . A r c h a e o l o gical digs at the site—a
f o rmer unive rsity car park where work began
in May 1995, s e ven ye a rs after Egyptian Pre-
sident Hosni Mubarak and UN E S C O Di r e c-
t o r -General Fe d e rico Mayor laid the foun-
d ation stone—have shown that it used to be
p a rt of the royal neighbourhood.But no one
k n ows exactly where the old library stood or
w h at it looked like.

A project costing over $170 million.

The rebirth of the BA has been enthu-
siastically welcomed abroad. G e rm a ny is
supplying equipment to move documents
and Italy a laborat o ry to restore manus-
c ri p t s. N o r way will provide furniture and
Japan audiovisual equipment. France will
d o n ate a copy of the archives of the old
Suez Canal Company, Turkey will gi ve
10,000 books and Australia will prov i d e
some works of art . About 300,000 books
have been collected so far, a third of them
donated.
A catapult
for development
Fo rmer UN E S C O D i r e c t o r - G e n e r a l
Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow launched a
world-wide appeal in 1987 for the library ’s
revival, saying it would transform the cul-
tural scene in the Middle East and the
c o u n t ries of the Maghreb.The UN E S C O f e a-
sibility study stressed this key role it could
play in the Mediterranean area.
This mission will probably be accompli-
s h e d , reckons project director Prof.Z a h r a n ,
who is a U.S.-trained Egyptian architect.T h e
BA could become “a catapult for the eco-
nomic and social development of Egypt,”h e
s ay s. “A country can have gr e at we a l t h , bu t
if it has no culture, it soon falls apart .” H e
predicts that the BA will become “a bridge of
u n d e rstanding and interaction between East
and We s t . Its revival will benefit humanity.
But we mustn’t think that the child will be a
prodigy from the moment of its birt h .We ’ l l
h ave to wait several decades before we can
see its real influ e n c e .”
E l - G h atani also hopes it will be a bri d g e
b e t ween Egypt and Europe, a continent he
sees as close because it shares the culture
and especially the religions of the Mediter-
ranean basin. “The roots of Europe’s
r e l i gions are right here,” he say s. T h e
A l e x a n d rian writer Edwar al-Kharr at
would like to see Alexandria become “the
capital of collective memory and a have n
for literary figures and scientists.”
More concretely, the BA will enable
E g y p t ’s young people—half the country ’s
p o p u l ation is under 20—to step up the pace
of their studies.According to Zahran, E g y p-
tian students sometimes take four years to
finish a doctorate—twice as long as stu-
dents in the West—because research mat e-
rial is hard to come by.
The first benefic i a ries of the BA will be
the 80,000 or so students at A l e x a n d ri a
U n i ve rs i t y, whose library only has 250,000
works (Egypt’s national library has 1.5 mil-
l i o n ) .S c h o l a rs from all over the Arab wo r l d
could come to A l e x a n d ria instead of or
before going to the United States or Bri-
t a i n . If the BA continues to attract the
attention of foreigners in this way, it will
play an important role.
By bri n ging back documents that we r e
s c attered through We s t e rn countries in the
19th century, the library will enable scho-

l a rs to compare the manuscripts in Egypt
with the copies that are being donated by
foreign benefa c t o rs. An example is the
m a n u s c ripts in the Escurial Palace in
S p a i n , which are a crucial part of Arab heri-
tage and copies of which have been made
for the new library. The BA could also
acquire more recent works which have been
taken out of the Arab wo r l d . The superb
l i t h o graphed books published in Fe z , i n
Morocco, in the 1920s can up to now only
be consulted at Harvard University, in the
U.S.,for example.
Support from
international donors
The BA is due to be officially opened at
the end of this year by President Mubarak,
who will be running for a fourth term of
o f fice in October.Will his opponents cri t i-
cize him for spending so much money on a
fa n cy library when half the country ’s adult
p o p u l ation cannot read or write? Egypt is

f orking out almost two-thirds of the $172
million cost of the building itself. P r o c e e d s
from an intern ational funding appeal, t o
which Arab countries have already generously
c o n t ri bu t e d ,will foot the rest of the bill.
Paradoxes
of the Arab world
“Of course it’s expensive ,” s ays El Gha-
tani,“but a library isn’t some kind of festi-
val that ends after three day s. It would have
cost even more if we’d waited another 30
years to build it.” Its worth should be seen
in terms of culture, not cash, and this, he
b e l i e ve s ,d r aws attention to one of the para-
d oxes of the Arab wo r l d . “The ri c h e s t
culture is in the poorest countri e s — I ’ m
thinking of Yemen—and the richest states
have the least interesting cultural material.
The ru l e rs of the rich states have bu i l t
palaces in Lausanne and Geneva instead
of libraries. But the age of the oil dollar is
coming to an end. We have to return to
more basic values,” he says.
Might the BA encourage democracy —
a concept that ori gi n ated in Greece—in
Egypt and the rest of the region? “ To bu i l d
a democratic stat e ,” s ays archaeologi s t
Ahmed Ahdel Fat t a h , director-general of
the Greco-Roman museum in A l e x a n d ri a ,
“ we need the tools of democracy, a n d
k n owledge is one of them. D e m o c r a cy isn’t
in such bad shape in Egypt, compared with
some of its neighbours. This of cours e
d o e s n ’t stop us saying that we don’t have
e n o u g h .Thank God I was born in Egypt. I
c o u l d n ’t publish my writings in a lot of
other Arab countri e s. n
The new library is set to open its doors before the year 2000.
