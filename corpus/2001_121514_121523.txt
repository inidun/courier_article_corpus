T here was a time when
Mohammad Reazuddin’s
paddies were being attacked
by pests and his yields
d e c l i n i n g, despite generous
use of pesticides and fertilizers.No longer.
These products are a thing of the past
and his harvests have improved.This 60-
y e a r-old father of seven, who lives in
Tangail district northwest of Dhaka,h a s
renewed confidence in the future.
Reazuddin is one of some 25,000
farmers around Bangladesh who have
joined the Nayakrishi A n d o l a n
m o v e m e n t .Created to help farmers after
the devastating floods of September
1 9 9 8 ,the movement not only advocates an alternative
method of farming—without pesticides or chemicals—
but also a more community-based approach that
draws on both traditional knowledge and scientific
i n n o v a t i o n s.
“ We insist that agriculture is not a factory or an
i n d u s t r y,” says Farhad Mazhar, a coordinator of
UBINIG (Po l i cy Research for Development
A l t e r n a t i v e s ) , the NGO that spearheaded the
movement.“Agriculture is a way of life, a cultural
p r a c t i c e. Our movement is about cultivating a
happier relationship with nature.”
For UBINIG, the extensive damage to crops
caused by the 1988 flood prompted a deeper
exploration of the agricultural crisis. In the early
1 9 9 0 s, the group carried out extensive research into
the impact of modern agriculture, introduced thirty
years earlier in Asia by the Green Revolution
through a package of chemical fertilizers,p e s t i c i d e s,
high-yielding seed varieties and irrigation water.
Their study pointed to declining soil fertility,a steady
increase in the use of fertilizers and a range of health
and nutrition problems.A decline in the quantity and
diversity of local fish populations was also reported,
while high-yielding rice varieties were failing to
produce the biomass needed to feed livestock.
The art of making good compost
and rotating crops
It is this whole ecological chain that Nayakrishi
Andolon is gradually trying to repair. Joining the
movement means adhering to a set of principles that
range from spurning pesticides, introducing mixed
cropping and crop rotation for soil fertility to
preserving seeds and genetic resources in farmers’
h a n d s.Winning adepts, h o w e v e r,has not always been
e a s y. “At the beginning, when workers from the
UB I N I G told us to grow crops without chemicals, w e
thought they were crazy,” recalls Rekha Begum,
from Kandapara village. “ They told us we could
make the soil fertile by using compost and taught us
how to prepare it in just over a month. Even though
the yield was a little below what others obtained by
using chemicals, when we calculated the cost of the
i n p u t s,we discovered we had more profit ,”she says.
From the start, the movement drew the poorest
of the country’s farmers, those with less than one

route to better health and control over seeds and genetic resources

quarter of a hectare of land who were desperate for
an alternative working method.To d a y,they make up
75 percent of its followers. They are the ones who
have been forced to sell land because they could no
longer afford the rising price of fertilizers and
p e s t i c i d e s. Rather than showing them model farms,
UB I N I G works directly with farmers in their fie l d s
along with running training programmes and
meetings in project areas.
Scientists and peasants:
a fruitful alliance
Farmers have learnt to improve soil quality by
reintroducing natural nutrients such as composts
made with water hyacinth. Sugarcane yields have
increased thanks to the cultivation of nitrogen-
fixing crops like lentils and beans.Besides rice, t h e y
have started to grow varieties of pulses,oil seeds and
cereals that were once part of the daily diet.
Indigenous paddy varieties have reappeared along
with uncultivated crops such as creepers, w h i c h
account for up to 40 percent of food supply in some
a r e a s. More fish varieties have resurfaced and
production has improved, giving families greater
food security. According to a study by the UN
Development Programme (UN D P) , l i v e s t o c k
population has increased by 100 to 200 percent and
cash income by 50 to 200 percent since Nayakrishi
practices were introduced. Mixed cropping was
found to be three times more productive than
monocultures.
Control over seeds is a lifeline for farming
c o m m u n i t i e s. Nayakrishi farmers are willing to use
“ h i g h - y i e l d ” varieties if they can collect and preserve
the seeds. Crop seeds are stored in community
centres located in every village. Farmers obtain
them free of cost at the time of sowing and must

return twice the amount unless their harvest is poor.
These community-run centres, an insurance against
damage to seedlings in case of bad weather, have
created strong bonds between farmers. Wo m e n ,
with their knowledge of seed preservation and
g e r m i n a t i o n , play a guiding role in running the
c e n t r e s. And biodiversity is flo u r i s h i n g : a central
Seed Wealth Centre counts an astonishing
collection:1,036 varieties of 356 species of cereals,
vegetables, fruits, trees, creepers and shrubs.
Against all odds, and with little national support,
farmers with slightly more land are starting to
acknowledge the economic viability of organic
f a r m i n g.The practices are being adopted by smaller
NGOs around the country while a network is being
set up in Nepal,India and Pakistan. “A significant
achievement lies in the links that have been forged
with agricultural scientists.The Nayakrishi practice
has been able to provoke critical reflection in
mainstream agricultural thought,”states the UN D P.
F u r t h e r m o r e,as the word on Nayakrishi spreads,
organic products are gaining a reputation for being
more nutritious and have started to earn higher
prices in local markets. Every year visitors flock to
a fair to get first-hand information about the
m o v e m e n t .According to UN D P,“the most important
i m p a c t ,apart from the ecological gains, has been to
engender confidence among the farming
c o m m u n i t i e s.”UB I N I G ’s coordinator Farhad Mazhar
is calling for more government involvement to
boost the movement, arguing that it can benefit
local families while also having major repercussions
a b r o a d . “Bangladesh is economically poor but
ecologically very rich,” he asserts, before claiming
with unbridled conviction:“If we can conserve and
develop this ecological wealth, we could feed
Europe.” ■
