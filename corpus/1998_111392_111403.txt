Cuba's
biosphere
reserves
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
rl The Soviet-made jeep, an
I aged vehicle with many thou¬
sands of kilometres on the clock,
turned off the motorway leading
from the Cuban capital, Havana, and
headed for Playa Girón, on the Zap¬
ata peninsula. This was where the
Third National Seminar on Cuba's
Protected Areas, organized at the
request of Antonio Perera Puga,
head of the Environment Agency's
Protected Areas Centre, was being
held. Seventy participants, from all
the provinces of Cuba, were attend¬
ing this seminar, part of whose remit
was to respond to a UNESCO ques¬
tionnaire drawn up with the aim of
having the swampland on the Zapata
peninsula (the Ciénaga de Zapata)
listed as the island's fifth hiosphere
reserve.
Cuba is the largest island in the
Caribbean, 1,250 km long, nearly
200 km wide, and surrounded by
some 1,600 islets and reefs. Since
two-thirds of its eleven million inhab¬
itants live in towns and cities, there
are scarcely more than ten people
to the square kilometre in the rest of
the island, with the result that the
human impact on the environment is
very limited.
Seen from the air, Cuba appears
predominantly green, with innumer¬
able rectangular fields of sugar-cane
and groves of royal palms that alter-

nate with plantations of citrus fruits
and bananas. The soil is deep purple
shading into violet, and there is
water irrigation canals, lakes and
rivers everywhere. In 1900, the
island was still half covered with for¬
est, hut now only 19 per cent of it is
forested.
THE CIÉNAGA DE ZAPATA
The Ciénaga de Zapata is the
Caribbean's largest area 500,000
hectares of wetland. Its maze of
freshwater channels, islands and man¬
grove swamps is a haven for manatees,
5,000 or so crocodiles, 27 species of
reptiles and 15 species of mammals,
hut above all for 10,000 pink flamin¬
goes and for 160 species of birds,
most of them, like the colourful
tocororo or Cuban togon (Priotelus
temnurus) which together with the
royal palm is the country's national
emblem or the ivory-billed wood¬
pecker (Campephilus principalis),
threatened with extinction. Strangely
enough, this peninsula is still not
listed among the sites protected
under the Convention on Wetlands of
International Importance Especially
as Waterfowl Habitat (known as the
Ramsar Convention, having been
adopted at Ramsar, Iran, on 2 Feb¬
ruary 1971).
Scattered around among several
small villages, the peninsula's 9,000
inhabi tants make a living from fishing,
charcoal burning and tourism. As
everywhere else in Cuba, environ
mental education forms part of the
syllabus at all grades in the schools
here. The Cuban educational system
is, incidentally, so well developed that
illiteracy has almost been eradicated,
and as for the free national health
system, the figures speak for them¬
selves: one doctor for every 275
inhabitants and an infant mortality
rate of 9 per thousand, as against 90
per thousand in Africa and 41 in
Latin America, for example. Cubans
joke that they can have a heart trans¬
plant for free but can't get hold of
aspirins for love nor money.
The problems of managing Cuba's
biosphere reserves are inseparable
from the country's overall economic
situation. When we visited the Sierra
del Rosario reserve, its manager,Mar-
itza Garcia, who does not own a car,
had to come to meet us by hitch-hik¬
ing (a method known as botellas in
Cuba). Although she has a brand-new
computer provided by UNESCO, she-
has trouble in obtaining paper and
ink for it. Like everything else here,
including nails and machetes, they
can be bought for dollars, while on
the other hand only Cuban nationals
can use the national currency, the
peso (it should also be pointed out
that 300 pesos, regarded as a good
salary in Cuba , are equivalent to $12) .
Slogans displayed on walls drive home

the message that Cuba should not
count on outside help, but well-tar¬
geted aid would be invaluable for the
nature conservation enthusiasts whom
we encountered everywhere on our
travels.
SIERRA DEL ROSARIO
The Sierra del Rosario reserve is a
25,000-hectare mountain region, 50
km from Havana, with four rivers
running through it. There are four
types of vegetation within the
reserve: tropical rainforest, decidu¬
ous woodland, pinewoods, and savan¬
nah, this last being home to many
orchids and endemic plants. There
arc 608 species of higher plants, 90
species of birds, many of them

endemic to this site, 16 species of
amphibians, including the world's
smallest frog, Smithilus limbatus,
and 33 species of reptiles. The two
central zones consist of two rocky
peaks rising to over 500 m. In the
1 ,000-hectarc buffer zone, tra¬
versed by 175 km of roads acting as
fire-breaks, tree-felling and hunting
are prohibited. Guides accompany
visitors along nature trails. There
are several villages where the region's
4,000 or so inhabitants live, the most
remarkable of these being Las Ter¬
razas, where, thanks to income from
tourism, a hotel with trees built into
its design has been constructed, and
local craftspeople and artists sell
wood-carvings and superb paintings
of orchids.
GUANAHACABIBES
The Guanahacabibes biosphere
reserve is located at the extreme
western end of the island. Its name
derives from that of the indigenous
cave-dwelling people who lived there
for almost 2,000 years, until the six¬
teenth century. Its 101,500 hectares
of never-ending beaches, jagged lime¬
stone pavements, marshland, peat
bogs and mangrove swamps provide
a habitat for about 600 species of
plants, 15 of which are found
nowhere else, deer, a large rodent,
the Initia (Capromys), bats, reptiles,
wild cattle and any number of birds.
Much research has been carried
out on this reserve since 1985. Jorge
Ferro, Director of the Environment
for the large province of Pinar del
Rio, who is writing a book on tiny
orrhids, has to hitch-hike to get
there and has to make do with one
roll of camera film a year. He guided
us on the nature trails that hav c been
laid out through the reserve, one of
them in the central zone. The people
living on the reserve arc employed
by a State forestry enterprise, in the
village of Valle de San Juan there
are 1,200 beehives, producing 59
tons of honey a year. Funds provided
by a Spanish organization have made
it possible to build a large hothouse
for growing tomatoes, for which
there is a ready market, and solar
panels are due to be installed in the
village. The oldest inhabitant,
Esther, grows and prescribes medi¬
cinal plants.
BAC0NA0
From Havana we Hew to Santiago de
Cuba, which is only two kilometres
west of the 84,600-hcctare Raconao
reserve, an integral part of the Gran
Parque Nacional Sierra Maestra.
The reserve is managed by Riocco
(Eastern Centre for the Study of
Ecosystems and Riodivcrsily), a very
acliv e organization for which 47 sci¬
entists work in Santiago's Natural
History Museum. Also in Santiago is
a garden run by Manuel Caluff, a
veritable research centre linked to
the reserve, established in 1976,
where 350 species of fern and an
abundance of orchids grow.
Some superb cacti, including an
endangered endemic species, Meto-
cactus harlowii, are to be found on
the dry coastal tablelands. The
scenery is very different around the
Gran Piedra, a mountainous area of
the reserve which has 138 species of
endemic plants and 919 species of
animals. Its pines, which were grown
for timber and are gradually being
replaced by native species, are inter¬
spersed with tree-ferns and other
types of fern no fewer than 335
species and terrestrial orchids
(Phaius tunckervillie ).

CUCHILLAS DEL TOA
From Raconao, a mountain road
leads to the Cuchillas del Toa
reserve, near Raracoa, the first town
in Cuba, founded in 1512. The
reserve's central zone encompasses
the Alejandro de Humboldt Park,
60,000 hectares ofmountainous ter¬
rain traversed by countless rivers and
with an annual rainfall of 4,000mm,
where there is no question of ven¬
turing without a guide.
We were shown around by the
park's director, Rael Acebal Suárez,
who told us that 70% of its plant
species are endemic; more than half
of the species growing in Cuba are to
be found there. There are four farm¬
ing communities within the park. Its
67,000-hectarc buffer zone has been
seriously damaged by agricultural
activities, and a recent forest fire did
nothing to improve matters. The local
inhabitants arc helping to replant the
mangrove swamps, where there is a
population ofmanatees. Since meat,
like other staple foods, is rationed,
they are allowed to hunt wild pigs
and hutia but are urged to do so in
moderation. Two villages designed to
meet the needs of "ecotourism" are
being built with funds provided by
Germany.
PRIVILEGED RESERVES
Compared with so many other bios¬
phere reserves we have visited on four
continents, those in Cuba even if
their boundaries are not always
defined as accurately as they might
be are on the whole in a very good
state of preservation, the reason being
that there is very little industry in
Cuba, its population density is
extremely low, its transport system
is sketchy and its economic situation
is such that nothing can be wasted.
Since bottles, plastic bags and paper
are in short supply, people don't lit¬
ter the countryside with them . Those
who enjoy the privilege of access to
the reserves appreciate their value
and respect their biodiversity. Last
but not least, the scientists who work
there are dedicated to their task and
do not look for financial rewards.
They manage as best they can,
uncomplainingly, endorsing the
Cuban proverb, Cuando no hay
perro, se montea con gato if you
haven't got a dog, a cat will do, or,
beggars can't be choosers. I
