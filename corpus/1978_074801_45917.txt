Sadriddin Ayni
A great Central Asian poet of freedom
APRIL 1978 marks the centenary of the
birth of Sadriddin Ayni, a great and
original writer who wrote in two
languagesTadzhik and Uzbek both of
which are spoken in his native region of
Bukhara (in what is today Soviet Central
Asia). The works of Sadriddin Ayni, who
died in 1954, are widely read in the U.S.S.R.,
where they have been translated into 36 lan¬
guages. But even outside the U.S.S.R.,
there had been 300 publications of his
works by 1970.
The son of a craftsman, he was orphaned
at 11 years of age, and in order to continue
his studies in a madrasah (a, Muslim reli¬
gious school) he worked as a street swee¬
per and a porter, and took a number of
other jobs. When he was 18, he began to
write poems, many of which were inspired
by popular festivals and fairs.
An educator as well as a poet, Sadriddin
Ayni developed a critical attitude towards
the feudal regime in Bukhara which altered
the course of his life. In 1905 he headed a
pioneering school in Bukhara which prac¬
tised new teaching methods, and when the
school was closed down by the clergy, he
and his supporters organized clandestine

lessons for illiterate adults. Ten years later
he was forced to flee from his native city
because of his opposition to the regime.
On his return to Bukhara in Spring 1917,
he was arrested, brutally beaten and
thrown into jail where he stayed until his
release by the soldiers of the Revolution.
But it was only after 1920 and the fall of the
Emir of Bukhara that Sadriddin began to
express himself fully and freely as a writer
and an educator, taking an active part in the
creation of the country's first Soviet
schools and writing a number of handbooks
for teachers.
But although Sadriddin Ayni was a poet,
he was above all a writer of prose. His rich
experience of life, his profound knowledge
of the customs and traditions of Tadzhikis-
tan and Uzbekistan and his constant stri¬
ving for freedom permeate all his work,
from the stories in The Hangman of Buk¬
hara (1922) to his epic novel Slaves (1934-
1935) and his four volumes of Memoirs
(1948-1954).
