Straddling the borderline between
the United States and Mexico, the
Sonoran Desert stretches on the
American side from California to
Arizona and on the Mexican from
Baja California to the stale of
Sonora. It is home to the world's
largest ('actus, succulents and a
profusion of bushes, not to mention
numerous species of birds, insects
and mammals. It can get so hot and
it rains so little that the first mis¬
sionaries to set foot in the area
likened it to Hell. From the plant
and wildlife point of view it is one
of the richest deserts in the world
and has been lived in by humans for
more than 12,000 years.
On the northern side of the
border, the Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument (OIU'I) was
proclaimed a national monument in
1937, then a UNESCO Biosphere
Beserve in 1976. South of the
border, several areas that had been
protected for a number of years
El Pinacate, the Gran Desierto de
Altar, the upper reaches of the
Gulf of California and the Colorado
Biver Delta were joined in a single

Biosphere Beserve named Alto
Golfo de California in 1995. Three
years before saw the beginnings of a
bold project for a Biosphere
Reserve that would cover some
28,700 km- and encompass the
entire Sonoran Desert, both its U.S.
and Mexican sections. The idea
emerged from a workshop attended
by scientists and administrators
from the two countries, who on the
same occasion created the Interna¬
tional Sonoran Desert Alliance
(ISDA) in order to maintain an on¬
going dialogue between Mexicans,
Americans and Tohono O'odham
Native Americans, and to integrate
conservation, research, education
and sustainable development.
Organ Pipe Cactus National
Monument
The most spectacular part of the
Sonoran Desert and the most typical
of its ecosystem is probably the
Organ Pipe. Cactus National Monu¬
ment, which covers 134,000
hectares on the American side of the
border. Despite the aridity of the cli¬
mate (an average of 23 cm of spo¬
radic, rain a year) and summer tem¬
peratures nudging 60° Celsius, 574
of the 730 vascular plant species (or
tracheophyta) in the desert are
found there; and more than 90 per
cent of these are endemic. The most
impressive plants are the giant
saguaro (Curnegiea giganteo), which
has become the symbol of the area,
and the Organ Pipe Cactus (Sfeno-
cereus thurbcri). The commonest
tree is the palo verde (Cercidium
microphyllum) that blooms with
small yellow flowers in the spring.
There is also an abundance of jojoba
(Simmondsia chinensis), agave
(Agave deserti) and one-seed juniper
(Juníperas monosperm a).
There is also a wide variety of
wildlife: 55 species of mammals, four
species of amphibians, 43 species of
snakes, 260 bird species and even one
species of fish, the desert pupfish
(Cyprinodon macularias eremus),
that is unique, to the United States.
It may well seem strange to talk of
fish and the desert in the same
breath, but OBPI contains 11
springs, three of which are perennial.
The largest is Quitobaipiito which
discharges nearly 130 litres per
minute and sustains a pond and a
green oasis. It was a vital staging-post
for travellers 400 years ago as they
passed along the Camino del Diablo
on their way from Mexico to Cali¬
fornia in search of gold and other
minerals. It was already a cross-roads
at the time of the llohokam culture
between 300 B.C. and 1400 A.D.
But intensive agricultural devel¬
opment and urbanization in the
neighbouring Mexican state of
Sonora, especially since the installa¬
tion of a high-voltage powerline at
Ilermosillo, are posing serious prob¬
lems for OBPI. Over 200 wells
pump 5,300 litres of water per
minute from the groundwater of the
Sonoyta Biver basin, i.e. two and a
half times its replenishment
capacity. Aerial spraying of crops
and the introduction of cultivated
exotic plants are added threats to
the park's natural resources. On the
American side unchecked irrigation
has already caused the salination of
200,000 hectares of land.
OBPI is bordered on the west
by the Cabeza Prieta National
Wildlife Refuge, which was created
in 1939 to protect the Desert
Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis
mexicana) and the Sonoran Prong-
horn Antelope (Antitocapra ameri¬
cana sonoriensis). In 1942, how-

ever, its 348,000 hectares became
the second largest artillery range in
the United States, now called the
Barry M. Goldwater Air Force
Bange. The U.S. Air Force and Navy
cany out air-to-air target practice all
year long, and the ground is littered
with unexploded devices and debris.
Low-altitude flying by supersonic jet
fighters frightens the animals, but
experts admit that the refuge's envi¬
ronment is generally in excellent
shape because access to it is severely
restricted.
A study by Jennifer Jenkins of
the Yale School of Forestry and Envi¬
ronmental Studies points up what
she calls the "inconsistencies" of the
refuge system. On the one hand
refuges exist to protect biodiversity;
on the other, they have to receive
more and more tourists, hunters, and
oil and mineral prospectors, and at
the, same time withstand the conse¬
quences of the intensive farming of
neighbouring lands: pesticide run-off
and abstraction of groundwater sup¬
plies. A reform that would resolve
these, contradictions is underway.
The cinders of hell
The nature of Mexico's Pinacate
and Gran Desierto Beserve is quite
different. Essentially volcanic, the
terrain in its northern sector resem
bles the moon's surface so strongly
that American astronauts have
trained there. There arc more than
400 cinder cones, ten giant craters
(more like meteor impact areas
than volcano craters), lava flows and
gently sculpted sand dunes that
contrast sharply with the jagged sil¬
houette of the mountains. There
are more than 560 vascular plant
species, 56 species of mammals
(including the pronghorn), 43
species of reptiles, 222 bird
species and 4 species offish. Tem¬
peratures range between -30°Cel-
sius and +50°Celsius.
The reserve is managed by 26-
year-old Isabel Granillo, a graduate
in ecology. Unlike her American
counterparts, Isabel does not pack
a gun. And yet the reserve attracts
drug traffickers who use the flat-
lands as a runway for their small
planes whose cargo is intended for
the United States, some 50 kilo¬
metres away. "I'm not here on a
crime-prevention mission," she
explains. "All I can do is call the
police. I'm here to inform the
public." With the help of eight
young rangers, one of whom is an
O'odham, she criss-crosses the
reserve telling visitors not to leave
the beaten track, hunt, light fires,
leave litter or take anything away.
Anyone is liable to make a chance
archaeological find, since vestiges
of primitive tools, campsites near
watering holes (tinajas) and huge
figures etched into the volcanic soil
provide evidence that the area has
been inhabited by humans for more
than 12,000 years.
The eastern section of the Alto
Golfo Beserve is composed of two
core areas: the Sierra del Pinacate
(228,000 hectares) and the Sierra
del Bosario (42,000 hectares),
which are surrounded by a buffer
zone of 445,000 hectares. Isabel's
task is complicated by the fact
that the larger of the two core
areas is in the hands of small
landowners (ejideros) whose herds
compete with wild animals for the
meagre grazing lands and for
watering holes that are few and far
between. The area's 200 inhabi¬
tants live in tiny hamlets, work on

the Reserve or in the cinder mines,
and- run roadside cafes or small
garages.
Shrinking wetlands
Further west, around the Sea of
Cortez, another core area consists of
165,000 hectares that are part
desert and part wetland formed by
the delta of the Colorado River. But
a huge dam on the United States side
of the border siphons off so much
river water for local agricultural
needs that the wetlands, located in
Mexico, are shrinking steadily. By the
time the Colorado empties into the
Sea of Cortez, it is a mere muddy,
over-salted trickle.
José Campoy and his wife
Martha Roman Rodriguez, two
biologists who have recently been
assigned to manage the reserve,
have begun by building a reception
centre, dwellings and research
facilities. Their job will not be
easy, for they will have to deal with
the conflicts created by the facts
of local economic life. Shrimp
fishing, for example, has been
banned from April to September,
and fishing for certain species such
as the totoaba (Totoaba mac-
donaldi) and marine mammals such
as the vaquita dolphin is prohib¬
ited in the Sea of Cortez. Talks are
being held with Mexican shrimp
fishermen in an attempt to per¬
suade them to convert to the fledg¬
ling ecotourism industry. But dia¬
logue is impossible with the drug
traffickers who dump into the Col¬
orado Biver crates of drugs
marked with cyanide-based fluo¬
rescent paint that can be seen at
night by their accomplices. Pollu¬
tion of the Colorado Biver is a
major problem, and some biologists
believe that damage to the estuary
is now irreversible.
A grassroots movement
One question that arises, in addition
to problems of legal definitions and
administrative boundaries, is what
conception do the locals have of a
Biosphere Reserve? Joaquin Mur-
rieta Saldivar, a Mexican studying in
Arizona, has written his doctoral
thesis on this subject. The notion of
development that benefits everyone
seems hard to grasp by those who
ask: "What's in it for me, right now?

Isn't it depriving me of my meagre
resources?"
To avoid friction, scientists, deci¬
sion-makers and locals must see eye
to eye so that no one group's inter¬
ests take precedence over the others.
With help from the International
Sonoran Desert Alliance (ISDA), dia¬
logue has already produced results
and some population groups have
reacted positively. The Tohono
O'odham, for example, have built
some small dikes to capture rain¬
water run-off and combat erosion. It
should be said that Anthony Ramon,
the President of the Alliance, is a
Tohono O'odham chief.
The Alliance encounters many
administrative roadblocks not least
the problem of crossing the border
but its monthly meetings (which are
conducted in both English and
Spanish) demonstrate its determina¬
tion to include the Biospheres of
Alto Golfo, OBPI and the Cabeza
Prieta Befuge in one huge Biosphere
Beserve. With the core areas already
determined, the only things left to
define are the buffer zones and the
transition areas.
Harold Smith, an ORPI super¬
intendent for the past fourteen
years, is optimistic, "We've shaken
up the general apathy," he says.
"The Alliance now has good
prospects. It is like a flower that is
starting to blossom." B
