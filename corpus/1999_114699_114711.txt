A rg e n t i n a ’s penniless p e n s i o n e rs
■
Argentina is a country where old people are
p o o r. Badly treated economically and socially,
they are society’s cast-offs, forgotten in the
dark recesses of memory.
They represent 12 per cent of the total
p o p u l at i o n , yet they are shabbily treated by the
government, which relegates them to the sidelines
of society.There are 4,500,000 over-60s,and only
2,800,000 of them receive some kind of old age
p e n s i o n . More than 1,500,000 people have no
insurance coverage what e ver and live in dire
poverty.
Official economic adjustment policies have
a lways targeted the pension system. In 1992,
b owing to pressure from the World Bank, P r e s i d e n t
Carlos Menem’s gove rnment reduced the benefit s
paid to most pensioners to $150 a month.The bu l k
of Argentine society is unperturbed by this stat e
of affa i rs and looks on the fate of its elders with
i n d i f f e r e n c e .
One quarter of the pensioners still receive $150
a month, an absurdly small amount which is not
e ven enough to pay for the medicines they need.
Some 50 per cent of the 1,500,000 recipients of
pensions get less than $350 a month and, at the
top of the scale, f e wer than three per cent get more
than $1,000.
The story of the Integral Medical Care
P r o gramme (PAMI) illustrates the decline in
benefits available to retired people. T h e
p r o gramme was established in 1971 and in its
early ye a rs it was an efficient medical and social
s e rvices agency which operated on its own funds.
Its current statutes empower it to administer its
own resources, which come from the
c o n t ri butions made by active and retired wo r k e rs
and compulsory employer contri bu t i o n s. U n t i l
the 1980s, on an annual budget not exceeding
$ 1 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , PAMI covered the entire country
and opened a total of 55 new health care centres.
At the present time, this 
we l fare agency has a budget of $2,400,000 
for providing care for 4,000,000 regi s t e r e d
m e m b e rs but it contracts the work out to serv i c e
p r ov i d e rs because it does not have the releva n t
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e .
Cutbacks in 
medical services
The quality of the services provided has
steadily declined over the past ten ye a rs , d u ri n g
which PAMI was managed by eight different
a d m i n i s t r at o rs or presidents, who were suspected
or accused of taking part in or countenancing the
o p e r ation of parallel medical or health care
n e t wo r k s. B ri b e ry and corruption we r e
commonplace and the credibility, e f f i c i e n cy and
functioning of the system suffered. On more than
one occasion, PAMI was virtually insolve n t .To d ay,
old people are suffering from the sudden cutback
in services that are essential to their surv i va l ,s u c h
as medicines, care by family doctors and the
postponement of surgical operat i o n s , owing to the
failure to pay anaesthetists.
Since the early 1990s, retired people
d e m o n s t r ate eve ry We d n e s d ay in front of the
parliament bu i l d i n g .This eve n t , which in its heyday
mobilized more than 10,000 demonstrat o rs and
brought traffic to a halt in Buenos Aires, has now
almost become reduced to a picturesque
happening. Since the death in 1996 of the protest
l e a d e r , N o rma Plá, a pensioner who resorted to
such unconventional tactics as chaining herself to
the railings of the parliament building and
organizing a popular demonstration in front of the
l aw court s , it has lost its widespread appeal and
i m p a c t . As the gove rnment rejected its eve ry
d e m a n d , the members of the movement lost heart .
But penniless though they may be, t h e
p e n s i o n e rs still enjoy one enviable bonus—they
constitute 20 per cent of the electorat e . It is a
strange paradox that there is no nat i o n w i d e
m ovement to press for the rights and interests of
retired people. ■
