T
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF TAHA HUSSEIN
BY CHARBEL DAGHER
On
48
FNE day, not long ago, I stood
with Moenis outside a Left Bank Paris
hotel just off the Boulevard Saint-
Michel. It was the centenary year of
the birth of Moenis' father, Taha
Hussein, one of the pioneers of
modern Arabic literature. We were
retracing the footsteps of the great
Egyptian writer, who had lived in
Paris in the early years of the century.
First stop was the Hôtel Beauvoir,
where Taha Hussein had stayed dur¬
ing his student days.
I asked Moenis to pose so that
I could photograph him in front of
each of the two windows which flank
the door of the hotel. How, I won¬
dered, could we capture an ¡mage of
the man who had lived there in those
far-off days? Imagine my surprise
later, when the photos had been de¬
veloped and I saw that someone had
written the three letters TAH on the
wall of the hotel, while elsewhere in
the photo the elongated shadow of
the bespectacled face of his son
seemed to be another hint that the
memory of the young student had
not entirely faded.
But before beginning our stroll
through Paris in search of Taha
Hussein let us first make a detour via
Montpellier, where he arrived with a
bursary from the Egyptian govern¬
ment shortly before the First World
War. Why Montpellier? I wondered.
"Perhaps because it was a
provincial city," Moenis suggested,
"and the students might have had
less to distract them from their work
there than in Paris. Perhaps someone
thought that Egyptian students
would feel more at home in Mont¬
pellier than in Paris because it was
nearer to the Mediterranean. I never
asked him. My father was trying to
improve his French. He had already
learned the rudiments of the lan¬
guage at the University of Cairo,
where there was some kind of a
course in French studies."
It was in Montpellier during the
First World War that Taha Hussein
met Suzanne Brisseau, whose family
had moved there from Paris to escape
the bombing. Suzanne had been
preparing to take the entrance exam
for the prestigious École Normale
Supérieure de Jeunes Filles, then
located in the Paris suburb of
Sèvres, but had had to interrupt her
studies when the family moved to
Montpellier.
"Since my father was blind,"
Moenis went on as we stood outside
the Hôtel Beauvoir, "he needed
someone to help him with his French
and to read to him. So he put an
advertisement in a local paper.
Suzanne applied for the job.
However, she did more than read to
him. She accompanied him to his
lectures at the Montpellier Arts
Faculty, and later, when they were
both in Paris, she would walk hand
in hand with him from his lodgings
to the Sorbonne."
Moenis and I set off along the
route the young couple had taken all
those years ago. A few metres off the
Boulevard Saint-Michel, they often
stopped in front of a statue honour¬
ing two nineteenth-century chemists,
, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph
Bienaimé Caventou, who had done
pioneering work in the struggle
against tropical diseases. Today the
bronze statue has disappeared but a
stone monument is still there,
adorned with medallions honouring
the two scientists. The route they
took passes by what is now the
Egyptian Cultural Centre.
Taha Hussein and Suzanne
Brisseau wished to marry. As we con¬
tinued our stroll, Moenis described
the obstacles to the match and the
surprising way in which they were
overcome.
"My mother's family was horri¬
fied," he said, "at the thought that
their daughter should marry an Egyp¬
tian student who was not only poor
and Muslim but blind as well. My
mother refused to yield. It was one
of her uncles, a priest who was
extremely intelligent and highly cul¬
tivated, who took the decisive step.
At my grandmother's request he
asked for an hour alone with my
father. They went for a walk, my
great-uncle holding my father's arm,
and talked of this and that. When
they returned, the priest said to his
sister: 'Don't worry! Instead of oppos¬
ing this marriage I think you should
be delighted. This young man is a
genius.' Suzanne already knew this.
They were married on 2 August
1917."
Within five years, the student
with dark glasses had won a
bachelor's degree and a higher
diploma (on Tacitus), passed the
highly competitive agrégation exami¬
nation for university teachers and
been awarded a doctorate for his
work on the fourteenth-century
Arab historian Ibn Khaldun. He
had mastered Greek and Latin.
Taha Hussein professed a boundless
admiration for his two teachers,
the distinguished Hellenist Gustave
Bloch and the historian Charles
Selgnobos. He also attended lectures
by Henri Bergson at the Collège de
France, by the sociologist Lucien
Lévy-Bruhl and the Orientalist Louis
Massignon, for whom he had great
respect.
He met Louis Aragon, Jules
Romains and above all André Gide.
His first encounter with Gide took
place in Cairo just after the war and
initiated a correspondence between
the two writers. Their admiration was
mutual: Hussein translated Gide's
Prométhée mal enchaîné (1 899) and
Thésée (1 946) into Arabic, while Gide
wrote a preface for the French trans¬
lation of Taha Hussein's great auto¬
biographical novel al-Ayyam ("The
Days").
But of all the French writers he
knew, it was Etiemble with whom he
had the longest and deepest relation¬
ship. When he was Rector of the
University of Alexandria in the early

1940s, Taha Hussein asked Etiemble,
then in the United States, to head the
university's department of French
studies. Etiemble arrived in Egypt in
1944 and stayed four years. They
remained close friends until Taha
Hussein's death in 1973.
After returning to Egypt to
become a university teacher, a
famous writer, and a government
minister, Taha Hussein often visited
France Paris, or for holidays in the
Alps, the Massif Central or the
Pyrenees.
"He loved France dearly. He
loved the French mind, not the
earthy, gaulish side. The verve of the
chansonniers and their political allu¬
sions amused him. I often went with
him to a bistrot for a drink and he
delighted in listening to the talk going
on around him. He had a marvellous
sense of fun and was easily moved
to laughter. He had a typically Egyp¬
tian laugh! At home we always spoke
French. My mother never really
learned Arabic. She spoke it suffi¬
ciently well to go shopping and to
handle the situations of everyday life.
I think my father was happy to speak
French at home. He wrote articles
and lectures in French, but less from
personal inclination than in response
to requests. Arabic was the language
in which he thought and felt. It was
only later that he transferred his ideas
and feelings into other languages."
Like Hussein Fawzi (1905-1988),
whose wife, also French, kept an
antique shop in Paris, like Kamel
Hussein and Tawfiq al-Hakim, and
like many other less illustrious Egyp¬
tian intellectuals, Taha Hussein fol¬
lowed the path opened by Tahtawi
(1 80 1 -1 873), the writer who came to
France to study in 1 830, one of the
first Egyptians to do so.
In Egypt, then under British
domination, the cultural ¡deal was
French. Taha Hussein took inspiration
from this ideal, notably by developing
Sainte-Beuve's critical method and
the art of the short novel as practised
by Maupassant. This profoundly non¬
conformist man turned his blindness
and humble social origins to good
account. For him, writing was a form
of self-fulfilment.
But this special link with a
country and its culture almost came
to an end in 1956. Taha Hussein
never forgave the French for their
military intervention at Suez. Not that
his political opinions were naive or
simplistic. He had always been an
uncompromising critic of French
colonialism. But invading Egypt was
for him unpardonable.
"Let's stop there, if you don't
mind," Moenis said suddenly.
"There's always a certain complicity
between a father and his daughter,
between a mother and her son. We
were no exception. My father loved
me very much, I know. There was
never any conflict between us. There
might have been one had I aspired
to play a role in Arab literature. But
I have never claimed to be able to
write in Arabic, especially since my
father was a man named Taha
Hussein."
The last rays of the setting sun
bathed the city. The fading colours
spread out like an artist's palette, in
contrasts of light and shade.
Our walk was over.
