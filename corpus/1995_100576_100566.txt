Nagisa Oshima
Japanese director Nagisa Oshima (right) won an
international reputation with In the Realm of the Senses
(1975). Many of his films, such as Merry Christmas,
Mr. Lawrence (198S) and Max mon amour (1986), have a
compulsive, disturbing quality.
> At this year's Cannes Film
Festival you presented a
work entitled 100 Years of
Japanese Cinema. Has the
cinemareally existed in
Japan for a hundred years?
Yes. At first French technicians
went there to shoot documentary
footage. Then the Japanese, with
their usual appetite for things from
abroad, ordered cameras and began
filming, Kabuki theatre to start with.
Production soon diversified, and the
history of the Japanese film industry
began in earnest.
> What is the leitmotiv of this
history?
I think Japanese directors have
been trying to get closer to freedom
in the last hundred years. In any case
that's how I see it.
> What do you mean by
"freedom"?
The greatest barrier to development
in Japan has always been our family
system. The very special power
bestowed upon the father is a throw¬
back to feudalism that was enshrined
in law even after Japan was opened
up in the Meiji period. The power of
the father has permeated the Japanese
social fabric, spreading into business
Wï"'
v

and even the army. Presidents of com¬
panies used to have, and sometimes
still have today, exhorbitant power that
turns their employees into children,
devoid of any responsibility, of any
adult feelings.
Any rebellion against this deeply
entrenched system was regarded as
extremely, Intolerably evil. The most
varied examples of this rebellion have
long been portrayed in Japanese
cinema. Even during the Second
World War our cinema dealt with
oppression by fathers both within
and outside the family.
I Did the law change after the
war?
The old system was abolished. All
the members of a family now enjoy
equal rights, as they do in the West.
But the system is so old that it has

survived nevertheless. For fifteen to
twenty years the Japanese cinema
continued to struggle against out¬
moded attitudes. It was only after
1960 that a new generation of film¬
makers, of which I am a member,
sought to make a different kind of
film, with the break-up of the family as
a backdrop. But at that time the film
industry was starting to decline.
> Because of television?
The rise of television in Japan had
a lot to do with it, as it has every¬
where else. In 100 Years of Japanese
Cinema, I included a scene from a film
of the period where you see an entire
family sitting round a big table
watching TV. They no longer have a
centre, a focal point; conviviality has
gone. The television set was more
than a match for the father figure.
> The feudal code was wiped
out?
Precisely. A generation of young
people emerged without any land¬
marks. They were utterly lost; they
didn't even know who to fight. They
were no longer confronted by a wall.
They even found it hard to communi¬
cate because opposition is a basic
form of communication. More and
more, and this is the case in Japan
today, you see young people turned
In on themselves, in a kind of autistic
condition. And naturally this attitude is
recorded in modern Japanese cinema.

provoke sharp reactions in
Japan?
No. Nor did Merry Christmas, Mr.
Lawrence (1 982). We were expecting
violent reactions from Japanese ex-
servicemen. But films, works of art in
general, don't have a big effect on
Japanese society. I think Japanese
society is devoid of reaction. The only
hardnosed response came from the
police. The film was shot discreetly in
Japan, but it was edited and post-
produced in France. Its producer,
Anatole Dauman, was French.
To show the film in Japan there¬
fore, we had to import it. And then
the Japanese customs got in on the
act. They demanded and obtained
cuts, which also partially explains the
indifference of the public. This atti¬
tude on the part of the customs offi¬
cials was absurd, a real abuse of
power, because it had nothing to do
with them. But that's how it was.
Even the book, with photos from the
film, was banned. But I sued them; it
lasted seven years, and I won in the
end.
I Are the Japanese
puritanical?
They weren't at first. There was
great freedom of expression. But with
the arrival of Confucianism, Bud¬
dhism and Christianity things
changed, at least superficially. Deep
down, society is still not shocked by
sex. I think it is interesting that it was
women above all who defended In
the Realm of the Senses. Women
accounted for 60 per cent of the box-
office receipts.
I Is the censorship changing?
It is changing for the better, it is
becoming more liberal, if you don't
push it too hard. Things are
changing slowly but surely. On the
other hand, any overt rebellion imme¬
diately brings a reaction, an exagger¬
ated oppression.
I Should the cinema violate
taboos?
g

Shohei Imamura's Hogs and
Warships or 77¡e Flesh Is Hot
(Japan, 1961).
That's a question I am often
asked. I think that a film, like any work
of art, is not made for a specific
reason. A work of art is made without
any kind of certainty. It is produced in
fear, apprehension and doubt. It isn't
a purposeful, deliberate undertaking
that knows exactly where it is going.
It doesn't want to "express" any¬
thing. It is always possible that it may,
incidentally, offend certain taboos,
but that is not the aim.
After defeat in 1945, how
did Japan receive the
American cinema?
Very well. There was a kind of
hunger for it, even! We were hungry,
literally hungry. And American movies
were more than just movies. They
were like food. That lasted for a long
time. Even if we were opposed to the
United States and the Americaniza¬
tion of Japan, we were passionately
keen on American films. It is true that
they showed us things that for us
were incredible. Scenes of victory cel¬
ebrations, for example.
> Is the Japanese cinema
facing problems today?
It's going through a difficult
period, but I'm an inveterate optimist.
A critic once said something to me
that pleased me very much. He said,
"You are the only Japanese to talk
simultaneously of Japan, the whole
world and yourself." It's true that for a
long time our great film-makers talked
of nothing but Japan. Japanese films
seemed focused inwards on Japan.
It's also true that young film-makers
today talk only about themselves.
But that too will pass. The world is
immense. A synthesis of one kind or
another is always possible.
I Are you contributing to it?
I hope so. After Max, Mon Amour
I worked for more than four years on a
project that didn't come to anything. It
was about California in the 1 920s and
the relationship between the
Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa
and Rudolph Valentino. It was a com¬
plicated story, involving their wives.
The film was called off one month
before we were due to start shooting.
At present I am still hosting my pro¬
gramme on Japanese television
almost every day. I talk with my guests
about culture, politics, society, even
the sects. I am living completely in the
present. And of course, I'm already
thinking of another film.
I How do you get on with
American film
technicians?
Excellently. I have often worked
with my old friend Mirek Hondricek,
a Czech cameraman, both because
of his great talent and because we
know one another well. But Amer¬
ican film crews are remarkable. I
would also mention Americans' love
of the cinema and their willingness
to lend a hand. To shoot the huge
demonstration scene in Washington
for Hair I appealed through the press
for unpaid extras. Thousands of
people turned up, all dressed in
period clothes and all full of enthu¬
siasm. Thanks to them the scenes
are really convincing. I wonder if
you'd find such enthusiasm in other
countries.
