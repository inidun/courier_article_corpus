Nostalgia for I s t a n b u l

The sounds and smells of the fish marke t ,
the cool of a café near a mosque, alleyways cascading 
down towards the sea plied by vessels large 
and small—the indelible memories of a leading 
Turkish writer

I s t a n bul is present in most of my books.
One of my novels begins with these
wo r d s :“ For a long time I rose early. I t
was there, on the Asian shores of the Bos-
phorus, in my beloved city, which has fol-
lowed me everywhere and whose memory
is branded in my mind forever.”What new
can I find to say about Istanbu l , as a Tu r k i s h
w riter who has lived in Pa ris for twe n t y - five
years, except by evoking the piercing nos-
talgia I feel for the city from afar. My fore-
head bent over white pages, I imagine the
city and invent it through writing.
Slowly it comes into focus in the lam-
plight.Its famous skyline of slender mina-
r e t s , lead domes, castle keeps, r a m p a rt s ,
t owe rs and office buildings slowly emerges.
I see the peeling walls and the pigeons. I feel
the cool air of a café near the courtyard of
a mosque. I picture myself in a taxi. The
d e e p, dark blue wat e rs of the Bosphorus are
flowing just alongside.As the road narr ow s ,
the trees become more abundant. Cruise
ships as big as cities speed past pursued by
seagulls, leaving foamy whirlpools in their
wa k e . Long row b o ats and cormorants fend
the dazzlingly white foam as they glide
through the wat e r. Wooden houses and

Located on the European shore of the Bos-
phorus Straits, Istanbul is at the crossroads
of land and sea routes, Asia and Europe, the
Black Sea and the Mediterranean.It is Turkey’s
main manufacturing centre, commercial hub
and port.With a population of 12 million, the city
and its surrounding suburbs are the country’s
fastest-growing urban area.
Founded by the Greeks as Byzantium
around 658 B. C . , Istanbul became the capital of
the Eastern Roman Empire in 330 A.D. under
Emperor Constantine, whose name it bore until
the fall of the Byzantine Empire. C o n s t a n t i n o p l e
was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, r e c o n-
quered by the Greeks in 1261 and captured by
the Ottomans on May 29, 1 4 5 3 . Mehmed II,
the Conqueror, made it the capital of the
Ottoman Empire in 1458,changing the name to
I s t a n b u l . It was not until 1923 that the city lost
its status as capital to A n k a r a . The famous
bridge spanning the Bosphorus was inaugu-
rated in March 1973.
“An old,ring-covered hand stretching out
towards Europe”is how the French poet Jean
Cocteau described Istanbul, whose historic
a r e a s, where many Byzantine and Ottoman
landmarks stand side-by-side, were added to
UN E S C O’s World Heritage List in 1985.The famous
Hagia Sophia church,built between 532 and 537
by order of Emperor Justinian II; the Mosque of
Süleyman,named after Süleyman the Magnifi-
cent and inaugurated in 1556; the Blue Mosque,
Topkapi palace and the great bazaar bear wit-
ness to a history spanning well over a thousand
years. n

swe at and uri n e . I look away from Karaköy
Square, turning my gaze left to the other
bank of the Golden Horn . Suddenly the
spectacle changes. The stage seems to
w i d e n . I see clouds briskly scudding past in
the southern wind. Straight ahead, B aye z i t
Tower gradually gr ows fainter in the ashen
light. In the distance, I can make out the
spiky minarets of the Mosque of Süleyman,
its heavy domes overwhelming the old
h o u s e s , and stacked crates forming a wall in
front of the covered market.The pigeons of
the New Mosque—little black spots—stand
out against the sky. Taking off from the
m o s q u e ’s court ya r d , they land on the blac-
kened walls and canopies of the Egyptian
b a z a a r. O d d l y, the opposite bank seems
more peaceful. But the fish market makes a
deafening racket. In the shimmeri n g
colours, fishing boats moored at the quay
bob up and down on the filthy water.The
Golden Horn is strewn with shreds of oily
rags and dead seagulls.
A tide of passengers pours out of the
Eyüp ferry which has drawn up alongside
G a l ata Bri d g e .Thick smoke belches out of
the funnel. Soot rains down on bunches of
grapes and polished apples in the stalls, o n
the old civil servants sitting in the bridge’s
c a f é s , smoking hookahs as they finger their
p r ayer beads. Police motorboat s , t a rt a n s
and pot-bellied barges glide past. So does
the boat owned by the fisherman who sells
his catch near the landing pier.The seve r e d
fish heads make me feel sick. So I get up and
head for a quieter neighbourhood.
Back in the streets, strolling past wo o d e n
houses with iron gat e s , I feel I am living
through a dream.As if I am outside the city
in an unknow n , inaccessible place, facing a
t h e atre set beyond which it is impossible to
g o. Sometimes cars pass by, and street pedd-
l e rs. “Rags! Second-hand goods!,” s h o u t s
one of them.Another yells that he sells wat e r-
melons or, d r a g ging out the “ o ” ,s ays “ t o o-
m at o e s ” instead of “ t o m at o e s ” . And “ Pe p-
p e rs! Eggplant! Chicory! Lettuce! Okra!”
They are the cries of another age, of an
I s t a n bul I have never forgotten.They come
from an unreal wo r l d . A world I can no
longer reach even if I go there.Ye s , I am in
Pa ris and, like the gr e at Turkish poet Orhan
Ve l i , who died there at the age of 35, “ I
listen to Istanbul with my eyes closed.”A n d
the lines of another Istanbul poet, w h o s e
name still bu rns my lips and who endured
more than his share of separations and nos-
t a l gic longi n g s , come to mind:“ Two things
are forgotten only in death / The face of our
mother and the face of our city.” n
