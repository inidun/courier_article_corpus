African cinema
A young and relatively unknown art
-
by Tereza Wagner and Claude Ondobo
ALLAfrican wisdom is to be
found in oral culture in
words, speech, symbols
and rhythm. So the highest form
of artistic expression is story¬
telling: not merely the narrative
as such, but the whole scene of
storyteller and audience, with
pauses and rhythm and concrete
ways of representing the word.
There is a strong similarity be¬
tween African stories and the lan¬
guage of film, and it is not surpris¬
ing that African cinema, born
only thirty years ago, should
already have produced some first-
rate film-makers and films which
rank with the great classics of
world cinema.
But although this cinema is im¬
portant in the eyes of connois¬
seurs and film buffs, it is still re¬
latively unknown to a wider au¬
dience, whether at home or
abroad, since it has developed in
isolation, virtually without help
from the outside world, sure of its
inspiration, its strength and its
rights. For this very reason, de¬
spite the crisis affecting the film
world everywhere, African cine¬
ma today is indispensable, since
its aesthetic, its themes and its
symbols are like an influx of new
blood. African film-making car¬
ries within itself the seeds of a
renewal of cinematographic lan¬
guage. Apart from the similarity
between the latter and African
storytelling, African civilization
possesses another feature which
links it with the language of film:
the fact that the imaginary and the
real are placed on an equal
footing.
Cinema, which is the art of
metaphorical representation of
human situations and feelings,
has a language of absolutes. It
brooks no half-measures and nev¬
er says anything that does not sig¬
nify: in this it differs from liter¬
ature. This makes it an art with a
close grip on reality, traditionally
an art of entertainment but, be¬
sides, an area for reflection on all
the social, political and cultural
problems which arise in a particu¬
lar society. In Africa, modernity
and tradition seem incompatible,
more so than anywhere else. Afri¬
can cinema is striving to find a
point of convergence between
these two types of society. This is
true , above all, of the first genera¬
tion of African film-makers. Afri¬
can cinema uses the tradition/
modernity dichotomy to illustrate
political issues as well as cultural
and psychological themes.
This opposition between the
modern world and the world of
Yeelen ("The Light", 1987), by the
Malian film director Souleymane
Cissé, was awarded the Jury Prize at
the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. Set in
traditional Africa, it is the story of a
confrontation between father and
son which results in natural disas¬
ters as well as economic and social
disruption.
the ancestors is a constantly re¬
curring theme in the works of two
of the founding fathers of African
cinema, Ousmane Sembène,
from Senegal, who is also a nove¬
list, and the late Oumarou Gan¬
da, from Niger. The latter began
his career as an actor with Jean
Rouch, the French film-maker
and pioneer of cinéma-vérité, a
movement which had a profound
influence on cinéma d'auteur, or

cases by the Italian Neorealist
movement, has a strong social com¬
mitment as well as being an art of

the distinctively personal style of
film-directing, in the 1960s.
Ousmane Sembène, aware of
the cultural and political role that
any creative artist has a duty to
assume in society, became a film
director the better to attain his
chosen objectives. He very quick¬
ly realized that, in Africa, films
reached a wider audience than
literature. His films, like his
books, take a shrewd look at the
past and present attitudes of the
peoples of Africa. With rare cour¬
age and lucidity, this man strives
through his work to denounce
vacillating, cowardly or ineffec¬
tual behaviour on the part of
those who are motivated by greed
for profit and glory, masquerad¬
ing as religious faith and respect
for tradition. Conversely, women
and the younger generation are
bearers of the hope that some day
a fine, strong African society will
emerge.
Whereas for Sembène the two
cultures, traditional and modern,
must blend into a single culture,
in order, to eliminate both the
ignorance behind a blind respect
for tradition and the powerless-
ness that is often engendered by a
false concept of modernity,
Oumarou Ganda made a painful
choice in favour of village life.
However, he was well aware that
village life cannot remain set
apart from economic and cultural
developments. His analysis there¬
fore coincides to some extent with
that of Ousmane Sembène.
Other pioneers of African cine¬
ma are the late Paulin Soumanou
Vieyra, from Senegal, and the
Ivorians Timité Bassori and Dé¬
siré Ecaré, all three trained in
Paris; Ruy Guerra, from Mozam¬
bique, who worked mainly in Bra¬
zil; and the self-taught Mustapha
Alassane, from Niger, to mention
only the best known.
The first full-length African fe¬
ature film , La Noire de ... ("Black
Girl"), was made in 1966 by Ous¬
mane Sembène. Based on a minor
news item, this film traces the
reasons which induce a young
Senegalese domestic servant,
working for some former coopér¬
ants (French Peace Corps work¬
ers) who have settled in Antibes,
to commit suicide. The film's
symbolism is powerful, and in
some respects recalls the tragedy
of the slave trade. African film¬
makers are aware of the weight of
their history and the disasters of
submission, and until the late
1970s they used films on mytholo¬
gical, fictional and documentary
subjects, and also cartoons, as a
means of describing all aspects of
what it is to be African: in every¬
day life (Borom sarret "The
Building Site" a short film made
in 1962 by Ousmane Sembène), in
relations with the West
(F.V.V.A., 1972, by Mustapha
Alassane), in dreams and weak¬
nesses (Le wazzon polygame, a
medium-length film made in 1971
by Oumarou Ganda), and in the
battle for freedom (Soleil O,
1969, by Med Hondo).
Between 1975 and 1980, some
very interesting film-makers
joined the ranks of the pioneers:
the Malian Souleymane Cissé,
trained, like Sembène, in the
USSR; the marvellous Gaston
Kaboré from Burkina Faso,
trained in Paris; the Senegalese
Djibil Diop, director of only one
full-length feature film, Touki-
Bouki, but which is regarded as
one of the most important pro¬
ducts of the national film indus¬
try; Safi Faye, the first African
woman to distinguish herself as a
talented film-maker, Johnson
Traoré, trained in Paris; the Gui¬
ñean Moussa Kemoko
Diakité, trained in the Federal
Republic of Germany; the
Gabonese Pierre Marie Dong and
Philippe Mory, both trained in
France; the Congolese Sébastien
Kamba, also trained in France;
the Cameroonian Daniel Kamwa
and the Mauritanian Med Hondo,
already mentioned, both of whom
came to the cinema from the
theatre; and, lastly, the film direc¬
tor, novelist, playwright and pro¬
ducer, the Nigerian Ola Balogun,
also trained in Paris. This second
generation of film-makers won in¬
ternational recognition for Afri¬
can cinema. >
The historical film emerged in
Africa in the 1980s, addressing
new themes which do not neces¬
sarily stem from the modernity/
tradition dichotomy. This is true,
for example, of the very fine full-
length films of Gaston Kaboré,
including Wend Kuuni ("The Gift
of God", 1982), and that of
Souleymane Cissé, Yeelen ("The
Light" , 1987) , which won the Jury
Prize at the 1987 Cannes Festival.
Wend Kuuni is a psychological
drama which tells the story of a
child who is abandoned by his
family and becomes autistic. But
this inner silence cannot remain
impervious to the warmth of fel¬
lowship emanating from the com¬
munity. Yeelen is a dramatic work
in which a father's jealousy of his
son, who is to be initiated into
sacred knowledge, locks the two
in mortal combat. The action of
these two films unfolds in tradi¬
tional societies where the conflict
between tradition and modernity
is no longer used as a frame of
reference.
If the historical film is proving
more and more attractive to Afri¬
can film-makers, it is because this
type of subject affords an oppor¬
tunity to describe the religious,
political and social order of rural
communities and to show their

Still from Soleil O ("Sun O", 1969),
by the Mauritanian film-maker Med
Hondo. The struggle for freedom
under colonialism is one of the major
themes of African cinema.
solidarity in the face of adversity,
while drawing attention to village
philosophy and ethics.
Thus Med Hondo's very
beautiful Saraaunia (1986), or
Emitaï ("Thunder God", 1971)
and Ceddo ("Outsiders", 1977)
by Ousmane Sembène, highlight
the life of village communities in
their struggles against foreign in¬
vaders, whether military as in the
first two films, or religious as in
the third. The social order, which
has been destroyed by the mod¬
ern world, is particularly well por¬
trayed in these films. In Saïtane
(1973), by Oumarou Ganda, the
harmonious balance of power col¬
lapses very swiftly when such
occurrences as adultery or incest
(as in Niaye, 1965, by Ousmane
Sembène) start to influence the
behaviour of those who hold
these powers in trust. It is never¬
theless remarkable to observe
that, once the drama has been
worked out, the rigour of tradi¬
tion restores order. In Yeelen,
the confrontation between father
and son causes natural disasters as
well as serious economic and
social disruption. But the story
ends with a prophecy foretelling
that a day will come when the
Bambara will once again be a
great nation.
While the themes represented
in African films are for the most
part universal, the unity of time,
space and rhythm found in them is
resolutely a part of African cul¬
ture and civilization. Time, like
space, is elastic, and does not
place a frame around the action.
Events occur as if the eternity of
the gods had dawned on Earth,
and as if, despite the thousand-
and-one preoccupations of every¬
day life, time did not matter. Just
like the wide, generous open
space of the African landscape,
time cannot be hemmed in by
man and it takes its natural
course, independently of human
activities. By contrast, the rhythm
of these films is beaten out by
human hands. In counterpoint to
time and space, rhythm is pro¬
vided by movement, by the most
mundane gestures, or by speech,
which always takes on an oracular
tone. This is what makes it
altogether human.
In Lettre paysanne ("Letter
from the Country", 1975), by Safi
Faye, we watch the everyday life
of the film-maker's own village
during the winter months. Work
in the fields in the mornings, the
midday meal-break, as day fol¬
lows day, punctuated by scenes
under the palaver tree and snatch¬
es of conversation, all of which
are strands imperceptibly weav¬
ing the fabric of the film. The
beauty of the countryside, the
peace of the natural world, the
weight of time, although strongly
present, do not obscure the ques¬
tions of survival that the village
must face, and do not deflect any
of the criticism that may be
aroused by traditional customs,
manners and morals.
Set against this highly political
and intellectual form of cinema,
there is also the commercial cine¬
ma of the English-speaking coun¬
tries. The Nigerian Ola Balogun,
who is probably the only African
film-maker to have directed and
produced more than ten full-
length feature films, has had a run
of successes with works adapted
from Yoruba theatre, in which
marvellous stories unfold in a uni¬
verse of music and dance. His out¬
put also includes works of a
mythological nature, such as The
Black Goddess (1979), or political
films like Cry Freedom (1980), a
protest against colonization.
These works are, nevertheless,
closer to Western cinema than
those of the French-speaking
African countries.
Although the wealth and com¬
plexity of African cinema cannot
be denied, it is nevertheless not
equipped to compete against the
powerful world film industry.
Two major obstacles stand in its
way: technique and funding. This
cinema emerged and developed
virtually without support of any
kind, whether financial, political,
cultural or technical. Thirty years
later, the working conditions of
film-makers are still extremely
precarious. Indeed, cinema came
late to the African continent', at a
time when "maximum technical
know-how" has become neces¬
sary in order to make a film with
universal appeal. Yeelen by
Souleymane Cissé shows that,
with adequate funding and tech¬
niques, a film can emerge from
the ghetto in which African cine¬
ma is at present languishing.
Since mainly experimental and
art films are being produced, the
African economic sector has not
concerned itself with setting up a
film industry. But the growing in¬
terest shown by international pro¬
ducers in this cinéma d'auteur
will, perhaps, result in a break¬
through.
