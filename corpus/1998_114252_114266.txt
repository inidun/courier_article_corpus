A stone’s throw from the mausoleum of the lat e
Ho Chi Minh is an ordinary-looking gove rn-
ment building with an old-fashioned entrance
and a shabby hallway.It is the headquart e rs of the Stee-
ring Committee of the National Programme for Infor-
m ation Te c h n o l o g y. U p s t a i rs , things are different.
There we find young computer expert s , tapping away
on stat e - o f - t h e - a rt computers.
Here in the heart of Hanoi’s embassy distri c t ,t h e
Vietnamese are charting the way ahead for their coun-
t ry ’s computer industry. One of the things they are
t rying to do is come up with a “Vietnamese solution”
to the millennium bug problem.It is here that part of
the future is being mapped out for a sector which the
c o u n t ry has chosen to enter at the top end of the mar-
k e t s , by moving into high-value-added activities.
The Vietnamese are not interested in dat a
inputting fa c t o ri e s. Despite approaches from seve-
ral foreign inve s t o rs , this kind of “ l ow tech” work is
not ve ry common, except at times of major nat i o n a l
surveys such as a population census.
Just as the opening-up of the economy proclai-
med in 1986 was finally getting off the gr o u n d , t h e
communist gove rnment agreed in 1993 on an ambi-
tious “master plan” to develop inform ation techno-
l o g y.The plan, which only really got going three ye a rs
ago and runs until the year 2000,declares that “ p ri o-
rity will be gi ven to developing a software industry ” .
N g u yen Kim A n h , the Moscow and Pa ri s - e d u-
c ated head of the plan’s research and training centre,s ay s
d e veloping software is the only possible way forward for
a country as poor as Viet Nam,whose per capita income
is no more than $300.She says that “neither the gove rn-
m e n t , the pri vate sector nor the unive rsities have the
money to invest seriously in hardware deve l o p m e n t .”
Tinkering students
The “master plan” c ove rs all sectors — p u b l i c
a d m i n i s t r at i o n ,with the setting-up of depart m e n t a l
socio-economic databases accessible by intranet;
banking and fin a n c e , with the dissemination of
reliable inform ation about the future stock exchange;
defence and securi t y ; and industry itself.The gove rn-
ment has promised to take steps to “help and encou-
r a g e ” public and pri vate firm s. “So fa r , our job has
been to create an environment friendly to inform a-
tion technology,” s ays Nguyen Kim A n h .“ C o m p u-
t e ri z ation of unive rsity administration and laborat o-
ries is now quite adva n c e d . But elsewhere, all we
h ave at the moment are feasibility studies.”



Viet Nam: d i v i n g
in at the deep end
The government has launched an ambitious
p roject to develop information technology. B u t
local conditions are not quite ready for it yet

The country is relying pri m a rily on its brainpo-
we r.The Vietnamese are renowned in Southeast A s i a
for their mat h e m atical and computer skills. “ O u r
students have a definite talent,” s ays Michel Mouys-
s i n at , head of the French-Speaking Wo r l d ’s Institute
for Computing (IFI),“ but they enjoy tinkering more
than working on complicated programmes which
need teamwo r k .”
N g u yen Kim Anh agr e e s :“ We ’ ve got quite good
technicians but we don’t have enough designers of
complex systems,” she say s.This is why the gove rn-
ment is trying to lure home Vietnamese computer
technicians who have gone to live in the West.The
a u t h o rities are also stepping up efforts to have
researchers trained in Europe,North America and
A u s t r a l i a .And along with help arriving through aid
o r g a n i z ations like IFI, the Vietnamese educat i o n
m i n i s t ry is encouraging the establishment of special
c o u rses at the National Unive rs i t y, at Ho Chi Minh
City Unive rsity and at Hanoi’s Polytechnic School.
Viet Nam has another advantage:its cheap but

trained workforce. “A technician is recruited at a
s t a rting salary of $250 a month,” s ays Mouyssinat .
But the market tends to push the good ones into
h i g h e r - p aying jobs, blunting their competitive edge
in relation to other poor countries. Foreign com-
panies grab the best technicians, who can negotiat e
salaries of about $800 a month after a few years.
In relation to their foreign competitors , l o c a l
firms have one handicap: politically and economi-
cally-imposed restrictions on high-speed phone
c o n n e x i o n s.The gove rnment wants to keep control
of the flow of information and the Internet service
provider in Viet Nam is a public firm with a mono-
p o l y.This means “a line supporting a 64 K modem
speed costs $3,500 a month,” s ays Michel Dau-
g u e t , a multimedia publisher in Hanoi who ru n s
the Pacific Rim company. “And even at that price,
we still don’t have access to all our foreign part-
n e rs. This hampers our business of re-export i n g
software.” ■
