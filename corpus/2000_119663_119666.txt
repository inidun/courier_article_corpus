The Atlantic Alliance officially reco-
gnized on March 21, 2000 that it
used depleted uranium ammunition
in shells in Yugoslavia during the previous
year’s war. Kosovo and southern Serbia
bore the brunt of these radioactive wea-
pons, used for the first time during the
Gulf War in 1991.They release clouds of
uranium dust that contaminate water and
the food chain. Particles enter the human
body through inhalation or ingestion,
remaining there from one to three years,
increasing the risk of steri l i t y, b i rt h
defects and cancer tenfold.
From March 24 to June 10, 1999,
NATO warplanes flying close to 31,000
s o rties bombed the entire Yu g o s l av
Fe d e r ation (Serbia, M o n t e n e gr o,
Voivodina, Kosovo). Thousands of mis-
siles were fired, some of which landed in
neighbouring Bulgaria and Macedonia.

Furthermore, many pilots flying back to
their bases dropped bombs into the
Adriatic Sea off the Croat, Slovene and
Italian coasts. According to NATO
sources, 1,600 cluster bombs, which are
banned by the Geneva Convention of 10
October 1980, were dropped, releasing
200,000 bomblets. Thousands have not
yet exploded, becoming as dangerous as
antipersonnel mines. They have already
killed nearly 200 Kosovars.
A year after the strikes,the real scale of
the environmental damage has not been
clearly established.According to the joint
UN Balkans Task Force (BTF)1, pollu-
tion has severely affected four areas:
Pancevo (20 km from Belgrade), Novi
Sad (the capital of Voivodina),Kragujevac
(southern Serbia) and Bor (near the bor-
der with Bulgaria).
The Pa n c e vo petrochemical complex
was bombed approx i m ately ten times. A
press release by the mayo r , Srdjan Mirko-
v i c, published in autumn 1999 in the Yu g o-
s l av review Petroleum Te c h n o l ogy Quart e rl y,
announced that the “direct strike on the
depot containing 1,500 tonnes of vinyl chlo-
ride monomer (VCM) caused a fire that
bu rned eight hours and destroyed approx i-
m ately 800 tonnes” of that carcinogenic sub-
s t a n c e . “When it bu rn s ,” s ays a Belgr a d e
d o c t o r , “it gi ves off, among other things,
c h l o r hy d ric acid,which causes chronic bron-
c h i t i s , d e rm atitis and gastri t i s ; as well as
d i ox i n , regarded as the wo r l d ’s most tox i c
organic pollutant; and possibly phosgene,
which was once used in chemical wa r fa r e .”
Mercury enters
the food chain
Ammonia depots used to make fertili-
zer were also bombed. Had they not been
emptied beforehand as a precaution, their
explosion would have killed any person
within a 10-kilometre radius, as direct
exposure to ammonia is lethal to humans.
The worst was avoided, but the ammonia
was released into the Danube, w h e r e
wildlife was killed 30 kilometres downs-
tream. In addition, “over 1,000 tons of
ethylene dichloride and a few thousand
tonnes of natrium hydroxide”were leaked
into the Danube, according to a report by
the Regional Environment Centre for
Central and Eastern Europe (REC).
Since then, fishing has been abandoned
and crop irrigation has become proble-
matic. The river’s sandy bed has trapped
heavy metals, which are toxic even in
small concentrations, for dozens of years.
In addition to Yugoslavia, Romania and
Bulgaria are affected.
“The soil has been contaminated by
approximately 100 tonnes of mercury,”
s ays Pa n c e vo ’s mayo r. M e r c u ry is an
extremely toxic metal that enters the food
chain and builds up in the human body,
causing irreversible organ damage. The
BTF however found that eight tonnes of
the substance had leaked from the petro-
chemical plant and reported that “the air
strikes on the oil refinery caused an esti-
mated 80,000 tonnes of oil and oil pro-
ducts to burn. This would have released
n oxious substances into the air.”
According to Belgrade’s Public Health
Institute, VCM concentrations in the air
were 10,600 times above the tolerated
norm near the Pancevo petrochemical
plant. At the time, the wind was blowing
from the west, sending the harmful fumes
into Romania and Hungary as well.
Black spring
and acid rain
The other three “ecological hotspots”
suffered a similar fate. The Novi Sad oil
refinery was bombed a dozen times bet-
ween June 5 and 9.Approximately 73,000
tonnes of crude oil and derivative pro-
ducts bu rned or leaked into pipes.
Polluted underground water seeped into
wells near the refinery, depriving the local
population of drinking water.
The strikes against the Zastava auto-
mobile factory in Kragujevac “reportedly
caused extensive environmental pollu-
tion, with damage to soil, water and air,”
reports the BTF, which detected high
l e vels of polychlori n ated bipheny l s
(PCBs).Banned in the mid-1980s becau-
se they are so toxic, these substances can
still be found in old electrical facilities.
Very persistent, they bind with sediments
in rivers and streams and degrade only
after many years.
PCB contamination and severe air pol-
lution caused by emissions of sulphur
d i oxide gas (which is especially hazardous
for asthmatics) were reported in Bor.
Bombings of copper mines, the powe r
plant and the hydrocarbon fuel depot near
Bor also affected nearby Bulgari a . T h e
S o fia newspaper 24 Hours r e p o rted that
birds fell dead out of the sky and the cloud
s p r e a d , causing acid rain. At the same
t i m e , fa rm e rs in Kosovo witnessed trees
losing their leaves in the middle of spri n g .
The entire food chain was affected,
from livestock fodder—and, c o n s e q u e n t l y,
m e at and milk—to fruits and ve g e t a b l e s
intended for consumers. Chronic bronchi-
t i s , a s t h m a , e c z e m a , d i a rrhoea and thy r o i d
d i s o r d e rs have already been detected, bu t
S e r b i a ’s officials would rather cover up the
fa c t s. W h at seems clear is that the most
s e rious health problems are yet to come.■
