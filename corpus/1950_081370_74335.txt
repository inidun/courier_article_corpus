THE CAUSE OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE
This photo, exclusive to Unesco and supplied by the University of Lyons, France, is dramatic proof
of what modern science can achieve in the fight against disease. After five months of intensive work,
scientists at the French Institute of Foot and Mouth Disease, in Lyons, isolated and photographed for
the first time this virus, the micro-organism responsible for the disease which each year causes
immense losses to the world's livestock supplies. Viruses are responsible for such diseases as small-
pox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, influenza and the common cold. The foot and mouth disease virus,
however, is the smallest hat scientists have ever had to deal with. It has a diameter of about 20
to 30 millionths of a micron, a micron being one thousandth of a millimetre. Compared with it, the
viruses of influenza and fowl pest are ados ! ten times bigger. To. discover it the French scientists used
the electron-microscope, and in. the above photograph the virus is enlarged 42. 000 times. In the
circle appear at least ten of the virus of Foot and Mouth Disease.
TWO YEW UNE : ECO
i
UNESCO'S Division for the Populariza-tion of Science (Natural Sciences De
partment) has obtained the rights
for the distribution of articles appearing
in the British science journal.'DISCO-
VERY".
These are to be distributed on an exclu-
sive basis, for a preliminary test period, to
science magazines in other parts of the
world. Science journals interested in this
service are requested to write for informa-
tion to UNESCO.
An arrangement has also been made
with Cornell University, waiving fees on
the Cornell Rural School Leaflet which,
through UNESCO, can be made available
in any country.
These leaflets are world-famous for the
simple and intimate manner in which they
enable science to be taught, often with the
sole use of everyday objects.
