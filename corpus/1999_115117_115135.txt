They have been a familiar sight across
Singapore recently: bronzed Indian
workmen clad in fluorescent orange SCV
(Singapore Cable Vision) jackets labouri n g
under the scorching sun to lay cable for the
island stat e ’s suburban neighbourhoods.T h e
rush to cable up the island is the result of an
i n i t i at i ve by the gove rnment to transform the
entire population into netizens, hooked up
by cable modem to a nationwide broadband
n e t wo r k , at a speed 100 times faster than cur-
rent ISDN Internet access.
While the idea would seem ridiculous in
a country as large as, s ay the U. S . , Brazil or
China, wiring Singapore is hardly a daun-
ting task, given a total land mass of barely
647.5 square kilometres. Dubbed Singa-
pore ONE, the national network aims to
d e l i ver a new level of interactive , m u l t i-
media applications and services to homes,
businesses and schools. The authori t i e s
claim that this effort is the first in the wo r l d
O N E i n t e l l i g e n t
i s l a n d S i n g a p o re is bidding to create a ‘ w i red’ economy
w h e re services converge on the Internet at an
u n p a ralleled pace to transform the island’s chief
re s o u rce—a well educated population—into a new
b reed of netizens
to go “live” and deliver such services to a
mass user base.
“Singapore ONE is more than just a
communication network. It will empower
Singaporeans to work efficiently in a ‘ s m a rt ’
e nv i r o n m e n t , to fa c i l i t ate the use and access
of information to enhance their business,
personal and family lives,” Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong has stated.
The gove rnment considers it crucial for
a resource-scarce country like Singapore
to equip itself for the inform ation age. S i n-
gapore’s push to carve out a place in the
global digital marketplace is especially signi-
ficant in the light of the Asian financial
c ri s i s. While some Asian countries have
been tightening controls on their markets,
Singapore is trying to open up the eco-
n o my further through a va riety of initia-
t i ve s , including ONE. Other Asian countri e s
are looking on to see whether Singapore
ONE may hold important lessons for them
in their efforts to make the most of the
information age.
With a per capita gross domestic product
of $24,600, Singapore ranks among the
wo r l d ’s top 20 richest economies. S i n g a p o r e
ONE is therefore not just a social serv i c e
from a gove rnment to its people but rather a
c rucial investment in the country ’s only
r e s o u r c e : its people.The gove rnment decision
to commit $240 million for ONE infra-
s t ructure development reflects a commit-
ment to upgrade the skills and knowledge of
its we l l - e d u c ated populat i o n .
S e rvices on offer range from banking,
s h o p p i n g, t h e atre ticket booking, and pro-
p e rty viewing to distance learn i n g . T h e
va rious virtual colleges and scholastic pro-
grammes offer eve rything from engi n e e ri n g
c o u rses to interactive multimedia cours e s
for school-kids. E n t e rt a i n m e n t , like a favo u-
rite TV programme or video, is provided on
d e m a n d . A chat on the phone with a fri e n d
is replaced by a virtual video conference.
Instead of wo rrying about what the kids are
doing at home, parents can keep an eye on
them thanks to video-conferencing, with a
web-camera sending images from home to
the personal office computer.
40,000 users
U s e rs of cable modems are charged a
subsidized flat rate of about $21 a month and
u s e rs of SingTe l ’s ADSL lines enjoy a similar
r at e . The network began a one-year pilot
phase in June 1997 and was commercially
launched the following ye a r. Only about
15,000 households have bought the pac-
k a g e .H owe ve r , the low subscription rates are
offset by the gr owing number of users ,a c c o r-
ding to officials at the National Computer
Board (NCB), the main gove rnment body
behind the project. “If you include users at
s c h o o l s , t e rt i a ry institutions, c o m m u n i t y
centres and librari e s , we have a conservat i ve
e s t i m ate of at least 40,000 users ,” said Ng
Kin Ye e , assistant director for progr a m m e
management and new media.

Ng says it is normal for new infrastru c-
ture products to experience a modest initial
u p t a k e . “Singapore ONE is not just about
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e ,i t ’s all about building the skills,
the people awareness among senior citizens,
children and their parents who might have
had a phobia for computers ,” he say s.
The gove rnment began laying the gr o u n d-
work to create an IT- l i t e r ate population for
Singapore ONE in the 1980s. To d ay more
than 40 per cent of Singapore households
own a computer and more than 350,000 out
of a population of 3 million subscribe to the
I n t e rn e t . In fa c t , Singapore has been reco-
gnized as the second most IT- l i t e r ate country
in the world after the United Stat e s by the
World Competitiveness Report , which is
published annually by the Institute for Mana-
gement Development (IMD) in Switzerland.
E-commerce on ONE
S i n g a p o r e ’s electronic-commerce—or
e-commerce, short for buying and selling
over the Intern e t — i n f r a s t ructure is equally
a d va n c e d . Online purchases can be paid
through cashcards or security credit card
p ayment systems and banks use digital cer-
t i f i c ates and smart cards to offer secure
online banking. C o m p r e h e n s i ve legi s l at i o n
is also being considered to provide an elec-
tronic transaction legal framework to encou-
rage more online commerce.
“ E - business is not just about E-com-
m e r c e ,” said Howie Lau, manager for e-bu s i-
ness solutions at Hewlett Packard Singapore.
“ E - business opens up tremendous opport u-
nities for companies to further relat i o n s h i p s
with customers , p a rt n e rs and employees by
linking internal business processes to the
I n t e rn e t .Singapore ONE could potentially be
valuable for scenarios where large amounts of
i n f o rm ation or speed of transmission are fa c-
t o rs such as the exchange of business docu-
ments with part n e rs ; s h a ring of common
i n f o rm ation within a community (e.g. r e a l
e s t ate agents sharing a common database of
p r o p e rt y ) ; realtime synchronization of multi-
m e d i a ; mobile employees gaining access to
c o rp o r ate file serve rs ,d at a b a s e s.The scena-
rios are pretty well endless.”
A l r e a d y,S i n g Tel has launched a separat e
ATM network specifically targeted at bu s i-
n e s s - t o - business transactions to complement
Singapore ONE. The focus of Singapore
O N E ’s network is to connect consumers to
businesses and gove rn m e n t .M e a n w h i l e ,S i n g-
Te l ’s ATM network connects bu s i n e s s e s ,a c a-
demic institutions and gove rn m e n t . S i n g-
Te l ’s ATM network will have connexions to
Singapore ONE and will provide it with high
speed intern ational links. Since its launch in
June last ye a r , S i n g Te l ’s ATM network has
established links to A u s t r a l i a , Hong Kong,
Japan and the U. S .There are plans for SingTe l
to be extended to Europe and other major
Asia Pa c i fic destinations this ye a r.
While some analysts anticipate that bu s i-
n e s s - t o - business transactions will take ove r
from the ori ginal consumer-based plan for
Singapore ONE,NCB’s Ng says that both
sectors can grow in tandem. “One sector
need not necessarily exclude the other,” h e
i n s i s t s. C u rr e n t l y, the 200 service prov i-
d e rs to Singapore ONE include major
s u p e rm a r k e t s , fashion and retail outlets,
b a n k s , insurance companies and books-
tores.
Retailers thinking globally
“Interactive multimedia offers infinite
possibilities for retail,” says Bernard Yang,
manager of Nanyang Optical, one of Sin-
gapore’s major optical chains which has a
site on Singapore One.“Imagine a person
watching a TCS (Television Corp o r ation of
Singapore) drama. The viewer likes the
frame wo rn by Zoe Tay (popular Singapore
a c t r e s s ) , with a click of a bu t t o n , up pops the
Focal Point (Nanyang Optical on Singa-
pore ONE) and he or she can buy and have
the same pair delivered to their doorstep.”
“Selling via the Net also means I do
not have to put up with exorbitant rentals
and expensive manpower. All I need is a
good web designer and a system adminis-
t r ator plus leased line charges. If I can make
the same sales on the Net that I do in my
shops,then I’d be a really happy guy!”
Most retailers , like Nanya n g, h ave a pre-
sence on the Internet as well as on Singapore
O N E . P r e d i c t a b l y, sales are higher on the
I n t e rnet than on ONE, simply because of
higher user rat e s.Ya n g, h owe ve r , sees it as
vital to establish a name for himself on ONE,
which he anticipates will be the main plat f o rm

for e-shopping in Singapore in the future.
Consultants say that Singapore retai-
lers on the Net should already be thinking
globally. “Some of the most successful e-
commerce websites, like Amazon.com,do
business with the whole wo r l d . So if
someone has a good idea that can be sold to
a nyone in the wo r l d , Singapore may be just
as good as any other place to start ,” said IT
consultant Jeroen Domensino. “ T h e r e
a p p e a rs to be too much concern here ri g h t
n ow over technicalities such as securi t y
i s s u e s.The truth is that elsewhere people are
already making big money via the Net,
regardless whether security issues (credit
card fraud, for example) are completely
r e s o l ve d . In the end, I think that consu-
mers all over the world are changing their
attitude towards what’s safe.”
Choosing between
the virtual and the real
Along with the gr owth in e-commerce,
multimedia software companies are expe-
riencing exponential demand.“Think of it as
H o l l y wo o d . If Hollywood made movies only
for the U. S . , it would be a limited market.We
want to be the Hollywood of multimedia,”
said Michael Ya p, N C B ’s assistant chief exe-
c u t i ve . S o f t ware deve l o p e rs hope that via
i n t e rn ational links, they will gain publicity
and future markets for their wo r k . “But we
will have to move fa s t ,” s ays Ng. “ I t ’s a fa s t
gr ow i n g, fast changing env i r o n m e n t .”
And in a small way, even local TV pro-
d u c e rs are anticipating demand in other
markets for Singapore progr a m m e s.“ T h e r e
is much potential to export our culture to
other countri e s ,” s ays James Leong of T C S
Multimedia. “We would definitely like to
push our content over the Internet as TCS
has done for television (Singapore-pro-
duced TV series have been broadcast in
Australia and Ta i wa n . ) ” C u rrently about
half of Singapore ONE subscri b e rs sub-
s c ribe to T C S ’ 1-on-One service which
o f f e rs made-in-Singapore TV sitcoms,
dramas,news and documentaries.
While software whizzkids and plucky
e n t r e p r e n e u rs in this little city state gear up
to make their name in cy b e rs p a c e , t h e r e
remains a fair amount of scepticism as to
whether ONE will ever be a real hit at home.
A video conference chat either with the
bosses or with good friends is unlikely to
gain popularity over coffee or kopi-O (locally
b r e wed black coffee) at the neighbourhood
outdoor food-stall.
Likewise video-on-demand viewed from
a 14-inch desktop monitor is likely to be a
much less at t r a c t i ve option to the ave r a g e
Singaporean compared with watching the
l atest laser discs or Video CDs on the fa m i-
l y ’s 31-inch stereo TV (the pride and joy of
most Singapore households). And in this
metropolis ove r built with malls, real shopping
as opposed to virt u a l , will likely remain the
most popular pastime, regardless of how
i n t e r a c t i ve and alluring a web-mall might be.
There will definitely be choices and
options for consumers and entrepreneurs.
Some will choose the virtual and some will
choose the real.The authorities only hope
t h at they will have equipped the populat i o n
with the IT literacy to at least exercise that
option in the next millennium. n
