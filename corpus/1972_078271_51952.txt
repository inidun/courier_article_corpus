REVERIES

IAN, with never-ending in¬
genuity, with his unending urge to
build and destroy, ever critical, alert,
nonconformist, ever disposed to call
into question, has recently begun to
ask whether the book (and why not
consider its fantastic proliferation
throughout the world?) is not now in¬
adequate as an instrument for the pro¬
pagation of culture; whether it is not
destined to be replaced by more direct
means of information, with more im¬
mediate message potential; by media
which are more complete because they
bring into play more organs of per¬
ception, associate the audible and the
visible, music with ¡mage and the
ALEJO CARPENTIER of Cuba is one of the
great contemporary novelists of Latin America.
His many books have been translated In
22 languages and include, in English editions:
'The Kingdom of this World' (1957). "The
Lost Steps" (1957), "The War of Time" (1958),
all published by Knopf, New York, and
'Explosion In a Cathedral" (Little Brown,
Boston, 1963). Carpentier Is a musicologist
and expert on the history of Cuban music.
He was formerly director of Cuba's national
publishing house In Havana and is currently
Counsellor for Cultural Affairs at the Cuban
Embassy in Paris.
word; media whose speed in analyz¬
ing a case, a fact or a conflict is un¬
surpassable and whose immediate
actualization of an event can never be
matched by the printed word bound
in books and volumes.
Disturbing and arbitrary theories
have emerged because of this, support¬
ing the thesis that culturally, the
cinema, journalism, television, which
appear to tell us more in fifty minutes,
in an hour or an hour and a half, are
more powerful than the book, the
novel or the essay which, being the
result of six or seven years of work,
force us to read and meditate for
several days in the little time at our
disposal after daily occupations and
earning a living. "Voire", as Panurge
would have said, driving his sheep into
the immense sea of hypothesis.
However, the strait-laced censors
adopt a different position, criticizing
with surprising ignorance as novelty,
as a new phenomenon typical of the
evil spirit of the times in which we live,
the tastes of our century.
And to begin with the simplest in
order to proceed to more complex
matters, let us consider the lamenta¬
tions and the anathema, which mem¬
bers of the "Holy Office" of a certain
kind of culture utter against "comics",
those comic strips which our children
like so much and which we older peo¬
ple without children have also enjoyed
over the years.
This fashion for comic strips is
blamed for the fact that new genera¬
tions are abandoning reading. But
those who argue in this way too eas¬
ily forget that the spirit and technique
of the comic strip that is, the narra¬
tion of facts, by means of a succes¬
sion of images in anticipation of the
cinema was already perfectly dev¬
eloped in the codices of Mexico which
narrate, through a sequence of scenes
and figures, the conquest and the
events leading up to the twilight of
the Aztec Empire. They show us
how La Malinche was dressed and the
costume worn by Cortes. And what
is the beautiful Bayeux tapestry but
a chronicle of the Norman conquest
of England, using the figurative tech¬
niques of the comic strip?

"If the invention of the ship was
thought so noble, which carrieth riches
and commodities from place to place,
and consociateth the most remote
regions in participation of their fruits,
how much more are books to be
magnified, which as ships, pass through
the vast seas of time, and make ages
so distant to participate of the wisdom,
illuminations and inventions, the one
of the other?"

It was the great Swiss humorist,
Rodolphe Toeppfer, who during the
last century initiated the comic strip
as we know it today with his Dr. Festus
(1840). In 1889-1893, the French writer
and illustrator Christophe followed
the road traced by Toeppfer with his
now classic Famille Fenouillard, and
also his Sapeur Camember (1890-
1896).
When I was a child, before the
First World War, there were a number
of mass-circulation children's news¬
papers in Paris: Le Petit Illustré, Le
Cri-Cri, L'Intrépide, La Semaine de
Suzette, L'Epatant with the unforget¬
table adventures of the Pieds Nickelés
by the humorist, Forton, which in time
also became a classic.
Contemporaneously English children
were following the tricks and tribula¬
tions of Buster Brown and his dog
(1902). And towards the year 1913, the
great Bud Fisher in the United States
invented those extraordinary charac¬
ters, Mutt and Jeff, who for more than
forty years figured in the pages of
newspapers, along with Bringing up
Father by George McManus, Popeye
of the energizing spinach, Tarzan, Terry
and the Pirates, Superman, Mandrake
the Magician, and his extraordinary
adventures all of which inspired a
new mythology which still draws us to
the pages of our newspapers.
But all this, Lord Censors of the
Holy Office of Culture, has not stop¬
ped the publication and re-publication,
the many translations of Tolstoy, of
Pirandello, Marcel Proust, James Joyce,
Thomas Mann, Hermann Broch (I
do not wish to prolong this extremely
facile ennumeration of great names)
whom the ordinary public of the
last century would have considered
"difficult" not to say unreadable.
Science fiction? It is a literary genre
which has always existed. Its class¬
ical writers include Luciano de Samo-
sata, the medieval author of a
Romance of Alexander (the Great) who
descends to the bottom of the sea in a
glass ball, Orlando Furioso who swims
across the ocean, Cyrano de Bergerac
with his trip to the moon. Swift, the
inexhaustible Swift, H. G. Wells whose
The First Men in the Moon, The War
of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, The
Island of Dr. Moreau were my intel¬
lectual sustenance at the age of
thirteen.
The serial? The novels of chivalry
were serial stories with Amadis de
Gaule in the vanguard; serials (and
good ones) were the works of Xavier
de Montepin, Emile Gaboriau, Eugene
Sue, at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, up to that super-serial (which
also has marvellous literary qualities)
Les Misérables, by Victor Hugo, the
first great best-seller of world litera¬
ture, a book that still has a vast public
in the whole Spanish-speaking world
to the point where the employees in
the Cuban cigar and cigarette facto¬
ries, who are read to while they work,
periodically request by popular acclaim
a new rendering of the story of Jean
Valjean.
The serial as we daily view it on
the television screen did not do the
slightest harm to the development of
Balzac's mighty work, nor did it hin¬
der the pre-surrealist poetic stirrings
of the older Victor Hugo, nor the slow,
universal and sure distribution of the
works of Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

REVERIES OF A READER (Continued)
After the unrivalled dominion of
Victor Hugo, author of Hernani, Emile
Zola was the second author of best¬
sellers in Europe before Tolstoy and
without forgetting Dickens the wide¬
spread popularity of whose works
came later. Nor should we forget that
whilst Zola's genius reaches its height
in Nana, in L'Assommoir and Germinal,
this great writer had begun his career
with books like Thérèse Raquin and
Les Mystères de Marseille which were
little different from the worst serial
now seen on the television screens of
the world.
And who was it who selected, made
immortal and caused the great and
authentic works of Zola to be trans¬
lated whilst ignoring the trivial and
superfluous? The reading public.
Similarly, the cinema public has
been able to forget the dreadful melo¬
dramas starring Francesca Bertini,
Gustavo Serena, ítala Almirante Man-
cini, Hesperia, etc., which Cines of
Rome and Ambrosio of Milan used to
give us at the beginning of the cen¬
tury, and to retain the unforgettably
great films (I refer to the mature
works) of a Chaplin.
The public has, in the end, develop¬
ed a critical sense which, while not
preventing them from appreciating the
informational, recreative and even the
instructive value of the mass media,
increasingly turns towards the "Book"
and I intentionally write Book with
a capital "B".
For the Book, despite the specula¬
tion and ridicule of those "distillers
of the fifth essence" as Rabelais
would have called them, continues to
flourish day by day; it is gaining more
ground and winning more readers.
One key fact which speaks for itself
demonstrates this and would convince
a child whose culture had not advanc¬
ed beyond Tarzan and Superman.
Publishing houses are growing in
number in an astonishing fashion
throughout the world.
And the publisher is a man who lives
and prospers on this strange, poor and
apparently unproductive merchandise
the book. Poor because its produc¬
tion implies long-term investment and
involves spending money on the pub¬
lication of a book by an unknown
author which, at best, will cover the
costs in one year or two (if ever).
In order to prosper, the publisher
must organize a distribution network,
look after publicity, and attempt to
impress on the unheeding passer-by
the title of a novel, a book of poetry
or essays his firm has produced. All
this implies a concern unknown to
other types of businessmen who sell
the public articles of everyday utility.
Reading is, in a certain sense, a
luxury. The book is bought with the
money left over when people have
spent what is needed to acquire every¬
thing else, that is, all their daily neces¬
sities.
Yet, let us consider publishing on a
world scale. We do not need to

mention France, Germany, England
and all the other countries which
have a long-standing tradition in
the field; but during my childhood,
publishing houses in Latin America
could almost be counted on the
fingers of the two hands. There were
printers, of course, who, in return for
a certain sum of money, published
(never more than 2,000 copies) books
that were either the work of eminent
professors or of well-known poets, or
of essayists whose names were
familiar from the newspapers.
When the edition was printed, the
author had to pick it up himself and
distribute it personally to the book¬
sellers where it was received with
reluctance if not with hostility ("All
right. Leave me a few copies, but I'm
not very hopeful...").
After all his labour and disappoint¬
ment, the writer was usually left with
a thousand or so unsold copies which
were stored in the cellar or the attic
of his home, sometimes consigned
to oblivion in rare cases, rediscover¬
ed because of the retrospective curi¬
osity of a later generation which sud¬
denly discovered a precursor in our
poor author who had already passed
on without further ado. (We make an
exception of the continental reputa¬
tion of Ruben Dario, but let us also
remind ourselves of how little the over¬
whelming greatness of Cesar Vallejo
was understood when he was still
among us.)
Moreover, the attitude of the public
all over the world has changed to¬
wards the book (I am not referring, of
course, to the developing countries
where one cannot speak of a reading
public for the simple reason that an
immense proportion of human beings
in such places cannot read or write).
Since each person draws his obser¬
vations and conclusions from some
personal experience, I recall my
father's and grandfather's generation
for they were, in their time, regarded
as highly cultivated people.
Of what did their education consist?
Of everything that was necessary in
order to exercise their professions
with decency and sometimes with real
talent. My grandfather was a lawyer,
my father an architect. They were up
to date in all that could be useful and
could increase their skill in their res¬
pective professions. But for the rest?
They were cultivated men, considered
to be extremely cultivated in the cul¬
tured circles in which they moved.
But of what did their culture consist?
In the humanities, they knew the
Greek, Latin and Medieval classics,
the writers of the great ages of Spain,
France and England, German roman¬
ticism, the literature of the nineteenth
century and of the contemporary
period.
In their conversation, they spoke in¬
telligently of Balzac, Flaubert, Zola,
Dostoevski, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Galdós,
Pió Baroja, Valle Inclán and, of cour¬
se, of poets and dramatists whose
names have, in many cases, fallen into
the most cruel oblivion.
They had some notion of philo¬
sophy. They knew a great deal about
history, especially Michelet. In other
fields, they had naturally read Darwin,
Haeckel, Le Bon, Renan, Taine, Emer¬
son, although they did so sporadically
and without any great diligence. For
the rest, they believed that philosophy
was better left to the philosophers (a
group of people whose activity is
rather difficult to define, if we agree
with the amusing essay of Raymond
Queneau); archaeology was for the
archaeologists, sociology for sociolo¬
gists, science for scientists.
. As for politics Ohl as for politics
sleight of hand is a "game for the
vulgar", my grandfather used to say.
Anatole France, aesthete with dilet¬
tante tastes in philosophy, politics and
everything, author of lives of saints in
which he did not believe, a real
touche-à-tout, as the French would
say, was, it should not be forgotten,
the master of a whole characteristic
generation of the time.
Let us look today into the windows
of a bookshop in Paris, London, Buen¬
os Aires, Mexico, Havana, or any¬
where. There, novels are displayed on
equal terms with books which deal
with the excavations of Sumer, Crete,
Mexico or Peru; everyone of my gen¬
eration has read Freud, Jung, Lacan
(and I shall keep the list brief); they
have read Marx, Engels, Gramsci,
Lukacs; there are books of philosophy
which in these recent years, have be¬
come true best-sellers; cybernetics,
science, the exploration of space (new
forms of science fiction but this time
with real men stepping onto the moon)
passionately interest a whole genera¬
tion.
There are more and more book
series; art books are now cheaper;
lives of composers, histories of music,
treatises on organography ad-usum
delphini (all with the appropriate
gramophone records), politics, contem¬
porary history, present-day sociology,
discoveries, the exploration of the
planet, structuralism, Levi-Strauss, and
so on (1).
The reading public grows larger,
more curious every day, with a grea¬
ter thirst for discovery, more power
of assimilation, with the desire to reach
regions which were yesterday unknown
to them. And because of this, one is
not surprised by the fact that pub-

Ushers last century (save in the excep¬

media cannot replace that unrivalled
lonely meditation before the printed
pages which constitutes reading.
To this it might be objected that
there persists the terrible problem of
the developing countries in which
great masses of human beings can¬
not write their own names on a piece
of paper. But this is related to another
problem, that of intensive and massive
education which must begin at the
moment when the child speaks the
first words of its language.
And that problem is not solved by
publishing a greater or lesser number
of books, nor does the Divine Comedy
have any role in places where the pos¬
session of a handful of rice or a crumb
of bread is the immediate problem, a
problem whose tardy solution is a
motive for shame among the men of
our time. But that is a well-known
problem even though some people pur¬
posely and ignobly overlook it. Hence
the equation is not expressible in
terms of culture and reading but of
systems.
If there is hunger for books and
this is completely certain in the
developed countries, there exists near
at hand hunger of another kind which
necessarily excludes hunger for liter¬
ature.
And in the face of this fact, let us
not assume the absurd position of the
Proustian lady whose great concern
during the 1914-1918 war was that the
baker should deliver her morning crois¬
sants despite wartime rationing
croissants which were the decoration
and delight of a breakfast prudently
eaten before reading the newspaper
which might bring bad news of the
allied armies' position at the Front.
