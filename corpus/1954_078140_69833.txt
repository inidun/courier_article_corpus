AN ANCIENT TIME-KEEPER was the Tower of the Winds in Athens (left). Before the door once stood a sun-dial. A water-clock within told time in cloudy weather.
In one form of such clocks, water dripped through a tiny hole at the bottom of a jar exposing marks telling the hours. At right, two Borneo tribesmen
measure the shadow cast by a stick of fixed length at noon on successive days. When the shadow begins to shorten from its maximal length the time for
preparing the land is near at hand. (Photo left: Copyright R. Viollet; right: British Museum).
THE earth on which we live is a globe,
spinning around on its axis once a
day, revolving in its great orbit
around the sun once a year, and with the
moon revolving around the earth once a
month. It is not an accident, nor is it
good planning, that these three motions
fit so neatly into our time-scale of days,
months and years. The truth is that the
motions are what they are, and have been
for countless millions.of centuries, deter¬
mined by celestial forces since" long
before man appeared on the earth. It
takes just a day for the earth to turn
once on its axis because the word was
made ,to fit the motion. A day is defined
as the length of time it takes for that
rotation. So, too, the words "month" and
' "year" were made to express astronomical
motions that man cannot alter.
Since those three independent astro¬
nomical motions are beyond human
control, we must take them as they are.
It is awkward that they are not related
to each other in any simple numerical
way. It would be much simpler if they
The ancient Egyptians devised many types
of calendar keeping. Their stone obelisks
(left) helped to keep a record of time as the
shadows varied during the different seasons.
The east-west layout of the Pyramids of Gizeh
also enabled the Egyptians to observe the
equinoxes, and when the rays of the setting
sun shone directly down the long avenue of
columns at Karnak it announced the evening
of the summer solstice. Shift to proposed
World Calendar (inset) is to be considered
by U.N. this year.- (Photo R. Viollet).
were arranged by the decimal system, for
instance, so that there Were ten days in
a month and a hundred days in a year.
Or perhaps by the dozen, with twelve
days in a month and twelve months in a
year. But nothing can be done about
that. The fact is that the moon makes
its circuit around the earth in 29 1/2 days,
while the earth makes a complete circuit
of its orbit' in close to 365 1/4 days. Even
without the fractions, these are odd
numbers and there is no simple relation
between them. That is the fundamental
problem of the calendar, with which men
have struggled for thousands of years.
Days must be counted and for human
affairs must be arranged in some sort of
order. There must be established periods
for business, for the seasons and for
. holidays and holy days. But the day does
not fit either the period of the moon or
of the sun, the month or the year. Most
ancient peoples in all parts of the earth
originally chose the motions of the moon
as the basis of a calendar, probably
because the moon's motion is easier to
observe. . So the Babylonian and Egyptian
calendars of six thousand years ago were
based on periods of the moon, and the
Chinese calendar four thousand years
ago also. In ancient Greece, every month
began with the full moon but the year
was counted independently as 365 days.
The Romans combined the two. For
them the year, of 365 days, was basic and
they gave it twelve months, irregular in
length, and not exactly related to the
moon's motion, as we do now. Then
Julius Caesar, in 45 B.C., allowed for that
extra quarter-day in the true year by
giving every fourth year 366 days,' and
thus established "leap-year". That made
the "Julian calendar" which was used
into modern times.
But it was not accurate enough. The
year is not exactly 365 1/4 days long.
It is 365 days, ¡plus 5 hours, 48 minutes
and 45.51 seconds. That is 11 minutes
and 14.49 seconds less than 365 and one-
quarter days. That is not much, but is
enough to amount to 19 hours in a
century and in 1,000 years to make the
calendar about a week behind schedule.
This is precisely what happened under
Julius Caesar's calendar. By the year
1582 A.D., the vernal equinox, when the
sun begins moving northward again and
so marks the first day of spring (autumn
in the Southern Hemisphere), was 10
days late. It came on March eleventh,
although the Council of Nïcea of the
Roman Catholic Church had decreed in
325 A.D. that it was to fall on March
twenty-first. There was nothing to do
but to correct the calendar by taking out
ten days. This was logically and con¬
scientiously done by Pope Gregory XIII.
He directed that the day after October 4,
1582, should be called October 15. Thus
the present, or Gregorian, calendar was
established.
It was immediately adopted by all
Roman Catholic countries but was
resisted by both the Protestant and the
Eastern nations. Thus for several cen¬
turies there was a difference of ten days
(and later even more) in the two systems
of numbering and naming the days.
Great Britain and her colonies did not
adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752
and Sweden followed the next year. It
was adopted by Japan in 1873, by China

ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY. From China to Britain stone circles, avenues and menhirs were built over a period of several millenia to serve as astronómica


observatories. One of Britain's earliest sun-calendars is shown here. At Stonehehge (2,000 B.C.), on the morning of the summer solstice, the sun rising behind
the Slaughter Stone was aligned by the Friar's Heel Stone to a point within the Sanctuary. It was the signal that the new year had begun. The principle Is
similar to that used at Karnak, Egypt, the difference being that the temple at Stonehenge pointed to the sun rising at the summer solstice, while the temple of
Karnak pointed to the sun setting at the summer solstice. (Photo by Dr. J.K. St. Joseph, University of Cambridge. Crown Copyright reserved.)
in 1912, by the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, in 1918, by Rumania and
Greece in 1924 and by Turkey in 1927.
Simple as the change was in reality, it
was very difficult to put into effect. In
England there was an enormous outcry:
"Give us back our eleven days!" People
thought they were losing eleven days of
their lives instead of merely changing
the names and numbers. So too, today
there are people who think they are
losing an hour of life when daylight-
saving time is introduced and five o'clock
is called six. It is human to resist
change even when it is only a change of
a name or a number.
Pope Gregory made another change to
give the calendar its modern form: he
began the year on January first. Some
nations had begun it on December 25,
some on March 25, as England did, for
instance, until 1752. But the numbering
system had been adopted a thousand
years earlier. In what we now call the
sixth century A.D., a, Roman abbot
named Dionysius Exiguus proposed that
the years should be counted from the
birth of Christ. This was gradually
adopted all over the world, with A.D.
standing for the Latin words "Anno
Domini", meaning "Year of our Lord".
(Actually, modern scholars have found
that Christ was probably born four years
earlier than was thought in the days of
-Dionysius, hence in the year 4 B.C.)
Thus, after repeated changes and cor¬
rections, our calendar has come to us
unchanged for almost 400 years.
How much longer will it serve? There
are many reasons for improving it and
few reasons for opposing any change
except the enormous inertia of habit.
Astronomically it is now correct enough;
the seasons come when they should and,
with the several amendments of the
leap-year rule, they always will. But for
human affairs, and especially for the
conduct of modern business, the calendar
has many awkward features.
The two halves of the year are not
equal, for one thing. The first half has
181 days, the second has 184. Most
people work three extra days during the
second half, without extra pay. So, too,
the quarters vary from 90 to 92 days, and
the months from 28 to 31. The number
of working days in a month (at six days
a week) varies from, 24 to 27. All these
irregularities are unfair to someone and
cause endless irregularities in statistics,
such as banking figures, because months
and seasons cannot properly be compared
with each other.
Another serious defect of the calendar
is that the first day of the month is a
wanderer among the days of the week;
it may be on any day from Sunday
through Saturday and it will not be the
same next year as this year. Thus any
calendar holiday, like December 25, may
come on any day of the week while any
religious holiday, such as Easter may fall
on any date in the month. Only once in
28 years is the calendar exactly re¬
produced.
All this leads to many difficulties in
setting the dates for special holidays,
fairs, elections, the opening of the
legislature, and other public events. At
least in industrial countries it would be
very desirable to have such events as
Christmas and the national holiday fall
always on a Monday in order to give a
"long weekend".
And not to be forgotten are those
unfortunates who were born on February
29 and can have a birthday celebration
only once in four years. Worst of all,
perhaps, is that no one can really know
the calendar as he knows the alphabet. .
There are many who cannot remember
how many days there, are in any par¬
ticular month, August for instance!
Everyone must look to a printed calendar
to keep his dates in mind. Much money-
and paper is wasted annually in all
countries just to keep printed calendars
available to everyone. . In short, the
calendar is complicated and irregular so
that there have been many suggestions
for its improvement, which have recently
grown in number.
The French Revolution adopted a
reform that did not last, which had
twelve months of thirty days each, with
three "decades", or ten-day weeks, per
month. This accounts for only 360 days,
so that there was a five-day holiday
period before the start of the new year,
which began on September 22. Since
then there have been many proposals.
In 1849, Auguste Comte advocated a year
of thirteen 28-day months. This takes

days, so that he added a single day
as a year-end holiday. This calendar
had the advantage that the days of the
week always fell on the same dates of the '
month. . /
More recently the League of Nations
examined no less than 152 different
suggestions for improving the calendar.
One of them had a year of 73 weeks, each
week having five days with every fifth
day a holiday. Another had 20 months,
each of three six-day weeks, with leap-
weeks that had seven days five times a
year. Another had a year of twelve
30-day months which were divided into
five six-day weeks. After long study, the
League decided that the week of seven
days should not be changed and eli¬
minated from consideration all proposals
except two.
One was a calendar of thirteen months,
each with 28 days. The other was a
calendar of twelve months with 30 or 31
days in each, but 91 days in each quarter.
Both added up to 364 days and left one
day over as a special holiday. Both of
them retained the seven-day week.
The second of these calendars was the
"World Calendar" which was submitted
to the League by the delegate for Chile.
When submitted to the member nations,
14 were in favour of it, 6 were opposed,
7 considered it premature, and 18 made
no comments. As a result, the fourteen
years of study which the League gave to
calendar reform ended in 1937 with a
committee recommendation to the effect
that "it is not expedient, for the time
being, to contemplate convening a
Conference to carry out a reform which
in present circumstances would have no
chance of being accepted".
But the agitation for a better calendar
,has not ended. Now it is the Economic
and Social Council of the United Nations
which has received calendar drafts from
many countries and from many inter¬
national organizations. In 1950, Peru
submitted the same "World Calendar"
that had been considered by the League
of Nations. Most recently, in October
1953, the delegation of India asked that
the World Calendar be taken up at the
next session of the Economic and Social
Council. In submitting it, the Govern¬
ment of India stated:
"Such a revision has been the subject
of study and research on the part of
experts, institutions and international
organizations for many years. The
concensus of opinion is that a new time
system is necessary, adhering to the
customary twelve months; but that it
should be uniform an invariable ca¬
lendar, perpetually the same, more
regular, scientific and advantageous from
every point of view than the present
Gregorian calendar... The proposed
scheme of The World Calendar has
overcome the drawbacks of the present
calendar. It is scientific, uniform, stable
and perpetual, with but one unvarying
calendar every year."
This World Calendar is reproduced on
page 28.
Its chief characteristics are that each
of the four quarters is the same length,
91 days, and that the first day of each
quarter, and therefore of each half-year
and year, begins on the same day,
Sunday. The first month of each quarter
has 31 days and the next two have 30.
It is therefore more like our present
calendar than the other proposals that
have been made. Its one defect is an
inevitable one, that the year cannot be
divided into seven-day weeks without one
day being left over, because 52 times 7 is
364.
This one day; as in many other ca¬
lendar ideas, would remain as a year-end
holiday. It is proposed to call it "World's
Day" and to celebrate it throughout the
world as an international holiday. The
Indian proposal to the United Nations
describes this day as dedicate'd "to the
universal harmony and unity of man¬
kind". In leap-years, every four years,
a similar holiday would-be inserted and
observed between the 30th of June and
the first of July.
Among the advantages that have been
listed for this calendar are: the first day
of the first month is always a Sunday;
that of the second month is a Wednesday,
and that of the third month is a Friday.
It is a tidy arrangement. There will be
five Sundays in the first month of every
quarter and five Saturdays in the third
month. There will be exactly 52 weekly
pay-days every year.
Best of all, the calendar will be per-
The twelve signs'of the Zodiac in stained glass at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. The zodiac is an imaginary
belt in the skies through which the sun passes each month. Each sign is named after a constellation in that
part of the zodiac 2,000 years ago; but since then the sun and stars have moved and none of the constella¬
tions are in their former zodiacal place. (Photo Viollet).

manent and in future years it will always
be possible to know exactly on what day
of the week any date occurred or when
it will occur in the future. It would be
exactly the same in any year. Railways
would not have to make up new time-
schedules each year. Everyone would
know that Christmas day is always on
Monday. Banks and business houses
would appreciate the fact that the end
of every quarter falls on a Saturday so
that accounts can be closed for the
beginning of the new quarter. Radio and
television stations would be able to count
on exactly thirteen weeks in every
quarter. School terms, too, would profit
by being placed permanently in an un¬
changing calendar.
But there are objections, too. . Many
people will oppose the change merely
because it is a change. But one serious
objection is religious, chiefly because once
in every year and twice in leap-years
more than six days would intervene
between two successive Sabbath days.
Another objection is that the calendar
would be uniform and would destroy
variety which ia the spice of life.
Still another objection is that some
persons who were born on the 31st of
March, for instance, would lose their
birthdays altogether, for if this calendar
is adopted there will be no more thirty-
first days of March, May, August and
December. On the other hand, there
would be four days on which no one has
yet had a birthday because those days,
February 30, April 31, "World's Day" and
the leap year day, are not on the present
calendar. On the other hand, persons
born on February 29 would have a
birthday every year. But these consid¬
erations apply only to persons born
before the adoption of the new calendar.
They would be forgotten after that.
The Indian proposal to the Economic
and Social Council makes it clear why
the U.N. should take up the question of
Calendar reform now. The present
Gregorian and the proposed World Ca¬
lendar coincide on Sunday, January 1
1956, so that the change could be made
at that time with a minimum of fuss, and
everybody would have two years to
prepare for the new calendar.
