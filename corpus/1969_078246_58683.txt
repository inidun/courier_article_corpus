MY
FIRST
STEPS
IN
SPACE
By Aleksei Leonov
March 18. 1965 is a date that will
be remembered in the history of
astronautics. On that day, Aleksei
Leonov became the first man to
leave a space vehicle and walk in
outer space. This article was
specially written for the "Unesco
Courier" by Aleksei Leonov him¬
self and published in our June
1965 issue.
0INLY the unforgettable mo¬
ments at the take-off and the recollec¬
tion of the long months of flight training
forced me to believe in the reality
of the scene that unfolded before my
eyes as I viewed the spaceship while
I floated through the vacuum of space.
Voskhod II sailed with an awesome
majesty, its antennae like the whis¬
kers of some monster probing the
emptiness of space. Its portholes
looked like enormous eyes contemp¬
lating fixedly my every movement.
Before me blackness: an inky-black
sky studded with stars that glowed
but did not twinkle; they seemed immo¬
bilized. Nor did the sun look the same
as when seen from Earth. It had no
aureole or corona; it resembled a huge
incandescent disc that seemed em¬
bedded in the velvet black of the sky
of outer space.
Below me our sky-blue planet drifted
by. It did not look round but complete¬
ly flat, like a giant physical map. Only
the curvature of the horizon showed
that it was round.
Four years ago my countryman Yuri
Gagarin, spent only 108 minutes in
space. Today manned spacecraft make
flights lasting several days.
In the future, space vehicles will be
spending more and more time in orbit,
and there will probably be several in
flight at the same time. The number
of crew members will also increase.
Scientists are already studying the
problem of setting up permanent
stations in orbit. Man will naturally
want to explore other planets.
But if this is to be possible man
must learn to assemble heavy space¬
craft directly in orbit. He must be
able to pick up the crews of orbiting
space laboratories, move from one
ship to another in cases of emergency

or simply maintain contact with fellow
human beings during interplanetary
flight.
For this to be feasible, man had to
learn to leave his spacecraft and find
the best way of doing so. But the
question arose was it possible for
man to leave a space vessel and sur¬
vive? Could he carry out the assembly
work that is indispensable to the ren¬
dezvous of spacecraft?
Pavel Belyayev, commander of
Voskhod II, and I had the good fortune
of being chosen for the space flight
of March 18 that aimed to give the
first answers to these questions.
Commander Belyayev started pre¬
paring me for my exit from the craft
when we were over Kamchatka. He
helped me to put on the cylinder
containing my air supply. I checked
the connexions linking my breathing
mixture to the spacesuit. Belyayev
opened the inner door of the air
lock. Together we fastened to my
spacesuit the tether-cable that would
keep me attached to the ship. I un¬
strapped myself from the seat and
floated into the chamber of the air lock.
I gave a hand signal to the com¬
mander. The inner door closed behind
me. Belyayev began to empty the
chamber of air in order to equalize the
pressure with that outside the ship.
I could feel this happening from the
way my spacesuit became inflated.
I made my way forward in the lock
toward the exit and poked a bit of my
head out. We were over the Mediter¬
ranean. I was in a hurry to leave the
lock, get a look at the Earth from space
and see the ship.
Belyayev signalled me to cast off.
In my impatience to get out, I pushed
off too vigorously from the edge of
the air lock and left the ship like a
cork popping from a bottle. Below
directly underneath me was the
Crimea. I saw the Black Sea, the
blue swath of the bay near Novo-
rossisk, the cloud-capped mountains
of the Caucasus.
I found myself spinning and was
powerless to control it. I had had the
same experience when Belyayev and
I were practising in the aeroplane-
laboratory the technique of exit and
re-entry under conditions of weight¬
lessness. So I did nothing about it.
I merely waited for the kinking of the
tether to slow down the rotations.
And, as I expected, the angular mo¬
mentum decreased little by little. I
was, of course, still turning on a
transversal axis. I could have check¬
ed this by grabbing hold of the tether,
but I preferred to keep on rolling
because this enabled me to see better.
Below, the majestic green mountain
ranges of the south of the U.S.S.R.
floated by. I recognized the Volga;
then I saw the Urals, and the mighty
Siberian rivers, the Ob and the Yenisei.
I removed the lens guard of the
motion picture camera that was to
photograph all of my movements in
the vacuum of space. It was mounted
on a special stand near the edge of
the air lock. A moment later, to pull
myself foward, I tugged rather vigor¬
ously at the tether and found the
ship bearing down .on me. I warded
it off with my hands, otherwise I might
have knocked my pressurized helmet
against its hull. By stretching out my
arms I was able to break the impact.
It is clear that once man has adapted
himself to the extraordinary conditions
in space, he can move about in a
co-ordinated and precise manner.
While in space, I was constantly in
telephonic contact with Pavel Belyayev
and with Earth. I spoke to Yuri
Gagarin who was on duty in the control
room of the spaceport.
While over the Yenisei, Commander
Belyayev gave me the signal to re¬
enter the ship. I was feeling wonder¬
ful and was in no hurry to leave open
space. So I pushed off once again
from the edge of the air lock as 1
wanted to find out what produced the
angular movements immediately follow¬
ing the push-off. It turned out that
these movements were caused by even
the slightest displacement in the angle
of the force of thrust in relation to the
axis of the space capsule.
I then carried out Commander Bel-
yayev's order and began to approach
the ship. On the way I picked up the
camera from its support.
I wanted to enter the air lock di¬
rectly, but this was far from easy.
The inflated spacesuit constricted my
movements. I had to use all of my
strength to re-enter the air lock. But
before long I was back in the cabin
alongside Pavel Belyayev.
So ended the experiment in which
a man climbed out of a capsule into
space. I had spent twenty minutes
outside the cabin. During this time,
Voskhod II had gone far. from the
Mediterranean over which we had
been travelling when I first went into 00
the air lock; we were now approach- *
ing the Pacific Ocean.
