The complex effects of intern ational migr at i o n
t o d ay touch the lives of more people and loom
politically and economically larger in more
c o u n t ries and more world regions than ever before.
The phenomenon’s causes, h owe ve r ,h ave remained
largely the same: economic and personal insecuri t y,
i n t o l e r a n c e , economic and political exclusion,
o p p r e s s i o n , va rious forms of chaos and cat a s t r o p h e ,
conflict and war.
Most of these conditions, h owe ve r , are typically
not sufficient to start or suddenly expand a
migr ation flow to a substantial degr e e . For that to
h a p p e n , c e rtain preconditions must already be in
p l a c e . Most notable among them are the pre-
existence of a long-term political and economic
r e l at i o n s h i p ; the presence of an anchor ethnic
community in the country of destination that can
a d vo c ate the admission of an immigrant group and
assist with its transport ation and integr at i o n ; a
loosely regulated labour market that values and
can absorb newcomers effective l y ; and an ove r a l l
philosophical opposition to the circumstances
m i grants are attempting to leave by key
constituencies in the prospective destinat i o n
country.
Moving towards
control and exclusion
These preconditions have become easier to
meet over the last two decades, and as a result
i n t e rn ational migr at i o n ’s reach is now global.
H e n c e , it is more important than ever to take stock
of its dimensions and signific a n c e , p a rt i c u l a r l y
because interest and reliance on it by the South are
intensifying while responses to it by the Nort h
(increasingly geared toward control and exclusion)
are converging more than ever before.
The unive rs a l i z ation of intern ational migr at i o n
and the realization that most forms of it are highly
likely to continue and expand require that we
understand it better than we do now.This need is
also urgent because the North is in the throes of a
fundamental intellectual reappraisal of the value of
most migr at i o n . I propose that we think of
international migration as a system,rather than as
a series of events. Doing so allows the analysis to
encompass migr ation processes regardless of the
causes and characteristics of a specific flow, o f
whether it is organized or spontaneous,
“ p e rm a n e n t ” or “ t e m p o r a ry ” , legally sanctioned
or “ i rr e g u l a r.” It also allows the analyst to move
b e yond the dichotomies that classify states as either
“ s e n d i n g ” or “ r e c e i v i n g ” , reasons for leaving as
either to improve one’s economic circumstances or
to protect oneself from pers e c u t i o n , and people
who move as either permanent settlers or
temporary residents.
A two-way system
of arrivals and departures
To d ay, most states simultaneously send and
r e c e i ve immigr a n t s. S i m i l a r l y, most people move
for complex combinations of economic, s o c i a l ,
cultural and political reasons.The ideal cat e g o ri e s
on which legal classifications of prospective
i m m i grants are based are increasingly unable to
a c c o m m o d ate this complex mix of motive s. T h e
resulting confusion makes the fit between theory
and reality tenuous and undermines popular
s u p p o rt for a country ’s entire admissions system.
F u rt h e rm o r e , “ p e rm a n e n t ” i m m i grants often
m ove to yet another destination or return to their
homes (as many as half the members of most
i m m i grant groups that came to the United Stat e s
in the first half of the twentieth century had
r e t u rned to their homes by the 1950s). F i n a l l y,
large proportions of “ t e m p o r a ry ” m i grants stay
abroad for long periods of time with or without
the authori z ation to do so, or conve rt to perm a n e n t
s t at u s.
U n d e rstanding intern ational migr ation properly
is important for another reason.The quality (and
effectiveness) of policies cannot be better than the
analysis that helps policy makers understand an

Some 120 million persons may,
like this woman,live outside
their country of origin.
Today, most states simultaneously send and receive immigrants.
Similarly, most people move for complex combinations of economic,
social, cultural and political reasons

issue and supports the response. Hence, it should
be no surp rise when a poorly-conceived policy fa i l s
to “solve” the problem. And when politics enters
the mix, the prescription may be even further off the
mark.
The following example demonstrates both
points vividly. When the United States either
m i s u n d e rstands or disregards the motivations of
m a ny irregular Mexican migrants—who may prefer
to have a “sojourner”relationship to the US—and
ignores the social and economic fundamentals that
make such workers attractive to US employers,its
policy responses of tighter border controls and the
e q u i vocal prohibition of unauthorized employ m e n t
will not address effectively the complex challenge of
irregular migration from Mexico. In fact,the most
predictable consequences of such policies are as
f o l l ow s : a) that they would turn short - t e rm
migrants into long-term immigrants; b) that they
would fuel the gr owth of increasingly fraudulent
documents and organized trafficking industri e s ;
and c) that they would undermine the quality of
working conditions for a l l wo r k e rs active in the
same sectors as irregular wo r k e rs (whose
increasingly tenuous status makes them accept
virtually any conditions of work).This is precisely
what has happened.
If the scope of the issue is so broad and the
politics surrounding it so complex—a n d
deteriorating—wh at about migr at i o n ’s magnitude?
Roughly 120 million persons may live outside their
c o u n t ries of ori gi n . Most of them enter other
s t at e s , especially those in the Nort h , through highly
r e g u l ated channels. Excluding refugees, who at any
point comprise about 20 per cent of that total,
family reunific ation migrants and legal temporary
wo r k e rs are the two largest components of the total
n u m b e r.
It is important to note that total immigr at i o n
has gr own at an evo l u t i o n a ry, r ather than
r e vo l u t i o n a ry rate and that the magnitude of some
of its components (such as legal temporary
wo r k e rs) has in fact decreased over the last decade
or so.W h at has increased (way out of proport i o n
with the evidence) is the popular impression that
the North is in a state of siege by the citizens of
the South.
About three out of five intern ational immigr a n t s
are found in the Nort h .The overwhelming majori t y

of them have gotten there through legal channels or
otherwise hold legal stat u s e s. M a ny of the rest are in
the North at the implicit “ i nv i t at i o n ” of some of
the receiving societies’ most powerful sectors (such
as employers) and with at least some forbearance
from the authori t i e s. And even those in irr e g u l a r
s i t u ations tend to be among the most energetic and
motivated young persons the South has available,
that is, persons who are least likely to be a burden
to the receiving society.
All world regions now have significant numbers
of foreign-born persons in their midst, but ori gi n s
and density va ry widely both within and across
r e gi o n s. Oceania is the most “ i m m i gr a n t - d e n s e ”
r e gi o n , with about five million foreign-born pers o n s
(about one in five pers o n s.) Next in immigr a n t
density is the area in the A m e ricas occupied by
Canada and the United Stat e s , with about one
i m m i grant in nine or ten persons (including
i rr e g u l a rs ) .
Perhaps surprisingly for many Europeans, the
European Union (EU)-c u m-Switzerland now have
a foreign-born population whose size is comparable
to that of US/Canada, although the larger
population of those 16 countries makes them less
immigrant-dense as a whole—about one in eleven
or twelve persons (including irregulars,again).
Inconvenient
truths
I m m i gr ation to the remaining two world regi o n s
is overwhelmingly i n t ra- r e gi o n a l . Asia has about
one third or more of all intern ational migr a n t s.
While the most immigrant-dense part of Asia by
far is the Middle East, we s t e rn and parts of
s o u t h e rn Asia are teeming with refugees while south
and southeast Asia are heavily engaged in most
forms of international migration.
F i n a l l y, A f ri c a , with about 10 per cent of all
international migrants,may be the region with the
greatest fluctuations in the size of that population.

This is partly because it is in A f rica that most

large-scale repatriations have taken place.Equally

Filling
thankless jobs
F u rt h e rm o r e , the Nort h ’s march toward a high
technology future will not eliminate the large
complement of low - wa g e , d i f f i c u l t , s e a s o n a l , a n d
socially undesirable jobs. Nor is the North likely to
find the political courage either to compel its un-
and under-employed to take these jobs or simply to
s u rrender these jobs to the South. As a result, i t
might be better for the North to acknowledge that
i m m i gr ation provides its societies with prospective
members who are eager to use such jobs as entry
points to the Nort h ’s economies and as access
routes to the full rewards of its social and political
systems.
