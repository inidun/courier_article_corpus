For outsiders , they are the “sea nomads”.
Admittedly peaceful, simple folks, they are
h owe ver mistrusted as fugi t i ve pagan sava g e s.
Their houseboats look dirty, crowded with chil-
d r e n , women cooking and a tangled mess of hou-
sehold belongings likely to include a cackling
rooster among the Bajau and a dog among the
M o k e n . Moored along beaches, l a g o o n s ,e s t u a ri e s
and even the backwat e rs of beach-front hotels,
their floating communities are scattered throu-
ghout Southeast Asia.
They form three distinct cultural gr o u p s
stemming from archipelagic env i r o n m e n t s : t h e
Orang Laut from estuaries of the Lingga-Riau-
Straits of Malacca mudflat s , the Moken from
the Mergui Archipelago and the Bajau from the
Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines, in the adjoi-
ning islands of East Born e o, and those of eastern
I n d o n e s i a , in particular the coasts of Celebes
and Flores.
Their numbers remain somewhat of a my s t e-
ry, p a rtly due to imprecise census-taking.W h i l e
they are counted as citizens in the countri e s
where they are found, they are considered as
ethnic minorities subject to discri m i n ation reser-
ved for “ o u t s i d e rs ” .
A n t h r o p o l o gists put their total population at
about 35,000. Yet they estimate that probably
not even one third of this number still live by tra-
dition—meaning with the sea, not simply on the
s e a , nor by it—because of sedentari z at i o n .T h i s
distinction is important but often ignored as
m a ny anthropologists and others continue to
oppose land and sea people, as if the two ways of
life contradicted one another.The boat dwe l l e rs ,
in fa c t , o s c i l l ate between sea and land.
The Moken compare themselves to their
“ mythical sister” the turt l e . They live betwe e n
t wo elements, water and land. Moored in a
lagoon or the leeward edges of an island, t h e i r
h o u s e b o ats are removed from the threats of
coastal predat o rs but not far enough to be swe p t
away by ebbing curr e n t s.

With va ri at i o n s , their houseboats are the
o u t ri g g e rs with mounted roofs common to
Southeast Asia and the Pa c i fic. The Moken
k a b a n g, for example, “are a marvel of ingenuity,”
according to anthropologist Pierre Ivanoff who
studied them in the 1950s and 1960s. “ S t a b l e ,
l i g h t , able to carry five to eight people, they are
capable of withstanding the wo rst storms of the
Indian Ocean. They are seven to ten metres
l o n g, and one and a half metres wide. . . . Not a
single nail is used in constru c t i o n : the va ri o u s
sections are secured with wood and bamboo
p e g s , strands of rattan or va rious creepers ,” w i t h
palm leaves used for roofs and sails.
Again to outsiders, the boats look crowded.
There is barely enough room to stand, let alone
walk. Older men find their legs gnarled from
the lack of movement.Yet here we fall into the
trap of comparing our perception of space on
land and at sea with theirs. With endless hori-
zons as a backdrop for the constant interplay
between water, air and light, these people live
open and free.
The monsoons shape and regulate their live s.
As the waves rise dangerously high with the
r a i ny season, they seek the protection of the
s h o r e . The Orang Laut are settled on fixed sites
in estuari e s , while the Moken and Bajau move
from one temporary mooring to another in
lagoons or along beaches and the leeward edges
of islands.This time is largely spent constru c t i n g
For centuries the waves have shaped the lives of
the Orang Laut, Moken and Bajau. How much longer
can the traditions of these small Southeast Asian
communities withstand the pressures of ‘modern’
development?

b o ats or repairing them, while food is found
hunting wild pigs, g at h e ring fruits and ve g e-
tables and digging up tubers like ya m . Once the
d ry season sets in, they ship off again.
The Moken also move from island to
island, hunting sea turtles and collecting sand
worms, shellfish, and clams for food. But para-
dox of paradoxes, they avoid the main fruit of
the sea—fish! Sea-slugs are the closest they
come and even these creatures are collected
only to be sold to the Chinese,
who love them. In contrast, the
Orang Laut and the Bajau run
after the fish, with the first group
scouring estuary habitats and the
second sifting through coral reefs
and mangroves.
C l e a r l y, the sea represents
life. Children are always born on the house-
boats, never on land. They play either on the
strands or swimming around the boats.Women
would never think of cooking ashore, even
during the rainy season when their boats are
moored along beaches.
In contrast, death and illness are bound to
land. All of the sea people go ashore to heal or
to bury their dead. Older people who feel that
they have outlived their usefulness to the com-
munity often discreetly ask to be left on a
deserted isle to die.
While spirits (h a n t u) roam eve ry w h e r e — o n
t r e e s , under water and rocks, in caves and eve n
the air, their sole requirement of the sea-people
is respect. The sea people believe that failure to
respect the environment—the abode of the spi-
rits—results in illness, c o n flict and deat h . A
fis h e rman who dares to cast a net during the
r a i ny season without performing the prescri b e d
ritual inevitably suffers. The only cure lies in
exorcism and appeasement. B a s i c a l l y, a shaman
e n t e rs into a trance to invite the spirit to inhabit
a wooden human image which is then brought
to an island designated for the spiri t s. The dead
are bu ried in common island cemeteri e s.
These associations of illness and death do
not mean that land is the domain of evil or suf-
f e ring for the boat - d we l l e rs. It simply signifie s
t h at there are things which belong to the land
and activities which are better done ashore than
on wat e r.T h u s , girls are named after tender flo-
we rs while boy s ’ names often reflect the strong
qualities of trees or animals.
H owe ve r , through their contacts with coastal
and plain dwe l l e rs , land has historically been a
source of misfortune for sea people. T h e y
recount this in their songs, l e g e n d s , and epics
which are sad. They recollect how the Orang
L a u t , aside from taking care of the ru l e rs ’ h u n-
ting dogs and other menial duties, were practi-
cally the indentured defenders of mari t i m e
routes for the gr e at Kingdoms of the Straits of
M a l a c c a ; h ow the Moken became pearl-dive rs
for the Chinese, and the Bajau trepang (sea
cucumber) collectors for the Tausug sultans.
These tasks were considered to be low l y, wo rt hy
only of sava g e s. And ye t , had it not been for
these specialized roles, the sea people wo u l d
h ave lost their cultural identity long ago.
I n d e e d , it looks as if fear of conve rsion to
I s l a m , which swept the region from the four-
teenth century on, gr e atly motivated the sea
people to stay offshore. It is their best way of sur-
viving and conserving their beliefs. All three
groups are bound by a common thread: t h e
opposition between us and them; O rang sama
and O rang baga i, i n s i d e rs and outsiders.
Whereas their communities are structured on
fleets organized around kinship pri n c i p l e s ,
human relations are gove rned by the more flu i d
distinction between us and them. H i s t o ry has
instilled in them a fear of those who do not
belong to them. And their instinct is to fle e —
inevitably to the sea.
To d ay, it is increasingly rare to find the
Orang Laut, M o k e n , and Bajau at their habitual
m o o ri n g s. Once again, they are fle e i n g . F r o m
w h at? From the onslaughts of blast-fis h i n g, f r o m
the conve rsion of traditional fishing and collec-
ting grounds into industrial production plants.
Will they surv i ve this time? ■
