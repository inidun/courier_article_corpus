Economism,
the ally of
obscurantism
by Régis Debray
Our own Utopian and mil¬
lenarian thinking has failed, and
we are seeing an official return to vintage
brands that are firmer and less falsifi-
able. The retreat from politics by disil¬
lusioned people is today opening the
door to its take-over by the revealed
religions. The pendulum has swung. The
laissez-faire, mercantilist and minimal
state is playing into the hands of clerics
and mafias who will stop at nothing
until it unconditionally surrenders. "You
do not destroy what you replace," said
Auguste Comte (the most clear-sighted
sociologist of his day) prophetically.
Religion is not the opium of the people
but the vitamin of the weak. How is it
possible to keep the neediest people
from turning to it if democratic states
have nothing more attractive to offer
than material prosperity? Clerical fanati¬
cism prospers anew because there is no
freely accepted civic religion, no secular
and agnostic spirituality. Today the
greatest ally of obscurantism is
economism. If our cynics in high places
were less interested in the Dow Jones
index, perhaps there would be fewer
dévots in the mosques and basilicas.
