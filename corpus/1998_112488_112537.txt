THE UNESCO COURIER 69
The situation started to change shortly
before the break-up of the Sov i e t
U n i o n .The key event was the aboli-
tion of censorship in 1989 which sparked
off a publishing boom. New co-operatives
joined the 300 stat e - owned publishing com-
p a n i e s , p rinting massive editions (from
50,000 to 100,000 copies) of works by pre-
viously banned authors including Akhma-
t ova ,T s ve t aye va , M a n d e l s t a m , B e r d yaye v
and Solov ye v. Foreign literature publishing
also took off, as large numbers of pirate edi-
tions were published, often of poor quality.
The number of publishing companies rose
to almost 6,000 in 1993, but so many of
them were putting out the same works that
the market was soon flooded.
The first ye a rs of the decade provided a
foretaste of things to come. But perestroika
did not really get into full swing until 1992,
when the first publishing companies we r e
p ri vat i z e d . The state did not relinquish
control over the industry, but set up a kind
of share-holding system in which it could
pull strings while offloading some of its fin a n-
cial bu r d e n .When this happened, the my t h
of the flo u rishing Soviet publishing industry
c o l l a p s e d . Under the old regi m e ,p rint ru n s
of some titles were enormous and tiny for
the rest; e d i t o rial decisions were made arbi-
t r a rily and party literature was gi ven pride of
p l a c e ,a u t o m atically bought by the unions,
sent free of charge to municipal and ru r a l
l i b r a ries and shipped to the people’s republics
of eastern Europe.Those days were ove r.
This first stage showed that publishing
was in a shaky condition. It is true that lack
of market experience and the new economic
s i t u ation were obstacles to profit a b i l i t y.T h e
sudden cuts in state subsidies, the break-
up of the centralized distri bution system,
s o a ring costs of paper,production and ship-
ping dealt a deat h - b l ow to the one-time
giants of Soviet publishing such as Sove t s k y
P i s at e l , M o l o d aya Gva r d ya , P r o gress and
D e t s k aya Literat u r a , which specialized in
books for young people. B e t ween 1990 and
1993 the number of published titles plum-
meted from 41,000 to 29,000 and the num-
ber of copies printed fell from 1.5 billion to
950 million.
The new Russia tried to gi ve publishing
a second chance. A bill relating to publi-
s h e rs ’ and authors ’ rights was passed in
1993, and a federal law concerning aid to
publishing and the media,which provided
for pri vat i z at i o n , tax breaks and other fin a n-
cial incentive s , came into force on 1 Ja n u a ry
1 9 9 6 . This legi s l ation spurred on the pri-
vate sector, which today produces nearly
two-thirds of the books published in Rus-
sia—a total of 420 million copies and more
than 36,000 titles.
An uphill job
But these figures are just one side of the
c o i n . The Russian publishing industry is
still beleaguered by a host of problems, o f t e n
r e l ated to the drop in purchasing powe r.
Russian citizens cannot afford to buy books,
e ven school textbooks.W h at is more, m a ny
local publishers are not in a position to sup-
ply the fragmented market,so that there is
a fla grant imbalance between the country ’s
central regions and the outlying areas, e s p e-
cially Siberia and the Far East.In the cen-
tral areas, the number of books ava i l a b l e
per inhabitant is in the hundreds. On the
p e ri p h e ry, it is less than twe n t y.W h at ’s more,
the January 1996 law is arbitrarily applied
and publishers rarely benefit from the adva n-
tages it offers. E ven public sector publishing
companies are feeling the pinch. In 1996-97,
only twe n t y - five books were published with
state participation.And most of them were
printed to commemorate Moscow’s 850th
anniversary.
For the most part , these aberr at i o n s
penalize small- and medium-sized compa-
n i e s.Large firms are doing quite we l l ,e s p e-
cially if they reach a wide public. S c i e n c e
fic t i o n ,t h ri l l e rs and love stori e s , once almost
impossible to fin d , are best-sellers today.
Demand is rising, especially because these
books cost between 12 and 15 roubles (from
$2 to $2.50, as of 15 June)—the ave r a g e
s a l a ry in Moscow is 1,000 roubles a month
($164) and from 300 to 500 roubles ($49 to
$82) a month elsewhere in Russia.
There is also a flo u rishing market for
c o o k b o o k s , d o - i t - yo u rself books, h e a l t h
Russian publishing is
moving along the bumpy
road to the free market.

companies Eskimo, O l m a - P r e s s ,AST press,

best-selling unive rsity textbooks,which cost
an average of 20 roubles,are on law, busi-
ness, finance and information technology.
The main publishing companies in this area,
which include Infra-M, S p a r k , F i n a n cy i
Statisika and Prior, are also in the private
s e c t o r. These new leaders in mass publi-
shing have also solved distri bution problems.
Most of them have their own warehouses,
t r a n s p o rt ation and computerized sales
management systems.
With print runs of 15,000 to 20,000
copies,Vagrius and Terra,the main literary
p u b l i s h e rs , are able to sell their books at
c o m p e t i t i ve prices ranging from 20 to 30
r o u b l e s. They also work with wholesalers
and have an extensive point of sale netwo r k
in Moscow and the regions.
The situation is quite different for publi-
s h e rs such as Sabascnikov, whose print ru n s
are 5,000 copies or less. It is hard for them
to make a profit , especially since their books
are produced in Italy and sold in Russia.A t
50 roubles each, these publishers are hav i n g
a hard time winning market share. S i n c e
their books sell poorly, they cannot start
m a ny new projects and have to make do
with publishing three or four titles a year.
Rethinking 
the book industry
In addition to shipping costs and commis-
sions skimmed off by wholesalers , s m a l l
companies have to cope with the prohibitive
b o rr owing terms laid down by Russian
b a n k s , which charge from 40 to 60 per cent
interest a ye a r.The 17 per cent interest rat e s
of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development are attractive, but those
loans are hard to come by.
A u t h o rs are also going through hard
t i m e s.There are no literary agencies in Rus-
s i a , and wri t e rs have as much trouble fin d i n g
a publisher as defending their ri g h t s.This is
t rue even for successful authors like A l e x a n-
der Marinina,who has been dubbed “king
of the thri l l e r ” . B e gi n n e rs are even wo rs e
o f f.L i t e r a ry awards such as the Bouker and
Antibouker prizes usually go to established
authors and publishers.
Where translation is concerned there is
also a lot of catching up to do. Money is the
decisive factor,and publishers favour clas-
sics because they cannot afford to pay copy-
right and promotional costs. Grants from
the Soros Fo u n d ation and France’s Pushkin
p r o gramme have funded new translations of
