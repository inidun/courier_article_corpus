                                 95% of children aged 4 and 5 and 60% of 3-year-olds in Jamaica 
participate in early Childhood Care and education. The roving Caregivers Programme 
                      is concentrating on reaching kids who are under three 
                                         and from the most disadvantaged and rural areas.

like “thank you” and “sorry”. The 
children’s laughter and cheers ring 
through the air. 
“For now, the ring game is a way to 
use up the children’s energy. When 
they are older they will be able to 
participate even more” Melonie ex-
plains to the parents. “Playing is the 
foundation of learning,” she adds.

Giving back  
to the community
Early Childhood Care and Educa-
tion has a long-standing tradition 
in Jamaica, with 95% participation 
rates for four- and five-year-olds and 
around 60% for three-year-olds.
Rovers like Melonie, are caregiv-
ers who come from the poor, rural 
communities that they serve. The 
name “Rover” stems from the fact 
that they travel from home to home. 
Each Rover is responsible for ap-
proximately thirty families, who are 
visited for 30 to 45 minutes several 
times per week.

National efforts are now focusing 
on better access for children under 
three and those from the poorest 
families and most disadvantaged 
and rural areas. 
RCP fits within Jamaica’s priori-
ties. It focuses on improving the de-
velopment, health and nutrition of 
children aged 0-3, promoting their 
parents’ self-esteem and child-rear-
ing knowledge, and assisting with 
income-generating activities for the 
community. All told, 14,255 parents 
and 22,335 children in three rural 
parishes have been served since 
the programme began in 1992. 
Melonie has been working in this 
particular community for a few 
months now and says that the 
growth that she has noticed in 
both parents and children is worth 
the over 50 miles she travels daily 
for her sessions. “The parents and 
children are so good, energetic and 
enthused,” she says. “I love being 
around the children, doing this kind 
of work is my passion.” 
The lessons the parents learn are 
far-reaching. “Rovers go into the 
homes to work with infants and par-
ents, but there is a ripple effect to 
other children,” says Utealia Burrell, 
Director of the programme.
It’s worth 
the challenges
It is not only the children and fami-
lies who benefit, but the Rovers as 
well. While Rovers are all secondary 
school graduates, many were previ-
ously unemployed. To prepare for 
their role, they receive regular train-
ing and are periodically supervised 
in the field by project officers. They 
are not only paid for their work, but 
it also often leads to further educa-
tion and even professional certifica-
tion. Melonie is currently training 
in Early Childhood Education at 
HEART NTA, a national vocational 
institution. “We even have some 
parents who—once they success-
fully complete the programme—go 
on to become Rovers themselves,” 
says Burrell. “Having been in the 
programme, they understand the 
experiences of parents in the com-
munity.” 
Evaluations carried out by UNI-
CEF and the Bernard van Leer 
Foundation demonstrate that RCP 
is a good investment. The pro-
gram has now been successfully 
replicated in four other Caribbean 
countries: Dominica, Grenada, 
St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines. Burrell has recently 
presented the programme in Africa 
and hopes that it can be replicated 
there too. 
The Jamaica Roving Caregivers 
Programme is not without its share 
of challenges. “Some parents were 
sceptical at first, saying that the 
child is too young to learn,” explains 
Melonie. “However, after about 
three months with the programme 
these parents said their child was 
responding to their voices, and 
some could identify shapes.” 
Jasanth Bell, 41, a new mother in 
the programme, echoes Melonie’s 
enthusiasm. “I enjoy being with pro-
gramme. You learn to treat the chil-
dren with respect and lots of love…
how to tell the children mommy 
loves you,” she smiles. She contin-
ues, “The baby is 5 months now, so 
I have a long way to go.” 
“Seeing the positive impact you 
have on a child’s life makes the dis-
tance I travel shorter,” Melonie says. 
“I look forward to coming to work, 
I don’t mind the sun…just their 
smiles make it worthwhile.”»
