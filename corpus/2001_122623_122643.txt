Out of b u t t e r and w a t e r: t h e
Hindu creation
In the classic myths of Hinduism, there is no primeval emptiness:
just different stages of gods and the universe, recycling themselves
like crops
2 . C O S M O S, GOD AND US
T
here is no single Hindu myth of origin.Th e r e
are as many myths as there are texts;
s o m e t i m e s, the same text has more than one.
The earliest myths date back to the Rig Ve d a ,
the first of the four Ve d a s, composed over a
period of time, though certainly before 1000 BC, a n d
eventually committed to writing many centuries later.
Contrary to what some believe, the bulk of Rig
Vedic hymns—all told, there are 1028 of them, s p r e a d
over ten books—are not spiritual or metaphysical at all,
consisting mostly of tributes to an entire pantheon of
anthropomorphic gods. But books one and ten, w h i c h
coincide with the emergence of varna, the four-fold
hierarchical division of society,which rapidly led to the
proliferation of hundreds of castes, also contain the
origin hymns.
The most celebrated of these is the hymn that
contains the earliest known reference to v a r n a.
Creation is the result of the sacrifice of Purusha (Man),
the primeval being, who is all that exists, i n c l u d i n g
“whatever has been and whatever is to be.” Wh e n
P u r u s h a , who had “a thousand heads, a thousand eyes,
a thousand feet” was sacrific e d , the clarified butter
that resulted was made into the beasts which inhabit

the earth.This same sacrifice produced the gods, I n d r a
(the menacing king of gods),Agni (Fi r e ) ,Vayu (Wi n d ) ,
as well as the Sun and the Moon. From Purusha’s
navel the atmosphere was born; his head produced
the heaven; his feet produced the earth;his ear the sky.
The four v a r n a s were born too: the mouth was the
b r a h m a n ( p r i e s t ) ; the arms the k s h a t r i y a ( w a r r i o r ) ;
the thigh the vaishya (general populace);the feet the
shudra (servant).
Primeval incest is the other method by which
creation takes place in the Rig Ve d a , and this idea
recurs throughout Hinduism. Later mythology claims
M a n u , the first man, gave birth to the human race
through the act of incest;Manu himself is also born of
incest that the creator indulges in. By the time we
come to the texts known as the Puranas (dates between
300 and 1500 A D ) , the story of creation becomes more
c o m p l e x : the creator of the universe was the god
B r a h m a , who came from the primeval waters,and was
sw ay a m b h u ( s e l f - e x i s t e n t ) . Brahma transformed
himself into a giant boar (varaha) to bring forth the
earth from the depths of these waters. The first man,
M a n u , was born directly of Brahma. Manu was a
h e r m a p h r o d i t e, and created two sons and three
daughters from his female half.
What is striking in all this, of course, is that none of
these stories actually say how the universe began.
There is no sense of things being created out of nothing,
the stuff of the universe only happening to be reused
and recycled periodically, like in a giant ecofriendly
e n t e r p r i s e. In a sense, of course, this is a natural
outcome of the Hindu view of the eternally recycling
u n i v e r s e, that goes through the four successive periods,
y u g a s, forever condemned to the cycle of regeneration
and destruction. The four y u g a s are said to be
respectively 4800, 3 6 0 0 ,2 4 0 0 , and 1200 god-years long.
A god-year, in turn, lasts 360 human years.The quality
of life,as well as of humans, progressively deteriorates
in each successive y u g a until we reach the present
dark (kali) yuga, which will end in the great universal
deluge, followed again by a new golden age and the
birth of man from Manu.
This great cosmic cycle, eternally chasing its own
t a i l , this depressingly monotonous ebb and flow in
which all illusion of forward movement is actually
r e t r o g r e s s i o n , fairly accurately sums up the Indian
p e a s a n t ’s life over centuries. The hard summer is
followed by the great deluge of the monsoon,which
rekindles the eternal hope that at last hunger, misery,
and want will come to an end.Thus every agricultural
cycle is actually the great cosmic cycle in microcosm.
Practically all festivals in various parts of India coincide
with the major punctuations in this agricultural cy c l e ;
for instance, even as I write these lines in late March,
the traditional Indian new year is being celebrated in
most regions, now that the crop is ready.
A visit to the barber
To the extent that India is still a predominantly
agricultural society, these festivals, and the various
rituals that go with them,are an organic part of people’s
lives, and not just corporate inducements to an urban
elite to consume more and more in the globalized
m a r k e t p l a c e.Ye t , since these festivals and rituals have
actually evolved over a very long period of time, they
are now most often taken for granted; like the self-
existent creator, they just exist,with neither beginning
nor end. For most practitioners of these rituals, much
of the original meaning is either unimportant,or simply
lost under centuries of cultural sedimentation.
Yet ideas persist over centuries and pop up at you
when you least expect them. Last week, I needed a
h a i r c u t , and so I went to the barber who has performed
this service since I was about ten. It is a veritable
r i t u a l , evolved over two decades or so. It begins with his
magnanimously offering me tea, and ends with his
never returning change.In between, he asks about my
family, I about his;he checks if I am still off smoking,
I if he is off drink.Through all this,of course, we discuss
p o l i t i c s, s p o r t s,and anything else of topical interest.Th i s
time, I asked him how he was told the universe came
into being.He laughed,snipped off a tuft of hair on my
f o r e h e a d , and said: “ Who knows how all this was
created? Who was around to see? Even the gods were
born after something existed, so who can tell what
happened when nothing existed?”
My barber has not read the Rig Veda. But if he
were to, some day, he will be struck by the following
hymn:
Then even nothingness was not,nor existence.
There was no air then,nor the heavens beyond it.
Who covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?
Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?
But,after all,who knows, and who can say,
Whence it all came, and how creation happened?
The gods themselves are later than creation,
So who knows truly whence it has arisen?
