Barbara is nursing her new-born baby, Max. “My
husband and I chose him from the embryos we made,”
she tells a friend. “We also made sure that Max
wouldn’t turn out to be fat like my brother Tom or
addicted to alcohol like my husband’s sister.”

Melissa is in the early stages of labour in a maternity
ward.To take her mind off the contractions, she looks
at computer-generated pictures of a five-year-old gir l
with blond hair and green eyes and others of the same
girl as a teenager. This is Melissa’s yet-to-be-born
child.What cannot be seen is that she has a package
of genes to provide her with lifelong resistance to HIV
infection.

The country is divided into two classes:the GenRich,wh o s e
families invested heavily in the genetic design of their off-
s p ri n g,and the Nat u ra l s,whose families couldn’t afford to
do so.The GenRich make up 10 per cent of the populat i o n ,
and dominate the upper echelons of society,while the Nat u-
rals wo rk as low-paid service prov i d e rs.GenRich parents
pressure their children not to dilute their expensive ge n e t i c
e n d owment by marrying Nat u ra l s.
This is not an exercise in Hollywood screen-
writing.These scenarios emerge from our current
base of scientific and technological knowledge.
Since the 1980s, genetic engi n e e ring has been suc-
cessfully practised with mice, c ow s , sheep and pigs. I t
h a s n ’t yet been applied to human beings simply because

New technology making it possible to produce children immune to chronic genetic disease 
also paves the way for ‘designer babies’ for parents who can afford them.
This prospect is opening a Pa n d o ra ’s box of ethical, social and legal dilemmas—nowhere more
than in the United States.

the most basic technique for adding genes to embryo s
has a success rate of only 50 per cent at best.And for
the even more complicated task of altering genes to
cure dis e a s e , the odds are about a million to one.
But with cloning, the entire equation changes.
You can now take a cell from a fertilized egg of just a
few days and then clone it to make millions of copies
which could then be engineered by, for example,
injecting foreign DNA through a microscopic
n e e d l e .Thanks to the “Wilmut technique” (see page
2 1 ) , the scientist can then take a properly engi n e e-
red cell’s nucleus and insert it into a fresh egg which
is placed in the mother’s wo m b.
This is just one of many approaches now being
d e veloped in laborat o ri e s. By using one or a combi-
n ation of them,genetic engi n e e ring of human embryo s
will be safe and efficient by the middle of the 21st cen-
t u ry.We will face the ultimate frontier in medicine and
p h i l o s o p hy—the power to change the nature of the
human species.
Genetic engi n e e ring will begin in a thoroughly
acceptable manner, by treating severe childhood
diseases like cystic fib r o s i s. S e rvices will then steadily
expand in two distinct phases. In the firs t , parents will
gi ve their children genes that others naturally have . Fo r
e x a m p l e , they will incorp o r ate within their embryos the
genes which make some people naturally resistant to
c e rtain forms of cancer or HIV infection (about one
per cent of the A m e rican male population has a gene
making them immune to HIV infection).At the same
t i m e , they may reve rse predisposition to conditions like
obesity or alcoholism and diseases like diabetes.
Geneticists will then focus on the mind and senses.
To begin with,d o c t o rs will replace or alter genes linked
to mental diseases and antisocial behaviour like
extreme aggr e s s i o n . As technology improves and
s p r e a d s , parents will have the choice of enhancing
a rtistic potential, for example, by heightening visual
or auditory acuity.With better understanding of the
human brain, we will enhance cognitive abilities by,
for example, strengthening the gene responsible for
c o nve rting short term memory into long term
m e m o ry.This is now being done in mice.
All of these services invo l ve altering or adding genes
which already exist in the human genome.H owe ve r ,
in the second phase of genetic engi n e e ri n g, we will
actually introduce new genes into the genome.
Humans might develop night vision by gene-transfers
from bats or entirely new traits like the ability to deci-
pher radio wave s.O b v i o u s l y, this kind of engi n e e ri n g
will take a gr e at deal of time to develop because of the
complexity and risks invo l ve d .We cannot introduce a
gene into the human genome without being cert a i n
t h at it wo n ’t cause any harm .
One way or another,we will see an exponential ri s e
in the number and va riety of possible genetic exten-
sions—like the additions to computer operating sys-
tems that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s.
Extensions that were once unimaginable will become
indispensable . . . to those parents who can afford
them. n
