ASTRONAUTICS : THE NEW SCIENCE
OF SPACE TRAVEL
A STROXAUTICS is a new science.It is the science of space
travel, of flight beyond the
earth's atmosphere and of voyages
to other worlds. Its rapid develop-
ment during these past few decades
is bringing a note of hard reality
into the world of mythology and
fantasy that for centuries has been
fed by the writing of men who
dreamed of exploring the realms
of space.
It was Galileo who-as in so
many other cases-laid a foundation
for this reality. Through his teles-
cope he saw 400 years ago what
no other man had ever seen before.
"It is a most beautiful and delight-
ful sight to behold the body of
the moon, which is distant from
us nearly sixty semi-diameters of
the earth, as near as if it was at a
distance of only two of the same
measures,"he wrote."And conse-
quently any one may know with
the certainty that is due to the
use of our senses, that the moon
certainly does not possess a smooth
and polished surface, but one rough
and uneven, and just like the face
of the earth itself, is everywhere
full of vast protuberances, deep
chasms, and sinuosities."
Galileo's telescope bore out the
theory of Copernicus that the sun,
and not the earth, was the centre of
our planetary system ; and that
the earth was only one of many
planets of its kind. Indeed, Galileo
was able to discover"four planets
neither known nor observed by any
one of the astronomers before my
time."
Arthur C. Clarke, chairman of
the British Interplanetary Society,
points out in his new book The
Exploration oaf Space, that only one
writer of ancient times wrote a
story about travelling to the moon.
He was Lucien of Samos, who, in
about the second century A. D.,
told how a man was taken to the
moon in a waterspout which seized
his ship when he was sailing beyond
the Pillars of Hercules ! Another
more recent story of a journey to
the moon was written just over
400 years ago, following Galileo's
by Maurice Goldsmith, Unesco Science Editor
discoveries, by another great astro-
nomer, Johannes Kepler. The hero
of his storv arrived on the moon by
supernatural means, but his des-
cription of what he found there was
based upon the latest scientific
knowledge of that time.
Since that day, travel in space
has provided the theme for innumer-
able stories. Now however, the
moon is actually coming within our
reach. In two or three generations
the first man may land there, and
long before then-perhaps with-
in a few vears-an unmanned
rocket mav have reached the moon.
We have already contacted that
planet by radar. A signal has been
sent across 240, 000 miles of space
and it has brought back an"echo"
from the moon. The naked eve
and the revealing telescope will
no longer be our main means of
"exploring"the heavens. woe shall
be able to travel through inter-
planetary space and see the realities
for ourselves.The instrument which will make
this possible is the rocket. (It is
interesting that this seemingly most
modern of inventions originated
about 700 years ago in China).
To leave the earth and to travel
in space we require to do two basic
things : first, to devise a means of
overcoming the earth's gravita-
tional pull so that we can get into
space ; and secondly, once there,
to find a means of travelling around
in an airless vacuum, which is
basically what outer space is.
We are all familiar with the force
of gravity. If it did not exist,
neither would we. It is gravity
which makes life possible for us
by keeping a thin blanket of air
tightly round the earth. With in-
creasing height, however, the force
of gravity slowly diminishes. At
250 miles up-the greatest height
yet reached by a rocket-it loses
only 10 per cent of its value at sea
level. But at 12, 000 miles up, a
one-pound weight would weigh only
one ounce."It follows, therefore",
says Clarke,"that the further away
one goes from the earth, the easier it
is to go onwards. In terms of
gravity, leaving the earth is rather
like climbing a hill which at first
is very steep but later becomes
more and more gentle until finally
it is almost perfectly flat."
It was Sir Isaac Newton, the
English scientist, who first formu-
lated the laws of gravity. It was
also he who gave us the clue that
has enabled us to understand the
mechanics of travel in space, when
he said :"For every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction."
To understand what this means,
take an ordinary sausage-shaped
rubber balloon and blow it up.
Then let go of the balloon, and it
will dart rapidly around until the
air has gone out of it. What has
happened is that molecules of
compressed air in the balloon are
bombarding the closed front end
of the balloon-and it is this which
is pushing the balloon forward.
That is, the action of the molecules
in bombarding the front end of the
balloon is producing the reaction
of balloon movement.
This is basically what causes a
rocket to move. It is essentiallv
a cylinder with the back end open.
It carries along its own oxygen,
and the chemical reaction causes
the molecules to move about swiftlv
and to bombard the confined space
in the cvlinder. The molecules
fly out of the open end. In this
way, the action of the molecules
bombarding the closed front end
produces the reaction that pushes,
or thrusts, the rocket forward.
The great virtue of this is that the
rocket would actually move faster
if there were no air at all, because
the air in front tends to slow it
down.
The rocket is, therefore, the ideal
form of space-ship because it can
generate enormous power for little
weight or size of engine (for example,
the V2 was four times as powerful
as the Queen Elizabeth), and this
will enable it to overcome the
earth's gravitational pull. It will
also work most efficiently in the
vacuum of outer space and at high
flight speeds.
To escape from the earth a rocket
needs a velocity of 25, 000 m. p. h.
This may seem utterly fantastic,
but we should remember that while
in 1940 the top flight for a rocket
was under 1, 000 m. p. h., in 1950 it
was nearer 5, 000 m. p. h. It is
certain that there will be great
developments in the immediate
years ahead.
Rocket research is proceeding in
all advanced industrialized coun-
tries, for a variety of purposes :
to assist the take-off of aircraft ;
to propel aircraft at extreme speeds
and heights (for example, the Ame-
rican Bell rocket plane was the first
to fly faster than sound) ; for high-
altitude research by instrument-
carrying projectiles, and for guided
missiles. So far as fuel is concern-
ed, it is probable that future rocket
spaceships will ultimately make use
of atomic power.
On the basis of all this work,
experts declare that within the next
few decades there will be set up
in space an"earth-sateIIite-vehicle,"
a man-made"planet"in a close orbit
around the earth. This would circle
the earth without remaining at a
constant distance, and would stay
there indefinitely without using any
power.
It could be used, for example, as
a research observatory beyond the
atmosphere, for physicists and astro-
nomers ; as an observatory for
meteorologists who would be able
to"see"the earth's weather system
developing ; as a radio relay station,
which would allow, for instance, of
world-wide reception of television ;
and, unfortunately, as a military
base for reconnaissance.
Since early pioneers began some
40 years ago to study the theory
of space flight (Goddard in the
U. S. A., Oberth in Germany, Esnault-
Pelterie in France, and Tsiolkovsky
in Russia), we have made tremendous
advances. So much so, that man
may soon be setting out on the
"roads"to the planets.
