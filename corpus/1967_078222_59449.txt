OVER A MILLION WATERLOGGED BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS
Hundreds of thousands of books old and new, irreplaceable historical
documents, unpublished manuscripts of literary and musical works were
submerged by floodwaters in the basements of Florence. At the National
Library alone, 300.000 volumes had to be rescued from scenes of indes¬
cribable chaos (photo left). Teams of helpers came spontaneously to
Florence. Among them were many young people, including Italian and foreign
students. Chains of volunteers worked day and night (above) to evacuate
the sodden, muddy volumes. These were washed and then stored in safety
(right) to await first-aid treatment. Below, volunteer helper puts blotting
paper between pages. This operation has to be repeated three times for
each page, for each volume, for hundreds of thousands of volumes.

Florence, city of the arts, is today a city of
volunteers engaged in saving its treasures.
Specialists and student volunteers work
side by side in improvised centres through¬
out the city, as well as in restoration studios
and monasteries elsewhere in Italy, giving
first-aid treatment to books. The volumes
are taken apart and washed page by page
in tanks of water (right) and then hung out
to dry. Above, innumerable pages dry out
slowly. Too rapid drying would make the
paper brittle. Enemy No. 1 of these books
s mould. To combat it a vast oper¬
ation has now begun to disinfect the
volumes by injection (left) or fumigation.
