Will the College crumble?
The debate is only beginning over how the U.S. elects the world’s most powerful leader
efore laying the U. S. presidential election
saga to rest, l e t ’s revisit a favourite
bedtime story: The Three Little Pigs,
featuring Ralph,Al and Dubya.
The scene opens in the Green
wilderness where Ralph puts up a tent
and lights a campfire as young friends
gather to revel in his stories of slain
corporate giants.To stoke the excitement,
Ralph suddenly cries “ Wo l f ! ” In the
c o n f u s i o n , he runs to a house nearby
where he finds a warm meal and bed.
Cunning as a fox,he continues his “ Wo l f ! ”
cry and crosses the country in style.
Enter A l : a serious piggy, who has
spent years laying the foundations of his
fine home.The problem is that Al invested
so much in the bricks and mortar that he
overlooked a few details, namely little
holes in the ballot-lined roof. So after a
few weeks of huffing and puffin g, the wolf
blows his house down to a pile of chads.
Fi n a l l y,Dubya (referring to the middle
initial of George W. Bush) and the clan
arrive to reclaim an old stomping ground,
the Electoral College, a fortress dating
back over 200 years, whose framers
examined every nook and cranny before
sealing it constitutionally (see box). Th e
wolf ferociously attacks, enlisting the
majority of voters who throw their weight
against the candidate, but the College
d o e s n ’t budge.
But here’s the twist: the wolf is still
scratching at the College—which looks
increasingly like a crumbling relic.And his
howls are bouncing around the halls of
Congress and state legislatures, sending
shivers up the spines of politicians now
faced with a flurry of petition drives and
Internet campaigns by interest groups
seeking reform.
In fact, there are now three
congressional bills to scrap the Electoral
College and have voters elect the
president and vice president directly1. If
a candidate failed to secure 40 percent of
the vote, a run-off election would ensue.
I r o n i c a l l y, the most consistent call for
reform has come from a Republican,
Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois.
“ I t ’s a slap in the face to have a select
group of elites elect a president a month
after the people have cast their votes,” h e
says.
Before turning to politics,LaHood was
a highschool teacher in a quandary: h e
had to instruct students about an electoral
system he considered archaic. “I always
knew it would take a crisis to provoke a
controversy and now we have it,”r e f e r r i n g
to the bitter disputes over the popular
vote for Al Gore.“My own party doesn’t
support this… But for me, i t ’s a matter of
p r i n c i p l e.” Lahood notes “a huge shift in
public support,”especially since high-fly i n g
D e m o c r a t s, like the newly-elected Senator
Hillary Rodham Clinton, began climbing
aboard the bandwagon.
A constitutional amendment would

G e o rge Washington oversaw the signing of the U. S. Constitution in 1787. Yet Americans are still scratching their heads over their electoral system.

require two-thirds approval in the House
of Representatives and the Senate,
followed by a majority vote by three-
quarters of state legislatures. Wh i l e
LaHood foresees hearings in the House
this year,he expects small (low-population)
states to quash debate in the Senate just as
they did to a similar bill in 1969 after
Richard Nixon almost lost the presidential
election because of the “ s p o i l e r ”G e o r g e
Wa l l a c e, an independent candidate from
Alabama with an anti-liberal platform.
Just as they did 30 years ago, most small
states continue to believe that they have a
decisive advantage in the Electoral College.
For example, the District of Columbia and
the five least populous states have a total of
2.6 million voting-age residents.To g e t h e r,
they had 18 electoral votes in the 2000
election—the same number as Michigan,
which has 7.2 million voting-age residents.
Direct elections:
a formula for civil war?
But let’s imagine—or predict,as many
pollsters are already doing—that another
r a z o r-thin election in 2004 results in a
minority-elected president.Public support
could reach fever pitch and America might
finally opt for direct elections. Or if the
constitutional amendment proves too
d i f fic u l t , the states could follow the path of
Maine and Nebraska, which allocate all
but two of their electoral votes
proportionally instead of a winner- t a k e s - a l l
f o r m u l a . The remaining two votes are
awarded to the statewide winner. H o w
would the “little piggies” then fare in the
future? 
“ They will go hunting where the ducks
a r e,” says Judith Best, a political science
professor at State University New York at
C o r t l a n d , who testified at congressional
hearings in 1997 about the Electoral
C o l l e g e. In direct elections, c a n d i d a t e s
would focus on winning votes in populous
areas—namely the east and west coasts—
and ignore the middle of the country.In the
race to run up a mathematical majority,
they would see no need to build a broad
cross-national coalition.“ This is a formula
for civil war,”she says.To govern such a vast
and diverse country, the president must
stitch together a campaign based on local
and national issues. “If you don’t have a
system which forces candidates to reach out
to the diverse interests of people, t h e y
w o n ’t . Black and Latino influ e n c e, f o r
e x a m p l e, would drop like a stone. B l a c k s
represent just 12 percent of the
p o p u l a t i o n ,” she says, but they currently
enjoy leverage “as swing voters in many
s t a t e s.”
Best may want to check her
a r i t h m e t i c.According to David Bositis, a
senior analyst at the nation’s most
respected black think-tank, the Jo i n t
Center for Political and Economic Studies,
“direct elections would not diminish the
minority vote but may enhance it. Th e
minority population does not live in the
small states, which have the biggest
favourable vote in terms of the Electoral
C o l l e g e. A lot of the black and Hispanic
populations live in states like Mississippi,
Te x a s,Alabama and the Carolinas where
they vote Democrat but the majority votes
R e p u b l i c a n . So their votes don’t count.”
“ The small states would get less
attention but at least we would have more
states getting some attention,” s a y s
Harold Gold, an associate professor of
government at Smith College in
M a s s a c h u s e t t s. “ This last election was
fought in 17 states.The others saw nothing
of the candidates.Under direct elections,
there are no safe states.Al Gore could go
to Texas [a Republican stronghold] and
try to pick up the liberal votes.”
But instead of actually visiting those
“enemy states” and shaking hands with
ordinary folks,candidates would rely upon
mass media campaigns, namely through
t e l e v i s i o n , according to Curtis Gans,
director of the Committee for the Study of
the American Electorate, a highly
respected non-partisan,n o n - p r o fit research
i n s t i t u t e.“A giant media campaign would
reduce any incentive for a grassroots
campaigning and activism,” he says.
There is one point of agreement:
direct elections would offer a “ m o r e ”
level playing field to third parties.“ M o r e ”
is key—for these new players would still
suffer from financial handicaps (parties

Protestors wave signs and hurl hollowed-out televisions into the Boston Harbor to

must receive five percent of the vote in
the previous election to qualify for federal
campaign financing). But they might
finally break free from the role of the
“ s p o i l e r,” a nightmare for Ralph Nader’s
campaign strategist,Steve Cobble. “Ten
days before the elections, the polls
predicted that Ralph would receive five to
six million votes,” says Cobble. In the
end, the vote was so close that he only
received about half that, largely because
a vote for Nader was seen as a vote for
Bush.“In this country, we firmly believe
in the benefits of competition,” a d d s
Cobble,“except in the field of politics. ”
Multiple-party systems are seen
internationally as a sign of a vibrant
d e m o c r a cy. But critics from both the
American left and right warn that
“healthy competition” could quickly
degenerate into hyper-factionalism and
the backroom dealing of the Israeli
K n e s s e t , which is considered an emblem
of instability.
“I think there is some middle
g r o u n d ,” says Rob Richie, of the non-
p r o fit Center for Voting and Democracy.
The solution lies in obliging the winning
candidate to gain 50 percent of the vote,
explains Richie, and installing an instant
runoff mechanism so that voters could
list their first and second choices on the
same ballot.“ With an instant runoff, t h e r e
w o u l d n ’t be that nasty edge of one
candidate trying to destroy another,w h i c h
turns off voters. [A candidate like] Nader
could implicitly endorse his opponent as
a second choice, which is one way of
building a more coherent system.”
How would third parties compete in
the new landscape of direct elections?
Would they dynamize the debates?
According to Democratic pollster Paul
M a s l i n ,“this past election was the supreme
example of how the Electoral College sets
up a huge fight for the middle.”
Demographer Joel Garreau goes a step
f u r t h e r. “Both candidates ran as Bill
C l i n t o n ,which is to say both were willing to
do whatever it took in terms of degrading
their ideological positions to achieve the
c e n t r e.”Al Gore, for example, ducked the
issue of gun-control to woo voters in the
pro-gun swing states of Michigan and
P e n n s y l v a n i a . George W. Bush raised the
ire of the Republican conservative wing
by downplaying his anti-abortion position.
Under direct elections, it would be more
e f ficient for major party candidates to run
up their votes by moving closer to their
respective ideological poles, which would
leave space in the middle for third parties.
Slipping past the radar 
of the pollsters
“ This is one reason,”says Gerry Moan,
chairman of the populist Reform party,
“why we focus on trade policy and
campaign fin a n c i n g.Social issues get you
caught in either the left or the right—but
the battle will be for the middle.”
So much for a new era of vibrant and
diverse policy debates that third parties
were supposed to introduce… Other than
“ s p o i l i n g ” an election, third parties can
have the most impact by pushing a main
party into a new position, according to
G a r r e a u . “If a third party starts to get
traction on an issue that the majors didn’t
e x p e c t , then suddenly those positions
become ‘safe’ for mainstream candidates.”
But given the sophistication of the
demographics industry, can third parties
get far with a hot issue before someone
like Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster,
appropriates it? “My radar system is
constantly looking at the issues and
agendas to incorporate changes as they
e m e r g e.” I n d e e d , Goeas expects the
current outrage over the Electoral College
to subside after a few Congressional
hearings which most Americans will never
know took place.
But they may be in for a shock in 2004
if another razor-thin election materializes
and Republicans face their own “ s p o i l i n g
N a d e r,” in the form of John McCain.
According to many pollsters, the senator
from Arizona (who lost the Republican
nomination this time round) could have
won 25 percent of the vote as an
independent candidate. In which case, it
may soon be in all parties’ interest to cast
their ballots for direct elections. ■
