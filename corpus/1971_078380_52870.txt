THE PUBLIC
AND
MODERN ART
Some unexpected findings
of a Unesco-backed inquiry
How does the general public judge modern art? To what
extent are the paintings of famous modern artists such as
Picasso, Klee, Miro, Mondrian and Pollock really [appreciated
by the average man or woman? This issue of the "Unesco
Courier " offers some tentative answers based on the findings
of a public opinion poll carried out in Toronto, Canada, by the
International Council of Museums with the aid of Unesco.
Readers who would like to compare their own reactions to
modern art with the results obtained in Toronto are invited to
turn at once to the section " Anyone Can Play " on page 18 and
to the centre colour pages.

P
1^^. USKIN once described a
new painting by Whistler as "a pot
of paint thrown in the face of the
public." By its response to an inquiry
carried out recently in Toronto,
Canada, the public might be said to
have picked up the pot of paint and
thrown it straight back into the face
of the modern artist.
The inquiry was carried out as a
public opinion poll in the city of
Toronto, by the International Council
of Museums with the aid of Unesco
and the Canadian National Commission
for Unesco.
This poll has revealed that when it
comes to tastes in modern art people
may not always know what they like
but they are extremely vehement In
proclaiming what they don't like. They
tend to like paintings of a type familiar
to them, but bridle at "jumbled up"
styles or innovations generally.
The results of the poll were
first published in Unesco's quarterly
magazine "Museum", destined for
museum specialists (1). The poll itself
consisted in showing a selection of
modern paintings, grouped according
to certain categories, to a repre¬
sentative sampling of the population of
Toronto over the age of 15. Persons
interviewed were given four sets of
10 paintings on colour postcards to
examine. The persons interviewed
were not given either the names of the
artists or the titles of the works.
Works of art in the inquiry were
nearly all by artists working between
1900 and 1960. In most sets there
was at least one "control" painting
from an earlier period. With few
exceptions the control painting proved
the most liked. Millet's "The Ángelus",
(1) 'Museum", Vol. XXII, No.
Price 90p, $3.00 or 10 F.
3/4, 1969.
painted in 1859 and now well known
(see photo page 7), was voted top
favourite among the 220 paintings
covered by the inquiry.
While the choice of favourites
varied, people were emphatically
agreed on what they did not like. The
most consistently unpopular paintings
were those of Dubuffet (represented
by "La Barbe des Incertains Retours",
see page 7, and "Landscape of the
Mental"). The first of these was voted
down by 78 per cent of the res¬
pondents.
Among the "champion hates" were
Léger, De Kooning, Miro and Pollock.
Certain paintings by other famous
modern artists such as Paul Klee and
Picasso came way down in the order
of preference and yet an equal number
of Picasso's paintings were highly
rated. (Eight were placed among the
four top choices in various sets and
eight among the four bottom choices.)

"In the arts," says William Withrow, Director of the Art Gallery of Ontario,
"we tend to love the things which are most familiar. Exposure means familiarity,
and familiarity, in this case, breeds the reverse of contempt. In all efforts to
educate we must move from the known to the unknown... This is particularly
essential in art education." Above, visitors to the Museum of Modern Art in
New York listen to the comments of an art expert on Picasso's Three
Musicians (in full colour on our cover).

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
'Unnatural colours'
make the public see red
One Picasso work, "The Old Guita¬
rist" painted in 1904 at the end of
his Blue Period rated top place in its
set (see page 16), and even his wilfully-
distorted still-life "La Casserole Email-
lée" (1944) gained second place in its
group perhaps because it has a very
juggy-looking jug (see colour reproduc¬
tion, No. 6, page 19).
Léger is another artist whose works
won high and low ratings. His "Mother
and Child", for example, was placed
next to the top in its group, perhaps
because the subject was easily re¬
cognizable. Mondrian's paintings,
however, were always and strongly
disliked.
From the survey a somewhat clearer
picture of public likes and dislikes in
modern art seems to have been brought
into focus one based on something
more than mere guesswork and in¬
tuition. However, the committee of
specialists which organized the poll has
hastened to point out that it would be
unwise to draw definitive conclusions
from its findings. It emphasizes that
the inquiry was primarily designed to
establish, test and prove a method of
research which now needs to be tried
out in other countries.
Yet even the preliminary results, as
yet uncomputerized, have been found
so revealing that it is difficult to ignore
them. They show, for instance, that
the public, as represented by the
Canadian sampling, is consistent in its
likes and dislikes and that age, sex,
occupation and education make little
difference in the results obtained.
T

HE inquiry reinforces an
assumption commonly made by mu¬
seum directors and art specialists that
the public's taste in art is strongly
conservative. Dr. Theodore Heinrich,
a member of the Toronto inquiry work¬
ing committee and a former director of
the Royal Ontario Museum, comments
on this point in his evaluation of the
preliminary findings published in "Mu¬
seum."
As he puts it: "Despite all the claims
within the professional communications
field . . . that the inventions of the
current generation have vastly in¬
creased the pace of assimilation of
information and dissemination of know¬
ledge, and of certain artists and critics
that ergo, any novelty in art will enjoy
equally rapid acceptance, we can now
confidently state the contrary.
"As far as art is concerned, the long
observed peculiarity that there exists
a generally stable gap of two genera¬
tions or a minimum of half a century
between important creative innovation
and its general acceptance by the
ordinary public remains true. For all
the technical innovations in commu¬
nications and the vast spread of edu¬
cation, we doubt that the acceptance
gap has been shortened by so much as
a week."
D
R. Heinrich finds it signif¬
icant that three of the most violently
rejected pictures in the Toronto poll
"Soldiers Playing Cards", by Léger,
"Brücke III" by Feininger and "Compo¬
sition in Blue" by Mondrian (see colour
reproduction, No. 6, page 20) were all
painted in 1917 that is, just over 50
years ago, though less radical paint¬
ings by Léger and Feininger scored
high rankings in the poll.
Equally revealing, reports Dr. Hein¬
rich, are some of the results obtained
by the use of "control" paintings in 20
of the 23 sets of postcard reproduc¬
tions. These "controls" were chosen
mainly from the works of artists of the
second half of the 19th century, but
also included works by Chardin (18th
century) and Vermeer (17th century)
and a number of more "conservative"
20th century paintings.
With few exceptions, the control
paintings ended up in the most favour¬
ed positions and the next two highest
rankings in each set generally went to
works closest in spirit to the control
paintings.
"Regardless of the range of style
and expression offered in any one
group," writes Dr. Heinrich, "the
choice went unerringly in favour of the
least radical, the most nearly conser¬
vative paintings available. Such other¬
wise popular artists as Degas, Renoir
and Monet all dropped to middle or
low rankings when their more experi¬
mental, less conventional pictures
were included."
Commenting on some of the conclu¬
sions that can already be drawn
from the inquiry, Dr Heinrich notes
that if people are offered a sufficiently
wide range of paintings, they are quite
prepared to demonstrate by a choice,
if not by a reasoned explanation, which
painting they like, regardless of how
little they know about art.
Generally speaking, however, people
find it much easier to say what they
do not like. "Our study seems to
show," writes Dr. Heinrich, that 'like'
is a charged word susceptible of wide
interpretations, none of which necess¬
arily includes the idea of enjoyment,
but that 'dislike' is a widely shared
sensation or emotion."
The inquiry revealed the sort of
things in modern art that people clearly
dislike, that upset them and that even
arouse their hostility. Among these dis¬
likes are non-traditional representa¬
tions of religious subjects (as in Gau¬
guin's "Yellow Christ", see page 17),
angular spiky lines (with the notable
exception of the works of Bernard Buf¬
fet), distortion of familiar objects, pic¬
tures expressing menace or doom
(although Van Gogh's "Cornfield with
Crows" was an exception, see pages
16-17), and paintings which give
people the impression that the artist is
trying to fool them. Also, and
unaccountably, pictures of fish appear
to be disliked.
w
V W HAT people dislike above
all is- a painting that is unintelligible to
them.
"They are accustomed in verbal
terms to clear, declarative statements
and expect the same in art," writes
Dr. Heinrich. "It no longer appears that
they expect a painting to tell a story
or point a moral, but unless it presents
an apprehensible image which they can
at least feel, they will reject it.
"We found gratifyingly little rejection
on grounds of indecency or racial pre¬
judice," he reports, "but over and over
again encountered the feeling that our
respondents were being put upon by
artists who didn't care to be 'under¬
stood' by ordinary people. They are
clearly of the opinion that 'good' art
has meaning and is meant to be fairly
readily grasped by anyone of average
intelligence.
"Visual confusion upsets them and
they complain of it under diverse cir¬
cumstances it often seems to mean
a densely activated surface but, almost
as often, either prolific detail or appa¬
rently unrelated but insistent detail.

"References to social problems
seem... to be out of place. Images
overtly or otherwise suggestive of
catastrophe, human or social decay or
other negative aspects of life as they
understand it are offensive and viewed
as deliberately destructive. What is
commonplace on television in the way
of violence and other distortions of life
is not, in their view, equally accept¬
able as subject matter for painting."
Other reactions noted by the art
specialists in Toronto:
Geometrical forms are only accept¬
ed if dominant and simple, and circles
and ovals seem to be preferable to
squares and rectangles, but must not
be "blurry" or "fuzzy".
The male form may be depicted
more or less as it is ; distortions of
the female shape are not tolerated to
any degree.
"Drab," "dull" or "jarring" (usually
meaning "bright") colours are often
criticized. Predominant reds or greens
are found highly distasteful except in
landscapes. Purple and strong violet
arouse no comment. "Unnatural"
colours are resented (as in Gauguin's
"Yellow Christ," and also in the same
artist's "Three Puppies"). Yet Franz
Marc's "Tower of Blue Horses" (see
pages 10-11) received a high ranking,
the fact that the horses are recogniz¬
able as horses perhaps overcoming
objections to their "unreal" colour.
In his final summing up of find¬
ings that emerge from the Toronto
inquiry, Dr. Heinrich notes encoura¬
gingly that even those persons who .
claimed a total disinterest in art of any
kind, let alone contemporary art, prov¬
ed to have some opinions and display¬
ed some feeling for art. "These people,
a great many more than we think, are
accessible and can be pursuaded to
become interested in modern art," he
affirms.
At a time when a profound re-exam¬
ination of the role of the museum in
modern life Is being made throughout
the world, do the preliminary findings
of the inquiry suggest new ways in
which the museum can help bridge
the gap between what today's artist
creates and what the general public is
prepared to accept?
One member of the working com¬
mittee who thinks that they do is
Mr. William Withrow, Director of the
Art Gallery of Ontario. The clear

FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL. Jean-François Millet's The Ángelus (above
and in colour. No. 9 on page 25), painted in 1859, certainly "rang the bell" with
people polled in the Toronto inquiry on the public and modern art. It was rated top
favourite out of the 220 paintings used in the survey. Paintings by Renoir, Cézanne
and Monet also found favour with the public whose tastes have been clearly shown
to lean towards well-known, older works. At the other end of the scale it was "thumbs
down" for Jean Dubuffet's La Barbe des Incertains Retours, (below) painted a
century after The Ángelus; nearly 80 per cent found Dubuffet's work totally incom¬
prehensible, many stating flatly that it was "not art". Other famous painters, such
as Léger, de Kooning, Miro and Pollock, received scant credit in the Toronto poll.

Toronto's choices
in order of preference
Right, a set of 10 postcards used in the Toronto inquiry on modern painting. The paintings
shown here are numbered from 1 to 10 in descending order of preference. No. 1, Vermeer's
The Artist in his Studio, being the painting most preferred and No. 10, the least. This set
includes the Picasso painting reproduced in full colour on our front cover which was ranked 7th.
The inquiry was carried out using postcard-size colour reproductions of paintings in 23 sets
of 10 cards per set. Each interviewee was shown only 4 sets of 10 cards. For one of these
sets he (or she) was invited to place the paintings in order of preference and was then asked
to answer a number of questions, such as: "Have you seen any of these pictures before?";
"Can you see any reason why they should have been placed together in a group ?" (the Toronto
researchers had arranged for each set to present a common overall idea, link, theme, form or
pattern).
This last question was asked about each of the other 3 sets for which the interviewee was
asked to designate only two works: the one he liked most and the one he liked least. It should
be emphasized that neither the names of the painters nor the names of the paintings were revealed
by the interviewers. Most sets contained a "control" painting by a famous artist not from the
20th century. Here the control is the Vermeer which, interestingly enough, came out No. 1.
After studying the order of preference indicated by the persons interviewed and the reasons
advanced, the Toronto investigators concluded that "realism, spatial depth and clear outlines
were strongly preferred", and that paintings considered too "satirical" or "abstract" were
rejected : the Vieira da Silva with its predominance of red, was not at all liked and was classed
last in this set.
This issue reproduces (in black and white and colour) eleven other sets of paintings out of the
total of 23 used in the poll. The remarks and comments contained in the accompanying captions
are largely based on the observations of the art specialists in Toronto who examined the results,
particularly Theodore A. Heinrich, Professor of the History of Art at York University, Toronto,
whose special analysis of the findings, published in Unesco's quarterly magazine "Museum",
has been extremely useful.

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART
(Continued)
relationship shown by the inquiry be¬
tween familiarity with a work of art
and the public's preference for that
work provides one obvious line of
approach.
"In all efforts to educate," writes
Mr. Withrow, "begin with the known
(i.e. the loved and accepted) and move
to the unknown. This is a simple and
well-known pedagogical principle
which naturally operates effectively in
all fields, but is particularly essential
in art education. Obvious ? Yes, but
how many times has the principle been
violated or ignored in a museum tour
or lecture with the result that the au¬
dience became restless before the lec¬
turer had a chance to win confidence

and move through prejudices to a new
appreciation of the unfamiliar?"
There are implications too, Mr. With-
row points out, for the practical ap¬
proach to organizing exhibitions of
modern art. In selecting reproductions
for use on posters advertising an
exhibition, for example, the organizer
should choose works that are likely
to be known to the public or which deal
with a theme that is familiar.
Layout of the exhibition can be ar¬
ranged in such a way as to help the
visitor understand and appreciate what
he sees. Careful grouping and posi¬
tioning of pictures can emphasize the
artist's intent and make it easier for the
visitor to discern certain formal as¬
pects of a painter's work that the in¬
quiry shows generally baffle the public.
Diagrams and labels attached to
pictures displayed could well be devot¬
ed to explanation of the work rather
than to a mass of biographical detail
about the artist, and the technical jar¬
gon often employed in exhibition cata¬
logues should be replaced by simple,
clear terms that anyone can under¬
stand.
"It cannot be over-emphasized,"
says Mr. Withrow, "that this study
was initiated In order to establish and
test a method. It therefore cannot be
judged in any other terms. That the
results to date are of limited use, no
one denies. What we look forward to
is the application of the method in
other cities in many countries.
"During the next few years, it is
also hoped that the method will be
refined and improved and that a more
precise scientific interpretation can
be made of the collected results. The
art museum director will have a for¬
midable body of facts upon which he
can base his efforts to reach a large
audience. In the meantime, having
been warned by the preliminary find¬
ings of the Toronto study, he might
start by taking a hard look at the tech¬
niques of presentation and education
now used in his own museum."

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
Here, Paul Cezanne's Boy with
the Red Waistcoat (in full colour
on back cover) was voted top
choice. In the paintings which took
the first five places there is "less
deviation from realism" than in the
other five. The subjects are easily
recognizable, the outlines are firm
and perspective is respected.
Ranked very low (eighth place)
Matisse's La Blouse Roumaine
was said to be "not serious enough
for art " and its style was even
compared with a comic strip.
Despite the "unreal use of colour"
Franz Marc's Tower of Blue
Horses was placed second, appa¬
rently because the people polled
felt that the horses were "recogni¬
zable and gave an impression of
strength and vitality".

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART (Continued)
The first eight paintings in this series
differ strikingly from the last two in
at least one respect: their subject is
easily recognizable. Carl Hofer's
Water Girl was preferred to the
Renoir, Degas and Picasso because,
according to many of the persons
polled, the picture had a certain
"calm monumentality". The control
painting by Chardin (an 18th century
work), unlike other older works used
in the inquiry, received a fairly low
rating. The painting by Max Beckmann
depicting Three Dancing Girls was
considered vulgar and even "per¬
verse". Nevertheless it was preferred
to the Severini (No. 9) and the Léger
(No. 10) which were given the lowest
ratings because they were considered
too jumbled up, confused and abstract.
The attitudes expressed in Toronto on
these paintings illustrate one of Pro¬
fessor Heinrich's conclusions, that
"what may be commonplace on tele¬
vision in the way of violence and
other distortions of life is not equally
acceptable as subject matter for
painting."

The ten paintings in this set were
grouped in the poll under the heading
"Calligraphy" Interestingly enough,
the far preferred painting was the
hauntingly beautiful Piazza of Zao
Wou-ki. A French painter of Chinese
origin, he was born in Peking in 1920.
Calligraphy and painting have a com¬
mon origin in China, both using the
same instrument (the brush), the same
materials (the special Chinese ink
known in English under the misnomer
"Indian ink"), and have had a parallel
development for several millenia. Al¬
though Zao Wou-ki enjoys doing
calligraphy. Piazza is not actually a
work of calligraphy. When con¬
fronted with Mark Tobey's Awaken¬
ing Night, the persons polled in
Toronto placed it last, well after
the two Picasso's which scored well
here (3rd and 4th places) and the first
of the two Klee's (5th). Klee's
This Star Teaches Humility (9th)
was compared to a child's painting.
The Tobey was felt to be annoyingly
overcrowded and "busy".

The paintings of this group,
entitled "Figures in Isolation" are
all expressive of anxiety, menace,
alienation or doom. Most of the
persons shown the set felt that
there was something "morbid"
about all of the paintings. Some
even went so far as to use the
expression "nauseating". Despite
this, a small but significant number
admitted that the artists showed a
good deal of imagination. The
paintings ranked first and second
a Picasso from the Blue Period
(1904) and A Day at the Fair
by the American artist Andrew
Wyeth were both felt to express
human loneliness and were pre¬
ferred. The Van Gogh (the control
painting) was placed third and
was liked for its intense yellows
and blues, whereas Gauguin's
Yellow Christ was often criti¬
cized for its greenish yellow colour
and angular lines and wound up
next to last.

First and second places went to the
two oldest paintings in this set, a
Renoir and a Manet. The series was
supposed to illustrate the common
idea of "Rhythm" whatever that
means but none of the persons
interviewed could see any common
denominator in the ten paintings.
The Dubuffet work referred to on
page 7 was included in this set and,
as we have seen, caused an uproar of
indignation. The Self-Portrait of
Picasso, here rated last but one
though executed as early as 1906
during the artist's "Rose Period", was
liked far less than his Maternité
(5th place) dating from 1921. There
is a similar gap between the rankings
of the two works by Gauguin in this
series. Riders on the Shore (4th) and
The Spirit of the Dead Watches
(8th). We remind readers that neither
the names of the painters nor the
titles of the works were given to the
persons interviewed when they were

Many persons grimaced when shown
this set of paintings. It is interesting
to note that the works given the top
four ratings all contain human figures
in their composition in contrast with
the other six which do not. This set
again offers striking evidence of the
dislike for non-representational art by
the persons polled in Toronto. Sugai's
painting, rated second from last, is in
reality a highly representational work.
Entitled Oni, it resembles the Japa¬
nese word for a kind of devil. The
painting is a stylization of the Chi¬
nese-Japanese ideogram meaning
"devil". Of course, none of the
persons interviewed knew this nor,
no doubt, did any of the pollsters.
