silent lives
"What has happened to
the Tuareg, the legendary
lords of the desert? How
have they adapted to
sedentary life? I wanted
to find out with my own
eyesin other words
with my cameraabout
the life they are living
today. During two visits,
in 1991 and 1993, 1 was
given a warm welcome by
sedentary Tuareg families
in the Hoggar (Algerian
Sahara). I shared their
daily lives. I saw the
meagre sustenance they
get from their vegetable
gardens and their goats,
and from the money
earned by the menfolk as
camel-drivers or guides
for tourists (when there
are any). My photos are
glimpses of the lives of
people who cling proudly
to their traditional way of
life."
