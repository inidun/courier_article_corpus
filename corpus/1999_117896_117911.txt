TA K ING THE SWEAT
OUT OF SWEAT SHOPS

Thanks to an alliance between northern consumers and workers in the South hundreds 
of companies have adopted codes of conduct designed to improve labour conditions

From London to Nicaragua, c o n s u-
m e rs and wo r k e rs are uniting to at t a c k
an age-old scourge: swe at s h o p s. M a j o r
consumer campaigns are gaining gr o u n d
across We s t e rn Europe and North A m e ri c a
by joining forces with non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGOs) and trade unions in
the South to demand respect for workers’
basic rights.
The roots of the campaigns go back to the
l ate 1980s, when NGOs and trade unions
began working together to mobilize and chan-
nel gr owing public awareness and outrage
over exploitat i ve labour practices as countri e s ,
p a rticularly in the South,competed for foreign
i nvestment by denying wo r k e rs ’f u n d a m e n-
tal rights (like joining a trade union) and large
companies relocated fa c t o ries from country
to country in search of cheap labour.
The campaigns have basically taken two
a p p r o a c h e s.The firs t , dubbed fair trade ini-
t i at i ve s , seeks to help small producers in
d e veloping countries receive a fair price for
their wo r k . NGOs help them by promoting
niche markets for their products—ranging
from handwoven rugs to coffee beans.
Eventually, the producers also gain access
to mainstream markets,with special labels
indicating their “fair trade” products.
In the second spate of campaigns, r e f e r-
red to as ethical trade initiat i ve s ,N G O s ,t r a d e
unions and consumers pressure (via petitions
and demonstrations) large multinat i o n a l
companies to adopt codes of conduct res-
pecting minimum labour standards for their
fa c t o ries and those of their suppliers.W h i l e
both kinds of campaign can complement one
a n o t h e r , they have different aims. Labels aim
at helping individual producers in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s , whereas codes seek to improve
labour conditions in mainstream industri e s
such as retailing and manufa c t u ring textiles,
c l o t h i n g,f o o t wear and toys in both the Nort h
and South.

r e r , which agreed to a code of conduct after
a heated consumer campaign in North A m e-
rica and Europe backed up by media exposés
of labour abuse in Indonesia, China and
Thailand. Clothing companies like Levi
S t r a u s s , Liz Clairborne and The Gap have
also adopted codes to protect their brand
n a m e s.While there is no precise data concer-
ning the number of companies adopting
c o d e s , the Intern ational Labour Organisa-
tion (ILO) counted and reviewed more than
200 codes in a 1998 report .O ver 80 per cent
of the codes had been adopted by multina-
tional enterp ri s e s , mostly based in the Nort h .
A new departure
The code campaigns can be seen as a
response to the stark failure of gove rn m e n t s
and multilateral institutions to help ensure
a fair distribution of trade benefits to wor-
k e rs and small producers. With gove rn-
ments and business increasingly hostile to
s t at u t o ry regulation and trade unions since
the late 1980s, the campaigning gr o u p s
h ave focused on market-based mechanisms
to achieve social and environmental goals.
The code campaigns have made it
easier to build consensus between nort h e rn
and southern NGOs than previous
attempts at reforming the world trading
system.Trade union proposals in the mid-
1990s for a wo r k e rs ’ rights clause at the
World Trade Organizat i o n1, for example,
were viewed with great suspicion by many
d e veloping country gove rn m e n t s.They saw
such clauses as a new form of nort h e rn pro-
tectionism aimed at keeping cheaper sou-
t h e rn goods out of their markets.They we r e
also mindful of past campaigns gone awry:
consumer boycotts backfired as companies
simply changed suppliers or relocated their
fa c t o ri e s.The result: lost jobs, not improve d
working conditions.The codes mark a new
d e p a rture by stressing the need for co-ope-
r at i o n : companies are encouraged to adopt
1 The International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions (ICFTU) has suggested a social or
workers’ rights clause that would make WTO
privileges conditional on compliance with a set of
internationally agreed fundamental workers’
rights. The ILO would retain the role of
monitoring and judging infringements.

tions must play a central role in deve l o p i n g
and implementing codes. In the Dominican
R e p u b l i c, for example, the non-gove rn-
mental organization CIPAF (Research
Centre for Action on Women) is joining
forces with Oxfam to develop a code for
wo r k e rs in the free trade zones.The Domi-
nican campaign is linked to a wider netwo r k
of wo m e n ’s associations trying to improve
labour conditions across Central A m e ri c a
under the banner, “ Wo r k , ye s — but with
d i g n i t y ! ” (See article next page.)
E ven though the Dominican constitu-
tion and labour code enshrine the right to
freedom of association and collective bar-
g a i n i n g, m a ny companies in the free trade
zones prevent unionization by intimidat i n g
and black-listing organizers , while massive l y
h i ring temporary wo r k e rs.According to local
N G O s ,c o n f r o n t ation was the traditional res-
p o n s e , with wo r k e rs ’o r g a n i z ations denoun-
cing company violations and employe rs dis-
puting the allegat i o n s , while threatening to
m ove their operations to other countri e s.
The gove rnment was left paralyzed, f e a r f u l
of losing jobs. H owe ve r , these dynamics are
n ow changing in the Dominican Republic.
G i ven the campaign’s intern ational expo-
s u r e , companies are now beginning to nego-
t i ate with wo r k e rs and gove rnment to pro-
duce a joint code of conduct for all free trade
zones in the country.
Practice lags
behind rhetoric
While the campaigns mark a major step
forward, they have limits. Codes can com-
plement but not replace government regu-
l at i o n . G ove rnments are ultimately res-
ponsible for enforcing human rights and
the rule of law. However imperfectly they
perform this role in practice, they are the

a strategy of long-term engagement with
s u p p l i e rs to improve working conditions
over time, r ather than taking the simpler
but potentially more damaging route of
w i t h d r awing their business when labour
a buses are found and highlighted by consu-
mer campaigns.
For codes to be effective , they must meet
a few basic conditions. F i rs t , all releva n t
a c t o rs—especially wo r k e rs — h ave to be invo l-
ved in their design and implementat i o n .N o t
only must they include the seven core ILO
c o nventions (assuring respect for human
rights at the wo r k p l a c e , including freedom of
a s s o c i ation and collective bargaining) bu t
they must address local concern s , l i k e
m i grant labour.The codes should also apply
to “ fle x i b l e ” and informal sector wo r k e rs
where possible and promote long-term enga-
gement to improving conditions. I n d e p e n-
dent ve ri fic ation is indispensable.
Boosting morale 
and productivity
In the UK, for example, the top five retai-
l e rs , including Marks & Spencer and C&A,
h ave agreed to adopt ethical codes of conduct
after three ye a rs of consumer lobbying gal-
vanized by the Clothes Code Campaign laun-
ched by Oxfa m ,an intern ational non-gove rn-
mental aid organizat i o n . Thousands of
c o n s u m e rs petitioned the companies, w h i l e
O x fam staff made the case for ethical trade
with senior corp o r ate managers who soon
s aw the commercial advantages of the codes.
A code can do more than just safeguard a
c o m p a ny ’s public image.By improving wo r-
king conditions, a code can boost staff morale
and productivity—both essential for making
a company more competitive .
H owe ve r , consumer support is only one
p a rt of the equat i o n : local labour associa-

body best suited to mediate between the
different interest groups in society when
setting and enforcing labour standards.
Another key concern is that corporate
practice often lags behind the rhetoric of
support for ethical trade.In a 1998 review
of 215 codes of conduct, the ILO found
that only 15 per cent included freedom of
a s s o c i ation and collective bargaining. O n l y
25 per cent of the codes had provisions to
p r e vent forced labour—or the refusal to
contract with companies using forced
l a b o u r.And ve ry few had monitoring requi-
rements.
The ILO also points out the arbitrary
n ature of consumer pressure campaigns
which mainly single out companies with a
brand name to protect.They also tend to
focus on exporting companies and so do
not necessarily cover wo r k e rs in the domes-
tic sector.
Fear of
bureaucracy
But these are arguments for improving
the initiat i ves rather than abandoning them
altogether. Some of the problems could be
in part rectified by a shift to home-grown
i n d u s t ry or sector-wide codes of conduct
which would promote greater involvement
by developing country suppliers and
governments.The ILO might also help to
d e velop an intern ationally agreed model
code of conduct—although this might
spark resistance.
Some NGOs are concerned that ILO
i nvo l vement would ove r l y - bu r e a u c r at i z e
the campaigns. Some developing country
governments are also wary of ILO support
for these schemes out of fear of northern
protectionism.
The campaigns are now at a crossroads.
Hundreds of codes have been adopted by
c o m p a n i e s , the next step lies in applying
them.One thing is certain:the impetus for
vo l u n t a ry initiat i ves will not go away as long
as the wo r k e rs fail to receive a fair distri-
bution of the wealth they help to create. n
