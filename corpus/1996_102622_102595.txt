Sharing knowledge
by Pierre Lena
Above, the European
Southern Observatory
(ESO) at La Silla (Chile)
is situated 2,400 metres
above sea level in the
Atacama Desert, where
the skies can be studied
300 days a year because
of the extreme clarity of
the air.
PIERRE LENA,
of France, teaches at the
University of Paris VII. His
most recent published work
is Méthodes physiques de
l'observation ("Physical
Methods of Observation",
1995).
At a time when there is a
worldwide trend for knowl¬
edge to become the pre¬
serve of the most highly developed
countries, one of the major prob¬
lems facing the university system is
that of sharing the information
accumulated by the major scien¬
tific research centres.
The critical point for the
transfer of knowledge comes
when students from the devel¬
oping countries who have
obtained their doctorates in the
industrialized countries return
home to put their knowledge to
use. They find that there are few
satisfactory job opportunities
and in many cases are isolated in
their research. Even students
from the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics established
by Professor Abdus Salam in Tri¬
este (Italy) find themselves in a
similar situation. The problem is
that there is at present no real
concerted policy which would
allow scientific centres to come
into being outside the industrial¬
ized countries.
Chile is an especially inter¬
esting case in this respect. It has
some of the best sites in the
world for astronomy, and the
United States, Europe and Japan
a re all interested in them. For the
country's own scientific develop¬
ment to benefit from this natural
asset, now being exploited by
others, it would be fairly logical
to envisage a kind of "levy" on
telescopes installed by foreign
countries, i.e. by making them
available for part of the time to
Chilean scientists. Negotiations
on these lines are being carried
out with Europe and have already
been concluded with the United
States.
But opportunities for access
to technical equipment, however
powerful the equipment may be,
are not in themselves a guarantee
of sustainable scientific develop¬
ment. Building a scientific com¬
munity is a long process that,
even when conditions are
favourable, does not always pro¬
duce immediate results. A reason¬
able aim for Chile would be to set
up an International Centre for the
Sciences of the Universe, possibly
to be shared by the whole of Latin
America, playing a similar role to
that played for physics in Europe
by the Trieste Centre.
