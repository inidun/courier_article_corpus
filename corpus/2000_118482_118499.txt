March 27, 1 9 9 6 , it was thronged with the city’s joy-
ful inhabitants who had come to get a look at “the
flame of peace”, which danced before them as 3,000
guns were burned,to signal with a flourish the end
of the “northern rebellion”.
O ver the six preceding ye a rs , first the Malian
a rmy and then vigilante groups of the sedentary
black Ganda Koy people had fought a war against
Tuareg and Arab rebels. Many civilians were killed
and about 200,000 nomads (about a fifth of the
population of the North) fled.
In choosing negotiation and sponsoring meet-
ings between the communities to end the fighting,
President Konaré’s Mali won a solid intern at i o n a l
r e p u t ation as a champion of the culture of peace.
The intern ational community provided consider-
able technical and financial aid (development assis-
tance makes up 20 per cent of Mali’s budget) and
the country was held up as an example. D e s p i t e
recent troubling deve l o p m e n t s , the United Nat i o n s
hails Mali as an island of tranquillity in an ocean of
wa rs and autocratic regi m e s. S y m b o l i c a l l y,T i m-
buktu has recently been awarded Unesco’s Cities
for Peace prize.

At President Konaré’s instigation,the authori-
ties always use kid gloves when trying to curb 
“ r e s i d u a l ” violence and new local confli c t s. In recent
ye a rs , especially 1999, s e veral communities in the
N o rth and in the we s t e rn Sahel—the country ’s other
“ p r o b l e m ” r e gi o n , on the borders with 
M a u ritania and Senegal—have been caught up in
bloody clashes.
“Negotiation and consensus are at the heart of
Sahelian culture, of which Mali is to some extent
the epicentre,” s ays historian Doulaye Konat é ,w h o
has just completed a study of how Malians see the
culture of peace.“ We live in societies that are dive r-
s e , hierarchical and ve ry conflictual, where 
we can’t live together unless eve ryone makes 
concessions.”
Community peacemakers
M a rriage is used to strengthen ties between clans
and between communities. A vast network of
alliances has also arisen from sacred pacts betwe e n
the ancestors. S a n a n k o u ya ( “ r e l ationship through
jokes”) is a practice that brings together gr e at fa m i-
lies such as the Diarras and the Traorés,socio-pro-
fessional groups (Peul herders and smiths) and
peoples such as the Dogon and the Sonrhai.“S a n a n-
k o u n” h ave a duty to help one another and to inter-
vene in conflicts between their allies and
outsiders.
Some members of the community specialize
in peacemaking. G riots (story t e l l e rs) and smiths are
the peacemakers among the Mandingo and Bam-
bara people, while village chiefs and 
councils of wise men (ulemas and leading citizens)
p e r f o rm this role in Arab-Berber cultures. “ We ’r e
lucky this tradition still exists,” s ays Mahamadou 
D i a g o u r a g a , the gove rn m e n t ’s commissioner in the
n o rt h . “The traditional chiefs, the priests and the
notables are still listened to, even if it’s hard to talk
to the young people.”
When potentially explosive incidents occur, t h e
a u t h o rities gather these conciliat o rs together for
s e veral day s , with the help of the United Nat i o n s
(especially the UN Development Programme) and
m a ny national and intern ational NGOs. “ Pe o p l e
are all worked up when they arrive, but when they
get talking about their history and all the other things
they have in common,they usually end up making
peace with each other,” s ays Firoun Maiga, a for-
mer Ganda Koy combatant.
For the past seven ye a rs , the gove rnment has
been relying on this underlying cultural cohesion to
t ry to keep the peace. President Konaré says he
wants to build a model democracy based on the
Malian tradition of seeking consensus. The 

o f t - r e p e ated project of this unive rsity lecturer and
son of a teacher, with his approachable manner and
r e p u t ation for honesty, seems to be one of the most
promising in A f ri c a . He wants freedom to flo u ri-
s h , n ational identity and memory to be revive d ,
differences to be respected and grassroots 
democracy established.
His first task was to end the war and the 
m a r gi n a l i z ation of the Nort h ,a region which cove rs
nearly three-quart e rs of the country and has tra-
ditionally been a hotbed of rebellion.Sidelined for
decades and long administered by the military, i t
has been a prey to arbitrary rule and abject pover-
t y.The gr e at droughts of the 1970s and 1980s we r e
the last straw and the region exploded in 1990.
After the “ T i m buktu peace agr e e m e n t ” , t h e
g ove rnment set about bri n ging some 12,000 for-
mer rebels back into civilian life, s ays commissio-
ner Diagouraga.About 2,400 ex-combatants were
absorbed into the army and the civil serv i c e .A total
of 9,530 others were gi ven demobilization pay m e n t s
of 300,000 CFA francs (about $500), s o m e t i m e s
topped up with micro-credit to start a small bu s i-
n e s s. Only about 10 per cent of the former rebels
subsequently deserted the army or abandoned their
new civilian jobs and the rate of their absorp t i o n
into the pri vate sector is reckoned to be 70 per cent.
“Today you can even find Tuaregs in the presi-
d e n t ’s personal security unit,” s ays the armed forces
and veteran affa i rs minister, Mohamed Salia Soko-
na.
The gove rnment believes long-term peace can-
not be achieved unless pove rty is rolled back, so it
has spent money to try to bring the North up to the
l e vel of the rest of the country. “ We ’ ve built schools
and clinics, bored we l l s , and created ponds and ri c e
p a d d i e s ,” s ays Diagouraga. “This gove rnment has
done more in eight years than was done in the pre-
vious 30.”
“Nearly all the Tuaregs are semi-sedentary,” s ay s

ly integr ating them.They live in big camps where
there is often a school and sometimes a clinic. E a c h

Decentralization
As the final component in its peace plan and
to encourage people to organize their lives in one of
the wo r l d ’s poorest countri e s , the Konaré gove rn-
ment has set up 682 decentralized villages,adding
to the 19 that already existed.This reform is “ t h e
political answer to the rebellion,” s ays Ibrahim ag
Yo u s s o u f, a Undp consultant. “There is no other
choice.When everything is run from Bamako, you
see the result. Civil servants posted in the prov i n c e s
are either absentees or are only there to keep people
down.”

other. “It’s OK as long as the money keeps flowing
i n , but if it stops fighting will flare up again,” s ay s
a former combat a n t . On top of that , the pace of
completed projects is too slow and the democratic
process has suffered serious setbacks.
The disbu rsement of more than $200 million
e a rmarked for the development of the North has
been held up since 1995 by red tape,rampant cor-
ruption and the lengthy bu r e a u c r atic procedures of
the funding agencies,say all the experts.
“You can build schools,” says Youssouf, “but if
you want to hire a teacher, you have to have a gr e e n
light from the World Bank because Mali is under a
s t ructural adjustment progr a m m e .Who’ll pay the
teacher? The villages don’t have the money and the
g ove rnment has just enough to pay the civil
servants.”
Some jobless young people have got tired of wa i-
ting for the peace dividend and are choosing to go
abroad or make easy money by joining gangs of ban-
dits and smugglers who roam the country. C ri m e
is on the increase and large-scale smuggling of A m e-
rican cigarettes is gr ow i n g . A packet of Marlboros
bought for 250 CFA francs ($0.40) in Burkina Fa s o
sells for 650 ($1) in Mali and 850 ($1.30) in Alge-
ria.
The gove rnment does not have the means to
curb these illegal activities over such a wide area.
Local people are calling for military posts to be set
up again, on a temporary basis.“When the gove rn-
m e n t ’s strong, it crushes us,and now it’s we a k , we ’r e
dying,” says an inhabitant of Timbuktu.
“ D e m o c r a cy is a hard road to follow,” s t r e s s e s
Gen Amadou Toumani To u r é , who ove rthrew the
dictatorship of Moussa Traoré in 1991.Decentra -
l i z ation led to local elections in June 1999 which
upset the balance of powe r. The subsequent 
r e d e finition of terri t o rial boundaries has stirred up
old land disputes.
“The North is experiencing a social revo l u t i o n ,”
s ays Diagouraga. “ D e c e n t r a l i z ation disturbs peo-
p l e ’s habits and their vested interests and 
a rr a n g e m e n t s. Disputes are often settled under the
p a l aver tree and sometimes in court , but they can
also degenerate into explosions of violence.”
Clashes have already taken place. In the second
half of 1999 about 40 people were killed in the most
s e rious confrontat i o n ,b e t ween “ A r a b s ” and “ K o u n-
tas”(Muslim spiritual chiefs,who are also Arabs).
The minority Kountas, who lost the elections, r e f u-
se to yield control of an area they had dominat e d
for centuries.
Stalled political dialogue
The Arabs have become rich in recent times by
smuggling cigarettes, which has enabled them to
buy arm s , one of the country ’s most frequently tra-
ded items (see box).This old rivalry also takes the
f o rm of a “ m o d e rn ” political confli c t : the Koun-
tas have stood as candidates for the ruling A d e m a
p a rt y, while the Arabs have supported the 
opposition.
Political dialogue has been completely broken
off ever since the “failed”elections of 1997,which
human rights organizations said were marred by
m a ny irr e g u l a ri t i e s.They were boycotted by the
opposition and produced virtually a one-party 
parliament.
“ We don’t recognize the present institutions,”
snap Choguel Maiga and Mountaga Ta l l , the two
main opposition leaders , who accuse the gove rn-
ment of bias in settling local crises.
Such a situation is unlikely to boost the legi t i-
macy of the state,which sprang from colonial rule
and 23 ye a rs of dictat o rs h i p, or to strengthen the
a u t h o rity of modern institutions such as the legal
s y s t e m , which allegedly lacks resources and inde-
p e n d e n c e .And no one knows how much longer tra-
ditionalism can keep the lid on the old hatreds 
lurking beneath the Saharan sand. n
On March 27,1996, 3,000 weapons were burned in Timbuktu during a “flame of peace”ceremony.
