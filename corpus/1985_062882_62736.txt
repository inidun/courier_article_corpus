Libraries and archives
for tomorrow
by /. Stephen Parker
THE ability to communicate, not only
across great distances but also by
means of written and graphic
records, is a distinctively human
characteristic; and the creation, dissemina¬
tion, preservation and use of such records
are uniquely human activities which have
played a vital role in the development of
human civilization.
From earliest times organized collections
of records have been made for different
purposes. Libraries, as a rule, have brought
together records from many different
sources, for use particularly in research and
study. Archives, on the other hand, have
usually comprised collections of records
associated with a particular institution a
commercial firm, a government depart¬
ment, an academic institution or an entire
community brought together as a record
of its activities for administrative, legal or
historical reasons.
Broadly speaking, in many archives the
emphasis has been on preservation,
whereas, in libraries, greater emphasis has
usually been placed on use. Although it is
usually clear enough whether a particular
institution is a library or an archive (in fact,
many libraries contain collections of ar¬
chives and many archives maintain their
own libraries), the theoretical distinction
between them is by no means precise and
both may equally well be defined as "collec¬
tions of documentary or other records
organized for use".
The present century has seen an increas¬
ing emphasis on the final word of this
definition ("use") and the development of
ever more sophisticated and effective ways
of organizing such collections, of providing
guidance as to what they contain and of
providing a variety of services to their users
to help ensure that they are used to their
maximum advantage.
Documentation services, designed to pro¬
vide access to the contents of documents
through indexes, abstracts and the like, and
information services, intended to extract

from documentary and other sources
precisely those items of information re¬
quired by the user, have become increasing¬
ly important in recent years as the volume
of documents being produced throughout
the world has itself increased at an exponen¬
tial rate, as the needs of users have become
ever more sophisticated and as
developments in information technology
have made it possible to manipulate the vast
amounts of information now being
generated.
To meet potential users' vast range of
needs, a wide variety of institutions and ser¬
vices have been developed. In recent years
national, university, public, school and
special libraries, mobile libraries and
library services to the housebound and the
hospital patient, specialized documentation
and information services and archives in all
fields have been established with increasing
frequency.
The traditional demand for the complete
document is still being met, in many cases,
by allowing it to be studied in a reference
library or reading room, or by making it
available for loan; it may now also be met
by delivering a copy of the document, either
full size or in microform, and either by post
or by telefacsimile. The complete texts of
many documents are now being stored in
computer systems and made available for
consultation, possibly thousandsf of
kilometres away from the computer, either
on the screen of a visual display unit or in
paper copy produced on another com¬
puter's printer.
Computers also make it possible to
search the entire texts of such documents
for key words or phrases and thus to supply
users with specific items of information
without having to reproduce the document
in full. The identification of specific
documents, whatever their format, is now
made infinitely easier and quicker through
the creation of computerized bibliographic
databases containing millions of references
to documents of all kinds published in
almost all parts of the world. Computerized
databanks containing statistical and scien¬
tific data may also now be consulted
directly.
There have been suggestions that such
systems will one day render libraries and ar¬
chives obsolete, but it seems more likely
that, as with other modern communications
technologies such as television, they will
supplement existing methods rather than
supplant them, becoming generally ac¬
cepted particularly in those areas, such as
the provision of specific items of factual or
bibliographic information, where they are
clearly superior to traditional methods.
It must be recognized also that many of
the new mediafloppy discs, magnetic

tapes, laser discs, etc. are themselves
documentary records and thus are suscep¬
tible to the techniques of organization and
management which have been developed
and employed in libraries and archives for
many years.
The new media also bring new problems
for librarians and archivists. A record
which is created and permanently stored in
a computer may never have a hard copy
capable of being preserved in a conven¬
tional archive. Indeed, some documents are
specifically intended to be modified at will
by certain groups of users and thus may
never have, even in electronic format, an
identifiable "master" or archival text
which can be recognized as such for record
purposes. Even those which do have such a
master text, particularly if they are in
magnetic format, may create serious prob¬
lems of preservation and storage for
archivists.
Reference was made earlier to
bibliographic databases which may contain
references to documents published in
almost any part of the world. One difficult
and sensitive problem associated with the
new information technology is the great
and growing disparity between rich and
poor countries, not only in terms of gaining
access to such systems, but also in the extent
to which information which they
themselves have generated is made available
through such systems.
^SAs*.
Not only are the vast majority of the
computerized databases and databanks
located in the richer countries of the in¬
dustrialized world, chiefly in Europe and
North America, but an overwhelming pro¬
portion of the information they contain is
generated in and relates to the interests of
these same countries.
Access to such databases from almost
any part of the world where suitable
telecommunications facilities exist is cer- .
tainly possible, but it is often prohibitively
expensive, not only in terms of the charges
imposed by the information providers for
the use of the databases, but also in
telecommunications costs. Furthermore,
the information obtained at such expense is
often of only marginal relevance to the
needs and problems of the developing
world.
This is not a new problem. Librarians in
the developing countries have for many
years been faced with a lack of adequate
supplies of books and periodicals in local
languages that are relevant to local needs.
This raises the further problem of obtaining
foreign exchange to buy the only available
alternatives: expensive foreign books of
little relevance to their users' needs.
The need for programmes of book
development to help redress this imbalance
has long been recognized and, in some
countries significant progress has been
made. The growing dominance of the new
information technologies, exhibiting a
similar bias towards the interests of the in¬
dustrialized countries, suggests that the
time has come to devise and implement
similar programmes of information
development which will help the developing
countries to become more self-sufficient in
this respect.
Unesco has been concerned with these
problems ever since its inception. Its ac¬
tivities in the fields of library and book
development, often undertaken in col¬
laboration with other inter-governmental
and non-governmental bodies, have played
a major part, not only in drawing attention
to these problems, but also, in some cases at
least, in helping to solve them.
Unesco supports, for example, the ef¬
forts of the International Federation of
Library Associations and Institutions
(IFLA) to develop worldwide programmes
for Universal Bibliographic Control (UBC)
and Universal Availability of Publications
(UAP), whilst its own Records and Ar¬
chives Management Programme (RAMP),
which operates within the framework of the
Unesco General Information Programme,
is implemented in close collaboration with
the International Council on Archives
(ICA).
Within the framework of its UNISIST
programme (also part of the General In]or-
mation Programme), Unesco has, since
1971, been collaborating with the Interna¬
tional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU)
and with other international bodies in at¬
tempting to lay the foundations for a world

scientific information system which would,
among other things, help to ensure a more
equitable distribution of scientific and
technological information throughout the
world.
These efforts are now also being applied
in support of the establishment of a global
information network under the auspices of
the United Nations itself, in accordance
with the recommendations ' of the United
Nations Conference on Science and
Technology for Development (UNCSTD),
held in Vienna in 1979.
Despite the changes being brought about
by the introduction of new information
technology, there seems little doubt that
libraries and archives will continue to be
needed throughout the world in the
foreseeable future. A well organized library
is much more than just a source of informa¬
tion, and a well organized archive is not
merely a repository of facts. The impor¬
tance of both types of institution lies in the
fact that, in their different ways, they bring
documents into physical juxtaposition, in
an environment conducive to their study;
this provides an opportunity not merely for
the retrieval of known facts but also for
seeking knowledge, inspiration and wisdom,
as well as recreation and enlightenment.
J. STEPHEN PARKER, of the United
Kingdom, is editor of the new international
journal Information Development and chair¬
man and managing director of Library
Development Consultants International Ltd.,
Bath, England. He was the first director of the
National Library Service of Botswana and has
undertaken assignments for many national
and international bodies. From 1981 to 1982
he was editor of the Unesco Journal of Infor¬
mation Science, Librarlanshlp and Archives.
In 1983, the Library of Congress of the
United States began experiments with
analog vldeodisks for storage and
retrieval of graphic and photographic
materials In colour. Already researchers
are using this system for speedy, non¬
destructive access to precious and fragile
visual materials. Experiments are also be¬
ing conducted with optical digital disks
that store Incredible quantities of print
material with high resolution. A one-sided
12-Inch digital disk can store between
10,000 and 20,000 pages of text depen¬
ding on the resolution required. One side
of an analog disk can store up to 54,000
Images. Above, the "Juke-box", a
