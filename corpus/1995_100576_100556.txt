ft How did you first come
into contact with the
cinema?
I came to the cinema rather late in
life, because I had eyesight problems
as a child. I was already thirteen when
the doctors found a cure. It was then
that I discovered the world electricity
wires, for example, which I had never
seen before, and of course the
cinema. I think the first film which left
its mark on me was Helen of Troy
(1955), an American costume drama.
First, I wanted to be an actor. Of
course my father objected. Then I saw
a documentary and I realized that films
could be made without actors. It was
a revelation. I remember the film was
about Calcutta.
Fortunately, I had an uncle who
was a film director in Bombay. In fact he
was well known. His name was
Mahesh Kaul. I met him and he was
kind enough to tell my father not to
insist too much on his opposition to
my plans. He even advised him to send
me to the film school In Pune. I spent
three years there and still have excellent
memories of it. I remember one remark¬
able teacher in particular: Ritwik
Ghadak, who was himself a director.
I studied under his guidance and I

the Earth").
think I was his favourite pupil. But I
betrayed him. When I saw Robert
Bresson's Pickpocket (1 959), my out¬
look changed completely. From then
on I swore by Bresson, whom I met
later in Paris that was a red letter day
for me.
One Indian film left a deep impres¬
sion on me at the time, and that was
Abrar Alvi's The Master, the Mistress
and the Slave (1 962), with Guru Dutt.
I saw it about twenty times, because a
friend of mine had a cinema in Jaipur.
The film portrays the disintegration of
a land-owning family. It was a big hit
throughout India. I also saw many
American films and films by the great
Indian masters.
I began by making commissioned
documentaries. I made one on civics,
for example. In 1968, I started work
on my first full-length feature film.
Because of a strike which went on for
several months, It took two years to
complete. Then I went on as best I
could, often going back to documen¬
taries. In my films I tried to put across
my great interest in the theatre, music
and Indian song. Without sacrificing
my own tastes, I am always searching
for that elusive rapport with the public
which is indispensable to us film¬
makers.
ft What about television in
India?
It began in the early 1 960s, but the
big event was the broadcast of the
Asian Games in 1982. In the days of
Indira Gandhi, television was system¬
atically regarded as a means of educa¬
tion. Everything was in the hands of
the state, with no private involvement.
That situation lasted for a long time.
Only one cinema film was shown
each week. The other programmes
dealt mostly with agriculture and

Industry (as in communist countries),
although there were some about
music, yoga and science. There was
no competition whatsoever with the
cinema.
All that changed in 1984. First
because of the appearance of pirate
videos. The lack of copyright protec¬
tion opened the door to Intensive
piracy. "Video rooms" opened all over
the country to show pirate copies of
films made very cheaply in very poor
conditions.
At the same time, television itself
changed. It began to make soap
operas and open up to private invest¬
ment. That was the second threat after
pirate videos. This time the cinema
was hard hit. Many films lost money,
something which had been very
unusual until then.
Today twenty-five channels can
be widely received and the number
is growing. We also receive foreign
channels, especially American chan¬
nels such as CNN and MTV. As a
result, Indian girls are abandoning
their traditional costume and wearing
jeans and other Western-style clothes.
The audience has also changed
both for the cinema and television.
Vulgarity and violence have appeared,
just like everywhere else. And one pri¬
vate channel is just like another. They
all broadcast more or less the same
programmes.
ft Are fewer films being
made than before?
No. Strangely enough, the number
of films being made has hardly
changed and the geographical distrib¬
ution of film production is much the
same as before. Four states (out of
twenty-five) account for half the
output. The list is headed by films
made in Tamil in Tamil Nadu State in
the south, followed by films made in
A potter and his grand¬
daughter in Mani Kaul's
Mati Manas, a
documentary on the
history of pottery.
Telugu, also in the south. Hindi films
only occupy third place. Andhra
Pradesh State is also a major pro¬
ducer. Whenever a film is made in one
of these four systems, it is immediately
translated Into the other three lan¬
guages.
The Indian cinema is threatened
today by a real danger, apart from hard¬
ening of the arteries, and that is the
invasion of dubbed American films.
The offensive has been launched. We
wonder how we can react from inside
what we thought was a fortress. But,
despite its strong personality, India
clearly risks being faced with a major
problem: the gradual disappearance of
genuinely Indian images, words and
cinema, possibly leading to a loss of
identity.
