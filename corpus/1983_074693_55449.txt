BEFORE the Second World War, Bul¬
garia ranked among the agricultural¬
ly backward countries of Europe.
Agricultural land was divided into 12 million
plots and this fragmentation resulted in low
productivity and deteriorating social and
economic conditions. The peasants tilled the
land with wooden or crude iron ploughs,
harvested the crops with sickles and threshed
the corn with primitive, spike-studded
threshing boards.
Between 1940 and 1944 the average yield of
wheat was 999.5 kilograms per hectare, and
of maize 941 kilograms. The annual milk
yield of a dairy cow averaged about 500 litres
while wool production amounted to 2.5
kilograms per sheep. In the 1950s, most
villages were still without electricity and runn¬
ing water and had no public health, social or
cultural facilities.
The socialist reorganization of agriculture
followed three main directions: voluntary re¬
grouping of farming land through the
gradual establishment of co-operatives;
mechanization and re-equipment by means of
grants and long-term, low-interest loans and
the establishment of State tractor and
agricultural machinery centres; radical
transformation of the social conditions of life
of the rural population.
By about 1956, most of the individual land-
holdings had been re-grouped into co¬
operative farms. The rural workers made
redundant by this reorganizationtheir
numbers were swelled when the primitive

working implements of the past were con¬
signed to their rightful place in museums-
found new productive employment thanks
to the industrialization of the country and
the urban growth this entailed. Today over
65 per cent of the population live in the
towns, compared with 25 per cent in 1944,
whereas the working rural population
amounts to 20 per cent or less.
The period 1960 to 1970 saw further ad¬
vances in the restructuring of agriculture,
while urbanization developed apace. This
process, which took on a variety of forms
whose economic, political and social objec¬
tives nevertheless converged, involved
changes in the administrative and
managerial structures of the country.
Within the framework of the twenty-nine
main administrative units (the departments)
291 districts were established and the coun¬
try's 854 co-operative farms were
reorganized into 290 agro-industrial com¬
plexes. All the complexes of a department
together form a departmental agricultural
and industrial union and these unions in
turn are linked to constitute a national
agricultural and industrial union which has
the rank of a ministry, although it is not
financed by the State and functions along
traditional co-operative lines.

Thus, today, agriculture in Bulgaria is
fully integrated with the engineering,
chemical and processing industries as well
as with the various scientific organizations.
The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, with
its national network of scientific institutes
and experimental centres, as well as all
agricultural schools and colleges, are in¬
stitutional members of the union. All
members of the union retain their rights as
individual entities and are financially
autonomous with their own reserve funds.
Associated directly in this way with collec¬
tively organized labour, science and
technology become an integral part of
socialist agriculture, just as the farm
worker's labour becomes a form of in¬
dustrial labour.
In terms of output, agriculture in
Bulgaria has already reached the level of the
most advanced countries. In 1982, for ex¬
ample, average yields per hectare in
kilograms were: wheat 4,666, maize 5,771,
tomatoes 29,908, sugar beet 27,284, pep¬
pers 17,189, and potatoes 11,706. Bulgaria
now produces more than a ton of cereals per
head of population and average individual
consumption per year is: bread 216 kg,
meat 61.2 kg, animal and vegetable fats 21
kg, milk and dairy products 170 kg, sugar
and confectionery 35 kg, eggs 204.
Agriculture under private enterprise can
also achieve good results in quantitative
terms, but the salient feature of the history
of the development of socialist agriculture
is the radical transformation it has brought
about in the social situation and daily lives
of rural workers. In practical terms, this
transformation has meant a considerable
rise in the standard of living: complete
modernization of housing and consumer
goods household equipment, radio,
television and cars; equal pay for equal
work for men, women and young people;
introduction of a single social security and
pension system for agricultural, industrial
and clerical workers (women are eligible for
a pension at 55, men at 60); free medical
services and education for all. Bulgarian
villages have also been fully modernized in
all respectsarchitectural, communal,
cultural and social. Every village has its
public library and cinema, and a cultural
centre where the popular arts and traditions
are preserved and enriched, and is linked to
the rest of the country by a huge road and
rail network, telephone, telegraphic and
radio links and a modern postal service.
The old image of the isolated village cut
off from the world is today to be found only
in books or museums. Within a very short
time span socialist Bulgaria has succeeded
in resolving the age old antagonism between
town and country.
