THE SEASONS
OF THE NILE
A weather and farming
calendar from the time
of the Pharaohs
by Abdel Moneim El Sawi
N_ J early 2,500 years ago,
the Greek historian Herodotus de¬
scribed Egypt as "the gift of the Nile",
and ancient proverbs confirm how
closely life in Egypt has, since ancient
times, been bound up with the Nile,
with agriculture and with the weather.
Throughout history, the Egyptian has
expressed his feelings about the
weather in sayings and proverbs that
are still in current use today. Egyptian
proverbs are often related to the
months of the year and the weather
appropriate to them and its effect on
the state of irrigation and agriculture.
ABDEL MONEIM EL SAWI is editor of the
Arabic edition of the "Unesco Courier",
published in Cairo, and is chairman of the
Unesco National Publications Centre in
Egypt. A former Under-Secretary of the
Ministry of Culture of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, he is well known in the Arab world
for his novels, essays and radio and
television programmes
For the ancient Egyptians the year
was divided into three seasons directly
related to the flooding of the Nile, the
stages of agriculture and the type of
crops and the weather. These seasons
were:
The season of planting.
The season of inundation.
The season of harvest.
The flooding of the Nile was of
paramount importance in the beliefs
of the ancient Egyptians. To them the
floodwaters of the Nile were a sea of
tears shed by Isis in mourning for her
husband Osiris.
Considered as a token of well-being
and prosperity, the floods were
celebrated at the festival of Wafaa
el-Nile (the faithful Nile) during the
second half of August (Misra to the
ancient Egyptians).
A painting from the time of Ram-
eses II (about 1290 B.C.) depicts, a
ceremony of the "Wafaa el-Nile" festival
at which the "Calf of Ibis", three geese
and valuable presents were thrown
into the Nile. Popular belief had it that
a bride was also thrown into the
waters of the river as part of this
ceremony, but this was no more than
superstitious rumour.
The year in Pharaonic Egypt, and
later in the Coptic calendar, was astral
and was connected with the star Sirius.
The ancient Egyptian year was consi¬
dered to begin on the first of "Toot"
(11th of September).
According to the Pharaonic almanac
the months of the year and the
prevailing weather were as follows:
Toot (11 September - 10 October):
attributed to T-hoot, god of wisdom and
science and father of astronomy and
geometry, it coincides with the
appearance of Sirius at dawn. The
Ist of Toot was also called the feast
of Nayrooz (the Persian New Year),
a feast celebrated by Egyptians up to
the time of Sultan Barkook (end 14th

century). Toot is considered the start
of the inundation period and one
proverb says "Irrigate in Toot or you
will be too late." It is thought to be a
bad time for the rearing of chickens
and the hatching of eggs. "Chicks of
Toot", runs one saying, "eat and die."
Baba (11 October - 9 November):
attributed to the god of agriculture
(Bee-net-ret). The floodlands dry out
after the inundation and winter crops
are harvested. During this month there
is the tempest of the big flood, which
lasts six days.
There is some wind and the first
signs of winter are seen. "Baba has
entered and has closed the roads",
says one proverb, meaning that
Baba is the time to close doors to
keep out the cold. "The bride of Baba
is blackened with smut", goes another
saying, expressing the view that this
month of change is an unsuitable one
in which to get married.
Hatoor (10 November - 9 December):
attributed to the gods of love, beauty
and heaven. The land becomes
verdant, the cold becomes more
intense and the Nile waters become
clear again after the floods. Hatoor is
connected with rain and the growing
of wheat: "Hatoor is the father of
scattered gold", and, "If you fail to
plant in Hatoor, wait till the coming
year." To fishermen and sailors this
is the beginning of the stormy season.
Kiyahk (10 December - 8 January):
attributed to the god of welfare
(Kahaka). The days shorten and the
nights lengthen: "In Kiyahk your
morning takes the place . of your
evening." . . . "You rise from your bed
only to look for your supper." It is a
month of frost and intenser cold and
tempests.
Tooba (9 January - 7 February):
attributed to the god Tobias the
Supreme, the god of rains. The end of
Tooba is marked by days of biting cold.
"Tooba makes the old woman crip¬
pled", says one proverb, stressing the
discomfort caused to the elderly by
the cold.
Amsheer (8 February - 9 March):
attributed to the god of tempests. Hot
winds cause buds to break into
blossom, but there are many tempests:
"Amsheer tells the small plants to
catch up with the big plants." "Am¬
sheer is the father of many tempests."
A changeable month, Amsheer has
days of biting cold and this has given
rise to one of the most common
proverbs: "The name is that of Tooba,
but the act is that of Amsheer."
Baramhat (10 March - 8 April): Beans
ripen, the mulberry trees are green,
silk worm eggs hatch out and ears of
corn appear. It is the beginning of
spring: "In Baramhat go to the fields
and get what you want." It is marked
by the last and most violent tempest of
the year, the two-day "howling tem¬
pest": "There is no tempest like the
howling tempest."
Barmouda (9 April - 8 May): attri¬
buted to the sacred snake, Remoota,
the goddess of harvest. In this month
wheat and flax are harvested, honey
is gathered and bees multiply. As this
is the harvest season one saying goes:
"In Barmouda strike the shafts", which
means strike the stems of flax to
extract its fibres and thresh the corn.
Bashans (9 May - 7 June): attributed
to the god of light. Days become
much longer than the nights, the
temperature rises and there is virtually
no rain. This was the dry season when
the Nile was at its lowest and the land
was bare and cracked after the harvest.
In the past it was said: "Bashans
sweeps the ground completely." The
picture has now changed, however,
with various irrigation schemes and
the construction of the Aswan High
Dam.
Ba-oona (8 June - 7 July): attributed
to the god Khenti, god of minerals.
Ba-oona means stone and during this
month Egyptians used to leave their
fields and turn to mining and the
building of houses and temples. The
11th of Ba-oona (17 June) is called
"The Night of the Drop", because it
was believed that a divine teardrop
fell from heaven to cause the coming
of the floods.
Abeeb (8 July - 6 August): its name
is derived from that of the god of
happiness, Habi, to mark the coming
of the floods. The floodlands are
opened to receive the floodwater and
the grapes become sweeter as they
drink up the Nile water and fruits
generally ripen: "Abeeb, the cook of
grapes and raisins."
Misra (7 August - 5 September):
attributed to Misra the Sun, or the
child of the sun. The temperature
drops as a prelude to winter. It is the
season of floods and water. Summer
fruits become ripe, dates, figs and
grapes become abundant: "Misra is
the month in which each difficult canal
runs."
