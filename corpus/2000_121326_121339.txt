Striking where it hurts
Civic groups in Korea led an unprecedented campaign to blacklist corrupt politicians in recent elections,
but the old guard is blocking the will to reform
here is an old saying in South Korea that
if a man rose to high political offic e, h i s
family would be financially set for three
g e n e r a t i o n s.But in their young democracy,
Koreans are discovering that they have the
power to topple corrupt politicians and
band together to battle political vice.
The National Assembly elections last
April will go down as a landmark for civic
e m p o w e r m e n t . On January 10, t h e
Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Ju s t i c e
( C C E J ) , a non-governmental
o r g a n i z a t i o n , released a list of 167 “ u n fit ”
c a n d i d a t e s. Past involvement in
corruption scandals, violations of the
nation’s Election Law, and resistance to
democratic and anti-corruption reforms
were among the criteria for being
blacklisted.
In the following days, a temporary
alliance of 470 civic groups formed the
C i t i z e n ’s Alliance for the 2000 General
Elections (CAGE) in an effort to build
both unity and power in numbers.CAG E
came up with an additional 47 names,
threatening that if the nation’s parties
d i d n ’t nominate different candidates,t h e y
would launch full-scale rejection campaigns
against the allegedly unethical politicians.
To no one’s surprise, parties accused
CAGE of “political terrorism” and drew
attention to electoral laws preventing non-
political groups other than labour unions
from engaging in political campaigning.
But with the public steering the agenda—
opinion polls showed that 80 percent
would not vote for blacklisted
candidates—President Kim Dae-jung and
the Assembly amended the Election Law,
permitting CAG E ’s existence.Groups also
successfully lobbied the government for
the mandatory release of candidates’ past
c r i m i n a l , tax and military service records.
The new legislation was a deadly blow
for corrupt politicians. Fearing rejection
c a m p a i g n s, parties screened candidates
more carefully and nominated many
younger hopefuls.S i m u l t a n e o u s l y, m a n y
party heads nominated blacklisted
politicians in spite of CAG E ’s pledge.
The coalition responded with a “ r e j e c t i o n -
list”of 86 candidates and highlighted 22
main targets, most of whom were long-
time political heavyweights.
In with the young and
out with the string-pullers
CAGE held street rallies, p e t i t i o n
drives, phone and e-mail campaigns and
set up websites aimed at the youth vote in
particular. The sites, which featured the
endorsements of popular fil m ,t e l e v i s i o n
and music stars, received almost one
million hits during the run-up to the
election.
On April 14,Koreans awoke to a new,
much younger polity.Voters had rejected
70 percent of the blacklisted candidates.
Of the 22 special targets, only seven were
e l e c t e d . First and second-term lawmakers,
many in their 30s or 40s, made up 80
percent of the new assembly.The election
was heralded as a turning point in Ko r e a n
p o l i t i c s : a new force had emerged, t h e
civil society sector,determined to rid the
country of crooked politics.
The rise of this broad coalition can be
traced to Ko r e a ’s powerful democracy
movement that peaked in 1987, w h e n
middle-class workers and labourers
joined students to demand fair and
democratic elections, forcing President
Chun Doo-hwan to accede. “ The anti-
corruption movement succeeds the
democratic movements of the past
d e c a d e s,” says Kim Geo-sung of the A n t i -
Corruption Network in Korea (ACNK).
“This wasn’t possible before because we
[civil society] didn’t have enough power
for these kinds of activities.”
But mobilizing a citizenry accustomed
to reading about influence-peddling and
payoffs in headlines would not have gained

Demanding the right to engage in political campaigning.

Striking where it hurts
such momentum without the shock of the
1997 financial crisis,which brought on the
most economically painful recession since
1 9 5 3 . Policies that nurtured collusion
between the government, the ch a e b o l s
(industrial conglomerates) and banks were
widely believed to have precipitated the
c r i s i s.“ The crisis was the responsibility of
the politicians who were pulling the strings
of the economic system,”says Kim Yo u n g -
r a e,a political scientist at Ajou University
in Suwon. In July 2000, a report by the
Korea Economic Research Institute stated
that corruption had eroded national
economic growth by 1.5 percent.
“ We took the opportunity of elections
this year to end the irrational cycle of re-
electing people who had been connected
with corrupt dealings,” says Woo Pil-ho a
co-ordinator of the People’s Solidarity
for Participatory Democracy (PSPD).
Following the election,problems within
the civic sector itself threatened to derail
the nascent movement.Several prominent
civic leaders were involved in scandals,
including accusations of accepting money
from influence-buying corporations. O n e
CAGE official was arrested for accepting
a large bribe from an election candidate.
M e a n w h i l e, in the National A s s e m b l y,
junior lawmakers keen to push further anti-
corruption reform vowed to cross party
l i n e s,an act once unfathomable in Ko r e a n
p o l i t i c s. They met fierce opposition,
h o w e v e r, from the old guard who
demanded party unity. And although
President Kim has pledged his support for
the election reform bill, the splintered
A s s e m b l y, in which no party holds an
outright majority,has been deadlocked for
most of the year. In November, a f t e r
another bribery scandal erupted, t h e
president reaffirmed his government’s
determination “to mobilize prosecutors,
police and financial watchdogs to eradicate
corruption with a resolve that this be the
last battle.”
Organizations like ACNK know that
their mission involves wholesale societal
c h a n g e. “ We need to change the system
and public consciousness,” says AC N K ’s
K i m , drawing attention to the emphasis
put on the group over individual initiative.
“ We have a kind of system for preserving
c o r r u p t i o n . Anyone could be a whistle-
b l o w e r,but if he is,h e ’ll become an outcast.”
But CAG E ’s success encouraged the
n a t i o n ’s top civic groups to form the
Korean Civic Social Solidarity Alliance.
This permanent coalition is seeking
legislation requiring politicians to account
for all funds and guarantee democratic
party structures,particularly with respect
to nominations, as well as greater public
participation in monitoring and
evaluating elected officials.
As one of A s i a ’s most developed
countries and a young democracy, Ko r e a
is being watched closely by the rest of
the continent. “Serving as a model can
be one of the best practices of Ko r e a n
N G O s,” says Kim. “ We believe other
countries can adopt such activities, b u t
the situation depends on the power of
their civil society.” ■
“ We took the
o p p o r t u n i t y
of elections
this year to end the
irrational cycle
of re-electing people
who had been
connected with corrupt
dealings.”
