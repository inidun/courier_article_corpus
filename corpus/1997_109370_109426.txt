Available food resources are
increasing at a slower pace
than world population, especially
in developing countries. To reverse
this critical trend, farmers in these
regions require simple and effec¬
tive farming methods.
The United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme (UNDP) and the
United Nations University (UNU)
have devised an integrated farming
model adapted to tropical regions.
Participants at the Indo-Paciiic
Workshop held from 5 to 9 May
1997 in Suva, the Fijian capital, as
part of the UNU's Zero Emission
Research Initiative (ZERI), had an
opportunity to see an experimen¬
tal farm in action at the Montfort
Roys' Town Training Centre.
Food strategies in industrialized
countries are based on raising live¬
stock, the largest consumer of
cereal grains and soya bean meal.
According to Lylian Rodriguez, a
Colombian agronomist specializing
in tropical agriculture, 50% of the
world grain supply goes to feeding
livestock. If this produce were
reserved for human consumption,
studies estimate there would he
enough to feed 10 billion people, a
figure around which world popula¬
tion is expected to stabilize.
Rodriguez advocates an inte¬
grated farming system based on
recycling. Farmers from developing
countries would grow plants for
feeding livestock and recycle the
wastes produced. This circuit has
many economic and ecological ben¬
efits: livestock produces meat, milk
and eggs; animal excrements supply
biogas for cooking, heating and
light; manure and other residues
produce a compost that is used as an
organic fertilizer. Earthworms trans¬
form waste materials into humus
and can be used as animal feed.
EXPLOITING BIOGAS
In the rural areas of developing
countries, biogas is one of the
cheapest sources of renewable
energy. It forms naturally in humid
environments with no air or oxygen
and can be obtained artificially by
fermenting animal or plant waste in
a basin known as a hiodigester,
linked by a tube to a large polyeth¬
ylene bag. Rich in methane and car¬
bon dioxyde, this unpurified gas
supplies between 5,000 and 60,000
kilocalorics per cubic metre.
Biogas has many uses. It pro¬
vides cooking fuel, which cuts fire¬
wood consumption, and converts
manure into an improved fertilizer.
It reduces manure smells, elimi¬
nates cooking smoke and controls
pathogens, thereby improving the
farm environment.
Biodigesters do more than pro¬
duce gas. Their effluent can he
used to fertilize both soil-based
crops and floating aquatic plants
like cassava and duckweed, two
important protein sources for feed¬
ing pigs, ducks and chickens in
tropical regions.
For many years, Rodriguez has
worked with farmers in Viet Nam
to spread this model. The cassava
serves as a fence which protects
the hiodigester and ponds occu¬
pying a 61m2 area. Every 45 days,
the cassava leaves are harvested,
producing a yield of 35 kilos per
year, in addition to the 43 kilos of
protein produced annually by the
duckweed ponds. These are sig-

nificant quantities. This type of General view of the

microj>roject can improve the daily
lot of the most deprived rural fam¬
ilies, all too often left untouched
by development strategics.
PRIZED EARTHWORMS
Earthworms also play a key role in
the system. During the workshop
in Suva, Rodriguez passed around
a plate containing earthworms and
talked about them with affection:
"When under stress, earthworms
become agitated. These ones are
obviously happy." She mainly
works with Californian Red worms
(Eisenia foetida), the richest in
protein. Sexually mature at three
months, these hermaphrodites
mate every seven days. An earth¬
worm can have up to 1,500 off¬
spring every year. A veritable pro¬
cessing factory, these earthworms
feed on all sorts of waste. They eat
the equivalent of their weight each CarP and tilaPia

transformed into humus. Although
hybrid broiler chickens take ten
to twenty days to become accus¬
tomed to the red worms, the local
chickens and fish seem to savour
them.
FARM OFTHE FUTURE
The ideal is to group these various
practices into an integrated farming
system. The experimental farm in
Montfort is one promising example.
It belongs to a vocational training
centre set up some thirty years ago
following a contract between the
Government of Fiji and the Saint
Gabriel de Montfort religious order.
Every year, the Centre takes on
about 100 boys between fifteen and

seventeen, all from very poor back¬
grounds. Over a three-year period,
they learn manual skills and grad¬
uate to a job.
George Chan, a Mauritian of Chi¬
nese origin, directed the installation
of a vast integrated farming system
at the Centre. A hiodigester recy¬
cles sheep and chicken wastes. The
enriched water, purified of patho¬
genic elements dangerous to human
health, runs into 3,000 m2 of ponds
filled with several types of carp and
tilapia. Since the fish do not breed
on the spot, young specimens have to
be brought in from the outside. Rut
they grow quickly, providing a food
supply for the school kitchen and
local markets.
It cost about $30,000 to build
the farm, an investment Chan says
will be paid off in three or four years
by profits from livestock and poly-
culture. Annual production offish (6
tons) brings in $10,000, with an
additional $3,000 to $4,000 from
butcher animals. Vegetables and
flowers will be cultivated on the
pond banks, and strawberries and
orchids on rafts.
MUSHROOM GROWING
Shuting Chang, a specialist in mush¬
room genetics (see UNESCO Courier,
June 1994, "Biotechnology: the
resourceful gene"), advocates cul¬
tivating edible mushrooms on the
composted plant waste.
Temperatures in the tropics are
too high for growing certain species
known in Europe, like the Agari-
46 r

cus mushroom (Agaricus bisporus).
Chang selects species adapted to
hot climates that only require sim¬
ple substrates (wood or sawdust,
rice or sugar cane straw, waste from
cotton or water hyacinths), pro¬
vided they have been correctly pre¬
pared and composted. In the case
of pleurotus (Vleurotus ostreatus),
the straw and sawdust mix has to be
prepared by autoclaving to elimi¬
nate toxic substances harmful to
the spawn's growth. When this pre¬
caution is taken, four to five har¬
vests are obtained every year. Black
mushrooms, widely used in Chinese
cooking (Auricula judae), grow
directly on the wood. Another
prized species, shiitake or per¬
fumed mushroom (Lentinus edo-
des), is rich in protein. One square
metre yields five kilos of perfumed
mushrooms, which only take one
month to reach maturity.
The nerve centre of
the integrated
farm is the
hiodigester
(below), where
plant waste and
animal excrement
ferment to produce
biogas and
residues for use as
fertilizer.
Mushrooms are a valuable
resource. These chlorophyll-free
plants can convert agricultural
waste materials into human food.
Furthermore, they have interesting
nutritional and medicinal proper¬
ties, not to mention their gastro¬
nomic attractions. For over 2,000
years, Chinese, Korean and Japan¬
ese traditional medicine has used
mushrooms for reinforcing the
immune system, enhancing mem¬
ory, delaying the aging process and
fighting tumours, according to
Shuting Chang.
Developing an integrated farm¬
ing system like the one in Montfort
requires an overall understanding
of low-cost production techniques
that protect the environment.
Horst Doelle, director of the
UNESCO Microbial Resource Cen¬
tre (MIRCEN) in Brisbane, Aus¬
tralia, drew workshop partici¬
pants' attention to advances in
microbiology. He pointed out that
at Montfort microbial techniques
are put into practice through use
of the hiodigester for example.
MIRCENs grant scholarships and
teach technicians from developing
countries about the importance of
microbiology for sustainable, eco¬
logical rural development. Not only
does the Montfort farm keep its
boarders well fed, it also provides
them with a valuable farming
model for the future. M
