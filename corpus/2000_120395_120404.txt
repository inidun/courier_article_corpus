“ Eat your food. Children in Ethiopia are star-
v i n g .” It is a familiar refrain at the A m e ri c a n
dinner table to which scores of children have
r e p l i e d : “Send them my broccoli!” But to Andrea del
M o r a l ,n ow 22, the question sparked confusion.W hy
were children starving? “I still don’t understand it,” s h e
a d m i t s ,“ i t ’s not about not enough food in the wo r l d .”
T h at she continues to pursue the question sets her
a p a rt from her peers. A nat i ve of we a l t hy Seat t l e ,
Wa s h i n g t o n , she has turned her back on lucrat i ve job
o p p o rtunities to consider the co-existence of prosperi t y
and starvat i o n .
But the solution remains elusive . Looking back on
a year of hard-core activism that has included the Wo r l d
Trade Organization (WTO) protests in Seattle and
Wa s h i n g t o n , D. C . , teach-ins and cross-country road-
t ri p s , del Moral says fru s t r ation and hard lessons from
the world of global politics have forced her to re-eva l u at e
h ow she can help bring down the corp o r ate forces that
she believes are undermining food securi t y.
With close-cropped curls and baggy carp e n t e r ’s
p a n t s , she describes her look as “a little bit punk,” bu t
she is no arrogant rebel. Del Moral is thoughtful, a rt i-
c u l at e , with an easy, sometimes self-deprecating laugh.
T h at a young woman who has never known hunger
should make it her vo c ation comes as a surp rise even to
her own parents. But del Moral credits them for plan-
ting the seeds. Her father is a botany professor and her
mother works for the U. S .g ove rn m e n t ’s Env i r o n m e n t a l
Protection A g e n cy. “I grew up with that ethic [of env i-
r o n m e n t a l i s t s ] ,” she say s , adding that “ my family alway s
encouraged me to make my own decisions.”
But to the dismay of her parents, del Moral aban-
doned her studies at a Montreal unive rsity to purs u e
activism full-time.S u rviving on money earned tutori n g
and taking on odd acting roles, she began her subve r-
s i ve education with a band of like-minded twe n t y -
somethings in Montreal.While mounting street play s
i l l u s t r ating the nightmarish creations of genetic engi-
n e e ring gone wrong,the troupe began plastering mock-
labels on genetically modified foods and holding
d e m o n s t r ations outside the city’s superm a r k e t s.
Like thousands of other activists around the wo r l d ,
it was on the World Wide Web that del Moral first heard
the buzz about the WTO’s November 1999 meeting in
S e at t l e .“At first I didn’t know what the WTO wa s ,” s h e
a d m i t s. By tapping into dozens of “ l i s t - s e rve s ” a n d
email discussion gr o u p s , del Moral soon began flu e n t l y
using terms like “ c o rp o r ate seed supply”and “ b i o p i r a cy.”
Practice before preaching
She also deepened her knowledge of the Bretton-
Woods institutions and their sister, the WTO. She now
realizes that “these institutions were not formed by
people saying ‘ l e t ’s control the wo r l d ’ .They were creat e d
with good intentions that went wrong.” For del Moral,
“The big organizations are power structures that are in
complete contradiction with direct democracy, which has
the most potential for freedom.”While she unders t a n d s
the need for intern ational bodies to regulate and har-
monize the laws of different countri e s , del Moral fears
t h at these organizations are more concerned with pro-
fits than with people, and advo c ates dismantling them.
In the months prior to the Seattle protest, del Moral
t r avelled across the country,attending demonstrat i o n s ,
workshops on civil disobedience and classes in Social Eco-

After dodging police in the stre e t s, a young activist in the U. S. t a kes the battle
against corporate forces onto firmer gro u n d

l o g y, the philosophy of living by nat u r e ’s example in
which organic fa rming is central.She soon discovered her
knack for addressing crow d s. But after speaking to more
and more people, she began to realize the limitations of
her theori e s.She recalls meeting with a fa rmer in we s t e rn
C a n a d a , who agreed that big corp o r ations like Nabisco
were manipulating the price of his harvest for their pro-
fit s , but didn’t see how organic fa rming would solve his
financial problems.“ For him it was about profits not pro-
d u c t i o n .We thought about how we could help, but we are
just city kids,”s ays del Moral,“I have no place telling these
kinds of people I have the solutions.”
Disappointed by that encounter,del Moral decided
to learn to practice what she was preaching in the
context of the global economy.She figured the best place
to get the big picture was in Seat t l e .
Del Moral arri ved in her hometown on the eve of
T h a n k s giving—ironically the A m e rican harvest holiday
a s s o c i ated with ove r - e at i n g . No one anticipated the
extent of the violence that erupted in Seattle from
N ovember 30 to December 3.Television images beamed
around the world showed a deva s t ated city in a state of
e m e r g e n cy ; riot police in bulletproof armour beat i n g
back protestors ,a rmed National Guardsmen roaming
the streets and gr a f fiti-ed storefronts.
As WTO d e l e g ates arri ve d ,s e c u rity was bolstered.
Stepping into the streets she had roamed as a child,d e l
Moral felt the ground shift.Her first encounter with ri o t
police in a parking garage marked a moment of
t ru t h : she and her fri e n d s , a rmed only with big
i d e a s , were about to engage in a battle with fa r
m o r e p owerful forces. “At that moment” s ays del
M o r a l , “I realized a sort of war was being waged upon
us and this (the police) was its visible manifestat i o n …
I wish I could carry that realization around with me
e ve ry day.”
While she steered clear of the front lines to avo i d
a rr e s t , sleepless nights and days spent dodging the
police left her bat t l e - we a ry. Once again, del Moral
wondered if she was making the best use of her energy.
“ We will never take down industrial agri c u l t u r e ,” s h e
recalls asking hers e l f,“so why are we doing this?”
Committed to change but still searching for her
place in the anti-globalization move m e n t , del Moral
has retreated from the front lines, d e voting herself to
organic fa rm i n g . On a six-acre fa rm in the quiet hills of
Ve rm o n t , she earns $50 a week tilling the land, and expe-
rimenting with seed saving and ancient fa rming tech-
niques which she believes still hold the key to solving
world hunger. ■
