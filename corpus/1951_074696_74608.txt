THE FEATURE CARRIES
ON THE DOCUMENTARY
TRADITION
by Sir Michael BALCON
One of the leading film producers in Great Britain, Sir Michael Balcon has
given the world cinema public an amazing number of film successes, including
Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Dead of Nfght,
The Overfonders, Nicholas Nickleby, The Captive Heart, Next of Kin, They Came
to a City.

IN the British cinema, there is one
t outstanding success story : not the
story of an individual, but of an
approach, a. point of view. With the
reservations that any generalization re-
quires, it can be said to have started
with the documentary movement in the
late 20's and early 30's. Documentary is
a term notoriously
difficult to define, and
although we all know
what it means, no sa-
tisfactory definition
has yet been found.
Nor will I attempt to
give one : for my pres-
ent purpose, it is suf-
ficient to point out
what it aimed to
achieve, which, since
documentarists seem
also to have been pro-
lific theorists, I can do
easily in their own
words. Documentary,
said Paul Rotha,"has
an important purpose
to fulfil in bringing to
life familiar things
and people, so that
their place in the
scheme of t h i n g s
which we call society
may be honestly as-
sessed". And John
Grierson declared that
"it promised us the
power of making
drama from our daily
events and poetry of
our problems".
I need hardly say
that the documentary
film makers succeeded
magnificently. Not
only did they say
things that, as every-
one with the least
spark of social cons-
ciousness realized,
needed saying badly,
but they developed
new film techniques
and trained new per-
sonnel, in spite of fre-
quent lack of support
and difficulties. In
the period between
the wars, when the
British feature-film
industry had too often
to concentrate on mere
survival, it was the
quality of the docu-
mentaries that kept
the reputation of the
industry as a whole
alive abroad. That is
the greatest compli-
ment that I, as a fea-
ture-film producer, can
pay them. The value
of the work they did
was out of all propor-
tion to its footage :
they made propaganda
without resorting to
politics, and they
made works of art
without losing sight of
their social purpose.
Then came the war.
and the industry's
forces combined re-
gardless of whether
they came from docu-
mentary or feature, to
wield what was soon
realized to be a major
weapon of war : the
result was naturally
called feature-documentary, and equally
naturally, its quality profited by this new
liaison : the British war-time output as a
whole was far in advance of what had
gone before. This is not altogether sur-
prising, since a national emergency always
seems to act as a tremendous stimulus.
What is rather surprising is that the gen-
eral feeling after such an emergency-to
return to the conditions that existed
before as quickly as possible-did not
arise in the British film industry. The
feature film had learned a great lesson :
its responsibility as an influence on the
public, its possibilities as an informative
and didactic force. The aims were now
similar to those propounded by the do-
cumentaries of the 30's.
If I say therefore that the feature-film
has largely taken over from the docu-
mentary, I do not in any way mean to
belittle the latter. On the contrary, this
state of affairs means that their propa-
ganda has achieved its purpose : the be-
liefs of the few of the 30's are now wide-
ly held, their aims have become generally
accepted as being worthwhile, their ap-
proach to the screen has been vindicated.
Of course, at the moment, this is only
the beginning of a new trend in the Bri-
tish industry, and is not yet completely
established. But I am convinced that it
is soreadins. and that we are on the right
lines :. already a num-
ber of the better
known documentarists
are working in feature
films : under John
Grierson, the Exe-
cutive Producer of one
of the news groups
organized by the Na-
tional Film Finance
Corporation, are John
Eldridge and Terry
Bishop, on loan from
Ealing Studios, Pat
Jackson and Paul Ro-
tha have both just
directed their first
feature 61m, and I
think it significant
that in the programme
on Future trends in
a documentary series
organized by the Bri-
tish Film Institute,
Seven Days to Noon
should be shown in
extract.
Let us'examine,
then, a little more
closely, how the fea-
ture film today is car-
rying on the documen-
tary tradition. More
and more it is using
for its backgrounds
parts of the contem-
porary scene such as
made the subject mat-
ter of the past docu-
mentary : farm, slum,
factory. More and
more it makes use of
characters and action
arising out of contem-
porary problems, such
as were handled by
the documentarists :
labour problems, class
problems, problems of
psychology. More and
more it is prepared to
break away from the
studio and its hot-
house plots, to use real
places and real people.
Of course, there are
disadvantages : the
problem that makes a
background in a fea-
ture film can often not
be examined as care-
fully as might be de-
sirable, as profound-
ly as could be done in
a documentary con-
centrating only on the
one subject. But on
the other hand, the
potential influence of
the feature film is
much greater : not on-
ly does it reach a wi-
der audience, but since
feature-films by their
nature must treat all
problems in terms of
individual human be-
ings, they avoid the
slightly impersonal
application to"the
people"that often
mars documentaries,
and. therefore, bring
home to the individual human geings that
make up the audience the problems in a
much more personal and impressive way.
That I think, is the road we should
continue to travel, but it still requires a
new approach from many people. Above
all, it means that all concerned with the
creation of script and film must become
careful students of the contemporary
world ; they must know and feel their
people and their country, the difficulties
and joys that are the stuff of ordinary
life, so that they can recreate it on the
screen. If the film industries of all
countries did this honestly and consis-
tently, each bringing their own people
to the screens of the world, then indeed
we should have made documentary un-
necessary, we should be making drama
from our daily events and poetry of our
problems ! In the meantime, the film
we are at present producing at Ealing
deals with the clash between old and new
in colonial administration, and the next
will be about the probation system.
