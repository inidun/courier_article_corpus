The media explosion left traditional Indian puppetry without a leg 
to stand on, but now a revival may be on the way

Chalapathi Rao learnt how to handle
puppets even before he learnt his
alphabet. In the last five decades, he
and his troupe have staged innumerable
puppet shows in India and other parts of
the world including twenty-three perfor-
mances in Germany and two in New York.
To d ay, the fif t y - e i g h t - year-old artist from
the southern Indian state of Andhra Pra-
desh makes ends meet not by his art i s t ry
but by selling lampshades and small han-
d i c r a f t s. “ We used to gi ve as many as fif-
teen performances a month during my
fat h e r ’s time,” he recalls.“ N ow we only per-
form for four months a year and go no fur-
ther than our neighbouring villages. For the
rest of the time we survive by selling han-
d i c r a f t s.” Rao is one of the thousands of
once popular traditional puppeteers in the
Indian sub-continent who have been swe p t
away by the mass media explosion.
A popular art form with a long tradi-
tion in India,puppetry seems to have been
first mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic
S i l a p p a d i k a ra m (second century BC). It has
been and still is an effective tool for com-
m u n i c ating religi o u s , political and social
messages. Puppeteers, who always moved
around from place to place, mostly used
ancient Indian epics like the R a m aya n a a n d
the M a h a b h a ratha as their themes, a n d
their shows were a regular feature of reli-
gious and local festivals, wedding celebra-
tions and social gatherings. Style and pre-
s e n t ation differed from region to regi o n .
Puppetry enjoyed royal patronage, and as
its popularity spread across oceans many
Southeast Asian nations adapted the art
form to their own cultures and traditions
(see box page 42).
Known as Thollu bommalata (Dance of
leather puppets) or Bommalattam (Dance
of dolls) in south India and K atputhli ( s t ri n g
puppet) in nort h e rn India,puppets enthral-
led audiences the moment they came alive
to the accompaniment of song and music.
N ow, as in the past, the puppeteer narr at e s
a story, manipulates the figures,gives each
character an appropri ate vo i c e , and care-
fully choreographs sound effects and move-
m e n t .A successful puppeteer needs to have
a thorough grasp of poetry, history, philo-
sophy, religion and music. Puppeteers also
sing to the accompaniment of musical ins-
t ru m e n t s , speak several languages, a n d
bless the event and the surrounding area
by quoting from religious scriptures. Once
upon a time,p e r f o rmances began after sun-
set and lasted for hours , sometimes all night
long.
The strength of puppetry is in its inter-
a c t i ve quality. It is a live medium with a
personalized approach. Puppeteers some-
times invent their own stories,improvising
from the basic plot a complex network of
i n t ri g u e s , r o m a n c e s , wa rs , m a gic and
comedy.The use of local dialects and sto-
ries makes for an immediate and direct rap-
p o rt with the audience, with whom puppe-
teers often converse through their charac-
ters.
Payment in kind
To d ay puppetry occupies a far less signi-
ficant place on the Indian cultural scene than
it did in its glorious past. No institutions or
u n i ve rsity courses are dedicated to puppetry,
and puppeteers learn their art either through
family tradition or simply because they
become interested in it. I n d u s t ri a l i z at i o n ,
u r b a n i z ation and the advent of modern mass
m e d i a , especially films and television, h ave
inevitably put a damper on traditional and
folk forms of art worldwide and Indian pup-
p e t ry has been no exception. Fe ature fil m s
and modern dance performances have repla-
ced puppet shows in the village festiva l s.T h e
phenomenal gr owth of satellite television in
the last two decades has kept children and
adults alike glued to the screen. ( O f f i c i a l
r e p o rts in 1995 estimated that there we r e
about forty million television sets in India,
and that the figure was gr owing at the rate of
10 per cent annually).
According to Dadi Pudumjee, p r e s i d e n t
of the Indian branch of the Union Intern a-
tionale de la Marionette (UNIMA),an inter-
n ational non-gove rnmental organizat i o n ,
p u p p e t e e rs in the past were rewarded by vil-
l a g e rs in cash or kind (e.g. ri c e , ve g e t a b l e s
and clothes), in addition to their fee.“ T h o s e
customs have disappeared now and puppe-
t e e rs could not surv i ve on their earnings alone
( b e t ween $5 and $20 for a perform a n c e ) .T h e
a rri val of the modern media also brought a
need to improve the production quality and
content of these puppet show s. Unable to
change with the times,m a ny traditional pup-
p e t e e rs vanished from the scene.”

rare survivors. He has adapted modern
themes and techniques to this ancient art

gious subjects.” Unlike Rao, those who did
not change their repertoire and move with
the times were forced to abandon their vo c a-
tion and take to other means of live l i h o o d
like fa rm i n g, t oy making and handicrafts.
A survey of traditional forms of puppet
t h e atre conducted by the Bharat h i ya Nat ya
Sangh (Indian Dance A s s o c i ation) in 1977

mics joined artists in promoting puppet
t h e atre as a means of self-expression and as
a vehicle of instru c t i o n .E x p e rts from va ri o u s
disciplines joined in an effort to make pup-
pet shows a multi-dimensional experi e n c e .
O ver the past few ye a rs the New Delhi-
based Sangeet Natak A c a d e my (SNA;M u s i c
and Dance A s s o c i ation) of India, has orga-
nized festivals and conferences in various
p a rts of the country as part of an endeavo u r
to improve the techniques and forms of tra-
ditional puppetry.At these eve n t s , the inter-
action and exchange of ideas between tradi-
tional and non-traditional puppeteers for the
d e velopment of the art resulted in assimila-
tion of styles and emergence of new trends.
A rtists came up with fresh ideas. S h a d ow
puppetry incorporated masks, mime and
classical dance form s. Some puppet art i s t s
introduced martial arts and new lighting
techniques into shadow puppet shows.
O t h e rs went ahead with the idea of musical
puppet shows without any dialogue.“I prefer
to stage total theatre by using actors ,m a s k s ,
m ovement and objects as a means to tell a
s t o ry,” s ays Dadi Pudumjee, who also ru n s
Ishara T h e atre in New Delhi. L aying special
emphasis on move m e n t ,Dadi has deve l o p e d
colourful and vibrant puppets which com-
bine the grace of traditional marionettes with
the vitality of contemporary puppets.
Enthusiastic puppeteers are now car-
rying out interesting experiments with
f o rm , c o l o u r , design and content. All the

basic styles and techniques are visible in
the work of these contemporary artists who
h ave dared to break age-old barri e rs of reli-
gion and language. Eminent Indian art cri-
tic J.N. Kaushal says that “those who kept
their windows open to new ideas and expe-
riments have made great strides and those
who were unwilling to change have shown
signs of decay.”
Pulling strings 
to improve health
Some non-traditional puppeteers have used
p u p p e t ry as an effective communicat i ve tool
as well as an art form . For example the Uni-
ted Nations Development Progr a m m e ’s
South Asia Pove rty A l l e v i ation Project spon-
sored puppetry training programmes for
community wo r k e rs in Andhra Pradesh in
1 9 9 7 . As part of the project two one-we e k
training programmes in the use of puppetry
were conducted at the Nori A rt and Puppe-
t ry Centre in Hyderabad, the state capital.
The programme helped around fifty com-
munity wo r k e rs from southern India to learn
the art and use it to popularize social mes-
sages like wo m e n ’s empowe rm e n t ,health and
family planning. After their training, t h e s e
community wo r k e rs went back to their vil-
lages and made hand and rod puppets to per-
f o rm new stories and songs adapted to them.
P u p p e t ry is being used as part of similar pro-
jects sponsored by a number of agencies in
other parts of India in order to create awa r e-
ness of issues like Aids and alcohol abu s e .
Though puppetry shows are not
making a sensational come-back, they are
again being enthusiastically welcomed both
in rural and urban areas. There have been
suggestions that puppetry should be intro-
duced as a subject in schools in India, but
this has yet to mat e ri a l i z e . Once considered
a “dying art”,Indian puppetry has started
a slow revival but still has far to go before
regaining its former glory. ■
