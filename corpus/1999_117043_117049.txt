2. The making of Dolly

1 Our bodies are made up of cells, each contai-
ning a nucleus of DNA (Deox y ri b o n u c l e i c
a c i d ) .This huge molecule resembles a sort of spi-
ral ladder,a double helix whose parts twist and ove r-
l a p. It is divided between 23 pairs of complemen-
t a ry chromosomes—one inherited from the fat h e r
and one from the mother in each pair.
This DNA “ s p i r a l ” contains about three billion
“bar codes”, which consist of four different bases—
adenine (A in red), t hymine (T in blue),cytosine (C
in green) and guanine (G in ye l l ow)—which are
a lways linked with each other in the same way as base
p a i rs (A with T and C with G).
About 95 per cent of the DNA in the nucleus has
no known function, while the remaining 5 per cent
contains some 100,000 genes. Pieces of DNA, w h i c h
are so minute that they cannot be seen by a micro-
s c o p e , are composed of several thousands of “ b a r
c o d e s ” .The way the four base-pairs are strung toge-
ther is a sort of coded message: by interpreting this
c o d e , and switching particular genes on and off, t h e
cells manufacture the proteins which make us what
we are.
2 There are several methods of cloning. B u t
until the birth of the cloned sheep, D o l l y, i n
July 1996, it was necessary to use test-tube embryo s
d e ri ved from an encounter between an egg and a
s p e rm at o z o i d .The embryos were divided in two
and each half implanted inside a surrogate mother
to obtain two clones.The creation of Dolly was revo-
l u t i o n a ry because it did not require using a “ n o r-
m a l ” e m b ryo (one made by an egg and a sperm ) .
The famous sheep of the 1990s was born from the
“ m a rri a g e ” of an egg cell from which the nucleus
had been removed and an adult cell taken from the
sheep to be cloned.
3 More than 4,000 genetic diseases are res-
ponsible for a third of all infant deaths in the
d e veloped countri e s.When “ d e f e c t i ve ” genes are
s p o t t e d , an attempt to “ r e p a i r ” them can be made
using genetic engi n e e ri n g . Still in its infa n cy, t h i s
technique invo l ves injecting “ h e a l t hy ” genes into
diseased cells. But because of the minute size of cells
and genes, it is impossible to do this “by hand” l i k e
in a normal surgical operat i o n . So scientists use ve c-
tors—deactivated viruses or retroviruses (a special
kind of viru s ) .These carri e rs of “ g o o d ” genes can
p e n e t r ate the targeted cells of the patient by them-
s e l ve s. But howe ver promising these techniques may
be for the future, none is effective in treating disease
at present.

Implant the therapeutic gene in a vector
(retrovirus, virus or liposome)
Introduce the vector into the “defective”cell
a.If the vector is a retrovirus
The DNA of the defective cell
recombines with the DNA of the virus
carrying the therapeutic gene
b. If the vector is a virus or a
liposome
The therapeutic gene neutralizes the
sick gene from a distance
