BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
Restorers have decided to
leave some Angkor ruins in
the powerful hands of giant
trees. Here, the roots of a
kapok tree grip stonework of
the temple of Ta Prohm.

high, sculpted towers ofAngkor Wat
are all tinged pink. We are privileged
to be flying over the best-known
temple of the unique complex of
monuments that is Angkor in old
Khmer, the name means "the city"
or "the capital". Here, on a plain 200
square kilometres in extent in
north-eastern Cambodia, between
the Kulen plateau and the Tonle Sap
("Great Lake"), a dozen Khmer
rulers of the ninth to the twelfth
centuries built seven capitals con¬
taining many temples. Some are
hidden in the jimgle, where they are
even more inaccessible because of
the presence of the Khmer Rouge,

who after holding power from 1975
to 1978 and killing upwards ofa mil¬
lion Ciambodians, took refuge in this
region near the Thai border. The
temples are all that now remains of
the ancient capitals, for only the
gods had the right to stone or brick
buildings. The palaces and dwellings
were built of wood, and they have
since disappeared without trace.
RECONCILINC TOWRISN AND
CONSERVAnON
Nature, not human wrath, has
destroyed these marvellously rich
monuments. The heat and humidity
of the tropical climate encouraged
the unbridled growrth of kapok and
"strangler fig" trees, popularly asso¬
ciated with ruins because their roots
destroy monuments.
Today the principal temples have
been freed ofthe vegetation that held
them in its grip. Only the Ta Prohm
temple has deliberately been left in
the midst of the thickets in which
the French missionary Charles
Bouillevaux and, later, the naturalist
Henri Mouhot foimd it in the mid-
nineteenth centiu^'. Since 1898, the
year in which the French Far Eastem
School (the Ecole Française
d'Extrême-Orient, or EFEO) was
founded, a steady stream ofarchae¬
ologists have worked on the site.
They patiently cleared away the
undergrowth, dismantled and then
reassembled the monuments, and
in 1908 created the "Conservation
d'Angkor" to which the most threat¬
ened statues were taken.
According to Bernard Philippe
Groslier of the EFEO, a former
curator ofthe site, "There is hardly
anything in the world comparable
to the Angkor complex in terms of
the number, size and perfection of
its buildings." But this masterpiece
is in grave danger, and in 1989 the
four main Cambodian political par¬
ties asked Unesco to assume the co¬
ordination of international activi¬
ties for the preservation of the
monimients ofAngkor. In December
1992 


Angkor was placed on the
World Heritage List.
In view of the scale of the conser¬
vation problems involved, Unesco's
World Heritage Committee placed
a number ofconditions onAngkor's
inclusion on the List, insisting that a
legal framework for conservation
work and a management plan
should be drawn up, and that an
authority should be established with
the resources to manage the entire
Angkor area. Unesco's first task was
to help the government to set up a
Cambodian Authority for the Pro¬
tection of the National Heritage,
which was formally approved in Feb-
mary 1993. Unesco has also worked
with the Cambodian government
and a group of international experts
on a Zoning and Environmental
Management Plan (ZEMP) for the
authorities, donors and local people
as well as visitors. This comprehen¬
sive document takes into account
Angkor's assets as well as the dangers
threatening the site.
The archaeological treasures are
particularly at risk from lichens,
microscopic algae and bacteria that
proliferate in the guano ofthe many
bats living in the ruins. The ZEMP
also cites the destructive effects of
monsoon rains, the vegetation, and
variations in the underground
aquifer that influence the stability of
the buildings. Other factors include

uncontrolled agricultural develop¬
ment after deforestation, the influx
of thousands of tourists and the
construction of hotels to replace
existing facilities that are not up to
international standards. The region
badly needs revenue from tourism,
but there is also a risk that it may
suffer from it. Angkor is a "new"
destination that travel agencies are
now adding to a circuit that includes
Thailand, Laos and Viet Nam.
Statistics show that in 1992 35,000
tourists visited Siem Reap, the base
for excursions to the temples. If
forecasts turn out to be accurate,
between 300,000 and 700,000 for¬
eigners and between 100,000 and
500,000 Cambodians will visit
Angkor in the next five years. The
figures represent a sizeable market,
and fourteen big hotel chains are
already hoping for a share of it.
There is growing concern since two
hotels had been built previously
beside the moat ofAngkor Wat with
litüe regard for the site. (They were
subsequentiy burned down by the
Khmer Rouge). Is it only a matter
of time before there are pleasure
boats, theme parks and neon signs?
To avoid this kind of desecration
while permitting sustainable devel¬
opment of the region, the ZEMP
suggests dividing the site into zones.
The Angkor Parks, comprising five
of the ancient capitals including
Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and
Preah Khan, would be given max¬
imum protection. They would be
located within an Angkor Cultural
Reserve. On the other hand there
would be no restrictions on new
residents coming to join the 350,000
people already living in the area,
nor on their techniques of farming
or forest management.
A WAT THR0V6H THE
NINEFIELBS
Much remains to be done for the
management of water resources
before Angkor can reclaim the rep¬
utation it once had as a "hydraulic
capital". The prosperity of die early
Angkor empires was closely linked
to irrigation. A network of dykes and
canals served to control flooding
and to provide water in the dry
season from huge reservoirs called
"barays", all ofwhich are now aban¬
doned with the exception of the
Western Baray, which has been
restored in this century. The temple
moats were both sacred boundaries
and sources ofwater and of food in
the form of fish and lotus, whose
fruits contain a mealy substance
from which bread can be made.
Now, however, they have silted up
and are clogged with vegetation.
Other, more immediate dangers

also threaten the 


Angkor region.
There are estimated to be twelve mil¬
lion mines in northern Cambodia.
A French company, COPRAS, which
has trained Cambodian mine dis¬
posal squads, has been attempting to
clear the eight minefields identified
atAngkor. Three hundred and sixty
mines have already been removed.
The only way one can reach the
temple of Ta Nei and the eastern
entrance to Angkor Thom ^the so-
called Gate of Death is by following
a mine disposal squad. Countless
people adults and children have
been killed by the mines or have lost
limbs. In addition, armed and
trained Khmer Rouges are operating
in the vicinity, terrorizing the local
population by sporadic raiding.
In these circumstances, it is very
difficult to prevent the looting of
sculptures that every year causes the
sanctuaries to deteriorate further.
The thieves prize loose with chisels
the wonderM faces ofthe heavenly
dancers known as apsaras, cut the
heads offstatues, and in some cases
remove the statues wholesale, even
those weighing more than a ton. The
protests of the Cambodian govern¬
ment, of Unesco and ofthe Interna¬
tional CouncU of Museums (ICOM)
have no effect on the traffickers, who
know where they can get vast sums
ofmoney for the statues.
The task of co-ordinating inter¬
national aid that the Cambodian
government has entrusted to Unesco
is a difficult one. Only one archaeo¬
logical excavation is currenüy under
way, and that is the EFEO's investi¬
gation of the Terrace of the Leper
King. Without co-ordination and
political determination to protect
the site, Angkor could well fall into
the hands of unscrupulous busi¬
nessmen seeking quick profits from
the curiosity of tourists and the
poverty ofthe local population.
Angkor has a special place in
the memory of humanity. Let us
hope that the international com¬
munity wUl wake up to the fact soon
enough to take the urgent action
that is needed to save, protect and
rationally develop this irreplace¬
able treasure.
