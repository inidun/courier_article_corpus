aTiLL Iranians, whatever their reli¬
gious beliefs, language or origins and
wherever they live, are strongly at¬
tached to NowRouz (New Year). This
festival, which does not feature in the
Islamic lunar calendar, begins the
solar year at the spring equinox, 21
March. Lasting around two weeks, it
is the longest of all Iranian feasts and
its rites are the richest in symbolism.
The ceremonial includes customs
from pre-Islamic festivals and rites
introduced by people of non-Iranian
origin, such as the Jews, and even
borrowings from rites practised
elsewhere.
Two weeks before Now Rouz, each
household traditionally grows a plate
of sprouts of wheat, barley or lentils
as omens of a good harvest or as
tokens of fruitfulness in the future.
This significant ritual is followed by
two important celebrations which
mark the closing days of the year and
prepare for Now Rouz proper.
At nightfall on "Ember Wednes¬
day" (Tchahârshamba-souri) a bonfire
of brambles and other dry plants is
lit. Men and women, old and young
leap over the flames shouting "Fire
that burns! Fire! Fire! May your red
come to me and my yellow go to
you!" The light of the flames symbo¬
lizes the Sun. By challenging the set¬
ting Sun to shine more brightly and
to compete with the fire, they urge
it to throw off its winter torpor. Once
the fire has gone out, earthenware
pots and vases filled with water, and
a variety of other objects, are hurled
from the top of the house to shouts
of "Dard-o balâ! Dard-o bale!" ("Pain
and unhappinessl"). Wednesday be¬
ing traditionally considered as a day
of ill-omen, in this way misfortune is
averted and unhappiness symbolically
banished from the house.
On the same day, people try to
foresee the future. The omens are
read in various ways. Women who
want a child, girls who have not yet
found a husband, men who are hop¬
ing to conclude a successful business
deal or even to get married, go out
into the streets or stay behind closed

doors eavesdropping on conversa¬
tions between people they do not
know. They interpret the words they
overhear as omens of the future and
make wishes and pray to try to ward
off misfortune. Another custom is for
women and children in disguise, their
faces hidden, to go out into the
streets at twilight carrying an empty
receptacle and bang on doors with
a spoon. They say nothing but go on
knocking until someone opens a door
and gives them a present.
Purification and fireworks
The second end-of-year celebration,
the "Day of Reckoning" (rouz-e
barat) is the Iranian day of the dead.
On the last Thursday of the year alms
and gifts are distributed at the
cemetery: money, food, halva or new
clothes are given so that the poor can
celebrate the feast. The house is
cleaned from top to bottomthis is
a vestige of a pre-Islamic festival. In
this way the living seek to pay their
debts to the departed and attract the
benevolence of their ancestors.
The "spring cleaning" (Khana
Takani) done before New Year is
more than just a cleaning operation.
From cellar to attic, from carpets to
bedding, everything must be made
as good as new. A new life is dawn¬
ing and the house must be symboli¬
cally purified and thoroughly cleansed
as if it were a human body, by being
carefully washed and by wearing new
clothes.
For the New Year ceremonial, the
plate of sprouting grain and the tray
of the "seven sin" must be placed on
the NowRouz cloth in front of a mir¬
ror lit by as many candles as there are
members of the household, a copy
of the Qur'an, a bowl of milk, a bowl
of yoghurt, and gifts of coins. While

begin, the parents and other older
people pray that the year will be pro¬
pitious and recite the Qur'an to bring
blessings and happiness to the family.
Immediately afterwards, sweetmeats
are eaten. Their taste presages a
happy year.
The tray of the "seven sin" con¬
tains seven products whose names in
Persian, Turkish or Arabic begin with
the letter sin, the initial letter of the
Persian words for green (sabz) and
white (safid), colours which symbo¬
lize respectively the renewal of spring¬
time and the purity that wards off
demons. Today the tradition has
changed: everyone can choose seven
symbols representing renewal, crea¬
tion, abundance and wealth. The
number 7 is a sacred number, as it
was for the Babylonians and the an¬
cient Hebrews, linked to the idea of
creation which runs through all the
symbolism of Now Rouz.
On New Year's Eve, fireworks are
set off in the courtyard of the house
or on the terrace. They symbolize the
combat between dark, gloomy
winter and bright, joyful spring; the
victory of fire over darkness, a re-
enactment of the moment when the
world of shadows is attacked by the
world of light, the moment of
Creation.
On the morning of the big day the
children are given gold coins, cakes
and hard-boiled eggs that have been
painted, decorated and wrapped as
gifts. They have been cooked in a
brew of onion peel, walnut shells or

Return to paradise
The first thirteen days of the year are
a time of rejoicing. Children think
only of play and adults of visiting
each other. The real purpose of these
joyful days is to rediscover an origi¬
nal state of purity and equality. Re¬
lations with friends and neighbours
begin anew. People visit everyone,
the mighty and the humble. The peri¬
od of mourning for those who died
the previous year is ended. The
straightjacket of convention is
broken, though indulgence in licen¬
tiousness is not encouraged. Dis¬
tances due to social rank are
abolished. Everyone, rich and poor,
enjoys the same kind of food and
recreations and wears brightly-
coloured new clothes. Work stops in
fields and factories. All the rites per¬
formed at this time look back to a lost
paradise, the original earthly paradise
in which the divine breath infuses
humankind with a feeling of spiritual
fraternity and equality.
On the "Thirteenth day outside"
(Sizdah bedar) the mount of the de¬
mon of cold is driven from the city.
The cereals that have sprouted in the
plate are thrown into the river after
being examined by the elders in an
attempt to predict the weather dur¬
ing the coming year.
This day inaugurates a happy New
Year. Friends and neighbours usual¬
ly organize a picnic in the countryside
at which noodle soup or dishes of rice
in sauce are eaten. People go and see
the streams and rivers swollen with
melted snow. The young play tradi¬
tional games and sports, and the girls
weave together fresh herbs, singing
as they do so in a low voice: "The thir¬
teenth day, next year, at my hus¬
band's, a baby in my arms!" (Sizdah
bedar - sal-e degar khäna-ye
shouhar batcha baqual). No conflict
should be initiated on that day.
In all the rites of Now Rouz,
whatever their origin, there is one
constantly recurring feature: the con¬
flict between light and darkness, in
keeping with the old Zoroastrian du¬
alism. It is no coincidence that legend
should attribute the invention of this
feast to Jamshid or Feridun, legend¬
ary kings and divine heroes who
triumphed over the forces of dark¬
ness. But ¡f Islam has kept up this
Zoroastrian feast, it is because of the

role it plays in the stabilization of the
fiscal year and also because of its
jovial and lively ceremonies which
were highly esteemed at the courts
of the caliphs and the sultans. The
singing and music which always mark
Now Rouz explain why the sufis are
interested in this festival.
