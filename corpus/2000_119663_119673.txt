Pa ra d o x i c a l l y, scientists know more about the stars in our galaxy than about the number 
of species living on Earth
Coined by American researchers in the mid-
1980s, the term biodiversity has been in the
media spotlight ever since. It is a highly
complex concept which is still not widely unders-
tood by the general public. For scientists,the area
of research it covers remains uncharted territory.
According to the Convention on Biological
Diversity adopted in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in
1992, biodiversity is defined as “the variability
among living organisms from all sources inclu-
ding, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aqua-
tic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of
which they are part; this includes diversity within
species and of ecosystems.”
In plain English, biodiversity is both an idea
and a physical reality. As an idea, it refers to the
“variability” of living organisms, namely to their
ability to evolve in space and time, to adapt and
to survive.But it is also a physical reality, compri-
sing all living organisms and the relationships bet-
ween them. The concept of biodiversity can be
broken down into three different levels: genes,
species* and ecosystems*.
S u rp rising as it may seem, scientists know more
about the number of stars in our galaxy than they
do about the number of species living on Eart h .
Taxonomists* have inve n t o ried approx i m ately 
1.7 million living organisms—plants, animals and
micro-organisms (bacteri a , v i ru s e s , f u n gi , e t c. ) .
But a host of others exist in nature and it’s any b o-
d y ’s guess exactly how many. The most common
e s t i m ates va ry between eight and 15 million, bu t
some range up to 100 million. It would appear that
the environments with the highest number of ende-
mic* species are humid tropical forests.
2,000 apple varieties
identified worldwide
With the exception of mammals, the higher
plants and birds, scientists are rather unfamiliar
with species—and so they are light years away
from understanding everything there is to know
about genetic diversity. On the one hand, each
individual in the same species possesses a multi-
tude of genes that are responsible for its own cha-
r a c t e ri s t i c s. Humans have approx i m at e l y
100,000, and researchers have not yet identified
them all. On the other hand, genetic diversity is
expressed through the existence of distinct popu-
lations within the same species. For example,
some 2,000 varieties of apple have been identified
worldwide. For thousands of years, humans have
taken advantage of genetic diversity to domestica-
te wild species, particularly through cross-bree-
ding. Today, biotechnology* allows scientists to
go faster and further by creating new varieties of
transgenic* plants and animals.
In nature, species are not isolated but live in
r e l ationship with larger ecological complexe s ,
which make up, with their physical environment,
the planet’s ecosystems. Here again, scientists
acknowledge that they know very little about how
ecosystems work (see pp. 26-27) and the role they
play in the diversity of living organisms. ■
