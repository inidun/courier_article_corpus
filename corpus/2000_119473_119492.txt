A FRICAN MUSEUMS ON A
MEET-T HE - PEOPLE MISSION

Plagued by low visitor attendance, African museums are breaking out 
of their rigid colonial moulds and courting local communities
■
Since he started teaching aspiri n g
c u r at o rs in the early 1980s,E m m a n u e l
N n a k e nyi A rinze has advo c ated a
hands-on approach that even comes with a
dress code. “I tell my students that ‘ t h e
A f rican curator does not come to work in a
tie because you are going to be wo r k i n g
with your hands, on objects that are dirty,
in storage, in galleries or outside, or with
children who will pour ink over you.’ ”
I t ’s a small detail that nonetheless points
t owards deeper currents of change ru n n i n g
through A f rican museums as curat o rs and
their colleagues seek to define a model that
makes sense for A f ricans today.The process,
i n i t i ated in piecemeal fashion in the 1980s,
r e c e i ved a galvanizing thrust forward after
M a l i ’s Alpha Oumar Konaré, the first A f ri-
can to preside the Intern ational Council of
M u s e u m s , sounded the alarm by declari n g
in 1991 that “it is time, high time . . . to kill
the We s t e rn model of museum in A f ri c a .”
A crisis had been brewing for ye a rs.
Besides acute cutbacks in financing and trai-
n i n g, e x c e s s i ve bu r e a u c r a cy and political
interference in museum leaders h i p, the most
g l a ring sign of trouble was simply that A f ri-
can people, just about eve ry w h e r e , we r e
shunning their museums. In many cases,
they were discarded as “places for touri s t s
or museums for whites” as Alexis A d a n d é ,
director of the West A f rican Museums Pro-
gramme puts it.
All museums, e ven those founded after
i n d e p e n d e n c e ,were forced to address the cri-
s i s.Across the continent,d i r e c t o rs have star-
ted to shake up their institutions, d e ve l o p
more outward-looking attitudes and tune into
the lives and concerns of local people.T h i s
s t a rts with a novel approach to exhibitions
t h at invo l ves consulting communities from
the outset—not only to spark their interest,
but also because they own objects deemed of
higher symbolic value in their eyes than those
g at h e ring dust in museum show c a s e s.
In Bulawayo (Zimbabwe ) , the local
community was asked to bring in old pho-
t o graphs for display in the local art gallery.
“The exhibition proved ve ry popular as it
rekindled past memories of people’s life-
s t y l e s ,” recalls Francis Musonda, c h a i rm a n
of SADCAMM, an association which
groups museums from the southern A f ri c a
region.
In an experimental-style exhibition in
Ouidah (Benin) in 1985, families we r e
encouraged to display objects relating to local
f e s t i vals and family heri t a g e .The exhibit,s t a-
ged with art i facts ranging from portraits and
masks to statuettes representing female divi-
nities—which until then had been passed
d own within the same families for seve r a l
g e n e r at i o n s — was wa rmly greeted by the
p o p u l ation who for the most part were vie-
wing these precious pieces for the first time.
It created such interest that a small fa m i l y
museum was eventually opened in the city.
Appealing to an elite
In Nigeri a ,A ri n z e , who has held a num-
ber of prominent positions in the field of
museum deve l o p m e n t , organized a crow d -
d r awing exhibition on dru m s , d u ring which
musicians from selected villages were inv i t e d
to a city museum to share their know - h ow
and traditions with visitors. “ People in our
communities must be part of the process of
exhibiting objects that come from them.We
should gi ve them a chance to talk to us about
those objects and how they want to see them
s h own to a wider audience,” he say s.“ W h e n
an object is put here in isolation from its tru e
m e a n i n g, communities feel distanced from
it and slightly offended.”
All these types of initiat i ves enhance com-
m u n i t i e s ’p ride in their heritage and stimulat e
awareness about the value of safeguarding
o b j e c t s , while often shedding new light on
local history.They break the We s t e rn stereo-
type of a museum as a place where people
come to look at objects on display.With some
rare exceptions—such as Niamey’s “ a rts and
c r a f t s ” style concept with architectural
models linked to the country ’s ethnic gr o u p s ,
parks explaining the country ’s fauna and
flo r a , and pavilions presenting different dress
styles and customs—African museums we r e
c r e ated to satisfy the curiosity of an elite,
almost to the total exclusion of the locals.

them vehicles for encouraging nat i o n a l i s m

t h at can serve A f ri c a ’s deve l o p m e n t . “If the
d e finition of a museum is to collect,p r e s e rve
and transmit, this can be applied to a ve ry
broad range of concern s , from learning about
different styles of conflict resolution to iden-
tifying the health practices of different ethnic
gr o u p s ,” she affirm s.
Reaching a youthful audience
Pointing to conflicts that have torn so
m a ny A f rican countries apart in the past
d e c a d e , Tshiluila insists on the potential of
museums to bring about gr e ater unders t a n-
ding between ethnic gr o u p s. In this regard,
Ta n z a n i a ’s Village Museum has drawn at t e n-
tion well beyond its borders. In 1994, t h e
museum launched an annual event duri n g
which one or two ethnic groups (out of about
140) show their culture to others.They bu i l d
or rehabilitate traditional houses, explain to
v i s i t o rs the purpose of va rious cultural art i-
facts used, organize seminars about their his-
t o ry and culture, and share food and music.
Because they are invo l ved in the event from its
i n c e p t i o n , communities are gi ven the chance
to reflect upon what they value most about
their heri t a g e , and to find the most stimula-
ting ways of presenting it to others.
The idea of getting messages across can
extend to a broad range of concern s , f r o m
health or agriculture techniques to urbaniza-
t i o n . In Swaziland for example, c u r at o r

and fostering unity, the fact remains that col-
lections were constituted by foreign powe rs ,
and mostly for their interest alone.
“The gr e at problem for ethnogr a p h i c -
style museums is to think about new ways of
using objects which for the most part have
‘ d i e d ’ ,”explains A d a n d é ,r e f e rring to the intri-
c ate ‘ l i v i n g ’r e l ationship between an object,
such as a mask,and the role it plays in a gi ve n
cultural context. In the case of the palace-
museum in Abomey (Benin), a rt i facts belon-
ging to ru l e rs of the former 17th-century king-
dom are brought out during ritual ceremonies
linked to the cult of ancestors.These objects
are “ c h a r g e d ” to regain their sacred powe r ,
and at the end of the ceremony rendered
i n a n i m at e , since a fully charged object can-
not be left on show for viewing by the ave r a g e
v i s i t o r. But this type of initiat i ve is not feasible
when objects have been collected in one part
of the country for display in another.
But museum directors are still fa c e d
with the question of bri n ging meaning back
into collections constituted during colonial
t i m e s.“Should these objects be returned to
populations to create local museums or be
used for educational purp o s e s , e s p e c i a l l y
for youth from cities?”asks Adandé.

R o s e m a ry Andrade has opened up the doors
of the national museum to exhibitions on
H I V-Aids preve n t i o n , in part n e rship with
local NGOs. On another occasion, n o t i c i n g
the talents of Mozambican refugees at recy-
cling mat e ri a l s , she staged an exhibition
s h owcasing their skills, to promote gr e at e r
tolerance between these recent arri vals and
the locals.
It could be argued that eve ry exhibition is
an educational endeavo u r , but if there is one
audience that museums feel they have to
r e a c h , it is children and yo u t h . “ M u s e u m s
and heritage sites provide an educat i o n
resource that has been deva s t atingly unde-
rutilized by teachers ,e d u c ation depart m e n t s ,
u n i ve rs i t i e s , NGOs and museums them-

Museum Ambassador Programme in South
A f ri c a .This initiat i ve trains young people to
teach their peers about museums in the Cape
Town area by giving presentations in schools
and running museum tours.
A number of other museums now orga-
nize workshops for teachers , who are encou-
raged to link issues in the curriculum with col-
lections in the museum.In Benin, the nat i o n a l
h e ritage school runs training aimed at increa-
sing the ability of museum educat o rs across
the continent to design programmes for
schools and local communities.

c r e ated after independence, was among the
first to realize that its prime role was educa-
t i o n a l .“ E ven though we started from scrat c h
when we bu i l t our own museum, we realized
t h at we could be doing much more to let
people know that we existed.And we wa n t e d
to catch people at an early age, in pri m a ry

key Pule.
In one of the longest running outreach pro-
grammes in A f ri c a ,k n own as the Zebra on
W h e e l s , staff from the national museum set
out once a term with a van filled with art i fa c t s
to organize daylong exhibits in rural schools,
along with talks and slideshows and mov i e s
on the country ’s environment and cultural
h e ri t a g e . Besides bri n ging the museum to the
v i l l a g e , the programme exposes children to
crafts and customs from different parts of Bots-
wa n a ,f o s t e ring a sense of national pri d e .
E n c o u r a ging children to take pride in
their heritage is an investment that curat o rs
k n ow has long-term payo f f s. In Zimbabwe ,

a programme involving school students aims
to limit vandalism around archaeologi c a l
s i t e s. In T s o d i o l o, B o t swa n a , on a site where
there are over 1,000 rock paintings locals are
i nvo l ved in the opening of a museum and
are being trained as guides. They are also
s h a ring with museum professionals their
k n owledge of this ancient site, which is up
for world heritage status nominat i o n .
A museum without walls
This process howe ve r ,has to be nurt u r e d ,
especially when it comes to turning sites into
cultural at t r a c t i o n s.“It takes a lot of time to
s t rike up a dialogue with communities, e s p e-
cially rural ones.In fa c t ,i t ’s always what people
d o n ’t say that is import a n t ,” s ays Malagasy

R a k o t o a ri s o a . For the past several ye a rs ,h e
has been working with villagers on a 14th-
c e n t u ry fort i fied site that is still considered
s a c r e d . His aim: to create a “museum without
walls or collections”—an itinerary around the

and an adjacent “ s a c r e d ” forest harbouri n g
rare plant species that have remained untou-
ched for centuri e s. He would like to see chil-
dren from the city visit the site as part of their
school progr a m m e , be guided through it by
the villagers and encourage the revival of lost
craft techniques.
G i ven the number of ve n e r ated cultural
and historical sites around the island—and
throughout A f rica—there is potential for this
kind of approach to flo u ri s h ,p r ovided com-
munities feel they have a hold on the pro-
c e s s.“All too often this type of operation dies
off within six months because an outsider turn s
up with the money,and when it runs out, t h e
project dies.” R a k o t o a risoa cautions against
making calculations based largely on the eco-
nomic viability of such projects, e x p r e s s i n g
