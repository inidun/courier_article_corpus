C o n d é :
g rand dame of
Caribbean litera t u re
w h i t e.Then when I went to France I dis-
covered that the colour of my skin
meant something. It was not an acci-
dent that I was black.There was a deep
difference between me and the people
whose skin was white. I had to go to
Africa to discover the meaning and
importance of that difference.
EN:And what did you discover?
M C : At the beginning I thought the dif-
ference was that black people had a
common culture that was different from
the culture of French people. I believed
that all black people were united by a
common origin, a common history. We
were basically one people divided by the
evils of slavery. I , who was born in Gua-
d e l o u p e, was separated from the people
in Guinea, where I was in A f r i c a ,s i m p l y
because of the slave trade.
EN:Do you think differently now?
M C : I made an important discovery in
A f r i c a : I did not share the same lan-
guage as the people in Guinea. We did
not eat the same food—this may seem
trivial to you,but it is important.We did
not dress the same way,we did not enjoy
the same type of music, we did not share
the same religion. In a few months, I
found myself terribly isolated. I could
not even communicate with my Gui-
nean husband. So I made a second dis-
c o v e r y :r a c e, in fact, is not the essential
f a c t o r.What is important is culture.As I
did not share the culture of the Gui-
nean people, of the African people, I
left A f r i c a ,a n d , as a result, my marriage
e n d e d .
E N :Then would it be fair to say that cultu-
rally there are now more similarities bet-
ween you and your husband, R i c h a rd
P h i l c o x , though he is white and British,
than there were between you and your firs t
h u s b a n d , though he was black and African? 
MC: When I met Richard twenty years
ago, I was in my period of political acti-
vism and I could not see myself with a
white man.My children,also, were very
nationalistic and so they were shocked
and disturbed that I would be involved
with a white man.But eventually I came
to understand that the colour of one’s
skin does not matter. I found that a white
man was closer to me than my first hus-
N:I was very moved by a talk
you gave two years ago about
g rowing up in Guadeloupe
and thinking of yourself as no
d i f f e rent from a Fre n c h
person. Could you talk about
why it was important for you
to go to Africa?
M C : E l i z a b e t h , I remember when I took
you to a restaurant in Guadeloupe how
surprised and shocked you were to see
that all the cooks and waiters were
w h i t e,French people.So imagine what it
was like growing up in Guadeloupe
some years back. The teachers in the
schools were Fr e n c h . The priests, w h e n
we went to Mass with our families, w e r e
w h i t e. We lived in a completely white,
French environment. It seemed normal
to me. I did not ask any questions. O f
c o u r s e, when I looked at my face in the
mirror I could see that it was black, b u t
for me, colour was totally unimportant.
I felt I was exactly like the people
around me, that is to say, French and

b a n d ,even closer to me than the majority
of the people I knew. It is a matter of
u n d e r s t a n d i n g : in a word, l o v e. M a r r i a g e
should not be viewed as part of a political
a g e n d a . It concerns the feelings and per-
sonal choices of two people.
EN: To return to the time when you left
A f r i c a , did you go back to Guadeloupe or
to France?
MC: One has to make a living, so I went
to Fr a n c e, though it was difficult there for
me to find a job. But in France I
immersed myself in the Guadeloupean
and Martiniquan society living as a
person in exile. Five years later, I went
back to Guadeloupe.
E N : So what are your thoughts now about
Africa? Do you sometimes feel ashamed of
Africa when you hear stories of the cor-
ruption there? I often think that a cruel
j o ke is being played on us today. Just as we
a re beginning to re s t o re our pride in our
rich African heritage, we are being bom-
b a rded with media reports about the cor-
ruption that seems to be rampant in A f r i c a .
MC: I lived for twelve years in Africa.I
must confess they were the most diffic u l t
years of my life. I was in Guinea and
G h a n a . One cannot deny the corruption
of the régimes there.The people in those
regions are suffering from the evils of
their rulers. They are dying of hunger
and disease.We have to face the fact that
there is a lot of evil and hardship in
A f r i c a . But it should not lead us to
conclude that Africa is inferior. It took
years for European countries to arrive at
d e m o c r a cy. Even now many of them
have not achieved it.Fr a n c e, for example,
is constantly being ripped apart by strikes
and riots. So why should we be ashamed
of the problems of Africa? They are
aggravated by neocolonialism, by the
lack of education for the people. Th i s
situation is the consequence of many
years of colonialism, of independence
that happened under the worst possible
conditions. So I am not ashamed at all.
Africa is trying hard to find solutions. I
believe that one day it will.
E N : In your novel The Last of the African
K i n g s you seem to satirize those middle-
class African Americans who speak only in
glowing terms about the African people
and are critical of those who focus on
the corruption that exists there.You wro t e
about a fictitious “ p restigious black col-
lege in Atlanta where duty towards one’s
race was taught as devoutly as science
and litera t u re.”
M C : Those African Americans who think
this way are simply trying to find a way
to hide their deep inferiority complex.
They are ashamed of Africa as it is today,
and they prefer to lie about the corrup-
tion and evil there. Let’s face it:Africa
has been robbed of its grandeur, of its
p o w e r, of its magnific e n c e. If we keep
having the kind of discourse that
conceals these painful facts, we will have
an incomplete view of Africa.It is time
we realize that we have a duty towards
the suffering of our people. I am not
interested in fighting for reparation for
slavery or for financial aid. I am fig h t i n g
Leaving the church in Sainte-Luce, Martinique. Taken at the start of 20th century.

M C :N o,not really. It would be too easy to
say that I am writing to educate my
p e o p l e.For the early generation of writers,
like Aimé Césaire, that was their goal—
t e a c h i n g, writing for their people. Fo r
m y s e l f, for my generation, we are much
more modest.We are writing to make the
world understandable to us first of all,
and if it is understandable to us, p e r h a p s
others will understand the world better.
E N : Is this why you do not write your
books in Creole? A c c o rding to some intel-
lectuals like Patrick Chamoiseau in Mar-
tinique, as Caribbean writers we should
write our stories in Creole, the language
of the majority of the people in the Carib-
bean.
M C : I refuse to accept that kind of dicho-
tomy between French and Creole. As I
like to say,Maryse Condé does not write
in French or Creole.Maryse Condé writes
in Maryse Condé.Each of us has to find a
v o i c e, a way of expressing the emotions,
the inner impressions that we have,and to
do that we should use all the languages
that are at our disposal. In my last novel,
Célanire cou-coupé, there is a glossary at
the end of the book. In it you will fin d
words in African languages, in Creole lan-
g u a g e s, in Spanish. In order to express
the story I wanted to tell, in the manner I
w a n t e d , I had to use many resources.Th a t
kind of narrow choice between Fr e n c h
and Creole is a political choice. In politics
it is necessary to speak in the language
that can be best understood by our
p e o p l e, that is closest to our people, b u t
when we write, we should be totally free
to choose the medium that is best suited

to find a solution that I can give to the
people of Africa who are in despair, w h o
need to find a way to restore faith in
t h e m s e l v e s. To quote [Jamaican black
nationalist] Marcus Garvey, “I would
like to teach the black man to find beauty
in himself.” The problem for me is not
fighting white people who are bad and
e v i l , but fighting our own people who
are bad and evil.
E N : Yet you write a lot about slavery,
which I find unusual for a Caribbean writer.
Caribbean people seem to sweep such
stories under the rug.We seem to want to
think well of the “mother country,” of the
Europeans. Recently, a British expatriate
reviewer in Trinidad, bristling under the
criticism of colonialism in my latest novel
Bruised Hibiscus, implied that I had bitten
the hand that had fed me. I was shocked
by the silence that followed her review,
even from my family. No one stood up to
say the obvious—that it was I who had fed
the British through slavery and colonia-
lism. What do you hope to achieve with
the stories you tell about slavery?
MC: People often ask me for whom am
I writing.The answer is I am writing for
myself. I write about slavery,Africa,the
condition of black people throughout
the world because I want to order my
t h o u g h t s, to understand the world,and to
be at peace with myself. I write to try to
find answers to the questions I ask
myself. Writing for me is a type of the-
rapy, a way to be safe and sound.
E N : So you don’t have an instructive goal
in mind?

Maryse Condé: g rand dame
of Caribbean litera t u re
to our desires and aspirations.
E N :And for you, is that language Fre n c h ?
M C :My Fr e n c h , my own brand of Fr e n c h .
It is not the language you hear in Fr a n c e.
It is a combination of the language of a
person born in Guadeloupe,who listens to
the many different sounds of language,
and my own personal language.
E N : So what makes someone an authentic
Caribbean writer?
MC: I hate the word authentic. Here, I
a m ,Maryse Condé, born in Guadeloupe,
having lived in Africa and Paris,and now
living and working in New York. Here
you are, Elizabeth Nunez, born in Tri-
n i d a d , working and living for most of
your life in New Yo r k . We are both
authentic Caribbean writers. It is a ques-
tion of a personal choice, how we relate
to our mother country in the Caribbean,
how we see our place in the world,how
we see ourselves and who we are.
EN: Yet I sometimes think that because I
live outside of the Caribbean, people there
think either I have lost the right to write
about the Caribbean or that I have been
away too long to be able to write authen-
tically about it.Do you ever experience a
similar anxiety?
M C : What does it mean to write authen-
tically about the Caribbean? When you
w r i t e, you give your version of reality. I
am never anxious to justify myself to the
p u b l i c. If they believe that I am not a
true Caribbean writer, t h a t ’s fair enough,
but I do believe that I have all the right to
speak about Guadeloupe and that I am a
t o t a l , genuine Guadeloupean writer.
E N : But do you think there is a distinctive
Caribbean literature?
M C : Ye s, but it is difficult to define.
Edwidge Danticat [a young Haitian
author living in New York] is writing an
aspect of Caribbean literature.Yo u ,E l i-
zabeth, are writing an aspect of Carib-
bean literature. I am writing an aspect of
Caribbean literature and the people who
are writing at home, who never leave
home—Patrick Chamoiseau for
example—they are writing an aspect of
Caribbean literature. The totality of all
these different voices compose a sym-
phony which is Caribbean literature. I am
not going to define it because it is too
c o m p l e x , too plural, too changing to have
only one narrow definition.
E N : Some people label me a feminist
writer because of the strong female cha-
racters in my novels. But the truth is that
I don’t deliberately try to create strong
women.My characters are patterned after
the women who have influenced my life:
those who refused to see themselves as
victims and took charge of their lives.T h e re
are also very strong female characters in
your novels.Would you say you are a femi-
nist writer? 
M C : My answer is similar to yours. I was
educated by a strong mother and a strong
g r a n d m o t h e r. My sisters are strong. A l l
the women I knew in Guadeloupe were
s t r o n g. They triumphed over the condi-
tions that limited them. My books are a
r e flection of what I see in life. I don’t think
I am a feminist. I write about what I know.
EN:I loved your novel, Windward Heights.
It was liberating to see Emily Bro n t ë ’s classic
work through the eyes of a black cast of cha-
ra c t e rs. You effectively dismantled ra c i s t
theories that would dispute our common
h u m a n i t y. Was this your intention or did
you have more personal reasons for wri-
ting your novel?
M C : Somebody gave me Emily Brontë’s
Wuthering Heights when I was about 15 and
was still living in Guadeloupe. I was a very
sombre child,a very lonely child.My mother
died when I was very young and for years I
tried to reconnect with her. I looked for her
e v e r y w h e r e, in nature,e v e r y w h e r e.When I
read Wuthering Heights, I felt it was written
for me. I ident i fied completely with Heath-
c l i f f’s pass i o n


the subject but you recently established
the book prize, Prix Des Amériques Insu-
l a i res et de la Guyane, for the best litera r y
work written in any of the languages of
the Caribbean.
M C : Some people criticize me for accep-
ting money from Amédée Huyghues Des-
pointes who funded the prize.They say he
is a b é k é [a white Creole from the planto-
c r a cy ] , but the man loves Guadeloupe as
I love Guadeloupe.He is concerned about
the country’s future. We are in the year
2 0 0 0 . We should be finished with these
divisions between black and white and
move towards unity.
EN: You have a new book, Célanire cou-
coupé.
M C : I t ’s a departure from my other
n o v e l s. My daughters have been com-
plaining that all my novels are sad and
p a i n f u l , so I wrote a comical novel, a fan-
tastic novel. It is based on a story I read
in a newspaper in Guadeloupe, in 1995,
about a baby girl who was found dead,
her throat slashed, in a heap of rubbish.
E N :That doesn’t sound like a happy novel,
Maryse.
M C : Listen and tell me what you think.
Everyone wanted to know why the baby
was killed that way. I mean,a woman who
wants to get rid of her baby doesn’t usually
slash the baby’s t h r o a t .Th e r e is a special
cruelty and malice in doing such a thing.S o
people in Guadeloupe began to specu-
late that the baby was used as a human
s a c r i fic e. In my novel, I imagined she was
brought back to life by a doctor who
repaired her throat.The girl then goes in
search of those who murdered her.
EN:That is a very sad story.
MC:Wait. The girl begins to attack eve-
rything that we think of as sacred. For
e x a m p l e, she goes to Africa at the begin-
ning of colonization.When she sees that
colonization is failing because there is no
communication between Africans and
Europeans, she decides that the way to
improve the situation is to have a bor-
dello where African women could make
love to white men.A h , you are laughing.
EN:That is funny.
MC:So, you see, I was not wrong to say
the novel is comical.
EN: Farcical.
MC:Yes, that is the word.
E N : How do you manage to do all that
you do, Maryse? You are a magnific e n t
w r i t e r, you have a brilliant career as a
professor, scholar, administrator, literary
activist, mentor to fledging writers, and
yet you have a very active family life.
M C : H o n e s t l y, I do not have an answer.
I do not make an effort to be one or the
o t h e r. I am everything at the same time. ■



to find Cathy after her death. I wrote my
novel to prove that in spite of differences
in time, c o n d i t i o n s, or ideology, w o m e n
could communicate with each other
because we share common desires and
e x p e r i e n c e s. Emily Brontë could speak
to Maryse Condé more than a century
later because her story was similar to my
personal history. I was compelled to
rewrite Brontë’s story, not to show the
differences between Caribbean women
and English women, b u t ,r a t h e r, to show
what we had in common.
EN: I notice that you begin the book by
saying you hope Emily Brontë will appro v e
of your interpretation of her masterpiece.
Did that wish for her approval limit you in
any way?
MC: I must confess that I totally forgot
Emily Brontë, the author, when I was
writing my novel.What I concentrated on
was the passion between Cathy and Hea-
t h c l i f f, the excessive love that fused these
two characters. But I read Brontë’s novel
often, and I kept it on my desk open to
the page where Cathy says, “I am Hea-
thcliff.” That is a beautiful line. It tells
about the intensity of passion possible
between two people. When I was fin i-
shed writing my novel, I wondered what
Brontë would think of it, but it was not a
serious question I asked myself. I never
tried to compete with Brontë. She posed
no problem for me.
E N : Can you talk a little about your work at
Columbia University?  I know you cre a t e d
the Department of Francophone Studies
t h e re. In fact, you are the chairpers o n .
MC: In New York there is a lot of space
devoted to the English- and Spanish-
speaking Caribbean people,but there is
hardly any space for Fr e n c h - s p e a k i n g
Caribbean people. It seems as if we don’t
e x i s t .When I tell people I am from Gua-
d e l o u p e, they are puzzled. They have
never heard of Guadeloupe.When I was
invited to teach Caribbean literature at
Columbia University, I felt I had a duty
to use my position to create a depart-
ment to attract people from the French
Caribbean so that they would have a
space to talk about themselves and about
their work and so make their presence
k n o w n . I won’t say I changed the face of
New York—that would be arrogant—
but at Columbia, at least, people now
know that Aimé Césaire is not the only
Francophone writer from the Caribbean.
E N : You are far too modest, M a r y s e. I
know you are also an advocate for all
Caribbean litera t u re. Not only have you
o rganized some major conferences on
CONDÉ AT THE HELM
St o r y t e l l e r, a c t i v i s t , teacher and critic—but perhaps one title best applies to Maryse Condé:n a v i-
gator. For the grande dame of Caribbean literature incites us to explore ever-shifting terrain,
from the cruelty of the slave trade and the self-hate caused by racism to the spiral of lovers’ pas-
s i o n . In threading through the web of relations between A f r i c a , the Caribbean and Europe,C o n d é
calls on her personal experience. Born in 1937 in Guadeloupe, she left her comfortable family at
the age of 16 to study in Paris, where the spirit of decolonization and the Négritude movement
led her to criss-cross Western Africa,first with her Guinean husband and then as a single mother
of four children. Returning to Paris in 1973, she completed a doctorate in Caribbean literature from
the Sorbonne while launching her literary career. Her first great success was her S e g u s e r i e s
( 1 9 8 4 ) , renowned for its historically accurate and engaging portra yal of the impact of Islam on ani-
mist West Africa and the brutality of the slave trade.
In 1985,Condé won a Fulbright scholarship to teach in the U.S. and went on to set up the Cen-
ter for French and Francophone Studies at Columbia University where she continues to teach.H e r
11 works of fiction (translated in several languages) have earned her numerous prizes, including
the prestigious French awards, Le Grand Prix Litteraire de la Femme (1986) and the Prix Yource-
nar (1999).Perhaps more importantly, Condé is one of the few “foreign”authors to be accepted
by Africans as one of their own.She and her husband,Richard Philcox,divide their time between
New York and Guadeloupe. ■
