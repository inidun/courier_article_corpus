Paris has Japanese, South Korean, Malian and
Moroccan designers, but few people from the
South have achieved the rank of “couturier”.
Fashion design now exists in eve ry
c o u n t ry in the wo r l d , but I am only the
third designer from the South—after A z z e-
dine Alaïa of Tunisia and Oscar de la Renta
of the Dominican Republic, for the Bal-
main fashion house—to have achieved the
rank of couturi e r , recognized by their peers
of the Pa ris haute couture professional trade
b o d y. Until now, t h at distinction wa s
reserved for Western designers from coun-
tries with a more developed fashion tradi-
tion. I was lucky enough to start out at a
time when haute couture was opening up to
new talents and encouraging new fashion
houses that were able to express a part i c u l a r
aesthetic sensibility despite their limited
financial resources. So I didn’t suffer from
chauvinistic ostracism, in fa c t , it was just the
o p p o s i t e . From Italy’s Schiaparelli to Spain’s
B a l e n c i a g a, haute couture has alway s
embraced people from different countri e s.
Because Pa ris is in a class of its ow n . It is no
more French than New York is A m e ri c a n :i t
belongs to the world. On the other hand,
Pa risians are so uptight and demanding
t h at you have to be really talented to express
yourself here.
Do you consider fashion a form of artistic
expression?
The couturier is not an art i s t , but a
craftsman with his or her own sensibility. N o
a rtist is expected to change so fa s t ,c r e at i n g
two collections a year. And then, fashion
comes with commercial obligat i o n s. M y
work provides a livelihood for a whole team:
I don’t have the right to run out of inspira-
t i o n . So people shouldn’t imagine us as
egotistical artists bullied around by fin a n c i a l
b a c k e rs. Fashion is an artistic industry resul-
ting from compromise rather than tension.
D e s i g n e rs and their financial backers know
t h at they have to move ahead together.



OCIMAR 
V ERSOLATO’S 
H Y BRID CRE AT IONS
Though too pricey for the average consumer, Brazilian couturier Ocimar Versolato interweaves
multiculturalism and sensuality to create designs that match women’s dreams

D e s i g n e rs can no longer make their wil-
dest dreams come true and then just for-
ward the bill,like they used to.
If fashion is not an art, then what is it?
Fashion designers and couturi e rs appre-
hend the subconscious life of our societies
and go on to represent it with their own par-
ticular sensibility.There is a crucial need for
fashion to maintain this transparent channel
to people’s sub-conscience, in order to
u n c over their hidden desires and gi ve
expression to them.That ’s why we don’t
look at our surroundings the way others
do. Our minds are fast as rockets and we
look at eve rything through emotional,
impassioned eye s. I admire the speed of
videos that gi ve you a maximum amount of
i n f o rm ation in a minimum amount of time.
N ow that ’s a truly contemporary language!
How do you justify haute couture prices?
An evening gow n ,which is entirely sewn
by hand so that all the stitches are inv i s i b l e ,
requires hundreds of hours of highly specia-
lized wo r k .Add to that the employe r ’s pay r o l l
expenses and ove r h e a d ,and I have to sell it for
around 80,000 French francs ($13,300).
In spite of the high prices, is haute couture a
profitable business?
My fashion house, like many others ,l i ve s
off the patronage of approx i m ately fif t y
c u s t o m e rs. We aren’t losing money, but we
a r e n ’t making much, e i t h e r. M a ny houses
take advantage of the prestige associated with
fashion to sell perfumes and accessori e s ,
which are more immediately profit a b l e .I ’ ve
refused to do that : you cannot exercise a crea-
t i ve activity with nothing but the profit motive
in mind. If I want to communicate the image
of my creation to customers , I must absolu-
tely not ruin that image by launching, f o r
e x a m p l e , a shampoo with my name on it.O r
you have to justify your approach.Mine start s
at the top: I began with haute couture,d e ve-
loped luxury ready-to-wear clothes and laun-
ched my line of jeans,a lways sticking as close
as possible to my customers ’n e e d s
Your dresses follow the outlines of an ideal
woman: the Versolato woman. Do your
customers look like her? 
I’m surp rised to see how much my cus-
t o m e rs resemble each other both because of
their age—between 18 and 40—and cha-
r a c t e r.They are self-confident women who

Diaphanous drapings in Rajasthan (India): doesn’t every woman invent her own style?

do not feel inhibited about showing their
b o d i e s. By choosing my light clothes, w h i c h
enhance their character, they feel like they
are reaching the perfect balance that defin e s
elegance.These women come in sneakers
and jeans. They put on an evening gown.
And suddenly their postures, their at t i t u d e s
and even their faces change.They feel beau-
t i f u l , t h e y ’re no longer the same. I enjoy
the fact that haute couture enables me to
h ave direct contact with my customers ,
which would hardly be possible in ready-to-
we a r , where the only people designers eve r
meet are buyers.
Too many people cannot afford haute
couture...
To offer eve rybody the pleasure of a
p u r c h a s e , I have created a line of jeans star-
ting at 400 French francs ($67).To d ay, t h e
h e a rt of dreams—haute couture—is on tele-
vision when the two annual collections take
place.In my view, having access to dreams
is more important than possessing the item
t h at nurtures them.When I arri ved in Pa ri s ,
I had a very tight budget.And yet I visited
a rt galleri e s , examining eve rything I wa n t e d
to buy without paying any attention to the
price, but trying to picture what it would
look like at home. I t ’s the same with clothes.
You can’t afford to buy eve rything yo u
want, but you should at least be given the
chance to see what’s out there and savour
the dream inspired by these fashions.
Even though fashion has become an
international industry, do the dresses you design
for your customers reflect your origins a little?
They attempt to express the nat u r a l
seduction which has free rein in Brazil. M y
f e l l ow citizens are open, smiling and fri e n d l y.
They want to seduce eve rybody all the time.
My dresses bear the mark of a country where
people are not ashamed of their bodies.W h e-
ther or not they have perfect looks,B r a z i l i a n s
l i ve almost naked six months a ye a r ,we a ri n g
just a pair of shorts or small items. I discove-
red that in Europe, on the other hand, t h e
body had to remain hidden. Its cultural tra-
dition advises against displaying a less-than-
perfect chest or we a ring a mini-skirt if yo u
d o n ’t have pretty knees.The couturier in me
is trying to treat these traumas.
Brazil is a mixture of ethnic and religious
groups. Does your fashion reflect cultural
diversity?
I remember two Arab princesses. The
m o t h e r , who was rather stri c t , got upset
when she saw that her daughter was inter-
ested in a see-through dress. Until I offered
to add a bodysuit to gi ve a layer of cove ri n g .
The cultural dive rsity expressed by my
fashions consists, among other things, of
o f f e ring sensuality to those who are depri ve d
of it because of their culture. As for the
r e s t , I’m impervious to race, except when I
can use it as a source of inspiration.I desi-
gned an haute couture collection based on
the theme of multicultural melange, dres-
sing Japanese like A f ri c a n s , A f ricans like
R u s s i a n s , and these amusing twists we n t
over we l l . For fashion is a world unto itself,
f r e e , without prejudices—and therefore
open to all kinds of mixing.As an interna-
tional form of expression, fashion must
i n t e gr ate all cultures. My team includes
B r a z i l i a n s ,I t a l i a n s , Japanese and Germ a n s ,
whose skills round each other out.

America keep up with your career?
HAUTE COU T URE
In 18 58, Charles Worth of Great Britain, Empress
Eugénie’s couturier, moved to the Rue de la Pa i x
and, towards the end of the nineteenth century,
presented his creations on living models. “Haute
Couture”, which stood apart from hand-made
garments by its luxurious nature, quickly beca m e
a form of expression practiced by all the great
names in fashion history, including Poiret, Chanel
and Balenciaga. Industrial production methods
based on American Taylorism developed in the
1930s and 1940s, and by the 1950s hand-made
garments entered the era of mass production:
ready-to-wear was born.
At the same time, haute couture prices conti-
nued to climb, partly to factor in expensive labour
costs. Meanwhile, its clientele steadily declined.
By the 1980s, haute couture was being exhibited
in museums, raising it to full-fledged art form
status. Based exclusively in Paris and, secondarily,
in Italy, where Versace and Valentino have their
own ‘Alta Moda’ lines, haute couture designers
present two collections a year including approxi-
mately 60 pieces per couturier, which make
headlines in newspapers’ fashion sections around
the world. Although haute couture is in the red
today, its prestige allows companies to sell less
expensive but more profitable items like ready-
to-wear, handbags, fra g rances, watches and eye-
glasses.
Haute couture sales may not be rising in
volume, but overall the fashion market is expan-
ding by leaps and bounds. The most powerful
groups are Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren of the
United States, followed by France’s LV MH (Dior,
Givenchy, Lacroix) and, far behind, Italy’s Armani,
Gucci and Prada. These companies are still very
discreet about their profits. For comparison’s
sake, French designers and couturiers recorded
sales of 20 billion francs ($3.3 billion) in 19 97, as
opposed to 16 billion ($2.6 billion) for Calvin
Klein alone. ■

I have n ’t worked at becoming a sort of star
in South A m e ri c a , but fame is part of my
p r o f e s s i o n .For example, I didn’t think anyo n e
had ever heard of me in Buenos A i r e s.So I wa s
totally surp rised when television journ a l i s t s
there got in touch with me.They consider me
South A m e rican rather than Brazilian,a n d ,a s
s u c h , a representat i ve of A r g e n t i n a .
Does Brazil have an innovative, lively fashion
scene?
The reality is that too many people there,
as elsewhere in the southern countri e s ,m a k e
c o p i e s. More accurat e l y, copies of copies of
c o p i e s. But Brazil is a country where any-
thing is possible.D i rt poor provinces exist next
to highly developed metropolises such as São
Pa u l o, where luxury can find some expre-
s i o n .And Brazilians, like any other people,a r e
able to show the world their particular sense
of aesthetics. I’m delighted that Brazilian
fashion designers have made headway and
n ow have the courage to show themselve s.B u t
they have neither the know - h ow nor the stan-
dards to be intern ationally successful.They are
n a i ve to the point of designing a whole col-
lection with a flat pat t e rn , a simple sewing
machine and an overcast machine1. T h e i r
clothes don’t have any vo l u m e , roundness or
s o p h i s t i c at i o n .Nobody ever taught them how
to make a well-tailored jacket.
How can they get out of this dead end?
Brazilians are curious by nat u r e , a n d
they want to learn .I ’d like to help them by
e n c o u r a ging a transfer of techniques. I n
F r a n c e , labour in the fashion industry is in
s h o rt supply, highly specialized and expen-
s i ve , while tens of millions of people are
u n e m p l oyed and looking for work in Brazil.
By training some of them in France,we ’d also
find a long-term way of improving technical
skills and raising standards back in Brazil
which could make quality shoes and clothes
for all the designers in the wo r l d .
Are you advocating globalization?
I t ’s already here.To d ay, you can design a
g a rment here, assemble it there and embroider
it somewhere else.So yo u ’re better off making
the most of what eve ryo n e ’s best at .After the
wa r , s m a rt people in ove rp o p u l ated India
opened small embroidery fa c t o ri e s. To d ay,
almost all the embroidery sold around the
world comes from India, and the quality can
be as good as it is in Pa ri s.
Have other developing countries specialized in
other techniques?
Right now, e ve rything is incredibly cen-
tralized in Europe—or in Japan, a country
t h at can be considered We s t e rn . But China
has developed techniques for silk, of which
it is the world’s leading producer. One day
it will probably have the same stat e - o f - t h e -
art technology as Europe. And when that
d ay comes, the other countries will tremble.
Does Brazil have any women fashion designers?
Most of the neighbourhood designers
are men, but Brazilian women have never
come up against any obstacles to enter the
fashion industry. Each one is a designer in
her own right.Gifted with an innate sense
of gr o o m i n g, they know how to dress for
a ny occasion without falling into stereo-
types or ridiculous clichés.
Do women prefer being dressed by men?
Male designers gi ve themselves the
freedom to be more daring than their female
c o u n t e rp a rt s , simply because they don’t
have to wear what they create.Their aes-
thetic sense blossoms without restraint and
their customers , who don’t hesitate put-
ting on eight-centimeter heels to look beau-
tiful, prefer aesthetics to comfort.
What’s your state of mind when you design
your collections?
C o u t u ri e rs are wrongly described as
h e a rtless and inaccessible. On the contrary,
like all creat i ve individuals, they are ve ry sen-
s i t i ve and try to defend their fragi l i t y. I f
they want to sell dreams, they must find an
image of the world that expresses happiness.
So it really doesn’t matter whether they
keep their feet on the gr o u n d . C l o t h i n g
designed by a couturier is different from
o r d i n a ry ready-to-wear because of the fee-
lings it conveys. During a fashion show, a
dress has just 30 seconds to express a whole
universe.
Have you used your fame to serve useful
causes?
I’ve staged a fashion show that people
had to pay to see,with the $20,000 in pro-
ceeds going towards the construction of a
building for children with cancer. R i g h t
now, I’m working with the photographer
Sebastião Salgado on a reforestation project.
The funding will come from a show I’m hel-
ping to put on. ■
