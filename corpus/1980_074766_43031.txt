IT happened at Mourlot's works in
1945, in the old workshops in Rue
de Chabrol, Paris. The story is told
by Jean Célestin, a craftsman who was
working with Picasso at the time and
who says of him. "He has left his mark
on me. Working with Picasso has add¬
ed something special to my life." And
he adds: "He has a feeling; he has, how
shall I put it, incredible talents... he is
gifted; he is a painter".
The story of the bull should be heard
in the huge workshops, where the vats
of ink shine, the machines turn, posters
are hung all about, the workmen bustle
at their work and the painters pass by.
"One day", said Célestin, "he started
work on the famous bull. It was a
superb, well-rounded bull. I thought
myself that that was that. But not at all.
A second state and a third state, still
well-rounded, followed. And so it went
on. But the bull was no longer the
same. It began to get smaller and to
lose weight... That same day Henri
Deschamps told me that Picasso 'was
taking away rather than adding to his
composition...' He was carving away

The
metamorphosis
of a bull

slices of his bull at the same time. And
after each change we pulled a proof. He
could see that we were puzzled. He
made a joke, he went on working, and
then he produced another bull. And
each time less and less of the bull re¬
mained. He used to look at me and
laugh. 'Look Henri', he would say, 'we
ought to give this bit to the butcher.
The housewife could say I want that
piece, or this one...' In the end, the
bull's head was like that of an ant." And
to conclude the story of the bull
Célestin said: "At the last proof there
remained only a few lines. I had watch¬
ed him at work, reducing, always
reducing.
"I still remembered the first bull and I
said to myself: What I don't understand
is that he has ended up where really he
should have started! But he, Picasso,
was seeking his own bull. And to
achieve his one line bull he had gone in
successive stages through all the other
bulls. And when you look at that line
you cannot imagine how much work it
had involved..."
"There are paintings in which there
seems to be nothing, yet which contain
everything", said Corot. And the pro¬
gression to the bull is typical of this.
Each state has its meaning and each of
these meanings leads towards another
form of truth. What remains carries all
the range of thought we imply when we
say the word "bull".
