ach time we’ve found works abroad, w h i c h
number 8,000 so far, international police
cooperation was essential,” says General
Roberto Conforti. To make his point, t h e
head of the c a r a b i n i e r i squad specialized in
protecting artistic heritage tells the story of the Vi r g i n,
painted by Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1479).
In 1995,the painting was stolen from the Pieve
di Calci,a church near Pisa,and vanished into thin
a i r.One day, a detective from Scotland Yard who had
i n filtrated a drug ring thought he’d found a suspect.
He contacted the Italian police, who identified the
suspect as an infamous traffic k e r. His phone was
t a p p e d , and he was arrested in front of a London gal-
lery carrying the painting under his arm.
Conforti follows up with the story of 29 p a i n t i n g s
(including a Perugino) that were stolen in 1987
from the municipal picture gallery in Bettona, a
village near Perugia, in central Italy.The investiga-
tion required the participation of law enforcement
o f ficers from six countries on three continents.Th e
trail led them all the way to Kingston, Ja m a i c a ,
where they arrested a former Jamaican senator,
who was sentenced to two years’ hard labour.The
29 paintings suffered no damage.
On the heels of a Van Gogh
The c a r a b i n i e r i also join investigations initiated
on foreign soil.In 1986, an armoured car was robbed
in Dublin. It was carrying 18 paintings belonging to
an Irish collector, including a Ve r m e e r, a Goya and
a Rubens, with an estimated worth of 50 million
pounds sterling ($33.3 million).“That theft,” says
C o n f o r t i ,“once again led us to drug trafficking and
money-laundering circuits in offshore areas such as
Antigua,in the Caribbean,and the Isle of Man,in
Great Britain.” The Turkish police found one of
the paintings in Istanbul in 1990. Their English
counterparts recovered three others, which had
been moved to London.Four—including the Goya
and the Vermeer —were pawned in return for a
loan to a diamond dealer and deposited in a Luxem-
bourg bank.The c a r a b i n i e r i found them while inves-
tigating a money-laundering scheme. Three pain-
tings, including the Rubens, are still missing.
Set up in 1969, the art trafficking squad is the
oldest of its kind in Europe. Its creation was largely
spurred by the scope of looting in a country with tre-
mendous archaeological and artistic wealth. Th e
carabinieri have recorded over 630,000 thefts in
the past 30 years, and their investigations have
For that stolen Ve r m e e r,

Italy was the first country to set up a special police squad to crack down
on art trafficking. Its investigators go as far afield as Jamaica to pursue
art traffickers, and serve as a model across Europe

enabled them to find 180,000 art works and 360,000
archaeological objects.“ Forty percent of the stolen
art works are taken from private collections and
c h u r c h e s,” one police officer explains.“In churches,
paintings are not the only items that are stolen.
Objects from mass are very popular. C o u n t e r f e i t e r s
recycle benches, which are then used to stretch the
canvas of fake paintings. Analyzing the wood is
used as proof that it’s several centuries old.”
The art trafficking squad is growing: its 145-
strong force will soon increase to 185, spread out in
11 cities.“ We ’re neither archaeologists, nor art his-
torians. We’ve had just a few months’ training in
those fields,” says Conforti.“We’re senior investi-
g a t o r s, and we consult with the
cultural affairs ministry when
we need an expert opinion.”
The squad manages the
w o r l d ’s biggest Internet-acces-
sible databank: it includes
1,100,000 stolen art works, of
which 300,000 are outside Ita-
ly’s borders.
Over the past few years,
European countries have
joined the international
UN E S C O and UN I D RO I T
c o n v e n t i o n s, making it easier for police to cooperate
with each other across borders. Italy has often been
held up as an example. France has set up a similar,
although smaller structure, while Spain is poised to
follow suit. Before Great Britain joined the 1970
Convention on March 14, 2001,the issue stirred a
national debate, during which Conforti was invited
to explain his point of view before the House of
Lords—a first for an Italian military officer.
I t a l y ’s example is a model beyond the Euro-
pean Union. “We’ve trained a Hungarian team,”
says one law enforcement offic e r. “ The Iranians
and Palestinians have asked if they can take our
courses. In Bangkok recently, the 11th session of
UN E S C O’s Intergovernmental Restitution and
Return Committee adopted our recommendation
to outlaw Internet auction sales of archaeological
pieces.”
Although it is impossible to count the thefts of
archeological pieces from illegal excavations, their
estimated number is falling in Italy because of
better surveillance methods.“Each year,our police
recover 30,000 items, enough to fill a whole
m u s e u m ,” says the same offic e r.
“But elsewhere, the looting is
getting worse. A r c h a e o l o g i c a l
thieves are setting their sights
on Libya, Lebanon and
Cyprus.”
The c a r a b i n i e r i ’s o p e r a t i o n s
sometimes lead to spectacular
successes when it comes to both
Old Master and modern pain-
t i n g s. It took them just one
month to recover two Va n
Gogh paintings (The Gard e n e r
and Woman from Arles) and a Cézanne (Cabanon
de Jourdain, the last work the artist painted before
his death), which were stolen from the national gal-
lery of modern art in Rome. “We’re not always so
s u c c e s s f u l ,”says Conforti.“I won’t be satisfied until
we find Caravaggio’s Nativity, which was stolen in
Palermo in 1969.We don’t believe the painting has
been destroyed,but we fear it’s in the hands of the
mafia.” ■

“Each year,
our police recover
30,000 items,
enough to fill
a whole museum.”
