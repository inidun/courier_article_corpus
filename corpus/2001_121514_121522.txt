As the sun sets on the sepia-coloured
h o r i z o n ,Ram Pal sits alone to tell his story.
“Let the land open wide and swallow us up.
My nine acres have become unproductive
due to water logging.The fields are full of
wild grass.I have a family of three to feed and a debt of
$1,100 to repay,” laments the 60-year-old farmer from
Kalalwala village in Punjab’s Bhatinda district. N o w
Ram Pal goes to the nearby town every day to work as
a labourer.
Like many farmers, he has been caught in the
vortex of Punjab’s agricultural crisis. Today, many
farmers living in one of India’s richest granaries
are in danger of losing their livelihood as agricultural
lands are slowly turning barren due to farming
practices aimed at increasing yields to meet demand.
Forty years ago, the state embarked on an
agrarian revolution, popularly known as the Green
Revolution (GR), designed to improve harvests. I t
was born out of a dire necessity to provide food
security for the country and reduce dependence
on imports from the We s t , which reached 10 million
tonnes in 1967.As a result of the GR,agricultural
productivity in Punjab grew by around six percent
annually for the next two decades. By the mid-
1980s, wheat and rice yields had trebled.
Rising costs as farmers step up
reliance on chemical fertilizers
U n d o u b t e d l y, the GR made Punjab—where 70
percent of the labour force works in agriculture
and related activities—one of the richest states in
India. Yearly per capita income (at current prices)
rose from $60 in 1980-81 to $440 in 1997-98, well
above the national $240 average.
But there is a flip side to this prosperity. A l w a y s
seeking to boost production, farmers made excessive
use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,altered crop
patterns and overexploited groundwater resources.
Warning bells were sounded early on by M.S.
Swaminathan (see p. 3 6 ) , the eminent scientist who
masterminded the GR. “Irrigation without
arrangements for drainage could result in soils getting
alkaline or saline.Indiscriminate use of pesticides and
herbicides could cause adverse changes in the
biological balance,” he warned the Indian Science
Congress in 1968.
But the warning was not heeded.The soils have
been ravaged,central districts have depleted water
tables while others are waterlogged because of poor

Poverty amidst plenty:

drainage systems and heavy monsoons. Th o u g h
there have been no official reports indicating mass
rural exodus or decline in overall food yield in the
state, recent studies have revealed that the growth
rate in productivity has declined in most areas.
“ The GR was a reductionist strategy,not a total
s t r a t e g y,”says Pramod Ku m a r,director of the
Punjabi-based Institute for Development
and Communication. “It was more a grain
revolution than a green revolution. I t s
unsustainable policies have led to the poverty
of soil and the people.I call it the poverty of
p r o s p e r i t y.”
According to an official report,
dependence on chemical fertilizers, w h i c h
increased from 5,000 tonnes in 1960-61 to 1.3
million in 1998-99, has led to severe
micronutrient defic i e n cy in the soil.
F u r t h e r m o r e, in the absence of adequate
organic matter, soil organisms such as
b a c t e r i a , fungi and earthworms have been
reduced in number or lost altogether,n o t e s
the study.
“Since the soil has lost its natural capacity to
nourish the crops, we have to keep on adding
f e r t i l i z e r s. N a t u r a l l y, the cost of production is going
u p,” says Jitender Pal Singh, a farmer in Ropar
d i s t r i c t .The cost of producing one tonne of wheat rose
from $30 in 1984-85 to $80 in 1997-98,almost a three
fold increase in 12 years.

Too much of a good thing: irrigation in central Punjab.

crops like maize and pulses to wheat and rice
cultivation led to increased demand for groundwater.
“ Farmers sow paddy [rice] in the summer month of
May to meet a September 1 deadline set by the
government to procure paddy at a pre-fixed price.B u t
during the summer, crops need excess water, w h i c h
upsets the water table,” says S. P. M i t t a l , p r i n c i p a l
scientist at the Central Soil and Water Conservation
Research Centre in Chandigarh, the Punjabi capital.
Because of over- e x t r a c t i o n , the water table has
declined by one to three metres in more than 75
percent of the state.
At the same time, poor drainage systems and
the monsoons have led to waterlogging in the fie l d s.
A 1999 report estimates that agricultural lands
equivalent to a 2,350-square kilometre area in Punjab
have been affected. Once a field is waterlogged,
farmers have no other choice but to stop cultivation.
Many are forced to migrate to nearby towns for odd
jobs or wait for government help until the land
regains its fertility several years later.
An estimated 1.5 million hectares of land
already face various types of soil degradation. If this

trend continues, average yields per hectare are
expected to decrease, while reliance on fertilizers
will continue to push up production costs. Th e
situation is a deathknell for small farmers,who own
more than half of Punjab’s 1.2 million farms.
Ecological devastation and socio-economic
problems go hand in hand. Studies reveal that a
majority of farmers in Punjab take out short-term
loans at high interest rates to continue production.A
1999 Punjab University study found that
indebtedness among farmers has pushed up suicides
fourfold in ten years, while the rate in the rest of the
country is declining.
As the state’s agricultural crisis worsens,
solutions have been put forward.One of the most
urgent steps is to explore how certain regions could
be desalinated,says the noted scientist S.K.Sinha,
of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research
( I CA R ) .He also advocates policies that would give
farmers the incentive to shift to organic farming,
cultivate integrated soil healthcare systems involving
the use of green manure and reduce dependence on
water-consuming crops. ■
