R a c ke t e e rs are trying to make a pro fit out of couples in rich countries who want 
to adopt orphan children from the developing world. Tw e n t y - five nations have
now agreed to follow a code of conduct governing international adoption
n
T h e y ’re in love .They live comfort a b l y
somewhere in the “ first wo r l d ” . O n e
d ay, they decide to have children. But the
months and ye a rs go by without any “ h a p p y
e ve n t ” . In the end, they go to a fert i l i t y
e x p e rt .But fertility treatment doesn’t alway s
work and eventually becomes ve ry distressing
for the couple, who feel wounded because
they can’t fulfil their reproductive instincts.
As they become more and more deeply
involved in medical treatment, the idea of
adopting a child takes root.Why not open
their lives to an unloved baby or youngster
who has been abandoned and dumped in an
orphanage? After all,the couple has lots of
love to give and the means to bring up a
family.
Since contraception became common
and abortion tolerated in the world’s rich
c o u n t ri e s , abandoned children, young or
o l d e r ,h ave become few and far betwe e n .A t
the same time, m a ny more people, b o t h
couples and single persons, are seeking to
a d o p t . As a result, adoption of children
from poor countries by couples from the
N o rth has soared over the past 20 ye a rs
(see box).
Long and tricky
negotiations
With few exceptions, the process of
adopting a foreign baby is a long and
complex one, i nvolving talks with social
wo r k e rs ,d o c t o rs and psychiat ri s t s. A lot of
p a p e r work has to be done before consent is
given. In most cases, the process is just as
c o m p l i c ated in the child’s country of ori gi n ,
and the rules vary widely from country to
c o u n t ry. “ I t ’s like an obstacle race,” s ay
parents who have been through it.
Yet scandals regularly come to light,
mainly because dubious go-betweens in
some poor countries take advantage of the
rising demand for adopted children to relieve
we a l t hy couples, tired of waiting for offspri n g
of their ow n , of huge sums, sometimes as
much as $60,000. Wo rst of all, t h e s e
r a c k e t e e rs manage to trick needy mothers
into parting with their biological children.
The case of young Pablo in Guatemala
helped to raise international concern. He
spent the first year of his life in an orp h a n a g e
while his fate provoked a legal battle. His
n atural mother, 3 0 - year-old Elvira Ramirez
C a ñ o, had gi ven her written consent for
his adoption by a Spanish couple. But she
claimed she had signed some kind of
document in a moment of distress eve n
before the child was born , because her
husband had left her when he found out she
was pregnant.
The Spanish couple’s lawyer paid her
m o ne y. But Guatemalan law allows a mother
to renege on such an agr e e m e n t , and with the
backing of a charitable assoc i at i o n , C a z a
Alianza,Elvira managed to get baby Pablo P

back in August 1998, not long after his firs t
b i rt h d ay. This was the first time a
G u atemalan court had ever returned a child
to its natural mother after a dubious
adoption.
“The Pablo affair shows the kind of
pressures and manoeuvres that are typical
of law ye rs and people paid to find babies for
a d o p t i o n .They always go for mothers who
are poor and illiterat e ,” s ay officials of Caza
A l i a n z a , whose law ye rs are handling the
cases of 17 other such mothers. T h e
a s s o c i ation reckons that about 440 children
h ave been fraudulently adopted in
G u atemala since 1996, a year which saw the
end of a 36-year civil war in which more
than 100,000 people died.
Guatemala,
a crackdown on racketeers
Not many countries have such simple
adoption procedures as this poor Central
A m e rican stat e . A notary obtains the
consent of one or other of the child’s
b i o l o gical parents, and then law ye rs acting
for the adoptive parents present this
document and a social report to a juvenile
c o u rt judge who decides whether or not
the adoption can go ahead. In the case of
o rphans and abandoned children, the judge
has to certify first that their parents have
vanished or are unknown. In each case, a
lawyer is necessary.
So Guatemala has become a favourite
d e s t i n ation of  We s t e rn couples looking 
for a foreign child to adopt.The number 
of requests received rose from 900 in 
1996 to 2,304 in 1997,most of them from
A m e ri c a n s ,French and Canadians. O f fic i a l s
in all three countries have stepped up their
wa rnings about the risks of adopting
Guatemalan children.
“Lawyers seem to be in collusion with
d o c t o rs , n u rses and social wo r k e rs who
pressure mothers to let go of their children.
They are then placed with foster mothers
k n own to the law ye rs in ‘ c l a n d e s t i n e
o rp h a n a g e s ’ ,” s ays the Intern at i o n a l
Adoption Mission, France’s official body
responsible for monitoring the arri val of
adopted children in France.
Compulsory
DNA tests
The Canadian consulate in Guat e m a l a
City has uncovered another racket, e ve n
wo rs e .S e veral mothers who gave adoption
consent to a judge were found not to be
“ t h e i r ” c h i l d ’s natural mother after
undergoing DNA tests. The babies had
been taken from their real mothers at birt h
in the countryside by women who we r e
paid to say it was they who had given birth
to them.
Canada now requires DNA tests to be
Open arms for a child with 
an uncertain future.
Lawyers seem to be in
collusion with doctors,
nurses and social workers
who pressure mothers to let
go of their children. They
are then placed with foster
mothers known to the
lawyers in ‘clandestine
orphanages’

carried out by accredited doctors on the
m o t h e rs of all adopted babies from
G u atemala before the children are allowe d
into the country. The United Stat e s
announced in October 1998 that it would
do the same.The Guatemalan authorities
h ave called on local judges to be more
v i gilant until stricter legi s l ation is passed by
parliament.
In Brazil, where rules for foreigners
adopting children are very strict on paper,
94 women demonstrate regularly in the
t own of Jundiai, near São Pa u l o.A p a rt from
the fact that they are all poor,they have all
had their children taken away from them by
a judge who sent them to a centre which
works hand in glove with an Italian adoption
o r g a n i z at i o n . An enquiry is going on. I n
Viet Nam, t a x i - d ri ve rs , hotel managers and
travel agents openly offer, illegally and for
m o n e y, “ g u i d a n c e ” for We s t e rn parents
seeking to adopt.
Scandals like these, and others that
came to light in Eastern Europe, A f ri c a
and A s i a , helped to convince the
international community of the need for a
legal instrument to establish principles for
i n t e r c o u n t ry adoption.The Convention on
the Protection of Children and Co-
o p e r ation in Respect of Intercountry
Adoption was signed in The Hague in 1993
and came into effect two years later.
Respect 
for the child’s origins
The Convention bans any “ i m p r o p e r
financial or other gain” and “the abduction,
the sale of, or traffic in children” and obliges
each signat o ry state to establish maximum
safeguards to prevent it. So fa r , 21 countri e s
h ave ratified the Conve n t i o n ,1 i n c l u d i n g
Colombia, France and Australia in 1998,
and four others have acceded to it.
In practice,anyone wanting to adopt a
child must make a formal applicat i o n ,e i t h e r
directly or through an NGO of their choice,
to the “central authori t y ” of their ow n
c o u n t ry, which will send the request to the
central authority of the country in which the
applicants wish to adopt a child. T h i s
measure has already reduced the number of
clandestine adoptions between contracting
countries. Before the request is sent to the
foreign country, the adopting country is

required to check whether the prospective
parents are “eligible and suited to adopt”
according to the laws and procedures of
both countries involved.
The convention also forbids any
“contact between the prospective adoptive
parents and the child’s parents” until all
the requirements have been met. T h e
authorities of the child’s country of origin
must ensure that the consent of the
b i o l o gical mother (and father if he is
identified) has been “freely given”and has
“not been induced by payment or
compensation of any kind.”
The convention also stipulat e s — l i k e
the 1989 United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child—that foreigners can
only adopt a child if foster parents have
not been found in its own country and if
it is “in the best interests of the child”,
whose origins must be respected as far as
possible.
In the same spiri t , s e veral countri e s
require foreign prospective parents, or the
social services of the adopting country, to
make regular reports on the child’s progr e s s
to its country of ori gi n . This “ f o l l ow - u p
p e ri o d ” is 10 ye a rs in the case of Sri Lanka,
four for Pe ru , three for Pa r a g u ay and two for
Romania.
The gr owth of intercountry adoption
has often led to more child adoptions within
the country of ori gi n . In Pe ru , t h e
a u t h o rities have mounted local media
campaigns to ensure that abandoned
children are “ o f f e r e d ” for adoption to
Peruvian couples as a first choice. “Many
mothers come to us because they want to
gi ve up a child they can no longer afford to
b ring up,” s ays a Pe ruvian adoption offic i a l
who asked not to be named.“We do all we
can to dissuade them and help them. But
h e r e , as eve rywhere else, the first thing to do
is to stem the tide of poverty.” n

‘Many mothers come to us because they want 
to give up a child they can no longer afford to bring up.
We do all we can to dissuade them and help them.
But here, as everywhere else, the first thing to do 
is to stem the tide of poverty’
1.The Convention so far includes 15 countries
where children are sought for adoption (Burkina
Faso, Cyprus, Colombia,Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Paraguay, Peru, the
Philippines, Poland,Romania, Sri Lanka and
Venezuela) and 10 countries whose nationals
adopt them (Andorra,Australia,Canada,
Denmark, Spain,France, Finland,Norway, the
Netherlands and Sweden).
