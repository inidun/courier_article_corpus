In defence of Durban:
racism is back on the agenda
“Total fiasco,” “a congregation of the converted,” “a lot of hot air”—the media’s verdict on the Durban
conference against racism was a harsh one. It was also unfair, says Pierre Sané, who led UNESCO’s
delegation

governments have denied the existence
of racism in the world,and particularly in
their own societies. Despite this, a world
conference against racism, r a c i a l
discrimination,xenophobia and related
intolerance in Durban, South A f r i c a ,
( Au g. 3 1 - S e p t . 7) managed to draw
delegations from 170 c o u n t r i e s. It was
an extraordinary admission by those who
took part that racism exists in all societies.
The job of the conference was to
point to new kinds of racism1 that today
affect immigrant workers, a s y l u m -
s e e k e r s, r e f u g e e s, displaced people, t h o s e
with HIV/AIDS and others. It was also
intended to denounce moves towards
“genetic discrimination,” for example
when a firm asks a future employee for
his or her genetic imprint with the excuse
of looking for possible“abnormalities.”

up to date on all these points.
These kinds of political gatherings
invariably give rise to trials of strength,
and there are failings. The final
documents in Durban do not mention

affected by discrimination—South

u n t o u c h a b l e s. Neither was there
mention of black people living in Arab
countries, nor of the Palestinians.
Putting faces
on the victims
But many “ i n v i s i b l e ” victims did
show their faces to the world at the
c o n f e r e n c e. Seemingly trivial but really
very telling was a delegation of
“ P y g m i e s,” who came to publicize for
the first time at a world conference the
threats to their society from war in
Central A f r i c a .Afro-Latins—people of
African origin from Colombia and
Venezuela—also spoke of their
suffering.
The presence of delegations of
R o m s, G y p s i e s, Sindis and other
travelling people—all victims of a
racism ignored by the international
c o m m u n i t y—were able through their
links with NGOs to have their say in the
c o n f e r e n c e ’s final declaration and action
plan. Many other victims were clearly
i d e n t i fie d . Now it is up to governments
to do something about them.This was a
s i g n i ficant achievement for the con-
ference.
Some critics have singled out the
“catch-all”nature of the gathering and
claimed that it was submerged by
disputes of “questionable relevance”—
arguments about whether reparations
should be made for slavery, or whether
Israel should be condemned on the
grounds that Zionism is racist.
The task of the conference was to
list the causes of racism, and slavery was
seen in this context.The slave trade and
colonialism were probably legitimized
by racism and in turn encouraged it.
They were denounced in these terms.
And for the first time, the international
community recognized that slavery and
the slave trade were “appalling tragedies
in the history of humanity” and that
they formed a “crime against humanity.”
All this is only a start. UNESCO, for
e x a m p l e,argues that people have a duty
to remember the past and is calling for
scholars to be allowed access to all
records so that the extent and effect of
the slave trade can be conclusively
a s s e s s e d . It is also asking that school
textbooks reflect the importance of this
tragedy and its criminal nature.
Hidden guilt
The conference had no brief to work
out details relating to the controversial
issue of compensation for slavery during
its 10-day session. But it carried out its
job by making a declaration of principle
over the “moral obligation” to pay
financial compensation for wrongs
committed,and for me that is stronger
than a “legal obligation.”
Giving the status of victims to
Africans, who were the objects of this
t r a d e, finally enables their descendants
to lift their heads high, while allowing
the descendants of those who
committed the crime to end their
s i l e n c e. I have always regarded
development aid as the unhealthy
product of a secret feeling of guilt.Wi t h
the crime recognized for what it is, s u c h
aid can be replaced by fair
compensation that will put the parties
involved on an equal footing.
Some people think the Palestinian
issue was intrusive, but it was inevitably
going to come up in Durban at a
conference organized by the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights. For
delegations from Arab and Muslim
c o u n t r i e s, the issue is one of human
r i g h t s, discrimination (some Israeli laws
discriminate in this way), v i o l e n c e
against a people and violation of the
right to self-determination. It is in the
news and had to be raised,as apartheid
was in its day.
The United States and Israel, who
were against allowing the issue onto the
a g e n d a , withdrew from the conference.
But the agenda was democratically
drawn up by all the working groups. If a
topic appeared relevant to the aim of the
c o n f e r e n c e, they could decide to include
it for discussion. They did so, and the
final conference declaration expressed
“deep concern” over “the increase in
anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in
various parts of the world,” w h i l e
emphatically rejecting any equivalence
between Zionism and racism.
A moral
re-armament
Can we trust the countries that
promised the conference they would
fight racism? The first test will be
whether they come up with national
plans to do so, along with a budget,
identification of perpetrators and
victims, legislation and a timetable for
a c t i o n .They have said they will.To help
t h e m , the conference has drawn up a list
of “best practices,” such as banning all
kinds of discrimination in the workplace
and in housing, devising ways to
measure progress in education  by the
most disadvantaged groups, a n d
assuring that those who file complaints
about racism (especially concerning the
police) are protected.
All this might seem wishful thinking.
But all world conferences—Rio on the
environment and Beijing on women’s
rights—have ended the same way,
namely with a declaration and a plan of

action that is not binding but which is
based on existing conventions and law.
The aim of such gatherings is to get
countries to re-commit themselves—a
kind of moral re-armament—towards
working together to solve a problem
that depends on international
c o o p e r a t i o n . Nobody forces
governments to take part in these events.
But the fact that negotiations over the
final declaration were so tough shows
exactly how important countries thought
it was. By signing that declaration,they
pledged their word and their credibility,
and agreed to make regular reports on
how their promises were being put into
e f f e c t . Everything also depends on how
far civil society—the 1,000 NGOs who
attended the conference—get involved.
When they get back home, they can say
to their government: “ Yo u ’ve signed.
Where’s your action plan?”
Some people accused these NGOs
o f going to extremes in Durban, t o
t h e point of stifling debate. But there
was plenty of impassioned argument
a t the conference. It was only natural
f o r associations supporting murdered
victims to lose patience with the
“ r e a l i s m ” espoused by governments. S o
the debates were very lively, but not
violent.
The conference put the fight against
racism on the agendas of all NGOs.
Governments have made progress too
by joining a democratic debate
ultimately aimed at the shared
management of global society. Durban
was worth it. ■
