The world's great mountain
ranges such as the Andes, the
Alps, the Himalayas and the
highlands of Madagascar and
Ethiopia are not as solid as they
look. Back in 1973, a report pro¬
duced by Unesco's Man and the
Biosphere Programme (MAB)
acknowledged just how fragile they
really are. "Mountain areas in dif¬
ferent parts of the world are at very
different levels of influence by man's
activities," the report points out.
"Generally speaking though, man's
impacts on mountain ecosystems
are producing critical situations at
a faster rate than in many other
types of ecosystems. The inclina¬
tion of the slopes accelerates and
aggravates all processes of site
destruction such as erosion and
landslides. Site restoration is much
more difficult than in lowlands.
Mountain ecosystems must there¬
fore be treated in an especially
careful way."
Some 10 per cent of the world's
population lives in mountain areas,
but at least halfofhumanity depends
more or less directly on the resources
they provide in the shape of water,
energy, minerals, forests or recre¬
ational areas. This is one of the rea¬
sons why the United Nations Con¬
ference on Environment and
Development (UNCED), held in Rio
de Janeiro in 1992, devoted chapter
13 of its Agenda 21 to developing
mountain ecosystems.
"Mountain" is used here in the
broad sense to cover all areas higher
than 900 metres above sea level, a
zone representing one-quarter of
the world's land surface. "We are
dealing with maximum global
diversity from sea level to almost
9,000 metres, from tropical rain¬
forest to permanent ice and snow,
and from climates with over 12
metres of annual precipitation to
extreme high-altitude deserts,"
writes Peter B. Stone in his preface
to a remarkable collective work enti¬
tled The State ofthe World's Moun¬
tains (1992) of which he is the
editor-in-chief.
H0TSP0T AREAS
It should come as no surprise that 40
per cent of the world's biosphere
reserves are to be found in moun¬
tain regions and that half of the
"hotspot areas" are located in the
tropics, in such regions as the
uplands ofMadagascar, the slopes of
the Andes in westernAmazonia, the
eastern Himalayas, the Philippines
highlands, the mountain forests of
the eastern rift in Tanzania, India's
Western Ghats and the montane
forests of Sri Lanka. Although in
absolute terms there are fewer plant
species in mountain regions than in
lowland areas, endemic species in
danger of disappearing tend to be
found in these regions. In Sabah, in
Malaysia, for example, Mount Kina-
balu is home to 4,000 to 4,500 plant
species, more than one-quarter the
number of all recorded species in
the United States. Nor should we
forget that potatoes, coffee, wheat,
maize and numerous varieties of

fruit trees all originally came from
the mountain areas of the different
continents.
Mountains also supply us with
water. The rivers flowing down from
the Himalaya, Karakorum, Pamir
and Tibet ranges, fed by melting
snow which the forests regulate and
slow down, are the economic
lifeblood of the areas they cross. If
the forest cover were to be depleted,
the snow would melt more quickly
and would give rise to water short¬
ages in the dry season. In South
America, deforestation in the Andes
is liable to have an adverse impact
on the whole of the Amazon basin
and could cause severe flooding.
The same is true in Africa, where
the rivers rising on Mount Kenya
provide arteries for entire civiliza¬
tions. Mountains also have an influ¬
ence on climate and on both local
and continental air- current pat¬
terns. The temperature falls by
0.5°C to 1°C for every 100-metre
rise in altitude, because the air is
thinner and absorbs less of the sun's
heat. Precipitation increases with
altitude, and hence such regions
are blessed with rainfall. This is true
of the North American Rockies, the
Andes in South America and the
Himalayas in northern India. Were
it not for the mountain formations
of the Maghreb, the Sahara would
soon extend right up to the Mediter¬
ranean seaboard.

DANS: FOR AND AGAINST
Advantage is often taken of these
abundant water resources to build
dams. A study carried out by the
International Commission on Large
Dams (ICOLD) shows that the go-
ahead is given each year for the con¬
struction of some 300 large dams
(measuring 15 metres and upwards
in height) and that work is actually
started on roughly the same
number. Nearly 3,000 dams are
expected to be built world-wide
between 1991 and 2001. The sur¬
face area of the catchments they
will create will cover 1.5 million
square kilometres, representing an
area the size of Spain, France and
Germany combined. Mountain
dwellers can have a very different
view of dams from people living in
low-lying downstream areas, who
look forward to having electricity,
being protected from the destruc¬
tion caused by flooding and
enjoying the benefits of irrigation
(even though they may be deprived
of the fertile silt that used to be
deposited by the river before the
dam was built). People living in
upstream areas often resent man-
made lakes because of the bitter
experience of being forced out of
their homes, the swallowing-up of
plant and wildlife and even out¬
breaks of water-borne diseases. In
any event, they are not asked for
their opinion and there is very little
prospect of their being given a
hearing. In any case, is there really
any justification for halting devel¬
opment for the sake of saving a
flower or a rodent from extinction?
People remote from the seat of
powerwith no means ofrepresenta¬
tion often belong to ethnic minori¬
ties. They are left out of the main¬
stream as far as progress and
affluence are concerned and do not
even have any say in decisions
affecting them. Although they are
the custodians of their cultural values
and traditions, they are exposed to all
sorts ofpressures. Their ownership of
the land may be disputed in cases
where it is occupied by migrant
squatters who have been forced out
of lowland areas and who do not
necessarily share the uplanders' cui¬
tare and can do onlyunskilled work.
Their state of health and their diet
may be poor. Teaching is frequenüy
of a low standard and there may be
no schools in the vicinity. The people
may find it difficult to market the
produce they grow apart from the
plants used in making narcotic
drugs, ofcourse. At times ofconflict,
mountain areas invariably become
places ofrefuge for rebels, and there
are instances on every continent
where they form the borders between
states that are not always on good
terms. By contrast, mountain regions
like the Alps have become one big
playground, crisscrossed by roads
and tunnels, with chair-lifts dis¬
gorging hordes of tourists, whether
sports-lovers or not, all year round.
WORKING WITH LOCAL
POPULATIONS
Experience has shown that it is
imperative for local populations to
be involved in all development pro¬
jects. Between 1979 and 1986 Thai¬
land learnt this to its cost, when the
government set out to develop
farming in the north of the country.
As Professor Kenneth N. Brooks, of
the University of Minnesota, in the
United States, put it in a documenthe
prepared for the United Nations Food
andAgriculture Organization in 1993:
36 I
Peruvian villagers
of the high Andes.
"The main goal of the project was to
sufficiently intensifyagricultural pro¬
duction to enable shifting cultivators
to settle on lands ofslopes less than 35
per cent, thereby enabling steeper,
more fragile lands to be reforested.
This was to be achieved by (1) the
development of irrigated and rainfed
terraces; (2) promotion of Arabica
coffee and legumes as cash crops.
(3) reforestation of lands with slopes
exceeding 35 per cent. The project
encountered several problems which
may be attributed to the failure to
involve the local Karen in the plan¬
ning process."
Conflict arose because the gov¬
ernment had not taken the trouble
to study the traditional land own¬
ership practices of the Karen ethnic
minority which had a different legal
status from that in the rest of the
country. Still more serious was the
fact that, in an earlier project, a large
number of farmers had been
encouraged to grow Arabica, but
this had turned out to be a failure.
Had they been consulted, some
other type of crop might have been
contemplated. On the other hand,
the community itself indicated the
most suitable sites for building ter¬
races, and this operation proved
more successful than expected. This
example illustrates the insecure
status of mountain dwellers, who
are treated like social outcasts in
most countries. How can we blame
them for the deforestation that is
the blight of mountain areas when
they do not know where to turn for
other resources? It would be like
blaming them for being poor.
Poor as they are, mountain
people often have an aura of mys¬
tery about them. Situated at the
meeting-point between heaven and
earth, mountains are the abode of
the gods. Every civilization and
every religion has its sacred moun¬
tain, like the mountain-temples of
Angkor, Mount Olympus in Greece
and the monumental stupa of
Borobudur. Is this not an added cul¬
tural reason for taking good care of
our mountains?
