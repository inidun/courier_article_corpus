The body j i g s a w
Imagine the body as a canvas, a space to mix and match physical
and cultural elements in defining who or what you want to be.
Here lies the great paradox. The scarring and piercing of tribal aesthetics
are all the rage in rich countries, while in the South, western ideals
are coveted by a monied few
1 . S H ATTERED IDEALS
I
n 1976, the punks barged into the lives of the
reserved British with a bang. Disrespect was
their word of order,as they went about ranting
against the predictable world mapped out by
their elders. They insulted the Queen and
heaped abuse on nuclear energy, the economy,
p o l l u t i o n , work and the media.
For even greater shock value, they tapped the
power of the image. They spat on staid English
conventions by donning a revolting, yet carefully
studied appearance. A skirt could no longer be
called a skirt, and punks gleefully paraded in torn,
stained and gaudy clothes,marrying colours against
all the cannons of good taste.
They cut their hair into crests,
horns and other shapes,
plastered themselves with lurid
make-up and wore chains.
They covered their arms, f a c e s,
necks and heads with tattoos,
reinvented piercing using
safety-pins, studs and rings in
their noses, eyebrows, lips and
cheeks, and went so far as to
deliberately scar themselves.
With their altered, r e b e l
bodies, the punks quickly gave birth to a charged
s e l f - i m a g e. Their very own promoters conspired
with the media they despised and turned them into
symbols of decadence,before exporting their bodily
aesthetics throughout Europe, North America and
Japan.
N o w, a quarter of a century later, the punks
have spawned a loyal following. Top models,
sporting personalities, singers and show-business
stars jostle to display original hairstyles and body
piercings. In rich countries, teenage girls show off
their navel rings and stick out their bejewelled
tongues, while boys wear rings in their eyebrows.
Tw e n t y - five years on, the socially-scorned practices
of piercing or altering one’s body have become
musts for counting on the fashion scene. Yo u n g
westerners have appropriated once “ u n d e r g r o u n d ”
practices to gain entry into the trendy but ultimately
mainstream club.
There is, h o w e v e r, a paradox in all this. O n e
would expect originality and innovation. In fact,
what we are witnessing is a sweeping trend of
cultural mix and match,drawing on body-altering
techniques long used by non-western cultures for
purposes of religion, aesthetics or identity. Th e
American artist Fakir Musafar  coined the term
“modern primitives,” giving rise to a new ideal, a
patchwork that “tribalizes”the western body. For
the past 50 years, he has explored alternative forms
of spirituality incorporating primitive body
decoration and rituals.
How did these alternative ways of changing the
body travel so far afield? What drives young
westerners to have tattoos from the South Sea
islands or Japan? What do these “ t r i b a l ” o r
“ p r i m i t i v e ” markings and
decorations mean in a western
society?
Certainly not a return to
the rituals that originally
produced them: most of those
who go for such adornments
know nothing about these
distant practices. M o r e o v e r,
the bodies now being used as
models were those that were
stigmatized and displayed
during colonial exhibitions in
Europe and the United States right up to the early
20th century.They were curiosity objects and more
s i g n i f i c a n t l y, living symbols of the supposed
“ b a c k w a r d n e s s ” of the colonized peoples. S e e n
through European eyes, piercing, body scars and
elongated lips, necks and ears were evidence of
“barbarism,” justifying the West’s self-appointed
duty to civilize. Such practices incarnated the
opposite of the ideal “civilized”body.
By way of homage to the civilizations the
colonial powers seemingly sought to stamp out,
the vanguard of the “modern primitives” set out to
investigate these body rituals.The “tribal aesthetics”
of Maria Ta s h j i a n , who owns a chain of body-
alteration shops in the United States, is vaunted as
a way to educate people by preserving the memory
of extinct cultures and passing on their idea of
What do these “ t r i b a l ”o r
“ p r i m i t i v e ” markings and
d e c o rations mean in a 
western society? What drives
w e s t e r n e rs to have tattoos
f rom the South Sea islands?

beauty. Through piercing, stretching the ear-lobe
and body scarring, we can thus create a jigsaw of
ancient and modern aesthetics.
Others such as Musafar see these practices as
the chance to work on one’s own profound sense of
S e l f. “Body play,” in his words, consists of
experimenting with every known body-alteration
t e c h n i q u e.By willingly going through the initiation
ordeals of traditional societies, one actually re-
lives a primal experience that has long been
forgotten in the industrialized world.It is the path
towards rediscovering an original innocence.
Forget about 
those blonde surfers
Wh a t ’s important is not the markings left on the
b o d y, says Musafar. I n s t e a d , what matters is the
confrontation with physical pain that takes one
toward another plane of consciousness, shunned in
western societies where all is done to combat
s u f f e r i n g. But unlike the physical and symbolic
violence of initiation rites in traditional societies,
these bodily alterations are the fruit of a conscious
personal choice.
Such discourse, however, will be rarely heard
among the millions of people who flirt with body
decorating.The vast majority are merely fulfilling
the modern-day desire for self-knowledge and
recognition from others. They might invoke
aesthetics, spirituality, sex games or the desire to
belong to a group, but whatever the reason, t h e
process of altering the body and putting it to the test
comes down to playing with identity.This reflects a
profound cultural shift.
The urge to assert oneself goes hand in hand
with a desire to challenge social norms and values,
and to advocate different ways of experiencing,
feeling and displaying one’s body. Many fans of
body-art, piercing and tattooing say they can no
longer accept the western model of a sanitized,
bland,alienated body.
The ideals of the blue-eyed blonde and the
Californian surfer with the sleek and muscular
bronzed body have to go. In this light, a l t e r i n g
one’s body becomes a battle against conventional

d e m a n d s, constructing an appearance becomes the
royal road to upsetting normality. E v e r y o n e
becomes an actor,capable of displaying their body
in a unique way. Rather than sinking into the
c r o w d , they spark a chain of reactions (grounded or
not), from attraction and fascination to rejection
and fear.
The refusal to comply with social norms, the
awareness that looking different has an impact,is
all part of a battle against creeping standardization.
In this light,such a philosophy stands at opposite
ends from the promise of cosmetic surgery,diets and
the like.
Television and the Internet are giving play to all
these trends. Day after day, we are exposed to a
million ways of perceiving the body, culled from
past and present, from the imagination and real
experiments. Such depictions remind us that the
body is not about a static anatomy, and that there
is more than one way to signal membership to a
g r o u p.They also remind us that culture is always on
the move.What is exotic one day is undesirable the
next and rediscovered later. The globalization of
images has spawned multiple models of the
“ c i v i l i z e d ” b o d y, breaking with the western
standard-bearer.

United States go for breast implants, lighten their
skin and bleach their hair. In southern Africa and
among African A m e r i c a n s, skin-lighteners and hair-
straightening products are all the rage.The famed
s a p e u r s of Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, make enormous sacrifices to keep up with
what they see as the latest in Parisian chic.C o s m e t i c
surgery is as popular in the U. S. as in South
A m e r i c a , where women have operations that bring
them eerily close to the Barbie doll ideal.In Asia,
they ask surgeons to attenuate the “slant”of their
e y e s.… Does a perceived or real context of political
and economic domination lead some to hide their
s p e c i fic features? “ We s t e r n i z i n g ” the human body
reads like a strategy to fit in with globalization.
For now, creating a hybrid ideal of the body is
a game for the privileged.Among the poor, only a
minority is going about removing the stigmas they
have historically borne. But popularizing this new
ideal is stirring debate. By hijacking appearance
codes and adopting body-altering techniques that
were originally designed for medical purposes,
people are carving in flesh the rules of a new game.
Their efforts will likely herald an all-round
deemed otherwise insignificant.
To this end,it’s not enough to go shopping for
t r a d i t i o n s. Piecing together a body can also be
d o n e using modern materials, knowledge and
t e c h n i q u e s. By inserting foreign objects under
t h e i r s k i n , some body artists are creating
protuberances on foreheads, breastbones and
forearms to radically challenge age-old perceptions
of the physical self.
A battle against
creeping standardization
All these interventions can be seen as a quest to
escape a destiny spelt out in terms of sex,age and
social origin. In this sense, they have political
i m p l i c a t i o n s. By shattering models, rejecting beauty
standards circulated in the mass media and asserting
the right to do, wear and display what they see fit,
this avant-garde is holding up the body as one of the
last bastions where individual freedom can be
expressed.
