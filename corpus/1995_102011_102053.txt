The European
Environment Agency
The European Environment Agency was created in
1990 and became operational in 1993 when its head-
quarters were established in Copenhagen (Denmark).
It is funded by the European Commission and by con-
tributions from non-member states of the European
Union such as Norway and Iceland. Although an off-
shoot of the European Commission, it operates inde-
pendently, collecting information and distributing it
upon request to the general public and to a network of
"Topic Centres"-public or private member-state insti-
tutions concerned with the environment. Its first pro-
ject was to develop and co-ordinate the European Envi-.
ronment Information and Observation Network
(EIONET), to which more than 450 institutions belong.
The Agency's Multiannual work programme (1995-
1999) comprises 93 projects. They give priority to areas
such as air quality and atmospheric emissions ; water
quality ; water pollutants and water resources ; the state
of the soil, of fauna and flora and biotopes ; land use
and natural resources use ; waste management ; noise
emissions ; chemical substances hazardous to the envi-
ronment ; and coastal protection.
Five Topic Centres are already acting as lead orga-
nizations for work in these priority areas. The Air Emis-
sions project, for example, is being headed by the
Umweltbundesamt in Berlin, and the Nature Conser-
vation project by the Museum Nationale d'Histoire
Naturelle of Paris.
The Agency publishes a series of documents (mainly
free of charge), including a monthly newsletter. One of
these documents, Europes EnMronment, the Dobris
Assessment, published in 1994, is particularly remark-
able. Illustrated with photos and diagrams, it presents
in less than twenty pages a summary including some
memorable figures. For example, two-thirds of Euro-
peans live in urban areas covering 1 per cent of the total
land area. A city of a million inhabitants consumes a
daily average of 11, 500 tonnes of fossil fuels, 320, 000
tonnes of water and 2, 000 tonnes of food and produces
25, 000 tonnes of C02 1, 600 tonnes of solid waste and
300, 00 tonnes of wastewater. Tourism is one of
Europe's most important social and economic activities :
the coastal Mediterranean received 157 million tourists
in 1990, and 100 million tourists visit the Alps each
year.
