S
ome people have alleged that the crimes of the
Pinochet dictatorship in Chile should not be
punished because pouring salt into this open
wo u n d , establishing the truth and obtaining justice
would destabilize democracy and endanger so-
called social peace.
But all efforts to stifle memory have fa i l e d .T h e
arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London on October
16, 1998 revealed how fragile the Chilean demo-
c r atic system is and showed the true face of a
c o u n t ry which cannot face up to a period of its
h i s t o ry which continues to divide Chileans into
two irreconcilable camps.
The systematic cover-up of the dictatorship’s
c rimes began on the day of the military coup d’état
against President Salvador Allende in 1973. But

A n unwritten page of history

from the start of the repression, human rights orga-
n i z ations and groups of victims’ families tried to fin d
out the tru t h . They all worked together to bu i l d
this collective memory of the past.After a while, t h e
action of a band of mothers who denounced the
c rimes committed against their loved ones became
the mainspring of the struggle to restore demo-
c r a cy.The main theme of the campaign was “ n e ve r
again”—only the establishment of a nat i o n w i d e
culture of respect for human ri g h t s , a complete
account of what went on and full rights to justice
could ensure that history would not repeat itself.
We were critical of the National Truth and
R e c o n c i l i ation Commission set up at the begi n-
ning of the transition process (see box).Why, we
a s k e d , did its brief only cover those who disap-

peared and leave aside those who were tortured,
forced to flee abroad, a r b i t r a rily arrested or sent into
internal exile?
Most of all, we objected to its decision not to
name those responsible for the cri m e s , which wo u l d
have at least been symbolic justice. And the truth
that the Commission established was only the ver-
sion presented by the victims, their families and
human rights organizat i o n s , since the main cul-
p ri t s , the armed forces, refused to have anything to
do with it.So it was only half the tru t h . A page of our
history is still unwritten.
International solidarity
Yet through the Commission’s bri e f, the gove rn-
ment recognized that the dictatorship had syste-
m atically violated human rights on a massive scale.
This organized remembrance of the recent past
was really an appeal for people to face the future bol-
stered by a determination that such crimes must
never happen again.
Later, fearing the clashes that digging up the
truth and dispensing justice would inevitably pro-
vo k e , the nine-year-old gove rnment coalition passed
measures that removed the issue from the public
arena.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission
and its successor,the Reparations and Reconcilia-
tion Commission, were supposed to have settled the
problem once and for all. But far from recognizing

the ethical, p o l i t i c a l , judicial and social dimensions
of the problem, they reduced it to a search for the
remains of those who disappeared, with the result
that the nation’s ordeal was revived.
P i n o c h e t ’s arrest means the country cannot avo i d
facing the events whose memory, h owe ver painful it
m ay be, we have been fighting to keep alive .I n d e e d ,
over 40 complaints have been made against Pinochet
before a judge which have so far led to the arrest and
t rial of a dozen military offic e rs (see note page 25).
The determination of the complainants, along
with international solidarity, made possible an act
of justice none of us had imagined: the imprison-
ment of Pinochet in a gilded cage. As the former
head of stat e , he is the chief perp e t r ator of what we
regard as crimes against humanity committed under
his rule inside and outside the country.These cri m e s
should be tried by an international tribunal. Since
such a tri bunal is still not functioning, P i n o c h e t
ought to be tried in his own country.
But Chile has neither adequate institutions nor the
political will for that .So far there has been no real move
to repeal the 1978 amnesty law or end the system of
appointed senat o rs.All this means that Chile is a par-
tial and hesitant democracy,unable to guarantee a fa i r
t rial for Pinochet.A l s o,because he is a senator for life,
his parliamentary immunity would have to be lifted
before he could be tri e d . But since he is still a military
o f fic e r , an examining magi s t r ate could declare himself
incompetent to handle the case and might send it to
a military court , which obviously would not be inde-
pendent enough. So Pinochet should be tried in
S p a i n .This would be a big step towards ending impu-
n i t y, and an exe m p l a ry act against the treachery and
t y r a n ny of all dictat o rs h i p s.
Building a collective memory implies know-
ledge of the past and all its consequences. As long
as it is shrouded in the veil of pardon without jus-
tice, we cannot plan a future of peace in a society
reconciled with itself. ■
