D u ring Ramadan last Ja n u a ry, s o m e
of the mosques in Abidjan decided to
b ring forward prayer time. T h i s
thoughtful gesture saved thousands of the
faithful from a painful dilemma—whether
to do their religious duty or miss the latest
episode of Marimar, a Mexican TV melo-
drama which has turned the whole country
into addicts of t e l e n ove l a s, soap operas made
in Latin America.
“At 7.30 sharp in the eve n i n g, w h e n
M a ri m a r comes on, e ve rything stops in
Côte d’Ivo i r e ,” the evening newspaper
I vo i r ’ S o i r noted a few months ago. T h e
p r o gr a m m e , which has attracted more local
fans than the 1998 World Cup, arrived in
A f rica after being a similar hit in Indonesia
and the Philippines. In 1997, its female star
was received in Manila like a foreign head
of state.
M e a n w h i l e , on the other side of the
p l a n e t , hundreds of thousands of Yu g o s l av s
hold their breath so as not to miss the tiniest
detail of the Venezuelan soap opera Kas-
s a n d ra. “ We know Kassandra’s innocent
and we want her trial stopped,” the towns-
people of Kucevo, in southeastern Serbia,
wrote to the Venezuelan government, with
a copy to Serbian President Slobodan Milo-
sevic.This is just one of many examples of
h ow fiction can invade real life and how
far people come to identify with it.
M a ri m a r and K a s s a n d ra are classics
among the thousands of soap operas Latin
America has turned out over the past 40
years at the rate of about 100 a year.They
are love stories which have plenty of sub-
plots and move along at a brisk pace.T h e i r
c h a r a c t e rs overcome countless obstacles—
social class, family ties, c o n flicts of interest
and so on—to finally win through despite all
the ambushes of fat e . In all of them, m o r a-
lity and goodness triumph and the bad guys
get punished in a happy ending where eve-
ryone is reconciled. In this respect they are
ve ry different from Anglo-Saxon soap
Actress Patricia Pillar, heroine of the Brazilian
soap opera Rei do Gado (“The Cattle King”).
C h a rged with suspense and fantasy, Latin American soap operas are pouring 
off the production lines into living rooms all over the world

operas,in which conflicts get solved in the
c o u rse of a few virtually self-contained epi-
sodes, which means they can be broadcast
in any order.
The plot of a Latin American telenovela
includes a strong dose of suspense. Each
episode has a dramatic ending to make sure
v i e we rs watch the next one.This tactic pro-
duced a new way of making some pocket
money when Kassandra was shown in the
B a l k a n s. People in Bulgari a ,where the soap
was running 10 episodes ahead of Yu g o-
slavTV, would tell their neighbours across
the border what was coming up next—in
exchange for 10 dinars ($2).
The worldwide success of these soaps
suggests they might be something more
than just a carefully-engineered collection
of dirty deeds and superficial emotions.
Their hackneyed themes don’t often
amount to anything of great artistic value,
but the scripts aren’t always puerile and
the dialogue and characters are less pre-
dictable than one might expect. Telenovelas
have accumulated 40 years of experience
and professionalism and turned into an
i n d u s t ry which can buy the best actors ,
s c ri p t w ri t e rs and directors in Latin A m e ri c a .
Urban violence and political
corruption
Since the 1970s, p r o d u c e rs have also
tried to go beyond classic melodrama and
h ave adapted the works of wri t e rs like Mari o
B e n e d e t t i , M a rio Vargas Llosa and Jo r g e
Amado. In recent years,authors,directors
and scri p t w ri t e rs in the Latin A m e ri c a n
film industry have brought new life to the
genre by broadening its range of subjects
and bri n ging it closer to real life. T h e s e
“ n e w - wave ” t e l e n ove l a s dig straight into
issues like police corru p t i o n , i n f l u e n c e -
p e d d l i n g, urban violence, impunity and the
role of mafia money,as in last ye a r ’s Colom-
bian production La Mujer del presidente
(“The President’s Wife”) and, the ye a r
b e f o r e , Nada pers o n a l (“Nothing Pe rs o n a l ” ) ,
which was made in Mexico.
Soaps like this have sparked off social
d e velopments which in the past would have
been unthinkable.Ve n e z u e l a ’s Por estas calles
(“Through These Streets”), screened in
1 9 9 2 , was about the decline of a corrupt and
p owerful ru l e r , who reminded many vie-
we rs of President Carlos Andrés Pérez, t h e
c o u n t ry ’s president at the time. A n d r é s
Pérez was caught up in a corruption scandal
which drove him from office two ye a rs lat e r
“because of this soap among other rea-
sons,” says its producer,Alberto Giarroco.
In Brazil, O Salvador da Pat ri a ( “ S aviour of
the Fat h e r l a n d ” ; 1989) was accused, o n
the other hand, of favouring the presiden-
tial campaign of Inácio Lula Da Silva ,s i n c e
it closely mirrored his life story as a half-lite-
r ate peasant who rose to be a powerful trade
union leader and presidential candidat e .
“Lula”,however, was not elected.
A multi-million-dollar 
industry
This new trend, which is very popular
with Latin American audiences,shows the
vitality of the soap tradition, which can
affect politicians and adapt to curr e n t
e ve n t s. The t e l e n ove l a, s ays Colombian
s c ri p t w riter Fe rnando Gaitán, has become
“the continent’s main channel of commu-
n i c at i o n ,d r awing larger audiences than the
cinema, novels or the theatre.” But as well
as being a firmly-established regional craze
which has now spread all over the world,it
is also a multi-million-dollar industry.The
biggest production companies—in Brazil,
Mexico and Venezuela—present their wo r k

at international television trade fairs and
h ave sales offices in Miami and Europe
which distribute their products over two-
thirds of the globe (see box).
Prime time 
productions
Brazil’s TV Globo is perhaps the most
typical of these firms and has sold teleno-
velas to 123 countries, according to its
i n t e rn ational sales director, O r l a n d o
Marques. The TV Globo telenovelas are
screened from six in the evening on and
their 160 or so episodes cost between
$50,000 and $60,000 each to make. The
local viewing audience is around 80 mil-
lion people. A 30-second pri m e - t i m e
advertising spot when the soaps are on
the air costs $60,000 or so.TV Globo has
four recording studios and a script-wri-
ting staff of about 1,500.While the soap is
showing, polls and discussion groups are
held in several cities to gather viewers’
opinions and suggestions. Telenovelas were
responsible for almost $1.6 billion in
billings for 1996, 60 per cent of Brazilian
TV’s ad billings. “Without telenovelas, TV
Globo might not exist,” says Jorge Adib,
the company’s former international sales
director. This is true of Latin American
television overall.The soap opera industry
has helped train professionals and highly
specialized technicians, while also encou-
raging the emergence of a Latin American
star system.
L atin A m e rican soaps really took off
worldwide in the 1980s when, after conque-
ring the European market, they began to
interest A r a b ,A f rican and Asian countri e s.
N ow they are as much a symbol of Lat i n
A m e rica as salsa and football. Some are tre-
mendous hits, like the Brazilian soap E s c l ava
I s a u ra in countries as different as China
(where it was shown for the first time in
1980 in Mandari n , and again in 1983),
Poland and Cuba. O t h e rs , like Ve n e z u e l a ’s
C ri s t a l, which has been shown seven times in
S p a i n ,n e ver seem to lose their populari t y. L o s
Ricos También Llora n (“The Rich Cry To o ” ) ,
a Mexican production, p r oved a real tear-
jerker in Russia, where two-thirds of Mos-
c ow ’s impove rished inhabitants saw that
money doesn’t always buy happiness.To p a c i o
( “ To p a z ” ) , from Ve n e z u e l a , has been sold
to 45 countri e s.
What’s the secret of their success? Do
gr owing demand and low production costs
explain their extraordinarily wide distri bu-
tion? Or is it, as some believe ,t h at Latin exo-
ticism and emotional exuberance draw the
viewers? “It’s a fact that stories with lots of
local colour, showing typical Latin Ame-
rican scenes and people,are most popular
in the rest of the wo r l d ,” s ays researcher
Daniel Mato.
The current success of Brazil’s Rei do
Gado (“The Cattle King”), set in the 19th
century during the war between landow-
n e rs and landless peasants, a n d
C o l o m b i a ’s Café con Aroma de Mujer
(“Coffee with the Scent of a Woman”)
which tells a love story amid the ups and
downs of big players in the coffee indus-
try, seems to confirm this. Some, like
H e n ri N’Koumo, a journalist on the
Abidjan newspaper Fraternité Matin, say
TV soaps are popular “because they
touch very deep chords. Despite cultural
differences, people feel very comfortable
with these tales. They prefer them to the
French ones which they find too intellec-
tual.”
Filipino columnist Conrado de Quiros
a gr e e s. “Filipino soaps are too fa m i l i a r.
American soaps are too alien. Latin Ame-
rican ones are neither,” he say s.They do not
fall into the ove r - s o p h i s t i c ation of A m e-
rican super-luxury or the intellectualism
of European productions, but still allow

people to escape from a humdrum exis-
t e n c e .The Manila Daily Inquirer n e w s p a p e r
s ays M a ri m a r o f f e rs relief to Filipinos
“ t rying to escape from the ugliness of their
s u rr o u n d i n g s , the ugliness of their pove rt y,
the ugliness of their public officials.”
A real sense
of complicity
All t e l e n ove l a s are built around topics
which “ h ave existed since the beginning of
human society,” s ays Arquímides Rive r o,
one of the founders of the genre in Ve n e z u e l a .
These unive rsal situations and the feeling
of identific ation with a story inspired by real
life without being a carbon copy of it explains
the popularity of soap operas with such an
eclectic range of audiences. V i e we rs live
through the sufferings and misfortunes of the
c h a r a c t e rs and develop a real sense of com-
plicity with them.
“ W h at I like about M a ri m a r,” s ay s
Ligaya Magbanua, who works in a Manila
restaurant, “is that she has the same pro-
blems as we do. S h e ’s poor like us. H e r
house was burned down.They mistreated
her.They degraded her. She’s almost Fili-
pina.”
Perhaps the main reason for this success
is to be found in the rationale and ethics of
m e l o d r a m a . Researcher Nora Mazziotti
s ays viewe rs follow for months the mishaps,
i n j u s t ic e s , d a n g e rs and threats which the
c h a r a c t e rs endure before savo u ring with them
the ultimate triumph of love and justice—
o b s e rving that in the make-believe wo r l d ,
and maybe nowhere else, t h e r e ’s justice.
T h at ’s something to be happy about. n

(“Isaura the Slave”).
‘ What I like about Marimar is that she has 
the same problems as we do. S h e ’s poor like us. Her house 
was burned down. They mistreated her.They degraded her.
S h e ’s almost Filipina.’
