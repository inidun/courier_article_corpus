I was named Secre-
tary-General of the 
International Social 
Science Council (ISSC) 
when it was founded 
in 1952-1953 and the 
f irst President was 
Donald Young. The 
Director-General of 
UNESCO was Jaime 
Torres Bodet, but I 
had little contact 
with him. I served as 
ISSC Secretary-Gene-
ral until 1959-1960, 
when I was elected to the Collège 
de France. I stepped down so that 
I could concentrate on teaching. 
During those years, my closest 
associates were Georges Balan-
dier, Deputy Secretary-General 
who left the ISSC at the same 
time as I, and Mrs Edna Hindie Le 
May, my secretary, who later 
became my colleague at the École 
des hautes études en sciences 
sociales, and who unfortunately 
died not long ago. 
There was an incident in the 
early days of the ISSC that almost 
became a crisis. Some Soviets had 
been invited by UNESCO to one of 
the ISSC’s first meetings. The

times with Samy Friedman, an 
Egyptian in the same department. 
Incidentally, when I left the 
ISSC, Szczerba-Likiernik, who had 
just retired from UNESCO, took 
over f rom me as Secretary-
General. As did Samy Friedman, 
who became the third ISSC 
Secretary-General. 
Promoting cultural 
diversity 
During those years, the two most 
memorable personalities I was 
involved with were Otto Klineberg 
(from Canada) and Alfred Métraux 
(from Switzerland).  …
Americans who were going to take 
part in the meeting found out 
about it when they arrived in 
Paris. It was at the height of 
McCarthyism. They threatened to 
leave the next day, which would 
have compromised holding the 
meeting. Finally, the Soviets 
didn’t come and the incident was 
closed. 
At UNESCO I was mainly in 
contact with the Social Science 
department – at the time headed 
by the Englishman Thomas H. 
Marshall – and in particular with 
Kazimierz Szczerba-Likiernik from 
Poland, designated by UNESCO as 
focal point for its dealings with

“The promotion of cultural diversity is undoubtedly a significant stage in UNESCO’s activities 
and particularly the safeguarding of intangible heritage,” says Claude Lévi-Strauss in this 
interview he gave UNESCO on 20 November 2006, in which he outlines his history with the 
Organization.

between 1977 and 1988, I asked 
my hosts if I could visit weavers,

who have traditional know-how. 
Anthropologists have always been

through detailed descriptions and 
analyses, to making it known. 

The promotion of cultural

York during the time I lived in 
the United States, from 1941 to 
1947, when he was a professor at 
Columbia University. As for 
Métraux, he was a remarkable 
anthropologist with a post at 
UNESCO in the Social Science 
department, and his work was 
very influential. I believe in fact 
that Edgardo Krebs (from Argen-
tina) is preparing an exhibition 
about Métraux at the Smithso-
nian Institution. 
The gist of the ISSC’s work 
consisted of promoting exchan-
ges between the different disci-
plines, by bringing together 
people from very different bac-
kgrounds like anthropologists, 
sociologists, economists, psycho-
sociologists, etc. You have to 
remember, specialists back then 
were confined to their disciplines 
and had little opportunity for 
dialogue.

Occasionally I contributed to the 
UNESCO Courier and the Social 
Science Bulletin, which became 
the International Social Science 
Journal (ISSJ). In 1950, UNESCO 
invited me to take part, with a 
group of international experts, in 
the draf t ing of the f ir s t 
Declaration on race, which was 
published in the UNESCO Courier. 
Ashley Montagu, an American, was 
the rapporteur of the group of 
experts. Subsequently UNESCO 
asked me in 1952 for a text on 
“Race and History”. In 1971, it 
invited me to give a lecture about 
“Race and Culture”, which the ISSJ 
published that same year. Later 
those last two texts were
