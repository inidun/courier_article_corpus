The computer revolution
in research libraries
by Richard Dougherty
THE research library in the United
States today is more than simply a
vast reservoir of traditional books,
journals and microforms; its role has ex¬
panded and been enhanced to support
faculty and students in obtaining and utiliz¬
ing information resources. Furthermore, in
order to cope with the physical growth of
collections due to the vast increase in the
number of publications, libraries on many
college campuses have been dispersed and a
network of library outlets created. Staff of
the premier research libraries often number
several hundred and the functions they per¬
form are vastly different from those carried
out by their predecessors.
The impact of computer technology on
United States research libraries over the
past decade has been little short of spec¬
tacular. In the past ten to fifteen years there
has been a gradual evolution of the con¬
figuration, power and functions of these
systems. Ushered in by the appearance of
the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC)
computer network, the new technical
capabilities enabled libraries to share a
common data base in support of catalogu¬
ing operations. Without question the
OCLC system revolutionized the work of
technical services divisions of large
libraries. OCLC grew rapidly throughout
the 1970s until it now serves over 2,000
public, academic and special libraries and
the computer support system supports in
excess of 6,000 terminals.
A similar system developed by the
Research Libraries Group, called the
Research Libraries Information Network
(RLIN), was designed specifically to sup¬
port the programmes of research libraries.
Although the technology underlying OCLC
and RLIN are fundamentally different,
both systems are nationwide in scope and
are configured in a manner network experts
frequently refer to as "star networks", that

is, with a centralized computer system
which is linked to distant libraries via
telecommunications .
In addition to such networks as OCLC
and RLIN, individual libraries such as those
of Northwestern University, Stanford
University and the University of Chicago,
have developed local on-line technical sup¬
port systems (for example, systems to han¬
dle book purchasing, accounting, serials
check-in, on-line cataloguing, etc). In the
late 1970s, commercial vendors also began
to make available "turn-key" systems
designed to support single operations such
as circulation and acquisitions.
Currently the provision of on-line
catalogues to replace the venerable card
catalogue is receiving the highest priority in
most university libraries. Studies that have
already been conducted by the Council on
Library Resources, Inc. reflect how much
more powerful the new catalogues are and
every indication is that they will be en¬
thusiastically accepted by the next genera¬
tion of library users.
In the next few years it will become com¬
mon for libraries to operate integrated
library systems which will tie together all the
traditional library support activities into a
single computer system. An integrated
library system will support the basic func¬
tions of circulation, acquisitions, accoun¬
ting, cataloguing of all materials, all aspects
of serials work, binding and inter-library
lending.
Perhaps more importantly these library
systems will be tied into campus networks
so that users will be able to access the
catalogues of neighbouring libraries.
At present there is a nationally-funded ef¬
fort to link together the computers of the
Library of Congress, the Research Libraries
Group, OCLC and the Washington Library
Network (a regional network which serves
the libraries of the north Pacific in the same
manner as the systems of OCLC and the
Research Libraries Group support their
members). When this Linked Systems Pro¬
ject is completed, it will become possible for
the major bibliographic utilities on the
North American continent to share records
among themselves and with the Library of
Congress.
Another major preoccupation of United
States librarians today is the physical
preservation of their collections. As P.N.
Banks, a noted expert on paper preserva¬
tion, warned in 1978, "it is safe to say that
the library environment is essentially hostile
to all forms of recorded materials". But the
severity of the problem did not gain general
recognition among research librarians until
the late 1970s. Even though preservation ex¬
perts had been issuing warnings for many
years, most library administrators were
under such extreme pressure to find ways to
increase inter-library lending and to
automate library operations that they had
little time to attend to the longer-term
danger of collection deterioration.
During the early 1980s the situation
changed rapidly and library staffs began to
look carefully at the condition of their col¬
lections. A survey conducted at the Univer-
26

sity of Michigan determined that, based on
1978 costs, expenditure in excess of forty
million dollars would be required to
preserve and to conserve all the volumes
that would require attention between 1978
and the end of the century. The results
reported by the University of Michigan
were typical of reports issued by other large
research libraries.
The financial dimensions of the preserva¬
tion problem are so staggering that most
universities will not be able to raise the
funds necessary to solve local problems.
Co-operative programmes, such as the
Research Library Group's microfilming
project, offer one of the few viable solu¬
tions, allowing libraries to work together
and to avoid unnecessary duplication of
microfilming activity. In the final analysis,
if the content of American libraries is to
survive for the use of future generations, it
will probably require the assistance of
private foundations and the intervention of
Federal programmes to augment the
resources made available by individual
universities.
The rapid growth in size and programmes
of research libraries has also brought about
great changes in the duties and respon¬
sibilities of professional librarians. Faculty
staff have played a less active role in the
development of library collections and this
work has been turned over to library
bibliographers and collection development
experts.
While the appearance of new technology
has created new opportunities for libraries,
the rapid changes caused by technology
have also caused a great deal of organiza¬
tional stress. Librarians are caught between
the opportunities afforded by technology
and the considerable strain of acquiring
new skills and developing new programmes.
Technology has enabled librarians to
play a more central role in providing faculty
and students with publications, informa¬
tion and data derived from bibliographic
and non-bibliographic data bases. In large
part librarians have been successful because
in recent years the profession has placed a
strong emphasis on preparing them to work
in an increasingly technological environ¬
ment. The major question facing academic
librarianship is what roles the librarian will
play in the years ahead.
American research libraries will embrace
new technology as it becomes available. For
example, libraries are already considering
how best to use the new video and optical
disc technologies. These new storage
systems linked to microcomputers will pro¬
vide opportunities to store vast amounts of
printed matter in the form of analog images
or as digitized data. The work at the Library
of Congress utilizing optical disc
technology suggests that this storage media
might very well solve the current preserva¬
tion crisis.
Librarians have been eminently suc¬
cessful in assisting students and researchers
in the use of data bases to obtain informa-

tion about the location of books and jour¬
nals. But our ability to deliver documents
has not kept pace with the improvements in
providing bibliographic access. Thus future
emphasis on improvements in document
delivery systems seems quite important.
One of the most important developments
will be the growing interdependence bet¬
ween libraries and campus computer cen¬
tres. These two campus support systems
have operated as independent organiza¬
tions, but as libraries become increasingly
dependent upon technology and computer
centres become more involved with the
delivery of information the need for these
two organizations to work more closely
together becomes more evident. Although it
is too early to say what changes are likely to
take place, it is possible that this growing
relationship will require changes in the way
libraries and computer centres are organiz¬
ed within the university governance system.
Writers such as Patricia Battin have
described a possible integration of these two
campus organizations. She foresees that
such an integration of library and com¬
puting agency, "each with its specific
strengths and expertise, will provide one-
stop shopping for the university community
as well as stabilizing planning mechanisms
for effective and flexible response to rapidly
changing technologies". Other writers
foresee a greater involvement in public
policy as the scope of problems such as
budgets, the need to capitalize expensive in¬
formation services and the problem of
preservation require institutional response
in the context of public policy.
In the longer term, those who formulate
public policy may come to realize that the
research libraries of universities comprise a
cohesive national resource rather than a
series of individual collections. The
technology necessary to link together the
libraries of the nation is rapidly becoming
available and affordable so that the chang¬
ing attitudes of legislators and government
officials toward the role of research
libraries could become a major develop¬
ment during the next generation.
