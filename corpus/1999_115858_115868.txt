“In practice,the distinction between invention
and discovery in areas such as genetics and infor-
mation technology is becoming increasingly mea-
ningless and irrelevant,” says patent lawyer Simon
Cohen of the London-based company Tay l o r
Johnson Garrett.
This interpretation is increasingly accepted by
the court s. In a number of landmark cases, f o r
e x a m p l e , both U. S . and European courts have
upheld the claim that the knowledge of the sequence
of chemical bases that makes up a human or animal
gene—whose undisputed status as a major “disco-
ve ry ” is endorsed by its announcement in the pages
of prestigious journals such as N at u r e and S c i e n c e—
can be patented.
The only caveat is that this knowledge must be
s h own to have some potential commercial va l u e .B u t
t h at is seldom difficult to demonstrat e , for example
by using knowledge of, s ay, a gene discovered to be
i nvo l ved in breast cancer to design a test to seek out
mutations in the gene that indicate increased sus-
ceptibility to the disease. The courts have gi ve n
similar endorsement to the patenting of mat h e m a-
tical algorithms.
At the same time, h owe ve r , this trend—and par-
ticularly the patenting of scientific discove ries on
living processes such as animal cell lines or genetically
e n gineered animals—has become increasingly the
target of critics such as environmentalists and animal
rights support e rs concerned at the potential implica-
tions on control of access to scientific knowledge that
it represents.
Three criticisms in particular are being widely
heard.The first,primarily from the scientific com-
munity, is that the growing ability to patent scien-
tific “ d i s c ove ri e s ” is encouraging researchers to
construct a wall of secrecy around their work that
directly challenges the traditions of open commu-
n i c ation on which modern science has depended for
its vitality and success.
Up to now, science has thri ved on the sharing of
e x p e rimental results, often ve ry preliminary,b e t we e n
c o l l e a g u e s. Much of science develops through debat e s

There was a time when basic scientific know-
ledge was considered primarily to be a public
good.The argument was that since most of it
was produced through public funding—namely the
g ove rn m e n t ’s support of unive rsities—and intended
to benefit society as a whole, no one should be able
to control access to it by others.
Today, however, all that has changed.The key
role of science at the heart of the modern “know-
ledge economy” means that what was previously
seen as a public good is being transformed into a pri-
vate commodity.
Two industries in particular have been respon-
sible for this shift. One is the biotechnology industry,
where information about the detailed structure of
living cells and individual genes, previously of
interest primarily to the laboratory biologist, now
offers the possibility of being rapidly transformed
into profitable pharmaceutical products or medical
screening technologies.
The second is the inform ation technology industry.
Up to now, m at h e m atical formulae were considered
to be too abstract—and,by implicat i o n ,too accessible
to anyone with the appropri ate intellectual skills—to
be considered pri vate propert y.But the reliance of high-
p owered computing on sophisticated mat h e m at i c a l
a l g o rithms has led to a gr owing acceptance that eve n
m at h e m atical formulae can in certain circumstances
be treated as pri vate propert y.
A controversial
trend
Under challenge in both cases is an important
distinction that,previously, was used to define the
limit of what could be patented.This is the dis-
tinction between a scientific “ d i s c ove ry ” ( w h i c h
could not be patented) and a technical “ i nve n t i o n ”
(which can).
To d ay, h owe ve r , the speed with which scientific
discoveries can be turned into technical products
and the large commercial profits that can be gene-
r ated by this process means that , in practice, the dis-
tinction between discove ry and invention has
become blurred.As a result, the moral distinction
b e t ween what should and what should not be
p atented has once again become highly conten-
tious.
I n d u s t ry ’s argument is straightforwa r d . If it has
“paid” for a certain useful scientific discovery by
s u p p o rting the scientists—either in its own labora-
t o ri e s , or even in a unive rsity—who made it, then it
has a right to seek a return on its investment by char-
ging others for using this discove ry (or even keeping
it for its own exclusive use).
“ I n ventions cannot, i n
n at u re, be a subject of
p ro p e r t y.”

third President of 
the United States (1743-1826)

l a b o r at o ry coffee room to intern ational c o n f e r e n c e s.
But scientists are now being wa rned that , i f
they discuss their results openly prior to publishing
them in a scientific journ a l , they run two ri s k s. O n e
is that, if someone reports these discussions—for
example, in the proceedings of a conference—this
can be taken as a form of “ p u b l i c at i o n ”t h at can jeo-
pardize their chance of being awarded a patent.
This is because, at least in Europe,a patent appli-
c ation must be made before an invention or discove ry
is made public (the rules in the United States are
more fle x i b l e ,a l l owing a scientist a “ grace peri o d ”o f
12 months after publication of a new discove ry
d u ring which a patent application can be fil e d ) .
The second risk is that an unscrupulous col-
league, overhearing an original idea from another
r e s e a r c h e r ,m ay hastily incorp o r ate it into his or her
own patent applicat i o n , without divulging where the
idea originated from.
In order to avoid either situation ari s i n g, s c i e n-
tists are now being advised—for example, by pat e n t
lawyers—not to divulge their results to colleagues
until it has been completed and full patent protec-
tion has been applied for.
Secrecy
on the campus
The result is a growing “culture of secrecy” in
u n i ve rsities where even researchers working in
n e i g h b o u ring laborat o ries are reported to be increa-
singly reluctant to discuss their fin d i n g s ,e ven though
failure to do so may slow down the scientific dis-
covery process.
The issue of gr owing secrecy on unive rsity cam-
puses was highlighted at a recent meeting sponsored
jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Te c h n o l o g y
and the A m e rican A s s o c i ation for the A d va n c e m e n t
of Science.
“ Pa rt of the failure lies with academics who think
‘by God, I’m going to be ri c h ,”Alan Goldhammer of
the Biotechnology Industry Organization told the
m e e t i n g . John Deutch, f o rmer dean of science at
M I T, d e s c ribed secrecy as “a major threat to science
and . . . antithetical to the purpose of unive rs i t i e s.”
A second cri t i c i s m , coming mainly from cri t i c s
of genetic engi n e e ri n g, is that permitting patents on
biomedical discove ries—such as new genes, or eve n
parts of genes—is inherently immoral, as humans
h ave no moral basis for claiming commercial ri g h t s
over living matter.
The third question addresses the issue of Nort h -
South equity in a world where both scientific know l e d g e
and economic power are unequally divided. Here the
argument is that those countries that are already the most
economically powerful are being allowed to increase their
dominance by exploiting the fact that they also control
access to the scientific knowledge that increasingly prov i d e s
the basis of this powe r.
The battle is far from ove r. M a ny scientists, f o r
e x a m p l e , are now insisting that inform ation deri ve d
from their efforts be placed in the public domain.T h o s e
attending an intern ational meeting in Bermuda in
Fe b ru a ry 1996, for example, designed to establish a
common framework for human genome sequencing—
d e c i p h e ring the precise sequence of the amino-acid
bases that make up a single strand of human DNA—
urged that all sequence data produced by centres funded
for large-scale sequencing should be placed in the public
d o m a i n .
Most of those engaged in these debates accept that
the distinction between discovery and invention is no
l o n g e r , in itself, a valid basis for determining the boun-
dary line between public and private knowledge.The
challenge ahead is to rewrite the rules of the game in a
socially equitable and morally acceptable way. n
The argument is that those countries
that are already the most
economically powerful are being
allowed to increase their dominance
by exploiting the fact that they also
c o n t rol access to the scientific
knowledge that incre a s i n g l y
p rovides the basis of this power
