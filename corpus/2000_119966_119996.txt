In the industrial city of Ulsan, Lim Myung-sook
represents a rare coup in Korean society, a
woman in a position of public powe r. In this tra-
ditionally male-dominated nat i o n , the 45-ye a r - o l d
local assemblywoman is one of the success stories
of the non-profit Center for Korean Women and
Politics (CKWP).
H i s t o ri c a l l y, the public visage of Korea has been a
male one,while a wo m a n ’s role has been confined lar-
gely to the pri vate world of the home, a fact rein-
forced by the still strongly persistent values of Confu-
cianism and a male-run corp o r ate wo r l d .“Korea is not
really feminized at all,” s ays Sohn Bong-Scuk,a poli-
tical scientist and the founder of the CKWP. “ T h e
value system has prohibited women from getting
i nvo l ved in politics,”s ays Sohn,pointing to the fact that
municipalities and the National Assembly have seen
just a handful of female representat i ve s.
Sohn established the CKWP in 1990 to help
b ridge the gap between the ideal of equal representa-
tion and reality. Funded largely by foundation gr a n t s ,
the center employs a staff of eight and operates on an
annual budget of $180,000. For Sohn, there are three
major obstacles to gr e ater female representat i o n :t h e
p owerful male-oriented political culture, a deep-
rooted old-boys network and economics.
“Korean political parties are ve ry much pri vat e ,
person-centered parties with many medium-level
b o s s e s. If you want to be an important person in the
p a rty you must belong to someone else in the fa m i l y

tree,so it’s not easy for a woman to enter that kind
of informal inner-circle,” says Sohn.
Most women also don’t have the large sums of
money needed to run for offic e . By law, n at i o n a l
assembly candidates must have a minimum of
$210,000 for their campaigns. H owe ver Sohn say s
some candidates will spend up to two million dollars.
Backing with strings attached
F u rt h e rm o r e ,c o rp o r ations have proved unwilling
to back female candidat e s.“When business or indus-
t rial sectors support a candidat e , there is a kind of
s t ring at t a c h e d . In the case of a woman candidat e ,
they don’t feel they’ll get anything back,” s ays Sohn.
“As a minority in politics, women are ve ry cautious
and tend to be less invo l ved in any dirty bu s i n e s s.
They are also usually firs t - year congr e s swomen so
they are not in positions of power yet to help them.”
Lim Myung-sook struggled to raise the $9,000
minimum to run for office in her local assembly. B u t
with the financial support of the CKWP and another
local non-profit gr o u p, she managed to raise the mini-
mum but far less than most candidat e s. H owe ve r ,
more than money and the expected prejudices stood
b e t ween her and offic e : Lim was sorely lacking in poli-
tical experi e n c e .In 1994, she was working as an env i-
ronmental campaign activist when friends suggested
she run in the upcoming local assembly election.W h i l e
p r e p a ring her bid, she received a call from Sohn who
i nvited her to attend the center’s “Campaign School.”

Lim attended a three-day session with about 40
other wo m e n , five of whom were also candidat e s
in other local assembly races. At the theoretical
l e ve l , the women learned to see female political par-
ticipation as a means to the ultimate goals of equa-
lity and true democratic representat i o n .At the prac-
tical leve l , they focused on speech-making skills,
political and campaign strategy as well as making
voter contact. In Korean election campaigns, i m a g e
is all-import a n t . So the women were advised on
fashion and hair styles, while those who used regi o-
nal dialects were coached in standard Korean.
Finally, participants were assigned roles as candi-
d at e s , electoral offic e rs and campaign managers
and a model election was held.
Different policy
preferences
Lim was among three women from her session
who went on to electoral success. In 1995, s h e
became the first woman to be elected to the Ulsan
Local A s s e m b l y, and she was re-elected in 1998.
Since then, another two women have attained offic e
in Ulsan.
Last A p ri l , CKWP also had reason to celebrat e .A
c a n d i d ate who they had trained in Seoul and also
sent abroad to Germ a ny and the United States for fur-
ther preparation was elected to the national assembly.
In most cases though, the center focuses on the gr a s s-
r o o t s ,u r ging housewives to run for local rather than
n ational offic e , whose candidates tend to already be
s avvy politicians.
In addition to the campaign school, the center
holds annual training sessions for women interested
in political issues. For three day s ,u n i ve rsity students,
h o u s e w i ves and established bu s i n e s swomen gat h e r
to discuss a chosen theme,such as sexual harassment
or affirm at i ve action.After seminars and discussion on
the topic, they are assigned roles, such as minister of
labour or minister of foreign affa i rs , and they are
divided into two camps: pro-feminist and anti-femi-
n i s t .They then hold a mock congress to hone their
d e b ating skills and get a taste for politics.“I like to gi ve
them motivation from a young age to be a leader in the
f u t u r e ,” s ays Sohn.
Another major activity is research on political
gender issues like female voting and gove rning pat-
t e rn s. Perhaps most import a n t l y, the CKWP has
found that “ women have different policy preferences
than men,” s ays Sohn. “They are more concern e d
about minori t i e s , the margi n a l , the aged and children.”
For example, in the blue-collar city of Ulsan, a s s e m-
b l y woman Lim has concentrated on fa c t o ry pollution
and recy c l i n g, social we l fare issues, the rights and
needs of the disabled, and wo m e n ’s ri g h t s.
Despite the progr e s s ,Korea is still far from the day
when politicians like Lim will comprise a healthy chunk
of the political base. In the previous national assem-
bly there were 11 women among 299 representat i ve s.
Recent elections in A p ril placed a record 16 wo m e n
into office (11 of whom were elected through affir-
m at i ve action legi s l ation implemented in 1995 after
e x t e n s i ve lobbying by CKWP and other gr o u p s ) .P r o-
gress indeed, but in its 273-seat national assembly,
Korean society is still represented overwhelmingly by
m e n . Sohn says the slow rate of change has been dis-
c o u r a ging but feels the CKWP has contri buted to an
i m p o rtant shift in thinking.“The political conscious-
ness has been raised,” s ays Sohn.“ N ow even men can
accept the wo r d s ,women and politics.” ■
