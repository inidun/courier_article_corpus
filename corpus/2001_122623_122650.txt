Striking media giants
with news on the We b
The Internet offers an unparalleled chance to spread an alternative to the news served up by the
mainstream media, the “second power” of globalization, affirmed the World Social Forum in Porto
Alegre
he organizers of the World Social Fo r u m
in Porto Alegre, Brazil,were expecting
2,000 people to attend a debate on
“another possible world” in the last
week of January. To their surprise, this
“ a n t i - D a v o s ” attracted 5,000 fans. S o
how did the organizers of the forum,
who like to cast themselves as
v i s i o n a r i e s, explain their all too modest
forecast? Why, the Internet of course:
they had set up a website one month
before the Fo r u m .Although very basic,
it spurred much greater interest than
anticipated.
The unexpected turnout was one
more feather in the cap of the anti-
globalization movement.Activists had
already spent much time pleading for
communication in general—and the
Internet in particular—to be considered
a leading “issue in the fight against
n e o l i b e r a l i s m .”As such, it deserved the
same attention as the campaign for the
Tobin Ta x , the cancellation of Th i r d
World debt or the control of world
financial organizations. If not, t h e y
a r g u e d , cyberspace would become their
adversaries’ haven. According to the
conclusions of a Forum workshop on
communication and citizenship, t h e
Internet has already been instrumental
in shaping the economic and
“ i d e o l o g i c a l ” revolution that has
marked the process of globalization.
An ideological
machine
Workshop participants launched a
stinging indictment:“If the first power is
economic and financial, the second
belongs to the media,” declared Ignacio
Ramonet, director of the monthly Le
Monde Diplomatique, upon opening
the workshop. “It is the ideological
machine of globalization.” P a r t i c i p a n t s
asserted that mainstream news “ i s
essentially transformed into a
commodity…that does not obey any
rule except that of the market. It is
u n i f o r m , one-dimensional and based
on a single source.” Continuing the
a t t a c k , Ramonet asserted that the
mainstream media strikes a tone that is
“ e m o t i o n a l ,” “ i m p r e s s i o n i s t i c,”
“ s e n s a t i o n a l i s t ,” “ r h e t o r i c a l ,”
“simplistic” if not outright “infantile,”
and which is dominated by a quest for
“ i m m e d i a cy.” In short, “the supreme
c r i t e r i a ” of media “ m e g a - g r o u p s ” is not
truth but profit. “ Th e y ’re selling
consumers to their advertisers.”
The organizations attending Porto
Alegre decided that it was high time to
take on this “ideological apparatus,”
using the Internet as their chief weapon.
One strategy involves criticizing the
news produced by the “mega groups”—
criticism that must not only be
systematic, but should also be diffused
as widely as possible.A leading example
is FA I R , the best known media
Coming up with alternatives:the World Social Forum,held in Porto Alegre, Brazil,in January 2001.

watchdog in North A m e r i c a . Th e
organization aims to show how the
structures of media conglomerates
dictate content: the topics and
viewpoints developed are those of an
economic and political elite because
these media belong to multinationals
and are financed by others via
advertising.
According to Seth A c k e r m a n ,one of
FA I R ’s staff members, the Internet
boasts three advantages over other
forms of communication, including the
g r o u p ’s magazine quarterly
E x t r a !. Fi r s t , it provides
instant access to a wide
range of alternative news
s o u r c e s, allowing the
network to pick up on
important matters ignored
by North A m e r i c a n
mainstream media or to
reveal a fine-tuned
understanding of biased
c o v e r a g e. S e c o n d l y, FA I R
can dispatch to-the-minute
analyses at minimal cost to
s u b s c r i b e r s. Th i r d l y, it can
involve subscribers in the
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s campaigns
by encouraging them to
email protest messages to
media in FAIR’s spotlight.
“ Thanks to the Internet,
our activities made such a
huge quantitative leap that
t h e y ’ve also changed
q u a l i t a t i v e l y,” s a y s
Ackerman.
The second front that
a n t i - g l o b a l i z a t i o n
organizations are intent on
opening is far more
a m b i t i o u s. The goal is to
make the Internet the
vehicle for a stream of “ c o u n t e r
i n f o r m a t i o n ” or “ a l t e r n a t i v e
i n f o r m a t i o n ” aimed at a mass audience,
far larger than the narrow circle of
activists that all other mediums charged
with the same purpose—the written
p r e s s, radio and television—have
managed to reach.
Diverse sources,
grand ambitions
“ Wh a t ’s really new about the
Internet—and its chief asset—is that
the entry ticket is infinitely more
affordable than for any other more
traditional media,” says Je a n - P i e r r e
M a r t h o z1 of Human Rights Wa t c h .“ Th e
technical and political obstacles, s u c h
as getting around potential censorship,
and above all the financial ones, in terms
of investment and operating costs, b e a r
no comparison with those faced by
someone wishing to start up a
newspaper or a radio or TV station.
Internet opens the way for a diversity of
voices that has been unheard of until
n o w.” Antonio Martins, head of the
Brazilian edition of the M o n d e
D i p l o m a t i q u e, adds that distribution
channels are nearly unlimited on the
w e b,whereas hertzian wavelengths have
to be shared among a limited number of
users.
In short, the Internet radically
changes the information on offer
because it can harbour an unrivalled
number of information sources. Given
that one of the main criticisms of media
conglomerates is their “single source”
c h a r a c t e r, this makes the Internet all
the more appealing says Henri Maler, o f
AC R I M E D ( A c t i o n - c r i t i q u e - m é d i a s ) ,a n
NGO devoted to media monitoring.
According to Maler, the rising costs of
keeping a staff of journalists up and
running means news is based on an
increasingly narrow range of sources.
A first attempt at striking back was
made last December in Bangalore,
I n d i a , by some 30 journalists and writers.
Their starting point was twofold:
throughout the world, they stated,
“ d i s c o u r a g e d ” o r
“ d i s i l l u s i o n e d ”p r o f e s s i o n a l
journalists want to restore
some “nobility to their job,
based on a social and
democratic commitment.”
They can’t do so, however,
because employers stand in
the way of publishing
“articles that the public
wants but never sees in
p r i n t .” Their goal is hence
“to enrich the public
information space… and
create a critical mass of
alternative information”
through “articles in the
written press and broadcast
reports that can contribute
to a socio-economic, c u l t u r a l
and political alternative” t o
g l o b a l i z a t i o n .The ambition
is titanic: to launch a news
service on the Internet that
would sell its products and
succeed in  “becoming a
counterweight to the
mainstream media’s
stereotyped information.”
It would be “ a
complementary channel,”
rich in professionally
packaged content.
Professionals
or not?
To “communicate well, you need a
range of skills,” underlines Ramonet.
“You can know the truth and have no
impact because you don’t know how to
c o m m u n i c a t e. To think that the truth
will naturally impose itself is to take an
arrogant and contemptuous attitude
towards citizens.The price of this is an
absolute absence of communication.”

“A diversity of sources does not
necessarily lead to an avalanche of
quality information, something which
only results from a thorough process
of checking, selecting and setting in
context to give meaning,” says Marthoz.
“The process still requires the hand of
intermediaries who may not be
journalists in the classical sense but
‘ p a r a - j o u r n a l i s t s ’ .” He points to his
o r g a n i z a t i o n ’s site,which has become an
almost indispensable source of
information for anyone wanting to keep
abreast of human rights in the world.
Some 10,000 cybernauts visit the site
each day, according to Marthoz,b e c a u s e
the information placed online is
collected by reliable experts and edited
by seasoned experts in communication.
If this type of alternative service is
anything to go by, audience rhymes with
credibility, which in turn calls for some
form of professional involvement.Not
t r u e, declares Roberto Savio of the Inter
Press service, which has been serving
up alternative news since 1964: t h i s
strategy risks running a lap behind
current trends.Although IPS relies on a
network of journalists in over 100
countries and counts more than 30,000
NGO subscribers on its online service,
Savio, a pioneer of alternative news, is
getting ready to step down and launch
other ventures.
Civil society,he asserts, and youth in
p a r t i c u l a r, reject outright all institutions
or outfits functioning along vertical
lines. It follows that the attempt to use
the Internet as a carrier for a news
counterweight while upholding the key
position of the journalist—producing
information from on high for the public
below—is doomed to fail.It even rests
on a deep contradiction, r e p r o d u c i n g
via Internet the same vertical model
characteristic of all other media even
though the web offers the chance to
start a “communication society”
operating horizontally.
The Brazilian
model
Brazil’s Rits (Information network
for the third sector) is one such new
communication network that believes
the Internet’s advent will allow the well-
worn revolutionary slogan “of giving a
voice to the people” to come true at
last.“Let the people who live the story
tell it,” declares the network.For a start,
you do away with the costs of fin a n c i n g
a team of journalists. R e d ’s associates—
some 200 organizations from the “ t h i r d
sector” (neither public nor private)—
exchange around 10,000 messages a
week and express themselves without
any supervision or editorial advice.Th e
only protection is an ethical code that
dictates what can be put on the site.
With or without professional
i n t e r v e n t i o n , whether raw or edited,
can alternative news find its place in
the limelight simply because it’s
alternative? Judging from present
t r e n d s, Ramonet is mildly optimistic.
“As the overall education level rises,
that of the media is getting worse.Th e r e
will come a time when the two will cross
o v e r : more and more groups and social
categories are dissatisfied with the
m e d i a ’s infantile discourse.” Wh i l e
“nothing is won in advance, b e c a u s e
we’ll also have to be appealing, to win
over hearts and souls,” Martins insists
that once a site is up and running, the
Internet gives a chance to take on media
conglomerates on equal terms, a n
impossible task in the print press or
b r o a d c a s t i n g.M a r t h o z ,h o w e v e r, is more
s c e p t i c a l . “ Th e r e ’s no reason for the
Internet to escape the newstand effect.
Just as the average reader first buys the
most prominent publications at a
n e w s t a n d , the average cybernaut will
first go to the best-known portals
( Ya h o o ! , Google etc). But the latter
select what information is posted,just
like the gatekeepers of the traditional
m e d i a .While Internet offers room for a
large number of information producers,
the tunnel effect is well and truly there
on the receiving end.”
Marthoz also foresees another
s c e n a r i o. “Rather than think that the
Internet will become an authentic
information counterweight, its main
effect will stem from how it influences
the mainstream media.In this respect,
there is no comparison with what the
alternative print press or broadcasting
can do. An alternative site can
immediately be seen by the whole
p l a n e t .” Proof of this is how the world’s
p r e s s, including the most prestigious
p u b l i c a t i o n s, consulted the Human
Rights Watch site to keep up on the
Chechnya war and even find “stories.”
The force of
the alternative
The “Internet mystique” does not
convince AC R I M E D’s Maler “ M a k i n g
the web’s  immense democratic
potential a reality does not depend
chiefly on the tool itself,” he says.“The
space given by the public to alternative
n e w s, as opposed to commodified news,
will be a reflection of the alternative
forces carrying it.” In other words,
between the Internet and anti-
globalization activists, w h o ’s the chicken
and who’s the egg? ■
