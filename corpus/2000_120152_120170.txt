No sooner did I suggest a spot for taking pho-
tos of the 15 rappers and breakdancers we
went to meet in Aguablanca (Colombia) than
trouble began. In the cab ride to the interv i e w, I
passed a neighbourhood barbershop with a poster
of slain U.S. rapper Tupac Shakur in the window
and some funny haircuts painted on the glass—and
thought of suggesting it as a backdrop.
But on broaching the idea, a guy called
“Maligno” got in my face and said, “I ain’t down
with [agreeing to] the bit about the barbers. Some
people be say i n ’t h at the barbers be down with hip-
hop ‘cause they be doin’ the razor cuts [popular
among male rappers ] , but that ain’t necessarily so.”
The complaints continued, once we reached the
shop, as four of the rappers pointed to the name,
“New American Power”. Lalo, the photographer,
and I quickly suggested looking for another site.
Walking down a side street, I began explaining
t h at readers in other parts of the world would like to
see where they live .“ Ye a h , you wanna see how poor
we are,right?”announced Puto, a young man with
his hair braided in the dreadlocks of a Rastafarian.
“Here you go,” he said pointing to a shack at the
end of a dirt road.“I bet you wanna take a picture
of us in front of that shack, right?”
This went on for an hour. At the end, Lalo, a
we l l - t r aveled Colombian photogr a p h e r , was swe at-
ing, and not because of the heat. “These kids are
tough to work with,” he said with understatement.
Demanding precision
And I began to realise what hip-hop in Colom-
bia is all about—a search for identity among those
who have no other voice.These kids wanted Lalo’s
photos to show exactly who they we r e ,d own to the
last detail.They speak the “language of the world’s
ghettos”,as 23-year-old rapper and producer Car-
los Andrés Pacheco explained lat e r — but in their
own urban, South American, Colombian version.
This can mean including Cali’s particular salsa
cadence in a tune or even rapping about the nar-
cotics trade wreaking havoc in Colombian society.
In what were once wetlands on the southern edge
of Cali (the country ’s second city),Aguablanca is one
of Latin A m e ri c a ’s largest “ i nvasions”—areas on the
o u t s k i rts of cities where people seek refuge from ru r a l
violence and pove rt y.About 400,000 people of colour
from the Pa c i fic coast have settled here over the last
few decades,often finding more violence and pove rt y
in an urban form . Since 1994, the Aguablanca Cul-
tural Network has been trying to help,for example,b y
s u p p o rting about 25 of the area’s dozens of rap and
breakdance gr o u p s.
This support includes practical help like gi v i n g
the groups a gat h e ring place—a big help in light of the
fact that many of these kids live in single-floor houses
with up to eight siblings crammed into a few rooms,
while few institutions open their doors to bands of
t e e n a g e rs with dreadlocks and baggy jeans. One of the
n e t wo r k s ’l e a d e rs is Robinson Ruiz, who also belongs
to BS, a rap trio with a video—a status symbol of
s o rts in Colombia’s rap scene, barely a decade old.
“Throwing consciousness
out there”
Ruiz has called a meeting to discuss upcoming
e ve n t s , including the first annive rs a ry of a weekly radio
s h ow dedicated partially to rap called “The Zone”.
C a l i , with four radio stations now programming rap,
leads the nat i o n ;B o g o t á , the capital,has two.
The 15 rappers and breakers dwelled on the same
issue raised by the photos: i d e n t i t y.They talked about
whom to thank at the ceremony and why — m e a n i n g
who is really part of the scene and who isn’t .T h e y
also talked about money, questioning whether some
groups are paying for airp l ay on the radio.
A few days lat e r , rapper Carlos Andrés Pa c h e c o
highlights another aspect of the local hip-hop cul-
t u r e . Until recently, Carlos Andrés belonged to the
Bogotá gr o u p, Gotas de Rap, or Drops of Rap—one
of the few to have two produced CDs and to have
performed in Europe on three tours.
Pacheco told the story of the Colombia Rap Car-
t e l , a “trade gr o u p ”t h at he founded with members of
five other groups around the country three ye a rs ago
to help up-and-coming rappers get instru m e n t s ,s t u-
dio time,and so on.He spoke of “ p r o b l e m s ”with this
e f f o rt , including “different ways of thinking” a m o n g
m e m b e rs.“ M a ny of the groups think that when they
make a demo tape and play a few concert s , t h e y ’r e
going to get rich quick,” said Pa c h e c o. “They think
t h e y ’re going to ride in a Cadillac.They aren’t con-
scious of what rap is really about.”
For Pa c h e c o, hip-hop is aimed at  “ t h r ow i n g
consciousness out there” to the public, i n c l u d i n g
rapping about the complex relations between Wa s h-
ington and Bogotá as reflected in the war against
d ru g s. “The way I see it,” said the rapper, “ we sell
c o c a i n e , just like the United States sells arm s —

which also kill people.Both are part of the economy,
and it’s pretty hard for people in the countrys i d e
here to surv i ve on anything else.” Through his
lyrics,he tries to highlight positive options for kids
in Colombia’s cities who “ a lways have that door
open to gangs,drugs,prison…” Finally, he admit-
ted that it isn’t easy to raise such topics in a violent
c o u n t ry like Colombia. “ You have to be careful
about how you get the message across and make it
almost subliminal,” he warned.
For most of the rappers and breakers , there are
t wo kinds of messages wo rth communicat i n g :p r o t e s t s
or proposals.M a ria Eugenia Barquero,whose five - gi r l
gr o u p, Impacto Lat i n o, is one of a gr owing number in
C o l o m b i a ’s hip-hop scene.“ We ’re telling other kids to
take up culture, instead of violence and dru g s.To feel
proud to be Colombian. This is our proposal,” s h e
said before explaining that some groups focus on
protesting against the stat e , the ri c h , or the United
S t at e s. As for the gangsta image put across by many
U. S . r a p p e rs , she and most others view it as a com-
mercial development of little interest.
C u rious about her sense of identity as a person of
colour and how this might relate to her “ p r o p o s a l s ” ,
I asked which black Colombians she admired. “ M y
fat h e r ,” she said,“for all he’s done to raise us.”W h e n
pressed for more names, she asked “Do they have
to be black?” As for “people in general,” she men-
tioned U. S . female rappers TLC and Salt n’ Pe p p a .
As for being a young female rapper in a country
where most beer ads are adorned by bu x o m
blondes in bikinis, Barquero said,“ you feel that the
other groups and the public are all saying, ‘can she
do it?’And then we show that we can.”
The braided 18-year-old Barquero sees herself as
a potential ambassador of sort s. In about five ye a rs ,
she hopes to take her hip-hop message of non-vio-
lence around this country mired in civil wa r. But she
h a s n ’t figured out how to overcome a major barri e r —
m o n e y.
While discussing hip-hop’s meagre fin a n c i a l
r e wa r d s , Luis Felipe Jaramillo of Discos Fuentes
recounted two experiences he had recording rap
groups in 1998.The company didn’t agree with the
groups’lyrics “attacking the United States and the
Spanish conquistadors.” S o, they released the
records under another name: Factory Records.
Political demands vs.
commercial dividends
“ We did the project basically to help the
gr o u p s ,” said Ja r a m i l l o. Only 1,000 copies we r e
p ri n t e d , but “ ve ry few of them sold.” So Discos
Fuentes is not embarking on any major rap adven-
tures for now, aside from one group, Latinos en la
casa, or Latins in the House—who rap about sub-
jects like Juan Pablo Montoya, the young Colom-
bian dri ver who recently won the U. S . car race,
Indianapolis 500.About 1,500 copies of the albu m
will be produced. E ven Gotas de Rap has neve r
pressed more than 5,000 compact discs.
Orlando Cajamarca, a director who brought the-
atre to 150,000 of A g u a b l a n c a ’s kids over the last 14
ye a rs , questions rap’s future in Colombia for cul-
tural reasons rather than money. He sees rap as part
of globalisat i o n , tracing it to cable T V ’s arri val in
Colombia over the last decade, explaining that “ e ve n
the poorest slums here have television.” He wo n-
d e rs if rap isn’t just a passing fad and says leaders are
lacking in the Colombian hip-hop community.
Pat ricia A ri z a , producer of the group Gotas de Rap,
d i s a gr e e s. Hip-hop is a “ valuable cultural altern at i ve
for marginal sectors of this society,” said A ri z a ,b e f o r e
expressing faith in its financial future.“The bu s i n e s s
world always takes a long time to recognise the under-
ground wo r l d , but eventually it does.” ■
Aguablanca’s rap community may speak the “language of the world’s ghettos”but they want no borrowed images 
and labels.
