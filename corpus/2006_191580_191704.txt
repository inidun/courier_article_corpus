Why do you think 
it is important to protect 
the giant panda? 
First of all, because it is en-
dangered. At present China is 
the only country where giant 
pandas continue to live in the 
wild, with a population of only 
1,500 individuals. Beyond that, 
the existence of giant pandas 
is extremely old in the history 
of evolution, going back 12 mil-
lion years. In the middle of the 
Pleistocene, the oldest period 
of the quaternary era, the gi-
ant panda went through a pe-
riod of very rapid development. 
After an evolution of three mil-
lion years as a carnivore, the 
giant panda became a “vege-
tarian” with bamboo as its prin-
cipal food source. Outside of 
China, fossils of great pandas 
were discovered in Burma and 
Vietnam. Unfortunately, the radi-
cal change in climate proved fa-
tal to many families of pandas. 
The survivors fled to the moun-
tains and deep valleys in three 
Chinese provinces, Sichuan, 
Shanxi and Gansu, where they 
still live.
In your opinion, will being 
inscribed on the World Heritage 
List have direct consequences 
for the site? 
Certainly, because for a long time 
now, the giant pandas have been 
located in separate and scattered 
areas, or “islets”, where encounter 
and interaction between different 
groups is difficult. In this context, 
inbreeding is inevitable, which re-
sults in their having reduced ca-
pacity to adapt to environmental 
change, a lower reproductive rate 
and less resistance to disease.

Giant Panda of China .

List should allow us to gradually 
extend the giant panda zone to the 
mountains in Minshan, Liangshan, 
Xianglingshan and Qinling, to cre-
ate one single reserve. The giant 
pandas will then have the opportu-
nity to free themselves from these 
“islets” and the environment will be 
greatly improved. 
Aren’t you afraid that it will also 
cause an influx of tourists
to the reserve? 
I think not. In our reserve, an eco-
tourism programme allows us to 
limit the number of visitors. In ad-
dition, the size of the area open to 
visitors represents only 1% of the 
total surface of the reserve. And 
furthermore we are setting up an 
advisory committee of recognized 
experts in environment, tourism 
and land use, which will supervise 
eco-tourism development and con-
servation.
To what extent is the local 
population involved 
in protecting the site? 
The number of inhabitants on the 
reserve at present is 4,500. We 
have carried out an awareness 
campaign. For instance, we hired 
a number of people to participate 
in monitoring patrols and manage-
ment of forest lots. In parallel, we 
have encouraged farmers to prac-
tice off-season market gardening, 
to diversify their source of revenue 
and avert excessive use of moun-
tain resources – cutting down 
trees and hunting wild animals. 
Many trees and animals have been 
saved in this way, and the giant 
pandas’ habitat protected. And we 
have also developed eco-tourism 
in a pilot area. The idea was to 
encourage people who live in the 
mountains to come down into the 
valley to take advantage of tourism 
opportunities. In exchange, they 
pledge to restore their fields to 
their original condition, as natural 
forest or bamboo forest. 
What is your relationship 
to the giant panda? 
I love this animal. I obtained a 
degree in biology, specializing 
in animals, from the University 
of Sichuan in 1983, and my first 
job, for three years, was at a gi-
ant panda observation station. 
In 1987, when I was doing my 
Master’s degree at the University 
of Idaho, I realized that in-depth 
research was being devoted to 
many ordinary species, while 
research on the giant panda, a 
rare and precious species, was 
still in its embryonic stages in 
China. When I returned to China, 
I started research with the goal 
of increasing the reproductive 
rate of giant pandas living in cap-
tivity. The idea was to increase 
the population in groups of wild 
pandas. Some of the pandas we 
raised were released and now 
live in the wild. They seem to be 
living a normal life, but to reach 
any definite conclusion, we need 
a follow-up of careful study in the 
long term.
