◗ Head of UN E S C O’s Languages
D i v i s i o n
What’s the chief aim of international language
policy?
To promote trilingualism in every society.This is a
goal some countries achieved a long time ago.
L u xe m bu r g, for example. If you tell Luxe m bu r-
g e rs they can “afford the luxury ” of having three lan-
guages because they’re rich,they’ll tell you they’re
rich precisely because they’re rooted in tri l i n g u a l i s m .
What are these three languages we have to learn?
Our mother tongue,obviously, a “neighbour”lan-
guage and an intern ational language. UN E S C O’s
language policy replaces the standard idea of a
“foreign”language with the notion of a neighbour
l a n g u a g e , a language spoken just over the border.We
most often go to war against our neighbours , so we
h ave to learn their language, d i s c over their needs and
ambitions and know their culture and values.
Minority languages are meanwhile steadily
disappearing. How can they be saved?
A language is always in danger when it isn’t part
of the school curri c u l u m . Once it’s gi ven the stat u s
of a teaching language, e ven for just part of the cur-
ri c u l u m , a whole “rescue apparat u s ” is created and
the language becomes alive again and is save d .
Is monolingualism a handicap?
I t ’s always a gr e at disadva n t a g e . It means you only
see the world through the inevitably limited dimen-
sion of a single language, e ven if it’s a world language.
I t ’s also a factor of domination because people who
can afford to stay monolingual live in countries that
h ave overwhelming political, economic and military
p owe r. And it adds to “linguistic insecuri t y ” , a new
concept which reflects a ve ry old tru t h . E ven at
UN E S C O, we see it regularly at intern ational gat h e-
ri n g s. D e l e g ates who speak minority languages often
d o n ’t speak up.They have ve ry good ideas but don’t
dare to express them because they feel uncomfort a b l e
using UN E S C O’s official languages. People whose
mother tongue is an intern ational one are ve ry pri-
v i l e g e d .I t ’s quite unfa i r. ■
Interview by Araceli Ortiz de Urbina,
UNESCO Courier journalist
Is there a link between language policy and the
culture of peace?
Ye s ,t h e y ’re directly connected.When a minori t y
mother tongue comes under attack, its users feel
u n c o m f o rtable and experience an inner confli c t .A n d
when people aren’t at peace with themselves, they
c a n ’t be at peace with others. Languages are still the
only tools which allow us to communicat e — t o
relate to and understand each other—whether by
w ri t i n g, speaking or through the Intern e t .This idea
of focusing on languages as instruments of dia-
logue to tackle intolerance and violence has been the
d riving force behind UN E S C O’s Linguapax pro-
gramme (see box page 30) for more than 15 years.
Isn’t the international community very slow in
getting to grips with the language question?
I t ’s coming round to it. Sixty-nine countri e s
presented a draft resolution to the United Nations
General Assembly in December 1999 to promote
respect for multilingualism. UN E S C O’s General
Conference has just passed four resolutions backing
language dive rsity and multilingual educat i o n .T h e
European Union and the Council of Europe are
planning a European Year of Languages in 2001 with
UNESCO backing.This is a good example of inter-
national co-operation because it involves all lan-
g u a g e s , not just European ones. It will also mark the
start of many other projects around the world.
How do you explain this about-turn?
For several ye a rs now, the language question has
been high on the world education agenda. UN E S C O
member states are increasingly asking us to help
s o l ve ve ry complicated language problems and
i s s u e s. E u r o p e , along with Asia and Latin A m e-
rica, has realized that the third millennium will be
an era of co-operation and and confederation and
that the need to preserve identities will have to be
balanced with the demands of communication.
