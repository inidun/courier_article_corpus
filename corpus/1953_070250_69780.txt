THE PUBLIC LIBRARY...
P HOBABL Y fO\'most of usbooks and magazines are
such a common part of our
liyes that we have lost all sense of
wonder that we should hay daily
in our hands one of the most
amazing tools invented by civiliz-
ed man for his service. woe cannot
easily stand back and see in per-
spectin all the varied contribu-
tions which books make to our
enjoyment, our daily business,
our scientific and cultural ad-
vancement and our education
- nor is it easy, even for Unesco
which has a duty to do this, to
understand all the problems
which the making and distribu-
tion of books pose to the modern
world.
If we are lucky enough to live
in one of the countries where
books are abundant, it is difficult
to realize that in most countries
there is still a book famine, par-
ticularly at the two extremes of
book use, by children in schools
and by the scientists in their
research stations and laboratories.
If we live in these famine areas
it is equally hard to understand
that in many countries the most
difficult problems come not from
scarcity of books but from their
abundance. In these places the
daily problem for the scientist,
particuiarty, is not to find some-
thing to read but to find exactly
what he needs in the bewildering
mass of scientific literature.
To meet both the problems ofscarcity and abundance, one
of the simplest, most in-
genious and most universally
useful of all social institutions,
the library, has been invented.
Many thousands of years ago,
libraries were made, obviously
enough, to meet only a problem
of scarcity. They, were the
strongly defended fortresses of
recorded knowledge and even
now this characteristic of a great
historical library still survives.
But ever since the Renaissance,
libraries and the users af libraries
have been opening doors and
windows, letting light into the
dark storehouses, devising new
techniques not to preserve only
but to diffuse the knowledge
hidden in the pages of their mil-
lions of books and periodicals.
New kinds of libraries have
been created ; popular libraries
for ordinary men, women and
children to give them free access
to ever kind of literature for
entertainment, study and infor-
mation, and scientific libraries
with complex documentation
services so that everything-that a
research worker wants can be
instantaneously found for him
however old or however new.
'\7'ET, despite the wide accept-ance in theory of the impor-
tance of the public library
for education and recreation, the
fact is that almost nowhere in the
world is adequate library service
freely available to all the people.
In the United States, for
example, a searching public li-
brary enquiry completed in 1950
showed that while 20, 000, 000
people were library card holders,
5, 000, 000 (or approximately one-
fourth of the national population)
were without library services of
any kind. Even so, the United
States is well-on'for library ser-
vice as compared to most other
countries, with notable exceptions
such as Denmark, Sweden and
Great Britain.
If public libraries are essential
in technically advanced countries,
it seems that they would be a
hundred times more necessary in
under-developed regions-where
books and money to buy them are
extremelv scarce. In these re-
gions many people are learning
to read and write in vast pro-
grammes of fundamental edu-
cation. What use is it to teach
people to read if being literate
they have nothing to read or only
the strip cartoons and the trivial
but dangerous trash that can be
found even where there are no
good books at all ? Without libra-
ries, it is likely that much of the
good effect of mass education
programmes will be only ephe-
meral.
Why are so many areas
throughout the world'without
library service and why are the
existing libraries so poor ? The
elements of the problem are not
far to seek and are almost uni-
versally constant : (1) public apa-
thy. Most of the people have
never seen a library and conse-
quently do not know'wheat they
are missing. (2) Inadequate
financial support. In many
countries public libraries have
not yet found a place in the bud-
getary sun. (3) Lack of trained
librarians and an association of
librarians to promote library
development (4) A great short-
age of publications in locally
yvritten languages so the average
person can understand them.
No quick and easy solutions pf
these problems exist. However
there is evidence that govern-
ments are becoming increasingly
aware of the need for including
public libraries in plans for
educational development. The
tremendous public response to
demonstration projects in various
places has revealed a great and
unexpected latent demand for
public library services which
needs only to be awakened.
Some librarians who can in turn
train others are being developed
in countries'without library
schools. A few have received
fellowships for observation of
library practices abroad, others
are receiving on-the-job training
in demonstration projects, and a
fair number have participated in
seminars and conferences.
Finally, large-scale efforts are
being made in various parts of
the world to teach people to
read, and to produce publications
which they can read. All of this
adds up to something more than
the proverbial drop in the bucket,
but the pail is still far from full.
A NY government which plansto establish public library
services fortunately has a
century of experience at its dis-
posal. A vast literature on the
subject exists, and there are many
specialists willing to help with
advice. Consequently it is pos-
sible to avoid major mistakes.
For one thing, it should be
apparent that the creation of pub-
lic libraries cannot be left entire-
ly to local initiative. Needed are
national and regional plans,.
national and state library legisla-
tion and a system of grants-in-
aid to local units. All of this
clearly requires a fair amount of
money, and it is hardly likely
that libraries will be constructed
for a whole country at once.
However once a nation-wide plan
is drafted, a start can be made
with one unit designed to allow
for gradual extension of library
services in the future.
... A FORCE FOR POPULAR EDUCATION
UNESCO, the United Nationstj Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, has
been created by the'will of
46 countries. Its aim is to promote
peace, and social and spiritual
welfare by working through the
minds of men. The creative
power of Unesco is the force of
knowledge and international un-
derstanding.
This manifesto, by describing
the potentialities of the public
library, proclaims Unesco's belief
in the public library as a living
force for popular education and for
the growth of international under-
standing, and thereby for the pro-
motion of peace.
A democratic agency
The public library is a product
of modern democracy and a prac-
tical demonstration of democracv's
faith in universal education as a
life-long process. Though pri-
ffiarily intended to serve the edu-
cational needs of adults, the public
library should also supplement the
work of the schools in developlllg
the reading tastes of children and
young people, helping them to
become adults who can use books
with appreciation and profit. As a
democratic institution, operated by
the people for the people, the
public library should be :
Established and maintained
under clear authority of law.
Supported wholly or mainly
from public funds.
Open for free use on equal terms
to all members of the community,
regardless of occupation, creed,
class or race.
The complete public library
should provide-books, pamphlets,
magazines, newspapers, maps, pic-
tures, films, music scores and re-
cordings-and give guidance in
their use. The public library
should offer children, young peo-
ple. men and women opportunity
and encouragement :
To educate themselves conti-
nuously.
To keep abreast of progress in all
fields of knowledge.
To maintain freedom of expres-
sion and a constructively critical
attitude toward all public issues.
To be better social and political
citizens of their country and of the
world.
To be more efficient in their day-
to-day activities.
To develop their creative capa-
cities and powers of appreciation
in arts and letters.
To aid generally in the advance-
ment of knowledge,
To use their leisure time to pro-
mote personal happiness and social
well-being.
The people's university
The public library should be
active and positive in its policy
and a dynamic part of community
life. It should not tell people
what to think, but it should help
them decide what to think about.
The spotlight should be thrown
on significant issues by exhibi-
tions, booklists, discussions, leo-
tures, courses, films and individual
reading guidance. Reading inter-
est should be stimulated and the
library's services publicized
through a well-planned continuous
public relations programme. The
public library should link its ac-
tivities with the work of other
educational, cultural and social
agencies-the schools, universities,
museums, labour unions, study
clubs, adult education groups, etc.
H should also co-operate with
other libraries in the loan of pub-
lications and with library asso-
ciations for the advancement of
public librarianship. The books in
the library should be made acces-
sible on open shelves and by use
of efficient technical processes ;
and the library's services should be
brought close to the homes and
work places of the people by
means of branches and mobile
units.
With a well-trained, resourceful
and imaninative staff, and ade-
quate budget and public support, a
public library can become what it
should be-a university of the
people offering a liberal education
to all comers. Citizens of a demo-
cracy have need of such opportuni-
ties for self-education at all times.
The complexity and instability of
life today make the need an
urgent one.
