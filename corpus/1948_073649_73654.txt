who are concerned for the dign-
ity of Man and the future of
civilisation, particularly educa-
tionalists :, scientists, artists,
writer and journalists through-
out the world ;

pernicious idea that war is
inevitable ;

the conscience of the nations,
refusing collective suicide ;
to combat, by every means in
their power, surrender to fear
and every form of thought or
action which may threaten a
just and lasting peace.
