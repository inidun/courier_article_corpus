DAN BEHRMAN is a Unesco science writer well known to
"Unesco Courier" readers. He is the author of 'The New World
of the Oceans" (Little Brown and Co., Boston, U.S.A.) also
published in a paperback edition, and "In Partnership with Nature:
Unesco and the Environment" (Unesco, Paris, 1972). His latest
book, "The Man Who Loved Bicycles", was published last year by
Harper's Magazine Press, New York.
ERU's 10 million-ton-a-year
anchovy fishing industry, for years
the world's largest fishery, is today
threatened with collapse. Changes
in the movements of on ocean current
called El Niño are partly to blame.
In normal years, the cold Humboldt
Current of the eastern Pacific moving
north to the equator is driven offshore
by trade winds from the south-east.
When it moves away from the coast,
deep water wells up to replace it, bring¬
ing along nitrates and phosphates to
fertilize the growth of plant plankton.
The Peruvian anchovies graze on this
feast, swarming in such numbers that
they have made Peru the world's lead¬
ing fishing nation.
In abnormal years, the trade winds
weaken and warm water penetrates
down from the equator. The upwelling
stops, so does plant growth. The
anchovies fail to appear and the fisher¬
men return with empty holds.
The phenomenon is known as El
Niño (The Child) because It usually

occurs around Christmas time, the
summer season in the Southern Hemi¬
sphere. It struck most recently in 1972
with effects felt around the world.
The Peruvian anchovies are con¬
verted into fishmeal for animal feed.
Usually, they amount to two-fifths of
the world's fish meal production, but
the catch in 1972 dropped from 10 mil¬
lion to 4.5 million tons. Demand for
protein then drove up the price of
soya beans with widespread interna¬
tional economic and political reper¬
cussions.
Previously, the anchovies have
always returned following an El Niño.
In 1973, they did not come back in their
normal strength and the Peruvian
government closed the fishery in April.
No one really knows why the ancho¬
vies did not recover. A report by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Advisory Com¬
mittee on Marine Resources Research
states cautiously: "Most likely a com¬
bination of factors Is responsible. The
moderately low level of adult stock
resulting from heavy fishing can still
produce adequate offspring under av¬
erage or favourable conditions, but a
recruitment failure may occur when
environmental factors are poor."
The committee is not overly pessimis¬
tic: "Fortunately, throughout the period
of crisis, the Peruvian government has
kept catches at the lowest possible
level, thus minimizing the chances of
the Peruvian anchovy following the
Californian sardine and Atlanto-Scan-
dian (Norwegian) herring into commer¬
cial extinction."
Steps that could lead to an inter¬
national study of El Niño were voted
by the Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission at its eighth assembly
at Unesco House in Paris, in November
last.
The decision to focus scientific effort
into a study of the problem was taken
by the Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission when it adopted a
resolution submitted by Peru with the
support of Chile, Colombia and
Ecuador.
The resolution asks the Océanogra¬
phie Commission to organize, jointly
with FAO and the World Meteorolo¬
gical Organization, a "scientific work¬
shop" on El Niño, in a country within
the region in 1974. This meeting will
have a four fold purpose:
summarizing what Is now known
about El Niño-,
singling out the main questions
that must be answered if it is to be
understood and, most important of all,
predicted;
setting up a scientific research and
monitoring programme to solve these
problems with the "effective partici¬
pation" of countries belonging to the
International Océanographie Com¬
mission and FAO, particularly those
affected;
formulating proposals to study the
interaction between El Niño and the
region's biological resources.
These studies would be made as
part of the International Decade of
Ocean Exploration now under way.
