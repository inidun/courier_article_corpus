In Central Asia, cultural heritage policies have a single objective: to shore up
fragile national identities 
Culturally   
As the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia get down to post-
independence nat i o n - bu i l d i n g, a
major cultural issue has crystallized around
their attitudes to their past, which until
recently was designed and organized by
M o s c ow.The end of the Soviet system has
not taken the politics out of nat i o n a l
h e ri t a g e — far from it. It has actually led to
an excess of politicization as new relat i o n s h i p s
with the past have entrenched old ways of
thinking.
In the 1970s, intellectual elites in the
Central Asian republics were able to revive a
few selected aspects of their respective
n ational heri t a g e s. They were trying to do
t wo things: p r ovide historical justific ation for
the political borders established by Stalin
and prove the historical need for a deliberat e
fusion of the regi o n ’s peoples with their
Russian big brother.
To d ay, this framework is still the basis of
the new interp r e t ation of national history on
the fringes of the former Soviet Union.The
emergence of autonomous political
o r g a n i z ations in the late 1980s and the
d e c l a r ations of independence in 1991
simply reinforced the first aim and turn e d
the second upside dow n . L e gi t i m i z i n g
b o r d e rs is more important than eve r ,but now
as a means of confirming the break with
R u s s i a . At the same time, this recent
d e velopment incorp o r ates a wide range of
attitudes which va ry according to the specific
features of each national heritage and arise
from the political situation of five new stat e s
with sometimes divergent interests.
The main purpose of places of
remembrance is to provide focal points for
consensus. But the societies of Central Asia
are scarred by internal divisions inheri t e d
from a modern history riven with a host of
conflicts. So it would seem hard to promote
a sense of unity by referring to political fig u r e s
of the recent past.
For this reason,earlier history has been
brought into play, and those grey areas of
memory where the unwritten history of the
more recent past is stored have been pushed
a s i d e . The wealth of recent history wa s ,
h owe ve r ,d i s p l ayed in the Tashkent region of
Uzbekistan in 1996 during moving popular
c e l e b r ations held to mark the twe n t i e t h
a n n i ve rs a ry of the death of Ali Khan Tu r a
S a g h u n i , who led a resistance move m e n t
against the Red Army in the 1920s and then
t wenty ye a rs later headed a short - l i ve d
Muslim republic in easternTurkestan.
G r e at figures from medieval history serve
to recall the independent past of each form e r
S oviet republic, especially in relation to
R u s s i a , and its capacity to have its own healthy
political institutions.U z b e k i s t a n , for example,
which has gone far along the road to de-
Russification,has rehabilitated Amir Timur
(the Tamerlaine of medieval European
c h r o n i c l e rs ) ,who is presented not so much as
a conqueror as an epitome of the just ruler,
intent on maintaining social harmony.
M oves of this kind are sometimes frow n e d
upon by neighbouring states, which do not
a lways have fond memories of the “ i r o n
c o n q u e r o r ” . Some even see Uzbekistan’s
action as a bid for hegemony. One such case
is Ta j i k i s t a n , which was invented from scrat c h
in the late 1920s and is a largely Pe rs i a n -
speaking country whose national history is
based on glorifying resistance to the
inexorable spread of Turkish influence in
Central Asia.
Cultural history is not immune to

S t a l i n i z ation in the late 1950s,

A giant portrait of Tamerlaine in Taskhent.
c o m m e m o r ation of gr e at national figures of the
past began to revive all along the southern
edge of the Soviet Union.This pointed up the
uniqueness of each national culture, while at
the same time stressing the need to be united
with the Russian wo r l d . Because these gr e at
figures had to be apolitical and non-religi o u s ,
they were sought in literary history and oral
t r a d i t i o n .
The Middle Ages again came in ve ry
handy for this, but the modern period could
also be re-injected into official histori e s
through the use of “ c i v i l i z i n g ” figures (know n
as p r o s ve t i t e l i in Russian) drawn from
e i g h t e e n t h - c e n t u ry Russian cultural history
and from the ye a rs of Russian populism
b e t ween 1860 and 1870. In this way, t h e
r e f o rm movements which emerged in Ce n t r a l
Asia until the area was sovietized in the 1920s,
could be presented as the triumph of
enlightenment inspired by the Russian
example.
For example, after the death of Stalin, t h e
Kazakhs revived the mid-nineteenth-century
Kazakh writer Shokan Va l i k h a n ov,r e p u b l i s h i n g
p a rts of his work which made him look like a
pro-Russian intellectual. In the 1970s, t h e r e
was much talk of the “ c i v i l i z e r ” I b r a h i m
A l t i n s a ri n , a scholar of Kazakh and Cyri l l i c
s c ri p t .Since independence, the Kazakhs have
lionized to an even gr e ater extent the
intellectuals who between 1917 and 1919 led
the Alash Orda g ove rnment of prominent
figures from the steppes with close ties to
Russian anti-Bolshevik circles.
Pe rsistently forgotten,
h owe ve r , is the party know n
as the “Three Hundreds”
(Uch Juz) which,in the same
p e ri o d , spoke for the ri s i n g
middle class and the radical
intelligentsia of the towns of
the southern steppes. T h i s
piece of history is embarr a s s i n g, since U c h
J u z practised a kind of political Islam and
also allied itself with the Bolsheviks.
Another problem was that the radical
Kazakhs in Uch Juzadvocated cross-border
s o l i d a rity between Muslim peoples.To d ay
h owe ver it is unthinkable to question the
borders traced in the 1920s and 1930s.This
also explains the deliberate neglect of a fig u r e
like President Ali Khan Tura Saghuni—born
in To k m a k , in present-day Ky r g y z s t a n ,a c t i ve
in Uzbek Ferghana and in Xinjiang,and then
exiled to Tashkent—who still has followe rs
almost everywhere in Central Asia.
The desire by the new Central A s i a n
s t ates to make the bounds of their history,
over a shorter or
longer peri o d ,
coincide with a
geopolitical area
i n h e rited from the
Stalinist period gi ve s
rise to cert a i n
conceptual
d i s t o rt i o n s. T h e s e
are particularly apparent in the way in which
the new authorities are making their mark
on their country ’s physical appearance,
especially in the tow n s.Ancient monuments

are being restored and history textbooks
r e w ritten at a feve rish pace.The latest major
o p e r ations of this type were carried out with
gr e at pomp at Khiva and at Bukhara, t h e
2,500th annive rs a ry of whose foundat i o n
was celebrated by Uzbekistan in 1997.
All this shows the authori t i e s ’ c o n c e rn
for the distant past.Government ministries
in charge of heritage gi ve pri o rity to the roya l
architecture of the founding dynasties,
especially the T i m u rids or their immediat e
s u c c e s s o rs , e ven if this means neglecting
things which seem less prestigi o u s , or belong
to the more recent past and are therefore
more problemat i c.This seems to be the case
in Kazakhstan with the
r e s t o r ation of the mausoleum
of the eleve n t h - c e n t u ry
S h aykh Ahmad Ya s av i ,w h i c h
was undertaken jointly with
Turkey in 1992 and is typical
of the pan-Tu r k i s h
rapprochement which
followed independence.
The tombs of nat i o n a l
s a i n t s , which are often
symbols of unity, are being restored with
plenty of fa n fare and may also reflect a
r e gional strat i f i c ation of authori t y. I n
Ta j i k i s t a n , the restoration of the mausoleum
of Shaykh Muslih ad-Din, in Khoujand, wa s
c a rried out during perestroika, while the
Khoujandis still controlled the Ta j i k
communist party.Then the tomb of Shaykh
Yusuf Hamadani in Kulab was restored,a f t e r
the victory of the Kulabi militias in 1992.
Such operations also clearly have religi o u s
ove rt o n e s.They show a gove rn m e n t ’s desire
to keep an eye on the activities of the secret
brotherhoods, a valued rampart against the
gr owth of  Wa h h a b i s m , a strictly conservat i ve
Muslim movement that has recently arrived
in the region from Saudi Arabia and Pa k i s t a n .
The new Central Asian states are thus
taking over a pre-Soviet tradition of using for
political ends a despiritualized form of Sufi
brotherhood called “ i c h a n i s m ,” which is
traditionally opposed to fundamentalist
m ove m e n t s. One example of this is the Uzbek
a u t h o ri t i e s ’ c u rrent interest in the tomb of
the gr e at mystic Baha ad-Din Naqshband,
in Bukhara,and the government’s tolerance
of the posthumous cult which has grown up
around Ali Khan Tu r a , who until his death in
1976 even had many followe rs inside the
Uzbek communist party.
So the politicization of the cultural heri t a g e
is a crucial element in nat i o n - bu i l d i n g,
including the delicate question of borders. A
case in point is the more or less symbolic claims
of the Ta j i k
intelligentsia to Ta j i k
s overeignty over the
holy cities of
Samarkand and
B u k h a r a ,which have
been part of
Uzbekistan since the
S oviet authori t i e s ’
first ethno-terri t o ri a l
c a rve-up of Ce n t r a l
Asia in 1924.
But the rediscove ry of this heritage is
happening at several levels of awa r e n e s s ,
which are not always linked to each other by
a simple desire for logical coherence.
The official leve l , with its cult of gr e at
figures and monuments standing out against
the background of a distant past, i s
s u p e rimposed on a semi-official leve l
consisting of ideological experiments by
intellectuals.These two levels seem to have
little effect on the counter-culture or at least
on the informal approach developed by
people at the gr a s s r o o t s. O r d i n a ry citizens
remember in detail the recent and often
painful past and seem much less confused
about things than the ideological hesitat i o n s
of the new authorities might suggest. n
