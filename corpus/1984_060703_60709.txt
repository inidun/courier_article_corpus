THE STELLAR
MENAGERIE
Stars come in a bewildering variety. Some are thousands of
times brighter than the Sun, others shining feebly with only
a millionth the Sun's output of light. The largest stars, the
red giants, are several hundred times larger than the Sun. At
the other end of the scale, the smaller stars fall into families
that are increasingly bizarre. White dwarfs are only one-
hundredth the size of the Sun, neutron stars are smaller still,
and black holes are so condensed that the star itself is in¬
visible, and only its gravitational field betrays its presence.
Underlying this diversity, however, there is a very simple
pattern. It is a matter only of a star's mass and of its age.
Heavier stars produce more energy, and so are generally
brighter and hotter than less-massive stars. The differences
in size are due to ageing. The Sun, for example, will swell in¬
to a red giant, and then collapse to become a white dwarf.
As we look around the sky we observe stars of all ages, and
hence representing the whole gamut of possible stellar types.
