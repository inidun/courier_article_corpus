The suffering caused 
by Hurricane Mitch and
the financial tempests
rattling the global
economy bring new
reasons to lighten the
debt of the poorest
countries
■
The deva s t ation wrought by
Hurricane Mitch in November was
horrific. In three days, the hurricane
wiped out 20 years of development in the
region, according to UN agencies, leaving
thousands of people dead and reportedly
about three million homeless.
But as gove rnments and intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z ations tried to mobilize funds for
relief effort s , another debate reared its head:
should Nicaragua and Honduras, both low
i n c o m e ,h e avily indebted countries badly hit
by Hurricane Mitch, continue to pay a total
of $2 million a day in debt repay m e n t s —
money which could provide temporary
housing for 800,000 people?
The British Secretary of State for
I n t e rn ational Deve l o p m e n t , Clare Short ,
s t ated early on that debt relief was “ a n
i rr e l e va n c e ” when the pri o rity lay in
avoiding cholera and “pulling people out
of the mud”. But a few days lat e r
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown called on all creditors to support a
t wo - year morat o rium on debt serv i c e
payments.
This shift in thinking reflects a gr ow i n g
realization as to just how bad things have
gotten for the wo r l d ’s poorest nat i o n s. S i n c e
at least the mid-1990s, a few deve l o p i n g
countries have simply stopped servicing a
large portion of  their debts—that is pay i n g
the interest and principal on loans. T h e
reason is simple: their gove rnments are
e f f e c t i vely bankru p t . Mozambique and
Nicaragua are only able to pay a third of
their scheduled debt service (the amount
of repayments on all loans).For Nicaragua,
this fraction amounts to $221 million a
year—three times that which the
government spends on health.

states
By 1996, it was clear even to the wo r l d ’s
major creditors that something had to be
d o n e . When middle or high income
c o u n t ries like Brazil, Jordan or Russia have
run into problems managing their debts,
the standard approach has been to
reschedule or push back their serv i c e
p ayments through agreements generally
brokered by multilateral organizations like
the Intern ational Monetary Fund (IMF)
o r , in the case of commercial lending, b y
the Pa ris Club, an informal group of
creditor gove rnments with a perm a n e n t
secretariat in the French Treasury.
But loan rescheduling cannot solve the
problems of the poorest countri e s. T h e i r
financial crises have been so extreme that
they generally manage to service just half of
their total debts.
The World Bank proposed the HIPC
( H e avily Indebted Poor Countri e s )
I n i t i at i ve in 1996 (see box ) . The aim wa s
to enable poor countries to get a more
secure financial footing. This was “ g o o d
news for the poor,” according to the bank
p r e s i d e n t , James Wo l f e n s o h n . “ T h i s
i n i t i at i ve is a breakthrough . . . It deals with
debt in a comprehensive way to gi ve
c o u n t ries the possibility of exiting from
unsustainable debt.”
Under the HIPC Initiat i ve , c r e d i t o rs
a gree to share the burden of cutting debts
including for, the first time, t h o s e
stemming from World Bank and

Debt re l i e f:
a creditable solution?

manage a debt and the creditors cut their
p o rtions respective l y. A list of 41 countri e s
has been drawn up, identifying when and
h ow much debt relief should be expected.
It is estimated that another 25 countri e s
will eventually be added to the list.
H owe ve r , the plan looks better on paper
than in practice. In short , the HIPC
i n i t i at i ve delive rs too little, too lat e ,
according to critics and non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations campaigning for Third Wo r l d
debt relief. Only two countri e s , U g a n d a
and Bolivia, h ave had their debts lightened,
while another five are slated for assistance
in 1999. O t h e rs like Tanzania and Ethiopia
cannot expect anything until 2002.
In understanding the HIPC
s h o rt c o m i n g s , it is important to remember
t h at many of the poorest countries have
long been paying less than half the
scheduled debt serv i c e .I t ’s a bit like hav i n g
t wo loans, but only being able to pay
interest on the second one. If the bank
w rites off the first loan, your bank balance
will look better, but your payments on the
second loan continue, so you do not gain
a ny additional benefit s.
Consider the case of Uganda, the first
country to benefit from HIPC.Under  the
i n i t i at i ve , its total debt has been reduced
by just 11 per cent.The story is the same for
Mozambique, due to receive relief in June
1 9 9 9 . Although the country ’s total debt
(about $5.8 billion in 1996) will drop by
$1.4 billion, much of this is
“ u n r e c ove r a b l e ” debt—meaning debt the
g ove rnment wa s n ’t expected to repay
regardless of HIPC.
M o z a m b i q u e ’s debt service will only
fall from $112 million a year to $100
m i l l i o n , a saving equivalent to about 80
cents per capita.
While reducing total debt is important
to keep a country’s books looking healthy,
the key to finding new resources to invest in
education or health services, for example,
lies in cutting those debts that countri e s
actually service and not those considered
unrecoverable.
For Jean-Louis Sarbib,World Bank vice
p0resident for Africa, HIPC is “not really
about wiping off debt . . . It’s just making
sure that these countries can remain good
credit risks. . . .The idea of HIPC is in fact
to allow you to continue to be a good
financial citizen of the world community.”
But why not simply write off the debts
and service payments to offer a  fresh start to
poor countries? G. G o n d we , D e p u t y
Director of the IMF’s A f rican Depart m e n t
outlined some key concerns in the F i n a n c i a l
Ti m e s in August 1998: “Who would lend
again to recipients of such cancellat i o n ?
W h at guarantee is there that the money
s aved would be put to effective use?”
G o n d we is referring to the fa m i l i a r
argument of moral hazard: w riting off debts
and service payments will reduce the
incentive to better manage finances in the
future and may worsen already poor credit
ratings.This argument is valid when loans
h ave been made for sound economic
i nve s t m e n t s. But what about money loaned
not pri m a rily for investment reasons, bu t
r ather for political reasons to win allies or to
increase foreign exports? 
There is no scarcity of cases of
politically motivated lending. P r e s i d e n t s
Marcos of the Philippines, S u h a rto of
Indonesia and Mobutu Sese Seko of the
former Zaire were all grateful recipients of
loans from the We s t . Nicaragua and
Mozambique were equally well supported
by the former Soviet Union. Ve ry little
attention was paid to how the money was
used or abused.
“ O n e - fifth of all developing country
debt consists of loans gi ven to prop up
compliant dictat o rs ,” insists Jo s e p h
H a n l o n ,p o l i cy officer with the Jubilee 2000
C o a l i t i o n , which regroups NGOs,

r e l i e f. “But when the dictat o rs fa l l , it is
expected that their democratically elected
s u c c e s s o rs should repay those debts.
Lenders must take a much greater share of
the responsibility and accept the losses.”
Popular pressure
for debt cancellation
There is another key question: who will
b e n e fit from debt relief? There is a genuine
concern that blanket debt relief will not be
used to reduce pove rty and improve
e d u c ation or sanitation systems.
D e m o c r a cy is still young in many
d e veloping countri e s. M a ny don’t have
official watchdogs or independent media
strong enough to examine gove rn m e n t
policy.
For the World Bank, the solution lies in
linking debt relief to strict adherence to
IMF structural adjustment policies.
Tanzania and Ethiopia, for example, h ave

suffered from delays in relief because they
did not make the  adjustments deemed
n e c e s s a ry. But does such macro-economic
adjustment ensure that the poor will 
b e n e fit ?
O x fam argues that additional “ h u m a n ”
measures must be put in place.The Bri t i s h
NGO proposes that for every dollar saved
through debt relief, the gove rnment spends
an equivalent amount on health, e d u c at i o n
and sanitat i o n . Although criticized for
encroaching on the decision-making powe r
of gove rn m e n t s , this approach has the
a d vantage of reassuring creditors that debt
relief will not be wasted.

d e velopment pers p e c t i ve is essentially
ignored by creditors. However, the World
Bank has agreed to review the HIPC
I n i t i at i ve this ye a r. Instead of waiting for
a ny major changes, the gove rnments of
N o r way, Finland and Japan have decided to
begin canceling debts independently.
Two fa c t o rs help explain this
m o m e n t u m . F i rs t , popular pressure is
gr ow i n g . In May 1998, for example, 7 0 , 0 0 0
people formed a human chain around the
l e a d e rs attending the G8 summit in
B i rmingham (UK). S e c o n d l y, the prospect
of global economic recession is forcing
creditors to change their way of thinking.
The financial crashes in East Asia and
Russia sent shock waves around the
i n t e rn ational financial community. T h e
frantic bailouts of South Korea,Thailand,
Indonesia and Russia have pressed the IMF
to come to the rescue with over $140 billion
in finance.
The current climate of recession has
highlighted the reasons for raising the calls
for poor country debt relief. It is difficult to
believe claims made by creditors that they
cannot afford further debt relief.The HIPC
I n i t i at i ve for the poorest would cost just $8
billion—a pittance compared to the billions
a l l o c ated to push back the debt payments of
middle income countri e s. Ja p a n , f o r
e x a m p l e , which is far deeper in recession
than European or North A m e ri c a n
c o u n t ri e s , has managed to cancel $500
million wo rth of debts owed by deve l o p i n g
countries.
Canceling effectively unpayable debts
owed by the poorest countries may turn out
to be a sensible policy for all creditors. As
well as the strong moral argument for debt
r e l i e f, there could be sound fin a n c i a l
