Going for glory

Under the mid-morning sun at Chungnam
N ational Unive rsity in Ta e j o n , South Korea, 1 2 -
year-old Dong-whee Choi is hitting baseline
forehands weighted with topspin and punchy two-
handed backhands to a player twice his age from the
u n i ve rsity team.With the snow-capped mountains
of Kyerong-san in the distance, Choi is hard at
t r a i n i n g, filling the days of winter va c ation on sand
courts.
Like many other children his age, Choi has
dreams of athletic wo n d e r. But unlike the vast majo-
ri t y, he is on the path to realizing his dreams, a l o n g
with those of his fa m i l y, coach and, perhaps one day,
those of his country.
Choi is going to Bradenton, F l o ri d a ,a c c o m p a-
nied by his coach and his 10-year-old sister Ha-ya n g,
thanks to a five-year scholarship from the interna-
tionally renowned Nick Bollettieri ’s Tennis A c a-
d e my.At Bollettieri ’s , which boasts alumni including
many of Choi’s heroes—such as tennis greats Pete
Sampras and André Agassi—Choi will find the
competition and training facilities he needs to meet
his soaring aspirations. He will also face unprece-
dented pressure at what is often described as a
“boot camp” where nothing less than winning is
accepted—an approach which he seems to relish.
Six hours a day on the court
“My first goal is to win the U. S . Open and I wa n t
to be at least one of the top-five ranked playe rs in the
world,” says the winsome youth, his demureness
m o m e n t a rily dissipated by his fervour for the sport .
“ I ’ ve never considered how long it’s going to take to
happen.I never think about my age.”
Children like Choi, so strangely determ i n e d ,
e voke admiration but also a nagging concern that
they have been pressured to succeed by aggr e s s i ve
p a r e n t s. Some might also question the wisdom of let-
ting such a young child invest so much towa r d s
such a distant goal.Yet as Choi’s experience high-
l i g h t s , it could be even more difficult for a parent to
tell a child:“ G i ve up your dreams of glory.”
Choi was first introduced to tennis at the age of
three when his fat h e r , In-chul Choi, a lieutenant-
colonel in the South Korean military and a keen
tennis playe r , bought him a toy racket.At six, he gr a-
d u ated to a real racket, p l aying regularly with his
fat h e r.While his parents say they initially intended
for Choi to enjoy the sport recreat i o n a l l y, they lat e r
sought to develop the boy ’s apparent potential by
h i ring 45-year-old Choong-sup Song as coach in
1 9 9 4 . “He wa s n ’t so gr e at at firs t ,” s ays Song. “ B u t
he was so hard-working and he has such a strong will
for someone his age. H e , his parents and myself all
h ave the same goal now.”
T h at goal has made Choi’s life anything bu t
o r d i n a ry. In Korea’s Confucian-influenced society,
where academic endeavour and success is a ve ri t a b l e
litmus test of social worth,most youngsters spend
hours a day studying in private educational insti-
t u t e s , supplementing their regular studies.Yet Choi
spends the bulk of his time on the court—about six
hours a day, seven days a week.“Sometimes I find
it diffic u l t ,” he say s , “especially when I can’t hit
the ball well, but aside from that that I just enjoy it
and have fun.”
National heroes
C h o i ’s work ethic earned him an inv i t ation to the
1998 Orange Bow l , an intern ational tournament in
M i a m i ,F l o ri d a . He took first prize from a field of 128
of the wo r l d ’s top 12-ye a r - o l d s.While in Flori d a ,h e
also aced Bollettieri ’s tennis school eva l u ation test for
the scholarship before signing a contract with IMG
( I n t e rn ational Management Group),which manages
the careers of many of the wo r l d ’s top at h l e t e s.
When the news in Florida reached Korea, the
young player and his family were deluged by inter-
view requests from the media. The reaction to
C h o i ’s early success, which would go largely unno-
ticed in many other countri e s , comes as little surp ri s e
in Korea,where athletes who excel on the interna-
tional stage are a source of intense admiration and
pride. Los Angeles Dodger pitching ace Chan-ho
Park and golfer Se-ri Pak, the 1998 Ladies’ Pro-
fessional Gold Association (LPGA) Rookie of the
Ye a r , are nothing less than national heroes in
K o r e a — e xe m p l a rs of excellence, p a rticularly in
these morale-hungry times of economic crisis.
While the future looks rosy for Choi, w h at of the
chances of him breaking his wrist or caving in to the
mounting psychological pressure? W h at then? T h e s e
questions aren’t recognized by Choi and his parents.
I n s t e a d , they voice their trust in Choi’s coach,
S o n g, who refuses to consider anything except posi-
tive outcomes.
“I’m doing what I really want to do,” s ays Choi.
“My coach says it’s better if I can play we l l , but that
I shouldn’t have pressure on me,and my parents just
tell me to do my best. . . . Since I was a little kid, I ’ ve
never had any other dreams except being a tennis
player and now I am so happy.” n
