Thai boxing fans 
are hooked on gambling 
as much as the niceties of
their favourite sport
n
For the past 20 ye a rs , Sialek Chanarak,a 53-ye a r -
old shop-ow n e r , has spent nearly eve ry Fri d ay
night at Bangkok’s Lumpini Stadium, one of
T h a i l a n d ’s two top arenas for Muay T h a i , or T h a i
k i c k b ox i n g .“I don’t like box i n g,” Sialek insists as he
leafs through a wad of baht,T h a i l a n d ’s curr e n cy. “ I
come to gamble. If there was no gambling here, I
would never come.”Sialek is not alone. Of the 10,000
people who jam into the ramshackle stadium,n e a r l y
all are betting on the battles in the ri n g .“Only the tou-
rists don’t bet,” Sialek say s , pointing to the ri n g s i d e
s e ats occupied by Japanese and European visitors.
M a ny of the foreign women are cri n ging as the
b oxe rs pummel each other, d i g ging knees into their
opponents groins and launching rapid-fire kicks
cracking against skin and bone.
M u ay  Thai is T h a i l a n d ’s national sport .A mart i a l
competition developed from the hand-to-hand combat
techniques of ancient Siamese soldiers , it seems similar
at first to intern ational box i n g .F i g h t e rs wear gloves for
three-minute rounds held in boxing ri n g s.After that ,
the similarities end. K i c k i n g, kneeing and elbow i n g
your opponent are all legal, as is pushing and throw i n g
him to the canva s.Then there is the music: a three-
piece band comprised of dru m s , cymbals and the
j ava pipe plays frenetic, ancient Thai battle music to
urge the fig h t e rs on.
A fatal
attraction
M u ay Thai has been deemed so integral a part of
Thai character that the National Culture Commis-
sion ove rsees its promotion. The Ministry of Edu-
c ation runs a Muay Thai Institute to teach the intri-
cacies of the sport . And the army runs Lumpini
Stadium and the World Muay Thai Council, t h e
s p o rt ’s gove rning body. But Muay Thai pales in
p o p u l a rity beside another national pastime: g a m-
b l i n g . Simply put,Thais love to bet. Police have esti-
m ated that billions of baht are wagered by T h a i s
each week on English Premier League Fo o t b a l l
a l o n e .U n d e r ground casinos operate with impunity
in Bangkok.And the country ’s most famous Buddhist
monk attracts thousands of devotees who believe
t h at if he whacks them on the head with a rolled up
n e w s p a p e r , they might win the national lottery.
S t i l l , millions of Thai boys and young men have
a passion for MuayThai.Like boxing anywhere,it
provides a flickering hope they can fight their way
out of pove rt y.A major match at Lumpini can earn
100,000 baht, or about $2,500, with boxe rs fig h t i n g

on average once a month. A purse that size is a
f o rtune to the young fa rm e rs and fa c t o ry hands
dreaming of kicking their way out of hardscrabble
fields or the squalor of Bangkok’s slums. But it’s
nothing compared to the money changing hands in
the stands at Lumpini and other stadiums.
“ I ’ ve won as much as 800,000 baht (over $20,000)
on one fig h t .But I also once lost a million ($27,000),”
s ays Chat ri Kanchanamanoon, the 50-year-old ow n e r
of a gold shop. But Chat ri ’s losses are relat i vely mild
compared to that of his best fri e n d .“He bet a huge sum
of money and he got too excited,”s ays Chat ri .“He wa s
c h e e ring his fighter and suddenly fell on the flo o r.H e
had a heart attack and died.”
Most bets these day s ,h owe ve r ,a r e n ’t as heart - s t o p-
pingly large since the country ’s economy crashed in
July 1997.And the gambling fatalities are not all from
n atural causes. C h at ri says that some gamblers who
c o u l d n ’t pay their debts have been killed.
As the fighters knee and elbow each other,
screaming fans stand atop wooden benches or surge
against the green chain link fences that separate the
different ticket sections. I t ’s in between rounds,
though, that the action really heats up. While the
boxers catch their breath, the gamblers wave their
a rms and wiggle their fin g e rs in an intri c ate system
of signals that lets the bookies know how much
they want to bet on which fighter at what odds.
There is a slim minority of fans like Paisan Phak-
d e e s u n t h o rn , who abstain from betting.“I like Muay
T h a i ,” s ays the 32-year-old civil serva n t , adding that
he used to fight as a teenager.“I don’t have money to
wa s t e ,” he say s , on the “bad habit” of betting. Pa i s a n
c h e e rs on the boxe rs , but like so many other fa n s ,h e
d o e s n ’t have a favo u rite fig h t e r. Paisan seems too
wrapped up in the sport to focus solely on the career
of a single boxe r.G a m b l e rs like Sialek agr e e .“ You can’t
h ave a favo u ri t e . . . .T h at would only interfere,”he say s.
“ You have to bet with your head, not your heart .” n

For Thai boys, learning 
the basics of Muay Thai 
is part of growing up.
“ T h e re are people wh o
think that wrestling is
an ignoble sport.
W restling is not sport,
it is a spectacl e, and it
is no more ignoble to
attend a wre s t l e d
p e r fo rmance of
s u f fe ring than a
p e r fo rmance of the
s o rrows of A rnolphe or
A n d ro m a q u e.”
