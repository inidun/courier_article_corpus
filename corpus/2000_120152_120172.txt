Two and a half hour’s dri ve through A u s t r a l i a ’s
dense bush north of Sydney, coloured lights
pulse on the crest of a hill as the low rumble of
bass creeps across the immense forest.At the height
of summer, the bush surrounding Byron Bay is alive
with underground techno eve n t s.A far cry from the
r e gimented and often alienating world of clubs that
electronic music in Sydney and other major cities
h ave become captive to, these events offer an escape
from city life and a dose of social politics.The open
space seemingly provides the freedom needed for a
c r e at i ve mix of artistic and political action. But the
flow of foreign tourists may arrest the scene’s deve l-
o p m e n t .
To some extent, t o u rism is at the ori gin of the
local techno scene. Building on the history of gay
dance parties which thri ved in Sydney from the early
1 9 8 0 s , B ritish tourists began bri n ging new music
and ideas in 1989 on the back of the UK rave explo-
s i o n .They organised underground events using the
same tactics to evade police at home: l ow-key adve r-
tising and venues announced by phone number on
the night.They also began setting up import record
stores and became leading DJs.But by 1991-2, l o c a l s
had taken ove r. E ve ry we e k e n d , four or more eve n t s
could each draw several thousand people.
Meanwhile,The Vibe Tribe—a loose group of
f o rmer punks, s q u at t e rs and community activists—
began holding free parties in Sydney’s public spaces
to blend grassroots community activism with the
energy and futurism of rave culture. They also
began setting up fundraisers for va rious progr e s-
s i ve community organizations while forgi n g

alliances with local environmental groups to high-
light issues such as indigenous land rights,the loss
of public space to pri vate interests, and nuclear dis-
a rm a m e n t . Electronic music was integr ated into
e ve rything from community festivals to part y -
aligned protest events such as “Reclaim T h e
S t r e e t s ” in Sydney: multiple soundsystems we r e
wheeled out at major road intersections, drawing
thousands of spontaneous reve l l e rs to highlight the
environmental effects of the automobile industry.
But by 1995, r e p r e s s i ve regulations and police
raids forced the raves off the streets and into the con-
trolled confines of clubs.The Vibe Tribe disbanded
and some leading members like Kol Diamond we n t
to Byron Bay,where environmental alliances had been
forged by other collectives like Electric T i p i .“ O ver the
last twenty ye a rs or so Byron has become ve ry much
the nerve centre of ‘ a l t e rn at i ve lifestyling’‚ in this coun-
t ry,” explains Diamond. “The va rious feral subcul-
tures and capitalist Greenies mix freely with New A g e
g u ru s.They sit lazily in Bohemian cafes discussing the
politics of making money and genetically modifie d
s oya beans whilst surfing the days away… The local
council is Green [part y ] , the local newspaper is heav-
ily anti-development and critical of large corp o r at e
bu s i n e s s e s , and it seems like the whole town and sur-
rounding areas have in common a desire to keep the
Big Mac out of town and keep low - d e n s i t y, l ow - i m p a c t
d e velopment as the main strat e g y, largely because
Byron Bay is totally dependent on touri s m .”
Diamond helped to cultivate the cultural land-
scape by setting up recording studios and a local record

C h ris Gibson, a lecturer in geogr a p hy at the
U n i ve rsity of New South Wales and avid rave r ,
spent six months in Byron Bay to map the music
s c e n e ’s internal politics and its position in a net-
work of global music exchange.“There is an ongo-
ing debate in Byron about whether to tap into the
backpacker market or remain locally focused,”s ay s
Gibson.“The issue here is whether local political
imperatives are necessarily compatible with a less
p o l i t i c a l l y - s p e c i fic global trance music mentality
associated with backpacker tourism.”
Take the case of local DJs fundraising for a for-
est blockade. Are backpackers really interested in
the forest or just attracted by the “ a l t e rn at i ve ”
nature of the event? Will local events become over-
shadowed by larger, purely musical ones with the
drawcard of DJs from the global trance scene?
Diamond is less concern e d .“ M aybe this was the
risk four ye a rs ago when a ve ry tight crew of [inter-
n ational] trance DJs and promoters hit this area ve ry
suddenly and in a rather calculated move ,” he say s.
“They were looking for a new foothold with which to
exploit their corp o r ate agendas.Byron quickly became
ve ry fashionable to visit but it was always ve ry expen-
s i ve to live in compared to Thailand and India, so only
those who actually did desire a more altern at i ve eco-
f riendly way staye d .”
The debate over tourism is now spilling beyo n d
the music community to fuel a conflict with local
a u t h o ri t i e s. Tensions erupted over plans for a
techno Millennium Eve . According to Diamond,
“three techno parties were threatening to at t r a c t
more people and more attention than the tow n ’s
official celebrations.”
Tourist dollars
To begin with, the local council does n o t m a k e
a ny money from the free-spirited bush part i e s.
S e c o n d , these bri n g - yo u r - own-booze events tend
to draw large crowds away from bars and ve n u e s
in tow n .The rave crackdown in Sydney (1995) wa s
largely due to pressure from the alcohol industry.
So it was not a total surp rise to find “police harass-
ment at the parties all throughout the night,” a s
Diamond descri b e s , “from set-up to dawn leading
to the confiscation of equipment and charges
being laid.” For Diamond, the crackdown repre-
sented the council’s decision “to put the touri s t
dollar before the artistic desires of the local com-
m u n i t y.”
With the party season quieting down over the
colder months, Byron crews are waiting to see how
the political climate develops. Meanwhile,Organ-
a r c hy is working to release more music from Byron
locals to reinforce artistic and political indepen-
d e n c e . “All struggle is local,” s ays Diamond,
“ g l o b a l - a nything [music industry, t o u ri s m , e t c. ]
reeks straight away of something to be consumed in
large doses…”. ■
