‘Iwish I could listen to O x y - Je u n e s, P i k i n e ’s
community radio stat i o n , while I’m at work bu t
we can’t get it here in Dakar,” s ays Babacar, a
young garage mechanic who works in the Senega-
lese capital but lives out in the suburb of Pikine.
When you tell him there are plenty of radio stat i o n s
in Dakar, all broadcasting music and news, h e
replies with a laugh: “ Ye s , but they don’t say enough
about the place where I live.”
P i k i n e , an enormous suburban settlement with
1.15 million inhabitants, was officially declared a
t own not long ago.Each day, thousands of people pour
out of it to try to make a living in the “ i n f o rmal sector”
in Dakar. Pove rt y - s t ricken Pikine is where migr a n t s
from the countryside end up, but it’s also known for
the richness of its community life and the energy of its
young people.
When the people of Pikine set up Radio Oxy-Je u n e s
( “ Je u n e s ”means young people in French), they came
up against the tough world of Senegal’s bu r e a u c r at i c
j u n g l e .They drafted a proposal with the help of Fo ru m
Je u n e s s e, a non-gove rnmental organization (NGO)



S e n e g a l: O x y - J e u n e s is 
in the air!
◗ Abou Ya y o b a
Young people in a poor suburb of Dakar fought hard to get a radio fre q u e n c y.
Since their station started broadcasting in June 1999, it has given many ordinary citizens 
a chance to speak their mind
◗ Dakar-based journalist
which has several thousand members in Senegal and
is backed by the World A s s o c i ation of Community
Radio Broadcasters and a Canadian NGO,the Cat h o-
lic Organization for Development and Pe a c e .For three
ye a rs , they wrote letters galore, hung about for hours
at the ministry of communications and even resort e d
to scribbling gr a f fiti on the walls of Dakar.
Until recently, the authorities only issued FM
broadcasting licences to foreign stations such as Radio
France Intern ational and A f rica Number One and to
S e n e g a l e s e - owned commercial stat i o n s.They made a
lot of money because the stations were forced to pay
an annual fee of several thousand dollars. H owe ve r ,
u n d e rresourced local community stations had little
chance of getting official approva l . Until recently,
there was only one community radio station in Senegal.
But in June 1999, a young man from Pikine
boldly cut his way through this thicket of restri c t i o n s.
When he shook President Abdou Diouf’s hand at
the inauguration of Dakar’s new stadium, he seized
the opportunity to say :“Mr President, young people
are still waiting for their radio frequency so they can

make themselves heard on the airwave s ! ” T h i s
simple sentence did the trick.
The president responded at once by asking his
prime minister to give the matter top priority.The
next day, the people at Forum Jeunesse received a
s u m m o n s , d e l i vered by a motor-cy c l i s t , to go to
the gove rn m e n t ’s main administration bu i l d i n g,
the citadel of the bu r e a u c r a cy.When they got there,
they were told they could use the frequency 103.4.
From then on they were on their own!
To d ay, the O x y - Je u n e s transmitter is a fa m i l i a r
sight to all the inhabitants of Pikine. It stands on the
roof of the Léopold Sédar Senghor Cultural Centre,
an imposing building that houses the municipal
g ove rnment and several community gr o u p s. P hy s i c a l
p r oximity to the local authorities does not seem to
wo rry the 50 or so vo l u n t e e rs from community orga-
n i z ations who run the stat i o n . The radio gi ves the
t own authorities a hand by broadcasting offic i a l
announcements of general interest, but it carefully
defends its independence. “O x y - Je u n e s is clearly not
in the authori t i e s ’ p o c k e t ,” s ays opposition MP
Amadou Yoro Sy.
The station broadcasts 40 hours of progr a m m e s
a we e k .Within six months it had established itself
as a forum of opinions focused on life in Pikine and
the concerns of its inhabitants. Its recipe is simple.
The producers gi ve the floor to listeners and allo-
c ate plenty of air time to social and political dis-
c u s s i o n .The titles of the programmes are reve a-
ling—“Mbedd mi” (the street),“ B l a - B l a ”( p o l i t i c a l
s atire) and “ Fadiou T h i o s s a n e ” (traditional hea-
l i n g ) .The stat i o n ’s aims are to gi ve a plat f o rm to
m a r ginalized people, strengthen grassroots and com-
munity organizations,get people involved in deve-
lopment and raise civic awareness.
The different communities in Pikine soon reali-
zed how useful O x y - Je u n e s could be in getting
through to politicians and bu r e a u c r at s , and also in
c o m m u n i c ating with each other. All Senegal’s lan-
guages can be heard on the station—French is only
gi ven 20 per cent of air time—and all the country ’s
ethnic groups have access to it. For example, s ay s
O x y - Je u n e s c o o r d i n ator Oumar Ndiaye Seck, “ t h e
nearly one million Peulh-Fuutas people from
Guinea who live in this country no longer have to
send their announcements to Radio Labé in
Guinea because they have no outlet in Senegal.”
O x y - Je u n e s has knocked a few local politicians off
their pedestals.When they answer listeners ’q u e s t i o n s ,
they come across as ordinary citizens,accountable to
the people who voted for them. In a country bu i l t
around traditional hierarchical relationships and poli-
tical favo u ri t i s m , this kind of awakening has not come
e a s i l y.
The prefect of Pikine distri c t , Cheikh T i d i a n e
N d oye , points out that “the most popular pro-
grammes are those in which mayo rs and local offic i a l s
are invited to speak directly to the listeners.” T h e
highly popular local news bu l l e t i n , which presents an
hour of news “about Pikine for Pikine”, is an oppor-
tunity for grassroots Pikine to bring its struggles for
s u rv i val to the attention of offic i a l d o m .
P i k i n e ’s citizens, especially the younger ones,m a k e
no bones about reminding officials of broken election
promises and demanding explanat i o n s.They also use
the station to get decision-makers to promise to pro-
vide basic social serv i c e s.They realize that asking for a
public drinking fountain in a poor area by cleve r l y
using colloquial language is much more effective in a
society with an oral tradition than sending letters that
supposedly get lost in the mayo r ’s offic e .
Publicity about O x y - Je u n e s’ a c h i e vements is
causing a few problems.“ W h at about us?” s ay other
communities which have seen nothing come their
way.This increases the pressure on the station and
on local offic i a l s , who often cannot deliver the
goods. And this pressure is increasing.
Scrambling for funds
“There’s too much music and not enough dis-
cussion on Oxy-Jeunes,” say members of the eco-
nomic pressure group Bok Xalat (“shared vision”),
who also complain that few of the programmes are
presented by women.
Another big problem is the lack of trained pre-
senters and the paucity of resources.The manage-
ment would like to have a core of paid professionals,
but it has no money to hire them.It is also waiting
anxiously for the end of the stat i o n ’s first year to see
if it will have to pay the $3,200 licence fee which is
c o m p u l s o ry for community radio stations but which
it cannot afford.
The future is financially uncert a i n . T h e

p r ovided some $63,000 to buy equipment and pro-
vide basic training for several presenters.The gr a s s-
roots groups which ask for air time are usually so
poor that it is unrealistic to expect them to contri-
bu t e . There is also fierce competition for aid from
i n t e rn ational organizations such as UNICEF and
from national bodies that subsidize some radio sta-
tions on a one-off basis to support health campaigns
and the like. More professional pri vate commercial
s t ations with bigger audiences are also after this
kind of funding.
After six months on the air, O x y - Je u n e s k n ow s
it cannot live off the three awards it won at the
Radio Fe s t i val (Fe s t i val des Ondes) in Bamako
(Mali) in November 1999. Its sponsors and bene-
fic i a ries will need to use imagi n ation if the stat i o n
is to surv i ve . As it learned right at the start , w h e n
yo u ’re poor it pays to be bold. ■
