ALL THE KING'S MEN : The ugly career of an incipient American dictator.
THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES : Three soldiers return home from war.
THERE was a time when it
was standard-among the
sharper observers, at least-
to take a dim view of the
social and intellectual contributions
of American films, particularly
with respect to the picture of
American life which they presented
to the world. Fair and responsible
critics, both at home and abroad,
could find little more in Hollywood
movies than glorifications of sex
and gold, of Cinderella and gang-
sters, of romance and opulence, as
though these were solely represen-
tative of the culture and interest
of our land.
And, indeed, the objections of
such critics were not entirely
unjustified, for there was a time
when American movies were dub-
ious mirrors of the American way
of life, as well as unflattering
reflectors of the substantial nature
of mankind. Sensations such as
gangsterism were blatantly over-
emphasized and human behaviour
inconsistent with nature and logic
was displayed. Unfortunately, the
strange impression of America thus
transmitted to the world-and,
for that matter, to many of our
own people with limited horizons
here at home-established a lurid
image of American culture that
was dangerously false. It still
persists in some quarters and
remains to be dispelled.
No one can claim that American
movies are free of all faults today
or that they now constitute ideal
ambassadors of enlightenment and
inspiration to the world. Hollywood
still makes lots of cheap films
which follow the hackneyed for-
mulas. It also grinds out some
costly"epics"which gild human
nature with bright romance. And
it is a singular misfortune of film
commerce that virtually all of
America's films, the cheap ones as
well as the fine ones, are sent all
over the world, which means that
the films of lesser virtues inevitably
predominate in quantity.
And yet a close observation of
American films over the past six
years-that is to say, of our
feature pictures released since
World War II-has conveyed the
gratifying realization that Amer-
ican producers have become more
sharply aware of the responsibility
of the motion picture medium as a
cultural force for social good than
ever before.
Frank Exposures
A HASTY review of the best filmsin this p riod demon trates,
first of all, that a greater im-
pulse towards reality and candour
has pervaded American aims. An
outstanding trend in the post-war
years has been towards dramas
which frankly expose the festering
cankers of intolerance and injustice
in modern society. In a sharp
melodrama entitled Crossfire, the
existence of anti-Semitism in
America was recognized for the
first time, this unpleasant subject
having previously been tabooed,
and this was followed by the film,
Gentlemen's Agreement, which
further disrobed the evil of anti-
Semitic bias.
The peculiar and complicated
presence of anti-Negro prejudice in
this country has also been the
subject of a remarkable series of
post-war films. Beginning with
Home ot the Bravt, a vivid drama
of racial discrimination among
soldiers in the Padfic during the
war, this subjects has been pursued
with a genuine : ervour for the
ideals of democracy is such further
films as Pinky, Losl Boundaries, No
Way Out, and Intnder in the Dust,
he latter a supellative achieve-
ment in cinema ar ; as well.
This regard for social justice and
understanding anong men has
recently been combined effectively
with Hollywood's talent for vivid
war films in a picture called Go
For Broke !-a drama of the
heroic action of an American
regimental combat team made up
of American-born Japanese sold-
iers, termed Nisei in World War
II. And even sone candid ac-
knowledgment of injustice to Ame-
rican Indians that occurred in the
period of westward expansion has
been made in such otherwise
conventional outdcor films as Fort
Apache and BrokEn Arrow, thus
violating the formula for the
standard Western film.
No Punches Pulled
PERHAPS the nost widely im-pressive of Arrerica's post-war
films, both at home and abroad.
has been the diama, The Best
Years of Our Lives. And that is
because this picture not only
understood in universal terms the
emotions of servicemen returning
home after the war, but it fairly
expressed the veteran's yearning
for a fuller democracy and oppor-
tunity for all in thE post-war world.
The American ; cene-in its
light and its dark ; ides-has also
been authentically displayed in
such fine and flavoursome pictures
as Sitting Pretty, Father of the
Bride, Father's Litlle Dividend, The
Jackpot, Miracle en Thirty-fourth
Street, Born YerJ ; erday and All
About Eve, which tre only a few of
the many rich American post-war
comedies ; and i : 1 The Asphalt
Jungle, The Snake Pit, The Quiet
One, Sunset Boulevard, Ace in the
Hole and Treasureof Sierra Madre,
which have been dramas of the
darker side. And a special word
might be mentionej for the picture,
All the King's Ken"because it
pulled no punches. n displaying the
vulnerability of tie mob to the
demagogy of an tspiring dictator
and the viciousness of such a man.
Its story was based upon the career
of the American, fIuey Long.
And, then, of course, there have
been any number of smooth and
light-hearted American films-
such things as T, te Jolson Story
and the comedies cf Danny Kaye-
which have had no particular
social content, save a genial over-
flow of good will It is possible
that such pictures also serve to
create understanding among men.
To be sure, thE American film
industry should : lot be credited
with a paramount aim to make
pictures that will be ambassadors
of culture and e1lightenment in
the world. Its desre is to turn out
pictures that w : ll attract and
absorb an audienc. But in cater-
ing to the public's interests in the
really pertinent dramas of our
times, the American producers may
be said to be C01tributing much
more constructively than ever
before to the good of man.
