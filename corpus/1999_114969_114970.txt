Tr avelling in the eastern Indian stat e
of Bihar is never easy: the trains are
ove r c r owded and the buses are
r a m s h a c k l e . In the south-central plains, 1 0 0
kilometres east and west of Pat n a , the stat e
capital situated on the south bank of the
G a n g e s , bad road conditions make it hard to
m ove around.As well as having to surm o u n t
these obstacles, t r ave l l e rs in this region may
e ven need passes from pri vate part i e s.T h o s e
who issue the passes could be Maoist gr o u p s
but most often they belong to va rious s e n a s—
l a n d l o r d s ’ caste- or class-based pri vat e
a rm i e s.The law enforcement authorities are
v i rtually absent from this regi o n .
The village of Danwar Bihta lies in this
remote area. It is 40 kilometres from the
d i s t rict headquart e rs , A r a , but the terri b l e
road conditions make it almost inaccessible.
The unbridged Sone ri ver which flows near
the village can be crossed by boat but few dare
to make the crossing because of the pri vat e
a rmies which hold sway on both its banks.
The state is very far away in Danwar
B i h t a ; the laws enacted by the legi s l ature are
hardly even heard of and life for the poor is
n a s t y, b rutish and short .D a n war Bihta and

Bihar State
its surrounding area have witnessed many
brutal massacres in the last three decades,
claiming over 1,000 live s , mostly of landless
“ u n t o u c h a b l e s ” or Dalits. The miserable
state of Danwar Bihta reflects the general
lawlessness that pervades Bihar today.
Take Ku s u m l a l , a landless labourer who
barely surv i ved the massacre that the
landlords of Danwar Bihta carried out on
election day in 1989.More than 20 Dalits
were gunned down when they tried to
e xercise their franchise in the parliamentary
e l e c t i o n . Like other Dalits who surv i ve d
the massacre, Kusumlal and his family had
to move away from the village; their lives
were clearly insecure in their traditional
abode.They now live in tiny huts,built on
the roadside near a pri m a ry school in a
village five kilometres from Danwar Bihta.
The cluster of huts, the fact that everyone
belongs to the same caste, the phy s i c a l
distance from the landlords and the
proximity to the school provide a certain
degree of security.
The situation is wo rse for Ku s u m l a l ’s
w i f e , D h a n p at i a , and their eight-ye a r - o l d
d a u g h t e r , P u n a m i a . E ve ry day they have to
t rudge to the Sone ri ve r ,t wo kilometres from
their hut, to fetch water in earthen pots. It is
not that there is any lack of water in the
nearby ponds and we l l s. Ku s u m l a l ’s fa m i l y
and others like them are “ u n t o u c h a b l e s ”a n d
are not allowed by rest of the villagers to take
water from the public pond near their huts.
Armed struggle
Kusumlal and his 11-year-old son Manjhi
cannot find work in the nearby village.T h e
landlords there will not employ them;nor will
people like Kusumlal dare to return to a
group of people who have left the scar of a
bullet injury on his right shoulder.They have
to trudge long distances in search of wo r k ,
sometimes up to ten kilometres each way, t o
e a rn a meagre 30 rupees (70 cents) per day.
E ven this kind of work is only available for
four months a ye a r ,l e aving them in hunger
and misery for the rest of the time.
Ku s u m l a l ’s son goes to the village
p ri m a ry school on the days when he cannot
find wo r k , but this does not necessarily mean
t h at he will actually get any education there.
The school may be shut: the teacher, a

landholder from a neighbouring village, is often
a b se n t , s u p e rvising work on his land rat h e r
than teaching the Dalit children in the pri m a ry
s c h o o l . There is, of cours e , no question of
Ku s u m l a l ’s daughter even going to school and
l e a rning about the gr e at wide world since a
girl child is expected from an early age to bu s y
herself with household work instead.
Kusumlal himself does not know much
about the world beyond his wretched existence.
He never went to school. All his life he has
lived in or near Danwar Bihta.He went to Ara
s e veral times when the case regarding the
D a n war Bihta firing was going on, but his visit
was confined to the court buildings where he
and others like him were summoned to give
evidence.
Kusumlal has not gi ven up hope. He is
aware that he is not alone. Living conditions are
similar for the nearly 1.5 million landless Dalit
l a b o u r e rs in Bihar who are now getting together
here and there to form peasant and labourers’
o r g a n i z ations in a bid to improve their
s i t u at i o n . Unable to overcome the ru t h l e s s
repression by peaceful means, some Dalits
like Kusumlal support militant Naxalite
groups such as the Pe o p l e ’s War Group
(PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre
(MCC) who believe in armed struggle to
end upper-caste domination. Many more
join the Communist Pa rty of India
( M a r x i s t - L e n i n i s t ) , k n own locally as
“ M a a l e y ” , which seeks to combine
p a r l i a m e n t a ry politics with militant peasant
struggles.Together they have formed their
own “armies”to fight for their rights.
Kusumlal doesn’t want money. H e
wants to be treated with dignity. He wants
the landlords to stop sexually exploiting
and raping Dalit wo m e n . He wants the
l a n d l o r d s ’p ri vate army, the Ranbir Sena, t o
halt its massacres. Kusumlal doesn’t know
when these things will happen but he firm l y
believes they will come about one day. n

B ihar is India’s second most populous state  after
Uttar Pra d e s h . Half the size of Germany, it has a
larger population than Germany and A u s t r i a
c o m b i n e d . B i h a r, whose name is derived from the
sanskrit word v i h a r a ( m o n a s t e r y ) , is studded with
Buddhist monuments and historical sites, one of the
most important being Bodh Gaya where Lord Buddha
attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago.
In stark contrast to its glorious past,Bihar today
is in the throes of economic chaos and
unprecedented social tension. It has the dubious
distinction of being one of India’s most crime-ridden
states, with 14 murders a day and one kidnapping
every four hours.As in other Indian states, people in
Bihar are divided on the age-old caste system in
which the Dalits or untouchables are at the bottom
of the ladder. Dalits constitute around 15 per cent of
the state’s population but they hold less than two per
cent of the cultivated land. The social tensions are
largely due to agrarian inequality, and often result in
clashes between landed gentry and landless Dalit
labourers. Active Dalit resistance in Bihar started in
the 1960s, when landless labourers aligned
themselves with Maoist Naxalite groups. Th e
landlords and other upper-caste people formed their
own private armies to assert their supremacy.
Wo m e n , children and old people are often the
victims of these caste-based massacres. The state
a d m i n i s t ra t i o n , irrespective of which party is in
power, is powerless to control these clashes which
have been going on for the last three decades.
Bihar is India’s most backward state, with the
lowest literacy rate and per capita income. On the
other hand,it is the richest state in terms of mineral
r e s o u r c e s, accounting for 40 per cent of India’s total
production.Rabri Devi is the present chief minister,
heading a centrist Rashtriya Janata Dal (National
People’s Party) government. n
