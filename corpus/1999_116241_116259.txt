Publisher Eric Eldred belongs to a
breed of diehards who see the World
Wide Web as a way to fulfill ideals rat h e r
than make money. “ Ve ry much like
UN E S C O, we feel a responsibility to our
public—all human beings on the eart h — t o
preserve our culture of books and art and
make it available to as many as we can,” h e
s ay s. “ We are now blessed with a gr e at deal
of free computer power and we would like
to turn this to good use.”
Since 1995, E l d r e d , the A m e ri c a n
founder of Eldritch Press, has published
on the Web gr e at classics of literature whose
copyright has expired and which have the-
refore fallen into the public domain. H e
wants to build up a virtual library for uni-
versity literature students and high-school
pupils like his triplet daughters.
From Victor Hugo
to the Kama Sutra
Eldred is not the only person fighting to
make culture more accessible and wides-
pread in cy b e rspace than in the “ r e a l ” wo r l d .
In the industrialized countries,such as the
United Stat e s , plenty of moves are afoot
to freshen up the tired old image of the
public library. In recent years, millions of
pages of the works of the greatest writers,
h i s t o ri a n s , poets and philosophers have
been scanned1 onto the Internet or, in some
cases, simply re-typed and put online.
So fa r , such digitalized mat e rial consists
mainly of Anglo-Saxon classics or products
of  We s t e rn culture translated into English.
For example, you can download from the
Web into your computer the writings of
A ri s t o t l e , Oscar W i l d e ,To l s t oy,Victor Hugo,
and a handful of A r a b , Pe rsian and Chinese
a u t h o rs , plus the Kama Sutra. You don’t
need to go hunting for a book that you can,
in this way,k e e p, p rint out, a n n o t ate and use
as you wish or forward to your friends.
These freely-available virtual libraries
h ave been set up by determined indivi-
d u a l s , N G O s , u n i ve rs i t i e s , g ove rn m e n t s
and intern ational organizat i o n s.The Guten-
berg Project and The Oxford Text Archive
(OTA) are the pioneers (see page 45). On
a bigger scale, n ational libraries have begun
the monumental task of digitalizing all the
hundreds of thousands of documents and
pictures they possess.
The first to take the plunge are the
French National Library (BNF) and the
U.S. Library of Congress, says Sonia Zill-
hardt of the BNF. “ O t h e rs have begun wo r-
king on the project in the past three years
but some are still at an experimental stage.
Most don’t have enough money to do it.”
Scanning a page costs between one and
four dollars , so millions are needed to pro-
cess whole collections. But the hardest part
is overcoming the conservatism of some
cultural officials who have to be dragged into
cyberspace.
“ E ve ry country should provide easy
access to documents in the public domain,”
s ays Zillhardt. “The policies of different
states must converge in the new environ-
ment of the world inform ation society.”
This is the aim of the Bibliotheca Univer-
salis (BU) project which was launched in
1995 by the G7 group of the world’s seven
richest countri e s , joined last year by Russia,
and now links 13 countries in all. “They



Untold riches await anyone who can tap into the public libraries now available
on the Internet. But stiffening copyright law could rein in the tre n d

h ave to work out between them who is digi-
talizing what , as well as establish shared
communication norms,” says Zillhardt.
But there’s many a slip twixt cup and lip.
Each national programme goes at its ow n
s p e e d ,with its own pri o rities (such as U. S .h i s-
t o ry in Washington or mat e rial about the
gr e at Po rtuguese explorers in Lisbon) and its
own technical norm s. On top of that ,c u rr e n t
computer programmes do not allow people
to switch from a document in Japanese or
Arabic to one in the Latin alphabet.
By the end of the ye a r ,e ve ryone invo l ve d
in the BU project should have pledged to
put together an initial shared collection of
works on the theme of exchanges between
different peoples. But how many years will
it be before Japanese researchers can make
a request in their own language and come
up with documents from all the associated
libraries? And how much longer than that
will it be before a student in Burkina Faso
can make use of such a tool?
At first sight,virtual libraries seem like
a godsend for people in poor countri e s ,
giving them access to the wo r l d ’s collec-
tive memory, which is concentrated in the
rich countries.They just need a computer,
an Internet connection and some money.
“Web access is still very much a dream in
many developing countries and the cost of
i n t e rn ational phone connections there is
p r o h i b i t i ve ,” s ays Philippe Quéau, UN E S C O’s
director of inform ation and computing.
“Fetching material off the Web takes time
and is expensive — s e veral dollars an hour in
Africa,for example.”
Does this mean online culture is beyo n d
the reach of poor countries? No, but they
h ave to develop two kinds of serv i c e s. F i rs t ,
the local creation of “ m i rr o r ”s i t e s2 of online
l i b r a ri e s , which are accessible for the cost of
a local phone call.And then encouraging the
distribution of works in the form of CD-
R o m s , which cost less than a dollar to copy.
UNESCO has launched a collection called
Publica and will soon put out a CD-Rom of
the great Arabic classics. But it is having a
hard job bri n ging out a similar one on
French-language literature.
“ For two ye a rs I’ve been up against the
i n e rtia of French officialdom which doesn’t
want to get into a fight with the publishers ,
e ven though the works I want to put on
CD-Rom have come into the public
d o m a i n ,” s ays Quéau, who deplores the
rampant pri vat i z ation of the public domain
for profit,“either by extending the life of a
c o p y right or by making use of technology.”
Privatization of the public domain
Both these types of privatization are in
the works. Microsoft’s new Windows 2000
p r o gramme will make it easier to read texts
on the screen, a sign that “e-books” could
soon be on sale in the bookstores.We could
download and read hundreds of works on
such small book-sized computers. B u t
would they, as Eldred fears,become “anti-
b o o k s ” which couldn’t be freely exchanged?
To keep its monopoly, the computer
i n d u s t ry would just need to impose a tech-
nical norm to enable e-books to be read.
Works in the public domain would then
h ave to be electronically edited and so
would once more fall under a copyright.
Intellectual property laws are also get-
ting tougher. A European Union directive
in October 1993 extended the copyri g h t
on an author’s works from 50 to 70 years
after his or her deat h . “It seems reasonable
to us to cover two generations of the author’s
d e s c e n d a n t s , as intern ational law stipulat e s
and in view of today’s greater life expec-
tancy,” says Anne Bergman, an adviser to
the Federation of European Publishers.
The trend is the same in the United

S t at e s , where the life of a copyright has
gr own from 28 ye a rs at the beginning of the
c e n t u ry to 75 ye a rs last ye a r. The U. S .
C o n gress extended this by a further 20
ye a rs last October when it passed the Sonny
Bono Copyright Te rm Extension A c t .S o m e
people are even campaigning for unlimited
copyright,or one for eternity minus a day.
The “minus one day ” is to avoid charges of
unconstitutionality, since U.S. federal law
forbids unlimited copyright.
The aim is also to encourage authors’
c r e at i v i t y, not to provide their heirs and
c o p y right holders with an endless source of
i n c o m e , s ays Eldred. He claims the new
law is unconstitutional and filed a suit in
January 1999 to get it struck down.A first
decision will be made in July 1999 and the
m atter should go all the way to the Supreme
Court, says legal expert and Harvard pro-
fessor Lawrence Lessig, who backs Eldred.
Congress has no right,he says,to limit the
public domain as a whole and extend the
monopoly of a few pri vate gr o u p s , l i k e
Disney and the film industry, which lobbied
very hard to get the Bono Law passed.
“In five ye a rs ’t i m e , Mickey Mouse wa s
to enter the public domain and Disney
would have lost the ability to control dupli-
c ation of Mickey Mouse fil m s ,” s ays Les-
s i g . “The same with the film industry.Te d
Tu rner is another big winner. H e ’s just
purchased the Metro Goldwyn Maye r
a r c h i ve , which now has a 20-year additio-
nal life for him.”
“The public domain is the we l l s p ring of
our culture,” says Eldred. “Think of how
much Disney has taken from works that
are no longer under copyri g h t . Think of
how silly it would be if you had to pay 7.5
cents to an author each time your child
sang ‘Happy Birthday’in public!” n
‘In five years’ time, M i c key Mouse was to enter the public
domain and Disney would have lost the ability to contro l
duplication of Mickey Mouse fil m s.The same with the fil m
i n d u s t r y.Ted Turner is another big winner. H e ’s just purc h a s e d
the Metro Goldwyn Mayer arc h i v e, which now has a 20-year
additional life for him.’
