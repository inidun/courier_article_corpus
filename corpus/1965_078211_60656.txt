I HE cleaning woman who opened the doors
of the Annonciade Museum at St. Tropez,
on the French Riviera, on the morning of
Sunday, July 17, 1961, got the shock of her
life. The walls of the ground floor galleries
were completely bare. During the night
thieves had broken in and helped themselves
to 57 paintings well over half the total collec¬
tion. The museum normally had a guard on
duty at night but on this particular occasion
he was absent, visiting a sick relative. Matisse,
Bonnard. Derain, Vlaminck, Marquet, Dufy the
names of just a few of the artists read like
a roll-call of giants in nearly half a century
of French painting, from 1890 to 1935. The
Annonciade Museum, in fact, was considered
to have one of France's finest collections of
modern painting, ranking, according to some
authorities, in fourth place after the two great
museums of modern art in Paris and the Gre¬
noble Museum. This was the fifth art robbery
to take place on the Riviera within a year.
Almost all the works taken in the earlier thefts
were recovered and many of the thieves were
arrested. The Annonciade Museum eventually
recovered all except one of the 57 paintings
(the missing one is shown opposite page, top).
