N December 14, 1962, in the dawn
light of a winter morning, a motor
car escorted by police pulled out
of the Louvre Museum in Paris (photo

of Le Havre: one of the world's most
famous paintings, Leonardo da Vinci's
"Mona Lisa" was off to America. It was
then exhibited for four weeks at the
National Gallery in Washington and for
a further month at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, to hund¬
reds of thousands -of admiring visitors.
In arranging for the "Mona Lisa" to
make this transatlantic voyage, the Lou¬
vre gave a demonstration par excellence
of how to protect a work of art against
every kind of danger. Technicians
planned the operation down to the last
detail. First, X-rays and large scale
photographs were made of the painting.
Then, removed from its frame, it was
placed between blocks of nylon as a
precaution against vibrations and packed
into a case weighing 80 kilogrammes
(187 lbs) specially designed to protect it
against shocks and changes of temper¬
ature (above).
The Louvre had already had occasion
to test the efficiency of similar air-con¬
ditioned containers when it sent paint¬
ings by Rembrandt to an exhibition in
Vienna. Even the possibility of a ship¬
wreck had been considered and to pro¬
vide maximum safety for such a VIP
passenger, the protective case had been
made unsinkablel Six guards kept
constant watch over the "Mona Lisa"
which travelled in a reserved cabin
fitted with a device to keep a 24-hour
check on the temperature.
The "Mona Lisa," now over 450 years | |
old, was brought from Italy to France
by Leonardo in 1516. It was given its
original name, "La Gioconda" because

it is believed to be the portrait of the
wife of an Italian, Francisco del Giocon-
do. Francis I of France bought it from
Leonardo for 4,000 gold florins (a sum
that now corresponds to $600,000), but
its present-day value is inestimable. In
1911 it was stolen from the Louvre and
was not recovered until two years later
in Italy. In 1957 it was struck by a stone
thrown by a vandal who was trying to
mutilate it, but fortunately it suffered only
slight damage. Since then it has been
protected by a sheet of bullet-proof
glass.
In 1962, when the French Government
agreed to loan it to the United States,
the conditions under which it was to be
exhibited were specified in detail. While
on view in Washington and New York
it was under constant surveillance; only
natural lighting was used throughout its
exhibition and the use of flash bulbs by
photographers was forbidden the heat
generated by them might have changed
the temperature of the air-conditioned
hall. As the voyage of the "Mona Lisa",
proves, works of art can now travel
great distances without serious danger
of damage or deterioration, thanks to
modern protective techniques. "Mona
Lisa" returned to the Louvre in perfect
health on March 12, 1963 after being
seen by nearly 1,600,000 people in the
United States.

Gallery, Washington.
Constant watch was kept
on the painting by
means of television cameras
covering the entire hall.
Image picked up by the cameras
was transmitted to a central
observation post.

one of the guards on
duty keeps his eyes fixed
on the masterpiece in
the now empty hall.
At the slightest sign of anything
suspicious he can sound a
general alarm.

the " Mona Lisa ", guarded
by armed sentries.
As a further measure to
facilitate surveillance, only a
limited number of persons
at a time were allowed
into the hall.
