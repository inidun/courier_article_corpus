SPAIN
Curtain up
on Catalonia
by Xavier Fabregas
BECAUSE of its geographical
situation, Catalonia has been
a land of passage for widely
differing peoples. As a result its
culture is an amalgam wrought over
many centuries from the most
diverse ingredients into new and
original forms. This must be kept in
mind in any consideration of the
Catalan theatre and any study of its
present forms.
It is not by chance that the first
man of the theatre in Catalonia
whose name has come down to us is
Emilius Severianus, a second-
century mimographer, or author of
directions for pantomimes, who,
judging by the stone monument
erected in his honour by his fellow
citizens in the Roman theatre at Tar¬
ragona, achieved great popularity.
The name of Emilius Severianus
stands for the predominance of
gestural expression and dramatic ac¬
tion over the written word,
characteristics that have been
preserved in the Catalan theatre of
today. Two of the most represen¬
tative present-day theatrical com¬
panies, Els Joglars and Els- Come-
diants, lay stress on mime, on the
movements of the actor, on the con¬
tinuing validity of inherited forms of
culture in the technified, automated
world of today. This does not mean,
however, that oral communication or
contemporary customs are ignored.
The medieval theatre of Catalonia,
which coincided with the period of
expansion of an independent State,
now constitutes a literary heritage
that can stand comparison with that
of any other European culture of to¬
day. However, some authors of the
Renaissance, Baroque and neo¬
classical periods, whose works are
now being re-published and revived,
followed foreign trends without suc¬
ceeding in giving them a new per-

drama critic, is head of the research department

Theatre", "Tradition, Myths and Beliefs of the
Catalonians", and "The Ritual Source of Daily
Life".

sonal formulation. It is not until the
nineteenth-century Romantic move¬
ment that we come across some
playwrights whose works conquered
a wider public and who still occupy a
place which, in other theatrical
cultures, is reserved to older
classics. Among these. Angel
Guimerà (whose works have been
translated into more than twenty
languages), Frederic Soler, Ignasi
Iglesias, Santiago Rusiñol and
Josep M. de Sagarra are names
which are known today throughout
the Catalan-speaking world (more
than eight million people) and their
plays continue to be acted.
A taste for acting and the theatre
seems to be part of the Catalan way
of life. In every locality, however
small, there ¡s a group with its own
hall which rehearses and produces
plays more or less regularly. Accor¬
ding to a survey conducted some
years ago, there are about 3,000
theatrical groups in Catalonia.
The professional theatre is
developing rapidly in Barcelona and
Valencia, the two most important
cities where Catalan is spoken. The
Theatre Institute is located in
Barcelona and provides courses in
acting, production and scenography
for more than 1,500 students.
Catalan writers for the theatre
represent a wide range of trends.
From 1 939 to 1 945, because of the
cultural repression conducted
against the Catalan people by the
dictatorship, plays in Catalan were
completely prohibited, and from
1 946 to 1 975, owing to the censor¬
ship, plays had to be staged either in
elliptical form or underground. This
favoured a theatre of more or less
veiled political satire, which led to
some brilliant successes such as El
retaule del flautista by Jordi Teixidor.
The most representative figure of
that period is the poet Salvador
Espriu, who wrote for the theatre an
Antigone which is a symbolical
reconstruction of the Civil War, and
The First Story of Esther in which he
superimposes two worlds, that of
the Old Testament and that of his
Catalonia, with an au¬
tonomous nationality and
its own distinctive lan¬
guage and culture within
the Spanish context, of¬
fers a remarkable exam¬
ple of theatre in a national
minority language. Right,

own Myth of Sinera, which are a
transcription of contemporary Cata¬
lan society compared to the Jewish
people and in danger of extinction. In
The First Story of Esther, Salvador
Espriu sought to write the elegy of
his people in an apocalyptic moment
of enforced silence.
The theatrical work of another
Catalan poet, Joan Brossa, although
also politically committed, follows
very different lines. An heir of Sur¬
realism and friend of Joan Miró, with
whom he collaborated on several oc¬
casions, Brossa has written over four
hundred "theatrical proposals"
which can be classifed in several
groups: works in which he tries out
new forms modelled on established
theatrical forms, such as the saínete
(sketch) or naturalistic drama;
theatrical "happenings" which
either avoid the Italian style of décor
or use it as a sort of Pandora's Box;
a long series of stripteases with
dramatic content; works involving
impersonation or conjuring; ballets
and musicals, some of which have
been produced with music by Josep

M. Mestres Quadreny and décor by
Antoni Tapies.
Salvador Espriu and Joan Brossa
belong to a generation which,
although very young, took part in the
Civil War of 1 936-1 939 and suffered
the consequences of the defeat and
repression which followed it. They
were followed by a large number of
younger writers born after 1939, of
whom I shall mention only two, who
are now in full maturity Josep
M. Benety Jornet, and Rodolf Sirera.
The works of Benêt y Jornet offer
an account and an assessment of
childhood based on the author's
youthful surroundings and personal
experiences; he very quickly moved
away from the initial strict realism of
Una vella coneguda olor (An Old
Familiar Smell) to create a dream
world which reflects the rebellion
provoked by the adult world (The
Disappearance of Wendy). Benêt y
Jornet has also achieved renown as
the author of imaginative texts for
children. His works have been
translated into Spanish, Portuguese
(in Brazil), English (in the USA), etc.
Rodolf Sirera learned his craft in
the fringe theatre of the Valencia
region. Since 1970, he has been
director and promoter of the El Rogle
theatre group. He began by writing
plays for this group such as La pau
retorna a Atenas (Peace returns to
Athens), a very free adaptation of
Aristophanes. His works, some of
which were written in collaboration
with his brother Josep Lluis, soon
became investigations of contem¬
porary Valencia society. The search
for new theatrical forms represents a
very important aspect of the theatre
of Rodolf Sirera. For instance, The
Murder ofDoctor Moraleda was writ¬
ten as a puzzle which the spectator is
called upon to piece together to
reconstruct the story.
Although Catalan is a Romance
language, closely related to its neigh¬
bours, and occupies a geographical
area which can be regarded as
privileged from the point of view of
the cultural history of the West, its
literature encounters many dif¬
ficulties when it comes to its
dissemination beyond its own
linguistic area. This is not due to a
weak demographic base. Statistical¬
ly speaking, Catalan is well placed
amongst the spoken and written
languages of Europe. The causes
must be sought in the absence of in¬
stitutions with responsibility for the
diffusion of literary works abroad.
Only this can explain why Catalan
painters like Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí
and Antonio Tapies are very well
known everywhere while, on the
contrary, poets, novelists and
playwrights of similar importance are
not.
At all events, the most important
theatrical companies are determined
to break into the international circuit
and have succeeded in doing so on
many occasions with works whose
contents could be understood
despite language barriers. Els Joglars
and Els Comediants are two such
companies whose activities are not
limited by frontiers.
The history of Els Joglars is closely
linked to that of its director, Albert
Boadella. Boadella and Els Joglars
initially presented themselves to the y
33

public as a traditional mime group
with whitened faces and black body-
stockings. However, they began
gradually to use speech, abandoned
the brief sketch in favour of the
single-theme production and
adopted masks, make-up and varied
costumes. According to Boadella,
the theatre should play a provocative
role, reconstructing topical issues in
aesthetic terms. For instance, in M-7
Catalonya he has posed the dilemma
of national cultures at a time when
the world is moving towards unifor¬
mity and mechanization; in Laertius,
the features of a post-nuclear biology
which is gradually developing to
move again towards self-destruction;
in Olympic Man Movement, the
deceitful illusions of Neo-Nazism.
Boadella writes and directs his
own plays, some of which, like La
Torna, in which he presents the case
of an ordinary prisoner who is con¬
demned to death by the military
authorities so that they can justify
the shooting of a political prisoner,
have caused him real problems.
Following the staging of La Torna,
Boadella was imprisoned. Having
feigned illness and been transferred
to hospital, he escaped by walking
along the ledge outside the fifth
floor, in the centre of Barcelona,
while jeering at the police. It was a
fantastic feat, worthy of one of his
own plays.
Els Comediants have sought their
inspiration in popular festivities, and
their plays are sometimes acted on
the streets with giants and large-
headed dwarfs, like the fight of Saint
George and the Dragon, sometimes
in traditional theatres in the form of
dances or verbenas, but the produc¬
tions are always very carefully plann¬
ed. The amount of improvisation
which may be included in each pro¬
duction of Els Comediants is strictly
calculated according to the overall
rhythm of the piece.
Some actors have followed a path
of their own. One of them is the
mime Albert Vidal, who has succeed¬
ed in achieving a synthesis of Euro¬
pean gestural forms with those of
the Far East, especially Japan, and
has created works like El bufó (The
Buffoon) in which the search for new
forms does not exclude contact with
a popular public.

Els Joglars (The Jugglers) in
a scene from M. 7 Catalonya.
Originally a mime group. Els
Joglars are directed by their
founder Albert Boadella.
The title of the play, which is
a reflection on Catalonia and
its culture, is derived from
Catalonia's listing (No. 7) in
Wallace Muller's inventory
of twenty-three Mediterra¬
nean cultures.

of Esther, by the great
Catalan poet Salvador
Espriu, performed by the

Dramatic Art, Barcelona.
When he wrote Esther, near¬
ly forty years ago, Espriu
was writing, in symbolic
language, an elegy for the
Catalan people reduced to
enforced silence.
