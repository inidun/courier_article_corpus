RADIOS
ON THE RIVER THAMES
A great step forward in the
movement that is going on all
over the world to speed up the
turn-round of shipping in the ports
has been, taken with the opening in
recent weeks of a new radio infor¬
mation service at Gravesend, on the
River Thames, the gateway to the
Port of London. This service which
has been designed to give shipmasters
and pilots every piece of information
that they may, need about the state
of the river at any hour of the day
or night, and particularly in fog, has
been made possible by the conclusion
at the Hague in 1957 of the Inter-X
national Maritime Agreement on
the allocation of V.H.F. frequency
modulated wavebands.
Gateway to the
port of London
The Thames, with one of the
longest systems of docks and
wharves in the world, traces a
winding course of fifty miles from its
seaward end to London Bridge which
is the upper limit of navigation for
22
practically all seagoing vessels. Gra¬
vesend, twenty-four miles- up-river
from the sea is a focal; point for all
shipping bound to or from the docks
because it is here that vessels have to
pass the customs and the port health
authorities and it is here, too, that
they pick up or put ashore their sea
or river pilots. The channel at Grave¬
send is under half-a-mile Wide and it
has to carry a tremendous volume
of shipping. As many as eighty ves¬
sels or more may pass through on a
single tide.
For just over ten years the Port of
London Authority, which controls the
tidal sections of the river, had been
using amplitude modulated radio
equipment to give information to
ships but, With the conclusion of the
Hague agreement on V.H.F. fre¬
quencies a very much more efficient
service giving better quality of speech
together with freedom from noise and
interference became possible and as
a result the new Thames Navigation
Service, which may well become a
prototype for port radio services all
over the world, was brought into
being. Its facilities are available
free to any ship equipped with even
very simple V.H.F. radio equipment.

This ' equipment is not limited . in its
uses to the Thames service; it can
equally well be used with radio services
already established or planned for
ports in other countries, and, of
course, it can be used, too, for direct
speech between ship and ship at sea,
and for public telephone corres¬
pondence ashore.
Panoramic view of
all river traffic
The great advance that has been
made in planning and equip¬
ping the Gravesend station is
that facilities for the reception of in¬
formation, for broadcasting it to
ships and for a radar scan of some
of the busiest and most important
sectors of the river, are all housed in
one very carefully designed operation
room. Because the 'Trinity House
pilots who take ships up the river to
the docks or down it to the sea are
as much concerned as the ships' cap¬
tains themselves with the state of the
channel and the traffic on it, the
Navigation Service building has been

erected close alongside the pilot pier
and there is direct access for pilots
from their own rooms on the pier to
a gallery in the operation room
where they can study a panoramic
plan of the whole river from London
to the sea.
This panoramic plan occupies the
whole of one wall of the operation
room and below it is the radar scan
which keeps watch over Gravesend
reach at night and in fog. Eventually
further radar scans will be installed
so that thirty-one miles of the river
can be kept constantly under watch.
The operation room is linked by
telephone to the various docks from
which programmes of the docking
and undocking of ships are received.
These programmes are noted along¬
side the river plan. Constant radio
touch is kept, too, with the Port of
London Authority's launches which
report movements, of shipping in¬
wards and outwards and other
essential information such as where
vessels are anchored in the river,
where dredgers are working, the
position of wrecks, or where pile-
driving operations are being carried
out.
Robot 'watchdogs' of
tide and visibility
All this information is noted on
the illuminated river plan. The
state of the tide is noted, too, as
well as the degree of visibility at
various points. Eventually data about
tide and visibility which are at pre¬
sent received by telephone, will be
automatically relayed by radio link
from distant recording instruments
which will keep it up to date from
moment to moment.
Once in every half-hour, day and
night, the duty officer working
from the information on the plan
prepares and broadcasts a short
bulletin on the state of the river. For
the remainder of the time the service
is available at any minute to answer
queries from any ship that calls it up.
The caller makes contact on the
international "calling and safety"
channel and he is then directed to
switch over to one of the four radio
channels at present in use, two for
the western and two for the eastern
section of the river. Eventually the
number of channels will be extended
to three for each section.
A tanker, for instance, which is
deeply laden, may want information
that is accurate to within inches of
the depth of- water at one of the oil
jetties lower down the river. The
Gravesend radio service can give it
within a few moments. Or, again, a
steamer moving in poor visibility or
at night, may pick up on its radar
The port of London can boast a unique radio
Information service for shipping which may
well become a prototype for port radio ser¬
vices all over the world. A special operations
room has been built where movements of all
traffic are plotted by radar (above) on a huge
panoramic wall plan (left) of the whole river
from London to the sea. Using VHF radio
equipment, officers (below) flash vital infor¬
mation to all vessels on the Thames (opposite).

RADIO'S MAGIC EYE

another vessel lying on its course
ahead. Naturally the captain is
anxious to know whether the vessel
seen on his radar is moving or not,
and he is anxious to know it quickly.
He can call the Information Service
and at once- the radar scan at
Gravesend picks up the two vessels
and makes a check. Within a very
short time the duty officer is able to
tell the enquirer whether the ship he
has spotted is moving or at anchor.
The radar scan can also show the
line along which a particular vessel
is moving and give an indication
whether it is heading clear of any
obstacle.
The Information Service is linked
direct by teleprinter with the Port of
London's head office and movements
of shipping are relayed immediately
they occur. This is likely to result
in making the publication of ship
movements both simpler and quicker.
Another function of the Service is to
pass information at once to customs
and port health authorities as well
as to the pilots waiting to take vessels
in and out.
Pioneering for better
port radio services
It is perhaps here as much as in
the giving of information to the
ships themselves that the Ser¬
vice will help to speed up movement.
On a busy tide there may be several
ships awaiting clearance at the same
time, with more following up astern
of them. Anything that enables
customs officers and port doctors, as
well as the waiting tugmasters, to
get on with their work smoothly and
quickly is bound to assist in keeping
all traffic on the move.
As yet the Thames Navigation
Service is only at its beginnings. It
has been planned for flexible develop¬
ment and very full statistics are
being collected of the ways in which
it is used. These will give a
pointer to future modifications and
extensions. In setting up this service
the Port of London Authority is
pioneering new ground and looking to
the future. At the present time
comparatively few ships out of the
whole of the world's tonnage that
uses the Thames are equipped with
the necessary V.H.F. radio sets, but
the expectation and the belief is that
once the facilities that are available
become more widely known installa¬
tions will be made on a rapidly
growing number of vessels belonging
to many nations of the world.
