Who owns Antarctica?
The Antarctic is unique in that it is
owned by no one country and has been
governed for almost 40 years by an inter-
national treaty (see box).Because of this it
cannot be controlled or policed as areas of
n ational sovereignty can.To make changes
in the rules, the 27 Antarctic Treaty (AT)
countries all have to agree.
Do people need to get a visa to go there?
If you are a citizen of an AT country, t h e n
these days you have to get a permit to meet the
requirements of the environmental protocol.
Since these countries represent 70 per cent of
the wo r l d ’s populat i o n , there is a strong pre-
sumption that most people who will be going
to the Antarctic will be getting perm i t s. I f
they are touri s t s ,t r avel agents will get a perm i t
for them.C o u n t ries which are not party to the
t r e aty do not have to provide perm i t s.



A n t a r c t i c a ’s t a i n t e d
horizons 
The A n t a rctic was designated ‘a continent for peace and
science’ in an international treaty signed 38 years ago. In the
last decade a wide-ranging Protocol has been added to this to
p rovide the continent with better environmental pro t e c t i o n .
But today dark shadows of pollution are looming over this
remote continent with a unique international status. On the
eve of a meeting of A n t a rctic Treaty nations to be held in May
1999 in Lima, Pe r u , D r. David Walton of the British A n t a rc t i c
Survey explains why conservation of what is still ‘the world’s
cleanest place’ is important for all of us.

Is there much tourism?To u rists attracted by the continent’s
remoteness, wildlife and stunning scenery
first came by ship in the 1960s,and in the
past two decades their numbers have
climbed steadily.Air tourism has also deve-
loped over the past decade. Last year there
were over 10,000 tourists in Antarctica—
more people than were concerned with all
the scientific stations and their logistic sup-
p o rt . Some 60 or so sites are regularly used
for tourist visits.
Do tourists bring pollution?
M a ny tourists are already well inform e d
about environmental issues and know that
uncontrolled tourism can damage the fea-
tures that make the area special. As ye t
there is no unequivocal scientific evidence
of damage but there must be a limit to the
number of visitors that sites can sustain
before the vegetation or wildlife are tram-
pled out of existence.
How can numbers be controlled?
There appears to be no legal way at
present to do this for visitors to an inter-
n ational area. G ove rnments can help
manage tourism by limiting permits to com-
panies with good environmental records,bu t
my view is that the tour companies them-
s e l ves must accept the responsibility to limit
impacts by policing their customers.
Worryingly, the passenger capacity of
c ruise ships is ri s i n g, with ships carrying up
to 1,700 passengers proposing to transit
the Antarctic whilst others intend to land up
to 800 passengers at individual sites. My
p e rsonal experience of tour ships has so
far been good, with guides working hard to
inform passengers as well as keep them to
a strict environmental code whilst on shore.
They do not leave litter, the ships do not
deposit waste overboard in Antarctic wat e rs
and for the most part visitors do not appear
to seriously disturb wildlife.
Why is it so important to preserve the
Antarctic environment?
The Antarctic is special because it has
less pollution than anywhere else in the
world—it doesn’t have any smokestack
industry, agricultural activity or perma-
nent human population. We can use it as
the baseline against which pollution levels
in other parts of the world can be measu-
red, to tell us whether or not the situation
is getting worse. From this point of view,
the Antarctic will only remain scientifical-
ly valuable if it is properly managed today.
Sampling snow cores in Antarctica has
gi ven us a range of pollution ya r d s t i c k s.We
can see in the snow the increasing levels of
lead we have been putting into the atmos-
phere since the Industrial Revo l u t i o n ,w i t h
the most rapid increase when lead wa s
added to fuel for cars. The snow also
contains a signature of the worldwide pol-
lution caused by the atomic bomb tests of
the 1950s and 1960s. Most recently we
h ave been able to detect carbon part i c l e s
in the air produced by forest fires in the tro-
pics.
What can be done to combat these
environmental threats?
You have to distinguish between glo-
bal and local threats. Let’s look at the
local problems first. Until the mid-1950s
there was very little scientific activity in
the Antarctic and the only industry in the
area was whaling. At that time the oceans
were seen as suitable repositories for
waste, and dumping waste in uninhabited
areas was acceptable. When I first began
work in the Antarctic in 1967, recycling
was not even considered in many research
stations and dumping waste in remote
areas of the Antarctic was a common
practice.Unfortunately, in the low tempe-
r atures characteristic of the A n t a r c t i c,
there is virtually no bacterial decay, so the
wastes associated with scientific stations
and with this laissez-faire attitude of ear-
lier days are still with us. In fact it was this
problem of waste disposal that raised the
alarm among AT countries and led to the
signature in 1991 of the Protocol for the
Protection of the Antarctic Environment.
This protocol,which came into legal force
in January 1998 but had been followed by
most countries since 1991, introduced
rigorous environmental regulations and
forced countries to clean up the mess they
had created.
Is the protocol working?
The rules comprise the most stri n g e n t
c o n s e rvation and management rules so fa r
agreed upon anywhere in the world.They
c over all human activities in A n t a r c t i c a ,
and include stipulations for rigorous control
of waste disposal and contingency plans to
combat marine pollution and protect flora
and fauna. No mining or exploration for
minerals or hydrocarbons will be allowed in
the Antarctic for the next 50 ye a rs.The AT
nations have taken their role as managers
ve ry seriously and made enormous amounts
of investment in changes of practice. I t
costs a lot of money to be environmentally
c l e a n . When the U. S . a greed to the pro-
tocol they immediately produced $30 mil-
lion for clean-up operations around the
American scientific stations.
In other words, the Antarctic Treaty and the
Protocol to prevent pollution are
functioning well within the Antarctic itself
but pollution is coming in from outside.

from a fishing hook at sea.

T h at ’s ri g h t . Most of the Antarctic pol-
lutants come from industrial and agri c u l-
tural activity in the nort h e rn hemisphere.
We can measure them in the air, the snow
and in the plants and animals. Fo r
e x a m p l e , there is one especially unpleasant
group of chemicals called persistent orga-
nic pollutants (POPs) which compri s e s
i n s e c t i c i d e s , herbicides and other env i r o n-
mentally damaging substances. T h e s e
compounds do not exist nat u r a l l y, b r e a k
d own only ve ry slowly in marine and ter-
r e s t rial ecosystems and accumulate with
t oxic effects. None of them are made or
used in the Antarctic and they are now
banned from use both there and in many
other parts of the wo r l d .They mainly ori-
gi n ate from the nort h e rn hemisphere, p r o-
duced by agri c u l t u r e , i n d u s t rial processes
and from waste breakdow n . M e a s u ri n g
their presence in Antarctic penguins and
seals indicates the baseline pollution leve l
for these compounds throughout the
wo r l d . The increasing range and concen-
t r ation of many POPs in Antarctica is a
s o b e ring reminder of how far these dama-
ging compounds can spread outside our
control and how little we can do about it.
Industrial countries of the North contribute
up to 80 per cent of the greenhouse gas
emissions that cause global warming and
endanger fragile areas like the A n t a rc t i c. Ye t
these countries are also parties to the
e n v i ronmental protocol to preserve the
A n t a rctic enviro n m e n t . Isn’t there a
c o n t radiction here ?
T h at is quite corr e c t . It is surp ri s i n g, t o
say the least, that states which have shown
e x t r a o r d i n a ry co-operation in preserv i n g
the Antarctic environment are not doing
enough to control the pollution in their
own parts of the world.
The Antarctic Tr e aty is a bit like the Inter-
n ational Law of the Sea, where eve ry b o d y
a grees on what should happen on the high
seas and then does something different in
their own wat e rs.There seems to be a contrast
b e t ween what countries can do co-operat i ve l y
in an area that is not owned by them and is
not being industrially developed by them
and has no indigenous populat i o n ,and what
they do in their own terri t o ry where there is
a populat i o n ,i n d u s t ry and expectations for a
different way of life.
What can be done?
Nothing can be done to prevent this
long-range pollution in the Antarctic which
is due to industrial activities in other parts
of the wo r l d . Antarctic pollution will
continue as long as pollution continues
elsewhere in the world.What we can do is
to attempt to keep our own Antarctic house
in order by ensuring that the activities that
take place down there are first of all subject
to environmental impact assessment and
then that we use technologies and metho-
d o l o gies that minimize damage or pollution.
Would you say that environmental
protection is easier in the Antarctic than in
the Arctic?
One major reason why the AT nat i o n s
h ave been able to introduce such stri n g e n t
e nvironmental regulations is that there is no
indigenous population seeking to fulfil its
a s p i r ations at the cost of the env i r o n m e n t .I n
the Arctic region on the other hand, w h e r e
there is a sizeable population and countri e s
h ave sovereign terri t o ry, there are ve ry consi-
derable areas of mineral development and
hydrocarbon and gas extraction. In Siberi a ,
for example, there are enormous oil spills
from fractured pipelines and heavy metal
pollution problems from smelters that simply
do not occur in the A n t a r c t i c.
Who is liable for environmental damage in
the Antarctic? Environmentalists say the
Treaty is not clear about this.
T h at is tru e . No agreement has been rea-
ched as ye t .This question is on the agenda for
the treaty meeting in Lima in May.
Why do countries not agree about this?
There are a number of difficult pro-
blems. First of all you have to get 27 coun-
t ries with 27 different legal systems and 27
different cultural expectations to agree on
what liability means.
Ta k e , for example, the idea of a protected
area in a national park. In the U. S . , a nat i o n a l
park is a protected area owned by the Fe d e r a l
g ove rnment and is run as a park for conser-
vation purp o s e s.A national park in the UK is
not owned by the gove rnment but by lots of
s e p a r ate land-ow n e rs. It isn’t run mainly for
c o n s e rvation purp o s e s. It contains industry,
housing and all sorts of other activities. I t
d o e s n ’t bear any resemblance what s o e ver to
the A m e ri c a n ,G e rman and French ve rs i o n s.

A continent for p e a c e and s c i e n c e
Internationally co-ordinated work in the A n t a r c t i c
began with the scientific initiative called the
International Geophysical Year in 1957.The results
were so impressive,both scientifically and politically,
that in 1959 the participating countries signed the
Antarctic Treaty (AT ) , which came into force in
1 9 6 1 . The Tr e a t y, which runs indefinitely, d e s i-
gnates the continent as an area for peace and
s c i e n c e, freezes all territorial claims, forbids military
activity and nuclear waste disposal,and encourages
international collaboration in science and logistics.
The Treaty was initially signed by A r g e n t i n a ,A u s-
t r a l i a , C h i l e, Fr a n c e, New Zealand, N o r wa y, t h e
United Kingdom, B e l g i u m , Ja p a n , South A f r i c a ,t h e
former Soviet Union and the United States. S i n c e
1961 a wide variety of extra legislation has been
agreed at the regular meetings of the AT nations,
who now comprise 27 countries with active scien-
t i fic programmes covering areas of science ranging
from the outer atmosphere to the rocks beneath the
ice sheet, from the bacteria in ice cores to the
origin of the Southern Hemisphere continents.
Many of the projects are now so large (e. g . ,e s t i-
mating whether the whole ice sheet is growing or
melting) that they can only be accomplished by big
international teams working over several years.A
further 16 countries have acceded to the Treaty but
do not undertake research.AT countries represent
around 70 per cent of the world’s population.
In 1991,the AT nations signed the Environ-
mental Protocol to the Antarctic Tr e a t y, w h i c h
bans mining for 50 years and provides for a fully
comprehensive regime of environmental protec-
tion. n

things in different countri e s.T h at is one of the
major problems we face in the case of liability.
Do any states parties to the Antarctic Treaty
still have territorial claims over the
Antarctic?
The Antarctic treaty freezes all territo-
rial claims that were there in 1961 and
these cannot be improved on or added to in
any way.Taking away this major source of
i n t e rn ational disagreement has allowed the
parties to continually adjust the treaty to
meet changing public and political needs
over the past 38 ye a rs. Of particular impor-
tance throughout that period has been the
scientific advice on the best methods for
management that has been supplied by the
i n t e rn ational science community. T h at
makes the AT a slightly unusual treaty. By
including scientists right from the start it has
been able to tap into the scientific com-
munity and get sound scientific advice.
What kind of scientific research is being
done in the Antarctic?
The special environmental characteri s t i c s
of the continent make it possible to carry out
scientific inve s t i g ations and experi m e n t s
which are not possible anywhere else in the
wo r l d .We are looking at animals and plants
t h at can surv i ve in the ve ry low tempera-
tures and ve ry dry atmosphere which are
c h a r a c t e ristic of the A n t a r c t i c.We are using
the Antarctic as an experimental area to test
out theories about whether life can surv i ve on
M a rs. And we are managing one of the lar-
gest fis h e ries in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the characteristics of the ear-
t h ’s magnetic fie l d , the Antarctic has some
unique features enabling us to inve s t i g at e
the causes of solar storm s.These occur when
a solar flare on the sun produces a storm of
charged particles which hurtle towards the
e a rth and affect its upper at m o s p h e r e ,w h e r e
hundreds of communicat i o n s ,n av i g at i o n a l
and television satellites have been positioned.
In the Antarctic we are working on measuri n g
solar storms and developing a model which
will wa rn us about their likely effects so that
we can protect satellites by moving them to
a safer orbit or by switching them off.
Damage can affect a lot of people.
For instance, a solar storm produced a
tremendous amount of induced current in a
p ower system in North A m e rica a few ye a rs
ago causing the whole of Quebec’s electri c a l
system to collapse. If we can develop a model
which tells us what the strength of the storm
will be and when it will strike and so on we
can take precautions to stop that sort of
thing happening. In addition to measuri n g
pollution leve l s , research is also being carri e d
out into many aspects of global wa rm i n g,
melting ice sheets and rising sea leve l s.
There have been reports that ice shelves
in the Antarctic are disintegrating and
drifting away. Is this so?
We know that some of the smaller flo at i n g
ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula have
d i s i n t e gr ated over the last 40 ye a rs. T h e y
d o n ’t make any difference to the sea leve l
because they were already flo ating but they
do show that significant regional wa rming is
o c c u rring in this area. W h at we still don’t
k n ow yet is whether the total ice sheet is in
b a l a n c e .We are developing a model but it will
take many more ye a rs yet before we can be
c e rtain if and when the ice sheets could melt.
What is the present situation of ozone
depletion above the Antarctic?
It was the discove ry of the hole in the
ozone layer over the Antarctic in 1985 by the
B ritish Antarctic Survey that drew at t e n t i o n
to the depletion by industrial processes,
notably chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases,
of the ozone layer that stops harmful solar
r a d i ation from penetrating through to the ear-
t h ’s surfa c e .Last spring saw the lowest ozone
l e vel in the Antarctic ever recorded.
We will not see the ozone level climb
back up to normal protective levels until we
h ave got rid of all the chemicals which are
causing ozone destruction in the upper
at m o s p h e r e . Since CFCs are still around it
is unlikely that there is going to be a sudden
r e c ove ry of the ozone layer in the next few
d e c a d e s.As of now there is a black market in
CFCs to get round the restrictions on trading
and manufa c t u r e .
There are so many CFCs around—in
deep freeze and air conditioning plants—
t h at it is not going to be possible to get rid of
them quickly.We are going to be faced with
ozone depletion for a considerable time.
Depletion is already happening in the A r c t i c,
and ozone levels above Europe have declined
in the past few ye a rs. It is happening all ove r
the wo r l d .The most frightening thing is just
h ow difficult it is to gain any real control
over such serious global damage to conserve
the world for future generat i o n s. n

The world’s c o l d e s t,

place 
Antarctica and its ice shelves cover about 14
million square kilometres, 10 per cent of the
e a r t h ’s land area. Less than 1% is free of per-
manent ice and snow.The highest continent (esti-
mated average altitude 2,300 m), it is perpe-
tually hidden beneath the planet’s largest ice
c a p, built up over 400,000 years of compacted
snow fall and now almost 5 km deep in places.
The ice cap contains over 32 million km3 of ice
(about 90% of the world’s ice and almost 70% of
its fresh wa t e r ) , but with an average precipitation
of only 5 cm per year, Antarctica is the driest
place on earth.
Antarctica is also the world’s coldest place
(annual mean temperature -160C ) . The coldest
temperature ever recorded on earth was -89.60C
at Russia’s Vostok research station in July 1983.
Strong winds, sometimes up to 320 km per hour,
blow throughout the year.Recorded annual mean
wind speed average is about 67 km per hour,
making it the planet’s windiest place. n
