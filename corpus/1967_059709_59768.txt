of emotion, and to give them emphasis 
and exaltation. He also wanted to 
accentuate the rhythm of other activi- 
ties, such as the march and the dance, 
with sounds produced by clapping the 
hands or by playing instruments of a 
fairly rudimentary nature. 
These instruments were probably 
“invented” independently by various 
     
    
by Luigi Pareti 
peoples. Men were led to create them 
empirically by the noises they obtain- 
ed, sometimes quite casually, through 
percussion, or shaking, or quick rotary 
movement, or rubbing, or plucking at 
resonant and vibrant objects, or blow- 
ing at reeds and similar hollow tubes.

THE TREMBLING LYRE (Continued) 
Tree bark musicians of yore 
Vibration caused by pressure gave 
rise to hurdy-gurdies, cymbals, casta- 
nets, and the like; percussion on reso- 
nant sticks or hollow tree-trunks or 
tablets or taut membranes led to the 
various kinds of xylophone and to 
drums or timpani; rapid rotation in the 
air made people invent peals of bells, 
sirens, and their variants; the emission 
of sounds by shaking suggested the 
sistrum and the rattle; the simplest 
methods of friction (on notched sticks 
or toothed bows or “clappers”) pro- 
duced instruments consisting of taut, 
sounding strings to which a bow was 
applied; and the plucking of reeds or 
bark or similar substances led to the 
various instruments based on the plec- 
trum (zither, guitar, harp, and so on). 
At the same time wind instruments 
were invented and developed. Some 
required continuous blowing on one 
or more reeds, which could be open 
or closed, and which might or might 
not have holes to be shut down with 
the finger. On others the blowing 
was intermittent, the sound being 
obtained by the vibration either of the 
mouthpiece (as with horns or trumpets) 
or again of some type of reed (as 
with the oboe, the Greek aulos, or 
the like). 
In varying degree we have certain 
types of evidence for music among 
ancient peoples. There are monu- 
ments figuring scenes of singers, dan- 
cers, and players; some ancient 
musical instruments have survived; 
there are allusions in literature; and 
sometimes there are even musical 
scores in the poetic texts as they have 
been transmitted to us. 
India. Nothing is known of early 
Indian music, except in so far as it 
was connected with the Vedic sacrifice. 
The Vedic hymns (sdman from the 
musical point of view) were sung or 
chanted according to fixed rules, which 
formed the object of a special manual, 
the Rgpréatisakhya. The tradition of 
Vedic chanting has lasted down to 
these days, more or less faithfully 
preserved. 
Four song-books (Gana) are employ- 
ed for study or practice. They are 
technical “works of very late age, 
connected “with the Samaveda. They 
give the Vedic texts in their chanted 
form, i.e., with the insertion of addi- 
tional syllables or whole words (sto- 
bha), mostly meaningless and intended 
to make the verses agree rythmically 
with the melody. Musical notation is 
of a primitive kind. On this basis a 
reconstruction of Vedic hymn-singing 
of 3,000 years ago has been attempted; 
but of course this contains an all-too- 
strong element of surmise and hy- 
pothesis. 
Egypt. On monuments showing 
processions, retinues, and armies on 
the march both singers and players 
are represented. Of the latter some 
have vertical flutes with as many as 
eleven stops, and sometimes double 
flutes; others have harps, with up to 
twenty strings; others have lyres, 
drums, or rattles. 
Assyria preserved and improved the 
types of musical activity which had 
been current in the Middle East since 
Sumerian times. Here too monuments 
show scenes of singers and musicians 
taking part in temple rites, funeral 
ceremonies, processions, and military 
operations. 
For the Hebrews we have the evi- 
dence of the Bible showing that 
music was used to accompany songs, 
both individual lyrics and choral 
chants, at consecration ceremonies 
and at public addresses. We also find 
it used in the recital of the sacred 
prose writings, which were intoned 
against the background of melodious 
compositions following prescribed 
rules. The Hebrews therefore used 
both wind instruments such as the 
horn and also strings (the guitar, lyre, 
and harp) to accompany their choral 
songs, for which the Temple employed 
extensive choirs. 
n the Greek world monu- 
ments as early as the Mycenaean age 
attest the presence of singers and the 
use of musical instruments—the sis- 
trum, the zither, and the flute. Zithers, 
which perhaps derived from Egypt or 
Asia Minor, were of various kinds, 
their size, shape, and the number of 
strings (from seven to eleven) depend- 
ing on the nature of the piece to be 
played. 
Among wind instruments the aulos 
or oboe (made of wood, bone, or 
metal) had various ranges of pitch 
(known as parthenoi, paidikoi, teleioi, 
and hyperteleioi); and the double 
flute, played with both hands, had one 
reed for the song and the other for 
its accompaniment (krousis). Some- 
times use was made of the horizontal 
flute. The ancient syrinx, the shep- 
herd's pipe, had between seven and 
nine reeds of the same length but of 
different diameters; but when used for 
artistic music it developed into an 
instrument in which the lengths of reed 
and their diameters were both dif- 
ferent. Trumpets were of various pro- 
portions and had various depths of 
tone. Percussion instruments inclu- 
ded wooden rattles (castanets), cym- 
bals of various sizes, and timpani. 
From Mycenaean times there were 
two distinct types of musical accom- 
paniment for poetry. One became 
especially popular in lonia, and was 
used in the solo recital or declama- 
tion of epic verse. The sound came 
from the lyre (phorminx), which was 
for the most part played by the sing- 
er himself. The other type of accomp- 
animent was used to provide the tune

Widely played in Mesopotamia 
and Egypt, 4,000 years ago, 
the lute is believed to have been 
invented in the Caucasus region 
or near the Caspian Sea. 
In its different forms it is still 
widely used in Asia.

for lyric poetry, both in solo recitals 
and in choral performances. 
The lliad has many references to 
music, for instance to the singing of 
peans (I, 472; XXII, 391). Moreover 
in the Eighteenth Book, describing the 
scenes on the shield made by Hepha- 
estus, the poet tells of the dances, 
songs, and notes from auloi and phor- 
minges which accompanied a wed- 
ding. There are the shepherds play- 
ing the syrinx, the maidens singing 
to the sound of the lute, the harves- 
ters dancing and yelling, and a piazza 
where young men and girls do their 
dance. 
In later times recitation of poetry 
was accompanied less and less by 
music, and eventually without it alto- 
gether. But lyric accompaniments 
grew in importance and became 
increasingly varied. 
In Dorian lands the choral song 
was revived to express lyric senti- 
ments, both for solo voices and for 
choirs. It was performed in dialogue 
by young men and girls, by athletes 
and dancers, and at weddings. . . 
Meanwhile Pythagoras and his pu- 
pils worked at the study of acoustics 
and mathematics in relation to music. 
We need say no more here than that 
they enunciated the relation between 
musical intervals and the length of 
strings. 
Monuments show how the Etruscans 
too were devoted to music and dan- 
cing and how they made use of both 
on public occasions, at games, and 
at funerals. The instruments in most 
common use were the lyre, the flute, 
and the subulus (or double flute), the 
bronze trumpet with curving mouth- 
piece (lituus), and the circular horn. 
We do not know what their musical 
compositions were like, but they 
must have drawn heavily upon Greek 
models. In execution we can see from 
monuments that it was common prac- 
tice to let two players accompany one 
another, one on strings and one on 
the double flute.
