Day 1: Nova Vi ç o s a
Aboard two fishing boat s , we ’re chugging through
the muddy wat e rs of the Caravelas River to the first sur-
vey site at Nova Viçosa reef.Once out of the ri ve r ’s mouth,
the blue water teems with coral reef animals that only
l i ve in this part of the wo r l d .On our first dive , I descend
past a mat of anemone-like creatures commonly called
“ b a b a - d e - b o i ” , or bu l l ’s slobber. B rush up against this
a n i m a l ’s mucus lining, and you instantly unders t a n d
h ow it got its name.B e l ow this mat , I am surr o u n d e d
by a number of ancient and endemic corals that make
this area such a pri o rity for global conservat i o n .
Over the next three weeks our team of leading
m a rine scientists will log about three dives a day to
document the bank’s marine biodiversity.
Days 2-3: Popa Ve rd e
Our Brazilian fish specialist, R o d rigo Moura,s p i e s
a lemon shark and what will be one of only two shark
sightings for the whole surve y.For the shark-wa ry this
is good news, but to a marine conservationist it is
wo rri s o m e . Sharks are important top predat o rs in the
o c e a n .R e m ove them and you can disturb the ecologi c a l
b a l a n c e .Around the wo r l d , they are increasingly rare

from heavy demand particularly for their fin s ,m e at and
l i ver oil. Fo rt u n at e l y, on this same dive I see a huge
grouper—longer than I am—which is a good sign.
Large fish still thri ve in the wat e rs of A b r o l h o s.



Day 4: In the wake of Cabra l
Exactly 500 ye a rs ago, the Po rtuguese mari n e r
A l vares Cabral reported seeing lush tropical forest
from the same spot where we are anchored. Our view
is ve ry different. L o g ging has destroyed all but about
8 per cent of this unique forest, prompting Conserva-
tion Intern ational to classify it as one of the wo r l d ’s top
“ h o t s p o t s ”or pri o rity areas for conservation (see p.2 1 ) .
D e f o r e s t ation also takes its toll on the ecology of
coastal wat e rs. Erosion unleashes a steady stream of
sediments that can “ c h o k e ” or even bu ry corals.M o s t
of the corals found on the Abrolhos Bank appear
adapted to the turbid conditions that would kill spe-
cies in other parts of the wo r l d .We find one of the
endemic coral,Scolymia we l l s i i, in a pit five centimetres
b e l ow the muddy sea flo o r !
Day 5: C o r u m b a u
We are anchored directly across from the fis h i n g
village of Corumbau where local elders claim they once
bu rned coral to produce house paint.Elsewhere along
the Brazilian coast, there are houses built of coral
b o u l d e rs.These practices have been abandoned bu t
corals and other living marine animals are still har-
vested illegally for sale in the curio trade. One of the
most coveted is the Brazilian snail, S t r o m bus go l i at h ,
which can reach lengths of 35 cm. D u ring our entire
s u rvey we will see only one individual.
Day 8: Pa re d e s
To d ay ’s destination is Brazil’s largest coral reef,
Pa r e d e s.At firs t , the reef looks barren but in crevices
we find several interesting fishes and corals we
haven’t yet seen during the survey.
At the bottom of a steep wall I see one of the
wo r l d ’s strangest looking marine fis h e s : a bat fis h .
Dull green and shaped like a swollen arr ow, the bat-
fish not only swims but crawls along the sand like a rep-
t i l e , using its fins as feet.

Mussimila braziliensis, a coral species found only in Brazil, produces unique mushroom-like
formations known as chaperiões.

Day 13: California Reef
After hours of searching, our boat ’s depth fin d e r
picks up California reef—between 20 and 35 metres
d ow n . But it turns out to be well wo rth the search.
Wrapped in a luxurious gr owth of gorgonian corals,t h e
r e e f’s pinnacles produce new records of corals and
fishes for the surve y.W h at a surp rise to find several colo-
nies of the coral species Po rites bra n n e ri with bright red
tentacles—a sharp contrast from its usual drab brow n -
and-white colour.
R e t u rning to our anchorage at Santa Barbara Island,
we see boats fishing illegally well inside the boundary of the
Abrolhos National Marine Pa r k .The morning before we
radioed in the name and identific ation number of one of
these boats to the park guard.T h at aftern o o n ,we heard a
n aval officer speaking by radio with the alleged offender,
telling him that he shouldn’t get overly concerned as it
was only a “ t o u ri s t ”who provided the inform at i o n .
In the eve n i n g, we decide to check out the local
n i g h t l i f e .Much like a submerged city, a coral reef has
t owe ring structures of stone crawling with denizens,
some of whom spring to life only when the sun sets.
Thousands of polychaete wo rms wriggle around
our underwater lights in a reproductive frenzy know n
as swa rm i n g . On certain nights of the ye a r , linked to
the lunar cy c l e , polychaete wo rms release masses of
s p e rm and eggs. If I keep my light on too long at a cer-
tain spot, I began to feel these wo rms scurrying inside
my ear and brushing my fa c e .We have just observe d
the first known spawning event to take place in Brazil
in Fe b ru a ry.
Day 17: A look at the edge
We are as close as we will get to the edge of the
continental shelf.This is an ideal location for observ i n g
“cleaning stat i o n s”. At certain rocky outcrops,small fis h
await the arri val of the larger fis h ,much like a pit crew
in a motorcar race.The large fish swim up and stop
while the smaller fish begin picking off their parasites.
Day 18: W rapping up
The whole team meets on deck to discuss our
p r e l i m i n a ry fin d i n g s. It looks ve ry likely that our fie l d
collections will reveal many new species, possibly
including 20 polychaete worms and many records
for this area, such as 20 new plant species and five
new fis h e s.We have also discovered that a species of
reef coral once thought rare in Brazil, Stephanoco-
enia michelenii, is actually common.
To our dismay, fish populations seem to be
fewer in number than expected and many of the
individual fish tend to be small.The closer we come
to fishing communities, the wo rse the situat i o n
appears to be.
S e veral months of analysis remain before we
release our final conclusions.The next step will be
to put this inform ation in the hands of conservat i o n
managers. Beyond the mud-choked waters of the
C a r avelas River lie essential areas of biodive rs i t y.We
cannot afford to lose them simply because we
couldn’t evaluate their extraordinary wealth. ■

The Dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus) is one of the many species found 
only in Brazilian waters.
