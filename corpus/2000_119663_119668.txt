The giant panda and the blue whale are sym-
bols of a wildlife whose richness and diversi-
ty we want to preserve, for the protection of
threatened species is one of the oldest ways of
protecting nature itself.
But we now know that biological dive rs i t y,
or biodive rs i t y, is a concept that refers not only 
to species but to the entire living wo r l d , f r o m
genes to the biosphere, the regions of the 
e a rt h ’s crust and atmosphere occupied by living
o r g a n i s m s.
Biodiversity is not static. It can be defined as
a constantly evolving system. Scientists say it
allows living organisms to adapt to environments
that change over time, thus ensuring the conti-
nuity of evolutionary processes.
To d ay, human activities are acknowledged 
to be part of this, but for a long time people 
were seen mainly as agents external to nat u r e ,
ones that upset biodive rs i t y. E f f o rts were 
made to preserve “ v i r gi n ” or “ w i l d ” n at u r a l
spaces by keeping them separate from all human
a c t i v i t y.
The power to destroy
and sustain
It is a fact that human beings are the source
of clear threats to nat u r e . Po l l u t i o n , e x c e s s i ve
h a rvesting of living species, the exterm i n at i o n
of “ h a rm f u l ” s p e c i e s , and the fragmentation 
or destruction of habitats cause species to
disappear and speed up the erosion of biodive r-
s i t y. But since biodive rsity has been conceive d
from a dynamic standpoint, humans have 
also come to be regarded as capable of sustai-
ning biodive rs i t y, as has been shown in France 
in the wooded pasturelands of Normandy 
and Bri t t a ny. E ven tropical forests are often 
the fruit of a lengthy co-evolution between indi-
genous populations and their natural 
e nv i r o n m e n t .
This power to both destroy and sustain biodi-
ve rsity emphasizes the breadth of our responsibi-
l i t y. Human beings are just one species among
o t h e rs , but one that exercises a part i c u l a r l y
demanding process of selection. No part of the
planet can now escape human activity, so the
idea of conserving nature as a whole is no longer
t e n a b l e .
However, we have to weigh up the conse-
quences of our actions on the evolutionary pro-
cess so that we can regulate them.The principle
of the “sustainable management” of biodiversity
springs from this necessary partnership between
human beings and nature.
But what are the yardsticks for such regula-
tion? Perhaps the instrumental value of biodive r-
sity—the goods and services it provides and the
k n owledge scientists draw from it. But since we
e n j oy nat u r e ’s beauty, we have to add in the aes-
thetic or religious feelings it inspires.
The intrinsic value 
of nature
This leads us to the intrinsic or ethical value
of biodiversity. Nature has its own worth, inde-
pendently of how it can serve people. All living
organisms, through their existence and their use
of complex, non-mechanical strategies to survive
and reproduce, have their own value. Beyond
that, biological diversity itself, because it is the
product of evolution and also the condition for its
continuation, has its own intrinsic value, as the
opening lines of the Convention on Biological
Diversity (Rio, 1992) acknowledge.
The human bias behind the instru m e n t a l i s t
approach has often been set against the ecologi-
cal bias underlying the intrinsic value approach,
as if a choice had to be made, as if eve ryone had
to die for the last wolf to be save d , or vice-ve rs a .
But apart from the fact that such options 
are entirely art i f i c i a l , the two approaches 
can coexist, as soon as there is agreement 
about a dynamic and integr ated view of
b i o d i ve rsity as an evolving system that includes
p e o p l e .
H owe ve r , the rise of genetic engi n e e ri n g,
which treats genes as raw mat e ri a l , has put bio-
d i ve rsity in quite a new light. It is now seen as an
e n o rmous pool of resources to be speedily tap-
p e d . As such, genetic biodive rsity is no longer
about the wise management of nat u r e . I t
becomes a source of profit and of conflict among
those seeking to control it. ■
